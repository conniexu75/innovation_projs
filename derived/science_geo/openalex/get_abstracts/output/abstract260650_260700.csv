As the first metatherian (‘marsupial’) species to be sequenced, the opossum provides a unique perspective on the organization and evolution of mammalian genomes. Distinctive features of the opossum chromosomes provide support for recent theories about genome evolution and function, including a strong influence of biased gene conversion on nucleotide sequence composition, and a relationship between chromosomal characteristics and X chromosome inactivation. Comparison of opossum and eutherian genomes also reveals a sharp difference in evolutionary innovation between protein-coding and non-coding functional elements. True innovation in protein-coding genes seems to be relatively rare, with lineage-specific differences being largely due to diversification and rapid turnover in gene families involved in environmental interactions. In contrast, about 20% of eutherian conserved non-coding elements (CNEs) are recent inventions that postdate the divergence of Eutheria and Metatheria. A substantial proportion of these eutherian-specific CNEs arose from sequence inserted by transposable elements, pointing to transposons as a major creative force in the evolution of mammalian gene regulation. The genome of Monodelphis domestica, the South American grey short-tailed opossum, has been sequenced and analysed, giving researchers their first peek at a marsupial's genetic composition. Comparison of conserved elements between marsupials and placental mammals suggests that true evolutionary innovation in protein-coding genes is relatively rare, while the origin of non-coding conserved elements has been rapid in the evolution of placental mammal lineages. One reason for choosing this species of opossum as the first marsupial genome to be sequenced is its long-standing role as a laboratory animal. There is particular interest in the genetics of the immune system and in gene loci involved in neurobiology, neoplasia and developmental biology. The genome of the grey short-tailed opossum Monodelphis domestica has been sequenced and analyzed, giving a first peek at a marsupial's genetic code. Of particular interest are the genetics of the immune system, which has been studied as a model for humans, and of the X chromosome for historical reasons."

That raises the question of whether the atmosphere is able to transport energy from the day side to the night side. Infrared data from the Spitzer Space Telescope have now answered that question for the extrasolar planet HD 189733b. Night and day temperatures are similar, around 950–1,200 K, indicating that energy from the irradiated side is efficiently redistributed throughout the atmosphere. A paper going live online this week reports observations of the atmosphere of the extra-solar plant HD 149026b. It’s a very hot Jupiter, the hottest planet known, at about 2,300 K. This matches predictions for a planet where each patch of surface area instantaneously re-emits all absorbed light as a blackbody. ‘Hot Jupiter’ extrasolar planets are expected to be tidally locked because they are close (<0.05 astronomical units, where 1 au is the average Sun–Earth distance) to their parent stars, resulting in permanent daysides and nightsides. By observing systems where the planet and star periodically eclipse each other, several groups have been able to estimate the temperatures of the daysides of these planets1,2,3. A key question is whether the atmosphere is able to transport the energy incident upon the dayside to the nightside, which will determine the temperature at different points on the planet’s surface. Here we report observations of HD 189733, the closest of these eclipsing planetary systems4,5,6, over half an orbital period, from which we can construct a ‘map’ of the distribution of temperatures. We detected the increase in brightness as the dayside of the planet rotated into view. We estimate a minimum brightness temperature of 973 ± 33 K and a maximum brightness temperature of 1,212 ± 11 K at a wavelength of 8 μm, indicating that energy from the irradiated dayside is efficiently redistributed throughout the atmosphere, in contrast to a recent claim for another hot Jupiter7. Our data indicate that the peak hemisphere-integrated brightness occurs 16 ± 6° before opposition, corresponding to a hotspot shifted east of the substellar point. The secondary eclipse (when the planet moves behind the star) occurs 120 ± 24 s later than predicted, which may indicate a slightly eccentric orbit."
https://openalex.org/W2001088229,"Titan's lower atmosphere has long been known to harbor organic aerosols (tholins) presumed to have been formed from simple molecules, such as methane and nitrogen (CH 4 and N 2 ). Up to now, it has been assumed that tholins were formed at altitudes of several hundred kilometers by processes as yet unobserved. Using measurements from a combination of mass/charge and energy/charge spectrometers on the Cassini spacecraft, we have obtained evidence for tholin formation at high altitudes (∼1000 kilometers) in Titan's atmosphere. The observed chemical mix strongly implies a series of chemical reactions and physical processes that lead from simple molecules (CH 4 and N 2 ) to larger, more complex molecules (80 to 350 daltons) to negatively charged massive molecules (∼8000 daltons), which we identify as tholins. That the process involves massive negatively charged molecules and aerosols is completely unexpected."

We discovered that the awns are also able to propel the seeds on and into the ground. The arrangement of cellulose fibrils causes bending of the awns with changes in humidity. Silicified hairs that cover the awns allow propulsion of the unit only in the direction of the seeds. This suggests that the dead tissue is analogous to a motor. Fueled by the daily humidity cycle, the awns induce the motility required for seed dispersal"

https://openalex.org/W1998037923,"High-velocity weakening of faults may drive fault motion during large earthquakes. Experiments on simulated faults in Carrara marble at slip rates up to 1.3 meters per second demonstrate that thermal decomposition of calcite due to frictional heating induces pronounced fault weakening with steady-state friction coefficients as low as 0.06. Decomposition produces particles of tens of nanometers in size, and the ultralow friction appears to be associated with the flash heating on an ultrafine decomposition product. Thus, thermal decomposition may be an important process for the dynamic weakening of faults."
https://openalex.org/W2012576192,"Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in host defense and inflammatory diseases. The maturation and secretion of IL-1β are mediated by caspase-1, a protease that processes pro-IL-1β into biologically active IL-1β. The activity of caspase-1 is controlled by the inflammasome, a multiprotein complex formed by NLR proteins and the adaptor ASC, that induces the activation of caspase-1. The current model proposes that changes in the intracellular concentration of K+ potentiate caspase-1 activation induced by the recognition of bacterial products. However, the roles of P2X7 receptor and intracellular K+ in IL-1β secretion induced by bacterial infection remain unknown. Here we show that, in response to Toll-like receptor agonists such as lipopolysaccharide or infection with extracellular bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, efficient caspase-1 activation is only triggered by addition of ATP, a signal that promotes caspase-1 activation through depletion of intracellular K+ caused by stimulation of the purinergic P2X7 receptor. In contrast, activation of caspase-1 that relies on cytosolic sensing of flagellin or intracellular bacteria did not require ATP stimulation or depletion of cytoplasmic K+. Consistently, caspase-1 activation induced by intracellular Salmonella or Listeria was unimpaired in macrophages deficient in P2X7 receptor. These results indicate that, unlike caspase-1 induced by Toll-like receptor agonists and ATP, activation of the inflammasome by intracellular bacteria and cytosolic flagellin proceeds normally in the absence of P2X7 receptor-mediated cytoplasmic K+ perturbations.

The protease caspase-1 is constitutively expressed as an inactive zymogen that becomes activated by self-cleavage at specific aspartic residues to generate an enzymatically active heterodimer composed of two p20 and p10 chains (8Yamin T.T.

Recent studies have implicated members of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family of proteins in the regulation of caspase-1 activation (9Franchi L. McDonald C. Kanneganti T.D. Amer A. Nunez G. J.

For example, Ipaf, an NLR family member, and the adaptor ASC have been implicated in activation of caspase-1 in response to Salmonella (11Mariathasan S. Newton K. Monack D.M. Vucic D. French D.M.

In contrast, Ipaf was found to be essential for the control of caspase-1 activation in response to Salmonella or Legionella infection, but dispensable for that induced by the intracellular pathogen Franciscella tularensis and several TLR agonists, including LPS, bacterial lipopeptide, and peptidoglycan (14Amer A.

These studies indicate that TLR-independent cytosolic recognition of bacteria is critical for caspase-1 activation in response to intracellular bacteria. In mouse macrophages, induction of IL-1β secretion by TLR agonists, including LPS, is very inefficient in the absence of a secondary signal that is provided by extracellular ATP (21Perregaux D.G.

In vitro stimulation of macrophages with millimolar ATP activates the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R), an ATP-gated cation channel that upon activation induces rapid collapse of ionic gradients by promoting efflux of K+ (26Sanz J.M.

Consistent with this, stimuli other than ATP such as the K+/H+ ionophore nigericin, hypotonicity, staphylococcal-α-toxin, and protegrins that cause rapid lowering of cytoplasmic K+ concentration also induce potent IL-1β secretion in LPS-primed macrophages (21Perregaux D.G.

Furthermore, incubation of tumor cell lines with purified aerolysin, a pore-forming toxin secreted by Aeromonas species, induces a decrease in cytoplasmic K+ and formation of the inflammasome (33Gurcel L.

However, the importance of intracellular K+ in caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion induced by infection with bacteria remains unknown. In addition, the relevance of ATP-mediated activity remains controversial because non-physiological concentrations of ATP are required for caspase-1 activation and enhanced IL-1β secretion (34Khakh B.S.

Mice were housed in a pathogen-free facility. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were isolated as previously described (37Celada A. Gray P.W. Rinderknecht E. Schreiber R.D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 55-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Briefly, femurs and tibia were removed from the euthanized mouse and briefly sterilized in 70% ethanol. IMDM was used to wash out the marrow cavity plugs, and bone marrow cells were resuspended in L-cell-conditioned medium containing macrophage-colony stimulating factor to stimulate proliferation and differentiation of the marrow progenitors into macrophages. After 5–6 days, the resulting BMDMs were replated and used within 2 days. The animal studies were conducted under approved protocols by the University of Michigan Committee on Use and Care of Animals. Reagents and Bacterial Infection—ATP was from Sigma. Ultrapure E. coli LPS was from InvivoGen. In an experiment with ligands, LPS from Salmonella typhimurium (Sigma) was used with superimposable results. Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strain SL1344 and the isogenic orgA mutant strain BJ66 (SipB-) were a gift of D. Monack, Stanford University, and the isogenic fliC-fljB-mutant was a gift of A. Aderem, University of Washington. The bacteria were grown as previously described (15Franchi L. Amer A. Body-Malapel M.

Bacteria were diluted to the desired concentration in IMDM plus 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and used to infect macrophages at different bacterial/macrophage ratios. After 30-min infection at 37 °C, the macrophages were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and IMDM containing 100 μg/ml gentamycin was added to limit the growth of extracellular bacteria. In the experiment with flagella mutants, Salmonella were spun onto the cells at 1000 rpm to ensure a similar uptake in the absence of motility. E. coli strain was DH5α (Invitrogen), and S. aureus was strain SA113 (ATCC). Listeria wild-type strain, 10403S, and mutant Listeria containing an in-frame deletion of the hly gene (listeriolysin O (LLO) and DP-L2161) were a gift of M. O'Riordan, the University of Michigan. Single colonies were inoculated into 3 ml of brain/heart infusion medium and grown overnight at 300 °C with shaking. On the day of the infection, a 1/10 dilution of the overnight culture was prepared and allowed to grow at 37 °C with shaking to A600 = 0.5, which corresponds to ∼109 CFU/ml. After 60-min infection at 37 °C, the macrophages were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and IMDM containing 100 μg/ml gentamycin was added to limit the growth of extracellular bacteria. Intracellular K+ Concentration—Macrophages were seeded at 1 × 106 cells per well of a 12-well dish the day before the experiment. The day of the experiment cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline before stimulation or infection. At the indicated time point, the medium was removed, and the cells were lysed in 1 ml of 10% nitric acid. The intracellular K+ content was quantified using atomic absorbance spectroscopy and compared with standards. Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed together with the cell supernatant by the addition of 1% Nonidet P-40, complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Clarified lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by electro-blotting. The rabbit anti-mouse-caspase 1 was a kind gift from Dr. Vandanabeele (Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium). Anti-IL-1β was from R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN. Stimulation of Macrophages with Liposome—DOTAP cationic lipid was purchased from Roche Applied Science and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 50 μl of DOTAP cationic lipid was incubated for 30 min in serum-free media with 4 μg of purified flagellin (InvivoGen) in a final volume of 500 μl. After the incubation, 1.5 ml of serum-free media was added, and 1 ml was used to stimulate 2 × 106 macrophages seeded in 6-well plates for 3–5 h. Measurements of Cytokine—Mouse cytokines were measured in culture supernatants with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Cytosolic Flagellin, but Not LPS, Induces Activation of Caspase-1 in the Absence of ATP Stimulation—To determine the role of ATP in activation of the Ipaf inflammasome, we assessed the requirement of ATP stimulation for activation of caspase-1 induced by cytosolic flagellin, a signal that mediates Ipaf-dependent caspase-1 activation and compared the response to that induced by LPS. In these experiments bone marrow-derived macrophages were incubated with various concentrations of LPS, followed by a short stimulation with 5 mm ATP or left untreated, and caspase-1 processing was determined by immunoblotting. In control experiments, treatment with ATP was required for effective caspase-1 activation in macrophages pre-stimulated with LPS (Fig. 1A). To assess if stimulation with cytosolic flagellin requires ATP for caspase-1 activation, we used macrophages deficient in TLR5 to avoid activation of TLR5 by flagellin. Notably, incubation of macrophages with purified flagellin, in the presence of cationic lipid to deliver flagellin to the cytosol, induced caspase-1 activation in the absence of ATP stimulation (Fig. 1B). Thus, unlike LPS, stimulation with cytosolic flagellin does not require ATP to induce effective caspase-1 activation in macrophages. Salmonella, but Not E. coli or S. aureus, Induces Caspase-1 Activation in the Absence of ATP Stimulation—Exposure of macrophages to Salmonella, an intracellular bacterium, induces rapid activation of caspase-1 in the absence of exogenous ATP (11Mariathasan S. Newton K. Monack D.M. Vucic D. French D.M. Lee W.P. Roose-Girma M. Erickson S. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar, 12Mariathasan S. Weiss D.S. Newton K.

To test whether LPS stimulation enhances caspase-1 activation in response to Salmonella, we compared the activation of caspase-1 in naïve macrophages or macrophages pre-stimulated with LPS. We found similar levels and kinetics of caspase-1 activation in naïve and LPS-stimulated macrophages in response to Salmonella infection (Fig. 1, C and D). Furthermore, the processing of caspase-1 was abolished by infection with a Salmonella mutant lacking flagellin in both naïve and LPS-stimulated macrophages (Fig. 1C), indicating that flagellin was required for caspase-1 activation for both non- and LPS-stimulated macrophages. Extracellular bacteria such as E. coli and S. aureus express several pathogen-associated molecular patterns that like LPS stimulate macrophages via TLRs to promote caspase-1 activation. We therefore determined the ability of these extracellular bacteria to activate caspase-1 in the presence and absence of ATP stimulation. Unlike Salmonella, pre-stimulation of macrophages with E. coli or S. aureus did not induce the processing of caspase-1 in the absence of ATP stimulation (Fig. 2A). Notably, as was observed with LPS, pre-stimulation with E. coli or S. aureus induced caspase-1 processing only after stimulation with ATP (Fig. 2A). The processing of caspase-1 was associated with cleavage of pro-IL-1β into mature IL-1β in macrophage extracts stimulated with both extracellular bacteria and then ATP (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that Salmonella, but not extracellular bacteria, induces caspase-1 activation in the absence of ATP stimulation. Flagellin Stimulation in the Cytosol of Ipaf-induced Caspase-1 Activation Does Not Require Low Intracellular K+ Concentration—The expression of flagellin is required for Salmonella to induce caspase-1 activation through Ipaf (15Franchi L.

We tested next if caspase-1 activation induced by flagellin requires depletion of the intracellular K+, an event that appears to be important for LPS-induced caspase-1 activation (11Mariathasan S.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). To test directly this possibility, we delivered purified flagellin, the Salmonella component recognized by Ipaf, to the macrophage cytosol to activate Ipaf and measured the concentration of K+ inside the cell as well as caspase-1 activation. Fig. 3A shows that flagellin, in the presence or absence of the cationic lipid, did not significantly reduce the intracellular K+ levels in both wild-type and Ipaf-deficient macrophages. Analysis of cell extracts revealed that flagellin in the presence of the cationic lipid induced caspase-1 activation as effectively as ATP in LPS-stimulated macrophages (Fig. 3B). The activation of caspase-1 triggered by ATP was abolished when the macrophages were incubated in high K+ medium in both wild-type and Ipaf-deficient cells (Fig. 3, B and C). In contrast, the activation of caspase-1 induced by cytosolic flagellin was dependent on Ipaf but was unaffected by the presence of high K+ concentration in the culture medium (Fig. 3, B and C). The different results obtained with LPS and flagellin were unrelated to the source of LPS in that identical results were obtained with LPS from E. coli and S. typhimurium (data not shown). These results indicate that caspase-1 activation induced through intracellular flagellin and Ipaf, unlike that mediated by ATP in LPS-primed macrophages, is independent of K+ depletion in the host cytosol. ASC Functions Independently of Intracellular K+ Depletion to Regulate Caspase-1 Activation in Response to LPS plus ATP or Intracellular Flagellin—ASC is an adaptor protein that is required for caspase-1 activation induced by Salmonella and a variety of TLR agonists, including LPS (11Mariathasan S.

However, it remains unclear whether ASC controls caspase-1 activation induced by cytoplasmic flagellin or regulates this process by regulating intracellular K+. To determine whether ASC controls intracellular K+, we measured the intracellular K+ levels in wild-type and ASC-deficient macrophages primed with LPS. Stimulation of the macrophages with ATP induced depletion of cytoplasmic K+ levels in both wild-type and ASC-null macrophages (Fig. 4A). Thus, ASC does not regulate caspase-1 activation by controlling the levels of intracytoplasmic K+. In control experiments shown in Fig. 4C, caspase-1 processing induced by ATP in LPS-primed was abolished in ASC-deficient macrophages, which is consistent with previous results (11Mariathasan S.

https://openalex.org/W2171106889,"We reconstructed the radiocarbon activity of intermediate waters in the eastern North Pacific over the past 38,000 years. Radiocarbon activity paralleled that of the atmosphere, except during deglaciation, when intermediate-water values fell by more than 300 per mil. Such a large decrease requires a deglacial injection of very old waters from a deep-ocean carbon reservoir that was previously well isolated from the atmosphere. The timing of intermediate-water radiocarbon depletion closely matches that of atmospheric carbon dioxide rise and effectively traces the redistribution of carbon from the deep ocean to the atmosphere during deglaciation."

We showed that the wakes of a small bat species differ from those of birds in some important respects. In our bats, each wing generated its own vortex loop. Also, at moderate and high flight speeds, the circulation on the outer (hand) wing and the arm wing differed in sign during the upstroke, resulting in negative lift on the hand wing and positive lift on the arm wing. Our interpretations of the unsteady aerodynamic performance and function of membranous-winged, flapping flight should change modeling strategies for the study of equivalent natural and engineered flying devices."

Here we show that the proto-oncogene LRF plays an essential role in the B versus T lymphoid cell-fate decision. We demonstrate that LRF is key for instructing early lymphoid progenitors in mice to develop into B lineage cells by repressing T cell–instructive signals produced by the cell-fate signal protein, Notch. We propose a new model for lymphoid lineage commitment, in which LRF acts as a master regulator of the cell's determination of B versus T lineage."

However, the contributions of the other Y receptors are less clear. Here we show that Y1 receptors are expressed on osteoblastic cells. Moreover, bone and adipose tissue mass are elevated in Y1-/- mice with a generalized increase in bone formation on cortical and cancellous surfaces. Importantly, the inhibitory effects of NPY on bone marrow stromal cells in vitro are absent in cells derived from Y1-/- mice, indicating a direct action of NPY on bone cells via this Y receptor. Interestingly, in contrast to Y2 receptor or germ line Y1 receptor deletion, conditional deletion of hypothalamic Y1 receptors in adult mice did not alter bone homeostasis, food intake, or adiposity. Furthermore, deletion of both Y1 and Y2 receptors did not produce additive effects in bone or adiposity. Thus Y1 receptor pathways act powerfully to inhibit bone production and adiposity by nonhypothalamic pathways, with potentially direct effects on bone tissue through a single pathway with Y2 receptors.

Many physiological functions are regulated by signals processed within the brain. Y receptors, members of the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily, play an important role in this regulatory axis, mediated by their endogenous ligands: neuropeptide Y (NPY), 6The abbreviations used are: NPY, neuropeptide Y; WAT, white adipose tissue; BAT, brown adipose tissue; MAR, mineral apposition rate; rAAV, adeno-associated viral vector. peptide YY, and pancreatic polypeptide. The Y receptor system is complex, consisting of five Y receptors (Y1, Y2, Y4, Y5, and y6), each with varying distributions across peripheral and central tissues, including the hypothalamus. Among a number of responsive tissues, both bone and adipose tissue are known to be regulated, at least in part, via hypothalamic Y2 receptors (1Baldock P.A. Sainsbury A. Couzens M. Enriquez R.F.

Furthermore, deletion of Y2 receptors has recently been demonstrated to decrease Y1 receptor expression in stromal cells, associated with a greater population of progenitor cells, and accounting for the greater synthetic activity of these cells in vitro suggesting an important role of this Y receptor in bone formation as well (see the accompanying report (39Lundberg P.

In addition to effects in bone, Y1 receptors have been considered as important regulators of energy homeostasis, consistent with pharmacological evidence from Y receptor agonists and antagonists to stimulate or inhibit feeding (9Iyengar S.

One hypothesis to reconcile this apparent discrepancy is that hypothalamic and non-hypothalamic Y1 receptors have different effects on energy homeostasis. Given the clear involvement of Y1 receptors in the regulation of energy homeostasis as well as new evidence of a putative role for Y1 receptors on osteoblast-like cells, we investigated the effect of germ line and conditional (adult-onset, hypothalamus-specific) deletion of Y1 receptors in mice. In addition, the potential interaction between Y1 receptor signaling and the previously identified Y2 receptor pathway was assessed in Y1-/-Y2-/- double knock-out mice. Animal Care—All research and animal care procedures were approved by the Garvan Institute/St. Vincent's Hospital Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee and were in agreement with the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purpose. All mice were fed a normal chow diet ad libitum (6% calories from fat, 21% calories from protein, 71% calories from carbohydrate, 2.6 kilocalories/g, Gordon's Specialty Stock Feeds, Yanderra, New South Wales, Australia), with ad libitum access to water. Generation of Y1-/- and Y1-/-Y2-/- Double Mutant Mice—A targeting vector for the Y1 and Y2 receptor genes (Npy1r and Npy2r, respectively) has been used to produce both germ line (Y1-/- or Y2-/-) and conditional (floxed, Y1lox/lox or Y2lox/lox) knock-out mice, as previously published (2Sainsbury A. Schwarzer C. Couzens M. Fetissov S. Furtinger S. Jenkins A. Cox H.M. Sperk G. Hokfelt T. Herzog H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Both of these knock-out strategies result in deletion of the entire coding region of the Y1 or Y2 receptor, including the neomycin selection cassette. Germ line Y1-/- and Y2-/- lines were bred to generate double heterozygote mice, which were then crossed to obtain the double knock-out mouse line. All mice were on a mixed C57BL/6-129/SvJ background. Generation of Adult-onset Hypothalamus-specific Y1 Receptor Knock-out Mice (Y1Hyp)—9- to 10-week-old Y1lox/lox mice were anesthetized with 100/20 mg/kg ketamine/xylazine (Parke Davis-Pfizer, Sydney, Australia and Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany). With the head in the flat skull position using a stereotaxic table (David Kopf, Tujunga, CA), brain injection coordinates relative to Bregma were posterior 0.8 mm, lateral ± 0.5 mm, ventral 4.7 mm, corresponding to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (15Franklin K.B. Paxinos G. The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. Academic Press, San Diego1997Google Scholar). 0.5 μl of virus (1 × 109 plaque-forming units/μl) was injected bilaterally over 10 min using a 26-gauge guide cannula and a 33-gauge injector (PlasticsOne, Roanoke, VA) connected to a Hamilton syringe and a syringe infusion pump (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). Injection with adeno-associated viral vector (rAAV) expressing Cre-recombinase produced hypothalamus-specific Y1 receptor knock-out mice (Y1Hyp). Control Y1lox/lox mice were injected with virus carrying an empty adeno-associated viral vector and are referred to as Y1lox/lox. Mice were housed individually for the ensuing 9 weeks, and body weight was measured three to five times per week at the same time of day. Temperature Measurements—At 5 weeks after rAAV vector injection, body temperature was measured at ∼9.00 h with a rectal thermometer (Physitemp Instruments Inc., Clifton, NJ). Temperature readings were taken within 10 s of removing the mouse from its cage. Repeat readings were taken from each mouse on 3 consecutive days, and the average of the three readings was used for statistical analysis. Feeding and Behavioral Studies—At 6 weeks after rAAV vector injection, mice were transferred from housing on soft bedding to cages with only a single paper towel on the bottom of the cage and allowed to acclimatize for 3 nights. 24-h food and water intake were determined as the average of triplicate readings taken over 3 consecutive days. Actual food intake was calculated as the weight of pellets taken from the food hopper minus the weight of food spilled in the cage. Fecal weight was also determined in triplicate during these analyses. Wild-type mice housed on paper toweling typically used this to build a nest. This “nesting behavior” was quantified by weighing the amount of paper towel that had been shredded. 7 weeks post injection, the effect of 24 h fasting on body weight was determined. Food and water consumption, food spillage, and fecal output were determined as described above after 1 and 2 days of re-feeding, and body weight was also tracked during the first 3 days of re-feeding. Mice were then returned to soft bedding. Glucose Tolerance Tests—At 8 weeks after rAAV vector injection, mice were fasted for 24 h before intraperitoneal injection of a 10% d-glucose solution (1.0 g/kg) with tail blood sampling (∼20-50 μl) at 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after injection. Serum was stored at -20 °C for subsequent analysis. Tissue Collection—Mice were injected with the fluorescent compound calcein (15 mg/kg, Sigma) 10 and 3 days prior to tissue collection to enable subsequent calculation of bone formation rate. Y1Hyp mice and Y1lox/lox controls were culled at 18-19 weeks of age, 9 weeks after rAAV vector injection. Germ line Y1-/-, Y2-/-, and Y1-/-Y2-/- mice and wild-type controls were culled at 15-17 weeks of age. Mice were culled in the freely fed state between 12:00 noon to 3:00 p.m. by cervical dislocation followed by decapitation for collection of trunk blood. Serum was collected and stored at -20 °C until subsequent analysis as described below. The interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) as well as white adipose tissue (WAT) depots (right inguinal, right epididymal or periovarian (gonadal), right retroperitoneal, and mesenteric) were removed and weighed. The weight of these WAT depots were summed together and expressed as total WAT weight, normalized as a percentage of body weight. Both femurs and the caudal vertebrae were excised and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 16 h at 4 °C. Bone Histomorphometry—The right femur was bisected transversely at the midpoint of the long axis, the distal half was embedded undecalcified in methacrylate resin (Medim-Medizinische Diagnostik, Giessen, Germany), and 5-μm sagittal sections were analyzed, as previously described (16Baldock P.A.

The 4th caudal vertebra was sectioned in the sagittal plane, and mid vertebral sections were analyzed as previously described (17Gardiner E.M. Baldock P.A. Thomas G.P. Sims N.A. Henderson N.K.

Briefly, sections were stained for mineralized bone, and trabecular bone volume, thickness, and trabecular numbers were calculated. Bone formation (mineralizing surface), mineral apposition rate, and bone formation rate were calculated, as previously described (16Baldock P.A. Sainsbury A. Allison S. Lin E.J. Couzens M. Boey D.

Osteoclast surface and osteoclast number were estimated using tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-stained sections, with only multinucleated, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive cells associated with the bone surface being included in the analysis. Cortical mineral apposition rate was measured on the anterior periosteal surface in a region extending 1000 μm distal from the midpoint and in an endosteal region extending 1000 μm proximal from the posterior aspect of the growth plate, as previously described (18Siu W.S. Qin L. Leung K.S. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 2003; 21: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Bone Densitometry—Whole femoral bone mineral content and bone mineral density were measured using a dedicated mouse dual x-ray absorptiometer (Lunar Piximus II, GE Medical Systems, Madison, WI) in excised left hind limbs. Femurs were scanned with tibiae attached and the knee joint in flexion to 90°, to ensure consistent placement and scanning of the sagittal profile. Quantitative Computed Tomography—Quantitative computed tomography was used to isolate cortical bone for analysis in male mice, using a Stratec XCT Research SA (Stratec Medizintechnik, Pforzheim, Germany). Scans were conducted using a voxel size of 70 μm, scan speed of 5 mm/s, and slice width of 0.2 mm every 0.5 mm on excised left femurs, as previously described (16Baldock P.A. Sainsbury A. Allison S. Lin E.J. Couzens M. Boey D. Enriquez R. During M. Herzog H. Gardiner E.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2005; 20: 1851-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Bones were scanned in two consecutive slices, 7 and 7.5 mm from the distal margin of the femur, representing a mid femoral aspect. Bone strength index, an indicator of bending strength, was calculated (18Siu W.S. Qin L. Leung K.S. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 2003; 21: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Serum Analyses—Hormone levels in serum samples collected at cull were determined with commercial radioimmunoassay kits: insulin (Linco Research, St. Louis, MO), corticosterone, free T4 (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (Bioclone Australia, Marrickville, New South Wales, Australia). Basal and glucose-induced serum glucose and insulin levels were determined with a glucose oxidase kit (Trace Scientific, Melbourne, Australia) and insulin with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit from Linco Research, respectively. Gene Expression in Mouse Calvarial Osteoblast Cultures—Bone cells were isolated from calvariae of 2- to 3-day-old CsA mice using a modified time sequential enzyme-digestion technique (19Boonekamp P.M. Hekkelman J.W. Hamilton J.W. Cohn D.V. Jilka R.L. Proc. Kon. Ned. Akad. Wetensch. Series B. 1984; 87: 371-382Google Scholar). Cells from populations 6 to 10 were used. These cells showed an osteoblastic phenotype as assessed by their cAMP responsiveness to parathyroid hormone, expression of alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein, and the capacity to form mineralized bone noduli (data not shown). The cells were seeded in culture flasks containing α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, l-glutamine, and antibiotics at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2. After 4 days in flasks, the cells were seeded in culture dishes. Osteoblasts were plated at a density of 104 cells/cm2 in culture dishes containing α-minimal essential medium/10% fetal bovine serum. After attachment overnight, medium was changed to α-minimal essential medium/10% fetal bovine serum. After 7 days of culture, RNA was extracted and used for quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR analyses. RNA Extraction and cDNA Synthesis—Total RNA was extracted from mouse calvarial osteoblasts using the RNAqueous®-4PCR kit following the manufacturer's protocol (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). The RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically, and the integrity of the RNA preparations was examined by agarose gel electrophoresis. Extracted total RNA was treated with deoxyribonuclease I to eliminate genomic DNA according to manufacturer instructions. One microgram of total RNA, following DNase treatment, was reverse transcribed into single-stranded cDNA with a 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit using oligo-p(dT)15 primers. After incubation at 25 °C for 10 min and at 42 °C for 60 min, the avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase was denatured at 99 °C for 5 min, followed by cooling to +4 °C for 5 min. The cDNA was kept at -20 °C until used for PCR. Quantitative Real-time PCR—Expression of Y1 and Y2 receptor mRNA were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR using the TaqMan Universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and a sequence detection system (ABI Prism 7900 HT Sequence Detection System and Software, Applied Biosystems) with fluorescence-labeled probes (reporter fluorescent dye VIC at the 5′-end and quencher fluorescent dye tetramethylrhodamine at the 3′-end). Primers and probes for Y1 and Y2 receptors were analyzed using a kit from Applied Biosystems. To control for variability in amplification due to differences in starting mRNA concentrations, β-actin was used as an internal standard. The specific primers and probes used are as follows for β-actin (sense: 5′-GGACCTGACGGACTACCTCATG-3′, antisense: 5′-TCTTTGATGTCACGCACGATTT-3′, probe: 5′-CCTGACCGAGCGTGGCTACAGCT TC-3′). The relative expression of target mRNA was computed from the target Ct values and the β-actin Ct value using the standard curve method (User Bulletin 2, Applied Biosystems). Isolation and Culture of Bone Marrow Stromal Cells—Bone marrow stromal cells were isolated from 5- to 9-week-old male wild-type and germ line Y1-/- mice as previously described (see accompanying report (39Lundberg P. Allison S.J. Lee N. Baldock P.A. Brouard N. Rost S. Enriquez R. Sainsbury A. Lamghari M. Simmons P. Eisman J.A. Gardiner E.M. Herzog H. J. Biol.

Briefly, marrow was flushed from femurs and tibias with control media, and cells were plated at a density of 1.9 × 106 cells/cm2 in 50-cm2 plastic tissue culture plates. The non-adherent cell population was removed by medium changes 3 and 5 days later. Cells were trypsinized after 7 days in culture with 0.25% trypsin containing 0.53 mm EDTA and re-plated at 3 × 104 cells/cm2 in 24-well plates in either control media or control media containing 100 nm human NPY (Auspep, Parkville, Victoria, Australia). After an additional 5 or 20 days in culture, cells were trypsinized, and viable cell numbers were determined by trypan blue staining. Statistical Analyses—All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Differences between two groups were assessed by two-tailed Student's t test. Differences among multiple groups of mice were assessed by analysis of variance or repeated measures analysis of variance, followed by Fisher's or Contrast post-hoc comparisons if appropriate (StatView version 4.51 or Super-ANOVA, Abacus Concepts Inc., Berkeley, CA). Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. To examine the mechanism behind the elevation in bone mass evident in Y1-/- mice (see accompanying report (39Lundberg P. Allison S.J. Lee N. Baldock P.A. Brouard N. Rost S. Enriquez R. Sainsbury A. Lamghari M. Simmons P. Eisman J.A. Gardiner E.M. Herzog H. J. Biol.

Cancellous Bone—Germ line Y1-/- mice displayed significantly greater cancellous bone volume in the distal femoral metaphysis, with greater trabecular number and thickness (Figs. 1 and 2). Interestingly, this was associated with increased activity of both osteoblastic and osteoclastic lineages. Similar to Y2-/- mice, bone formation rate was greater in Y1-/- mice compared with wild-type mice with enhanced mineral apposition rate (MAR) in both sexes, but no change in mineralizing surface (Fig. 2). However, in contrast to Y2-/- mice, bone resorption was also altered in Y1-/- mice, with significantly greater osteoclast surface in both sexes (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Cancellous bone phenotype in the distal femoral metaphysis of male and female germ line Y1-/- mice. Changes were consistent across both sexes, with lack of Y1 signaling resulting in greater cancellous bone volume (A and H), trabecular number (B and I), and trabecular thickness (C and J). These changes in bone were coincident with greater bone formation rate (D and K) due to greater mineral apposition rate (E and L) with no change in mineralizing surface (F and M). The cancellous bone surface covered by bone-resorbing cells was also altered, with osteoclast surface greater in Y1-/- compared with wild type (G and N). Data are means ± S.E. of 13-18 male mice and 10-13 female mice per group. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; and ***, p < 0.001 versus wild-type mice of the same gender.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These changes in cancellous bone homeostasis were also evident in the caudal vertebrae. At this site, cancellous bone volume was significantly increased in knock-out mice compared with wild-type values (Y1-/-, 30.9 ± 1.2% versus wild type, 25.5 ± 2.4%, n = 5-9 male mice, p < 0.05). As in the femurs, this change was also associated with greater trabecular thickness (Y1-/-, 65.4 ± 2.0 μm versus wild type, 44.0 ± 2.9 μm, p < 0.0001). These cancellous changes are consistent with the previously noted elevation in bone mineral density and content in Y1-/- long bones; however, because cortical bone rather than cancellous bone is the major contributor to changes in bone density and content, the cortical content of bones from Y1-/- mice was further examined. Cortical Bone—Cortical changes in Y1-/- long bones were examined by quantitative computed tomography. At the mid-femur, Y1-/- mice had greater cortical mineral content and density, consistent with greater cortical area and thickness (Fig. 3). Polar moment of inertia and strength index were also significantly greater in the femoral crosssections of Y1-/- compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 3). The observed increase in cortical mineral content in Y1-/- mice combined with the 25% increase in strength index indicate a response sufficient to produce functional relevant changes in bone strength in vivo and highlights the therapeutic potential of such pathways. To further investigate the cellular basis for these differences, both endocortical and periosteal surfaces were examined. Cortical osteoblast activity was increased in Y1-/- mice, with MAR elevated on the femoral endosteal surface an average of 70% in both genders and on the periosteum of male Y1-/- mice with an increase of nearly 7-fold (Fig. 4). Taken together, these data reveal that loss of Y1 receptor signaling results in a generalized elevation in parameters of osteoblast activity, at both axial and appendicular sites leading to greater cancellous and cortical bone accrual. Sustained Elevation of Adiposity in Y1 Receptor Null Mice—Body weight and adiposity of young and aged Y1-/- mice were compared with age-matched wild-type controls to determine progression of the Y1-/- energy homeostasis phenotype. Both male and female Y1-/- mice developed an obese phenotype with advancing age (Fig. 5), indicated by significantly greater body weight, WAT and BAT depots, and with a more pronounced phenotype in female Y1-/- mice. These changes in body weight were not due to changes in stature, because femur length was not significantly different between Y1-/- mice and wild type (data not shown). Thus, whereas wild-type mice showed no changes in body weight and adiposity with age beyond 12 months, Y1-/- mice showed marked and significant increases, indicating a sustained and continuing effect on energy homeostasis and adipocyte function in these mice. To gain insight into possible mechanisms of obesity associated with Y1 deficiency, we measured metabolic parameters and energy expenditure in Y1-/- mice. There was no significant effect of genotype on serum concentrations of corticosterone, glucose, insulin-like growth factor 1, and free T4 and temperature (data not shown); however, serum insulin levels were significantly higher in Y1-/- mice (female Y1-/-, 177 ± 27 pm versus wild type, 56 ± 7pm, n = 17, p < 0.001; male Y1-/-, 220 ± 52 pm versus wild type, 120 ± 18 pm, n = 18, p < 0.05). Because insulin is lipogenic (20Cusin I. Terrettaz J. Rohner-Jeanrenaud F. Zarjevski N. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Jeanrenaud B. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 3246-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 21Sainsbury A. Rohner-Jeanrenaud F. Cusin I. Zakrzewska K.E. Halban P.A. Gaillard R.C. Jeanrenaud B.

FASEB J. 2000; 14: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), it is possible that these higher serum insulin levels may be causally linked to the greater adiposity observed in young and aged germ line Y1-/- mice. Interestingly, and in contrast to the elevated adiposity, Y1-/- mice displayed significant reductions in food intake at 1, 2, and 8 h after re-introduction of food following 24-h fasting (e.g. female Y1-/-, 0.95 ± 0.12 g/2 h versus wild type, 2.12 ± 0.36 g/2 h, n = 4, p < 0.01; male Y1-/-, 1.33 ± 0.16 g/2 h versus wild type, 2.30 ± 0.33 g/2 h, n = 4, p < 0.01), whereas no such reduction in food intake was apparent in Y1-/- mice in the non-fasted state or beyond 24 h of re-feeding. Hypothalamic Y1 Receptors Do Not Regulate Bone Mass—Previously we showed that hypothalamus-specific Y2 receptor deletion leads to pronounced anabolic effects on bone (1Baldock P.A. Sainsbury A. Couzens M. Enriquez R.F. Thomas G.P. Gardiner E.M. Herzog H. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 915-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that the phenotype observed in the bones of germ line Y1-/- mice might also involve signals mediated by the hypothalamus. To test this, we investigated bone homeostasis in mice with adult-onset, hypothalamus-specific deletion of Y1 receptors. Localized Y1 receptor deletion in the hypothalamus was verified by PCR on genomic DNA extracted from the hypothalamus, with forebrain and liver of rAAV vector-injected mice used as negative controls. PCR primers were designed to produce a detectable product only when the Y1 receptor had been deleted. This was the case only in amplified DNA extracted from the h"

This trend proves that the ancient Laurentian ice complex was composed of two large domes to the west and east of Hudson Bay, in accord with one of two classes of earlier reconstructions. Moreover, GIA models that reconcile the peak rates contribute ∼25 to ∼45% to the observed static gravity field, which represents an important boundary condition on the buoyancy of the continental tectosphere."

At high spin imbalances the system does not become superfluid even at zero temperature. In this normal phase full pairing of the minority atoms is observed. This demonstrates that mismatched Fermi surfaces do not prevent pairing but can quench the superfluid state, thus realizing a system of fermion pairs that do not condense even at the lowest temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2010947655,"Large-scale studies of human genetic variation have focused largely on understanding the pattern and nature of single-nucleotide differences within the human genome. Recent studies that have identified larger polymorphisms, such as insertions, deletions and inversions, emphasize the value of investing in more comprehensive and systematic studies of human structural genetic variation. We describe a community resource project recently launched by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to sequence large-insert clones from many individuals, systematically discovering and resolving these complex variants at the DNA sequence level. The project includes the discovery of variants through development of clone resources, sequence resolution of variants, and accurate typing of variants in individuals of African, European or Asian ancestry. Sequence resolution of both single-nucleotide and larger-scale genomic variants will improve our picture of natural variation in human populations and will enhance our ability to link genetics and human health."
https://openalex.org/W2080844302,"Heregulin (HRG)-induced cell responses are mediated by the ErbB family of tyrosine kinase receptors. In this study we have investigated HRG activation of ErbB2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling, and their role in regulating hyaluronan synthase (HAS) activity in human ovarian tumor cells (SK-OV-3.ipl cells). Immunological and biochemical analyses indicate that ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 are all expressed in SK-OV-3.ipl cells and that ErbB4 (but not ErbB3) is physically linked to ErbB2 following HRG stimulation. Furthermore, our data indicate that the HRG-induced ErbB2·ErbB4 complexes stimulate ErbB2 tyrosine kinase, which induces both ERK phosphorylation and kinase activity. The activated ERK then increases the phosphorylation of HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3. Consequently, all three HAS isozymes are activated resulting in hyaluronan (HA) production. Because HRG-mediated HAS isozyme phosphorylation/activation can be effectively blocked by either AG825 (an ErbB2 inhibitor) or thiazolidinedione compound (an ERK blocker), we conclude that ErbB2-ERK signaling and HAS isozyme phosphorylation/HA production are functionally coupled in SK-OV-3.ipl cells. HRG also promotes HA- and CD44-dependent oncogenic events (e.g. CD44-Cdc42 association, p21-activated kinase 1 activation, and p21-activated kinase 1-filamin complex formation) and tumor cell-specific behaviors in an ErbB2-ERK signaling-dependent manner. Finally, we have found that the down-regulation of HAS isozyme expression (by transfecting cells with HAS1/HAS2/HAS3-specific small interfering RNAs) not only inhibits HRG-mediated HAS phosphorylation/activation and HA production but also impairs CD44-specific Cdc42-PAK1/filamin signaling, cytoskeleton activation and tumor cell behaviors. Taken together, these findings clearly indicate that HRG activation of ErbB2-ERK signaling modulates HAS phosphorylation/activation and HA production leading to CD44-mediated oncogenic events and ovarian cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2089361074,"Phototropism, or the directional growth (curvature) of various organs toward or away from incident light, represents a ubiquitous adaptive response within the plant kingdom. This response is initiated through the sensing of directional blue light (BL) by a small family of photoreceptors known as the phototropins. Of the two phototropins present in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, phot1 (phototropin 1) is the dominant receptor controlling phototropism. Absorption of BL by the sensory portion of phot1 leads, as in other plant phototropins, to activation of a C-terminal serine/threonine protein kinase domain, which is tightly coupled with phototropic responsiveness. Of the five phot1-interacting proteins identified to date, only one, NPH3 (non-phototropic hypocotyl 3), is essential for all phot1-dependent phototropic responses, yet little is known about how phot1 signals through NPH3. Here, we show that, in dark-grown seedlings, NPH3 exists as a phosphorylated protein and that BL stimulates its dephosphorylation. phot1 is necessary for this response and appears to regulate the activity of a type 1 protein phosphatase that catalyzes the reaction. The abrogation of both BL-dependent dephosphorylation of NPH3 and development of phototropic curvatures by protein phosphatase inhibitors further suggests that this post-translational modification represents a crucial event in phot1-dependent phototropism. Given that NPH3 may represent a core component of a CUL3-based ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3), we hypothesize that the phosphorylation state of NPH3 determines the functional status of such an E3 and that differential regulation of this E3 is required for normal phototropic responsiveness.

Although sessile, plants can respond adaptively to various environmental stimuli by altering their growth and development.

The identification of phototropin-interacting proteins represents a potentially powerful approach to elucidate how these photoreceptors transduce directional BL signals.

Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 1193-1198PubMed Google Scholar), 2) an NPH3 domain (Pfam accession number PF03000) in the middle of each protein, and 3) a C-terminal coiled coil in most members of the family (5Celaya R.B. Liscum E. Photochem. Photobiol. 2005; 81: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although the functional role(s) of these domains are not fully understood at present, the coiled-coil region of NPH3 is known to be necessary and sufficient for interaction with phot1 (10Motchoulski A. Liscum E. Science. 1999; 286: 961-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), whereas the BTB domain has been shown recently to interact with CULLIN3 (CUL3) in a heterologous insect cell expression system. 3N. Zheng and E. Liscum, unpublished data. 3N. Zheng and E. Liscum, unpublished data. Based on paradigms established in fungal and animal systems, in which BTB domain-containing proteins function as substrate adapters in CUL3-based ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3) (21Stogios P.J. Downs G.S. Jauhal J.J. Nandra S.K. Prive G.G. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: R82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Willems A.R. Schwab M. Tyers M. Biochim. Biophys.

Willems A. Peter M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1681-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 25Krek W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 950-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that NPH3 may function as a core component of a CUL3-based E3 complex that is necessary for phototropic signal progression (5Celaya R.B. Liscum E. Photochem. Photobiol. 2005; 81: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although this hypothesis is currently under investigation, the physical and genetic interactions between phot1 and NPH3 suggest that, whatever the biochemical function of NPH3, it will somehow be regulated by phot1. Given that phot1 is a light-activated protein kinase (26Christie J.M. Swartz T.E. Bogomolni R.A. Briggs W.R. Plant J. 2002; 32: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), it seems reasonable to predict that such regulation of NPH3 function could occur through reversible phosphorylation. NPH3 has been shown previously to exhibit different electrophoretic mobility states that are dependent upon in vivo irradiation conditions; in particular, BL specifically induces a state change to higher mobility relative to mock-irradiated samples (10Motchoulski A. Liscum E. Science. 1999; 286: 961-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). It was proposed that differing phosphorylation states of NPH3 could account for the observed alterations in electrophoretic mobility (10Motchoulski A. Liscum E. Science. 1999; 286: 961-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). However, no direct supporting evidence for this conclusion has been reported. In this study, we use a combination of pharmacological treatments and immunoblot assays to conclusively demonstrate that the higher mobility state of NPH3 does result from dephosphorylation and that this dephosphorylation is dark-reversible. In particular, we show that the BL-dependent increase in the electrophoretic mobility of NPH3 is sensitive to in vivo treatment with protein phosphatase (PPase) inhibitors and that in vitro treatment of samples never exposed to light with λ-PPase can phenocopy the effects of in vivo BL exposure. We further show that exposure of Arabidopsis seedlings to PPase inhibitors results in significantly reduced BL-dependent phototropism, consistent with the action of PPase(s) in phototropic signal transduction. Finally, we also provide evidence that the BL-dependent change in the electrophoretic mobility of NPH3 is dependent upon the phot1 photoreceptor and does not require functional phot2, the cryptochrome cry1 or cry2, or the phytochrome phyA or phyB. These results suggest that absorption of BL by phot1 leads to the activation of a PPase(s) that dephosphorylates an inactive phosphorylated form of NPH3 to allow further progression of phototropic signaling. Plant Growth Conditions and Light Treatments—Seedlings of A. thaliana L. accession Columbia (Col-0) and various mutant genotypes in this background were used as sources of microsomal membranes and for the phototropic assays described in this study. The mutants used in this study have been described previously: phot1-5 (7Huala E. Oeller P.W. Liscum E. Han I.S. Larsen E. Briggs W.R. Science. 1997; 278: 2120-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), nph3-6 (10Motchoulski A. Liscum E. Science. 1999; 286: 961-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), and phot2-1 and phot1-5 phot2-1 (27Kagawa T. Sakai T. Suetsugu N. Oikawa K. Ishiguro S. Kato T. Tabata S. Okada K. Wada M. Science. 2001; 291: 2138-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Seedlings were grown either on agar-based medium or in liquid culture (depending upon the experiment) as described below. First, seeds were surface-sterilized using 30% (v/v) commercial bleach (20 min) and then washed five times with sterile water. Unless noted otherwise, seeds were next placed either on filter paper mounted on 1% agar-solidified half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium (28Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (52758) Google Scholar) in Petri plates or in 15 ml of half-strength Murashige and Skoog liquid medium in 125-250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks. The seeds were then cold-treated for 3 days in darkness before treatment with red light for 1 h to induce uniform germination (29Stowe-Evans E.L. Harper R.M. Motchoulski A.V. Liscum E. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The plates or flasks were next transferred to complete darkness, and seedlings were allowed to grow for 3 days prior to any treatment. For growth of seedlings in liquid medium, the flasks were shaken at 50-60 rpm throughout their growth and subsequent treatments up to tissue collection. For BL treatments, seedlings growing on agar medium were either mock-irradiated or exposed to unilateral BL (29Stowe-Evans E.L. Harper R.M. Motchoulski A.V. Liscum E. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) of various intensities (0.01, 0.1, 1.0, and 10 μmol m-2 s-1) for different time intervals (1, 5, 30, and 240 min), whereas seedlings grown in liquid medium were irradiated with BL (1.0 μmol m-2 s-1) from underneath the flasks with constant shaking. PPase Inhibitor Treatments—The following PPase inhibitors (Sigma) were used in this study: 9,10-deepithio-9,10-didehydroacanthifolicin (okadaic acid (OKA)); 2,3-dimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,3-carboxylic acid anhydride (cantharidin (CN)); and a dicarboxylic acid derivative of CN, 7-oxybicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (endothall (ET)). OKA and CN were dissolved in Me2SO, whereas ET was dissolved in water. To test the influence of these compounds on the electrophoretic mobility of NPH3, a given compound was added to liquid cultures of 3-day-old etiolated (dark-grown) seedlings at the indicated concentrations with or without cycloheximide (Sigma) dissolved in 100% Me2SO. Controls were treated with an equal volume of Me2SO alone. The influence of the PPase inhibitors on phototropism was assayed as follows. First, 3-day-old etiolated seedlings grown vertically on microscopic glass slides coated with half-strength Murashige and Skoog agar medium were completely immersed in half-strength Murashige and Skoog liquid medium containing a given inhibitor (or Me2SO as a control) for 2 h. Next, seedlings on the glass slides were exposed to unilateral BL (2.0 μmol m-2 s-1) for 12 h. After collection of seedlings, hypocotyl lengths and phototropic curvatures were measured using Scion Image software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). Student's t tests were performed to compare the mean responses of seedlings under different treatments. Preparation of Microsomal Membrane Proteins—Microsomal membranes were isolated from seedlings after BL or inhibitor treatments as described by Liscum and Briggs (16Liscum E. Briggs W.R. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 473-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) with noted exceptions. All manipulations described below were performed under dim red light in a 4 °C temperature-controlled room. Seedlings were ground in ice-cold homogenization buffer (25 mm MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.8), 250 mm sucrose, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 8 mm cysteine, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm ∊-aminocaproic acid, 1 mm benzamidine, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), followed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, 15 min to pellet microsomes. Microsomal membranes were then resuspended in resuspension buffer (5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.8), 250 mm sucrose, 4 mm KNO3, 2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 5 mm ∊-aminocaproic acid, 1 mm benzamidine, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture) using a Dounce homogenizer. The resuspended microsomal membranes were aliquoted and stored in -70 °C until used. The concentration of proteins in the microsomal membrane preparations was determined by the Bradford colorimetric method. In Vitro Dephosphorylation Using λ-PPase—All steps of in vitro dephosphorylation reactions were performed under dim red light. Briefly, 20 μg of total microsomal proteins from etiolated seedlings were mixed with 400 units of λ-PPase (New England Biolabs) in manufacturer-supplied buffer supplemented with 2 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, and 0.5% Triton X-100 and incubated on ice for 5 min and then at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.25 volumes of 4× electrophoresis sample buffer (180 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 40% glycerol, 4% SDS. 0.04% bromphenol blue, and 200 mm dithiothreitol). The samples were then heated at 90 °C for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE as described below. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis—Total microsomal proteins (12 μg/sample) were separated on 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) until the 72 kDa-specific band of the prestained molecular mass marker (Fermentas, Hanover, MD) reached the end of the gel. SDS-PAGE-separated proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting in 192 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris, and 20% methanol. For immunodetection, the membrane was first blocked using 5% (w/v) dry milk in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 137 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 (Tris-buffered saline (TBS)/Tween) for 3 h. This was followed by incubation with primary antibody raised against the C-terminal region of NPH3 (1:5000 dilution) (10Motchoulski A. Liscum E. Science. 1999; 286: 961-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) for 2 h in TBS/Tween plus 1% dry milk. The membrane was then washed three times with TBS/Tween, followed by incubation with secondary antibody. The secondary antibody used in this study was alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) diluted to 1:15,000 in TBS/Tween plus 1% dry milk. Finally, the membrane was washed four times with TBS/Tween (without dry milk), and NPH3-specific bands were detected by chemiluminescence using Immobilon AP substrate (Millipore Corp. Billerica, MA). Rapid, Reversible, and Light-dependent Post-translational Modification of NPH3—A previous study has shown that Arabidopsis NPH3 can exist in different modified states depending upon whether seedlings are grown and kept in darkness or exposed to light (10Motchoulski A. Liscum E. Science. 1999; 286: 961-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In particular, NPH3 present in etiolated seedlings treated with BL exhibits increased mobility upon SDS-PAGE relative to NPH3 in seedlings kept in darkness or exposed to red light (10Motchoulski A. Liscum E. Science. 1999; 286: 961-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined in detail several properties of this BL-dependent change in NPH3 mobility. We first examined the fluence rate and time dependences of this response by performing immunoblot analyses on total microsomal proteins isolated from 3-day-old etiolated seedlings exposed to various fluence rates of BL for different periods of time. NPH3 exhibited a clear shift in electrophoretic mobility in membranes from seedlings exposed to very low (0.01 μmol m-2 s-1), low (0.1 μmol m-2 s-1), intermediate (1 μmol m-2 s-1), and high (10 μmol m-2 s-1) fluence rates of BL for as little as 5 min (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). In fact, we observed little, if any, fluence rate dependence for the formation of the higher mobility state of NPH3 (hereafter referred to as light-state of NPH3 (NPH3LS)) over the complete range of light intensities examined. Additional time course studies over a narrower range of irradiation times from 5 to 30 min indicated that the maximal levels of NPH3LS accumulated sometime between 5 and 10 min after the start of BL exposure (Fig. 1B), although a shift in mobility could be detected after as little at 1 min of irradiation (Fig. 1, A and C). It is interesting to note that, after 240 min of BL exposure, some portion of immunoreactive NPH3 appeared to exhibit slightly retarded mobility compared with that of NPH3LS observed at 30 min (Fig. 1A). Such a change in mobility could result either from a reduction/reversal in whatever modification is causing the dark-state NPH3 (NPH3DS)-to-NPH3LS change or from a simple increase in protein abundance. To test the latter possibility, the time course experiment at 1.0 μmol m-2 s-1 BL was repeated in the presence of cycloheximide to prevent de novo synthesis of NPH3. Because the mobility of NPH3 was indistinguishable between 30 and 240 min in cycloheximide-treated samples (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S1), we concluded that the “thicker” band observed at 240 min in the samples without cycloheximide (Fig. 1A) resulted from a de novo increase in NPH3 protein abundance rather than an alteration in post-translational modification. We next investigated whether NPH3DS could be recovered from NPH3LS by placing in vivo BL-treated seedlings back into darkness. Etiolated seedlings were irradiated for 2 h with 1.0 μmol m-2 s-1 BL and then returned to darkness for various times (Fig. 1D). Indeed, we did observe nearly complete recovery of NPH3DS from NPH3LS in the absence or presence of cycloheximide (Fig. 1, E and F). The recovery of NPH3DS from NPH3LS in darkness was visible within 5 min independent of cycloheximide treatment. Interestingly, the recovery of NPH3DS from NPH3LS in darkness followed the same kinetics as that observed for the conversion of NPH3DS to NPH3LS in BL (Fig. 1, compare B and F). Together, these results clearly illustrate that the observed modification of NPH3 is post-translational, dependent upon light, and reversible. Upon long-term (e.g. 12-24 h) exposure to BL, phot1 is known to move from plasma membrane to cytoplasmic locations (31Sakamoto K. Briggs W.R. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1723-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), likely endomembrane compartments (32Kong S.G. Suzuki T. Tamura K. Mochizuki N. Hara-Nishimura I. Nagatani A. Plant J. 2006; 45: 994-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Such prolonged light treatment also renders phot1 less immunodetectable in immunoblot analyses (32Kong S.G. Suzuki T. Tamura K. Mochizuki N. Hara-Nishimura I. Nagatani A. Plant J. 2006; 45: 994-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In contrast, NPH3 was detectable as NPH3LS after prolonged exposure to BL for 24 h at 2.0 μmol m-2 s-1 at levels comparable to those observed in dark-grown samples (data not shown). Moreover, treatment of seedlings for 12 h with BL followed by transfer to darkness for 12 h allowed reversion of NPH3LS back to NPH3DS, similar to what we observed upon short-term light/dark treatments (data not shown). Dark and Light States of NPH3 Represent Different Phosphorylated Forms of the Protein—It has been proposed previously that the post-translational modification(s) leading to altered mobility of NPH3 upon SDS-PAGE might reflect differing phosphorylation states of the protein (10Motchoulski A. Liscum E. Science. 1999; 286: 961-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the influences of PPase inhibitors on the state change of NPH3 in response to BL. If the conversion of NPH3DS to NPH3LS indeed reflects a dephosphorylation event, we should be able to prevent this conversion by pharmacologically blocking the activity of PPases (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, we found that OKA failed to block the BL-dependent conversion of NPH3DS to NPH3LS in 3-day-old etiolated seedlings at concentrations below 1 μm, whereas at 1 μm, this state change was almost entirely prevented. These results indicate that NPH3 in dark-grown seedlings (NPH3DS) exists as a phosphorylated species. Moreover, given that OKA is a cell-permeable toxin that preferentially inhibits PP2A (IC50 = 0.1-1.0 nm) compared with PP1 (IC50 = 10-100 nm) (33Smith R.D. Walker J.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 101-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 34Bialojan C. Takai A. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar) and has no effect on PP2C (35Shenolikar S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 55-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), these results also suggest that the conversion of NPH3DS to NPH3LS in response to BL treatment occurs through dephosphorylation, likely mediated by either PP1 or PP2A. To further investigate the role of PP1 and PP2A in the dephosphorylation of NPH3DS, we employed two additional selective PP1/PP2A inhibitors: CN and ET. Both of these are potent membrane-permeable inhibitors with higher specificity for PP2A (CN, IC50 = 40 nm; and ET, IC50 = 970 nm) than for PP1 (CN, IC50 = 473 nm; and ET, IC50 = 5 μm) (36Deruere J. Jackson K. Garbers C. Soll D. DeLong A. Plant J. 1999; 20: 389-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Erdodi F. Toth B. Hirano K. Hirano M. Hartshorne D.J. Gergely P. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1176-C1184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Li Y.M. Mackintosh C. Casida J.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 1435-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 (C and D), treatment of seedlings with either CN or ET at concentrations >1 μm inhibited the BL-dependent conversion of NPH3DS to NPH3LS, with complete blockage of the state change occurring at ≥50 μm. These pharmacological studies are consistent with the interpretation that the BL-dependent formation of NPH3LS results from the dephosphorylation of NPH3DS and that the dephosphorylation response is mediated by either PP1 or PP2A. NPH3LS Can Be Generated from NPH3DS by Treatment with λ-PPase in the Absence of BL—Because PP1 and PP2A inhibitors were able to prevent the in vivo BL-dependent conversion of NPH3DS to NPH3LS, we next investigated whether the state change could take place in the absence of light by simply exposing microsomal membranes to an active PPase in vitro. λ-PPase was chosen for these assays because it represents a highly active enzyme that has been shown to hy"

However, the specific mechanism by which deletion of Y2 receptors increases bone mass has not yet been identified. Here we show that cultured adherent bone marrow stromal cells from Y2-/- mice also demonstrate increased mineralization in vitro. Isolation of two populations of progenitor cell types, an immature mesenchymal stem cell population and a more highly differentiated population of progenitor cells, revealed a greater number of the progenitor cells within the bone of Y2-/- mice. Analysis of Y receptor transcripts in cultured stromal cells from wild-type mice revealed high levels of Y1 but not Y2, Y4, Y5, or y6 receptor mRNA. Interestingly, germ line Y2 receptor deletion causes Y1 receptor down-regulation in stromal cells and bone tissue possibly due to the lack of feedback inhibition of NPY release and subsequent overstimulation of Y1 receptors. Furthermore, deletion of Y1 receptors resulted in increased bone mineral density in mice.

This increase in bone formation was due to elevated osteoblast activity and resulted in a 2-fold greater trabecular bone volume and significantly elevated cortical bone mass compared with wildtype mice (1Baldock P.A.

Interestingly, conditional deletion of Y2 receptors solely from the hypothalamus of adult mice produced a comparable increase in bone volume within just 5 weeks, demonstrating this to be a potent and centrally mediated pathway (1Baldock P.A.

However, the mechanism by which ablation of either germ line or hypothalamic Y2 receptors stimulates osteoblast activity to increase bone formation is not yet known. The control of bone remodeling has been traditionally thought to be regulated primarily by endocrine systems and by locally acting factors such as cytokines and growth factors. However, this view is gradually changing with increasing evidence that neuronal factors are also able to modify the activity of bone cells. The presence of nerve fibers and neuronal factors within bone tissue has been demonstrated by a number of studies (3Hill E.L. Turner R. Elde R. Neuroscience. 1991; 44: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 4Bjurholm A. Int. Orthop. 1991; 15: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Furthermore, retrograde tracing studies have demonstrated that neuronal input into bone tissue has connections to the hypothalamus, consistent with the demonstration that conditional Y2 receptor deletion in the hypothalamus is capable of altering bone formation (1Baldock P.A.

For example, the presence of vasoactive intestinal peptide receptors has been demonstrated on both these cell types and vasoactive intestinal peptide has been shown to regulate the activity of both osteoblasts and osteoclasts (12Togari A.

Recent studies have revealed that the central antiosteogenic action of leptin is mediated via the sympathetic nervous system, whereas β-adrenergic receptors have been identified on osteoblasts and osteoblast-like cell lines from human, rat, and mouse (19Takeda S.

The presence of neural factors and their receptors within bone cells and their ability to modulate bone cell activity therefore support a potential physiological role for neural factors in the regulation of bone function. The bone-forming osteoblasts originate from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), a multipotential cell type that is also able to give rise to adipocytes and chondrocytes (22Beresford J.N. Bennett J.H. Devlin C. Leboy P.S. Owen M.E. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 341-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Nuttall M.E. Patton A.J. Olivera D.L. Nadeau D.P. Gowen M. J. Bone Miner.

Science. 1999; 284: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (18027) Google Scholar). The isolation and characterization of MSCs has proven to be difficult due to their rarity within bone, lack of knowledge of their localization within bone, and the lack of specific markers for their identification (25Short B. Brouard N. Occhiodoro-Scott T. Ramakrishnan A. Simmons P.J. Arch. Med. Res. 2003; 34: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Various methods have been utilized by different groups to isolate a homogenous population of multipotential mesenchymal progenitors from mice. For example, the immunodepletion of hematopoietic cells following plastic adhesion of stromal cells resulted in a population of cells that expressed stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1), an antigen previously associated with hematopoietic cells, and were subsequently demonstrated to exhibit adipogenic, chondrogenic, and osteogenic potential (26Baddoo M.

Vingron M. Ropers H.H. Nuber U.A. Cell Tissue Res. 2003; 311: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Selection based on 5-flurouracil resistance and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using wheat germ agglutinin and Sca-1 was used for the identification of a candidate osteoprogenitor cell population in mouse bone marrow (28Van Vlasselaer P. Falla N. Snoeck H. Mathieu E. Blood. 1994; 84: 753-763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A method to isolate an immature stromal progenitor cell population from the tissue surrounding bone marrow by depletion of hematopoietic cells followed by cell sorting to isolate Sca-1+ cells was recently developed in one of our laboratories. This cell population exhibited properties of mesenchymal stem cells, being highly proliferative with a high capacity to form colony forming units (CFUs) and exhibiting multipotentiality, with the ability to differentiate down osteoblastic, adipogenic, and chondrocytic lineages (25Short B. Brouard N. Occhiodoro-Scott T. Ramakrishnan A. Simmons P.J. Arch. Med. Res. 2003; 34: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Furthermore, additional sorting of the Sca-1- population of cells using an antibody recognizing CD51 eliminated CD51- erythroid precursor cell types and yielded a more mature “osteoprogenitor” cell population. Here we have investigated whether a change in the osteoprogenitor cell population may contribute to the greater bone formation and bone volume of the Y2 receptor-deficient models. We reasoned that a change in the release of factors may affect the number or the ability of bone-forming precursor cells to develop into mature mineral-producing osteoblasts. To test this we evaluated the ability of bone marrow stromal cells from Y2-/- mice to produce mineral in vitro. We also assessed the number of mesenchymal and progenitor cells in these mice. Furthermore, we investigated whether Y receptors are expressed in this stromal cell population and whether an alteration in Y receptor expression may also constitute a mechanism by which deletion of Y2 receptors leads to increased bone formation in vivo. The results revealed that down-regulation of local Y1 receptor signaling may provide a mechanism for the greater bone formation of the Y2-/- model. Animal experiments were approved by the Garvan/St. Vincent's Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee and were conducted in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Generation of Y1-/- and Y2-/- Mutant Mice—Germ line deletion of Y1 and Y2 receptor genes (Npy1r and Npy2r, respectively) was achieved as previously described (29Howell O.W. Scharfman H.E. Herzog H.

Baron U. Rajewsky K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5080-5081Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar), resulting in the removal of the entire coding region of the Y1 or Y2 gene. Isolation of Bone Marrow Stromal Cells—To isolate plasticadherent bone marrow stromal cells, 5- to 9-week-old male wild-type and germ line Y2-/- mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and marrow was flushed from femurs and tibias with α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 2.2g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 0.017 m HEPES, 100 IU/ml, 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 34,000 IU/ml, 34 mg/liter gentamycin (Control media). Cells were plated at a density of 1.9 × 106 cells/cm2 in 50-cm2 plastic tissue culture plates (BD Biosciences Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and maintained at 37 °C with 5% humidified CO2. The non-adherent cell population was removed after 72 h by a medium change. Cells were trypsinized 4 days later (0.25% trypsin containing 0.53 mm EDTA) and re-plated at 6.6 × 104 cells/cm2 in control media. Cells were changed into differentiation media 2 days later. Differentiation of Bone Marrow Stromal Cell Cultures—Differentiation into adipocytes and mineral-producing osteoblasts was achieved by using adipogenic (control α-minimal essential medium media with 5 μg/ml insulin and 10 nm dexamethasone) or osteogenic media (control α-minimal essential medium media with 50 mg/liter ascorbic acid and 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate), respectively. Staining of Bone Marrow Stromal Cells for Assessment of Osteoblast and Adipocyte Differentiation—Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Osteoblast differentiation and mineralization of extracellular matrix were visualized by von Kossa staining with 2% silver nitrate under UV light for 30 min. The extent of mineralization was assessed using the Leica QWin imaging system (Leica Microsystems, Heerbrugg, Switzerland). Formation of adipocytes was visualized using Oil Red-O (12% Oil Red-O, 60% isopropanol). The extent of adipogenic differentiation was assessed by counting the number of cells containing well stained oil droplets in 10 random low power visual fields using the QWin imaging system. RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis of Cultured Bone Marrow Stromal Cells—RNA was isolated from cultures of bone marrow stromal cells in 12-well plates using TRIzol® reagent as per the manufacturer's instructions. reverse transcription-PCR was performed with TaqDNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) using 1 μl of cDNA synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA with oligo(dT)20 by using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System for reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen). The specific primers and annealing temperatures used along with the resultant product size obtained are as follows: mY1 receptor (323 bp, 55 °C, forward: 5′-CTCGCTGGTTCTCATCGCTGTGGAACGG-3′, reverse: 5′-GCGAATGTATATCTTGAAGTAG-3′), mY2 receptor (520 bp, 60 °C, forward: 5′-TCCTGGATTCCTCATCTGAG-3′, reverse: 5′-GGTCCAGAGCAATGACTGTC-3′), mY4 receptor (367 bp, 56 °C, forward: 5′-TCTACAGACAGTAGACCAGG-3′, reverse: 5′-GTAGGTTGGTCACATTGGAC-3′), mY5 receptor (204 bp, 60 °C, forward: 5′-GGGCTCTATACATTTGTAAGTCTTCTGGG-3′, reverse: 5′-CATGGCTTTGCCGAACATCCACTGATCC-3′), mY6 receptor (347 bp, 56 °C, forward: 5′-GGAGGGATGGTTATTGTGAC-3′, reverse: 5′-GTTGTTGCTCTTGCCACTGG-3′), and mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (269 bp, 57 °C, forward: 5′-ACTTTGTCAAGCTCATTTCC-3′, reverse: 5′-TGCAGCGAACTTTATTGATG-3′). PCR reactions were performed for the number of cycles indicated with denaturing at 94 °C and extension at 72 °C. Quantitative Real-time PCR—Expression of the osteoblastspecific markers alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin and the adipocyte marker peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR using the TaqMan Universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and a sequence detection system (ABI Prism 7900 HT Sequence Detection System and Software, Applied Biosystems) with fluorescence-labeled probes (reporter fluorescent dye VIC at the 5′-end and quencher fluorescent dye tetramethylrhodamine at the 3′-end). The specific primers and probes used are as follow for β-actin (sense: 5′-GGACCTGACGGACTACCTCATG-3′, antisense: 5′-TCTTTGATGTCACGCACGATTT-3′, probe: 5′-CCTGACCGAGCGTGGCTACAGCTTC-3′), osteocalcin (sense: 5′-GGAGGGCAATAAGGTAGTGAACA-3′, antisense: 5′-CACAAGCAGGGTTAAGCTCACA-3′, probe: 5′-CGGCGCTACCTTGGAGCCTCAGTC-3′), and alkaline phosphatase (sense: 5′-GGACTGGTACTCGGATAACGAGAT-3′, antisense: 5′-ACATCAGTTCTGTTCTTCGGGTACA-3′, probe: 5′-CGCCACCCATGATCACGTCGATATC-3′). Primers and probes for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ were analyzed using an inventoried kit from Applied Biosystems. To control variability in amplification due to differences in starting mRNA concentrations, β-actin was used as an internal standard. The relative expression of target mRNA was computed from the target Ct values and the β-actin Ct value using the standard curve method (User Bulletin 2, Applied Biosystems). In Situ Hybridization—Antisense and sense Riboprobes for the mouse Y1 receptor were generated from a cDNA region corresponding to bases 60-653 of the coding sequence (where 1 represents the first base of the translation initiation codon) subcloned into pBluescript plasmid vector (Stratagene). Probes were labeled with digoxigenin-UTP by in vitro transcription with either T3 (antisense probe) or T7 (sense probe) RNA polymerase using a DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Riboprobes were purified from unincorporated label using Sephadex G-25 spin columns, and their yield was assessed by dot blot. In situ hybridization was carried out as previously described with minor modifications (32Parker R.M. Herzog H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1431-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) on 5-μm sections of decalcified bone. All procedures were carried out at room temperature unless specified otherwise. Sections were dewaxed in xylene, rehydrated through decreasing concentrations of ethanol (100% to 70%), and then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS on ice for 10 min. After washing in PBS, sections were incubated at 37 °C with proteinase K (Roche Applied Science) at a concentration of 5 μg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 5 mm EDTA for 20 min, followed by 0.1 m glycine in PBS for 5 min. Sections were acetylated with 1× triethanolamine containing 0.25% (v/v) acetic anhydride for 10 min and washed in PBS before hybridization. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 45 °C in a humid environment. Sections were incubated with hybridization solution containing 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 250 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 250 μg/ml yeast tRNA, 1× Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 200 ng/ml digoxigenin-labeled Riboprobe. The sections were washed in 2× SSC for 5 min followed by 0.2× SSC at 62 °C for 30 min and 0.1× SSC at 65 °C for 30 min. They were then incubated with 20 μg/ml RNase A (Roche Applied Science) in 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, and 1 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 15 min followed by washes with 2× SSC for 5 min, 0.1× SSC at 37 °C for 30 min. Following the washes, antidigoxigenin Fab antibody fragments conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) and nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate stock solution (Roche Applied Science) containing 1 mm levamisole were used for colorimetric detection following the manufacturer's instructions. Isolation of Mesenchymal Stem and Osteoprogenitor Cells—Femurs, tibias, and iliac crests from 8- to 15-week-old male mice were dissected and thoroughly cleaned of muscle and connective tissue, after which the outer surface of the bones was scraped to remove the periosteal surface. Long bones and iliac crests were crushed using a mortar and pestle in washing buffer (2% fetal bovine serum in PBS), then cut up finely in 3 mg/ml Worthington collagenase type 1. Bone fragments were then collagenase-digested for 45 min at 300 rpm at 37 °C. Following digestion, large fragments were removed by filtration (70-μm nylon mesh cell strainer, BD Biosciences). Cells were collected by centrifugation (1000 rpm, 4 min) and resuspended in 2 ml of washing buffer, and the viable cell number was counted using trypan blue. Contaminating hematopoietic cells were removed by lineage depletion using magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) microbeads. Cells were incubated with a mixture consisting of the purified antibodies against B220, Gr-1, Mac-1, CD4, CD8, CD3, CD5 (all 1:500 dilution), and TER119 (1:1000 dilution) (BD Pharmingen) diluted in washing buffer for 20 min at 4 °C. Excess antibody was removed by centrifugation, and the cell suspension was then incubated with MACS® goat anti-rat IgG magnetic microbeads (20 μl per 107 cells, Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany) diluted in washing buffer for 15 min at 4 °C. The cell suspension containing the bound magnetic beads was then applied to a VarioMACS® separator with an LS MACS® Cell Separation Column (Miltenyi Biotech). Eluted negatively selected cells devoid of hematopoietic cells were collected, centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 4 min, and resuspended in 500 μl of washing buffer, and viable cells were counted using trypan blue. To prepare for cell sorting for selection of MSCs and progenitor cells, cells (∼3 × 106) were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C with 2.5 μl each of the biotinylated or fluorescein isothiocyanate- or phycoerythrin-conjugated antibodies against the surface markers Sca-1, CD45 (BD Pharmingen), CD31, and CD51 (BD Biosciences). Appropriate controls (no antibody, isotype control using nonspecific IgG, fluorescein isothiocyanate, phycoerythrin, biotinylated, and all antibodies) were also set up by incubation of 0.5 μl of antibody with ∼20,000 cells for each control group. The secondary fluorescein allophycocyanin-conjugated streptavidin (1:500 dilution, BD Biosciences) was then added to all tubes containing the biotinylated-CD51 antibody (CD51 control tube, all antibodies, and experimental samples), incubated for a further 15 min at 4 °C. 7-Amino-actinomycin D (1:300 dilution, BD Biosciences) was used to detect non-viable cells. Cells were then sorted using a FACS Vantage SE™ (BD Biosciences) with FACSDiva SE™ software version 4.1.2 (BD Biosciences) using a nozzle size of 70 μm at 4 °C to remove remaining contaminating CD31+ and CD45+ hematopoietic cells. The remaining cell population now entirely devoid of hematopoietic cell contamination was then sorted based on Sca-1. Sca-1+ MSC cells were collected. Sca-1- cells were further sorted based on the marker CD51, and Sca-1-CD51+ cells were collected. Culturing and Colony Formation of Sorted MSC and Progenitor Cells—Sca-1+ and Sca-1-CD51+ cells from wild-type and Y2-/- mice were plated at a density of 1000 cells/well in 9.6-cm2 plates (∼100 cells/cm2, BD Biosciences Labware) and cultured in control media (see section above) containing 20% fetal bovine serum, initially in 5% O2/10% CO2/85% N2 (Air Liquide, Melbourne, Australia) at 37 °C for 3 days, then changed into regular culture conditions at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Formation of colonies by MSC and progenitor cells was assessed by evaluation of CFUs on day 7 of culture, when individual colonies were easily identifiable. Cells were initially fixed with 4% formaldehyde, washed with PBS, then stained with filtered (0.2-μm filter, Sartorius, Hannover, Germany) 1% toluidine blue for 15 min at room temperature. The number of positively stained colonies containing >5 cells was counted for each experimental group. Bone Densitometry—Bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) were measured in excised individual femora and tibia from 16-week-old Y1-/- and wild-type mice, following collection and fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde for 16 h using a dedicated mouse dual x-ray absorptiometry (Lunar Piximus II, GE Medical Systems, Madison, WI). Scanning was performed with the knee joint in flexion to 90° to ensure consistent placement and scanning of the sagittal profile. Statistical Analysis—Statistical differences in extent of mineralization or adipocyte differentiation based on values obtained from the image analysis software (Leica Microsystems), and analyses of BMD and BMC in Y1-/- mice, were analyzed using two-tailed unpaired t tests between data from the two genotypes at equivalent time points using StatView version 4.5 (Abacus Concepts, San Francisco, CA). For all statistical analyses, p < 0.05 was accepted as being statistically significant. Greater Mineralization and Adipocyte Formation in Cultured Stromal Cells from Germ Line Y2-/- Mice—To examine whether bone cells from germ line Y2-/- mice exhibit differences in proliferation and mineralization in vitro, we isolated bone marrow stromal cells from wild-type and germ line Y2-/- mice and cultured them under osteogenic and adipogenic conditions to induce differentiation down the osteogenic and adipogenic lineages, respectively. Comparable numbers of cells were isolated from flushed bone marrow from wild-type and Y2-/- mice (wild type, between 7.5 × 107 and 1.7 × 108 cells versus Y2-/-, between 8 and 9.8 × 107 cells obtained from four bones per mouse) and were then plated at equal density. Viable cell numbers as assessed by trypan blue staining did not differ significantly between mutant and wild-type cultures in nondifferentiating control conditions over a week in culture (data not shown), suggesting stromal cells from the two genotypes did not differ in their rate of proliferation. A time-dependent increase in the extent of mineralization was revealed in von Kossa-stained osteogenic cultures, with a more marked accumulation of mineral in cultures from Y2-/- mice compared with wild-type (Fig. 1A). These observations were confirmed by measurements of total mineral area by image analysis, with significantly greater mineralization measured in Y2-/- cultures at days 18 and 21 (Fig. 1B). The pattern of mineralization also appeared to be more evenly distributed in the Y2-/- cultures compared with wild-type cultures, in which mineral appeared to be more centrally localized (Fig. 1A), suggesting the presence of more mineral-producing osteoblastic cells throughout the Y2-/- cultures. Increases in expression of the osteoblast marker genes alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin at days 3 and 9 in Y2-/- cultures supported these observations (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, under control culture conditions with no differentiation-inducing supplements in the media, von Kossa-positive mineral was observed in some wells from Y2-/- but not wild-type mice (data not shown). These findings together suggest an increased capacity of osteoblastic cells from Y2-/- mice to produce mineralized extracellular matrix in vitro. Cells cultured under adipogenic conditions also showed elevated expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorγ, a key regulator of adipocyte differentiation, in day 3 and day 9 Y2-/- cultures (Fig. 1C), as well as a time-dependent increase in adipocyte differentiation, evidenced by Oil Red O staining, with a significantly greater number of adipocytes on days 18 and 21 of culture in cells from Y2-/- compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 1, D and E).

Theoretical models predict that, contrary to classical galaxies, these recycled galaxies should be free of nonbaryonic dark matter. By analyzing the observed gas kinematics of such recycled galaxies with the help of a numerical model, we demonstrate that they do contain a massive dark component amounting to about twice the visible matter. Staying within the standard cosmological framework, this result most likely indicates the presence of large amounts of unseen, presumably cold, molecular gas. This additional mass should be present in the disks of their progenitor spiral galaxies, accounting for a substantial part of the so-called missing baryons."
https://openalex.org/W2080435694,"The inhibitory Smads, Smad6 and Smad7, play pivotal roles in negative regulation of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family signaling as feedback molecules as well as mediators of cross-talk with other signaling pathways.

In the present study, we have found that Smad6 inhibits signaling from the activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)-3/6 subgroup in preference to that from the ALK-1/2 subgroup of BMP type I receptors. The difference is attributable to the interaction of Smad6 with these BMP type I receptors. The amino acid residues responsible for Smad6 sensitivity of ALK-3 were identified as Arg-238, Phe-264, Thr-265, and Ala-269, which map to the N-terminal lobe of the ALK-3 kinase domain.

More than 10 proteins have been identified as members of the BMP family, some of which have also been termed OP (osteogenic protein), GDF (growth-differentiation factor), and CDMP (cartilage-derived morphogenetic protein). The BMP family can be divided into several subgroups based on structure, including the BMP-2/4 group (BMP-2 and BMP-4), OP-1 group (BMP-5, BMP-6, BMP-7/OP-1, and BMP-8/OP-2), GDF-5 group (GDF-5/CDMP-1, GDF-6/CDMP-2/BMP-13, and GDF-7/BMP-12), and BMP-9/10 group (BMP-9/GDF-2 and BMP-10). Ligands of the BMP family have distinct profiles of spatiotemporal expression, exhibit divergent biological activities, and have important in vivo functions during embryonic development, including tissue patterning and organogenesis, as well as tissue remodeling. Aberrant transduction of BMP signaling has been implicated in several diseases, including primary pulmonary hypertension (3Lane K.B. Machado R.D. Pauciulo M.W. Thomson J.R. Phillips III, J.A.

Type II receptor kinase is constitutively active and activates type I receptor kinase through phosphorylation of the GS (Gly-Ser) domain of the type I receptor. Activated type I receptor kinase in turn phosphorylates receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) including Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 (referred to as BMP-specific R-Smads). Phosphorylated BMP-specific R-Smads then form heteromeric complexes with Smad4, a common Smad, and translocate into the nucleus, where they regulate the transcription of various target genes, including Id1, Smad6, and Smad7 (9Afrakhte M.

Smad6 and Smad7, which are induced by BMPs, in turn inhibit the BMP signaling pathways and thus form a negative feedback loop (12Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J. Kawabata M.

Although Smad7 inhibits both TGF-β/activin and BMP signaling, Smad6 efficiently inhibits BMP signaling but only weakly inhibits TGF-β/activin signaling (14Hanyu A. Ishidou Y. Ebisawa T. Shimanuki T.

Three receptor serine/threonine kinases have been identified as type II receptors for BMPs, i.e. BMP type II receptor (BMPR-II), activin type II receptor (ActR-II), and activin type IIB receptor (ActR-IIB). When BMPR-II is expressed, it is preferentially utilized for signal transduction (18Yu P.B. Beppu H. Kawai N. Li E. Bloch K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24443-24450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Similarly, four different BMP type I receptors have been identified, including activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)-3 (also termed BMP receptor type IA), ALK-6 (BMP receptor type IB), ALK-2 (ActR-I), and ALK-1. ALK-3 and ALK-6 are structurally quite similar and constitute a subgroup of type I receptors, whereas ALK-1 and ALK-2 in turn are structurally similar and form another subgroup. ALK-2 and ALK-3 are widely expressed in various tissues, whereas expression of ALK-1 and ALK-6 is restricted to certain types of cells and tissues. Utilization of type I receptors differs depending on BMP ligands; BMP-2 utilizes ALK-3 and ALK-6 (19Ebisawa T. Tada K. Kitajima I. Tojo K. Sampath T.K. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Imamura T. J.

Yagi K. Takehara K. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1483-1489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which may determine the specificity of intracellular signaling. The variation in biological activities of BMPs is thus attributable to differences in affinity for their receptors. However, the signal transduction properties of the individual type I receptors are not yet clearly understood. In the present study, we found that Smad6 inhibited ALK-3 in preference to ALK-2. Smad6 interacted efficiently with ALK-3 but only weakly with ALK-2, whereas Smad7 interacted with both ALK-3 and ALK-2. We identified the amino acid residues responsible for the Smad6 sensitivity of ALK-3, which are located in the N-terminal lobe of the ALK-3 kinase domain. Smad6 also efficiently suppressed ALK-6 signaling while minimally affecting ALK-1 signaling. We conclude that Smad6 principally inhibits the ALK-3/6 subgroup of BMP type I receptors through physical interaction, although multiple modes of action of Smad6 have been reported. Differences in sensitivity to negative feedback regulators appear to affect the signal transduction properties of each receptor, including the duration of receptor activation. Cell Cultures and DNA Transfection—Mouse myoblast C2C12 cells and COS7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Mouse MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells were obtained from Dr. H. Kodama (Ohu University). Cells were grown in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. C2C12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. MC3T3-E1 cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium (Sigma) containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected using FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. DNA Constructs and Chemicals—The constructions of constitutively active forms of BMP type I receptors, wild-type BMPR-II, Smad1, Smad5, Smad6, Smad6N, Smad6C, and Smad7 were described previously (14Hanyu A.

ALK-2 and ALK-3 chimeras or point mutants were generated by a PCR-based approach using ALK-2-QD or ALK-3-QD as a template. All of the PCR products were sequenced. Recombinant human BMP-2 and BMP-6 were kindly provided by Astellas Pharma, Inc., and Dr. T. K. Sampath (Creative BioMolecules, Inc.), respectively. Luciferase Assay—The transcriptional activation induced by BMPs was measured using BRE-Luc, luciferase reporter constructs containing BMP-responsive elements (27Korchynskyi O. ten Dijke P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4883-4891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). C2C12 cells or MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded in duplicate in 12-well plates (Nunc Corporation) and were then transiently transfected with an appropriate combination of promoter-reporter constructs, expression plasmids, and pcDNA3. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were stimulated with BMP-2 or BMP-6 and cultured for another 24 h. Cell lysates were then prepared, and luciferase activities in the lysates were measured by the Dual-Luciferase reporter system (Promega) using a luminometer (MicroLumat Plus, Berthold). When the cells were stimulated with constitutively active type I receptors, the cell lysates were prepared 24 h after transfection. Values were normalized using Renilla luciferase activity under control of cytomegalovirus promoter. In some experiments, levels of expression of recombinant proteins in lysates were determined by immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were then centrifuged. The supernatants were measured for protein concentrations and subjected to immunoprecipitation or immunoblotting as described previously (28Komuro A. Imamura T. Saitoh M. Yoshida Y. Yamori T. Miyazono K. Miyazawa K. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6914-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The antibodies used were as follows: anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma), anti-hemagglutinin antibody (3F10, Roche Diagnostics), anti-α-tubulin antibody (DM1A, Sigma), and anti-phospho-Smad1/5/8 antibody (Cell Signaling). Anti-Smad5 antibody was prepared by immunizing a rabbit with mouse Smad5 (amino acid residues 217–262) expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase. Osteoblastic Differentiation—Cells were cultured in 2.5% FBS-containing medium for 4 h prior to stimulation. Osteoblastic differentiation of C2C12 cells and MC3T3-E1 cells was induced by 100 ng/ml recombinant human BMP-2 or BMP-6 in 2.5% FBS-containing medium (29Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E.

Quantitative Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from C2C12 cells or MC3T3-E1 cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript™ III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was performed using Power SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) and the ABI Prism 7500 Fast Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). All samples were run in duplicate in each experiment. The primers used are listed in the supplemental table. The specificity of the detected signals was confirmed by detection of a dissociation curve containing a single peak. Values were normalized to that for hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1. RNA Interference and Oligonucleotides—Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were introduced into MC3T3-E1 cells using HiPerFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions with 25 nm of siRNA and 12 μl of transfection reagent per well of collagen-I-coated, 6-well plates (Sumitomo Bakelite Co.). HP GenomeWide siRNA (Qiagen, catalog number SI00177149) was used to knock down Smad6 (sense, 5′-GAUUCUACAUUGUCUUACA-3′; antisense, 5′-UGUAAGACAAUGUAGAAUC-3′). AllStars negative control siRNA (Qiagen, catalog number 1027280) was used (sequence not available) as a negative control. Smad6 Inhibits ALK-3 Signaling in Preference to ALK-2 Signaling—Smad6 has been reported to efficiently inhibit BMP signaling but only weakly inhibit TGF-β/activin signaling (14Hanyu A. Ishidou Y.

Chem. 2004; 279: 31568-31574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, effects of Smad6 on each BMP type I receptor have not been well explored. We first examined the inhibitory effects of Smad6 and Smad7 on BMP type I receptors ALK-2 and ALK-3 using their constitutively active mutants. The luciferase reporter assay was conducted in C2C12 mouse myoblast cells using a BMP-responsive reporter BRE-Luc (Fig. 1A). Smad7 equally inhibited the signaling induced by these ALKs. In contrast, Smad6 effectively inhibited ALK-3 signaling but only weakly inhibited ALK-2 signaling. Similar results were obtained when MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblastic cells were used (data not shown). We next examined the effects of Smad6 and Smad7 on the phosphorylation of BMP-specific Smads by each ALK using exogenous Smad1 and Smad5 (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. 1). Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 1A, Smad7 effectively inhibited ALK-2- and ALK-3-mediated phosphorylation of Smad1 and 5, whereas Smad6 inhibited Smad1/5 phosphorylation by ALK-3 but only weakly inhibited that by ALK-2. These findings suggest that Smad6 differentially inhibits phosphorylation of BMP-specific R-Smads by each BMP type I receptor. Effect of Smad6 on BMP-6-induced ALK-2 Activation and BMP-2-induced ALK-3 Activation—In C2C12 and MC3T3-E1 cells, BMP-6 mainly utilizes ALK-2, whereas BMP-2 utilizes ALK-3 for signaling (19Ebisawa T. Tada K. Kitajima I. Tojo K. Sampath T.K. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Imamura T. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3519-3527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), because ALK-6 is not expressed in these cells (19Ebisawa T. Tada K. Kitajima I. Tojo K. Sampath T.K. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Imamura T. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3519-3527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Namiki M. Akiyama S. Katagiri T. Suzuki A. Ueno N. Yamaji N. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Suda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22046-22052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We thus examined the effects of I-Smads on BMP-6- and BMP-2-induced signaling in C2C12 cells (Fig. 1C). Smad7 inhibited signaling by these two BMP ligands to similar extents. In contrast, Smad6 more effectively inhibited BMP-2 signaling than BMP-6 signaling. These findings are consistent with our results that Smad6 preferentially inhibits ALK-3 signaling. BMP-6-induced ALK-2 Activation Results in More Sustained Signaling than Does BMP-2-induced ALK-3 Activation—We next compared induction of osteoblastic differentiation by BMP-2 or BMP-6 (Fig. 1D). MC3T3-E1 cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml BMP-2 or BMP-6 and harvested 0, 1, and 48 h after stimulation. The expression of target genes was then analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. At 1 h after stimulation, BMP-2 and BMP-6 exhibited similar effects on the expression of Id1, a direct target gene of BMP signaling. Interestingly, a striking difference was observed in the induction of alkaline phosphatase, an osteogenic marker, at 48 h after stimulation. BMP-6 was more efficient in inducing alkaline phosphatase than BMP-2 in MC3T3-E1 cells. Similar results were obtained when C2C12 cells were used (data not shown). To elucidate the differences in potency in inducing alkaline phosphatase, we examined the phosphorylation of Smad1/5 by BMP-2 and BMP-6 in MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. 1E). BMP-2 and BMP-6 induced similar levels of Smad1/5 phosphorylation at 1 h after stimulation, consistent with the results on Id1 induction. The phosphorylation of Smad1/5 induced by BMP-6 was, however, sustained up to 48 h after stimulation, whereas that by BMP-2 declined earlier. Similar results were obtained in C2C12 cells (data not shown). These findings suggest that BMP-6-induced ALK-2 activation results in more sustained signaling than does BMP-2-induced ALK-3 activation. Endogenous Smad6 Less Effectively Inhibits BMP-6-induced ALK-2 Signaling than BMP-2-induced ALK-3 Signaling—We then examined whether the lower sensitivity of ALK-2 to Smad6 may account for the more sustained signaling induced by ALK-2. We knocked down Smad6 by transfecting siRNA duplex into MC3T3-E1 cells, because knockdown efficiency was higher in MC3T3-E1 cells than in C2C12 cells (data not shown). Smad6 mRNA expression was decreased to 40% of the control level (data not shown). We then examined the effect of Smad6 knockdown on BMP-induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5. Silencing of Smad6 resulted in more sustained phosphorylation of Smad1/5 by BMP-2 and BMP-6, with a more prominent effect in the case of BMP-2 (Fig. 1F). These findings suggest that BMP-6-induced ALK-2 activation causes more sustained phosphorylation of Smad1/5 due to the lower sensitivity of ALK-2 to Smad6. The Differential Inhibitory Effects of Smad6 Can Be Attributed to Differences in Interaction with BMP Type I Receptors—To explore the mechanism of preferential inhibition of ALK-3 by Smad6, we examined the interaction of Smad6 and Smad7 with BMP type I receptors in transfected COS7 cells (Fig. 2A). I-Smads were immunoprecipitated, and the co-precipitated receptors were detected by immunoblotting. ALK-3 strongly interacted with Smad6 and Smad7, whereas ALK-2 only weakly interacted with Smad6 compared with Smad7. These findings suggest that the differential inhibitory effects of Smad6 can be attributed to differences in interaction with BMP type I receptors. The L45 Loop Does Not Play a Major Role in Determining the Differential Sensitivity of BMP Type I Receptors to Smad6—To determine the region responsible for differential sensitivity to Smad6, we divided the cytoplasmic domains of ALK-2 and ALK-3 into five regions based on sequence alignment between the two proteins (supplemental Fig. 2) and constructed five constitutively active ALK-2/ALK-3 chimeric receptors (Fig. 2B). These mutant proteins exhibited similar levels of signaling activity in luciferase reporter assay when they were expressed at the same levels in cells (data not shown). Region 1 (Arg-147–Gln-207 in ALK-2 and Tyr-176–Gln-233 in ALK-3) contains the GS domain, where type I receptors are phosphorylated by type II receptors. Region 2 (Ile-208–Lys-243 in ALK-2 and Ile-234–Ala-269 in ALK-3) is thought to constitute the β structure with a conserved phosphate-binding loop and ATP binding site. Region 3 (Ser-244–Glu-287 in ALK-2 and Ser-270–Glu-313 in ALK-3) includes the αC helix, which is important for kinase activity, and the L45 loop, which is responsible for the specificity of interaction with R-Smads (31Chen Y.G. Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Shi Y. Pavletich N. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2144-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 32Feng X.H. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3912-3923Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 33Persson U. Izumi H. Souchelnytskyi S. Itoh S. Grimsby S. Engström U. Heldin C-H. Funa K. ten Dijke P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of the L45 loop differ significantly between ALK-2 and ALK-3 (supplemental Fig. 2). Region 4 (Met-288–Pro-330 in ALK-2 and Asn-314–Pro-356 in ALK-3) contains the E6 loop, which has been implicated in the homo-oligomerization of type I receptors (34Huse M. Chen Y.G. Massagué J. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1999; 96: 425-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Region 5 (Ala-331–Cys-509 in ALK-2 and Ala-357–Ile-532 in ALK-3) constitutes the C-terminal lobe of receptor kinase and contains the catalytic segment as well as the activation segment. We then examined the inhibitory effects of Smad6 and Smad7 on signaling from five ALK-2/ALK-3 chimera receptors (Fig. 2C). Smad7 efficiently inhibited the signaling induced by all ALK-2/ALK-3 chimeras. Smad6 effectively inhibited neither signaling by ALK-2 nor that by the chimera receptors containing region 2 of ALK-2 (Fig. 2C, gray bars) but strongly inhibited signaling by ALK-3 and the chimera receptors containing region 2 of ALK-3 (Fig. 2C, open bars). These findings indicate that region 2 of ALK-3 is responsible for the sensitivity to Smad6. Notably, the L45 loop, which is located in region 3, does not appear to play a major role in determining the differential sensitivity to Smad6. Identification of Amino Acid Residues in ALK-3 Responsible for Smad6 Sensitivity—To identify the amino acid residues responsible for the sensitivity to Smad6 in region 2 of ALK-3, we compared the amino acid sequences of region 2 in ALK-2 and ALK-3 (Fig. 3A). Region 2 consists of 36 amino acid residues, 21 of which are identical. Three clusters of divergent sequence were found in region 2 (Fig. 3A, underlined residues). We constructed three ALK-2 mutants in which these residues were replaced by the corresponding residues of ALK-3 (mutants ALK-2-m1, ALK-2-m2, and ALK-2-m3). Each of these mutants exhibited slightly increased sensitivity to Smad6 compared with ALK-2 (supplemental Fig. 3A, open bars). We next constructed six point mutants of ALK-2 in which each divergent amino acid residue was replaced by the corresponding residue in ALK-3 (Fig. 3A, asterisks). Four of the six mutants exhibited increased sensitivity to Smad6 compared with ALK-2 (supplemental Fig. 3B, open bars). We then examined various combinations of point mutations and finally found that a combination of four amino acid residues in ALK-3, Arg-238, Phe-264, Thr-265, and Ala-269, was sufficient to confer ALK-2 with sensitivity to Smad6 (Fig. 3A, boxed). An ALK-2 mutant with replacement at the corresponding positions by these four residues (E212R/S238F/S239T/K243A) exhibited a high degree of sensitivity to Smad6 (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, a reciprocal ALK-3 mutant (R238E/F264S/T265S/A269K) lost sensitivity to Smad6, although it still exhibited sensitivity to Smad7. Consistent results were obtained when we examined the phosphorylation of BMP-specific R-Smads by these receptors (Fig. 3C) and binding of I-Smads to these receptors (Fig. 3D). These findings suggest that Smad6 and Smad7 may interact with different sites on ALK-3. We further found that the C-terminal region of Smad6 (Smad6C, residues 315–496 containing the MH2 domain) interacted with ALK-3 through the critical four residues (Fig. 3E). We conclude that these four residues (R238/F264/T265/A269) in ALK-3 are responsible for interaction with the MH2 domain of Smad6 and confer Smad6 sensitivity to ALK-3. Smad6-sensitive Residues in ALK-3 Map to the N-terminal Lobe of the Kinase Domain—We aligned amino acid sequences of region 2 in ALK-2 and ALK-3 of human, mouse, Xenopus, and zebrafish origin (Fig. 4A). The four residues in ALK-2 (E212/S238/S239/K243) and in ALK-3 (R238/F264/T265/A269), which are responsible for the differences in Smad6 sensitivity, are conserved beyond species. We next mapped the four residues responsible for Smad6 sensitivity on a structural model of the ALK-3 kinase domain, which was constructed based on the ALK-5 kinase structure (Protein Data Bank code 1B6C) (34Huse M. Chen Y.G. Massagué J. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1999; 96: 425-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B, yellow). They are located adjacent to the L45 loop (Fig. 4B, green) but apart from the GS loop (Fig. 4B, cyan). They are not clustered and are instead scattered along the phosphate-binding loop and the αC helix in the N-terminal lobe of the kinase domain. We then examined whether Smad7 affects the interaction of Smad6 with ALK-3, because Smad6 and Smad7 appear to interact with ALK-3 through different sites. As shown in Fig. 4C,"

We have studied the role of NO in signaling during plant defense responses upon xylanase elicitation. Treatment of tomato cell cultures with the fungal elicitor xylanase resulted in a rapid and dose-dependent NO accumulation. We have demonstrated that NO is required for the production of the lipid second messenger phosphatidic acid (PA) via the activation of the phospholipase C (PLC) and diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) pathway. Defense-related responses downstream of PA were studied. PA and, correspondingly, xylanase were shown to induce reactive oxygen species production. Scavenging of NO or inhibition of either the PLC or the DGK enzyme diminished xylanase-induced reactive oxygen species production. Xylanase-induced PLDβ1 and PR1 mRNA levels decreased when NO or PA production were compromised. Finally, we have shown that NO and PA are involved in the induction of cell death by xylanase. Treatment with NO scavenger cPTIO, PLC inhibitor U73122, or DGK inhibitor R59022 diminished xylanase-induced cell death.

Xylanase-induced PLDβ1 and PR1 mRNA levels decreased when NO or PA production were compromised. Finally, we have shown that NO and PA are involved in the induction of cell death by xylanase. Treatment with NO scavenger cPTIO, PLC inhibitor U73122, or DGK inhibitor R59022 diminished xylanase-induced cell death. On the basis of biochemical and pharmacological experimental results, we have shown that PLC/DGK-derived PA represents a novel downstream component of NO signaling cascade during plant defense. Plants are constantly challenged by pathogens. To resist these pathogens, they can activate a battery of responses or defense mechanisms as part of what is generally referred to as the plant defense response. The first step in the induction of the plant defense response is the recognition of certain pathogen-derived molecules known as elicitors. Downstream signal transduction cascades become activated upon recognition of these elicitors. One of the second messengers reported to participate in plant defense responses is nitric oxide (NO). 2The abbreviations used are: NO, nitric oxide; PA, phosphatidic acid; PLC, phospholipase C; PLD, phospholipase D; DGK, diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase; HR, hypersensitive response; PR, pathogenesis-related; NADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SNAP, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine; cPTIO, 2-(4-carboxyphenylalanine)4,4,5,5 tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide potassium; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. 2The abbreviations used are: NO, nitric oxide; PA, phosphatidic acid; PLC, phospholipase C; PLD, phospholipase D; DGK, diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase; HR, hypersensitive response; PR, pathogenesis-related; NADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SNAP, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine; cPTIO, 2-(4-carboxyphenylalanine)4,4,5,5 tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide potassium; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. NO treatments induce plant defense-related transcript accumulation (1Delledonne M. Xia Y. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. Nature. 1998; 394: 585-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar, 2Durner J. Wendehenne D. Klessig D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10328-10333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar), whereas treatments with different inhibitors of NO accumulation compromise the hypersensitive response (HR), a form of programmed cell death induced during plant defense (3Durner J. Klessig D.F. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1999; 2: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Cryptogein, an elicitor from oomycete Phytophthora cryptogea, triggers NO production that subsequently participates in the mobilization of Ca2+ from internal stores, thereby increasing Ca2+ cytosolic concentrations (4Lamotte O. Gould K. Lecourieux D. Sequeira-Legrand A. Lebrun-Garcia A. Durner J. Pugin A. Wendehenne D. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 516-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In animals, NO has been shown to control Ca2+ homeostasis (5Clementi E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 713-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In addition, NO and reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been found to act together triggering apoptosis and executing invasive pathogens (6Brune B. von Knethen A. Sandau K.B. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 351: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In plants, a balanced production of NO and ROS was required for HR (7Delledonne M. Zeier J. Marocco A. Lamb C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13454-13459Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 8de Pinto M.C. Tommasie F. de Gara L. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 698-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, how exactly these two second messengers are related is unknown. The oxidative burst is a massive production of ROS that can act (i) directly on the pathogens, (ii) indirectly by strengthening the cell wall, and (iii) as a signal activating downstream responses such as the induction of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins and HR. In plants, there is pharmacological evidence that NADPH oxidase is the main source of ROS required for the induction of HR (9Lamb C. Dixon R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 251-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (2492) Google Scholar). Genetic experiments have shown that NADPH oxidase is essential for ROS production in the interaction between Arabidopsis and avirulent Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato but also that the effect on the HR is modest (10Torres M.A. Dangl J.L. Jones J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). More recently, it was demonstrated that ROS generated by Arabidopsis NADPH oxidase can antagonize salicylic acid-dependent pro-death signals (11Torres M.A. Jones J.D. Dangl J.L. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 1130-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). It has been observed that the lipid signaling molecule phosphatidic acid (PA) is involved in the activation of NADPH oxidase in macrophages (12McPhail L.C. Waite K.A. Regier D.S. Nixon J.B. Qualliotine-Mann D. Zhang W.X. Wallin R. Sergeant S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In plants, PA has been shown to be able to trigger an oxidative burst suggesting a similar activation of NADPH oxidase (13de Jong C.F. Laxalt A.M. Bargmann B.O. de Wit P.J. Joosten M.H. Munnik T. Plant J. 2004; 39: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 14Sang Y. Cui D. Wang X. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1449-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 15Park J. Gu Y. Lee Y. Yang Z. Lee Y. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Protein kinase (PDK1) reported to be involved in oxidative burst-mediated signaling, has also been shown to bind PA and to be activated by PA (16Anthony R.G. Henriques R. Helfer A. Meszaros T. Rios G. Testerink C. Munnik T. Deak M. Koncz C. Bogre L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 572-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 17Rentel M.C. Lecourieux D. Ouaked F. Usher S.L. Petersen L. Okamoto H. Knight H. Peck S.C. Grierson C.S. Hirt H. Knight M.R. Nature. 2004; 427: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). PA is produced in response to many different stresses including drought, pathogen attack, and oxidative stress (18Zhang W. Yu L. Zhang Y. Wang X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1736: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar, 19Testerink C. Munnik T. Trends Plant Sci. 2005; 10: 368-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). It is generated via two distinct phospholipase pathways, either directly by phospholipase D (PLD) or by the sequential action of phospholipase C (PLC) and diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase (DGK). Both pathways have been shown to be involved in the generation of the oxidative burst in several pathosystems (13de Jong C.F. Laxalt A.M. Bargmann B.O. de Wit P.J. Joosten M.H. Munnik T. Plant J. 2004; 39: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 20Yamaguchi T. Minami E. Ueki J. Shibuya N.

Plant J. 2006; 47: 947-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). PLD hydrolyzes structural phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine (PC), to PA. PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into two different second messengers, DAG and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 is described in animals in the signaling of Ca2+ release from internal stores, whereas in plants, DAG is rapidly phosphorylated by DGK, generating PA (23Munnik T. Irvine R.F. Musgrave A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1389: 222-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). PA generated via the PLC/DGK-enzymatic pathway occurs in response to pathogen-derived molecules, such as specific elicitors or pathogen-associated molecular pattern (13de Jong C.F. Laxalt A.M. Bargmann B.O. de Wit P.J. Joosten M.H. Munnik T. Plant J. 2004; 39: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 20Yamaguchi T. Minami E. Ueki J. Shibuya N.

Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). A well studied pathogen-associated molecular pattern is xylanase. Recently, a xylanase receptor was identified in tomato (25Ron M. Avni A. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1604-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Xylanase perception triggers ethylene biosynthesis, electrolyte leakage medium alkalinization, gene expression, and HR (26Bailey B.A. Dean J.F.D. Anderson J.D. Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 1849-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 27Elbaz M. Avni A. Weil M. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 28Yano A.

Musgrave A. Munnik T. Plant J. 2001; 26: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). So far, the intermediate signals have not been well defined. In cultured tomato cells treated with xylanase, both PLD and PLC/DGK is activated (24van der Luit A.H. Piatti T. van Doorn A. Musgrave A. Felix G. Boller T. Munnik T. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 29Laxalt A.M. ter Riet B. Verdonk J.C Parigi L. Tameling W.I.L. Vossen J. Haring M. Musgrave A. Munnik T. Plant J. 2001; 26: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar); in addition, ROS production has been demonstrated (30Bargmann B.O. Laxalt A.M. Riet B.T. Schouten E. van Leeuwen W. Dekker H.L. de Koster C.G. Haring M.A. Munnik T. Plant J. 2006; 45: 358-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We hypothesize a role for NO downstream of xylanase perception and have investigated (i) NO production; (ii) the function of NO in reported PA signaling; and (iii) the function of NO and PA in the induction of ROS, gene expression, and cell death. Our results indicate that xylanase treatment induces NO and that NO is necessary for PA production. Moreover, NO and the subsequent PA generation via the PLC/DGK pathway, are required for xylanase-induced ROS production, gene expression, and cell death. These results provide evidence that xylanase-induced NO activates PLC/DGK signaling during plant defense. Material—Xylanase from Trichoderma viride was purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Tungstate, reagents for lipid extractions and subsequent analysis and silica 60 thin-layer chromatography plates were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). The NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP); the NO scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenylalanine)4,4,5,5 tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide, potassium salt (cPTIO); and the fluorescent probes 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate (DAF-2DA and DAF-FM-DA), negative control fluorophore 4-AF DA, 2′, 7′,-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA), and CytoxGreen were purchased from Molecular probes (Eugene, OR). The nitric-oxide synthase inhibitors S-ethyl-Itu, l-NMMA, and l-NAME were purchased from Calbiochem. The PLC-specific inhibitor U73122, the DGK-specific inhibitor R59022, and the water-soluble synthetic short chain PA (l-α-phosphatidic acid, dioctanoyl, C8:0) and PC (didecatanoyl, C10:0) were purchased from Sigma. A stock solution of 10 mm PA or PC was prepared in 1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. Cell Suspensions—Suspension-cultured cells (Solanum lycopersicon cv. Money Maker; line Msk8) were grown at 24 °C in the dark at 125 revolutions per min in Murashige-Skoog medium (Duchefa, Haarlem, The Netherlands) supplemented with 5.4 μm naphthalene acetic acid, 1 μm 6-benzyladenine, and vitamins (Duchefa) as described earlier (31Felix G. Grosskopof D.G. Regenass M. Basse C.W. Boller T. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Treatments—Suspension-cultured cells of 4–5 days old were exposed to different treatments in Petri dishes (for RNA isolation), 2-ml reaction vials (for microscopy and lipid assays), or in microwells (for fluorometric measurements) for different time periods. Inhibitor treatments were performed, incubating the cells 30 min prior to the treatment. Visualization of NO Using Fluorescence—Endogenous NO was monitored by incubating 100 μl of cells with 1 μm DAF-2DA (or negative control with fluorophore 4-AF DA) for 30 min at 25 °C in the dark. Thereafter, the cells were subjected to different treatments (for the time periods indicated) and mounted on microscope slides. Fluorescence of cells was visualized by fluorescence microscopy with an excitation filter of 485 nm and a barrier filter of 515 nm and bright field microscopy in an Eclipse E 200 (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) microscope. The production of green fluorescence under these conditions was due to NO. Pictures show general phenomena representative of at least six individual experiments. Quantification of NO and ROS Production by Fluorometry—Fluorometric measurements were performed in a Fluoroskan Acsent microwell fluorometer (Thermo Electron Company, Vantaa, Finland) using Chroma (Chroma Technology Corp., Rockingham, VT) filters D480-40 and D525-30 for excitation and emission, respectively. Eighty-microliter batches of cultured cells were carefully pipetted into wells of a Greiner 96-well plate containing 0.5 μm DAF-FM-DA or 0.025 μm H2DCF-DA and 20 μl of xylanase in the presence or absence of inhibitors or scavengers, as indicated in Figs. 1 and 4. The microwell plate was immediately transferred to the fluorometer for measurement. Fluorescence of each individual well was measured every 2 min over 20 ms at 25 °C. In between measurements, the temperature was maintained at 25 °C, and cells were shaken at 120 revolutions per min with a 1-cm rotation. All experiments were performed in triplicate.FIGURE 4Xylanase-induced ROS production is inhibited by NO scavenging and PLC and DGK inhibition. Cells were incubated 15 min with cell-free medium (control), 200 μg/ml xylanase in the presence or absence of either 1 mm cPTIO (NO scavenger), 5 μm U73122 (PLC inhibitor), or 10 μm R59022 (DGK inhibitor). ROS and NO levels were determined using H2DCF-DA and DAF-FM-DA fluorescent probes, respectively. The relative fluorescence was determined in a microwell fluorometer and expressed as a percentage, 100% corresponding to the relative fluorescence units of xylanase-treated cells in the absence of inhibitors.

Control treatments were performed by adding cell-free medium. Incubations were stopped by adding 20 μl of 50% perchloric acid and subsequently frozen in liquid nitrogen. For short-labeling experiments, 85 μl of cell suspension was equilibrated in a 2-ml reaction vial for 2 h. Two minutes prior to the addition of xylanase or SNAP with the concentrations indicated, 20 μl of cell-free medium containing 5 μCi of 32PO43- was added to the cells. Incubations were stopped as mentioned above. The lipids were extracted by adding 3.75 volumes of CHCl3:MeOH:HCl (50:100:1, v/v) and processed as described previously (32Munnik T. de Vrije T. Irvine R.F. Musgrave A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15708-15715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The lipids were separated on Silica-60 thin-layer chromatography (Merck) plates employing EtAc (EtAc/iso-octane/formic acid/H2O 13:2:3:10, v/v) as a mobile phase. When indicated, alkaline solvent (CHCl3:MeOH (25%, w/v), NH4OH:H2O (90:70:4:16, v/v)), heat-activated impregnated thin-layer chromatography plates (1.2%, w/v), potassium oxalate, and 2 mm EDTA in MeOH:H2O (2:3, v/v) were used. Radioactivity was visualized by autoradiograph. The autoradiographs represent general phenomena, representative of at least three individual experiments. Quantification of PA levels was performed by plot analysis using ImageJ (version 1.32j) processing of non-overexposed autoradiographs. PA levels were quantified against the standard structural phospholipid levels (PA/SL) for Fig. 2. For Fig. 3, PA levels were quantified against the total incorporation of 32Pi into phospholipids. The PA level of each sample was subsequently expressed as fold, taking the PA level of the control as 1.FIGURE 3PLC/DGK activation in xylanase-treated cells. Suspension-cultured tomato cells were labeled with 32Pi for 2 min and then treated for 30 min with cell-free medium (control) or 200 μg/ml xylanase. When indicated, cells were incubated with 1 mm cPTIO (NO scavenger), 5 μm U73122 (PLC inhibitor), or 10 μm R59022 (DGK inhibitor). Lipids were extracted and separated by EtAc thin-layer chromatography. The quantification of 32P incorporation into PA compared with that in the total phospholipids of six independent experiments is plotted underneath. PA levels are expressed as fold increase in relation to control cells. Error bars indicate S.E. of the means.

Fifteen micrograms of total RNA was denatured using glyoxal and subsequently separated on 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis, and then transferred onto Hybond-XL (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were hybridized in modified Church solution (0.5 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 7% SDS, and 10 mm EDTA) (33Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7251) Google Scholar) overnight at 65 °C with radiolabeled fragments of PR1 (34Van Kan J.A.L. Joosten M.H.A.J.

Tameling W.I.L. Vossen J. Haring M. Musgrave A. Munnik T. Plant J. 2001; 26: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Fragments were radiolabeled with the Megaprime DNA labeling system according to the manufacturer’s description (Amersham Biosciences) using [α32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were washed twice with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min, 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min, and 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 65 °C. Hybridization patterns were visualized by autoradiograph. Before rehybridization, blots were stripped by washing the membrane with boiling in 0.5% SDS. Cell Death—Cell death experiments were performed treating 100 μl of cells with 200 μg/ml xylanase, or 10 μm PA and PC in the presence or absence of inhibitors, as indicated in the figure 6 for 19 h at 25 °C. To quantify cell death, the cells were incubated for 10 min with 0.2 μm CytoxGreen and washed with cell-free medium. The fluorescence was then measured in a Fluoroskan Acsent microwell fluorometer using Chroma filters D480-40 and D525-30 for excitation and emission, respectively. Values are expressed as fold induction with respect to the non-treated cells. Four independent experiments were performed in triplicate. In addition, cells were evaluated by fluorescence microscopy with an excitation filter of 485 nm and a barrier filter of 515 nm and bright field microscopy in an Eclipse E 200 (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) microscope. Pictures show general phenomena, representative of at least three individual experiments. Xylanase Triggers NO Accumulation—To investigate whether the elicitor xylanase is able to trigger NO formation, tomato cell suspensions were pretreated for 30 min with the NO-specific fluorophore DAF-2DA (35Kojima H. Sakurai K. Kikuchi K. Kawahara S. Kirino Y. Nagoshi H. Hirata Y. Nagano T. Chem. Pharm. Bull (Tokyo). 1998; 46: 373-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and subsequently incubated in the presence or absence of xylanase. Fig. 1A shows that xylanase induced high levels of NO (as observed by green fluorescence) as compared with the control cells. Fluorescence was abolished in the presence of the NO-specific scavenger cPTIO (Fig. 1A). No fluorescence was observed in the presence of the control fluorophore 4-AF DA (data not shown). This indicates that the fluorescence was caused by NO production. A quantitative dose-response experiment was performed using a fluorometer. NO-specific fluorescence obtained with the NO-specific probe DAF-FM-DA (36Itoh Y. Ma F.H. Hoshi H. Oka M. Noda K. Ukai Y. Kojima H. Nagano T. Toda N. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) was monitored for 30 min in cells treated with increasing concentrations of xylanase (Fig. 1B). Production of NO was observed from 1 μg/ml xylanase, increasing steadily until a maximum production was reached at 400 μg/ml xylanase. The production of NO was rapid and sustained over at least 30 min. The NO-specific scavenger cPTIO reduced NO levels (Fig. 1B). Several sources of NO, either nonenzymatic or enzymatic, have been described in plants. Enzymatic sources include a nitric-oxide synthase-like source and nitrate reductase, but evidence for other enzymatic NO sources exists (37del Rio L.A. Corpas F.J. Barroso J.B. Phytochem. 2004; 65: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). To identify the putative source of NO, inhibitors for NO-producing enzymes were applied. Nitric-oxide synthase inhibitors, such as S-ethyl-Itu (1 mm; (38Garvey E.P. Oplinger J.A. Tanoury G.J. Sherman P.A. Fowler M. Marshall S. Harmon M.F. Paith J.E. Furfine E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26669-26676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), l-NMMA (10 mm), or l-NAME (10 mm) did not affect xylanase-induced NO production (data not shown). Inhibition of nitrate reductase by 1 mm tungstate did not result in a decrease of NO levels upon xylanase treatments (data not shown). Xylanase-induced PA Formation Depends on NO—Fig. 1 shows that xylanase triggers NO production in tomato cells within minutes. Xylanase also triggers PA accumulation in tomato cells as shown previously (24van der Luit A.H. Piatti T. van Doorn A. Musgrave A. Felix G. Boller T. Munnik T. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether NO is involved in PA production in xylanase-treated cells. Phospholipids were labeled by the incubation of cells with 32Pi for 3 h. The cells were subsequently treated for 10 min with xylanase in the presence or absence of the NO scavenger cPTIO. Lipids were extracted and separated by thin-layer chromatography. Fig. 2A shows increased levels of PA in cells treated with xylanase (∼2.5-fold as compared with non-treated cells). Xylanase-induced PA levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner when cells were co-incubated with cPTIO. This demonstrates a correlation between the NO level and the PA accumulation during xylanase treatments. Fig. 2B shows increased levels of PA in cells treated with different concentrations of xylanase, as reported earlier (24van der Luit A.H. Piatti T. van Doorn A. Musgrave A. Felix G. Boller T. Munnik T. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This PA accumulation was inhibited when cells were incubated together with 1 mm cPTIO (Fig. 2B). These studies indicate that NO participates in the elicitation of PA generation in xylanase-treated tomato cells. PLC/DGK Activation Is Responsible for the NO-mediated PA Accumulation—Xylanase-dependent PA increase is reported to occur via both PLC/DGK and PLD. To demonstrate which of the two PA sources NO modulates, experiments were performed directed at either source. The main PA source during xylanase treatments is via PLC/DGK (24van der Luit A.H. Piatti T. van Doorn A. Musgrave A. Felix G. Boller T. Munnik T. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). PLC hydrolyzes PIP2, generating DAG, which is subsequently phosphorylated by DGK to produce PA. A short radiolabeling strategy (39Munnik T. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 227-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) was applied to study whether NO mediates PA formation via PLC/DGK. The method is based on the fact that 32Pi is rapidly incorporated into the ATP pool but slowly into structural phospholipids. AT32P can subsequently be used rapidly by DGK to phosphorylate the PLC-derived DAG to 32PA. In contrast, 32PA derived from PLD activity is only detected upon slow labeling of its substrate, a structural phospholipid such as PC. The latter requires long 32Pi labeling times. Consequently, after a short labeling period, any 32PA produced results from DGK and, hence, PLC activity. Accordingly, tomato cells were labeled for 2 min and treated with xylanase for 30 min. Fig. 3 shows that xylanase induces PA production via PLC/DGK activation. To evaluate whether NO mediates PLC/DGK-dependent PA increase, we studied the effect of cPTIO on xylanase-treated cells. NO scavenger cPTIO did inhibit the xylanase-induced PA production from 2.6- to 1.3-fold (folds as compared with PA levels in control cells) (Fig. 3). Specific inhibitors of PLC (U73122) or DGK (R59022) were used to corroborate that xylanase induces PA formation via PLC/DGK. Inhibition of PLC reduced PA levels from 2.6- to 1.4-fold in xylanase-treated cells. The DGK inhibitor R59022 reduced the xylanase-induced PA levels from 2.6- to 1.7-fold (Fig. 3). PA levels in U73122-, R59022-, or cPTIO-treated cells were comparable with the control (Fig. 3). These studies indicate that xylanase-treated cells generate PA via the PLC/DGK pathway and that NO is required in this process. Experiments were also performed to test whether PLD contributes to the NO-triggered PA formation. PLD has the ability to transfer the phosphatidyl group from its substrate to a primary alcohol, such as 1-butanol (for details, see Ref. 39Munnik T. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 227-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). cPTIO could not inhibit the xylanase-induced PLD activation (data not shown). However, because the PLD activation during xylanase treatments is low, typically 1.25-fold after 30 min (24van der Luit A.H. Piatti T. van Doorn A. Musgrave A. Felix G. Boller T. Munnik T. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), it cannot be discarded that, under our experimental conditions, we were not able to measure a significant effect of NO on PLD activation.

https://openalex.org/W2118749876,"Recently we have shown that crotamine, a toxin from the South American rattlesnake Crotalus durissus terrificus venom, belongs to the family of cell-penetrating peptides. Moreover, crotamine was demonstrated to be a marker of centrioles, of cell cycle, and of actively proliferating cells. Herein we show that this toxin at non-toxic concentrations is also capable of binding electrostatically to plasmid DNA forming DNA-peptide complexes whose stabilities overcome the need for chemical conjugation for carrying nucleic acids into cells. Interestingly, crotamine demonstrates cell specificity and targeted delivery of plasmid DNA into actively proliferating cells both in vitro and in vivo, which distinguishes crotamine from other known natural cell-penetrating peptides. The mechanism of crotamine penetration and cargo delivery into cells was also investigated, showing the involvement of heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the uptake phase, which is followed by endocytosis and peptide accumulation within the acidic endosomal vesicles. Finally, the permeabilization of endosomal membranes induced by crotamine results in the leakage of the vesicles contents to the cell cytosol.

Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) 6The abbreviations used are: CPP, cell-penetrating peptide; HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ES cell, embryonic stem cell; mES cell, mouse ES cell; AP, actively proliferating; BM, bone marrow; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; AO, acridine orange; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; Cy3-crotamine, Cy3-conjugated crotamine; DIC, differential interference contrast; Fcm, fluorescent confocal microscopy; CD, circular dichroism; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. are molecules that display the distinguishing ability to enter eukaryotic cells through an energy-independent mechanism and to efficiently carry a number of biologically active and therapeutically relevant molecules into the cells. They are represented by multiple sequences of short and positively charged peptides rich in arginine and lysine residues that penetrate through usually impermeable cellular membranes and localize in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus of the cells or both (1Gupta B. Levchenko T.S. Torchilin V.P. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2005; 57: 637-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 2Zorko M. Langel U. Adv.

When used as carrier molecules, CPPs are usually covalently linked to the cargo or, alternatively, synthesized or expressed in tandem as a fusion protein with the peptide or protein cargos (4Lin Y.Z. Yao S.Y. Veach R.A. Torgerson T.R. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14255-14258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 5Rojas M. Donahue J.P. Tan Z. Lin Y.Z. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A list of cargo molecules delivered into various cells includes peptides, proteins, fragments of DNA, peptide-nucleic acid, small interfering RNA, liposomes, and magnetic nanoparticles (1Gupta B. Levchenko T.S. Torchilin V.P. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2005; 57: 637-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 2Zorko M. Langel U. Adv.

However, particular approaches to attach them to the CPPs are always required. In addition, the usefulness of the CPPs as therapeutic agents has so far been hampered by the unspecific penetration of these carrier molecules into a vast range of cells (8Lindgren M. Hallbrink M. Prochiantz A. Langel U. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 99-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar, 9Lundberg P. Langel U. J. Mol. Recognit. 2003; 16: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Attempts have been made to confer the required specificity to some CPPs-cargo complexes (10Jiang T. Olson E.S. Nguyen Q.T. Roy M. Jennings P.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 51: 17867-17872Crossref Scopus (720) Google Scholar). The proposed mechanisms by which CPPs penetrate cells as independent molecules or carrying different cargos are still controversial. Several studies have suggested that CPPs translocate into cells via endocytosis (11Richard J.P. Melikov K. Vives E. Ramos C. Verbeure B. Gait M.J. Chernomordik L.V. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 585-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar), although non-endocytotic pathway cannot be excluded (12Derossi D. Chassaing G. Prochaiantz A. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 84-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 13Futaki S. Int. J. Pharm. 2002; 245: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Some CPPs present electrostatic interaction with the extracellular matrix of the cell followed by endocytosis, whereas others appear to translocate across membranes by pore formation (11Richard J.P.

Cottin S. Blanc E. Rees A.R. Temsamani J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31192-31201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Lipid vesicles or membrane-associated heparan sulfate involvement in the uptake mechanisms have also been demonstrated (15Ziegler A. Nervi P. Duörrenberger M. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 138-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Recently we described that crotamine, a myotoxin isolated from the venom of South American rattlesnake, is a CPP presenting both cytoplasmic and nuclear localization. At non-toxic concentrations crotamine penetrates into cells during G1/S period, binding to centrosomes and chromosomes. Accordingly, we have suggested the use of crotamine as a marker of centrioles, of cell cycle, and of actively proliferating (AP) cells (16Kerkis A. Kerkis I. Rádis-Baptista G. Oliveira E.B. Vianna-Morgante A.M. Pereira L.V. Yamane T. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1407-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The specificity of crotamine to AP cells has also been demonstrated by conventional AP cells detection assay. The cells were incubated with 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (5-BrdUrd) and with Cy3 fluorescent dye-conjugated crotamine (Cy3-crotamine) followed by immunostaining with anti-5-BrdUrd antibody, revealing superposition of the 5-BrdUrd and Cy3-crotamine labeling within the nucleus of the AP cells. Moreover, our previously published data suggested that crotamine penetration is a cell cycle-dependent event (16Kerkis A. Kerkis I. Rádis-Baptista G. Oliveira E.B. Vianna-Morgante A.M. Pereira L.V. Yamane T. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1407-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings indicate that crotamine is distinct from any other known natural CPPs. Crotamine is a lysine-rich naturally occurring polypeptide whose structure is stabilized by three disulfide bonds (17Laure C.J. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1975; 356: 213-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 18Rádis-Baptista G. Oguiura N. Hayashi M.A. Camargo M.E. Grego K.F. Oliveira E.B. Yamane T. Toxicon. 1999; 37: 973-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The surface electrostatic potential of crotamine is characterized by a net charge of +10 (19Nicastro G. Franzoni L. Chiara C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 9970-9977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 22McKenzie D.L. Smiley E. Kwok K.Y. Rice K.G. Bioconjugate Chem. 2000; 11: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) encouraged us to evaluate the ability of crotamine to function as a gene delivery system. In the present work we investigated how crotamine and crotamine-plasmid DNA complexes gain access into a variety of AP cells both in vitro and in vivo. We monitored crotamine uptake and its intracellular trafficking, a sequential process involving interaction with cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) followed by endocytosis and peptide accumulation within the lysosomal vesicles. Also, we demonstrated the effects of crotamine on the permeability of the endosomal/lysosomal membranes, which resulted in the leakage of these vesicles contents into the cell cytosol. Materials—Lyso Tracker DND-99 and acridine orange (AO) were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Cell culture medium and supplements were from Invitrogen. Crotalus durissus terrificus venom was extracted from snakes maintained at the Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirąo Preto serpentarium, Sąo Paulo University, and crotamine was obtained essentially as previously described (16Kerkis A. Kerkis I. Rádis-Baptista G. Oliveira E.B. Vianna-Morgante A.M. Pereira L.V. Yamane T. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1407-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Wild-type Chinese hamster ovarian cells (CHO-K1) and their mutants deficient in all cellular glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) as a consequence of the removal of xylosyltransferase (CHO-745) were kindly donated by Dr. Jeffrey D. Esko (Glycobiology Research and Training Center, University of California, La Jolla, CA). The size-defined GAGs used were bovine lung heparin (10 kDa) (a gift from The Upjohn Co., bovine lung heparan sulfate (16 kDa) (a generous gift from Dr. P. Bianchini, Opocrin Research Laboratories, Modena, Italy), and dermatan sulfate (12 kDa), chondroitin sulfate (25 kDa), and chondroitinase ABC (from Seikagaku Kogyo Co., Tokyo, Japan); all were prepared by size exclusion column chromatography (23Conrad H.E. Heparin-binding Proteins. 1998; (, Academic Press, Inc., New York)Google Scholar). Heparinase III (EC 4.2.2.8) and trypsin were purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were from Sigma. Peptide Binding to the Plasmid DNA—Electrophoresis mobility-shift DNA binding assay was performed by analyzing the migration of 2 or 4 μg of circular plasmid DNA (pEGFP-N1), pure or forming condensates with 10 μg of crotamine in agarose gel (1%, w/v) electrophoresis using Tris borate-EDTA buffer. The DNA alone or in complex with crotamine was stained with ethidium bromide in gel and was visualized by using a fluorescent image detection system (model FLA-2000, Fujifilm). Dichroism Analysis—Circular dichroism (CD) experiments were carried out using a Jasco 810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco International Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) coupled to a Peltier Jasco PFD-425S system for temperature control. Far UV-CD spectra were collected from 190–260 nm and averaged over 4–8 scans, with a 1-mm path length quartz cell. A 0.5-nm-step resolution, 50 nm/min speed, 8-s response time, and 1-nm bandwidth were used. The experiments were performed at 37 °C with 20 μm crotamine in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The observed ellipticity was normalized to units of degrees·cm2·dmol-1. Base-line recordings were routinely made in the presence or absence of 20 μm GAGs. All data were obtained using three different solutions of the proteins. After base-line correction, the observed ellipticity [θ] (millidegrees) was converted to the molar mean residue ellipticity [θ] (deg·cm2·dmol-1) and used to correct the crotamine spectra. Labeling of Crotamine with Fluorescent Dye—Fluorescent crotamine derivatives were prepared by using the Fluorolink™ Cy3-reactive dye (GE Healthcare) or the FluoReporter® FITC protein labeling kit (Molecular Probes, The Netherlands) following the instructions of the respective manufacturers. After labeling, the remaining free fluorescent dye was eliminated by using a Centricon spin column with a 3000-Da cut-off (Centricon 3 molecular weight cutoff concentrator, Amicon, Millipore Co.). The degree of labeling was estimated by absorbance measurements as indicated by the dye manufacturers and confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analyses (TofSpec-E, Micromass, UK). Peptide-DNA Complex Formation—To produce crotamine-DNA complexes, the plasmidial vector pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA), which contains the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene, was used. Two and four μg of the plasmid DNA were incubated for 5 min with 10 μg of crotamine in 200 μl of 150 mm NaCl with occasional vortexing to form the peptide-DNA complexes. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—Mouse embryonic stem (mES) cell line USP 1 in passages 8–10 were grown onto a feeder layer of non-dividing, irradiated mouse primary embryonic fibroblasts under appropriate culture conditions (24Soukoyan M.A. Kerkis A.Y. Mello M.R.B. Kerkis I.E. Visintin J.A. Pereira L.V. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 2002; 35: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Human carcinoma cells HCT116 were cultured in McCoy’s medium with 10% fetal calf serum and without antibiotics. In Vitro and In Vivo Gene Transfection—All cells lines used in the in vitro studies were plated on 6 × 35-mm well plates using appropriate cell culture media. One day before transfection the cells were plated at a density calculated for each cell line reaching about 70% confluence in 24 h. On the day of transfection, the peptide-DNA complexes formed with 2 or 4 μg of DNA with 10 μg of crotamine in 0.2 ml of 150 mm NaCl were added dropwise to the cultured cells. In the control wells, 2 or 4 μg of plasmid DNA alone were added. Cells were incubated with the peptide-DNA complex for 6 and 24 h followed by a 24-h period in the absence of the complex, and then the cells were observed under confocal microscope. For the in vivo transfection assays, mice (n = 20) were injected intraperitoneally with 0.2 ml of complex solution containing 2 μg of DNA and 10 μg of crotamine or as a control group with 0.2 ml of solution containing plasmid DNA alone. Mice were sacrificed either 24 h or 30 days after intraperitoneal injection. The living cells from bone marrow (BM) and peritoneal liquid were isolated and observed directly under confocal microscope. Also, lung and liver tissues were dissected, and 6–10-μm cryostat sections were prepared using a Tissue-Tek embedding matrix (Sakura, Torrance, CA) and a cryo-microtome (Model CM 1100, Leica, Germany). Microscope slides were mounted in anti-fade and observed under confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 510, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Assay for Proliferative Activity of Cells—Proliferative activity of embryonic stem (ES) cells was analyzed by using FITC-conjugated anti-proliferating cells nuclear antigen antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). About 106 cells were incubated with antibody for 30 min in an ice bath and washed in PBS plus 2% fetal bovine serum and 1 μm NaN3. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on fluorescence-activated cell sorter (BD Biosciences) using the CELL Quest program (BD Biosciences). Binding of Crotamine to GAGs—A decrease in the fluorescence of crotamine (excitation at 280 nm and emission at 350 nm) after its binding to soluble GAGs was expected to occur. Thus, the intensity of this variation was taken as a measure of the binding and was used to determine the affinity of crotamine for heparin, heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, unless otherwise specified. The fluorescence of the crotamine solutions was measured in a Hitachi-F2500 spectrofluorimeter with the excitation wavelength set at 280 nm (10 nm slit) and the emission scanned in the range of 300–400 nm (20 nm slit). The dependence of the relative fluorescence change, i.e. ΔF/Fo = (Fo - Fobs)/Fo, where Fo is the initial fluorescence value of the crotamine solution and Fobs is the observed fluorescence value after each GAG addition was analyzed by nonlinear least-squares data fitting by the binding equation (Equation 1) using the Grafit software, ΔFFo=ΔFmaxFo×[(P+nH+Kd)-(P+nH+Kd)2-4PnH]2P1 where P is the total crotamine concentration, H represents the added GAG concentration, n is the stoichiometry, Kd is the dissociation constant, and ΔFmax/Fo is the maximum relative fluorescence change. The effect of the ionic strength on the dissociation constant was investigated by adjusting the buffer ionic strength with NaCl. The Kd value relates to the ionic strength according to the polyelectrolyte theory of Record et al. (25Record M.T.J. Lohman M.L. De Haseth P. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 107: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar) by using Equation 2, log Kd=log KNI+Zψlog l 2 where KNI is the non-ionic dissociation constant at 1 m NaCl, Z is the number of ionic interactions, I is the ionic strength, and Ψ is the fraction of bound counter-ion for each charged site on the GAG that is released upon binding to the crotamine. Heparin-Sepharose Affinity Chromatography—The interaction of crotamine and heparin was assessed qualitatively by affinity chromatography. Crotamine and Cy3-crotamine (5 μm) were applied on heparin-Sepharose column (4 ml) previously equilibrated with 0.05 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5. A linear NaCl gradient (0–1.0 m) was used to elute the bound material at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The collected fractions were monitored at 280 nm for crotamine and by fluorescence detection for Cy3-crotamine. The fluorescence of Cy3 dye present in the Cy3-crotamine solutions was monitored by measuring the fluorescence at λem = 570 nm after excitation at λex = 550 nm (10-nm slit) in a Hitachi F-2000 spectrofluorometer. Cell Surface Labeling with Cy3-Crotamine—For binding and co-localization studies, CHO cells were kept at 37 °C in F-12 medium. CHO cells were grown on cover glasses, rinsed with PBS, and incubated with 0.5 μm Cy3-crotamine at 4 °C for 60 min in medium without serum. After washing cells were incubated for additional 60 min at 4 °C with FITC-labeled anti-heparan sulfate antibody (Seikagaku Co., Tokyo, Japan). The fluorescent signal of Cy3-crotamine and FITC-labeled anti-heparan sulfate antibody as well phase contrast micrographs of CHO cells were taken with confocal laser scanning microscope. Also, for flow cytometry analysis CHO cells were harvested in PBS solution containing 5 mm EDTA and incubated with 0.5 μm Cy3-crotamine at 4 °C for 60 min (a condition that prevents endocytosis) followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analyses. Flow cytometry was conducted on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer with a 15-milliwatt, 570-nm, air-cooled argon ion laser and analyzed by the CELLQUEST software (BD Biosciences). Interaction of Cy3-crotamine with the CHO cell surface was determined as the percentage of cells emitting a fluorescent signal in FL2. The boundary between cells that stained positive and negative for Cy3-crotamine was determined according to the fluorescence distribution of positively stained, relative to unstained samples. Cy3-Crotamine Binds Cell Surface HSPGs in CHO-K1 Cells—Cy3-crotamine (0.1–5.0 μm) dissolved in Tyrode’s solution containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin was incubated at 37 °C for 120 min with CHO-K1 cells in the absence or in presence of 10 μm chondroitin sulfate or 10 μm heparin. Thereafter cells were washed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, and the amounts of Cy3-crotamine after cellular uptake were fluorometrically monitored. Also, CHO-K1 cells were preincubated with chondroitinase ABC, heparinase III, or trypsin. Thereafter, the cells were incubated with 2 μm Cy3-crotamine for 120 min at 37 °C, and the amount of Cy3-crotamine bound to the cell was fluorometrically determined. Endocytosis of FITC-Crotamine by CHO Cells—The endocytic compartments of the CHO living cells were labeled with 1 nm Lyso Tracker DND-99 for 30 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, the cells were washed with F-12 medium and incubated with 0.5 μm FITC-crotamine. The fluorescent signal of Lyso-Tracker DND-99 and FITC-crotamine as well as the phase contrast micrographs were monitored at real time with a confocal laser scanning microscope. Intracellular Localization and Cellular Trafficking of Cy3-Crotamine—CHO-K1 cells were preincubated or not with inhibitors of endocytosis, namely 300 μm chloroquine, 20 μm chlorpromazine, 100 μm amiloride, and 10 mm β-d-cyclodextrin at 37 °C for 60 min. Thereafter, the cells were incubated with 2 μm Cy3-crotamine for 120 min at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, the cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, and the amounts of Cy3-crotamine after cellular uptake were fluorometrically monitored. Time-lapse Microscopy—Time-lapse confocal fluorescence images taken under confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 510, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) were used for examining the localization of crotamine early in the endocytic process (5–30 min). For imaging, CHO-K1 cells were grown on cover glasses, and the living cells were labeled with 1 μm Cy3-crotamine and with 1 μm FITC-transferrin in F-12 medium without serum at 37 °C. Confocal images of Cy3-crotamine and FITC-transferrin fluorescence in living CHO-K1 cells were acquired at a 512 × 512-pixel resolution at a rate of 1 image every 5 min. The confocal optical image thickness was of about 1 μm. Lysosomal Leakage Assays—To observe the lysosomotropic properties of crotamine, we have used the AO uptake and relocation methods as described previously (26Robbins E. Marcus P.I. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 18: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). For imaging, CHO cells were grown on cover glasses, and the living cells were labeled with 5 μg/ml AO in F-12 medium without serum for 15 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, the cells were washed with F-12 medium and then exposed to 0.5–5 μm crotamine for different periods at 37 °C. The fluorescent signals of AO were taken with a confocal microscope. Crotamine Binding to Plasmid DNA—The peptide-DNA complexes were formed by mixing 10 μg of crotamine with 2 or 4 μg of the plasmid DNA. In this assay both crotamine in its free form or labeled with the Cy3-fluorescent dye were evaluated. Furthermore, it was observed that 2 μg of the plasmid DNA were sufficient to form a complex with 10 μg of crotamine, indicating a ratio of three DNA phosphates per molecule of crotamine. The peptide-DNA complex formation at the two aforementioned ratios was confirmed by the shift in the electrophoretic mobility of circular DNA in agarose gel (Fig. 1A). A lack or shift of the DNA migration due to the neutralization of nucleic acid negative charge by the cationic peptide and/or due to the formation of large complex between the crotamine and the DNA was observed for both circular and linearized DNA (data not shown). Moreover, CD spectra analysis of both crotamine and plasmid DNA alone or in association revealed that crotamine is able to complex with the plasmid DNA as suggested by the clear difference observed in the obtained spectra of the mixture compared with the theoretically expected profile of the curve obtained by the addition of individual spectra for DNA and crotamine alone (Fig. 1B). In Vitro Gene Transfer Mediated by Crotamine—We have previously shown that Cy3 fluorescent dye-conjugated crotamine selectively penetrates into the nuclei of AP cells (16Kerkis A. Kerkis I. Rádis-Baptista G. Oliveira E.B. Vianna-Morgante A.M. Pereira L.V. Yamane T. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1407-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To verify if crotamine is able to selectively translocate the plasmid DNA into AP cells, mES cells were used in our study. These cells have an unlimited auto-renewal potential and are usually grown onto a feeder layer of mitotically inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which are non-dividing irradiated cells (27Smith A. Embryonic Stem Cells. 2001; (, pp. , Cold Spring Harbor, New York): 205-230Google Scholar). Recently, we also showed that crotamine localization in non-dividing irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts was limited to the cytoplasm not being able to translocate into the nucleus of these cells (3Kerkis A. Hayashi M.A.F. Yamane Y. Kerkis I. IUBMB Life. 2006; 58: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, mES cell culture represents an interesting model that allows for the evaluation of the transfection efficiency of crotamine-plasmid DNA complexes in both AP and non-dividing cells. The AP nature of mES was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis using proliferating cells nuclear antigen antibody (Fig. 2, A and B). For gene transfer crotamine-DNA complexes were diluted in salt solution and incubated with the cells for 6 and 24 h under appropriate culture conditions. A time interval of 6 h was used because in a cell population that is proliferating rapidly and asynchronously, 30–40% of the cells will be in S phase at any moment (28Tang D. Tokumoto Y. Raff M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 971-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), which means that in ∼24 h all AP cells would have progressed through mitosis. After this step, each culture medium was replaced by one without crotamine, and the cells were observed under a confocal microscope 24 h later. Control cultures were incubated with 2 or 4 μg of plasmid DNA alone. Mouse ES cells treated with crotamine-DNA complexes for 6 h showed a strong GFP fluorescent signal in ∼20–30% of cells, indicating a selective pattern of crotamine penetration into the AP cells (Fig. 2, C–E). As expected, no signal was detected in either non-dividing mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (see the asterisk in Fig. 2, C–E) or in control culture cells treated only with the plasmid DNA (data not shown). Moreover, crotamine by itself was not able to induce cell proliferation in the cells used in this work (data not shown). Because the intracellular localization of the fluorescent signal could not be unambiguously ascertained within the islands of mES cells due to their juxtaposed growing, the AP human carcinoma HCT116 cells were also used in further experiments to overcome this limitation. Accordingly, after 24 h of incubation with crotamine-plasmid DNA complex, a strong GFP signal was observed in ∼98% of the HCT116 cells (Fig. 2, F–H), demonstrating a high transfection efficiency of the crotamine-plasmid DNA complex. As expected, the GFP signal was mainly localized in the cytoplasm of transfected cells (Fig. 2, F and H). Furthermore, different cell types, such as murine fibroblasts 3T3 and human mesenchymal and melanoma cells were also efficiently transfected using the crotamine-DNA complexes (data not shown). As a rule, after 6 h of incubation with the complex, a fluorescent signal was observed only in part of the cells (∼20–30%) for all cell lines studied, whereas after 24 h of incubation the majority of the cells (∼98%) were transfected, suggesting a cell cycle-dependent mechanism of transfection. In Vivo Gene Transfer Mediated by Crotamine—To verify if crotamine-plasmid DNA complexes would transfect in vivo, C57Bl/6 mice (n = 20) were injected intraperitoneally with a complex formed by mixing 10 μg of crotamine with 2 μg of the plasmid DNA, thus mimicking one of the conditions used in our in vitro studies. The animals were sacrificed 24 h after intraperitoneal injection of the complex, and the BM cells were immediately isolated and observed under a confocal microscope. A strong fluorescence signal was observed in ∼10–20% of the BM cells (Fig. 3, A–F). We never observed transfection of all BM cells in vivo, probably because of the presence of a high number of non-dividing differentiated cells together with AP precursors (immature stem cells) (29Suda T.

We combined observations of radio emissions and energetic particle streaming with extensive three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic computer simulations of magnetic field draping over the heliopause to show that the plane of the local interstellar field is ∼60° to 90° from the galactic plane. This finding suggests that the field orientation in the Local Interstellar Cloud differs from that of a larger-scale interstellar magnetic field thought to parallel the galactic plane.

However, the conventional autologous chondrocyte implantation is insufficient both in quantity and in quality due to two major limitations: dedifferentiation during a long term culture for multiplication and hypertrophic differentiation by stimulation for the redifferentiation. To overcome the limitations, this study attempted to determine the optimal combination in primary human chondrocyte cultures under a serum-free condition, from among 12 putative chondrocyte regulators. From the exhaustive 212 = 4,096 combinations, 256 were selected by fractional factorial design, and bone morphogenetic protein-2 and insulin (BI) were statistically determined to be the most effective combination causing redifferentiation of the dedifferentiated cells after repeated passaging. We further found that the addition of triiodothyronine (T3) prevented the BI-induced hypertrophic differentiation of redifferentiated chondrocytes via the suppression of Akt signaling. The implant formed by the human chondrocytes cultured in atelocollagen and poly(l-latic acid) scaffold under the BI + T3 stimulation consisted of sufficient hyaline cartilage with mechanical properties comparable with native cartilage after transplantation in nude mice, indicating that BI + T3 is the optimal combination to regenerate a clinically practical permanent cartilage from autologous chondrocytes.

Since cartilage has poor regenerative capacity by itself, its regeneration using a tissue engineering technique may greatly benefit the treatment of various skeletal disorders that cannot be treated by conventional methods. Although tissue-engineered cartilage from autologous chondrocytes is already available for clinical use (1Brittberg M. Lindahl A. Nilsson A. Ohlsson C. Isaksson O. Peterson L. N. Engl. J.

To broaden its clinical indication to major disorders such as osteoarthritic joints, microtia, and cleft lip/palate, cartilaginous matrix should be abundantly produced by a sufficient number of autologous chondrocytes. Since the number of chondrocytes that can be isolated primarily from the native cartilage is limited, it should be markedly increased in culture. However, during their multiplication in culture through repeated passaging, chondrocytes inevitably lose their ability to produce cartilaginous matrix such as glycosaminoglycan (GAG) 2The abbreviations used are: GAG, glycosaminoglycan; COL1, type I collagen; COL2, type II collagen; COL1A1, type I collagen αI chain; COL2A1, type II collagen αI chain; COL10A1, type X collagen αI chain; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; PTH, parathyroid hormone; PTH, PTH-related protein; IL-1RA, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist; T3, l-3,3′,5′-triiodothyronine; T4, l-thyroxin; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PLLA, poly(L-lactic acid); BI, bone morphogenetic protein-2 and insulin; BIT, BI and T3; RT, reverse transcription; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling; TRα, thyroid hormone receptor-α; rh, recombinant human. 2The abbreviations used are: GAG, glycosaminoglycan; COL1, type I collagen; COL2, type II collagen; COL1A1, type I collagen αI chain; COL2A1, type II collagen αI chain; COL10A1, type X collagen αI chain; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; PTH, parathyroid hormone; PTH, PTH-related protein; IL-1RA, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist; T3, l-3,3′,5′-triiodothyronine; T4, l-thyroxin; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PLLA, poly(L-lactic acid); BI, bone morphogenetic protein-2 and insulin; BIT, BI and T3; RT, reverse transcription; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling; TRα, thyroid hormone receptor-α; rh, recombinant human. and type II collagen (COL2) and begin producing type I collagen (COL1), which is called dedifferentiation (4von der Mark K.

Although biochemical factors such as hormones and growth factors are known to stimulate redifferentiation of the dedifferentiated chondrocytes to restore the chondrocytic properties (5Grunder T.

Ogasawara T. Kishimoto J. Liu G. Asato H. Nakatsuka T. Nakamura K. Kawaguchi H. Chung U.I. Takato T. Hoshi K. Cell Transplant. 2005; 14: 683-693Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar) that are known to be potent regulators of proliferation or differentiation of chondrocytes and have already been approved for safe clinical use. We initially determined a combination of two factors among them that most efficiently induce redifferentiation of the dedifferentiated human chondrocytes under a serum-free condition using a statistical method termed “analysis of variance by fractional factorial design” (9Berling T. Runeson P. IEEE Trans. Software Eng. 2003; 29: 769-781Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We then selected a third factor that prevents the redifferentiated chondrocytes from hypertrophic differentiation and investigated the underlying molecular mechanism. Finally, we evaluated the properties of the tissue-engineered cartilage by the selected combination to examine whether it is applicable to clinical use for the treatment of major skeletal disorders.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Isolation and Monolayer Culture—All procedures of the present experiments were approved by the ethics committee of the University of Tokyo Hospital (ethics permission number 622). Both remnant auricular cartilage and costal from one of six microtia patients (10–15 years old) were obtained during surgery in adherence to the Helsinki Principles. Chondrocytes were isolated with digestion using 0.15% collagenase (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). Primary articular chondrocytes were purchased from Sanko Junyaku (Tokyo, Japan). The chondrocytes were seeded in a 100-mm plastic tissue culture dish at a density of 6,400 cells/cm2 and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 containing 5% human serum supplemented with fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2, 100 ng/ml) and insulin (5 μg/ml), as we reported previously (8Takahashi T. Ogasawara T. Kishimoto J. Liu G. Asato H. Nakatsuka T. Nakamura K. Kawaguchi H. Chung U.I. Takato T. Hoshi K. Cell Transplant. 2005; 14: 683-693Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Passaging was performed by trypsin-EDTA solution (Sigma) and repeated until 1000-fold increase of the total cell number.Generation of Cartilage Pellet and Implant—For three-dimensional atelocollagen culture, the dedifferentiated chondrocytes were suspended in 0.8% atelocollagen solution (Kawaken Fine Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan) at a density of 107 cells/ml. The atelocollagen pellets were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Sigma) medium with or without soluble factors for 1–3 weeks. To make the cartilage implant, a 100 μl-atelocollagen aliquot containing 106 chondrocytes was added to a poly(l-latic acid) (PLLA) mesh (kindly provided by Unitika, Tokyo, Japan) (10Ushida T.

Auricular chondrocytes obtained from three different patients (5 × 104 cells in 5 μl of 0.8% atelocollagen gel) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing the combinations for 2 weeks, and the GAG accumulation was measured as described below. Parameter estimates of the GAG accumulation by one factor or two were calculated from the F values that represent the effects of the individual factors and the interaction terms of two factors by the analysis of variance using the software above.Real-time RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from chondrocytes using the chaotropic TRIzol method (Nippongene, Tokyo, Japan). Total mRNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript reverse transcriptase with random hexamer (Takara Shuzo, Shiga, Japan). The full-length or partial-length cDNA of target genes, including PCR amplicon sequences, was amplified by PCR, cloned into pCR-TOPO Zero II or pCR-TOPO II vectors (Invitrogen), and used as standard templates after linearization. QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used, and SYBR Green PCR amplification and real-time fluorescence detection were performed with an ABI 7700 sequence detection system (Foster City, CA). All reactions were run in quadruplicate. Sequences of primers were 5′-CTCCTCGCTTTCCTTCCTCT-3′ and 5′-GTGCTAAAGGTGCCAATGGT-3′ for type I collagen αI chain (COL1A1); 5′-GAGTCAAGGGTGATCGTGGT-3′ and 5′-CACCTTGGTCTCCAGAAGGA-3′ for type II collagen αI chain (COL2A1); 5′-AGGAATGCCTGTGTCTGCTT-3′ and 5′-ACAGGCCTACCCAAACATGA-3′ for type X collagen αI chain (COL10A1); 5′-CAGACCAGCAGCAGCCATA-3′ and 5′-CAGCGTCAACACCATCATTC-3′ for Runx2; 5′-CATGAGCGAGGGCACTCC-3′ and 5′-TCGCTTCAGGTCAGCCTTG-3′ for Sox9; 5′-ATGCAGCGGAGACTGGTTCAG-3′ and 5′-GTCCTTGGAAGGTCTCTGCTG-3′ for PTH/PTHrP receptor; 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTCA-3′ and 5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′ for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.GAG Measurement—The sulfated GAG content was measured using Alcian blue binding assay (Wieslab AB, Lund, Sweden). After digestion of the atelocollagen pellet containing chondrocytes in 0.3% collagenase for 1 h at 37 °C, cell debris and insoluble material were removed by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 30 min. GAG in the supernatant was precipitated with Alcian blue solution, and the sediments by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 15 min were dissolved again in 4 m GuHCl-33% propanol solution. The spectrophotometrical absorbance of the mixture was measured at a wavelength of 600 nm.Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay for Type I and Type II Collagen—The collagen proteins of the pellets, the implants, and the native human auricular cartilage were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a human Type 1 and Type 2 collagen detection kit (Chondrex, Redmond, WA). The pellets, the implants, or the native human auricular cartilage were dissolved in 10 mg/ml pepsin, 0.05 m acetic acid at 4 °C for 48 h and then in 1 mg/ml pancreatic elastase, 0.1 mm Tris, 0.02 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, (pH 7.8–8.0) at 4 °C overnight. The samples were centrifuged at 9,100 × g for 5 min to remove the residue. The collagen proteins were captured by polyclonal anti-human COL1 or COL2 antibodies and detected by biotinylated counterparts and streptavidin peroxidase. O-phenylenediamine and H2O2 were added to the mixture, and the spectrophotometrical absorbance of the mixture was measured at a wavelength of 490 nm.Western Blot Analysis—Human auricular chondrocytes underwent three-dimensional atelocollagen culture with BI (BMP-2 (200 ng/ml) + insulin (5 μg/ml)) in the presence and absence of T3 (100 nm), an Akt inhibitor (1, 10, and 100 ng/ml, Akt inhibitor, 1L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol 2-(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate, EMD Bioscience), or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor SB203580 (10 μm, Sigma) for 5, 10, or 30 min or 24 h. Samples were prepared using M-PER (Pierce Biotechnology) supplemented with Na3VO4 (2 mm), NaF (10 mm), and aprotinin (10 μg/ml). An equal amount (20 μg) of protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Smad1/5/8, phospho-Smad1/5/8, p38 MAPK, phospho-p38 MAPK, Akt, phospho-Akt (all from Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), and actin (Sigma) were used as primary antibodies. The membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Promega, Madison, MI). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK).Histology, Histochemistry, and Fine Structure—The tissue-engineered cartilage was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in OCT compound (Sakura, Tokyo, Japan), and cryosectioned into 10-μm slices. The sections were stained with toluidine blue-O and TUNEL (ApopTag, Intergen, Purchase, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For fluorescent immunohistochemistry, the sections were incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-COL10 antibody (Sigma) and then with biotin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG + IgA + IgM antibodies (Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-streptavidin. The localizations were observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Leica TCS-SL, Wetzler, Germany). For the ultrastructural observation, the specimens were immersed in a mixture of 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde. After postfixation with 1% OsO4, the specimens were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, replaced with propylene oxide, embedded in Poly/Bed 812 resin (Polysciences, Warrington, PA), and sliced into 60–80-nm sections. The sections were observed under a transmission electron microscope (Hitachi H-7100, Tokyo, Japan).Mechanical Properties—Mechanical properties of the pellet and implant were measured using a Venustron tactile sensor (Axiom, Fukushima, Japan). With computer control, the motor-driven sensor unit automatically presses down the objects up to 0.5 mm in depth from the surface and provides the compression strength and the decrease in the resonant frequency. Young's modulus was calculated by the compression strength and the frequency decrease using the software Venus 42 (Axiom), based on a previous report (29Aoyagi R. Yoshida T. Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. 2004; 43: 3204-3209Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Statistical Analysis—All data are expressed as means ± S.E. Means of groups were compared by analysis of variance, and significance of differences was determined by post hoc testing with Bonferroni's method.RESULTSDetermination of the Optimal Combination of Soluble Factors—We attempted to determine the optimal combination of soluble factors for regeneration of permanent cartilage from cultured human chondrocytes that were isolated from remnant auricular cartilage of microtia patients during surgery. To gain a substantial number of cells, the chondrocytes were initially cultured in monolayer with repeated passaging until 1,000-fold increase of the total cell number as we previously reported (8Takahashi T. Ogasawara T. Kishimoto J. Liu G. Asato H. Nakatsuka T. Nakamura K. Kawaguchi H. Chung U.I. Takato T. Hoshi K. Cell Transplant. 2005; 14: 683-693Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which took ∼4 weeks. The dedifferentiated chondrocytes during the monolayer culture were further cultured in an atelocollagen gel in a three-dimensional condition under stimulation by combinations of 12 candidate factors, i.e. BMP-2, insulin, IGF-I, testosterone, PTH, IL-1RA, growth hormone, 17β-estradiol, T3, 1α-25-dihydroxy vitamin D3, FGF-2, and dexamethasone. The redifferentiation was determined by the GAG accumulation. Since exhaustive examination of 212 = 4,096 combinations was impossible, we adopted the fractional factorial design (9Berling T. Runeson P. IEEE Trans. Software Eng. 2003; 29: 769-781Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) for the faultless reduction of the experimental units to a practical number of 256 combinations (see the supplemental table). As a single factor, the statistical analysis revealed that BMP-2, insulin, and IGF-I were the most potent factors of the GAG accumulation (Fig. 1A). Regarding two factors, the combination of BMP-2 and insulin (BI) was shown to provide the most abundant GAG accumulation (Fig. 1A).We then examined expressions of COL1A1, COL2A1, and COL10A1 by real-time RT-PCR in the cultured human auricular chondrocytes just after isolation (Fig. 1B, primary), after the monolayer culture (pre-rediff), and after the three-dimensional atelocollagen culture (Fig. 1B). The long term monolayer culture with repeated passaging led to an increase in COL1A1 and a decrease in COL2A1, confirming the dedifferentiation. The three-dimensional atelocollagen culture thereafter with no stimulation somewhat restored both COL1A1 and COL2A1 expressions, indicating redifferentiation, which was much more enhanced by the BI stimulation. However, BI also increased COL10A1, a marker of chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation, which is a critical defect for the regeneration of permanent cartilage. Thus, we next searched among the other 10 factors for a third factor that not only enhances the COL1 inhibition and the COL2 stimulation by BI but also suppresses the COL10 induction and found that only T3 exhibited significant effects on all parameters. This indicates that T3 is the optimal third factor that enhances the advantage and cancels the disadvantage of BI for regeneration of permanent cartilage from human auricular chondrocytes.When we used cultured chondrocytes from human articular cartilage (Fig. 1C) and human rib cartilage (Fig. 1D), the combination of BI and T3 (BIT) potently suppressed COL1A1 and COL10A1 and enhanced COL2A1 expressions, just as in the case of the human auricular cartilage. This indicates that BIT is universally efficacious for tissue engineering of permanent cartilage from human chondrocytes of various origins.Mechanism Underlying the Preventive Effect of T3 on BI-induced Hypertrophic Differentiation of Redifferentiated Chondrocytes—To clarify the molecular mechanism whereby T3 prevented the BI-induced hypertrophic differentiation of redifferentiated chondrocytes, we examined the involvement of putative signalings that regulate hypertrophic differentiation in the three-dimensional atelocollagen culture of human auricular chondrocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2041471580,"We have cloned human sodium-dependent organic anion transporter (SOAT) cDNA, which consists of 1502 bp and encodes a 377-amino acid protein. SOAT shows 42% sequence identity to the ileal apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter ASBT and 33% sequence identity to the hepatic Na+/taurocholate-cotransporting polypeptide NTCP. Immunoprecipitation of a SOAT-FLAG-tagged protein revealed a glycosylated form at 46 kDa that decreased to 42 kDa after PNGase F treatment. SOAT exhibits a seven-transmembrane domain topology with an outside-to-inside orientation of the N-terminal and C-terminal ends. SOAT mRNA is most highly expressed in testis. Relatively high SOAT expression was also detected in placenta and pancreas. We established a stable SOAT-HEK293 cell line that showed sodium-dependent transport of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, estrone-3-sulfate, and pregnenolone sulfate with apparent Km values of 28.7, 12.0, and 11.3 μm, respectively. Although bile acids, such as taurocholic acid, cholic acid, and chenodeoxycholic acid, were not substrates of SOAT, the sulfoconjugated bile acid taurolithocholic acid-3-sulfate was transported by SOAT-HEK293 cells in a sodium-dependent manner and showed competitive inhibition of SOAT transport with an apparent Ki value of 0.24 μm. Several nonsteroidal organosulfates also strongly inhibited SOAT, including 1-(ω-sulfooxyethyl)pyrene, bromosulfophthalein, 2- and 4-sulfooxymethylpyrene, and α-naphthylsulfate. Among these inhibitors, 2- and 4-sulfooxymethylpyrene were competitive inhibitors of SOAT, with apparent Ki values of 4.3 and 5.5 μm, respectively, and they were also transported by SOAT-HEK293 cells.

SLC10 (solute carrier family 10) is well established as the “sodium bile acid cotransporter family” (1Hagenbuch B. Dawson P. Pflugers Arch. 2003; 447: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The first member of this transporter family, the Na+/taurocholate-cotransporting polypeptide (Ntcp; Slc10a1), was identified in 1990 by expression cloning from rat liver (2Hagenbuch B. Lubbert H. Stieger B. Meier P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5357-5360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is exclusively expressed at the sinusoidal membrane of hepatocytes (3Ananthanarayanan M. Ng O.C. Boyer J.L. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G637-G643PubMed Google Scholar, 4Stieger B. Hagenbuch B. Landmann L. Hochli M. Schroeder A. Meier P.J. Gastroenterology. 1994; 107: 1781-1787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three years later, its intestinal counterpart was cloned from a hamster intestinal cDNA library and was named apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (Asbt; Slc10a2) (5Wong M.H. Oelkers P. Craddock A.L. Dawson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1340-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the basolateral localization of Ntcp, Asbt is highly expressed at the apical brush border membrane of enterocytes of the terminal ileum (6Shneider B.L. Dawson P.A. Christie D.M. Hardikar W. Wong M.H. Suchy F.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 745-754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although sequence identity between NTCP and ASBT is quite low (at 35%), both carriers transport conjugated bile acids with high affinity (7Wong M.H. Oelkers P. Dawson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27228-27234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 8Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. J. Clin.

Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1604-1617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Due to their transport characteristics and expression pattern, NTCP and ASBT are important factors for the maintenance of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids mediating the first step in the cellular uptake of bile acids through the membrane barriers in the liver (NTCP) and intestine (ASBT). Since the bile acid reflux from the intestine is a major negative regulator of the de novo bile acid synthesis from cholesterol in the liver, ASBT is a promising drug target for cholesterol-lowering therapy (12Baringhaus K.H. Matter H. Stengelin S. Kramer W. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2158-2168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, several compounds were able to significantly lower plasma cholesterol levels and prevent atherosclerosis in animal studies, and currently they are being tested in clinical trials (13Kramer W. Glombik H. Curr. Med. Chem. 2006; 13: 997-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Recently, four new members of the SLC10 family were discovered and referred to as SLC10A3, SLC10A4, SLC10A5, and sodium-dependent organic anion transporter (SOAT; SLC10A6) (14Geyer J. Wilke T. Petzinger E. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2006; 372: 413-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). SLC10A3 (P3) was cloned from placenta and teratocarcinoma cDNA libraries in 1988, before NTCP and ASBT had been discovered, and showed broad tissue expression (15Alcalay M. Toniolo D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9527-9543Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The second orphan transporter SLC10A4 seems to be predominantly expressed in the central nervous system and shares a common ancestor gene with NTCP. In contrast, SLC10A5 shows high expression in the liver, kidney, and intestine, which is very similar to the expression pattern of ASBT (14Geyer J. Wilke T. Petzinger E. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2006; 372: 413-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Until now, however, these orphan transporters have not been subjected to intensive experimental expression analysis, and there is no published data indicating that they have any function as solute carriers. Finally, in 2004, we cloned rat Soat, which showed the highest phylogenetic relationship to ASBT but did not transport taurocholate (16Geyer J. Godoy J.R. Petzinger E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 316: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report on the cloning, membrane topology, and expression of human SOAT and also provide its functional characterization in stably transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. Besides sulfoconjugated steroid hormones, SOAT also transports taurolithocholic acid-3-sulfate and sulfoconjugated pyrenes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Chemicals—All of the chemicals, unless otherwise stated, were from Sigma.

[3H]Taurolithocholic acid-3-sulfate ([3H]TLCS, 24.1 Ci/mmol) was generously donated by Werner Kramer (Sanofi-Aventis, Frankfurt am Main, Germany).Cloning of Human SOAT cDNA—Using BLAST searches of the human genome with the cDNA sequences of the six coding exons of rat Soat (Slc10a6) (GenBank™ accession number AJ583503), we obtained matches with six genomic sequence fragments on human chromosome 4q21. These sequences were used for an RT-PCR-based strategy to obtain the full open reading frame cDNA sequence of human SOAT. The following oligonucleotide primers were designed, including SacII/XbaI restriction sites for PCR amplification: forward primer, 5′-atg acc gcg gat gag agc caa ttg ttc cag cag ctc-3′; reverse primer, 5′-cgt cta gac tat tcg cat gaa gtg atg tgg cca act g-3′. Although it has a relatively low expression in this organ (see below), human SOAT was initially cloned from the adrenal gland. RT-PCR was performed from 1 μg of human adrenal gland poly(A)+ RNA (BD Clontech) using the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Applied Science) according to the following thermocycling conditions: one cycle of 94 °C for 2 min; 10 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 56 °C for 15 s minus 0.5 °C each cycle, and 72 °C for 1 min; 30 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 51 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 1 min plus 5 s each cycle; and final extension of 72 °C for 10 min. After the amplification reaction, samples were held at 4 °C until analysis. An aliquot of the PCR product was electrophoresed on an agarose gel. The amplicon of 1152 bp was excised form the gel and digested for 90 min at 37 °C with SacII and XbaI. In order to obtain a SOAT-pBluescript plasmid, the sticky ended SOAT cDNA fragment was directionally ligated downstream from a T3 promoter into the pBluescript vector (Stratagene), which was predigested with the respective restriction enzymes (SacII and XbaI). Three different clones were sequenced on both strands, and the cDNA sequence was deposited in the GenBank™ data base under GenBank™ accession number AJ583502. In order to confirm transcription of the full-length SOAT mRNA sequence also on organs with high SOAT expression (i.e. testis, placenta, and pancreas) (see below), RT-PCR was also performed on human testis, placenta, and pancreas cDNAs (BD Clontech) as described above, and PCR fragments were verified by DNA sequencing. To confirm transport activity of human SOAT, the SOAT-pBluescript plasmid was used for transport experiments with [3H]DHEAS and [3H]E1Sin Xenopus laevis oocytes as described in detail previously (16Geyer J. Godoy J.R. Petzinger E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 316: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Identification of SOAT cDNA Ends by Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE)-PCR—In order to obtain the full-length SOAT mRNA transcript, we employed the GeneRacer method based on RNA ligase-mediated and oligonucleotide-capping RACE according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription of 1 μg of testis RNA (BD Clontech) was performed with the GeneRacer Oligo dT Primer 5′-gct gtc aac gat acg cta cgt aac ggc atg aca gtg t24-3′ in a volume of 20 μl using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Initial 3′- and 5′-RACE reactions were performed using the gene-specific primers 5′-ggc agc tcc tcc tct gaa ctg ttg-3′ for 5′-RACE amplification and 5′-aat tac cct tgt gtg cct gac cat tc-3′ for 3′-RACE amplification. For each 50-μl reaction, 1 μl of cDNA, 0.5 μl of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems), and 6 μl of MgCl2 (25 mm) were used, and amplification was performed under the following thermocycling conditions: 1 cycle of 95 °C for 5 min; five cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 1 min; 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 70 °C for 1 min; 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min; and a final extension of 72 °C for 10 min. To increase the yield and specificity of the RACE products, additional nested PCR was performed using the nested primers 5′-gct gag ctg ctg gaa caa ttg gct c-3′ for the nested 5′-RACE reaction and 5′-cct gtg gcc ttt ggt gtc tat gtg-3′ for the nested 3′-RACE reaction under the following conditions: one cycle of 95 °C for 5 min; 10 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 70 °C for 30 s minus 0.5 °C each cycle, and 72 °C for 1 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min; and a final extension of 72 °C for 10 min. 3′- and 5′-RACE fragments were gel-purified and cloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Three individual clones were sequenced on both strands for each PCR fragment.Establishment of the SOAT-HEK293 Cell Line—The recombinant human cell line T-REx SOAT-HEK293 was made using the Flp-In expression system and the commercially available Flp-In T-REx 293 host cell line according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Flp-In T-REx 293 cells contain a single, stably integrated Flp recombinase target (FRT) site at a transcriptionally active genomic locus, which is maintained by selection for zeocin resistance and ensures high level gene expression from a target-integrated Flp-In expression vector. Briefly, SOAT cDNA spanning the whole open reading frame was subcloned from SOAT-pBluescript vector into the Flp-In pcDNA5/FRT/TO expression vector carrying the FRT site and the hygromycin resistance gene (Invitrogen). In the generated vector, further referred to as SOAT-pcDNA5, SOAT cDNA is under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter and the tetracycline operator sequences (tetO2). In addition to the FRT site, Flp-In T-REx 293 cells stably express the tetracycline repressor, which is maintained by selection for blasticidin resistance. In the absence of tetracycline, tetracycline repressor effectively binds to the tetO2 sequence and blocks SOAT transcription from the cytomegalovirus promoter. In order to establish the SOAT-HEK293 cell line, the SOAT-pcDNA5 construct was cotransfected with the Flp recombinase expression vector pOG44 into Flp-In T-REx 293 host cells by Fugene 6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science). Upon cotransfection, the SOAT coding sequence was integrated into the genome of the Flp-In HEK293 cells via Flp recombinase-mediated homologous recombination at the FRT site. Stable clones containing the SOAT open reading frame sequence under control of the cytomegalovirus/tetO2 hybrid promoter were selected by culturing in selective medium containing 150 μg/ml hygromycin and 50 μg/ml blasticidin. After 10–14 days, single clones were isolated from the remaining cell pool using cloning cylinders and tested for sodium-dependent [3H]DHEAS transport. The best transporting cell clone (further referred to as SOAT-HEK293) was selected and used for further experiments. SOAT-HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM/F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), l-glutamine (4 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (further referred to as standard medium) at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity.Transport Studies in SOAT-HEK293 Cells—For transport studies, 12-well plates were coated with poly-d-lysine for better attachment of the cells. 1.25 × 105 cells/well were plated and grown under standard medium for 72 h. SOAT expression was induced by preincubation with tetracycline (1 μg/ml). SOAT-nonexpressing control cells (Flp-In HEK293 cells) were not pretreated with tetracycline. Before starting the transport experiments, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 7.3 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, 37 °C) and preincubated with sodium transport buffer containing 142.9 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4. When transport assays were performed in sodium-free transport buffer, sodium chloride was substituted with equimolar concentrations of choline chloride. To determine the ion selectivity of SOAT transport, sodium chloride in the transport buffer was also substituted with equimolar concentrations of lithium chloride, potassium chloride, N-methyl-d-glucamine, sodium gluconate, and potassium gluconate. Uptake experiments were initiated by replacing the preincubation buffer by 500 μl of transport buffer containing the radiolabeled test compound and were performed at 37 °C. For inhibition studies, SOAT-HEK293 cells were preincubated with transport buffer containing the inhibitor compound for 30 s. Then transport measurements were started by adding the radiolabeled substrate at 37 °C. Transport and inhibition assays were terminated by removing the transport buffer and washing five times with ice-cold PBS. Cell monolayers were lysed in 1 n NaOH with 0.1% SDS, and the cell-associated radioactivity was determined in a liquid scintillation counter. The protein content was determined according to Lowry using aliquots of the lysed cells with bovine serum albumin as a standard (19Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Uptake Studies with 2-SMP and 4-SMP—Cells were seeded in 24-well plates (2 × 105 cells in 1 ml of medium/well) 2 days before the experiment started. SOAT-HEK293 cells were incubated in Ringer's solution (130 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm NaH2PO4, and 18 mm glucose, pH 7.4) or an equimolar solution in which sodium was replaced by choline in the presence of 10 μm 2-SMP or 4-SMP for 15 min at 37 °C. After aspiration of the transport solution and three washes with ice-cold Ringer's solution, cells were lysed with 0.25 ml of 1 n NaOH. After neutralization with 0.25 ml of 1 n HCl and protein precipitation with 1 ml of acetone, aliquots (usually 10 μl) of the supernatant were injected into HPLC using a Shimadzu SIL-M10 Avp autosampler. Samples were separated using a Shimadzu SLC-10 Avp delivery system equipped with a Phenomenex Gemini C18 column (250 × 3 mm; 5 μm). The eluent was methanol containing 20% water and 0.05% triethylamine (v/v). The flow rate was 0.2 ml/min. 2-SMP and 4-SMP were quantified from the fluorescence signal (λex 334 nm, λem 392 nm) using a Shimadzu SPD-M10 Avp detector.Expression of SOAT-FLAG-tagged and ASBT-FLAG-tagged Proteins—A FLAG-tagged SOAT protein was generated by insertion of the FLAG-peptide (DYKDDDDK) to the C-terminal end of SOAT by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) of the SOAT-pcDNA5 construct. The following oligonucleotide sense and antisense primers were used: 5′-cat cac ttc atg cga aga tta caa gga tga cga cga taa gta ggc ggc cgc tcg agt cta g-3′ sense and 5′-cta gac tcg agc ggc cgc cta ctt atc gtc gtc atc ctt gta atc ttc gca tga agt gat g-3′ antisense. Correct clones were selected by DNA sequencing. Furthermore, an ASBT-FLAG fusion protein was generated for comparative analysis. Briefly, the full open reading frame of human ASBT was amplified by RT-PCR from 1 μg of small intestine poly(A)+ RNA (BD Clontech). Gene-specific oligonucleotide primers were used containing SacII/XbaI restriction sites (5′-cca gcc gcg gac cca gca atg aat g-3′ forward and 5′-gtc ctc tag atg tct act ttt cgt cag gtt g-3′ reverse), and PCR amplification was performed using the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Applied Science) according to the following touchdown schedule: 1 cycle of 94 °C for 2 min; 10 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 65 °C for 30 s minus 0.5 °C each cycle, and 72 °C for 1 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min plus 10 s each cycle. The PCR product of the expected size was gel-purified and digested for 90 min at 37 °C with SacII and XbaI. The sticky ended cDNA fragment was directionally ligated downstream from a T3 promoter into the pBluescript vector (Stratagene), which was predigested with SacII and XbaI. Sequence verification was done according to the reference sequence with GenBank™ accession number NM_000452. Transport activity of ASBT was confirmed by transport experiments in X. laevis oocytes with [3H]taurocholic acid as the test compound (see above). For transfection of Flp-In HEK293 cells, the ASBT open reading frame sequence was subcloned into the Flp-In pcDNA5/FRT/TO expression vector, and the FLAG epitope was inserted at the C-terminal end of ASBT by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis as described above for SOAT. The following oligonucleotide primers were used: 5′-caa cct gac gaa aag gat tac aag gat gac gac gat aag tag aca tct cga gtc-3′ sense and 5′-gac tcg aga tgt cta ctt atc gtc gtc atc ctt gta atc ctt ttc gtc agg ttg-3′ antisense. The SOAT-FLAG-pcDNA5 and ASBT-FLAG-pcDNA5 constructs were verified by DNA sequencing, and positive clones were used for further experiments.Immunoprecipitation and Deglycosylation of the FLAG-tagged Proteins—Flp-In T-REx 293 cells were seeded in 6-well plates coated with poly-d-lysine at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells/well in antibiotic-free DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 4 mml-glutamine. On the following day, the cells were transfected with 4 μgof SOAT-FLAG-pcDNA5 and ASBT-FLAG-pcDNA5 vector DNA or with 4 μg of pcDNA5 alone (control) by Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). After 4 h, the medium was changed to standard medium, and expression of the FLAG-tagged proteins was induced by tetracycline treatment (1 μg/ml). On the next day, the cells were washed with PBS and starved in methionine-free and cysteine-free DMEM medium (Sigma) supplemented with 4 mm l-glutamine and 1 μg/ml tetracycline for 1 h. Subsequently, 70 μCi of l-[35S] in vitro cell labeling mix (Amersham Biosciences) was added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 6 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity. The cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and incubated in 500 μl of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholic acid, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) for 5 min under shaking. Cell lysates were transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and incubated for an additional 30 min under rotation at 4 °C. To remove any cell debris, the samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube. Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubation with 5 μg of the monoclonal mouse anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) under rotation for 1 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma; 25% suspension in radioimmune precipitation buffer) was added, and samples were incubated under rotation. After 1 h, Sepharose beads were precipitated by centrifugation and washed three times with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer. For deglycosylation with PNGase F, the protein A-Sepharose beads were resuspended in 1× glycoprotein denaturation buffer and boiled for 10 min, and the eluted proteins were incubated overnight at 37 °C with 1000 units of PNGase F in 1× G7 reaction buffer supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40 (New England Biolabs). Nondeglycosylated samples were equally processed but not incubated with PNGase F. All samples were mixed with the same amount of 2× Laemmli buffer containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 10 min. Finally, deglycosylated and nondeglycosylated samples were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. The gel was fixed in 30% methanol, 10% acetic acid (v/v) for 30 min and soaked in Amplify Fluorographic reagent (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min. Dried gels were exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. BioMax MR film (Sigma) at -80 °C.Antibody Preparation—The SOAT-(2–17) antibody was raised in rabbits against amino acid residues 2–17 of the deduced SOAT sequence (RANCSSSSACPANSSE). The synthetic peptide was coupled via the carboxyl-terminal glutamic acid residue to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used to immunize two rabbits (Eurogentec). Antigenicity of the rabbit serum was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis using the synthetic peptide as the antigen. A second SOAT-(349–364) antibody was raised against amino acid residues 349–364 at the C terminus of SOAT. However, this antibody showed no immunoreactivity against the synthetic peptide in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments and was not applicable (Eurogentec).Immunofluorescence Microscopy of SOAT-HEK293 Cells—SOAT-HEK293 cells were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips to ∼80% confluence in standard medium. SOAT expression was induced by tetracycline treatment (1 μg/ml) for at least 24 h. Noninduced control cells were equally processed but were not incubated with tetracycline. On the next day, cells were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with the SOAT-(2–17) rabbit antibody (1:10) for 1 h at room temperature without paraformaldehyde treatment. After rinsing and three times washing with PBS, the cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody at 1:200 dilution (Sigma). After a final washing procedure, the cells were covered with a DAPI/methanol solution containing 1 μg/ml DAPI and incubated for 5 min at 8 °C. The cells were washed with methanol/acetone (1:1), air-dried, and mounted on slides with Mowiol mounting medium. Fluorescence imaging was performed on a Leica DM6000B fluorescence microscope. Captured files were analyzed with the Leica FW4000 fluorescence work station software.Immunofluorescence Microscopy of SOAT-FLAG-transfected HEK293 Cells—For transient transfection, Flp-In HEK293 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/well on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips and grown to ∼80% confluence in antibiotic-free DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 4 mml-glutamine. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of SOAT-FLAG-pcDNA5 vector DNA by Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). The parental pcDNA5 vector lacking any insert was used as control. After 4 h, the medium was changed to standard medium, and the transfected cells were induced by tetracycline (1 μg/ml) for at least 24 h. After fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at 4 °C, the cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with 20 mm glycine in PBS for 5 min. Subsequently, the cells were permeabilized for 5 min in PBT buffer (PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 20 mm glycine). Nonpermeabilized cells were not treated with PBT and were used for outside epitope localization. The cells were placed in blocking solution PBSG (1% bovine serum albumin and 4% normal goat serum in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature and incubated with the rabbit anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) at a 1:40,000 dilution in PBSG overnight at 4 °C. The cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with the goat Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch) at 1:800 in PBSG for 1 h at room temperature. After triple washing with PBS, nuclei were stained by incubation with a DAPI/methanol solution containing 0.2 μg/ml DAPI for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were washed with methanol, air-dried, and mounted on slides with Mowiol mounting medium. Fluorescence imaging was performed as described above.Real Time Quantitative PCR—Relative SOAT expression analysis was performed with ABI PRISM 7300 technology using human multiple tissue cDNA panels (BD Clontech) and cDNA synthesized from human adrenal gland and human mammary gland RNAs (BD Clontech). PCR amplification was achieved with TaqMan Gene Expression Assays Hs01399354_m1 for human SOAT"

https://openalex.org/W1974928146,"Elements in the alkali metal series are regarded as unlikely superconductors because of their monovalent character. A superconducting transition temperature as high as 20 K, recently found in compressed lithium (the lightest alkali element), probably arises from pressure-induced changes in the conduction-electron band structure. Superconductivity at ambient pressure in lithium has hitherto remained unresolved, both theoretically and experimentally. Here we demonstrate that lithium is a superconductor at ambient pressure with a transition temperature of 0.4 mK. As lithium has a particularly simple conduction electron system, it represents an important case for any attempts to classify superconductors and transition temperatures, especially to determine if any non-magnetic configuration can exclude superconductivity down to zero temperature. Furthermore, the combination of extremely weak superconductivity and relatively strong nuclear magnetism in lithium would clearly lead to mutual competition between these two ordering phenomena under suitably prepared conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1983170615,"Angiogenesis involves the assembly of endothelial cells into capillaries from a pre-existing vasculature. Because abnormal angiogenesis is a hallmark of many cancers, it is critical to find factors that control this process. Endothelial cells are enriched in the anthrax receptor; we therefore determined the effect of anthrax edema toxin (ET), an adenylyl cyclase, on chemotaxis. cAMP generated by ET does not block proliferation or survival but causes cytoskeletal changes and inhibits chemotaxis by primary human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs). These effects are due to the action of a downstream cAMP effector, Epac, a guanine nucleotide exchange-activating protein for Rap1 (RAP1-GEF). ET induces transcription of Epac-related activators of Rap1, Epac2 (RapGEF4), and MR-GEF/RapGEF5. Similar to ET, activated Epac or Rap1 induces cytoskeletal changes and blocks chemotaxis in human endothelial cells.

Angiogenesis, the generation of new blood vessels from previously formed blood vessels, is a process that is critical for normal development and tissue maintenance (reviewed in Ref. 1Gupta K. Zhang J. Postgrad. Med. J. 2005; 81: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Excessive angiogenesis can lead to a variety of disease states, including blindness, rheumatoid arthritis, AIDS complications, psoriasis, and cancer. Conversely, insufficient angiogenesis can cause strokes, heart disease, ulcers, scleroderma, and infertility. Angiogenesis occurs through a discrete series of events including proliferation of endothelial cells and chemotaxis toward pro-angiogenic signals such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). 4The abbreviations and trivial names used are: VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; EF, edema factor; Epac, exchange protein directly activated by cAMP; ET, edema toxin; GAP, GTPase activating protein; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; PA, protective antigen; PKA, protein kinase A; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HMVEC, human microvascular endothelial cell; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; HA, hemagglutinin; IBMX, isobutylmethylxanthine; BSA, bovine serum albumin; 8CPT-2Me-cAMP, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-2′-O-methyl-cAMP; 6-Bnz-cAMP, N6-benzoyladenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate. Identification of the signaling mechanisms that regulate these processes is critical for our understanding of angiogenesis. Bacterial toxins have evolved to effectively co-opt host cell regulatory functions and have thereby become important pharmacologic tools for probing or targeting eukaryotic signal transduction pathways. Bacillus anthracis is a particularly hardy and deadly spore-forming, Gram-positive bacterium that causes anthrax. Rapidly growing anthrax bacteria secrete three factors, edema factor (EF), lethal factor, and protective antigen (PA), which cause extensive tissue damage. EF is a potent calcium- and calmodulin-dependent adenylyl cyclase that generates cAMP from cellular ATP (2Leppla S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3162-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Lethal factor, a Zn2+-dependent metalloprotease (3Klimpel K.R. Arora N. Leppla S.H. Mol.

Resau J. Webb C.P. Koochekpour S. Koo H.M. Leppla S.H. Vande Woude G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4089-4094Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 10Kirby J.E. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 430-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether anthrax edema toxin (ET) similarly acts to suppress the angiogenic process. Edema toxin raises intracellular levels of cAMP, a second messenger that has multiple signaling targets. These include protein kinase A (PKA), cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels, and Epac (11de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rap1. Rap1 is a member of the Ras GTPase family of signaling proteins that is converted from inactive GDP-bound states to active GTP-bound states by GEFs (reviewed in Ref. 12Quilliam L.A. Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 391-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Epac has been implicated in a variety of signaling cascades as an activator of Rap1 (reviewed in Ref. 13Bos J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The functions of these cascades include modulation of integrins associated with the actin cytoskeleton, promotion of cell junction formation by cadherins, and regulation of actin dynamics. To understand the pathologic consequences of edema toxin for the endothelium at the molecular level and to realize the potential of edema toxin as a pharmacologic tool, we examined the effect of edema toxin on human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs). Our results show that ET or its downstream effectors Epac and Rap1 can induce cytoskeletal changes and inhibit chemotaxis in primary human microvascular endothelial cells.

Assay of Cellular cAMP—HMVECs were seeded at 0.6 × 105 cells/plate in 35-mm plates. Two days later, cells were treated with or without ET for the indicated times and lysed with 300 μl of 0.1 n HCl. 50 μl of the lysates were applied for measurement of cAMP using the Assay Designs direct cAMP assay kit, non-acetylated version (Ann Arbor, MI). The cAMP level in cells treated with ET for 24 h is a lower limit. Actin Stress Fiber Staining—HMVECs were seeded directly on 35-mm plates at 30% confluence the day before treatment and starved in 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA).

Endothelial Cell Migration Assay—The endothelial cell migration assay was performed as previously described (19Lingen M.W. Methods Mol. Med. 2003; 78: 337-347PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HMVECs were starved overnight in medium containing 0.1% BSA, harvested, resuspended into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1% BSA, plated on the bottom side of a modified Boyden chamber (Nucleopore Corporation, MD), and allowed to attach in the inverted chamber for 2 h at 37°C. The chamber was then reinverted, test substances added to the wells of the upper chamber, and cells were allowed to migrate for 4 h at 37°C. Membranes were recovered, fixed, and stained and the number of cells that had migrated to the upper chamber/10 high power fields counted. Data is reported as the number of cells migrated/10 high power fields (400×). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 0.1% BSA served as a negative control, and VEGF was used as a positive control at a concentration of 100 pg/ml.

Rap1 Pulldown Assays—HMVECs were grown to subconfluency in 100-mm plates, starved in EBM2 medium plus 0.1% BSA overnight, and treated as indicated. Rap1 pulldown assays were performed by using glutathione S-transferase-RalGDS-Ras-binding domain (RBD) beads as described previously (23Cullere X. Shaw S.K. Andersson L. Hirahashi J. Luscinskas F.W. Mayadas T.N. Blood. 2005; 105: 1950-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon test. Initially, we determined whether ET, comprising EF and PA, was effectively taken up by endothelial cells and caused physiological changes. Consistent with the role of EF as an adenylyl cyclase, treatment of HMVECs with ET resulted in the rapid intracellular accumulation of cAMP that more than doubled by 1 day following treatment (Fig. 1A). Examination of HMVEC morphology revealed a dramatic change in shape from the normal oval morphology to a flattened morphology (Fig. 1B, upper panels). Similar results were observed upon treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with ET (data not shown). This change in morphology and the underlying actin cytoskeleton is more clearly illustrated by staining actin in ET-treated versus untreated HMVECs with Alexa Fluor 594-labeled phalloidin (Fig. 1B, lower panels). To quantitate the morphologic change, we measured the perimeter to area ratio that decreases with cell spreading (Fig. 1B) (18Reinhart-King C.A. Dembo M. Hammer D.A. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 676-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that EF can induce significant morphological and cytoskeletal changes in vascular endothelial cells. Anthrax Edema Toxin Inhibits Chemotaxis but Not Cell Proliferation in Vascular Endothelial Cells—Given that cAMP is well known for its anti-proliferative effects, the possibility of cell growth blockage was analyzed utilizing a cell proliferation assay. Not only was there no suppression of cell growth, but ET actually appeared to enhance cellular proliferation at a low but statistically significant level (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that the changes in cell shape do not inhibit growth rate. Following stimulation by pro-angiogenic factors, endothelial cells undergo dramatic morphological changes, including sprouting, migration, and differentiation into hollow tubes (reviewed in Ref. 24Ribatti D. Br. J. Haematol. 2005; 128: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). As an in vitro measure of chemotactic migration, HMVECs were placed in a Boyden chamber, and the number of cells that migrated toward a VEGF stimulus were quantitated. When cells were pretreated with ET, the number of cells that underwent VEGF-induced migration decreased in a dose-dependent manner with an ID50 value of 0.07 μg/ml EF (Fig. 1D). All modes of migration were not inhibited by ET, however, as the fraction of cells migrating in the absence of VEGF was the same independent of ET treatment. EF or PA alone did not inhibit VEGF-mediated chemotaxis (Fig. 1E). Thus, ET specifically inhibits the chemotactic response of the endothelial cells to VEGF. Anthrax Edema Toxin Induces Expression of Rap GEFs—To determine what genes might be involved in mediating the ET effect on VEGF-activated endothelial cell migration, RNA was isolated from HMVECs that were either left untreated, stimulated with VEGF, or stimulated with VEGF in the presence of ET. Because the effects on chemotaxis could be observed by 4 h of ET treatment, we analyzed RNA from cells after treatment for the same 4-h time period. Analysis of the expressed transcripts using oligonucleotide arrays revealed a number of genes whose expression was altered by ET. Most of these changes involved suppression of expression of genes known to be VEGF-induced (data not shown). However, there were a few examples of genes that were induced specifically by ET. Two in particular are of interest (Fig. 2A), because they code for guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rap1. The cAMP-dependent RapGEF4 (also called Epac2) (25de Rooij J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20829-20836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and the cAMP-independent RapGEF5/MR-GEF (26Ichiba T. Hoshi Y. Eto Y. Tajima N. Kuraishi Y. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 27Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34901-34908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) transcripts were induced 3–7-fold by ET, as assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (Fig. 2B). This induction was not dependent on the presence of VEGF, as ET alone induced expression of RapGEF4 and RapGEF5. Quantitation of protein expression was not possible due to lack of suitable antibodies (data not shown). Stimulation with a selective agonist for Epac, 8CPT-2Me-cAMP, did not induce expression of these genes (Fig. 2C), indicating that the induction of RapGEF4 and Raf-GEF5 was mediated by ET but not via Epac/Rap1. This induction was not a generalized effect, as no similar enhancement of RapGEF3 (Epac1) transcription was observed. Because RapGEFs activate Rap isoforms, these results suggest that cAMP generated by the cells in response to ET not only activates RapGEF proteins directly but also induces expression of RapGEFs, thereby amplifying the activity of Rap1. Activated Epac Causes Morphological Changes and Inhibits Chemotaxis in Microvascular Endothelial Cells—Because ET can both activate and induce GEFs for Rap1, such as Epac2, we investigated whether selective activation of Epac could mimic the effects on endothelial cells elicited by ET. To confirm that cAMP was the mediator of the ET effects, we first treated HMVECs with forskolin plus a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (IBMX) to induce endogenous adenylyl cyclase activity. As observed in Fig. 1B, the endothelial cells also flattened in response to cAMP generation, and this effect could indeed be mimicked by treatment of cells with the Epac activator 8CPT-2Me-cAMP (28Enserink J.M. Christensen A.E. de Rooij J. van Triest M. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Doskeland S.O. Blank J.L. Bos J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 29Rehmann H.

Similarly, staining of actin filaments in the HMVECs with Alexa Fluor 594-labeled phalloidin after treatment with 8CPT-2Me-cAMP more clearly depicted these cytoskeletal changes (Fig. 1B). Because endothelial cell migration toward chemotactic factors is a key feature of angiogenesis, we determined whether Epac activation similarly blocks chemotaxis. 8CPT-2Me-cAMP inhibited VEGF-stimulated HMVEC migration with an ID50 of 0.2 μm with complete inhibition at 2.5 μm (Fig. 2D). Again, no suppression of nonspecific cell migration was observed. In contrast, treatment of HMVECs with 6-benzoyl cAMP, a selective activator of PKA, had no effect on endothelial cell migration (Fig. 2E). If PKA mediates the inhibition of chemotaxis, then PKA inhibitors should rescue the 8CPT-2Me-cAMP-mediated phenotype. Therefore, to address this possibility, we also tested the effect of two PKA inhibitors, a cell-permeable myristoylated PKA inhibitor peptide mPKi or the chemical inhibitor H89, on ET-mediated inhibition of chemotaxis (Fig. 1E). Although both the myristoylated PKA inhibitor peptide and H89 inhibited chemotaxis to some degree in the absence of ET, neither PKA inhibitor was able to rescue the inhibition of chemotaxis by ET. Presumably the inhibition by H89 reflects its inhibition of Rho kinase (30Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar), a kinase required for endothelial cell chemotaxis (data not shown). These results indicate that specific Epac activation (but not PKA) can mimic ET-induced suppression of VEGF-induced chemotaxis. Rap1 Is Activated by ET and 8CPT-2Me-cAMP—If ET and 8CPT-2Me-cAMP promote these cell adhesion-related effects by activation of a Rap1 GEF, then both of these agents should stimulate Rap1 in HMVECs. The Epac activator 8CPT-2Me-cAMP is a robust stimulator of Rap1 as shown by the pulldown assay for GTP-bound Rap1 (Fig. 3A). Stimulation with ET at a concentration that blocks chemotaxis in HMVECs also induces Rap1 activation that is maintained for at least 30 min. Conversely, 6-Bnz-cAMP was not able to activate Rap1, whereas forskolin caused a significant activation of Rap1 (Fig. 3B). To confirm that the Epac activator was not stimulating PKA, we analyzed a substrate of PKA, phosphorylated CREB, in the treated cells. In contrast to forskolin, which robustly stimulated CREB phosphorylation, the 8CPT-2Me-cAMP activator of Epac did not induce significant CREB phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that Rap1 activation can account for the observed physiological effects of ET and 8CPT-2Me-cAMP on vascular endothelial cells. Constitutively Activated Rap1 Blocks Chemotaxis—The previous results suggest that inhibition of chemotaxis is mediated by Epac rather than by PKA or other downstream effectors of cAMP. To test whether activated Rap1 is indeed sufficient to inhibit chemotaxis, HMVECs were transduced with a lentivirus expressing the activated Rap1A63E mutant as well as a GFP marker. Over 95% of the cells expressed GFP by 3 days as assessed by fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry (data not shown), and the exogenous Rap1 was readily detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 4A). The Rap1-expressing cells also exhibited cell spreading and actin changes (Fig. 4B) Measurement of the perimeter to area ratio in Rap1-expressing cells showed a significant decrease, similar to that seen in cells treated with 8CPT-2Me-cAMP (Fig. 4C). Analysis of the mutant Rap1-expressing HMVECs in a chemotaxis assay showed a potent suppression of VEGF-induced chemotaxis (Fig. 4D). To assess the requirement for Rap1 in 8CPT-2Me-cAMP action, we also transduced cells with lentivirus-expressing Rap1GAP. Consistent with previous results, cells expressing Rap1GAP rounded up (Fig. 4B); however, robust Rap1GAP expression caused loss of matrix attachment, preventing further analysis (data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate that Rap1 is sufficient to suppress VEGF-induced chemotaxis in HMVECs and implicates Rap1 in the morphological changes induced by Epac activators. The results we have obtained indicate that treatment of endothelial cells with either edema toxin, an adenylyl cyclase, or activators of Epac, a GEF for Rap1, causes cytoskeletal changes and inhibition of VEGF-induced chemotaxis in response to angiogenic factors in human microvascular endothelial cells. We have further demonstrated that activated Epac and Rap1 are effective inhibitors of endothelial cell chemotaxis. The link between ET and Epac is strengthened not only by the fact that Epac is activated by cAMP, the only known product of ET, but also because ET rapidly induces an increase in the transcription of Rap1GEFs, thereby amplifying the signaling through Rap1. These results identify Epac and Rap1 as central mediators of vascular endothelial cell chemotaxis. The ability of Epac activators to block chemotaxis is consistent with the role of Rap1 in regulating cellular adhesion and spreading processes. The results of our chemotaxis assays in HMVECs indicate that Rap1 activation does not inhibit the process of migration per se but instead prevents directed movement toward the angiogenic attractant VEGF. These results contrast with a recent study demonstrating that Rap1 activation via the Rap1-associating molecule RapL is required for directed migration and wound healing in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human aortic endothelial cells (31Fukuhara S. Sakurai A. Sano H. Yamagishi A. Somekawa S. Takakura N. Saito Y. Kangawa K. Mochizuki N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The difference in these results may be due to the different chemoattractants (VEGF versus factors released by wounding in culture) that are reflective of these two different processes as well as the specific cells used. However, it should be noted that the cytoskeletal changes we observed in HMVECs upon treatment with ET or 8CPT-2Me-cAMP were also observed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (Refs. 23Cullere X.

Takakura N. Saito Y. Kangawa K. Mochizuki N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar and data not shown). Furthermore, we did not detect apoptotic induction by 0.3 mm 8CPT-2Me-cAMP in endothelial cells even in low serum conditions (data not shown), in contrast to some anti-angiogenic agents such as anthrax lethal toxin (9Duesbery N.S. Resau J. Webb C.P. Koochekpour S. Koo H.M. Leppla S.H. Vande Woude G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4089-4094Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 10Kirby J.E. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 430-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and thrombospondin-1 (32Volpert O.V. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2000; 19: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 33Nor J.E.

Activation of the Epac/Rap1 pathway does not appear to inhibit VEGF signaling by inhibiting its receptor. Results from our laboratory have demonstrated that VEGF-mediated phosphorylation of ERK1,2 is not blocked by activation of Epac/Rap1. 5R. C. Doebele, F. Schulze-Hoepfner, J. Hong, M. W. Lingen, B. Zeitlin, J. E. Nor, Y. Liu, M. Abe, O. Volpert, and M. R. Rosner, manuscript in preparation. Thus, the inhibitory effects of ET and Epac on vascular endothelial cells appear to be related to cytoskeletal-based processes such as cellular morphology and migration rather than proliferation and cell survival. The Epac activator appeared to be a more potent inhibitor of chemotaxis than constitutively activated Rap1. Possible explanations relate to the cellular localization of Rap1 and the specific cell type. A recent study by Scott and co-workers identified a complex linking Epac and Rap1 to A-kinase anchoring proteins in muscle cells, and the AKAP acted as a scaffold that bound other interacting signaling molecules such as PKA and cAMP phosphodiesterase (34Dodge-Kafka K.L. Soughayer J. Pare G.C. Carlisle Michel J.J. Langeberg L.K. Kapiloff M.S. Scott J.D. Nature. 2005; 437: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The localization of Epac2 can also influence its ability to activate specific pools of Rap1 (35Li Y. Asuri S. Rebhun J.F. Castro A.F. Paranavitana N.C. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2506-2514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It is likely that the active Rap1 mutant does not interact as efficiently as wild type Rap1 with its normal targets. Similarly, Stork and co-workers (36Wang Z. Dillon T.J. Pokala V. Mishra S. Labudda K. Hunter B. Stork P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2130-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) noted multiple pools of Rap1 that function differently dependent upon their activators. The cell flattening effect observed with ET and cAMP in HMVECs is distinct from its effects on the morphology of other cell types such as fibroblasts and embryonic kidney cells, which round up via a PKA-dependent mechanism (37Hong J. Beeler J. Zhukovskaya N.L. He W. Tang W.J. Rosner M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This difference in response is not a function of higher anthrax toxin receptor expression in endothelial cells (Ref. 37Hong J. Beeler J. Zhukovskaya N.L. He W. Tang W.J. Rosner M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar and data not shown) but rather the different signaling systems activated in endothelial versus other cell types. Previous studies of Epac and Rap1 have implicated a number of downstream signaling targets that regulate actin remodeling (reviewed in Ref. 13Bos J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) and are undoubtedly contributing factors to the mechanism by which they suppress endothelial cell chemotaxis. Recent reports have indicated that Epac/Rap activation can promote redistribution of cortical actin to endothelial cell junctions, thereby recruiting junctional molecules such as vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and decreasing endothelial cell permeability (23Cullere X. Shaw S.K. Andersson L. Hirahashi J. Luscinskas F.W. Mayadas T.N. Blood. 2005; 105: 1950-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 31Fukuhara S. Sakurai A. Sano H. Yamagishi A. Somekawa S.

Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11675-11682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We also observed cell aggregation and clustering along with inhibition of long range network formation following ET treatment of endothelial cells (data not shown). Because VEGF promotes increased endothelial cell permeability, these studies provide another means by which Epac and Rap1 could function as angiogenic antagonists. Because Epac is anti-chemotactic and a target of ET action, our results suggest that suppression of angiogenesis is a normal physiological consequence of anthrax infection. Both anthrax edema and lethal toxins should act rapidly and synergistically to shut down angiogenesis completely. Lethal toxin (by inhibiting mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK)) blocks endothelial cell proliferation and survival (9Duesbery N.S. Resau J. Webb C.P. Koochekpour S. Koo H.M. Leppla S.H. Vande Woude G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4089-4094Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and edema toxin (by preventing chemotaxis) inhibits the initial stages of the angiogenic process. When injected subcutaneously, edema toxin causes local edema around the injection sites, a phenotype indirectly attributed to the ability of EF to regulate cytokine production in monocytes (39Hoover D.L. Friedlander A.M. Rogers L.C. Yoon I.K. Warren R.L. Cross A.S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4432-4439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This edema precluded the ability to determine whether ET suppresses angiogenesis in mice, because administration of the toxin even at lower doses caused extensive edema and swelling in the mouse skin of the implant (data not shown). Edema formation is likely due in part to activation of PKA, ion channels, or other unidentified targets of cAMP action, because mice treated with the Epac activator 8CPT-2Me-cAMP alone did not exhibit swelling at the injection sites (data not shown). The combined loss of the endothelial cell vasculature and the rapid influx of fluid into infected areas could serve to rapidly diffuse anthrax bacteria throughout the tissue.

A new type of response regulator, hp1043 (HP-RR) from Helicobacter pylori, has been recently identified. HP-RR is essential for cell growth and does not require the well known phosphorelay scheme. Unphosphorylated HP-RR binds specifically to its own promoter (P1043) and autoregulates the promoter of the tlpB gene (PtlpB). We have determined the structure of HP-RR by NMR and x-ray crystallography, revealing a symmetrical dimer with two functional domains. The molecular topology resembles that of the OmpR/PhoB subfamily, however, the symmetrical dimer is stable even in the unphosphorylated state. The dimer interface, formed by three secondary structure elements (α4-β5-α5), resembles that of the active, phosphorylated forms of ArcA and PhoB. Several conserved residues of the HP-RR dimeric interface deviate from the OmpR/PhoB subfamily, although there are similar salt bridges and hydrophobic patches within the interface.

Two-component systems are the predominant signal transduction systems used by prokaryotes and are frequently involved in the regulation of cellular functions in response to variable environmental conditions. These systems exhibit a phosphorelay process from a sensor histidine kinase to an intracellular response regulator protein (RR), 4The abbreviations used are: RR, response regulator; HP, Helicobacter pylori; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect. 4The abbreviations used are: RR, response regulator; HP, Helicobacter pylori; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect. which typically acts as a transcription regulator (1Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2398) Google Scholar). The environmental stimulus triggers the autophosphorylation of the transmitter domain of histidine kinase and then the phosphate group is transferred to an aspartate residue in the N-terminal regulatory domain of RR. Phosphorylation induces a conformational change resulting in dimerization of RR and binding to the promoter of target genes. RRs consist of a conserved N-terminal regulatory domain and a variable C-terminal transactivation domain. The transactivation domains can be divided into three major subfamilies based on the homology of their DNA-binding region: the OmpR/PhoB winged-helix domain (2Martinez-Hackert E. Stock A.M.

Biol. 1999; 292: 1095-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Other response regulator proteins, which are classified as a fourth subfamily, contain different effector domains, such as enzymes. In most RRs, phosphorylation induces conformational changes in a conserved region including the β4-α4 loop and the α4 helix. In CheY, the phosphate provides hydrogen bonds to the Thr87 O-γ and the Ala88 amide nitrogen, which then provide space for Tyr106 to access the interior, resulting in a stabilizing hydrogen bond between the Tyr106 hydroxyl and the Glu89 carbonyl oxygen in the loop. This conformational change drives the conformational change of the α4-β5-α5 face of the regulatory domain that in turn promotes dimerization. A conserved tyrosine (corresponding to Tyr106 of CheY) is the key residue indicating the status of an RR: the inward position, in which the hydroxyl group points toward the N terminus of helix α4, is found in the active state, whereas the outward position is found in the inactive state. It is well known that dimerization allows or increases DNA binding to the promoter recognition element (8Simonovic M. Volz K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28637-28640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Recent analysis of the H. pylori genome sequence revealed the presence of four two-component systems and two orphan response regulators (9Tomb J.F. White O. Kerlavage A.R. Clayton R.A. Sutton G.G.

Based on structural and functional homologies, one of these pairs (analogues of the CheA-CheY proteins) may play a role in regulating random tumbling motions and flagellar rotation in response to signals from chemotaxis receptors (10Armitage J.P. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1999; 41: 229-289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Eisenbach M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The other three pairs of histidine kinase and RR proteins (HP0165-HP0166, HP1364-HP1365, and HP0244-HP0703) and two RR proteins (HP1043 and HP1021) are predicted to be involved in transcriptional regulation (12Beier D. Frank R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2068-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The hp1043 and hp1021 genes encode orphan RRs, for which no histidine kinases have been identified (12Beier D.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4800-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The orphan response regulator HP1043 (HP-RR) has been shown to be essential for the growth of H. pylori (14Schar J. Sickmann A. Beier D. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3100-3109Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). HP-RR binds to its own promoter and performs an autoregulatory function (13Delany I. Spohn G.

Res. 2007; 162: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recent report revealed that the regulatory domain (HP-RRr) is not phosphorylated in vitro and phosphorylation is not necessary for its function, indicating that HP-RR differs from the well known two-component response regulators. HP-RR has thus been classified as belonging to a new response regulator family (14Schar J. Sickmann A. Beier D. J.

According to structural studies of the ArcA regulatory domain, it is suggested that the OmpR/PhoB family has a common dimerization mechanism mediated by the α4-β5-α5 interface with the participation of well conserved residues (16Toro-Roman A.

However, HP-RR has 5 residue substitutions of 11 conserved residues, which could affect the interactions of the dimer interface. A recent report showed that PhoB adopts two different dimerization modes: the inactive α1-α5 interface dimer and the active α4-β5-α5 interface dimer (17Bachhawat P. Swapna G.V. Montelione G.T. Stock A.M. Structure (Camb.). 2005; 13: 1353-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These reports raise questions about the structure-function relationships of HP-RR related to dimerization and activation. Previous studies proposed that HP-RR forms a dimer in vivo (13Delany I. Spohn G. Rappuoli R. Scarlato V. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4800-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We have also reported preliminary NMR data showing that HP-RR is a symmetric dimer with two functional domains, an N-terminal regulatory domain (∼14 kDa) and C-terminal DNA-binding/transactivation domain (∼11 kDa) (18Hong E. Jung J.W. Shin J. Kim J.H. Jeon Y.H. Yamazaki T. Lee W. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 28: 85-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Additionally, ultracentrifugation data also support that HP-RR is a stable dimer in solution. 5E. Hong and W. Lee, unpublished results. 5E. Hong and W. Lee, unpublished results. In this report, we present a detailed three-dimensional structure of HP-RR, a new class of phosphorylation-independent response regulator, using NMR spectroscopy, x-ray crystallography, and site-directed mutagenesis. The structural information presented here will promote understanding of the molecular function of this new type of response regulator. Cloning, Expression, and Purification—Plasmid construction, protein expression, and purification of full-length HP-RR was performed as described (18Hong E. Jung J.W. Shin J. Kim J.H. Jeon Y.H. Yamazaki T. Lee W. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 28: 85-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). DNA fragments encoding the N-terminal regulatory domain, HP-RRr (residues 1-119), and the C-terminal effector domain, HP-RRe (residues 120-223), were inserted into pET-21a(+) with a C-terminal (His)6 tag and into pET-21b3-2 (GE Healthcare) with an N-terminal (His)6 tag. These vectors were used to transform the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Invitrogen) for fusion protein expression. HP-RRr and HP-RRe were overexpressed and purified according to the methods used for full-length HP-RR (18Hong E. Jung J.W. Shin J. Kim J.H. Jeon Y.H. Yamazaki T. Lee W. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 28: 85-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). For x-ray crystallography, selenomethionine-substituted HP-RRr was prepared by transforming E. coli B834(DE3) methionine auxotroph cells (Novagen) with the vector containing HP-RRr and growing the cells in selenomethionine-containing minimal medium. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations were introduced into both HP-RR and HP-RRe using an overlapping PCR strategy. Two PCRs were performed using pET21b3-2 as templates. The PCR products were purified with QIAquick (Qiagen), mixed together, and used as the templates in the final stage. All mutant proteins were expressed and purified as described above. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—A double-stranded PHP1043 oligonucleotide was synthesized with the following sequence: 5′-ATTAATATTTTCTTAAACTAATTTAAAAT-3′. DNA was end-labeled with 20 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase and 250 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Labeled DNA was purified with a Qiagen nucleotide removal kit. To measure DNA binding, purified HP-RR and HP-RRe were incubated with radiolabeled DNA at room temperature for 30 min in the presence of 0.2 μg of poly(dI-dC). DNA complexes were separated on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel in 1× Tris glycine (10% Tris glycine) at 140 V for 4 h and visualized by autoradiography. NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR experiments were recorded at 303 K on a Bruker DRX500 or a DRX600 equipped with an x,y,z-shielded gradient triple resonance probe or a z-shielded gradient triple resonance cryoprobe. NMR spectra were processed with the NMRPipe/nmrDraw software package (19Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11280) Google Scholar) and analyzed using SPARKY (20Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3.3.110 Ed. University of California, San Francisco, CA2004Google Scholar). Backbone resonance data of HP-RR were collected by using deuterium-decoupled TROSY-based triple resonance pulse sequences (21Pervushin K. Riek R. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12366-12371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2040) Google Scholar). Data for HP-RRr and HP-RRe were collected by conventional triple resonance pulse sequences. Three-dimensional experiments used for sequential assignments included HNCO, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HBHA(CO)NH, C(CCCO)NH, H(CCCO)NH, and HCCH-TOCSY. For structural information, 15N-edited and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra were used. Dihedral backbone restraints were derived from 1Ha, 13Cα, 13Cβ, and 13CO chemical shifts using the program TALOS (22Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). The hydrogen bond restraints were determined from hydrogen exchange experiments on amide protons. Residual dipolar couplings were measured by taking the difference in the corresponding J splittings in oriented and isotropic media and 1DNH dipolar coupling constants were obtained using a two-dimensional in-phase or anti-phase 1H-15N HSQC spectra in a liquid crystalline medium (23Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5891-5898Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). NMR Structure Calculation—Initial structure calculations were performed using CYANA 2.0 (24Jee J. Guntert P. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2003; 4: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar). The structures were refined with NIH-XPLOR (version 2.9.7) software (26Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar) by a combination of torsion angle and Cartesian dynamics. A total of 100 structures were calculated, and 20 structures with the lowest target function values were selected for structural analysis. A summary of NMR-derived restraints and structures of HP-RR, HP-RRr, and HP-RRe is given in Table 1. The final structures with the lowest NOE energies were validated by the program PROCHECK (27Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4285) Google Scholar). Solution structures were analyzed and visualized using the programs VMD-XPLOR (28Schwieters C.D. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2001; 149: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), PyMOL (29DeLano W.L. Abstr. Pap. Am. Chem. S. 2004; 228: U313-U314Google Scholar), and MOLMOL (30Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (51-55): 29-32Crossref Scopus (6454) Google Scholar). The electrostatic surface potential was calculated with the program APBS (31Baker N.A. Sept D. Joseph S.

Open table in a new tab Crystallization and Structure Determination—The purification and crystallization of HP-RRr were carried out as described previously (32Lee H.M. Hong E. Jeon B.Y. Kim D.U. Byun J.S. Lee W. Cho H.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1764: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Selenomethionine-substituted HP-RRr crystals were also obtained under the same crystallization conditions with the addition of 5 mm dithiothreitol. Before data collection, the crystals were immersed briefly in a cryoprotectant solution, which was the reservoir solution plus 15% ethylene glycol. A three-wavelength MAD data set of the selenomethionine-labeled crystal based on 200 images (1° rotation) was collected at 0.97940 Å (edge wavelength), 0.97929 Å (peak wavelength), and 0.97162 Å (remote wavelength). All data were collected at beam line 6B of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) in Pohang, Korea using a Bruker AXS proteum300 CCD detector (Bruker, Madison, WI). The data were then indexed, integrated, and scaled using the HKL2000 suite (33Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Macromol. Crystallogr. A. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). Four selenium sites in the asymmetric unit were located and used for phase determination at 2.2 Å with the program SOLVE (34Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3216) Google Scholar). The phases were subsequently improved by density modification with the program RESOLVE (35Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar). The program O (36Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) was used for the electron density model building. The 1.8-Å peak wavelength anomalous dispersion data were re-averaged and used for the refinement of the model with the CNS program package (37Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). Statistics for crystallographic data are summarized in Table 1. Backbone Dynamics—NMR spin-relaxation experiments were performed using the published gradient-selected sensitivity enhanced pulse sequences (38Kordel J. Skelton N.J. Akke M. Palmer 3rd, A.G. Chazin W.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4856-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The longitudinal (R1) spin relaxation rates of the regulatory domain were measured with relaxation delays of 0.002 (×2), 0.15, 0.3 (×2), 0.6, 0.78, 1.0, and 1.2 s. The transverse (R2) relaxation rates of the regulatory domain were obtained with total relaxation delays of 0.0 (×2), 0.015824, 0.031648, 0.047472 (×2), 0.063296, 0.07912, and 0.094944 s. The longitudinal (R1) spin relaxation rates of the effector domain were measured with relaxation delays of 0.002 (×2), 0.065, 0.145, 0.246, 0.366 (×2), 0.527, and 0.759 s. The transverse (R2) relaxation rates of the effector domain were obtained with total relaxation delays of 0.0 (×2), 0.017248, 0.034496, 0.051744 (×2), 0.068992, 0.08624, and 0.103488 s. The heteronuclear cross-relaxation rate (NOE) was obtained by interleaving pulse sequences with and without proton saturation. A recycle delay of 2.5 s was used in all (R1, R2) relaxation experiments. NMR data were processed with NMRPipe (19Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11280) Google Scholar) and visualized with SPARKY (20Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3.3.110 Ed. University of California, San Francisco, CA2004Google Scholar). Characterization of DNA Binding of HP-RR—A recent report proposed that unphosphorylated HP-RR specifically binds to a 29-mer target DNA containing its own promoter sequence (13Delany I. Spohn G. Rappuoli R. Scarlato V. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4800-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which is dependent upon the growth phase at the post-transcriptional level. We have determined the promoter DNA sequences (ATTAATATTTTCTTAAACTAATTTAAAAT) important in binding to HP-RR based on data from electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Fig. 1, A and B). HP-RR has well conserved residues in its transactivation domain, just like OmpR (2Martinez-Hackert E. Stock A.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 109-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), PhoB (4Okamura H. Hanaoka S. Nagadoi A. Makino K. Nishimura Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1225-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 39Blanco A.G. Sola M. Gomis-Ruth F.X. Coll M. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 701-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), and the DrrD. As expected, unphosphorylated HP-RR successfully bound to its target DNA sequences (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the protein had increased affinity for binding DNA mutated at the 11th position (D4) (Fig. 1B). Structure of HP-RR Dimer—Based on gel filtration chromatography and cross-linking experiments, HP-RR is a symmetric dimer. A superposition of the final 20 NMR structures over the energy minimized average structure shows that it consists of 12 β-strands and 8 α-helices in each monomer unit (Fig. 2A). The molecular topology of the HP-RR resembles that of the OmpR/PhoB subfamily with a 2-fold symmetry in the absence of phosphorylation. The N-terminal regulatory domain forms a compact dimer and the transactivation domain is connected to the regulatory domain by a short flexible linker (Fig. 2, B and C). A total of 51 intermolecular NOEs for the dimer interface are observed between two subunits (e.g. Thr79(A)/Arg100(B), Ser80(A)/Ser101(B), Ser80(A)/Ala104(B), Val84(A)/Ala104(B), and Phe87(A)/Ala111(B)). However, no intermolecular interactions between transactivation domains have been observed. The molecular topology of the regulatory domain is an α/β-fold with a central five-stranded β-sheet surrounded by five α-helices. The electrostatic surface of HP-RR mainly consists of two oppositely charged regions, which differs slightly from PhoB. An ensemble of the 20 lowest energy NMR structures of the transactivation domain is displayed in Fig. 3A. The transactivation domain (HP-RRe) consists of an N-terminal four-stranded anti-parallel β sheet (strands β6-β9) and a helix bundle with three α-helices (α6, α7, and α8). The β-hairpin between α6 and α7 enables close interactions with β10. The two helices comprised of α7 and α8 form a helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif. The recognition helix (α8) is also very well defined. The electrostatic surface showed that the transactivation domain consists of two distinct regions with opposite charge distribution (Fig. 3B). The loop between α7 and α8, referred to as a transcription loop for both transcription activation and interaction with the σ80 subunit of the RNA polymerase, is identified. Similar to PhoB/OmpR family proteins, the DNA-binding domain is also stabilized by a conserved hydrophobic core. Comparing the structure of HP-RR with OmpR and PhoB, the root mean square deviations of the Cα atoms of the secondary structural regions are 3.638 Å (OmpR) and 2.146 Å (PhoB, data not shown). Most of the differences originate from the transactivation and winged loop regions (Fig. 3B). To map the DNA-binding site and residues critical for DNA binding, chemical shift perturbations were measured by NMR titration with its consensus DNA. The most significant chemical shift changes were observed for the residues of α8, a recognition helix as shown in Fig. 3, C and D. Dimeric Interface of HP-RR—The crystal structure clearly shows that the 2-fold symmetric dimeric interface is stabilized by the α4-β5-α5 interface that buries 1610 Å2 of surface area (800 Å2 per monomer) (Fig. 4A). The dimeric interface of the HP-RR regulatory domain is similar to that of the active, phosphorylated protein of ArcA (16Toro-Roman A. Mack T.R. Stock A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 11-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and PhoB (17Bachhawat P. Swapna G.V. Montelione G.T. Stock A.M. Structure (Camb.). 2005; 13: 1353-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar); however, the electrostatic interactions and the hydrophobic patch are different from that of active PhoB, which is composed of four salt bridges and three hydrophobic residues. This might be due to amino acid substitutions in the consensus sequence of the dimeric interface. Residues Arg91, Glu111, Lys117, Arg122, and Leu95 in PhoB are replaced by Glu83, Ala104, Glu110, Phe115, and Phe87 in HP-RR, respectively. In addition, solution structure of the regulatory domain based on NMR data confirmed that HP-RR forms a stable dimer through both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. An electrostatic charge network among charged side chains forms three salt bridges: Asp93-Arg108, Glu83-Arg108, and Arg100-Glu83 (Fig. 4B). The ionic interactions are consolidated by inter-subunit hydrogen bonds of the Arg112 side chain with the carbonyl oxygen of Asp92 and the side chain of Arg108 with the carbonyl oxygen of Tyr94. In addition, the hydrophobic interactions among residues Val84, Phe87, Ala104, Ala107, and Ala111 serve as a major stabilizing force for the HP-RR dimer (Fig. 4B). Therefore, it is conceivable that the ionic interactions could serve as a driving force for the initial dimerization process of HP-RR, whereas the hydrophobic interactions contribute to dimer stability. Protein Dynamics of HP-RR—NMR relaxation data were analyzed within the model-free formalism of protein dynamics and indicate an extensive reduction in backbone motion for the residues in the interface region. These effects are reflected by an increase in the generalized order parameter, S2, of the residues in the interface region. These results imply that the dynamics of the dimer illuminates the relative contributions of charged and hydrophobic interactions between these residues. Hydrophobic interactions between the residues in the interface region, such as Val84, Phe87, Ala104, and Ala107 resulted in high order parameters for these residues (Val84,S2 = 0.84; Phe87,S2 = 0.92; Ala104,S2 = 1; Ala107,S2 = 0.99; Ala111,S2 = 0.99) (Fig. 4C). Also, interactions between the charged residues such as Glu83/Arg108 and Asp92/Arg112 resulted in high order parameters for these residues (Glu83,S2 = 0.94; Asp92,S2 = 0.94; Arg108,S2 = 0.98; Arg112,S2 = 0.96). The R2/R1 ratio is 1.54 ± 0.498 for the regulatory domain, and 5.34 ± 0.527 for the transactivation domain, indicating that the regulatory domain forms a rigid dimer, whereas the transactivation domain acts as a monomer. The S2 from backbone data of the transactivation domain averages 0.8882 ± 0.013 for all residues (data not shown). The NH exchange rates of the residues in the solvent exposed loops are higher than that of those in regions of secondary structure. However, Ile95, Ala96, and Val86 show relatively high exchange rates indicating that the dimeric interface is mainly comprised of side chain-side chain interactions. In addition, the relaxation rates are relatively uniform across the whole transactivation domain except some residues. Site-directed Mutagenesis Supports Structural Data of HP-RR—Based on structural and sequence information, mutational analysis for both the regulatory and transactivation domains was performed (Fig. 5A). Seventeen mutant proteins were prepared to study both structural stability and DNA binding, although only 10 mutants are correctly folded and purified. Because phenylalanine 87 in the dimeric interface is a leucine or a"
https://openalex.org/W2168496310,"Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) induce growth arrest or apoptosis in various human cancer cells independently of Ras mutations. However, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Death receptor 5 (DR5) is a pro-apoptotic protein involved in mediating the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Its role in FTI-induced apoptosis has not been reported. In this study, we investigated the modulation of DR5 by the FTI lonafarnib and the involvement of DR5 up-regulation in FTI-induced apoptosis. Lonafarnib activated caspase-8 and its downstream caspases, whereas the caspase-8-specific inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu(methoxy)-Thr-Asp(methoxy)-fluoromethyl ketone or small interfering RNA abrogated lonafarnib-induced apoptosis, indicating that lonafarnib induces caspase-8-dependent apoptosis. Lonafarnib up-regulated DR5 expression, increased cell-surface DR5 distribution, and enhanced tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of a dominant-negative Fas-associated death domain mutant or silencing of DR5 expression using small interfering RNA attenuated lonafarnib-induced apoptosis. These results indicate a critical role of the DR5-mediated extrinsic apoptotic pathway in lonafarnib-induced apoptosis. By analyzing the DR5 promoter, we found that lonafarnib induced a CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP)-dependent transactivation of the DR5 promoter. Lonafarnib increased CHOP expression, whereas silencing of CHOP expression abrogated lonafarnib-induced DR5 expression. These results thus indicate that lonafarnib induces CHOP-dependent DR5 up-regulation. We conclude that CHOP-dependent DR5 up-regulation contributes to lonafarnib-induced apoptosis.

Lonafarnib (LNF; also called SCH66336 and Sarasar), a nonpeptide tricyclic FTI, was one of the first FTIs to undergo clinical testing and to exhibit significant activity (3Adjei A.A. Erlichman C.

In vitro, this agent, either alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents, inhibits the growth or induces apoptosis of several types of human cancer cells (4Adjei A.A. Davis J.N. Bruzek L.M.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4947-4956PubMed Google Scholar). In animal models, LNF demonstrates potent oral activity in a wide array of human tumor xenograft models including tumors of colon, lung, pancreas, prostate, and urinary bladder origin (12Liu M. Bryant M.S. Chen J. Lee S. Yaremko B. Lipari P. Malkowski M. Ferrari E. Nielsen L. Prioli N. Dell J. Sinha D. Syed J. Korfmacher W.A. Nomeir A.A. Lin C.C. Wang L. Taveras A.G. Doll R.J. Njoroge F.G.

When LNF is combined with other chemotherapeutic agents, enhanced antitumor activity is observed (4Adjei A.A. Davis J.N. Bruzek L.M. Erlichman C. Kaufmann S.H. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1438-1445PubMed Google Scholar, 6Smalley K.S. Eisen T.G. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 105: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In a phase I trial enrolling individuals with lung or aerodigestive tract cancer, a provocative clinical activity was observed when LNF was combined with paclitaxel (13Khuri F.R. Glisson B.S. Kim E.S. Statkevich P. Thall P.F. Meyers M.L. Herbst R.S. Munden R.F. Tendler C. Zhu Y. Bangert S. Thompson E. Lu C. Wang X.M. Shin D.M. Kies M.S. Papadimitrakopoulou V. Fossella F.V. Kirschmeier P. Bishop W.R. Hong W.K. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 2968-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In a recent phase II trial, LNF plus paclitaxel achieved significant clinical activity with a favorable safety profile in patients with taxane-refractory/resistant metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer (14Kim E.S. Kies M.S. Fossella F.V. Glisson B.S. Zaknoen S. Statkevich P. Munden R.F. Summey C. Pisters K.M. Papadimitrakopoulou V. Tighiouart M. Rogatko A. Khuri F.R. Cancer. 2005; 104: 561-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and these results were later supported by pre-clinical data in cell lines (15Marcus A.I. O'Brate A.M. Buey R.M. Zhou J. Thomas S. Khuri F.R. Andreu J.M. Diaz F. Giannakakou P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 8838-8846Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). There are two major apoptotic pathways: one involves death signals transduced through death receptors (extrinsic apoptotic pathway), and the other relies on mitochondrial signals (intrinsic apoptotic pathway) (16Green D.R. Cell. 2000; 102: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Both pathways are involved in an ordered activation of a set of caspases, which in turn cleave cellular substrates, leading to apoptosis. The activation of caspase-8 and caspase-9 has been documented to play a central role in mediating apoptosis signaled by death receptors and by mitochondria, respectively; however, caspase-8 can activate the caspase-9-mediated apoptotic pathway by activating or cleaving Bid protein (16Green D.R. Cell. 2000; 102: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). The tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor, death receptor 5 (DR5; also named Apo2, TRAIL receptor 2, TRICK2, or Killer/DR5), belongs to the tumor necrosis factor receptor gene superfamily, the members of which all share a similar cysteine-rich extracellular domain and an additional cytoplasmic death domain (17Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5124) Google Scholar). DR5 localizes to the cell surface, becomes activated or oligomerized (trimerized) upon binding to its ligand TRAIL or through overexpression, and then signals an apoptotic response through caspase-8-mediated rapid activation of caspase cascades (17Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5124) Google Scholar). DR5 has recently attracted more attention because its ligand TRAIL preferentially induces apoptosis in transformed or malignant cells, demonstrating potential as a tumor-selective apoptosis-inducing cytokine for cancer treatment (18Wang S. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8628-8633Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 19Almasan A. Ashkenazi A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2003; 14: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Certain cancer therapeutic agents induce the expression of DR5 in various types of cancer cells and thus are able to augment TRAIL-induced apoptosis or to initiate apoptosis (20Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2950-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), also known as GADD153 (growth arrest and DNA damage gene 153), is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced transcription factor involved in the regulation of apoptosis, particularly ER stress-associated apoptosis (21Oyadomari S. Mori M. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that CHOP directly regulates DR5 expression through a CHOP-binding site in the 5-flanking region of the DR5 gene (22Yamaguchi H. Wang H-G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45495-45502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 23Yoshida T. Shiraishi T. Nakata S. Horinaka M. Wakada M. Mizutani Y. Miki T. Sakai T. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 5662-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Certain drugs induce DR5 expression through CHOP-dependent transactivation of the DR5 gene (22Yamaguchi H. Wang H-G. J.

Carcinogenesis. 2006; 27: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying FTI-mediated growth arrest and apoptosis induction are largely undefined (1Sebti S.M. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 297-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Several nonRas targets such as RhoB and Rab geranylgeranyltransferase have been proposed (25Lebowitz P.F. Prendergast G.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1439-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 26Lackner M.R. Kindt R.M. Carroll P.M. Brown K. Cancilla M.R. Chen C. de Silva H. Franke Y. Guan B. Heuer T. Hung T.

Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 325-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition, Akt inactivation appears to play a role in apoptosis induced by a subset of FTIs (5Chun K.H. Lee H.Y. Hassan K. Khuri F. Hong W.K. Lotan R. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4796-4800PubMed Google Scholar, 27Du W. Liu A. Prendergast G.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4208-4212PubMed Google Scholar, 28Jiang K. Coppola D. Crespo N.C. Nicosia S.V. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Cheng J.Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), although some studies have been unable to demonstrate this role (29Edamatsu H.

In this study, we reveal, for the first time, a novel mechanism in human cancer cells by which FTIs, particularly LNF, induce apoptosis via the CHOP-dependent up-regulation of DR5 expression and subsequent caspase-8 activation. Reagents—LNF and its analog SCH66337 were provided by Schering-Plough Research Institute (Kenilworth, NJ). They were dissolved in Me2SO at a concentration of 10 mm, and aliquots were stored at –80 °C. Stock solutions were diluted to the desired final concentrations with growth medium just before use. Soluble human recombinant TRAIL was purchased from BIOMOL International (Plymouth Meeting, PA). The caspase inhibitors benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone and benzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu(OMe)-Thr-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone were purchased from Enzyme System Products (Livermore, CA). Staurosporine and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal anti-DR5 antibody was purchased from ProSci Inc. (Poway, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-caspase-3 antibody was purchased from Imgenex (San Diego, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-caspase-9, anti-caspase-8, and anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Mouse monoclonal anti-Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP) antibody B4F8 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-HDJ-2 antibody (clone KA2A5.6) was purchased from Lab Vision Corp. (Fremont, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-BiP/GRP78 antibody was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Cell Lines and Cell Cultures—All cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). H460 cell lines stably expressing a dominant-negative Fas-associated death domain mutant (FADDm) were described previously (32Liu X. Yue P. Zhou Z. Khuri F.R. Sun S-Y. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2004; 96: 1769-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). These cell lines were grown in monolayer culture in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with glutamine and 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere consisting of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Western Blot Analysis—The procedures for preparation of whole cell protein lysates and Western blot analysis were described previously (32Liu X. Yue P. Zhou Z. Khuri F.R. Sun S-Y. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2004; 96: 1769-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 33Sun S-Y. Yue P. Wu G.S. El-Deiry W.S. Shroot B. Hong W.K. Lotan R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2357-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Detection of DR5 mRNA Expression—DR5 mRNA was detected by reverse transcription-PCR as follows. Total RNA was isolated from cells using TriReagent (Sigma) as instructed by the manufacturer. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA in a volume of 20 μl containing 1 μl of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, 0.5 μl of dNTP (25 mm each), 0.5 μl of random primer (0.5 μg/μl), 4 μl of 5× reverse transcription buffer, and sterile H2O, followed by incubation at 42 °C for 60 min and inactivation by heating at 70 °C for 15 min. cDNA was then amplified by PCR using the following primers: DR5, 5′-GACCTAGCTCCCCAGCAGAGAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGGCTGCAACTGTGACTCCTAT-3′ (antisense); and β-actin, 5′-GAAACTACCTTCAACTCCATC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACGATGGAGGGGCC-5′ (antisense). The 25-μl amplification mixture contained 2 μl of cDNA, 0.5 μl of dNTP (25 mm each), 1 μl each of the sense and antisense primers (20 μm each), 1 μl of Taq DNA polymerase (5 units/μl; Promega, Madison, MI), 2.5 μl of 10× reaction buffer, and sterile H2O. PCR was performed for 28 cycles. After an initial step at 95 °C for 3 min, each cycle consisted of 50 s of denaturation at 94 °C, 50 s of annealing at 58 °C, and 55 s of extension at 72 °C. This was followed by an additional extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. The housekeeping gene β-actin was also amplified as an internal reference. PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis on a 4% agarose gel, stained, and directly visualized under UV illumination. Construction of DR5 Reporter Plasmid, Transient Transfection, and Luciferase Activity Assay—The plasmid containing a 5′-flanking region of the DR5 gene was kindly provided by Dr. G. S. Wu (Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI). We used this plasmid as a template to amplify a series of deletion fragments of the 5′-flanking region of the DR5 gene ranging from 3070 to 120 bp upstream of the translation start site by PCR and then subcloned these fragments into the pGL3-Basic reporter vector (Promega) through KpnI and BglII restriction sites. In the PCR amplification, the reverse primer 5′-CTTAAGATCTGGCGGTAGGGAACGCTCTTATAGTC-3′ was used to make all deletion constructs. The upstream primers used were 5′-CTTAGGTACCTGGCTCGTCTGTTCCTCTACGGCCCC-3′ (–3070), 5′-CTTAGGTACCTCAACTCATTTCCCCCAAGTTTC-3′ (–420), 5′-CTTAGGTACCACCCAGAAACAAACCACAGCCCGGG-3′ (–373), 5′-CTTAGGTACCCTTATTTATTGTCACCAACCTGTGG-3′ (–240), and 5′-CTTAGGTACCGCACGCGGCCGGAGAACCCC-3′ (–120). These constructs were named pGL3-DR5(–3070), pGL3-DR5(–420), pGL3-DR5(–373), pGL3-DR5(–240), and pGL3-DR5(–120), respectively. The reporter constructs containing a 552-bp 5′-flanking region of the DR5 gene with a wild-type or mutated CHOP-binding site, an NF-κB-binding site, or an Elk-binding site were generously provided by Dr. H.-G. Wang (University of South Florida College of Medicine, Tampa, FL) (22Yamaguchi H. Wang H-G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45495-45502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). In this study, we also used the pGL3-Promoter luciferase vector (pGL3-SV40-Luc; Promega), which contains an SV40 promoter, as a control. A pCH110 plasmid encodingβ-galactosidase (GE Healthcare) was used in the cotransfection for normalization. These plasmids were purified with a Qiafilter plasmid maxi kit (Qiagen Inc.). To examine the effect of LNF on DR5 transactivation activity, cells were seeded in 24-well plates and cotransfected with the given reporter plasmid (0.5 μg/well) and the pCH110 plasmid (0.2 μg/well) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (3:1 ratio; Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were treated with LNF. After 12 h, the cells were lysed and subjected to luciferase activity assay using a luciferase assay system (Promega) in a luminometer. Relative luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity, which was measured as described previously (34Pfahl M. Tzukerman M. Zhang X.K. Lehmann J.M. Hermann T. Wills K.N. Graupner G. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 189: 256-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Detection of Cell-surface DR5—In this study, cell-surface DR5 expression was analyzed by both flow cytometry and immunofluorescent staining. The procedure for direct antibody staining and subsequent flow cytometric analysis of cell-surface protein was described previously (35Sun S-Y. Yue P. Hong W.K. Lotan R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6537-6543PubMed Google Scholar). The mean fluorescent intensity that represents antigenic density on a per cell basis was used to represent DR5 expression levels. Phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-human DR5 (clone DJR2-4), anti-human DR4 (clone DJR1), anti-human decoy receptor 1 (clone DJR3), anti-human decoy receptor 2 (clone DJR4-1), and anti-human Fas (clone DX2) antibodies and PE-conjugated mouse IgG1 isotype control (MOPC21/P3) were purchased from eBioscience (San Diego, CA). For immunofluorescent staining, cells were plated overnight on coverslips in 24-well plates and treated with different concentrations of LNF. Cells were then fixed in 68 mm PIPES, 25 mm HEPES, 15 mm EGTA, and 3 mm MgCl2 with 3.7% formaldehyde, 0.05% glutaraldehyde, and 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min; washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline; and then blocked for 15 min with 10% normal goat serum. Next, cells were incubated with PE-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-DR5 antibody (clone DJR2-4) diluted 1:15 in 5% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. After the cells were washed three times, coverslips were removed from wells, inverted, and placed on slides. Images were acquired using a ×63 Zeiss Plan-Apochromat oil lens (numerical aperture = 1.4) mounted on a Zeiss LMS 510 confocal laser scanning microscope. Detection of Apoptosis—The amounts of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments (mono- and oligonucleosomes) formed during apoptosis were measured using a Cell Death Detection ELISAplus kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Caspase activation and substrate cleavage were detected by Western blot analysis as described above. In addition, we also counted floating cells in the medium as another indicator of apoptotic cell death. Because the albumin in the serum attenuates the FTI effect in culture (31Sun S-Y. Zhou Z. Wang R. Fu H. Khuri F.R. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2004; 3 (Discussion 1099–1101): 1092-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we performed these experiments in 0.1% serum-containing medium to increase induction of apoptosis. Cell Survival Assay—Cells were seeded in 96-well cell culture plates and treated on the 2nd day with the indicated agents. At the end of treatment, the cell number was estimated by the sulforhodamine B assay as described previously (36Sun S-Y. Yue P. Dawson M.I. Shroot B. Michel S. Lamph W.W. Heyman R.A. Teng M. Chandraratna R.A. Shudo K. Hong W.K. Lotan R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4931-4939PubMed Google Scholar). Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated Gene Silencing—High purity control (non-silencing) siRNA oligonucleotides that target sequence 5′-AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3′ was purchased from Qiagen Inc. Caspase-8, DR5, and CHOP siRNA duplexes that target sequences 5′-AACTACCAGAAAGGTATACCT-3′, 5′-AAGACCCTTGTGCTCGTTGTC-3′ (32Liu X. Yue P. Zhou Z. Khuri F.R. Sun S-Y. J. Natl.

Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7570-7578Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and 5′-AAGAACCAGCAGAGGUCACAA-3′ (22Yamaguchi H. Wang H-G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45495-45502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar), respectively, were synthesized by Qiagen Inc. The additional DR5 siRNA-2, which targets sequence 5′-AAGTTGCAGCCGTAGTCTTGA-3′ (22Yamaguchi H. Wang H-G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45495-45502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar), was also synthesized by Qiagen Inc. Transfection of siRNA was performed as described previously (32Liu X. Yue P. Zhou Z. Khuri F.R. Sun S-Y. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2004; 96: 1769-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Gene silencing effects and caspase activation were evaluated by Western blot analysis, whereas DNA fragmentation was measured using the Cell Death Detection ELISAplus kit as described above. Statistical Analysis—Cell survival and apoptosis (i.e. DNA fragmentation) between two groups were analyzed with two-sided unpaired Student's t tests when the variances were equal or with Welch's corrected t test when the variances were not equal using GraphPad InStat Version 3 software. The assumption for use of the t tests was calculated and suggested by the same software. All means ± S.D. from triplicate or quadruplicate samples were calculated with Microsoft Excel Version 5.0 software. In all statistical analyses, results were considered to be statistically significant at p < 0.05. LNF Induces Caspase-8-dependent Apoptosis—Our previous study has shown that LNF induces apoptosis, particularly in low serum culture medium (31Sun S-Y. Zhou Z. Wang R. Fu H. Khuri F.R. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2004; 3 (Discussion 1099–1101): 1092-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Here, we examined further the effects of LNF on caspase activation and its involvement in LNF-induced apoptosis in human lung cancer cells. In both H157 and H1792 human lung cancer cell lines, LNF decreased the levels of the proforms of caspase-8, -9, and -3; increased the levels of their cleaved forms; and induced cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and RasGAP, both of which are caspase-3 substrates (38Wen L.P. Madani K. Martin G.A. Rosen G.D. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). These results indicate that LNF activates both caspase-8- and caspase-9-mediated activation of caspase cascades. Because caspase-8 activation is a critical event in the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway, we tested whether caspase-8 activation is required for LNF-induced apoptosis. LNF significantly increased the amount of DNA fragments (p < 0.001), but in the presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone or the caspase-8 inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu-(OMe)-Thr-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone, LNF failed to increase the levels of DNA fragments (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1B), indicating that LNF-induced apoptosis is caspase-dependent, particularly caspase-8-dependent. To further demonstrate the importance of caspase-8 activation in LNF-induced apoptosis, we silenced the expression of caspase-8 and then examined its impact on LNF-induced apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 1C, caspase-8 levels were dramatically decreased in H1792 cells transfected with the caspase-8 siRNA in comparison with caspase-8 levels in those cells transfected with the control siRNA. By measuring cell survival, we found that LNF caused significantly less cell death in caspase-8 siRNA-transfected cells than in control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 1D). Accordingly, we detected cleaved forms of caspase-8, caspase-3, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (Fig. 1C) and increased amounts of DNA fragments (Fig. 1E) in control siRNA-transfected cells but not in caspase-8 siRNA-transfected cells after exposure to LNF. These results clearly indicate that silencing of caspase-8 expression inhibits LNF-induced apoptosis, further supporting the essential role of caspase-8 activation in LNF-induced apoptosis. Used as control treatments, TRAIL, a cytokine known to trigger the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, failed to decrease cell survival (Fig. 1D) and exhibited attenuated effects on the cleavage of caspase-8, caspase-3, and poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (Fig. 1C) in caspase-8 siRNA-transfected cells, whereas staurosporine, a small molecule known to induce apoptosis through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, was equally active in inducing cell death (Fig. 1D) and cleavage of caspase-3 and poly-(ADP-ribose) polymer"
https://openalex.org/W2017956550,"Chronic activation of the angiotensin II (ANG II) type 1 receptor (AT-1R) is critical in the development of chronic kidney disease. ANG II activates mesangial cells (MCs) and stimulates the synthesis of extracellular matrix components. To determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of MC collagen, a mouse mesangial cell line MES-13 was employed. ANG II treatment induced an increase in collagen synthesis, which was abrogated by co-treatment with losartan (an AT-1R antagonist), wortmannin (a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor), an Akt inhibitor, and stable transfection of dominant negative-Akt1. ANG II induced a significant increase in PI3K activity, which was abolished by co-treatment with losartan or 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine (2′,5′-DOA, an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor) but not by PD123319 (an AT-2R antagonist) or H89 (a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor). The Epac (exchange protein directly activated by cAMP)-specific cAMP analog, 8-pHPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP, significantly increased PI3K activity, whereas a PKA-specific analog, 6-benzoyladenosine-cAMP, showed no effect. The ANG II-induced increase in PI3K activity was also blocked by co-treatment with PP2, an Src inhibitor, or AG1478, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antagonist. ANG II induced phosphorylation of Akt and p70S6K and EGFR, which was abrogated by knockdown of c-Src by small interference RNA. Knockdown of Src also effectively abolished ANG II-induced collagen synthesis. Conversely, stable transfection of a constitutively active Src mutant enhanced basal PI3K activity and collagen production, which was abrogated by AG1478 but not by 2′,5′-DOA. Moreover, acute treatment with ANG II significantly increased Src activity, which was abrogated with co-treatment of 2′,5′-DOA. Taken together, these results suggest that ANG II induces collagen synthesis in MCs by activating the ANG II/AT-1R-EGFR-PI3K pathway. This transactivation is dependent on cAMP/Epac but not on PKA. Src kinase plays a pivotal role in this signaling pathway between cAMP and EGFR. This is the first demonstration that an AT1R-PI3K/Akt crosstalk, along with transactivation of EGFR, mediates ANG II-induced collagen synthesis in MCs. Chronic activation of the angiotensin II (ANG II) type 1 receptor (AT-1R) is critical in the development of chronic kidney disease. ANG II activates mesangial cells (MCs) and stimulates the synthesis of extracellular matrix components. To determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of MC collagen, a mouse mesangial cell line MES-13 was employed. ANG II treatment induced an increase in collagen synthesis, which was abrogated by co-treatment with losartan (an AT-1R antagonist), wortmannin (a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor), an Akt inhibitor, and stable transfection of dominant negative-Akt1. ANG II induced a significant increase in PI3K activity, which was abolished by co-treatment with losartan or 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine (2′,5′-DOA, an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor) but not by PD123319 (an AT-2R antagonist) or H89 (a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor). The Epac (exchange protein directly activated by cAMP)-specific cAMP analog, 8-pHPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP, significantly increased PI3K activity, whereas a PKA-specific analog, 6-benzoyladenosine-cAMP, showed no effect. The ANG II-induced increase in PI3K activity was also blocked by co-treatment with PP2, an Src inhibitor, or AG1478, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antagonist.

Although the effects of these agents on progression in the glomerular diseases have been studied extensively, detailed cellular mechanisms of the effects have not been fully revealed. Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) phosphorylate inositol-containing lipids at the d-3 position of the inositol ring (11Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). The mammalian PI3K can be divided into three major classes (classes I–III) based upon their structure and substrate specificity (12Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). The mammalian class I PI3K can be further divided into two subclasses: class IA PI3K are heterodimers of a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110α, p110β, or p110δ) and a regulatory subunit of 85 or 55 kDa (p85/p55), whereas the class IB PI3K (PI3Kγ) is composed of a p110γ catalytic subunit and a p101 regulatory subunit (11Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). The class I PI3Ks can phosphorylate phosphoinositide (PtdIns), PtdIns 4-phosphate, and PtdIns 4,5-bisphoshate in vitro. In the cells, however, class I PI3Ks preferentially convert PtdIns 4,5-bisphosphate to PtdIns 3,4,5-trisphosphate following stimulation by tyrosine kinase or heteromeric GPCRs (13Koyasu S. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In general, class IA PI3Ks are activated by receptor tyrosine kinase pathways, whereas class IB PI3K (PI3Kγ) is coupled to GPCRs (11Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R.

We have recently demonstrated, however, that cardiac PI3Kα can be activated by stimulation of β-adrenergic receptor in vivo (16Yano N. Ianus V. Zhao T.C. Tseng A. Padbury J.F. Tseng Y.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; (in press)doi: 10.1152/ajpheart.01318.2006Google Scholar). It is unclear which isoform of class I PI3Ks is functionally linked to AT-1R in MCs. Following PI3K activation, PtdIns 3,4,5-trisphosphate recruits and phosphorylates the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 and Akt/protein kinase B, bringing these proteins into proximity at the plasma membrane where Akt is phosphorylated on threonine 308 by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1. This is followed by phosphorylation at serine 473 by a yet-to-be identified mechanism (17Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar).

These findings suggested that ANG II/AT-1R signaling is implicated in hypersynthesis of collagens in MCs through a crosstalk with the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and is involved in the development and progression of various kinds of glomerular diseases. However, the detailed mechanisms of ANG II-induced collagen synthesis in MCs and a role of ANG II in the signaling pathway have not been fully elucidated. To explore the ANG II/AT-1R to PI3K/Akt pathway, we employed an in vitro culture system by using the well characterized mouse mesangial cell line, MES-13. With pharmacological and genetic signal modification studies we demonstrated that several factors such as cAMP, Src kinase, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) play critical roles in the pathway. Materials—All chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Cell Culture—MES-13 mouse mesangial cells (ATCC® no. CRL-1927) were grown in a 3:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's and Ham's F-12 media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum containing 50 units/ml penicillin G and 50 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were first grown up to 70% confluency and synchronized overnight in serum-free medium prior to treatment. For immunoprecipitation and PI3K assay, the quiescent cells were treated with vehicle or ANG II (0.1 μm) for various durations. In some experiments cells were pretreated with selective inhibitors for indicated durations before ANG II treatment. PI3K Assays—MES-13 cell lysates were prepared as described (26Tseng Y-T. Yano N. Rojan A. Stabila J.P. McGonnigal B.G. Ianus V. Wadhawan R. Padbury J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: H1834-H1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and protein concentrations were determined with the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). PI3K activity was determined with in vitro immunoprecipitation lipid kinase assay as described previously (26Tseng Y-T. Yano N. Rojan A. Stabila J.P. McGonnigal B.G. Ianus V. Wadhawan R. Padbury J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: H1834-H1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates (0.5 mg) were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-pY) antibody (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA), and l-α-phosphoinositide (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) was used as the lipid substrate (2 μg/reaction). After incubation, the final extracted reaction mixtures were spotted onto silica gel-coated TLC plates (Whatman, Florham Park, NJ) and run in TLC buffer (65% n-propanol, 0.54 m acetic acid). The results were analyzed by phosphorimaging (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—For immunoprecipitation, MES-13 cells were treated with ANG II (0.1 μm) for 1–30 min. Protein lysates (0.5 mg) were incubated with protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) for 2 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and incubated with an antibody specific for EGFR (1005, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 4 °C for 4 h with continuous rotation. A 20-μl packed volume of protein G-Sepharose was added, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C. After washing, 45 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer was added. The sample was heated in boiling water for 5 min and quenched on ice for 2 min. After vortex and centrifuge, 20 μl of the supernatant was resolved on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblotted with anti-pY (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The blot was stripped and re-blotted with anti-EGFR. Collagen expressions were measured in cells treated with ANG II (0.1 μm) for 24 h by Western blotting using anti-procollagen type I (Y-18, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and normalized with β-actin levels. Protein phosphorylation of Akt and p70S6K was measured in cells treated with ANG II (0.1 μm) for 1–30 min by Western blotting using phospho-specific antibodies against Akt (Thr-308) and p70S6K (Thr-389) and normalized with total Akt and p70S6K (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) as previously described (26Tseng Y-T. Yano N. Rojan A. Stabila J.P. McGonnigal B.G. Ianus V. Wadhawan R. Padbury J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: H1834-H1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The results were visualized by ECL chemiluminescence (Pierce). Stable Transfection—A vector expressing dominant negative Akt1 was engineered by inserting a K179M mutant dominant negative Akt1 cDNA (27Feng L-X. Ravindranath N. Dym M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25572-25576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) into a multiple cloning site of an eukaryotic expression vector, pUSEamp(+) (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA). A 529F mutant constitutively active Src cDNA (28Chan T-O. Tanaka A. Bjorge J.D. Fujita D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3280-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was processed similarly to engineer a vector expressing constitutively active Src. Stable transfection of the constructs in MES-13 cells was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Individual single cells were isolated and screened for neomycin resistance. The stably transfected cells were treated similarly as described above. RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from MES-13 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was carried out on MES-13 cell total RNA followed by PCR using the following primer pairs: collagen, type I, α1 (Coll-1α1) sense, 5′-CCT GGT AAC ACT GGT CCT CCT G-3′; Coll-1α1 antisense, 5′-ATC TTC ACC CTT GCC ACC TG-3′; collagen, type I, α2 (Coll-1α2) sense, 5′-GAC ATT GGT GGT GCT GAC-3′; Coll-1α2 antisense, 5′-GGA AAC GGG AAA GAG AAA G-3′; collagen, type III, α1 (Coll-3α1) sense, 5′-GTT CTA GAG GAT GGC TGT ACT AAA CAC A-3′; Coll-3α1 antisense, 5′-TTG CCT TGC GTG TTT GAT ATT C-3′; collagen, type IV, α1 (Coll-4α1) sense, 5′-TGG ACA GAA AGG TCA GAA AG-3′; Coll-4α1 antisense, 5′-TAC CAG GGA AGC CAA CTC-3′; c-Src sense, 5′-GCT ACA GAC GAT AGG AAA GG-3′; c-Src antisense, 5′-CTC CAC ACA TCA GAC TTG-3′; GAPDH sense, 5′-TGG CAA AGT GGA GAT TGT TG-3′; and GAPDH antisense, 5′-CTT CTG GGT GGC AGT GAT G-3′. Src Activity Assay—Protein lysates (1 mg) from MES-13 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Src antibody (N-16, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Kinase activity was determined by measuring phosphorylation of a specific Src substrate (KVEKIGEGTYGVVYK) using an Src assay kit (Upstate). Briefly, the c-Src immunoprecipitated beads were incubated with a [γ-32P]ATP-ATP-Mg2+ mix at 30 °C for 10 min. A sample without the substrate peptide was included as a background control. Reactions were terminated by adding 40% trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation the supernatants that include phosphorylated substrate were transferred onto Whatman P81 ion-exchange cellulose chromatography paper circles, washed five times in 0.75% phosphoric acid, washed once in acetone, and then counted in a scintillation counter. Transfection of siRNA for c-Src—Two complementary hairpin siRNA template oligonucleotides, containing 21-nucleotide target sequences of the mouse c-Src tyrosine kinase (5′-AAG TAC AAC TTC CAT GGC ACT-3′, GenBank™ BC052006), were annealed and ligated into pScilencer™ 5.1-H1 Retro vector (Ambion, Austin, TX). The vector was then transfected to MES-13 cell using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After the transfection, individual single cells were isolated and screened for puromycin (1000 ng/ml) resistance. As a control of the experiment, the transfection was repeated using scrambled oligonucleotides of the same length with minimum homology to mammalian genes. The knockdown of c-Src was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance of the difference among groups was analyzed by the paired Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance followed by Newman-Keuls test. All the statistical analysis was done using Statistica Version 5.0 (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK). All data were represented as the mean ± S.E. of three different experiments unless otherwise noted in the figure legends. A probability of p < 0.05 was considered to represent a significant difference. ANG II Induces Increases in Phosphotyrosine-associated PI3K Activity and Phosphorylation of p70S6K and Akt through AT-1R—In MES-13 cells, acute treatment with ANG II (0.1 μm) induced a significant increase in phosphotyrosine-associated PI3K activity (Fig. 1A). The increases in PI3K activity were seen 1 min after ANG II treatment, peaked at 2 min, and disappeared 5 min afterward. To determine the most effective in vitro dosage of ANG II in the experiment, cells were treated with three different concentrations of ANG II (0.01, 0.1, and 1 μm) for 2 min. As shown in Fig. 1B, PI3K activity was most strongly induced with 0.1 μm ANG II, and this dose was used in all the following experiments. The ANG II-induced increase in PI3K activity in MES-13 cells was mediated by the AT-1 subtype of ANG receptor, because co-treatment with losartan (1 μm, Merck & Co., Inc, Whitehouse Station, NJ), an AT-1R antagonist, abrogated the effect of ANG II, whereas co-treatment with PD123319 (1 μm), an AT-2R antagonist, had no effect (Fig. 2). To assess if the downstream signaling molecules in the PI3K signaling pathway are similarly affected by ANG II, MES-13 cells were treated with ANG II for 1, 2, 5, 15, or 30 min, and phosphorylation of Akt and p70S6K was examined by Western blotting. There was a significant increase in Akt phosphorylation (threonine 308) 1 min after ANG II treatment. The effect was peaked at 2 min then tapered down gradually thereafter (Fig. 3A). The phosphorylation of p70S6K (threonine 389) was also significantly increased with the peak effects seen at 2 min after ANG II treatment (Fig. 3B). These results demonstrate that acute AT-1R stimulation induces activation of PI3K and the downstream signaling pathway in MES-13 cells.FIGURE 3ANG II induces increases in phosphorylation of Akt and p70S6K. MES-13 mesangial cells were treated with vehicle or ANG II (0.1 μm) for the indicated durations. Western blotting was performed on cell lysates (30 μg/lane) with antibodies against phospho-Akt (Thr-308) and total Akt (A) or antibodies against phospho-p70S6K (Thr-389) and total p70S6K (B). The bar graphs show the densitometric scanning results from three individual experiments.

ANG II has been shown to increase the synthesis of collagen. We next examine what subtypes of collagen are affected by acute ANG II treatment. First, quiescent MES-13 cells were treated with ANG II under serum-free condition for various durations (30, 60, 90, 120, 240, and 360 min), and the gene levels of four subtypes of collagen (Coll-1α1, Coll-1α2, Coll-3α1, and Coll-4α1) were determined by RT-PCR. The quiescent cells expressed only trace amounts of collagen genes. ANG II induced a significant increase in Coll-1α1 and Coll-1α2 gene levels 90 min after initiation of treatment, and the effect was still evident after 6 h (Fig. 4A). In contrast, neither of the Coll-3α1 and Coll-4α1 gene levels was affected by ANG II. To further examine if ANG II treatment can increase collagen protein levels and to determine if this effect is mediated by AT-1R, quiescent MES-13 cells were treated with vehicle, ANG II (0.1 μm), or ANG II in combination with an inhibitor for PI3K or AT-1R for 24 h. Western blotting results demonstrated a significant increase in the protein levels of procollagen type I in ANG II-treated cells (Fig. 4B). This effect was completely abrogated by co-treatment with either a PI3K inhibitor (wortmannin, 20 nm) or an AT-1R antagonist (losartan, 1 μm) (Fig. 4B). These results demonstrate an AT-1R-mediated, PI3K-dependent increase in collagen synthesis in MES-13 cells. As shown in Fig. 3B, Akt phosphorylation was significantly increased by ANG II treatment. To further determine the role of Akt in the ANG II-mediated increase in collagen synthesis, MES-13 mesangial cells were stably transfected with an empty vector (pUSEamp(+)) or the vector expressing a dominant negative Akt1. As seen in nontransfected cells (Fig. 4B), ANG II treatment induced a significant increase in procollagen type I levels in cells stably transfected with pUSEamp(+) (Fig. 4C). This effect of ANG II, however, was abrogated when the same pUSEamp(+)-transfected cells were co-treated with an Akt inhibitor (10 μm, Calbiochem). In cells stably transfected with dominant negative Akt1, the effect of ANG II on collagen synthesis was also abrogated (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these data suggest that the PI3K signaling pathway plays an important in the AT-1R-mediated activation of collagen gene expression in MES-13 cells. ANG II-induced Increase in PI3K Activity Requires the Involvement of Adenylyl Cyclase, Src Family Tyrosine Kinases, and EGFR Transactivation—To investigate the intracellular signaling event responsible for ANG II/AT-1R-mediated activation of PI3K, MES-13 cells were treated with vehicle, ANG II alone, or ANG II in combination with activators or inhibitors of several signaling pathways. The effect of acute ANG II treatment on activation of PI3K activity was abolished by co-treatment of 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine (100 μm; 2′,5′-DOA), an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor (Fig. 5A). Co-treatment with H-89 (10 μm), a cAMP-dependent kinases (PKA) inhibitor, however, failed to diminish the effect of ANG II on PI3K activity. Treatment with forskolin alone (1 μm, 5 min), an adenylyl cyclase activator, also increased PI3K activity in MES-13 cells (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that a PKA-independent, Gαs-cAMP pathway is involved in the ANG II/AT-1R-mediated increase in PI3K activity in MES-13 cells. The Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) play important roles in controlling a variety of cellular functions in response to increases in intracellular Ca2+ and has been shown to be a factor in ANG II-induced signaling cascade (49Gambaryan S. Butt E. Tas P. Smolenski A. Allolio B. Walter U. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: E423-E433Google Scholar). To explore the role of CaMK in ANG II-induced activation of PI3K, MES-13 cells were treated with the vehicle, ANG II alone, ANG II in combination with KN93 (5 μm, Calbiochem), the specific CaMK inhibitor, or ANG II in combination with KN92 (5 μm, Calbiochem), an analog of KN93 that dose not affect CaMK activity. The effects of ANG II/AT-1R stimulation on PI3K activation were not significantly changed by either KN93 or KN92 (Fig. 5B). The result suggests that the cAMP-CaMK pathway is not involved in the ANG II/AT-1R-PI3K crosstalk in the MES-13 cells. Cells were further treated with vehicle, ANG II, cAMP (1 mm, Upstate), 8-(4-hydroxyphenylthio)-2′-O-methyladenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-pHPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP, 200 μm, BIOLOG LSI, Bremem, Germany), a potent specific activator of the exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac) or N6-benzoyladenosine-cAMP (300 μm, BIOLOG LSI), a PKA-specific activator, for 2 min, and PI3K activity was assayed. As with ANG II, 8-pHPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP as well as cAMP induced significant increases in PI3K activity, whereas 6-benzoyladenosine-cAMP showed no significant effect (Fig. 5C). The result suggests that the cAMP-Epac pathway is involved in the ANG II/AT-1R-mediated increase in PI3K activity in MES-13 cells. We next examined other signaling pathways that may be involved in ANG II-induced activation of PI3K in MES-13 cells. Co-treatment with GF109203X (10 μm), an inhibitor for PKC, or farnesylthiosalicylic acid (20 μm, Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), an inhibitor for Ras, did not significantly alter the effect of ANG II on PI3K activity. In contrast, co-treatment with PP2 (10 μm, Tocris Bioscience, Ellisville, MO), an inhibitor for the Src-family tyrosine kinases, completely abolished the effect of ANG II (Fig. 6A). Moreover, co-treatment with an inhibitor for platelet-derived growth factor receptor (AG1296, 10 μm, Calbiochem) or insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (AG1024, 1 μm, Calbiochem) did not alter the effect of ANG II, whereas co-treatment with an inhibitor of EGFR (AG1478, 5 μg/ml) fully abrogated the effect of ANG II (Fig. 6B). The crosstalk between AT-1R and EGFR was further established in immunoprecipitation experiments. Quiescent MES-13 cells were treated with ANG II for 1–30 min, and ce"

We previously cloned NHE1 from Amphiuma tridactylum (AtNHE1) and Pleuronectes americanus (PaNHE1). Although highly homologous to the amiloride- and HOE-sensitive human NHE1 (hNHE1), AtNHE1 is insensitive to HOE-type and PaNHE1 to both amiloride- and HOE-type compounds. Here we generated chimeras to “knock in” amiloride and HOE sensitivity to PaNHE1, and we thereby identified several NHE1 regions involved in inhibitor interaction. The markedly different inhibitor sensitivities of hNHE1, AtNHE1, and PaNHE1 could not be accounted for by differences in transmembrane (TM) region 9. Replacing TM10 through the C-terminal tail of PaNHE1 with the corresponding region of AtNHE1 partially restored sensitivity to amiloride and the related compound 5′-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA) but not to HOE694. This effect was not due to the tail region, but it was dependent on TM10–11, because replacing only this region with that of AtNHE1 also partially restored amiloride and EIPA but not HOE sensitivity. The converse mutant (TM10–11 of AtNHE1 replaced with those of PaNHE1) exhibited even higher amiloride and EIPA sensitivity and was also HOE-sensitive. Replacing an LFFFY motif in TM region 4 of PaNHE1 with the corresponding residues of hNHE1 (VFFLF) or AtNHE1 (TFFLF) greatly increased sensitivity to both amiloride- and HOE-type compounds, despite the fact that AtNHE1 is HOE694-insensitive. Gain of amiloride sensitivity appeared to correlate with increased Na+/H+ exchange rates. It is concluded that regions within TM4 and TM10–11 contribute to amiloride and HOE sensitivity, with both regions imparting partial inhibitor sensitivity to NHE1.

The ubiquitous plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchanger, NHE1, plays a major role in the regulation of cellular pH, cell volume, and cytoskeletal organization in most cell types, and it has been implicated in the control of a wide variety of cellular functions, including migration, proliferation, and cell death (1Putney L.K.

Accordingly, NHE1 is often referred to as the “housekeeping” isoform. Consistent with its widespread roles, excessive NHE1 activity is a central factor in several clinically important pathophysiological states, including the growth advantage and invasive properties of many cancer cells (5McLean L.A.

All known mammalian NHE1s are sensitive to amiloride and to 5′-N-substituted amiloride derivatives such as 5′-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA), 2The abbreviations used are: EIPA, 5′-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride; AtNHE1, A. tridactylum NHE1; PaNHE1, P. americanus NHE1; hNHE1, human NHE1; HOE, Hoechst type inhibitor; TM, transmembrane; RBC, red blood cell; BCECF-AM, 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethy)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl ester; NMDG, N-methyl-d-glucamine or N-methyl-d-glucamine-Cl; NHE, Na+/H+ exchanger; IL, intracellular loop; EL, extracellular loop. 2The abbreviations used are: EIPA, 5′-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride; AtNHE1, A. tridactylum NHE1; PaNHE1, P. americanus NHE1; hNHE1, human NHE1; HOE, Hoechst type inhibitor; TM, transmembrane; RBC, red blood cell; BCECF-AM, 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethy)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl ester; NMDG, N-methyl-d-glucamine or N-methyl-d-glucamine-Cl; NHE, Na+/H+ exchanger; IL, intracellular loop; EL, extracellular loop. as well as to the Hoechst-type inhibitors HOE642 (cariporide) and HOE694, which are benzoylguanidinium compounds with some structural resemblance to amiloride and its derivatives (12Masereel B. Pochet L. Laeckmann D. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 38: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In contrast, NHE3, which is the Na+ uptake pathway located in the apical membrane of many epithelial cells, is essentially insensitive to these compounds (13Burckhardt G. Di Sole F. Helmle-Kolb C. J. Nephrol. 2002; 15: 3-21PubMed Google Scholar).Hydropathy analyses suggest a membrane topology for NHE1 of 12 transmembrane (TM) domains and a large C-terminal cytoplasmic region. Additionally, cysteine accessibility studies have pointed to the presence of one large and two smaller re-entrant loops, partially embedded in the membrane (14Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The two smaller loops are located intracellularly between TM4 and -5 (i.e. intracellular loop (IL) 2) and TM8 and -9 (i.e. IL4), respectively, whereas the large loop, the fifth extracellular loop (EL5), which resembles the poreforming loops found in voltage-gated ion channels, has an extracellular origin and presumably inserts into the exofacial surface between TM9 and -10 (2Orlowski J. Grinstein S. Pfluegers Arch. 2004; 447: 549-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 14Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These putative re-entrant regions are highly conserved among hNHE1, AtNHE1, and PaNHE1, supporting the notion that they are critical for NHE1 function.A number of studies have implicated sites in TM4 and TM9 in amiloride-type inhibitor binding to NHE1. Early mutagenesis studies of hamster NHE1 established important roles of Phe165 and Leu167 of TM4 (15Counillon L. Franchi A. Pouyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4508-4512Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and the apparent role of TM4 was substantiated by later studies of both NHE1 (16Touret N. Poujeol P. Counillon L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5095-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and NHE2, which also exhibits substantial sensitivity to these compounds (17Yun C.H. Little P.J. Nath S.K. Levine S.A. Pouyssegur J. Tse C.M. Donowitz M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Similar investigations of human NHE1 pointed to the involvement of His349 in TM9 (18Wang D. Balkovetz D.F. Warnock D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C392-C402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in amiloride sensitivity. Roles for Glu391 of hNHE1, which resides in the presumed reentrant loop between TM9 and TM10 (19Murtazina R. Booth B.J. Bullis B.L. Singh D.N. Fliegel L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4674-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and for residues in the extracellular loop between TM3 and TM4 (20Khadilkar A. Iannuzzi P. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43792-43800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), have also been proposed, indicating that association with inhibitors involves multiple NHE1 regions. The apparent major role of TM9 was supported by the findings that replacement of 66 amino acids in and around TM9 of NHE1 with the corresponding residues of NHE3 decreased inhibitor sensitivity (21Orlowski J. Kandasamy R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19922-19927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and that targeted replacement of Glu350 (rat)/Glu346 (human) or Gly356 (rat) in TM9 reduced sensitivity to both amiloride- and HOE-type compounds (20Khadilkar A. Iannuzzi P. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43792-43800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 22Noel J. Germain D. Vadnais J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 15361-15368Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).A limitation shared by all of the above studies is that when studying loss-of-function mutants, specific effects of the mutated residue generally can not be separated from broader conformational changes indirectly affecting the property of interest. A more ideal system would allow gain-of-function mutants to be created from homologues of high sequence similarity. Although NHE3 is amiloride-insensitive, the low sequence homology of this isoform to NHE1 (39% for the human homologues) severely compromises its use for gain-of-function studies of inhibitor sensitivity. To our knowledge, the only previous such studies involved replacement of all or part of the NHE3 TM9 with the corresponding residues of NHE1, manipulations which only partially conferred HOE694 sensitivity to NHE3 (20Khadilkar A. Iannuzzi P. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43792-43800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 21Orlowski J. Kandasamy R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19922-19927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although these findings might indicate that the role of TM9 in inhibitor binding is only partial, this conclusion cannot be separated from effects simply reflecting the low sequence similarity between NHE1 and NHE3. The two NHE1 homologues cloned from the giant salamander Amphiuma tridactylum (AtNHE1, see Ref. 23McLean L.A. Zia S. Gorin F.A. Cala P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1025-C1037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the winter flounder, Pleuronectes americanus (PaNHE1, see Ref. 24Pedersen S.F. King S.A. Rigor R.R. Zhuang Z. Warren J.M. Cala P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C1561-C1576Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), respectively, exhibit very high sequence homology to hNHE1 (79 and 65% overall amino acid identity to hNHE1, respectively). It was therefore exciting to find that despite this high homology, AtNHE1 and PaNHE1 differ dramatically from hNHE1 with respect to inhibitor sensitivity. The AtNHE1 is amiloride-sensitive yet HOE-insensitive (23McLean L.A. Zia S. Gorin F.A. Cala P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1025-C1037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and, unique among the NHE1s, PaNHE1 is completely insensitive to amiloride, EIPA, and HOE (24Pedersen S.F. King S.A. Rigor R.R. Zhuang Z. Warren J.M. Cala P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C1561-C1576Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 25King S.A. Pedersen S.F. Cala P.M. FASEB J. 2005; 19A1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Consequently, PaNHE is an ideal background for identification of regions necessary for inhibitor binding by “knock-in” of inhibitor sensitivity. Another interesting aspect of this comparative model is that TM9 is identical between hNHE1 and AtNHE1 and differs by only two similar residues in PaNHE1, indicating that other regions in addition to TM9 must influence inhibitor binding.Therefore, the aim of this study was to further define regions of NHE1 responsible for inhibitor binding, using PaNHE1 as a background for the construction of gain-of-function NHE1 chimeras exhibiting inhibitor sensitivity. In this manner, we confirmed the important role of TM4 in determining the inhibitor sensitivity of NHE1, and we demonstrated for the first time that regions in TM10–11 and/or the associated intra- and extracellular loops (IL5 and EL6) play a major role in NHE1 inhibitor sensitivity. Parts of these findings have been published previously in abstract form (25King S.A. Pedersen S.F. Cala P.M. FASEB J. 2005; 19A1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and SolutionsUnless otherwise stated, chemicals were of analytical or molecular biology grade and were obtained from Sigma or Fisher. Amiloride and EIPA were obtained from Sigma and were dissolved at 0.5 m in Me2SO. The 4-isopropyl-3-methylsulfonylbenzoylguanidine, methane sulfonate (HOE642, cariporide) and 3-methylsulfonyl-4-piperidinobenzoylguanidine, methane sulfonate (HOE694) were kind gifts from Aventis Pharma, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and both these compounds were dissolved at 0.1 m in Me2SO. HOE642 and HOE694 are structurally closely related and exhibit comparable IC50 values for NHE1 (reported at 26 nm for HOE642 and 130 nm for HOE694, respectively, for inhibition of EIPA-sensitive 22Na+ uptake into rabbit RBCs) (26Baumgarth M. Beier N. Gericke R. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 2017-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because in this study much higher concentrations of these compounds (>20 μm) were employed to answer the yes/no question of whether a given construct was refractory to inhibition by these compounds, their effects on NHE1 are assumed to be similar, and consequently we did not test both compounds in all experiments. 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethy)-5(6)-Carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM) was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) and was dissolved at 1 mm in Me2SO. Ouabain was from Sigma and, where used, was dissolved directly into the Ringer solutions at 1 mm. Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA), and T4 ligase was from Invitrogen.Preparation of Red Blood CellsA. tridactylum (giant salamanders) were obtained from Atchafalaya Bio (Raceland, LA) and maintained in fresh water tanks at room temperature. Amphiuma RBCs were harvested by cardiac puncture with a heparinized syringe. The cells were separated from the plasma by gentle centrifugation (1000 × g, 45 s) and washed three times in 10–15 volumes of isotonic Ringer (in mm: NaCl 90–110, KCl 3; MgCl2 1; CaCl2 0.5, HEPES 18; glucose 5, pH 7.65), matched to the plasma osmolarity of the animal from which blood was obtained (220–250 mosm).P. americanus (winter flounder) were caught off the coast of Maine and kept in sea water at 10 °C. Pleuronectes RBCs were obtained by caudal vein puncture with a heparinized syringe. Plasma and buffy coat were removed by mild centrifugation (1800 × g, 60 s), and the cells were washed three times in 8–10 volumes of isotonic Ringer (in mm: NaCl 148, KCl 3; MgCl2 1; CaCl2 0.75, HEPES 30, pH 7.65, 360 mosm).Following harvest and wash, the RBCs were suspended at a hematocrit of 10% and incubated for 1.5 (Amphiuma) or 2 h (Pleuronectes) in the dark prior to experiments. Hypertonic Ringer solutions were obtained by increasing the concentration of NaCl.Net Flux Measurements of Na+, K+, Cl-, and H2O in RBCsAll net flux experiments were conducted at room temperature (20–25 °C), and all flux media contained ouabain (1 mm) to prevent contributions from the Na+/K+-ATPase. The RBC content of Na+, K+, Cl-, and H2O was determined from 400-μl aliquots of cell suspensions prepared as above, as described previously for Amphiuma (27Cala P.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1980; 76: 683-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 28Cala P.M. Maldonado H.M. J. Gen.

To initiate an experiment, cells were separated from suspension media by gentle centrifugation, and experimental medium was added to the cell pellet to yield a hematocrit of 10%. 400-μl samples were removed at the indicated time points, transferred to preweighed polyethylene tubes (Stockwell Scientific, Monterey Park, CA), and centrifuged for 4 min at 12,000 × g (Amphiuma) or 16,750 × g (Pleuronectes). The wet cell pellet was weighed and lysed by mechanical disruption in ∼250 μl of lysis buffer (4.6 mm MgSO4 and 40 mm ZnSO4). The lysate was centrifuged at 4 min at 12,000 × g (Amphiuma) or two times for 15 min at 16,750 × g (Pleuronectes), and the pellet was separated from the supernatant. Cellular Na+ and K+ contents were determined by flame photometry (model 443, Instrumentation Laboratories, Boston) and Cl- content by coulometric titration using a Buchler chloridometer (Searle Diagnostics Inc., Fort Lee, NJ). The pellets were dried to constant weight (for a minimum of 18 h at 60–70 °C) and weighed, and cellular H2O content was calculated as the difference between wet and dry weight of the cell pellets. All measurements were corrected for trapped extracellular medium as described previously for Amphiuma (28Cala P.M. Maldonado H.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 1035-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and Pleuronectes (24Pedersen S.F. King S.A. Rigor R.R. Zhuang Z. Warren J.M. Cala P.M. Am. J.

Physiol. 1989; 257: C1158-C1165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) were the kind gift from Dr. S. Grinstein, Hospital for Sick Children, Ontario, Canada. NHE1-transfected and -untransfected AP1 cells were grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity in α-modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, 1% penicillin and streptomycin (all from Invitrogen). Media for transfected cells additionally contained 600 μg/ml G418 sulfate (Invitrogen). Every 3–4 days, the cells were passaged by gentle trypsinization. Only passages 5–30 were used for experiments.Constructs and Stable Transfection of Wild Type and Mutant NHE1Wild type A. tridactylum and P. americanus NHE1 were cloned and inserted into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 as described previously (23McLean L.A. Zia S. Gorin F.A. Cala P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1025-C1037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Holt M.E. King S.A. Cala P.M. Pedersen S.F. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 45: 1-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The At/PaNHE1 chimeras were constructed using common restriction enzyme sites as follows. The PaTM7CAt (replacement of residues 240 through the end of the C terminus with the corresponding residues of AtNHE1) and PaCAt chimeras (replacement of residues C-terminal to 489 with the corresponding residues of AtNHE1) were made using the two BsgI sites, and the PaTM10CAt chimera (replacement of residues C-terminal to 403 with the corresponding residues of AtNHE1) was constructed using the PshAI site. The PaTM10–12At chimera (residues 403–488 replaced by the corresponding residues of AtNHE1) was made by digesting PaTM10CAt and PaNHE1 with BsgI and ligating the appropriate fragments. The AtTM 10–12Pa chimera (residues 420–503 of AtNHE1 replaced by the corresponding residues of PaNHE1) was constructed using the same sites. The PaTM4h (LFFFY of TM4 replaced by the corresponding residues of hNHE1, VFFLF) and PaTM4At constructs (LFFFY in TM4 replaced by the corresponding residues of AtNHE1, TFFLF) were made by point mutagenesis using the QuikChange Multi (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing prior to transfection (DBS Sequencing Facility, University of California Davis). Transfectants were selected for resistance to 600 μg/ml geneticin (G418), and NHE1 expression was verified by Western blotting using the 4e9 mouse monoclonal NHE1 antibody. Clonal selection was carried out by limiting dilution, and stably transfected clones were used in all experiments. All the chimeras employed in the study were functional.

Cells were rinsed in isotonic Ringer (IR, 130 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm NaOH, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4, 300 mosm) then incubated in IR with 1 μm BCECF-AM for 30 min at 37 °C in a CO2-free incubator. The cells loaded with BCECF were then mounted in a Warner RC-21B perfusion chamber of a Zeiss Axiovert S100 microscope equipped with a 63× Plan Apochromat objective. BCECF was excited at 490 and 440 nm wavelengths, and emission was measured at 530 nm. Data were acquired using Openlab software (Improvision, Lexington, MA). Intracellular pH was determined by radiometric analysis of emissions from 490 nm excitation (the pH-sensitive) to the 440 nm excitation (the pH-insensitive) wavelength, emission was measured at 530 nm. Two means of activating NHE1 were applied as follows: intracellular acidification and hypertonic challenge. To acidify the cells and measure pH recovery, we initially perfused the cells with IR to determine base-line pH and then alkalinized the cells by perfusing with an NH+4/NH3 solution (125 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm NaOH, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm NH4Cl, pH 7.4, 310 mosm) followed by perfusion with an ammonium- and Na+-free solution (127.5 mm NMDG-Cl, 3 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 15 mm NMDG-OH, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4, 300 mosm) to cause rapid acidification as NH3 diffused out of the cells, leaving H+ behind. The acidified cells were then perfused with IR plus inhibitors (unless otherwise indicated concentrations were 500 μm amiloride and 100 μm HOE694 or HOE642) and finally with IR alone. It may be noted that there was zero recovery after acid loading in untransfected AP1 cells (see Fig. 2A); hence, the initial rate of pHi recovery in the NHE1-transfected cells can be taken to reflect NHE1 activity.To test response to hypertonic challenge, we initially perfused with IR to measure base-line pH and then perfused the cells with a Na+-free hypertonic solution (210 mm NMDG-Cl, 3 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 15 mm NMDG-OH, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4, 490 mosm), followed by Na+-containing hypertonic solution (210 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm NaOH, 10 mm glucose, pH 7. 4, 490 mosm) containing inhibitors. Finally, the cells were perfused with hypertonic solution in the absence of inhibitors. Positive controls for inhibitor efficacy were always run as parallel control experiments. Each experiment was concluded by perfusing the cells with a high K+ solution (95 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm KOH, 35 mm NMDG-Cl, 10 mm glucose; pH 7.0, 300 mosm) containing 10 μm nigericin. This final treatment was used to calibrate the ratio data. The calibration equation was obtained by determining the 490/440 nm ratio in five different high K+ solutions of pH values from 6.0 to 8.0, followed by fitting these data to a third degree polynomial equation. To convert the experimental data to pHi values, the 490/440 nm ratio (R) was calculated for each experiment after subtraction of background fluorescence (coverslip with unloaded cells in the appropriate Ringer). Finally, the pHi values were calculated from normalized R values (RN) using the equation pHi = 1.1 × RN3 - 5.2 × RN2 + 9.1 × RN + 1.6. The R values were normalized by adding the difference between the calculated value at pH 7.0 and the value of the curve at pH 7.0 (1.32 ± 0.0055, n = 63). This procedure allowed for greater range of ratio data and was shown to correspond well to the Boyarsky method of 7-point high K+/nigericin calibration (32Boyarsky G. Ganz M.B. Sterzel R.B. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: C844-C856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Cell Population Measurements and Estimation of IC50 Values—Measurements of pHi in cell populations were carried out essentially as described previously (23McLean L.A.

Biophys. 2006; 45: 1-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded on collagen-coated coverslips and were ∼90% confluent at the day of the experiment. Cells were loaded with 2 μm BCECF-AM in IR for 30 min at 37 °C, washed twice, and incubated another 15 min in IR prior to use. The cells were mounted in the temperature-controlled cuvette house of a PTI Ratiomaster spectrofluorometer (PTI, Lawrenceville, NJ) and perfused with 37 °C IR at a flow rate of 1.6 ml/min. During Ringer replacement, the flow rate was increased to 3.5 ml/min. Where indicated, the perfusate contained amiloride, EIPA, HOE642, or HOE694 at the relevant concentrations. BCECF fluorescence was measured at 525 nm after excitation at 445 and 495 nm."
https://openalex.org/W1996688457,"Abstract Differential phosphorylation of transcription factors by signal transduction pathways play an important role in regulation of gene expression and functions. ESE-1 is an epithelium-specific ETS transcription factor that transforms human breast epithelial cells through a serine- and aspartic acid-rich domain (SAR) by an unknown cytoplasmic mechanism. Here we found that a signaling kinase, p21-activated kinase-1 (Pak1), interacts with and phosphorylates ESE-1. Interestingly, Pak1 selectively phosphorylates ESE-1 at Ser207, which is located within the SAR domain. A S207A substitution in ESE-1 reduced its ability to transform breast cancer cells. We also found that ESE-1 is a labile protein and by interacting with F-box-binding protein β-TrCP, undergoes ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. Intriguingly, Pak1 phosphorylation inactive mutant ESE1-S207A is more unstable than either wild-type ESE-1 or its Pak1 phosphorylation mimetic mutant, i.e. ESE1-S207E. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanism of transformation potential of ESE-1 and discovered that ESE-1 functions are coordinately regulated by Pak1 phosphorylation and β-TrCP-dependent ubiquitin-proteasome pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2034602804,"Memapsin 2 (beta-secretase, BACE1) is the protease that initiates cleavage of beta-amyloid precursor protein leading to the production of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Reducing Abeta by targeting memapsin 2 is a major strategy in developing new AD therapy. Here, in a proof-of-concept study, we show that immunization of transgenic AD mice (Tg2576) with memapsin 2 resulted in Abeta reduction and cognitive improvement. To study the basis of this therapy, we demonstrated that anti-memapsin 2 (anti-M2) antibodies were rapidly internalized and reduced Abeta production in cultured cells. These antibodies also effectively crossed the blood-brain barrier to reach the brain. Two- and 10-month Tg2576 mice were immunized and monitored over 10 and 6 months, respectively. We observed a significant decrease of plasma and brain Abeta40 and Abeta42 (approximately 35%) in the immunized mice as compared to controls. Immunized mice also showed better cognitive performance than controls in both cohorts. Brain histological analyses found no evidence of T cell/microglia/astrocyte activation in the immunized mice, suggesting the absence of inflammatory responses. These results suggest that memapsin 2 immunization in Tg2576 was effective in reducing Abeta production and improving cognitive function and that the current approach warrants further investigation as a therapy for AD."

This study examines HADHSC expression in purified rat beta cells and investigates whether its selective suppression elevates insulin release. Beta cells expressed the highest levels of HADHSC mRNA and protein of all examined tissues, including those with high rates of mitochondrial β-oxidation. On the other hand, beta cells expressed relatively low levels of other β-oxidation enzymes (acyl-CoA dehydrogenase short, medium, and long chain and acetyl-coenzyme A acyltransferase 2). HADHSC expression was sequence-specifically silenced by RNA interference, and the effects were examined on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion following 48–72 h of suppression. In both rat beta cells and in the beta cell line INS1 832-13, HADHSC silencing resulted in elevated insulin release at low and at high glucose concentrations, which appeared not to be caused by increased rates of glucose metabolism or an inhibition in fatty acid oxidation.

Down-regulation of HADHSC causes an elevated secretory activity suggesting that this enzyme protects against inappropriately high insulin levels and hypoglycemia. The insulin-producing beta cells provide a crucial glucose sensor to metabolic homeostasis. Their responsiveness to variations in blood glucose levels protects the organism against lethal hypoglycemia or chronically devastating hyperglycemia. This involves generation of glucose metabolism-derived coupling signals that translate the glucose stimulus into metabolically adequate insulin synthesis and secretion. The cellular rates of glucose utilization and oxidation are proportionate to the ambient glucose level over a wide concentration range (0–10 mm) (1Schuit F.C. Kiekens R. Pipeleers D.G. Biochem.

The physiologic relevance of this mechanism is illustrated by the appearance of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia for mutations in glucokinase (6Gloyn A.L. Noordam K. Willemsen M.A. Ellard S. Lam W.W.

Mutations in the K+ATP channel subunits SUR1 and Kir6.2 that favor channel closure can also enhance beta cell depolarization and insulin secretion, but these occur without direct changes in beta cell metabolic flux.

It was recently reported that a loss-of-function mutation in the HADHSC gene (NCBI gene number 3033) was associated with fasting hyperinsulinemia (OMIM 601820) (8Clayton P.T. Eaton S. Aynsley-Green A. Edginton M. Hussain K. Krywawych S. Datta V. Malingre H.E. Berger R. van den Berg I.E. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 9Molven A.

The HADHSC (EC 1.1.1.35) protein is known to act in a common branch of the cyclically organized β-oxidation pathway, converting l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs of variable chain length to their corresponding 3-ketoacyl CoAs (10Liang X. Le W. Zhang D. Schulz H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 279-282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1a). It was also recently associated with a K+ATP-independent regulation of insulin release by insulin-producing cells, suggesting that the hyperinsulinemia in patients with an HADHSC mutation might be partially caused by dysregulated beta cells (11Hardy O.T. Hohmeier H.E. Becker T.C. Manduchi E. Doliba N.M. Gupta R.K. White P. Stoeckert Jr., C.J. Matschinsky F.M. Newgard C.B. Kaestner K.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To investigate this possibility and its underlying mechanism, we first compared the expression of HADHSC and other enzymes of the β-oxidation pathway in purified rat primary beta cells and in the beta cell line INS1 832-13 with that in other cell types. Next, we selectively suppressed HADSHC expression by RNA interference and examined the influence on the insulin secretory activity, nutrient metabolism, and redox state of the cells. Rat INS1 832-13 cells were cultured in 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone), RPMI 1640 medium, GlutaMAX™ (Invitrogen), supplemented to 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, penicillin/streptomycin, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol (designated as “INS1 culture medium”). Purified rat hepatocytes for metabolic profiling were kindly provided by Dr. P. Papeleu and were isolated as described previously (12Papeleu P. Vanhaecke T. Henkens T. Elaut G. Vinken M. Snykers S. Rogiers V. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 320: 229-237PubMed Google Scholar). Adult male Wistar rats (150–250 g; Janvier, France) were bred according to the Belgian regulations for animal welfare and used in experiments that were approved by the local ethical committee. Beta cells (90 ± 3% insulin-positive cells) and islet non-beta cells (68 ± 9% glucagon-positive cells and <10% beta cells) were purified as described (13Pipeleers D.G. in't Veld P.A. Van de Winkel M. Maes E. Schuit F.C. Gepts W. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). FACS-purified rat beta cells were cultured in Ham’s F-10 nutrient mixture (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.5% BSA (Cohn analog, Sigma), 2 mm glutamine, 10 mm glucose, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), 2% fetal calf serum (Hyclone). d-[U-14C]Glucose (306–311 mCi/mmol; 1 mCi/5 ml) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences and [U-14C]palmitic acid (850 mCi/mmol; 0.1 mCi/ml) from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Sodium salts of fatty acids (C4-butyrate, C6-caproiate, and C16-palmitate) were added from a 100× stock in 90% ethanol. Total RNA was extracted from pancreatic endocrine cells using RNeasy (Qiagen) minicolumns, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA from other rat tissues and from INS1 832-13 cells (passage 46–52) was extracted using TRIzol reagent. RNA quality was verified by Agilent bioanalyzer (minimal cutoff RNA integrity number ≥8). Following removal of genomic DNA (TURBO DNA-free, Ambion, Austin, TX) and reverse transcription (high capacity cDNA archive kit, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), targets were amplified from cDNA template on ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detector using TaqMan universal PCR master mix and commercially available sequence-specific primers and TaqMan MGB probe (Applied Biosystems, identification of assays is available on request). Expression of target genes were normalized toward β-actin (ΔCt) and expressed versus a chosen calibrator (comparative ΔΔCt method). Relative mRNA levels of HADHSC versus other β-oxidation enzymes were calculated using the formula 2-ΔCt, where ΔCt = (Ct value of HAHSC) - (Ct of other enzyme), measured in same run. For Western blotting, cells or tissues were sonicated in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors, and their protein content was measured by Bradford assay. Samples of 15 μg of protein were mixed with SDS containing sample buffer and separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) and incubated with chicken anti-human HADHSC (A22261,Genway Biotech, Inc., San Diego) at a 1:4000 dilution. Horseradish peroxidase-linked rabbit anti-chicken/turkey IgG (H + L) (1:2000, 61-3120, Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was used as a second antibody. Actin was detected by mouse anti-human monoclonal C4 (MP Biomedicals) at 1:2000 and horseradish peroxidase-donkey anti-mouse at 1:2000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as primary and secondary antibody, respectively. Peroxidase activity was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Western blotting substrate; Pierce). The intensities of the bands of interest were quantified by Scion image software, expressed in arbitrary units of optical density (OD), and normalized by the intensity of actin from the same blot. The Genway anti-HADHSC antibody was also used for immune staining of human pancreas sections. Small tissue fragments were fixed for 30 min in 4% formaldehyde followed by an overnight incubation in 30% sucrose; after snap freezing in liquid nitrogen, the tissue was stored at -80 °C until cryosectioning into 5-μm sections. Nonspecific staining was blocked with 10% donkey serum in phosphate-buffered saline, followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies, 60 min with secondary antibodies, and addition of bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33342, Sigma). Anti-insulin (guinea pig) and anti-glucagon (rabbit) antibodies were produced in-house by Dr. C. Van Schravendijk; secondary antibodies, raised in donkey, were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch (Suffolk, UK). Images were acquired on Axioplan microscope (Carl Zeiss) using Smartcapture VP software; digital processing was limited to a 5 × 5 soft enhance filter. siRNA Transfection of INS1 Cells—INS1 832-13 cells (15 × 104 cells/well) were cultured overnight in 1 ml of INS1 medium (24-well plates) and then transfected in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) for 4 h, using siLentFect lipid reagent (Bio-Rad) and Dharmacon siRNA. Transfection was done in a total volume of 250 μl, at 20 nm siRNA (0.07 μg siRNA/well) and a lipid/siRNA ratio of 1 μl of siLentFECT/0.07 μg of siRNA. siRNA against rat HADHSC was siGENOME SMARTpool reagent (M-091802-00; Dharmacon), a pool of four different siRNAs. The silencing effect of the combined pool of four different siRNAs was always more powerful than the individual helices, which achieved mRNA silencing ranging from 45 to 55% (data not shown). Control siRNA was either nontargeting siGLO RISC-free (D-001600-01-20) or siRNA designed against human/mouse lamin A/C (siGLO lamin A/C siRNA, D-001620-01-20). Over 95% of siGLO-transfected cells showed cytoplasmic, punctate siRNA-associated fluorescence; 60% of cells also showed a diffuse cytoplasmic red fluorescence. Co-transfections with enhanced GFP-coding plasmids resulted in 65–70% transfection as measured by flow cytometry. Transfection did not result in overt cytotoxicity (as assessed by propidium iodide/bisbenzimide staining) but slowed down cellular proliferation. Manual Buörker counting was used to quantify INS1 cell population doublings during exponential growth phase. The amount of cell cycles/24 h (= F) was calculated from the number of plated cells at start (= N0) and after t days of culture (= Nt), using the formula Nt = N0 × e (F×t). The number of cell cycles/24 h (= F) decreased from 0.53 ± 0.21 for untransfected cells to 0.43 ± 0.20 for siRNA-transfected cells (p < 0.001, n = 8). No differences in cellular proliferation were observed between control siGLO lamin A/C, RISC-free siRNA, or HADHSC SMART pool siRNA-treated cells. siRNA Transfection of Primary Rat Beta Cells—Transfection was initiated in FACS-purified rat beta cells shortly after isolation; beta cells were aggregated for 2 h and cultured overnight in the presence of 50 nm siRNA-lipid complexes in Ham’s F-10-based medium as described above. The same siRNA reagents were used as in INS1 cells, however using Jetsi-ENDO (Polyplus, France) as lipid transfection agent. Over 85% of beta cells in the aggregates accumulated fluorescent siRNA, characterized by intense punctate distribution associated with a weaker diffuse cytoplasmic fluorescence. After 24 h, aggregates were gently washed once and further cultured in fresh culture medium containing 10 mm glucose for an additional 48 h. Beta cell viability, as measured by the absence of nuclear propidium iodide, prior to start of perifusion was >80%."

Virus tropism and tissue access are modulated by endothelial cells. To examine the susceptibility of microvascular endothelial cells (MECs) derived from pancreatic islets to infection with CV group B (CVB), purified cultured human islet MECs were infected with CVB-4 strain, and the immunological phenotype of the infected cells was analyzed. CVB-4 persistently infected the islet MECs, which expressed the CV receptors human coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (HCAR) and decay accelerating factor (DAF) and maintained EC characteristics, without overt cytopathic effects. CVB-4 infection transiently up-regulated expression of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 and increased production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and IL-6, and chemokines IL-8 and lymphotactin, as well as IFN-alpha. Mononuclear cell adhesion to CVB infected monolayers was increased, compared to uninfected monolayers. Moreover, infection up-regulated the viral receptors HCAR and DAF and coreceptor alpha(v)beta3 integrin on islet MECs, while down-regulating expression of HCAR on human aortic endothelial cells, indicating potential tissue-specific influence on the pathological outcome of infection. These results provide evidence that islet MECs are natural targets and reservoirs for persistent CVB infection resulting in acute endothelial cell activation by virus, which may contribute to selective recruitment of subsets of leukocytes during inflammatory immune responses, such as insulitis in type 1 diabetes."

https://openalex.org/W2075595924,"The anaphase-promoting complex (APC) or cyclosome is a multisubunit ubiquitin-protein ligase that ubiquitinates and thereby promotes the destruction of the mitotic cyclins and the separase inhibitor, securin. The contributions of the APC to progression through the meiotic program are not clear. To clarify the function of the APC in meiosis, we screened several yeast meiotic proteins as APC substrates in vitro. We found that the meiotic regulator Spo13 is an APC substrate that is degraded during anaphase I. Spo13 is expressed only in meiotic cells, where it has multiple functions, including the promotion of monopolar chromosome attachment in the first division. Spo13 ubiquitination by the APC depends on an LxExxxN sequence (residues 26–32) that is distinct from previously described destruction sequences of APC substrates. Mutation of one residue, leucine 26, prevented Spo13 ubiquitination by the APC in vitro and stabilized the protein through the meiotic divisions. Analysis of meiotic progression and spore viability of yeast containing the stabilized Spo13 mutant revealed no significant defects, indicating that Spo13 destruction in anaphase I is not essential for meiosis. We propose that Spo13 destruction is one of multiple mechanisms underlying the switch from monopolar to bipolar chromosome attachment between the meiotic divisions.

Spo13 ubiquitination by the APC depends on an LxExxxN sequence (residues 26–32) that is distinct from previously described destruction sequences of APC substrates. Mutation of one residue, leucine 26, prevented Spo13 ubiquitination by the APC in vitro and stabilized the protein through the meiotic divisions. Analysis of meiotic progression and spore viability of yeast containing the stabilized Spo13 mutant revealed no significant defects, indicating that Spo13 destruction in anaphase I is not essential for meiosis. We propose that Spo13 destruction is one of multiple mechanisms underlying the switch from monopolar to bipolar chromosome attachment between the meiotic divisions. The anaphase-promoting complex (APC) 2The abbreviations used are: APC, anaphase-promoting complex; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; HA, hemagglutinin; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein. catalyzes the final step in the ubiquitination of several mitotic proteins, thereby targeting them for destruction in the proteasome (1Peters J.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 644-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar, 2Thornton B.R. Toczyski D.P. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 3069-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The APC has many targets, but its critical substrates are securin, whose destruction triggers sister-chromatid segregation, and the mitotic cyclins, whose destruction leads to the inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinases and the exit from mitosis (3Thornton B.R. Toczyski D.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1090-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). APC activation in mitosis depends on its sequential association with the activator subunits Cdc20 and Cdh1 (1Peters J.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 644-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar, 2Thornton B.R. Toczyski D.P. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 3069-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 4Morgan D.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E47-E53Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), which are thought to recruit substrates to the enzyme for ubiquitination. APC activity is first stimulated in early mitosis by association with Cdc20, and the resulting APCCdc20 complex targets securin and cyclins for degradation, thereby initiating anaphase. Later in mitosis, the APC associates with Cdh1, resulting in stable APCCdh1 activity throughout the following G1. APC substrates contain amino acid sequence motifs that are required for their ubiquitination and are thought to interact with activator subunits and other sites on the enzyme (5Zachariae W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 2-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The most commonly found sequence is the destruction-box (D-box), a highly degenerate motif based on the sequence Rxx-LxxxxN (6Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar, 7King R.W. Glotzer M. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1343-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). A second common motif is the KEN-box (KENxxxN) (8Pfleger C.M. Kirschner M.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 655-665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a few rare cases, APC target destruction depends on sequences that are quite distinct from D- and KEN-boxes (9Hildebrandt E.R. Hoyt M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3402-3416Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 10Castro A. Vigneron S. Bernis C. Labbe J.C. Lorca T. Mol.

The substrate features that allow recognition by the APC remain poorly understood, and our knowledge of APC-substrate interactions would benefit from a more extensive list of APC substrates. In addition to its functions in the mitotic cell cycle, the APC is required during meiosis, a specialized form of nuclear division in which a single round of chromosome duplication is followed by two rounds of chromosome segregation (meiosis I and meiosis II). Budding yeast carrying mutations in essential subunits of the APC arrest in metaphase I (13Oelschlaegel T. Schwickart M. Matos J. Bogdanova A. Camasses A. Havlis J. Shevchenko A. Zachariae W. Cell. 2005; 120: 773-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14Penkner A.M. Prinz S. Ferscha S. Klein F. Cell. 2005; 120: 789-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); the APC is also required for spore wall development after meiosis (15Schwickart M. Havlis J. Habermann B. Bogdanova A. Camasses A. Oelschlaegel T. Shevchenko A. Zachariae W. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 3562-3576Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As in mitosis, progression through the two meiotic divisions requires APCCdc20-mediated destruction of securin and cyclins (13Oelschlaegel T. Schwickart M. Matos J. Bogdanova A. Camasses A. Havlis J. Shevchenko A. Zachariae W. Cell. 2005; 120: 773-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16Salah S.M. Nasmyth K. Chromosoma (Berl.). 2000; 109: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition, meiotic progression in yeast depends on a meiosis-specific APC activator, Ama1, whose function remains unclear. Cells lacking AMA1 arrest after the second meiotic division with elongated spindles and fail to develop spore walls (13Oelschlaegel T. Schwickart M. Matos J. Bogdanova A. Camasses A. Havlis J.

A. 2000; 97: 14548-14553Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). APCAma1 also contributes to substrate degradation in anaphase I, as ama1Δ cells do not efficiently degrade securin or the cyclins (13Oelschlaegel T. Schwickart M. Matos J. Bogdanova A. Camasses A. Havlis J. Shevchenko A. Zachariae W. Cell. 2005; 120: 773-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The APC activator Cdh1 does not seem to contribute significantly to progression through the meiotic divisions. It is not known if the APC helps govern the meiosis-specific processes that lead to segregation of homologs in the first division and sister chromatids in the second (18Petronczki M. Siomos M.F. Nasmyth K. Cell. 2003; 112: 423-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). In the first division, both sister chromatids in each homolog must be attached to the same spindle pole (monopolar orientation, in contrast to the bi-orientation of mitosis). Monopolar orientation depends on kinetochore proteins called monopolins, which are released from the kinetochores after the first division, allowing sisters to bi-orient on the second meiotic spindle (19Toth A. Rabitsch K.P. Galova M. Schleiffer A. Buonomo S.B. Nasmyth K. Cell. 2000; 103: 1155-1168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 20Rabitsch K.P. Petronczki M. Javerzat J.P. Genier S. Chwalla B. Schleiffer A. Tanaka T.U. Nasmyth K. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 535-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Another key feature of the first division is that cohesion between sister chromatids is lost along chromosome arms but protected at the centromeres by the protein Sgo1 (21Kitajima T.S. Kawashima S.A. Watanabe Y. Nature. 2004; 427: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 22Riedel C.G. Katis V.L. Katou Y. Mori S. Itoh T. Helmhart W. Galova M. Petronczki M. Gregan J. Cetin B. Mudrak I. Ogris E. Mechtler K. Pelletier L. Buchholz F. Shirahige K. Nasmyth K. Nature. 2006; 441: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), so that sister chromatids remain linked for successful segregation in the second division. The mechanisms that trigger the loss of monopolins and the deprotection of centromere cohesion remain unclear, but both occur during anaphase I and one intriguing possibility is that the APC is involved. To address the possibility of additional APC functions in meiosis, we performed a screen for meiotic substrates of the APC in budding yeast. We identified the meiotic regulator Spo13 as an APC target that is degraded during anaphase I. Intriguingly, Spo13 helps promote monopolar chromosome attachment and the protection of centromeric cohesion, and spo13Δ cells perform a single aberrant chromosome division (23Katis V.L. Matos J. Mori S. Shirahige K. Zachariae W. Nasmyth K. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 2183-2196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 24Lee B.H. Kiburz B.M. Amon A. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 2168-2182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We identified an unusual destruction sequence, distinct from D- and KEN-boxes, that is required for Spo13 destruction; mutation of this sequence prevents Spo13 destruction in anaphase I. We suggest that degradation of Spo13 by the APC is one of several redundant mechanisms that facilitate the bi-orientation of sister chromatids in the second meiotic division. General Yeast Methods—All strains were based on the W303 background. For galactose-inducible SPO13 expression, the SPO13 coding sequence was inserted by recombination in either a low copy CEN/ARS plasmid (pRS314.1234) or high copy 2-micron plasmid (pAB1234) in frame with a C-terminal TAP tag, under the control of the GAL1–10 promoter. The APC bypass strain (apc2Δ pds1Δ clb5Δ SIC110X) was a kind gift of David Toczyski (3Thornton B.R. Toczyski D.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1090-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Measurement of Protein Stability in Vivo—W303 MAT a yeast, carrying low copy plasmids with galactose-inducible SPO13-TAP or spo13-db-TAP, were arrested in raffinose (2%) media supplemented with either α factor (G1) or nocodazole (M) for 3 h. Once arrested, galactose (2%) was added to the media to induce production of Spo13-TAP or Spo13-db-TAP. After 2 h, dextrose (2%), and cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) were added to simultaneously repress transcription and translation. Samples were withdrawn at the indicated times, protein extracts prepared, and immunoblot analysis performed to assess protein stability. APC Reactions—The desired genes, or fragments of the SPO13 gene (Fig. 2, A–C), were amplified by PCR, using primers that add a T7 promoter upstream of the protein-coding sequence. Substrates were then produced in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega) by coupled transcription and translation in the presence of [35S]methionine, as described previously (25Carroll C.W. Enquist-Newman M. Morgan D.O. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 11-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 26Carroll C.W. Morgan D.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 880-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Alternatively, plasmids containing the SPO13-TAP or the spo13-(L26A)-TAP gene (Figs. 1A and 2, D and F) were used as templates for translation in vitro. Following translation, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) was added to translation mixtures to inactivate ubiquitin chain-forming activities that otherwise extend the products of subsequent APC reactions. 10 mm dithiothreitol was then added to inactivate NEM. As described previously (25Carroll C.W. Enquist-Newman M. Morgan D.O. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 11-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 26Carroll C.W. Morgan D.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 880-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), substrates (in NEM-inactivated reticulocyte lysates) were mixed with ubiquitin, ATP, E1, E2, APC, and baculovirus-derived Cdh1 and incubated for 45 min at room temperature unless otherwise indicated. In some experiments (Fig. 2F), Cdh1 and Cdc20 were produced by translation in vitro, and the lysate used directly in the APC reactions; NEM was not added in these experiments because it inactivates Cdc20.FIGURE 1Spo13 is an APC substrate that disappears in anaphase I of the meiotic program. A, Spo13 is a substrate of the APC in vitro. Plasmids encoding Pds1 and Spo13-TAP, and a PCR product encoding Mam1, were transcribed and translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine and mixed with APC, Cdh1, ubiquitin, ATP, E1, and E2 (+), or without APC and Cdh1 (-). Reaction products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. B, Spo13 is less stable in G1 cells than in M phase cells. Cells were arrested by treatment with α factor (G1) or nocodazole (M), and Spo13-TAP expression was induced by galactose addition to the media. After 2 h, transcription and translation were stopped by addition of dextrose and cycloheximide. Samples were taken at the indicated times and the amount of Spo13 assessed by immunoblot. C, localization of Spo13-HA in meiotic cells. Diploid SK1 yeast were induced to undergo synchronous meiosis, and samples were prepared for in situ localization of Spo13-HA with anti-HA antibodies (α-HA), localization of DNA with a chemical dye (DAPI), and spindle localization with antitubulin antibodies (tub). The status of the meiotic spindle was used to stage cells, and over 100 cells for each stage were analyzed. Representative images are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mitotic Experiments—To determine the effect of SPO13 overexpression in mitotic cells, W303 MAT a yeast (with plasmids carrying galactose-inducible SPO13-TAP or spo13-db-TAP) were arrested in raffinose (2%) media supplemented with α factor (1 μgml-1) at 30 °C for 2 h. Galactose was added (2%) for 1 h, and cells were then released into fresh raffinose/galactose media. Meiotic Experiments—All meiotic experiments were performed in the SK1 budding yeast strain. To introduce the spo13-L26A mutation, the SPO13 gene, including promoter, was subcloned into the Yplac211 vector, and site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate the L26A mutant. Digestion with PstI was used to integrate at the SPO13 locus, and the vector was selected against on 5-fluoroorotic acid media. PCR and sequencing were used to confirm that the L26A mutation was retained at the SPO13 locus. Diploid yeast were induced to undergo meiosis by the following protocol. Diploids were grown overnight in YPD media (yeast peptone + 2% dextrose) to saturation (A600 = 4–5). The following day, the yeast were diluted (A = 0.2) into YPA media (YP media + 2% acetate) and grown for a further 16 h. The yeast were washed in water and released into SPO media (2% acetate + 0.02% raffinose) at A = 1.8, and samples were processed for immunoblot analysis or immunofluorescence. The antibodies used were α-tubulin clone YOL1/34 (Serotec), α-HA clone 16B12 (Babco), and PAP (Sigma). Identification of Spo13 as an APC Substrate—To identify additional APC functions in meiosis, we performed a screen for novel substrates. A list of candidate substrates was compiled from meiosis-specific transcripts (27Chu S. DeRisi J. Eisen M. Mulholland J. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Herskowitz I. Science. 1998; 282: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar) that encode proteins containing either of the two well described APC consensus recognition motifs, the D-box or KEN-box. Additional substrates with known involvement in the meiotic divisions were also included. A total of 31 candidates (supplemental Table 1) were analyzed by generating PCR products encoding the meiotic gene downstream of the T7 promoter. Radiolabeled substrates were prepared by coupled transcription and translation in vitro and then incubated with purified APC, Cdh1, ubiquitin, ATP, E1, and E2. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis for incorporation of ubiquitin (25Carroll C.W. Enquist-Newman M. Morgan D.O. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 11-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). As a positive control, we used the budding yeast securin, Pds1, a known APC substrate in both mitosis and meiosis (16Salah S.M. Nasmyth K. Chromosoma (Berl.). 2000; 109: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 28Cohen-Fix O. Peters J.M. Kirschner M.W. Koshland D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3081-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Two of the 31 candidates, Spo13 and Ndt80, were detectably ubiquitinated. The best substrate was Spo13, which was ubiquitinated to an extent comparable to that seen with Pds1 (Fig. 1A). Incorporation of ubiquitin in Spo13 depended on both the APC and the activator Cdh1 (data not shown). A second protein, the meiotic transcription factor Ndt80, was ubiquitinated poorly (data not shown). We therefore focused our efforts on Spo13. The remaining 29 candidate proteins displayed no detectable incorporation of ubiquitin by the APC. The monopolin component Mam1 is shown as a representative example in Fig. 1A. This may indicate that these proteins are not APC substrates, but it is also possible that some of these proteins are APC targets whose ubiquitination is difficult to reconstitute in vitro for technical reasons. In budding yeast, the APC is active in G1 cells but is inactive in cells arrested in M phase (1Peters J.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 644-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Therefore, meiotic APC substrates ectopically expressed in mitotic cells should be unstable in G1 and stable in M phase. Spo13 was expressed from the GAL1–10 promoter in budding yeast cells, which were arrested in either α factor (G1) or nocodazole (M phase). After expression for 2 h, transcription and translation were simultaneously repressed by addition of both dextrose and cycloheximide, and immunoblotting was used to assess protein levels at various times thereafter. Spo13 was more unstable in G1-arrested cells than in M phase-arrested cells, consistent with it being an APC substrate (Fig. 1B). Disappearance of Spo13 in Anaphase I—We examined the status of Spo13 in meiotic cells (Fig. 1C). Consistent with previous observations, Spo13 was visibly present in metaphase I cells but specifically reduced in anaphase I cells (23Katis V.L. Matos J. Mori S. Shirahige K. Zachariae W. Nasmyth K. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 2183-2196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), when the APC is active. Unlike securin (16Salah S.M. Nasmyth K. Chromosoma (Berl.). 2000; 109: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), Spo13 did not re-accumulate in metaphase II cells or thereafter. Identification of a Novel APC Destruction Sequence in Spo13—Spo13 is one of the proteins we screened that contains no clearly identifiable D-box and KEN-box. To identify the regions of Spo13 important for APC-mediated destruction, we generated a number of fragments of Spo13 by PCR, translated them in vitro, and subjected them to APC reactions. A fragment of the Hsl1 protein was used as a positive control (29Burton J.L. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2381-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We found that the APC destruction sequence of Spo13 lies in the N terminus (Fig. 2A), as all the N-terminal fragments were efficiently ubiquitinated, while a C-terminal fragment (residues 104–292) was not. The first 15 amino acids of Spo13 contain a sequence (RxxL) that is reminiscent of a D-box. However, fragments lacking this region (residues 15–195 and 1-(Δ6–9)-195) were still ubiquitinated efficiently (Fig. 2B). A fragment lacking the first 30 amino acids of Spo13 (residues 30–195) was resistant to APC-mediated ubiquitination, strongly implicating amino acids 16–30 as the critical residues (Fig. 2B). Analysis of 3-residue truncations through this region revealed that while a fragment of amino acids 24–195 was ubiquitinated by the APC, a fragment of amino acids 27–195 was not, suggesting that residues 25–27 are required for the APC-mediated ubiquitination of Spo13 (Fig. 2B). The amino acid sequence of this region of Spo13 does not closely resemble any previously described APC destruction motif. To identify the destruction sequence of Spo13, we generated single point mutations (to alanine) in amino acids 24–32 in PCR fragments spanning residues 1–195 of the Spo13 protein. Mutation of three residues inhibited APC activity toward Spo13 (Fig. 2C). Two amino acids, glutamate 28 and asparagine 32, were partly required for full activity. The most critical residue was the leucine at position 26, which was required for the appearance of ubiquitinated products. To confirm the importance of this residue, we performed a time course in vitro using either full-length Spo13 or Spo13-(L26A) (hereafter referred to as Spo13-db). While high molecular weight ubiquitination products and substrate depletion were seen rapidly with wild-type Spo13, neither was observed with Spo13-db, even after 1 h of reaction (Fig. 2D). Thus, ubiquitination of Spo13 in vitro can be largely prevented by a single point mutation of leucine 26. Three residues (Leu26, Glu28, and Asn32) are therefore the key determinants of APC ubiquitination of Spo13, suggesting that the destruction sequence is LxExxxN (Fig. 2E). APCCdc20 Ubiquitination of Spo13—The APC activator used in these experiments, Cdh1, is not thought to contribute significantly to budding yeast meiosis (13Oelschlaegel T. Schwickart M. Matos J. Bogdanova A. Camasses A. Havlis J. Shevchenko A. Zachariae W. Cell. 2005; 120: 773-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14Penkner A.M. Prinz S. Ferscha S. Klein F. Cell. 2005; 120: 789-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), suggesting that Spo13 is targeted in vivo by the APC in combination with one or both of the other activators, Cdc20 and Ama1. We found that cells lacking Ama1 efficiently degrade Spo13 in anaphase I (data not shown), suggesting that Cdc20 is the relevant activator. However, as meiotic cells lacking Cdc20 do not progress into anaphase I, we could not assess the importance of Cdc20 in Spo13 destruction in vivo. We therefore tested Spo13 ubiquitination by APCCdc20 in vitro. Active Cdc20 cannot be produced in insect cells or bacteria, but small amounts can be prepared by translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. Using this approach, we found that APCCdc20 was an effective catalyst of Spo13 ubiquitination and that this activity was greatly reduced when Spo13-db was used as substrate (Fig. 2F). These results support the possibility that APCCdc20 promotes Spo13 degradation in anaphase I. Analysis of the spo13-db Mutant in Mitotic Cells—To demonstrate that the L26A mutation stabilizes the protein by preventing its degradation in vivo, we expressed either wild-type SPO13 or spo13-db from the GAL1–10 promoter in cells arrested in G1 phase. After induction for 2 h, transcription and translation were simultaneously repressed with cycloheximide and dextrose, and protein stability was monitored over the next hour. While Spo13 was degraded over the time course of the assay, the Spo13-db protein was fully stabilized (Fig. 3A). Thus, the Spo13-db mutant is resistant to APC-mediated ubiquitination both in vitro and in vivo. Previous work suggests that Spo13 may act as an APC inhibitor (23Katis V.L. Matos J. Mori S. Shirahige K. Zachariae W. Nasmyth K. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 2183-2196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Consistent with this possibility, overexpression of SPO13 in mitotic cells is known to delay the onset of anaphase and reduce cell viability (30Lee B.H. Amon A. Prinz S. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1672-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 31Shonn M.A. McCarroll R. Murray A.W. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1659-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Our evidence that Spo13 is an APC substrate raised the possibility that SPO13 overexpression blocks mitotic progression and causes lethality by competitively inhibiting substrate binding to the APC. However, we found that overexpression of the Spo13-db mutant, which presumably interacts poorly with the APC, caused a delay in anaphase onset and mitotic exit that was greater than the delay induced by overexpression of wild-type Spo13 (Fig. 3B). These results argue that Spo13 is not delaying anaphase onset and causing cell death by binding the APC but through some other mechanism. To further investigate the possibility that Spo13-induced toxicity is due to inhibition of the APC, we analyzed the effects of Spo13 in a yeast strain engineered to survive in the absence of APC function (3Thornton B.R. Toczyski D.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1090-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Overexpression of SPO13 in this strain was lethal (Fig. 3C), further indicating that the toxic effects of Spo13 are not due to APC inhibition but due to interference with some other essential cellular process. Analysis of the spo13-db Mutant in Meiosis—To assess the consequences of the L26A mutation in meiosis, we replaced the endogenous SPO13 gene with the spo13-db gene in the SK1 yeast strain, which is used commonly for meiotic experiments. Cells were released into synchronous meiosis and the status of Spo13 was monitored by indirect immunofluorescence against C-terminal HA epitopes. While wild-type Spo13-HA3 disappeared abruptly in anaphase I cells (Fig. 1A), the Spo13-db-HA3 protein was maintained in anaphase I cells (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, Spo13-db-HA3 could be found in meiosis II cells, whereas wild-type Spo13 was absent (Figs. 1A and 4A). We also examined protein stability by immunoblot analysis. While the Spo13-HA protein peaked and disappeared 3 h after release into meiosis, Spo13-db-HA remained at significant levels for 2–3 additional hours (Fig. 4B). In summary, the L26A mutation stabilized Spo13 through the meiotic divisions. The L26A mutation did not lead to a loss of Spo13 function in meiosis. 95% of spo13-db yeast formed tetrads after sporulation, compared with 97% of SPO13 cells and only 7% of cells carrying a deletion in the SPO13 gene. To assess the phenotype of the L26A mutation in more detail, we compared meiotic progression in SPO13 and spo13-db cells. Progression through the two chromosome divisions was very similar in the two strains, as similar accumulation of 2n and 4n DNA species was seen (Fig. 4C). Thus, the continued presence of Spo13 during and after anaphase I did not have a profound effect on meiotic progression. We also dissected tetrads to assess viability. Wild-type yeast were 98% viable and spo13-db yeast were 97% viable, indicating no loss of viability from the continued presence of Spo13 in late stages of meiosis. The APC is necessary for meiotic progression, as yeast with reduced APC function arrest in meiotic metaphase I with unsegregated chromosomes (13Oelschlaegel T. Schwickart M. Matos J. Bogdanova A.

Cell. 2005; 120: 789-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Other than this observation, and the characterization of yeast lacking the AMA1 gene (17Cooper K.F.

A. 2000; 97: 14548-14553Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), little is known about how the APC contributes to the unique regulatory features of the meiotic program. Our observation that Spo13 is an APC substrate in anaphase I demonstrates that the APC does have functions in the control of meiosis-specific processes. The primary sequence of Spo13 contains no close matches to either of the well described APC recognition sequences, the D- or KEN-boxes (6Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar, 8Pfleger C.M. Kirschner M.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 655-665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we identified a novel destruction sequence, LxExxxN, that is required for its ubiquitination by the APC in vitro and its degradation in vivo. The amino acid requirement of the Spo13 destruction box sequence is distinct from any other previously described APC substrate destruction box sequences, although it resembles slightly the end of the D-box sequence (RxxLxxxxN). Spo13 could not have been predicted to be an APC substrate solely on the basis of its sequence. We suspect that there are a number of degenerate sequences that can act as destruction motifs, and the Spo13 sequence is one such variant. Clearly, more analysis of the sequence requirements of D- and KEN-boxes is needed before we can identify novel APC substrates based on their primary sequence alone. Sister-chromatid pairs make monopolar attachments in meiosis I and switch to bipolar attachments in meiosis II. A failure to switch attachment modes from monopolar to bipolar would be catastrophic for high fidelity chromosome segregation. The regulatory molecules that mediate the switch from monopolar to bipolar attachment are currently unknown, but the APC is an excellent candidate because it is activated just before the monopolin complex is lost from chromosomes in anaphase I (16Salah S.M. Nasmyth K. Chromosoma (Berl.). 2000; 109: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Spo13 is a key regulator of monopolar chromosome attachment, as spo13Δ cells fail to load adequate amounts of the monopolin complex and make mostly bipolar attachments at metaphase I (23Katis V.L.

How Spo13 specifically promotes monopolin loading is unknown, but our observations that Spo13 is an APC substrate suggested that degradation of Spo13 allows the unloading of the monopolin complex in anaphase I. However, spores from cells containing the stabilized spo13-db mutant were fully viable, demonstrating that degradation of Spo13 alone is not the only mechanism to ensure unloading of monopolin in anaphase I. How else might the APC contribute to the chromosome attachment switch? We could find no evidence from either our in vivo or in vitro assays that the known subunits of the monopolin complex (Mam1, Lrs4, and Csm1) (19Toth A. Rabitsch K.P. Galova M. Schleiffer A.

At least two other regulators of monopolar chromosome attachment, the protein kinase Cdc5 (32Clyne R.K. Katis V.L. Jessop L. Benjamin K.R. Herskowitz I. Lichten M. Nasmyth K. Nat.

We introduced stabilized mutant versions of these proteins into spo13-db cells to test if their degradation contributes to loss of monopolin. However, the triple mutant (spo13-db, cdc5-db, dbf4-db) displayed normal meiotic progression and spore viability (data not shown). Furthermore, in anaphase I, both the Mam1 and Lrs4 subunits of the monopolin complex efficiently disappeared from chromosomes in the triple mutant, similar to wild-type cells (data not shown). Thus, additional mechanisms must exist to drive the down-regulation of monopolar chromosome attachment between the meiotic divisions. We thank L. Holt, G. Tully, M.

https://openalex.org/W2018703956,"Prnp knockout mice that overexpress an amino-truncated form of PrPc (deltaPrP) are ataxic and display cerebellar cell loss and premature death. Studies on the molecular and intracellular events that trigger cell death in these mutants may contribute to elucidate the functions of PrPc and to the design of treatments for prion disease. Here we examined the effects of Bcl-2 overexpression in neurons on the development of the neurological syndrome and cerebellar pathology of deltaPrP. We show that deltaPrP overexpression activates the stress-associated kinases ERK1-2 in reactive astroglia, p38 and the phosphorylation of p53, which leads to the death of cerebellar neurons in mutant mice. We found that the expression of deltaPrP in cell lines expressing very low levels of PrPc strongly induces the activation of apoptotic pathways, thereby leading to caspase-3 activation and cell death, which can be prevented by coexpressing Bcl-2. Finally, we corroborate in vivo that neuronal-directed Bcl-2 overexpression in deltaPrP mice (deltaPrP Bcl-2) markedly reduces caspase-3 activation, glial activation, and neuronal cell death in cerebellum by improving locomotor deficits and life expectancy."
https://openalex.org/W2126616908,"Escherichia coli chaperonin GroEL and GroES assist in folding of a wide variety of substrate proteins in the molecular mass range of approximately 50 kDa, using cis mechanism, but limited information is available on how they assist in folding of larger proteins. Considering that the central cavity of GroEL can accommodate a non-native protein of approximately 60 kDa, it is important to study the GroEL-GroES-assisted folding of substrate proteins that are large enough for cis encapsulation. In this study, we have reported the mechanism of GroEL/GroES-assisted in vivo and in vitro folding of a 69 kDa monomeric E. coli protein maltodextrin glucosidase (MalZ). Coexpression of GroEL and GroES in E. coli causes a 2-fold enhancement of exogenous MalZ activity in vivo. In vitro, GroEL and GroES in the presence of ATP give rise to a 7-fold enhancement in MalZ refolding. Neither GroEL nor single ring GroEL (SR1) in the presence or absence of ATP could enhance the in vitro folding of MalZ. GroES could not encapsulate GroEL-bound MalZ. All these experimental findings suggested that GroEL/GroES-assisted folding of MalZ followed trans mechanism, whereas denatured MalZ and GroES bound to the opposite rings of a GroEL molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1979253882,"Mutant membrane proteins are frequently retained in the early secretory pathway by a quality control system, thereby causing disease. An example are mutants of the vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R) leading to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Transport-defective V2Rs fall into two classes: those retained exclusively in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and those reaching post-ER compartments such as the ER/Golgi intermediate compartment. Although numerous chemical or pharmacological chaperones that rescue the transport of ER-retained membrane proteins are known, substances acting specifically in post-ER compartments have not been described as yet. Using the L62P (ER-retained) and Y205C (reaching post-ER compartments) mutants of the V2R as a model, we show here that the cell-penetrating peptide penetratin and its synthetic analog KLAL rescue the transport of the Y205C mutant. In contrast, the location of the L62P mutant is not influenced by either peptide because the peptides are unable to enter the ER. We also show data indicating that the peptide-mediated transport rescue is associated with an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations.

EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Mutations in the V2R gene cause X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), a disease characterized by the kidney's inability to concentrate urine. The majority of the mutations result in transport-defective receptors (3Oksche A. Rosenthal W. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), which are recognized and intracellularly retained by the quality control system (QCS). Besides NDI, transport-defective membrane proteins play a role in many other diseases (4Aridor M. Hannan L.A. Traffic. 2000; 1: 836-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 5Schülein R. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 151: 45-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The QCS is located mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and allows only correctly folded and/or assembled proteins to leave the early secretory pathway and to reach their final cellular destination (6Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 7Kleizen B. Braakman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Several components have been described to contribute to the QCS: (i) the lectin chaperones calnexin and calreticulin involved in the quality control of glycoproteins; (ii) “classical” chaperones such as the IgG heavy chain-binding protein, endoplasmin/grp90, and the ER-resident DnaJ-like proteins ERdj1-ERdj5; and (iii) enzymes such as protein-disulfide isomerase and the thiol oxidoreductase ERp57 (8Sitia R. Braakman I. Nature. 2003; 426: 891-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Misfolded or unassembled membrane proteins initially display a prolonged association with components of the QCS. They may then either accumulate in the ER, leading to the unfolded protein response (9Pahl H.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 683-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), and/or be subjected to proteasomal degradation (10Sommer T. Wolf D.H. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 11Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that the QCS is not restricted to the ER but involves post-ER compartments such as the ER/Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (12Lotti L.V. Torrisi M.R. Erra M.C. Bonatti S. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 13Yamamoto K. Fujii R. Toyofuku Y. Saito T. Koseki H. Hsu V.W. Aoe T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3082-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). For the V2R, we have shown recently that transport-defective mutant receptors fall into two classes: mutants like L62P are retained exclusively in the ER, whereas others like Y205C escape to the ERGIC (14Hermosilla R. Oueslati M. Donalies U. Schönenberger E. Krause E. Oksche A. Rosenthal W. Schülein R. Traffic. 2004; 5: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the ERGIC, they are recognized by an as yet incompletely understood mechanism. Two strategies may lead to the successful treatment of diseases caused by transport-defective membrane proteins. The first comprises the use of substances promoting correct folding, thereby reducing the interaction with components of the QCS. In the case of receptors, membrane-permeable ligands may serve this purpose. Recently, such “pharmacological chaperones” were used to rescue the folding and plasma membrane transport of mutant G protein-coupled receptors such as, for example, the V2R (15Morello J.P. Salahpour A. Laperriere A. Bernier V. Arthus M.V. Lonergan M. Petaja-Repo U. Angers S. Morin D. Bichet D.G. Bouvier M. J. Clin.

The pharmacological chaperones have the advantage of acting protein-specific and at low concentrations. The known disadvantage is that tightly bound ligands, mostly receptor antagonists, cannot easily be removed from the protein (16Wüller S. Wiesner B. Löffler A. Furkert J. Krause G. Hermosilla R.

A second, not intensively pursued strategy includes the development of inhibitors of the QCS. This approach should prove useful in cases in which mutant proteins still have some functional activity but are nevertheless retained by the QCS, i.e. if the QCS is overprotective. A well known example is the ΔF508 mutant of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein found in 70% of patients with cystic fibrosis (19Pasyk E.A. Foskett J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12347-12350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Here, we describe a new class of substances that rescue the transport of folding-defective membrane proteins. Using the L62P (ER-retained) and Y205C (reaching post-ER compartments) mutants of the V2R as model proteins, we show that the cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) penetratin and KLAL (20Lindgren M. Hallbrink M. Prochiantz A. Langel U. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 99-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 21Lundberg P. Langel U. J. Mol.

Cells were incubated overnight, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and transferred immediately into a self-made chamber. 4Details are available upon request. Cells were covered with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and trypan blue was added to a final concentration of 0.05%. After 1 min of staining, GFP and trypan blue fluorescence signals were visualized at room temperature on a Zeiss LSM 510 META inverted confocal laser scanning microscope (objective lens, ×100/1.3 oil; optical section, <0.8 μm; multitrack mode; GFP, λex = 488 nm, argon laser; 500-530-nm band-pass filter; trypan blue, λex = 543 nm, heliumneon laser, 560-nm long-pass filter). The overlay of both signals was computed using Zeiss LSM 510 acquisition software (Release 3.2 SP2). Images were imported into Adobe Photoshop Version 5.5 software, and contrast was adjusted to approximate the original image. In the case of the cell-surface integrity assay, cells were stained for 15 min with trypan blue prior to recording. In the case of the receptor/peptide colocalization experiments, CFP-tagged receptors and 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (FLUOS)-labeled peptides were analyzed at room temperature using the same microscope (objective lens, ×40/1.3 oil; optical section, <0.8 μm; multitrack mode; CFP, λex = 810 nm, Chameleon™ laser, 430-498-nm band-pass filter; FLUOS, λex = 488 nm, argon laser, 500-550-nm band-pass filter).

Visualization of GFP-tagged Receptors in Stably Transfected HEK 293 Cell Clones by IEM—Cell clones expressing similar amounts of the L62P and Y205C mutants were fixed in 2% freshly prepared formaldehyde plus 0.2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 2 h at room temperature. After three washes with phosphate buffer, the cells were scraped in 1% gelatin, spun down, and resuspended in 12% gelatin at 37 °C. Subsequently, the cells were centrifuged, and the gelatin was solidified on ice. The pellet was cut into small blocks, and the samples were infiltrated with 2.3 m sucrose in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) overnight at 4 °C. The blocks were mounted on pins and frozen in liquid nitrogen until processing into 50-60-nm cryosections. Sections were double-labeled with primary antibodies and detected by protein A-gold as described previously (26Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Gigengack S. Lienhard G.E. James D.E. J.

Cells were washed three times with the same solution without Fluo-4/AM and Pluronic F-127 and supplemented with penetratin, KLAL, KALK, TAT, or thapsigargin (1 μm). The optical measurements were performed using the LSM 510 META inverted confocal laser scanning microscope (objective lens, ×63/1.4 oil; optical slice, <3.4 μm; single-track mode; GFP, λex = 488 nm, argon laser, 505-nm long-pass filter). Fluorescence images were recorded in a time series (2 s, 300 images) and computed as described above. Pulse-Chase Experiments—HEK 293 cells (4 × 106) were grown for 24 h in a 100-mm diameter dish and transiently transfected with 6 μg of plasmid DNA and Lipofectamine according to the supplier's recommendations. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection with trypsin/EDTA (pH 7.4), washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), and starved for 45 min in 5 ml methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were then pulse-labeled with Expre35S35S protein labeling mixture (150-200 μCi/ml) for 25 min at 37 °C and incubated in 4 ml of stop medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 1.5 mm methionine, and 0.5 mm cysteine) at 37 °C for chase periods of 1, 2, and 4 h. Cells were harvested, and labeled proteins were extracted for 1 h with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na-EDTA, 40 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml Trasylol, and 100 mm benzamidine (pH 8.0)). Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 47,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and labeled proteins were recovered from the supernatant by overnight incubation at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose beads loaded with anti-GFP antiserum. Beads were sedimented at 13,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C and washed twice with buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm Na-EDTA (pH 7.4) and once with the same buffer without NaCl. Proteins were solubilized in 40 μl of Laemmli buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue (pH 6.8)) and separated by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide). The gel was incubated for 25 min in a fixing solution of 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid, dried, and exposed for 4 days to radiographic film. Immunofluorescence—HEK 293 cells (1 × 105) were spread on a poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslip (12 mm in diameter) and incubated for 24 h. Cells were transiently transfected with 125 ng of plasmid DNA and FuGENE 6™ according to the supplier's recommendations. 18 h after transfection, the cell culture medium was supplemented with bafilomycin A1 (1 μm) or vehicle and incubated for another 4 h. The immunofluorescence procedure using anti-ERGIC-53 or anti-58-kDa Golgi protein antibody was carried out as described (14Hermosilla R. Oueslati M. Donalies U. Schönenberger E. Krause E. Oksche A. Rosenthal W. Schülein R. Traffic. 2004; 5: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Treatment of Cells with the Peptides, Bafilomycin A1, and Brefeldin A (BFA)—Bafilomycin A1 treatment of cells was carried out for 4 h at a final concentration of 1 μm. Treatment of cells with penetratin or KLAL was performed for 12 h using the peptide concentrations indicated under “Results.” In receptor/peptide colocalization studies, peptide treatment was performed for only 6 h due to the reduced stability of the FLUOS-labeled peptides (peptide pretreatment = 2 h plus an additional 4 h together with bafilomycin A1). Combined treatment with penetratin (1 μm) and BFA (0.5 μg/ml) was carried out for 18 h. Peptide Synthesis and Labeling—Peptides were synthesized automatically (ABI 433A peptide synthesizer) by the solid-phase method using standard Fmoc chemistry in a batch-wise mode as described previously for the synthesis of corticotropin-releasing factor analogs (27Beyermann M. Fechner K. Furkert J. Krause E. Bienert M. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 3324-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Carboxyfluorescein (FLUOS) was N-terminally incorporated after the last Fmoc cleavage on peptide resin via the FLUOS N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (2 eq in N,N-dimethylformamide overnight). After final cleavage/deprotection using trifluoroacetic acid/H2O (9:1), crude peptides were purified by preparative HPLC to give final products of 95% purity according to HPLC analysis. The peptides were characterized by mass spectrometry, which yielded the expected masses. Cell-surface Biotinylation Assay—Stably transfected HEK 293 cells (9 × 105) were grown for 48 h in a 60-mm diameter dish to 80% confluence. The cell-surface biotinylation assay was carried out in the cold as described previously for transiently transfected HEK 293 cells (28Schülein R. Zühlke K. Krause G. Rosenthal W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8384-8392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Biotinylated proteins were detected by immunoblotting using polyclonal anti-GFP serum and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. Immunoprecipitation of Total Receptor Proteins—Immunoprecipitations were carried out in the cold. To immobilize polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies, protein A-Sepharose beads were incubated for 15 min in buffer A (0.3% N-dodecyl β-d-maltoside, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm aprotinin, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2.]octane, and 0.5 mm Igepal CA-630 (pH 8.0)) and then washed three times with the same buffer. The beads (10 mg for the lysate of cells from one 100-mm diameter dish) were then incubated overnight with polyclonal anti-GFP serum (1:200) in a final volume of 1 ml of buffer A. Buffer A was removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. For immunoprecipitation, stably transfected HEK 293 cells were grown on 100-mm diameter dishes for 48 h to 80% confluence. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in buffer A for 1 h. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The lysates were incubated for 3 h with the antibody-coupled protein A-Sepharose and washed twice with buffer A, twice with buffer B (same as buffer A but without detergent), twice with buffer C (same as buffer B but with 2 mm EDTA instead of CaCl2), and finally once with 12.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8). Precipitated proteins were eluted for 15 min at room temperature in Laemmli buffer (final concentrations of 60 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue (pH 6.8)), boiled for 2 min at 95 °C, and finally subjected to SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis using monoclonal anti-GFP antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Miscellaneous—Standard DNA preparations and manipulations were carried out. [3H]AVP binding to intact HEK 293 cells was carried out as described previously for transiently transfected COS.M6 cells (29Schülein R. Liebenhoff U. Müller H. Birnbaumer M. Rosenthal W. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Intracellular Localization of the NDI-causing V2R Mutants L62P and Y205C by Immunofluorescence and IEM—We have shown previously by immunofluorescence (14Hermosilla R. Oueslati M. Donalies U. Schönenberger E. Krause E. Oksche A. Rosenthal W. Schülein R. Traffic. 2004; 5: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) that the intracellularly retained NDI-causing V2R mutants fall into two classes: those retained in the ER (e.g. L62P) (Fig. 1A) and those reaching post-ER compartments such as the ERGIC and the Golgi apparatus (e.g. Y205C). This prompted us to search for post-ER-specific inhibitors of the QCS. To this end, we first confirmed the different intracellular locations of the receptor mutants L62P and Y205C by immunofluorescence (confocal laser scanning microscopy (LSM)) and refined these data by IEM. For immunofluorescence (Fig. 1B), HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding the C-terminally GFP-tagged V2R mutants L62P and Y205C. We have shown previously that the GFP tag influences neither the pharmacological nor trafficking properties of the V2R (30Oksche A. Dehe M. Schülein R. Wiesner B. Rosenthal W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The detection of a protein in the ERGIC or Golgi apparatus by immunofluorescence is difficult under steady-state conditions. The retrograde transport to the ER was therefore blocked by treating cells for 4 h with bafilomycin A1. Under these conditions, cycling proteins accumulate in the post-ER compartments and become easily detectable (31Palokangas H. Ying M. Vaananen K. Saraste J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3561-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 32Hauri H-P. Kappeler F. Andersson H. Appenzeller C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 587-596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ERGIC was visualized using antibodies against the marker protein ERGIC-53, and the Golgi apparatus using antibodies against the 58-kDa Golgi protein. In the case of the L62P mutant, we failed to detect a colocalization of the receptor's GFP fluorescence signals with either the ERGIC or Golgi marker (Fig. 1B), confirming the previously described retention of this mutant in the ER (see also Ref. 14Hermosilla R. Oueslati M. Donalies U. Schönenberger E. Krause E. Oksche A. Rosenthal W. Schülein R. Traffic. 2004; 5: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Y205C mutant accumulated in a perinuclear region. A substantial colocalization with the ERGIC marker and a weaker colocalization with the Golgi marker were observed, again in agreement with previous results (14Hermosilla R. Oueslati M. Donalies U. Schönenberger E. Krause E. Oksche A. Rosenthal W. Schülein R. Traffic. 2004; 5: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Localization of the mutant receptors by IEM was performed using stably transfected cell clones expressing similar amounts of L62P and Y205C (Fig. 2). (Receptor expression was monitored by quantifying the receptors' GFP fluorescence signals fluorometrically (data not shown).) Cells were double-labeled for ERGIC-53 (15-nm gold particles) and GFP (10-nm gold particles). Mutant L62P was detectable in the ER cisternae, whereas no label was found in the ERGIC and in other post-ER compartments (Fig. 2A; ERGIC-53-positive membranes are marked with an asterisk). An escape of minor amounts of L62P from the ER was detectable only when cell clones expressing very high levels of this mutant were used (data not shown). By contrast, Y205C-GFP was readily seen in the ERGIC (Fig. 2B; ERGIC-53-positive membranes are marked with an asterisk) and throughout the Golgi stack (Fig. 2C; the cis-side of the stack is indicated by the presence of ERGIC-53). Expression of the Y205C mutant in the ER was low in the stably transfected cell clone under steady-state conditions, in contrast to the situation in the transiently transfected cells, where bafilomycin A1 treatment was needed to facilitate detection of the Y205C mutant in post-ER compartments (see Fig. 1B and Ref. 14Hermosilla R. Oueslati M. Donalies U. Schönenberger E. Krause E. Oksche A. Rosenthal W. Schülein R. Traffic. 2004; 5: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This is explicable if one assumes that transient transfections lead to stronger overexpression and to more ER aggregates of the Y205C mutant. In summary, these data confirm that the transport-defective NDI-causing V2R mutants fall into two classes: those retained in the ER and those reaching post-ER compartments. Cell-surface Delivery of the Y205C Mutant of the V2RIsRescued by Treatment with Penetratin or KLAL—Experiments using CPPs as carriers indicated that they may improve trafficking of some misfolded V2Rs. 3M.

DNA photoaffinity labeling found that the Dpb4 subunit contacts extranucleosomal DNA 37–53 bp away from the entry/exit site of the nucleosome. Binding of Dpb4 to Isw2 and Itc2, the two largest subunits of ISW2, was found to require Dls1. Even after remodeling and nucleosome movement, Dpb4 tends to remain bound to its original binding site and likely serves as an anchor point for ISW2 on DNA. In vitro, only minor differences can be detected in the nucleosome binding and mobilization properties of ISW2 with or without Dpb4 and Dls1. Changes in the contacts of the largest subunit Itc1 with extranucleosomal DNA have, however, been found upon deletion of the Dpb4 and Dls1 dimer that may affect the nucleosome spacing properties of ISW2.

Chromatin is a repressive structure obstructing various cellular processes, including transcription, replication, recombination, and DNA repair. Chromatin is a dynamic structure regulated by many enzymes including ATP-dependent remodeling complexes that mobilize nucleosomes to expose or occlude various promoter regions for transcription (1Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y. Kingston R.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes are classified into major sub-families based on their catalytic ATPase subunits, such as SNF2, ISWI (Imitation Switch), 4The abbreviations used are: ISWI, Imitation Switch; TBE, Tris borate-EDTA; CHRAC, chromatin accessibility complex. 4The abbreviations used are: ISWI, Imitation Switch; TBE, Tris borate-EDTA; CHRAC, chromatin accessibility complex.

Different subfamily members show distinct substrate specificities and nucleosome remodeling activities. For instance, the ATPase activity of SWI/SNF is stimulated by either free or nucleosomal DNA, whereas the ISWI and CHD proteins are stimulated primarily by nucleosomes (3Cote J. Quinn J. Workman J.L.

ISWI proteins require the flexible N-terminal tail of histone H4 to efficiently dock its translocase on the nucleosome at SHL2 (8Dang W. Kagalwala M.N. Bartholomew B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7388-7396Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and for stimulating the ATPase activity and inducing nucleosome mobility (9Clapier C.R. Langst G. Corona D.F. Becker P.B.

In contrast, the ISWI complexes mediate movement of nucleosomes in cis without permanent displacement from DNA or disrupting the final nucleosome structure (14Hamiche A. Sandaltzopoulos R. Gdula D.A.

Cell. 1999; 97: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two ISWI ATPases have been identified and characterized, Isw1 and Isw2 (16Tsukiyama T. Palmer J. Landel C.C. Shiloach J. Wu C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 686-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Initially, Isw2 (130 kDa) was found to bind to Itc1 (145 kDa), and later two histone fold proteins Dpb4 and Dls1 were also identified to be components of the ISW2 complex (17Iida T. Araki H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18McConnell A.D. Gelbart M.E. Tsukiyama T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2605-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Dpb4 (22.0 kDa) is a homolog of human HuCHRAC-17 and Drosophila CHRAC-14, and Dls1 (18.8 kDa) is a homolog of human HuCHRAC-15 and Drosophila CHRAC-16. ISW2 appears to be an ortholog of human and Drosophila CHRAC complexes, which is further supported by the limited homology of Itc1 with human and Drosophila ACF1. Dpb4 is also part of DNA polymerase ∊ and is involved in the processive synthesis of both the leading and lagging strands of DNA (19Ohya T. Maki S. Kawasaki Y. Sugino A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3846-3852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dls1 (Dpb3-like subunit 1) is homologous to Dpb3, another subunit of DNA polymerase ∊, that interacts with Dpb4. These proteins show a striking similarity to the histone fold domains of the mammalian transcription factors NF-YC (CBF-C) and NF-YB (CBF-A), respectively, and supposedly interact with each other via the “handshake” motif similar to the H2A/H2B histone dimer (19Ohya T. Maki S. Kawasaki Y. Sugino A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3846-3852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to the CHRAC complex, yeast ISW2 slides mononucleosomes from the end to the center of DNA (15Langst G. Bonte E.J. Corona D.F. Becker P.B.

ISW2 has been shown to preferentially bind nucleosome substrates containing ∼70 bp of extranucleosomal DNA at one entry/exit site of the nucleosome (25Kagalwala M.N. Glaus B.J. Dang W. Zofall M. Bartholomew B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2092-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). ISW2 interacts with three nucleosomal and extranucleosomal regions. Itc1 and Isw2 bind to the region 2 helical turns (SHL2) from the dyad axis and a region closest to the entry/exit site. The Itc1 subunit makes extensive contacts with extranucleosomal DNA. The interactions of Itc1 with extranucleosomal DNA are likely to be involved in the directional binding and sliding of nucleosomes as well as the spacing of nucleosome arrays. An optimal length of extranucleosomal DNA has been shown to act in concert with the histone H4 tail to direct ISW2 to the critical internal contact site on the nucleosome for efficient nucleosome mobilization (8Dang W. Kagalwala M.N. Bartholomew B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7388-7396Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In vivo, ISW2 functions in parallel with the Sin3-Rpd3 histone deacetylase complex to repress early meiotic genes upon recruitment by Ume6 and creates a DNase I-inaccessible chromatin structure through the regulation of nucleosome positioning (26Fazzio T.G. Kooperberg C. Goldmark J.P. Neal C. Basom R. Delrow J. Tsukiyama T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6450-6460Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The histone fold dimer Dpb4/Dls1 has been shown to be required for generation of some ISW2-specific chromatin structures, repression of many ISW2-regulated genes, and the function of ISW2 at telomeric regions (17Iida T. Araki H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Tsukiyama and colleagues (18McConnell A.D. Gelbart M.E. Tsukiyama T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2605-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) have shown that Dls1p is not required in vivo for binding of ISW2 to chromatin but is required for ISW2 remodeling and for repression of ISW2 target genes. The extent to which these histone fold subunits are required for transcription and nucleosome mobilization seems to vary among different targets. In vitro, the Drosophila and human CHRAC histone fold dimer was found to interact with the ACF1 subunit (21Hartlepp K.F. Fernandez-Tornero C. Eberharter A. Grune T. Muller C.W. Becker P.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9886-9896Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). More importantly, excess histone dimer has been shown to enhance nucleosome binding and movement by hACF1-SNF2h (27Kukimoto I. Elderkin S. Grimaldi M. Oelgeschlager T. VargaWeisz P.D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 265-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recombinant human CHRAC histone fold dimer binds to DNA but not nucleosomes (28Poot R.A. Dellaire G. Hulsmann B.B. Grimaldi M.A. Corona D.F. Becker P.B. Bickmore W.A. Varga-Weisz P.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3377-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The roles of the histone fold dimer of yeast ISW2 in nucleosome binding and sliding remain unexplored. We have shown that Dpb4 specifically interacts with the extranucleosomal DNA at least 37 bp away from the edge of the nucleosome by site-specific DNA photoaffinity labeling and has no detectable contact with nucleosomal DNA. During remodeling by ISW2, Dpb4 did not readily track along DNA as nucleosomes are moved on to extranucleosomal DNA. These data suggest that Dpb4, likely in concert with Dls1, act as an anchor point on DNA for ISW2. We have compared ISW2 binding and remodeling with ISW2, lacking the two histone-fold subunits to test whether the histone dimer plays a role in nucleosome binding and mobilization by ISW2. Although only minor effects can be detected for nucleosome binding affinity and sliding efficiency, changes in Itc1 contacts with extranucleosomal DNA have been observed. These data suggest the histone fold dimer may help to stabilize the interaction of Itc1 with extranucleosomal DNA. DNA Probes—The nucleosome positioning sequence “601” was obtained from the pGEM-3Z/601 plasmid (from Jon Widom) (29Lowary P.T. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 19-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). DNA probes with 601 and various extents of flanking extranucleosomal DNA were synthesized by PCR with HotMaster Mix from Eppendorf AG. One of the PCR primers (20 pmol) was radiolabeled using 40 units of OptiKinase (US Biochemicals) and 5 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a 40-μl reaction. The PCR products were purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and analyzed by native PAGE and denaturing PAGE containing 8 m urea. DNA Photoaffinity Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation— Site-specific photoreactive and radiolabeled DNA probes were synthesized using a template containing a 601-nucleosome positioning sequence as described previously (20Kassabov S.R.

Mononucleosomes were reconstituted using purified photoreactive probes by the salt dilution method (20Kassabov S.R. Henry N.M. Zofall M. Tsukiyama T. Bartholomew B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7524-7534Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Mononucleosomes (2.8 pmol) were incubated with or without FLAG-purified ISW2 at 30 °C for 30 min in a 25-μl reaction containing 30 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.8, 65 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Four microliters were analyzed on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 38.9:1.1, in 0.5× TBE) to assess ISW2 binding. In all experiments, >90% of nucleosomes were bound to ISW2. Reactions were irradiated for 2 min (310 nm, 2.65 milliwatt/cm2) and then digested sequentially with 4.6 units of DNase I (Ambion) and 20 units of S1 nuclease (US Biochemicals) (30Sengupta S.M. Persinger J. Bartholomew B. Peterson C.L. Methods (Orlando). 1999; 19: 434-446Google Scholar). A final concentration of 0.4% SDS was added to the samples after DNase I digestion to disrupt protein-DNA complexes. Samples were analyzed by 14 or 4–20% SDS-PAGE and cross-linked ISW2 subunits visualized by phosphorimaging. Colloidal blue staining (Owl Pro-Blue) was performed for the 14% SDS-PAGE prior to phosphorimaging. For immunoprecipitation of Dpb4, binding reactions were scaled up to 100 μl. After DNase I and S1 nuclease digestion, the pH of the reaction was adjusted to 7.0 with 7 μl of 0.5 m Tris base and reactions diluted 4-fold with precooled immunoprecipitation buffer containing 25 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. One microliter of anti-Dpb4 antibody (from Akio Sugino) was added and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Samples were incubated for another hour at 4 °C with 10 μl of equilibrated EZView protein A-agarose (Sigma) and gentle agitation. Agarose beads were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer and resuspended in 35 μlof SDS gel loading buffer. Samples were denatured and analyzed on a 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Remodeling reactions that were cross-linked were cooled to 20 °C for 5 min before the addition of ATP. ATP was added to a final concentration of 90 μm and incubated for an additional 5 min. Samples with or without ATP were irradiated for 5 s and digested as described above and analyzed by 4–20% SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. Generation of DLS1 Deletion Strain—The open reading frame YJL065C (DLS1) was deleted in the strain YTT480 (MATa ade2-1 can1–100 his3–11,15 leu2–3,112 trp1-1 ura3-1 RAD5+ pep4::HIS3 isw2-2FLAG) containing FLAG-tagged Isw2 by PCR-based gene deletion using URA3 as the selection marker and is referred to as YMK1010 (31Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2613) Google Scholar). Transformation was performed using the yeast-TRAFO procedure as described previously (32Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar) and appropriate colonies selected on uracil minus plates. Knock-out of the DLS1 gene was confirmed by PCR for deletion at both junctions. Affinity Purification of ISW2 and ISW2ΔDls1 Complexes— The ISW2 and ISWΔDls1 complexes were purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain YTT480 and YMK1010, respectively, both bearing a FLAG epitope-tagged version of the ISW2 gene. The ISW2 complex was affinity-purified from S100 extract by batch binding to anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma) (10 μl of anti-FLAG M2 beads/ml of whole cell extract) and eluted as described previously (16Tsukiyama T.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2092-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Hydroxyl Radical Footprinting—ISW2 binding reactions were carried out in a 25-μl reaction as described previously (25Kagalwala M.N. Glaus B.J. Dang W. Zofall M. Bartholomew B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2092-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) without the addition of ATP. The cleavage reaction was performed as described previously (33Tullius T.D. Dombroski B.A. Churchill M.E. Kam L. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 537-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), except that the final concentrations of Fe(II), H2O2, ascorbate, and EDTA were 280 μm, 0.17%, 5.7 mm, and 220 μm, respectively, and terminated by the addition of 100 μlof5 m ammonium acetate, 5 mm thiourea, and 10 mm EDTA. Nucleosome Binding and Sliding Assays—ISW2 binding reactions (25 μl) were at 30 °C for 30 min in 30 mm NaOH-HEPES, pH 7.8, 65 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Remodeling reactions contained 100 μm ATP (Roche Applied Science), and 5-μl samples were removed from each reaction at different time points and stopped with [γ-S]ATP (2.5 mm) and sonicated salmon sperm DNA (1 mg/ml). Binding and remodeling reactions were analyzed by 4% native PAGE (acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio of 36:1, 0.5× TBE, 4 °C) and phosphorimaging. All lanes were normalized based on total signal and the fraction bound or mobilized calculated by comparing the amount of unbound or immobilized nucleosomes in each lane to nucleosomes in the control lane with no ISW2 added. Exonuclease III Footprinting— Saturating amounts of ISW2 or ISW2ΔDls1 were incubated with nucleosomes containing 70 bp of extranucleosomal DNA at one entry/exit site in a typical ISW2 reaction at 30 °C for 30 min. A titration of exonuclease III (0.5–4 units, New England Biolabs) was added to 12.5-μl of the ISW2 binding reaction. Digestion was performed at 30 °C for 30 s and stopped by the addition of 95% formamide containing 0.0625% bromphenol blue and 0.0625% xylene cyanol FF. Samples were denatured by heating at 90 °C for 3 min and analyzed by denaturing PAGE containing 8 m urea. Dpb4 Interacts with Extranucleosomal DNA in the Nucleosome— DNA photoaffinity labeling was used to detect contacts of the two histone fold subunits of ISW2 with DNA due to binding of the ISW2 complex to nucleosomes. Twenty-three different DNA photoaffinity probes were used to topologically map the location of the histone fold subunits of ISW2 with nucleosomal and extranucleosomal DNA (25Kagalwala M.N. Glaus B.J. Dang W. Zofall M. Bartholomew B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2092-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of one of the histone fold proteins was detected within extranucleosomal DNA from–126 to –110 bp from the dyad axis or 37–53 bp from the entry/exit site of the nucleosome (Fig. 1, A and C). The identity of the cross-linked histone fold subunit was verified by comparison of the electrophoretic mobilities of the cross-linked protein with that of the stained smaller subunits (data not shown). Cross-linked Dpb4 was further verified by immunoprecipitation (as shown in Fig. 1B, comparing lanes 4 and 5 with lanes 1–3 and 6). No cross-linked Dpb4 was detected in regions other than extranucleosomal DNA, indicating that it likely does not interact with nucleosomal DNA (Fig. 1A, lanes 10 – 46, and Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 6). The association of Dpb4 with extranucleosomal DNA corresponded to the same region as that of strong Itc1 cross-linking (25Kagalwala M.N. Glaus B.J. Dang W. Zofall M. Bartholomew B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2092-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Dpb4 Does Not Retain Its Position Relative to the Edge of the Nucleosome after Remodeling—Photocross-linking of ISW2 subunits was used to monitor the location of Dpb4 after ISW2 remodeling of nucleosomes containing 75, 104, and 163 bp of extranucleosomal DNA at one entry/exit site. These nucleosomes are moved 30–90 bp depending on the length of extranucleosomal DNA, and nucleosome movement was earlier determined by site-directed mapping (Fig. 2A and results not shown) (34Zofall M. Persinger J. Kassabov S.R. Bartholomew B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). If Dpb4 maintains the same distance from the edge of the nucleosome after remodeling, then cross-linking of Dpb4 should be eliminated at the DNA position originally 110 and 111 bp from the dyad axis. After ISW2 remodeling of nucleosomes with 75 bp of extranucleosomal DNA, this DNA position is moved 30 – 40 bp, such that it is 70 – 80 bp from the dyad axis (Fig. 2, A and C). Contrary to expectations, cross-linking of Dpb4 at the original position 110 and 111 bp from the dyad axis was not reduced when ISW2 remodeled nucleosomes with 75 bp of extranucleosomal DNA (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2, and Fig. 2C). This position was moved even closer until it was inside the nucleosome by increasing extranucleosomal DNA to 104 and 163 bp, such that after remodeling, the original position 110/111 bp from the dyad axis was moved 50 – 60 or 20–30 bp from the dyad axis, respectively (Fig. 2A). Under these conditions, the efficiency of Dpb4 cross-linking was reduced 3.5-fold (50 – 60 bp from the dyad axis) or 6-fold (20–30 bp from the dyad axis) after remodeling (Fig. 2B, lanes 7–10, and Fig. 2C). These data suggest that Dpb4 is partially displaced when the DNA to which it is bound is pushed inside the nucleosome, but remarkably even then some Dpb4 is still retained at the original position on DNA. DNA cross-linking of nucleosomes with 104 bp of extranucleosomal DNA showed no change in the efficiency of Dpb4 cross-linking at a position that starts out 138 bp from the dyad axis and was moved to 78 – 88 bp from the dyad axis (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 6). This result is again consistent with Dpb4 remaining close to its original bound position rather than moving along with the nucleosome to keep a distance of 37 bp from the edge of the nucleosome. Cross-linking of Dpb4 increased in these nucleosomes when initial cross-linking 169 bp from the dyad is relocated 109–119bp from the dyad axis due to remodeling (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4). Changes in the translational position of nucleosomes are noticeable at these positions as evident by changes in histone cross-linking (Fig. 2B). The Dpb4 subunit appears to act as an anchor point for the ISW2 complex on extranucleosomal DNA that retains its position on DNA during nucleosome mobilization. The Dpb4 and Dls1 Histone Fold Dimer Makes Minor Contributions to Nucleosome Binding and Mobilization by ISW2—A complex of Isw2 and Itc1 without the two histone fold proteins was made by deleting the DLS1 gene and FLAG tagging ISW2 and is referred to as ISW2ΔDls1. The absence of the histone fold subunits was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western analysis (Fig. 3A). The nucleosome binding activity of ISW2 and ISW2ΔDls1 were compared by gel shift assays with nucleosomes that were assembled with the 601-nucleosome positioning sequence and 70 bp of extranucleosomal DNA. ISW2ΔDls1 missing the histone fold subunits had only slightly reduced binding affinity for nucleosomes compared with wild-type ISW2 (Fig. 3, B and C). Subtle changes of <2-fold were observed with nucleosomes containing different lengths of extranucleosomal DNA (data not shown). Efficiency of nucleosome mobilization with ISW2ΔDls1 was similar to that observed for wild-type ISW2 with 70 bp of extranucleosomal DNA (Fig. 3, D and E) or other lengths of extranucleosomal DNA (data not shown). More detailed analysis of the interactions of ISW2ΔDls1 with nucleosome was done by hydroxyl radical footprinting (25Kagalwala M.N. Glaus B.J. Dang W. Zofall M. Bartholomew B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2092-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). ISW2ΔDls1 had the same tripartite interaction with nucleosomes as wild-type ISW2, with extensive protection of extranucleosomal DNA, a 10–20 bp region at the entry site of nucleosomes, and a 10-bp region at SHL2 (Fig. 4). The histone fold subunits did not appear to be critical for efficient nucleosome binding, mobilization, or for the proper interaction of ISW2 with the three different extranucleosomal and nucleosomal regions.FIGURE 4No change in the hydroxyl radical footprint of the remodeling complex bound to nucleosomes upon loss of Dpb4/Dls1. ISW2 and ISW2ΔDls1 were bound to sucrose gradient-purified wild-type nucleosomes with 70 bp of extranucleosomal DNA. After hydroxyl radical cleavage, the samples were analyzed on a 6.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea along with the sequencing ladder of the same DNA. Quantification of the hydroxyl radical protection patterns of nucleosomes bound (gray) by ISW2 (A) or ISW2ΔDls1 (B) is shown. The profile of the unbound nucleosome is shown in black. The numbers above the peaks indicate the number of base pairs from the dyad axis. The super helical location (SHL) of the nucleosome is depicted, and the observed protection due to ISW2 binding is indicated with black (strong protection) or gray (weak protection) bars below the axis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Absence of the Histone Fold Subunits Compromises the Interaction of ISW2 at the Far Edge of Extranucleosomal DNA—The absence of the histone fold dimer from the ISW2 complex could cause a change in binding to extranucleosomal DNA that might not be as readily detected by hydroxyl radical footprinting. Exonuclease III mapping was used to determine the extent of ISW2 interactions with extranucleosomal DNA. Wild-type ISW2 protected a region up to 52 bp from the edge of the nucleosome, whereas ISW2ΔDls1 protected less well with it strongest site of protection only 39 bp from the edge of the nucleosome (Fig. 5, compare lanes 12 and 16, asterisks). Exonuclease III may more readily displace ISW2 lacking the histone fold subunits from DNA at the edge of ISW2 bound to extranucleosomal DNA than wild-type ISW2, thus accounting for differences in pausing from 39 to 52 bp from the edge of the nucleosome (Fig. 5, compare lanes 12 and 16). The 13-bp region in which this difference occurs remarkably coincides with the region bound to Dpb4, 37–53 bp from the edge of the nucleosome, as earlier shown by DNA photoaffinity labeling. Loss of the Histone Fold Dimer Changes the Interactions of Itc1 with Extranucleosomal DNA—The effect of the Dpb4-Dls1 histone fold dimer on the interactions of Itc1 and Isw2 with extranucleosomal DNA was examined by comparing the photoaffinity labeling patterns of ISW2 and ISW2ΔDls1. The most efficient cross-linking of Itc1 to DNA corresponded to the same region of Dls1-Dpb4 cross-linking (Fig. 1A, lanes 4, 6, and 8). These data and the fact that Itc1 is required for binding of Dls1-Dpb4 to the ISW2 complex 5N. Chaterjee and B. Bartholomew, unpublished observation. indicate that Itc1 interacts with the Dls1/Dpb4 complex. Loss of the histone fold dimer caused a reduction of Itc1 cross-linking at the more distal extranucleosomal DNA region 169 bp from the dyad axis (Fig. 6A, lanes 1 and 2, and Fig. 6B). At regions more proximal to the nucleosome, 122 and 111/110 bp from the dyad axis, loss of Dls1/Dpb4 caused an increase in cross-linking of Itc1 (Fig. 6A, lanes 7–10), with no significant changes evident at 138 and 149 bp from the dyad axis (lanes 3–6). One of the two possible explanations is that Itc1 adopted a more extended conformation in the presence of the histone fold subunits, such that Itc1 can be cross-linked to more distal extranucleosomal DNA. The other explanation may be that the histone fold subunits, similar to the histone H2A/H2B dimer, bends the extranucleosomal DNA and brings the distal extranucleosomal DNA closer to the nucleosome and to other parts of the ISW2 complex. We have shown that Dpb4 interacts with extranucleosomal DNA starting ∼37 bp from the entry/exit site of the nucleosome and proceeding farther out on extranucleosomal DNA as shown by cross-linking. The DNA sites of strongest cross-linking of Dpb4 correlate with the region of strongest cross-linking of Itc1 with extranucleosomal DNA and implicate that the Dpb4/Dls1 dimer interacts with Itc1. Dpb4 likely forms a tight heterodimer with Dls1 based on their homology with the heterodimers from CHRAC and similarity to other histone fold proteins. The interaction of Dpb4 with Dls1 was also shown by the deletion of Dls1, causing the loss of both Dls1 and Dpb4 from ISW2 when purified using FLAG-tagged Isw2. It is not clear why Dls1 was not also cross-linked to DNA in the same way that Dpb4 was to extranucleosomal DNA. Recently, the Drosophila histone fold heterodimer was crystallized and was shown to interact with the N terminus of Acf1 and DNA, consistent with our results (21Hartlepp K.F. Fernandez-Tornero C. Eberharter A. Grune T. Muller C.W. Becker P.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9886-9896Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The authors suggest that the p14/p16 heterodimer provides a chaperone surface for transient interaction with DNA that is disrupted from the octamer during mobilization. Our results with ISW2 suggest, however, that the histone fold dimer does not transiently interact with DNA; but instead, Dpb4 anchors itself to a region of extranucleosomal DNA. We have demonstrated that removing the histone fold dimer reduced the extent of interaction between Itc1 and extranucleosomal DNA as well as destabilizing the interaction of ISW2 with extranucleosomal DNA. Reduced cross-linking of Itc1 at the distal sites in the extranucleosomal DNA was accompanied by increased Itc1 cross-linking to regions closer to the edge of the nucleosome. The overall affinity and remodeling activity of ISW2 was, however, not dependent on Dpb4 or Dls1 as shown. The binding affinity of ISW2 for nucleosomes is unchanged in the absence of Dpb4/Dls1, because most of the interactions of ISW2 were intact in the absence of Dpb4/Dls1 as shown by hydroxyl radical footprinting of the ISW2-nucleosome complex. These results are different from those found previously for the human and Drosophila CHRAC complexes. Nucleosome binding and remodeling of recombinant human ACF1-SNF2h was significantly enhanced by the addition of an excess of recombinant CHRAC-15/CHRAC-17 dimer (21Hartlepp K.F. Fernandez-Tornero C. Eberharter A. Grune T. Muller C.W. Becker P.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9886-9896Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Nucleosome mobilization was also shown to be enhanced by the addition of excess heterodimer of Drosophila CHRAC complex as well in an ACF1-mediated fashion. It is not clear as to the need for an excess of the heterodimer, because in the intact complex, there is only stoichiometric amounts of the heterodimer. In these studies, a much larger amount of the recombinant human ACF1-SNF2h was required for binding or remodeling than that observed in our studies for the Itc1-Isw2 complex (ISW2ΔDls1). During chromatin remodeling by ISW2, we have found that the Dls1/Dpb4 dimer did not continuously track along the DNA as the nucleosome is mobilized. Instead, Dpb4 remained bound to its original binding site until partly displaced by the edge of the moving nucleosome. These results suggest that the histone fold dimer Dpb4-Dls1 acts as an anchor point on the extranucleosomal DNA for the ISW2 complex. Further experiments will be required to determine whether the Dls1/Dpb4 dimer facilitates in the processivity of ISW2. Tsukiyama and colleagues (18McConnell A.D. Gelbart M.E. Tsukiyama T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2605-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) show that the histone fold subunits are required for chromatin remodeling from various loci and that their effect can be quite varied. They suggest that some genes may require ISW2 containing Dpb4/Dls1, whereas the alternative form of ISW2 missing the two subunits is sufficient for other genes. The in vivo binding of ISW2 was shown not to be affected by the absence of Dpb4/Dls1 at any of these target genes, consistent with our data that Dpb4/Dls1 is not required for efficient ISW2 binding. However, the interaction of Dpb4 with extranucleosomal DNA and its modulation of Itc1 interactions with extranucleosomal DNA suggest that it might affect its nucleosome spacing activity, the ability to sense an adjacent nucleosome and stop remodeling. These kinds of effects could explain those observed in vivo with the loss of Dpb4 and Dls1. Changes in chromatin structure, as detected by indirect labeling, were in several instances as severe as isw2, whereas others were either intermediate between that of isw2 and wild type or were completely unaltered (18McConnell A.D. Gelbart M.E. Tsukiyama T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2605-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our results suggest these differences could be due to variable requirements for spacing nucleosomes at these different promoter regions. Our data points to the heterodimer of Dpb4 and Dls1 contacting extranucleosomal DNA and influencing the interaction of Itc1, the largest subunit of ISW2 that makes extensive contact with extranucleosomal DNA. These changes would likely modulate the spacing activity of ISW2 and could account for the observed changes in chromatin structure upon their loss in vivo. Recently Johansson and colleagues (35Asturias F.J. Cheung I.K. Sabouri N. Chilkova O. Wepplo D. Johansson E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) have solved the cryoelectron microscopy structure of yeast DNA polymerase ∊, and they suggest that the Dpb4 portion of DNA polymerase ∊ forms an extended tail of the complex and faces the double-stranded DNA that feeds into the Pol2 subunit of the polymerase. The Dpb-Pol2 connection is flexible enough to allow the polymerase to track along the DNA. We envision that the Dpb4-Dls1 subunits of yeast ISW2 may serve such a role in securing the DNA that is being translocated by ISW2. We thank Toshi Tsukiyama for providing us with the yeast strain YTT480 and Akio Sugino for anti-Dpb4 antiserum. We also thank Swetansu Hota for technical assistance in the construction of the strain YMK1010 and the purification of ISW2ΔDls1 and other members of the Bartholomew laboratory for critical review and comments on the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1994108062,"CREB-mediated activation of target gene transcription is stimulated by protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation at serine 133. This is followed by recruitment of the coactivators CREB-binding protein (CBP) or p300. Conversely, the decline in expression during the attenuation phase is linked to CREB dephosphorylation by nuclear phosphatases. The CREB bZIP domain, which promotes dimerization and promoter binding, as well as the kinase-inducible domain (KID), which interacts with the KIX domain of CBP/p300, are both largely unstructured in solution and become more structured once bound to their respective ligands. In this study, we biochemically characterize DNA- and phosphorylation-induced conformational alterations in CREB that may play a role in its transcriptionally poised, activated state. We find that sequence-specific DNA binding of pCREB renders the protein resistant to serine 133 dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1. Paradoxically, CREB bound to DNA and chromatin is efficiently phosphorylated by PKA, indicating that the KID region exists in a different conformation depending on its phosphorylation state. Consistent with this observation, we find that phosphorylation of DNA-bound CREB promotes an alternate conformation characterized by an apparent increase in the size or asymmetry of the complex and a qualitative change in proteolytic sensitivity. Together, our data indicate that DNA binding promotes a global conformational change in CREB that alters the structure of KID.

Many transcription factors are thought to undergo induced conformational changes in a ligand-dependent fashion. DNA-induced conformational changes have been described for several bZIP family proteins, including CREB, GCN5, C/EBP, c-Jun, and c-Fos (14Patel L. Abate C. Curran T. Nature. 1990; 347: 572-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 15Weiss M.A. Ellenberger T. Wobbe C.R. Lee J.P. Harrison S.C. Struhl K.

Struct Dyn. 1997; 15: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In CREB, the DNA-binding bZIP domain displays a 20% increase in helical structure following sequence-specific binding to the CRE (17Santiago-Rivera Z.I. Williams J.S. Gorenstein D.G. Andrisani O.M. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1461-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 18Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Goodman R.H. Brennan R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13716-13723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Similarly, the KID region is largely unstructured in solution until binding to the KIX domain of CBP/p300 induces an altered conformation with increased α-helicity (13Parker D. Ferreri K. Nakajima T.

Chem. 2002; 277: 42241-42248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Aside from these domains, studies have suggested that the remainder of the protein is predominantly unordered (18Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Goodman R.H. Brennan R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13716-13723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 21Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (2348) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, circular dichroism (CD) indicates that full-length CREB is 37% unstructured, and a 5% increase in α-helicity upon DNA binding has been attributed solely to changes within the bZIP domain (18Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Goodman R.H. Brennan R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13716-13723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Similarly, CREB appears to be highly sensitive to proteolysis, an indication of a largely unfolded state, and PKA phosphorylation appears to have little or no effect on its conformation both in solution and on DNA (18Richards J.P.

The specific role of PKA phosphorylation at Ser133 in transcriptional activation by CREB has been studied extensively yet many questions remain. Phosphorylation may have isolated local effects on the conformation and activity of the KID region. For example, the additional charge from the phosphate at Ser133 has been shown to increase the recruitment of CBP/p300 by forming hydrogen bonds with the Tyr658 and Lys662 residues in KIX and stabilizing the α-helix necessary for hydrophobic interactions (13Parker D.

Phosphorylation may affect other activation domains within CREB and, therefore, recruitment of other key transcription factors such as TFIID by the Q2 domain (25Ferreri K. Gill G. Montminy M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1210-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The effect of phosphorylation on DNA binding affinity has been widely studied with variable results; some studies suggest an increased affinity of CREB for non-consensus CREs upon phosphorylation whereas others show no effect (18Richards J.P.

It is well established that PKA phosphorylation of CREB (pCREB) promotes the interaction of KID with the KIX domain of CBP/p300, and subsequent activation of target genes. However, it is not clear how CREB maintains its phosphorylated status in the presence of nuclear phosphatases. In this report, we demonstrate that pCREB bound to CRE DNA acquires a protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)-resistant structure while the unphosphorylated form attains a structure that remains accessible to PKA. Most interestingly, we find that phosphorylation induces a further conformational change in DNA-bound CREB. This is demonstrated by an increase in the size or asymmetry of the phosphorylated protein/DNA complex and by a qualitative change in the proteolytic digestion pattern. Deletion of basic amino acids in KID mimics the phosphorylation-induced conformational alteration, suggesting that intramolecular interactions promote a more compact structure in CREB that are disrupted upon phosphorylation. These data are unexpected, as previously published studies suggest that the only significant structural alterations in the otherwise unstructured protein are induced solely within the bZIP domain and KID upon binding to their respective ligands (13Parker D.

Together, our data show that the KID region has the ability to adopt two unique, DNA-induced conformations that are differentially recognized by opposing regulators. Protein Expression and Purification—The bacterial expression plasmids for CREB327, CREB341 (30Franklin A.A. Kubik M.F. Uittenbogaard M.N. Brauweiler A. Utaisincharoen P. Matthews M.A. Dynan W.S. Hoeffler J.P. Nyborg J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21225-21231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and CREB341Δ121-125 (23Gonzalez G.A. Menzel P. Leonard J. Fischer W.H. Montminy M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1306-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) were expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta BL21(DE3)pLysS cells and purified by heat treatment followed by heparin-Sepharose and size-exclusion chromatography. All CREB proteins were purified to ∼98% homogeneity and were free of contaminating nucleic acid. 3D. I. Lopez, J. E. Mick, and J. K. Nyborg, submitted for publication. The bZIP273-327 plasmid was expressed and purified as previously described (31Giebler H.A. Loring J.E. Van Orden K. Colgin M.A. Garrus J.E. Escudero K.W. Brauweiler A. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5156-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). CREB was phosphorylated with the catalytic subunit of PKA (Sigma, cat. P-2645) as previously described (31Giebler H.A. Loring J.E. Van Orden K. Colgin M.A. Garrus J.E. Escudero K.W. Brauweiler A. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5156-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Mock phosphorylated reactions were carried out in parallel. Phosphorylation reactions were determined to go to completion based on the inability of the protein to be further phosphorylated in the presence of PKA and [γ-32P]ATP. The expression vector for KIX (mouse CBP586-680), a gift from Kevin J. Lumb (32Mestas S.P. Lumb K.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 613-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. Cultures were harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in 0.015 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA pH 7.5, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 8 ng/μl aprotinin, 8 ng/μl leupeptin, 1 mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science, cat. 1836170), and 2 mm DTT. Cells were sonicated, the lysate cleared by centrifugation, and applied to Q-Sepharose. The flow-through containing KIX was applied to two consecutive SP-Sepharose columns. KIX was purified to ≥98% homogeneity. Recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the GST fusion protein GST-KIX (CBP588-683) were purified as previously described (31Giebler H.A. Loring J.E. Van Orden K. Colgin M.A. Garrus J.E. Escudero K.W. Brauweiler A. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5156-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). CEM nuclear extract was prepared as previously described (33Dynan W.S. Genet. Eng. 1987; 9: 75-87Crossref Google Scholar). Preparation of Ser119-radiolabeled pCREB—Purified CREB was phosphorylated using the catalytic subunit of PKA (Calbiochem, cat. 539486) in a reaction containing 1 pmol of CREB, 2 units of PKA, and 0.25 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (6 μCi/pmol specific activity). The reactions were further incubated with unlabeled ATP (100 μm) to drive the phosphorylation reaction to completion. PKA was heat-inactivated at 75 °C for 10 min. Dephosphorylation of pCREB by CEM Nuclear Extract—[32P]CREB was incubated with CEM nuclear extract (50 μg, unless otherwise indicated) at 30 °C for 30 min. in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 12 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA. Control reactions were incubated with buffer alone, in the absence of nuclear extract. The reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample dyes and resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Phosphatase Assays—Dephosphorylation of pCREB was performed using either protein phosphatase 1 (New England Biolabs, cat. P0754S) or protein phosphatase 2A (Calbiochem, cat. 530508). [32P]CREB/bZIP heterodimers were formed by heating equilmolar amounts of protein (10.4 μm total protein) to 65 °C for 10 min then cooling on ice. [32P]CREB samples (4 pmol) were incubated with PP1 in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm MnCl2. Reactions with PP2A were carried out in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 1.4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The amount of phosphatase used in each experiment varied based on the activity of the enzymes. Reactions were carried out for 15 or 30 min. at 30 °C, as indicated. In the phosphatase inhibition assay, okadaic acid was included in the reactions at concentrations of 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200 nm. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample dyes and resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Immobilized Template Assay—A 643-bp promoter fragment was PCR-amplified from a plasmid template which carries four reiterated copies of an off-consensus CRE (5′-TGACGACA-3′) from the human T-cell leukemia virus, type 1 promoter (4TxRE/G-less) (34Anderson M.G. Scoggin K.E. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Steadman J.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Primers were designed to amplify the sequence between -187 to +456 and generate a fragment carrying a biotin group at the 5′ end. The binding of the gel purified fragment to streptavidin-coupled magnetic beads (Dynal Biotech USA, cat. 112.06) was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction. The subsequent binding of proteins was carried out as previously described (35Johnson K.M. Wang J. Smallwood A. Carey M. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 380: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and as indicated in each figure. Immunoblotting—CREB proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblots were performed with antiphospho-Ser133CREB or anti-CREB antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Ser133 cat. sc-7879 and C-21 cat. sc-186, respectively). Proteins were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-labeled corresponding secondary antibodies and ECl+ chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, cat. RPN-2132). Oligonucleotides—The sequence of the double-stranded (ds) oligonucleotides (IDT) used in the indicated assays are as follows: Primers for PCR amplification of the CRE promoter (4TxRE/G-less) (34Anderson M.G.

Gel filtration chromatography, top strand: 5′-TAGGCGTTGACGTCAACCCC-3′. Proteolysis—Protein samples were incubated with trypsin at a ratio of 1:100 (w/w, sequencing grade trypsin, Promega, cat. V5111). The reactions were performed with 3.8 μm CREB or pCREB, 38 μm KIX, and a 1.5-fold molar excess of CRE DNA (2.8 μm) (CRE oligo 1) relative to the dimer. The reactions containing KIX or DNA were preincubated for 30 min at 30 °C prior to the addition of trypsin. 4 μg of CREB was analyzed for each time point. Reactions were carried out at 25 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm ammonium carbonate, pH 7.9 and 10 mm DTT for the times indicated. Reactions were terminated with SDS sample dye and flash-freezing in liquid N2. Proteins were resolved by 10% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue. FoldIndex Analysis—FoldIndex is a simple tool to predict whether a given protein sequence is intrinsically unfolded. Folding predictions for CREB327 were plotted using the default window size of 51 amino acids and calculated by the Uversky method using average residue hydrophobicity and net charge (36Prilusky J.

Fink A.L. Proteins. 2000; 41: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). Accessibility of CREB Ser119 to PKA Phosphorylation—Free and DNA-bound CREB (8 pmol) were phosphorylated using 8 units of the catalytic subunit of PKA (Calbiochem, cat. 530508) and 2 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (6 μCi/pmol specific activity) as described above for the times indicated. The reactions were terminated using SDS sample dye and resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. Reactions containing chromatin were resolved by 4-20% gradient SDS-PAGE. Gels were briefly stained and destained to visualize total CREB and histone proteins, followed by autoradiography. Chromatin Assembly—The 643-bp CRE-containing promoter fragment (4TxRE) was immobilized on magnetic beads as described above. The immobilized fragment was assembled into chromatin using Drosophila core histones, which were purified as previously described (38Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Adolph K.W. Gene and Chromosome Analysis. Methods in Molecular Genetics. Vol. 5. Academic Press, San Diego1994Google Scholar). Assembly reactions were performed as previously described (39Fyodorov D.V. Kadonaga J.T. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 499-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 40Scoggin K.E. Ulloa A. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5520-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Nucleosome assembly was confirmed by micrococcal nuclease analysis. Prior to performing the PKA assays, the assembled chromatin was washed thoroughly with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 1 mm EDTA to remove free ATP and nucleosome assembly proteins. Micrococcal Nuclease Assay—Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion was performed on 2.0 μg of PCR-amplified CRE fragment (4TxRE) assembled into chromatin, as previously described (41Konesky K.L. Nyborg J.K. Laybourn P.J. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 10542-10553Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Samples were resolved by 1.5% Tris borate agarose and visualized by SYBR® gold nucleic acid gel stain (Molecular Probes, cat. S-11494). GeneRuler™ 100 bp markers (Fermentas, cat. SM0323) were used as DNA size standards. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Protein-DNA complexes were formed by incubating a 26-bp 32P-end-labeled ds CRE oligonucleotide (0.5 nm) with the various CREB proteins (2.5 nm), as previously described (31Giebler H.A. Loring J.E. Van Orden K. Colgin M.A. Garrus J.E. Escudero K.W. Brauweiler A. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5156-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Heterodimers were formed by heating equilmolar amounts of protein (10.4 μm total protein) to 65 °C for 10 min then cooling on ice. Samples were analyzed on a 5% (49:1 w/w acrylamide:bisacrylamide) non-denaturing gel in a buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 306 mm glycine and 0.1% Nonidet P-40, followed by autoradiography. Gel Filtration Chromatography—CREB proteins used to form homodimers (7 μm) and heterodimers (3.5 μm each, 7 μm total) were heated to 65 °C for 10 min, placed on ice for 10 min, then incubated with a 21-bp CRE oligonucleotide (4.2 μm) for 1 h on ice in a 250-μl reaction. The protein/DNA complexes were injected onto a prepacked analytical Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 μm ZnSO4, and 2 mm DTT. The column was run at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and protein/DNA absorbance was monitored at 280 nm. Blue dextran 2,000 and protein molecular mass standards between 14.4 and 669 kDa were used to calibrate the column. The void volume of the column was at ∼7.8 ml. Elution volumes (VE) of the complexes were normalized to the VE of the DNA alone. Image Processing and Data Reproducibility—Image Quant 5.1 software (Molecular Dynamics) was used to quantify band intensities. Background signal was subtracted from each band quantified. Images were processed in Adobe Photoshop enabling minor adjustments to brightness/contrast as needed (gamma was kept at 1). No bands were obscured or altered. Images were annotated in PowerPoint. All experiments presented in this manuscript were shown to be reproducible in at least three independent trials. pCREB Is Dephosphorylated by Protein Phosphatase 1 Present in a T-cell Nuclear Extract—PKA phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133 leads to the recruitment of the coactivators CBP/p300 through specific interactions between the KID region of CREB and the highly conserved KIX domain of CBP/p300. This transcription factor-coactivator interaction promotes transcription of target genes. We were interested in determining the stability of the phosphorylated state of CREB in the presence of CEM nuclear extract in vitro, as this modification is critical to the physiological function of CREB. Previous studies have shown that CREB is dephosphorylated by protein phosphatases present in nuclear extracts from PC12 and HepG2 cell lines (10Hagiwara M. Alberts A. Brindle P. Meinkoth J.

To perform these studies, we used highly purified CREB327 that was PKA-phosphorylated at serine 119 (Ser119). This CREB isoform carries the full kinase-inducible domain (KID) with the consensus PKA phosphorylation site at Ser119 (versus Ser133 in CREB341) (42Yamamoto K.K. Gonzalez G.A. Menzel P. Rivier J.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1503-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). CREB was phosphorylated by PKA and [γ-32P]ATP, incubated with increasing amounts of CEM nuclear extract, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Fig. 1A shows that the lowest amount of nuclear extract used in this experiment dephosphorylated CREB to near completion. The loss of signal was not caused by degradation of CREB, as proteolytic products were not observed (data not shown). The protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A are believed to account for 90% of the phosphatase activity in mammalian cells (46Cohen P. Cohen P. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2131184065,"Cyclin L1 and cyclin L2 are two closely related members of the cyclin family that contain C-terminal arginine- and serine-rich (RS) domains and are localized in the splicing factor compartment (nuclear speckles). Here we applied photobleaching techniques to show that a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein of cyclin L1, in contrast to cyclin L2, was not mobile within the nucleus of living COS7 cells. The objectives of this study were to 1) characterize the intranuclear localization and mobility properties of cyclin L1 in different cellular states, and 2) dissect the structural elements required for immobilization of cyclin L1. Transcriptional arrest by actinomycin D caused accumulation of GFP-cyclin L2 in rounded and enlarged nuclear speckles but did not affect the subnuclear pattern of distribution of GFP-cyclin L1. Although immobile in most phases of the cell cycle, GFP-cyclin L1 was diffusely distributed and highly mobile in the cytoplasm of metaphase cells. By analysis of a series of chimeras, deletion constructs, and a point mutant, a segment within the RS domain of cyclin L1 was identified to be necessary for the immobility of the protein in nuclear speckles. This study provides the first characterization of an immobile component of nuclear speckles."

In a previous study, we found that HS-2-O-sulfotransferase is strongly expressed throughout the mesoderm of chick limb buds during the early stages of development. Here we show that inhibition of HS-2-O-sulfotransferase in the prospective limb region by small inhibitory RNA resulted in the truncation of limb buds and reduced Fgf-8 expression in the apical ectodermal ridge. The treatment also reduced Fgf-10 expression in the mesenchyme. Moreover 2-O-sulfated HS, normally abundant in the basement membranes and mesoderm under ectoderm in limb buds, was significantly reduced in the treated buds. Phosphorylation levels of ERK and Akt were up-regulated in such truncated buds. Thus, we have shown for the first time that 2-O-sulfation of HS is essential for the FGF signaling required for limb bud development and outgrowth.

Chick limb bud is a useful model of limb pattern formation, which involves various growth factors and morphogens such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF), 2The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; HS, heparan sulfate; HS2ST, heparan sulfate 2-O-sulfotransferase; HS6ST, heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase; HBGF, heparin-binding growth factor; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; AER, apical ectodermal ridge; LPM, lateral plate mesoderm; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small inhibitory RNA; esiRNA, endonuclease-digested small inhibitory RNA; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; pERK, phosphorylated ERK; pAkt, phosphorylated Akt; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; EXT, extosis. 2The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; HS, heparan sulfate; HS2ST, heparan sulfate 2-O-sulfotransferase; HS6ST, heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase; HBGF, heparin-binding growth factor; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; AER, apical ectodermal ridge; LPM, lateral plate mesoderm; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small inhibitory RNA; esiRNA, endonuclease-digested small inhibitory RNA; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; pERK, phosphorylated ERK; pAkt, phosphorylated Akt; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; EXT, extosis. hedgehog, wingless/Wnt, and bone morphogenetic proteins (1Martin G.R.

Limb bud initiation requires reciprocal interactions between a specialized ectodermal structure called the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) and the underlying mesoderm (5Ohuchi H. Nakagawa T. Yamamoto A. Araga A. Ohata T. Ishimaru Y. Yoshioka H. Kuwana T. Nohno T. Yamasaki M. Itoh N. Noji S. Development. 1997; 124: 2235-2244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Xu X. Weinstein M. Li C. Deng C. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 296: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). At the time of limb initiation, in stages 13–15 of the chick embryo, Fgf-8 in the intermediate mesoderm induces Fgf-10 expression in the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) of the prospective limb region. FGF-10 produced in the prospective limb mesoderm then induces Fgf-8 expression in the overlying surface ectoderm (AER). FGF-8 secreted from AER maintains Fgf-10 expression in the underlying mesoderm. This FGF signaling loop establishes the maintenance of AER and outgrowth of limb buds. FGF-8 also contributes to Shh induction, which in turn induces Fgf-4 expression in the AER and maintains AER function in the posterior underlying mesoderm called the zone of polarizing activity (7Lewandoski M. Sun X. Martin G.R. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 8Moon A.M. Capecchi M.R. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 455-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar).Although growth factors and morphogens are required for limb bud development and patterning, it is unclear how their signaling and distribution are regulated. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which are ubiquitous on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix including basement membranes, are important regulators of such growth factor signaling and distribution (9Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar, 10Lin X. Development. 2004; 131: 6009-6021Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 11Häcker U. Nybakken K. Perrimon N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 530-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). For example, chicken syndecan-3 is expressed throughout the distal mesenchymal cells and plays a role in limb bud outgrowth by controlling FGF signaling between the AER and mesoderm (12Dealy C.N. Seghatoleslami M.R. Ferrari D. Kosher R.A. Dev. Biol. 1997; 184: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate proteoglycans play such roles by interacting with these growth factors (13Niu S. Antin P.B. Akimoto K. Morkin E. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 207: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 14Paine-Saunders S. Viviano B.L. Zupicich J. Skarnes W.C. Saunders S. Dev.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1058-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar); however, it is unclear what role HS chains play in these processes, although HS chains are known to interact with a variety of heparin-binding growth factors (HBGFs) such as FGF.In FGF signaling, the ternary complex composed of HS chains, FGF family molecules, and FGF receptors (FGFRs) is formed on the cell surface (16Schlessinger J.

Specificities of interactions between heparan sulfate proteoglycan and ligand molecules are thought to reside in the fine structures of HS chains with specific sequences consisting of highly sulfated monosaccharides (N-, 2-O-, and/or 6-O-sulfated) (9Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar, 19Nakato H. Kimata K. Biochim. Biophys.

In fact, the different O-sulfation patterns of HS chains are involved in interactions with FGF family molecules (21Habuchi H. Suzuki S. Saito T. Tamura T. Harada T. Yoshida K. Kimata K. Biochem.

These fine structures are generated by the following modification reactions with specific enzymes after the backbone chain of HS is synthesized by the addition of alternating d-glucuronic acid and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc) residues from the respective UDP sugars by EXT family proteins (24Zak B.M. Crawford B.E. Esko J.D. Biochim. Biophys.

Investig. 1997; 99: 2062-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar).O-Sulfation residues and patterns have been shown to be critical to HS function in several developmental processes. For example, gene trap mutation of HS2ST in mice causes renal agenesis, eye and skeleton defects, and neonatal lethality (28Bullock S.L. Fletcher J.M. Beddington R.S. Wilson V.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1894-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). HS6ST-1 null mice die between embryonic day 15.5 and the perinatal stage and show a reduction in the number of fetal microvessels in the labyrinthine zone of the placenta (29Habuchi H. Nagai N. Sugaya N. Atsumi F. Stevens R.L. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15578-15588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent report on mutant HS2ST and HS6ST-1 mice showed defects of specific axon guidance at the optic chiasm (30Pratt T. Conway C.D. Tian N.M. Price D.J. Mason J.O. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6911-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Morpholino-mediated knockdown of HS6ST in zebrafish results in disruption of somitic muscle development and defects in the branching morphogenesis of the caudal vein (31Bink R.J. Habuchi H. Lele Z. Dolk E. Joore J. Rauch G.J. Geisler R. Wilson S.W. den Hertog J. Kimata K. Zivkovic D. J. Biol.

Biol. 2005; 284: 364-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Drosophila HS6ST expression by RNA interference (RNAi) reduces FGF signaling activity and disrupts the primary branching of the tracheal system (33Kamimura K. Fujise M. Villa F. Izumi S. Habuchi H. Kimata K. Nakato H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17014-17021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).Previously we showed distinctive expression patterns of HS O-sulfotransferases in developing chick limb buds (34Nogami K. Suzuki H. Habuchi H. Ishiguro N. Iwata H. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8219-8229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). HS6ST-1 and HS6ST-2 transcripts are preferentially localized in the anterior and posterior proximal regions of the limb bud, respectively, whereas HS2ST transcripts are distributed rather uniformly throughout the bud. HS sulfation patterns in chick limb buds correspond exactly with these expression patterns (34Nogami K. Suzuki H. Habuchi H. Ishiguro N. Iwata H. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8219-8229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, specific HS sulfation patterns may regulate the development and patterning of limb buds by binding to growth factors and morphogens. In this study, we examined the role of 2-O-sulfation in the morphogenesis of the chicken limb. Electroporation of RNA duplexes (RNAi technique) is effective at suppressing the expression of target genes in chick embryos (35Pekarik V. Bourikas D. Miglino N. Joset P. Preiswerk S. Stoeckli E.T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Disruption of the HS2ST gene by small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) reduced 2-O-sulfation levels and led to the abnormal development of limb buds, which showed less expression of both Fgf-8 and Fgf-10 accompanied by the up-regulation of phosphorylation of both ERK and Akt. Taken together, these results suggest that reducing 2-O-sulfate residues affect limb bud formation and outgrowth.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Chicken Embryos—Fertile White Leghorn chicken eggs were obtained from Takeuchi Farm (Nara, Japan), incubated in humidified air at 38 °C, and staged according to Hamburger and Hamilton (36Hamburger V. Hamilton H.L. J. Morphol. 1951; 88: 49-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (9958) Google Scholar).RNAi—Double-stranded RNA corresponding to the HS2ST open reading frame sequence was prepared and then digested with RNase III. Chicken HS2ST open reading frame was subcloned into pBluescriptII KS(-) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) before transcribing sense and antisense single-stranded RNA from T3 and T7 RNA polymerase promoters. RNA was incubated with DNase I to degrade the template DNA. Sense and antisense RNA were annealed into duplexes by combining equal amounts of each type of RNA, then denatured at 95 °C for 5 min, and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Annealed duplexes were incubated with RNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX) at 37 °C for 30 min and then treated with phenol-chloroform. The purified duplexes were resuspended in distilled water. To generate endonuclease-digested small inhibitory RNA (esiRNA), double-stranded RNA was incubated with RNase III (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction products were purified with siRNA Purification Units (Ambion), then precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in distilled water. As controls for the siRNA treatment, siRNA mixtures for luciferase, the gene of which is derived from pGL3-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI), were prepared by the same procedure.In Ovo Electroporation—For electroporation experiments, eggs were opened after 2 days of incubation at 38 °C, corresponding to stage 13-14, and a solution of India ink diluted in Tyrode's solution was applied below the blastoderm to enhance contrast. The vitellin membrane overlying the presumptive forelimb region was also carefully removed using a fine tungsten needle. RNA solutions containing 0–700 ng/μl esiRNA, 0.1% fast green, and 2 μg/μl pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) were injected into the LPM of the presumptive right forelimb region of embryos, and several drops of Tyrode's solution were added after injection. Electrodes were placed above (cathode) and below (anode) the forelimb region containing the injected RNA, and electroporation (three 15-V, 25-ms pulses) was performed with ElectroSquarePorator T820 (BTX; Inovio Biomedical Corp., San Diego, CA). Experimental embryos were observed and/or harvested 16–48 h after electroporation. For cryosections, embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, PBS at 4 °C overnight and then incubated in 30% sucrose, PBS at 4 °C for 2–12 h. Embryos were embedded in OCT compound (Sakura, Tokyo, Japan), and 10-mm-thick cryosections were made.In Situ Hybridization—Whole-mount and section in situ hybridization was performed as described previously with slight modifications (34Nogami K.

For whole-mount in situ hybridization, embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, PBS overnight and then digested with 1 μg/ml proteinase K in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 at 20 °C for 15 min. Hybridization was performed at 65 °C in 5× SSC, 50% (v/v) formamide, 1% (w/v) SDS, 50 μg/ml heparin, and 50 μg/ml yeast tRNA using digoxigenin-labeled RNA as a probe.In Situ FGF-2 Binding Assay and Immunohistochemistry—For in situ detection of 2-O-sulfated HS, we used an exogenous FGF-2 binding assay (40Morita H. Shinzato T. David G. Mizutani A. Habuchi H. Fujita Y. Ito M. Asai J. Maeda K. Kimata K. Lab. Investig. 1994; 71: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar). Cryosections were air-dried and then washed with PBS. To remove endogenous HS-bound molecules, sections were incubated with 2 m NaCl, PBS at room temperature for 10 min and then washed three times with PBS. When necessary, sections were treated with a mixture of heparitinases (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan) at 37 °C for 2 h. Sections were incubated with 5–30 nm recombinant human FGF-2 (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C overnight followed by blocking for1hat room temperature with PBS containing 10% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). After five washes with PBS, FGF-2 binding was analyzed using an anti-FGF-2 monoclonal antibody (05-118; Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) and Alexa-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). HS was detected with 3G10 antibody (Seikagaku Corp.) and secondary antibody.Western Blot Analysis—For Western blot analysis, tissue lysates of stage 22-23 limb buds were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blots were incubated with 10% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (TBST; Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20) and probed with anti-phosphorylated ERK (pERK) antibody (catalog number 9106; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), anti-ERK antibody (catalog number 9102; Cell Signaling Technology), antiphosphorylated Akt (pAkt) antibody (catalog number 9275; Cell Signaling Technology), or anti-actin antibody (catalog number A2066; Sigma) diluted with 1% skim milk in TBST. The signal was visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (Western Lighting Plus; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Ligand and Carbohydrate Engagement Assays—In situ binding of the FGF·FGFR complex to heparan sulfate in the assay enables us to detect HS structure alterations (41Allen B.L. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 42Pan Y. Woodbury A. Esko J.D. Grobe K. Zhang X. Development. 2006; 133: 4933-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The frozen sections were incubated in 2 m NaCl, PBS for 10 min followed by treatment with 10% BSA, PBS to block nonspecific binding. Slides were then incubated with 10–30 nm FGF-8 or FGF-10 (Peprotech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ) together with 10–20 nm FGFR2b-Fc or FGFR2c-Fc (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), respectively, which were fused with the human IgG Fc domain, at 4 °C overnight. After five washes with PBS, the bound FGFR-Fc was detected using a Cy3-conjugated anti-human Fc IgG secondary antibody (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA).RESULTSExpression Patterns of HS2ST—HS2ST is highly expressed in the developing limb buds of chick embryos (34Nogami K. Suzuki H. Habuchi H. Ishiguro N. Iwata H. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8219-8229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Whole-mount in situ hybridization showed that HS2ST transcripts were localized uniformly throughout both wing and leg buds at stage 23 (Fig. 1A). In a transverse section of the wing bud region, HS2ST expression was strong in the mesenchyme and weak (but significant) in the overlying ectoderm including the AER (Fig. 1, B and C). This characteristic expression pattern suggests that HS2ST is deeply involved in limb bud development.Abnormal Limb Bud Development and Outgrowth by HS2ST RNAi—To investigate the role of 2-O-sulfated HS in growth factor signaling in limb bud development, siRNA mixtures were transfected into the LPM of the prospective right forelimb region in stage 13-14 embryos via electroporation. HS2ST esiRNA-injected limbs caused abnormal development 2 days after the operation (Fig. 2, B–E), whereas PBS-injected limbs showed less abnormality (Fig. 2A). The abnormal limb buds were truncated and reduced in size (Fig. 2, B–D) or occasionally indented (Fig. 2E). When higher concentrations of esiRNA were injected, severe abnormal phenotypes were observed in the limb buds with higher frequency (Table 1). Green fluorescent protein (GFP) signals derived from coelectroporated pEGFP-N1 were observed around truncated regions of injected limb buds (Fig. 2, B–E). The skeletal pattern of mild affected limb at 9 days showed a defective digit and shorter structure compared with the uninjected control left limb (Fig. 2, H and I). Severely truncated buds showed little outgrowth and a markedly affected cartilage pattern at 9 days (Fig. 2, D, F, and G).FIGURE 2Abnormal limb bud formation by HS2ST RNAi. A–E, HS2ST esiRNA- or PBS-injected stage 22-23 limb bud. HS2ST siRNA mixtures (150 ng/μl) or PBS was injected, via electroporation, into the lateral plate mesoderm of the prospective right wing bud region of stage 13-14 embryos. A′–E′, GFP signals, derived from coelectroporated pEGFP-N1, indicated the siRNA-injected region. A, PBS-injected control samples had almost normal limb buds. B–E, HS2ST esiRNA-injected samples showed truncated limb buds. B, mildly truncated limb; C, moderately truncated limb; D, severely truncated limb; and E, indented limb. F–I, Alcian blue staining of skeletal patterns in HS2ST esiRNA-injected limbs revealed their abnormalities.

For example, 150 ng/μl HS2ST esiRNA-injected buds had a higher frequency of abnormalities (26.5%) than 300 ng/μl luciferase esiRNA-injected buds (13.0%). Although it is known that RNAi techniques sometimes cause off-target effects, it is unlikely that the truncation is due to such effects. Furthermore the frequency of severe phenotypes in these controls was significantly less than that in HS2ST esiRNA-injected buds (Table 1). These results suggest that the injection of HS2ST esiRNA specifically caused truncation of the limb buds. In addition, HS2ST transcripts were reduced in HS2ST RNAi limb buds compared with untreated buds (Fig. 1, D–F). No reduction of HS2ST mRNA was observed in control limb buds (data not shown). These results indicate that siRNA mixtures effectively reduce HS2ST transcripts.Alteration of HS Structures by HS2ST RNAi—We then examined whether the abnormal morphology of limb buds resulted from the loss of 2-O-sulfate residues in HS. Because no suitable antibodies for the detection of 2-O-sulfate residues in HS are available, we took advantage of the following binding properties of exogenous FGF-2 to HS to determine the distribution of 2-O-sulfated HS in tissues (40Morita H. Shinzato T. David G. Mizutani A. Habuchi H. Fujita Y. Ito M. Asai J. Maeda K. Kimata K. Lab. Investig. 1994; 71: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that 2-O-sulfated HS is sufficient to bind FGF-2 (21Habuchi H. Suzuki S. Saito T. Tamura T. Harada T. Yoshida K. Kimata K. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We pretreated the limb bud sections with 2 m NaCl to remove endogenous HBGFs, including FGF-2, bound to HS and then stained the sections with exogenous FGF-2 in combination with anti-FGF-2 antibody (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. 1). In the normal limb bud at stage 23, exogenous FGF-2 was strongly bound to the basement membranes and mesenchyme underneath the ectoderm (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. 1). These staining patterns coincided with HS distribution in the limb detected by 3G10 antibody (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. 1). When sections were treated with heparitinases before applying FGF-2, the FGF-2 binding region was markedly reduced, suggesting that exogenous FGF-2 binds specifically to HS (supplemental Fig. 1). These results indicate that 2-O-sulfated HS is abundant in the basement membranes and mesenchyme under the ectoderm in the developing limb bud. We then tested FGF-2 binding activity in siRNA-injected limb buds at stage 23 (Fig. 3). In RNAi-treated limb buds, exogenous FGF-2 bound only weakly to the truncated region compared with the unaffected region, whereas HS distributions themselves were not affected (Fig. 3, E–H). We could not see such a decrease of exogenous FGF-2 binding in luciferase RNAi-treated limb buds (data not shown). These results show that HS2ST RNAi also reduced 2-O-sulfation and FGF-2 binding. Interestingly 2-O-sulfation was significantly reduced in the basement membranes (Fig. 3, E and F, arrowheads). The decrease of 2-O-sulfation in the basement membranes could affect the movement of HBGFs between the mesoderm and ectoderm.FIGURE 3Alteration of 2-O-sulfated HS by HS2ST RNAi. A and C, HS was detected by 3G10 antibody. B and D, the 2-O-sulfated HS was detected as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Longitudinal sections of limb buds (removal of endogenous HBGFs by treatment with 2 m NaCl) were exposed to exogenous FGF-2 and then probed with anti-FGF-2 antibody.

A marked reduction of Fgf-8 transcripts was observed in truncated buds by siRNA injection, whereas Fgf-8 is expressed in the AER of untreated buds (Fig. 4, A and B). Shh, which is induced by FGF-8 signaling, was also reduced in limbs that showed decreased Fgf-8 expression (Fig. 4B, arrowhead). In some cases (4 of 13 samples), the reduction of Fgf-8 expression was also observed even in HS2ST esiRNA-injected but almost normally developed limb buds (Fig. 4C); however, no such reduction was observed in luciferase esiRNA-injected limb buds (11 samples).FIGURE 4Abnormal limb buds showed lower Fgf-8 and Shh expression.

Operating via heterotrimeric G proteins to downstream effectors, lysophosphatidic acid was shown to regulate the function and trafficking of the G protein-coupled β2-adrenergic receptor. C3 exotoxin, expression of dominant negative RhoA, and inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase blocked the ability of lysophosphatidic acid to sequester the β2-adrenergic receptor, whereas expression of constitutively active Gα13, p115RhoGEF, or RhoA mimicked lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) action, stimulating the internalization of the Gαs-coupled β2-adrenergic receptor. This study revealed a novel cross-talk exerted from the LPA/Gα13/p115RhoGEF/RhoA pathway to the β2-adrenergic receptor/Gαs/adenylyl cyclase pathway, attenuating the ability of β-adrenergic agonists to act following stimulation of cells by LPA as may occur during β-adrenergic therapy of an inflammatory response.

A major focus of research in cell signaling is the study of the integration or “cross-talk” among signaling pathways (1Morris A.J. Malbon C.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1373-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 2Kolch W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). For more than a decade it has been observed in G protein-coupled signaling paradigms that pathways cross-talk at several levels. Chronic activation of the inhibitory adenylyl cyclase pathway leads to a compensatory change in the stimulatory adenylyl cyclase pathway at the level of gene expression (3Hadcock J.R. Port J.D. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11915-11922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chronic activation of the stimulatory adenylyl cyclase pathway likewise influences the expression of the elements of the opposing inhibitory adenylyl cyclase pathway (4Hadcock J.R. Ros M. Watkins D.C. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14784-14790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many examples of such cross-talk have been reported for pathways regulated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 3The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; β2AR, β2-adrenergic receptor; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MKK, MAPK kinase kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; MEKK, MEK kinase; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; siRNA, small interference RNA; Iso, isoproterenol; DN, dominant negative; KD, knockdown; CA, constitutively active; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; LPAR, LPA receptor. 3The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; β2AR, β2-adrenergic receptor; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MKK, MAPK kinase kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; MEKK, MEK kinase; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; siRNA, small interference RNA; Iso, isoproterenol; DN, dominant negative; KD, knockdown; CA, constitutively active; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; LPAR, LPA receptor. and their cognate G proteins. Similarly cross-talk has been observed operating between receptor tyrosine kinases and GPCR-mediated signaling (5Hadcock J.R. Port J.D. Gelman M.S. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26017-26022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Houslay M.D. Kolch W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The regulation of catecholamine action at the level of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) by insulin is prototypic for this aspect of cross-talk (7Karoor V. Shih M. Tholanikunnel B. Malbon C.C. Prog. Neurobiol. 1996; 48: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The function of the β2AR is impaired by insulin action with the β2AR acting as a substrate for the activated insulin receptor itself (8Baltensperger K. Karoor V. Paul H. Ruoho A. Czech M.P. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1061-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) as well as for the downstream protein kinase of the insulin receptor, Akt (9Doronin S. Shumay E. Wang H.H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15124-15131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although cross-talk among G protein-mediated pathways controlling a common second messenger, cyclic AMP, has been detailed, much less is known about whether or not cross-talk occurs among signaling pathways with divergent second messenger readouts. In an effort to explore cross-talk in this context, we sought to investigate whether signaling via a Gα13-mediated pathway influenced signaling of the β2AR/Gαs/adenylyl cyclase pathway. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a lipid mediator that acts upon members of the GPCR subfamily of LPA receptors that can couple to Gα13 and in some cases other heterotrimeric G proteins (10Moolenaar W.H. van Meeteren L.A. Giepmans B.N. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 870-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Using human carcinoma A431 as well as human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells as models (11Wang H.Y. Berrios M. Hadcock J.R. Malbon C.C. Int. J. Biochem. 1991; 23: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we tested the ability of LPA to regulate β2AR action, elucidating a novel cross-talk from a Gα13-mediated pathway in which Gα13, p115RhoGEF, RhoA, and ultimately JNK regulated the trafficking of β2ARs in the β2AR/Gαs/adenylyl cyclase pathway. Activation of this LPA-sensitive pathway led to a reduction in the cell surface complement of β2AR and attenuated β2AR-mediated signaling events as well as recovery from agonist-induced desensitization. Reagents—Key reagents used in these studies were obtained from the following sources: Clostridium botulinum exotoxin (C3) and LPA from Sigma, SP600125 from A. G. Scientific, Inc. (San Diego, CA), SB203580 and Ro-20-1724 from Calbiochem, and ProLong® anti-fade reagent from Invitrogen. Cell Culture—Human epidermoid carcinoma A431 and HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For all experimental trials herein, stable transfectant clones, transiently transfected cells, or untreated, wild-type cells were cultured on tissue culture plates (6- and 96-well plates) or on chamber slides and kept in serum-free growth medium for 18 h prior to assays. Plasmids and Transfections—The expression vector pCMV5 plasmid harboring the constitutively activated, GTPase-deficient Q226L mutant form of Gα13 (QLGα13) was obtained from Dr. Alfred Gilman (Pharmacology, University of Texas South-western Medical School, Dallas, TX). For empty vector controls the pCDNA3 plasmid was used. Expressed proteins were epitope-tagged either with the hemagglutinin antigen (HA-tagged) or with c-Myc (Myc-tagged). The HA-tagged versions of constitutively active p115-RhoGEF (pCMV5-HA-p115-ΔNΔC-RhoGEF, residues 249-802) and of the dominant negative p115RhoGEF (pCMV5-ΔDH-RhoGEF with excision of residues 466-547) were gifts from Dr. Gideon Bollag (ONYX Pharmaceuticals, Richmond, CA). The HA-tagged versions of the constitutively active Cdc42 (pCDNA3-HA-Cdc42 (Q61L)) and dominant negative Cdc42 (pCDNA3-HA-Cdc42 (T17N)) as well as the constitutively active Rac1 (pCDNA3-HA-Rac1 (Q61L)) and dominant negative Rac1 (pCDNA3-HA-Rac1 (T17N)) plasmids were gifts from Dr. Richard A. Cerione (Department of Molecular Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). The c-Myc-tagged version of the dominant negative RhoA (pCDNA3-Myc-RhoA (T19N)) plasmid was a gift from Dr. Dafna Bar-Sagi (Department of Biochemistry, New York University, NY) and subsequently was re-engineered to incorporate an HA tag. The constitutively active version of RhoA (pCDNA3-myc-RhoA (Q63L)) plasmid was a gift from Dr. Alan Hall (CRC Oncogene and Signal Transduction Group, Medical Research Council Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College, London, UK). A431 cells were transfected with one or more plasmids using Lipofectamine according to manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). The A431 cells stably expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged version of β2AR (fusion of enhanced GFP moiety to the C terminus of the receptor) described previously (12Fan G. Shumay E. Wang H.H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24005-24014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13Tao J. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6419-6429Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) were utilized in experiments seeking to image the β2AR. Suppression of G Protein α Subunits—Knockdown of G protein subunits was achieved by treating the cells for 48-72 h with siRNA targeting the subunit. siRNA targeting Gαq and Gα13 were synthesized (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and introduced into A431 cells according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly cells growing in a 6-well plate in antibiotic-free medium were treated with siRNA duplex and incubated for 8 h. Thereafter the medium was supplemented with standard growth medium, and the incubation was maintained for an additional 40-64 h. siRNA-treated cells were analyzed for the efficiency of the knockdown of targeted G protein subunits by immunoblotting and thereafter used in the imaging experiments. Assay of Intracellular Accumulation of Cyclic AMP—Cells transiently transfected with the QLGα13, QLGα11, CA-p115, CA-RhoA, CA-Cdc42, and/or CA-Rac1 were seeded in a 96-well plate for 24 h. On the day of experiment, cells were treated with either LPA (5 μm) or C3 (20 μg/ml) for 1 h before the challenge with isoproterenol (10 μm). Cell culture medium then was replenished with Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer containing the phosphodiesterase inhibitor Ro-20-1724 (10 μm), and the cells were challenged with the isoproterenol for the indicated times. The reaction was terminated by the addition of ethanol to 10% (v/v), and the cyclic AMP content was measured by the competitive binding assay as described previously (14Ros M. Northup J.K. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4362-4368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assay receptor resensitization, cells were challenged with isoproterenol (10 μm) for 5 min to provoke full desensitization and then washed free of β-adrenergic agonist to allow recovery over the time period indicated (0, 30, or 60 min) before a second challenge with the β-adrenergic agonist for 5 min. Each sampling was performed in triplicates. The results displayed throughout are mean values ± S.E. from three or more separate experiments. [3H]CGP-12177 Assay of Surface β2AR—The cell surface complement of β2AR was quantified using the hydrophilic, cell-impermeable radiolabeled β-adrenergic antagonist [3H]CGP-12177. Briefly cells were treated with or without isoproterenol (10 μm for 30 min) or LPA (5 μm) at 37 °C. The cells were washed and placed on ice for 6 h in the presence of 70 nm [3H]CGP-12177 with or without propranolol (10 μm) to define the amount of nonspecific binding. At the end of the incubation period, the cell masses (in triplicate) were rapidly washed free of unbound ligand and collected on Whatman GF/C filters by vacuum filtration. The amount of [3H]CGP-12177 that was bound to cell surface β2AR was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Radioligand binding that is insensitive to the presence of propranolol (typically <10%) is defined as “nonspecific.” Confocal Microscopy—Cells stably expressing GFP-tagged β2AR were used as such or transiently transfected with an expression vector harboring the cDNA of a signaling element (where indicated) and grown on glass slides. Prior to confluence, the cell cultures were either untreated or stimulated with isoproterenol (10 μm) or LPA (5 μm). At the end of the treatments, cells were washed twice with Hanks’ balanced salt solution, fixed (100% methanol at -20 °C for 15 min), and returned to Hanks’ balanced salt solution. Fixed objects were embedded in ProLong anti-fade reagent. Images were acquired on the Zeiss LCM510 microscope fitted with an argon laser (oil immersion, 63× objective). Serial sections were acquired as a z-stack. z-stacks of images were processed using Bitplane software (Imaris 4.2) and exported as TIFF files. Statistical Analysis—The results in the figures are presented as the mean ± S.E. The data were compiled from assays sampled in triplicate from three or more separate experiments. * denotes significance of the difference from the “control” value of interest with p ≤ 0.05. For the microscopic studies, images were acquired from five to seven different fields for each condition; the fields were obtained from one of three or more duplicate experiments. Representative images are shown. LPA Suppresses β2AR-stimulated Cyclic AMP Accumulation—We explored the hypothesis that LPA action might include cross-talk to the β2AR/Gs/adenylyl cyclase signaling pathway (Fig. 1). Human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells first were treated without and with LPA (5 μm) for 30 min followed by stimulation with the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (Iso; 10 μm) for 2-15 min, and cyclic AMP accumulation was measured over a 5-min interval (Fig. 1A). LPA treatment blunted the response of the cells to stimulation with isoproterenol. The ability of the plant diterpene forskolin to stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation under these same conditions, in contrast, was unaffected by LPA. Next a time course for the action of LPA was investigated (Fig. 1B). Attenuation of β-adrenergic action by LPA was measured in the same manner over a 90-min exposure to the lipid mediator. Suppression of β-adrenergic action occurred within 30-60 min and continued to increase until the 90-min post-LPA treatment sampling, the last time point measured. The effect of LPA was examined on A431 cells with no prior stimulation by isoproterenol (Fig. 1C). When naiöve cells are treated with LPA and their ability to accumulate cyclic AMP in response to isoproterenol was measured over a 90-min period (with Iso treatment and cyclic AMP accumulation measured only over a 5-min interval at the time points indicated), the time course of LPA-induced suppression of the β-adrenergic cyclic AMP response was similar (Fig. 1, compare C with A). We tested whether LPA treatment would impact the ability of a Gαs protein-coupled receptor other than the β2-adrenergic receptor to stimulate cyclic AMP accumulation (Fig. 1, D and E). Cells were treated without and with LPA for 30 min and then stimulated with either isoproterenol (Fig. 1D) or bradykinin (Fig. 1E, BK). The cyclic AMP response of A431 cells to stimulation by bradykinin was attenuated by treating the cells with LPA as was observed for the response to stimulation of β2-adrenergic receptors with Iso (Fig. 1, A-D). The C. botulinum ADP-ribosyltransferase “C3” exotoxin targets a major LPA downstream element, the small GTPase RhoA (15Aktories K. Hall A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 415-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and has been shown to inactivate RhoA in A431 cells (16Yonemura S. Matsui T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2569-2580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As LPA appears to negatively modulate β-adrenergic signaling, treatment with the C3 exotoxin, which blocks some LPA signaling, was tested to ascertain its influence on isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation. Treatment with C3 exotoxin (20 μg/ml) potentiated the ability of isoproterenol to stimulate cyclic AMP accumulation (Fig. 1F). No significant change in cyclic AMP accumulation was observed in response to LPA as compared with Iso (Fig. 1F). To probe whether the response to LPA was mediated by Gα13, a G protein to which LPA receptors can couple, we compared the effects of LPA with that of expression of the constitutively active Q226L mutant of Gα13 (QLGα13) on the cyclic AMP response to isoproterenol stimulation (Fig. 1G). Transient expression of QLGα13 mimicked LPA action, reducing the β-adrenergic stimulation of cyclic AMP accumulation by more than 60%. The Q209L mutant of Gα11 also is constitutively active (17Ueda H. Morishita R. Itoh H. Narumiya S. Mikoshiba K. Kato K. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42527-42533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and was used as a control. Expression of Q209L mutant of Gα11 (QLGα11), in contrast to expression of QLGα13, had no influence on the ability of the β-adrenergic pathway to stimulate cyclic AMP accumulation (Fig. 1G). A major downstream effector for Gα13 is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor p115RhoGEF (18Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 19Wells C.D. Liu M.Y. Jackson M. Gutowski S. Sternweis P.M. Rothstein J.D. Kozasa T. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1174-1181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), so we investigated whether the expression of the constitutively active p115RhoGEF (CA-p115), a mutant lacking the N- and C-regulatory domains (residues 249-802) of this GEF (20Donovan S. Shannon K.M. Bollag G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 23-45PubMed Google Scholar), would influence the cyclic AMP response to isoproterenol (Fig. 1G). Transient expression of CA-p115RhoGEF mimicked LPA action and proved to be a most potent attenuator of the β-adrenergic receptor-mediated cyclic AMP response, reducing the accumulation of cyclic AMP by more than 80%. If our hypothesis that LPA was cross-talking to the β2AR/Gs/adenylyl cyclase signaling pathway through the Gα13/p115RhoGEF/RhoA triad was correct, transient transfection of the A431 cells with an expression vector harboring the dominant negative mutant (ΔDH-RhoGEF (20Donovan S. Shannon K.M. Bollag G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 23-45PubMed Google Scholar)) of RhoA (DN-RhoA) might be expected to block the attenuation by LPA. Expression of DN-RhoA indeed provoked a potentiation of the cyclic AMP response to β-adrenergic stimulation as did the treatment with the C3 exotoxin (Fig. 1, F and G). We tested the ability of the DN-RhoA to impact LPA signaling at the levels of LPA and/or p115RhoGEF (Fig. 1H). Expression of DN-RhoA abolished the ability of LPA to suppress β2AR/Gs/adenylyl cyclase signaling in response to isoproterenol. Expression of DN-RhoA likewise abolished the ability of CA-p115RhoGEF to signal to this same level (Fig. 1H). The mitogen-activated protein kinase JNK has been shown to operate downstream of the Gα13/p115RhoGEF/RhoA pathway (21Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3467) Google Scholar, 22Weston C.R. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). We examined the ability of LPA to stimulate JNK activation in A431 cells (Fig. 1I). Stimulating the cells with LPA provoked a robust activation of JNK (Fig. 1I) that was detected within 10 min of LPA treatment and maintained to 60 min. Taken together, these data demonstrate at a functional level that LPA, operating via Gα13, p115RhoA, and RhoA activation, suppresses catecholamine action mediated by β2ARs. LPA Regulates Cellular Trafficking of the β2AR—The ability of LPA to attenuate the β-adrenergic regulation of cyclic AMP accumulation provoked us to ask whether this lipid mediator also regulated the trafficking of the β2AR. RhoA action includes changes in cellular trafficking (23Bhattacharya M. Babwah A.V. Ferguson S.S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and it seemed possible that the influence of LPA via Gα13 and the ability of DN-RhoA expression to block the LPA effect (Fig. 1) was a reflection of RhoA activation. The trafficking of the β2AR was explored using a fusion protein of the human β2AR in which the enhanced GFP is engineered into the C terminus of the receptor. This GFP-tagged β2AR displays full functional capability (12Fan G. Shumay E. Wang H.H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24005-24014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13Tao J. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6419-6429Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 24Gagnon A.W. Kallal L. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6976-6981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 25Shumay E. Gavi S. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). By confocal microscopy we probed the receptor localization in both the unstimulated (-) cells as well as in cells stimulated for 30 min with the β-agonist isoproterenol (10 μm; +Iso), which caused desensitization and internalization of β2ARs (Fig. 2A). In the absence of treatment with β-adrenergic agonist, β2ARs were observed largely confined to the cell membrane (Fig. 2A, top left-hand panel, control; white arrows highlight cell membrane-associated receptor). In cells treated with isoproterenol (+Iso), the complement of cell membrane-localized β2AR was depleted and an accumulation of internalized β2AR occurred (Fig. 2A, top right-hand panel; yellow arrowheads highlight cytoplasmic, internalized receptor). Treating the cells with LPA mimicked treatment with β-adrenergic agonist, stimulating the internalization of β2AR and accumulation of the receptor in cytoplasmic locales in the absence of β-adrenergic agonist (Fig. 2A). For the cells treated with the β-adrenergic agonist or with LPA, the sequestered β2ARs were observed as large “punctate” aggregates localized to the cytoplasmic regions of the cells. Treatment with LPA and β-agonist in combination largely appeared to result in little further internalization, although some discrete, larger punctate aggregates of internalized β2AR were observed in some fields (Fig. 2A). To test further the hypothesis that LPA drives the sequestration of β2AR via LPA activation of Gα13 and of its downstream effector p115RhoGEF (26Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), cells were transiently transfected with constitutively active forms of either Gα13 (QLGα13) or p115RhoGEF (CA-p115), and the localization of the β2AR was examined by microscopy (Fig. 2A). Mimicking LPA treatment, expression of the QLGα13 alone provoked internalization of the β2AR. Treating the cells expressing the QLGα13 with the β-agonist isoproterenol resulted in little additional effect. Expression of QLGα11, in contrast, had no effect on β2AR localization; the β2ARs appeared as observed in the control, untreated cells (data not shown). Expression of CA-p115RhoGEF, like the expression of QLGα13, also mimicked LPA action and promoted receptor internalization (Fig. 2A). The data obtained by confocal analysis of the GFP-tagged β2AR were tested further and quantified independently by equilibrium binding studies of whole-cell preparations with the hydrophilic β-adrenergic antagonist [3H]CGP-12177. This CGP-12177 ligand does permeate the cell membrane and reports back from only those β2AR that are accessible on the cell surface and to the bulk solution. [3H]CGP-12177 binding data confirmed the results obtained by confocal microscopy, i.e. expression of either QLGα13 or CA-p115RhoGEF mimicked the effects of LPA itself on β2AR internalization (Fig. 2B). We also analyzed the time course for internalization of β2AR in cells treated with either LPA or Iso (Fig. 2C). The time course for Iso displayed internalization of receptors within 5 min of challenge and a plateau of maximal internalization at 30-60 min. LPA-stimulated β2AR sequestration displayed a time course similar to that observed for Iso as measured by CGP-12177 binding. If Gα13 mediates the ability of LPA to stimulate internalization of β2ARs, then suppression of this G protein α subunit would be expected to attenuate the effect of LPA on receptor trafficking. We tested this hypothesis directly using siRNA to knock down the expression of Gα13 (Fig. 2D, inset). The siRNAs effectively suppressed the expression of their cognate Gα subunit targets (Fig. 2D, inset), whereas treatment with the commercially designed control siRNA (Cont) did not. Treatment of A431 cells with siRNA targeting Gα13 (Gα13-KD) abolished the ability of LPA to internalize β2ARs (Fig. 2D), again suggesting that Gα13 specifically is coupling the LPA response to the trafficking of β2AR. Suppressing the expression of Gα13 with siRNA likewise abolished the ability of LPA to activate JNK (data not shown). Treating cells with siRNA either targeting Gαq (Gαq-KD) to suppress the expression of this G protein α subunit (Fig. 2D, inset) or with the control siRNA, in sharp contrast, had no apparent effect on the ability of LPA to internalize β2ARs (Fig. 2D). We conducted CGP-12177 binding studies in parallel to the confocal studies to quantify amounts of β2AR internalized in response to LPA versus Iso in cells treated with siRNA to knock down either Gα13 or Gαq (Fig. 2E). The data obtained from the independent CGP-12177 binding studies (Fig. 2E) agree well with results from the confocal images (Fig. 2D), i.e. Gα13 mediates LPA action on β2AR internalization. A prospective projection and sectional view of the localization of β2AR in untreated cells (control) as compared with cells expressing the constitutively active mutant of p115RhoGEF (CA-p115) was created in an attempt to obtain a more detailed depiction of the disposition of the internalized β2AR in untreated cells and cells expressing CA-p115RhoGEF (Fig. 2F). The prospective view of the native cells (control) clearly shows the localization of GFP-tagged β2AR predominantly in the cell membrane, whereas in the cells transiently transfected to express the CA-p115RhoGEF (CA-p115) translocation and internalization of the β2AR to the cytoplasm in the absence of LPA is obvious (Fig. 2F, upper panels). The cross-sectional views highlight the differences between β2AR localization in control cells as compared with cells expressing CA-p115RhoGEF. In the untreated cells, β2ARs were densely localized to the plane of the cell membrane. For the cells expressing the CA-p115RhoGEF, β2ARs localized to the cytoplasm and in close proximity to the inner leaflet of the cell membrane (Fig. 2F, lower panels). Immunoblots stained with anti-HA antibodies confirmed the expression of the HA-tagged CA-p115RhoGEF mutant in the cells (Fig. 2F, inset). LPA Regulates Internalization of the β2AR via Small Molecular Weight GTPases—We explored the effects of both C3 exotoxin and expression of DN-RhoA on the cellular localization of GFP-tagged β2AR (Fig. 3A). The patterns of localization of β2AR in the control, untreated cells (-, Fig. 3A) compared with the cells treated with either C3 exotoxin (C3) or transiently transfected to express DN-RhoA are all similar (Fig. 3A, +Iso). The internalization of the β2AR in response to isoproterenol treatment likewise was largely unaffected by treatment with C3 exotoxin or by expression of DN-RhoA. The observations from the confocal analysis were tested using the CGP-12177 radioligand binding assay (Fig. 3B). The results of both assays are in agreement; there was little change in the amount of cell membrane-localized β2AR in cells treated with either C3 exotoxin or those expressing the DN-RhoA (Fig. 3, A and B). These data suggest that the effects of LPA on β2AR trafficking may be operating via a pathway with little commonality with the Iso/β2AR/Gs/AC/cyclic AMP signaling pathway. The imaging studies revealed that activation of the LPA/Gα13/p115RhoGEF pathway leads to a sequestration of β2AR from the cell membrane in the absence of β-adrenergic agonist. The results from studies of the cyclic AMP response suggest that signaling downstream of p115RhoGEF involves Rho family GTPases. We tested the role of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in β2AR trafficking by examining the effects of expression of the constitutively active mutants of each of these small molecular weight GTPases on the complement of cell surface-localized β2AR (Fig. 3C). Cells were treated either with LPA or transiently transfected to express CA mutants of various elements in the Gα13/p115RhoGEF/RhoA pathway. Equilibrium binding studies of cell surface β2AR were conducted using [3H]CGP-12177. Treating cells with LPA reduced the complement of β2AR on the cell membrane (Fig. 3C), as expected, as did expression of either QLGα13 or CA-p115 (Fig. 3C). Expression of t"
https://openalex.org/W2099741174,"kcne are evolutionarily conserved genes that encode accessory subunits of voltage-gated K(+) (Kv) channels. Missense mutations in kcne1, kcne2, and kcne3 are linked to congenital and acquired channelopathies in Homo sapiens. Here we show an unique example of conservation of kcne activities at genetic, physiological, functional, and pathophysiological level in Caenorhabditis elegans. Thus, mps-4 is the homologue of kcne1 that operates in human heart and inner ear. Like its KCNE relatives, MPS-4 assembles with a Kv channel, EXP-2, to form a complex that controls pharyngeal muscle contractility. MPS-4 modulates EXP-2 function in a similar fashion as KCNE proteins endow human channels. When defective, MPS-4, can induce abnormal repolarization by mechanisms that resemble the way KCNE proteins are thought to provoke arrhythmia in human heart. Mutation of a conserved aspartate residue associated with human disease (MPS-4-D74N) alters the functional attributes of the C. elegans current. Taken together these data underscore a significant conservation of KCNE activities in different pumps. This implies that C. elegans can develop into a system to study the molecular and genetic basis of KCNE-mediated muscle contractility and disease states."
