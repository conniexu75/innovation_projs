By using thioflavin T, a dye that specifically binds to fibrillar structures, we found that metals such as Zn(II) and Cu(II) normally inhibit amyloid β-aggregation. Another method for detecting Aβ, which does not distinguish the types of aggregates, showed that these metals induce a non-β-sheeted aggregation, as reported previously. Secondary structural analysis and microscopic studies revealed that metals induced Aβ to make non-fibrillar aggregates by disrupting β-sheet formation. These non-fibrillar Aβ aggregates displayed much weaker Congo Red birefringence, and in separate cell culture experiments, were less toxic than self β-aggregates, as demonstrated by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The toxicity of soluble Aβ was enhanced in the presence of Cu(II), which suggests the previously hypothesized role of Aβ in generating oxidative stress. Finally, under an acidic condition, similar to that in the inflammation associated with senile plaques, β-aggregation was robustly facilitated at one specific concentration of Zn(II) in the presence of heparin. However, because a higher concentration of Zn(II) virtually abolished this abnormal phenomenon, and at normal pH any concentrations strongly inhibit β-aggregation and its associated cytotoxicity, including its anti-oxidative nature we suggest that Zn(II) has an overall protective effect against β-amyloid toxicity.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4225) Google Scholar). Although Aβ is undisputedly associated with the pathology of AD, it is still an open question as to what specific aspects of Aβ and its processing are the important variables in the pathophysiology of the disease. For example, fibrillar Aβ, but not non-amyloidogenic, amorphous aggregates of Aβ, was reported to cause neuronal cell death in primary rat hippocampal cultures (3Lorenzo A. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12243-12247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar), and soluble monomeric species of Aβ are relatively nontoxic as compared with fibrillar Aβ (4Moir R.D.

Thus, these in vitro studies suggest that the degree of β-aggregation is particularly important for neurotoxicity to occur (5Pike C.J. Burdick D. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1676-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Pike C.J. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. Brain Res. 1991; 563: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, 7Simmons L.K.

Brain Res. 1994; 639: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, many controversial results from in vivo studies have been reported concerning the pathological role of plaque formation in AD. Irizarry et al.(9Irizarry M.C. Soriano F. McNamara M. Page K.J. Schenk D. Games D. Hyman B.T. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7053-7059Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that transgenic (TG) mice expressing human Aβ failed to exhibit neuronal loss despite depositing substantial amounts of Aβ. On the other hand, TG mice that express Swedish mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) formed plaques that were detected by both an anti-APP antibody and a β-sheet specific dye (10Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G.M. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3700) Google Scholar). Moreover, these APP TG mice also displayed memory deficits. Taken together, these results indicate that, although the plaque assembly process may require further investigation, amyloid β-aggregation certainly is an essential event in the pathogenesis of AD. Based on these lines of evidence, the search for a compound that interrupts β-aggregation and thus protects against its neurotoxicity is of great interest. One such promising family of compounds is metals. Initially, however, metals attracted attention in a negative way. It was reported that zinc induced the aggregation of Aβ (11Bush A.I. Pettingell W.H. Multhaup G. de Paradis M. Vonsattel J.P. Gusella J.F. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Tanzi R.E. Science. 1994; 265: 1464-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar, 12Brown A.M.

Additionally, aluminum and iron were reported to promote the aggregation of Aβ at physiological concentrations (15Dyrks T. Dyrks E. Hartmann T. Masters C. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18210-18217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, most of these metal ions, at one time or another, have been proposed as risk factors for the development of AD (16McLachlan J.C. Lancet. 1991; 337: 742Abstract PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 17Frederickson C.J. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1989; 31: 145-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 18Connor J.R. Snyder B.S.

Pilot studies in our laboratory, however, provided new evidence that certain metals may in fact inhibit the formation of β-aggregates. This finding prompted us to conduct a more thorough examination of this metal-induced inhibition of β-aggregation. In the present study, we sought to identify and characterize the different types of Aβ aggregates produced in the presence of different metal ions. We also assessed the cytotoxicity of these aggregates. Although previous studies describing the effects of metals on Aβ-associated aggregation measured overall aggregation (11Bush A.I.

Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). Along with results using this specific dye, as well as results showing structural differences of aggregates, revealed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, Congo Red staining (22Klunk W.E. Pettegrew J.W. Abraham D.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 23Carter D.B. Chou K.C. Neurobiol.

Moreover, this inhibitory effect of metals on β-aggregation via conformational enforcement was directly correlated with their protective effects against cell toxicity, measured by the reducing rate of 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (26Abe K.

Because we also recognize that Cu(II) is a redox-active metal, we performed experiments that shed new light on two kinds of effects Cu(II) has on Aβ cytotoxicity in its soluble state (30Huang X.

Finally, we report that under an experimental condition that models the acidotic inflammatory response with the involvement of heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) (36Kisilevsky R. Lemieux L.J.

Chem. 1985; 260: 12142-12147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), β-aggregation is strongly induced in the presence of Zn(II) at a specific concentration. We propose a hypothetical mechanism of inflammation-associated amyloidogenesis to account for these data. Nonetheless, since a higher concentration of Zn(II) diminished this phenomenon, we suggest that Zn(II) has therapeutic possibilities. Heparin (average molecular mass 6000 Da), albumin (BSA), ThT, and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).N,N-Dimethylformamide, sodium lauryl sulfate (SDS), Congo Red stain solution, Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, and CuCl2·2H2O were purchased from Nacalai tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Other metals including ZnCl2, AlCl3·6H2O, and FeCl2·4H2O were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical (Osaka, Japan). Human β-amyloid 1–40 was obtained from two companies: one lot (K-40-2) from U. S. Peptide (Fullerton, CA), and five lots (491131, 500520, 500324, 501001, and 510116) from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). Human Aβ1–42 of one lot (500425) was also purchased from Peptide Institute. All peptide samples were high performance liquid chromatography-purified and were in trifluoroacetate salt form. A stock solution of Aβ was prepared by dissolving powdered Aβ peptide in 100% HFIP to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. After shaking for 2 h at 4 °C, the Aβ stock solution was aliquoted into siliconized tubes and stored at −20 °C. Just prior to each experiment, aliquots were spin-vacuumed using an Integrated SpeedVac system (Savant) and then dissolved either in a Tris-buffered solution or in serum-free 5% Neurobasal medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). The degree of β-aggregation was determined using the fluorescent dye, ThT, which specifically binds to fibrous structures (19LeVine III, H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar, 20Castillo G.M. Ngo C. Cummings J. Wight T.N. Snow A.D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2452-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). First, Aβ stock solution (see above) was diluted with either 20 mm Tris-HCl alone or with 20 mm Tris-HCl and different concentrations of different metals. ThT was added to each test sample to a final concentration of 10 µm. Each sample was prepared in Black Cliniplates (Labsystems) and shaken for 10 s prior to each measurement. Measurements were carried out every 20 min. The relative degree of β-aggregation was assessed in terms of fluorescence intensity, which was measured at 37 °C using a Fluoroskan Ascent FL spectrophotometer (Labsystems). Measurements were performed at an excitation wavelength of 444 nm and an emission of 485 nm, wavelengths that result in the optimum detection of bound ThT. To account for background fluorescence, the fluorescence intensity measured from each control solution without Aβ was subtracted from that of each solution containing Aβ. The fluorescence spectra of Aβ40 from different commercial sources and from different lots were in good agreement. The effect of different metals on total Aβ aggregation was assessed using an optical density (OD) assay. We adopted a modified procedure described previously (14Atwood C.S. Moir R.D. Huang X. Scarpa R.C. Bacarra N.M. Romano D.M. Hartshorn M.A. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12817-12826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Aβ stock solutions were first diluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected for use in the aggregation experiments. The supernatant containing soluble Aβ was mixed with the same volume of either Tris buffer alone or buffer containing different concentrations of one of various metals (e.g. CuCl2, ZnCl2). The concentration of Aβ in each test sample was ∼10 µm. At this point each sample was divided into two equal volumes; 1) one volume was diluted 10 times with buffer and termed “before,” and 2) the remaining volume was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and termed “after.” At this point, to assess Aβ concentration, the optical density (OD) of the “before” samples (ODbefore) was measured using a DU640 UV spectrophotometer (Beckman) set at a wavelength of 214 nm. After 30 min the “after” samples were ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C using an Optima TL Ultracentrifuge (Beckman). Supernatants were collected, diluted 10 times with buffer, and absorb-ance was measured (ODafter) as described above. The percentage of total aggregation was calculated as the ratio of the difference between ODbefore and ODafter divided by ODbefore as follows. (ODbefore−ODafter)÷ODbefore×100%(Eq. 1) Note that in all the samples containing metal ions, background signals were determined by measuring the OD of “blanks” containing only metals, and were subtracted from the OD of all test samples containing both Aβ and metals prior to calculating the percentage of total aggregation. Metal-induced changes in Aβ structure were determined as follows. First, 100 µg of Aβ peptide dissolved in 100 µl of HFIP was evaporated under nitrogen gas, then dissolved in 460 µl of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) with or without 100 µm metal ions (i.e.CuCl2, ZnCl2). At this point the concentration of Aβ in each test sample was 50 µm. Second, half of the Aβ sample was poured into a 1-mm pathlength quartz cuvette and promptly scanned with a J-720WI CD spectropolarimeter (Jasco). The remaining halves were incubated for 12 h at 37 °C prior to being scanned. All CD measurements were carried out at 37 °C using the following parameters: 1-nm bandwidth, 5 nm/min run speed, 1-nm step size, 2-s response time, and averaged over three runs. The molecular ellipticities, [Θ], of each sample were calculated using algorithms provided by the manufacturer. The CDs of the buffers used, and when applicable the CDs of each metal solution, were subtracted from the appropriate CDs of each sample prior to the calculation of molecular ellipticities. Congo Red staining was used to examine the morphology of metal-induced Aβ aggregates. Aβ stock solution was incubated with either 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) alone or Tris buffer containing 20 µm CuCl2 or 20 µm ZnCl2 overnight at 37 °C. Congo Red was then added to each sample and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Samples were applied within a circular area delimited by a PAP Pen (Daido Sangyo) on APS pre-coated glass slides (Matsunami), and covered with cover glass (Matsunami). The slides were examined with an Eclipse E600 (Nikon) light microscope equipped with a polarizing filter. The ultrastructural characteristics of metal-induced Aβ aggregates were examined as follows. Aβ40 was incubated for 13 h at 37 °C with or without either 4 mm CuCl2 or 4 mm ZnCl2as described above (see “ThT Assay”). Each sample was mixed for 10 s every 20 min. Three µl of each sample was applied to 300-mesh copper grids with Formvar supporting membrane, blotted with filter paper, and stained with 1% (w/v) neutralized tungstophosphoric acid (Nacalai tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan). The specimens were examined on a Leo 912AB electron microscope (Leo, Oberkochen, Germany), at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. Two lines of cells, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and neuronal hippocampal cells, were used to test the toxic effects of metal-induced Aβ aggregation as assessed in the MTT assay (see below). These cells were cultured as follows. HEK 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and incubated in a humidified chamber (85% humidity) containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. On the morning of Aβ treatment, the cell culture medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM, and the cells were plated onto a 96-well coated plate (Corning) at a final cell count of 20,000 cells/well. The cell viability was subsequently assessed using the MTT assay (see below). Neuronal cultures were established from the hippocampi of 18-day-old Wistar rat embryos. Animal care and treatment were in accordance with institutional guidelines. The neurons were initially treated with filtered papain (10 units/ml) solution (Worthington Biochemical Corp.) containing 5 mml-cysteine (Sigma), 1 mm EDTA (Sigma), 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (Sigma), and 100 µg/ml BSA (Sigma), 0.01% DNase I (Sigma), and PBS. Cells were plated onto 24-well plates (Corning) coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma) to a final count of 3.25 × 105/well. The hippocampal cultures were grown at 5% CO2 and 85% humidity for 6 days in serum-free Neurobasal medium containing B-27 supplement (Life Technologies, Inc.), 500 µml-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10 µg/ml gentamicin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cell viability was subsequently assessed with the MTT assay. The toxic effects of spontaneous β-aggregation and metal-induced β-aggregation of Aβ on cell cultures were assessed. Solutions containing either Aβ alone or Aβ and metal ions were prepared as described for the ThT assay. For the experiments using soluble Aβ samples, β-aggregation was assessed using the ThT assay, and then the samples were transferred immediately into wells containing the HEK 293 cell (see “Cell Cultures”). After certain periods, MTT was added to each well and the plate was kept in a CO2incubator for an additional 2–4 h. The cells were then lysed by the addition of a lysis solution (50% dimethylformamide, 20% SDS, pH 4.7) and were incubated overnight or longer. The degree of MTT reduction in each sample was subsequently assessed by measuring absorption at 570 nm at 37 °C using a Bio Kinetics EL340 reader (Bio-Tek Instruments). Background absorbance values, as assessed from cell-free wells, were subtracted from the absorption values of each test sample. Percentage of MTT reduction was calculated by taking the average of values from a condition without both Aβ and metal as 100% in each experiment. For the experiments using pre-incubated Aβ samples, the relative degree of β-aggregation in each sample was regularly monitored using the ThT assay until β-aggregation reached a maximum. At this point, the samples were transferred into wells containing either the HEK 293 cell cultures or the hippocampal neuronal cultures prepared as described above. In experiments carried out in neuronal cultures, serum-free Neurobasal medium (final concentration: 50%) without B-27 supplement was the condition of medium. Cell viability was assessed with the MTT assay as described above for the experiments using soluble Aβ. Using ThT, a fluorescent dye that specifically binds with fibrous structures (19LeVine III, H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar, 20Castillo G.M. Ngo C. Cummings J. Wight T.N. Snow A.D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2452-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), we determined the time course of β-aggregation formed by Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the presence of various metals (Fig.1). As predicted, the β-aggregation kinetics were sigmoidal. The final values were remarkable, however, because they were apparently opposite to those in previous reports (11Bush A.I. Pettingell W.H.

Unexpectedly, the maximum β-aggregation occurred in conditions that did not contain metals (Fig. 1 A), and lesser amount of β-aggregation occurred in conditions that contained the 20 µm metal concentration. Additionally, the rank order of metal efficacy on β-aggregation, was nearly opposite to that reported previously (11Bush A.I. Pettingell W.H. Multhaup G. de Paradis M. Vonsattel J.P. Gusella J.F. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Tanzi R.E. Science. 1994; 265: 1464-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar) in which aggregation was measured using different methods. To determine whether the particular metal concentration we initially chose contributed to these unexpected results, the ThT experiments were repeated with various concentrations of the metals. The final β-aggregation values shown in Fig. 2reveal that both Zn(II) and Cu(II) inhibited the β-aggregation of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 in a concentration-dependent manner. The same results were obtained when the experiment was repeated using different commercial sources and lots of Aβ. Using a different assay to assess aggregation, the OD214 absorbance assay, we found, in contrast to the ThT results, both Zn(II) and Cu(II) effectively induced Aβ40 aggregation (Fig.3), although Cu(II) ranked second to Zn(II) in efficacy. These results using the absorbance assay are generally consistent with previous reports (14Atwood C.S. Moir R.D. Huang X. Scarpa R.C. Bacarra N.M. Romano D.M. Hartshorn M.A. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J.

Ten µmAβ40 (pH 7.4) was incubated with or without 20 µm metal ions at 37 °C for 30 min, and the percentage of total aggregation for each condition was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are means ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In order to explain the apparently discordant results using the OD214 or ThT assay, we considered the hypothesis that they measure different types of amyloid aggregates: the ThT assay directly measures only β-aggregation (19LeVine III, H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar, 20Castillo G.M. Ngo C. Cummings J. Wight T.N. Snow A.D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2452-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) because of the specificity of thioflavin T for fibrous structures, whereas the OD214assay indirectly measures all types of aggregation (11Bush A.I. Pettingell W.H. Multhaup G. de Paradis M. Vonsattel J.P. Gusella J.F. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Tanzi R.E. Science. 1994; 265: 1464-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar, 14Atwood C.S.

Moreover, because metal ions inducedall types of aggregation of Aβ40 (i.e. as measured in the OD214 assay) but inhibited β-aggregation (i.e. as measured in the ThT assay), we hypothesized that metal ions must induce the formation of a second non-β-sheeted type of aggregate. This hypothesis was addressed by examining the secondary structure of Aβ40 in either the absence or presence of various metal ions using CD spectroscopy. The spectral curve of Aβ in the absence of Zn(II) or Cu(II) before incubation has a minimum ellipticity at around 200 nm (Fig.4), indicating that the secondary structure of Aβ under these conditions is a random coil structure (39Perczel A. Hollosi M. Fasman G.D. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum Press, New York1996: 285-367Crossref Google Scholar). After 12 h of incubation, the spectral curve for Aβ alone shifted to the right, displaying a minimum at around 210 nm (Fig. 4). This kind of curve is characteristic of the β-sheet structure. In contrast, the spectral curves of Aβ incubated with either Zn(II) or Cu(II) before and after incubation were completely different from either of these patterns (Fig. 4), indicating neither the β-sheet nor the random coil conformations were present. Both of these curves had slightly negative ellipticities from 220 to 230 nm and positive ellipticities around 203 nm. This positive ellipticity is especially conspicuous in the curve for the Aβ sample containing Cu(II) ions. These curves most closely resemble the type II β-turn conformation, although it is insufficient to make a definitive assignment using only CD spectra. Nonetheless, the differe"

It has been suggested that the presence of saturated fatty acyl chains on proteins is conducive for their insertion into liquid ordered lipid domains present in rafts. The ability of unsaturated dietary fatty acids to be attached to Src family kinases has not been investigated. Here we demonstrate that heterogeneous fatty acylation of Src family kinases occurs and that the nature of the attached fatty acid influences raft-mediated signal transduction. By using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, we show that in addition to 14:0 (myristate), 14:1 and 14:2 fatty acids can be attached to the N-terminal glycine of the Src family kinase Fyn when the growth media are supplemented with these dietary fatty acids. Moreover, we synthesized novel iodinated analogs of oleate and stearate, and we showed that heterogeneous S-acylation can occur on cysteine residues within Fyn as well as Gα, GAP43, and Ras. Modification of Fyn with unsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids reduced its raft localization and resulted in decreased T cell signal transduction. These studies establish that heterogeneous fatty acylation is a widespread occurrence that serves to regulate signal transduction by membrane-bound proteins.

Myristate is co-translationally attached to the N-terminal glycine through an amide linkage, whereas palmitate is attached post-translationally to proteins via a thioester linkage (S-acylation). There is increasing evidence in the literature suggesting that protein fatty acylation is not restricted to myristate and palmitate. For example, the retinal proteins recoverin and transducin have been shown to be heterogeneously fatty acylated via amide linkage with 12:0, 14:1, and 14:2 fatty acids in addition to 14:0 myristate (1Dizhoor A., M. Ericsson L.H. Johnson R.S. Kumar S. Olshevskaya E. Zozulya S. Neubert T.A. Stryer L. Hurley J.B. Walsh K.A. J. Biol.

However, analysis of the amide-linked fatty acids from total proteins in heart, liver, brain, and retina indicated that heterogenous myristoylation is restricted to the retina (2Johnson D.R.

S-Acylation of proteins is more diverse, and numerous reports have shown that some proteins are S-acylated with fatty acids longer and shorter than palmitate. For example, stearate, oleate, arachidonate, and eicosapentaenoate have been shown to be acylated to “palmitoylated” proteins in platelets as well as other cell types (5Muszbek L. Laposata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18243-18248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of S-linked fatty acids released from total heart and liver proteins reveals the presence of detectable amounts of 14:0, 18:0,1 18:1, and 18:2 fatty acids in addition to 16:0 (4Demar Jr., J.C. Anderson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31362-31368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Moreover, the pool of fatty acids covalently bound to platelet proteins via thioester linkages can be altered by exogenously supplied fatty acids (6Muszbek L. Haramura G. Cluette-Brown J.E. Van Cott E.M. Laposata M. Lipids. 1999; 34: 331-337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether S-acylation with different fatty acids affects protein localization and function has not yet been elucidated. A number of palmitoylated signaling molecules, such as Src family kinases, G proteins, and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase are enriched in membrane microdomains known as rafts that are resistant to low temperature extraction by non-ionic detergent. Palmitoylation has been shown to be required for localization of these signaling molecules to rafts (7Shaul P.W. Smart E.J. Robinson L.J. German Z. Yuhanna I.S. Ying Y. Anderson R.G.W. Michel T. J.

Many of the critical signaling components involved in T cell receptor-mediated signaling are localized to rafts, including Fyn, Lck, and LAT (10Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Activation of the T cell receptor results in recruitment of other signaling molecules to rafts, including the ζ chain of the T cell receptor, ZAP-70, Vav, and phospholipase Cγ1 (11Xavier R. Brennan T. Li Q. McCormack C. Seed B. Immunity. 1998; 8: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 12Montixi C. Langlet C. Bernard A.-M. Thimonier J. Dubois C. Wurbel M.-A. Chauvin J.-P. Pierres M. He H.-T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5334-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The importance of rafts for T cell receptor signaling is illustrated by the finding that disruption of raft structure by agents such as filipin or nystatin inhibits early steps of T cell receptor activation. Moreover, mutation of the palmitoylation sites within LAT prevents LAT partitioning to rafts and consequently inhibits the recruitment of LAT-binding proteins such as Vav and phospholipase Cγ1 to rafts (13Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Tribe R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). These data imply that partitioning of proteins into rafts enhances the protein/protein and protein/lipid interactions that are critical for efficient signal transduction in T cells. A recent study reported that incubation of T cells with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)1 inhibits T cell receptor-mediated signal transduction by displacing Lck and Fyn from rafts (14Stulnig T.M. Berger M. Sigmund T. Raederstorff D. Stockinger H. Waldhausl W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Our laboratory then showed that PUFAs inhibit Fyn palmitoylation and localization to rafts in COS-1 cells (15Webb Y. Hermida-Matsumoto L. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 261-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). We postulated that S-acylation of Fyn with PUFAs was occurring and thereby altering Fyn localization within the plasma membrane. Lipids with unsaturated fatty acid chains are excluded from rafts, and it is likely that proteins acylated with unsaturated fatty acids may also exhibit altered association with these specialized membrane microdomains. Here, we investigated how dietary fatty acids affect fatty acylation, membrane localization, and signal transduction capacity of Src family kinases. The aims of the present study were as follows: 1) to determine whether Src family kinases can be acylated with fatty acids other than myristate and palmitate; 2) if so, to determine how differential fatty acylation influences the ability of Src family kinases to interact with the membrane and other signal transducing molecules. Here we show that the Src family member Fyn can be heterogeneously “N-myristoylated” with 14:1 and 14:2 fatty acids in addition to 14:0 myristate. In addition, we show that Fyn can also be heterogeneously S-acylated with dietary fatty acids other than palmitate, including oleic acid and arachidonic acid. Moreover, incorporation of unsaturated fatty acids displaces Fyn from membrane rafts, which prevents it from interacting with other signaling molecules and results in the inhibition of signal transduction. Palmitic acid, oleic acid, arachidonic acid, andcis-5,8,11,14,17-eicosapentaenoic acid were purchased from Sigma. 5-cis-Tetradecenoic acid and 5-cis,8-cis-tetradecadienoic acid were kindly provided by Dr. Horst Schulz.

Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The synthesis of ω-iodooctadecanoic acid and ω-iodooctadecenoic acid was carried out by Dr. William Bornmann at the Core Chemistry Facility of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Synthesis methods are available upon request. Monoclonal anti-pErk, rabbit polyclonal anti-Ha-Ras, and polyclonal anti-caveolin antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-MAP kinase antibody was from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-LAT antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Monoclonal anti-Fyn was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The rabbit polyclonal antiserum to Fyn used for immunoprecipitation was described previously (16Wolven A. Okamura H. Rosenblatt Y. Resh M.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1159-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). OKT3 monoclonal antibody was obtained from the Monoclonal Antibody Core Facility at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (New York). COS-1 cells and Jurkat T cells were maintained as described previously (16Wolven A. Okamura H. Rosenblatt Y. Resh M.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1159-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Fyn chimeras Gαo(10)-Fyn, GAP43(10)-Fyn, G2A, C3SFyn-Ha-Ras, and G12V-Ha-Ras have been described previously (16Wolven A. Okamura H. Rosenblatt Y. Resh M.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1159-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The chimeric construct (C3,6S)Fyn16TevEGFPHis6 was prepared as follows. The N-terminal 16 residues of Fyn, with cysteines 3 and 6 mutated to serines, were fused to the N terminus of eGFP. The sequence encoding the 7-amino acid (Glu-Asn-Leu-Tyr-Phe-Gln-Gly) cleavage site for Tev protease was then inserted after residue 16 of Fyn to facilitate the mass spectrometric analysis. A His tag was attached to the C terminus of the chimeric construct to facilitate protein purification. The chimeric construct (G2A,C3,6S)Fyn16TevEGFPHis6 was prepared by mutating the Gly-2 of (C3,6S)Fyn16TevEGFPHis6to Ala. COS-1 cells were cotransfected with (C3,6S)Fyn16TevEGFPHis6 or (G2A,C3,6S)Fyn16TevEGFPHis6 constructs and a human N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) construct at a ratio of 3:2. After 24 h of transfection, cells were incubated for 12 h with either 100 µm tetradecanoic acid (14:0), 5-cis-tetradecenoic acid (14:1), or 5-cis,8-cis-tetradecadienoic acid in DMEM containing 2% dialyzed FBS, 0.25% defatted BSA (Sigma) at 37 °C. Typically, 20 plates of cells were harvested, lysed in hypotonic buffer, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min. The cell pellets were then dissolved in 8 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% CHAPS, 5 mm imidazole, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 15 min, the supernatant was applied to a column that contained a 2-ml suspension of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and was previously equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was extensively washed with buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole before it was eluted with 3 ml of elution buffer containing 20 mmTris (pH 8.0) and 1 m imidazole. The protein was concentrated and diluted with 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0) buffer. Protein digestion with Tev protease was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Modified peptides were purified over a Poros 50 R1 (Perspective, Framingham, MA) reversed phase micro-tip for analysis, as described (17Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Lacomis L. Grewal A. Annan R.S. MacNulty D.E. Carr S.A. Tempst P. J. Chromatogr. 1998; 826: 167-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MS) was then carried out using a REFLEX III (Bruker-Franzen; Bremen, Germany) instrument equipped with a 337-nm nitrogen laser, a gridless pulsed extraction ion source, and a 2-GHz digitizer. Aliquots (0.5 µl) were deposited on the probe surface, mixed with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid solution, and allowed to dry. The instrument was operated in reflector mode; 25 kV ion acceleration, 26.25 kV reflector, and −1.4 kV multiplier voltages were used. Ion extraction was done 200 ns after each laser irradiance by pulsing down the source extraction lens to 17.7 kV from its initial 25-kV level to give proper time-lag focus conditions at the detector. Spectra were obtained by averaging multiple signals; laser irradiance and number of acquisitions (typically 100–150) were individually adjusted to yield maximum peak deflections. External calibrations were used throughout. Cell labeling was carried out as described previously (16Wolven A. Okamura H. Rosenblatt Y. Resh M.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1159-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 18van't Hof W. Resh M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, prior to labeling, cells expressing Fyn, Fyn mutants, or Fyn chimeras were starved for 1 h in DMEM containing 2% dialyzed FBS and then labeled for 4 h at 37 °C with 25–50 µCi/ml of tritiated fatty acids, 16-[125I]iodohexadecanoic acid, 18-[125I]iodooctadecanoic acid, or 18-[125I]iodooctadecenoic acid in DMEM containing 2% dialyzed FBS and 0.5% defatted BSA (Sigma). Cells were homogenized in hypotonic buffer and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min to obtain supernatants (S100) and pellets (P100) as described previously (19Alland L. Peseckis S.M. Atherton R.E. Berthiaume L. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16701-16705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was performed in RIPA buffer with anti-Fyn antibody as described previously (19Alland L. Peseckis S.M. Atherton R.E. Berthiaume L. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16701-16705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolation of Triton X-100-insoluble membrane fractions was carried out essentially as described (20Manes S. Mira E. Gomez-Mouton C. Lacalle R.A. Keller P. Labrador J.P. Martinez-A C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6211-6220Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Fatty acids were first dissolved in ethanol, and ethanol was then removed under N2. A 2.5% BSA solution containing growth medium and 2% dialyzed FBS was added to the fatty acids, and the suspension was sonicated for 2 min to generate a BSA-fatty acid complex. COS-1 cells expressing wild type Fyn were incubated for 12 h in DMEM containing 2% dialyzed FBS and 0.25% defatted BSA supplemented with either 100 µm myristic acid or 5-cis,8-cis-tetradecadienoic acid. For Jurkat T cells, ∼2 × 107 cells were incubated for 48 h with 50 µm of either stearic acid, arachidonic acid, orcis-5,7,11,14,17-eicosapentaenoic acid in RPMI medium containing 2% dialyzed FBS and 0.25% defatted BSA. Cells were washed with STE (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA) and lysed in 300 µl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mmNa3VO4) supplemented with protease inhibitors for 15 min in ice. After homogenization with 30 strokes of a loose fitting Dounce homogenizer, lysates were mixed with 420 µl of 60% Optiprep to make a final concentration of 35% Optiprep. Half of the lysate was sequentially overlaid with 3.5 ml of 30% Optiprep in lysis buffer and 200 µl of lysis buffer in an SW55 tube. After centrifugation at 170,000 × g (37, 500 rpm) for 4 h in an SW55 rotor, five fractions were collected from the top to the bottom. RIPA buffer (5×) was added to solubilize the pellets. After clarification by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min, proteins were concentrated by precipitation with 20% trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. To study raft localization of fatty acid radiolabeled Fyn, COS-1 cells expressing Fyn were incubated with 25–50 µCi/ml of either 16-[125I]iodohexadecanoic acid, 18-[125I]iodooctadecanoic acid, or 18-[125I]iodooctadecenoic acid as described previously (16Wolven A. Okamura H. Rosenblatt Y. Resh M.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1159-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Cells were washed and scraped off the plate with STE buffer and subjected to the raft isolation procedure as described above. Fractions were collected and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Fyn antibody, followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting or phosphorimaging. Jurkat T cells were incubated for 48 h with 50 µm of either stearic acid, arachidonic acid, cis-5,7,11,14,17-eicosapentaenoic acid in RPMI medium containing 2% dialyzed FBS and 0.25% defatted BSA as described above. The cells were washed with STE, centrifuged, and resuspended in RPMI at ∼1 × 107 cells/ml. After stimulation with anti-CD3 OKT3 monoclonal antibody (0.3 mg/ml) for 3 min at 37 °C, the cells were centrifuged, washed, and lysed in RIPA buffer. Lysates were analyzed for the presence of active MAP kinase by immunoblotting with a monoclonal pERK antibody and for total MAP kinase by immunoblotting with a polyclonal anti-MAP kinase antibody. Analysis of covalently bound fatty acids was performed as described (19Alland L. Peseckis S.M. Atherton R.E. Berthiaume L. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16701-16705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-1 cells expressing Fyn were labeled with either 16-[125I]iodohexadecanoic acid, 18-[125I]iodooctadecanoic acid, or 18-[125I]iodooctadecenoic acid as described above. Following immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with anti-Fyn antibody and electrophoresis, the wet gel slice containing the Fyn band was excised and treated with 1.5 m sodium hydroxide overnight at room temperature. After acidification, the mixture was extracted with chloroform twice. The combined chloroform extracts were concentrated under nitrogen and analyzed by reversed phase thin layer chromatography. The TLC plate was developed with 1:1.75:1.75 water:glacial acetic acid:acetonitrile. Following air drying, the plate was analyzed by phosphorimaging. COS-1 cells expressing GAP43(10)-Fyn chimeras were labeled with either 16-[125I]iodohexadecanoic acid, 18-[125I]iodooctadecanoic acid, or 18-[125I]iodooctadecenoic acid as described above. Following immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with anti-Fyn antibody, the samples were electrophoresed on two separate gels. After electrophoresis, the gels were first fixed in a 50% ethanol, 5% acetic acid for 45 min and then washed with water. One gel was treated overnight with 2 m hydroxylamine (pH 7.0) and the other was treated with 2 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.0). The gels were rinsed with water, dried, and analyzed by phosphorimaging. Studies of proteinN-myristoylation have shown that in addition to 14:0 myristate, heterogeneous fatty acylation with 12:0, 14:1, and 14:2 fatty acids can occur on retinal proteins but not on proteins isolated from heart and liver. However, no study to date has directly examined whether Src family kinases can be N-myristoylated with fatty acids other than myristate. This question is important to address because acylation with unsaturated fatty acids could potentially alter the membrane localization and signaling properties of Src family kinases. We therefore designed a construct in which N-terminal acylation of the Src family kinase Fyn could be directly monitored using mass spectrometric techniques. First, the N-terminal 16 amino acids of Fyn were fused to eGFP. Cysteine residues at positions 3 and 6 of Fyn were mutated to serine in order to limit fatty acylation to the N-terminal glycine residue. We have previously shown that (C3,6S)Fyn incorporates myristate as efficiently as wild type Fyn. Next, the 7-amino acid recognition sequence of Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease was inserted between residue 16 of Fyn and the eGFP sequence, in order to generate a unique cleavage sequence near the Fyn N terminus. Finally, the (C3,6S)Fyn16TevEGFP construct was tagged at the C terminus with 6 histidines in order to facilitate purification (Fig. 1 A). COS-1 cells were co-transfected with the (C3,6S)Fyn16TevEGFPhis6 construct and the cDNA for human NMT, and cell lysates were subjected to affinity chromatography on a Ni2+ chelate resin. The purified protein was then digested in vitro with TEV protease, and the released products were subjected to MALDI-TOF MS. The instrument employed (REFLEX III; Bruker-Franzen) has the resolving power to distinguish between isotopic species (resulting from naturally occurring C-12 and C-13 isotopes) of any particular acylated peptide of unique elemental composition. The predicted monoisotopic molecular mass of an N-myristoylated peptide (singly protonated) derived from cleavage of the (C3,6S)Fyn16TevEGFPhis6 construct is 2625.39. As depicted in Fig. 1 B, the heterogeneous peak is the isotopic envelope with an experimental monoisotopic mass,m/z = 2625.44, consistent with the mass expected after removal of the initiating methionine and modification of the Fyn N-terminal glycine with amide-linked 14:0 fatty acid. To verify that the Fyn N terminus was N-myristoylated, glycine 2 was mutated to alanine to generate (G2A,C3,6S)Fyn16TevEGFPhis6, and this mutant was analyzed as described above. The mass of the released peptide was 2471.20 (Fig. 1 C), consistent with an acetylated N terminus. The next set of experiments was designed to determine whether growth of cells in media enriched with different dietary fatty acids could alter the profile of fatty acids acylated to Fyn. COS-1 cells transfected with (C3,6S)Fyn16TevEGFPhis6 were grown in media containing 5-cis-14:1 fatty acid, and the protein was purified, cleaved with TEV protease, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. As depicted in Fig. 1 D, in addition to the peak ofm/z = 2625.44 corresponding to 14:0 modified Fyn, an additional peak of m/z = 2623.28 was apparent, which likely represents Fyn modified with the 14:1 fatty acid. This conclusion is supported by the finding that incubation of cells in media containing 5-cis,8-cis-14:2 fatty acid resulted in the generation of a peak of m/z = 2621.17 in addition to the 2625.39 myristoylated peak. The percent substitutions with 14:1 and 14:2, as calculated from the second isotopic peak in each of the experiments depicted in Fig. 1,D and E, respectively, are 43% for 14:1 and 58% for 14:2. Taken together, these data indicate that heterogeneousN-myristoylation of Src family kinases can occur and that the profile of attached fatty acids can be regulated by the abundance of various dietary fatty acids in the growth media. We next attempted to exploit mass spectrometry to identify the fatty acids acylated to wild type Fyn. The TEV cleavage site was introduced after amino acid 16 of wild type Fyn, and a histidine tag was appended to the C terminus of protein. COS-1 cells were co-transfected with Fyn/TEV and NMT, and the Fyn construct was isolated by affinity chromatography. Cleavage of the purified protein with TEV generated a peptide with experimental mass of m/z = 2657.19, consistent with the formation of an N-myristoylated peptide. However, higher molecular weight species corresponding to palmitoylated forms of the peptide were not evident. One explanation for the failure to recover dually fatty acylated peptide could be that the high hydrophobicity of this peptide promotes sticking to the reversed phase columns that are used to purify the peptide prior to mass spectrometric analysis. A pilot experiment performed with a synthetic myristoylated, palmitoylated tetrapeptide revealed that this was indeed the case. Due to these technical limitations, we resorted to incubating cells with various radiolabeled fatty acids in order to identify potential heterogeneous S-acylation of Fyn. Previous studies (6Muszbek L. Haramura G. Cluette-Brown J.E. Van Cott E.M. Laposata M. Lipids. 1999; 34: 331-337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that radiolabeled fatty acids other than palmitate were attached to platelet proteins by thioester linkage. However, the identity of the heterogeneously acylated proteins was not determined. We therefore tested whether Src family kinases could be S-acylated by dietary fatty acids. COS-1 cells expressing Fyn were grown in media supplemented with either tritiated palmitate, oleate, or arachidonate. Cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated with anti-Fyn antibody, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. As depicted in Fig. 2, labeling of Fyn with [3H]oleate could be visualized after a 10-day exposure of the gel to film, and Fyn labeled with [3H]arachidonate was visible after a 3-month exposure. Western blotting of the immunoprecipitated Fyn proteins with anti-Fyn antibody revealed that the total amount of Fyn protein was the same in each sample. These data suggest that unsaturated fatty acids can be incorporated into Src family kinases in vivo. It is also possible that some of the labeling may represent incorporation of fatty acid metabolites (see below). The extremely long exposure times required for detection of the tritiated compounds prompted us to synthesize iodo-fatty acid analogs containing the high energy isotope125I. We described previously (21Peseckis S.M. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30888-30892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) the synthesis of 13-iodotridecanoic acid (IC13:0) and 16-iodohexadecanoic acid (IC16:0), fatty acid analogs of myristate and palmitate containing iodine at the ω carbon of the fatty acyl chain. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” we have now synthesized 18-iodooctadecenoic acid (IC18:1) and 18-iodooctadecanoic acid (IC18:0), iodo-fatty acids analogs of oleate and stearate, respectively. Each analog was radioiodinated by exchange with Na125I. COS-1 cells expressing wild type and mutant Fyn were incubated in media containing various iodo-fatty acid analogs. Cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated with anti-Fyn antibody, and analyzed by Western blotting and phosphorimaging. As depicted in Fig. 3, all of the analogs (IC13:0, IC16:0, IC18:0, and IC18:1) were incorporated into wild type Fyn. Mutation of glycine 2 to alanine prevented incorporation of all the fatty acid analogs (lanes 2, 5, 8, and 11), indicating thatN-myristoylation is required for S-acylation. Previous studies have shown that cysteines 3 and/or 6 of Fyn are the sites for S-acylation with palmitate via a thioester linkage (8Shenoy-Scaria A.M. Dietzen D.J. Kwong J. Link D.C. Lublin D.M. J.

Studies of heterozygotes for ABCA1 deficiency have also demonstrated a very strong relationship between levels of cellular cholesterol efflux and HDL-C levels in plasma, with ∼82% of the variation in HDL-C levels in these patients being accounted for by the decrease in cellular cholesterol efflux. This clearly has demonstrated in these patients that ABCA1 is the major but not the only contributor to cellular cholesterol efflux in humans (6Clee S.M. Kastelein J.J.P. van Dam M. Marcil M.

A direct mechanism of sterol-mediated up-regulation of gene expression ofABCA1 has been shown to be due to transactivation of theABCA1 promoter by LXR and RXR (10Schwartz K. Lawn R.M. Wade D.P.

This sterol-mediated activation has been shown to be dependent on the binding of RXR/LXR heterodimers to a DR4 element in the promoter of the ABCA1 gene. Transcriptional sequences representing LXR response elements (or LXREs) are composed of direct repeats of the motif AGGTCA separated by four nucleotides, and this element has been shown to be activated by both ligands of RXR (rexinoids) and LXR (oxysterols) separately and together (11Costet P.

However, thus far this has been the only LXRE described in the ABCA1gene, and there has been no in vivo validation of the sterol responsiveness of the human ABCA1 protein. Levels of mRNA may be poor predictors of protein expression (12Chawla A. Boisvert W.A. Lee C.-H. Laffitte B.A. Barak Y. Joseph S.B. Liao D. Nagy L. Edwards P.A. Curtiss L.K. Evans R.M. Tontonoz P.

Alternatively, the same level of expression of an mRNA can result in vastly different levels of a protein (13Aebersold R. Rist B. Gygi S.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Therefore, even though in vitro studies have shown an increase of ABCA1 mRNA on oxysterol stimulation (10Schwartz K. Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The use of transgenic technologies using BACs offers important advantages for generating mice expressing human ABCA1. The inclusion of endogenous regulatory elements within the transgene allows for assessment of normal temporal, tissue-, and cell-specific expression of human ABCA1. Furthermore, inclusion of selected endogenous promoter sequences allows for dissection of the contribution of different sequences to the normal regulation of theABCA1 gene. Such information is not possible using cDNA transgenic approaches that often result in poorly expressed genes that are not physiologically regulated. Here we demonstrate, both in vitro and in vivo, that the ABCA1 gene has an internal promoter containing LXREs in intron 1. Activation of this functional internal promoter in human intron 1 by oxysterols in vivo directly contributes to an increase in human-specific mRNA in tissue and leads to increased protein expression. These experiments have led to the identification of three novel ABCA1 transcripts with different transcription initiation sites that utilize sequences in intron 1. In addition, increased human ABCA1 expression results in a remarkable and significant increase in cholesterol efflux and HDL-C levels. These studies provide important proof of the principle for therapeutic strategies directed toward the activation of ABCA1expression and activity. Cells were transfected for 3 h by lipofection using ExGen 500 (Euromedex) in Opti-MEM I. Medium was then replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 0.2% fetal calf serum, and cells were incubated for 48 h. Cell extracts were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity as described (15Delrive P. Furman C. Teissier E. Fruchart J.-C. Duriez P. Staels B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Twenty four hours before transfection, HepG2, HUH7, CaCo2, COS-1, and RK13 cells were plated in 24-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 5 × 104 cells/well. Transfection mixtures contained 100 ng of tkpGl3 reporter vector or pGl3 containing an 8-kb fragment from ABCA1 intron 1 (pGl3–8kb). Transfection mixtures contained 50 ng of reporter plasmid (tkpGl3) containing multiple copies of the putative LXREs and 25 ng of LXRα and RXR expression plasmids, in the presence of the internal control β-galactosidase expression vector. After transfection, cells were treated for 48 h with 1 μm22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (Sigma). LXRα and RXR were transcribed and translated in vitro using pCDNA3-LXRα and pSG5-mRXRα as templates and the TNT-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Gel mobility shift assays (20 μl) contained 10 mm Tris (pH 8), 40 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 6% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 μg of herring sperm DNA, and 2.5 μl each of in vitrosynthesized LXRα and RXR proteins. The total amount of reticulocyte lysate was maintained constant in each reaction (5 μl) through the addition of unprogrammed lysate. After a 10-min incubation on ice, 1 ng of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 10 min. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE. Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography at −80 °C. 250 picomoles of each oligonucleotide to which half-sites for BamHI and BglII restriction enzymes had been added were phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), incubated for 5 min at 95 °C and then 10 min at 65 °C, and cooled to room temperature. Multimeric copies were then generated using T4 ligase, cloned in TKpGl3 vector, and verified by sequencing. BACs containing theABCA1 gene were identified by screening high density BAC grid filters from a human BAC library. Four BACs containingABCA1 were sequenced as described previously (1Brooks-Wilson A.

Version 1.7 of ClustalW with modifications was used for multiple sequence alignments with Boxshade for graphical enhancement. The 5′ end of BAC 269 is at position −13491 in intron 1 (i.e. 13491 nucleotides from the 5′ end of exon 2). This BAC was chosen for further purification as it alone contained intron 1 sequence without the humanABCA1 promoter, allowing us to test for functionality of the putative intronic regulatory elements. The BACs were purified for injection using the Qiagen Maxi Prep kit, followed by cesium chloride purification (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.42-1.46Google Scholar) and dialysis overnight. BACs were quantified using agarose gel electrophoresis, and sets of 300 C57BL/6xCBA eggs were injected with 30 ng of the purified BAC DNA. Founders were genotyped with DNA extracted from tail pieces, followed by subsequent PCR amplification of exon 2, exon 26, and exon 49 of the ABCA1gene. BAC mice and control littermates were provided free access to water and a high fat/high cholesterol or a control chow diet for 7 days. The diets were purchased from Harlan Teklad with the high fat/high cholesterol diet (TD 90221) containing 15.75% fat, 1.25% cholesterol, and 0.5% sodium cholate. This diet has been shown previously to result in up-regulation ofABCA1 mRNA levels in mouse liver, assessed at 7 days after feeding (17Hedrick C.C. Hassan K. Hough G.P. Yoo J. Simzar S. Quinto C.R.

The control diet contained 0.5% sodium cholate (TD 99057). RNA from mouse liver and peritoneal macrophages were isolated using Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 3 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.). Human- and mouse-specific primers were used along with 18 S primers (Ambion Inc.) to quantitate transcript abundance. Human-specific primers are as follows: Ex3F, CAAACATGTCAGCTGTTACTGGAAG, and Ex4R, GAGCCTCCCCAGGAGTCG. Mouse-specific primers are as follows: Ex5F, CATTAAGGACATGCACAAGGTCC, and Ex6R, CAGAAAATCCTGCAGCTTCAATTT. The standard cycling conditions of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min were used. PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gels, and images were captured using Bio-Rad multianalyst software using a geldoc system. Bands were quantified using NIH Image version 1.6. All values are ratios with the corresponding 18 S bands. The human ABCA1 primers, mouse ABCA1 primers, and their Taqman probes were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The TaqMan probe contains a reporter dye at the 5′ end and a quencher dye at the 3′ end. The sequences of the primers and the probes are as follows: human ABC1 forward primer, 5′-CCTGACCGGGTTGTTCCC-3′, and human ABC1 reverse primer, 5′-TTCTGCCGGATGGTGCTC-3′; human ABC1 TaqMan probe, 5′-ACATCCTGGGAAAAGACATTCGCTCTGA-3′; mouse ABC1 forward primer, 5′-TCCGAGCGAATGTCCTTC-3′, and mouse ABC1 reverse primer, 5′-GCGCTCAACTTTTACGAAGGC-3′; and mouse ABC1 Taqman probe, 5′-CCCAACTTCTGGCACGGCCTACATC-3′. The RT-PCR was carried out on ABI PRISM 7700 in a final volume of 50 μl, containing 40 ng of total RNA, 200 μm primers, and 600 μmprobe in 1× TaqMan One-step RT-PCR Master mix (PE Biosystems, CA), according to the manufacturer's instruction. The primers and probe for 18 S or rodent GAPDH were used as the internal controls for human ABC1 and mouse ABC1, respectively. The reverse transcription reaction was run at 48 °C for 30 min. After activation of the AmpliTaq Gold at 95 °C for 10 min, the PCR was carried out for 40 cycles (denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s and annealing and extension at 60 °C for 1 min). Data quantification and analysis were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (PE Biosystems). Values were calculated relative to the level of the control. Each sample was assayed in triplicate during two independent experiments. In order to identify the transcript generated in the BAC mice lacking exon 1,ABCA1 intron 1 sequence was searched by ProScan for putative transcription sites, and several likely sites were determined. Primers were synthesized, and CLONTECH marathon-ready mouse and human liver cDNAs were used to amplify putative transcripts using the predicted transcript primers and an ABCA1 exon 3 reverse primer, following the manufacturer's instructions. Positive transcripts were confirmed using nested PCR and sequenced. In addition, RNA was isolated from BAC transgenic and control littermate tissue using Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed using primers described previously (18Pullinger C.R. Hakamata H. Duchateau P.N. Eng C. Aouizerat B.E. Cho M.H. Fielding C.J. Kane J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and following the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). All products were TA-cloned (Invitrogen) and sequenced using an ABI 3100 automated DNA sequencer. Primers used for transcript amplification are as follows: exon 1bF, GTTGTCATCTTTGAACAAACTG; exon 1cF, GAGAAGGGAACTCACATTGCTTTG; exon 1dF, CACGGTAGAACTTTCTACTGTG; and Ex3R, CATTCATGTTGTTCATAGGGTG. Standard cycling conditions were used for PCR amplification of all three transcripts. BAC transgenic mice and control littermates were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation, and various tissues were isolated and placed in 500 μl of low salt lysis buffer containing complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) on ice. The tissues were homogenized and sonicated. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was aliquoted into tubes. Protein levels were quantified using the Lowry assay. 100–150 μg of protein was separated on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels and was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were probed with ABC1PEP4 polyclonal rabbit antibody (directed against residues 2236–2259 in ABCA1) 2C. L. Wellington, E. K. Y. Walker, A. Suarez, A. Kwok, N. Bissada, R. R.

The membrane was dipped in ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to X-Omat blue film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Protein levels were quantitated using NIH image software. To compare further the in vivo cellular expression pattern of ABCA1 protein in both ABCA1 BAC transgenic mice and their wild type littermates, immunocytochemistry was performed on a variety of fixed tissues using the polyclonal ABC1PEP4 antibody described above. Transgenic and wild type mice were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital, injected intraperitoneally with 100 units of heparin in sterile water, and then transcardially perfused with cold 3% paraformaldehyde in 0.1m phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The brain and liver were removed from each mouse and post-fixed for 24–48 h in the same fixative. For each organ 30–50-μm sections were cut on a vibrating microtome (Vibratome). Sections were collected in sterile PBS at 4 °C, rinsed in 0.1 m PBS with 0.3% Tween 20, and incubated in blocking solution (0.1% PBS with 0.3% Tween 20, 3% whole goat serum, and 5% bovine serum albumin) for 2 h at room temperature. Sections of liver were incubated for 48 h with ABC1PEP4. Brains from each mouse were processed for combined immunocytochemistry with a neuron-specific (NeuN, Chemicon) antibody and ABC1PEP4. Sections were sequentially placed into primary antisera against ABCA1 (diluted 1:2500 in block solution) and NeuN (dilution 1:50 in block solution) for 48 h at 4 °C. Following incubation with the primary antibody, sections were washed several times in blocking solution and incubated in secondary antibody for 48 h at 4 °C. Secondary antibodies (Molecular probes) were used as follows: goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 with NeuN at a dilution of 1:200, and goat anti-rabbit CY-3 with ABCA1 primary at a dilution of 1:200. Following further washes with 0.1 m PBS the sections were dry-mounted on gelatin-coated slides, dehydrated by serial ethanol washes, and permanently mounted with Fluoromount (Gurr). Sections were analyzed using an upright fluorescence microscope (Zeiss), and digital images were captured on a CCD camera (Princeton Instrument Inc.). Combined and NeuN/ABCA1-stained sections were processed into double immunofluorescence figures using Northern exposure image program. Mice were either bled by saphenous vein withdrawal or by cardiac puncture, and the collected blood was added to tubes containing 5 μl of 0.1m EDTA. For the measurement of HDL-C, the plasma was mixed 1:1 with 20% PEG20, vortexed, incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and spun at maximum speed for 5 min at room temperature (19Liu M.-S.

The plates were quantified in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader at 492 nm. For the measurement of total cholesterol, 5 μl of plasma was added to the same plates; 200 μl of Infinity cholesterol reagent was added, and the plate was quantified as above. Triglycerides were measured by adding 10 μl of the plasma to a 96-well plate, followed by the addition of 100 μl of solutions from a triglyceride kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). FPLC separation of plasma lipoproteins was performed using two SuperoseTM 6 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) columns in series as described previously (19Liu M.-S. LeBoeuf R.C. Henderson H.

Equal volumes of plasma (40 μl) from mice (n = 8) in each group were pooled for the analysis. The cholesterol and triglyceride content in each 0.5-ml fraction was assessed using commercially available enzymatic kits (Roche Molecular Biochemicals).

For the isolation of macrophages, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 2 ml of 3% thioglycollate and 3 days later were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation. 5 ml of DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin (all from Life Technologies, Inc.) was injected into the body cavity. The mouse was gently massaged, and the media were withdrawn and placed in tubes on ice. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of the above media and plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml in a volume of 300 μl. The cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C until used. Fibroblasts were isolated by dissecting the femurs of the mice and triturating the above media through the bone to remove all bone marrow. The media were added to tubes on ice and spun at 1200 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of media. The cells were plated on 10-cm tissue culture plates (Corning Glass) and left in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. 24 h post-plating of the macrophage cells, [3H]cholesterol (2 μCi/ml) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 50 μg/ml acylated low density lipoprotein (Intracel) were preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Media were made containing DMEM, 1% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, l-glutamine, 1 μmacyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase inhibitor (CI-976, a kind gift from Dr. Minghan Wang) and the preincubated 50 μg/ml acylated low density lipoprotein and [3H]cholesterol. The media in the 24-well plates were replaced with 300 μl of this cholesterol-containing media, and the plates were incubated for 24 h. The labeled media were then replaced with 0.2% defatted bovine serum albumin (Sigma) or 10% delipidated serum (Sigma) containing media for about 24 h. The media were again replaced with 300 μl of DMEM, penicillin/streptomycin, l-glutamine, either with or without 20 μg/ml apoAI (Calbiochem), and the treatment compounds 9-cis-retinoic acid (Sigma) and 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (Steraloids). 24 h later, the media were withdrawn and centrifuged at maximum speed for 5 min at room temperature. 100 μl of the supernatant was added to scintillation vials, and radioactivity was quantitated. 200 μl of 0.1 nNaOH was added to each well containing the cells and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. 100 μl of this lysate was added to scintillation vials and quantified.

Most important, this PrP isoform (UPrPSc) was also found in the urine of hamsters inoculated with prions long before the appearance of clinical signs.

The need for such an in vivo test was reinforced since the first cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease were reported in 1996 (3Zeidler M. Johnstone E.C. Bamber R.W. Dickens C.M. Fisher C.J.

As opposed to cattle, the incubating individuals (which at this point can be any of us), will be present for many years, donating blood, and in some cases other organs, to the non-affected population. The only identified component of the prion, the agent causing prion diseases (also referred to as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies; TSEs), is PrPSc, a protease-resistant abnormal isoform of PrPC. PrPC is a glycophosphatidyl inositol-anchored glycoprotein of unknown function (7Oesch B. Westaway D. Walchli M. McKinley M.P. Kent S.B. Aebersold R. Barry R.A. Tempst P. Teplow D.B. Hood L.E.

We now show that a protease-resistant isoform of PrP, hereby denominated UPrPSc, can be detected, following a specific enrichment procedure, in the urine of scrapie-infected hamsters, BSE-infected cattle, and humans suffering from CJD. These results pave the way for the development of a simple in vivo test for prion diseases. Urine samples (2 ml for hamster, 10 ml for human, and 15 ml for bovine) were sedimented for 5 min at 3000 rpm to discard occasional cell debris and then dialyzed overnight in a cellulose tubular membrane (pore range 6000–8000 dalton; Membrane Filtration Products, Inc., Seguin, TX) against 5 liters of saline at 4 °C (saline was changed twice during dialysis). For experimental purposes, (see Fig. 1c), the dialysis step was omitted in some cases. Subsequently, the urine samples were centrifuged at high speed (100000 gav (average gravitational force equivalent executed by the centrifugation process on the sample) for 1 h at 4 °C). Pellets were resuspended in 100 µl of 2% sarkosyl STE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). Samples were divided and digested in the presence or absence of proteinase K (PK). Digestion conditions were optimized for each species. For hamster urine, 40 µg/ml PK for 60 min at 37 °C; for human urine, 40 µg/ml PK for 30 min at 37 °C; for bovine urine, 20 µg/ml for 30 min at 37 °C. Following protease digestion, the urine samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer, applied to a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequently transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked with 3% fat milk except for the bovine samples, which were blocked with 5% human serum albumin; Sigma. A second blocking step was performed with a mixture of 1:3000 anti-mouse IgG and 1:3000 anti-rabbit IgG in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20; for 30 min) to avoid nonspecific binding of the secondary antibody to IgG light chain present in some urine samples. Membranes were then rinsed in TBST for 15 min and immunoblotted with either α PrP mAb 3F4 or 6H4 (hamster and human) at 1:5000 or 6H4 (bovine) at 1:5000. Syrian hamsters were inoculated with samples containing urine PrP from normal or scrapie-sick hamsters. For inoculation, urine samples were prepared as described above (including PK digestion but not SDS boiling) and diluted as required in 1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline. Brain samples from scrapie-infected hamsters were diluted to contain similar concentrations of PrPSc (see Fig. 3) and inoculated to additional groups of hamsters. To achieve similar concentrations of protease-resistant PrP in brain and urine inoculi, each animal was inoculated, depending on the appropriate experimental group, with 50 µl of sample containing PrP originating from either 0.5 ml of urine or from 1.25 µl of 10% scrapie hamster brain homogenate. Following inoculation, animals were examined daily for scrapie-associated symptoms. For time course experiments, groups of three hamsters in an equivalent stage of disease incubation were housed each week in a metabolic cage for urine collection from 15:00 to 08:00 of the next day. Urine was collected in the morning and immediately frozen at −80 °C. Food and water were supplied ad libitum. A similar procedure was applied to scrapie-sick hamsters. Whole brain or kidney were homogenized in 10 volumes of homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm sucrose/phosphate-buffered saline). Following centrifugation (2000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C), the supernatant was frozen (−80 °C). Whenever possible, the human samples from CJD patients and controls were the first morning urine. Some CJD and post-stroke patients were bearing catheters, and in these cases urine was collected for a period of up to 8 h in a urine collecting bag. All samples were frozen until further use. All BSE and most control bovine urine samples were obtained from the Veterinary Laboratory Agency (VLA) in London, United Kingdom. The VLA samples constituted 51 samples of 24 cows, all coded for blind testing. Additional freshly frozen control samples were obtained from the Hebrew University Veterinary School. According to VLA records, most samples were frozen following collection whereas some were kept chilled. No information was provided regarding time of day for sample collection. Most of the CJD patients tested in this work (6 of 8) were genetic patients carrying the E200K mutation (15Hsiao K. Meiner Z. Kahana E. Cass C. Kahana I. Avrahami D. Scarlato G. Abramsky O.

One of the patients was a 52-year-old individual homozygous for this mutation (19Simon E.S. Kahana E. Chapman J. Treves T.A. Gabizon R. Rosenmann H. Zilber N. Korczyn A.D. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 47: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Among the other genetic patients, four were MM at codon 129 and one was MV. The E200K mutation is located at a Methionine 129 allele (17Gabizon R. Rosenmann H. Meiner Z. Kahana I. Kahana E. Shugart Y. Ott J. Prusiner S.B. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 53: 828-835PubMed Google Scholar). The human controls (n = 15), were either healthy individuals (n = 7) or patients suffering from diverse neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (n= 3), multiple sclerosis (n = 2), and stroke (n = 3). Urine from BSE-infected cattle, as well as most of the bovine controls used in this work, were obtained from the VLA laboratory in the United Kingdom. For the bovine samples, the urine test was performed as a blind study. Urine from Syrian hamsters, inoculated with either the 263K prion strain (20Kimberlin R.H. Walker C.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1986; 67: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) or normal controls, were collected with the use of a metabolic cage (as explained under “Experimental Procedures”), as pools from three animals. Urine samples from scrapie-infected hamsters, CJD patients, and BSE-infected cattle, as well as from their appropriate controls, were processed for enrichment of UPrPSc as described under “Experimental Procedures” and subsequently immunoblotted for PrP peptides. Human and hamster urine samples were immunoblotted with either mAb 3F4 or 6H4 (not shown), whereas bovine samples were blotted only with mAb 6H4. Parallel samples were blotted only with secondary α mouse antisera and showed no interfering signals. Fig. 1 demonstrates the results of such an experiment. Although a precipitable and protease-resistant form of PrP could be detected in the dialyzed urine of prion disease-affected humans and animals, this was not the case for the urine of the appropriate controls. The PrP urine assay was negative for all controls humans (n = 15), hamsters (n = 10), when each sample represents a pool from three hamsters, and cattle (n = 15), positive for all CJD patients tested (n = 8), for a large number of hamster groups (n = 20), and for 10 of 12 BSE-infected cattle, whereas the other two BSE-positive cows showed a positive but poor signal. As can be seen in Fig. 1 c dialysis was essential for the detection of the protease-resistant UPrPSc in urine from scrapie-infected hamsters. The fact that the PrP signal in urine could be blocked by the 3F4 peptide and did not react with the secondary antibody provides strong evidence that this signal belongs to a PrP peptide (Fig. 1 d) A surprising result depicted above is that a protease-sensitive PrP isoform is present in the precipitable fraction of the normal urine samples, as opposed to what is expected for PrPC. It is to be noticed, however, that no detergent was added to the urine before ultracentrifugation as performed in membrane extractions that result in a soluble PrPC (21Meyer R.K. McKinley M.P. Bowman K.A. Braunfeld M.B. Barry R.A. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2310-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 22Gabizon R. McKinley M.P. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4017-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). It is also possible that all PrP molecules are present in urine in a partially denatured state because of the presence of urea. Also dialysis of normal urine may induce the aggregation of the PrPC isoform, which, as opposed to UPrPSc, is protease-sensitive. Although the exact chemical nature of UPrPSc is yet to be determined, its molecular weight seems to be slightly higher than full-length and fully glycosylated PrPC or PrPSc. In addition, the pattern of UPrPSc in the immunoblots suggest it may be composed mostly of the higher molecular band of PrP and not of the less glycosylated species. This may indicate that partially or non glycosylated PrP is less resistant to the conditions encountered by PrPSc until it is excreted in urine as UPrPSc. That normal PrP is excreted in urine is not entirely surprising, because this is also the case of other GPI-anchored proteins (23Nakano Y. Noda K. Endo T. Kobata A. Tomita M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 24Rindler M.J. Naik S.S. Li N. Hoops T.C. Peraldi M.N. J. Biol.

J. 1996; 316: 923-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). UPrPSc did not originate directly from the kidneys, because no PrPSc could be identified in the kidney tissue of the scrapie-infected hamsters (Fig. 1 b). This suggests UPrPSc originates from other organs and arrives to the urine from blood. The detection of PrPSc at the end stages of prion disease may result from some degree of blood brain-barrier disruption by brain degeneration (26De Armond S.J. Gonzales M. Mobley W.C. Kon A.A. Stern A. Prusiner H. Prusiner S.B. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1989; 317: 601-618PubMed Google Scholar). Contrarily, the presence of PrPSc in prion-infected urine early in the incubation time would suggest a clearance pathway for the aberrant PrP protein either from brain or from a peripheral organ, through its excretion into urine. To address this question, we inoculated Syrian hamsters either intracerebrally (i.c.) or intraperitoneally (i.p.) with hamster prions and collected urine samples, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” every week during the incubation period. Each sample was frozen immediately after collection. At the end of the experiment, similar volumes of these urine samples were thawed, enriched for PK-resistant UPrPSc as described above, and subsequently immunoblotted with α PrP mAb 3F4. The results of such an experiment can be seen in Fig.2. A light signal of prion-specific PrP was detected in the urine samples of the i.c. inoculated hamsters after only 17 days (Fig. 2 a), following by the disappearance of the PrP signal until day 35. Subsequently, the signal for protease-resistant PrP increased until the appearance of clinical signs. Similar results were obtained for the i.p. inoculated hamsters. A PrP signal was detected in the first weeks following the inoculation, disappeared at later dates, and reappeared at about 60 days. These results may infer that some of the prion inoculum is immediately secreted following inoculation. Thereafter, no PrP signal appeared in urine until the first stages of prion protein accumulation in brain. Indeed, whereas scrapie incubation time for i.c. or i.p. inoculated hamsters with the 263K strain is about 75 and 120 days, respectively, PrPSc can be identified in enriched brain samples of these hamsters at about 40 (i.c.) or 70 (i.p.) days (27Czub M. Braig H.R. Diringer H. J. Gen. Virol. 1988; 69: 1753-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 28Czub M. Braig H.R. Diringer H. J. Gen.

A. 1992; 89: 7620-7624Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Our experiments therefore suggest that UPrPSc is excreted in urine in parallel to its accumulation in brain. The results of the experiments described in both Figs. 1 and 2 indicate therefore that urine testing for protease-resistant PrP can be used not only to diagnose prion diseases in animals and humans at terminal stages of the disease but also to diagnose these diseases in the subclinical stages of infection. If indeed the PrP signal detected at the first weeks-post infection is because of clearance of the inoculum, the PrP urine test may serve to diagnose a potential new occurrence of infection. This will allow in the future, providing an effective anti-prion therapy becomes available, to treat individuals at risk of a new prion exposure. The detection of UPrPSc raises the alarming possibility that urine from prion-infected individuals, either ill or as yet incubating the disease can somehow transmit prion diseases. This prospect is especially disturbing in the case of BSE-infected cattle, as well as in natural scrapie in sheep. Because the mechanism by which these diseases are transmitted among animals within the herd was never elucidated (30Bradley R. Matthews D. Rev. Sci. Tech. 1992; 11: 605-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 31Chatelain J. Dautheville Guibal C. Eur. J. Epidemiol. 1989; 5: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that urine can contaminate the living areas of these animals. To investigate whether urine from TSE-infected animals can be infectious, we inoculated 20 hamsters with UPrPSc pooled and enriched from urine of 10 hamsters terminally ill with scrapie. 20 hamsters were inoculated with similarly prepared samples from 10 normal hamsters. Brain samples from scrapie-infected hamsters, which were diluted to contain similar concentrations of PrPSc (1.25 µl of 10% homogenate) to the enriched UPrPSc (from 0.5 ml of urine), were inoculated to additional groups of hamsters (Fig.3 a). Hamsters were observed daily for symptoms of scrapie infection. Urine was collected periodically from animals inoculated with UPrPSc. At different time points during the experiment, some of the hamsters inoculated with UPrPSc were sacrificed and tested for the presence of PrPSc in their brains. As expected, the animals inoculated with scrapie-infected brain samples suffered from fatal disease symptoms at about 80 days post-inoculation. Contrarily, none of the animals inoculated with urine samples (normal or scrapie-infected) developed clinical symptoms of prion disease to date (270 days post-infection). 12 hamsters (four groups of three), inoculated with scrapie urine samples, were tested for the presence of UPrPSc, and all were found positive from about 60 days post-inoculation (Fig. 3, b, 2). In addition, low concentrations of PrPSc could be identified in the brain of one of three hamsters sacrificed at about 120 days (Fig. 3,b, 3). All other hamsters in this experiment are still under observation to determine whether they will develop a fatal prion disease at a later date. These results suggest that UPrPSc inoculation can result in a subclinical or carrier state prion infection. The clinical and epidemiological implications of this finding are yet to be determined. Why is UPrPSc excreted into urine? Because most urine proteins originate from blood, we speculate that some PrPSc, either from brain or from a peripheral organ, is released during the disease incubation into the blood serum in a non-aggregated form, although at a low and undetectable concentrations. Because of its protease resistance, this PrPSc is not digested by blood proteases. However, and because the MW of PrP is below the cut off size for filtering through kidney cells (about 40 kDa) (32Berne R.M. Levy M.N. Berne R.M. Levy M.N. Koeppen B.M. Stanton B.A. Physiology. 4th Ed. Mosby, St. Louis, MO1998: 677-776Google Scholar), PrP may subsequently be secreted into the urine and thereby be concentrated, as other proteins, at about 120 times over its concentration in blood (32Berne R.M. Levy M.N. Berne R.M. Levy M.N. Koeppen B.M. Stanton B.A. Physiology. 4th Ed. Mosby, St. Louis, MO1998: 677-776Google Scholar). The concentration by the kidney makes it possible to detect PrPSc in urine much easier than in blood. Because dialysis of the urine seems to be a necessary step in our detection procedure, we propose that UPrPSc is present in a semi-denatured form, probably because of the relative high concentrations of urine-denaturing agents, and is subsequently renatured during the dialysis step. This denaturation/renaturation effect may also happen in the field because of absorption of the urea by the soil. UPrPSc may differ in its conformation from brain PrPSc, thereby explaining the fact that inoculation of comparable amounts of both protease-resistant PrP isoforms produced such different results. It is to be remembered however that not all protease-resistant PrP molecules carry prion infectivity. Indeed,in vitro conversion experiments of PrPC to PrPSc, in which protease resistance was achieved by a denaturation/renaturation procedure, resulted in a protease-resistant but not infectious PrP isoform (33Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 34Hill A.F. Antoniou M. Collinge J. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Contrarily, UPrPScmay resemble the new protease-resistant soluble isoform we have identified lately, which is associated with very low levels of infectivity, if any (35Shaked G.M. Fridlander G. Meiner Z. Taraboulos A. Gabizon R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17981-17986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 36Shaked G.M. Meiner Z. Avraham I.I. Taraboulos A. Gabizon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 4: 4Google Scholar). The latest possibility is consistent with the fact that UPrPSc is found in urine, because an aggregated molecule could not filter through the kidney. It can also be speculated that UPrPSc is a component of a new prion strain, less virulent than the original 263K strain, which may produce not a fatal but a subclinical or a carrier state prion disease. Recent publications indicate the presence of low levels of PrPSc in the brains of animals that did not succumb to prion disease (6Tremblay P. Meiner Z. Galou M. Heinrich C. Petromilli C. Lisse T. Cayetano J. Torchia M. Mobley W. Bujard H. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12580-12585Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 37Hill A.F. Joiner S.

In some cases, the brains of these animals transmitted a fatal prion disease to other rodents, suggesting apparently healthy carriers of prions disease can transmit disease. To summarize, we have identified a prion-specific protease-resistant PrP isoform in the urine of prion-infected animals and humans (UPrPSc) that may be used for the in vivo early diagnosis of ill, as well as seemingly healthy but prion-infected, individuals. Our findings, in addition to their practical aspects, may also open new avenues to investigate the metabolism and clearance mechanism of PrPSc during prion infection and disease.

The gene is distributed as 11 exons in a total length of about 60 kilobase pairs. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis has shown that the AhRR gene is located at mouse chromosome 13C2, at rat chromosome 1p11.2, and at human chromosome 5p15.3. The AhRR gene has a TATA-less promoter and several transcription start sites. In addition, putative regulatory DNA sequences such as xenobiotic responsive element (XRE), GC box, and NF-κB-binding sites have been identified in the 5′-upstream region of the AhRR gene. Transient transfection analyses of HeLa cells with reporter genes that contain deletions and point mutations in the AhRR promoter revealed that all three XREs mediated the inducible expression of the AhRR gene by 3-methylcholanthrene treatment, and furthermore, GC box sequences were indispensable for a high level of inducible expression and for constitutive expression. Moreover, by using gel mobility shift assays we were able to show that the AhR/Arnt heterodimer binds to the XREs with very low affinity, which is due to three varied nucleotides outside the XRE core sequence. We have also shown that Sp1 and Sp3 can bind to the GC boxes. Finally, both transient transfection analysis and gel mobility shift assay revealed that the AhRR gene is up-regulated by a p65/p50 heterodimer that binds to the NF-κB site when the cells has been exposed to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, and this inducible expression was further enhanced by cotreatment of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and 3-methylcholanthrene.

AhR is an intracellular mediator of the xenobiotic signaling pathway and resides as a complex with HSP90 (1Denis M. Cuthill S. Wikstrom A.C. Poellinger L. Gustafsson J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Xenobiotics such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and 3-metylcholanthrene (3MC) bind to the AhR with an extremely high affinity, and the receptor complex subsequently translocates to the nucleus, where it switches its partner molecule from HSP90 to the AhR nuclear translocator (Arnt) protein (7McGuire J.

Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 82-92Google Scholar). In the nucleus the formed AhR/Arnt heterodimer binds to the xenobiotic responsive element (XRE) sequences, which are enhancer DNA elements present in the 5′-flanking region of target genes. In addition to genes for a series of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, and cell cycle and growth-related factors (9Weiss C. Kolluri S.K. Kiefer F. Gottlicher M. Exp. Cell. Res. 1996; 226: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), the AhRR gene has recently been identified as a target gene for the AhR/Arnt transcription factor (10Mimura J. Ema M. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Accordingly, AhR and AhRR constitute a regulatory loop of xenobiotic signal transduction where the liganded AhR in a heterodimer with Arnt activates expression of the AhRR gene, and the expressed AhRR, in turn, inhibits the function of AhR (10Mimura J. Ema M. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). For instance, in normal human skin fibroblasts, cytochrome P4501A1 is not up-regulated by AhR ligands, which is probably due to the expression of AhRR (11Gradin K. Toftgard R. Poellinger L. Berghard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13511-13518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Besides the well known function of the induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes, functional analyses of AhR knockout mice have revealed that AhR is involved in teratogenesis such as cleft palate and hydronephrosis induced by TCDD (12Mimura J. Yamashita K. Nakamura K. Morita M. Takagi N.T. Nakao K. Ema M. Sogawa K. Yasuda M. Katsuki M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), chemical carcinogenesis caused by benzo(a)pyrene (13Shimizu Y. Nakatsuru Y. Ichinose M. Takahashi Y. Kume H. Mimura J.

Toxicol. 1982; 22: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar). It is also possible that AhR is involved in adverse biological effects of environmental endocrine disruptants. Actually, liganded AhR is reported to interfere with transcriptional activation of the cathepsin D gene which is regulated by the estrogen receptor (15Krishnan V. Porter W. Santostefano M. Wang X. Safe S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6710-6719Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Despite the extensive efforts to elucidate the functional role of AhR in these biological effects, our knowledge is still far from being complete. To understand better the AhR-mediated xenobiotic signal transduction system, it is important to characterize the AhRR gene and to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of its expression. In the present paper, we describe the entire structure of the AhRR gene, and we have also determined its chromosomal location at 13C2 for the mouse, at 1p11 for the rat, and at 5p15.3 for the human gene. Transient DNA transfection experiments using a reporter gene containing the AhRR promoter sequence revealed that at least three different regulatory sequences, XRE, GC box, and NF-κB-binding site, function as enhancers and work cooperatively to augment the expression of AhRR mRNA. Moreover, gel mobility shift assay (GMSA) demonstrated that AhR/Arnt heterodimer, Sp1, Sp3, and NF-κB work as transactivation factors on their cognate DNA sequences. A 129SV mouse genomic library (Stratagene) was screened with a full-length mouse AhRR cDNA as probe. The probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the random priming method (16Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16569) Google Scholar). Hybridization was carried out at 65 °C for 12 h in hybridization buffer (1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% sodiumN-dodecanoylsalcosinate, 1× Denhardt's solution (17Denhardt D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1966; 23: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (2492) Google Scholar), 10 µg/ml denatured sermon sperm DNA). Filters were washed with 2× SSC at 65 °C, as described previously (17Denhardt D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1966; 23: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (2492) Google Scholar), and subsequently exposed to x-ray film. Twenty eight positive clones were isolated from ∼1.2 × 106 plaques. Restriction mapping of genomic AhRR sequences in a λFIXII vector was carried out using BamHI,HindIII, and SalI. A part of the intron 3 that was missing in the cloned DNAs was amplified by the PCR method using the LA Taq kit (Takara) and a pair of primers mRRrg-1, 5′-CAT TGC ACA GTT GGC CTA GTT GGG CTG ATG-3′, and mRRrg-2, 5′-TTC CTG CAC GGG GAA CCC TCT GTA TGA GTG TTC TT-3′. Genomic DNA of 129SV mouse was prepared as described previously (18Gross-Bellard M. Oudet P. Chambon P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 36: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). The isolated DNA (15 µg) was digested with HindIII, BamHI, or a combination of the enzymes and was then subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. After alkaline treatment of the agarose gel, the separated DNA fragments were transferred to nylon membrane by capillary blotting, and the nylon membrane was hybridized with the same DNA probe that was used in the library screening under the same conditions. The filter was then washed and exposed to x-ray film. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) analysis was performed with the 5′-RACE kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) using 3MC-treated mouse heart poly(A)+RNA according to manufacturer's protocol. Heart RNA was used since AhRR mRNA was most abundantly expressed in the heart of 3MC-treated mice as described previously (10Mimura J. Ema M. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). A pair of primers monoclonal antibody-4, 5′-GAA GCT CTT TAC CCT GAG GTA-3′, and monoclonal antibody-6, 5′-AAC GCT GAG GCG CAG GAC AGA A-3′, were used for cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification. The RACE products were then subcloned into the pBluescript SK(+) vector and sequenced (ABI310, Applied Biosystems). For RT-PCR analysis, cDNAs were synthesized in a reaction solution (20 µl) containing total RNAs (1 µg) prepared from HeLa cells treated with Me2SO, 3-MC (1 µm), TPA (10 ng/ml), or both 3-MC and TPA. An aliquot (0.8 µl) of the synthesized cDNA was amplified in a total volume of 20 µl containing 0.8 mm dNTPs, 1 unit of Taqpolymerase (Takara), 0.12 µg of each pair of primers described below, and [α-32P]dCTP. The PCR procedure consisted of 30 (AhRR) or 24 cycles (GAPDH) at 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The PCR products were electrophoretically separated on 4.5% polyacrylamide gels and subjected to autoradiography. The primers used for PCR were as follows: AhRR, 5′ primer AAG TCC AAC CCC TCC AAG CGA, and 3′ primer ACC AGA GCA AAG CCA TTA AG; GAPDH, 5′ primer ACA TCG CTC AGA CAC CAT GG, and 3′ primer GTA GTT GAG GTC AAT GAA GGG. The 5′-flanking region (−3137 to +29) of mAhRR gene was inserted into the SmaI site of the luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL3 Basic Vector) (Promega). Introduction of mutations in the XRE element was carried out by using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The primers used for mutagenesis were as follows: XRE1-mg, CTT CGG GCG GGG CGG CTC GCt aGC TGG GGT GGG GCT TTC; XRE2-mg, GCA AGA AAG GAG GAA CgC GtT AAG TCT TGG TTA CCT ATT; XRE3-mg, GCC AGG TGG TGA CGG CAC Aga tCT TTA ATC CCA ACA CTC (small letters in the sequence of the primers represent the mutated nucleotides). To assess the AhRR promoter activity, HeLa cells were transfected with reporter plasmids carrying various deletions or point mutations in the AhRR promoter. The expressed luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity, which was used as an internal control. Nuclear extracts were prepared from HeLa cells according to the method described previously (19Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9145) Google Scholar) and used for GMSA. For supershift analyses, monoclonal antibodies against Sp1, Sp3, p65, and p50 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were separately preincubated with nuclear extracts at 0 °C for 1 h in a total volume of 19 µl of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and followed by incubation with 1 µl of32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe (described below) at 15 °C for 20 min. The following double-stranded oligonucleotides were used as probes: XRE1 (5′-gatc CGG CTC GCG TGC TGG GGT GG-3′); XRE2 (5′-gatc GAG GAA CAC GCT AAG TCT TG-3′); XRE3 (5′-gatc GAC GGC ACA CGC CTT TAA TC); GCbox1 (5′-gatc GTG CTG GGG TGG GGC TTT CC); GCbox1mut (5′-gatc GTG CTG GGA AGG GGC TTT CC); GCbox(κB)mut (5′-gatc GTG CTG GGG TGG GGC CAT CC); GCbox2,3 (5′-gatc CGC TTC GGG CGG GGC GGC TC); AhR GCbox (5′-gatc CCG TGA GGG GCG GGG CCG AG); and human NF-κB sequence (5′-gatc GTG GGG CAG TCC CTG GAG CC). To determine the human, mouse, and rat AhRR gene chromosomal location, a full-length mouse and human AhRR cDNA were used as probes. The sequence of human AhRR cDNA and isolated genomic sequence is not shown. 2J. Mimura and Y. Fujii-Kuriyama, unpublished data. FISH was carried out as described previously (20Inazawa J. Fukunaga R. Seto Y. Nakagawa H. Misawa S. Abe R. Nakata S. Genomics. 1991; 10: 1075-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 21Matsuda Y. Chapman V.M.

Cell Genet. 1992; 61: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The AhRR cDNA was labeled with biotin-16-dUTP using nick translation and hybridized to denatured metaphase chromosomes at a final concentration of 25 ng/ml in 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 2× SSC, 0.2 mg/ml Cot-1 DNA (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 2 mg/ml Escherichia coli tRNA. Hybridized signals were detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-avidin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and slides were examined through a Nikon epifluorescence microscope equipped with a CCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ). Images were captured with Quips (Vysis) software and processed with Adobe Photoshop 3.0 software. To isolate genomic clones of the AhRR gene, we screened a mouse genomic library, using full-length AhRR cDNA as a hybridization probe. Twenty eight positive clones were isolated from ∼1.2 × 106 plaques. Restriction mapping and sequencing analyses revealed that the isolated 28 clones were mainly classified into two groups that contained 5′-half and 3′-half of the AhRR gene, respectively. Representative clones (RRG15, RRG10, RRG30, and RRG26) that covered almost the entire sequence of the AhRR gene are presented in Fig. 1. To fill in the gap between the two groups of genomic clones, the PCR method was used to amplify a unique 9-kb fragment in intron 3. The PCR product was subcloned into the pBluescript SK(+) vector and, subsequently, subjected to sequence analysis. It was clearly demonstrated that sequences from 5′ and 3′ ends of the 9-kb fragment overlapped with the 3′ end of the RRG10 insert and the 5′ end of the RRG30 insert (data not shown), respectively, which confirmed that the amplified 9-kb fragment filled the gap between RRG10 and RRG30. The precise locations of exon-intron boundaries were determined by sequencing subcloned DNA fragments. Our data conclude that the AhRR gene is 60 kb long and consists of 11 exons split by 10 introns (Fig.1). To confirm the structure of the mouse AhRR gene in chromosomal DNA, genomic DNA was digested with two different restriction enzymes and fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis, followed by Southern blot analysis using full-length mouse AhRR cDNA as a probe. Except for the 9.6-kb band that was detected in all three digestions and probably is due to undigested DNA, only DNA fragments that were expected from the restriction map of the determined AhRR gene sequence were observed (Fig. 2). For instance, in theHindIII digestion (lane 2), six bands were observed, and we assume that the 3.5-kb band consists of four overlapping fragments and the 1.6-kb band of two fragments. Inlanes 1 and 3, the hybridization signal bands could be roughly explained by the restriction map. These results suggest that the mouse genome contains a unique gene for AhRR, which is consistent with the result of the chromosome localization (described below), and that the cloned gene reflects the intact structure for the chromosomal AhRR gene. By using the entire mouse cDNA as a probe, fluorescence in situhybridization was carried out on metaphase chromosomes from mouse, rat, and human cells. Clear fluorescent signals were observed on mouse chromosome 13C2 and rat chromosome 1p11.2 (Fig.3a), where conserved linkage homology has been identified between the two species (23Serikawa T. Cui Z. Yokoi N. Kuramoto T. Kondo Y. Kitada K. Guenet J.L. Exp. Anim. 1998; 47: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 24Lyon M.F. Kirby M.C. Mouse Genome 94.

A single localization of the fluorescent signal confirmed the result using genomic Southern blot analysis of the mouse AhRR gene. In addition, the human AhRR gene was mapped to chromosome 5p15.3 by fluorescencein situ hybridization on the metaphase chromosomes (Fig.3 b) and by DNA blot hybridization using an isolated human AhRR genomic clone. 3J. Mimura, T. Baba, and Y. Fujii-Kuriyama, unpublished data. The human chromosomal region carrying the AhRR gene is known to be syntenic to mouse chromosome containing 13C2. The sequence of the promoter region of the mouse AhRR gene was determined and is shown in Fig. 4a. By using a pair of primers as described under “Experimental Procedures,” the 5′-RACE method assigned transcription start sites to the AhRR mRNA at three positions (Fig. 4 a). Of the five clones isolated, one was uppermost, three were intermediate, and one lowermost as shown. Examination of the sequence around these transcription start sites revealed that the AhRR gene lacks a TATA box sequence, which has been reported for other bHLH-PAS factor genes. Instead, multiple GC box sequences are present and that is often the case with TATA-less genes. We numbered the position of the nucleotides by defining the position of most upstream transcription start site as +1. Survey of the promoter sequence revealed that there exist multiple potential enhancer DNA elements as follows: three XRE sequences at the −45, −388, and −1296 position, three GC box sequences at −36, −53, and −58, and an NF-κB site at −28. Interestingly, these DNA elements were found to be conserved in the promoter of the human AhRR gene derived from the NCBI public data base, although the NF-κB sequence matched in 8 of 10 bases between the mouse and the human sequence. In particular, the sequence from −33 to −58 nucleotide in mouse promoter shows 25 matched nucleotides out of 26 compared with the human sequence (Fig.4 b). With these results, we subjected the DNA elements to functional analysis using the transient DNA transfection system. To assess the promoter activity of the AhRR gene, we constructed a reporter gene (RR-3137Luc) by fusing the 5′-flanking 3.2-kb sequence of the AhRR gene with the 5′ end of the luciferase structural gene. This reporter gene was transiently transfected into HeLa cells, and the transfected gene displayed an enhanced expression of luciferase activity by ∼7-fold compared with the control plasmid that was lacking the promoter sequence (Fig. 5a, 1st and2nd lanes), and the expression was further enhanced by 4-fold after addition of the AhR ligand, 3MC. Moreover, the inducibility (ratio of the luciferase activities with and without the inducer) was further increased about 12-fold by cotransfection of AhR and Arnt expression plasmids (Fig. 5 b, 2nd lane). From these results we postulate that the promoter sequence of the AhRR gene contains most, if not all, of the necessary DNA elements for regulatory expression of the gene. To determine the transcriptional activity of the putative enhancer sequences, point mutations were introduced into each of the XRE sequences, and the mutated reporter gene constructs were transfected into HeLa cells (Fig. 5 a). A mutation in each of the XRE sequences caused a similar reduction in the enhanced expression of luciferase activity; moreover, the promoter that contained mutations in all three XRE sequences markedly reduced the luciferase expression, although it displayed some remaining inducibility. It remained to be seen whether some remaining inducibility of all three XRE mutant promoters is significant or not, because a control reporter pGL3 also displayed some inducibility for unknown reasons. To confirm the result from the mutation experiments, deletion mutants of the AhRR promoter were constructed (Fig. 5 b). The deletion constructs were transfected into HeLa cells together with expression plasmids for AhR and Arnt, and luciferase activity was measured. The expressed activities were gradually decreased, depending on loss of the enhancer elements (Fig. 5 b), which confirms that all three XRE sequences function as inducible enhancers. As shown in Fig. 4, an NF-κB-binding sequence is present near the transcription start sites. We were interested to examine whether this sequence functions as an inducible enhancer, and to do that, we treated transfected HeLa cells with TPA. The expression of the reporter gene activity was enhanced slightly, but significantly, about 2-fold over the control level when TPA was added to the medium (Fig.6a). In a parallel experiment, 3MC treatment increased the luciferase expression by 3–4-fold. Interestingly, simultaneous addition of 3MC and TPA enhanced markedly the expression of the reporter gene, indicating that the NF-κB site and the XRE worked more than additively as inducible enhancers. These results were confirmed by a mutation experiment, showing that when the NF-κB sequence was mutated, the luciferase expression was not induced by TPA treatment (Fig. 6 a). To confirm that the expression of endogenous AhRR mRNA is also induced by 3MC treatment, we performed RT-PCR analysis using RNAs extracted from treated cells (Fig. 6 b). Consistent with both the results from the reporter gene analysis and the previous report (10Mimura J. Ema M. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), 3MC treatment induced a significant increase of AhRR mRNA compared with Me2SO treatment, and cotreatment of 3MC and TPA further enhanced the AhRR mRNA level in HeLa cells. These results suggested that the NF-κB site and the XRE site worked together for the inducible expression of the AhRR gene. We next wanted to investigate the role of the involvement of the GC box sequences in regulation of the AhRR gene. We found that in absence of inducer the expression of the RR-3137Luc reporter gene was increased ∼9-fold compared with the pGL3 control (Fig.7a, lanes 1 and 2). This constitutive expression of the reporter gene activity was considered to be contributed by the GC box sequences. To investigate this, we introduced point mutations into the GC boxes of RR-3137Luc either singly or in combination. When the mutant reporter genes, GCbox1 mut Luc and GCbox3 mut Luc containing base replacement on the GC box 1 and GC box 3, respectively, were transfected into HeLa cells, a marked decrease in the constitutive luciferase expression was observed (Fig. 7 a). The reduction of the constitutive promoter activity due to point mutations in the GC box sequences also resulted in a lowered level of inducible expression by 3MC, although the induction ratio was not affected much (Fig. 7 b). These results indicate that the XRE and the GC box sequences work cooperatively as enhancer elements and that the constitutive expression of the AhRR gene is mainly regulated by the GC box 1 and the GC box 3 sequences. To investigate the proteins that bind to the regulatory DNA elements, GMSA was performed. As shown in Fig.8a, all the XRE sequences, XRE1, XRE2, and XRE3 in the AhRR gene and the XRE in theCYP1A1 gene, gave rise to shifted bands with nuclear extracts from 3MC-treated HeLa cells (indicated by asterisksin Fig. 8 a, lanes 5–8), and these shifted bands disappeared by competition experiments using their respective cold oligonucleotides (Fig. 8 a, lanes 9–12). The shifted bands with XRE probes from the AhRR gene were rather weak (shown by asterisks) compared with the XRE from the CYP1A1 gene. Since nuclear extracts from non-treated cells did not show any shifted bands with any of the XRE sequences (Fig. 8 a, lanes 17–19), the shifted bands observed are considered to be specific for 3MC treatment. The binding of the XRE sequences of the AhRR gene with AhR/Arnt heterodimer was also confirmed in the GMSA using bacterially expressed AhR and Arnt (data not shown). GMSA using an anti-AhR antibody indicated that the shifted bands in HeLa cell nuclear extracts contained the AhR (Fig.8 a, lanes 13–16); in addition, the shifted band was also affected by an anti-Arnt antibody (data not shown). Taken together these results suggested that the AhR/Arnt heterodimer binds to the XRE sequences of the AhRR gene with a lower affinity compared with the XRE sequence in the CYP1A1 gene. From the results of the competition experiments using AhRR XRE1 and CYP1A1 XRE as competitors (Fig. 8 a, lanes 22–27), the binding affinity of AhR/Arnt to AhRR XRE1 was estimated to be one-tenth or less than the binding of the heterodimer to the CYP1A1 XRE (compare lanes 21 and27). Since all the core sequences of these XREs matched the consensus of XRE, the nucleotide sequences outside the consensus may affect the binding affinity of the AhR/Arnt heterodimer, and this inference was found to be true. Replacement of three nucleotides immediately upstream of the AhRR XRE core sequence, according to the sequence of the CYP1A1 enhancer, remarkably augmented the binding activity to the AhR/Arnt heterodimer (Fig. 8 b, lane 7). Interestingly, we found that three Ts outside the consensus are important for binding of the AhR/Arnt heterodimer to the XRE. As shown in Fig. 4, the GC box 1 sequence from the AhRR gene contains an NF-κB sequence that overlaps in part with the GC box. GMSA experiments using HeLa cell nuclear extracts and the GC box 1 sequence as a probe gave rise to four major bands. The band with the highest mobility is considered to be nonspecific (indicated by anarrowhead), because nucleotide replacements in the specific enhancer element did not affect the binding (Fig.9a). The band with the 2nd lowest mobility was assigned to be a complex containing NF-κB, p65, and p50, since this band disappeared by treatment with an anti-p65 and an anti-p50 antibodies (Fig. 9 a, lanes 6 and 7). Furthermore, a mutation in the NF-κB element specifically lost the binding activity as shown in the competition experiment (Fig. 9 b, lane 7). The band with the lowest mobility was assigned to be a complex with Sp1, whereas Sp3 was included in the band that has the 2nd highest mobility (Fig. 9 a, lanes 4 and 5), judging from analyses with anti-Sp1 and anti-Sp3 antibodies, respectively. From the immunological reactivity of the shifted bands, binding of Sp1, Sp3, and NF-κB to the GC box 1 sequence appeared to be reciprocal, probably because the two DNA elements are too closely arranged for simultaneous binding of the two factors. As shown in Fig.9 a, the GC box 2,3 sequence was also recognized by Sp1 and Sp3 with an apparently lower affinity than the GC box 1, which was estimated from the intensity of the bands. Both anti-Sp1 and anti-Sp3 antibodies erased their respective bands, indicating that the close arrangement of the GC box 2 and 3 sequence only allowed either of them to be bound by Sp1 or Sp3. The NF-κB-binding site in the human AhRR gene differs in 2 of 10 bases compared with the mouse gene. To investigate whether NF-κB could bind to the human sequence, GMSA was performed with HeLa cell nuclear extracts that had been treated with TPA. As shown in Fig.9 c, the human sequence gave rise to a shifted band at the same position as with the mouse sequence, albeit in a lower intensity (Fig. 9 c, lane 4). Moreover, this band was supershifted by treatment with anti-p65 or anti-p50 antibody. Chromosome mapping and sequence analyses have shown that the AhRR gene is split into 11 exons in a total length of about 60 kb and that it is located on the mouse chromosome 13C2 (Figs. 1 and 3). It is also revealed that the rat AhRR gene is localized on chromosome 1p11.2 using mouse cDNA, confirming the recent results of the syntenic region between the two species (23Serikawa T. Cui Z. Yokoi N. Kuramoto T. Kondo Y. Kitada K. Guenet J.L. Exp. Anim. 1998; 47: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The human AhRR gene is mapped to chromosome 5p15.3 which is known to be syntenic to the mouse chromosome 13C2 (23Serikawa T. Cui Z. Yokoi N. Kuramoto T. Kondo Y. Kitada K. Guenet J.L. Exp. Anim. 1998; 47: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The structure of the AhRR gene is similar to other bHLH-PAS superfamily members such as AhR, HIF-1α, and Sim but different from Arnt and Arnt2. The exon-intron junctions of the AhRR gene are almost consistent with that of the AhR gene. These results suggest that the AhRR was first branched with the AhR from the Arnt groups and then diverged from the AhR gene during the evolutionary process. No TATA box could be found in the upstream region of the AhRR gene, but instead, multiple GC box sequences were detected, which is the case of other bHLH-PAS transcription factor genes. In addition, several other regulatory elements were identified as shown in Fig. 4 a. These regulatory DNA elements were mostly conserved in the promoter region of the human AhRR gene (Fig. 4 b), suggesting their functional importance. Transient DNA transfection experiments using the AhRR reporter gene demonstrated a role for these regulatory elements, and we postulate that the constitutive activity of the AhRR gene is dependent on these three GC boxes. As shown in Fig. 7 b, the reporter gene containing point mutations in all three GC box sequences was markedly reduced in the constitutive expression. The constitutive promoter activity of the three GC boxes was about 10-fold higher than the pGL3 control but appeared to be much weaker compared with GC boxes of other genes (data not shown). This phenomenon could be due to divergent GC box sequences of the AhRR gene. Moreover, this observation is in agreement with the fact that the AhRR mRNA level is very low under normal cell conditions. In the feedback regulatory loop of the AhR/AhRR systems, all three XRE sequences in the 5′-flanking region of the AhRR gene were revealed to work as inducible enhancer shown by the deletion and point mutation experiments (Fig. 5). Although these XRE core sequences are in complete agreement with the XRE consensus sequence established by binding selection method (26Swanson H.I. Chan W, K. Bradfield C, A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26292-26302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), their affinity to nuclear extracts from HeLa cells treated with 3MC or to bacterially synthesized AhR/Arnt heterodimer was much weaker compared with the CYP1A1 XRE sequence (Fig.8 a). The base replacements outside the XRE consensus sequence demonstrate that not only the XRE core sequence but also three Ts outside the consensus are necessary for efficient binding of the AhR/Arnt heterodimer (Fig. 8 b). For high level inducible expression of the AhRR gene, the GC box sequences are also important, because point mutations in the GC box sequences markedly reduced the level of the induced expression, whereas the inducibility of the gene (ratio of the level of the induced expression to the non-induced) appeared to be only moderately affected (Fig. 7 b). These results indicate that enhancer effects of the XRE and the GC box sequences are more than additive in the AhRR gene. The cooperative interaction between Sp1 and AhR/Arnt heterodimer has been reported in the inducible expression of the CYP1A1 gene, which contains both XRE and GC box sequences in the promoter region (27Kobayashi A. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12310-12316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This cooperative enhancer effect is shown to be mediated by the physical interaction between the PAS domain of AhR/Arnt and the zinc finger domain of Sp1 (27Kobayashi A. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12310-12316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the promoter region of the AhRR gene also contains another enhancer sequence, the NF-κB site that works as inducible enhancer in response to TPA. TPA treatment of cells shows a modest increase of luciferase activity; however, when the cells were treated simultaneously with 3MC and TPA, the expression of the reporter gene was further enhanced (Fig. 6), suggesting a physical interaction between the transcription factors that bind to the XRE and the NF-κB site. A recent paper (28Yang X. Chen Y. Gabuzda D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27981-27988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) has reported that AhR and RelA are capable of physical interaction, resulting in mutual suppression of transactivation of reporter genes driven by NF-κB and XRE sequences, respectively. The enhanced expression of the pNFκB-Luc reporter plasmid by a RelA expression vector was inhibited by activated AhR in the presence of the AhR ligand, β-naphthoflavone, whereas activated expression of an XRE reporter by AhR was inhibited by overexpression of RelA. The transactivation activities of AhR and NF-κB factors were mutually inhibited, probably due to sequestering through their interaction. In the case of the AhRR gene that contains both XRE and NF-κB sequences in the promoter, the simultaneous treatment with 3MC and TPA further enhanced expression of a reporter gene driven by the AhRR promoter, which indicates that the NF-κB and the AhR/Arnt heterodimer interact with each other to enhance the gene expression. It is reported that many transcription factors, such as c-Jun, C/EBP, and Sp1 interact with NF-κB, which results in cooperative DNA binding and activation of gene expression, when their respective enhancer elements are correctly juxtaposed to the NF-κB site (29Tian Y.

In agreement, cooperative enhancement of the endogenous AhRR mRNA expression was actually observed in HeLa cells treated with 3MC and TPA (Fig.6 b). Finally, several cytokines such as interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor, and interferon-γ are reported to inhibit induced expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes (33Barker C.W. Fagan J.B. Pasco D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8050-8055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Calleja C. Eeckhoutte C. Larrieu G. Dupuy J. Pineau T. Galtier P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Nature. 1998; 395: 225-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the inhibitions of cytochrome P450 induction could be explained through the enhanced synthesis of AhRR by NF-κB.

Recent elucidation of the sAC sequence indicates that this enzyme is phylogenetically distinct from the membrane-bound AC, does not interact with G proteins, and its activity is regulated by bicarbonate ions. Here we have investigated the properties and regulation of this enzyme during spermatogenesis. Two different transcripts encoding a full-length and truncated sAC were identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and RNase protection analysis. The truncated sAC transcript lacks exon 11 with a premature termination of the open reading frame after the catalytic domain. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction with testis RNA from adult mouse and rat of different ages, as well as RNase protection, showed that both transcripts are absent at 11 days of age, appear between 20 and 30 days of age, and are retained in the adult testis. The presence of corresponding proteins in testis, germ cells, and spermatozoa was demonstrated by fast protein liquid chromatography and differential immunoprecipitation with full-length sAC-specific antibodies. Bicarbonate ions activated both sAC forms and increased cAMP levels in germ cells isolated from 25- and 50-day-old rats and adult rats in a concentration-dependent manner. These findings provide evidence that full-length and truncated sAC are generated by alternate splicing. Both forms are active in spermatids, and the bicarbonate present in the seminiferous tubule may be a signal that regulates cAMP levels in these cells.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). This also holds true for the male gonad, where cAMP signaling is essential for the hormonal regulation of somatic cell differentiation and function. Similarly, acquisition of motility, capacitation, and acrosome reaction, processes that render mature spermatozoa competent to fertilize an egg, are dependent on cAMP signaling (3Garbers D.L. Tubb D.J. Kopf G.S. Biol. Reprod. 1980; 22: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 4Visconti P.E. Stewart-Savage J. Blasco A. Battaglia L. Miranda P. Kopf G.S. Tezon J.G. Biol.

Conversely, little is known about the role of the cAMP pathway during the differentiation of germ cells. That cAMP signaling may be important for the spermatogenic cell is suggested by the genetic ablation of the CREB1-related protein CREM that is expressed at a high level in differentiating spermatids (7Delmas V. van der Hoorn F. Mellstrom B. Jegou B. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1502-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in CREM are sterile, and spermatogenesis is arrested at the beginning of spermatid differentiation (8Nantel F. Monaco L. Foulkes N.S. Masquilier D. LeMeur M. Henriksen K. Dierich A.

Nature. 1996; 380: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). From this phenotype and the observation that several spermatid-specific genes activated during differentiation contain functional cAMP-response elements in their promoters (10Kistler M.K. Sassone-Corsi P. Kistler W.S. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 1322-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 11Zhou Y. Sun Z. Means A.R. Sassone-Corsi P. Bernstein K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12262-12266Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that CREM functions as a master switch to activate the genetic program directing spermatid differentiation (12Sassone-Corsi P. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Because CREM is phosphorylated and activated by the cAMP-regulated protein kinase A in a manner similar to the cAMP-response element-binding protein (7Delmas V. van der Hoorn F. Mellstrom B. Jegou B. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1502-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 13de Groot R.P. den Hertog J. Vandenheede J.R. Goris J. Sassone-Corsi P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3903-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), it has been inferred that cAMP signaling is crucial for spermatogenesis.In male germ cells and mature spermatozoa, cAMP production is catalyzed by at least two cyclases. Spermatids express ACIII, a membrane-bound, G protein-regulated adenylyl cyclase, which is also expressed at high levels in the olfactory system and in brain (14Gautier-Courteille C. Salanova M.

In addition, it has long been known that a nonconventional, G protein- and forskolin-insensitive, adenylyl cyclase is present in maturing germ cells and spermatozoa (16Braun T. Dods R.F. Proc. Natl.

Sinclair M.L. Schapal L. Cann M.J. Levin L.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). This adenylyl cyclase is an enzyme with no clearly identifiable transmembrane domain and is structurally related to cyclases found in prokaryotes (20Buck J. Sinclair M.L. Schapal L. Cann M.J.

However, the cloning of the sAC gene revealed an open reading frame that codes for a 187-kDa protein (20Buck J. Sinclair M.L. Schapal L. Cann M.J. Levin L.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). To reconcile these discrepancies, it has been proposed that the 187-kDa protein is an inactive precursor that is proteolytically cleaved to generate the active 48-kDa form (20Buck J. Sinclair M.L. Schapal L. Cann M.J. Levin L.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In support of this view, expression of a truncated sAC cDNA construct containing only the C1C2 catalytic domain yields a highly active protein of ∼48 kDa (20Buck J. Sinclair M.L. Schapal L. Cann M.J. Levin L.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar).In the present study, we have reinvestigated this issue and provide evidence for an additional mechanism for the generation of the short sAC form. By using independent approaches, we demonstrate that two alternate spliced transcripts are expressed in rodent germ cells, and both the full-length and truncated sACs contribute to the germ cell adenylyl cyclase activity. Given the high concentration of bicarbonate in the seminiferous tubule fluid environment in which germ cells differentiate, we propose that sAC is active early on during germ cell differentiation and its bicarbonate regulation may provide a means by which germ cell function is regulated by the surrounding environment.DISCUSSIONOur study provides evidence that two distinct transcripts encoding full-length and truncated sAC, as well as the corresponding proteins, are present in mouse and rat germ cells. When expressed in a heterologous system, these proteins have distinct properties. In addition, we demonstrate that the full-length sAC is active and contributes to the control of cAMP levels in developing germ cells and in mature spermatozoa. Given the high concentration of bicarbonate ions in the seminiferous tubule fluid, we propose that this cation controls intracellular cAMP concentration not only in mature spermatozoa but also in differentiating spermatids.The characterization of the properties of the soluble testis adenylyl cyclase indicated that this activity resides in a polypeptide of 46–70 kDa in rat testis (21Gordeladze J.O. Hansson V. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1981; 23: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 26Braun T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), 46 kDa in ram sperm (37Stengel D. Guenet L. Hanoune J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10818-10826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 48–50 kDa in human testis (22Gordeladze J.O. Andersen D. Hansson V. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1981; 53: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 38Gordeladze J.O. Abyholm T. Cusan L. Clausen O.P. Hansson V. Arch. Androl. 1982; 8: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). With the cloning of the sAC cDNA and the realization that the protein coded by this cDNA is much larger (187 kDa), it has been proposed that posttranslational proteolytic processing generates the lower molecular weight form (20Buck J. Sinclair M.L. Schapal L. Cann M.J. Levin L.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 39Kaupp U.B. Weyand I. Science. 2000; 289: 559-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Indeed, Stengel et al. (37Stengel D. Guenet L. Hanoune J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10818-10826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that chymotrypsin treatment of ram spermatozoa membrane yields a soluble cyclase with a molecular mass of 46 kDa, even though some additional physicochemical properties of this proteolytic product were not identical to those of the testis-derived form. Additional attempts to generate a proteolytically cleaved soluble cyclase that is activated by bicarbonate have generated conflicting results (40Okamura N. Onoe S. Kawakura K. Tajima Y. Sugita Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).Our data provide evidence that an additional mechanism may generate the low molecular weight sAC. Because a cDNA clone coding for sAC with an exon deletion had been isolated during the screening of a rat testis cDNA library (20Buck J. Sinclair M.L. Schapal L. Cann M.J. Levin L.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), by using an independent approach with rat and mouse testis RNA, we have demonstrated that this deletion is retrieved in a significant number of clones (3 out of 5 sequenced clones). The high frequency with which these clones were retrieved suggests that it is not a fortuitous splicing event or a cloning artifact. PCR and RNase protection analyses of RNA from testes of mouse and rat at different stages of development confirmed that transcripts containing the deletion account for ∼10–25% of the total sAC mRNA. Assuming that these transcripts are translated at comparable rates, it can be predicted that 75–90% of the sAC protein is full length whereas 10–25% is the truncated variant. Given the finding that T-sAC is ∼10 times more active than FL-sAC, one would predict that 70% of the adenylyl cyclase activity in the testis cytosol is due to T-sAC, whereas 30% is attributable to FL-sAC. This estimate on the relative abundance of the two forms is consistent with the data on both the immunoprecipitated sAC activity from germ cells and the gel filtration-eluted fractions of testis. By using an antibody that recognizes only the full-length form, we show that FL-sAC is not expressed in the immature testis devoid of meiotic germ cells, and its expression is detected when spermatogenesis progresses to the round spermatid stage. Thus, our data provide evidence for an alternative mechanism for the genesis of full-length and truncated sAC. Without excluding the possibility that proteolysis also generates the short form as suggested by others (20Buck J. Sinclair M.L. Schapal L. Cann M.J. Levin L.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), we propose that this splicing event accounts for the presence of the two sAC proteins.Several lines of evidence demonstrate that the FL-sAC is active in germ cells. Significant cyclase activity was recovered after expression of the full-length clone or after immunoprecipitation with an antibody that recognizes only FL-sAC. Both endogenous immunoprecipitated FL-sAC and recombinant FL-rsAC are stimulated by bicarbonate, confirming the identity of FL-sAC. More importantly, gel filtration chromatography of testis-soluble extracts provides evidence for the presence of an active sAC form (FL-sAC) with a molecular mass higher than 150 kDa. It should be noted that this finding of the presence of two distinct active peaks is consistent with several reports published earlier (21Gordeladze J.O. Hansson V. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1981; 23: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 26Braun T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 37Stengel D. Guenet L. Hanoune J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10818-10826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, cAMP levels measured in intact cells were significantly increased when the FL-sAC was transfected in HEK293 cells.The recombinant T-sAC eluted as a single symmetrical peak with an approximate mass of 49 kDa with little activity recovered in the void volume. This finding, together with the distinct immunological properties of the two peaks, rules out the possibility that the peak in the void volume is generated by aggregation of T-sAC. The gel filtration data suggest that, unlike T-sAC that behaves as a monomer, the FL-sAC exists as an oligomer of either two identical subunits (187 kDa) or as a complex with an unknown protein. This finding again points to the differences in properties between the FL-sAC and the T-sAC. It should be noted that we cannot formally exclude the possibility that FL-sAC and T-sAC exist as heterodimers and that immunoprecipitation with an antibody that recognizes only the FL-sAC also precipitates the more active T-sAC, nor that the full-length sAC is rapidly proteolyzed and activated during the AC assay incubation. Although the presence of a heterodimer FL-sAC/T-sAC is inconsistent with the gel filtration data, this possibility warrants further study.Because our data provide evidence that both sAC molecules are active in germ cells, the possibility needs to be entertained that FL-sAC has functions other than serving as an inactive precursor for T-sAC generation. In addition to bicarbonate, which apparently interacts directly with the catalytic domain, we propose that FL-sAC may be regulated by other signals. Thus, it is possible that the large carboxyl-terminal end of FL-sAC contains inhibitory domains for catalysis and domains involved in the reception of regulatory signals. These signals activate the full-length but not the truncated protein by promoting a change in conformation of the enzyme. The large increase in activity following deletion of the carboxyl terminus including the putative P site is consistent with this view.When epididymal spermatozoa were used as a source of sAC, about 30% of the soluble activity could be immunoprecipitated, indicating that the full-length sAC is retained during the terminal differentiation of spermatids and recovered in spermatozoa, a finding consistent with the Western blot analysis reported by others (25Chen Y. Cann M.J. Litvin T.N. Iourgenko V. Sinclair M.L. Levin L.R. Buck J. Science. 2000; 289: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). This observation reinforces the conclusion that both full-length and truncated sAC play a crucial role in the activation and capacitation of ejaculated spermatozoa.All the data thus far generated demonstrate that sAC gene expression is switched on during meiosis and that two active sAC proteins are present at least in round spermatids and possibly pachytene spermatocytes. This finding strongly suggests that sAC functions are not limited to the control of cAMP levels in mature spermatozoa but that sAC is active in generating cAMP earlier during germ cell differentiation. This conclusion is further supported by the data showing that bicarbonate anion stimulates cAMP levels in germ cells derived from 25- and 50-day-old rat testis, at a stage of development when no or few mature spermatozoa are present.It has long been recognized that seminiferous tubule fluid has a composition distinct from that of the interstitial fluid, potassium being present at considerably higher levels than in plasma. In the seminiferous tubule fluid, bicarbonate reaches concentrations between 20 and 40 mm (34Wales R.G. Wallace J.C. White I.G. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1966; 12: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 35Tuck R.R. Setchell B.P. Waites G.M. Young J.A.

Androl. 2000; 23: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), which is 5 times higher than that in the interstitial fluid. These concentrations are sufficient to activate sAC in a cell-free system or in intact germ cells as shown for cAMP accumulation. In addition, carbonic anhydrase has been detected as mRNA, protein, or activity in the testis, epididymis, and in spermatozoa (43Rodriguez-Martinez H. Hurst M. Ekstedt E. Acta Anat. 1990; 139: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 44Parkkila S. Kaunisto K. Kellokumpu S. Rajaniemi H.

Human and rat germ cells express unique carbonic anhydrase transcripts (45Mezquita P. Mezquita C. Mezquita J. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1999; 5: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and high levels of carbonic anhydrase activity have been localized in Sertoli cells of several species (43Rodriguez-Martinez H. Hurst M. Ekstedt E. Acta Anat. 1990; 139: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar,47Ekstedt E. Ridderstrale Y. Ploen L. Rodriguez-Martinez H. Acta Anat. 1991; 141: 257-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, all these findings, and our observation that sodium bicarbonate stimulates cAMP accumulation in isolated immature germ cells, strongly suggest that bicarbonate controls cAMP accumulation during spermatid differentiation. Although it is not known whether bicarbonate concentration fluctuates during the seminiferous tubule cycle, we propose that bicarbonate released in the seminiferous tubule fluid is part of an autocrine or paracrine loop to maintain intracellular cAMP concentrations permissive for spermatid differentiation.In summary, the data described above provide evidence that the two active sAC proteins are generated through a splicing mechanism and are suggestive of FL-sAC functions distinct from those of the truncated sAC. In addition, we provide evidence that bicarbonate is a signal that regulates cAMP levels in developing spermatids. It remains to be determined whether this regulation has an impact on survival and differentiation of these cells as well as on the CREM-dependent program of gene transcription. Cyclic AMP, the product of adenylyl cyclase, is an important second messenger controlling signaling in a wide variety of cells in almost all prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (1Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 2Taussig R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). This also holds true for the male gonad, where cAMP signaling is essential for the hormonal regulation of somatic cell differentiation and function. Similarly, acquisition of motility, capacitation, and acrosome reaction, processes that render mature spermatozoa competent to fertilize an egg, are dependent on cAMP signaling (3Garbers D.L. Tubb D.J. Kopf G.S. Biol. Reprod. 1980; 22: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 4Visconti P.E. Stewart-Savage J. Blasco A. Battaglia L. Miranda P. Kopf G.S. Tezon J.G. Biol.

Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 189-317Google Scholar, 6Jaiswal B.S. Eisenbach M. Hardy D.M. Garbers D.L. Fertilization. Academic Press, San Diego2001Google Scholar). Conversely, little is known about the role of the cAMP pathway during the differentiation of germ cells. That cAMP signaling may be important for the spermatogenic cell is suggested by the genetic ablation of the CREB1-related protein CREM that is expressed at a high level in differentiating spermatids (7Delmas V. van der Hoorn F. Mellstrom B. Jegou B. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1502-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in CREM are sterile, and spermatogenesis is arrested at the beginning of spermatid differentiation (8Nantel F. Monaco L. Foulkes N.S. Masquilier D. LeMeur M. Henriksen K. Dierich A. Parvinen M. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1996; 380: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 9Blendy J.A. Kaestner K.H. Weinbauer G.F. Nieschlag E. Schutz G. Nature. 1996; 380: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). From this phenotype and the observation that several spermatid-specific genes activated during differentiation contain functional cAMP-response elements in their promoters (10Kistler M.K. Sassone-Corsi P. Kistler W.S. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 1322-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 11Zhou Y. Sun Z. Means A.R. Sassone-Corsi P. Bernstein K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12262-12266Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that CREM functions as a master switch to activate the genetic program directing spermatid differentiation (12Sassone-Corsi P. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Because CREM is phosphorylated and activated by the cAMP-regulated protein kinase A in a manner similar to the cAMP-response element-binding protein (7Delmas V. van der Hoorn F. Mellstrom B. Jegou B. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1502-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 13de Groot R.P. den Hertog J. Vandenheede J.R. Goris J. Sassone-Corsi P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3903-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), it has been inferred that cAMP signaling is crucial for spermatogenesis. In male germ cells and mature spermatozoa, cAMP production is catalyzed by at least two cyclases. Spermatids express ACIII, a membrane-bound, G protein-regulated adenylyl cyclase, which is also expressed at high levels in the olfactory system and in brain (14Gautier-Courteille C. Salanova M. Conti M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2588-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Defer N. Marinx O. Poyard M. Lienard M.O. Jegou B. Hanoune J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, it has long been known that a nonconventional, G protein- and forskolin-insensitive, adenylyl cyclase is present in maturing germ cells and spermatozoa (16Braun T. Dods R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1097-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 17Neer E.J. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1978; 9: 69-83PubMed Google Scholar, 18Adamo S. Conti M. Geremia R.

Androl. 1981; 4: 172-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The structure of the soluble form of adenylyl cyclase (sAC) was recently elucidated by protein purification and cloning (20Buck J. Sinclair M.L. Schapal L. Cann M.J. Levin L.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). This adenylyl cyclase is an enzyme with no clearly identifiable transmembrane domain and is structurally related to cyclases found in prokaryotes (20Buck J. Sinclair M.L. Schapal L. Cann M.J. Levin L.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Forskolin and guanine nucleotides do not regulate sAC activity (20Buck J. Sinclair M.L. Schapal L. Cann M.J. Levin L.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), a finding consistent with the properties reported for the germ cell soluble cyclase (18Adamo S. Conti M. Geremia R. Mones"
https://openalex.org/W2043388559,"The NF-κB transcription factor has been shown to inhibit apoptosis in several experimental systems. We therefore investigated whether the expression of the Bax proapoptotic protein could be influenced by NF-κB activity. Increased Bax protein expression was detected in HCT116, OVCAR-3 and MCF7 cells stably expressing a mutated unresponsive IκB-α inhibitory protein that blocks NF-κB activity. Northern blots showed that bax mRNA expression was increased as a consequence of mutated IκB-α expression in HCT116 cells. A careful examination of the human bax gene promoter sequence showed three putative binding sites for NF-κB, and the κB2 site at position -687 could indeed bind NF-κB complexes in vitro. Transient transfection of a bax promoter luciferase construct in HCT116 cells showed that NF-κB proteins could partially inhibit the transactivation of the bax promoter by p53. Mutations or deletions of the κB sites, including κB2, indicated that this NF-κB-dependent inhibitory effect did not require NF-κB DNA-binding, and was thus an indirect effect. However, cotransfection of expression vectors for several known cofactors failed to identify a competition between p53 and NF-κB for a transcription coactivator. Our findings thus demonstrate for the first time that NF-κB regulates, through an indirect pathway, the bax gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2072246040,"Ligand-induced receptor-mediated endocytosis plays a central role in regulating signaling conveyed by tyrosine kinase receptors. This process depends on the recruitment of the adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) complex, clathrin, dynamin, and other accessory proteins to the ligand-bound receptor. We show here that besides AP-2 and clathrin, two other proteins participate in the endocytic process of the insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R); they are EHD1, an Eps15 homology (EH) domain-containing protein 1, and SNAP29, a synaptosomal-associated protein. EHD1 and SNAP29 form complexes with α-adaptin of AP-2 and co-localize in endocytic vesicles, indicating a role for them in endocytosis. EHD1 and SNAP29 interact directly with each other and are present in complexes with IGF-1R. After IGF-1 induction, EHD1 and IGF-1R co-localize intracellularly. Overexpression of EHD1 in Chinese hamster ovary cells represses IGF-1-mediated signaling, as measured by mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation and Akt phosphorylation, indicating that EHD1 plays a role as a down-regulator in IGF-1 signaling pathway.

Upon binding to their cognate ligand, the receptors undergo autophosphorylation within specific motifs that result in extensive recruitment of accessory proteins (2Sorkin A. Waters C.M.

Intracellular localization to plasma membrane pits and vesicles, interaction with prominent proteins of the basal endocytic machinery like α-adaptin of AP-2, and interactions through the EH domain with other proteins harboring the NPFXD sequence like epsin have implicated Eps15 in receptor-mediated endocytosis (18Salcini A.E.

Moreover, functional inhibition of Eps15 by antibodies or dominant negative mutants abrogated endocytosis of EGF and transferrin, therefore supporting the notion that Eps15 mediates endocytosis of the EGF receptor (21Benmerah A.

Tultzinski S. Bromberg Y. Fein A. Kozak C. Joyner A. Horowitz M. Genomics. 1999; 89: 66-76Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar,25Pohl U. Smith J.S. Tachibana I. Ueki K. Lee H.K. Ramaswamy S. Wu Q.

Horowitz, submitted for publication. 2E. Galperin, S. Benjamin, D. Rapaport, R. Rotem-Yehudar, S. Tolchinsky, and M. Horowitz, submitted for publication. These proteins share an EH (Eps15 homology) domain in their C terminus including an EF hand, Ca2+ binding motif, a central coiled-coil region, and a nucleotide binding consensus site at the N-terminal domain. Northern analysis and immunohistochemical studies indicated specific expression of EHD1 in tissues and cell types that depend on IGF-1 for differentiation and maintenance (24Mintz L. Galperin E. Tultzinski S. Bromberg Y. Fein A. Kozak C. Joyner A. Horowitz M. Genomics. 1999; 89: 66-76Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In cells in tissue culture EHD1 was localized in transferrin-containing endocytic vesicles. Structural resemblance to Eps15 and intracellular localization of this protein in endocytic vesicles proposed a role for EHD1 in endocytosis. Here we present data indicating that EHD1 associates with proteins of the endocytic machinery as well as with IGF-1R and SNAP29. The results strongly suggest that EHD1 and SNAP29 participate in IGF-1-induced IGF-1R endocytosis. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the IGF-1R β-chain (C-20, sc-713) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. ACM11, mouse monoclonal anti-α-chain of AP-2 antibodies, were a kind gift from Dr. M. S. Robinson (26Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Anti-clathrin heavy chain antibodies (X22) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Monoclonal anti-IGF-1R α-chain antibodies (2C8, sc-463) for immunoprecipitation were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal anti-IGF-1R α-chain antibodies for immunofluorescence were purchased from Oncogene. Secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Anti-phospho-MAP kinase monoclonal antibodies (442705-S) and anti-MAP kinase polyclonal antibodies (442704-S) were purchased from Sigma. Anti-phospho-Akt polyclonal antibodies (Ser-473, 9721) and anti-Akt polyclonal antibodies (9727) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Rabbit anti-recombinant EHD1 (rEHD1) polyclonal antibodies were prepared as described (24Mintz L. Galperin E. Tultzinski S. Bromberg Y. Fein A. Kozak C. Joyner A. Horowitz M. Genomics. 1999; 89: 66-76Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To prepare anti-recombinant SNAP29 (rSNAP29) polyclonal antibodies, the open reading frame of SNAP29 was cloned into theEcoRI and XhoI restriction sites of pET28a (Novagen). rSNAP29 was purified on nickel beads according to the supplier's recommendations (Novagen), and rabbits were immunized by 5 injections of 0.5 mg/injection of the purified protein at 2–3-week intervals. Animals were bled 10 days after the final booster. Serum was separated from the blood and stored at −80 °C. One grain of rat tissues was homogenized in 4 ml of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100 buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, P8340) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma, P5726). The homogenates were centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 rpm in SS-34 rotor. The extract was affinity-purified on rEHD1 bound to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to manufacturer's manual. Column-bound material was washed three times with PBS, and three elutions were performed with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, which was titrated immediately by 1 m Tris, pH 8.8. Starting material, flow-through, washes, and elutions were resolved on SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western analysis. For affinity purification of rat proteins on a rSNAP29-nickel column, rat tissues were homogenized as described above. Half the extracts were incubated with 3 µg/ml purified rSNAP29 for 2 h at 4 °C. All the extracts were further incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 30 µl of PBS-washed (50% slurry) nickel beads (Novagen). The beads were washed three times with 0.2% Triton X-100 Hepes buffer and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). NIH/IGF-1R cells (NIH3T3 cells overexpressing IGF-1R, a kind gift of Dr. D. LeRoith, NIH) were transiently transfected with either pCDNA1 (Invitrogen), pCDNA1/EHD1 (24Mintz L. Galperin E. Tultzinski S. Bromberg Y. Fein A. Kozak C. Joyner A. Horowitz M. Genomics. 1999; 89: 66-76Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar), pVEGF/CD4 reporter plasmid (a kind gift of Dr. S. Luria, Stil Biotechnology, Israel), or both. 24 h later, the medium was changed to DCCM-1 medium (Biological Industries, 05-010-1) overnight. The cells were induced with/without 50 ng/ml IGF-1 for another 18 h. The cells were harvested, and cytoplasmic RNA was extracted. The expression of CD4 and EHD1 was monitored by reverse transcriptase-PCR reactions with the following primers: for CD4, 5′-GAGTTCTTCACAGAGACTT-3′, 5′-GAAGTGTGGCCAGAAGT-3′, and for EHD1, 5′-CATCGCCGTCATGCAC-3′, 5′-GATGATGCTGATGCTG-3′. The PCR reactions were transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and a Southern blot was performed with specific probes for the expressed genes. Forin vitro complex formation, 2 × 106NIH/IGF-1R cells were serum-starved for 10 h in DCCM-1 medium without insulin or IGF-1 supplemented with 2 mml-Glutamine solution and PEN-STREP solution (Biological Industries). The cells were treated with 100 ng/ml human IGF-1 (PeproTech) for different time intervals. After the treatment, the cells were lysed in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2%Triton X-100 buffer supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, P8340) and a phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma, P5726). The extracts were incubated with 3 µg/ml purified rEHD1 for 2 h at 4 °C and subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-IGF-1R α-chain antibodies conjugated to immobilized rProteinA (Repligen Corp.). The proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis was performed. For immunoprecipitation of proteins derived from rat tissues or tissue-cultured cell lines, the tissues and cells were lysed in 0.2% Triton X-100, Hepes buffer as described above. The extracts were cleared by centrifugation, and supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation using the relevant antibodies conjugated to immobilized rProteinA. The beads were washed three times in the same buffer containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer supplemented with 5% β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) before loading on SDS-PAGE. Proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose blot, and the immunoblot was decorated with the relevant antibodies for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Detection was carried out using horseradish peroxidase conjugated to a specific secondary antibody followed by enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). CHO cells and CHO cells overexpressing EHD1 (CHO/EHD1) were serum-starved for 10 h and treated with 100 ng/ml human IGF-1 (PeproTech) for different time intervals. The cells were extracted in Laemmli sample buffer, and the proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western analysis using anti-phospho-MAP kinase and anti-MAP kinase antibodies or anti-phospho-Akt and anti-Akt antibodies. The autoradiographs were quantitated by phosphorimaging, and the values for the phosphorylated-MAPK or phosphorylated Akt were normalized to the MAPK or Akt values, respectively. Human EHD1 and mouse EHD3 open reading frames were individually cloned in-frame into theEcoRI and the XhoI restriction sites in the “bait” pLexA vector (Interaction trap matchmaker system,CLONTECH) to provide the pLexA/EHD1 and pLexA/EHD3, respectively. Mutant form of EHD1 missing 0.7 kilobases of the N terminus was constructed by cloning a BamHI-XhoI fragment of EHD1 cDNA into pLexA to provide the pLexA/EHD1/NTM. A mutant form of EHD1 missing 0.3 kilobases of the C terminus encompassing the EH domain was constructed by cloning anEcoRI-HincII fragment of the EHD1 cDNA into pLexA to provide the pLexA/EHD1/EHM. All the constructs were used to transform the EGY48 yeast strain and were tested for protein expression, entrance to the nucleus, and inability to activate the system. Yeast harboring the pLexA/EHD1 served to screen human brain library according to the manufacturer's instructions (Interaction trap matchmaker system). pB42AD vector encoding the SNAP29 gene was rescued and tested for interaction with yeast strains expressing the pLexA fusion proteins described above. PB42AD vector expressing a mutant form of SNAP29 (SNAP29/NTM), missing the first 30 amino acids of the N terminus, was constructed by amplifying a SNAP29 cDNA fragment with the sense primer 5′-gcggacagggaattccagcagtac-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-tccgtctgtctctcgagtcagagttg-3′. The PCR fragment was cloned into the EcoRI-XhoI sites of the pB42AD plasmid to provide pB42AD/SNAP29/NTM. SNAP29 open reading frame was cloned into EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites of pLexA to produce pLexA/SNAP29. Human IGF-1R β-chain cytoplasmic tail (from amino acid 970 to the end of the IGF-1R β-chain) was amplified from an human placenta cDNA library (CLONTECH) using the sense primer 5′-GCAGGCTGGAATTCGGAGTGCTGTATGCC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-GATCCACTGAGGTACAGGAGGCTTGTG-3′ and was cloned in-frame into theEcoRI and the BamHI sites of the bait vector pLexA (Interaction trap matchmaker system). The human IGF-1R β-chain cytoplasmic tail PCR fragment was also cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the pB42AD vector. The transformed yeast colonies were first grown on glucose/histidine−/uracyl−/tryptophan− plates, and four individual colonies from each transformation were assayed for growth either on galactose/raffinose/ histidine−/uracyl−/tryptophan−/leucine− or galactose/raffinose/histidine−/uracyl−/tryptophan−/X-gal plates. Growth on leucine− plates or blue-colored colonies on X-gal plates indicated interaction between the bait and the prey recombinant proteins. For SNAP29 and EHD1 localization, CHO cells grown on cover glasses for 1 day were transfected with pEGFP-C3-EHD1 (24Mintz L. Galperin E. Tultzinski S. Bromberg Y. Fein A. Kozak C. Joyner A. Horowitz M. Genomics. 1999; 89: 66-76Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar) for 48 h. After rinsing with PBS at room temperature, cells were fixed for 30 min with 3.7% paraformaldehyde. After permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 4–5 min, blocking was performed in 5% normal goat serum (in PBS) for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were incubated with anti-rSNAP29 antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. After rinsing with PBS, the slides were incubated with the monoclonal indocarbocyanin (Cy3)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (The Jackson Laboratory) for 30 min at room temperature. After washes with PBS, the cover glasses were mounted on a glass slide in mounting reagent (Galvanol). For EHD1 and IGF-1R co-localization, CHO cells grown on cover glasses for 1 day were starved overnight in a serum-free DCCM-1 medium. After treatment of 1 h with 100 ng/ml IGF-1 at 4 °C, they were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, fixed, and stained with polyclonal anti-EHD1 antibodies and monoclonal anti-IGF-1R antibodies. The cells were decorated with the corresponding, fluorescently labeled, secondary antibodies. To explore the proteins that associate with EHD1, rat testes extract was affinity-purified on a rEHD1 affinity column. Eluted proteins were subjected to Western analysis. As depicted in Fig.1a, α-adaptin of AP-2 and the heavy chain of clathrin, proteins characteristic of the endocytic machinery, were found in complexes with rEHD1. REHD1 formed complexes with three proteins with molecular masses of 63, 68, and 80 kDa, which were detected by anti-rEHD1 antibodies. The 63-kDa protein represents EHD1 and EHD3, whereas the 68-kDa represents EHD2 and EHD4 (25Pohl U. Smith J.S. Tachibana I. Ueki K. Lee H.K. Ramaswamy S. Wu Q. Mohrenweiser H.W. Jenkins R.B. Louis D.N. Genomics. 2000; 63: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Actually we have shown that EHD1 is able to undergo self-dimerization, as demonstrated for Eps15 (27Tebar F. Confalonieri S. Carter R.E. Di Fiore P.P. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15413-15418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and to form hetero-oligomers with EHD3,2 EHD2, and EHD4. 3R. Rotem-Yehudar and M. Horowitz, unpublished results. The proteins designated as 1 and 2, Fig. 1 a, may represent other unknown proteins that share an antigenic determinant(s) with EHD1, are unable to bind EHD1, and are recognized by anti-EHD1 antibodies. The 80-kDa protein may represent another unknown EH domain- containing protein that shares antigenic determinant(s) with EHD1, is able to bind EHD1, and is recognized by anti-EHD1 antibodies. Interestingly, EHD1 formed complexes with the β-chain of the IGF-1 receptor. These results indicate association of EHD1 with proteins of the endocytic machinery and with the IGF-1 receptor. Anin vitro assay was developed to confirm the interaction of EHD1 with IGF-1R. NIH3T3 cells over-expressing the human IGF-1 receptor (NIH3T3/IGF-1R) (28LeRoith D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 692: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) were treated with IGF-1 for different time intervals. Extracts prepared from these cells were incubated with rEHD1 and further subjected to immunoprecipitation using monoclonal anti-IGF-1R α-chain antibodies, and the Western blot was decorated with either anti-IGF-1R β-chain antibodies or anti-EHD1 antibodies. As depicted in Fig. 1 b, the level of the IGF-1 receptors recognized by both anti-α-chain and anti-β-chain antibodies was elevated at up to 5 min of IGF-1 treatment, whereas within 10 min of treatment, their level declined. Minor changes were observed in the level of IGF-1R precursor, which migrated as a 180-kDa protein, indicating that only the mature receptors responded to IGF-1 induction, presumably by conformational changes that prevented their antibody recognition. rEHD1 was shown to associate with IGF-1R. The association increased within 5 min of IGF-1 induction and decreased to basal level after 15 min of treatment. These results demonstrate an association between rEHD1 and IGF-1R that depends on IGF-1 stimuli. To confirm the interaction between IGF-1R and EHD1, we tested their intracellular localization. CHO cells overexpressing EHD1 were serum-starved overnight, treated with IGF-1 for 1 h, fixed, and reacted with anti-EHD1 rabbit polyclonal antibodies or anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibodies as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” The cells were visualized using confocal microscopy. As indicated in Fig.1 c, there is an intracellular colocalization of IGF-1R and EHD1, confirming their interaction. IGF-1 mediates the MAPK and Akt-signaling cascades (29Werner H. Le Roith D. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1997; 8: 71-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To verify whether EHD1 influences the signal transduced by IGF-1 receptor, phosphorylation of MAP kinase (MAPK) or Akt was followed in CHO cells and in CHO cells overexpressing the EHD1 gene (CHO/EHD1) 4E. Galperin and M. Horowitz, manuscript in preparation. in response to IGF-1. As depicted in Fig. 2a, treating CHO cells with IGF-1 leads to phosphorylation of MAPK within 2.5 min, which reaches high levels at 15 min of treatment. In contrast, in CHO/EHD1 cells, the phosphorylation of MAPK is retarded, and at 15 min, the phosphorylation is 2.3-fold reduced compared with the parental cells. As indicated in Fig. 2 b, IGF-1 treatment leads to Akt phosphorylation within 2.5 min, which reaches high levels at 5 min of treatment. In contrast, in CHO/EHD1 cells, the phosphorylation of Akt is retarded, and at 5 min, the phosphorylation is 2.2-fold reduced compared with the parental cells. Therefore, overexpression of EHD1 reduces IGF-1-induced signaling as measured by MAPK and Akt phosphorylation, suggesting that EHD1 is a down-modulator of the signaling pathway. Another approach was applied to show that overexpression of EHD1 down-regulates IGF-1-induced signaling. NIH3T3/IGF-1R cells were co-transfected with an EHD1 expression vector (pCDNA1/EHD1) and a reporter vector harboring the CD4 cDNA under a VEGF promoter (pVEGF/CD4). After an overnight starvation, the cells were treated with IGF-1 for 18 h and harvested. RNA was extracted and used for reverse transcriptase-PCR reactions using primers specific for CD4 and EHD1 (as explained under “Experimental Procedures”). We found an ∼10-fold reduction in the amount of CD4 RNA in cells overexpressing EHD1 versus those that do not after IGF-1 induction (Fig.2 c). We searched for potential binding partners of EHD1 using the yeast two-hybrid system. A bait construct comprising the EHD1 fused to the LexA protein was used to screen a human brain cDNA library. One isolated clone encoded the human SNAP29. SNAP29, a 29-kDa synaptosomal-associated protein, shares structural homology with SNAP25 and SNAP23, proteins of the SNARE complex, participating in vesicular membrane fusion events (30Steegmaier M. Yang B. Yoo J.S. Huang B. Shen M., Yu, S. Luo Y. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34171-34179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Unlike the latter, SNAP29 contains at its N terminus two motifs, NPFXD sequence (amino acids 8–12) and PXXPXXP (amino acids 32–38), which are characteristic of proteins participating in trafficking, especially in endocytosis. As shown in Fig.3a, SNAP29 was able to interact with EHD1, EHD3, and truncated EHD1 missing either its N terminus or its C terminus, indicating it interacts with the central coiled-coil region of EHD1. On the other hand, a mutated version of SNAP29 lacking amino acids 1–38 or other non-relevant genes like Rubisco of tomato or human clathrin light chain (data not shown) were unable to interact with any of the EHD1-derived proteins (Fig.3 a). Nonetheless, the truncated SNAP29 was able to interact with SNAP29, although to a lesser extent than the wild type SNAP29 protein, as shown in Fig. 3 d by growth on the LEU− plate. These results indicate that the interaction between SNAP29 and EHD1 is directed through modules within those 38 amino acids of SNAP29. To further demonstrate the interaction between SNAP29 and EHD1, rat tissue extracts were affinity-purified on a rSNAP29 column. The eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the imunoblot was decorated with anti-EHD1 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3 b, EHD proteins from rat brain, heart, lung, and kidney bound to rSNAP29 and not to the control beads. This experiment indicates that SNAP29 binds to EHD proteins from various rat tissues, supporting the findings in yeast. Immunoprecipitation of rat tissue extracts was performed using monoclonal antibodies directed against the α-chain of the IGF-1 receptor. The precipitates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western analysis using anti-EHD1 and anti-SNAP29 antibodies. As indicated in Fig. 3 c, IGF-1 receptor formed complexes with EHD proteins derived from testes, brain, lung, and kidney. SNAP29 was found in complexes with IGF-1R in the same tissues as the EHD proteins. To confirm the interaction between SNAP29 and IGF-1R, extracts of NIH3T3/IGF-1R cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-IGF-1R α-chain antibodies, and the immunoblot was decorated either with anti-SNAP29 antibodies or with anti-IGF-1R β-chain antibodies. As depicted in Fig. 3 d, IGF-1R formed complexes with SNAP29. To test whether SNAP29 interacts directly with IGF-1R, the yeast two-hybrid system was employed. Yeast expressing the pLexA/SNAP29 plasmid were transformed with either the pB42AD/IGF-1R β-chain, pB42AD/EHD1, pB42AD/SNAP29, or pB42AD/SNAP29/NTM constructs. As demonstrated in Fig. 3 e, SNAP29 did not interact directly with IGF-1R, whereas it strongly interacted with itself to form homodimers. It weakly interacted with SNAP29 mutant missing amino acids 1–38, as demonstrated by growth on Leu− plates. These results indicate that SNAP29 does not bind to IGF-1R directly but most probably through a mediator (s). To test the possible association of SNAP29 with proteins of the endocytic machinery, immunoprecipitation of rat tissue extracts was performed using anti-SNAP29 antibodies. The precipitates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western analysis using anti-α-adaptin of AP-2 antibodies. The results (Fig. 4) indicate that SNAP29 forms complexes with AP-2. The two-hybrid analysis and the co-immunoprecipitation results indicated interaction between EHD1 and SNAP29. Moreover, both proteins interacted with members of the endocytic machinery. To confirm these results, intracellular localization was followed. Cells were transfected with plasmid expressing the EHD1-green fluorescent protein fusion protein. The cells were fixed, interacted with anti-SNAP29 antibodies, and decorated with rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies. The results demonstrated (Fig. 5) that both SNAP29 and EHD1 co-localized to punctuate vesicular structures throughout the cytoplasm. Since EHD1 was previously shown to localize to transferrin-containing vesicles, it is conceivable that the vesicular structures observed herein are endocytic vesicles. Structural resemblance to Eps15, which was shown to participate in endocytosis, and intracellular localization to endocytic vesicles, have already marked EHD1 as a candidate participating in endocytic processes (24Mintz L. Galperin E. Tultzinski S. Bromberg Y. Fein A. Kozak C. Joyner A. Horowitz M. Genomics. 1999; 89: 66-76Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover, using immunofluorescence analysis, we co-localized AP-2 and EHD1 in endocytic vesicles.2 Here we show that EHD1 interacts with proteins considered as hallmarks of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, α-adaptin of AP-2 and clathrin. Eps15 was shown to couple α-adaptin of AP-2 directly via DPF repeats at its C terminus. EHD1 does not harbor such repeats, and further investigation is required to determine whether it binds the protein directly. Affinity purification experiments have shown that EHD1 binds 63, 68, and 80 kDa proteins that are recognized by anti-EHD1 antibodies (Fig.1 a). The 63-kDa protein represents EHD1 and EHD3, whereas the 68-kDa protein represents EHD2 and EHD4 (25Pohl U. Smith J.S. Tachibana I. Ueki K. Lee H.K. Ramaswamy S. Wu Q. Mohrenweiser H.W. Jenkins R.B. Louis D.N. Genomics. 2000; 63: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Since these proteins share antigenic determinant with EHD1 and are able to bind EHD1 (Fig.1 a), and since all four EHD proteins are able to interact with each other and this interaction is basically mediated by the coiled-coil region,3 we propose that the EHD family of proteins and proteins that share similar structural modules form oligomers. Similarly, Tebar et al. (27Tebar F. Confalonieri S. Carter R.E. Di Fiore P.P. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15413-15418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) demonstrate that the Eps15 forms homodimers and oligomers in vivo and that this interaction is mediated via the coiled-coil region of the proteins. These authors proposed that oligomerization of EH domain-containing proteins may be a general feature important for the functional activity of this family of proteins. Results of experiments presented here implicate EHD1 in the endocytic process of the IGF-1R. IGF-1R bound to the rEHD1 column. Only a small fraction of IGF-1 receptors expressed in the rat testis was bound to rEHD1, presumably due to prerequisites like phosphorylation for such binding (Fig. 1 a). It has already been shown for the EGF receptor that phosphorylation within specific motifs in the cytoplasmic tail is required for extensive recruitment of accessory proteins, among them Eps15 (4Marsh M. McMahon H.T. Science. 1999; 285: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). IGF-1R and EHD1 were found in in vitroformed complexes that were immunoprecipitated with anti-α -chain of IGF-1R antibodies (Fig. 1 b). Complexes containing IGF-1R and EHD proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-IGF-1R antibodies (Fig. 3 c). Results of immunofluorescence analyses indicated colocalization of EHD1 in IGF-1R-containing vesicles (Fig. 1 c). We also have results indicating that overexpression of EHD1 abrogates IGF-1-induced signaling. It has been shown that the IGF-1-signaling cascade induces the MAP kinase (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and Akt (29Werner H. Le Roith D. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1997; 8: 71-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar,31Miele C. Rochford J.J. Filippa N. Giorgetti-Peraldi S. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21695-21702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Overexpression of EHD1 reduced 2.3 and 2.2 times the magnitude of IGF-1-induced signaling through the Ras-Raf pathway and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, respectively (Fig. 2), demonstrating that EHD1 is a down-modulator of these pathways. It is worth mentioning that recent publications indicated that endocytosis up-regulates signaling of activated receptors like the EGF receptor and the β2-adrenergic receptor (32Ceresa B.P. Schmid S.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). We could also show that overexpression of EHD1 down-regulates IGF-1-induced signaling by co-transfection of an EHD1 expression vector with a reporter vector harboring the CD4 cDNA under a VEGF promoter into NIH3T3/IGF-1R cells. We found a 10-fold reduction in the amount of CD4 RNA in cells overexpressing EHD1 versus those that do not after IGF-1 induction (Fig. 2 c). Using the two-hybrid analysis, we identified SNAP29 as an interacting partner of EHD1 (Fig. 3, a–c). SNAP29 was initially discovered as an interacting partner of syntaxin 3 in a two-hybrid screen and was shown to be ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues (30Steegmaier M. Yang B. Yoo J.S. Huang B. Shen M., Yu, S. Luo Y. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34171-34179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). SNAP29 displays 39% similarity to neuronal SNAP25 and 35% similarity to the ubiquitously expressed SNAP23 (30Steegmaier M. Yang B. Yoo J.S. Huang B. Shen M., Yu, S. Luo Y. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34171-34179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The SNAP proteins were described as participating in the core SNARE complex that underlines membrane fusion processes (33Rothman J.E. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1994; 29: 81-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 34Weis W.I. Scheller R.H.

In the nerve terminal, the vesicle and plasma membrane are brought into close apposition through the formation of a four-helices-bundle structure. Vesicle-associated membranous proteins synaptobrevin/VAMP (vesicle-associated membrane protein)-vesicle SNAP receptor (v-SNARE) contribute one helix, whereas the target membrane proteins (t-SNARE) SNAP25 and syntaxin contribute three helices to form a parallel bundle referred to as the SNARE complex (33Rothman J.E. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1994; 29: 81-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 34Weis W.I. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 328-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 35Vogel K. Cabaniols J.P. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2959-2965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Unlike SNAP25 and SNAP23, SNAP29 does not have palmitoylation sites for anchoring a distinct membrane compartment, but rather, it is able to interact with different syntaxins and VAMPs that are specifically localized to distinct compartments; therefore, it was suggested as involved in multiple transport steps (30Steegmaier M. Yang B. Yoo J.S. Huang B. Shen M., Yu, S. Luo Y. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34171-34179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). SNAP29 forms complexes with IGF-1R in vivo (Fig. 3,c and d). Moreover, SNAP29 binds directly to EHD1 (Fig. 3, a and b). This interaction is strong and is carried out through the central coiled-coil region of EHD1 (Fig.3 a). It seems that the N terminus of SNAP29 participates in the binding to EHD1 (Fig. 3 a). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the truncated form of SNAP29 missing this region has lost the conformation required for the binding. This mutant was able to bind SNAP29 (Fig. 3 e), although the binding was inefficient; therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that this region is involved in binding to both EHD1 and SNAP29. The mechanism whereby EHD1 and SNAP29 are recruited to the endocytic complex of the activated IGF-1R is not yet understood. However, according to the yeast two-hybrid assay, SNAP29 does not interact directly with the cytoplasmic tail of IGF-1R β-chain, as demonstrated in Fig.3 e, suggesting that the interaction between SNAP29 and IGF-1R depends on accessory proteins. Indeed, SNAP29 also formed complexes with α-adaptin of AP-2 (Fig. 4). EHD1 and SNAP29 co-localized to endocytic vesicles (Fig. 5). All these findings indicate participation of EHD1 and SNAP29 in endocytosis of the IGF-1R. Future studies will provide detailed characterization of the involvement of SNAP29 and EHD1 along specific intracellular traffic stations of the endocytic process. Another EH domain-containing protein termed intersectin was found in a yeast two-hybrid screen as an interacting partner of SNAP25, a hallmark of the vesicle SNAP receptor (SNARE) complex, playing a role in exocytosis at nerve terminals (36Okamoto M. Schoch S. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18446-18454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Intersectin interacts with dynamin, a prominent accessory protein of endocytosis that participates in the pinching process of the coated pit and binds to Ras exchange factor mSos1, thus providing indication for linkage between endocytosis and signaling processes (37Tong X.K. Hussain N.K. de Heuvel E. Kurakin A. Abi-Jaoude E. Quinn C.C. Olson M.F. Marais R. Baranes D. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1263-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In another work, Adams et al. (38Adams A. Thorn J.M. Yamabhai M. Kay B.K. O'Bryan J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27414-27420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that intersectin overexpression activated Elk-1 transcription factor in a MAPK-independent manner, and this ability resided within the EH domain. Moreover, intersectin expression was enough to induce oncogenic transformation of rodent fibroblasts. These data suggest that intersectin may link endocytosis with regulation pathways important for cell growth and differentiation. Different from EHD1, intersectins harbor several EH domains and three SH3 modules, enabling them, most probably, to participate in trafficking and signaling processes (36Okamoto M. Schoch S. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18446-18454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We propose that SNAP29 functions with EHD1, an EH domain-containing protein, to mediate IGF-1R endocytosis. Both these proteins were co-localized to endocytic vesicles, and both formed complexes with α-adaptin of AP-2 and IGF-1R. EHD1, which shares structural homology to Eps15, was found to associate with IGF-1R in response to IGF-1 stimuli and was shown to down-regulate IGF-1 signaling, suggesting it is involved in the sequestration of IGF-1R. SNAP29 and EHD1 were demonstrated to bind IGF-1R both in vitro and in vivo. The accumulated data indicate a role for these proteins in IGF-1R endocytosis. We are grateful to Dr. D. LeRoith, NIH for the NIH3T3 cells overexpressing the human IGF-1 receptor and Dr. S. Luria from Stil Biotechnology, Ramat-Gan, Israel, for the VEGF/CD4 plasmid."
https://openalex.org/W2319173743,"In this study, we asked whether overexpression of caspase-3, a central downstream executioner of apoptotic pathways, might sensitize breast cancer cells with acquired drug resistance (MT1/ADR) to drug-induced apoptosis. As control, we employed caspase-3 negative and caspase-3-transfected MCF-7 cells. Whereas mock-transfected MCF-7 cells were resistant to epirubicin, etoposide and paclitaxel (taxol), the same drugs led to breakdown of nuclear DNA in caspase-3-transfected MCF-7 cells. MT1/ADR cells express low levels of wild type caspase-3 but show defective caspase activation and apoptosis upon drug exposure. These cells also display a less efficient activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition. Caspase-3-transfected MT1/ADR clones showed a 2.8-fold increase in the protein level and a 3.7-fold higher specific enzyme activity. Procaspase-3 overexpression was not toxic and did not affect background apoptosis. Interestingly, procaspase-3-transfected MT1/ADR cells were more sensitive to cytotoxic drugs as compared with vector-transfected controls and DNA fragmentation nearly reached the levels of the original drug sensitive MT1 cells. Thus, overexpression of caspase-3 enhances chemosensitivity especially in situations where activation of the mitochondrial apoptosome is disturbed."
https://openalex.org/W2001084206,"Regions of hypoxia are a common feature of solid tumours. When tumour cells are exposed to hypoxic stress, transcription of a battery of genes is initiated. The angiogenic factor adrenomedullin (ADM) is a hypoxia regulated gene. ADM is thought to act through the G protein-coupled receptor calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR), with specificity being conferred by the receptor associated modifying protein 2 (RAMP2). Here we report for the first time that ADM treated or stably transfected Ishikawa cells overexpressing ADM show increased resistance to hypoxia induced apoptosis. These cells also show an upregulation of the oncoprotein Bcl-2, which is protective against hypoxic cell death when transiently transfected into Ishikawa cells. Since Ishikawa cells express the putative ADM-receptor CRLR–RAMP2 the production and secretion of ADM with the consecutive upregulation of Bcl-2 could establish an autocrine/paracrine mechanism rescuing malignant cells from hypoxic cell death. These results, taken together with our previous findings that ADM is an angiogenic factor which is upregulated by the nonsteroidal antiestrogen tamoxifen (TAM) in endometrial cells, implicate this peptide as a promoter of tumour growth and a possible target for anticancer strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2124226554,"Complex lactose-derived oligosaccharides belong to the main components of human milk and are believed to exert multiple functions in the breast-fed infant. Therefore, we investigated the transepithelial transport of human milk oligosaccharides over Caco-2 monolayers. Main human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) in the apical, basolateral, or intracellular compartment were separated by high performance liquid chromatography using a Hypercarb(TM) column and analyzed on line by mass spectrometry. This method allowed the identification and quantification of these components in intra- and extracellular fractions without prior purification. Using this technique we were able to show that acidic and neutral HMOs cross the epithelial barrier. The transepithelial flux of neutral, but not acidic, oligosaccharides was temperature-sensitive and partly inhibited by brefeldin A and bafilomycin A. Furthermore, net flux from the apical to the basolateral compartment was only observed for the neutral components. Similarly, apical cellular uptake was only found for neutral components but not for acidic oligosaccharides. Intracellular concentrations of neutral HMOs were significantly increased by inhibitors of transcytosis such as brefeldin A, N-ethylmaleimide, or bafilomycin A. The cellular uptake was saturable, and an apparent K(m) for lacto-N-fucopentaose I of 1.7 +/- 0.1 mmol/liter and for lacto-N-tetraose of 1.8 +/- 0.4 mmol/liter was determined. Furthermore, the uptake of lacto-N-fucopentaose I could be inhibited by the addition of the stereoisomer lacto-N-fucopentaose II but not by lacto-N-tetraose. These findings suggest that neutral HMOs are transported across the intestinal epithelium by receptor-mediated transcytosis as well as via paracellular pathways, whereas translocation of acidic HMOs solely represents paracellular flux."
https://openalex.org/W2073493394,"To survive fluctuations in quality and intensity of light, plants and algae are able to preferentially direct the absorption of light energy to either one of the two photosystems, PSI or PSII. This rapid process is referred to as a state transition and has been correlated with the phosphorylation and migration of the light-harvesting complex protein (LHCP) between PSII and PSI. We show here that thylakoid protein kinases (TAKs) are required for state transitions in Arabidopsis. Antisense TAK1 expression leads to a loss of LHCP phosphorylation and a reduction in state transitions. Preferential activation of PSII causes LHCP to accumulate with PSI, and TAK1 mutants disrupt this process. Finally, TAKs also influence the phosphorylation of multiple thylakoid proteins.

Alterations in light exposure can lead to the excessive stimulation of either one of the two photosystems and may result in unequal light utilization and damage (1Gal H. Zer H. Ohad I. Physiol.

Most organisms, especially vascular plants, are unable to avoid these light changes, and they have evolved several mechanisms to alter the distribution of light energy between photosystem I (PSI)1and photosystem II (PSII) (Fig. 1). These include transcriptional regulation of photosystem components (3Mayfield S.P. Yohn C.B. Cohen A Dannon A. Annu. Rev. Plant. Physiol. Plant Mol.

The latter process, a more rapid regulatory mechanism, is referred to as a state transition and is commonly measured by the differing levels of PSII fluorescence (2Vener A.V. Ohad I. Anderson B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 7Allen J.F. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 1992; 1098: 275-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that this migration balances the light harvesting and thus reaction center activity (9Wollman F.-A. Delepelaire P.J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). When energy utilization between the two photosystems is balanced, LHCP becomes dephosphorylated and moves from PSI back to PSII (1Gal H. Zer H. Ohad I. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 869-885Crossref Google Scholar, 2Vener A.V. Ohad I. Anderson B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, until recently the protein kinase(s) responsible for the critical phosphorylation step of LHCP had not been isolated (10Snyders S. Kohorn B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9137-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and therefore a direct test of this model was not possible.The current kinase activation model states that light absorption by PSII and PSI leads to energy transduction along the thylakoid membrane (Fig. 1 A). Electron flow from PSII to PSI results in the reduction of the plastoquinone to plastoquinol. The Rieske Fe-S center, cytochrome (cyt) f, and plastocyanin are also reduced in the membrane (2Vener A.V. Ohad I. Anderson B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Binding of the plastoquinol (Qr; Fig. 1) to the cytochrome b 6 f complex (cytb 6 f) quinol oxidation site (Qox) activates a kinase (Refs. 2Vener A.V. Ohad I. Anderson B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar and 11Zito F. Finazzi G. Delosme R. Nitschke W. Picot D. Wollman F.-A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2961-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar; Fig.1 B). The model predicts that the kinase then phosphorylates LHCP (creating LHCPP), resulting in LHCPPmigration from PSII to PSI (Fig.1 C). The association of LHCP with PSI requires the PSI-H subunit (12Lunde C. Jensen P.E. Haldrup A. Knoetzel J. Scheller H.V. Nature. 2000; 408: 613-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). There are several theories attempting to explain how LHCPP moves within the thylakoid membrane to associate with the less stimulated PS. Some but not all evidence points to a lateral migration of LHCP in the thylakoid membrane from stacked to stroma exposed membranes (2Vener A.V. Ohad I. Anderson B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 13Anderson B. Barber J. Bittar E.E. Advances in Molecular and Cell Biology.

Other investigators have proposed a limited unstacking of the appressed grana membranes to allow for movement of the LHCPP to PSI (14Kohorn B.D. Yakir D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2118-2123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Georgakopoulos J.H. Argyroudi-Akoyunglu J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 380-390Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The binding of the plastoquinol at the Qox site occurs in the luminal side of the thylakoid membrane, but since phosphorylation occurs on the stromal face of the thylakoid, it is not clear how the signal is conveyed; the model suggests that the signal is transduced through the subunits of the cytb 6 f complex. The simplest scenario would be for the kinase to interact with the activated cytb 6 f complex, become activated itself, and then phosphorylate LHCP. In this case, the kinase would be in physical contact with these thylakoid components. The activated state of the kinase persists as long as the Qox is occupied with Qr (2Vener A.V. Ohad I. Anderson B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Withdrawal of a single electron from Qr, due to PSI activity, leads to reoxidation of Qr and deactivation of the kinase. Oxidation of the reduced quinol pool is proposed to trigger the activation of a membrane-bound phosphatase (16Silverstein T. Cheng L. Allen J.F. FEBS Lett. 1993; 371: 101-105Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar), resulting in the dephosphorylation of the LHCP. This results in the reassociation of LHCP with PSII. Recently, a luminal cyclophilin-regulated phosphatase that is involved in dephosphorylation and protein turnover during repair of PSII has been identified (17Vener A.V. Rokka A. Fulgosi H. Anderson B. Hermann R.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14955-14965Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The role of this phosphatase during photosynthesis and state transitions is still unknown.We have previously identified and purified a family of three kinases, thylakoid-associated kinases (TAKs), responsible for the in vitro phosphorylation of LHCP in Arabidopsis (10Snyders S. Kohorn B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9137-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thein vitro phosphorylation of LHCP was redox-dependent, since DTT was required for this reaction. The role and mechanism of interaction of the TAKs with themselves and with other thylakoid membrane components were unknown. TAKs contain a glycine serine motif (GS motif) that is a key regulatory substrate in TGF-β receptor signaling (18Massagué J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2053) Google Scholar). Since TAKs are phosphorylated (10Snyders S. Kohorn B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9137-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), they may be part of a kinase cascade that could initiate with the signal from the cytochrome b 6 fcomplex, activate LHCP phosphorylation, and result in state transitions.We show here that TAKs interact with both cyt f and LHCP and that specific stimulation of PSII causes the accumulation of LHCP with PSI, as predicted by the state transition model. A reduction in the amount of TAK1 protein leads to a loss of LHCP phosphorylation and state transitions. We also provide evidence that TAKs are involved in additional phosphorylation events in the chloroplast.

We have previously identified and purified a family of three kinases, thylakoid-associated kinases (TAKs), responsible for the in vitro phosphorylation of LHCP in Arabidopsis (10Snyders S. Kohorn B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9137-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thein vitro phosphorylation of LHCP was redox-dependent, since DTT was required for this reaction. The role and mechanism of interaction of the TAKs with themselves and with other thylakoid membrane components were unknown. TAKs contain a glycine serine motif (GS motif) that is a key regulatory substrate in TGF-β receptor signaling (18Massagué J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2053) Google Scholar). Since TAKs are phosphorylated (10Snyders S. Kohorn B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9137-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), they may be part of a kinase cascade that could initiate with the signal from the cytochrome b 6 fcomplex, activate LHCP phosphorylation, and result in state transitions. We show here that TAKs interact with both cyt f and LHCP and that specific stimulation of PSII causes the accumulation of LHCP with PSI, as predicted by the state transition model. A reduction in the amount of TAK1 protein leads to a loss of LHCP phosphorylation and state transitions. We also provide evidence that TAKs are involved in additional phosphorylation events in the chloroplast. We thank Tanya Wagner, Cathy Anderson, Jean David Rochaix, and Francis Andre Wollman for helpful discussion."
https://openalex.org/W2035386168,"Many studies suggest that a multi-tissue tumour suppressor gene is located at human chromosome 7q31.1. We have cloned and characterized a novel gene at this locus. The TES gene lies within the minimal region of overlap of several LOH studies and appears to possess the properties of a tumour suppressor. TES is widely expressed and is predicted to encode a protein of 421 amino acids, with three C-terminal LIM domains. Mutation analysis of the coding TES exons in 21 human tumour-derived cell lines revealed the presence of a frameshift mutation in one allele in the breast cancer cell line ZR-75. Methylation of the CpG island at the 5' end of TES appears to be a remarkably frequent finding, occurring in seven out of 10 ovarian carcinomas and in each of the 30 tumour-derived cell lines tested. Moreover, forced expression of TES in HeLa or OVCAR5 cells, resulted in a profound reduction in growth potential, as determined by the colony formation assay. We believe that TES is a tumour suppressor gene that is inactivated primarily by transcriptional silencing resulting from CpG island methylation."
https://openalex.org/W2068441977,"Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DP), an infiltrative skin tumour of intermediate malignancy, presents specific cytogenetic features such as reciprocal translocations t(17;22)(q22;q13.1) or supernumerary ring chromosomes derived from t(17;22). We have previously shown that both rings and translocated chromosomes derived from t(17;22) presented the same molecular rearrangement with fusion of the COL1A1 gene on chromosome 17 to the PDGFB gene on chromosome 22. To study the structure and function of the COL1A1-PDGFB chimeric protein, we used a tumour-derived chimeric COL1A1-PDGFB cDNA to perform stable and transient transfections in the Chinese hamster lung fibroblastic cell line PS200 and the human epithelial cell line HEK293. We demonstrated that the stably transfected clones that expressed the COL1A1-PDGFB chimeric protein became growth factors independent and tumorigenic in nude mice. In addition, COL1A1-PDGFB transfected cell supernatants significantly stimulated fibroblastic cell growth, through the activation of the PDGFB receptor pathway. By using anti-PDGFB and specific anti-COL1A1-PDGFB antibodies, we showed that, similar to PDGFB, the COL1A1-PDGFB chimeric proteins are processed in transfected cells into mature PDGFB dimers. These results strongly suggest that the COL1A1-PDGFB chimeric gene expression associated with DP, induces tumours formation through production of mature PDGFB, in an autocrine or paracrine way. Strikingly, mutagenesis experiments indicated that uncleaved COL1A1-PDGFB forms are mitogenic and therefore could contribute, as well as mature PDGFB, to the establishment of a transformed phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2034114619,"Vimentin, one of type III intermediate filament (IF) proteins, is expressed not only in mesenchymal cells but also in most types of tumor cells. In the present study, we introduced several types of vimentin mutated at putative phosphorylation sites in its amino-terminal head domain into type III IF-negative T24 cells. Site-specific mutation induced the formation of an unusually long bridge-like IF structure between the unseparated daughter cells, although these mutants formed the filament network similar to wild type in interphase cells. Together with sites phosphorylated by Rho-kinase and protein kinase C (PKC), vimentin-Ser72, which can not be phosphorylated by any known vimentin kinase, was one of the mutation sites essential for this phenotype. We further demonstrated that vimentin-Ser72 was phosphorylated specifically at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. These observations suggest the existence of a novel protein kinase responsible for vimentin filament separation through the cleavage furrow-specific vimentin phosphorylation. We propose that Rho-kinase, PKC, and an unidentified vimentin-Ser72 kinase may play important roles in vimentin filament separation during cytokinesis."

Cytoprotection may be mediated by expression of membrane-associated cytoskeletal proteins including filamin A, an actin-binding protein that increases the rigidity of the subcortical actin cytoskeleton. In this study, we tested the hypotheses that applied forces induce the expression of filamin A specifically and that this putative protective response inhibits cell death. Magnetically generated forces were applied to protein-coated magnetite beads bound to human gingival fibroblasts, cells with constitutively low basal levels of filamin A mRNA and protein. Forces applied through collagen or fibronectin, but not bovine serum albumin or poly-l-lysine-coated beads, increased mRNA and protein content of filamin A by 3–7-fold. Forces had no effect on the expression of other filamin isotypes or other cytoskeletal proteins. This effect was dependent on the duration of force and was blocked by anti-β1 integrin antibodies. Force also stimulated a 60% increase in expression of luciferase under the control of a filamin A promoter in transiently transfected Rat2 fibroblasts and was dependent on Sp1 transcription factor binding sites located immediately upstream of the transcription start site. Experiments with actinomycin D-treated cells showed that the increased filamin A expression after force application was due in part to prolongation of mRNA half-life. Antisense filamin oligonucleotides blocked force-induced filamin A expression and increased cell death by >2-fold above controls. The force-induced regulation of filamin A was dependent on intact actin filaments. We conclude that cells from mechanically active environments can couple diverse signals from forces applied through β-integrins to up-regulate the production of cytoprotective cytoskeletal proteins, typified by filamin A.

FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2013-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). For example, mechanical force affects the expression of several cytoskeletal genes including the α-skeletal and α-smooth muscle actin isoforms (1Watson P.A. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2013-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) as well as the actin-binding proteins talin and vinculin (2Tidball J.G. Spencer M.J. Wehling M. Lavergne E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33155-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Mechanical force induction of cytoskeletal protein expression has been examined most prominently reported for smooth muscle cells (3Birukov K.G. Bardy N. Lehoux S. Merval R. Shirinsky V.P. Tedgui A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 922-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 4Brown K.D. Binder L.I. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), but the transcriptional regulation of actin-binding proteins in nonmuscle cells has not been evaluated in detail. Notably, cells in mechanically stressed nonmuscle tissues such as bone and periodontium can maintain membrane integrity despite the application of high amplitude applied forces, indicating the existence of adaptive cytoprotective responses that may involve the cytoskeleton. For example, the recruitment of the actin-binding protein filamin A to sites of force transfer in fibroblasts was found to be cytoprotective, since it reduced the potentially lethal influx of calcium ions in response to applied force (5Glogauer M. Arora P. Chou D. Janmey P.A. Downey G.P. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1689-1698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). As filamin A interacts with the cytoplasmic domains of the β1 and β7integrins (6Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), it may also be able to transduce matrix-derived extracellular signals including those arising from mechanical forces. Currently, there is no evidence for force-induced regulation of filamin A expression in nonmuscle cells. Filamins are actin-binding proteins originally isolated from chicken gizzard (7Wang K. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) that organize actin filaments into orthogonal networks and enhance the rigidity of the actin cortex (8Cunningham C.C.

Stossel T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2122-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Three discrete filamins have been described, and alternative splicing may allow for several additional isoforms (10Calderwood D.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22607-22610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Filamin A (actin-binding protein 280) is composed of 23 ∼96-amino acid repeats with flexible hinges and actin binding domains (10Calderwood D.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

The biological importance of filamin A is underscored by evidence showing that the X-linked human disorder periventricular heterotopia is due to mutations at X-q28, theFLN1 locus (14Fox J.W. Lamperti E.D. Eksioglu Y.Z. Hong S.E. Feng Y. Graham D.A. Scheffer I.E. Dobyns W.B. Hirsch B.A. Radtke R.A. Berkovicz S.F. Huttenlocher P.R. Walsch C.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1315-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). This condition is characterized by defects in the migration of cerebral cortical neurons and vascular abnormalities that arise because of a lack of filamin-directed actin assembly and deficient rigidity of cell membranes. While originally described in the context of its ability to organize the actin cytoskeleton, filamin A is now known to interact with many cellular proteins and has multiple functions including its ability to direct the cytosolic sol-gel transitions necessary for lamellopodial extension and cell crawling (8Cunningham C.C.

With the use of the yeast two-hybrid system and other assays, filamin A has been shown to interact with cytoplasmic furin, tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor-2, the platelet von Willebrand factor receptor glycoprotein Ib-IX, the small GTPase RalA, the FcγR1 receptor, the integral membrane protein presenilin, and the β1 integrin (10Calderwood D.A.

Conceivably, the transmission of mechanical forces from matrix molecules to integrins and finally to filamin A and actin filaments may comprise a global mechanosensory and mechanoprotective signaling network for cells in mechanically active environments. In view of the dampening of calcium responses conferred by filamin A on cells exposed to high amplitude applied forces (5Glogauer M. Arora P. Chou D. Janmey P.A. Downey G.P. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1689-1698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), we determined if force could directly regulate filamin A gene expression in human gingival fibroblasts. These cells express low basal levels of filamin A but are periodically exposed to high amplitude forces in vivo. Therefore, they may be ideal candidates to assess force-induced induction of filamin A in cytoprotective responses. Our data show that mechanical forces applied through β1integrins regulate filamin A transcription and that inhibition of filamin A expression by microinjected antisense oligonucleotides increases force-induced cell death. These findings have implications for the design and choice of cells in bioengineered tissues that are designed to withstand high amplitude physical loads. Mouse anti-filamin A monoclonal antibody (clone MAB1680) was obtained from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Mouse anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (clone AC-15), anti-smooth muscle actin mAb1 (clone 1A4), anti-paxillin mAb (clone PXC-10), anti-talin mAb (clone 8d4), and anti-vinculin mAb (clone VIN-11-5) were all obtained from Sigma. Mouse anti-cortactin mAb (clone F411) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The anti-β1integrin mAb 4B4 was obtained from Beckman-Coulter and for blocking experiments was used at a dilution of 1:30 as described (22Arora P.D. Narani N. McCulloch C.A.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 871-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Actinomycin D, cycloheximide, cytochalasin D, poly-l-lysine, and recombinant fibronectin were all obtained from Sigma. Human gingival fibroblasts were derived from primary explant cultures as described (23Pender N.A.M. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 187-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells from passages 6–15 were grown as monolayer cultures in T-25 flasks (Falcon, Becton Dickinson, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Twenty-four hours prior to each experiment, cells were harvested and plated at 75% confluence. In experiments requiring transfection, Rat-2 fibroblasts were used as surrogates for gingival fibroblasts as described previously (24Hui M.Z. Tenenbaum H.C. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 172: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Prior to transfection, the cells were cultured in OPTI-MEM (Canadian Life Technologies, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) at 75% confluence and then transfected as described below. Force generation through integrins was produced using a previously described model system (25Glogauer M. Arora P.D. Yao G. Sokholov I. Ferrier J. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 11-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, magnetite microparticles (Fe3O4; Sigma) were incubated with purified collagen (Vitrogen 100; Cohesion Technologies, Palo Alto, CA; 1 mg/ml), fibronectin (Sigma; 100 µg/ml), or poly-l-lysine (Sigma; 1 mg/ml) or bovine serum albumin (Sigma; 1.3 mg/ml), rinsed with PBS, and incubated with fibroblasts. Following a 45-min incubation, excess nonadherent microparticles were removed by vigorous washing, and the cells were supplemented with fresh α-minimal essential medium. A ceramic permanent magnet (Jobmaster, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) was placed on top of the dish to generate a perpendicular mechanical force of ∼0.48 piconewtons/µm2 cell area, a force that is comparable with that which may be experienced by cells in vivo during normal function (5Glogauer M. Arora P. Chou D. Janmey P.A. Downey G.P. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1689-1698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The incubation times were specific for each individual experiment as indicated. RNA isolation was performed using a modified guanidium thiocyanate procedure (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were trypsinized and collected by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and resuspended in 1 ml of solution D (4 m guanidium thiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0, 0.5% sarcosyl, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Total RNA was purified by phenol/water extraction and isopropyl alcohol precipitation. All RNA preparations were treated with RQ1 DNase (Promega) for 30 min. The RT-PCR protocol was performed as described in detail elsewhere (27D'Addario M. Ahmad A. Xu J.W. Menezes J. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). RT was conducted on total RNA (1 µg) using 5 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Canadian Life Technologies) and 10 pmol of oligo(dT) primer. The cDNA product was subjected to 30 cycles of amplification in a PTC 100 MJ Research Minicycler (Watertown, MA). PCR-amplified products were resolved via agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to nylon membranes, and validated by probing with32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide probes designed to detect filamin A mRNA. Quantification of PCR products was performed using the Ofoto 1 system (Light Source Computer Images, Ferguson, MO) and IP Lab Gel (Signal Analytics, Vienna, VA). The density of individual lanes was normalized with the density of the PCR-amplified housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Sequences of the oligonucleotides used in the RT-PCR analysis were as follows: filamin A forward primer, 5′-GAGTTCACTGTGGAGACCAGAAGT-3′; filamin A reverse primer, 5′-CTGTGACTTATCCACGTACACCTC-3′; filamin B forward primer, 5′-AAGATAAATTGCAGAGACAACAAG-3′; filamin B reverse primer, 5′-TCATCAGCATATTTAACTGGACCA-3′; filamin C forward primer, 5′-CACAGAACTAGACACTACAAACACC-3′; filamin C reverse primer, 5′-TTCCTTTCCAAGTCCTTAAAACTC-3′; GAPDH forward primer, 5′-CCATGGAGAAGGCTGGGG-3′; GAPDH reverse primer, 5′-CAAAGTTGTCATGGAGCC-3′. The semiquantitative nature of our RT-PCR protocol, the precautions taken to avoid spurious reaction products, and the controls used have been described previously (28D'Addario M. Ahmad A. Morgan A. Menezes J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 765-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In each experiment, a non-RT control was used to demonstrate the lack of DNA contamination. Messenger RNA was isolated from untreated or force-treated fibroblasts at the times indicated in Fig. 1using an mRNA isolation kit (Oligotex mRNA Kit, Qiagen, Mississauga, ON). Samples of mRNA (20 µg each) were electrophoresed through a 1.0% agarose formaldehyde gel, transferred onto a nylon membrane by capillary blot, and cross-linked as described above for the transfer of PCR products. Prehybridization and hybridization were performed as previously described (28D'Addario M. Ahmad A. Morgan A. Menezes J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 765-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) using the filamin A and GAPDH oligonucleotides described above. The filters were washed using conventional protocols and exposed for standardized lengths of time to permit comparisons between experiments. Human gingival fibroblasts were grown and treated as described above. Following cell treatments, cells were lysed, and cellular proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8%) and transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schuell) as previously described (5Glogauer M. Arora P. Chou D. Janmey P.A. Downey G.P. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1689-1698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations in individual samples were analyzed by the Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. Equal amounts of protein were loaded on individual lanes, and nitrocellulose membranes were analyzed as described previously (5Glogauer M. Arora P. Chou D. Janmey P.A. Downey G.P. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1689-1698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Chemiluminescent detection was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The radiographic films were exposed for standardized lengths of time using conventional protocols. To generate the 3224-bp filamin A luciferase promoter construct, we isolated intact fibroblast genomic DNA using the protocol of Goelz et al. (29Goelz S.E. Hamilton S.R. Vogelstein B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 118-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole cell lysates were treated for 48 h at 50 °C with proteinase K in buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 25 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K). Following verification of intact DNA on a 1% agarose gel, 320 ng of DNA was incubated with PCR buffer containing oligonucleotide A1 (5′-GTCGCTCTCAGGAACAGCAGGTGAGGT-3′) and oligonucleotide B1 (5′-GGAGCTACTCATTTTGAGGCGCGAGAA-3′). The PCR was performed in an MJ Research PTC 100 Minicycler using 150 nm each of oligonucleotides A and B, 5% (v/v) Me2SO, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 µm each dNTP, and 1 unit of Expand High Fidelity PCR Enzyme System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The thermocycling procedure involved an initial 5-min incubation at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 0.5 min at 94 °C, 0.5 min at 64.5 °C, and 3 min at 68 °C with a final extension at 68 °C for 7 min. The amplified fragment was used to generate a nested PCR product that contained BglII andHindIII restriction sites for directional cloning into the pGL2 basic vector (Promega). The nested PCR product used the same components with the substitution of nested oligonucleotide A2 (5′-CGCTCTCAGGAACAGCAGGTGAGATCT-3′) and B2 (5′-GCTGAAGCTTCGGCGAGGGGACGGCCCTTT-3′). The correctly amplified product was verified through diagnostic restriction enzyme cleavage and ligated into the pGL2 basic vector between HindIII andBglII, and the correct orientation of the insert was verified through diagnostic restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing performed at the DNA Sequencing Facility, Center for Applied Genomics (Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Transfection of Rat-2 fibroblasts was achieved with LipofectAMINE-2000 (Canadian Life Technologies). Briefly, Rat-2 cells were grown in 35-mm dishes, and 2 µg of Qiagen-prepared vectors (pL2luc Basic-negative control; pGL2luc Control-positive control; and pGL2fil-Aluc) were transfected according to the manufacturer's instructions. The luciferase assay was used for estimation of force-induced transcriptional activation and has been described previously (30Lew A. Glogauer M. McCulloch C.A.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The experiments were repeated on four independent sets of cells. We used Rat2 cells as surrogates for the human gingival fibroblasts, because previous data indicated that Rat2 cells were phenotypically similar to human gingival fibroblasts (24Hui M.Z. Tenenbaum H.C. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 172: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and, unlike human fibroblasts, can be readily transfected (30Lew A. Glogauer M. McCulloch C.A.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) for analysis of mass cultures. To generate the promoter mutants listed in Fig. 6, B and C, the 3224-bp wild type filamin A promoter construct was digested with the following enzymes. XhoI-XhoI digestion removed 549 bp of the upstream promoter; XhoI-NcoI digestion removed 607 bp of the upstream promoter;SacI-SacI digestion removed 1305 bp of the upstream promoter; KpnI-KpnI digestion removed 1913 of the upstream promoter; SmaI-SmaI digestion removed 2922 bp of the upstream promoter; andXhoI-PstI digestion removed all but 75 bp of the filamin promoter. To fabricate the final 75-bp promoter construct containing mutations at the Sp1 binding sites, two complementary oligonucleotides (described below) were boiled independently and allowed to slowly cool to room temperature in equimolar amounts. Promoter scanning was used to determine the location of potentially important transcription factor binding sites (31Prestridge D.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The Sp1 mutations are indicated in boldface lettering: (−75; 5′-TGCAGCATTCGCAGAGACTGCAATTCTCGCGCCTCAAAATGAGTAGCTCCCACTCTTTGCCGAGAC-AGAGCGCAGCAGG-3′). The hybridized oligonucleotides were ligated into the pGL2 basic luciferase vector (Promega), and the correctly ligated vector was verified through restriction enzyme digestion. Human gingival fibroblasts were grown on 10-mm glass coverslips, incubated with collagen-coated microbeads, and subjected to magnetic force application as described above. Samples were collected at standardized time points and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde (in PBS) for 15 min followed by permeabilization in 0.3% Triton X-100 (in PBS). Samples were stained with mouse monoclonal anti-human filamin A followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Sigma). Optical sections of filamin fluorescence associated with labeled cells were assessed by confocal microscopy (CLSM, Leica, Heidelberg, Germany) or by conventional immunofluorescence microscopy. In some experiments that examined the relationship of filamin A content to the cell cycle, cells were immunostained in suspension, counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and analyzed by two-parameter flow cytometry. Antisense oligonucleotides complementary to the filamin A gene and irrelevant control phosphorothioated oligonucleotides were synthesized on a 2-µmol scale (MWG Biotech, High Point, NC). The antisense oligonucleotide corresponded to positions +15 to +35 (5′-ttc CCG GGC GGG CTC TCg tg-3′), and the irrelevant oligonucleotide contained the sequence 5′-aag GGC CCG CCC GAG Agc ag-3′ (lowercase base nomenclature describes phosphorothioated bases). Both oligonucleotides were generated according to previously described standards. Fibroblasts for microinjection were subcultured on 1-cm glass coverslips and microinjected with ∼1–4 µl of phosphorothioated oligonucleotides into the cytoplasm at 5 mg/ml in PBS buffer containing Hoescht 33342 to mark the nuclei of microinjected cells. Needles for microinjection were prepared from glass capillaries (Harvard Apparatus, Kent, UK) and pulled on a micropipette puller (Brown-Flaming, Sutter Instruments Co., San Francisco, CA). Following microinjection, cells were incubated with collagen-coated beads as described above and subjected or not subjected to force. Dead cells were evaluated by propidium iodide (10 µg/ml) staining and fluorescence microscopy. The levels and distributions of filamin A were evaluated by immunostaining as described above followed by image analysis. In each assay (n = 6 separate experiments), 60–100 cells were microinjected. For continuous variable data, means and S.E. values of the means were computed. Unpaired Student'st tests were used for statistical testing, and significance was set at p < 0.05. We examined force-induced filamin A mRNA expression in human gingival fibroblasts by Northern analysis (Fig.1 A). There was a time-dependent increase in filamin A mRNA that was detected as early as 1 h following force application through collagen beads. Densitometric analysis of the blots showed a 5–7-fold increase in filamin A mRNA following collagen-mediated force induction in the first 4 h of treatment. To determine if the RT-PCR protocol yielded similar results as the Northern blot analysis, 1 µg of total RNA was isolated from cells at different time points following the application of force. A representative Southern blot (Fig. 1 A) showed a time-dependent induction of filamin A; densitometric analysis yielded similar results as the Northern blot data (Fig. 1 A). To examine whether other filamin isoforms were expressed in these cells and activated by force application, RNA from untreated and force-treated cells was subjected to RT-PCR analysis for filamin isoforms B and C using the identical PCR conditions as for filamin A. There was no detectable product for filamin C and only a very low amount of filamin B that was not specifically enhanced by force application (data not shown). We determined if force would enhance filamin A expression by analyzing protein content in Western blots and found a ∼3–4-fold increase in total filamin A protein following 8 h of magnetic force (Fig.1 B; p < 0.05). These increases were significant when compared with samples analyzed for other cytoskeletal proteins including α-smooth muscle actin, cortactin, paxillin, talin, vinculin, and β1 integrin, none of which showed induction by force (Fig. 1 B). We assayed filamin A expression at the integrin-microbead locus by immunofluorescence. The results shown in Fig. 1 C demonstrate diffuse staining of filamin A in untreated cells (Fig. 1 C, b), but in cells subjected to force, there was an increased immunofluorescence signal for filamin A at the integrin-microbead locus (Fig. 1 C,d). We also examined if filamin A levels may be dependent on the cell cycle. Using two-parameter flow cytometry, cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle showed filamin A immunofluorescence that was significantly less than cells in the S phase (G1 phase = 28.5 ± 2 fluorescence units; S phase = 36.4 ± 2 fluorescence units; p < 0.05). In a separate experiment to assess the dependence of force-induced filamin A expression on proliferative status, cells in subconfluent cultures (percentage of S phase cells = 12%) and cells in highly confluent cultures (percentage of S phase cells = 3%) were examined. We found by immunoblotting that cells in both conditions exhibited ∼3-fold increases of filamin A content after force application (data not shown). Collectively these results demonstrated that filamin A expression was augmented by mechanical force applied through collagen-coated magnetite microbeads. We performed experiments to assess if force activation of filamin A was mediated through β1integrins. Previous studies have shown that poly-l-lysine and BSA beads do not attach to cells appreciably through integrins, while collagen and fibronectin specifically bind through the β1 integrins (5Glogauer M. Arora P. Chou D. Janmey P.A. Downey G.P. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1689-1698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Microbeads were coated with fibronectin, poly-l-lysine, or BSA and incubated with cells, and then force was applied to cells. While there was no detectable difference in filamin A expression following force application through poly-l-lysine or BSA-coated beads (Fig.2, A and B), fibronectin-coated beads increased filamin A RNA and protein by 3–4-fold, a similar effect as seen with collagen beads. This result was not due to loss of beads"
https://openalex.org/W2328982351,"Fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF-8) is a secreted heparin-binding protein, which has transforming potential. Alternative splicing of the mouse Fgf-8 gene potentially codes for eight protein isoforms (a-h) which differ in their transforming capacity in transfected cells. S115 mouse mammary tumor cells express a transformed phenotype and secrete FGF-8 in an androgen-dependent manner. In order to study the role of FGF-8 isoforms in the induction of transformed phenotype of breast cancer cells, we over-expressed FGF-8 isoforms a, b and e in S115 cells. Over-expression of FGF-8b, but not FGF-8a or FGF-8e, induced androgen and anchorage independent growth of S115 cells. FGF-8b-transfected S115 cells formed rapidly growing tumors with increased vascularization when injected s.c. into nude mice. FGF-8a also slightly increased tumor growth and probably tumor vascularization but FGF-8e was not found to have any effects. The angiogenic activity of FGF-8b and heparin-binding growth factor fraction (HBGF) of S115 cell conditioned media was tested in in vitro and in vivo models for angiogenesis using immortomouse brain capillary endothelial cells (IBEC) and chorion allantoic membrane (CAM) assays. Recombinant FGF-8b protein was able to stimulate proliferation, migration, and vessel-like tube formation of IBECs. In addition, stimulatory effect of S115-HBGF on IBE cell proliferation was evident. A positive angiogenic response to FGF-8b was also seen in CAM assay. The results demonstrate that the expression of Fgf-8b is able to promote vessel formation. Angiogenic capacity probably markedly contributes to the ability of FGF-8b to increase tumor growth of androgen-regulated S115 mouse breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1970893153,"Nitric oxide is a signaling molecule in intercellular communication as well as a powerful weapon used by macrophages to kill tumor cells and pathogenic bacteria. Here, we show that when Escherichia coli cells are exposed to nitric oxide, its ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster is nitrosylated, forming the dinitrosyl iron complex with a characteristic EPR signal at g(av) = 2.04. Such formed ferredoxin dinitrosyl iron complex is efficiently repaired in E. coli cells even in the absence of new protein synthesis. However, the repair activity is completely inactivated once E. coli cells are disrupted, indicating that repairing the ferredoxin dinitrosyl iron complex requires cellular reducing equivalents. In search of such cellular factors, we find that l-cysteine can effectively eliminate the EPR signal of the ferredoxin dinitrosyl iron complex and release the ferrous iron from the complex. In contrast, N-acetyl-l-cysteine and reduced glutathione are much less effective. l-Cysteine seems to have a general function, since it can also remove the otherwise stable dinitrosyl iron complexes from proteins in the cell extracts prepared from the E. coli cells treated with nitric oxide. We propose that l-cysteine is responsible for removing the dinitrosyl iron complexes from the nitric oxide-modified proteins into which a new iron-sulfur cluster will be reassembled."

https://openalex.org/W2036605729,"We have previously demonstrated that basal AP-1 transcriptional activity is high in normal human mammary epithelial cells, intermediate in immortal breast cells, and relatively low in breast cancer cells. In this study we investigated whether differences in AP-1 transcriptional activity reflect differences in breast cells' dependence on AP-1 for proliferation. The cJun dominant negative, TAM-67, was used to determine the effect of AP-1 blockade on the growth of normal, immortal and malignant breast cells. We first showed that TAM-67 inhibits AP-1 activity in normal and malignant breast cells. We then determined whether this AP-1 inhibitor affected colony forming efficiency of the immortalized and malignant breast cells. The AP-1 inhibitor reduced colony formation of immortal breast cells by over 50% (by 58% in 184B5 cells and 62% in MCF10A cells), and reduced colony formation in the breast cancer cell line MCF7 by 43%, but did not reduce colony formation in the other breast cancer cell lines (T47D, MDA MB231 and MDA MB 435). We also determined the effect of AP-1 blockade on the growth of normal breast cells using a single cell proliferation assay. Using this assay, the growth of normal breast cells was extremely sensitive to AP-1 blockade, while immortal breast cells were moderately sensitive. We next directly tested the effect of TAM-67 expression on the growth of MCF7 breast cancer cells, using cells stably transfected with TAM-67 under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter. Upon induction, TAM-67 was expressed and AP-1 activity was inhibited in these cells. We then measured the growth of these cells in the presence or absence of TAM-67. The results of these studies show that the growth of MCF7 cells was suppressed by the AP-1 inhibitor, TAM-67. These results demonstrate that normal and immortalized breast cells, and some breast cancer cells (such as MCF7), require AP-1 to transduce proliferative signals, while other breast cancer cells (such as T47D, MDA MB 231 and MDA MB 435) do not. These studies suggest that the AP-1 transcription factor is a potential target for future agents for the prevention or treatment of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1571638637,"Cell surface integrins can adopt distinct conformations in response to ligand binding and intracellular signals. Several integrins including αvβ3 can bind to multiple ligands. The binding of αvβ3 to fibronectin and vitronectin was used as a model to determine whether the same or distinct forms of the receptor were utilized in strong binding to the two different ligands. A spinning-disc device was used to measure the relative strength of the αvβ3-ligand bonds. The initial binding reaction for both ligands occurred in the absence of metabolic energy and resulted in a strong adhesion to fibronectin but a weak adhesion to vitronectin. Increases in the strength of the αvβ3-vitronectin bond required phosphorylation of the β3 cytoplasmic domain, intracellular signals, and the binding of cytoskeletal proteins to cytoplasmic domains of β3 controlled by Tyr-747 and Tyr-759. In contrast, αvβ3-mediated adhesion to fibronectin was unaffected by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, mutations of Tyr-747 and Tyr-759 to phenylalanine, or availability of metabolic energy. This suggests that strong adhesion to fibronectin used the initial binding conformation, whereas strong binding to vitronectin required signaling-induced changes in the conformation of αvβ3.

Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9025) Google Scholar). Many integrins appear to have a single ligand, usually fibronectin or laminin, but a significant group of integrins bind to multiple ligands (2Sonnenberg A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1993; 184: 7-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). αVβ3, originally described as the vitronectin receptor, is one of the most promiscuous integrins. It binds to a variety of plasma and extracellular matrix proteins including vitronectin, fibrinogen, fibronectin, von Willebrand's factor, thrombospondin, osteopontin and bone sialic protein 1 (2Sonnenberg A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1993; 184: 7-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 3Denis C. Williams J.A. Lu X. Meyer D. Baruch D.

It has also been reported to serve as a receptor for adenovirus, foot and mouth disease virus, coxsackievirus A9, and hantaviruses (5Neff S. Sa-Carvalho D. Rieder E. Mason P.W. Blystone S.D.

It binds to tat (a regulatory protein from HIV), fibroblast growth factor 2 and a fragment from the disintegrin ADAM-15, suggesting roles in the control of soluble factors as well (8Barillari G. Sgadari C. Fiorelli V. Samaniego F. Colombini S. Manzari V. Modesti A. Nair B.C. Cafaro A. Sturzl M. Ensoli B. Blood. 1999; 94: 663-672PubMed Google Scholar, 9Nath D. Slocombe P.M. Stephens P.E.

Some of these interactions are with pathogen-encoded proteins in which the binding has evolved as a function of the pathogen and may use unique binding sites on αvβ3. Most of these protein ligands encode an RGD sequence that is presumed to represent the binding site for αvβ3. It is possible that this minimal motif reproduced in each of these ligands possesses sufficient structural homology to serve as interchangeable binding domains for αvβ3. Peptide chemistry has been used to generate a variety of RGD mimetics by placing the RGD in different contexts and constraining its conformation with cross-linkers (11Dechantsreiter M.A. Planker E.

These peptides show large differences in their affinity for αvβ3. Given these differences in binding to RGD domains of different conformations, the range of ligands for αvβ3 is even more remarkable. One important property that seems common to most integrins is the ability of intracellular signals to regulate their binding functions (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9025) Google Scholar, 15Calderwood D.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22607-22610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). This process has been called “inside-out” signaling and can result in a change in the conformation of the extracellular domain of the integrin as determined by the binding of conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies or biophysical methods like fluorescence resonance energy transfer (16Frelinger A.L. Du X.P. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17106-17111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sims P.J. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7345-7352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, direct analysis of the strength of the αvβ3-vitronectin bond has identified four different levels of binding strength (affinity) between αvβ3 and vitronectin (18Boettiger D. Huber F. Lynch L. Blystone S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 12: 1227-1237Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, αvβ3 can assume two and probably more distinct conformations of the extracellular domain that would affect the ligand binding properties directly. Given the array of ligands, it would seem reasonable that different ligands might bind to different forms of the receptor. “Activated” αvβ3 for one ligand could be an “inactive” αvβ3 for another ligand. Because of the link between integrin binding and integrin signaling, this scenario has consequences for integrin-mediated signals that control basic cellular processes (19Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). If different conformations of the receptor constitute the active strong-binding receptor on different ligands, this is likely to induce different effects in the cytoplasmic domains of the bound receptors and hence provide different possibilities for binding of the integrin cytoplasmic domains to cytoskeletal and signaling proteins. The Kαvβ3, Kαvβ3(Y747F), and Kαvβ3(Y759F) cells were derived from K562 cells by transfection with both αv and β3or β3 mutant integrins as described previously (20Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.E. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28757-28761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The K562-derived cells were adapted to growth as nonadherent cells in serum-free K562 medium (cytoSF4 from Kemp Biotechnologies, Frederick, MD) and maintained either in this medium or in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum. The AIIB2 (anti-human β1 integrin) monoclonal antibody was a gift from C. Damsky (University of California at San Francisco). LM609 (anti-human β3 integrin) was obtained from Chemicon. Secondary antibodies for fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch. Fibronectin was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Vitronectin was purified from human plasma by the method described in Ref. 21Yatohga T. Masako I. Heiachiro K. Hayashi M. Cell Struct. Funct. 1988; 13: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar. The spinning-disc device and the method have been described in detail and validated (22Garcia A.J. Ducheyne P. Boettiger D. Biomaterials. 1997; 18: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 23Garcia A.J. Huber F. Boettiger D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10988-10993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Briefly, suspensions containing 2 × 105 cells were washed and resuspended in adhesion buffer (24 mm HEPES, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm glucose, pH 7.4). The cells were counted and diluted, and PMA1 (20 nm final concentration) was added as required. The cells were plated on 25-mm round coated coverslips mounted on the spinning-disc device in a total volume of 400 µl. After a 15-min incubation, the chamber of the spinning-disc device was filled with adhesion buffer, and the cells were spun for 5 min. After spinning, the coverslips were fixed with formalin, permeabilized with Triton X-100, and stained with ethidium homodimer (Molecular Probes). The coverslips were analyzed by counting the number of cells in 61 microscope fields (12% of the surface area) using a Nikon Optiphot fluorescent microscope with an ×10 fluor objective, Ludl XYZ stage, and Ludl filter wheel/shutter driven by ScopePro V1.0 software and a Photometrics SenSys cooled charge-coupled device camera and analyzed by Image-Pro V3.0 software. The data analysis, curve fits, and statistical calculations were made using SigmaPlot v5.0. For experiments in which the cells were cross-linked before spinning, sulfo-BSOCOES (bis[2-(succinimidooxycarbonyloxy)ethyl]sulfone, Pierce) was added to a final concentration of 4 mm after a 10-min adsorption period and incubated for 5 min before spinning. Note that there is variation in the potency of different lots of fibronectin as measured in terms of the adhesion strength produced under standard conditions for which we use TS 2/16 monoclonal antibody-activated α5β1 on K562 cells. Kαvβ3, Kαvβ3(Y747F), and Kαvβ3(Y759F) cells were incubated for 2 h in the presence of 75 µm sodium orthovanadate either in suspension or on vitronectin with or without PMA (20 nm). The cells were extracted with PBS buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, sodium orthovanadate (2 mm), aprotinin (10 µg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (350 µg/ml), and leupeptin (10 µg/ml). The lysates were precleared overnight with gelatin-Sepharose and immunoprecipitated with PM6/13 anti-β3 monoclonal antibody (Chemicon) and goat anti-mouse IgG beads (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA). Samples were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis transferred to nitrocellulose and blotted with 4G10 (UBI, Lake Placid, NY) for phosphotryrosine or rabbit polyclonal antibody to β3cytoplasmic domain (Chemicon AB1932) developed with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and analyzed with a Fuji LAS-1000 using ScienceLab 2.5 software. To develop a model for the analysis of αvβ3-mediated adhesion, K652 cells were stably transformed with vectors expressing αv and β3 or mutants of β3 integrin (24Blystone S.D. Lindberg F.P. Williams M.P. McHugh K.P. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (E. J.): 31458-31462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These cells express α5β1 integrin in an inactive form and αvβ3. The adhesion of these cells to fibronectin was analyzed using the spinning-disc device (22Garcia A.J. Ducheyne P. Boettiger D. Biomaterials. 1997; 18: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This device subjects cells to a hydrodynamic shear gradient that detaches the cells from the substrate. Fig.1A shows a typical profile of the proportion of cells remaining as a function of increasing shear stress for Kαvβ3 cells (K562 cells expressing wild-type αvβ3) plated for 15 min on a fibronectin substrate. The addition of the monoclonal antibody LM609 to block αvβ3-mediated adhesion produced a leftward shift in the force-detachment profile (Fig.1 B). From the sigmoid curve fits for each of these plots, a mean cell detachment shear stress can be calculated (τ50). This mean cell detachment stress will be called the “adhesion strength” for the particular cell population and experimental conditions. Fig. 1 C shows that the adhesion strength of Kαvβ3 cells to fibronectin was reduced to background levels similar to a BSA substrate by LM609 but was not affected by AIIB2, which blocks β1-mediated adhesion. LM609 had a similar adhesion-blocking effect for both the Y747F and the Y759F mutants as well as PMA-activated Kαvβ3 cells to fibronectin (data not shown). Finally, α5β1expressed on K562 cells has only been functionally activated in the presence of Mn2+ or activating antibodies even in the cases in which cross-talk between αvβ3 and α5β1 has been demonstrated. Thus, the adhesion of the Kαvβ3 cells to fibronectin was mediated only by αvβ3. To provide a basis for quantitative comparison of αvβ3-fibronectin bond strengths, we determined the relationship between detachment force and the number of receptor-ligand bonds (23Garcia A.J. Huber F. Boettiger D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10988-10993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The number of αvβ3-fibronectin bonds was varied by varying the density of the substrate-adsorbed fibronectin. Fig.1 D shows that there was a linear relationship between fibronectin density and adhesion strength. A similar linear relationship has been reported for antibody-activated α5β1-mediated adhesion to fibronectin, endogenously activated α5β1 to fibronectin, and for endogenously activated αvβ3 to vitronectin (18Boettiger D. Huber F. Lynch L. Blystone S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 12: 1227-1237Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 23Garcia A.J. Huber F. Boettiger D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 34710-34715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The slope of this plot is determined by the product of the receptor density and the “binding strength constant.” The binding strength constant is a measure of the strength of the integrin-ligand bond and is analogous to the measurement of K D used in diffusion-based analysis of receptor-ligand bonds. Using force to measure bond strength is based on the proposition that the primary function of the integrin-ligand bond is adhesion of cells to other cells or to extracellular matrix and to resist mechanical force that would break this adhesion. K562 cells express about 1 × 105α5β1 receptor/cell (23Garcia A.J. Huber F. Boettiger D. J. Biol.

Maximal adhesion strength to fibronectin (160 ng/cm2) for TS2/16-activated K562 cells using α5β1 was 70 dynes/cm2, and for the Kαvβ3 cells using the αvβ3 receptors the adhesion strength to the same density of fibronectin was 90 dynes/cm2 (23Garcia A.J. Huber F. Boettiger D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10988-10993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). At this stage of investigation there is no accurate measure of the number of receptor-ligand bonds per cell. With this caveat, the data suggest that the strength of the αvβ3-fibronectin bond is similar to the α5β1-fibronectin bond or up to 2-fold stronger. The αvβ3-mediated adhesion of Kαvβ3 cells to a vitronectin substrate is a multistage process (18Boettiger D. Huber F. Lynch L. Blystone S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 12: 1227-1237Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The first stage involves a ligand-induced fit in which a change in the conformation of αvβ3 is induced by ligand binding, which results in the phosphorylation of Tyr-747, in the cytoplasmic domain of β3 and binding of the LIBS-1 antibody, which detects occupied forms of β3 integrins (16Frelinger A.L. Du X.P. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17106-17111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Boettiger D. Huber F. Lynch L. Blystone S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 12: 1227-1237Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although this initial αvβ3-vitronectin bond is specific, it is quite weak and has been missed using the common wash-type adhesion assays. Strong adhesion requires intracellular signals (20Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.E. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28757-28761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Fig. 2shows that this initial binding did not require metabolic energy. As positive controls, this treatment blocked the ability of PMA to induce increased adhesion to vitronectin and abolished the ability of IMR90 cells to activate any detectable α5β1 mediated to fibronectin. Thus, there is a measurable adhesion reaction between the Kαvβ3 cells and either a vitronectin or fibronectin substrate that is energy-independent and hence unlikely to involve intracellular signals or cytoskeletal rearrangements. A second aspect of the initial binding reaction between αvβ3 and vitronectin is that it sets up the intracellular signaling by inducing the phosphorylation of Tyr-747 in the cytoplasmic domain of β3. This was demonstrated by the addition of RGD peptides to Kαvβ3 cells in suspension that induced both the binding of LIBS-1 antibody and the phosphorylation of Tyr-747 in the cytoplasmic domain of β3 (20Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.E. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28757-28761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Fig. 3shows that a similar induction of β3 phosphorylation was observed when Kαvβ3 cells were plated on either vitronectin or fibronectin. Mutation of Tyr-747 to phenylalanine reduced the phosphorylation to baseline levels, whereas a reduced level of phosphorylation was observed for the Y759F mutant. This phosphorylation in response to ligand occupancy indicates that the initial outside-in signaling was similar for fibronectin and vitronectin. The only identified difference in the initial binding reaction was the strong binding to fibronectin as opposed to a weak binding to vitronectin Strong αvβ3-mediated adhesion to vitronectin in the Kαvβ3 model system requires the addition of either thrombin or PMA to provide a co-stimulatory signal and produce full activation of αvβ3 (20Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.E. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28757-28761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The effect of PMA stimulation on the adhesion strength of Kαvβ3 cells to vitronectin and fibronectin was analyzed using the spinning disc. Fig.4shows that the addition of PMA increased the strength of the αvβ3-mediated adhesion to vitronectin by 10-fold but had no effect on the strength of the αvβ3-mediated adhesion to fibronectin. Adhesion of PMA-stimulated Kαvβ3 cells to fibronectin was blocked by LM609 showing that the adhesion remained αvβ3-dependent. Although PMA-induced inside-out signals increased the strength of the αvβ3-vitronectin bonds, its signaling was either blocked by the substitution of fibronectin for vitronectin or it had no effect on the strength of the αvβ3-fibronectin bond. Y747F and Y759F mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of β3integrin reduces the strength of the αvβ3-mediated adhesion to vitronectin for both Kαvβ3 cells and CS-1 melanoma cells (18Boettiger D. Huber F. Lynch L. Blystone S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 12: 1227-1237Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the Kαvβ3 cells, these mutations seemed to control binding sites in the cytoplasmic domain of β3 that interacted with the intracellular signaling process to induce the increase in the strength of the αvβ3-vitronectin bond (18Boettiger D. Huber F. Lynch L. Blystone S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 12: 1227-1237Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of these mutations on the activation of αvβ3-mediated adhesion to vitronectin and fibronectin the relative receptor-ligand bond strengths for PMA-stimulated Kαvβ3, Kαvβ3(Y747F), and Kαvβ3(Y759F) cells were determined. The adhesion strength of each of these lines was determined for different ligand densities. So that the relative slopes would be proportional to differences in the strength of the αvβ3-ligand bonds, the plots for each of the mutant lines were normalized to the wild-type Kαvβ3 cells for surface expression of αvβ3 as measured by flow cytometry. Fig.5shows that the mutants dramatically decreased the binding strength of the αvβ3-vitronectin bond but had no significant effect on the binding strength of the αvβ3-fibronectin bond. The extracellular domains of integrins bind to their extracellular ligands. This receptor-ligand linkage is the mechanically weak link in the adhesion chain between the cell and the plastic or glass substrate (23Garcia A.J. Huber F. Boettiger D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10988-10993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The application of force using the spinning disc or washing the cells or centrifugation causes the weakest connection to break. All published adhesion assays rely on this application of force to separate cells from the ligand-coated substrate and on the receptor-ligand bond being the weakest link and hence the one which determines whether the cell is removed or not. The intracellular domain of integrin is linked to the cytoskeleton through a combination of linkers that may include talin, vinculin, and α-actinin (26Schoenwaelder S.M. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). To measure the relative strength of this mechanical link, cell-impermeant cross-linkers were used to strengthen the extracellular elements in the cell-to-substrate chain. Now the application of force to the cell can be used to measure the mechanical strength of the intracellular integrin-cytoskeleton connections, which are now the weakest link. In this assay, the normal adhesion strength was measured as shown above and compared with a “cross-linked adhesion strength.” If the αvβ3-fibronectin bond was the weakest link in the adhesion chain before cross-linking, there should be an increase in the measured force required for cell detachment after cross-linking (illustrated in Fig. 6,Control). After treatment with cytochalasin D to disassemble the actin filaments, the cross-linked adhesion strength was the same as the normal adhesion strength (Fig. 6, CD). In this case, it was not the αvβ3-fibronectin bond but the link between αvβ3 and the cytoskeleton that was the weak link that was broken by the application of force. In addition, the adhesion strength was reduced by cytochalasin D, in agreement with previous analyses (27Lotz M.M. Burdsal C.A. Erickson H.P. McClay D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1795-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). This reduction demonstrates that an intact cytoskeleton and its linkage to the ligand-bound integrin are structural requirements for strong cell adhesion. In the absence of this cytoskeletal connection, the application of force to the cell would result in the detachment of the integrin from the cell rather than the dissociation of the integrin-ligand bond. The interesting result comes from the experiment done in the presence of azide plus deoxyglucose (Fig. 6, azide/DOG). As shown above, treatment with azide plus deoxyglucose had no effect on the αvβ3-mediated adhesion strength on fibronectin. However, unlike the control, there was no difference between the normal adhesion strength and the cross-linked adhesion strength. This implies that the increased strength of the αvβ3-actin linkage in the control required metabolic energy. Also note that the adhesion strength of the azide plus deoxyglucose-treated cells was significantly higher than that for the cytochalasin D-treated cells. This implies that αvβ3 actin assembly was necessary for strong adhesion even in the metabolically blocked cells. These data demonstrate that there are two distinct binding modes for αvβ3 integrin. The first mode is represented by the binding of αvβ3 to vitronectin. This binding is more typical of what is expected for integrins; strong adhesion depends on intracellular signals to activate the binding process. The second mode is represented by the binding of αvβ3 to fibronectin. This binding seems to be independent of intracellular signals or integrin activation. Activation-independent integrin-mediated adhesion has not been described previously, but this possibility has not been explored extensively. Most integrin-mediated adhesion that has been analyzedin vitro requires metabolic energy (25Garcia A.J. Takagi J. Boettiger D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34710-34715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 28Faull R.J. Kovach N.L. Harlan J.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Energy in the form of ATP is required for kinase activity and cytoskeletal assembly. Depletion of the ATP levels with a combination of azide plus deoxyglucose would alter the kinetics of these processes and reduce the rates at which they occur. This treatment also is sufficient to block integrin activation in several cell types including the Kαvβ3 cells used for these studies. Azide plus deoxyglucose treatment has been used in this report to separate the passive signaling-independent phase of integrin binding from the active signaling-dependent phase of integrin binding (25Garcia A.J. Takagi J. Boettiger D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34710-34715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). 2D. Boettiger, unpublished data. The Kαvβ3 cell system also provides a parallel validation of this rationale. Activation of αvβ3-vitronectin binding depends on the addition of the co-stimulatory factors thrombin or PMA (24Blystone S.D. Lindberg F.P. Williams M.P. McHugh K.P. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (E. J.): 31458-31462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This provides a means of controlling the activation process experimentally. Also, the Y747F mutation in the cytoplasmic domain of β3blocks this activation process even in the presence of PMA (20Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.E. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28757-28761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Adhesion to vitronectin in the absence of co-stimulatory signals or in cells bearing the Y747F mutation gave the same low adhesion strength observed in the presence of azide plus deoxyglucose. Thus, the form of αvβ3 involved in the low strength binding to vitronectin and the high strength binding seem similar. The consequence of this is that the activation process is ligand-specific,i.e. activation of integrin for one ligand does not necessarily activate its binding to alternative ligands. This helps to limit the total number of integrin conformations required to accommodate the binding to multiple ligands and the regulation of binding activity. The binding strength observed in the presence of azide plus deoxyglucose is likely to represent the cell-independent binding of the αvβ3 to its ligand, which is also observed using purified αvβ3 to bind to purified ligand (29Charo I.F. Nannizzi L. Smith J.W. Cheresh D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2795-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Many analyses using purified integrin receptors and purified ligand demonstrate the ability of integrins to bind ligand in the absence of other cellular components or signals. In the case of αvβ3 binding to vitronectin, the strength of the interaction was not sufficient to mediate strong substrate adhesion and extra-sensitive adhesion assays were necessary to detect this adhesion (18Boettiger D. Huber F. Lynch L. Blystone S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 12: 1227-1237Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 20Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.E. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28757-28761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In contrast, αvβ3binding to fibronectin was able to mediate strong adhesion under the same conditions, implying that this interaction has increased its ability to withstand mechanical force. This state for αvβ3 seems to be an intrinsic property of the receptor. Within the cell, this intrinsic binding is modulated by intracellular signals and attachment of integrin to the cytoskeleton. This is observed for αvβ3 binding to vitronectin in which metabolic energy, phosphorylation, assembled actin, and tyrosines at positions at 747 and 759 in the cytoplasmic domain of β3 were required to produce strong adhesion. This arm of the process is cell-dependent and hence likely to be also cell type-dependent. Although the experiments described here show only the ability of these cellular processes to increase the integrin-ligand bond strength, it is possible that cellular processes can decrease the integrin-ligand bond strength. This is seen for αiibβ3, which can bind fibrinogen as a purified molecule but seems to be restrained by the actin cytoskeleton from binding fibrinogen in nonstimulated platelets (30Bennett J.S. Zigmond S. Vilaire G. Cunningham M.E. Bednar B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25301-25307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The interpretation of the data relies on an understanding of the analytic methods and the specificity of these analyses. The “bond strength” is directly related to the initial slope of the adhesion strength (mean cell detachment force) plotted as a function of ligand density. These plots followed the expected relationship for bimolecular binding with an initial linear rise to a plateau. The plateau was achieved only in the case of the αvβ3-vitronectin bond, because limitations in fibronectin coating do not allow it to reach saturation levels. For analysis of the differences between αvβ3-fibronectin and αvβ3-vitronectin bonds and the effects of mutants or PMA stimulation, the data compare relative bond strengths. The linearity of the data for the binding of αvβ3 to fibronectin argues against both inhomogeneities in the fibronectin coating and cooperative binding. Because the Kαvβ3 cells express both αvβ3 and α5β1 as potential fibronectin receptors, it is important to distinguish between the adhesion mediated by each receptor. In the experiments described, we believe that the α5β1 integrin is inactive and does not contribute for several reasons: (a) specific antibodies to αvβ3 reduced the adhesion of the Kαvβ3 (and β3 mutant) cells to fibronectin to the same level as BSA; (b) antibodies to β1 integrin had no effect even on the PMA-stimulated cells; and (c) although α5β1 on these cells can be passively activated by either Mn2+ or activating monoclonal antibodies (28Faull R.J. Kovach N.L. Harlan J.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), there are no other known mechanisms of activation, and these elements are not used for this report. Cross-talk between αvβ3 and α5β1 has been described in these cells, but the assays of cell adhesion, cell migration, and α5β1-mediated phagocytosis described require the addition of Mn2+ (31Blystone S.D. Slater S.E. Williams M.P. Crow M.T. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 32Blystone S.D. Lindberg F.P. LaFlamme S.E. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In those studies the presence of the β3 cytoplasmic domain suppressed (not activated) α5β1 function. Extensive analysis of cytoplasmic domain mutants of β3has lead to the conclusion that this domain is critical for the regulation of ligand binding (33Hughes P.E. O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12411-12417Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 34O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Culley B.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12623-12632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This has been extended using the spinning-disc analysis showing that Tyr-747 and Tyr-759 make specific quantitative contributions to the αvβ3 bond strength (18Boettiger D. Huber F. Lynch L. Blystone S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 12: 1227-1237Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The role of the cytoplasmic domain in the regulation of ligand binding and bond strength is consistent with models in which integrin function is controlled through links between integrin and the cytoskeleton (26Schoenwaelder S.M. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 36Horwitz A.F. Duggan K. Buck C.A. Beckerle M.C. Burridge K. Nature. 1986; 320: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Experiments in which fibronectin-coated beads were placed on cells demonstrated that α5β1on the cell surface bound fibronectin on the beads and that the α5β1-fibronectin complexes became linked to the cytoskeleton and were transported toward the nuclear region, as visualized by analysis of the movement of the beads. Using a laser trap to restrain bead movement demonstrated that this application of force produced a strengthening of the bead-cytoskeleton linkage and a progressive increase in the force necessary to restrain the movement of the bead (37Choquet D. Felsenfield D.P. Sheetz M.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 39-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). This was interpreted in terms of the increase in the α5β1-cytoskeletal linkage. However, if the weakest link in the connection from the bead to the fibronectin to α5β1 integrin to cytoskeleton were the α5β1-fibronectin link, as required by the adhesion assays, then strengthening the α5β1-cytoskeletal link alone without also increasing the α5β1-fibronectin bond would not lead to the observed strengthening of the whole chain. This suggests that mechanical tension increased the integrin-ligand bond strength as well. The experiments with the spinning disc are analogous to the laser trap results except that the force is applied to the cell containing the receptor rather than the bead containing the ligand. We have advanced the analysis one step further by developing a means to distinguish between the receptor-ligand and the receptor-cytoskeletal linkages. This is done through the use of cell-impermeant chemical cross-linkers that can cross-link integrins and their ligands (18Boettiger D. Huber F. Lynch L. Blystone S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 12: 1227-1237Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 38Enomoto-Iwamoto M. Menko A.S. Philp N. Boettiger D. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1993; 1: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar,39Garcia A.J. Boettiger D. Biomaterials. 1999; 20: 2427-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Because this strengthens the weak link, we can distinguish changes in the strength of the receptor-ligand bond from the receptor-cytoskeleton linkage. For a range of αvβ3-vitronectin bond strengths, the strength of the αvβ3-cytoskeleton link remains approximately twice the αvβ3-fibronectin bond strength (18Boettiger D. Huber F. Lynch L. Blystone S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 12: 1227-1237Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). On a fibronectin substrate, the αvβ3-cytoskeleton linkage was also about twice the αvβ3-fibronectin bond strength, in agreement with other integrin-ligand pairs. In contrast, for ATP-depleted cells plated on fibronectin, both the αvβ3-fibronectin and the αvβ3-cytoskeleton links were similar in strength, indicating that the increase in strength of the cytoskeletal connection was energy-dependent. Thus, this recapitulates the laser trap experiments and reinforces the hypothesis that integrin-ligand bond strength is controlled through connections between integrin and the cytoskeleton (26Schoenwaelder S.M. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). This leads to a model in which αvβ3 binds to fibronectin and produces a strong initial bond that does not alter the pre-existing αvβ3-cytoskeletal connections and does not respond to intracellular signals that strengthen this linkage. In contrast, the binding of αvβ3 to vitronectin induces a rearrangement of the cytoskeleton, resulting in an initial detachment of αvβ3 from the cytoskeleton leaving a bond strength similar to what has been observed after the treatment with cytochalasin D (23Garcia A.J. Huber F. Boettiger D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10988-10993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Intracellular signals can now increase the strength of the αvβ3-cytoskeletal linkages, form a complex, and increase the αvβ3-vitronectin bond strength. It is likely that these different modes will lead to differences in the intracellular signals that are generated. This would provide a new means for the regulation of signals using the same receptor to convey two distinct signals depending on the particular extracellular ligand that is bound.

https://openalex.org/W2327149303,"During cellular apoptosis, retinoblastoma protein (RB) is subjected to cleavage near the carboxyl terminus by a caspase-3-like protease. In addition, an heretofore unidentified protease cleaves RB internally, generating fragments of 68 and 48 kDa. Internal cleavage abrogates the ability of RB to associate with E2F. To investigate the mechanism of RB internal cleavage, we developed and employed an in vitro cleavage assay. Incubation of in vitro translated (35)S-RB with apoptotic cell extracts led to RB cleavage at the C-terminus, followed by internal cleavage. The caspase peptide inhibitors z-VAD-FMK or z-DEVD-FMK blocked both cleavage events. Rapid C-terminal and internal cleavage were also observed when recombinant caspase-3 was added to (35)S-RB. Moreover, when caspase-3 was added to nonapoptotic cell extract, efficient internal cleavage of cellular RB was observed. Caspase-mediated internal cleavage occurred following RB residue aspartate(349) in the sequence DSID(349). This sequence is consistent with a DXXD recognition motif for caspase-3-like enzymes. Interestingly, we also observed RB internal cleavage in caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 cells, indicating that other caspases are capable of cleaving RB internally. Indeed, caspase-7, a member of the caspase-3 subfamily, was found to cleave (35)S-RB at both the carboxyl terminus, and following aspartate(349). By contrast, caspases that are not members of the caspase-3 subfamily failed to cleave RB. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that during apoptosis, a caspase-3-like protease is responsible for degradation and functional inactivation of RB by cleaving the protein internally following aspartate(349)."

To accomplish such critical functions, the assembly and disassembly of the actin filaments must be tightly controlled, both with respect to time and space. Regulatory adapter proteins harboring specific interaction domains (SH2, SH3, PDZ domains)1 seem to play an important role in the control of actin filament assembly.One of the adapter proteins that has attracted considerable attention is zyxin (1Drees B.E. Beckerle M.C. Kreis T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Extracellular Matrix, Anchor, and Adhesion Proteins. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 95-98Google Scholar). Zyxin was originally identified in chicken fibroblasts as a protein associated with focal adhesions, stress fibers, and cell-cell adherence junctions (2Crawford A.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5847-5853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It represents a monomeric protein with an apparent molecular mass of 82 kDa that is phosphorylated at multiple sites. The mammalian homologue of chicken zyxin has recently been cloned from a subtracted cDNA library by virtue of its reduced expression in SV40-transformed human fibroblasts (3Zumbrunn J. Trueb B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). At the same time, human and mouse zyxin cDNA clones were isolated from normal cDNA libraries by cross-hybridization (4Macalma T. Otte J. Hensler M.E. Bockholt S.M. Louis H.A. Kalff-Suske M. Grzeschik K.-H. von der Ahe D. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31470-31478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Sequencing studies demonstrated that the avian and the mammalian zyxin display a similar, modular structure with a proline-rich N terminus, a nuclear export signal, and three C-terminal LIM domains, although they share less than 60% sequence identity.Zyxin has been localized to the barbed ends of actin filaments, especially in lamellipodia, filopodia, and focal adhesions, suggesting that it is involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (5Sadler I. Crawford A.W. Michelsen J.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1573-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). This notion is supported by its structural relationship with the protein ActA from the bacterial pathogenListeria monocytogenes (6Golsteyn R.M. Beckerle M.C. Koay T. Friederich E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1893-1906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This microorganism invades eukaryotic cells and exploits the actin cytoskeleton of the host for its own motility (7Cameron L.A.

Reorganization of the cytoskeleton seems to be accomplished by the bacterial surface protein ActA, which enhances the nucleation of new actin filaments. The structural and functional similarities of zyxin with the central and C-terminal region of ActA suggest that zyxin might also be involved in the assembly and control of the actin cytoskeleton (6Golsteyn R.M. Beckerle M.C. Koay T. Friederich E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1893-1906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Zyxin interacts with a variety of cytoskeletal and regulatory proteins, and some of these interactions have been mapped to individual domains of the zyxin polypeptide. It binds to α-actinin, an actin cross-linking protein enriched in focal adhesion plaques (8Crawford A.W. Michelsen J.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1381-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The interaction site has recently been identified as the extreme N terminus of zyxin by deletion analysis and peptide inhibition studies (9Drees B.E. Andrews K.M. Beckerle M.C. J.

When the α-actinin binding site was deleted, the association of zyxin with focal adhesion plaques was largely impaired, emphasizing the physiological role of the zyxin/α-actinin interaction (10Reinhard M.

Zyxin also binds to members of the Ena/VASP family of proteins, which are known to control microfilament organization (11Reinhard M. Jouvenal K. Tripier D. Walter U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7956-7960Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 12Drees B. Friederich E. Fradelizi J. Louvard D. Beckerle M.C. Golsteyn R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22503-22511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A cluster of four proline-rich motifs present in the N-terminal domain of zyxin seems to be responsible for this VASP-zyxin interaction (13Niebuhr K. Ebel F. Frank R. Reinhard M. Domann E. Carl U.D. Walter U. Gertler F. Wehland J. Chakraborty T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5433-5444Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The proline-rich region of zyxin has also been demonstrated to act as a docking site for the proto-oncogene product Vav (14Hobert O. Schilling J.W. Beckerle M.C. Ullrich A. Jallal B. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1577-1581PubMed Google Scholar). Vav is a regulatory protein controlling the activity of small GTP-binding proteins in blood cells. Finally, zyxin binds to members of the cysteine-rich protein family CRP (5Sadler I. Crawford A.W. Michelsen J.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1573-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). This interaction is accomplished by the first of the three LIM domains found at the C terminus of zyxin (15Schmeichel K.L. Beckerle M.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).The two-hybrid system offers an elegant approach to analyze protein-protein interactions in yeast (16Li B. Fields S. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 957-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). It is based on the modular structure of the yeast transcription factor GAL4, which, if reconstituted by interaction of two fusion proteins, will activate transcription of suitable reporter genes (HIS3,lacZ). The advantage of the system is that large numbers of cDNA clones for potential ligands can be screened and that the interactions are tested under physiological conditions within eukaryotic cells.We have made extensive use of the yeast two-hybrid system to search for additional binding partners of zyxin. In this way we were able to identify a number of potential ligands, including proteins from the cytoskeleton and the transcription machinery, which might be directly or indirectly involved in the formation of actin filaments and focal adhesion plaques.DISCUSSIONZyxin is a cytoskeletal protein that plays an important role in the organization of actin filaments at focal adhesion sites. To fulfill this function zyxin makes multiple contacts with structural and regulatory proteins, but thus far only the interactions with the actin cross-linking protein α-actinin, the regulatory protein VASP, and the LIM protein CRP have been described in some detail.In this study, we have made extensive use of the yeast two-hybrid system to search for additional interaction partners of zyxin. During the initial experiments it became evident that zyxin is a difficult bait to work with, because it has autonomous transactivation properties. By a fragment analysis approach, we could identify two regions of the protein that are responsible for this autonomous activation. One region contains two proline clusters but otherwise does not exhibit any structural motif that would explain its interaction with nuclear proteins of the RNA polymerase complex. The other region contains a nuclear export signal that has previously been identified by Nix and Beckerle (20Nix D.A. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).Our search had therefore to be restricted to fragments that did not induce autonomous transactivation in the two-hybrid system. Searches with fragments comprising the three LIM domains or portions of the proline-rich N terminus have not been fruitful so far. Our search, however, was successful with the N-terminal fragment of human zyxin spanning residues 1–42. To facilitate the identification of truly positive clones, two different cDNA libraries, one prepared from human placenta, the other from human heart, were screened in parallel. Among all the positive clones obtained, there were four that coded for the same or the homologous protein in the two tissues, namely fibulin, cyclophilin, nebulette, and α-actinin. Fibulin is a typical protein of the extracellular matrix. Because zyxin is normally not found in the extracellular matrix, this two-hybrid interaction must be fortuitous, although the majority of independent clones coded for fibulin. Cyclophilin is a cis/trans isomerase that promotes the isomerization of peptide bonds at prolyl residues. This protein might fulfill an important function during the folding of the proline-rich N terminus of zyxin. It is therefore plausible that zyxin possesses a docking site for cyclophilin at its N terminus where the enzyme is actually needed. Five independent clones for cyclophilin B were obtained from the placenta library, whereas one clone for cyclophilin A was retrieved from the heart library. Studies are now in progress to verify this interaction by biochemical experiments. Nebulette is a cytoskeletal protein expressed in heart muscle. Similar to nebulin it is involved in the assembly of the sarcomere, where actin filaments are anchored to the plasma membrane and the Z-disc. Zyxin and nebulette could therefore play an important role in the anchorage of microfilaments to the plasma membrane, an attractive hypothesis that can be tackled now by biochemical experiments.The last binding partner of zyxin that was identified in both screens was α-actinin. From the placenta library, α-actinin 1 was obtained, whereas from the heart library α-actinin 2 was recovered. This is consistent with the relative expression of the isoforms in the two tissues. The zyxin/α-actinin interaction is thus far the only interaction that has been verified by biochemical experiments (8Crawford A.W. Michelsen J.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1381-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 10Reinhard M. Zumbrunn J. Jaquemar D. Kuhn M. Walter U. Trueb B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13410-13418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and that has also been documented in living cells under physiological conditions (9Drees B.E. Andrews K.M. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1549-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 10Reinhard M. Zumbrunn J. Jaquemar D. Kuhn M. Walter U. Trueb B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13410-13418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Because several full-length cDNAs for α-actinin were obtained during our screenings, we were able to map the interaction site in minute detail.Our results in combination with data from the literature provide compelling evidence that a linear epitope of zyxin binds to a conformational epitope of α-actinin. By site-directed mutagenesis the critical amino acids of zyxin that are involved in the interaction were identified as residues 26–31 (Phe-Gly-Pro-Val-Val-Ala). Replacement of a single amino acid (Phe-26 → Ser) within this motif abolished α-actinin binding in the two-hybrid system and in blot overlays. The same mutation also prevented the normal subcellular distribution of zyxin in fibroblasts, emphasizing the physiological importance of the binding motif. The critical six residues are part of a larger domain that has previously been identified as the major α-actinin binding site. Using a crude deletion analysis (10Reinhard M. Zumbrunn J. Jaquemar D. Kuhn M. Walter U. Trueb B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13410-13418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) we have mapped this site to a fragment spanning zyxin residues 21–42 and demonstrated that this fragment is both necessary and sufficient for α-actinin binding. On the other hand, Drees et al. (9Drees B.E. Andrews K.M. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1549-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) have developed a specific peptide inhibitor comprising zyxin residues 16–33 that blocked the interaction of zyxin with α-actinin. Injection of this peptide displaced zyxin from its normal subcellular location and perturbed cell migration. Taken together all these data suggest that zyxin contains a linear epitope exposed at its surface that is specifically recognized by α-actinin. The most critical amino acids of this epitope are represented by the sequence motif Phe-Gly-Pro-Val-Val-Ala. This motif also occurs in LPP (23Petit M.M.R. Mols R. Schoenmakers E.F. Mandahl N. Van de Ven W.J. Genomics. 1996; 36: 118-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) but not in the related protein ZRP (24Murthy K.K. Clark K. Fortin Y. Shen S.H. Banville D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20679-20687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It will therefore be of interest to investigate whether α-actinin does also interact with LPP but not with ZRP.The situation seems to be quite different in the case of the other interaction partner, α-actinin. Deletion analyses indicated that zyxin binds to the central region of α-actinin made up of SPEC domains 2 and 3. There is good evidence that a conformational, rather than a linear determinant is recognized in this case. When the tandem array of the two SPEC domains is truncated by deletion of short pieces from the N terminus or from the C terminus, binding to zyxin is abolished. The size of the zyxin fragment used in our studies does not allow it to bind simultaneously to the N terminus and to the C terminus of the tandem array. It is therefore likely that the deletions cause a major change in the conformation of the tandem repeat, which is no longer compatible with binding. In this context, it is important to remember that α-actinin forms rod-like dimers in which two anti-parallel molecules align in register. The tandem array of SPEC domains 2 and 3 appears to be the minimal fragment that forms stable dimers in vitro (21Djinovic-Carugo K. Young P. Gautel M. Saraste M. Cell. 1999; 98: 537-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). As soon as a short piece is removed from the N terminus or from the C terminus of this tandem array, dimerization is prevented as demonstrated by our two-hybrid analysis. The loss of dimerization might therefore explain the loss of zyxin binding. Thus, we propose that zyxin binds into a groove formed by the α-actinin dimer where it interacts simultaneously with both anti-parallel chains. This interpretation is consistent with our preliminary findings that α-actinin does not interact with zyxin in blot overlays after heat denaturation. 2B. Li and B. Trueb, unpublished observation.Our results are at variance with the findings of Crawford et al. (8Crawford A.W. Michelsen J.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1381-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), who demonstrated binding of zyxin to the N-terminal CH domain of α-actinin. When thermolysin-derived fragments of α-actinin were blotted onto nitrocellulose and probed with native, radiolabeled zyxin, the 27-kDa fragment corresponding to the N-terminal domain reacted with the probe but not the 53-kDa fragment corresponding to the SPEC repeats. One possible way to reconcile these conflicting results is that α-actinin contains more than one binding site for zyxin. One site would be the conformational determinant in the center of α-actinin as identified in our report, the other would be an unrelated determinant at the N terminus of α-actinin. Another possibility is that native zyxin is extremely sticky and produces unspecific staining when used as a radiolabeled probe in blot overlays. At any rate, binding of radiolabeled zyxin to the dimeric form of α-actinin as proposed in our report cannot be demonstrated by the blot overlay technique, because α-actinin will not form dimeric assemblies after denaturation and separation on SDS-polyacrylamide gels.A great variety of molecules are now known that interact with α-actinin (reviewed in Ref. 22Critchley D.R. Flood G. Kreis T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Extracellular Matrix, Anchor, and Adhesion Proteins. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 17-20Google Scholar). Some of these molecules, including actin (22Critchley D.R. Flood G. Kreis T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Extracellular Matrix, Anchor, and Adhesion Proteins. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 17-20Google Scholar), CRP (25Pomiès P. Louis H.A. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and ERK (26Leinweber B.D. Leavis P.C. Grabarek Z. Wang C.L. Morgan K.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), interact with the N-terminal CH domain of α-actinin. Other proteins such as titin (27Young P. Ferguson C. Banuelos S. Gautel M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1614-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and ZASP (28Faulkner G. Pallavicini A. Formentin E. Comelli A. Ievolella C. Trevisan S. Bortoletto G. Scannapieco P. Salamon M. Mouly V. Valle G. Lanfranchi G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) have been reported to interact specifically with the C-terminal domain containing the EF hands. Again some other proteins bind, in a way similar to zyxin, to the central SPEC repeats of α-actinin, namely α-catenin, the Z-disc protein ALP, and its related protein CLP-36, the protein kinase PKN and the methyl-aspartate receptor NMDA. Binding of α-catenin involves the central region of SPEC domains 2 and 3 (residues 479–529) and does not seem to depend on the dimerization of α-actinin (29Nieset J.E. Redfield A.R. Jin F. Knudsen K.A. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ALP binds via its PDZ domain to SPEC repeat 3, which by itself does not form dimers (30Xia H. Winokur S.T. Kuo W.-L. Altherr M.R. Bredt D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The interaction of CLP-36 with α-actinin has not yet been analyzed in detail (31Vallenius T. Luukko K. Makela T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11100-11105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Based on its structural homology with APL, it is likely that CLP-36 binds to SPEC repeat 3, too. The same domain has also been identified as the major target for protein kinase PKN (32Mukai H. Toshimori M. Shibata H. Takanaga H. Kitagawa M. Miyahara M. Shimakawa M. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4740-4746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the case of the methyl-aspartate receptor NMDA, SPEC domain 4 appears to be essential, although a longer fragment is required for strong binding (33Wyszynski M. Lin J. Rao A. Nigh E. Beggs A.H. Craig A.M. Sheng M. Nature. 1997; 385: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Thus, all the interactions listed above do not seem to depend on the integrity of the tandem array of SPEC domains 2 and 3. In contrast, zyxin is an example that requires the dimeric, anti-parallel conformation of α-actinin for interaction. It would be interesting to investigate whether this interaction is affected by binding of other ligands in close vicinity. This is conceivable for the regulatory proteins ALP (31Vallenius T. Luukko K. Makela T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11100-11105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and CLP-36 (30Xia H. Winokur S.T. Kuo W.-L. Altherr M.R. Bredt D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), because these proteins possess, in addition to their PDZ domain, a C-terminal LIM domain that could interact with the C-terminal LIM domains of zyxin. In this way, ALP and CLP-36 could modulate the interaction of zyxin with α-actinin and control the recruitment of zyxin to focal adhesion sites. The actin cytoskeleton of a eukaryotic cell plays a central role in a variety of cellular processes, including cell motility, migration, phagocytosis, intracellular transport, and maintenance of cell polarity. To accomplish such critical functions, the assembly and disassembly of the actin filaments must be tightly controlled, both with respect to time and space. Regulatory adapter proteins harboring specific interaction domains (SH2, SH3, PDZ domains)1 seem to play an important role in the control of actin filament assembly. One of the adapter proteins that has attracted considerable attention is zyxin (1Drees B.E. Beckerle M.C. Kreis T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Extracellular Matrix, Anchor, and Adhesion Proteins. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 95-98Google Scholar). Zyxin was originally identified in chicken fibroblasts as a protein associated with focal adhesions, stress fibers, and cell-cell adherence junctions (2Crawford A.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5847-5853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It represents a monomeric protein with an apparent molecular mass of 82 kDa that is phosphorylated at multiple sites. The mammalian homologue of chicken zyxin has recently been cloned from a subtracted cDNA library by virtue of its reduced expression in SV40-transformed human fibroblasts (3Zumbrunn J. Trueb B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). At the same time, human and mouse zyxin cDNA clones were isolated from normal cDNA libraries by cross-hybridization (4Macalma T. Otte J. Hensler M.E. Bockholt S.M. Louis H.A. Kalff-Suske M. Grzeschik K.-H. von der Ahe D. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31470-31478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Sequencing studies demonstrated that the avian and the mammalian zyxin display a similar, modular structure with a proline-rich N terminus, a nuclear export signal, and three C-terminal LIM domains, although they share less than 60% sequence identity. Zyxin has been localized to the barbed ends of actin filaments, especially in lamellipodia, filopodia, and focal adhesions, suggesting that it is involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (5Sadler I. Crawford A.W. Michelsen J.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1573-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). This notion is supported by its structural relationship with the protein ActA from the bacterial pathogenListeria monocytogenes (6Golsteyn R.M. Beckerle M.C. Koay T. Friederich E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1893-1906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This microorganism invades eukaryotic cells and exploits the actin cytoskeleton of the host for its own motility (7Cameron L.A. Giardini P.A. Soo F.S. Theriot J.A. Nature Rev. 2000; 1: 110-119Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Reorganization of the cytoskeleton seems to be accomplished by the bacterial surface protein ActA, which enhances the nucleation of new actin filaments. The structural and functional similarities of zyxin with the central and C-terminal region of ActA suggest that zyxin might also be involved in the assembly and control of the actin cytoskeleton (6Golsteyn R.M. Beckerle M.C. Koay T. Friederich E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1893-1906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Zyxin interacts with a variety of cytoskeletal and regulatory proteins, and some of these interactions have been mapped to individual domains of the zyxin polypeptide. It binds to α-actinin, an actin cross-linking protein enriched in focal adhesion plaques (8Crawford A.W. Michelsen J.W. Beckerle M.C. J.

https://openalex.org/W2332063955,"In recent years, increasing evidence indicated the importance of a deregulated c-myc gene in the melanoma pathogenesis. We have previously demonstrated that treatment of melanoma cells with c-myc antisense oligodeoxynucleotides can inhibit cell proliferation and activate apoptosis. To gain insight into the mechanisms activated by Myc down-regulation, we have now developed an experimental model that allows modulating Myc protein expression in melanoma cells. This was achieved by originating stable melanoma cell clones expressing ecdysone-inducible c-myc antisense RNA. We show that the induction of c-myc antisense RNA in M14 melanoma cells leads to an inhibition of cell proliferation characterized by accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (up to 80%) and activation of apoptosis (50%). These data are associated with an increase of p27kip1 levels and a significant reduction of the cdk2-associated kinase activity. In addition, we show that an ectopic overexpression of p27kip1 in this experimental model can enhance the apoptotic rate. Our results indicate that down-regulation of Myc protein induces a G1 arrest and activates apoptosis by increasing p27kip1 content in melanoma cells, that are known to be defective for the p16-cyclinD/cdk4-pRb G1 checkpoint. This is particularly relevant for identifying new therapeutic strategies based on the re-establishment of the apoptotic pathways in cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2332723198,Teratocarcinomas are tumors that arise from primordial germ cells and are readily curable with DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic drugs. Teratocarcinoma cells ex vivo in tissue culture are also relatively chemosensitive and undergo apoptotic death in response to DNA damage. We have previously hypothesized that the observed sensitivity of this tumor type to DNA damage is related to high basal expression of wild-type p53 protein. We have now addressed this issue by characterizing the DNA damage response of isogenic teratocarcinoma cells that differ only in their level of expression of wild-type p53 protein. We find a clear p53 dose-response relationship in these cells for rapid apoptosis following DNA damage that correlates with diminished colony formation in clonogenic survival assays. These results suggest that strategies to increase basal wild-type p53 protein expression prior to treatment with DNA-damaging drugs may improve curability in other tumor types.
https://openalex.org/W2029959892,"Erythrocyte protein 4.1R is a multifunctional protein that binds to various membrane proteins and to phosphatidylserine. In the present study, we report two important observations concerning 4.1R-phosphatidylserine interaction. Biochemically, a major finding of the present study is that 4.1R binding to phosphatidylserine appears to be a two-step process in which 4.1R first interacts with serine head group of phosphatidylserine through the positively charged amino acids YKRS and subsequently forms a tight hydrophobic interaction with fatty acid moieties. 4.1R failed to dissociate from phosphatidylserine liposomes under high ionic strength but could be released specifically by phospholipase A2 but not by phospholipase C or D. Biochemical analyses showed that acyl chains were associated with 4.1R released by phospholipase A2. Importantly, the association of acyl chains with 4.1R impaired its ability to interact with calmodulin, band 3, and glycophorin C. Removal of acyl chains restored 4.1R binding. These data indicate that acyl chains of phosphatidylserine play an important role in its interaction with 4.1R and on 4.1R function. In terms of biological significance, we have obtained evidence that 4.1R-phosphatidylserine interaction may play an important role in cellular sorting of 4.1R.

Biochemical analyses showed that acyl chains were associated with 4.1R released by phospholipase A2. Importantly, the association of acyl chains with 4.1R impaired its ability to interact with calmodulin, band 3, and glycophorin C. Removal of acyl chains restored 4.1R binding. These data indicate that acyl chains of phosphatidylserine play an important role in its interaction with 4.1R and on 4.1R function. In terms of biological significance, we have obtained evidence that 4.1R-phosphatidylserine interaction may play an important role in cellular sorting of 4.1R. protein 4.1R glycophorin C phospholipase A2 phospholipase C phospholipase D phosphatidylserine phosphatidylcholine fatty acid endoplasmic reticulum green fluorescent protein calmodulin inside-out vesicle polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Protein 4.1R (4.1R)1 in erythrocytes has multiple binding sites for transmembrane and skeletal proteins and plays a critical role in maintaining cell morphology and membrane mechanical properties (1Conboy J.G.

The mechanical stability of the erythrocyte membrane is regulated by 4.1R interaction with the spectrin-actin network (3Takakuwa Y. Tchernia G. Rossi M. Mohandas N. J. Clin.

Hereditary defects in 4.1R result in abnormally shaped erythrocytes with decreased membrane mechanical stability, manifested clinically as hemolytic anemia (6Tchernia G. Mohandas N. Shohet S.B. J.

A 30-kDa N-terminal membrane binding domain possesses binding sites for the cytoplasmic tails of integral membrane proteins, such as band 3 (8Jons T. Drenckhahn D.

Protein 4.1R has also been shown to bind phosphatidylserine (PS) (22Sato S.B. Ohnishi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 130: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 23Rybicki A.C. Heath R. Lubin B.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), which is exclusively localized in the inner leaflet of the erythrocyte membrane. However, in contrast to extensive structural and functional characterization of the various protein-protein interactions involving 4.1R, little is known about the nature and the function of 4.1R interaction with PS. Recent studies are beginning to shed light on the potential function of PS interaction with cytoskeletal proteins. For example, PS interaction with the actin-binding protein talin has been shown to mediate anchorage of actin filaments to the phospholipid bilayer (25Kaufmann S. Kas J. Goldmann W.H. Sackmann E. Isenberg G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 14: 203-205Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 26Goldmann W.H. Niggli V. Kaufmann S. Isenberg G. Biochemistry. 1992; 25: 7665-7671Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar), whereas PS interaction with microtubule protein tau or with microtubule-associated GTPase dynamin has been shown to regulate protein function and/or phosphorylation state (27Shea T.B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 50: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 28Tuma P.L. Stachniak M.C. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17240-17246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To gain insight into the feature of 4.1R-PS interaction, we performed a detailed characterization of this interaction using PS liposomes and PS-loaded inside-out vesicles (IOVs) prepared from erythrocytes. We obtained evidence that suggests that 4.1R interaction with PS liposomes is a two-step process in which 4.1R first intercalates into PS liposomes through interaction with the serine head group of PS and subsequently forms a tight hydrophobic interaction with the fatty acid moieties. The positively charged cluster of amino acids YKRS, in the 30-kDa membrane binding domain of 4.1R, was documented to play an important role in the initial interaction of 4.1R with PS. Because of the subsequent tight hydrophobic interaction, 4.1R bound to PS could be released only by treatment with phospholipase A2(PLA2), resulting in the release of 4.1R associated with fatty acids (FAs). 4.1R-associated FAs significantly impaired the ability of 4.1R to interact with CaM, band 3, and GPC. Removal of FAs restored 4.1R binding. Finally, whereas Ca2+-CaM regulates the interactions of 4.1R with various membrane proteins (10Nunomura W. Takakuwa Y. Tokimitsu R. Krauss S.W. Kawashima M. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30322-30328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar,12Tanaka T. Kadowaki K. Lazarides E. Sobue K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1987; 262: 6365-6372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has no effect on 4.1R binding to PS liposomes. Moreover, CaM promptly dissociated from 4.1R upon PS binding. Taken together, these data indicate that YKRS residues in 4.1R membrane binding domain are responsible for intercalation of 4.1R into PS liposomes, whereas the acyl chains of PS play an important role in subsequent tight hydrophobic association of PS with 4.1R. To investigate further the biological significance of 4.1R-PS interaction, we transfected wild type 4.1R and YRKS-AAAA mutant 4.1R, which fails to bind PS into COS-7 cells. We confirmed previous observation that wild type 4.1R is broadly distributed in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and plasma membrane (40Gascard P. Lee G. Coulombel L. Auffray I. Lum M. Parra M. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. Chasis J.A. Blood. 1998; 92: 4404-4414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In marked contrast, mutant 4.1R mostly accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This evidence strongly implies that 4.1R-PS interaction may play an important role in 4.1R sorting and localization within cells. After obtaining informed consent, blood was obtained from healthy human volunteers. Purified PS, phosphatidylcholine (PC), CaM from bovine brain, synthetic phosphatidic acid, lyso-PS, PLA2 from bee venom, phospholipase C (PLC) fromBacillus cereus, phospholipase D (PLD) from cabbage, and paraformaldehyde, were purchased from Sigma. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B, calmodulin-Sepharose CL-4B, and PreScission proteinase were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.Precoated Silica Gel 60 plates were obtained from Merck. pET31b(+) vector and nickel resin were purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). pEGFP-C3 vector was from CLONTECH(Palo Alto, CA). Monoclonal anti-GFP antibody was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Anti-mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Cell culture medium DME-H21, Opti-MEM I, and the transfection reagent LipofectAMINE were from Life Technologies Inc. Renaissance chemiluminescence detection kit was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. ER probe rhodamine R6 was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Fatty acid measurement kit was purchased from Wako (Tokyo, Japan). All electrophoresis reagents were obtained from Daiichi Pure Chemicals (Tokyo, Japan). All other chemicals were reagent grade and obtained from standard sources. 4.1R from erythrocytes was prepared according to the method described by Tyler et al. (32Tyler J.M. Hargreaves W.R. Branton D. Proc. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. For some experiments, 4.1R was radiolabeled using Bolton-Hunter reagent (2000 Bq/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and dialyzed against binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 130 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mmNaN3). Recombinant proteins corresponding to the four chymotryptic domains of 4.1R (30, 16, 10, and 22/24 kDa) and two regions in the 30-kDa domain encoded by exons 4–9 and 9–11, respectively, were produced as glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. The protocols used for expression and purification of fusion proteins have been previously described (10Nunomura W. Takakuwa Y. Tokimitsu R. Krauss S.W. Kawashima M. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30322-30328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Replacement of233YKRS by AAAA in 4.1R cDNA cloned into pET 31b(+) vector was accomplished using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. A PreScission proteinase cleavage site was introduced between the C-terminal end of 4.1R and the His6 tag. The expressed protein was purified from bacterial lysate using nickel affinity column. The His6 tag was cleaved by PreScission proteinase because positively charged His tag appeared to affect 4.1R-PS binding. The glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein concentrations were determined according to the following equation: protein concentration (mg/ml) = 1.45 A 280 – 0.74 A 260. 4.1R concentration was determined by spectrophotometry using published specific absorptivity: 4.1R concentration (mg/ml) = 0.8A 280 (33Tyler J.M. Reinhardt B.N. Branton D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7034-7039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type 4.1R was cloned into pEGFP-C3 vector using BglII and SacI cloning sites. 4.1R was inserted downstream of GFP. To clone YRKS-AAAA mutant 4.1R construct, a 782-base pair PflMI-BlpI fragment containing a YRKS to AAAA mutation was isolated from a pET31b(+) 4.1R mutant construct and replaced into cloned pEGFP-C3 wild type 4.1R Small unilamellar phospholipid liposomes were prepared by sonication. In brief, phospholipids were dissolved in an equal volume mixture of chloroform and methanol, and the organic solvents were evaporated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator. Binding buffer was added to the residual phospholipid film to obtain a final phospholipid concentration of 1 mg/ml. The resulting solution was sonicated using a bath type sonicator for 30 min at room temperature under nitrogen in order to prevent oxidation of lipids. The size of the resultant liposomes ranged between 50 and 80 nm as measured by light scattering. Phospholipid liposomes were stored under nitrogen at 4 °C and used within 1 week of their preparation. The phospholipid concentration of liposomes was determined by phosphate analysis using the method described by Bartlett (34Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Inside-out vesicles depleted of all peripheral proteins (pH 11 IOVs) were prepared as previously described (35Danilov Y.N. Fennell R. Ling E. Cohen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2556-2562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Phospholipids (PS or PC) were loaded into pH 11 IOVs according to the method described by Brockman and Anderson (36Brockman J.L. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2508-2512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, phospholipids dissolved in an equal volume mixture of chloroform and methanol at a concentration of 20 mg/ml were rapidly injected into 1 ml of IOV suspension (2.4 mg of protein). The final concentration of chloroform/methanol by volume in the mixture was 2%. The mixture was incubated overnight on ice with constant gentle stirring followed by three washes of the phospholipid-loaded IOVs with binding buffer. The loading of pH 11 IOVs with either PS or PC was confirmed by thin layer chromatography (TLC). Gel filtration chromatography was used to assess 4.1R-liposome interaction, whereas sedimentation assay was used to quantitate 4.1R-PS interaction. To perform gel filtration chromatography, 210 μg of proteins was incubated with liposomes (250 nm) in a total volume of 1.2 ml of binding buffer for 1 h at room temperature. To separate the liposome-bound protein from the unbound protein, 1 ml of the incubated mixture was passed through a 1 × 30 cm Sepharose 4B column at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. 2-ml fractions of flow-through were collected and analyzed by 9% SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to visualize the proteins in various fractions. To quantitate 4.1R binding to PS liposomes, 4.1R (10 μg-180 μg/ml) was incubated with 250 n mole of PS liposomes in a total volume of 1.2 ml for 1 h at room temperature. Liposome-bound 4.1R was separated by centrifugation at 230,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Under these conditions, liposome bound 4.1R sediments with liposomes, whereas unbound 4.1R remained in the supernatant. Pellets were washed three times with binding buffer, and equivalent amounts of pellets were analyzed by 9% SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and analyzed by densitometry. To assay 4.1R binding to PS liposomes in the presence of CaM, 4.1R (25 μg/ml) was preincubated with increasing concentrations of CaM (0–14.4 μm) in a total volume of 0.4 ml in the presence of 100 μm Ca2+ or EGTA at room temperature for 30 min. 250 nm of PS liposomes were subsequently added to the mixture, and the incubation was continued for an additional 1 h at room temperature. Liposome-bound 4.1R and free 4.1R were separated and analyzed as described above. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and analyzed as described above. To study the effects of ionic strength on 4.1R-PS interaction, PS liposomes with bound 4.1R were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in KCl solutions varying in concentrations from 0 to 2m. To study the effect of detergents on 4.1R-PS interaction, the incubation was carried out in binding buffer containing 0.5% Tween 20 or Triton X-100. Following incubation, liposome-bound 4.1R and unbound 4.1R were separated and analyzed as described above. To study the effects of phospholipase treatment on 4.1R-PS liposome complex, PS liposomes with bound 4.1R were treated with either 10 units of PLA2 or PLC or 60 units of PLD for 1 h at room temperature in the presence of 100 μmCa2+. The reaction was terminated by addition of EGTA to a final concentration of 1 mm. The mixture was passed through a Sepharose 4B column to separate liposome-bound 4.1R from 4.1R released by cleavage with phospholipases. The flow-through fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to visualize the proteins in various fractions. Hydrolysis of PS by phospholipases was confirmed by TLC. To measure 4.1R binding to IOVs, 125I-labeled 4.1R (5.6–157 μg/ml) was incubated with 10 μg of either pH11 IOVs or PS-loaded pH 11 IOVs in a total volume of 100 μl of binding buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Following incubation, a subset of these samples was treated with PLA2 as described above. 95 μl of the incubated mixture was layered onto 200 μl of 8% sucrose cushion in binding buffer and centrifuged at 12,500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. IOVs were collected and the amount of125I-labeled 4.1R bound to IOVs was quantitated using a gamma counter. The amount of 125I-labeled 4.1R bound to denatured IOVs or denatured 125I-labeled 4.1R bound to IOVs was quantitated to determine nonspecific binding. Nonspecific binding constituted ∼3% of total binding. COS-7 cells were grown in DME-H21 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. 24 h before transfection, cells were seeded onto coverslips at a density of 200,000 cells/well in a six-well cluster. Transient transfection of plasmids into COS-7 cells was carried out by lipofection as previously described with minor modifications (40Gascard P. Lee G. Coulombel L. Auffray I. Lum M. Parra M. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. Chasis J.A. Blood. 1998; 92: 4404-4414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.5 μg of plasmid cDNA encoding either wild type 4.1R or mutant 4.1R was mixed with 5 μl of LipofectAMINE2000 in 200 μl of Opti-MEM I at room temperature for 20 min to allow liposome-DNA complexes to form before addition to the cells. The cells were grown for another 28–36 h in 1 ml of DME-H21 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Two sets of cells were grown in parallel, one set for immunofluorescence analyses and one set for Western blotting. After transfection, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% of paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature, and washed again with phosphate-buffered saline. ER staining with rhodamine R6 was performed as previously described (42Li Y. Tinglu G. Larry G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1191-1210Google Scholar). After the final washes, coverslips were mounted onto slides using mounting medium containing DAPI for nucleus staining. Cells were examined with a 63 × 1.25 oil immersion objective using a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope. After transfection, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then denatured with 200 μl of SDS sample buffer. SDS-PAGE of samples (15 μl each) was performed on a 12% acrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. All steps were performed at room temperature. After blocking for 1 h in blocking buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, 5% nonfat dry milk), the blot was probed for 1 h with monoclonal anti-GFP antibody diluted at 0.4 μg/ml in blocking buffer. After several washes, the blot was incubated with anti-mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase diluted 1:50,000 as described for the primary antibody. After final washes, the blot was developed using the Renaissance chemiluminescence detection kit. Phospholipids and fatty acids were extracted from liposomes using an equal volume mixture of chloroform and methanol. The composition of the TLC solvent used for phospholipid separation was chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water (25:15:4:2), and that for fatty acid separation was petroleum ether:diethyl ether:acetic acid (40:15:0.5). Fatty acid measurements were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. IOV protein concentration was determined with Bradford reagent using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Gel filtration column chromatography was used to separate liposomes from unbound protein. PS liposomes incubated with 4.1R were applied onto a Sepharose 4B column. As shown in Fig. 1 A, a large fraction of 4.1R eluted in the void volume in association with PS liposomes (fractions 5–8), whereas a small quantity of unbound 4.1R was found in later fractions (fractions 12–13). Rechromatography of the 4.1R-bound PS liposomes showed that all of the 4.1R remained associated with the liposomes (Fig. 1 B), implying that 4.1R is tightly bound to the liposomes. In marked contrast, there was no binding of 4.1R to PC liposomes (data not shown). However, 4.1R could bind to phosphatidic acid liposomes in a manner analogous to its binding to PS liposomes (data not shown). These data imply that 4.1R can bind only to liposomes in which the hydrophilic head groups of phospholipids are negatively charged. To determine the dependence of 4.1R binding on liposome PS content, binding studies were performed using PS/PC liposomes with varying PS contents (Fig. 1 C). Little 4.1R binding was seen when PS content was less than 30%. Binding progressively increased at higher PS contents, and maximal binding was seen when PS content was 40% or higher. This finding suggests that a threshold amount of the serine head group of PS is required for 4.1R binding to liposomes. In order to identify the PS binding motif in 4.1R, the ability of various 4.1R recombinant proteins encoding different domains of the protein to bind PS liposomes was evaluated. The recombinant protein encoding the N-terminal 30-kDa domain of 4.1R bound PS liposomes, whereas the proteins encoding the 16-, 10-, and 22/24-kDa domains did not (data not shown). Furthermore, a recombinant protein representing sequences encoded by exons 9–11 in the 30-kDa domain bound PS liposomes, whereas sequences encoded by exons 4–9 failed to do so (data not shown), implying that PS binding motif of 4.1R lies in sequences encoded by exons 10 and/or 11. A closer examination of the sequences encoded by these two exons revealed the presence in exon 10 of the sequence motif YKRS, similar to the PS binding motif FKKS previously reported in MARCKS protein (37Takashi N. Kojima N. Ogita T. Tusji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12147-12151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Mutation of the YKRS sequence to AAAA abolished the ability of 4.1R to bind PS liposomes (Fig. 2). Thus, the positively charged cluster of amino acids YKRS, in the 30-kDa membrane binding domain of 4.1R, appears to play a critical role in mediating 4.1R interaction with the negatively charged serine head group of PS. To further define the basis for the observed tight interaction between 4.1R and PS liposomes, we first quantitated 4.1R binding to PS liposomes. The amount of 4.1R bound to PS-liposomes increased with increasing 4.1R concentrations (Fig.3 A), and the measured maximal level of binding was 125 μg of 4.1R/mg of PS. Scatchard analysis did not generate a linear relationship between the ratio of bound to free 4.1R and bound 4.1R, and therefore, we could not derive a value for the dissociation constant (K D) (Fig.3 B). We also explored the experimental conditions needed to release 4.1R from PS liposomes. High salt concentrations, which have been previously shown to dissociate 4.1R from IOVs prepared from red cell membranes, failed to dissociate 4.1R from PS liposomes. Even at a concentration of 2 m KCl, there was no release of 4.1R from PS liposomes. However, treatment of 4.1R-bound PS liposomes with 0.5% Tween 20 as well as other detergents resulted in the release of 4.R (data not shown). These results strongly imply a hydrophobic interaction between 4.1R and PS liposomes. To further document the hydrophobic interaction between 4.1R and PS liposomes, we examined the ability of various phospholipases, PLA2, PLC, and PLD, to release bound 4.1R. When PS liposomes with bound 4.1R were treated with PLA2, 4.1R was released from the liposomes (Fig.4 A). It is noteworthy that the released 4.1R was found in fractions 9–11 (Fig. 4 A), whereas free 4.1R was normally found in fractions 12–13 (see Fig.1 A). This finding suggested that the biochemical character of 4.1R released from the liposomes following PLA2treatment was altered. In marked contrast, neither PLC nor PLD could release 4.1R (Fig. 4 B). It should be noted that PLA2 treatment resulted in hydrolysis of significant amounts of PS in the liposomes, resulting in the generation of large quantities of lyso-PS. However, these liposomes were intact. They did not pass through a polycarbonate membrane with a nominal pore diameter of 20 nm, implying that they were larger than 20 nm in size. In contrast, micelles composed of pure lyso-PS easily passed through the same polycarbonate membranes. These findings indicate that PLA2-induced release of 4.1R from PS liposomes was not due to physical breakup of the liposomes. TLC analysis showed that FA was associated with released 4.1R, and fatty acid measurement showed that the FA:4.1R molar ratio was 6–8:1. Neither intact PS nor lyso-PS was found in association with the released 4.1R. Most of 4.1R-associated FAs could be released by treatment with 0.5% Tween 20. Importantly, in terms of function, whereas native 4.1R interacted with band 3, GPC, CaM, and PS, 4.1R with associated FAs failed to interact with any of these binding partners. We then examined whether the ability of 4.1R to interact with its binding partners could be restored by removal of FAs from the FA-4.1R complex by Tween 20. As shown in Fig.5, although FA-bound 4.1R did not bind to band 3 and GPC on IOVs, both native 4.1R and 4.1R from which bound FAs had been removed did bind to IOVs. Restoration of binding ability following removal of FAs was also observed for 4.1R binding to CaM and to PS liposomes (data not shown). Previous studies identified two distinct CaM binding motifs in the 30-kDa membrane binding domain of 4.1R, one encoded by exon 11 that binds CaM with high affinity in the absence of Ca2+ and another encoded by exon 9 that binds CaM with high affinity in the presence of Ca2+ (13Nunomura W.

https://openalex.org/W2069992745,"We have previously reported that there is a high incidence of microsatellite instability (MSI) and germline mismatch repair gene mutation in colorectal cancer arising from young Hong Kong Chinese. Most of the germline mutations involve hMSH2, which is different from the mutation spectrum in the Western population. It is well known that alternative splicing is common in hMLH1, which complicates RNA based mutation detection methods. In contrast, large deletions in hMLH1, commonly observed in some ethnic groups, tend to escape detection by exon-by-exon direct DNA sequencing. Here we report the detection of a novel germline 1.8 kb deletion involving exon 11 of hMLH1 in a local hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer family. This mutation generates a mRNA transcript with deletion of exons 10–11, which is indistinguishable from one of the most common and predominant hMLH1 splice variants. A diagnostic test based on PCR of the breakpoint region led to the identification of an additional young colorectal cancer patient with this mutation. Haplotype analysis suggests that they may share a common ancestral mutation. Our results caution investigators in the interpretation of alternative splicing and have important implications for the design of hMLH1 mutation detection strategy in the Chinese population."

The plasma membrane H+-ATPase is the pivotal enzyme for energization of secondary active transport in the plant cell, generating the electrochemical gradient that provides the driving force for a number of key physiological processes such as stomata opening, phloem loading, and root ion uptake (6Palmgren M.G. Adv. Bot. Res. 1998; 28: 1-70Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). As far as the molecular bases of H+-ATPase regulation, some light has been shed by investigating the mode of action of the fungal toxin fusicoccin (FC).1 In fact, it has been ascertained that FC promotes the irreversible association of stimulatory 14-3-3 proteins with the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain of the H+-ATPase (7Jahn T.

Very recently it has been shown that blue light activates the H+-ATPase of stomata guard cells by promoting 14-3-3 association (12Kinoshita T. Shimazaki K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5548-5558Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). This finding indicates that 14-3-3 proteins are physiological regulators of the H+-ATPase and raises a question about the mechanisms controlling 14-3-3 association under natural conditions. Although evidence for a phosphorylation-mediated regulation has been reported (12Kinoshita T. Shimazaki K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5548-5558Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 13Olsson A.

Circumstantial evidence of the presence in plant extracts of endogenous ligands able to inhibit the FC-stimulated H+-ATPase activity have been reported (15Aducci P. Crosetti G. Federico R. Ballio A. Planta. 1980; 148: 208-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that 5′-AMP is able to inhibit 14-3-3 association with the nitrate reductase (16Athwal G.S. Huber J.L. Huber S.C. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this paper we demonstrate that 5′-AMP is able to interfere with 14-3-3 binding to the proton pump and consequently to hamper 14-3-3 stimulation, therefore representing an endogenous modulator of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase. FC was prepared according to Ballio et al. (17Ballio A. Carilli A. Santurbano B. Tuttobello L. Ann. Ist. Super. Sanità. 1968; 4: 317-332PubMed Google Scholar); [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 110 TBq/mmol) and thrombin were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Protein kinase A, catalytic subunit, 5′-AMP agarose, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR), and AMP were from Sigma. 2′-O-(trinitrophenyl)-AMP (TNP-AMP) was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oregon). The peptide biotinyl-LKGLDIDTIQQNYTpV (where Tp stands for phosphothreonine) was synthesized by Neosystem (Strasbourg, France). Chemicals for gel electrophoresis were from Bio-Rad. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Maize seeds (Zea mays L. cv. Santos) from Dekalb (Mestre, Italy) were germinated and grown in the dark for 6 days as already described (18Marra M. Fogliano V. Zambardi A. Fullone M.R. Nasta D. Aducci P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Roots were suspended in 0.5 mm CaCl2 for 30 min and then cut into segments 1 cm long. 500-mg roots were dispensed in 5 ml of 0.5 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 5 mm KCl and incubated at 27 °C after the addition of 10 µm FC and 10 mm AICAR. The pH of the incubation medium was measured every 30 min with a Hanna HI8520 pH meter equipped with a Hanna HI1083 glass microelectrode (Padova, Italy). Plasma membrane H+-ATPase isoform AHA1 (A rabidopsis thaliana H+-ATPase isoform 1) was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as described previously (19Regenberg B. Villalba J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Palmgren M.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1655-1666PubMed Google Scholar). After cell homogenization, the membranes were purified by differential centrifugation, and the ER, containing most of the AHA1, was isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation (20Marra M. Olivari C. Visconti S. Albumi C. Aducci P. De Michelis M.I. Plant Biol. 2000; 2: 1-6Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Two-phase partitioned plasma membranes from maize roots were obtained as described previously (18Marra M. Fogliano V. Zambardi A. Fullone M.R. Nasta D. Aducci P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The last 103 amino acids of the MHA2 isoform (MaizeH+-ATPase isoform 2) were expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST) as described in Ref. 9Fullone M.R. Visconti S. Marra M. Fogliano V. Aducci P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7698-7702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described by Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) in a Mini Protean apparatus (Bio-Rad). The cDNA of the 14-3-3 isoform GF14-6 from maize, cloned into a pGEX-2TK vector, was expressed in E. coli as described previously (9Fullone M.R. Visconti S. Marra M. Fogliano V. Aducci P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7698-7702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The expression system produces a GST-fused 14-3-3 containing a cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site and a thrombin site between the two polypeptides. The32P-labeled GF14-6 was obtained as already described (9Fullone M.R. Visconti S. Marra M. Fogliano V. Aducci P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7698-7702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The specific activity of 32P-labeled 14-3-3 was 3.3 MBq/mg. The overlay assay was carried out according to Fullone et al. (9Fullone M.R. Visconti S. Marra M. Fogliano V. Aducci P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7698-7702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, two-phase partitioned plasma membranes (10 µg of protein) or the GST-C-terminal domain of the MHA2 (0.5 µg) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane using a semidry LKB apparatus (2 h, 0.8 mA cm−2). The membrane was blocked with 5% fatty acid-free milk in buffer H (25 mmHepes-OH, 75 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.5) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in the same buffer containing 2% fatty acid-free milk, the 32P-labeled GF14-6 (8.3 kBq/ml), and where indicated, 10 µm FC and 100 µm 5′-AMP. After incubation, the membrane was washed three times with buffer H, dried, and subjected to autoradiography at −80 °C. The peptide biotinyl-LKGLDIDTIQQNYTpV, where Tp represents phosphothreonine, reproduces the last 15 amino acids of the MHA2 H+-ATPase isoform from maize, and it contains the binding site for 14-3-3 proteins. 0.5 nmol of peptide were immobilized onto 40 µl of streptavidin agarose resin (Sigma) and incubated in 50 µl of buffer H with 3.5 kBq of 32P-labeled GF14-6 for 60 min at room temperature in the absence or presence of 5′-AMP and/or FC at concentrations indicated in the figure legends. The resin was then centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min and washed three times with 1 ml of buffer H. Resin-bound radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation β counter (Wallac 1410, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 50 µl of 5′-AMP agarose (corresponding to 0.1 µmol 5′-AMP) resin were incubated with 3.5 kBq of 32P-labeled GF14-6 in 100 µl of buffer H for 60 min at room temperature in the absence or presence of 1 mm 5′-AMP. The resin was then centrifuged at 2000 ×g for 5 min and washed three times with 1 ml of buffer H. Resin-bound radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. The AHA1 ATPase activity of yeast ER membranes was assayed according to Marra et al. (20Marra M. Olivari C. Visconti S. Albumi C. Aducci P. De Michelis M.I. Plant Biol. 2000; 2: 1-6Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). 10 µg of sucrose gradient-purified yeast ER were preincubated with different 5′-AMP concentrations (ranging from 10 to 500 µm) in 50 µl of buffer A (50 mm Tris-Mes, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KNO3, 5 mm NaN3, and 0.2 mm ammonium molybdate, pH 7.2) containing 3 µg/ml GF14-6. After a 20-min incubation, 0.5 ml of buffer A containing 10 µm FC and 2 mm ATP was added. ATP hydrolysis was measured according to Serrano (22Serrano R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were made using an LS-50 spectrofluorophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The fluorescence emission spectrum of TNP-AMP was determined according to Athwal et al. (16Athwal G.S. Huber J.L. Huber S.C. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The intrinsic fluorescence of 40 µm TNP-AMP in 100 mm Mops-OH, 10 mm MgCl2/pH 7.5 was measured in the range of 480–600 nm; GF14-6 was added at the final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, and BSA was used at 0.1 mg/ml. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Administration of AICAR to intact cells causes the accumulation inside the cell of its phosphorylated form, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside monophosphate, a compound mimicking the effect of 5′-AMP (24Sabina R.L. Patterson D. Holmes E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6107-6114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sullivan J.E. Carey F. Carling D. Beri R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1551-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether 5′-AMP could interfere with the FC-mediated stimulation of the H+-ATPase, segments of maize roots were incubated with FC in the presence or absence of AICAR. The results are reported in Fig.1. As expected, 10 µm FC induced a pH decrease of the incubation medium of about 2 units compared with the control, whereas AICAR was almost ineffective. Incubation of roots with 10 mm AICAR in the presence of FC resulted in a strong (∼75%) inhibition of the proton extrusion. The effect of 5′-AMP on the 14-3-3 in vitroinduced activation of the H+-ATPase was tested by using purified ER vesicles of S. cerevisiae expressing the AHA1 isoform of A. thaliana. In this system a significant and reproducible stimulation of H+-ATPase can be obtained by exogenous 14-3-3 proteins, provided that FC is also added. No stimulation of the H+-ATPase activity can be observed in the presence of 14-3-3 but in the absence of FC (10Baunsgaard L. Fuglsang A.T. Jahn T. Korthout H.A.A.J. de Boer A.H. Palmgren M.G. Plant J. 1998; 13: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the administration of 5 µm FC to a mixture containing ER vesicles and the 14-3-3 isoform GF14-6 nearly doubled the ATPase activity of AHA1. This stimulation was reduced progressively by increasing amounts of 5′-AMP ranging from 10 to 500 µm (open circles). 5′-AMP additions in the absence of FC (filled squares) were completely ineffective, thus indicating that the inhibitory effect of 5′-AMP was caused by a reduced capability of 14-3-3 proteins to stimulate the H+-ATPase rather than to a direct effect on the proton pump. The effect of 5′-AMP on the association of 14-3-3 proteins with the proton pump was investigated by means of an overlay assay. In this system the 32P-labeled GF14-6 14-3-3 maize isoform was used as probe, and the H+-ATPase from maize roots or the GST-fused C-terminal domain of the MHA2 isoform was used as bait. The results of autoradiography are reported in Fig.3A. As expected, the 14-3-3 bound to the H+-ATPase; the association was strongly increased by FC, whereas interaction with the C terminus occurred only in the presence of the toxin (9Fullone M.R. Visconti S. Marra M. Fogliano V. Aducci P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7698-7702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The addition of 100 µm5′-AMP in the incubation medium significantly reduced both the association of the 14-3-3 with the H+-ATPase and the C terminus even when the interaction was stabilized by FC. These data were confirmed by testing the capability of GF14-6 to bind a biotinyl-peptide reproducing the last 15 amino acids of the H+-ATPase isoform MHA2, which contains the phosphorylated 14-3-3 binding site (11Fuglsang A.T. Visconti S. Drumm K. Jahn T. Stensballe A. Mattei B. Jensen O.N. Aducci P. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36774-36780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The peptide was immobilized onto a streptavidin-agarose resin and incubated with 32P-labeled GF14-6 in the absence or presence of 5′-AMP and/or FC. The results are shown in Fig. 3 B. 1 mm 5′-AMP resulted in a 40% reduction of GF14-6 binding to the peptide. The inhibitory effect of 5′-AMP was also detectable at 100 µm 5′-AMP (10% of inhibition, data not shown). As expected, FC brought about a strong increase of binding (+112%); interestingly, 5′-AMP was able to partially counteract (−57%) the FC action. To test whether the GF14-6 isoform was able to directly bind 5′-AMP, two different methods were used. In the first method TNP-AMP, an analogue of 5′-AMP, the fluorescence of which increases upon binding to proteins (26Bishop J.E. Nakamoto R.K. Inesi G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 696-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), was utilized. As shown in Fig.4A, the relative intensity of the fluorescence peak at 545 nm of TNP-AMP was increased when the GF14-6 was added to the incubation medium. On the contrary, addition of an equimolar amount of BSA did not affect the fluorescence level, thus confirming the specificity of the binding. In the second method, the ability of GF14-6 to bind to a 5′-AMP-derivatized agarose matrix was tested. As reported in Fig. 4 B, upon incubation of the 5′-AMP-agarose matrix with 32P-labeled GF14-6, a significant amount of radioactivity was bound by the resin. The specificity of the interaction was tested by the addition of a saturating concentration of 5′-AMP to the incubation mixture. In the last few years a large body of evidence has been accumulated that 14-3-3 proteins serve as modulators of multiple cellular processes through the association with a number of proteins. It has been firmly ascertained that the main mechanism regulating 14-3-3 association is represented by phosphorylation of serine or threonine residues within consensus motifs. On the other hand, the complexity of functions of 14-3-3 proteins renders conceivable that multiple mechanisms can finely modulate the phosphorylation-dependent binding. Although it has been shown that factors such as Mg2+ levels or pH can influence association of 14-3-3 proteins to their partners (9Fullone M.R. Visconti S. Marra M. Fogliano V. Aducci P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7698-7702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 27Athwal G.S. Lombardo C.R. Huber J.L. Masters S.C. Fu H. Huber S.C. Plant Cell Physiol. 2000; 41: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), information on the occurrence of physiological compounds able to modulate the 14-3-3 action is still largely undetermined. In this paper we show that the endogenous metabolite 5′-AMP is able to hamper the association of 14-3-3 proteins with the H+-ATPase. This compound is also able to inhibit the 14-3-3-promoted stimulation of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase in vitro and the FC-induced proton extrusion in vivo. Our finding is worth noting because it represents the first evidence of the occurrence in the plant cells of a physiological metabolite able to regulate the activity of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase. Moreover, we show that the 5′-AMP effect depends on its binding to 14-3-3 proteins. This result is in accordance with data obtained by Athwal et al. (16Athwal G.S. Huber J.L. Huber S.C. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), who reported on the presence of a possible 5′-AMP-binding site on the 14-3-3 Arabidopsisisoform GF14ω. Sequence analysis indicates that a putative nucleotide-binding site is present between helices 4 and 5 of both GF14-6 and GF14ω. Interestingly, this motif seems to be conserved in all animal and plant 14-3-3 isoforms, thus suggesting that the ability to bind 5′-AMP may be a general feature of 14-3-3 proteins. Our results are consistent with the occurrence of multiple mechanisms for the control of a central enzyme such as H+-ATPase. In fact, it seems that the activation of H+-ATPase, which depends on its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, may be regulated, besides the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the enzyme (14Camoni L. Iori V. Marra M. Aducci P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9919-9923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), by 5′-AMP binding to 14-3-3 proteins. Moreover, our findings also suggest that 5′-AMP can be a general modulator of 14-3-3-regulated processes in plant cells. Although the physiological relevance of this observation is unclear, activities of 14-3-3-regulated enzymes may be linked by 5′-AMP to the energy charge of the cell. Interestingly, it has been reported that 5′-AMP levels vary in response to some stress such as drought or anoxia (29Huber S.C. Kaiser W.M. Physiol. Plant. 1996; 98: 833-837Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), conditions known to affect the activity of nitrate reductase (28Kaiser W.M. Spill D.

https://openalex.org/W2069806459,"The candidate tumour suppressor gene, LUCA-15, maps to the lung cancer tumour suppressor locus 3p21.3. Overexpression of an alternative RNA splice variant of LUCA-15 has been shown to retard human Jurkat T cell proliferation and to accelerate CD95-mediated apoptosis. An antisense cDNA to the 3′-UTR of this splice variant was able to suppress CD95-mediated apoptosis. Here, we report that overexpression of LUCA-15 itself suppresses CD95-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat cells. This suppression occurs prior to the final execution stage of the CD95 signalling pathway, and is associated with up-regulation of the apoptosis inhibitory protein Bcl-2. LUCA-15 overexpression is also able to inhibit apoptosis induced by the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine, but is not able to significantly suppress apoptosis mediated by the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide. These findings suggest that LUCA-15 is a selective inhibitor of cell death, and confirm the importance of the LUCA-15 genetic locus in the control of apoptosis."

Studies were done in the presence and absence of physiologic concentrations of portal venous ammonia in order to test the hypothesis that, when the NH 4+:aspartate ratio is >1, increased hepatic proteolysis provides cytoplasmic aspartate in order to support ureagenesis. When 1 mm[15N]alanine was the sole nitrogen source, the amino group was incorporated into both nitrogens of urea and both nitrogens of glutamine. However, when studies were done with 1 mmalanine and 0.3 mm NH4Cl, alanine failed to provide aspartate at a rate that would have detoxified all administered ammonia. Under these circumstances, the presence of ammonia at a physiologic concentration stimulated hepatic proteolysis. In perfusions with alanine alone, ∼400 nmol of nitrogen/min/g liver was needed to satisfy the balance between nitrogen intake and nitrogen output. When the model included alanine and NH4Cl, 1000 nmol of nitrogen/min/g liver were formed from an intra-hepatic source, presumably proteolysis. In this manner, the internal pool provided the cytoplasmic aspartate that allowed the liver to dispose of mitochondrial carbamyl phosphate that was rapidly produced from external ammonia. This information may be relevant to those clinical situations (renal failure, cirrhosis, starvation, low protein diet, and malignancy) when portal venous NH 4+ greatly exceeds the concentration of aspartate. Under these circumstances, the liver must summon internal pools of protein in order to accommodate the ammonia burden.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 44: 933-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), but its significance as an hepatic nitrogen donor has received little attention. Alanine is the principal amino acid released by skeletal muscle and taken up by the liver in starvation (1Felig P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 44: 933-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Alanine is also of great importance in the fed state, not only because it is a constituent of dietary protein but also because of its production by intestinal cells, where it is a major end product of glutamine metabolism (2Watford M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1200: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A number of recent studies have highlighted the importance of the metabolism of alanine-N for urea synthesis. Yang et al. (3Yang D. Hazey J.W. David F. Singh J. Riochum R. Sreem J.M. Halperin M. Brunengraber H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E469-E476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have used tracer infusions of 15NH4Cl in fasting dogs, a model that presents a potential challenge to urea synthesis if the delivery of pre-formed ammonia (largely derived from intestinal urea hydrolysis) exceeds the uptake of amino acids that serve as potential precursors of the aspartate nitrogen that is needed to support urea synthesis. They found that the only [15N]urea isotopomer formed was Um+1(containing one atom of 15N), and they attributed this to an inability of ammonia to provide nitrogen to aspartate for incorporation into urea (3Yang D. Hazey J.W. David F. Singh J. Riochum R. Sreem J.M. Halperin M. Brunengraber H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E469-E476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A corollary of this observation was the finding that hepatic ammonia uptake was accompanied by the uptake of almost equimolar quantities of alanine, which presumably provided the α-amino group to aspartate. Alanine would serve this role following transamination to glutamate and then to aspartate for incorporation into urea. Since alanine is not produced by intestinal metabolism in these fasting dogs, it must be provided by peripheral tissues. One possibility is that proteolysis, perhaps in the liver itself, is a metabolic price that must be paid to compensate the inability of ammonia to serve as a source of nitrogen for cytoplasmic aspartate for incorporation into urea (3Yang D. Hazey J.W. David F. Singh J. Riochum R. Sreem J.M. Halperin M. Brunengraber H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E469-E476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The experiments of Lopez et al.(4Lopez H.W. Morendras C. Morand C. Demigne C. Remesy C. J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) are also germane in this regard. These workers investigated amino acid, ammonia, and urea fluxes across the liver and intestines of fed and postabsorptive rats. In both of these physiological states amino acid uptake exceeded ammonia uptake. Alanine was the principal amino acid extracted by the liver, accounting for 33 and 25% of total hepatic amino acid extraction, respectively, in the fed and postabsorptive animals. In both situations there was a prominent hepatic output of glutamine (in the postabsorptive state glutamine output exceeded that of urea), which these researchers interpreted as a salvage process that conserves nitrogen arising from hepatic amino acid metabolism, especially that of alanine (4Lopez H.W. Morendras C. Morand C. Demigne C. Remesy C. J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The process of urea synthesis involves equimolar consumption of NH 4+ and aspartate-N. However, in pathological situations such as cirrhosis (5Butterworth R.F. J. Hepatol. 2000; 32: 171-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cancer (6Pisters P.W. Bernnan M.F. Annu. Rev.

Blood Purif. 2000; 18: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), or chronic bacterial hydrolysis of urea and glutamine in the small intestine (3Yang D. Hazey J.W. David F. Singh J.

Under these conditions, the portal blood does not provide the liver with an equimolar amount of aspartate-N to support the needs of hepatic ureagenesis. Therefore, in this study our aim was to explore the hypothesis that when ammonia in the portal venous system is present at physiologic concentration but nitrogen supply differs from the 1:1 (NH 4+:aspartate-N) stoichiometry, there is increased hepatic proteolysis to provide cytoplasmic aspartate so that formation of cytosolic argininosuccinate can keep pace with the rapid incorporation of ammonia into mitochondrial carbamyl phosphate. To test this hypothesis, we have used our previously reported experimental and theoretical methodology that involves the use of15N-labeled substrates (11Nissim I. Cattano C. Nissim I. Yudkoff M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 12Nissim I. Yudkoff M. Brosnan J.T. J. Biol.

We also were able to discriminate between incorporation into urea from the mitochondrial ammonia and cytoplasmic aspartate pools as well as the incorporation of nitrogen into 2-N and 5-N of glutamine. We perfused liver with [15N]alanine in the presence and absence of physiological portal venous concentrations of ammonia. The results show that alanine nitrogen can be used for incorporation into both nitrogens of urea and both nitrogens of glutamine. However, alanine is more effective in providing nitrogen for urea synthesis via cytosolic aspartate than through the mitochondrial ammonia. Similarly, alanine-N was a more effective source of the amino nitrogen of glutamine than of the amide nitrogen. We also found that the presence of physiological concentrations of ammonia increased hepatic alanine uptake and intra-hepatic proteolysis. Livers from fed male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (weighing about 11–13 g) were perfused in the non-recirculating mode as described by Sies (15Sies H. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 48-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The basic perfusion medium was a Krebs' saline continuously gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 and containing lactate (2.1 mm) and pyruvate (0.3 mm) as metabolic fuels. Perfusion flow rate, pH, pCO2, and pO2 (in influent and effluent media) were monitored throughout, and oxygen consumption was calculated. After 20 min of pre-perfusion we changed to a medium that contained, in addition to the lactate and pyruvate, either [15N]alanine (1 mm), [15N]alanine (1 mm), and NH4Cl (0.3 mm) or alanine (1 mm) and15NH4Cl (0.3 mm). Perfusions continued for a total of 70 min. When [15N]alanine was present it was at an isotopic enrichment of 50 mol % excess (MPE)1 from 20 to 45 min and 100 MPE from 45 to 70 min. 15NH4Cl was present at 100% isotopic enrichment. Separate perfusate reservoirs, each containing different media, were used to facilitate changes in perfusions. Samples were taken from the influent and effluent media for chemical and GC-MS analyses. At the end of the perfusions livers were freeze-clamped with aluminum tongs precooled in liquid N2, and the frozen livers were ground into a fine powder, extracted into perchloric acid, and the extracts used for the analysis of adenine nucleotides by enzymatic techniques (16Brosnan J.T. Krebs H.A. Williamson D.H. Biochem. J. 1970; 117: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Amino acids were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography, utilizing pre-column derivatization with o-phthalaldehyde (17Jones B.N. Gilligan T.P. J. Chromatogr. 1983; 266: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Ammonia and urea were assayed by standard methods (18Geyer J.W. Dabich D. Anal.

GC-MS measurements of 15N isotopic enrichment were performed on a Hewlett-Packard 5970 MSD and/or 5971 MSD coupled with a 5890 HP-GC, as described previously (12Nissim I. Yudkoff M. Brosnan J.T. J.

For measurement of 15N enrichment in urea and amino acids, samples were prepared as we have described previously (12Nissim I. Yudkoff M. Brosnan J.T. J. Biol.

Briefly, a 500-µl aliquot of effluent or liver extract was purified via an AG-50 (H+; 100–200 mesh; 0.5 × 2.5 cm) column and then converted into t-butyldimethylsilyl derivatives. The m/z 231, 232, 233, and 234 of the ureat-butyldimethylsilyl derivative was monitored for singly labeled and doubly labeled urea determination (13Nissim I. Brosnan M.E. Yudkoff M. Nissim I.

Mass Spectrom. 1993; 22: 518-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Isotopic enrichment in citrulline, glutamate, aspartate, and alanine was monitored using ratios of ions at m/z of 443/442, 433/432, 419/418, and 261/260, respectively. Enrichment in [2-15N]glutamine was determined by monitoring them/z 259/258 and [5-15N]glutamine by the difference between m/z 432/431 and m/z 259/258 ratios (20Patterson B.M. Carraro F. Wolfe R.R. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 22: 518-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Doubly labeled glutamine was determined usingm/z 433/431 ratio. 15NH3 enrichment was measured after conversion of ammonia to norvaline. To this end, we have modified the method previously published by Nieto et al. (21Nieto R. Calder A.G. Anderson S.E. Lobley G.E. J. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 31: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) as follows. After 5 min preincubation with α-ketoglutarate to remove any ammonia that may be present in glutamate dehydrogenase, effluent samples (500 µl) were incubated for 30 min with 2-oxopentanoic acid to convert ammonia into norvaline as described (21Nieto R. Calder A.G. Anderson S.E. Lobley G.E. J. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 31: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Incubation was stopped by addition of 1 ml of 4 n HCl, and then samples were passed through an AG-50 (H+; 100–200 mesh; 0.5 × 2.5 cm) column, washed with 4 ml of water, and norvaline was eluted with 4n NH4OH (3 ml), and dried down at 60 °C under compressed air. Thereafter, samples were reconstituted with 200 µl of water:methanol:pyridine (60:32:18), and norvaline was derivatized by addition of 20 µl of ethyl chloroformate. This mixture was gently shaken for about 1 min. The derivatized norvaline was extracted with 1 ml of ethyl acetate, dried down with gentle stream of nitrogen gas, and redissolved in 75 µl of ethyl acetate for GC-MS analysis. The ions at m/z 144 and 145 were monitored, andm/z 145/144 ratio was used to determine 15N enrichment in ammonia. With each series of samples a calibration curve of ammonia with a known isotopic enrichment that ranged between 1 and 50 atom % excess was prepared. In almost every preparation, we achieved an excellent agreement between the observed and the expected15N enrichment in ammonia with r values better than 0.9 (data not shown). The formation of15N-labeled metabolites was determined by the product of their isotopic enrichment (mol % excess/100) times concentration (nmol/g wet wt) and is expressed as nanomoles of 15N metabolite per g wet weight (11Nissim I. Cattano C. Nissim I. Yudkoff M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 12Nissim I. Yudkoff M. Brosnan J.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16199-16207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The distribution of [15N]urea mass isotopomers was calculated using the mathematical model we have described previously (14Brosnan J.T. Brosnan M.E. Charron R. Nissim I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16199-16207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, when 15N-labeled precursor is provided, the urea formed may have a mass of 60 (Um), 61 (Um+1), or 62 (Um+2) depending on whether 0, 1, or 2 15N atoms of urea are labeled. Let the fractional abundance of 15N in the mitochondrial ammonia pool be x, then the fractional of 14N in the same pool is 1 − x. Similarly, let the fractional abundance of 15N in the cytoplasmic aspartate pool bey, then the fractional of 14N in the same pool is 1 − y. Then the fraction of the urea isotopomer containing no atom of 15N will be Um = (1 −x)(1 − y), the fraction of urea containing 1 atom of 15N will be Um+1 = 1 −(xy + (1 − x)(1 − y)), and the fraction of urea containing 2 atoms of 15N will be Um+2 = xy. Therefore, Um, Um+1, and Um+2 sum to unity. This relationship permits us to calculate the fraction of Um, Um+1, and Um+2 at any given abundance of 15N in the mitochondrial ammonia and cytoplasmic aspartate pools, i.e. at any values ofx and y, as we have described (14Brosnan J.T. Brosnan M.E. Charron R. Nissim I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16199-16207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Statistical analyses were carried out by the use of Student'st test or analysis of variance test, as appropriate. Ap value less than 0.05 was taken as indicating a statistically significant difference. Chemicals were of analytical grade and obtained from Sigma or from Aldrich. Enzymes and cofactors for the analysis of adenine nucleotide and ammonia were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and 15NH4Cl and [15N]alanine both 99 mol % excess were from Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories Inc. (Andover, MA). Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were from Memorial University's colony and were fed on Agway Prolab Rat Chow. Viability of the perfused liver model is verified by the concentration of adenine nucleotides at the end of the 70 min of perfusion (TableI). There were no significant differences between the adenine nucleotide concentrations during the different experimental conditions. These values are similar to those we previously reported in perfused livers (13Nissim I. Brosnan M.E. Yudkoff M. Nissim I. Brosnan J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28958-28965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14Brosnan J.T. Brosnan M.E. Charron R. Nissim I. J. Biol.

Fig. 1,panels A and B, shows the changes in urea, ammonia, alanine, glutamine, and glutamate in the effluent under the various experimental conditions. Oxygen consumption is also shown. The constancy of oxygen consumption is an indication of the stability of the preparations.Table IHepatic adenine nucleotide content after 70 min of perfusionNitrogenous substratesATP1-aThese data are given as µmol/g wet weight.ADPAMP15N-Alanine (n = 4)3.22 ± 0.531.11 ± 0.140.17 ± 0.0715N-Alanine + NH4Cl (n = 4)3.21 ± 0.141.19 ± 0.250.14 ± 0.01Alanine + 15NH4Cl (n = 4)3.56 ± 0.301.53 ± 0.140.24 ± 0.071-a These data are given as µmol/g wet weight. Open table in a new tab It is apparent that, at all times, the mean uptake of alanine was greater in the presence of ammonia than in its absence. These differences reached statistical significance at 25, 30, 45, 65, and 70 min. Glutamine output was significantly greater in the presence of ammonia than in its absence at all time points except at 25 min. Of course, urea synthesis was always appreciably greater in the presence of ammonia than in its absence. The effluent alanine, glutamine, glutamate, ammonia, and urea represent the major nitrogenous metabolites in these experiments (the release of other amino acids was minor). Therefore, we calculated the extent to which these five compounds could account for nitrogen balance across the liver. In the experiments with alanine and ammonia, the combined nitrogenous uptake of these metabolites was about 850–900 nmol of nitrogen/min/g liver. The output of nitrogen in urea, glutamine, and glutamate was about 1800–1900 nmol of nitrogen/min/g liver. Thus, approximately, 1000 nmol of nitrogen are produced from endogenous intra-hepatic sources, presumably from proteolysis. In perfusions with alanine alone the uptake of nitrogen (in the form of alanine) averages about 200 nmol/min/g liver, whereas the production of nitrogen (in urea, glutamine and glutamate) averages about 550–650 nmol of nitrogen/min/g liver. Again, there is a requirement for a production of nitrogen from endogenous sources of about 350–450 nmol of nitrogen/min/g liver. This is much less than the requirement of about 1000 nmol of nitrogen/min/g liver in the presence of ammonia. Livers were perfused with [15N]alanine, with and without 0.3 mm unlabeled NH4Cl. Fig.2shows that the uptake of [15N]alanine was greater in the presence of NH4Cl than in its absence. The uptake reached an early plateau at 40–45 min and then increased again, after the enrichment of the [15N]alanine was increased from 50 to 100% at 45 min, to reach a new plateau at 60–70 min. Fig.3shows the fraction (% distribution) of the individual urea isotopomers and the total (nanomoles of nitrogen/min/g) output of each isotopomer in the effluent. It is clear that the presence of 15NH4Cl resulted in an immediate and massive production of [15N]urea which consisted of ∼60 MPE of Um+1 and about 20 MPE of Um+2 (panel C). There was much less production of [15N]urea from the labeled alanine in the presence of unlabeled ammonia, but again there was ∼4-fold increased production of [15N]urea in the presence of ammonia (Fig.3, panel B) than without (Fig. 3, panel A). Most of the labeled urea, i.e. 15–20% of total urea production, was in the form of Um+1 versus 2–3% in the form of Um+2 (panel B). Umis the remaining portion of urea, i.e. ∼80% unlabeled.Figure 3Percent distribution of urea mass isotopomers and the total (nanomoles of nitrogen/min/g) output of the individual isotopomer during the course of perfusion. Panel A, livers were perfused with 1 mm[15N]alanine (50 MPE between 20 and 45 or 99 MPE between 45 and 70 min) without ammonia; panel B, livers were perfused with 1 mm [15N]alanine (50 MPE between 20 and 45 or 99 MPE between 45 and 70 min) with unlabeled 0.3 mm NH4Cl; and panel C, livers were perfused with 1 mm unlabeled alanine and 0.3 mm15NH4Cl (99 MPE). ▵, ○, or ●, indicate urea isotopomer containing no (Um), one (Um+1), or two (Um+2)15N, respectively. The output of the15N-labeled isotopomers is the product of 15N enrichment (mol % excess/100) times one-half of total urea nitrogen (nmol nitrogen/min/g), for Um+1, and times total urea nitrogen for Um+2. The output of Um is the product of percent distribution of Um times concentration of total urea nitrogen.

It is apparent that there was substantial production of all three isotopomers in the presence of15NH4Cl, with [5-15N]glutamine being most abundant, followed by [2-15N]glutamine, and then by doubly labeled glutamine (Fig. 4, panel C). The pattern produced from [15N]alanine was quite different. The 2-15N isotopomer of glutamine was the predominant form produced (Fig. 4, panel A) and was virtually the exclusive form in the presence of NH4Cl (Fig. 4, panel B). The production of [15N]glutamate (Fig.5) showed immediate and very substantial labeling (about 35 MPE) when the livers were perfused with15NH4Cl (100 MPE) and was similarly labeled when perfused with 100 MPE alanine alone (60–70 min). However, in perfusions with [15N]alanine and unlabeled ammonia, the glutamate enrichment was only about one-third that in the absence of ammonia.Figure 5Production of [15N]glutamate ( MPE ) and output (nmol/min/g) during the course of liver perfusion. ●, livers were perfused with 1 mm [15N]alanine (50 MPE between 20 and 45 or 99 MPE between 45–70 min) without ammonia; ▵, livers were perfused with 1 mm [15N]alanine (50 MPE between 20 and 45 or 99 MPE between 45 and 70 min) with 0.3 mm unlabeled ammonia; and ○, livers were perfused with 1 mm unlabeled alanine and 0.3 mm15NH4Cl (99 MPE).

Brosnan M.E. Charron R. Nissim I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16199-16207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The perfusions with15NH4Cl (100 MPE) resulted in very substantial labeling of citrulline (about 70 MPE) but much less labeling of aspartate (about 20 MPE) (Fig. 6,panel C). The metabolic response to [15N]alanine perfusions was very different in that aspartate was much more heavily labeled than was citrulline. The degree of labeling of both citrulline and of aspartate was more pronounced in the absence of ammonia (Fig. 6, panel A) than in its presence (Fig. 6, panel B). Enrichment data for nitrogen-containing metabolites in livers freeze-clamped at the end of the perfusions (70 min) are shown in Fig.7. It is evident that, when [15N]alanine was the labeled substrate, 15N was incorporated into both nitrogenous precursors of urea, but the enrichment in aspartate was 2–3-fold that in citrulline. The same relationship held with [15N]alanine in the presence of NH4Cl except that the incorporation into citrulline was very low (Fig. 7, panel B). With15NH4Cl as precursor, citrulline became very heavily labeled, reaching an enrichment that was twice as much as aspartate (Fig. 7, panel C). Measurement of15N-labeled metabolites in the liver at the end of 70 min of perfusion provides two important findings. First, the intra-hepatic15N enrichment in glutamine, glutamate, aspartate, and citrulline is in excellent agreement with the 15N enrichment in the same metabolites in the effluent at the end of perfusion (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6), suggesting labeling in effluent faithfully reflects enrichment of the intra-hepatic compartment. This conclusion agrees with our previous investigation with 15N-labeled glutamine or ammonia (13Nissim I. Brosnan M.E. Yudkoff M. Nissim I. Brosnan J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28958-28965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14Brosnan J.T. Brosnan M.E. Charron R. Nissim I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16199-16207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The second observation is that [15N]alanine enrichment in the liver extract was about 70 MPE at the end of perfusion even though the [15N]alanine enrichment of the perfusate was ∼100 MPE (Fig. 7, panel A). Since [15N]alanine was the sole precursor provided to the liver, it follows that approximately one-third of hepatic alanine was derived from unlabeled sources. This calculation agrees with the estimated fraction of nitrogen, presumably derived from proteolysis, that was necessary to compensate the balance between nitrogen uptake and nitrogen output, as indicated above (Fig. 1,panel A). Similarly, the [15N]alanine enrichment in perfusion studies with unlabeled ammonia indicates that ∼65% of alanine was derived from unlabeled sources. This estimate is in agreement with the fraction of nitrogen derived from proteolysis in perfusion with [15N]alanine plus unlabeled ammonia,i.e. ∼60%, (Fig. 1, panel B). In this study we employed [15N]alanine as metabolic tracer in order to follow the metabolism of its nitrogen and, in particular, its contribution to urea and glutamine synthesis in the presence or absence of unlabeled NH4Cl. We also examined the metabolic fate of nitrogen derived f"

Such tumor cells are characterized by an autocrine IL-3 loop. DNA microarrays allow simultaneous transcript imaging of several thousand genes and the technique was applied in this tumor model to analyse gene expression following malignant transformation. Using three independent tumor lines derived from the same precursor the expression of about 400 out of 11 000 genes was modulated in each tumor. A subset of only 75 genes (0.68%) is shared and up- or downregulated in all three lines. A significant portion of this gene pool possesses functions related to tumorigenesis such as cell adhesion, signaling or transcriptional regulation. Apart from a number of expressed sequence tags (EST's) we find downregulation of four interferon-inducible genes in the tumor lines. Finally, when we extrapolate our data to the complete mouse genome, we estimate that about 500 genes are differentially expressed in tumor cells compared to the precursor cell PB-3c."

Platelet factor-4 also inhibits tumor growth by mechanisms involving antiangiogenesis. Antiangiogenic activity in vitro has also been shown for the 24-residue C-terminal fragment of the protein, which decreases the affinity between basic fibroblast growth factor and its cell-surface receptor. In this study, the preferential conformation of this fragment in solution has been determined and has been found to be composed of two helical subdomains. In addition, we show that the fragment forms a specific 1:1 complex with acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors and that both subdomains are probably required for inhibition of fibroblast growth factor-driven mitogenesis. Finally, we show that the binding of the fragment alters the structure of the fibroblast growth factors, although some of such alterations do not seem related with the inhibition of mitogenic activity. Since this fragment has recently been shown to inhibit fibroblast growth factor-induced angiogenesis in vivo when injected intraperitoneally, these results are relevant for developing new antiangiogenic treatments.

Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs)1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family members constitute the major class of angiogenic regulators. These factors induce endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis in vitro andin vivo (1Bikfalvi A. Klein S. Pintucci G. Rifkin D.B. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 26-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar, 2Ferrara N. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 527-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). FGFs and VEGFs induce specific cellular responses by binding selectively to cell-surface receptors. The FGF family is presently known to include 22 closely related proteins. Acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) and the subsequently discovered basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) are considered to be representative of the whole family (3Nishimura T. Utsunomiya Y. Hoshikawa M. Ohuchi H. Itoh N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 4Coulier F. Pontarotti P. Roubin R. Hartung H. Goldfarb M. Birnbaum D. J. Mol.

FGFs bind to two receptor classes with high and low affinity at the cell surface. The high affinity receptors (FGFR) belong to the class of the transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases (6Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). FGFRs are widely distributed in all cells of mesodermal and neuroectodermal origin studied thus far, which accounts for the wide spectrum of in vitro mitogenic targets of this protein family (7Baird A. Böhlen P. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 1990; 95: 369-418Crossref Google Scholar, 8Giménez-Gallego G. Cuevas P. Neurol. Res. 1994; 16: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The low affinity receptor of FGFs is the glycosidic moiety of the cell coat and basal membranes (9Moscatelli D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Angiogenesis promoted by VEGF has been reported to be dependent on the endogenous expression of bFGF by endothelial cells and is therefore blocked by antibodies that neutralize to bFGF (10Jonca F. Ortega N. Gleizes P.E. Bertrand N. Plouet J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24203-24209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 11Mandriota S.J. Pepper M.S. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2293-2302PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, there is considerable pharmacological interest in developing inhibitors with the mitogenic activity of FGFs. Platelet factor-4 (PF4) is a CXC chemokine with high affinity for sulfated glycosaminoglycans like heparin and heparan sulfate. PF4 inhibits endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesisin vitro and in vivo (12Maione T.E. Gray G.S. Petro J. Hunt A.J. Donner A.L. Bauer S.I. Carson H.F. Sharpe R.J. Science. 1990; 247: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 13Gupta S.K. Singh J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1121-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 14Niewiarowski S. Lowery C.T. Hawiger J. Millman M. Timmons S. Lab. Clin. Med. 1976; 87: 720-733PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the inhibitor of bFGF mitogenic activity released by activated platelets has been demonstrated to be PF4 (15Watson J.B. Getzler S.B. Mosher D.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition, PF4 inhibits tumor growth through an angiogenesis-dependent mechanism (16Hansell P. Maione T.E. Borgstrom P. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: 829-836PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sharpe R.J. Byers H.R. Scott C.F. Bauer S.Y. Maione T.E. J. Natl.

PF4 has been shown to bind to bFGF and to inhibit processes considered to be essential in bFGF-induced mitogenesis (bFGF binding to high affinity receptors, bFGF internalization, and activation by heparan sulfate proteoglycans (20Perollet C. Han Z.C. Savona C. Caen J.P. Bikfalvi A. Blood. 1998; 91: 3289-3299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Brown J, K. Parish C.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13918-13927Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)). As the synthesis of high quality PF4 by recombinant technologies is considerably cumbersome because of its quaternary structure, and because its activation likely requires an intramonomer hydrolysis (see below), the search for small mimics of PF4 is of obvious interest. The monomer of PF4 consists of 70 amino acids (22Deuel T.F. Keim P.F. Farmer M. Heinrickson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2256-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions four identical polypeptide chains assemble in a defined manner, and it is presumed that the tetramer is the structure populated in vivo (23Zhang X. Chen L. Bancroft D.P. Lai C.K. Maione T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8361-8366Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The PF4 monomer secondary structure from the C to the N terminus consists of one α-helix (Ser70–Ala57), a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (Leu53–Gly48; Lys46–Pro37; Gly33–Thr25), and a β-strand-like element (Glu18–Asp7) that forms an antiparallel β-sheet-like structure between dimers in the tetramer (23Zhang X. Chen L. Bancroft D.P. Lai C.K. Maione T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8361-8366Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). A PF4 form has been isolated from activated human leukocyte supernatants that exhibits a 30–50-fold greater growth inhibitory activity on endothelial cells than the commonly isolated form of the protein. This more active form is a derivative of PF4 generated by cleavage of the Thr16 and Ser17 peptide bond. The two resulting fragments remain linked by a disulfide bond (24Gupta S.K. Hassel T. Singh J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7799-7803Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This unique cleavage affects the connection between the β-strand-like element and the rest of the protein, which may alter the quaternary structure of PF4 (23Zhang X. Chen L. Bancroft D.P. Lai C.K. Maione T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8361-8366Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown by peptide scanning that a fragment of PF4, comprising amino acids 47–70 (PF4-(47–70)) decreases the affinity of bFGF for its cell-surface receptors and emulates many of the antiangiogenic properties of the full-length protein (25Jouan V. Canron X. Alemany M. Caen J.P. Quentin G. Plouet J. Bikfalvi A. Blood. 1999; 94: 984-993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hagedorn M. Zilberberg L. Lozano R.M. Cuevas P. Canron X. Redondo-Horcajo M. Giménez-Gallego G. Bikfalvi A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 550-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Inhibition of bFGF binding to its cell membrane receptor by PF4 and PF4-(47–70), as well as the inhibition of bFGF mitogenic activity in the absence of heparin, has been observed in two different heparan sulfate-deficient cells (20Perollet C. Han Z.C. Savona C. Caen J.P. Bikfalvi A. Blood. 1998; 91: 3289-3299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hagedorn M. Zilberberg L. Lozano R.M. Cuevas P. Canron X. Redondo-Horcajo M. Giménez-Gallego G. Bikfalvi A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 550-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This suggests that inhibition by PF4-(47–70) of bFGF mitogenic activity in vitro is not exclusively mediated by blocking the activation of FGFs (27Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar) by either heparin or cell-surface heparan sulfates, to which PF4-(47–70) bind with high affinity (theoretical pI = 9.75 (21Brown J, K.

Here we report the three-dimensional structure of PF4-(47–70) in solution, the first biophysical characterization of the interaction of PF4-(47–70) with FGFs and an evaluation of the relevance of some effects caused by this interaction for the inhibitory activity of PF4-(47–70). We have recently shown that PF4-(47–70) injected intraperitoneally suppresses bFGF-induced angiogenesis in vivo (26Hagedorn M. Zilberberg L. Lozano R.M. Cuevas P. Canron X. Redondo-Horcajo M.

Ramı́rez J.M. Giménez-Gallego G. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 113: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) was used throughout this work. Different aFGF variants were prepared using the gene coding for the 139-residue wild-type protein as described (33Di Donato A. de Nigris M. Russo N. Di Biase S. D'Alessio G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 291-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethylcarbonyl) synthesis of peptides (free C and N terminus) was carried out in a SynergyTM synthesizer (Applied Biosystems). Cleavage was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. The dried raw synthesis product was dissolved in 13 mmtrifluoroacetic acid and chromatographed on a 1 × 25 cm C4 reverse-phase column (10-μm particle size, 300× pore size; The Separation Group), lyophilized, and then chromatographed again on a 1 × 25 cm C18 reverse-phase column (5 μm particle size, 300× pore size; The Separation Group). Columns were equilibrated in 13 mm trifluoroacetic acid and eluted with a 60-min gradient of 0–70% acetonitrile in 12 mmtrifluoroacetic acid. The purified peptides were stored lyophilized. In order to evaluate the specificity of certain effects, a scrambled form of PF4-(47–70) (scPF4-(47–70), Leu-Gly-Leu-Lys-Pro-Leu-Lys-Glu-Gln-Leu-Ile-Ala-Tyr-Arg-Asp-Asn-Lys-Ile-Lys-Ser-Ile-Cys-Leu-Lys) with the same amino acid composition, whose sequence was generated by a random number generator program, was synthesized. The homogeneity and purity of the final products were assessed by analytical reverse-phase chromatography and mass spectrometry. BaF3/FR1c-11 cells were provided by D. M. Ornitz (Washington University) and were cultured as described (34Ornitz D.M. Xu J.S. Colvin J.S. McEwen D.G. MacArthur C.A. Coulier F. Gao G.X. Goldfarb M. J. Biol.

Incubation times in the proliferation assays were 48 h unless otherwise indicated, with XTT being added 6 h before the end of this period in all the cases. The experiments were done in quadruplicate. For structural characterization by1H NMR spectroscopy, PF4-(47–70) was dissolved at 3.2 mm in 10 mm sodium phosphate/D2O (9:1 ratio by volume). In some cases, the solvent contained 30% (v/v) 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol-d 3 (TFE; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). The phosphate solution was adjusted to either pH 3.4 or pH 6.5, and no corrections were made for isotope effects. The temperature of the NMR probe was calibrated using a methanol sample.15N-Labeled aFGF7 sample (∼15 mg/ml; 0.45 ml), buffered at pH 6 in 10 mm sodium phosphate containing 0.3m of NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 10 μm EDTA, was concentrated as described (36Pineda-Lucena A.

To prepare 15N-labeled aFGF7·PF4-(47–70) complex, an appropriate amount of PF4-(47–70) was added to the protein just before the NMR spectra acquisition to get a 1:1 complex in a final volume 0.45 ml. Just before acquisition of NMR spectra, appropriate amounts of D2O and sodium [3-trimethylsilyl 2,2,3,3-2H]propionate (TSP) as an internal reference for 1Hδ were added. The15N δ-values were indirectly referenced by multiplying the spectrometer frequency that corresponds to 0 ppm in the1H spectrum, assigned to internal TSP, by 0.101329118 (37Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G.

NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker AMX-600 spectrometer. Two-dimensional homonuclear spectra were acquired in the phase-sensitive mode using the time proportional phase incrementation technique (38Marion D. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2038) Google Scholar) spectra were recorded using standard phase-cycling sequences. Short mixing times (150 ms) were used in the NOESY experiments in order to avoid spin-diffusion effects. TOCSY (41Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) spectra were acquired using the standard MLEV17 spin-lock sequence and an 80-ms mixing time. Two-dimensional heteronuclear1H-15N HSQC (42Bodenhausen G. Ruben D.J. Chem. Phys.

Water suppression was achieved either by selective presaturation or by including a WATERGATE module (44Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 6: 661-665Crossref Scopus (3549) Google Scholar) in the original pulse sequences prior to acquisition. The size of the acquisition data matrix was 2048 × 512 words in f 2 andf 1, respectively. Prior to Fourier transformation, the two-dimensional data matrix was multiplied by a phase-shifted square-sine bell window function in both dimensions and zero-filled to 4096 × 1024 words. The phase-shift was optimized for every spectrum. 1H NMR spectra of PF4-(47–70), at pH 3.4, in aqueous solution and in 30% TFE were assigned using standard two-dimensional sequential assignment methods (45Wüthrich K. Billeter M. Braun W. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 715-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 46Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). The fingerprint region of PF4-(47–70) was also assigned both in aqueous solution and 30% TFE at pH 6.5. The sequential NN, αN, and βN NOE connectivities used for assignment are summarized in Fig. 2. 1H δ-values (pH 3.4) are available upon request and are included as Supplemental Material. Calculations of peptide structures were carried out using the standard annealing strategy within the program DYANA 1.5 (47Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2559) Google Scholar), from the spectra acquired at pH 3.4 because of the better signal to noise ratio obtained at acidic pH values. Distance constraints were derived from NOESY spectra acquired with 150-ms mixing time. Quantitative values of the NOE cross-peak volumes were determined by using the integration routine of the XEASY program (48Bartels C. Xia T. Billeter M. Günter P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). The NOE cross-peak intensities were translated into upper limit distance constraints by using the CALIBA routine (49Güntert P. Braun W. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) within the DYANA program. The CALIBA routine assumes that the NOE intensities are proportional to 1/rn, wherer is the interproton distance. The exponent n was assigned a value of 6 when neither of the protons participating in a NOE belonged to a methyl group and a value of 4 if at least one methyl proton is involved. The scaling factors were selected to reproduce the correct distance limit between pairs of protons separated by known fixed distances (Hβ2–Hβ3 protons, Hβ-methyls in Val, etc.). Lower bounds between non-bonded atoms were set to the sum of van der Waals radii. In order to increase the quality of the structure, the φ angles were constrained to the range 0° to −180°, except for Gly and Asn residues. Fluorescence emission spectra were performed in a thermostatically controlled PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50-B spectrofluorimeter. Excitation and emission slit widths were 2.5 and 10 nm, respectively. Samples were excited at 295 nm. The concentration of fluorescent sample was in the linear response range of the spectrofluorimeter. Urea denaturation studies were carried out as described (50Pineda-Lucena A. Jiménez M.A. Nieto J.L. Santoro J. Rico M. Giménez-Gallego G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 81-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The conformational stability of the protein was estimated as Δ GDH2O = m[U]12, where m is the average cooperativity value describing the change in ΔG with the concentration of denaturant measured for the species under study, and [U]12 is the urea concentration at the midpoint transition. Values were estimated from the best fit values for the data to a two-state transition (51Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2426) Google Scholar, 52Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar). Use of m instead of the particular m in each case lowers the standard error of the calculation (53Matouschek A. Serrano L. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 819-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Short column (70 μl) sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at 283 K, either at 25,000 rpm (bFGF, aFGF7, and mixtures) or 50,000 rpm (PF4-(47–70)) in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance optics, using an An-60Ti rotor and standard (12-mm optical path) 6-channel centerpieces of Epon charcoal. Radial absorbance scans were carried out at 277–288 nm until equilibrium was reached. High speed sedimentation (50,000 rpm) was carried out afterward for base-line determination. Whole-cell apparent weight average molecular weights (M̄ w,a) were obtained by fitting the experimental data to the expression describing the radial concentration distribution of an ideal solute on sedimentation equilibrium using the program EQASSOC (54Minton A.P. Shuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhauser Boston, Inc., Cambridge, MA1994Google Scholar). Partial specific volumes of 0.73 ml/g (bFGF; 50), 0.77 ml/g (PF4-(47–70); computed from their amino composition with the program SEDNTERP (55Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L.

Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out at 50,000 rpm and 298 K in the XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge with double sector Epon-charcoal centerpieces. The data were analyzed with the program Svedberg 5.01 (56Philo J. Biophys.

Physical Biochemistry. Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1986Google Scholar), to compute the correspondings 20,w coefficients. Protein concentrations were 120 μm (PF4-(47–70)) and 30 μm (bFGF and aFGF7) in 80 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2). The absorbance distribution was scanned in time intervals of 5 min for a total experimental time of 2 h. The overall shape of bFGF and the bFGF·PF4-(47–70) complex were determined from the ratio of the translational frictional coefficient (f) to the translational frictional coefficient of the equivalent hydrated sphere (f 0).f values for bFGF and the bFGF·PF4-(47–70) complex were calculated from their molecular masses and from theirs 20,w coefficients.f 0 was estimated using a hydration coefficient of 0.3 g of H2O/g of protein (58Pessen H. Kumosinski T.F. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 219-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The frictional coefficient ratio (f/f 0) allows the calculation of a family of ellipsoids of revolution compatible with the hydrodynamic properties of the protein (59Stafford III, W.F. Szent-Györgyi A.G. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 60Waxman E. Laws W.R. Laue T.M. Nemerson Y. Ross J.A.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3005-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Since short peptides very often adopt random conformations, the possibility that PF4-(47–70) has a defined structure was first tested by far-UV CD. Fig. 1 shows that the CD spectrum of PF4-(47–70) is typical of helical polypeptides, in contrast to predictions using common secondary structure algorithms and to the conformation it adopts within the whole PF4 structure (23Zhang X. Chen L. Bancroft D.P. Lai C.K. Maione T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8361-8366Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 61Muñoz V. Serrano L. Biopolymers. 1997; 41: 495-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The spectrum practically remains unchanged between pH 3 and 10 and between 298 and 358 K (Fig. 1). The spectrum is not altered by the addition of strong polyanions like myo-inositol hexasulfate (MIHS), at the concentrations used to emulate heparin in mitogenic assays (72 μm; not shown (62Lozano R.M. Jimenez M. Santoro J. Rico M. Gimenez-Gallego G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 899-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)). Based on the molar ellipticity at 222 nm (63Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar), the helix content of the secondary structure of PF4-(47–70) is ∼46% in all the aforementioned conditions. In the presence of 8 m guanidinium chloride the spectrum of PF4-(47–70) shifts to that generally observed for a random coil and regains its original shape as the denaturant is progressively diluted out, at least at pH 7 (data not shown). Judging from the increased molar ellipticity at 222 nm (Fig. 1), the helix content increases to almost 100% upon addition of TFE to a final concentration of ∼25% (v/v). A 50% of helix content was reached at TFE concentration of 1–2% (not shown). Several NMR parameters provide information on the structure of peptides in solution. The most conclusive evidence for the existence of preferred structures in peptides comes from the NOE connectivities, particularly from the non-sequential ones. Since an NOE peak between two protons is observed when they are spatially close irrespective of their sequence proximity, the presence of non-sequential NOE cross-correlations indicates significant populations of preferred conformations. According to the 1H NMR spectra, the association state of PF4-(47–70) does not change when its concentration is lowered from 3.2 to 0.32 mm, where equilibrium sedimentation experiments show that PF4-(47–70) is a monomer (see below). Fig.2 A (top) shows the primary structure of PF4-(47–70) (PF4 numbering scheme) and a summary of the NOE connectivities observed for PF4-(47–70) in aqueous solution. Apart from the sequential NOE connectivities used for assignment, a number of non-sequential NOE cross-peaks, dαNi,i+2 and dαNi,i+3, were also observed. These NOEs, together with a few non-sequential i, i + 3, and i, i + 4 NOE connectivities involving side chain protons, indicate the presence of α-helical conformations in PF4-(47–70), in agreement with the far-UV CD data. Excluding the N- and C-terminal residues, the conformational deviations of the measured chemical shifts (δ-values) for the CαH protons from random coil values"

In <i>Dictyostelium</i>, Skp1 is modified by a pentasaccharide containing the type 1 blood group H trisaccharide at its core. To address how the third sugar, fucose α1,2-linked to galactose, is attached, a proteomics strategy was applied to determine the primary structure of FT85, previously shown to copurify with the GDP-Fuc:Skp1 α1,2-fucosyltransferase. Tryptic-generated peptides of FT85 were sequenced <i>de novo</i> using Q-TOF tandem mass spectrometry. Degenerate primers were used to amplify FT85 genomic DNA, which was further extended by a novel linker polymerase chain reaction method to yield an intronless open reading frame of 768 amino acids. Disruption of the <i>FT85</i> gene by homologous recombination resulted in viable cells, which had altered light scattering properties as revealed by flow cytometry. FT85 was necessary and sufficient for Skp1 fucosylation, based on biochemical analysis of FT85 mutant cells and <i>Escherichia coli</i> that express FT85 recombinantly. FT85 lacks sequence motifs that characterize all other known α1,2-fucosyltransferases and lacks the signal-anchor sequence that targets them to the secretory pathway. The C-terminal region of FT85 harbors motifs found in inverting Family 2 glycosyltransferase domains, and its expression in FT85 mutant cells restores fucosyltransferase activity toward a simple disaccharide substrate. Whereas most prokaryote and eukaryote Family 2 glycosyltransferases are membrane-bound and oriented toward the cytoplasm where they glycosylate lipid-linked or polysaccharide precursors prior to membrane translocation, the soluble, eukaryotic Skp1-fucosyltransferase modifies a protein that resides in the cytoplasm and nucleus."

https://openalex.org/W2016249990,"Survival of patients with Glioblastoma Multiforme (GM), a highly malignant brain tumor, remains poor despite concerted efforts to improve therapy. The median survival of patients with GM has remained approximately 1 year regardless of the therapeutic approach. Since radiation therapy is the most effective adjuvant therapy for GM and nearly half of GM tumors harbor p53 mutations, we sought to identify genes that mediate p53-independent apoptosis of GM cells in response to ionizing radiation. Using broad-scale gene expression analysis we found that following radiation treatment, TRADD expression was induced in a uniquely radiosensitive GM cell line but not in radioresistant GM cell lines. TRADD over-expression killed GM cells and activated NF-kappa B. We found that blocking the TRADD-mediated pathway using a dominant-negative mutant of FADD (FADD-DN) enhanced radiation resistance of GM cells, as reflected in both susceptibility to apoptosis and clonogenic survival following irradiation. Conversely, stable expression of exogenous TRADD enhanced radiation-induced apoptosis of GM cell lines, reflecting the biological significance of TRADD regulation in p53-independent apoptosis. These findings generate interest in utilizing TRADD in gene therapy for GM tumors, particularly in light of its dual function of directly inducing rapid apoptosis and sensitizing GM cells to standard anti-neoplastic therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2079322473,"The rapid transcriptional activation of heat shock genes in response to stress is crucial for the cellular survival and the development of thermotolerance. Although heat shock response is a widespread phenomenon, certain cells exhibit a diminished induction of heat shock gene expression upon stress stimuli. Here we have analyzed the development of thermotolerance and induction of distinct Hsp70 encoding genes in three cell lines representing different hematopoietic cell types. We show that in response to heat shock, cell survival and induction of thermotolerance are impaired in Raji and HL60 cells, as compared with K562 cells. Accordingly, transcriptional induction of the hsp70 gene is diminished in Raji and HL60 cells. This appears to be due to inability of transcription factors, including HSF1 to bind to the hsp70.1 promoter <i>in vivo</i>. Consistent with the genomic footprint, analysis of hsp70.1 mRNA expression using a specific 3′-untranslated region probe reveals that induction of the hsp70.1 gene upon heat shock is completely abolished in Raji and HL60 cells. The suppression of the hsp70.1 promoter is not caused by impaired function of HSF1, since HSF1 is equally activated in all cell types and occupies another heat-inducible promoter, hsp90α. Furthermore, among distinct inducible hsp70 genes, suppression seems to be specific for the hsp70.1 gene, since heat shock results in induction of hsp70.2 and hsp70B′ mRNA expression in all cell lines. Taken together, our results demonstrate that distinct Hsp70-encoding genes contribute to the heat shock response in a cell type-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2334129675,"Cyclin-dependent kinase 6(cdk6) is present in randomly proliferating cultures of 3T3 cells but has little detectable enzymatic activity. Significant activity is detected only during a short period in early G1 phase. To examine the possible functions of cdk6 in 3T3 cells, lines stably over-expressing cdk6 were constructed and compared to normal 3T3 cells or cell lines with reduced cdk6 levels due to expression of a dominant-negative form of the protein. Over-expression of cdk6 in cells, which led to high levels of activity even in proliferating cultures, had dramatic effects. Cell lines stably over-expressing wild-type cdk6 had a markedly reduced growth rate compared to parental 3T3 cells or lines expressing a dominant-negative form of cdk6. They also over-produced the p53 and p130 proteins and had increased sensitivity to UV-irradiation. Irradiation resulted in accumulation of the Bax protein and rapid cell death. Levels of p53 and p130 proteins were down-regulated and the growth rate of the cells was increased by introduction of the dominant-negative form of cdk6 into cells over-expressing cdk6, indicating that cdk6 is involved in the overproduction of p53 and p130. The results suggest that cdk6, through regulation of growth-suppressing molecules, may play a role in halting cellular growth when proliferation is inappropriate."
https://openalex.org/W2042933944,"mRNA degradation is a regulated process that can play an important role in determining the level of expression of specific genes. The rate at which a specific mRNA is degraded depends largely on specific cis-acting sequences located throughout the transcript. cis-Acting destabilizer sequences that promote increased rates of decay have been identified in several short-lived mRNAs. However, little is known about elements that promote stability, known as stabilizer elements (STEs), and how they function. The work presented here describes the characterization of a STE in the PGK1 transcript. The PGK1 stabilizer element (P-STE) has been delineated to a 64-nucleotide sequence from the coding region that can stabilize a chimeric transcript containing the instability elements from the 3′-untranslated region of the MFA2 transcript. The P-STE is located within the PGK1 coding region and functions when located in the translated portion of the transcript and at a minimum distance from the 3′-untranslated region.

A key to understanding how a specific mRNA is degraded requires characterizing the cis-acting elements andtrans-acting factors that regulate its turnover. Studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have revealed several mRNA degradation pathways that can provide insights into how this process can be regulated. mRNA degradation might initiate by endonucleolytic cleavage (1Presutti C. Villa T. Hall D. Pertica C. Bozzoni I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4022-4030Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), loss of the cap and subsequent 5′ → 3′ exonucleolytic digestion (2Muhlrad D. Parker R. Nature. 1994; 370: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), or deadenylation, which can be followed either by 3′ → 5′ exonucleolytic degradation or decapping and 5′ → 3′ exonucleolytic degradation (3Caponigro G.

However, many wild-type yeast mRNAs that have been investigated decay through the pathway that initiates with the shortening of the poly(A) tail to an oligo(A) form. Removal of the poly(A) tail triggers rapid decapping of the transcript by the Dcp1p and subsequent degradation of the body of the transcript by a 5′ → 3′ exoribonuclease, Xrn1p (reviewed in Ref. 7Jacobson A.

These instability elements have been identified by their ability to promote rapid decay when transferred to an appropriate location within inherently stable mRNAs or by mutational analysis. For example, the MFA2 mRNA is very unstable, with a half-life of 3 min (15Herrick D. Parker R. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Previous studies have determined that the sequences responsible for the destabilization of MFA2 were localized to the 3′-UTR1 and that they function by promoting increased rates of deadenylation, which is followed by decapping and 5′ → 3′ decay (2Muhlrad D. Parker R. Nature. 1994; 370: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In the case of the MATα1 transcript, a 65-nt instability element (MIE) is located in the protein coding region of the transcript and requires translation in order to be functional (17Parker R. Jacobson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2780-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a given transcript can have multiple destabilizer sequences, suggesting that the process of targeting an mRNA for degradation can be redundant (reviewed in Ref. 18Peltz S.W. Jacobson A. Brawerman G. Belasco J. Control of mRNA Stability. Academic Press, New York1993: 291-328Google Scholar). In addition to instability elements, a few examples of stabilizer elements that block rapid mRNA decay have been identified (19Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 20Peltz S.W. Brown A.H. Jacobson A.

In mammals, a sequence in the 3′-UTR of the α-globin transcript slows down poly(A) shortening and rapid decay of the mRNA (23Wang Z. Day N. Trifillis P. Kiledjian M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4552-4560Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In yeast, two types of sequences that promote specific stabilization of nonsense-containing transcripts have been described. Transcripts containing premature nonsense codons are rapidly degraded via the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. Using the PGK1 and HIS4 transcripts, it was shown that rapid decay takes place only if the nonsense mutation occurs approximately within the first two thirds of the transcript and that 3′-proximal nonsense mutations are resistant to the NMD pathway (20Peltz S.W. Brown A.H. Jacobson A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1737-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 24Hagan K.W. Ruiz-Echevarrı́a M.J. Quan Y. Peltz S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 809-823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that specific sequences in the last third of the PGK1 transcript confer resistance to NMD when translated. A second sequence that promotes stabilization of nonsense-containing transcripts was identified in the leader region of the GCN4 mRNA (21Ruiz-Echevarrı́a M.J. González C.I. Peltz S.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 575-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 25Ruiz-Echevarrı́a M.J. Peltz S.W. Cell. 2000; 101: 741-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This sequence inactivates the NMD pathway when positioned 3′ of a nonsense codon. A stabilizer sequence that inactivates the deadenylation-dependent decay pathway has been found in the stable PGK1 mRNA (19Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The experimental approach involved constructing chimeric genes harboring the PGK1 gene fused with portions of an unstable mRNA. Studies with chimeric genes containing the PGK1 coding region and the MFA2 3′-UTR demonstrated that the MFA2 3′-UTR could not destabilize an intact PGK1 mRNA (19Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the PGK1-MFA2 chimeric transcript was stabilized as an oligoadenylated form, suggesting that the stabilizer element protects the transcript from being rapidly decapped and/or from 3′ → 5′ exonucleolytic attack (19Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained using the STE3 3′-UTR, also known to contain an instability determinant (11Heaton B. Decker C. Muhlrad D. Donahue J. Jacobson A. Parker R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5365-5373Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems very likely that stabilizer elements occur in other stable transcripts. In this work, we have mapped and characterized the stability element in the PGK1 transcript (P-STE). The results presented here indicate that a 65-nt sequence from the PGK1 coding region promotes stabilization of a PGK1-MFA2 chimeric transcript. Furthermore, a larger region that contains this element also stabilizes a PGK1-STE3 chimera. The P-STE functions only when located in the translated portion of the transcript and not immediately proximal to the MFA2 3′-UTR. In addition, we have identified a sequence similar with the P-STE in the TEF1/2 transcript that promotes stabilization of a PGK1-MFA2 chimeric transcript. Taken together, these results indicate that we have identified a general stability determinant that can modulate the stability of mRNAs.

The various hybrid PGK1-MFA2 andPGK1-STE3 alleles were transformed into strains harboring the temperature-sensitive allele of the RNA polymerase II (rpb1–1) and the mRNA decay rates were determined by Northern analyses as described previously (20Peltz S.W.

All numbering includes this sequence plus the coding region bases as detailed in Peltz et al. (20Peltz S.W. Brown A.H. Jacobson A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1737-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The yeast centromeric plasmid pRIP was used as vector for all the alleles constructed and was cleaved with BamHI and HindIII. The MFA2 3′-UTR present in many of the constructs shown below was synthesized by polymerase chain reaction reaction using the appropriate oligonucleotides as primers and plasmid pRP455 (32Beelman C.A. Parker R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9687-9692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as template. The PGK1 fragments of the constructs shown in this study were derived from plasmids pRIPPGK(−AU)H2(3)UAA, pRIPPGK(−AU)AspUAA, pRIPPGK(−AU)H2(2)UAA, and pRIPPGK(−AU)H2(1)UAA (24Hagan K.W. Ruiz-Echevarrı́a M.J. Quan Y. Peltz S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 809-823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) harboring the PGK1gene with UAA stop codons at 5.6%, 39%, 55%, and 67% of the PGK1 coding region, respectively, or from pRIPPGK(−AU) (20Peltz S.W. Brown A.H. Jacobson A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1737-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), which harbors the wild-type PGK1 gene. In Fig. 1, constructs 1A–1D were prepared by digestion of the PGK1 UAA-containing alleles withHpaI, which cut a few nucleotides downstream of the UAA stop codon, and inserting the MFA2 3′-UTR at this position in the various alleles. The constructs shown in Fig. 1 B were prepared by digestion of the PGK1 UAA-containing alleles with BglII, which cuts at 92% of the PGK1 coding region and insertion of the MFA2 3′-UTR at this position in the various alleles. In Fig. 2, construct 2A is identical to 1C. To prepare construct 2B, plasmid pRIPPGK(−AU)H2 (2Muhlrad D. Parker R. Nature. 1994; 370: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar)UAA was digested withHincII (at position 1138 of the PGK1 coding region) andHindIII (downstream of the PGK1 transcription terminator region) and inserting at that position the MFA2 3′-UTR. Construct 2C was prepared from construct 2B by substituting the 159 nt (nt 979–1138) of the PGK1 coding region for 159 nt (nt 393–552) from the GCN4 leader region. Construct 2D was derived from plasmid pRIPPGK(−AU)H2(2)UAA by inserting the MFA2 3′-UTR into its unique BglII site (at 92% of the protein coding region) and deleting the 159-nt fragment from nt positions 979–1138. To prepare construct 2E, plasmid pRIPPGK(−AU)AspUAA was partially digested withHincII (to cut only at position 1138 of the PGK1 coding region) and HindIII (downstream of the PGK1 transcription terminator region) and the MFA2 3′-UTR was inserted at that position. Construct 2F was prepared from construct 2E by substituting the 159 nt (nt 979–1138) of the PGK1 coding region for 159 nt (nt 393–552) from the GCN4 leader region. In Fig. 3, constructs 3A and 3B were prepared by digestion of plasmids pRIPPGK(−AU)H2(3)UAA and pRIPPGK(−AU)H2(1)UAA, respectively, with BglII (cuts at 92% of the PGK1 coding region) and insertion of the STE3 3′-UTR at this position. The fragment harboring the STE3 3′-UTR was synthesized by polymerase chain reaction using the appropriate oligonucleotides as primers and total yeast DNA as template. All the constructs depicted in Figs. 4 and 5 carry the MFA2gene under control of the PGK1 promoter. Constructs 4A–4C contain the PGK1 sequences from nt 789 to 1138, inserted at the uniqueBamHI site located 4 nt upstream of the MFA2 stop codon. In construct 4A, the PGK1 fragment is inserted in frame with the MFA2 sequence. In construct 4B, the PGK1 fragment contains a UAA stop codon at the position corresponding to nt 979 of the PGK1 sequence. In construct 4C, the stop codon is located at nt position 789 of the PGK1 sequence. Construct 4D was prepared by replacing the PGK1 sequences in construct 4A with PGK1 sequences from nt 302 to 652. Construct 5A contains the TEF1 sequences from nt 1080 to 1409 (numbering starts at the AUG of the coding region, and this segment includes 32 nt 3′ of the TEF1 stop codon) inserted at the unique BamHI site located 4 nt upstream of the MFA2 stop codon in frame with the MFA2 coding sequence. Construct 5B was prepared by replacing the 190-nt P-STE (nt 789–879) in construct 4B with the TEF1 sequences from 1117 to 1176, harboring the region of homology to the P-STE in frame with MFA2. This sequence is 100% identical between TEF1 andTEF2, the second gene encoding translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A). TheMFA2 gene encodes an inherently unstable transcript with a half-life of 3 min (15Herrick D. Parker R. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The sequences responsible for the destabilization of the MFA2 mRNA have been localized to the 3′-UTR (33Muhlrad D. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2100-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, a chimeric PGK1-MFA2 mRNA, in which the PGK1 3′-UTR was replaced with that from MFA2 transcript, encodes a stable mRNA that lacks the poly(A) tail (19Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). This result is consistent with previous observations demonstrating that the poly(A)-deficient form of the PGK1 transcript is stable (34Vreken P. Raue H.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These and other observations suggested that the coding region of the PGK1gene contains a stabilizer element (P-STE) that blocks decapping of the mRNA when translated. Our goal was to identify and characterize the P-STE in the PGK1 transcript. The boundaries of the P-STE were initially defined by deletion analysis of the stable PGK1-MFA2 transcript. The deletions were constructed by inserting a termination codon at four different locations within the PGK1 protein coding region and deleting the region 3′ of the termination codon. The MFA2 3′-UTR that includes the region required for rapid mRNA decay, as well as the cleavage and polyadenylation sites, was inserted immediately 3′ of the termination codon (Fig.1 A). These alleles were transferred to yeast centromere plasmids and transformed into aupf1Δ strain harboring the rpb1–1temperature-sensitive allele of the RNA polymerase II. mRNA decay rates were determined by RNA blotting analyses (see “Materials and Methods”). Half-life measurements were performed in aupf1Δ strain to eliminate any effect of the NMD pathway that could result from the introduction of premature termination codons. The results of these experiments indicated that transcripts harboring the amino-terminal 55% of the PGK1 coding sequences (up to nt position 979) were rapidly degraded, with half-lives of 3 to 6 min (Fig. 1 A, constructs 1A–1C). A hybrid transcript harboring 67.7% of the PGK1 coding sequences encoded a moderately stable mRNA with a half-life of 18 min, indicating the presence of a STE (Fig. 1 A, construct 1D). Replacing the MFA2 3′-UTR with the PGK1 3′-UTR resulted in stabilization of all these transcripts, indicating that the instability observed is due to the MFA2 3′-UTR (20; data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that there is a sequence within the first two thirds (67.7%) of the PGK1 transcript that blocks rapid degradation of the PGK1-MFA2 chimeric transcript. The function of several cis-acting instability elements requires ribosome translocation up to or through the element (Ref. 35Hennigan A.N. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3833-3843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; reviewed in Refs. 7Jacobson A. Peltz S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 693-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 36Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and 37Theodorakis N.G. Cleveland D.W. Hersey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1996: 631-652Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we explored whether translation is required for the P-STE to be functional. As a first test, translation was disrupted by inserting in-frame nonsense codons at four different locations within the PGK1 protein coding region and the decay rate of the PGK1-MFA2 mRNA was determined in a upf1Δ strain (Fig.1 B, constructs 1E–1H). APGK1-MFA2 chimeric gene was constructed by inserting the MFA2 3′-UTR into a unique BglII site located at 92.6% of the PGK1 coding region. A premature stop codon was inserted at 5.6%, 39%, 55%, and 67.7% of the PGK1 coding region (Fig. 1 B,constructs 1E–1H, respectively). Therefore, although the size of the transcripts is equivalent, the amount of the PGK1protein coding region that is translated is different in each allele. mRNA decay rates were determined in a upf1Δstrain harboring the rpb1–1 ts allele of RNA polymerase II. The results demonstrated that, relative to translation of the entire PGK1 mRNA, translation termination after 5.6% or 39% of the PGK1 coding region, respectively, promoted destabilization of the PGK1-MFA2 transcript (half-life of 6 and 8 min, respectively; Fig. 1 B,constructs 1E and 1F). However, location of premature nonsense mutations following 55% or greater of the PGK1 coding region remained stable with a half-life of greater than 25 min (Fig. 1 B, constructs 1G and1H). Therefore, translation of up to 55% of the coding region is sufficient to promote stabilization of the PGK1-MFA2 mRNA when the C-terminal part of the transcript is also present. The results obtained above indicated that the MFA2 3′-UTR does not promote rapid decay if 55% (nt 979) or greater of the PGK1 protein coding region is translated (Fig.1 B). Interestingly, these results seem in conflict with the results shown in Fig. 1 A, in which insertion of the MFA2 3′-UTR at 55% of the protein coding region promoted accelerated mRNA decay (Fig. 1, A (construct 1C) compared with B (construct 1G)). This raises the possibility that the P-STE is upstream of nt 979 (55%) and that either: (i) it requires a specific sequence 3′ of a translation termination codon, or (ii) there needs to be a certain amount of sequence between the P-STE and the instability element in the 3′-UTR. To test which of these hypotheses is valid, the following constructs were prepared. In these constructs, a nonsense mutation at position 979 (at 55% of the PGK1 protein coding region) was inserted, and the amount of sequence immediately downstream of the termination codon was varied. In construct 2A (identical toconstruct 1C in Fig. 1 A), the nonsense codon is immediately followed by the MFA2 3′-UTR. In construct 2B, the MFA2 3′-UTR was inserted at position 1138 of the PGK1 coding sequence and therefore it contains the 159 nt naturally located 3′ of nt 979. Construct 2C is similar to construct 2B, except that the 159 nt 3′ of the nonsense mutation correspond to a fragment from the GCN4 leader sequence. This construct serves as a control to determine whether a specific sequence 3′ of the termination codon is required for the P-STE to function. In construct 2D, the MFA2 3′-UTR was inserted at position 1449 of the PGK1 coding region and the sequences between positions 979 and 1138 were deleted; therefore, it contains 311 nt of"
