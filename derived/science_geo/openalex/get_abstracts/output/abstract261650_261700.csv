https://openalex.org/W1976421227,"Primary cilium dysfunction underlies the pathogenesis of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), a genetic disorder whose symptoms include obesity, retinal degeneration, and nephropathy. However, despite the identification of 12 BBS genes, the molecular basis of BBS remains elusive. Here we identify a complex composed of seven highly conserved BBS proteins. This complex, the BBSome, localizes to nonmembranous centriolar satellites in the cytoplasm but also to the membrane of the cilium. Interestingly, the BBSome is required for ciliogenesis but is dispensable for centriolar satellite function. This ciliogenic function is mediated in part by the Rab8 GDP/GTP exchange factor, which localizes to the basal body and contacts the BBSome. Strikingly, Rab8(GTP) enters the primary cilium and promotes extension of the ciliary membrane. Conversely, preventing Rab8(GTP) production blocks ciliation in cells and yields characteristic BBS phenotypes in zebrafish. Our data reveal that BBS may be caused by defects in vesicular transport to the cilium."

Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) integrates signals from integrin and growth factor receptors to regulate cellular responses including cell adhesion, migration, and survival. Here, we describe crystal structures representing both autoinhibited and active states of FAK. The inactive structure reveals a mechanism of inhibition in which the N-terminal FERM domain directly binds the kinase domain, blocking access to the catalytic cleft and protecting the FAK activation loop from Src phosphorylation. Additionally, the FERM domain sequesters the Tyr397 autophosphorylation and Src recruitment site, which lies in the linker connecting the FERM and kinase domains. The active phosphorylated FAK kinase adopts a conformation that is immune to FERM inhibition. Our biochemical and structural analysis shows how the architecture of autoinhibited FAK orchestrates an activation sequence of FERM domain displacement, linker autophosphorylation, Src recruitment, and full catalytic activation.

Focal adhesions are integrin-mediated points of contact between the cell surface and the extracellular matrix. Coordinated assembly and disassembly of focal adhesions as well as intracellular signaling from these sites modulate cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, differentiation, and survival in response to cues in the extracellular milieu (Bershadsky et al., 2003Bershadsky A.D.

Focal adhesion kinase (FAK, gene name ptk2) is a central node in the signaling network emanating from focal adhesions (Mitra et al., 2005Mitra S.K. Hanson D.A. Schlaepfer D.D.

FAK is at once a signaling switch and a signaling scaffold; engagement of integrins and growth factor receptors on the cell surface induces catalytic activation of FAK and also promotes its recruitment and activation of Src kinases and other signaling proteins. FAK is ubiquitously expressed and is required for diverse developmental processes including neuronal pathfinding and epithelial and vascular morphogenesis (Nikolopoulos and Giancotti, 2005Nikolopoulos S.N.

FAK-deficient mouse embryos are not viable due to a poorly developed vascular system (Ilic et al., 1995Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M.

FAK overexpression in invasive tumors and its probable role in metastasis have made it a target for the development of anticancer drugs (Cohen and Guan, 2005aCohen L.A. Guan J.L.

FAK and the closely related proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2, also known as CAKβ) share a domain structure that includes an N-terminal FERM (band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin homology) domain, followed by an ∼40 residue linker region, a central kinase domain, an ∼220 residue proline-rich low-complexity region, and a C-terminal focal adhesion targeting (FAT) domain (Figure 1A). The FAT domain consists of a four-helix bundle (Arold et al., 2002Arold S.T. Hoellerer M.K. Noble M.E.

The FERM domain is a three-lobed protein-interaction domain (Pearson et al., 2000Pearson M.A. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Karplus P.A.

The precise mechanisms by which cell-surface receptors initiate FAK activation are not clear, but integrin or growth factor activation induces FAK to autophosphorylate on Tyr397 within the linker (Schaller et al., 1994Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D.

Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated Tyr397 site and a nearby “PxxP” motif recruit and activate Src via binding to its SH2 and SH3 domains, and Src in turn phosphorylates Tyr576 and Tyr577 in the activation loop of the FAK kinase (Calalb et al., 1995Calalb M.B.

Among the major classes of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, which are all thought to be regulated by intramolecular domain interactions, a structural level understanding is only available for Src (Sicheri and Kuriyan, 1997Sicheri F.

Structural basis for the autoinhibition of c-Abl tyrosine kinase.Cell. 2003; 112: 859-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) kinases, which share a related SH3-SH2-Kinase regulatory apparatus (Harrison, 2003Harrison S.C. Variation on an Src-like theme.Cell. 2003; 112: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Other major classes with divergent domain architectures, including ZAP-70/Syk (SH2-SH2-Kinase domains) and Jak-family kinases (FERM-SH2-Pseudokinase-Kinase domains) in addition to FAK, have not been previously described. In order to understand the structural basis for FAK regulation and to elucidate general principles underlying regulation of nonreceptor kinases, we determined the structure of a large fragment of FAK, containing the FERM and kinase domains, in an autoinhibited state. The structure reveals that the autoinhibited assembly is stabilized through an interaction between the FERM domain and the kinase C-lobe, and we show that disruption of this interaction activates the kinase. Strikingly, a section of the linker region that contains the autophosphorylation site Tyr397 is positioned far from the active site between the FERM domain and the kinase N-lobe. We demonstrate that the autoinhibited assembly indeed prevents autophosphorylation of Tyr397 and also blocks Src phosphorylation of the activation loop. Our structural and biochemical analysis of the FAK kinase in an active, Src-phosphorylated state shows that once the activation loop is phosphorylated, the kinase is no longer subject to inhibition by the FERM domain. We crystallized a large fragment of avian FAK containing the FERM, linker, and kinase domains in an inactive, nonphosphorylated conformation. The 2.8 Å resolution structure reveals a compact assembly with extensive interactions among the FERM, kinase, and linker regions (Figure 1B). In this autoinhibited state, the three-lobed FERM domain bridges between the N- and C-lobes of the kinase domain, extending across the active site cleft. The major contact between the two domains is formed between the F2 lobe of the FERM domain and the C-lobe of the kinase domain. A portion of the linker segment containing the Tyr397 autophosphorylation site binds to a groove on the F1 lobe of the FERM domain and also makes a glancing contact with the N-terminal lobe of the kinase domain. We find the same overall conformation in two additional crystal forms of autoinhibited FAK, confirming that the observed domain organization is not a happenstance of crystal packing (see Table S1 for crystallographic details). The FERM domain exhibits the characteristic three-lobed architecture (lobes F1, F2, and F3, Figure 1B), and its structure is essentially the same as observed previously in our studies of the isolated FERM domain (Ceccarelli et al., 2006Ceccarelli D.F. Song H.K. Poy F. Schaller M.D. Eck M.J. Crystal structure of the FERM domain of focal adhesion kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) (root-mean-square deviation [rmsd] ∼1.24 Å). The Tyr397 autophosphorylation site and flanking residues in the linker form an antiparallel β strand interaction with the FERM F1 lobe. Strikingly, this contact positions the side chain of Tyr397 some 35 Å away from the catalytic cleft of the kinase. The linker then extends into the kinase N-lobe, where it is in van der Waals contact with the N-terminal end of the C-helix (αC in Figure 1B). The amino-terminal portion of the linker—including the Src SH3 docking site—is disordered in the present structure (residues 363–393). Interestingly, mutation of Lys38 in the F1 lobe has been shown to increase phosphorylation of Tyr397 (Cohen and Guan, 2005bCohen L.A. Guan J.L. Residues within the first subdomain of the FERM-like domain in focal adhesion kinase are important in its regulation.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8197-8207Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This residue is near (but does not contact) the linker, suggesting the possibility that it could destabilize the linker/FERM interaction. The kinase domain in the autoinhibited structure adopts a conformation similar to that of the isolated kinase domain in the unphosphorylated state (Nowakowski et al., 2002Nowakowski J. Cronin C.N. McRee D.E. Knuth M.W. Nelson C.G. Pavletich N.P. Rogers J. Sang B.C. Scheibe D.N. Swanson R.V. Thompson D.A.

The staurosporine compound AFN941, a broad-spectrum protein kinase inhibitor that was included to improve crystal quality, is bound in the active-site cleft in a manner analogous to that observed in other tyrosine kinases including Jak3 (Boggon et al., 2005Boggon T.J. Li Y. Manley P.W. Eck M.J. Crystal structure of the Jak3 kinase domain in complex with a staurosporine analog.Blood. 2005; 106: 996-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and Lck (Zhu et al., 1999Zhu X. Kim J.L. Newcomb J.R. Rose P.E. Stover D.R. Toledo L.M. Zhao H. Morgenstern K.A. Structural analysis of the lymphocyte-specific kinase Lck in complex with non-selective and Src family selective kinase inhibitors.Structure. 1999; 7: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The kinase activation loop adopts an inactive conformation in which it extends toward the FERM domain (near Ser46 in the F1 lobe) and is then unstructured between residues Asp573 and Leu584. Although the Tyr576 and Tyr577 phosphorylation sites in the activation loop are not visible, they must lie in the space between the active-site cleft and the F1 and F2 lobes of the FERM domain. Why is the autoinhibited structure downregulated, and how will release of the FERM/kinase interface activate the kinase? The overall structure of the FERM-linker-kinase assembly suggests multiple inhibitory mechanisms: (1) the position of the FERM domain sterically blocks access of the kinase domain to potential substrates; (2) the partially unstructured, inactive conformation of the activation loop is not expected to support binding of peptide substrates, and the FERM domain blocks the catalytically competent conformation of the unphosphorylated activation loop; (3) autophosphorylation of Tyr397 is inhibited as this segment of the linker is incorporated into a β sheet in the FERM domain ∼35 Å from the active site; and (4) Tyr576 and Tyr577 within the activation loop are “sequestered” by the FERM domain, preventing their efficient phosphorylation by Src. We confirm the relevance of these autoinhibitory mechanisms via comparisons with the active structure of the FAK kinase and via functional dissection of the FERM/kinase interface as described in the following sections. In order to better understand FAK autoinhibition and activation, we determined the structure of the isolated kinase domain in an active conformation with both Tyr576 and Tyr577 phosphorylated. The structure was determined in complex with Mg2+ and the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP at 2.3 Å resolution (see Experimental Procedures and Table S1). In this structure, the activation loop adopts a conformation very different from that in the autoinhibited structure (Figure 2A). The doubly phosphorylated loop exhibits a β-hairpin-like conformation similar to that seen in other active tyrosine kinases including the insulin receptor (Hubbard, 1997Hubbard S.R. Crystal structure of the activated insulin receptor tyrosine kinase in complex with peptide substrate and ATP analog.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), Lck (Yamaguchi and Hendrickson, 1996Yamaguchi H. Hendrickson W.A. Structural basis for activation of human lymphocyte kinase Lck upon tyrosine phosphorylation.Nature. 1996; 384: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), and Jak3 (Boggon et al., 2005Boggon T.J. Li Y. Manley P.W. Eck M.J. Crystal structure of the Jak3 kinase domain in complex with a staurosporine analog.Blood. 2005; 106: 996-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The observed conformation of the activation loop appears to be stabilized primarily by hydrogen-bond and electrostatic interactions with the phosphate group of pTyr577 (Figure 2B). The side-chain and phosphate group of pTyr576 extends into solution. Superposition of the C-lobes of the active FAK kinase on the autoinhibited structure reveals a similar overall structure for the kinase domain (rmsd = 1.44 Å) but a different conformation of the activation loop past the DFG motif (Figures 2C and S1). Whereas in the autoinhibited structure residues 567–573 in the activation loop extend toward the FERM domain and partially occlude the catalytic cleft, the activation loop in the active kinase allows free access to the active site. In many kinases, the C-helix is an integral regulatory component; it pivots out of the active-site cleft in the inactive conformation and is restored to the active position by activation loop phosphorylation and/or appropriate protein-protein interactions (Huse and Kuriyan, 2002Huse M. Kuriyan J. The conformational plasticity of protein kinases.Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). In FAK, comparison of the active and autoinhibited kinases shows that the position of the C-helix (relative to the rest of the N-lobe) does not change upon activation; it is in a position typical of active kinases in both states (Figure 2C). Thus “C-helix displacement” is not an element of FAK regulation. Additionally, a disulfide bond that was observed in the previously reported structure of the unphosphorylated kinase domain (Nowakowski et al., 2002Nowakowski J. Cronin C.N. McRee D.E. Knuth M.W. Nelson C.G. Pavletich N.P. Rogers J. Sang B.C. Scheibe D.N. Swanson R.V. Thompson D.A. Structures of the cancer-related Aurora-A, FAK, and EphA2 protein kinases from nanovolume crystallography.Structure. 2002; 10: 1659-1667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) is not present in any of our structures, active or inactive, and is therefore unlikely to play a role in FAK regulation. Superposition of the active kinase domain on the inactive structure also shows that pTyr576 and Ala579 in the phosphorylated activation loop collide with the FERM domain in the autoinhibited structure, suggesting that an active conformation of the activation loop and FERM domain inhibition would be mutually exclusive (Figure 2C). In order to dissect the interrelated roles of FERM domain engagement and activation loop conformation, we compared the in vitro catalytic activity of the crystallized FERM+kinase construct with that of the isolated kinase domain. Both proteins were prepared in defined, homogeneous phosphorylation states in which Tyr576 and Tyr577 in the activation loop were either both unphosphorylated or both phosphorylated. This experiment was performed using a Y397F mutant of the FERM+kinase protein to preclude any confounding effects due to Tyr397 phosphorylation. We find that in the absence of activation loop phosphorylation, the FERM-containing protein is approximately 5-fold less active than the isolated kinase (Figure 3). Strikingly, phosphorylation of the activation loop by Src increases the activity of the FERM+kinase protein more than 20-fold, activating it to a level equivalent to that of the isolated kinase domain in the phosphorylated state. Considering this result and the steric incompatibility of the phosphorylated activation loop and FERM engagement, we conclude that once the activation loop is phosphorylated, the FERM domain is no longer able to downregulate FAK activity in vitro. These findings suggest that in a cellular context, dephosphorylation of the FAK activation loop will be a necessary step in restoration of the autoinhibited state. There are two points of contact between the FERM and kinase domains: a glancing, indirect contact that connects the FERM F1 lobe via the linker segment to the kinase N-lobe and a more extensive and direct contact between the F2 lobe and the kinase C-lobe (Figures 1B, 4A, and 4B). The latter buries a surface area of 649 Å2 and appears to be the major source of stabilization for the autoinhibited assembly (Figure 4A). It is also highly conserved across species in both FAK and the related Pyk2 families (Figures 1C and 4C). In order to test the importance of these interactions in FAK regulation, we introduced mutations at the FERM/kinase interface and tested their effects on FAK activation and phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo. To disrupt the contact with the kinase C-lobe, we mutated either the FERM F2 lobe (Y180A, M183A double mutant) or Phe596 in the kinase domain (F596D). In the N-lobe interface, we mutated Ser463 in the kinase C-helix (S463Y; Figure 4B). We find that both the Y180A, M183A, and F596D mutants have dramatically increased kinase activity as compared with the wild-type (WT) protein in vitro (Figure 4D). Additionally, both proteins have a larger hydrodynamic radius than the WT protein as measured by size-exclusion chromatography (Figure 4E). Not unexpectedly, mutation of Ser463 in the very modest N-lobe interface only slightly increased FAK activity (Figure 4D), and this mutant eluted from the sizing column at a volume very close to that of the WT protein (Figure 4E). We expect that the larger hydrodynamic radius of the activated mutants reflects an “open” conformation in which the FERM domain is released entirely from the kinase domain, but we have not ruled out the possibility of dimerization or an alternative mode of FERM domain interaction that results in a larger hydrodynamic radius. Mutations in the FERM/kinase interface also activate full-length FAK both in vitro and in vivo. We studied the same mutants described above and also an additional activated FERM domain variant (a V196D, L197D double mutant). We transiently expressed WT or mutant FAK in 293 cells and found that activating mutations led to increased levels of autophosphorylation on Tyr397 and Src phosphorylation on Tyr576, -577, -861, and -925 (Figure 5A). We further assayed phosphorylation of recombinant paxillin by immunoprecipitated FAK proteins. All of the activated mutants readily phosphorylated paxillin, whereas the WT and S463Y proteins did so far less efficiently (Figure 5B). Importantly, the activated mutants induced higher levels of cellular tyrosine phosphorylation and also more efficiently phosphorylated coexpressed paxillin in 293 cells (Figures 5C and 5D). Finally, the activating mutants also abrogated the usual adhesion-dependence of FAK activation (Figures 5E and S2A). We confirmed that FAK and paxillin phosphorylation was indeed mediated by FAK and not Src by employing a FAK kinase dead mutant or a Src-specific kinase inhibitor (Figures S2B and S2C). Further, we confirmed that disruption of the FERM/kinase interface does not affect FAK localization to focal adhesions (Figure S3). These results demonstrate that the regulatory interactions we describe here are relevant to the full-length kinase in a cellular context. Because the Tyr397 autophosphorylation site is incorporated into a β sheet of the FERM domain and because the FERM domain apparently blocks access of Src to the activation loop, we sought to test whether protection of these sites from phosphorylation indeed contributes to FAK inhibition. We compared Tyr397 autophosphorylation of the autoinhibited, WT protein with that of the mutants that release the FERM/kinase interface (Figure 6A). In the activated mutants we expect an increase in autophosphorylation for two reasons: loss of repression of the kinase domain and also exposure of the Tyr397 phosphorylation site. To distinguish between these effects, we included a substrate in which the Tyr397 site is fully exposed as an internal control (F–L, which contains the FERM and linker regions of FAK, residues 31–405). We find that both the F596D and Y180A, M183A FERM+kinase mutants autophosphorylate their Tyr397 site as efficiently as they phosphorylate the exposed Y397 in the control substrate (Figure 6A). In contrast, in the inhibited FERM+kinase proteins (WT and S463Y) autophosphorylation was markedly less efficient than Tyr397 phosphorylation of the control substrate. Hence, we conclude that Tyr397, as positioned in autoinhibited FAK, is indeed protected from autophosphorylation, and that this protection is lost when the FERM domain is released from the kinase. It remains unclear whether physiologically relevant autophosphorylation of Tyr397 occurs in cis, in trans, or by both mechanisms, but kinase-inactive FAK can clearly be transphosphorylated on Tyr397 in vivo (Leu and Maa, 2002Leu T.H.

For preservation purposes, a large portion of these collections has been fixed in formalin-containing solutions, a treatment that results in cross-linking of biomolecules. Cross-linking not only complicates isolation of nucleic acid but also introduces polymerase ""blocks"" during PCR. A wide variety of methods exists for the recovery of DNA and RNA from archival tissues, and although a number of previous studies have qualitatively compared the relative merits of the different techniques, very few have undertaken wide scale quantitative comparisons. To help address this issue, we have undertaken a study that investigates the quality of nucleic acids recovered from a test panel of fixed specimens that have been manipulated following a number of the published protocols. These include methods of pre-treating the samples prior to extraction, extraction and nucleic acid purification methods themselves, and a post-extraction enzymatic repair technique. We find that although many of the published methods have distinct positive effects on some characteristics of the nucleic acids, the benefits often come at a cost. In addition, a number of the previously published techniques appear to have no effect at all. Our findings recommend that the extraction methodology adopted should be chosen carefully. Here we provide a quick reference table that can be used to determine appropriate protocols for particular aims."
https://openalex.org/W2006717582,"Age-related neurodegenerative disease has been mechanistically linked with mitochondrial dysfunction via damage from reactive oxygen species produced within the cell. We determined whether increased mitochondrial oxidative stress could modulate or regulate two of the key neurochemical hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD): tau phosphorylation, and ß-amyloid deposition. Mice lacking superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) die within the first week of life, and develop a complex heterogeneous phenotype arising from mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Treatment of these mice with catalytic antioxidants increases their lifespan and rescues the peripheral phenotypes, while uncovering central nervous system pathology. We examined sod2 null mice differentially treated with high and low doses of a catalytic antioxidant and observed striking elevations in the levels of tau phosphorylation (at Ser-396 and other phospho-epitopes of tau) in the low-dose antioxidant treated mice at AD-associated residues. This hyperphosphorylation of tau was prevented with an increased dose of the antioxidant, previously reported to be sufficient to prevent neuropathology. We then genetically combined a well-characterized mouse model of AD (Tg2576) with heterozygous sod2 knockout mice to study the interactions between mitochondrial oxidative stress and cerebral Aß load. We found that mitochondrial SOD2 deficiency exacerbates amyloid burden and significantly reduces metal levels in the brain, while increasing levels of Ser-396 phosphorylated tau. These findings mechanistically link mitochondrial oxidative stress with the pathological features of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2011385800,"BACE1 activity is significantly increased in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients, potentially contributing to neurodegeneration. The voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav1) β2-subunit (β2), a type I membrane protein that covalently binds to Nav1 α-subunits, is a substrate for BACE1 and γ-secretase. Here, we find that BACE1–γ-secretase cleavages release the intracellular domain of β2, which increases mRNA and protein levels of the pore-forming Nav1.1 α-subunit in neuroblastoma cells. Similarly, endogenous β2 processing and Nav1.1 protein levels are elevated in brains of BACE1-transgenic mice and Alzheimer's disease patients with high BACE1 levels. However, Nav1.1 is retained inside the cells and cell surface expression of the Nav1 α-subunits and sodium current densities are markedly reduced in both neuroblastoma cells and adult hippocampal neurons from BACE1-transgenic mice. BACE1, by cleaving β2, thus regulates Nav1 α-subunit levels and controls cell-surface sodium current densities.

https://openalex.org/W2003345607,"The budding yeast histone H3 variant, Cse4, replaces conventional histone H3 in centromeric chromatin and, together with centromere-specific DNA-binding factors, directs assembly of the kinetochore, a multiprotein complex mediating chromosome segregation. We have identified Scm3, a nonhistone protein that colocalizes with Cse4 and is required for its centromeric association. Bacterially expressed Scm3 binds directly to and reconstitutes a stoichiometric complex with Cse4 and histone H4 but not with conventional histone H3 and H4. A conserved acidic domain of Scm3 is responsible for directing the Cse4-specific interaction. Strikingly, binding of Scm3 can replace histones H2A-H2B from preassembled Cse4-containing histone octamers. This incompatibility between Scm3 and histones H2A-H2B is correlated with diminished in vivo occupancy of histone H2B, H2A, and H2AZ at centromeres. Our findings indicate that nonhistone Scm3 serves to assemble and maintain Cse4-H4 at centromeres and may replace histone H2A-H2B dimers in a centromere-specific nucleosome core."

In one example, normal cells eliminate “Minute” cells that have reduced ribosomal protein gene dose and grow at their expense, replacing the Minute cells within developing compartments. We describe genes that are required by wild-type cells to kill Minute neighbors in Drosophila. The engulfment genes draper, wasp, the phosphatidylserine receptor, mbc/dock180, and rac1 are needed in wild-type cells for the death of Minute neighbors, whose corpses are engulfed by wild-type cells. Wild-type cells can themselves be killed by cells with elevated engulfing activity.

Wild-type cells can themselves be killed by cells with elevated engulfing activity. Thus engulfment genes act downstream of growth differences between cells to eliminate cells with reduced ribosomal gene dose. When two genotypes of cell are present in a chimeric individual, cell competition can favor one over the other, leading this genotype to replace the other during organ growth. Cell competition was first recognized when mitotic recombination regenerated wild-type cells in Drosophila heterozygous for a “Minute” mutation (Morata and Ripoll, 1975Morata G. Ripoll P. Minutes: Mutants of Drosophila autonomously affecting cell division rate.Dev. Biol. 1975; 42: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Minute mutations represent unlinked loci encoding ribosomal proteins or other protein-synthesis components. They share a similar dominant mutant phenotype, due to haplo-insufficiency, including slow growth and reduced translational capacity. Minute heterozygotes eventually make normal-size cells and adults despite the smaller bristles that give the Minute syndrome its name (Morata and Ripoll, 1975Morata G. Ripoll P.

Wild-type cells are expected to grow faster than M/+ cells, but in mosaics wild-type clones can fill developing compartments, eliminating the M/+ cells that were initially in the majority (Morata and Ripoll, 1975Morata G. Ripoll P. Minutes: Mutants of Drosophila autonomously affecting cell division rate.Dev. Biol. 1975; 42: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Wild-type clones do not cross compartment boundaries, however (Garcia-Bellido et al., 1973Garcia-Bellido A. Ripoll P. Morata G. Developmental compartmentalisation of the wing disk of Drosophila.Nat. New Biol. 1973; 245: 251-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The presence of M/+ cells accelerates the growth of wild-type cells within the same compartment, whereas the growth of M/+ cells is reduced when +/+ cells are present, and these interactions do not occur across compartment boundaries (Simpson, 1979Simpson P. Parameters of cell competition in the compartments of the wing disc of Drosophila.Dev. Biol. 1979; 69: 182-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, Simpson and Morata, 1981Simpson P. Morata G. Differential mitotic rates and patterns of growth in compartments in the Drosophila wing.Dev. Biol. 1981; 85: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Cell competition also occurs between cells differing in their dosage of the myc gene, and in this case cells that express more Myc become “supercompetitors” that outcompete even wild-type cells (de la Cova et al., 2004de la Cova C. Abril M. Bellosta P. Gallant P. Johnston L.A. Drosophila Myc regulates organ size by inducing cell competition.Cell. 2004; 117: 107-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, Moreno and Basler, 2004Moreno E. Basler K. dMyc transforms cells into super-competitors.Cell. 2004; 117: 117-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Cells that are mutated for the “Warts” pathway of tumor suppressors (ft, ex, hpo, sav, wts, and mts) are also supercompetitors that both outgrow wild-type cells and result in their death (Tyler et al., 2007Tyler D. Li W. Zhuo N. Pellock B. Baker N.E. Genes affecting cell competition in Drosophila.Genetics. 2007; 175: 645-657Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It is thought that cells that differ in ribosome number or myc gene dose differ in ability to capture a limiting survival factor, such as Dpp in Drosophila, and that competition for Dpp leads to death of one of the genotypes at the boundary between them (Moreno et al., 2002Moreno E.

Basler K. dMyc transforms cells into super-competitors.Cell. 2004; 117: 117-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Cell competition is also thought to occur in mammals. Mouse cells heterozygous for a ribosomal protein mutant are disproportionately disadvantaged in chimeras (Oliver et al., 2004Oliver E.R. Saunders T.L. Tarle S.A. Glaser T. Ribosomal protein L24 defect in belly spot and tail (Bst), a mouse Minute.Development. 2004; 131: 3907-3920Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Regenerating rat liver provides a further example, where transplanted fetal hepatocytes with high proliferative potential can replace host hepatocytes (Oertel et al., 2006Oertel M. Menthena A. Dabeva M.D. Shafritz D.A. Cell competition leads to a high level of normal liver reconstitution by transplanted fetal liver stem/progenitor cells.Gastroenterology. 2006; 130: 507-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Cell competition is thought to contribute to growth homeostasis by adjusting for variations that might occur during normal growth. Accordingly, organ size becomes more variable when competition is prevented (de la Cova et al., 2004de la Cova C. Abril M. Bellosta P. Gallant P. Johnston L.A. Drosophila Myc regulates organ size by inducing cell competition.Cell. 2004; 117: 107-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Cell competition is potentially important in cancer, where tumor cells might behave as supercompetitors at tumor boundaries. Consistent with this, mammalian homologs of Myc or the Warts pathway genes are associated with cancers in mammals (Nesbit et al., 1999Nesbit C.E. Tersak J.M. Prochownik E.V. MYC oncogenes and human neoplastic disease.Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3004-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, Edgar, 2006Edgar B.A. From cell structure to transcription: Hippo forges a new path.Cell. 2006; 124: 267-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Cell competition could be useful in regenerative medicine since it might prove desirable to promote the replacement of entire compartments with particular cells, without affecting other compartments. In order to learn more about the mechanism of cell competition, we have studied the programmed cell death that occurs when M/+ cells share compartments with +/+ cells in Drosophila imaginal discs. Imaginal discs are epithelial sheets that represent primordia of adult tissues during larval life (Cohen, 1993Cohen S.M. Imaginal disc development.in: Bate M. Martinez Arias A. The Development of Drosophila melanogaster. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 747-841Google Scholar). We found that cell death was essential for cell competition to occur and that cell death progressively removed M/+ cells from the interface with +/+ regions. We found that dead M/+ cell corpses were engulfed by neighboring wild-type cells rather than extruded from the epithelium and consumed by macrophages. Unexpectedly, we found that corpse engulfment was not simply a passive response to the presence of dying cells but was required for cell competition to occur. Multiple engulfment genes were required specifically in wild-type cells for the killing and elimination of M/+ cells within the same compartment. When these genes were absent, competition was prevented, and wild-type and M/+ cells coexisted within the same compartment, apparently independently. Conversely, ectopic activity could promote death and engulfment of cells that did not differ in growth rate. These studies show that +/+ cells “eat” their way through mosaic compartments, consuming M/+ cells along the way. The importance of cell death was assessed using wing imaginal discs containing both wild-type and M/+ cells obtained through mitotic recombination in M/+ larvae. Clones descended from recombinant wild-type cells spread progressively through the M/+ tissue, eventually constituting most of each compartment (Garcia-Bellido et al., 1973Garcia-Bellido A. Ripoll P. Morata G. Developmental compartmentalisation of the wing disk of Drosophila.Nat. New Biol. 1973; 245: 251-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Mitotic recombination also generates M/M cells as reciprocal recombinants to the wild-type cells. The M/M genotype is cell lethal, and such cells were not normally seen in these experiments. Death of M/M cells is not a feature of cell competition because it is not influenced by the genotype of neighboring cells. If death of M/+ cells was required to eliminate M/+ cells during cell competition, M/+ cells should persist when cell death is prevented. To test this, competition was compared in the presence and absence of the antiapoptotic baculovirus protein p35 using enGal4 to target p35 expression to posterior compartments only (Hay et al., 1994Hay B. Wolff T. Rubin G. Expression of baculovirus P35 prevents cell death in Drosophila.Development. 1994; 120: 2121-2129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Neufeld et al., 1998Neufeld T.P. de la Cruz A.F.A. Johnston L.A. Edgar B.A. Coordination of growth and cell division in the Drosophila wing.Cell. 1998; 93: 1183-1193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). M(3)96C was used in these experiments. Figure 1A shows that p35 prevented the elimination of M(3)96C/+ cells from posterior compartments, in accord with previous observations (Moreno et al., 2002Moreno E. Basler K. Morata G. Cells compete for Decapentaplegic survival factor to prevent apoptosis in Drosophila wing development.Nature. 2002; 416: 755-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Accelerated growth of wild-type regions compensates for M/+ cell loss (Simpson and Morata, 1981Simpson P. Morata G. Differential mitotic rates and patterns of growth in compartments in the Drosophila wing.Dev. Biol. 1981; 85: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The size of individual +/+ clones was measured 60 hr after induction (Figure 1B). Wild-type clones grew more rapidly in M(3)96C/+ compartments than in a nonmosaic background, but this was prevented by p35 expression. Clearly, M/+ cell death was essential to accelerate +/+ cell growth. The mechanism is distinct from compensation for cell death induced by other means, which is not sensitive to p35 (Huh et al., 2004Huh J.R. Guo M. Hay B.A. Compensatory proliferation induced by cell death in the Drosophila wing disc requires activity of the apical cell death caspase Dronc in a nonapoptotic role.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1262-1266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, Perez-Garijo et al., 2004Perez-Garijo A. Martin F.A. Morata G.

Cell. 2004; 7: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). A contribution of competitive cell death to the growth of cells overexpressing Myc has also been reported (Moreno and Basler, 2004Moreno E. Basler K. dMyc transforms cells into super-competitors.Cell. 2004; 117: 117-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Adult wing size is another measure of growth of +/+ cells. If growth of +/+ regions continues when death of M/+ cells is prevented, wings should enlarge. By contrast, if enhanced growth of +/+ clones depends on M/+ cell death, then mosaic wing compartments should approximate the normal size when cell death is prevented. Using anterior compartments as an internal control, we found that mosaic posterior compartments expressing p35 grew to the same size as nonmosaic ones, confirming that apoptosis of M/+ cells was required to enhance wild-type clone growth (Figure 1C). In these experiments, M(3)96C/+ wings contained an average of ten +/+ clones. These findings emphasize the central importance of cell death to cell competition. The location of cell death during competition was assessed as +/+ clones spread through M/+ territory. Depending on the time since recombination, large interfaces between wild-type and M/+ cells could be examined, in contrast to the situation when M/+ cells were induced in wild-type compartments and rapidly eliminated from them. Apoptotic cells were largely restricted to boundaries between wild-type and M/+ cell populations and were almost always of the M/+ genotype (Figure 2). Similar results were obtained using M(2)56F, which affects the gene for ribosomal protein RpS18; using M(3)67C, which affects RpS17; using M(2)24F, which affects RpL27A; or using M(3)96C (Figure 2 and data not shown). In the case of 361 TUNEL-positive cells in discs mosaic for M(2)56F, 94% were RpS18/+, and 71% were RpS18/+ cells next to wild-type cells. Amongst such RpS18/+ boundary cells, death was further related to the degree of exposure to wild-type cells. Only a small minority of the RpS18/+ cells were largely or entirely surrounded by wild-type cells, but 54% of these were dying (Figure 2A, arrows). For M(3)96C, 82% of M(3)96C/+ cells were positive for activated caspases when surrounded by +/+ cells compared with 6.2% of M(3)96C/+ cells at the interface with wild-type territories and 1.5% of M(3)96C/+ cells entirely surrounded by other M(3)96C/+ cells. By comparison, the frequency of apoptotic cells in nonmosaic M(3)96C/+ wing discs was 1.9% and in nonmosaic wild-type discs was 0.3%. These results argue strongly that proximity to wild-type cells promotes apoptosis of M/+ cells. The data are consistent with direct contact being responsible, as even M(3)96C/+ cells 1–3 cell diameters distant from +/+ cells were protected (1.4% apoptosis). These data do not exclude diffusible interactions of very short range, however. All cell death was prevented by p35 expression (Figure 2B). Apoptotic cells are extruded during Drosophila embryogenesis and consumed by macrophage (Abrams et al., 1993Abrams J.M. White K. Fessler L.I. Steller H. Programmed cell death during Drosophila embryogenesis.Development. 1993; 117: 29-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Tepass et al., 1994Tepass U. Fessler L.I. Aziz A. Hartenstein V.

Ezekowitz R.A. White K. Requirement for croquemort in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in Drosophila.Science. 1999; 284: 1991-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Extrusion of apoptotic cells maintains epithelial integrity while cell death occurs (Rosenblatt et al., 2001Rosenblatt J. Raff M.C. Cramer L.P. An epithelial cell destined for apoptosis signals its neighbors to extrude it by an actin- and myosin-dependent mechanism.Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1847-1857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). However, dead cells can also be engulfed by neighboring imaginal disc cells, rather than by macrophage (Fristrom, 1969Fristrom D. Cellular degeneration in the production of some mutant phenotypes in Drosophila melanogaster.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1969; 103: 363-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The fate of dead cells was characterized in more detail during cell competition. Dying cells were seen throughout the apical-basal axis of the epithelium but were more often basal (Figure 3). We did not observe dead cells extruded beneath the basal epithelial surface. Macrophages were rarely present in the wing disc, were most commonly basal to the epithelium where the wing disc folds, and were never found in contact with any dead M/+ cells (data not shown). However, we noticed cases where apoptotic material was present within neighboring, wild-type epithelial cells (Figure 3B). During interphase, the small diameter and intertwined arrangement of imaginal disc cells made it difficult to identify internalized material by light microscopy. Internalized material was clear in mitotic cells, which round up and locate apically within the epithelium (Figures 3C–3D and S1). The mitotic nature of the rounded apical cells was confirmed by labeling with an antibody against phospho-histone 3, which is specific for mitotic chromatin (Figure 3A). These data indicate that some apoptotic cells are cleared by engulfment into neighboring epithelial cells. To identify engulfed material in interphase cells, +/+ cells were positively marked by GFP expression in mosaics where M/+ cells expressed β-galactosidase. In these experiments, 84% of 176 M/+ dead cell corpses that were surrounded by +/+ cells were colabeled with GFP as well as β-galactosidase (Figures 4A–4B, arrows). As expected if the M/+ material is engulfed and fuses with lysosomes, we detected GFP within the engulfed M/+ material but never detected β-galactosidase released into the engulfing cell. Thus these apoptotic bodies were inside wild-type cells, not in between them. In the case of dying M/+ cells at the boundary with +/+ cells but not surrounded by them, individual confocal sections revealed that 11% of such cells were actually separated from other M/+ cells (Figure 4C). Sixty-eight percent of the boundary cells showed intermediate levels of GFP, higher than other M/+ cells but lower than +/+ cells (Figure 4D). These may represent early steps in engulfment. GFP was not clearly detected in the remaining 21% of dying M/+ cells in contact with +/+ cells, but some such GFP-negative cells nevertheless appeared morphologically as though they were being engulfed (Figures 4A–4C). Others may indeed be outside other cells or might have been engulfed by viable M/+ cells, which do not express GFP in this experiment. Taken together, the data show that a significant proportion of dead M/+ cells are engulfed by interphase +/+ cells within the wing disc epithelium, not basally extruded and phagocytosed by macrophage. M/+ material sometimes seen within mitotic +/+ cells may have been engulfed earlier in the cell cycle (Figure 3). Published images suggest that M/+ cells are also engulfed when small M/+ clones are introduced into a wild-type background (see Figure 3C of Tyler et al., 2007Tyler D. Li W. Zhuo N. Pellock B. Baker N.E. Genes affecting cell competition in Drosophila.Genetics. 2007; 175: 645-657Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In cell competition between cells with different Myc levels, we also observed cells that overexpress Myc engulf adjacent apoptotic wild-type cells (Figure 4E). When cell death was prevented by p35 expression, the isolated, engulfed cells were no longer observed (Figures 4F and 4G). This indicates that engulfment required caspase activation and death of M/+ cells. In order to determine the extent of corpse engulfment in another way, we sought to prevent engulfment genetically. If engulfment was a response to the presence of apoptotic corpses, then preventing engulfment should lead to the accumulation of corpses, as is often seen in C. elegans (Reddien and Horvitz, 2004Reddien P.W. Horvitz H.R. The engulfment process of programmed cell death in Caenorhabditis elegans.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 193-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Although it was not known what genes would be required for corpse engulfment by imaginal disc cells, several genes are known to be required for phagocytosis by macrophages and glia, or by cells in other organisms. Possible roles in cell competition were explored for several homologs of genes involved in corpse engulfment in C. elegans or by mammalian macrophages. One such gene was draper (drpr). draper encodes a transmembrane receptor that is related to the C. elegans engulfment receptor CED-1 (Zhou et al., 2001Zhou Z. Hartweig E. Horvitz H.R.

Kuraishi T. Shiratsuchi A. Nakai Y. Higashida H. Henson P. Nakanishi Y. Draper-mediated and phosphatidylserine-independent phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by Drosophila hemocytes/macrophages.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48466-48476Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In addition, drpr has recently been found to be required in glial cells for their engulfment of fragmented axons during Wallerian degeneration and in particular instances of axon remodeling during development (Awasaki et al., 2006Awasaki T. Tatsumi R. Takahashi K. Arai K. Nakanishi Y. Ueda R. Ito K.

We examined clones of cells homozygous for loss-of-function mutation, drprΔ5, competing with M/+ cells that were heterozygous for drprΔ5. If drprΔ5 homozygous cells could not engulf M/+ cells, we expected that apoptotic corpses of M/+ cells would accumulate. Instead, an unexpected phenotype resulted (Figures 5D and 5E). Apoptosis of M/+ cells was so reduced near drprΔ5/drprΔ5 clones in comparison to M/+ cells near wild-type clones that M/+ territories were never eliminated by drprΔ5 homozygous cells (Figures 5D, 5E, 5K, and 5L). In addition, we did not see the isolated, engulfed M/+ corpses that competition with +/+ cells was expected to produce (Figures 5I and 5J). A small number of cell deaths persisted, and almost all M/+ cells were in contact with the mutant cell clone but not enveloped by it. These cells may die without being engulfed, be arrested early in the engulfment process, or be engulfed into the M/+ cells which are not mutant for drpr in this experiment. Overall, it was as though little competition was occurring, similar to the situation when p35 expression blocked competitive apoptosis. To confirm that drpr was required for cell competition, gene function was inhibited by RNAi. Expression of dsRNA for drpr reduced death and replacement of M/+ cells within the compartment (Figure S2). These unexpected results suggested that a CED-1-like engulfment pathway was directly required in +/+ cells for them to compete with M/+ cells. Mutations in wasp were examined as a further test of the role of engulfment. This actin regulator is required for phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus by Drosophila tissue culture cells (Pearson et al., 2003Pearson A.M. Baksa K. Ramet M. Protas M. McKee M. Brown D.

We studied two independent mutations, waspEY06238 and wasp1, with identical results. Clones of cells homozygous for either wasp mutation failed to compete with M/+ cells. M/+ cell death, engulfment, and replacement were all reduced substantially (Figures 5A, 5C, 5F, 5H, 5K, and 5L).

https://openalex.org/W2078197564,"SRC-3/AIB1 is an important growth coactivator whose activity should be tightly regulated since excess activation results in oncogenesis. Herein, we provide evidence that coordinated phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination regulates SRC-3 coactivator activation and transcriptional specificity. We discovered a critical “actron/degron” element in SRC-3 that is required for this phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination event and identified GSK3 and SCFFbw7α as the respective responsible kinase and E3 ubiquitin ligase. Interestingly, despite that SCFFbw7α enhances ubiquitination and promotes eventual transcription-coupled degradation of SRC-3 in a phosphorylation- and Fbw7α dosage-dependent manner, our results also uncovered a nonproteolytic “activation” code for SRC-3 ubiquitination induced by Fbw7α. We propose that ubiquitination of SRC-3 is a phospho-mediated biphasic event and that a transition from multi-(mono)ubiquitination (SRC-3 activation) to long-chain polyubiquitination (SRC-3 degradation) is processive during the transcriptional coactivation of select transcription factors and can serve as a “transcriptional time clock” to control both the activation and the functional lifetime of coactivators."
https://openalex.org/W1967986514,"SCF ubiquitin ligases recruit substrates for degradation via F box protein adaptor subunits. WD40 repeat F box proteins, such as Cdc4 and β-TrCP, contain a conserved dimerization motif called the D domain. Here, we report that the D domain protomers of yeast Cdc4 and human β-TrCP form a superhelical homotypic dimer. Disruption of the D domain compromises the activity of yeast SCFCdc4 toward the CDK inhibitor Sic1 and other substrates. SCFCdc4 dimerization has little effect on the affinity for Sic1 but markedly stimulates ubiquitin conjugation. A model of the dimeric holo-SCFCdc4 complex based on small-angle X-ray scatter measurements reveals a suprafacial configuration, in which substrate-binding sites and E2 catalytic sites lie in the same plane with a separation of 64 Å within and 102 Å between each SCF monomer. This spatial variability may accommodate diverse acceptor lysine geometries in both substrates and the elongating ubiquitin chain and thereby increase catalytic efficiency."

Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from existing vessels, plays a central role in a variety of physiological and pathological processes, including embryonic development and tumor growth (1Carmeliet P.

It plays an essential role in the specification, morphogenesis, differentiation, and homeostasis of vessels by regulating the proliferation, migration, and survival of endothelial cells (3Ferrara N. Gerber H.P. LeCouter J. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (7777) Google Scholar). Inactivation of one allele of the Vegf gene leads to embryonic lethality at midgestation from severe cardiovascular defects (4Carmeliet P. Ferreira V. Breier G. Pollefeyt S. Kieckens L.

Inhibiting angiogenesis by blocking VEGF function is also a promising strategy for the treatment of solid tumor cancer and several other diseases of excess vascularization, including age-related macular degeneration (6Ferrara N. Kerbel R.S. Nature. 2005; 438: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (2238) Google Scholar). VEGF is encoded by a single gene found on chromosome 6 in humans, which contains eight exons (7Tischer E.

Cachianes G. Li B. Leung D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1806-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). The VEGF messenger RNA undergoes alternative splicing to give rise to at least six isoforms, containing 121, 145, 165, 183, 189, and 206 amino acids, respectively (7Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T.

Acta. 1998; 1443: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). All VEGF isoforms are secreted as covalently linked homodimers. Isoforms differ in the presence and absence of sequences in exons 6 and 7, which have been shown to encode heparin-binding domains of the protein and are thought to be responsible for the sequestration of VEGF to ECM (8Houck K.A. Ferrara N. Winer J. Cachianes G. Li B. Leung D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1806-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar, 12Houck K.A. Leung D.W. Rowland A.M. Winer J. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26031-26037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, different VEGF isoforms distribute differentially in the environment of a VEGF-secreting cell, depending on the presence or absence of the heparin-binding domain. Among the most prevalent VEGF isoforms, VEGF121 is soluble, whereas VEGF189 is bound to the cell surface or tethered to ECM, and VEGF165, which lacks one of the two heparin-binding domains in VEGF189, has intermediate distribution (13Park J.E. Keller G.A. Ferrara N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1317-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). It is proposed that differential VEGF isoform localization in the extracellular space controls vascular branching pattern, with the heparin-binding isoforms providing spatially restricted stimulatory cues to initiate branch formation (14Ruhrberg C. Gerhardt H. Golding M. Watson R. Ioannidou S. Fujisawa H. Betsholtz C. Shima D.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2684-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). VEGF can bind to two receptor tyrosine kinases to induce signal transduction: VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. They are both characterized by seven extracellular Ig-like domains followed by a membrane-spanning region and a conserved intracellular tyrosine kinase domain interrupted by a kinase insert domain and are activated by ligand-triggered dimerization (15Matthews W.

Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1677-1683PubMed Google Scholar). Although VEGFR1 has the greater affinity for VEGF, VEGFR2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated much more efficiently upon ligand binding and is thought to be the major receptor in endothelial cells for VEGF-induced responses (18Quinn T.P.

A third receptor, neuropilin-1 (NRP1), was identified as an isoform-specific receptor for VEGF recognizing the exon-7-encoded domain of VEGF, and therefore binds VEGF165, but not VEGF121 (20Soker S. Fidder H. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5761-5767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 21Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2066) Google Scholar). NRP1 was originally characterized as a semaphorin receptor regulating axon guidance (22Kolodkin A.L. Levengood D.V. Rowe E.G. Tai Y.T. Giger R.J. Ginty D.D. Cell. 1997; 90: 753-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar, 23He Z. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1997; 90: 739-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). It was later demonstrated in genetic studies that NRP1 is also important for vascular morphogenesis. These data showed that Nrp1-/- mice die at embryonic day 10.5-12.5 from cardiovascular anomalies (24Kawasaki T. Kitsukawa T. Bekku Y. Matsuda Y. Sanbo M. Yagi T. Fujisawa H. Development. 1999; 126: 4895-4902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the cytoplasmic domain of NRP1 is short, it is generally thought that NRP1 has to couple with other signaling proteins to function. However, how NRP1 acts to regulate endothelial cell function is unclear. It is proposed that NRP1 acts as a co-receptor for VEGF165, enhancing VEGF binding to VEGFR2, and thus increases VEGFR2 signaling (21Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2066) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of VEGFR2 does not interact directly with NRP1 (25Fuh G. Garcia K.C. de Vos A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26690-26695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and instead VEGFR2·NRP1 complexes are formed due to bridging, when VEGF165 binds to both receptors simultaneously (26Soker S. Miao H.Q. Nomi M. Takashima S. Klagsbrun M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 85: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In addition, there is evidence that NRP1 may signal independently of VEGFR2 to regulate endothelial cell function. In one study, a chimeric NRP1 receptor, with an EGF-binding extracellular domain, caused migration of endothelial cells in response to EGF (27Wang L. Zeng H. Wang P. Soker S. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48848-48860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In another study, NRP1 was shown to regulate endothelial cell adhesion to ECM proteins independently of VEGFR2 (28Murga M. Fernandez-Capetillo O. Tosato G. Blood. 2004; 105: 1992-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Here, we present evidence that VEGF121 interacts directly with NRP1 and may directly induce NRP1-mediated signaling events. First, a monoclonal antibody against NRP1, which blocks its interaction with VEGF165 (29Pan Q. Chanthery Y. Liang W.C. Stawicki S. Mak J. Rathore N. Tong R.K. Kowalski J. Yee S.F. Pacheco G. Ross S.

Cancer Cell. 2007; 11: 53-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), inhibits VEGF121-induced endothelial cell (EC) migration and sprouting. Second, NRP1 interacts directly with VEGF121 in vitro, but a cleaved form of VEGF, VEGF109, does not bind to NRP1. Third, in contrast to VEGF165, VEGF121 does not induce the formation of a VEGFR2·NRP1 complex, suggesting that VEGF121 may signal through NRP1 independently of VEGFR2. Finally, we present data showing that NRP1 qualitatively enhances VEGF165 binding to VEGFR2, an effect not seen with VEGF121. Based on these findings, we present a model for NRP1 interactions with various VEGF isoforms that serves as a foundation to further understand the role of NRP1 in VEGF-mediated processes. Materials—VEGF165 and sVEGFR2 was from R & D Systems (293-VE-010/CF and 357-KD-050/CF, respectively). Except for the materials used for Figs. 2D and 4C, VEGF121 was purchased from PeproTech (100-20A). Additional VEGF121 samples were from Cellsciences (CRV001B and CRV010B) and Calbiochem (676473). VEGF112 was from R & D Systems (298-VS-025/CF). VEGF109 was produced at Genentech, Inc. (25Fuh G. Garcia K.C. de Vos A.M. J. Biol.

Proteins were produced by transient transfection of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using DMRIE-C (Invitrogen). sNRP1-Fc was purified to >95% purity by affinity chromatography using protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). sNRP1-His was purified to >95% purity by affinity chromatography using Ni2+-nitrilo-triacetic acid Superflow (Qiagen) followed by a cation exchange chromatography step (SP-Sepharose, GE Healthcare). Protein identities were confirmed by N-terminal sequencing using the Edman degradation method. Concentrations were determined by the BCA assay and by A280 absorption measurements. Purity and homogeneity were assessed by SDS-PAGE, size exclusion chromatography, and laser light scattering. Surface Plasmon Resonance—Binding experiments were performed by surface plasmon resonance measurements on a Biacore 3000 instrument (Biacore Inc.) at 25 °C. sNRP1-Fc, sNRP1-His, VEGF165, VEGF121 (from Peprotech), and VEGFR2 (“ligands”) were immobilized at high surface densities (∼10,000 response units) on an activated CM5 chip using standard amine-coupling procedures as described by the manufacturer. Ligands were injected at a concentration of 10 μg/ml in 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, and at a flow rate of 5 μl/min until desired surface densities, measured in response units, were reached. Unreacted groups were blocked by injecting 1 m ethanolamine. To perform binding assays, “analytes” or mixtures of analytes at different concentrations were injected in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20, at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Blank surfaces were used for background corrections. Injections of 10 mm glycine, pH 3.0, at 100 μl/min for 1 min were used to regenerate surfaces between two binding experiments. We used steady state analysis to estimate the affinity of VEGF165 and VEGF121 to NRP1. VEGF samples at concentrations between 50 and 2000 nm were injected and allowed to reach equilibrium state before dissociation. Dissociation constants (Kd) in nm were calculated by plotting the equilibrium response versus concentration. VEGFR2 Phosphorylation Assay—HUVECs were grown in 6-well tissue culture plates to confluence and then starved overnight in basal medium EBM-2 (Cambrex) with 0.2% fetal bovine serum and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were stimulated with the indicated VEGF isoform for 10 min at 37 °C and then washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Total VEGFR2 and phospho-VEGFR2 levels were determined with the human VEGFR2 DuoSet IC enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (R & D Systems). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates were coated with mouse anti-human VEGFR2 antibody and detected with goat anti-human VEGFR2 or mouse anti-phosphotyrosine for total VEGFR2 or phosphorylated VEGFR2, respectively. Cell Migration Assay—Migration assays were performed using a modified Boyden chamber with the 8-μm pore size Falcon 24-multiwell insert system (BD Biosciences). The plates were precoated with 8 μg/ml laminin overnight at 37 °C. Confluent HUVECs were starved overnight, harvested, and resuspended in assay medium (EBM-2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin). 100 μl of cells with or without anti-NRP1B antibody were added into the upper chamber, whereas migration stimuli were added to the lower chamber in 500 μl of assay medium. Cells were allowed to migrate for 16 h at 37 °C. To stop the assay, cells on the upper face of the membrane were removed with a sponge swab, and cells on the lower face were fixed with methanol and stained with Cytox green (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Images were taken with an inverted fluorescent microscope, and cell number was analyzed with ImageJ. Bead Outgrowth Assay—Dextran-coated Cytodex 3 microcarrier beads (Amersham Biosciences) were incubated with HUVECs (400 cells/bead) in EGM-2 overnight at 37 °C. HUVEC-coated beads were then washed three times with 5 ml of clotting medium (EGM-2 minus VEGF), and resuspended in clotting medium with 2.5 μg/ml fibrinogen (Sigma) at a density of 200 beads/ml. To induce clotting, 0.5 ml of fibrinogen/bead solution was added into one well of a 24-well tissue culture plate containing 0.625 units of thrombin (Sigma) and incubated for 5 min at room temperature and then for 20 min at 37 °C. The clot was equilibrated in 1 ml of clotting medium for 30 min at 37 °C. The medium was then replaced with 1 ml of clotting medium containing skin fibroblast cells (Detroit 551; ∼30,000 cells/ml). Different VEGF variants and antibodies were added to each well as indicated, and the assay was monitored for 8 days with a change in medium every other day. Each condition was repeated in two wells. Images of the beads were captured by an inverted microscope, and concentric circles spaced at 100, 200, and 300 μm were drawn around the bead in each image. The number of vessels crossing each line was counted. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Starved HUVECs were incubated with anti-VEGF or anti-NRP1B antibodies (50 μg/ml) in EBM-2 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then cooled on ice for 15 min, and the indicated VEGF variant was added, followed by a 30-min incubation at 4 °C. Cells were stimulated for 7 min at 37 °C and then washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, phosphatase inhibitor mixture I and II (Sigma), and complete protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science)). Cell lysates were spun for 1 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and incubated with agarose-conjugated anti-VEGFR2 antibodies (sc-504 AC and sc-315 AC; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 16 h at 4 °C. Agarose beads were washed three times in cold wash buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl) and then resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer and incubated for 5 min at 95 °C under nonreducing conditions. Samples were resolved in Tris-glycine gels and immunoblotted with anti-NRP1 (sc-7239; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-VEGFR2 (Genentech, Inc.). VEGF121 Is Comparable with VEGF165 in Inducing VEGFR2 Phosphorylation and Endothelial Cell Migration—We initially compared the potency of VEGF121 with VEGF165 in inducing VEGFR2 phosphorylation and EC migration. Activation of VEGFR2 signaling was examined in HUVECs. ECs were incubated with different VEGF variants at concentrations that varied from 0.05 to 250 nm, and the ratio of phospho-VEGFR2 to total VEGFR2 under each condition was determined by Duo Set enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. As shown in Fig. 1A, at the same molar concentration, VEGF121 and VEGF165 led to comparable levels of VEGFR2 phosphorylation. They both led to 50% of maximal receptor phosphorylation at around 1 nm and reached peak activation at about 25 nm. We also tested a truncated form of VEGF, VEGF109 (25Fuh G. Garcia K.C. de Vos A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26690-26695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the VEGFR2 phosphorylation assay, VEGF109 displayed reduced potency compared with VEGF121 and VEGF165. We then studied VEGF variants in their ability to induce EC migration. At 1 nm, VEGF121 and VEGF165 led to similar levels of HUVEC migration (Fig. 1B), whereas VEGF109 induced significantly less migration. Anti-NRP1B Inhibits VEGF121-induced EC Migration and Sprout Formation—We next tested whether blocking NRP1 function would alter the bioactivity of the various VEGF isoforms. As reported previously (29Pan Q. Chanthery Y. Liang W.C. Stawicki S. Mak J. Rathore N. Tong R.K. Kowalski J. Yee S.F. Pacheco G. Ross S. Cheng Z. Le Couter J. Plowman G. Peale F. Koch A.W. Wu Y. Bagri A. Tessier-Lavigne M. Watts R.J. Cancer Cell. 2007; 11: 53-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), a monoclonal antibody against NRP1 (anti-NRP1B), which blocks VEGF165 binding to NRP1, significantly reduced EC migration in response to 1 and 5 nm VEGF165 (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, anti-NRP1B also significantly reduced HUVEC migration in response to VEGF121 at all concentrations of VEGF121 tested (Fig. 2B). In contrast, VEGF109-induced EC migration was not inhibited by anti-NRP1B (Fig. 2C). Significant reduction of VEGF121-induced migration was also observed with VEGF samples from a number of different sources (Fig. 2D). The specificity of anti-NRP1B blocking both VEGF165- and VEGF121-induced migration, but not VEGF109, is further supported by our previous studies showing that anti-NRP1B does not block basic fibroblast growth factor- or human growth factor-induced endothelial cell migration (29Pan Q. Chanthery Y. Liang W.C. Stawicki S. Mak J. Rathore N. Tong R.K. Kowalski J. Yee S.F. Pacheco G. Ross S. Cheng Z. Le Couter J. Plowman G. Peale F. Koch A.W. Wu Y. Bagri A. Tessier-Lavigne M. Watts R.J. Cancer Cell. 2007; 11: 53-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). To dissect the activity of these VEGF variants in capillary formation, we carried out a bead outgrowth assay in fibrin gels (30Nakatsu M.N. Sainson R.C. Perez-del-Pulgar S. Aoto J.N. Aitkenhead M. Taylor K.L. Carpenter P.M. Hughes C.C. Lab. Invest. 2003; 83: 1873-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Since VEGF165 and VEGF121 were similar in their ability to activate VEGFR2, whereas VEGF109 was less potent (Fig. 1), the three VEGF variants were used at 0.1, 0.1, and 0.5 nm, respectively, to achieve similar levels of sprouting. We used a 10-fold lower overall VEGF concentration in the sprouting assay, as compared with the VEGFR2 phosphorylation and migration assays, based on an empirically identified optimal concentration, as determined by dose response studies in this assay (data not shown). Cultures were monitored over the course of 8 days, and images were taken at the end of the assay. As a positive control, anti-VEGF completely inhibited capillary-like tube formation induced by all three VEGF isoforms (Fig. 3A, right). When anti-NRP1B was added at a saturating concentration (50 μg/ml) to the bead outgrowth assay, it greatly reduced sprout formation in the presence of either VEGF165 or VEGF121. However, different from the inhibition executed by anti-VEGF, a few short sprouts were still observed around the carrier bead, and the vessel diameter was greatly increased with anti-NRP1B treatment (arrows; Fig. 3A, middle). We concluded that this might be due to the fact that anti-NRP1B greatly reduces VEGF-induced EC migration but has little effect on cell proliferation as we have previously shown (29Pan Q. Chanthery Y. Liang W.C. Stawicki S. Mak J. Rathore N. Tong R.K. Kowalski J. Yee S.F. Pacheco G. Ross S. Cheng Z. Le Couter J. Plowman G. Peale F. Koch A.W. Wu Y. Bagri A. Tessier-Lavigne M. Watts R.J. Cancer Cell. 2007; 11: 53-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). On the other hand, anti-NRP1B only slightly decreased sprout formation in the presence of VEGF109 (Fig. 3A; quantification in Fig. 3B). We speculate that this slight reduction might be attributed to the small amounts of VEGF165 or VEGF121 produced by fibroblasts, which were grown on top of the fibrin gel as support cells for the bead outgrowth assay. Also worth noting is the qualitative phenotype we observed with VEGF109-treated beads, which results in very wide vessels regardless of the presence of anti-NRP1B (arrows; Fig. 3A, lower panels). Since it is generally believed that VEGF121, and by inference VEGF109, do not interact with NRP1, we considered two explanations as to why blocking NRP1 function would disrupt VEGF121-induced EC behavior. First, blocking NRP1 function may indirectly alter VEGF121 interactions with VEGFR2 and thus reduce VEGF121 function. Second, NRP1 may interact directly with VEGF121. We therefore tested the interactions of the various VEGF isoforms with NRP1 in vitro. VEGF121 Interacts with NRP1 in Vitro—We employed surface plasmon resonance as a direct binding assay to study the interaction between the two VEGF isoforms and NRP1. VEGF165 showed strong, specific binding to sNRP1-Fc immobilized on a sensor chip at high density (Fig. 4A), confirming earlier results with a similar neuropilin construct (25Fuh G. Garcia K.C. de Vos A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26690-26695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once again, as a negative control we used a truncated VEGF, VEGF109, which did not bind NRP1. Interestingly, VEGF121 showed a significant, concentration-dependent binding to sNRP1-Fc (Fig. 4B). Both VEGF isoforms also exhibited binding to other NRP constructs, such as sNRP1-His (data not shown). This is remarkable, since, compared with VEGF165, VEGF121 lacks the heparin-binding domain encoded by exon 7 and has been previously reported not to bind NRP1 (31Whitaker G.B. Limberg B.J. Rosenbaum J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25520-25531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 32Shraga-Heled N. Kessler O. Prahst C. Kroll J. Augustin H. Neufeld G. FASEB J. 2006; 21: 915-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Steady state binding analysis revealed that VEGF165 and VEGF121 have comparable binding affinities to NRP1, with KD values of 120 and 220 nm for VEGF165 and VEGF121, respectively. We were also able to confirm the interaction between VEGF121 and NRP1 for VEGF samples from a number of different sources (Fig. 4C). All but one VEGF121 sample showed specific binding to NRP1 with very similar association and dissociation profiles and only slight differences in the maximum relative response. The one VEGF121 sample that did not show any binding to sNRP1-Fc (Fig. 4C) or sNRP1-His (data not shown) is in fact a truncated version of VEGF121. This particular VEGF121 sample is lacking nine C-terminal amino acids, as stated in the manufacturer’s specification sheet (R & D Systems), which we confirmed by our own mass spectrometry analysis (data not shown), and should therefore be referred to as VEGF112. Mass spectrometry analysis was also used to confirm the proper size of the VEGF121 sample that did indeed show significant binding (Fig. 4B), which was used for all of our cell-based experiments. All VEGF isoforms and two truncated VEGFs bind to VEGFR2 immobilized on a sensor chip (Fig. 4D). We conclude that although both VEGF121 and truncated VEGF variants display similar binding to VEGFR2, only full-length VEGF121 is able to interact with NRP1. Last, we demonstrated the specificity of these interactions by showing that anti-NRP1B blocks NRP1 binding to immobilized VEGF165 and VEGF121 (Fig. 4, E and F, respectively). VEGF121 Is Not Sufficient to Bridge the Formation of the VEGFR2·NRP1 Complex—Having confirmed that NRP1 can interact directly with VEGF121, we next explored what effects this would have on VEGF121/VEGFR2 interactions. It is well known that VEGF165 mediates the formation of complexes containing VEGFR2 and NRP1, which enhances the affinity of VEGF165 for VEGFR2 and therefore VEGFR2 signaling (26Soker S. Miao H.Q. Nomi M. Takashima S. Klagsbrun M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 85: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). We wondered whether VEGF121 also functions on ECs through bridging the formation of VEGFR2·NRP1 complex. Consistent with previous observations (26Soker S. Miao H.Q. Nomi M. Takashima S. Klagsbrun M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 85: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), anti-VEGFR2 antibodies immunoprecipitated NRP1 in the presence of VEGF165 but not VEGF121 (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 5, NRP1 blot), indicating that VEGF121 does not promote VEGFR2·NRP1 complex formation. As expected, VEGF109 is also not sufficient to promote VEGFR2·NRP1 complex formation (lane 8, NRP1 blot). Observing that VEGF121 does not promote VEGFR2·NRP1 com"

In addition, the block of respiration by antimycin A added to RLM respiring in state 4 conditions, or the addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, results in O<sub>2</sub> generation, which is blocked by the catalase inhibitors aminotriazole or KCN. In this regard, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> decomposition yields molecular oxygen in a 2:1 stoichiometry, consistent with a catalatic mechanism with a rate constant of 0.0346 s<sup>-1</sup>. The rate of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> consumption is not influenced by respiratory substrates, succinate or glutamate-malate, nor by <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide, suggesting that cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase and the glutathione-glutathione peroxidase system are not significantly involved in this process.

All these observations are compatible with the presence of endogenous heme-containing catalase with an activity of 825 ± 15 units, which contributes to mitochondrial protection against endogenous or exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Mitochondrial catalase in liver most probably represents regulatory control of bioenergetic metabolism, but it may also be proposed for new therapeutic strategies against liver diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2169913167,"Extracellular nucleotides (e.g., ATP) regulate many physiological and pathophysiological processes through activation of nucleotide (P2) receptors in the plasma membrane. Here we report that gene-targeted (knockout) mice that lack P2Y2 receptors have salt-resistant arterial hypertension in association with an inverse relationship between salt intake and heart rate, indicating intact baroreceptor function. Knockout mice have multiple alterations in their handling of salt and water: these include suppressed plasma renin and aldosterone concentrations, lower renal expression of the aldosterone-induced epithelial sodium channel alpha-ENaC, greater medullary expression of the Na-K-2Cl-cotransporter NKCC2, and greater furosemide-sensitive Na+ reabsorption in association with greater renal medullary expression of aquaporin-2 and vasopressin-dependent renal cAMP formation and water reabsorption despite similar vasopressin levels compared with wild type. Of note, smaller increases in plasma aldosterone were required to adapt renal Na+ excretion to restricted intake in knockout mice, suggesting a facilitation in renal Na+ retention. The results thus identify a previously unrecognized role for P2Y2 receptors in blood pressure regulation that is linked to an inhibitory influence on renal Na+ and water reabsorption. Based on these findings in knockout mice, we propose that a blunting in P2Y2 receptor expression or activity is a new mechanism for salt-resistant arterial hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2020300656,"Vacuolar proton-translocating ATPases (V-ATPases) are a family of highly conserved proton pumps that couple hydrolysis of cytosolic ATP to proton transport out of the cytosol. Although V-ATPases are involved in a number of cellular processes, how the proton pumps are regulated under physiological conditions is not well understood. We have reported that the glycolytic enzyme aldolase mediates V-ATPase assembly and activity by physical association with the proton pump (Lu, M., Holliday, L. S., Zhang, L., Dunn, W. A., and Gluck, S. L. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 30407-30413 and Lu, M., Sautin, Y., Holliday, L. S., and Gluck, S. L. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 8732-8739). In this study, we generate aldolase mutants that lack binding to the B subunit of V-ATPase but retain normal catalytic activities. Functional analysis of the aldolase mutants shows that disruption of binding between aldolase and the B subunit of V-ATPase results in disassembly and malfunction of V-ATPase. In contrast, aldolase enzymatic activity is not required for V-ATPase assembly. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest an important role for physical association between aldolase and V-ATPase in the regulation of the proton pump."

Here we describe the role of RbcX as an assembly chaperone of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), the enzyme responsible for the fixation of atmospheric carbon dioxide.

We found that cyanobacterial RbcX functions downstream of chaperonin-mediated RbcL folding in promoting the formation of RbcL8 core complexes. Structural analysis revealed that the 15 kDa RbcX forms a homodimer with two cooperating RbcL-binding regions. A central cleft specifically binds the exposed C-terminal peptide of RbcL subunits, enabling a peripheral surface of RbcX to mediate RbcL8 assembly. Due to the dynamic nature of these interactions, RbcX is readily displaced from RbcL8 complexes by RbcS, producing the active enzyme.

Molecular chaperones fulfill essential functions in protein biogenesis and quality control in all types of cell (Frydman, 2001Frydman J.

Although the term “molecular chaperone” was coined to describe a role in assisting oligomeric protein assembly (Ellis, 2006Ellis R.J. Molecular chaperones: assisting assembly in addition to folding.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 395-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), it is now commonly thought that chaperones are primarily involved with mediating polypeptide chain folding, essentially by preventing misfolding and aggregation of newly-synthesized and stress-denatured polypeptides. These mechanisms are well established, particularly for the Hsp70s and the chaperonins (Frydman, 2001Frydman J. Folding of newly translated proteins in vivo: The role of molecular chaperones.Annu.

By contrast, how cells ensure the efficient assembly of folded subunits into oligomeric complexes is not well understood, and surprisingly few examples of specific assembly chaperones are known (Ellis, 2006Ellis R.J.

Hexadecameric ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) in chloroplasts, the most abundant enzyme in nature, has been an important paradigm in studies of protein assembly. Indeed, this process was initially thought to be mediated by the chaperonin system because nonassembled large subunits of plant Rubisco were observed to cofractionate with the chloroplast chaperonin (Barraclough and Ellis, 1980Barraclough R. Ellis R.J. Protein synthesis in chloroplasts. IX. Assembly of newly-synthesized large subunits into ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase in isolated intact pea chloroplasts.Biochim. Biophys.

Rubisco assembly: a model system for studying the mechanism of chaperonin action.Plant Cell. 1989; 1: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, attempts to reconstitute Rubisco with chaperonin alone have failed (Tabita, 1999Tabita F.R. Microbial ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase: a different perspective.Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 1-28Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar), suggesting that additional factors must participate in this process. Rubisco catalyzes the initial steps of two opposing reaction pathways: photosynthetic carbon fixation (CO2 as the substrate) and photorespiration (O2 as the substrate; Andrews and Lorimer, 1987Andrews T.J. Lorimer G.H. Rubisco: structure, mechanisms, and prospects for improvement.in: Hatch M.D. Boardman N.K. In The Biochemistry of Plants: A Comprehensive Treatise. Volume 10. Academic Press, New York1987: 131-218Google Scholar). The photosynthetic fixation of CO2 results in the synthesis of usable sugars (Gutteridge and Gatenby, 1995Gutteridge S. Gatenby A.A. Rubisco synthesis, assembly, mechanism, and regulation.Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and thus is responsible for plant growth and yield. Three structural forms of assembly of otherwise closely homologous Rubisco subunits are known (Andersson and Taylor, 2003Andersson I. Taylor T.C.

Res. 1999; 60: 1-28Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar): Form I found in plants and cyanobacteria is a hexadecamer, denoted as RbcL8S8, containing eight large subunits (RbcL: MW 50-55 kDa) and eight small subunits (RbcS: MW 12-18 kDa). The oligomer has a cylindrical shape with a diameter of ∼110 Å and a height of 100 Å. Four small subunits cap the top and bottom of eight large subunits, which form a tetramer of dimers. The simpler form II Rubisco in some photosynthetic bacteria (e.g., Rhodospirillum rubrum) and dinoflagellates is a dimer of RbcL subunits. Form III, found in a thermophilic archaeon, consists of five RbcL dimers. Chaperonins are large cylindrical complexes with ATPase activity. The GroEL-type chaperonins (Cpn60s) of bacteria, chloroplasts, and mitochondria consist of two heptameric rings of ∼60 kDa subunits, each forming a central cavity for the binding of nonnative protein substrate (Frydman, 2001Frydman J. Folding of newly translated proteins in vivo: The role of molecular chaperones.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 603-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar, Hartl and Hayer-Hartl, 2002Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Molecular chaperones in the cytosol: from nascent chain to folded protein.Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2799) Google Scholar). They function together with factors of the GroES/Cpn10 family, single-ring assemblies of seven ∼10 kDa subunits, which bind transiently to the ends of the chaperonin cylinder. ATP-dependent GroES association results in the encapsulation of a single molecule of unfolded protein inside the GroEL cavity for folding to occur unimpaired by aggregation. Whereas bacterial GroEL and the mitochondrial chaperonin are homo-oligomeric, the chloroplast chaperonin is composed of homologous α and β subunits. Moreover, plant chloroplasts have two types of cochaperone, Cpn10 and Cpn20, the latter consisting of a tandem repeat of Cpn10 units (Hill and Hemmingsen, 2001Hill J.E. Hemmingsen S.M. Arabidopsis thaliana type I and II chaperonins.Cell Stress Chaperones. 2001; 6: 190-200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These features may represent an adaptation to chloroplast-specific substrate proteins. The folding and assembly of form II Rubisco from R. rubrum has been reconstituted with bacterial GroEL/GroES (Goloubinoff et al., 1989aGoloubinoff P. Christeller J.T. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H.

In this reaction Rubisco subunits fold inside the chaperonin cage, followed by dimerization upon release into solution (Brinker et al., 2001Brinker A. Pfeifer G. Kerner M.J. Naylor D.J. Hartl F.U.

Expression of cyanobacterial form I Rubisco of Synechococcus sp.

As shown in cyanobacteria, assembly of the RbcL8S8 complex is thought to involve the formation of RbcL8 core particles, followed by the docking of unassembled small subunits (Andrews and Lorimer, 1985Andrews T.J.

Here we report that cyanobacterial RbcX is a Rubisco assembly chaperone. Structural and mechanistic analysis of RbcX from Synechococcus sp. PCC7002 revealed that the 15 kDa protein functions as a homodimer by binding and stabilizing RbcL subunits subsequent to their interaction with chaperonin. RbcX recognizes specifically, via a central peptide-binding groove, a conserved C-terminal peptide of RbcL. This interaction and additional contacts mediated by a peripheral binding surface of RbcX assist in the efficient formation of RbcL8 core complexes. The RbcL-RbcX interaction is dynamic, facilitating displacement of RbcX from RbcL8 by RbcS subunits to produce the active holoenzyme. The interchangeability of RbcX proteins between species is limited, suggesting that RbcX coevolved with RbcL and RbcS. We find that RbcX homologs are also present in higher plants. The chaperone requirement for the folding and assembly of cyanobacterial form I Rubisco from Synechococcus sp. PCC7002 (Syn7002) was assessed upon expression of Rubisco subunits in E. coli cells with normal and elevated chaperonin levels. Amounts of soluble protein were determined upon fractionation of cell extracts and immunoblotting. Formation of RbcL8S8 holoenzyme (Figure 1A) or RbcL8 complexes (Figure 1B) was monitored by Native-PAGE and Rubisco activity assay. In wild-type cells, expression of Syn7002-RbcL from an IPTG-inducible plasmid did not result in soluble protein, irrespective of whether RbcS was coexpressed (Figures 1A and 1B, lane 1). Transient (∼10-fold) overexpression of GroEL/GroES prior to induction of rbcLS or rbcL also failed to produce significant amounts of soluble RbcL (Figures 1A and 1B, lane 2). Assembled Rubisco and carboxylation activity were essentially absent (Figures 1A and 1B, lanes 1–2). In contrast, expression of the homologous Rubisco from Synechococcus sp. PCC6301 (Syn6301) resulted in the formation of substantial amounts of RbcL8S8 or RbcL8 complexes which migrated as high molecular weight bands on Native-PAGE (Figure S1A; Goloubinoff et al., 1989bGoloubinoff P. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. GroE heat-shock proteins promote assembly of foreign prokaryotic ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase oligomers in Escherichia coli.Nature. 1989; 337: 44-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). In Syn7002, the RbcL and RbcS subunit genes are located in an operon that also encodes the protein RbcX in the order rbcL-rbcX-rbcS. Indeed, the assembly of Syn7002-RbcL8S8 proved to be critically dependent on coexpression of RbcLS with RbcX (Figure 1A, lane 3; Onizuka et al., 2004Onizuka T. Endo S. Akiyama H. Kanai S. Hirano M. Yokota A. Tanaka S. Miyasaka H. The rbcX gene product promotes the production and assembly of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase of Synechococcus sp. PCC7002 in Escherichia coli.Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 1390-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Importantly, when Syn7002-RbcL was expressed in the absence of RbcS, RbcX was required for the formation of RbcL8 core complexes competent for assembly to active enzyme with RbcS (Figure 1B, lane 3). Thus, RbcX appears to be required predominantly or exclusively for RbcL8 formation. Overexpression of GroEL/GroES in the presence of RbcX caused a 3- to 4-fold increase in Syn7002 Rubisco activity, correlating with an increased amount of RbcL8S8 or RbcL8 detected by Native-PAGE (Figures 1A and 1B, lane 4). In the case of Rubisco from Syn6301, where rbcX is encoded outside the rbcLS operon, assembly of RbcL8 was enhanced 4- to 5-fold by RbcX coexpression (Figure S1B). Thus, RbcX strongly increases the yield of assembly but is not essential for RbcL8 formation, at least in the case of Syn6301 Rubisco. The requirement of GroEL/GroES and RbcX for efficient assembly was reproduced upon in vitro synthesis of Syn7002-RbcL in an E. coli translation lysate (Agashe et al., 2004Agashe V.R. Guha S. Chang H.C. Genevaux P. Hayer-Hartl M. Stemp M. Georgopoulos C. Hartl F.U. Barral J.M.

Supplementing GroEL/GroES, but not GroES alone, together with RbcX produced mostly soluble RbcL and greatly increased the formation of RbcL8 core complexes (Figure 1C, lanes 3 and 4). Rubisco activity was detected upon addition of purified RbcS (data not shown). RbcL translation in GroEL-immunodepleted lysate did not produce RbcL8, even when RbcX was present, demonstrating the requirement of both factors (Figure 1C, lanes 5–7). Importantly, readdition of GroEL after inhibition of RbcL translation with chloramphenicol (CAM) failed to produce RbcL8 despite the presence of RbcX during translation (Figure 1C, lane 8). Note that some RbcL was bound to GroEL under these conditions, but this protein was not productive for folding. Thus, RbcX cannot stabilize RbcL for subsequent productive interaction with GroEL, suggesting that GroEL must interact with RbcL immediately upon synthesis. Indeed, while the production of RbcL8 was most efficient when the lysate was supplemented with both GroEL/GroES and RbcX during translation (Figure 1D, lane 1), addition of RbcX immediately after blocking translation still mediated RbcL8 formation, albeit at a reduced level (Figure 1D, lane 2). Delayed posttranslational addition of RbcX resulted in the rapid loss of RbcL assembly and in the formation of insoluble RbcL (Figure 1D and data not shown). Together these experiments indicate that RbcX has a specific chaperone function in preventing RbcL misassembly downstream of chaperonin. To understand the mechanism of RbcX action in Rubisco assembly, we undertook a structural analysis of Syn7002-RbcX by X-ray crystallography. RbcX was expressed in E. coli as a soluble protein of 15 kDa on SDS-PAGE. Analysis by multiangle light scattering indicated that RbcX forms a dimer of 30.2 kDa (Figure S2), henceforth referred to as RbcX. RbcX readily crystallized in space group P41212 with three dimers in the asymmetric unit, and the structure was solved by Pt-SIRAS at a resolution of 2.8 Å (crystallographic data are summarized in Table S1). Residues 115 to 134 were not resolved in any of the RbcX peptide chains. Indeed, limited proteolysis of RbcX resulted in the removal of the poorly conserved 25 C-terminal residues (Figure S3), leaving a stable core domain of residues 1–109 (RbcX(ΔC25)) which was active in Rubisco assembly (Figure S4). We also solved the structure of SeMet-labeled RbcX(ΔC25) containing six RbcX dimers per asymmetric unit (Table S1). The average rms deviation for Cα positions between RbcX dimers in the crystal lattices was 0.623 Å, indicating that the core domain structure is rather rigid (Figure S5). RbcX consists of four α helices per monomer (α1–4) that form an unusual helix bundle (Figure 2A). α2 (residues 35–48) turns backward relative to α1 (residues 4–33) with a steep interhelical angle of 151° and only one residue (N34) forming the turn. A very similar arrangement is observed at the junction between α3 (residues 52–63) and α4 (residues 65–107; interhelix angle 161°). The short helices α2 and α3 are connected by a five-residue linker. The core of the helical bundle is composed of conserved hydrophobic residues (Figure S3) without authentic coiled-coil side-chain packing. α4 makes an ∼60° kink in the vicinity of residue 84 and forms a 35 Å long extension (α4C) pointing away from the helix bundle (Figure 2A). The RbcX dimer has overall dimensions of ∼64 × 33 × 31 Å (length × height × width). The long α4 helices of the protomers align in an almost antiparallel fashion such that the helical bundles are located at opposite ends (Figure 2B). The α1 helices form additional symmetrical contacts and together with the α2 helices delineate a narrow diagonal groove in the arc-shaped complex. The dimer interface is predominantly uncharged and hydrophobic. A polar network around the conserved residue N98, contacting the amide backbone at position L72 and the side chains of R75 and E76 in the opposing protomer, contributes to dimer stability. The α2-α3 helical hairpins make no direct interchain contacts. Helix α2 is the most mobile element of the structure (Figure S5). Crystallographic analysis of the RbcX from the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. CA (AnaCA) revealed a structure virtually identical to that of Syn7002-RbcX (rmsd 1.14 Å over 103 Cα atoms; see Table S1 and Figure S6). Consistent with their high degree of sequence conservation (Figure S3), this suggests that all cyanobacterial RbcX homologs have the same overall architecture. The RbcX homologs identified in plants are more distant but share the register and the structural residues in the globular helix bundle of cyanobacterial RbcX (Figure S3). Two highly conserved regions, representing potential protein-protein interaction sites, were identified on RbcX, the central groove of the dimer and a surface region around the corners of the molecule (Figure 2C). A hydrophobic area comprising the conserved residues Y17, Y20, and I50 of each monomer lines the groove in the center of the molecule (Figure 2C). Y17 packs against T13, which is frequently replaced in cyanobacterial RbcX sequences by an isosteric valine (Figure S3). Central access into the crevice is constricted to a 5.4 Å wide opening by the side chains of the highly conserved Q51 residues that is just wide enough to accommodate a polypeptide chain in an extended conformation. The other conserved region has predominantly polar character and is located at the corners of the RbcX dimer, comprising residues Q29, E32, T33, N34, R70, E76, and R102, R103, L106, E107, R108, respectively (Figure 2C). It is formed by helices 4 of both protomers and by the turn region between the α1 and α2 helices of one subunit and may serve to interact with a polar protein surface. Because of the 2-fold symmetry, this region occurs twice at opposing edges of the dimer. The possible functional significance of these conserved regions of RbcX was investigated by mutational analysis (Figure 3A). Several single and double mutations predicted to compromise dimer formation failed to produce soluble RbcX and hence did not support the expression of soluble RbcL (Figure 3A, asterisks; Figure S7). All other RbcX mutant proteins were soluble and presumably had native-like dimer structure (Figure S7). A large set of mutations were of little or no effect on RbcL solubility and assembly (Figure 3A, circles). Individual alanine substitution of the central groove residues Y17 and Y20 reduced RbcL solubility and formation of RbcL8 complexes (Figure 3A, lanes 6 and 7), while mutation of the adjacent residue T13 was without measurable effect (Figure 3A, lane 3). In contrast, the double mutation Y17A,Y20L abolished the formation of soluble RbcL almost completely (Figure 3A, lane 9). Since the crystal structure of this mutant protein was virtually identical to that of wild-type RbcX (Table S1 and data not shown), this indicates that the central groove of RbcX has an essential function. Alanine substitution of the conserved residue Q51, which forms the upper rim of the central channel, was without detectable effect on RbcX function (Figure 3A, lane 16). Interestingly, several other individual mutations (Q29A, E32A, R70A, and R102A) allowed the accumulation of soluble RbcL but did not support assembly to RbcL8 (Figure 3A, triangles). Notably, all of these mapped to the polar ends of the RbcX dimer, forming symmetrical, contiguous surfaces (Figure 2C). The soluble RbcL produced upon coexpression with wild-type or mutant RbcX was analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography. Coexpression with N-terminally FLAG-tagged wild-type RbcX, which was fully active, resulted mainly in RbcL that fractionated at ∼400 kDa, similar to a Syn6301-RbcL8 standard (Figure 3Bi). A smaller amount of RbcL fractionated at a high molecular weight in excess of 800 kDa. This protein was not bound to GroEL and apparently represented misassembled, aggregated RbcL. No monomers of RbcL were detected, suggesting a high cooperativity of assembly. The RbcX mutant Y17A, partially impairing the function of the central groove, resulted in a reduced amount of RbcL8 complex (Figure 3Bii). Interestingly, mutation Q29A, disrupting the peripheral polar surface of RbcX, supported exclusively the production of misassembled, high-molecular-weight RbcL (Figure 3Biii), confirming the absence of RbcL8 complex upon analysis by Native-PAGE (Figure 3A, lane 10). Notably, RbcX did not detectably cofractionate with RbcL8 (data not shown), suggesting either that the RbcL-RbcX interaction is labile on gel filtration or that RbcX binds to RbcL only transiently during RbcL8 assembly. Coimmunoprecipitation from cell extracts with anti-FLAG antibody supported the former possibility. A substantial amount of RbcL was coimmunoprecipitated with RbcXFLAG but not with nontagged RbcX (data not shown). Following dissociation from the antibody by incubation with excess FLAG-peptide, the RbcL protein fractionated as the RbcL8 complex (Figure 3Ci). Only a small amount of RbcL8 coimmunoprecipitated with the mutant RbcX(Y17A), and no association was detectable with mutant RbcX(Q29A) (Figures 3Cii and 3Ciii), indicating that these mutations weakened the interaction of RbcX with RbcL, resulting in RbcL misassembly and aggregation. In summary, these experiments identified two independent, functionally critical regions on RbcX, the central hydrophobic crevice and a peripheral polar surface of the molecule. Whereas the central crevice is essential for the production of soluble RbcL subunits, disruption of the polar surface results in the production of soluble but misassembled RbcL, suggesting a role in proper subunit arrangement. The structural features of the central groove region of RbcX seemed suitable for binding an extended peptide. To identify such a sequence element(s) in RbcL, an array of 12-amino-acid-long, acetylated peptides covering the entire sequence of Syn7002-RbcL with a ten residue overlap (231 peptides in total) was C-terminally attached to a cellulose-PEG membrane. Incubation with Syn7002-RbcX, followed by detection with anti-RbcX antibody, resulted in a strong binding signal with four RbcL peptides sharing the sequence EIKFEFD close to the C terminus of RbcL (Figures 4A and 4B). Other peptides exhibiting weaker binding had no apparent consensus motif. Essentially the same binding pattern was observed with the RbcX polar surface mutant Q29A, while the groove mutant Y17A,Y20L caused the complete loss of RbcX binding to the C-terminal RbcL peptide (Figure 4A). Specific binding to the C-terminal EIKFEFD motif was also detected with RbcX from Anabaena sp. CA (Figure 4A), suggesting that this interaction is a general property of cyanobacterial RbcX homologs. In the Rubisco holoenzyme, the C-terminal sequence of RbcL is located at the surface of the complex and has been implicated in regulating catalysis (Zhu et al., 1998Zhu G.H. Jensen R.G. Bohnert H.J. Wildner G.F. Schlitter J. Dependence of catalysis and CO2/O2 specificity of Rubisco on the carboxy-terminus of the large subunit at different temperatures.Photosynth. Res. 1998; 57: 71-79Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It is highly conserved among all form I Rubisco RbcL homologs (Figure 4B), including the proteins from higher plants, but is not found in archaeal and form II Rubisco (Figure S8A), along with the absence of RbcX in the respective organisms. To obtain structural information on RbcL peptide binding, crystals of Syn7002-RbcX were soaked with the peptide EIKFEFD. One of the three crystallographically independent dimers in the native crystal form of RbcX exhibited difference electron density compatible with a bound peptide at the central recess (Figure S8B; Table S1). This difference density is not centered on the dyad axis of the RbcX dimer, indicating that one orientation is markedly preferred in the asymmetric environment of the crystal lattice. In the refined model, the peptide adopts an extended conformation with the side chains F462 and F464 extending into cavities lined by the side chains of T13, Y17, Y20, I50, and Q51 at the center of the RbcX cleft; the polar side chains of the peptide face outwards and are mostly disordered (Figures 4C and 4D). I460 of the peptide appears to contact Y20, R24, and S45 of one RbcX chain. In addition, the observed geometry is compatible with three hydrogen bonds formed between the peptide backbone and the side chains of Y20, R24, and Q51. The conformations of the two Q51 side chains appear to be mainly governed by van der Waals contacts to the phenyl rings of peptide residues F462 and F464 (Figure 4D). Binding analysis by isothermal titration calorimetry (Figure S9) revealed a relatively low affinity of Syn7002-RbcX for peptide EIKFEFD (KD ∼230 μM), comprising the core binding region. A somewhat higher affinity (KD ∼ 160 μM) was measured with the longer peptide KEIKFEFDTVD, which includes the conserved residues Lys458 and Asp468. These measurements indicate that the interaction of Syn7002-RbcX with the RbcL C terminus is highly dynamic. Interestingly, substantially higher affinities for these peptides were measured with AnaCA-RbcX (KD ∼ 60 μM and 5 μM, respectively). In AnaCA-RbcX, the loop region between helices α2"

Two-level theories of emotion extend this model to suggest that cognitive interpretations of physiological changes shape self-reported emotions. Correspondingly false physiological feedback of evoked or tonic bodily responses can alter emotional attributions. Moreover, anxiety states are proposed to arise from detection of mismatch between actual and anticipated states of physiological arousal. However, the neural underpinnings of these phenomena previously have not been examined. Methodology/Principal Findings We undertook a functional brain imaging (fMRI) experiment to investigate how both primary and second-order levels of physiological (viscerosensory) representation impact on the processing of external emotional cues. 12 participants were scanned while judging face stimuli during both exercise and non-exercise conditions in the context of true and false auditory feedback of tonic heart rate. We observed that the perceived emotional intensity/salience of neutral faces was enhanced by false feedback of increased heart rate. Regional changes in neural activity corresponding to this behavioural interaction were observed within included right anterior insula, bilateral mid insula, and amygdala. In addition, right anterior insula activity was enhanced during by asynchronous relative to synchronous cardiac feedback even with no change in perceived or actual heart rate suggesting this region serves as a comparator to detect physiological mismatches. Finally, BOLD activity within right anterior insula and amygdala predicted the corresponding changes in perceived intensity ratings at both a group and an individual level. Conclusions/Significance Our findings identify the neural substrates supporting behavioural effects of false physiological feedback, and highlight mechanisms that underlie subjective anxiety states, including the importance of the right anterior insula in guiding second-order “cognitive” representations of bodily arousal state."

Thus, understanding various physiologic factors that regulate MTP would be useful in devising methods to combat hyperlipidemias. apolipoprotein B microsomal triglyceride transfer protein low density lipoprotein(s) glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase high density lipoprotein(s) phosphate-buffered saline Several in vitro and in vivo studies show that cholesterol synthesis exhibits circadian rhythm in the liver and intestine (25Mortimer B.C.

However, none of these changes have been directly correlated with plasma lipids. Thus, specific mechanisms responsible for the observed daily shifts in lipid levels have not been identified. In the present study, we studied diurnal variations in plasma lipids and in the expression of MTP and propose that diurnal changes in MTP might be a key determinant controlling plasma lipid levels. Materials—[35S]Methionine/cysteine labeling mixture, [3H]triolein, [3H]cholesterol, [14C]cholesterol, and Solvable were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Rabbit anti-PDI (catalog number SPA-890; Stressgen Bioreagents), rabbit polyclonal to GAPDH (catalog number ab9485; Abcam Inc.), purified mouse anti-MTP (catalog number 612022; BD Transduction Laboratories), apoB (catalog number K23300R; Biodesign), and apoAI (catalog number 178463; Calbiochem) were used for Western blot analysis. Animals—Animal experiments were performed in accordance with the institutional animal care and use committee guidelines. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (10–12 weeks) and C57BL/6J mice (about 10 weeks) were purchased and acclimatized for at least 7 days in an air-conditioned room at 22 ± 0.5 °C with a 12-h lighting schedule (700–1900 h) prior to experiments. All animals had free access to water and standard laboratory chow. For experiments, animals (n = 6, each time point) were retrieved at the indicated times and anesthetized, and blood was collected from the heart. Liver was collected, washed in icecold PBS, cut into small pieces, and frozen for further analysis. Small intestines were obtained from the duodenum, washed, and cut open. They were divided into 4–5-cm pieces starting from the duodenum. Mucosa was scraped from these segments and snap frozen. The first segment was used for lipid analyses, the second for MTP activity and protein measurements, and the third segment for mRNA quantifications. For fasting followed by feeding experiments, two groups of animals were fasted for 24 h starting at 1200 and 2400 h. Subsequently, these animals had free access to food for 0, 2, 6, or 12 h. For restricted feeding experiments, mice had access to food only from 900 to 1500 h for 10 days, and then they were used to measure MTP at the indicated times. To study the effect of light and dark, animals were kept in these conditions for 5 days and used for circadian experiments. Plasma Lipid Analysis—Plasma high density lipoproteins (HDL) were isolated after the precipitation of apoB-lipoproteins with phosphotungstate/MgCl2 reagent (HDL-cholesterol; Sigma). Total and HDL triglycerides and cholesterol were measured using commercial enzymatic assays adapted for micromethods (36Iqbal J. Hussain M.M. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1491-1501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Non-HDL apoB-lipoprotein triglyceride and cholesterol were determined by subtracting HDL lipid values from totals. In Vivo Absorption of Lipids—Mice were fed a mixture of 2 μCi of [14C]cholesterol, 1 μCi of [3H]triolein, and 2 g/liter cholesterol (Sigma) in 50 μl of olive oil. Blood was collected from the tail, and plasma was used for liquid scintillation counting. Four hours later, mice were subjected to euthanasia, and intestines were removed, flushed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and cut in four equal parts. The mucosa was scraped and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Liver and intestinal tissues were digested by incubating with Solvable, and radioactivity was determined after adding scintillation mixture. In some experiments, to avoid clearance of lipoproteins, plasma lipoprotein lipase was inhibited by the injection of 100 μl of Triton WR1339/PBS (1:7, v/v) (37Tietge U.J.F. Bakillah A. Maugeais C. Tsukamoto K. Hussain M.M. Rader D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2134-2139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Situ Loop Technique—Small intestines were opened by making two small incisions at both ends and flushed with PBS. A loop (20 cm) was made by tying with strings (38Pan X. Terada T. Irie M. Saito H. Inui K. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G57-G64Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 39Pan X. Terada T. Okuda M. Inui K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 307: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). PBS (1.2 ml) containing [3H]triolein or [3H]cholesterol (2.5 μCi/ml) and cholesterol (0.2 mg/ml) was introduced into the loop with a microsyringe. After 2 h, entire loops were collected. In addition, the rest of the intestines until the distal incision were collected and divided into four segments. Total counts in plasma, HDL, and non-HDL apoB-lipoproteins were measured as described previously (36Iqbal J. Hussain M.M. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1491-1501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, counts in the intestinal loop and various segments as well as the liver were measured. Measuring MTP Activity—Assays were performed in triplicate in black 96-well microtiter plates as described (40Athar H. Iqbal J. Jiang X.C. Hussain M.M. J.

Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1779-1785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A final reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 5 μlof vesicles and 95 μl of buffer (blank) or sample containing 100 μg of microsomal proteins (40Athar H. Iqbal J. Jiang X.C. Hussain M.M. J.

The microtiter plates were incubated at 37 °C, and at predetermined time points, samples were excited at 485 nm, and fluorescence was measured at 550 nm. To determine percentage of lipid transfer, fluorescence values obtained from control assays containing no MTP (blanks) were subtracted from sample values and then divided by the total fluorescence present in the vesicles reduced by blanks. To obtain total fluorescence, donor vesicles (5 μl) were incubated with 95 μl of isopropyl alcohol for 5 min (40Athar H. Iqbal J. Jiang X.C. Hussain M.M. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 764-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Under anesthesia, the small intestine and liver were removed at different times. The small intestine was flushed with ice-cold PBS, and the mucosa was scraped. Portions of the mucosa and liver slices were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen for later preparation of microsomes and isolation of total RNA. Microsomal proteins from rat and mice small intestine and liver were isolated as described previously (40Athar H. Iqbal J. Jiang X.C. Hussain M.M. J.

Ther. 2003; 307: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The relative densities of the bands in each reaction were determined using a densitometer. Isolation of Primary Enterocytes—Primary enterocytes were isolated at 1200 and 2400 h as described before (36Iqbal J. Hussain M.M. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1491-1501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 43Iqbal J. Anwar K. Hussain M.M. J. Biol.

Briefly, mice were anesthetized, and intestinal contents were removed and washed with 117 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.96 mm NaH2PO4, 26.19 mm NaHCO3, and 5.5 mm glucose and then filled with 67.5 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm KCl, 0.96 mm NaH2PO4, 26.19 mm NaHCO3, 27 mm sodium citrate, and 5.5 mm glucose (buffer A). Intestines were then bathed in oxygenated saline at 37 °C for 10 min. The buffer was discarded, and intestinal lumen were refilled with buffer A containing 1.5 mm EDTA and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and incubated in 0.9% sodium chloride solution at 37 °C for 10 min. Luminal contents were collected and centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 min. All buffers were adjusted to pH 7.4, gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 for 20 min, and maintained at 37 °C prior to use. Metabolic Labeling of Enterocytes and Immunoprecipitation of Proteins—Isolated mouse primary enterocytes were preincubated in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 30 min and pulsed with [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml). At various times, cells were lysed in solubilization buffer (PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 5 mmol/liter EDTA, 1 mmol/liter EGTA, 2 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 kallikrein-inactivating units/ml of aprotinin, 0.1 mmol/liter leupeptin, 5 μmol/liter N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal. The lysates were centrifuged for 10 min in a microcentrifuge (13,000 rpm), and the supernatants were collected. To immunoprecipitate either MTP or GAPDH, specific antibodies were added to the supernatants at a final dilution of 1:100. Tubes were rotated for 2 h at 4 °C, 20 μl of a 10% solution of protein A-Sepharose was added, and incubation continued for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. Protein A-anti-MTP complexes were collected by centrifugation at 6,000 rpm for 10 min. Pellets were washed three times in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, buffer containing 0.10 m NaCl and 1% Triton X-100. Antibody-antigen complexes were disrupted by adding 200 μl of buffer containing 10 mm Tris-glycine, pH 8.3, 8 m urea, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and heating to 95 °C for 5 min. After centrifugation to remove insoluble material (1,000 rpm, 1 min), supernatants were applied to SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were separated by electrophoresis. Gels were stained, treated with Autofluor, dried, and exposed to phosphorimaging screens at room temperature for 1–3 days. The signal was quantified with an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager model 51. Radiolabeled proteins visualized on the fluorographs were quantified by cutting the corresponding bands from the gels, adding scintillation mixture, and counting in a liquid scintillation counter (44Hussain M.M.

Isolation of Total RNA and Quantitative Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction—Total RNA was isolated from the intestine and liver using Trizol reagents (1 ml/100 mg of tissue) (45Pan X. Terada T. Okuda M. Inui K. J. Nutr. 2004; 134: 2211-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and RNA concentrations were measured by spectrophotometry. Isolated total RNA was reverse-transcribed, and the reaction mixtures were quantified by real time PCR on the ABI Prism 7000HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) as described previously (42Pan X.

Open table in a new tab Nuclear Run-on Assays—The nuclei (1–1.5 × 108) were suspended in a 2× reaction buffer consisting of transcription buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.3 m KCl), 1 mm each ATP, CTP, and GTP, and 500 μCi of α-[32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol, 20 mCi/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The nuclei were then digested with 20 μl of 1 mg/ml RNase-free DNase I for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by incubating this reaction mixture with 200 μl of stop solution (2% SDS, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA) and 15 μl of 20 mg/ml proteinase K and 38 μlof 10 mg/ml yeast RNA at 55 °C for 50 min. RNA was extracted by the RNA Trizol method and precipitated by adding an equal amount of cold isopropyl alcohol at −20 °C. RNA precipitates were washed with 75% ethanol. The dried radiolabeled RNA pellets were suspended in RNase-free water and used for hybridization. For hybridization, cDNAs (10 μg) were applied to nitrocellulose membrane using a Bio-Dot SF Microfiltration Apparatus (Bio-Rad) and cross-linked by exposing to the UV light. Drs. Stephanie Dougan and Richard S. Blumberg (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) kindly provided mouse MTP cDNA. GAPDH was cloned in the pZErO-2 vector (Invitrogen), and the vector alone was used as a negative control. The membranes were prehybridized (overnight, 42 °C) in Express Hyb supplemented with heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA. The hybridization was carried out with 32P-labeled in vitro transcribed RNA obtained from nuclei in fresh pre-heated Express Hyb for 72 h at 42 °C. The filters were washed once with 6× sodium chloride-sodium citrate (6× SSC) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.6, 1 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA (Tris-NaCl-EDTA) containing 1% SDS at 42 °C for 15 min; washed three times in Tris-NaCl-EDTA buffer containing 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 42 °C for 15 min; and washed in the same buffer containing 0.2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 42 °C for 30 min. The membranes were air-dried and exposed to x-ray film for 72 h at −70 °C. Statistical Analysis—GraphPad Prism was used for graphing and statistical evaluations. Statistical significance was evaluated using Student's t test. Each time point represents the mean from five or six animals. Correlations were calculated using Spearman's two-tailed t test. Data are presented as means ± S.D. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Diurnal Variations in Plasma Lipids and ApoB-Lipoprotein Levels—To determine the diurnal variations in lipids and lipoprotein levels, plasma was collected at different times. Fig. 1A shows changes in rat plasma triglyceride during 24 h. Total plasma triglyceride levels were 2-fold higher at midnight (2400 h, 114 ± 26 mg/dl) than those present at midday (1200 h, 62 ± 16 mg/dl). Triglyceride in apoB-lipoproteins (Fig. 1B) at 2400 and 1200 h were 96 ± 10 and 12 ± 2 mg/dl, respectively, indicating 6–10-fold change within a day. No significant changes were observed in HDL triglyceride (Fig. 1C). Plasma cholesterol also showed diurnal variations (Fig. 1D); however, changes were not as prominent as those seen for triglyceride. Again, apoB-lipoprotein cholesterol (Fig. 1E) changed significantly within 24 h, but HDL cholesterol did not (Fig. 1F). We also measured changes in plasma lipid levels in mice (Fig. 2). Triglycerides in plasma (Fig. 2A) as well as in apoB-lipoprotein (Fig. 2B) were high in the night and low in the day. In contrast, changes in HDL levels (Fig. 2C) were not significantly different. Similar to triglyceride, plasma cholesterol levels were high at 2400 h in plasma (Fig. 2D) and apoB-lipoproteins (Fig. 2E) but not different in HDL (Fig. 2F). Analyses of plasma apolipoproteins showed that apoB levels were higher at midnight than at midday (Fig. 2G); however, apoAI levels were similar (Fig. 2H). These data show that plasma lipid levels change significantly within a day mainly due to changes in apoB-lipoproteins.FIGURE 2Diurnal variations in plasma lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins in mice. Plasma was obtained from male C57BL/6J mice (10 weeks old) at 1200 h (n = 6) and 2400 h (n = 6). Triglyceride (A–C) and cholesterol (D–F) levels in the plasma, non-HDL apoB-lipoproteins, and HDL were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each point represents the mean ± S.D., n = 5–6. Plasma was subjected to Western blot, and apoB100/apoB48 (G) and apoAI (H) are shown. Values from three different gels were averaged and plotted as bar graphs. Error bars, S.D.

https://openalex.org/W2021525060,"Reduced sensitivity to insulin in adipose, muscle, and liver tissues is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes. Animal models and patients with type 2 diabetes exhibit elevated levels of circulating retinol-binding protein (RBP4), and RBP4 can induce insulin resistance in mice. However, little is known about how RBP4 affects insulin signaling. We examined the mechanisms of action of RBP4 in primary human adipocytes. RBP4-treated adipocytes exhibited the same molecular defects in insulin signaling, via IRS1 to MAP kinase, as in adipocytes from patients with type 2 diabetes. Without affecting autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor, RBP4 blocked the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS1 at serine (307) [corresponding to serine (302) in the murine sequence] and concomitantly increased the EC50 (from 0.5 to 2 nM) for insulin stimulation of IRS1 phosphorylation at tyrosine. The phosphorylation of IRS1 at serine (312) [corresponding to serine (307) in the murine sequence] was not affected in cells from diabetic patients and was also not affected by RBP4. The EC50 for insulin stimulation of downstream phosphorylation of MAP kinase ERK1/2 was increased (from 0.2 to 0.8 nM) by RBP4. We show that ERK1/2 phosphorylation is similarly impaired in adipocytes from patients with type 2 diabetes. However, the sensitivity to insulin for downstream signaling to control of protein kinase B and glucose uptake was not affected by RBP4. When insulin-resistant adipocytes from patients with type 2 diabetes were incubated with antibodies against RBP4, insulin-induced phosphorylation of IRS1 at serine (307) was normalized and the EC50 for insulin stimulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was reduced. Endogenous levels of RBP4 were markedly reduced in adipocytes from obese or type 2 diabetic subjects, whereas expression levels of RBP4 mRNA were unaffected. These findings indicate that RBP4 may be released from diabetic adipocytes and act locally to inhibit phosphorylation of IRS1 at serine (307), a phosphorylation site that may integrate nutrient sensing with insulin signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1990084147,"Pre-mRNA splicing is a crucial step in gene expression, and accurate recognition of splice sites is an essential part of this process. Splice sites with weak matches to the consensus sequences are common, though it is not clear how such sites are efficiently utilized. Using an in vitro splicing-complementation approach, we identified PUF60 as a factor that promotes splicing of an intron with a weak 3′ splice-site. PUF60 has homology to U2AF65, a general splicing factor that facilitates 3′ splice-site recognition at the early stages of spliceosome assembly. We demonstrate that PUF60 can functionally substitute for U2AF65 in vitro, but splicing is strongly stimulated by the presence of both proteins. Reduction of either PUF60 or U2AF65 in cells alters the splicing pattern of endogenous transcripts, consistent with the idea that regulation of PUF60 and U2AF65 levels can dictate alternative splicing patterns. Our results indicate that recognition of 3′ splice sites involves different U2AF-like molecules, and that modulation of these general splicing factors can have profound effects on splicing."
https://openalex.org/W2108162986,"The purpose of our study was to develop a tool for blocking the function of a specific leukocyte ecto-enzyme in vivo. ART2.2 is a toxin-related ecto-enzyme that transfers the ADP-ribose moiety from NAD onto other cell surface proteins. ART2.2 induces T cell death by activating the cytolytic P2x7 purinoceptor via ADP-ribosylation. Here, we report the generation of ART2.2-blocking single domain antibodies from an immunized llama. The variable domain of heavy-chain antibodies (VHH domain) represents the smallest known antigen-binding unit generated by adaptive immune responses. Their long CDR3 endows VHH domains with the extraordinary capacity to extend into and block molecular clefts. Following intravenous injection, the ART2.2-specific VHH domains effectively shut off the enzymatic and cytotoxic activities of ART2.2 in lymphatic organs. This blockade was highly specific (blocking ART2.2 but not the related enzymes ART1 or ART2.1), rapid (within 15 min after injection), and reversible (24 h after injection). Our findings constitute a proof of principle that opens up a new avenue for targeting leukocyte ecto-enzymes in vivo and that can serve as a model also for developing new antidotes against ADP-ribosylating toxins."
https://openalex.org/W2043938664,"Background The induction of tumor angiogenesis, a pathologic process critical for tumor progression, is mediated by multiple regulatory factors released by tumor and host cells. We investigated the role of the hematopoietic cytokine erythropoietin as an angiogenic factor that modulates tumor progression. Methodology/Principal Findings Fluorescently-labeled rodent mammary carcinoma cells were injected into dorsal skin-fold window chambers in mice, an angiogenesis model that allows direct, non-invasive, serial visualization and real-time assessment of tumor cells and neovascularization simultaneously using intravital microscopy and computerized image analysis during the initial stages of tumorigenesis. Erythropoietin or its antagonist proteins were co-injected with tumor cells into window chambers. In vivo growth of cells engineered to stably express a constitutively active erythropoietin receptor EPOR-R129C or the erythropoietin antagonist R103A-EPO were analyzed in window chambers and in the mammary fat pads of athymic nude mice. Co-injection of erythropoietin with tumor cells or expression of EPOR-R129C in tumor cells significantly stimulated tumor neovascularization and growth in window chambers. Co-injection of erythropoietin antagonist proteins (soluble EPOR or anti-EPO antibody) with tumor cells or stable expression of antagonist R103A-EPO protein secreted from tumor cells inhibited angiogenesis and impaired tumor growth. In orthotopic tumor xenograft studies, EPOR-R129C expression significantly promoted tumor growth associated with increased expression of Ki67 proliferation antigen, enhanced microvessel density, decreased tumor hypoxia, and increased phosphorylation of extracellular-regulated kinases ERK1/2. R103A-EPO antagonist expression in mammary carcinoma cells was associated with near-complete disruption of primary tumor formation in the mammary fat pad. Conclusions/Significance These data indicate that erythropoietin is an important angiogenic factor that regulates the induction of tumor cell-induced neovascularization and growth during the initial stages of tumorigenesis. The suppression of tumor angiogenesis and progression by erythropoietin blockade suggests that erythropoietin may constitute a potential target for the therapeutic modulation of angiogenesis in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1968728409,"Stem cells are characterized by two defining features, the ability to self-renew and to differentiate into highly specialized cell types. The POU homeodomain transcription factor Oct4 (Pou5f1) is an essential mediator of the embryonic stem cell state and has been implicated in lineage specific differentiation, adult stem cell identity, and cancer. Recent description of the regulatory networks which maintain ‘ES’ have highlighted a dual role for Oct4 in the transcriptional activation of genes required to maintain self-renewal and pluripotency while concomitantly repressing genes which facilitate lineage specific differentiation. However, the molecular mechanism by which Oct4 mediates differential activation or repression at these loci to either maintain stem cell identity or facilitate the emergence of alternate transcriptional programs required for the realization of lineage remains to be elucidated. To further investigate Oct4 function, we employed gene expression profiling together with a robust statistical analysis to identify genes highly correlated to Oct4. Gene Ontology analysis to categorize overrepresented genes has led to the identification of themes which may prove essential to stem cell identity, including chromatin structure, nuclear architecture, cell cycle control, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Our experiments have identified previously unappreciated roles for Oct4 for firstly, regulating chromatin structure in a state consistent with self-renewal and pluripotency, and secondly, facilitating the expression of genes that keeps the cell poised to respond to cues that lead to differentiation. Together, these data define the mechanism by which Oct4 orchestrates cellular regulatory pathways to enforce the stem cell state and provides important insight into stem cell function and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2127340981,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a major regulator of physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Recently it was reported that the delivery of VEGF using recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors reduces muscle damage and promotes muscle regeneration in different experimental models of muscle necrosis. We demonstrate that intramuscular administration of rAAV-VEGF improved pathophysiology of the mdx mouse, a model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). One month after injection, rAAV-VEGF-treated muscles showed augmented expression of VEGF and immunolocalization of its receptor, VEGFR-2. VEGF-treated mdx mice showed increased forelimb strength and strength normalized to weight. Treatment reduced necrotic fibers area and increased regenerating fibers area with an augmented number of myogenin-positive satellite cells and myonuclei, and of developmental myosin heavy chain-positive fibers. Only the regenerating area showed increased capillary density. This study provides novel evidence of a VEGF beneficial effect in mdx mice that is exerted mainly by a proregenerative and angiogenic effect. It opens new therapeutic prospectives in DMD and other types of muscular disorders."

It is long held that G protein function is localized to the plasma membrane.

Unexpectedly, G protein subunits shuttle rapidly (t½ < 1 min) between the plasma membrane and intracellular membranes. We show that consistent with such shuttling, G proteins constitutively reside in endomembranes. Furthermore, we show that shuttling is inhibited by 2-bromopalmitate.

However, the spatiotemporal dynamics of G protein localization in a living cell has not been examined to determine whether G protein subunits are stably constrained to the PM. Although there is longstanding evidence for the existence of G protein subunits in intracellular membranes such as the Golgi complex and suggestions that they affect protein trafficking (6Ercolani L.

Toxicol. 2006; 46: 151-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), it has been unclear as to how they reach endomembranes and if they are native to these membranes or in transit to the PM. Here we used a variety of imaging methods on live cells with fluorescent protein-tagged G protein subunits including photoswitchable Dronpa (12Ando R. Mizuno H. Miyawaki A. Science. 2004; 306: 1370-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar) to observe G protein movement. A fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based G protein sensor was used to examine whether G proteins reside constitutively in the endomembranes. The results show that G protein subunits shuttle rapidly between the PM and endomembranes in cells in the basal state maintaining a pool of G proteins in the endomembranes. We show that the shuttling is likely diffusive and not vesicle-mediated. Furthermore, 2-bromopalmitate (2BP), an inhibitor of palmitoylation (13Resh M.D. Methods. 2006; 40: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), inhibited shuttling, suggesting that it may be regulated by acylation. Details of chemicals, expression constructs, cell lines, transfection, and treatment of cells are as in Saini et al. (41Saini D.K. Kalyanaraman V. Chisari M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24099-24108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Dronpa fluorescent proteins were introduced downstream of Gly-92 in αo as in the αo-CFP construct that we have shown previously to possess normal functional properties (14Azpiazu I. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27709-27718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) or at the N terminus of γ subunits. Image Acquisition and Processing—Cells were cultured in 35-mm glass bottom dishes (World Precision Instruments) or on acid-washed glass coverslips and transiently transfected with appropriate combinations of different G protein subunits as described in the text and figure legends. After 16–24 h posttransfection the cells were processed for imaging. Cells were washed with Hanks’ buffer saline solution supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and maintained in this buffer during imaging experiments. For FRET experiments, the coverslips were mounted on an imaging chamber with an internal volume of 25 μl (Warner Instruments). Details are available in Saini et al. (41Saini D.K. Kalyanaraman V. Chisari M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24099-24108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For confocal microscopy cells were visualized with an Olympus LSM Fluoview FV300 microscope using a 40× oil immersion objective (1.3 NA). Images of cells expressing YFP, Dronpa, and green fluorescent protein (GFP) were acquired with a Multi-line argon laser using 488-nm excitation and with emission filter BA 505-525. Images of galactosyl transferase-DsRed monomer were acquired using a Green HeNe laser line for excitation at 543 nm with emission filter BA 560–600. Images were acquired with Fluoview FV300 software and then processed with MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices Corp., Downingtown, PA). For FRAP, FLIP, and analysis using Dronpa, images were acquired with the lasers mentioned above. Laser intensity for YFP/GFP/Dronpa excitation was 0.5–1% (488 nm) and for Gal-T-DsRed-monomer excitation was 5–10% (543 nm). To restrict UV damage in Dronpa photoactivation (PA) experiments, selective PA of the Golgi was performed at 458 nm (100% intensity) for 2–3 s after whole cell bleaching (488 nm at 100% laser intensity). In FRAP and FLIP experiments Golgi or cytosolic region was bleached for 1–2 s at 488 nm with 100% laser intensity. All bleaching and photoactivation was done using iterative scanning (10 times for bleaching and 20 times for PA). The first point in the FRAP and PA plots includes the time for bleaching or PA and confocal lag time, which was constant at 4 s. All FRAP experiments were performed with transiently transfected cells except for γ11, which was analyzed using previously characterized CHO cells stably expressing muscarinic M2 receptor (M2-CHO) (15Azpiazu I. Cruzblanca H. Li P. Linder M. Zhuo M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35305-35308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and G protein subunits αo-CFP, β1, and YFP-γ11. Image brightness and contrast were altered equally for the entire series of images using Metamorph to allow better visualization of the recovery in the Golgi complex. Intrinsic pixel intensity values were not altered by these changes. For FRET analysis through photobleaching experiments, the FRET was determined by monitoring gain in CFP emission intensity in PM or Golgi by photobleaching of YFP (acceptor photobleaching) (14Azpiazu I. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27709-27718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cells with equal expression levels of CFP and YFP were selected. CFP and YFP images were acquired. YFP was then photobleached for 2–3 min using YFP excitation without any neutral density filter. After photobleaching of YFP, another CFP image was captured and subsequently CFP intensity from PM or Golgi was analyzed from pre- and post-photobleaching images for calculating FRET efficiency. Percentage change in CFP signal was calculated using the formula (CCfinal - CCinitial/CCinitial) × 100, where CC is CFP emission intensity. Initial and final values were those before and after photobleaching. The emission intensity was corrected for CFP bleaching by determining it in cells expressing αo-CFP alone. In agonist-treated cells, the cells were first stimulated with 100 μm carbachol, and FRET was examined in the same way as described above. G Protein Subunits Shuttle between PM and Endomembranes—To explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of G protein subunit localization in a live cell, we expressed the αo subunit tagged with either GFP or Dronpa, a photoswitchable fluorescent protein (12Ando R. Mizuno H. Miyawaki A. Science. 2004; 306: 1370-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar), in CHO cells. Fluorescent proteins were independently introduced downstream of Gly-92 in αo as in the αo-CFP construct that we have shown previously to possess normal functional properties (14Azpiazu I. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27709-27718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Apart from the PM, αo-GFP was localized to the endomembranes, predominantly to the Golgi complex based on colocalization with a Golgi marker (galactosyl transferase (GalT)) (Fig. 1). When Golgi fluorescence was bleached and the recovery in the bleached region was determined (FRAP), fluorescence recovered rapidly, indicating retrograde movement (Fig. 1A). The recovery seen indicated a t½ less than 1 min. We similarly examined a G protein β subunit, β1, the predominant β subunit in mammalian tissues. Similar to the α subunit, it was distributed in the PM and in endomembranes, predominantly Golgi (Fig. 1A). The resolutions of the images that we have obtained do not preclude the possibility that some of the signal from the tagged G protein subunits in the PM is from endosomes in proximity to the PM. In FRAP experiments fluorescence recovered rapidly in the Golgi region of cells expressing YFP-β1 (Fig. 1A). The recovery seen with the fluorescent protein-tagged G protein subunits in the FRAP experiments could not be ascribed to intrinsic recovery of GFP or YFP fluorescence or new protein synthesis because it was <5% in cells that were fully bleached over the period of the experiment (e.g. Fig. 1A, right, black line in YFP-β1). Because β subunits are tightly bound to a γ subunit (16Gautam N. Downes G.B. Yan K. Kisselev O. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), these results also indicated that γ subunits in the cell capable of binding β1 were also shuttling. We then examined different γ subunit types with distinct receptor-induced translocation properties (41Saini D.K. Kalyanaraman V. Chisari M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24099-24108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). γ9 and γ11 translocate rapidly from the PM to endomembranes on receptor activation, whereas γ2 and γ3 do not translocate. FRAP experiments showed that all four subunits, however, shuttle between the PM and endomembranes. The recovery of γ9 and γ3 is shown in Fig. 1A. Fig. 2, right, blue, shows recovery from several different cells for γ11. γ2 also demonstrated recovery in a similar FRAP experiment (supplemental Fig. 1). The recovery observed in FRAP experiments cannot be ascribed to the movement of fluorescent protein from the Golgi complex in other planes, since the bleaching is complete along the z axis. (supplemental Fig. 2). The recovery of the α, β, and γ subunits was incomplete in each case, consistent with the relatively large size of the Golgi in CHO cells and the high concentration of the tagged subunits in the Golgi of cells examined similar to Ras in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (17Rocks O. Peyker A. Kahms M. Verveer P.J. Koerner C. Lumbierres M. Kuhlmann J. Waldmann H. Wittinghofer A. Bastiaens P.I. Science. 2005; 307: 1746-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). The partial recovery may also result from the presence of immobile subunits in the membranes.FIGURE 2Effect of 2BP on G protein subunit shuttling. Cells were treated with 50 μm 2BP for 30 min at 37 °C. A, FRAP of CHO cells transfected with αo-GFP (n = 4 each) in treated and untreated cells was determined as in Fig. 1. B, FRAP of YFP-γ11 (n = 6 each) stably co-expressed with αo-CFP and β1 in M2-CHO cells. Experimental conditions for FRAP recovery are as in Fig. 1. Plots show changes in fluorescence intensity from individual cells untreated (blue) and treated with 2BP (red). Bar, 5 μm. Yellow circles show the Golgi area monitored for recovery after photobleaching. Plots are normalized to the prebleach intensity value. C, cytosolic FLIP (C-FLIP) of YFP-γ11 stably co-expressed with αo-CFP and β1 in M2-CHO cells. A small area in the cytosol was bleached (yellow square)(6×, 1 s every 15 s). Intensity after each photobleaching event was measured in selected regions on the PM and the Golgi proximal and distal to the bleached region (colored rectangles). In our experimental conditions only 50% of cells treated with 2BP do not show reduction in both proximal PM and Golgi regions, and only the values from those cells are plotted. Plots show the ratio of the mean pixel intensity ± S.E. (n = 5 each) in the proximal/distal regions of the PM (top) and the Golgi (bottom). The values are normalized to the prebleach values. Plots are significantly different at each time point after the second photobleaching in a t test (in the PM, p < 0.01; in the Golgi, p < 0.005).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test for α subunit anterograde movement, αo-Dronpa was photoactivated in the Golgi (Golgi PA) (Fig. 1B). Fluorescence increased over time in the PM, suggesting rapid movement through the cytosol to the PM. The t½ was <1 min, consistent with the rapidity of the retrograde movement. Golgi PA experiments with Dronpa-γ9 and -γ2 showed that both subunits show anterograde movement similar to αo (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. 1). Additional experiments show that the recovery of fluorescence detected in the PM in the Golgi PA experiments is not the result of photoactivation of Dronpa-tagged proteins on the PM above and below the confocal plane. (i) Photoactivation of a relatively small region of the Golgi in Dronpa-γ9-expressing cells results over time in the appearance of fluorescence uniformly over the entire PM, whereas similar PA of a region on the PM results in localized appearance of fluorescence on the PM (supplemental Fig. 4). (ii) Selective bleaching of fluorescence in the PM of a YFP-γ11-expressing cell results in the appearance of fluorescence in the PM over time and a decrease in Golgi region fluorescence (supplemental Fig. 5). Similar FRAP and Dronpa PA experiments with γ2 showed that this subunit type also shuttles between the PM and endomembranes. Together these results show that regardless of translocation properties, γ subunits shuttle rapidly between the PM and intracellular membranes in the basal state. The ability of βγ2 and βγ3 to shuttle rapidly between PM and Golgi but not translocate on receptor activation is consistent with the prediction that the relative affinities of γ subunits for an activated receptor determine their ability to translocate (18Akgoz M. Kalyanaraman V. Gautam N. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 1758-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because a mammalian cell in the basal state contains most G proteins in the inactive heterotrimer form so that constitutive activity of the dissociated subunits is curtailed, the shuttling of the different G protein subunits suggests that endogenous α, β, and γ subunits shuttle between the PM and endomembranes. It also suggests that G proteins most likely shuttle as heterotrimers. The shuttling of G protein subunits seen here is not peculiar to CHO cells because both FRAP and PA experiments using a different cell line, HeLa cells, showed rapid shuttling of αo and γ9 between PM and endomembranes (supplemental Fig. 6). G Protein Shuttling Is Likely Diffusion-mediated—The rapidity of shuttling and the transient appearance of a cytosolic signal in photoactivation experiments suggested that the shuttling of G protein subunits is diffusion-mediated. In addition, the anterograde diffusion of G protein subunits in the basal state and reverse translocation of βγ on receptor inactivation are much faster than the known rate of vesicular transport from Golgi to PM, which is estimated to be 3% per min (19Hirschberg K. Miller C.M. Ellenberg J. Presley J.F. Siggia E.D. Phair R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1485-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 20Zhang G.F. Driouich A. Staehelin L.A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 819-831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these indicators, nocodazole and monensin, which block vesicular trafficking through different mechanisms (21Choudhury A. Dominguez M. Puri V. Sharma D.K. Narita K. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1541-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), did not have any effect on the retrograde or anterograde movement of α or βγ subunits detected using FRAP or Golgi PA (not shown). supplemental Fig. 7 shows a control for nocodazole action. Rapid retrograde movement of YFP-γ9 occurred at 10 °C. Vesicle-mediated trafficking in cells has been shown to be inhibited at temperatures below 16 °C (22Punnonen E.L. Ryhanen K. Marjomaki V.S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These results suggest that shuttling between the Golgi and PM is likely to be diffusive. Shuttling and Translocation Are Inhibited by 2BP—The G protein α subunits belonging to the Gi/o, Gs, and Gq families are palmitoylated (5Chen C.A. Manning D.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1643-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and the palmitoyl moiety can be turned over in the basal deactivated state (t½ > 60 min for αi; 90 min for αs) (23Chen C.A.

We tested whether acylation played a role in the shuttling of G protein subunits and the translocation of the βγ complex between PM and endomembranes by examining the effect of 2BP, an inhibitor that has been used for identifying palmitoylation (13Resh M.D. Methods. 2006; 40: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) of proteins. Although 2BP has been used to demonstrate the acylation dependence of protein movement (e.g. Refs. 17Rocks O. Peyker A. Kahms M. Verveer P.J. Koerner C. Lumbierres M. Kuhlmann J. Waldmann H. Wittinghofer A. Bastiaens P.I. Science. 2005; 307: 1746-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar and 26Goodwin J.S. Drake K.R. Rogers C. Wright L. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Philips M.R. Kenworthy A.K. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), it is also known to inhibit other processes unrelated to palmitoylation (13Resh M.D. Methods. 2006; 40: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 27Vukmirica J. Tran K. Liang X. Shan J. Yuan J. Miskie B.A. Hegele R.A. Resh M.D. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14153-14161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In FRAP experiments 30 min of treatment with 50 μm 2BP inhibited the recovery of fluorescence in the Golgi region of cells expressing αo-GFP, YFP-γ11, or YFP-γ9 (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. 8). The variation in inhibition is consistent with previous results using 2BP and is due to the variable effective concentration of 2BP inside cells due to variations in cell density (17Rocks O. Peyker A. Kahms M. Verveer P.J. Koerner C. Lumbierres M. Kuhlmann J. Waldmann H. Wittinghofer A. Bastiaens P.I. Science. 2005; 307: 1746-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 28Mikic I. Planey S. Zhang J. Ceballos C. Seron T. von Massenbach B. Watson R. Callaway S. McDonough P.M. Price J.H. Hunter E. Zacharias D. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 414: 150-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The inhibition of retrograde movement of γ11 occurred in a cell that stably expressed αo-CFP, β1, and YFP-γ11 (Fig. 2B). This result showed that retrograde movement occurs regardless of whether G protein subunits are transiently introduced or stably expressed. To further examine the G protein subunit movement between the PM and Golgi, cells stably expressing YFP-γ11, β1, and αo-CFP were examined. A region of the cytosol was selected in these cells after scanning along the z axis to ensure lack of overlap with the Golgi and bleached repeatedly (1 s each) with 15-s pauses to allow recovery (cytosolic FLIP, C-FLIP). The resulting images showed a rapid decrease in the proximal but not distal portions of the PM and the Golgi regions (Fig. 2C). When the YFP-γ11 stable cells were treated with 2BP, half the cells examined did not show the differential decrease in fluorescence between the proximal and distal regions of the PM or Golgi seen in untreated cells. The variation in the response to 2BP among cells is consistent with the FRAP results and previous 2BP experiments (17Rocks O. Peyker A. Kahms M. Verveer P.J. Koerner C. Lumbierres M. Kuhlmann J. Waldmann H. Wittinghofer A. Bastiaens P.I. Science. 2005; 307: 1746-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). One interpretation of this behavior of YFP-γ11 is that there is acylation-dependent two-way movement of the protein through the cytosol between the PM and Golgi. Although such rapid shuttling of G proteins from Golgi to PM is unanticipated, it has been previously suggested based on the localization of palmitoyl lacking α subunits that acylation at endomembranes facilitates PM localization of a G protein (29Michaelson D. Ahearn I. Bergo M. Young S. Philips M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3294-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 30Takida S. Wedegaertner P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17284-17290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The 2BP inhibition may also inhibit an unidentified process that is not related to palmitoylation of a G protein subunit or a binding protein (13Resh M.D. Methods. 2006; 40: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 27Vukmirica J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 27709-27718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we stably expressed αo-CFP-β1-YFP-γ11 heterotrimer in CHO cells that also stably express M2 muscarinic receptors. The M2-expressing cells (M2-CHO) have been characterized before (15Azpiazu I. Cruzblanca H. Li P. Linder M. Zhuo M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35305-35308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A FRET signal was detected in the PM of the cells (Fig. 3A, right, left gray bar). FRET was abrogated on receptor activation with an agonist showing that the G protein present on the PM was capable of getting activated (Fig. 3A, right, left white bar). When the same cells were treated with 2BP, although the relative intensity of YFP and CFP was lower, basal FRET was obtained in 75–80% of the cells (Fig. 3A, right, right gray bar). The FRET was abrogated by agonist addition (Fig. 3A, right, right white bar). This result shows that G protein activation per se is not affected by 2BP treatment. We notice that the G protein subunits are present in the PM and Golgi after 30 min of 2BP treatment. Similar to the G protein subunits, H-Ras is also present on the PM after 30 min of treatment with 2BP (17Rocks O. Peyker A. Kahms M. Verveer P.J. Koerner C. Lumbierres M. Kuhlmann J. Waldmann H.

Kenworthy A.K. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Much longer periods of exposure to 2BP leads to the accumulation of G protein subunits and H-Ras in the Golgi (26Goodwin J.S. Drake K.R. Rogers C. Wright L. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Philips M.R. Kenworthy A.K. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 29Michaelson D. Ahearn I. Bergo M. Young S. Philips M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3294-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The reasons for these differences are unclear. G Proteins Are Residents of Endomembranes—There has been evidence for the presence of G protein subunits in endomembranes and suggestions from assays that they may have roles in protein trafficking through the endomembranes and Golgi disassembly (6Ercolani L. Stow J.L. Boyle J.F. Holtzman E.J. Lin H. Grove J.R. Ausiello D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4635-4639Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 8Pimplikar S.W. Simons K.

Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2006; 46: 151-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, it has been unclear how G protein subunits reach endomembranes and if they are resident therein rather than molecules in transit to the PM through the endomembrane system. Here we detected αo-CFP and YFP-γ11 at approximately equal levels in the Golgi and PM in stably transfected M2-CHO cells (Fig. 3B). Cycloheximide treatment for 6–8 h had no effect on this distribution (not shown). FRET signals of similar efficiencies in the PM and Golgi of cells were detected even in the absence of protein synthesis (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that G proteins exist as heterotrimeric residents of endomembranes. The results here suggest that G proteins shuttle rapidly, continually, and diffusively in the basal state between the PM and endomembranes. The observation here that tagged α, β, and γ subunits shuttle when expressed independently indicates that endogenous G protein subunits in mammalian cells shuttle between the PM and endomembranes. The results also suggest that shuttling occurs in the heterotrimeric form. The G protein heterotrimer is known to be inactive (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4714) Google Scholar, 2Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar, 3Neves S.R.

Rev. 2003; 24: 765-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Thus, the constant redistribution of G protein molecules occurring between the PM and endomembranes is unlikely to result in changes in downstream signaling activity. However, receptor stimulation allows this shuttling to be harnessed for the translocation of free and potentially active βγ complexes to specific endomembranes at different rates (41Saini D.K. Kalyanaraman V. Chisari M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24099-24108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The rapid shuttling of G protein subunits identified here allows pools of G proteins to coexist in the PM and intracellular membranes in dynamic equilibrium. Proteins diffuse at rates that are at least an order of magnitude more in the cytosol compared with the PM (31Quatela S.E. Philips M.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cytosolic diffusion of G protein subunits thus allows the more rapid movement necessary for constantly sensing the surfaces of internal membranes. Similar to these unexpected G protein properties, H-Ras and N-Ras have been definitively demonstrated to be functional residents of intracellular membranes and to shuttle between the PM and Golgi controlled by an acylation cycle with t½ values ranging from 1 to 10 min (17Rocks O. Peyker A. Kahms M. Verveer P.J. Koerner C. Lumbierres M. Kuhlmann J. Waldmann H. Wittinghofer A. Bastiaens P.I.

Cullen P.J. Pellicer A. Cox A.D. Philips M.R. Nature. 2003; 424: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Acylation-regulated binding of Ras to the PM was predicted earlier based on the analysis of Ras peptides (34Schroeder H. Leventis R. Rex S. Schelhaas M. Nagele E. Waldmann H. Silvius J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13102-13109Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). K-Ras has been shown to translocate on neuronal activation (t½ > 10 min) (35Fivaz M. Meyer T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 429-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) consistent with the dynamic nature of its binding to the PM (36Silvius J.R. Bhagatji P. Leventis R. Terrone D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 192-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). But the rapid kinetics of βγ shuttling and translocation here is more reminiscent of protein kinase C translocation to the PM from the cytosol in response to Ca2+ increase (t½ < 10 s) (37Teruel M.N. Meyer T. Cell. 2000; 103: 181-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 38Schechtman D. Craske M.L. Kheifets V. Meyer T. Schechtman J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15831-15840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), although reverse translocation of βγ occurs directly in response to receptor inactivation. It is possible that an acylation cycle similar to that recently discovered in Ras (17Rocks O. Peyker A. Kahms M. Verveer P.J. Koerner C. Lumbierres M. Kuhlmann J. Waldmann H. Wittinghofer A. Bastiaens P.I. Science. 2005; 307: 1746-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 26Goodwin J.S. Drake K.R. Rogers C. Wright L. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Philips M.R. Kenworthy A.K. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) may be at the basis of the shuttling and translocation of G protein subunits (41Saini D.K. Kalyanaraman V. Chisari M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24099-24108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). YFP-tagged H- and N-Ras were shown to be present in the Golgi and in FRAP experiments to show retrograde movement from the PM to the Golgi (17Rocks O. Peyker A. Kahms M. Verveer P.J. Koerner C. Lumbierres M. Kuhlmann J. Waldmann H. Wittinghofer A. Bastiaens P.I. Science. 2005; 307: 1746-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 26Goodwin J.S. Drake K.R. Rogers C. Wright L. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Philips M.R. Kenworthy A.K. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In the case of G proteins, a high rate of α subunit acylation and deacylation could potentially mediate G protein shuttling. Although the known palmitoyl turnover rates of α subunits are not in agreement, the rapid FRAP kinetics of a 32-residue N-terminal peptide specific to the αi1 subunit (17Rocks O. Peyker A. Kahms M. Verveer P.J. Koerner C. Lumbierres M. Kuhlmann J. Waldmann H. Wittinghofer A. Bastiaens P.I. Science. 2005; 307: 1746-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) is consistent with such a likelihood. However, α subunit acylation cycling cannot explain 2BP inhibition of receptor-induced βγ translocation (41Saini D.K. Kalyanaraman V. Chisari M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24099-24108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) because the α subunit never cotranslocates with βγ. Alternative possibilities are that βγ subunit acylation has remained unidentified or an unknown protein that undergoes acylation cycles binds to the βγ complex. Importantly, given the known effects of 2BP on other cellular processes (13Resh M.D. Methods. 2006; 40: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 27Vukmirica J. Tran K. Liang X. Shan J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 14153-14161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), there is also the possibility that 2BP acts on an unidentified cellular process that has an effect on G protein movement. It is notable that lipidated hydrophobic G protein subunits are able to diffuse rapidly through the cytosol. It is possible that an unidentified protein masks the lipid moieties, allowing cytosolic diffusion. Protein partners that facilitate cytosolic trafficking by masking the hydrophobic prenyl moiety are known; for instance, specific guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors in the case of Rab and Rho proteins, which are prenylated similar to βγ (39Wu S.K. Zeng K. Wilson I.A. Balch W.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 472-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 40DerMardirossian C. Bokoch G.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 356-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Several potential candidates in the form of G protein subunit-binding proteins are known whose functions are not fully defined (11Sato M. Blumer J.B. Simon V. Lanier S.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2006; 46: 151-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Overall, the shuttling of G protein subunits seen here allows heterotrimeric G proteins to continuously and rapidly test the cytoplasmic surfaces of the PM and internal membranes, maintain populations of G proteins in intracellular membranes, differentially act at a distance in response to receptor activation, and reverse on receptor inactivation, properties that appear to be uniquely suited for G protein-coupled receptor signaling and have not been anticipated previously.

https://openalex.org/W1990354312,"To identify the underlying reason for the controversial performance of tetracycline (Tet)-controlled regulated gene expression in mammalian neurons, we investigated each of the three components that comprise the Tet inducible systems, namely tetracyclines as inducers, tetracycline-transactivator (tTA) and reverse tTA (rtTA), and tTA-responsive promoters (P(tets)). We have discovered that stably integrated P(tet) becomes functionally silenced in the majority of neurons when it is inactive during development. P(tet) silencing can be avoided when it is either not integrated in the genome or stably-integrated with basal activity. Moreover, long-term, high transactivator levels in neurons can often overcome integration-induced P(tet) gene silencing, possibly by inducing promoter accessibility."
https://openalex.org/W1991043567,"Adipocyte differentiation is regulated by a complex array of extracelluar signals, intracellular mediators and transcription factors. Here we describe suppression of adipocyte differentiation by TRBs, mammalian orthologs of Drosophila Tribbles. Whereas all the three TRBs were expressed in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, TRB2 and TRB3, but not TRB1, were immediately down-regulated by differentiation stimuli. Forced expression of TRB2 and TRB3 inhibited adipocyte differentiation at an early stage. Akt activation is a key event in adipogenesis and was severely inhibited by TRB3 in 3T3-L1 cells. However, the inhibition by TRB2 was mild compared with severe inhibition by TRB3, though TRB2 suppressed adipogenesis as strongly as TRB3. Interestingly, TRB2 but not TRB3 reduced the level of C/EBPβ, a transcription factor required for an early stage of adipogenesis, through a proteasome-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, knockdown of endogenous TRB2 by siRNA allowed 3T3-L1 cells to differentiate without full differentiation stimuli. These results suggest that inhibition of Akt activation in combination with degradation of C/EBPβ is the basis for the strong inhibitory effect of TRB2 on adipogenesis.

Adipocytes play a key role for energy homeostasis by storing and releasing surplus energy. Adipose tissues are categorized into two functionally different types: white adipose tissue (WAT) 3The abbreviations used are: WAT, white adipose tissue; BAT, brown adipose tissue; DMEM, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; Dex, dexamethasone; MCE, mitotic clonal expansion; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; Mix, methyl-isobutyl-xanthine. stores excess energy as triglycerides and releases fatty acids in response to energy needs (1Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 2001; 104: 531-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar), while brown adipose tissue (BAT) releases energy as heat by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation from the respiratory chain (2Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 277-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (4640) Google Scholar). In addition, adipose tissues form an endocrine system by secreting adipokines that regulate energy homeostasis (3Kershaw E.E. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 2548-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (3754) Google Scholar). Alterations in adipose tissues, either excess or deficiency, are associated with metabolic disorders (4Grundy S.M. Brewer Jr., H.B. Cleeman J.I. Smith Jr., S.C. Lenfant C. Circulation. 2004; 109: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (4333) Google Scholar). In the past decade, genetic studies using knock-out mice have identified several key transcription factors that regulate adipocyte development. CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) belong to the large family of bZIP transcription factors. C/EBPα knock-out mice show reduced fat accumulation in both WAT and BAT (5Wang N.D. Finegold M.J. Bradley A. Ou C.N. Abdelsayed S.V. Wilde M.D. Taylor L.R. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Whereas adipogenesis is only slightly impaired in mice deficient for either C/EBPβ or C/EBPδ, C/EBPβ/δ double knock-out mice show severe defects in BAT development (6Tanaka T. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7432-7443Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a member of nuclear hormone receptors superfamily, is also known to be required for adipocyte differentiation (7Rosen E.D. Sarraf P. Troy A.E. Bradwin G. Moore K. Milstone D.S. Spiegelman B.M. Mortensen R.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar). Besides genetic evidences in vivo, these transcription factors have been characterized in vitro by using cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and established cell lines such as 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A (8Green H. Kehinde O. J. Cell. Physiol. 1979; 101: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 9Green H. Meuth M. Cell. 1974; 3: 127-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). In the adipocyte differentiation in vitro, expression of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ is immediately up-regulated in response to differentiation stimuli (10Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon induction of differentiation, preadipocytes undergo synchronous cell division, which is termed mitotic clonal expansion (MCE). MCE is required for subsequent adipose conversion and is a C/EBPβ-dependent process (11Tang Q.Q. Otto T.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 850-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). After several rounds of cell cycle, expression of C/EBPα and PPARγ is induced, which then stimulates the expression of adipogenic genes (10Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to transcriptional networks, sets of signal cascades have been reported to modulate the adipogenic program. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, ERK, p38 and JNK, coordinate adipogenesis positively or negatively (12Bost F. Aouadi M. Caron L. Binetruy B. Biochimie (Paris). 2005; 87: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Wnt-10b is expressed in preadipocytes, and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway negatively regulates early adipogenesis (13Ross S.E. Hemati N. Longo K.A. Bennett C.N. Lucas P.C. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A. Science. 2000; 289: 950-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar). Insulin and IGF signals are known to affect adipogenesis (14Gregoire F.M. Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 783-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar), and mice deficient for IRSs or Akt, components of the insulin-signal cascade, show impaired adipogenesis (15Miki H. Yamauchi T.

In this study we describe roles of mammalian orthologs of Tribbles in adipogenesis. Tribbles was originally described in Drosophila as a regulator of Sting/CDC25 and three mammalian orthologs were subsequently found. They share a conserved motif highly homologous to serine/threonine kinases; however they lack key residues required for kinase activity (18Grosshans J. Wieschaus E. Cell. 2000; 101: 523-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 19Mata J. Curado S. Ephrussi A. Rorth P.

Biol. 2000; 10: 623-629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In Drosophila oogenesis, Tribbles acts as a negative regulator for Slbo, a Drosophila ortholog of mammalian C/EBPs (21Rorth P. Szabo K. Texido G. Mol Cell. 2000; 6: 23-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Mouse TRB3 has been reported to be an Akt-binding protein and inhibit the activation of Akt by IGF in hepatocytes (22Du K. Herzig S. Kulkarni R.N. Montminy M. Science. 2003; 300: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Human TRB1 and TRB3 associate with MAP kinase kinase and modulate MAP kinase cascades in a dose-dependent mechanism (23Kiss-Toth E. Bagstaff S.M. Sung H.Y. Jozsa V. Dempsey C. Caunt J.C. Oxley K.M. Wyllie D.H. Polgar T. Harte M. O'Neill L.A. Qwarnstrom E.E. Dower S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42703-42708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). TRB2 was originally identified as a phosphorylated protein induced by thyroid hormone in dog thyroid cells (24Wilkin F. Suarez-Huerta N. Robaye B. Peetermans J. Libert F. Dumont J.E. Maenhaut C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 660-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Overexpression of TRB2 also inhibited Akt activation (22Du K. Herzig S. Kulkarni R.N. Montminy M. Science. 2003; 300: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), while its biological function still remains unknown. Here we show that TRB2 and TRB3 exhibit anti-adipogenic effects through distinct mechanisms, i.e. both TRB2 and TRB3 inhibit Akt activation and TRB2 promotes proteasome-dependent degradation of C/EBPβ. Cell Culture and Differentiation—3T3-L1 preadipocytes were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% bovine serum until confluence and maintained in the same medium for another 2 days. Adipogenesis were induced by a protocol previously described (25Miyaoka Y. Tanaka M. Naiki T. Miyajima A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37913-37920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), in brief, cells were then induced to differentiate in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.5 mm methyl-isobutyl-xanthine (Mix), 1 μm dexamethasone (Dex), and 5 μg/ml insulin. After 2 days, the medium was switched to DMEM containing 10% FBS and 5 μg/ml insulin. Two days later, cells were shifted to DMEM containing 10% FBS. Eight days after the addition of MDI, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and stained with Oil-Red-O. Retroviral experiments were performed as follows. PLATE cells were transfected with 4 μg of pMX vectors at 60% confluence. After 2 days, the retroviral supernatant was centrifuged and resuspended in fresh medium containing 8 μg of polybrene. 3T3-L1 cells were plated prior to infection and then incubated with viral medium for 24 h. Infected cells were propagated for each experiment. In experiments using C/EBPβ or PPARγ, control or TRB-expressing cells were sorted by a FACS vantage and then infected with virus for expression of C/EBPβ or PPARγ. Cells were induced to adipogenesis with MDI and troglitarizone. MEFs were prepared form E 14.5 mouse embryo by standard protocol. MEFs were infected with virus and induced to differentiate as described above. Plasmids Construction—Mouse TRB1, TRB2, and TRB3 cDNAs were amplified by PCR with the sets of primers TN068 (5′-GGATCCGAATGCGGGTCGGTCCCGTG-3′) and TN049 (5′-AGAGAGGCGACACCACATTG-3′), TN069 (5′-GGATCCGAATGAACATACACAGGTC-3′), and TN045 (5′-CCCATGCTACGTGTTCCGTC-3′), TN070 (5′-GGATCCGAATGCGAGCTACACCTCTG-3′), and TN047 (AGGCACAGGAACGAATAAGG-3′), respectively. In addition to full-length TRB2, we obtained one clone that was alternatively spliced and had a premature termination codon at the 242 amino acid position. We used this construct as a C-terminal-truncated TRB2 (TRB2ΔC). To construct FLAG-tagged TRBs, BamHI-NotI-digested fragments were cloned into the BamHI-NotI sites of the pCDNA3-FLAG vector. To generate retroviral vectors expressing FLAG-tagged TRBs, HindIII-NotI fragments were subcloned into pBluescript, and then SalI-NotI-digested fragments were cloned into the XhoI-NotI-linearized pMX vector. C/EBPβ expressing construct used for immunoprecipitation experiments was generated as follows. The coding region of C/EBPβ was amplified by PCR with sets of primers TN099 (5′-GAATTCATGCACCGCCTGCTGGCCTG-3′) TN198 (5′-CTAGCAGTGGCCCGCCGAGGC-3′) and then cloned into the pCDNA3 vector. Northern Blot and Quantitative PCR Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 10 μg of each RNA samples was loaded on a 1% agarose gel containing 5.5% formaldehyde and resolved by electrophoresis. RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane and then hybridized with dioxygenin (DIG)-labeled antisense probe. After washing and blocking, membrane was incubated with AP-conjugated anti-DIG antibodies, and the signal was detected by CDP-star. For quantitative PCR, total RNA was prepared from cells with TRIzol. After DNase treatment, cDNA was generated and analyzed by Light Cycler (Roche Applied Sciences) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. GAPDH was used as an internal standard. BrdU Labeling—Cells were plated on glass coverslips and cultured until confluence. Confluent cells were maintained for another 2 days, induced to differentiate with MDI for 12 h, and then labeled for 12 h with 10 μm BrdU. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 70% ethanol for 20 min. After denaturation (2 n HCl for 20 min) and neutralization (0.1 m sodium borate, pH 8.5), cells were incubated with anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody and subsequently probed with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. A coverslip was mounted on a slide glass with GEL/MOUNT containing Hoechst 33342 and analyzed by microscopy. Two independent experiments were performed. To examine the percentage of BrdU positive cells, four fields (more than 1000 cells) were counted. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.075 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% Triton X-100). Extracts were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. The supernatants were incubated at 4 °C overnight with protein G-Sepharose beads bounded with anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma) antibody. Immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer and boiled in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nylon membrane. After blocking procedure, proteins were immunoblotted with anti-Akt (Cell Signaling), anti-phospho-Akt (Thr308, Ser437, Cell Signaling), anti-C/EBPβ (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-FLAG antibodies and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Experiments were performed independently for three times, and the levels of Akt phosphorylation and LAP protein were quantified by NIH Image. RNA Interference—Expression virus vectors for luciferase and TRB2 shRNA were generated as follows. Target sequence, Luc (5′-GGATGAAGAGAGGACTCGT-3′) or TRB2 (5′-GGATGAAGAGAGGACTCGT-3′), was ligated with the linearized pSIREN-RetroQ vector (BD) as described by the manufacturer. Retroviral medium was prepared as described above. Mouse Tribbles Orthologs Are Differentially Regulated during Adipogenesis—It has been shown that insulin and IGF are key molecules in early adipogenesis (14Gregoire F.M. Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 783-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar). Whereas TRB3 was previously shown to modulate Akt-mediated insulin signaling (22Du K. Herzig S. Kulkarni R.N. Montminy M. Science. 2003; 300: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), it remained unclear whether TRB3 is integrated in the adipogenic program. To investigate a possible involvement of TRB3 in adipogenesis, we first examined the expression of TRB3, together with two other mouse Tribbles orthologs, TRB1 and TRB2, during adipocyte differentiation. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were induced to differentiate with Mix, Dex, and insulin (MDI) and then analyzed by quantitative PCR. As shown in Fig. 1A, TRB2 but not TRB1 or TRB3 was reduced in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells as compared with undifferentiated cells. TRB2 was also decreased in MEF cells that were cultured with MDI (Fig. 1B). To understand the regulatory mechanism of TRB expression during adipogenesis, we examined the mRNA levels of TRBs at various points. TRB3 was expressed in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and disappeared 1 day after MDI treatment (Fig. 1C, day 1). Interestingly, however, TRB3 expression was oscillated by medium change; the expression was restored and reached a level higher than undifferentiated cells next day (Fig. 1C, day 2). It was reduced again when fresh medium was added at day 3 and increased again in the following day (Fig. 1C, days 3 and 4). As compared with TRB3, TRB1 and TRB2 showed distinct expression patterns. TRB1 was increased at day 2 and day 4, whereas TRB2 was reduced by differentiation stimuli, and its expression remained low throughout the differentiation process. TRB3 expression was also oscillated in the absence of MDI; however the extent was smaller than that in differentiating cells, whereas TRB1 and TRB2 were not altered. Enforced Expression of TRB2 or TRB3 Inhibits Differentiation of 3T3-L1 Preadipocytes—To investigate whether the expression of TRB2 and TRB3 affects adipocyte differentiation, we created cells stably expressing TRB2 or TRB3. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were infected with virus carrying the cDNA for TRB2 or TRB3. Constitutive expression of TRBs did not affect the growth of these cells before differentiation (data not shown). Infected cells were grown to confluence and then induced to differentiate with MDI. Eight days after induction, control cells harbored lipid droplets as visualized by Oil-Red-O staining, whereas lipid accumulation was severely impaired in cells expressing TRB2 or TRB3 (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the defects in adipogenesis, expression of aP2, an adipogenic gene encoding a fatty acid-binding protein, was reduced in both TRB2- and TRB3-expressing cells (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, C/EBPα and PPARγ, transcription factors required for adipogenesis, were also reduced in those TRB-expressing cells. In contrast, expression of C/EBPβ, an early inducible gene during adipogenesis in vitro, was unaffected by enforced expression of TRB2 and TRB3 (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that constitutive expression of TRB2 or TRB3 inhibits the adipogenic program at an early step. To further confirm the effects of TRB2 and TRB3 in different cells, we expressed TRB2 and TRB3 in MEFs and examined their effect on adipogenesis. As shown in Fig. 2D, the level of aP2 mRNA was significantly reduced in MEFs infected with TRB2- or TRB3-expression virus as compared with control virus. Thus, TRB2 and TRB3 have anti-adipogenic function in mammalian cells. Peng et al. (16Peng X.D. Xu P.Z. Chen M.L. Hahn-Windgassen A. Skeen J. Jacobs J. Sundararajan D. Chen W.S. Crawford S.E. Coleman K.G. Hay N. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1352-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) previously showed that the induction of C/EBPα and PPARγ expression was defective in MEFs prepared from Akt1/2 double knock-out mice. Because TRB3 has been reported to function as an inhibitor for Akt (22Du K. Herzig S. Kulkarni R.N. Montminy M. Science. 2003; 300: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) and TRB-expressing cells exhibited defects similar to Akt1/2 knock-out MEFs, we examined the possibility that TRBs inhibit adipogenesis via Akt. To this end, we analyzed the phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 and Ser473, indicative of Akt activation (26Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). After confluence, virus-infected cells were cultured in the presence or absence of MDI and then subjected to Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3, Akt was phosphorylated in response to MDI in control cells. The phosphorylation of Akt was severely inhibited in cells expressing TRB3, suggesting that TRB3 blocks the adipocyte differentiation by inhibiting Akt signaling. In contrast, TRB2 had a modest effect on the Akt activation, while it suppressed adipogenesis as strongly as TRB3, suggesting that TRB2 blocks adipocyte differentiation by a mechanism distinct from TRB3. TRB2 Reduces the Level of LAP Protein through a Proteasome-dependent Mechanism—It was previously reported that in Drosophila, Tribbles associates with Slbo, a protein homologous to mammalian C/EBP proteins, and promotes its degradation through a proteasome-dependent manner (21Rorth P. Szabo K. Texido G. Mol Cell. 2000; 6: 23-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To investigate whether mammalian Tribbles orthologs have similar function, we examined the level of C/EBP proteins during adipogenesis in cells expressing TRB2 or TRB3. As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, the C/EBPβ mRNA level was unchanged by enforced expression of TRBs, but the induction of C/EBPα was impaired in cells expressing TRBs. Thus, we examined the level of C/EBPβ protein in cells expressing either TRB2 or TRB3. Control and TRB-expressing cells were induced to differentiate with MDI and then subjected to Western blot analysis. It has been shown that C/EBPβ isoforms, LAP and LIP, are produced through an alternative translation or through a proteolytic cleavage (27Baer M. Johnson P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26582-26590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 28Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 29Welm A.L. Timchenko N.A. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1695-1704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LAP possesses the DNA binding and trans-activating domains, whereas LIP lacks the trans-activating domain and acts as an inhibitor (28Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). The levels of both C/EBPβ isoforms in TRB3-expressing cells were similar to those in control cells, whereas LAP was significantly reduced in TRB2-expressing cells (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, LIP, an inhibitory isoform of C/EBPβ, was found at similar levels in both control and TRB2-expressing cells. To test if the reduction of LAP by TRB2 is proteasome dependent, we examined the effect of a proteasome inhibitor, MG132. As shown in Fig. 4B, the LAP protein level was recovered when TRB2-expressing cells were treated with MG132, indicating that the degradation of LAP is promoted in TRB2-expressing cells. These results strongly suggest that TRB2 inhibits adipogenesis by down-regulating the protein level of the active C/EBPβ isoform LAP. To test this idea, we examined MCE that is a C/EBPβ-dependent process in early adipogenesis. Control and TRB2-expressing cells were induced to differentiate and cell-cycle progression was monitored by BrdU incorporation. Control cells entered cell cycle and incorporated BrdU by differentiation stimuli. Expression of TRB2 resulted in reduction of BrdU positive cells compared with control cells (Fig. 4C). Thus, enforced expression of TRB2 impairs a C/EBPβ-dependent process during adipogenesis. If insufficiency of C/EBPβ results in defective adipogenesis in TRB2-expressing cells, enforced expression of C/EBPβ would suppress the TRB2-dependent defects. To examine this hypothesis, we created cells exogenously expressing C/EBPβ and induced differentiation. Overexpression of C/EBPβ enhanced adipogenesis in control cells and TRB2-expressing cells could differentiate to adipocytes by expression of exogenous C/EBPβ (supplemental Fig. S1). These results support the model that C/EBPβ is a target of TRB2. TRB2 Physically Interacts with C/EBPβ Isoform LAP, but Not with LIP—Given the analogous function of Tribbles and TRB2 in the regulation of C/EBP protein, we next examined the physical interaction between TRB2 and C/EBPβ in mammalian cells. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-TRB2 and C/EBPβ. Extracts prepared from transfected cells were analyzed by immunoprecipitation. Full-length C/EBPβ (38-kDa), LAP (35-kDa), and LIP (21-kDa) proteins were produced by the C/EBPβ expression vector in HEK293 cells. Both full-length C/EBPβ and LAP proteins were co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-TRB2, whereas LIP was not detected in the immunocomplex (Fig. 4D). In 3T3-L1 cells, full-length C/EBPβ and LAP were reduced by TRB2, whereas LIP was not affected by TRB2 (Fig. 4E). Taken together, the physical interaction between TRB2 and the active C/EBPβ isoform is correlated with the reduction of C/EBPβ protein. To uncover the molecular feature of TRB2, we made a C-terminally truncated TRB2 (TRB2ΔC) that partially lacks the conserved kinase-like domain (Fig. 5A). 3T3-L1 cells were infected with the TRB2ΔC expression virus vector and then induced to differentiate with MDI. Although cells expressing full-length TRB2 failed to differentiate, TRB2ΔC-expressing cells as well as control cells were converted into adipocytes and accumulated lipid droplets (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, enforced expression of TRB2ΔC did not affect expression of adipogenic genes and the level of C/EBPβ protein (Fig. 5, C, D, and E). We next examined the association of C/EBPβ with tuncated-TRB2 and found that TRB2ΔC physically interacted with LAP (Fig. 5F). Thus, the C-terminal region is important for TRB2 function rather than the association with C/EBPβ. PPARγ Rescues the Defects of Adipogenesis in Cells Expressing TRB2 or TRB3—The induction of C/EBPα and PPARγ are dependent on C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ in cultured cells (7Rosen E.D. Sarraf P. Troy A.E. Bradwin G. Moore K. Milstone D.S. Spiegelman B.M. Mortensen R.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, TRB2 reduced the level of C/EBPδ as well as C/EBPβ protein. If TRB2 inhibits adipogenesis by degrading C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, PPARγ could suppress the defects of TRB2-expressing cells. To test this hypothesis, we created cells expressing both TRB2 and PPARγ and then induced to differentiate. As shown in Fig. 6, cells expressing TRB2 and PPARγ rarely differentiated to adipocytes in the absence of a PPARγ ligand, troglitazone, whereas they could differentiate in the presence of troglitazone. However lipid droplets in TRB2-expressing cells were smaller than those in control cells. We next examined the effects of PPARγ on adipogenesis in cells expressing TRB3. It has been shown that expression of PPARγ is defective in Akt deficient MEFs and PPARγ rescues the defects of adipogenesis (16Peng X.D. Xu P.Z. Chen M.L. Hahn-Windgassen A. Skeen J. Jacobs J. Sundararajan D. Chen W.S. Crawford S.E. Coleman K.G. Hay N. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1352-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). If TRB3 inhibits adipogenesis by attenuating Akt activation, PPARγ also should rescue the defects of TRB3-expressing cells. Predictably, TRB3-expressing cells as well as control cells differentiated to adipocytes by activation of PPARγ (Fig. 6) These results indicate that TRB2 and TRB3 inhibit events prior to PPARγ-dependent processes, however the effect of PPARγ was partial in TRB2-expressing cells, suggesting that TRB2 may inhibits a PPARγ-dependent process as well (See “Discussion”). Induction of Adipogenesis by TRB2 Knockdown in Response to a Low Concentration of Dexamethasone—To clarify the role of endogenous TRB2 in adipocyte differentiation, we knocked down the expression of TRB2 in 3T3-L1 cells with retrovirus expressing shRNA. The mRNA level of endogenous TRB2 was significantly reduced in cells expressing TRB2 shRNA as compared with control cells (Fig. 7, A and B). TRB2 knockdown cells showed no obvious defects in growth (data not shown). As TRB2 reduced the levels of active isoforms of C/EBPβ, knockdown of TRB2 may activate the adipogenic program more efficiently. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether TRB2 knockdown cells undergo adipogenesis by a low concentration of differentiation stimuli, MDI. However, we did not observe adipogenesis in both control and TRB2-knockdown cells in the presence of 1/100 of the normal concentration of MDI. Because Mix, Dex, and insulin are required for various processes in adipogenesis, it is possible that knockdown of TRB2 failed to complement the reduction of all three inducers. It has been reported that Pref-1, an anti-adipogenic factor, is downregulated in response to Dex and decrease of Pref-1 by antisense RNA allowed cells differentiate in a low concentration of Dex (30Smas C.M. Chen L. Zhao L. Latasa M.J. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12632-12641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). If endogenous TRB2 has a negative role in an adipogenic process in response to specific agent, TRB2 knockdown could complement the reduction of such agent. To test whether TRB2 is down-regulated in response to a specific agent, we examined effects of each inducer on TRB2 expression and found that the TRB2 level was reduced by Dex (Fig. 8A). We then examined adipocyte differentiation in a low concentration of Dex. 3T3-L1 cel"

The Institute of Medicine recommended that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Heath Resources and Services Administration coordinate efforts to survey a random sample of HIV-infected persons in care, in order to more accurately measure the need for prevention and care services. The Medical Monitoring Project (MMP) was created to meet these needs. This manuscript describes the evolution and design of MMP, a new nationally representative clinical outcomes and behavioral surveillance system, and describes how MMP data will be used locally and nationally to identify care and treatment utilization needs, and to plan for prevention interventions and services."

Accordingly, protein-protein cross-linking experiments demonstrated that this sequence allows the self-association of CD23 into trimers and higher oligomers (13Dierks S.E. Bartlett W.C. Edmeades R.L.

In addition to the soluble fragments, there are two forms of CD23 that can be expressed in the cell membrane. CD23a and CD23b differ by 6 or 7 amino acids at the N terminus of the cytoplasmic sequence and have different modes of regulation, cell type expression, and functions (22Yokota A. Kikutani H.

The present work demonstrates that the critical parameter is the structure, not the size, of CD23 fragments. We have expressed three recombinant fragments of human CD23, “derCD23,” mimicking the fragment released by the Der p I protease; “exCD23,” representing the entire extracellular sequence of CD23; and “lzCD23,” the extracellular sequence with an isoleucine zipper (30Harbury P.B. Kim P.S. Alber T. Nature. 1994; 371: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) attached to the N terminus to stabilize the oligomeric structure (14Chen B.H. Ma C. Caven T.H. Chan-Li Y.

Recombinant derCD23 comprised amino acids Ser156-Glu298 (Mr 16,789), including the lectin domain and 16 amino acids (Asp283-Glu298) of the C-terminal tail of human CD23. exCD23 comprised amino acids Asp48-Ser321 (Mr 30,991), including the entire tail region. derCD23 and exCD23 were produced and purified as previously described (33Hibbert R.G. Teriete P. Grundy G.J. Beavil R.L. Reljic R. Holers V.M. Hannan J.P. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. McDonnell J.M. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). lzCD23 comprised amino acids Trp45-Ser321 attached to the isoleucine zipper (Mr 37,638). lzCD23 was produced and purified using the protocol described previously by (31Kelly A.E. Chen B.H. Woodward E.C. Conrad D.H. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6696-6704PubMed Google Scholar) with the following alterations. lzCD23 was cloned into pet24a vector (Novagen), complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science) were added to the refold buffer (1 m guanidine HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.4 m arginine, 1:2 mm reduced/oxidized glutathione, 50 mm CHES) to prevent degradation. A sample was analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell), probed with 10 μg/ml anti-CD23 (BU38 clone), and revealed with 1:2000 anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Dako) and ECL (Pierce) to check the purity and integrity of the protein. The oligomeric fragment was further purified by gel filtration using a Superdex-200 column (Amersham Biosciences), using PBS as the running buffer. Fractions containing the oligomer were pooled, concentrated to ∼250 μg/ml, and stored at -80 °C. All CD23 proteins contained <0.1 units/ml endotoxin measured by a commercial chromogenic limulus amebocyte lysate assay (Cambrex). Surface plasmon resonance was used to measure the kinetics of interaction of der-, ex-, and lzCD23 with IgE Fc (Cɛ2-4). All experiments were performed at 25 °C on an automated instrument (Biacore 3000; GE Healthcare). The methods for derCD23 and exCD23 were outlined previously (33Hibbert R.G. Teriete P. Grundy G.J.

A similar protocol was used for determining the kinetics of interaction of lzCD23 with Cɛ2-4. 500-700 RU of biotinylated Cɛ2-4 was immobilized to a streptavidin-coated chip. derCD23 or lzCD23 was injected over the chip in duplicate at a variety of concentrations (1000, 500, 250, and 125 nm) at a flow rate of 20 μl/min in HBS/2 mm CaCl2 with an association phase of 6 min and dissociation phase of 8 min. Regeneration of the chip was performed using 30-s pulses of 10 mm EDTA in HBS and 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.2, followed by a 120-min recovery. Analytical ultracentrifugation studies were performed using a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge as described previously (34Ghirlando R. Keown M.B. Mackay G.A. Lewis M.S. Unkeless J.C. Gould H.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13320-13327Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). exCD23 and derCD23 were dialyzed into Tris-buffered saline plus 2 mm CaCl2 and spun at 4 °C and 17,500, 20,000, and 24,000 rpm (derCD23) or 10,000, 14,000, and 17,000 rpm (exCD23). Data were analyzed using the Beckman analysis software running under Microcal Origin version 3.78 in terms of a single ideal solute to obtain the buoyant molecular mass, M(1 - υ¯ρ). Residuals were calculated by subtracting the best fit of the model from the experimental data. In all cases, a random distribution of the residuals around zero was noted as a function of the radius. To determine the molecular mass of the CD23 fragments, values for partial specific volume were calculated from the sequence using SEDNTERP (available on the World Wide Web), and solvent density was used as previously described (34Ghirlando R.

Data could not be analyzed using a single ideal species model. The buoyant molecular mass of a monomer was calculated based on the solvent density of 1.00709 and partial specific volume of 0.7110 calculated from the sequence, again using SEDNTERP. Using this value, all three concentrations were simultaneously fitted to a range of models using Sigmaplot as described previously (35Shi J. Ghirlando R. Beavil R.L. Beavil A.J. Keown M.B. Young R.J. Owens R.J. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2112-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These included self-association up to hexamers and also mixtures of noninteracting species. derCD23 and exCD23 were also studied in complex with Cɛ2-4. lzCD23 could not be studied in this way, since it is not a monodisperse protein. Samples were dialyzed into Tris-buffered saline, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.05% sodium azide and then mixed in 1:1, 2:1, and 1:2 ratios of CD23·Cɛ2-4 (as described previously for a similar fragment of CD23 binding to Cɛ3-4 (35Shi J. Ghirlando R. Beavil R.L. Beavil A.J. Keown M.B. Young R.J. Owens R.J. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2112-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar)). Data were collected at 10,000, 12,000, and 14,000 rpm for derCD23·Cɛ2-4 and 7,000, 8,500, and 10,000 rpm for exCD23·Cɛ2-4. The data for all three loading ratios were simultaneously fitted to a range of models in Sigmaplot, using experimentally determined buoyant molecular mass values of 18,085 ± 350 Da for the derCD23, 29,990 ± 906 Da for the exCD23, and 19,700 ± 800 for the Cɛ2-4. As previously demonstrated for a similar monomeric fragment of CD23 binding to Cɛ3-4 (35Shi J. Ghirlando R. Beavil R.L. Beavil A.J. Keown M.B. Young R.J. Owens R.J. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2112-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), a 1:1 and 2:1 interaction model fits the derCD23·Cɛ2-4 data well with randomly distributed residuals. Attempts were made to fit the exCD23·Cɛ2-4 data with this and a number of other models (e.g. considering exCD23 as a monomer, dimer, or trimer), but none was found that adequately describes the data obtained. Human B cells were isolated from tonsillar tissue from donors undergoing routine tonsillectomies (ethical approval from Guy’s, King’s and St. Thomas Hospital Trust). Tonsillar mononuclear cells were separated by density on a Ficoll gradient. B cells were then isolated using AET-treated sheep red blood cells. B cells were routinely >98% CD20-positive and <2% CD3-positive as determined by flow cytometry. B cells were cultured in 24-well plates (Nunc) at 0.5 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI with penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Perbio Biosciences Ltd.), transferrin (35 μg/ml), and insulin (5 μg/ml) (Sigma). Cells were activated with 1 μg/ml anti-CD40 antibody (G28.5; ATCC) and 200 IU/ml IL-4 (R&D Systems) for up to 10 days. IgE—Maxisorp plates (Nalge Europe Ltd.) were coated with polyclonal mouse anti-human IgE (DakoCytomation) diluted 1:7000 in carbonate buffer, pH 9.8, for 16 h at 4 °C. Unbound sites were then blocked with 2% marvel in PBS, 0.05% Tween (PBS-T) for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were added at appropriate dilutions to ensure that at least three readings were within the linear portion of the standard curve, and the plates were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C; NIP-IgE (JW8/5/13; ECACC, UK) was used to construct a standard curve. IgE binding was detected by mouse anti-human IgE conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (DakoCytomation) diluted 1:1000 in 1% Marvel PBS-T for 4 h at room temperature. The color reaction was developed with OPD (Sigma). Sensitivity was 10 ng/ml. It was possible that recombinant CD23 interferes with the detection of IgE by ELISA. We investigated this by incubating CD23 fragments with NIP-IgE at 37 °C, employing the same culture conditions as in the experiments with B cells. IgE was then measured using the specific IgE ELISA. IgG—Maxisorp plates were coated with polyclonal goat anti-human IgG (Oxford Biotechnology Ltd.) diluted 1:1000 in carbonate buffer, pH 9.8, for 16 h at 4 °C. Unbound sites were then blocked with 2% Marvel in PBS-T for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were added at appropriate dilutions as described previously, and the plates were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C; total IgG (Sigma) was used to construct standard curves. IgG binding was detected by goat anti-human IgG horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) diluted 1:1000 in 1% Marvel PBS-T for 4 h at room temperature. The color reaction was developed with OPD (Sigma). Sensitivity was 4 ng/ml. Purity and apparent molecular weight of CD23 fragments were determined by 12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Protein was visualized by a Coomassie Blue stain. Western blotting was used to confirm CD23 identity, using anti-CD23 (BU38 clone) and anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase. Bound antibodies were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). One-tailed, paired Student’s t tests were used to calculate p values, significance <0.05. Self-association of derCD23, exCD23, and lzCD23—The CD23 fragments were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each of the three fragments exhibited a principal species of the expected size on SDS gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1a) and was confirmed to be CD23 by Western blotting (data not shown). The CD23 fragments were studied by sedimentation equilibrium in the analytical ultracentrifuge. Fig. 1, c and d, shows the data obtained for derCD23 and exCD23. The data for both fragments could be fitted using a single ideal species model, giving residuals randomly distributed around zero, revealing the fragments to be monomeric. The molecular masses calculated were 18,085 ± 350 Da for the derCD23 and 29,990 ± 906 Da for the exCD23. The structure of derCD23 has been determined by NMR spectroscopy (33Hibbert R.G. Teriete P. Grundy G.J. Beavil R.L. Reljic R. Holers V.M. Hannan J.P. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. McDonnell J.M. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and found to be monomeric at 1.7 mg/ml (100μm), although a small proportion of oligomer could be detected at extremely high concentration, 20 mg/ml (1.2 mm). exCD23 exhibited the propensity to form dimers and trimers at 1 mg/ml (32 μm) in sucrose gradient sedimentation velocity experiments (36Reljic R. The Interaction of CD23 with CR2 and Its Functional Consequences. 1996; (. Ph. D. thesis, University of London.)Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the lectin head alone (derCD23) and the head plus the stalk (exCD23) both have the potential for self-association at sufficiently high concentrations. To compare the activity of exCD23 as a monomer and an oligomer in our assays, we expressed exCD23 with an isoleucine zipper attached to the N terminus to generate lzCD23 (31Kelly A.E. Chen B.H. Woodward E.C. Conrad D.H. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6696-6704PubMed Google Scholar) (calculated molecular mass for a monomer, 37,638 Da). The isoleucine zipper was previously characterized as a trimeric α-helical coiled-coil by x-ray crystallography (30Harbury P.B. Kim P.S. Alber T. Nature. 1994; 371: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1b, lzCD23 eluted from a size exclusion column as a monodisperse protein with an apparent molecular mass of ∼203 kDa. However, the presence of a 15-nm α-helical coiled-coil stalk, extended to 20 nm by the addition of the zipper (4.8 nm), would lead to a highly asymmetric structure and possibly an overestimation of its size by gel filtration. To obtain an unambiguous determination of the size of lzCD23, we used sedimentation equilibrium in the analytical ultracentrifuge (Fig. 2). The data could not be fitted to a species of a single size (data not shown); therefore, data from three concentrations were fitted simultaneously to a wide range of self-association and mixture models. The residuals for the best fit are shown (Fig. 2b); this is for a monomer-trimer-hexamer equilibrium and yields residuals randomly distributed about zero. In addition, fits for monomer-trimer equilibrium (Fig. 2c) and a noninteracting mix of monomers, trimers, and hexamers (Fig. 2d) are shown for comparison, and these are clearly poorer fits to the data, with systematic residuals in both cases. The same result was obtained using data collected at two other speeds and at a lower range of concentrations (data not shown). The effective Kd values for the monomer to trimer and monomer to hexamer equilibria are 3.5 and 14.4 μm, respectively, which, for a total concentration of 12.5 μm lzCD23, the highest concentration examined, leads to calculated values of 3.4 μm for monomeric, 3.0 μm for trimeric, and 2.3 nm for hexameric lzCD23. The proportion of lzCD23 molecules as hexamer is thus extremely low, but their contribution is essential to achieve a good fit to the data. The fraction of lzCD23 molecules in the trimeric form is clearly substantial at all concentrations tested: 73% at 12.5 μm, 68% at 9.3 μm, and 60% at 6.4 μm total concentration. Stoichiometry of the Interaction of CD23 Fragments with Cɛ2-4—To investigate the interaction of derCD23 and exCD23 with IgE-Fc (Cɛ2-4), we used sedimentation equilibrium as previously described for a similar monomeric CD23 fragment binding to Cɛ3-4 (35Shi J. Ghirlando R. Beavil R.L. Beavil A.J. Keown M.B. Young R.J. Owens R.J. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2112-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Fig. 3a shows the data for the derCD23/Cɛ2-4 interaction fitted to the same 1:1 and 2:1 interaction model used in Shi et al. (35Shi J. Ghirlando R. Beavil R.L. Beavil A.J. Keown M.B. Young R.J. Owens R.J. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2112-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and it is clear that this is a good fit to the data. Using a larger fragment of IgE-Fc thus has no effect on the stoichiometry of the interaction. The interaction between exCD23 and IgE-Fc is more complex, although the exCD23 alone is also monomeric. Fig. 3b shows the same 1:1 and 2:1 model fitted to the data, and it is clearly a poor fit. Despite trying an extensive range of other models, we were unable to find one that fits these data. It is clear, however, that the complex (or mixture of complexes) formed is larger than would be expected for the 1:1 and 2:1 interaction, implying that exCD23 must be oligomerizing upon binding to the IgE-Fc. Kinetics of Interaction of CD23 Fragments with Cɛ2-4—To investigate the influence of oligomer formation on the kinetics of interaction with IgE, we immobilized the IgE-Fc (Cɛ2-4) on a Biacore sensor chip and exposed this surface to derCD23 or lzCD23 (Fig. 4). Surface plasmon resonance was measured as a function of time to measure the rate of association with Cɛ2-4 and, after stopping the flow of CD23, to measure the rate of dissociation of the complex. As shown in Fig. 4a, the interaction of derCD23 with Cɛ2-4 was monophasic and exhibited relatively fast on and fast off rates and micromolar (“low”) affinity (KD = 1000 nm). In contrast, lzCD23 exhibited biphasic kinetics (KD ∼ 2000 and 100 nm) (Fig. 4b). Previous analysis of exCD23 yielded binding curves and association constants similar to those of lzCD23, (KD values ∼1000 and 40 nm) (33Hibbert R.G. Teriete P. Grundy G.J. Beavil R.L. Reljic R. Holers V.M. Hannan J.P. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. McDonnell J.M. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Inhibition of IgE Synthesis by Anti-CD23—Having characterized all three CD23 fragments using biophysical techniques, we next investigated their biological activity with respect to IgE synthesis. First, as a control, we examined the antibody, lumiliximab, an anti-CD23 antibody produced as a potential therapy for allergic asthma. Results from in vitro studies clearly showed that lumiliximab blocked the production of IgE in human PBMC (37Nakamura T. Kloetzer W.S. Brams P. Hariharan K. Chamat S. Cao X. LaBarre M.J. Chinn P.C.

Immunopharmacol. 2002; 2: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To determine whether CD23 was involved in IgE synthesis in a purified B cell system, we investigated the outcome of blocking CD23 with lumiliximab. Lumiliximab, added with IL-4 and anti-CD40 to tonsillar B cells, significantly inhibited IgE synthesis by an average of -46% (range -32 to -57%) (Table 1). Clearly, CD23 is involved in IgE production from purified tonsillar B cells. It is not known, however, whether the antibody acts by binding to membrane CD23 or its soluble fragments.TABLE 1Lumiliximab (anti-CD23) at 1 μg/ml inhibits IgE production from tonsillar B cells stimulated with anti-CD40 (1 μg/ml) and IL-4 (200 IU/ml) for 10 daysIgE ± S.D.

In all cases, maximum activity was observed at concentrations equal to or greater than 100 ng/ml (data not shown). We therefore used 100 ng/ml in subsequent experiments. It is notable that 100 ng/ml (6 nm for derCD23, 3 nm for exCD23, and 0.8 nm for lzCD23), is 2-3 orders of magnitude below the observed KD values for the interaction of these fragments with Cɛ2-4. B cells stimulated with anti-CD40 and IL-4 for 10 days produced variable amounts of IgE, depending on the donor (Fig. 5 and Table 2). The addition of derCD23 at 100 ng/ml significantly inhibited IgE synthesis. The percentage inhibition varied between donors but was unrelated to the level of IgE synthesis. Of eight donors tested, six demonstrated inhibition of IgE by derCD23 (mean = -24%; range -59 to +10%). The addition of lzCD23 at 100 ng/ml to the tonsil B cells, stimulated with anti-CD40 and IL-4, significantly up-regulated IgE in six of eight donors (mean +99%, range -41 to +446%) (Fig. 5 and Table 2). The level of stimulation, like that of inhibition by derCD23, varied between donors but was not related to that of IgE production. The addition of exCD23 at 100 ng/ml had no significant effect on anti-CD40- and IL-4-stimulated IgE synthesis (mean -3%, range -38 to +41%)"
https://openalex.org/W2070464215,"In order to survive under extremely cold environments, many organisms produce antifreeze proteins (AFPs). AFPs inhibit the growth of ice crystals and protect organisms from freezing damage. Fish AFPs can be classified into five distinct types based on their structures. Here we report the structure of herring AFP (hAFP), a Ca(2+)-dependent fish type II AFP. It exhibits a fold similar to the C-type (Ca(2+)-dependent) lectins with unique ice-binding features. The 1.7 A crystal structure of hAFP with bound Ca(2+) and site-directed mutagenesis reveal an ice-binding site consisting of Thr96, Thr98 and Ca(2+)-coordinating residues Asp94 and Glu99, which initiate hAFP adsorption onto the [10-10] prism plane of the ice lattice. The hAFP-ice interaction is further strengthened by the bound Ca(2+) through the coordination with a water molecule of the ice lattice. This Ca(2+)-coordinated ice-binding mechanism is distinct from previously proposed mechanisms for other AFPs. However, phylogenetic analysis suggests that all type II AFPs evolved from the common ancestor and developed different ice-binding modes. We clarify the evolutionary relationship of type II AFPs to sugar-binding lectins."
https://openalex.org/W2166383684,"The core complex is a structure involved in the fusion mechanism of many viruses, as well as in intracellular vesicle fusion. A powerful approach for studying the dynamic stages of HIV-1-cell fusion utilizes DP178, a core complex inhibitory peptide derived from the known sequence of the virus. Strikingly, we show that fatty acids can replace the entire C-terminal region of DP178, known to play a crucial role in the activity of the peptide. The inhibitory activity correlated with the length of the fatty acid, with the direction of fatty acid attachment (N- or C-terminus) and, as envisioned by a new triple staining assay, with the concentration of the peptides on cells. Our findings indicate, for the first time, the C-terminal boundary of the endogenous core structure in situ and establish that the C-terminal region of DP178 functions mainly as an anchor to the cell membrane. Apart from the mechanistic implications, such short lipopeptides provide new, promising fusion inhibitors. Because the fusion mechanism of HIV-1 is shared by other pathogen-enveloped viruses and by intracellular vesicle fusion, our results might influence the research and therapeutic efforts in these systems as well."
https://openalex.org/W2138749294,"HIV/AIDS prevalence rates across countries of the world vary more than 500-fold from .06% in Hungary to 33.4% in Swaziland. One of the most cited research papers in the field, utilizing cross country regression analysis to analyze other correlates with this HIV prevalence data, is flawed in that it weights each country's results by the country's population.Based on cross-country linear and multiple regressions using newly gathered data from UNAIDS, the number of female commercial sex workers as a percentage of the female adult population is robustly positively correlated with countrywide HIV/AIDS prevalence levels. Confirming earlier studies, female illiteracy levels, gender illiteracy differences and income inequality within countries are also significantly positively correlated with HIV/AIDS levels. Muslims as a percentage of the population, itself highly correlated with country circumcision rates and previously found to be negatively correlated with HIV/AIDS prevalence, is insignificant when the percentage of commercial sex workers in a population is included in the analysis.This paper provides strong evidence that when conducted properly, cross country regression data does not support the theory that male circumcision is the key to slowing the AIDS epidemic. Rather, it is the number of infected prostitutes in a country that is highly significant and robust in explaining HIV prevalence levels across countries. An explanation is offered for why Africa has been hit the hardest by the AIDS pandemic and why there appears to be very little correlation between HIV/AIDS infection rates and country wealth."
https://openalex.org/W2028607051,"Background Nonadherence to antiretroviral therapy (ARVT) is an important behavioral determinant of the success of ARVT. Nonadherence may lead to virological failure, and increases the risk of development of drug resistance. Understanding the prevalence of nonadherence and associated factors is important to inform secondary HIV prevention efforts. Methodology/Principal Findings We used data from a cross-sectional interview study of persons with HIV conducted in 18 U.S. states from 2000–2004. We calculated the proportion of nonadherent respondents (took <95% of prescribed doses in the past 48 hours), and the proportion of doses missed. We used multivariate logistic regression to describe factors associated with nonadherence. Nine hundred and fifty-eight (16%) of 5,887 respondents reported nonadherence. Nonadherence was significantly (p<0.05) associated with black race and Hispanic ethnicity; age <40 years; alcohol or crack use in the prior 12 months; being prescribed ≥4 medications; living in a shelter or on the street; and feeling “blue” ≥14 of the past 30 days. We found weaker associations with having both male-male sex and injection drug use risks for HIV acquisition; being prescribed ARVT for ≥21 months; and being prescribed a protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen not boosted with ritonavir. The median proportion of doses missed was 50%. The most common reasons for missing doses were forgetting and side effects.

https://openalex.org/W2033157948,"Several families of molecules are implicated in the membrane fusion process between sperm and oocyte. Among these, CD9 tetraspanin, a membrane-organizing molecule, plays a crucial role, since the fertilizing ability of CD9-/- oocytes is dramatically impaired. CD9 controls alpha6-beta1 integrin relocation involved in the membrane reorganization that occurs on oocyte fertilization but is not expressed on sperm. We report here that, together with several other proteins, the CD9 tetraspanin is transferred from the oocyte to the fertilizing spermatozoa present in the perivitelline space before fertilization. Transfer of CD9 from oocyte to sperm from CD9-/- male mice still occurs. CD9 acquisition by sperm results from a transfer of membrane fragments from the plasma membrane of the oocyte, in a process similar to trogocytosis, the recently described mechanism of intercellular exchange of membrane patches. Acquisition of CD9 by the sperm may be crucial for the membrane reorganization in sperm required for fusion with the oocyte, a process that is similar to the role CD9 plays in oocyte membrane reorganization."
https://openalex.org/W1989385767,"Quaking I (QKI) is a selective RNA-binding protein essential for myelination of the central nervous system. Three QKI isoforms with distinct C termini and subcellular localization, namely QKI-5, QKI-6, and QKI-7, are expressed in oligodendroglia progenitor cells (OPCs) prior to the initiation of myelin formation and implicated in promoting oligodendrocyte lineage development. However, the functional requirement for each QKI isoform and the mechanisms by which QKI isoforms govern OPC development still remain elusive. We report here that exogenous expression of each QKI isoform is sufficient to enhance differentiation of OPCs with different efficiency, which is abolished by a point mutation that abrogates the RNA binding activity of QKI. Reciprocally, small interfering RNA-mediated QKI knockdown blocks OPC differentiation, which can be partly rescued by QKI-5 and QKI-6 but not by QKI-7, indicating the differential requirement of QKI isoform function in advancing OPC differentiation. Furthermore, we found that abrogation of OPC differentiation, as a result of QKI deficiency, is not due to altered proliferation capacity or cell cycle progression. These results indicate that QKI isoforms are necessary and sufficient for promoting OPC development, which must involve direct influence of QKI on differentiation/maturation of OPCs independent of cell cycle exit, likely via regulating the expression of the target mRNAs of QKI that support OPC differentiation.

The oligodendroglia progenitor cells (OPCs) are derived from pluripotent neural stem cells in the developing brain (1McMahon A.P. Genes.

After fate specification for the OL lineage, OPCs keep proliferating until they are committed for terminal differentiation (3Gao F.B. Durand B. Raff M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 152-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The maturation of OPC into myelinating OLs is characterized by the extension of numerous branched processes and membrane sheets, along with the expression of myelin-specific structural proteins (4Pfeiffer S.E. Warrington A.E. Bansal R. Trends Cell. Biol. 1993; 3: 191-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Adequate OPC proliferation ensures the generation of sufficient numbers of myelin-producing cells, whereas OPC differentiation is a critical prerequisite for myelin formation. Thus, the transition of OPCs from proliferation to differentiation is a key step that governs central nervous system myelin development (5Temple S. Raff M.C. Cell. 1986; 44: 773-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 6Barres B.A. Lazar M.A. Raff M.C. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, forced cell cycle exit is not sufficient for inducing OPC differentiation (7Tang X.M. Beesley J.S. Grinspan J.B. Seth P. Kamholz J. Cambi F. J. Cell.

QKI is a selective RNA-binding protein that controls the homeostasis and subcellular localization of target mRNAs during OL and myelin development (9Vernet C. Artzt K. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 479-484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar-13Zhang Y. Lu Z. Ku L. Chen Y. Wang H. Feng Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1801-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Deficiency of QKI in OLs results in severe hypomyelination in the quakingviable (qkv) mutant mice (10Hardy R.J. J. Neurosci.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11278-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Three major QKI protein isoforms with distinct C termini are derived from alternative splicing, named QKI-5, QKI-6, and QKI-7 (16Ebersole T.A. Chen Q. Justice M.J. Artzt K. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 17Kondo T. Furuta T. Mitsunaga K. Ebersole T.A. Shichiri M. Wu J. Artzt K. Yamamura K. Abe K. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 662-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). QKI-5 is predominantly localized in the nucleus, whereas QKI-6 and QKI-7 are mainly detected in the cytoplasm (14Hardy R.J. Loushin C.L. Friedrich Jr., V.L. Chen, Q. Ebersole, T.A. Lazzarini, R.A. Artzt, K. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7941-7949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting distinct functional influence by QKI isoforms on their mRNA targets. The common N terminus in QKI isoforms harbors an extended RNA-binding domain homologous to that in the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (KH) (16Ebersole T.A. Chen Q. Justice M.J. Artzt K. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), which is essential for the interaction of QKI with its mRNA ligands and the dimerization between QKI isoforms (18Chen T. Richard S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4863-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, it is believed that the functional interplay of QKI isoforms governs the stability and subcellular localization of their mRNA targets during central nervous system myelin development (11Larocque D. Pilotte J. Chen T. Cloutier F. Massie B. Pedraza L. Couture R. Lasko P. Almazan G. Richard S.

Neurosci. 2005; 8: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In addition to its essential role in myelination, QKI is expressed in cells at the earliest stage of OL lineage development before they migrate away from the subventricular zone (14Hardy R.J. Loushin C.L. Friedrich Jr., V.L. Chen, Q. Ebersole, T.A. Lazzarini, R.A. Artzt, K. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7941-7949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ebersole T.A. Chen Q. Justice M.J. Artzt K. Nat.

Res. 1998; 54: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), suggesting that QKI may function to advance OL lineage development before actual myelination. Consistent with this idea, QKI is up-regulated in OLs when they extend processes to contact axons (14Hardy R.J. Loushin C.L. Friedrich Jr., V.L. Chen, Q. Ebersole, T.A. Lazzarini, R.A. Artzt, K. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7941-7949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Wu H.Y. Dawson M.R. Reynolds R. Hardy R.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 292-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, ectopic expression of exogenous QKI-6 and QKI-7 can force cell cycle exit and differentiation of OPCs (19Larocque D. Galarneau A. Liu H.N. Scott M. Almazan G. Richard S. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, whether endogenous QKI is essential for advancing OL development, and if so, which QKI isoform is functionally required, has not been determined. Whether QKI only accelerates OPC cell cycle exit or whether it also directly promotes OPC differentiation via cell cycle-independent mechanisms is still unknown. In this study, we report that QKI is necessary and sufficient for OPC differentiation. In addition, QKI isoforms exhibit differential abilities in promoting OPC differentiation, which depends on the RNA binding activity of QKI. Furthermore, in the CG4 OPC cell line, RNA interference-mediated QKI knockdown abrogates differentiation without affecting the proliferation capacity or cell cycle progression. These results provide the first evidence suggesting that QKI can exert direct influence on OPC differentiation via cell cycle-independent mechanisms, most likely by regulating the expression of its mRNA targets that encode key proteins for OPC differentiation. Cell Culture—CG4 cells were maintained for proliferation in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 1% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, insulin (5 μg/ml), transferrin (50 μg/ml), PBPS (putrescine (100 mm), biotin (10 ng/ml), progesterone (20 nm), and selenium (30 nm)). Platelet-derived growth factor AA (Sigma) and basic fibroblast growth factor (Promega) were added to the proliferation medium at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml each. Induction of differentiation was achieved by replacing proliferation medium with differentiation medium, which contains Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, insulin, PBPS, transferrin, tri-iodothyronine (50 nm), and 0.5% fetal bovine serum. Primary cultures of OPCs were isolated as described previously (22Osterhout D.J. Wolven A. Wolf R.M. Resh M.D. Chao M.V. J. Cell. Biol. 1999; 145: 1209-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Briefly, mixed glial cultures were prepared from the brains of neonatal rats (P2; Sprague-Dawley, Taconic Farms) and allowed to reach confluence. OPCs were removed by shaking and further purified by immunopanning with A2B5. They were plated onto poly-lysine-coated coverslips and maintained in a defined serum-free medium (22Osterhout D.J. Wolven A. Wolf R.M. Resh M.D. Chao M.V. J. Cell. Biol. 1999; 145: 1209-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) with platelet-derived growth factor and fibroblast growth factor (10 and 20 ng/ml, respectively) to prevent differentiation. Mature OLs were obtained by culturing the OPCs in a defined medium lacking growth factors. Introducing siRNA, Plasmids, and Lentivirus into Cells—Synthetic double-strand small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific for the QKI coding region, 5′-GGACUUACAGCUAAACAACtt-3′ (sense strand), 5′-GUUGUUUAGCUGUAAGUCCtc-3′ (anti-sense strand), and the Silencer® negative control 1 siRNA, were purchased from Ambion, Inc. The plasmids used for transfection include PC-FLAG-QKI-5, QKI-6, QKI-7 (13Zhang Y. Lu Z. Ku L. Chen Y. Wang H. Feng Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1801-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), PC-FLAG-QKI-6kt4 (E48G), GFP-N3, and siRNA-resistant mutant PC-FLAG-QKI-5, -QKI-6, -QKI-7. The siRNA-resistant mutations were generated using the PCR-based GeneTailor® site-directed mutagenesis system (Invitrogen) with the following primers: 5′-ATCCTTGGACCTAGAGGATTGACCGCTAAACAACTT-3′ (forward), 5′-TCCTCTAGGTCCAAGGATTCTCCCAACAAAATTAAA-3′ (reverse). CG4 cells were transfected using a Nucleofector® kit optimized for OLs (Amaxa, Inc.) following the manufacturer’s protocol, and the GFP-N3 plasmid was co-transfected to mark the transfected cells. Three micrograms of plasmid DNA and/or 200 pmol of siRNA were used to transfect 2 × 106 cells/culture. For lentivirus production, pLenti-hU6BX constructs containing either QKI siRNA or the Silencer® negative control 1 siRNA were established by Cellogenetics, Inc. The lentiviruses were produced at the core facility at the Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases at Emory University. Five microliters of each virus were used to transduce cells before being plated into 6-well dishes, which routinely transduce ∼90% of CG4 cells and 80% of primary OPC cells as indicated by the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) encoded by the same virus. Immunocytochemistry and Antibodies—Cells were grown on coverslips for indirect immunofluorescent staining. After being rinsed with PBS, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 15 min at room temperature and blocked with 2% normal goat serum. The anti-O1 antibody (1:1000; Chemicon, Inc.) was incubated with cells overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Immunolabeled cells were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) containing DAPI for nuclei staining. Fluorescent signals were visualized using an Olympus IX-51 fluorescent microscope, and images were captured with a Retica digital camera. Morphological Analysis—Light-field images and fluorescent images of transfected live CG4 cells (GFP-positive) were captured from randomly selected microscopic fields using the Olympus IX-51 inverted fluorescent microscope. Processes were categorized into three groups based on where they originate and counted: the primary processes are directly from the cell body, the secondary processes are from the primary processes, and the tertiary processes are from the secondary processes. More than 30 randomly selected cells were analyzed from each transfected culture. BrdUrd Labeling—To examine the proliferation of CG4 cells, BrdUrd (Sigma) was added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 10 μm. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, cells were fixed with 70% ethanol at -20 °C for 30 min. HCl (2 n) was used to denature DNA for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and blocked with 2% normal goat serum, incubated with anti-BrdUrd (1:1000; Chemicon, Inc.) at room temperature for 1 h followed by secondary antibody incubation and quantitative analysis of cell numbers as described in the legend for Fig. 6. Flow Cytometry Analysis of Cell Cycle—Cells were harvested, washed with ice-cold PBS, and incubated with prechilled 80% ethanol at 4 °C overnight. After washing, cells were treated with 500 μg/ml RNase A in PBS at 37 °C for 30 min followed by incubation with a propidium iodide (Invitrogen) solution (50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) at room temperature for 1 h in dark. DNA content of the cells was measured with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Beckman Instruments), and results were analyzed with Flowjo software (Tree Star, Inc.). Immunoprecipitation and Reverse Transcription-PCR—FLAG QKI-6 was transfected into CG4 cells and immunoprecipitated 48 h after transfection using the anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) as described previously (23Zhao L. Ku L. Chen Y. Xia M. LoPresti P. Feng Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4179-4186Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated complexes were subjected to RNA extraction followed by reverse transcription-PCR using p27Kip1-specific primers: 5′-AGCTTGCCCGAGTTCTAC-3′ (forward) 5′-GGGGAACCGTCTGAAACATT-3′ (reverse). PCDNA-transfected cells were processed in parallel as a negative control. Forced Expression of Exogenous QKI Isoforms Enhances OPC Differentiation, Which Is Abolished by the E48G Mutation That Affects the RNA Binding Activity of QKI—CG4 is an OPC cell line that can be induced for differentiation, recapitulating the morphological changes and maturation marker expression profiles observed in primary cultured OPCs as well as in the developing brain (23Zhao L. Ku L. Chen Y. Xia M. LoPresti P. Feng Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4179-4186Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar-25Louis J.C. Magal E. Muir D. Manthorpe M. Varon S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). One advantage of using CG4 cells over primary cultured OPCs is the consistent high efficiency of transfection, allowing efficient manipulation of QKI expression. We first examined the functional influence of QKI isoforms on the differentiation of CG4 cells by transfecting plasmids that encode FLAG-QKI-5, FLAG-QKI-6, and FLAG-QKI-7 individually into proliferating CG4 cells. Immunofluorescent staining indicated predominant nuclear localization of FLAG-QKI-5, whereas the majority of FLAG-QKI-6 and FLAG-QKI-7 were detected in the cytoplasm, reminiscent of the subcellular localization of QKI isoforms in the developing brain (14Hardy R.J. Loushin C.L. Friedrich Jr., V.L. Chen, Q. Ebersole, T.A. Lazzarini, R.A. Artzt, K. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7941-7949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon removal of mitogens, the bipolarshaped proliferating CG4 cells started to differentiate, characterized by the increased number of primary processes and the development of sophisticated secondary and tertiary branches (Fig. 1A). Enhanced morphological differentiation was observed in cells expressing exogenous QKI isoforms, which were marked by the expression of the GFP from the co-transfected plasmid, as compared with that in control cells that were transfected by the GFP plasmid alone (Fig. 1A). Quantitative analysis indicated that the average numbers of secondary and tertiary processes were markedly increased in cells expressing exogenous QKI, whereas the numbers of primary processes were not significantly altered (Fig. 1B). Although all three QKI isoforms were capable of enhancing process development, QKI-5 and QKI-6 apparently enhanced CG4 cell differentiation more efficiently than QKI-7 (Fig. 1B), despite the fact that all three FLAG-QKI isoforms were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 1B, inset). In addition, we did not detect increased apoptosis in cells expressing QKI-7 (data not shown), excluding the possibility that the weaker activity for QKI-7 to advance differentiation of CG4 cells is due to increased apoptosis. Consistent with a previous report identifying p27Kip1 mRNA as a QKI target (19Larocque D. Galarneau A. Liu H.N. Scott M. Almazan G. Richard S. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), we observed association p27Kip1 mRNA with FLAG-QKI-6 in CG4 cells (Fig. 1C). In addition, exogenous QKI-6 and QKI-7, but not QKI-5, enhanced p27Kip1 protein expression (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that QKI isoforms display differential activities and may act via distinct mechanisms to promote OPC differentiation. Along with the morphological changes, OPC differentiation is also characterized by the sequential appearance of specific surface differentiation markers at various stages (26Bansal R. Warrington A.E. Gard A.L. Ranscht B. Pfeiffer S.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 24: 548-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, the expression of FLAG-QKI-6 significantly increased the percentage of cells that harbor the OPC differentiation marker O1 after 72 h of induced differentiation. To test whether the RNA binding activity of QKI is required for promoting OPC differentiation, we transfected CG4 cells with a mutant FLAG-QKI-6 that carries the E48G mutation in the extended KH domain. This mutation was previously shown to abolish the association of QKI with its RNA ligands (27Galarneau A. Richard S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In contrast to wild type FLAG-QKI-6, the E48G mutant QKI-6 failed to promote either process branching or O1 expression, suggesting that QKI facilitates OPC differentiation by RNA binding-dependent mechanisms. RNA Interference-mediated QKI Knockdown Abrogates OPC Differentiation, and QKI Isoforms Display Differential Abilities in Rescuing the Differentiation Defects—To determine whether QKI is functionally required for OPC differentiation, we introduced a small interfering RNA (siRNA) into proliferating CG4 cells specifically targeting the 5′-coding region that is common for all QKI isoforms (QKIsi, Fig. 3A). A negative control siRNA (Ctrlsi) that harbors no sequence homology to any mammalian mRNA (Ambion) was used in parallel transfection. The plasmid encoding GFP was co-transfected to mark cells that received the siRNA. Immunoblot analysis showed that transfection of double-stranded QKIsi eliminated greater than 80% of endogenous QKI isoforms (Fig. 3B). We also generated lentivirus that express QKIsi or Ctrlsi, respectively, and observed similar efficiency for knocking down the endogenous QKI. Process extension and branching in primary cultured rat OPCs was severely abrogated when cells were treated with the QKIsi virus, whereas cells treated with the Ctrlsi virus developed fully extended processes with vigorous branching (Fig. 3C, panels a and b). Similarly, transfection of synthetic QKIsi into CG4 cells significantly attenuated process branching during differentiation as compared with Ctrlsi-treated cells, evident by the markedly reduced secondary processes (Fig. 3C, panels c and d). Quantitative analysis confirmed the significant decrease in the average number of secondary processes in QKIsi-treated CG4 cells (Fig. 3D), suggesting that elimination of QKI arrested OPC differentiation at early stages of morphogenesis. We also examined the effect of QKIsi on expression of the OPC differentiation marker O1 in CG4 cells (Fig. 4). After 72 h of differentiation, 40% of Ctrlsi-treated cells were O1-positive (Fig. 4A, red fluorescence), but very few (5%) of the QKIsi-treated CG4 cells expressed O1. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that QKI is required for the normal differentiation of OPC.FIGURE 4.QKI knockdown results in differentiation arrest of CG4 cells indicated by the differentiation marker O1.

More than 200 cells were counted from each transfected culture, and results from three independent experiments (n = 3) were graphically displayed with S.E. indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The specific QKI isoform required for OPC differentiation can be determined based on its ability to rescue the differentiation defect in CG4 cells caused by QKIsi. Since siRNA-mediated mRNA cleavage requires perfect sequence match between the siRNA and the mRNA target, we constructed QKIsi-resistant mutant QKI isoforms in which three silent point mutations were introduced into the QKIsi target site (Fig. 5A). When co-transfected with QKIsi, the expression level of each wild type FLAG-QKI isoform was greatly reduced with similar efficiency, whereas the levels of mutant FLAG-QKI isoforms were largely unaffected as compared with that in Ctrlsi-treated cells (Fig. 5B). In our differentiation paradigm, we found that co-transfection of CG4 cells with the QKIsi-resistant QKI-5m or QKI-6m together with QKIsi significantly increased the number of O1-positive cells as compared with that in cells treated with QKIsi alone (Fig. 5C). Quantitative analysis further revealed that although each QKI isoform is expressed at similar levels, QKI-6 is more efficient than QKI-5 in rescuing CG4 cell differentiation (Fig. 5D). In contrast, QKI-7 failed to rescue differentiation of CG4 cells, regardless of the fact that ectopic overexpression of QKI-7 can promote OPC differentiation (Fig. 1, A and B) (19Larocque D. Galarneau A. Liu H.N. Scott M. Almazan G. Richard S. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), albeit with lower efficiency. The siRNA-mediated QKI Knockdown Abrogates Differentiation of CG4 Cells without Altering Proliferation Capacity or Cell Cycle Progression—Since ectopic expression of QKI can promote cell cycle exit of OPCs (19Larocque D. Galarneau A. Liu H.N. Scott M. Almazan G. Richard S. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), we questioned whether QKIsi-mediated suppression of OPC differentiation (Figs. 3, 4 and 5) is due to the attenuation of cellcycle exit, which would lead to increased number of proliferating OPCs. To address this question, we pulse-labeled QKIsi- and Ctrlsi-treated CG4 cells with BrdUrd and identified cells that had undergone active proliferation based on the incorporation of BrdUrd into the replicating genomic DNA as detected by immunofluorescent staining. As shown in Fig. 6, QKIsi treatment did not alter the numbers of BrdUrd-labeled proliferating cells. Quantitative analysis indicated a similar percentage of BrdUrd-labeled cells in QKIsi- and Ctrlsi-treated cultures, suggesting that endogenous QKI isoforms are not involved in governing the proliferation capacity of OPCs. To further test whether QKI knockdown may affect cell cycle progression, we performed fluorescence-activated cell sort analysis using CG4 cells that are treated with the QKIsi lentivirus or the control lentivirus. In this experiment, greater than 90% of cells were transduced, marked by the expression of GFP from the same virus. The DNA content in cells was labeled by propidium iodide, which was used to determine the distribution of cells at various steps of cell cycle. As shown in Fig. 7A, nearly identical fluorescence-activated cell sort profiles were observed in QKIsi-treated cells and the control cells. Quantitative analysis detected no significant difference between QKIsi-treated cells and control cells on the percentage distribution at the G1/G0 phase (∼70%), the S phase (∼15%), and the G2/M phase (15%) (Fig. 7B). Although overexpression of exogenous QKI-6 and QKI-7 enhanced p27Kip1 (Fig. 1D), knocking down QKI in CG4 cells does not affect p27kip1 protein expression (Fig. 7D), suggesting that endogenous QKI is not necessary for maintaining p27Kip1 expression. These results suggest that QKIsi-mediated differentiation arrest is not due to delayed cell cycle exit. Instead, QKI deficiency must directly affect differentiation of CG4 cells via cell cycle-independent mechanisms. The above studies demonstrated that the selective RNA-binding protein QKI is necessary and sufficient for advancing OPC differentiation. In addition, specific QKI isoforms have differential abilities in promoting OPC differentiation, which requires the RNA binding activity of QKI. Furthermore, we show that endogenous QKI is not necessary for cell cycle control of the CG4 OPC cell line, suggesting that at least part of the function of QKI is achieved by direct influence on OPC differentiation, after proliferating OPCs exit the cell cycle. The role of QKI in central nervous system myelination is well documented (10Hardy R.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 51: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). QKI selectively interacts with a subgroup of mRNAs that encode essential myelin structural proteins to control their homeostasis and subcellular localization (11Larocque D. Pilotte J. Chen T.

The best characterized QKI targets for myelination include the myelin basic protein (MBP) mRNA (11Larocque D. Pilotte J. Chen T. Cloutier F. Massie B. Pedraza L. Couture R. Lasko P. Almazan G.

A. 2002; 99: 4233-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). QKI deficiency in OLs causes destabilization and mislocalization of the MBP mRNA (12Li Z. Zhang Y. Li D. Feng Y. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4944-4953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and dysregulated splicing of the myelin-associated glycoprotein mRNA (28Wu J.I. Reed R.B. Grabowski P.J. Artzt K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4233-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), which are potential mechanisms for the failure of myelination in the quakingviable (qkv) mutant mice. The functional importance of QKI in myelination is further reinforced by the fact that N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced single base pair mutations in the qkI gene also cause hypomyelination (29Noveroske J.K. Hardy R. Dapper J.D. Vogel H. Justice M.J. Mamm. Genome. 2005; 16: 672-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 30Cox R.D. Hugill A. Shedlovsky A. Noveroske J.K. Best S. Justice M.J. Lehrach H. Dove W.F. Genomics. 1999; 57: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, the detection of QKI in the earliest stage of OL lineage development (20Hardy R.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 54: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 31Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Hardy R.J. Teng K.K. Levine J.M. Koff A. Chao M.V. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 4027-4037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the association of QKI with mRNAs critical for OL fate specification and differentiation (19Larocque D. Galarneau A. Liu H.N. Scott M. Almazan G. Richard S. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 27Galarneau A. Richard S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) suggest that QKI must also play important roles in early OL development prior to myelin formation. Our results that siRNA-mediated QKI knockdown abrogates OPC differentiation (Figs. 3 and 4) provide the first evidence demonstrating the functional requirement of QKI in OL differentiation. The fact that the RNA binding-deficient E48G mutant QKI failed to promote OPC differentiation (Fig. 2) suggests that QKI supports OPC development via regulating its mRNA targets. Since QKI exerts its influence on OPC differentiation before the expression of myelin structural genes such as mbp, in the differentiation paradigm, QKI must regulate its mRNA targets that are critical for OPC differentiation but distinct from those that support myelination. A previous report showed that overexpression of QKI-6 and QKI-7 can enhance OPC differentiation (19Larocque D. Galarneau A. Liu H.N. Scott M. Almazan G. Richard S. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, the function of QKI-5 in OPC differentiation was not addressed. Our results confirmed the ability of exogenous QKI-6 and QKI-7 in promoting OPC differentiation (Fig. 1) and further indicated that overexpression of the nuclear isoform QKI-5 also promotes OPC differentiation (Fig. 1), regardless of the fact that overexpression of QKI-5 causes nuclear retention of the MBP mRNA and presumably may negatively affect myelination (11Larocque D. Pilotte J. Chen T. Cloutier F. Massie B. Pedraza L. Couture R. Lasko P. Almazan G. Richard S. Neuron. 2002; 36: 815-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The fact that QKI-5 promotes CG4 cell differentiation but not p27Kip1 expression (Fig. 1) suggests that the nuclear QKI isoform may advance OPC differentiation via distinct mechanisms as compared with that employed by the cytoplasmic QKI isoforms. In fact, QKI-5 is the most abundant isoform in OPCs during embryonic and neonatal development (14Hardy R.J. Loushin C.L. Friedrich Jr., V.L. Chen, Q. Ebersole, T.A. Lazzarini, R.A. Artzt, K. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7941-7949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is the second most efficient QKI isoform in rescuing the differentiation defect caused by the QKI-siRNA (Fig. 5). One possible explanation is that QKI-5 may function to achieve nuclear retention of mRNAs that encode suppressors for OPC differentiation, which in turn supports OPC differentiation. QKI isoforms harbor differential abilities to support OPC differentiation, as indicated by the quantitative effect of each QKI isoform in promoting OPC differentiation (Fig. 1) and in rescuing the defect of differentiation caused by the QKI-siRNA (Fig. 5). In both experiments, QKI-6 is the most efficient isoform in supporting OPC differentiation. This is consistent with the recent finding that QKI-6 alone can significantly improve the hypomyelination phenotype of the qkv mutant mice (15Zhao L. Tian D. Xia M. Macklin W.B. Feng Y. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11278-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). On the other hand, QKI-6 cannot completely rescue the defect of myelin gene expression at the early stage of myelin development (15Zhao L. Tian D. Xia M. Macklin W.B. Feng Y. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11278-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) or the differentiation arrest by the QKI siRNA (Fig. 5), suggesting the functional importance of other QKI isoforms for the early development of the OL lineage. Among the QKI isoforms, QKI-7 displays weaker activity in supporting OPC differentiation (Figs. 1 and 5). Because QKI-7 is the least abundant isoform in OPCs and is up-regulated at a later stage of myelin development (14Hardy R.J. Loushin C.L. Friedrich Jr., V.L. Chen, Q. Ebersole, T.A. Lazzarini, R.A. Artzt, K. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7941-7949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it may perform a major role to support myelin formation and maintenance. This idea is consistent with the observation that preferential reduction of QKI-7 is associated with white matter disruption in schizophrenia patients (32Haroutunian V. Katsel P. Dracheva S. Davis K.L. Am. J. Psychiatry. 2006; 163: 1834-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 33Aberg K. Saetre P. Jareborg N. Jazin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7482-7487Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). An alternative possibility is that QKI-7 may depend on the other QKI isoforms to promote OPC differentiation and could not function by itself when endogenous QKI isoforms are eliminated by RNA interference. Forced expression of QKI-6 and QKI-7 can enhance cell cycle exit of OPCs (19Larocque D. Galarneau A. Liu H.N. Scott M. Almazan G. Richard S. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). One proposed mechanism is that QKI binds and stabilizes the mRNA encoding the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 (19Larocque D. Galarneau A. Liu H.N. Scott M. Almazan G. Richard S. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), one of the key regulators for cell cycle arrest of OPCs (3Gao F.B. Durand B. Raff M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 152-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 34Durand B. Gao F.B. Raff M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In CG4 cells, exogenous QKI-6 and QKI-7 also enhanced p27Kip1 expression (Fig. 1D). However, although overexpression of p27Kip1 can lead to forced cell cycle arrest of OPCs, it is not sufficient for inducing OPC differentiation (7Tang X.M. Beesley J.S. Grinspan J.B. Seth P. Kamholz J. Cambi F. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 76: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 8Tokumoto Y.M. Apperly J.A. Gao F.B. Raff M.C. Dev. Biol. 2002; 245: 224-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Reciprocally, p27Kip1 deficiency increases cell proliferation capacity but does not affect the timing of oligodendrocyte differentiation (31Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Hardy R.J. Teng K.K. Levine J.M. Koff A. Chao M.V. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 4027-4037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of QKI on promoting OPC differentiation must also involve cell cycle-independent mechanisms and is achieved by regulating other mRNA targets in addition to p27Kip1 mRNA. Consistent with this view, our results indicate that exogenous QKI-5 promotes OPC differentiation without enhancing p27Kip1 expression (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, elimination of QKI in CG4 cells does not alter proliferation capacity or cell cycle progression (Figs. 6 and 7), suggesting that the abrogation of OPC differentiation caused by siRNA-mediated QKI knockdown (Figs. 3, 4 and 5) is not due to blocking cell cycle exit. In fact, knocking down endogenous QKI did not affect p27Kip1 protein expression (Fig, 7D), indicating that QKI is not necessary for governing p27Kip1 expression in CG4 cells. It is important to point out that p27Kip1 expression is under sophisticated regulation by multiple molecular mechanisms at the levels of transcription, translation, and protein stability in addition to the stabilization of p27Kip1 mRNA by QKI (8Tokumoto Y.M. Apperly J.A. Gao F.B. Raff M.C. Dev. Biol. 2002; 245: 224-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 35Hengst L. Reed S.I.

Hengst L. Cell. 2007; 128: 269-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Therefore, compensatory mechanisms may prevent changes of p27Kip1 expression even when QKI is eliminated, which provides a possible explanation why QKI is unnecessary for p27Kip1 expression and cell cycle exit of CG4 cells (Fig. 7). In this regard, QKI must exert direct influence on OPC differentiation/maturation, most likely via enhanced expression of its mRNA targets that encode proteins critical for OPC differentiation. Thus, siRNA-mediated QKI knockdown causes deficits in expression of these differentiation factors, which in turn attenuates OPC differentiation (Figs. 3, 4 and 5). One of the QKI targets that plays key roles in supporting OPC morphological differentiation is the microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B) (39Song J. O'Connor L.T. Yu W. Baas P.W. Duncan I.D. J. Neurocytol. 1999; 28: 671-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). QKI binds to the 3′-untranslated region of the MAP1B mRNA, and QKI-dependent mRNA stabilization underlies the developmentally programmed up-regulation of MAP1B during OPC differentiation (23Zhao L. Ku L. Chen Y. Xia M. LoPresti P. Feng Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4179-4186Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 24Franklin R.J. Bayley S.A. Milner R. Ffrench-Constant C. Blakemore W.F. Glia. 1995; 13: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Considering the well characterized function of MAP1B in supporting the dynamic assembly of the microtubule cytoskeleton and the critical role of microtubules in OPC differentiation (39Song J. O'Connor L.T. Yu W. Baas P.W. Duncan I.D. J. Neurocytol. 1999; 28: 671-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 40Vouyiouklis D.A. Brophy P.J. J. Neurosci.

Biol. 2000; 151: 1169-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), the effect of QKI in facilitating MAP1B up-regulation is a conceivable mechanism for supporting the process extension of OPCs. Although QKI most likely regulates distinct sets of mRNA targets to support myelination and OPC differentiation, the full range of the mRNA targets of QKI at different stages of OL lineage development still remains undetermined. Identification of the downstream mRNA targets that are under control of QKI-dependent posttranscriptional regulation in future studies will provide critical insights regarding molecular mechanisms that govern OPC development in normal myelinogenesis, as well as the white matter disruption and repair in various myelin disorders, represented by multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia (33Aberg K.

https://openalex.org/W2038339806,"Unlike most acute viral infections controlled with the appearance of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), primary HIV infections are not met with such potent and early antibody responses. This brings into question if or how the presence of potent antibodies can contribute to primary HIV control, but protective efficacies of antiviral antibodies in primary HIV infections have remained elusive; and, it has been speculated that even NAb induction could have only a limited suppressive effect on primary HIV replication once infection is established. Here, in an attempt to answer this question, we examined the effect of passive NAb immunization post-infection on primary viral replication in a macaque AIDS model.The inoculums for passive immunization with simian immunodeficiency virus mac239 (SIVmac239)-specific neutralizing activity were prepared by purifying polyclonal immunoglobulin G from pooled plasma of six SIVmac239-infected rhesus macaques with NAb induction in the chronic phase. Passive immunization of rhesus macaques with the NAbs at day 7 after SIVmac239 challenge resulted in significant reduction of set-point plasma viral loads and preservation of central memory CD4 T lymphocyte counts, despite the limited detection period of the administered NAb responses. Peripheral lymph node dendritic cell (DC)-associated viral RNA loads showed a remarkable peak with the NAb administration, and DCs stimulated in vitro with NAb-preincubated SIV activated virus-specific CD4 T lymphocytes in an Fc-dependent manner, implying antibody-mediated virion uptake by DCs and enhanced T cell priming.Our results present evidence indicating that potent antibody induction post-infection can result in primary immunodeficiency virus control and suggest direct and indirect contribution of its absence to initial control failure in HIV infections. Although difficulty in achieving requisite neutralizing titers for sterile HIV protection by prophylactic vaccination has been suggested, this study points out a possibility of non-sterile HIV control by prophylactic vaccine-induced, sub-sterile titers of NAbs post-infection, providing a rationale of vaccine-based NAb induction for primary HIV control."
https://openalex.org/W2143041187,"Several studies have shown that hepatocytes can be generated from hematopoietic stem cells, but this event is believed to be rare and to require hepatic damage. To investigate this phenomenon in human cells, we used a NOD/SCID/gamma(c)null (NOG) mouse model that can achieve a tremendously high level of chimerism when transplanted with human hematopoietic cells. Even without hepatotoxic treatment other than irradiation, human albumin and alpha-1-antitrypsin-positive cells were invariably detected in the livers of NOG mice after i.v. transplantation of human cord blood CD34+ cells. Human albumin was detected in the murine sera, indicating functional maturation of the human hepatocytes. Flow cytometric analysis of recipient liver cells in single-cell suspension demonstrated that human albumin-positive cells were also positive for both murine and human MHC and were negative for human CD45. PCR analysis of recipient livers revealed the expression of a wide variety of human hepatocyte- or cholangiocyte-specific mRNAs. These results show that human CD34+ cells fuse with hepatocytes of NOG mice without liver injury, lose their hematopoietic phenotype, and begin hepatocyte-specific gene transcription. These phenomena were not observed when CD34- cells were transplanted. Thus, our model revealed a previously unidentified pathway of human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell differentiation."

Conversion of myocardial scar fibroblasts (MSFs) into (functional) cardiomyocytes may be an effective alternative treatment to limit loss of cardiac performance after myocardial injury. In this study, we investigated whether the phenotype of MSFs can be modified by gene transfer into cells with properties of cardiomyocytes. To this end, fibroblasts from postmyocardial infarction scars of human left ventricles were isolated and characterized by cell biological, immunological, and molecular biological assays. Cultured human MSFs express GATA4 and connexin 43 and display adipogenic differentiation potential. Infection of human MSFs with a lentivirus vector encoding the potent cardiogenic transcription factor myocardin renders them positive for a wide variety of cardiomyocyte-specific proteins, including sarcomeric components, transcription factors, and ion channels, and induces the expression of several smooth muscle marker genes. Forced myocardin expression also endowed human MSFs with the ability to transmit an action potential and to repair an artificially created conduction block in cardiomyocyte cultures. These finding indicate that in vivo myocardin gene transfer may potentially limit cardiomyocyte loss, myocardial fibrosis, and disturbances in electrical conduction caused by myocardial infarction."
https://openalex.org/W2007594741,"A femtosecond laser beam gene transduction (SG-LBGT) system is described as a novel and efficient method of intradermal (i.d.) nonviral gene delivery in mice by permeabilizing cells utilizing femtosecond laser pulses. Using this approach, significant gene expression and efficient dermal transduction lasting for >7 months were obtained. The ability of this new DNA gene transfer method to enhance genetic vaccination was tested in BALB/C mice. A single i.d. injection of a plasmid (10 microg) containing the hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg), followed by pulses of laser, induced high titers of HBsAg-specific antibodies lasting for >210 days and increased levels of IgG1, IgG2a, IFNgamma, and IL-4, indicating the activation of both Th1 and Th2 cells. Moreover, mice vaccinated using the SG-LBGT followed by challenge with pHBV showed increased protection against viral challenge, as detected by decreased levels of HBV DNA, suggesting an efficient Th1 effect against HBV-infected replicating cells. Tumor growth retardation was induced in vaccinated mice challenged with an HBsAg-expressing syngeneic tumor. In most of the parameters tested, administration of plasmid followed by laser application was significantly more effective and prolonged than that of plasmid alone. Tissue damage was not detected and integration of the plasmid into the host genomic DNA probably did not occur. We suggest that the LBGT method is an efficient and safe technology for in vivo gene expression and vaccination and emphasizes its potential therapeutic applications for i.d. nonviral gene delivery."
https://openalex.org/W2072422682,"The two cardiac myosin heavy chain isoforms, alpha and beta, exhibit distinct functional characteristics and therefore may be distributed regionally within the heart to match the functional demands of a specific region. In adult mouse hearts, which predominantly express alpha-myosin heavy chain, we observed high concentrations of beta-myosin in distinct areas such as at the tip of papillary muscles and at the base close to the valvular annulus. In light of these distinct distribution patterns of the myosin isoforms, we subsequently explored the isoform-specific structure-function relationships of the myosins. The alpha- and beta-isoforms are 93% identical in amino acid sequence, but it remains unclear which of the nonidentical residues determines isoform functionality. We hypothesized that residues situated within or close to the actin-binding interface of the myosin head influence actin binding and thereby modulate actin-activated ATPase activity. A chimeric myosin was created containing beta-sequence from amino acid 417 to 682 within the alpha-backbone. In mice, approximately 70% of the endogenous cardiac protein was replaced with the chimeric myosin. Myofibrils containing chimeric myosin exhibited ATPase activities that were depressed to the levels observed in hearts expressing approximately 70% beta-myosin. In vitro motility assays showed that the actin filament sliding velocity generated by chimeric myosin was similar to that of alpha-myosin, almost twice the velocities observed with beta-myosin. These data indicate that this large domain sequence switch conferred beta-like actin-activated ATPase activities to the chimeric myosin, suggesting that this region is responsible for the distinct hydrolytic properties of these myosin isoforms."

First of all, we determined the temporal expression profile of HOP/NECC1 in wild-type mouse placenta; E8.5–E9.5 wild-type placentas expressed HOP/NECC1 in the TG cell and SpT layers. HOP/NECC1 (-/-) placentas exhibited marked propagation of the TG cell layers and, in turn, reduction of SpT formation. Forced expression of HOP/NECC1 in trophoblast stem cells (TS cells) and Rcho-1 cells inhibited the generation of TG cells and down-regulated the transcription of Pl1, features, which were also observed in the case of dominant-negative SRF. Negative regulation of the activity of SRF as a transcription factor by the binding of HOP/NECC1 protein to SRF contributed at least in part to the generation of these placental defects. Induction of HOP/NECC1 expression in response to differentiation may negatively regulate the generation of TG cell lineage and result in non-lethal defects shown by the HOP/NECC1 (-/-) placentas.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMice—HOP/NECC1 (-/-) embryos were generated in the laboratory of Eric N. Olson (6Shin C.H. Liu Z.P. Passier R. Zhang C.L. Wang D.Z. Harris T.M. Yamagishi H. Richardson J.A. Childs G. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 110: 725-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Genotyping was performed by PCR. Mutant phenotypes were analyzed in a mixed 129/Sv × C57Bl/6 background and isogenic 129/Sv × 129/Sv background.Cell Culture, Transfection, Infection, and Analysis of Trophoblast Giant Cell Differentiation—The Rcho-1 cell line, a rat choriocarcinoma cell line, was kindly provided by Toshiya Yamamoto, Osaka University, Japan and cultured as described previously (9Faria T.N. Soares M.J. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2895-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The TS cell line (kindly provided by Satoshi Tanaka, Tokyo University, Japan), derived from a 6.5-dpc conceptus of ICR mice, was cultured according to methods reported previously (10Tanaka S. Kunath T. Hadjantonakis A.K. Nagy A. Rossant J. Science. 1998; 282: 2072-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). Human wild-type (wt) SRF and dominant-negative SRF (pm1) inserted into pCGN-HA were digested with Xba1-BamH1 and newly cloned into the pCDNA3 expression vector, which contains the CMV promoter. Rcho-1 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Two micrograms of empty, wt-SRF or pm1 expression vector were used for transfection and several clones which stably expressed the genes were obtained from the transfected cells. An adenovirus expression vector of HOP/NECC1 was constructed by ligating a full-length human HOP/NECC1 cDNA into the pAxCAwt cosmid vector. 293a transfectants were derived and a high-titer adenovirus solution was obtained (Takara, Japan). Rcho-1 cells and TS cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 10 or 20 1 day before the induction to differentiation at day 0. For trypsin resistance assays, after 2 days induction of Rcho-1 cells in 1% house serum (HS), stem cells were removed by trypsinization (0.25% trypsin and 1 mm EDTA, incubation for 5 min and washing with phosphate-buffered saline twice), and then the adherent cells in 20 random high magnification fields for each clone were counted. Values were reported as the mean ± S.D., and the significance of differences between values were determined by Student’s t test. Nuclear DNA content was estimated by the area of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylinodole (DAPI) staining using NIH Image software as described previously (2MacAuley A. Cross J.C. Werb Z. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 795-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) with 200 cells from random fields.Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Promoter-reporter constructs were transiently transfected into Rcho-1 cells using Lipofectamine reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A pSRF construct containing five tandem SRF binding elements from c-fos promoter linked to bacterial luciferase (pSRF-Luc) was purchased from Stratagene. A Pl1 promoter/luciferase construct was generated from the previously characterized mouse Pl1 promoter (11Shida M.M. Ng Y.K. Soares M.J. Linzer D.I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 181-188PubMed Google Scholar) using PCR. Briefly, genomic DNA from mouse trophoblast stem cells served as a template for PCR using an upstream primer with a Kpn1 restriction site (sense, -328 to -309) and a downstream primer with an Xho1 restriction site (antisense, +9 to +29). The amplified product was digested with Kpn1 and Xho1 and ligated into the pTA-Luc reporter plasmid (pmPl1-Luc). The accuracy of the PCR-generated Pl1 promoter-luciferase reporter construct was verified by DNA sequencing. Rcho-1 cells and TS cells (1 × 106) were transfected with 3 μg of the pSRF-Luc construct, pLuc-MCS basic vector (negative control) or pmPl1-Luc. A CMV promoter-β-galactosidase construct (pCDNA3.1-His-LacZ, 0.5 μg) was cotransfected and used to evaluate transfection efficiency. 48 or 72 h after transfection, cells were collected, and lysates were prepared. Luciferase assays were performed using a luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI), and β-galactosidase activity was measured using a β-galactosidase assay kit (Invitrogen).In Situ Hybridization, Immunohistochemistry, and Immunofluorescence—Freshly isolated placentas and embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned (5 μm). RNA in situ hybridization was performed as described (12Wilkinson D.G. Nieto M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar) using digoxigenin-UTP-labeled antisense cRNA probes for HOP/NECC1, Pl1 (13Colosi P. Talamantes F.

Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 1761-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry for SRF expression was performed using sections of placentas from wild-type mice. Standard immunohistochemical techniques were used, employing a polyclonal rabbit IgG antibody to SRF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and a Dako LSAB kit (Dako, Denmark). Hematoxylin was used for counterstaining. For immunofluorescence, cells on coverslips were fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min and permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline/0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline for 3 min at room temperature, actin stress fiber staining was performed using rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (1:40, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Slides were then washed, counterstained with DAPI, and mounted. For TS cells differentiation experiments, pCGN-HA-wt-SRF or pCGN-HA-pm1 transfected TS cells were cultured on stem cell condition for up to 48–72 h. The cells were fixed, permeabilized as described above, and blocked with rabbit serum (Nichirei Bioscience). The cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-HA monoclonal antibody (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h, counterstained with DAPI and mounted. Transfected cells were detected by their expression of HA tag. Two hundred cells were assessed for each transfection group, and experiments were repeated three times. The staining patterns of the cells were examined using a Carl Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope.Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from Rcho-1, and TS cells using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Northern blotting was performed as described previously (10Tanaka S. Kunath T. Hadjantonakis A.K. Nagy A. Rossant J. Science. 1998; 282: 2072-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar).Western Blot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—To examine the expression of various proteins, subconfluent cells were lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 2% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% SDS) containing freshly added protease inhibitors (200 μm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm pepstatin A). After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min to remove debris, the lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Anti-HOP/NECC1 antibody was raised in a rabbit using the peptide RLAKWRRSEGLPSEC corresponding to the C-terminal portion of HOP/NECC1 and the specificity of the antibody was verified using Hela cells, which do not express HOP/NECC1, and HOP/NECC1-expressing adenovirus-infected Hela cells. Equal amounts of protein from each lysate were immunoprecipitated with anti-HOP/NECC1 antibody bound to protein A/G-agarose (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and separated by SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins on the gel were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and the membranes were incubated with anti-HOP/NECC1 antibody after blocking. The membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline-Tween-20 (TBS-T), and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody. The signal was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The same amount of protein was loaded and blotted using anti-GAPDH antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for the loading control. Immunoprecipitations were carried out by incubating 500 μg of protein/500 μl of lysate with 10 μl of primary antibody and 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-SRF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody and anti-HOP/NECC1 antibody.RESULTSDuring mouse embryogenesis, HOP/NECC1 transcripts are first detected at E7.75 in trophoblast cells within extraembryonic membranes (6Shin C.H. Liu Z.P. Passier R. Zhang C.L. Wang D.Z. Harris T.M. Yamagishi H. Richardson J.A. Childs G. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 110: 725-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To examine the temporal expression profile of HOP/NECC1 during wild-type mouse placental development, we performed in situ hybridization using E8.5–11.5 placentas. The results demonstrated that the highest levels of HOP/NECC1 transcript were present in E8.5 and E9.5 placentas, and then the level suddenly declined, and become almost undetectable in E10.5 and E11.5 placentas (Fig. 1, A–E). Abundant expression of HOP/NECC1 was detected in primary and secondary giant cells and a lower level of HOP/NECC1 expression was also observed in SpT layers (Fig. 1, B and C). The comparative presentation in Fig. 1C clearly shows that HOP/NECC1 was expressed in both Pl1-positive (TG cells) and Tpbp-positive (SpT) areas (Fig. 1C). The temporally and spatially restricted expression profiles of HOP/NECC1 during mouse placental development suggested its involvement in trophoblast cell differentiation.HOP/NECC1 homozygous knock out (-/-) mice have been generated in 129/SV × C57 BL/6 mixed background and 129/SV × 129/SV isogenic background (6Shin C.H. Liu Z.P. Passier R. Zhang C.L. Wang D.Z. Harris T.M. Yamagishi H. Richardson J.A. Childs G. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 110: 725-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). First of all, we examined the expression of Pl1, which is an endocrine marker of TG cells in 10 (+/+), 15 (+/-) and 18 (-/-) placentas to explore the contribution of HOP/NECC1 to placental formation. No marked differences were found between (+/+) and (+/-) mice at any gestational age. TG cells identified histologically expressed Pl1 in E8.5 (+/+), (+/-) and (-/-) placentas (Fig. 2A). In contrast, there was a significant increase of the Pl1-expressing cell population in E9.5 (-/-) placentas, compared with E9.5 (+/+) or (+/-) placentas (Fig. 2B). Pl1-positive cells were markedly increased in E10.5 and E11.5 (-/-) placentas (Fig. 2, C and D).FIGURE 2Expression of trophoblast-specific markers in the mutant placentas. In situ hybridization of trophoblast-specific markers in E8.5–E11.5 wild-type (+/+) or hetero-mutant (+/-) and HOP/NECC1-deficient (-/-) placental serial sections. Pl1 and Tpbp expression in E8.5 (A, scale bar: 200 μm), E9.5 (B, scale bar: 300 μm), E10.5 (C, scale bar: 500 μm), and E11.5 placentas (D, scale bar: 500 μm). The right panels in D are amplified pictures of the boxed areas in the middle panels. White arrows indicate the Tpbp-positive spongiotrophoblast layer.

The middle panels are amplified pictures of the boxed area in the left panels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tpbp and Cea4 are specifically expressed in SpT (14Lescisin K.R. Varmuza S. Rossant J. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1639-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 15Rudert F. Saunders A.M. Rebstock S. Thompson J.A. Zimmermann W. Mamm. Genome. 1992; 3: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 2A, no differences in the Tpbp-positive cell distribution were detectable in E8.5 (-/-) placentas, compared with (+/+) or (+/-) placentas. However, there was a significant reduction in the number of Tpbp-positive cells in E9.5 and E10.5 (-/-) placentas, suggesting the impairment of SpT development (Fig. 2, B and C). The expression profile of Cea4 was similar to that of Tpbp (data not shown). Interestingly, Tpbp-positive cells reappeared in SpT layers and Pl1-positive cells also expressed Tpbp in E11.5 (-/-) placentas, which is in strong contrast with the finding that the distributions of Pl1-positive and Tpbp-positive cells were markedly different in (+/+) placentas (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, the Pl1-positive cells in E11.5 (-/-) placentas expressed not only TG cell markers (Pl2 and Plf) but also another SpT markers, Cea4, and precursor marker, Mash2 (Fig. 2E). This result indicated that HOP/NECC1 knock-out in mice resulted in an abnormal increase of giant cells and a defect in SpT development. The abnormally increased of giant cells shared in part the biochemical characteristics with SpT in E11.5 (-/-) placentas.Cdx2 and Mash2 is exclusively expressed in TS cells and precursor cells respectively located in the SpT and labyrinthine layers (16Beck F. Erler T. Russell A. James R. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 204: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 17Guillemot F. Caspary T. Tilghman S.M. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Anderson D.J. Joyner A.L. Rossant J. Nagy A. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 2F, a marked reduction of the cell population expressing Cdx2 and Mash2 was detected in E10.5 (-/-) placentas compared with that in (+/+) placentas. The scarcity of Cdx2- and Mash2-positive cells was found in two types of knock-out mice derived from different backgrounds. Additionally, hypoplastic labyrinthine layers were also detected in E9.5, E10.5, and E11.5 (-/-) placentas, though the reason remains unknown.The Rcho-1 cell line was derived from a rat choriocarcinoma and maintains in part the features of TS cells, since the cells have the ability to differentiate into giant cells in vitro (9Faria T.N. Soares M.J. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2895-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Therefore, we further addressed how HOP/NECC1 is involved in Rcho-1 cell differentiation in response to low horse serum. Northern blotting and RT-PCR demonstrated that the expression level of HOP/NECC1 remained low and no changes were observed following stimulation to differentiation by 1% horse serum (HS) (data not shown). To determine the function of HOP/NECC1 in the regulation of trophoblast cell differentiation, we infected Rcho-1 cells with HOP/NECC1-expressing adenovirus (Ad-HOP/NECC1). The infected cells were stimulated with 1% HS and observed for 4 days. The faintly detectable level of HOP/NECC1 expression at 12 h sharply increased up to a maximum at 72 h, followed by a gradual decrease. HOP/NECC1 protein was still detectable even at 168 h by Western blotting (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3HOP/NECC1 is a negative regulator of giant cell differentiation in Rcho-1 cells. A, Western blotting indicating the time course of the level of HOP/NECC1 expression in Rcho-1 cells after infection of adenovirus vector. Protein lysate from human placental villi was used as a control (Human villi). B, control virus (left panel) and HOP/NECC1 virus-infected Rcho-1 cells (right panel) were cultured in medium with 1% house serum (HS) and were photographed at day 4. The lower panels show nuclear (blue) and actin stress fiber reorganization (red). Representative photographs are shown. C, analysis of trypsin resistance of the infected cells.

Reorganization of actin filaments and endoreduplication of DNA that results in the appearance of cells with 4N-128N nuclei have also been shown in differentiated Rcho-1 cells (20Takahashi Y. Carpino N. Cross J.C. Torres M. Parganas E. Ihle J.N. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 372-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Infection with Ad-HOP/NECC1 resulted in marked suppression of Rcho-1 cell differentiation, as evidenced by the maintenance of sensitivity to trypsin release and the decrease of the appearance of cells with increased ploidy (more than 16N) and with actin filament reorganization (Fig. 3, B–D). These effects were dependent on the multiplicity of infection (moi) of adenovirus. In contrast to these results, control virus (Ad-control) had a minimal effect on the Rcho-1 differentiation, regardless of its moi (Fig. 3, C and D). This result was compatible with the block of Rcho-1 cell differentiation into giant cells in the presence of the continuous expression of HOP/NECC1, being supported by the evidence that Pl1 expression was sharply suppressed by the Ad-HOP/NECC1 infection (Fig. 3E). In contrast, Ad-control infected Rcho-1 cells differentiated in vitro and expressed abundant levels of Pl1. The expression of Tpbp in Rcho-1 cells stimulated by low horse serum did not show any significant alterations in the presence of HOP/NECC1 expression, compared with Ad-control infection (data not shown). These findings suggest that transient induction followed by down-regulation of HOP/NECC1 is required for the proper differentiation from TS cells to TG cells.HOP/NECC1 regulates cardiomyocyte development by inhibiting SRF transcriptional activity, which controls the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and cardiomyogenesis (5Chen F.

First of all, we examined the expression profile of SRF during Rcho-1 cell differentiation in response to serum starvation. SRF protein was detected as two bands with different mobilities, and its expression level remained similar regardless of differentiation stimulation (Fig. 4A). As phosphorylation of SRF alters its migration in SDS-PAGE (22Fluck M. Booth F.W. Waxham M.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we treated Rcho-1 cell extracts with lambda-protein phosphatase but did not detect any alterations in band intensity, suggesting that these two bands were alternative splicing products of SRF (data not shown and Ref. 23Belaguli N.S.

Short-chain α-neurotoxins preferentially inhibit muscle-type nAChRs, whereas long-chain α-neurotoxins block both muscle-type and α7 homooligomeric neuronal nAChRs. An additional disulfide in the central loop of α- and κ-neurotoxins is essential for their action on the α7 and α3β2 nAChRs, respectively.

To address this problem, two chimeric toxins were produced by bacterial expression, a short-chain neurotoxin II Naja oxiana with the grafted disulfide-containing loop from long-chain neurotoxin I from N. oxiana, while a second chimera contained an additional A29K mutation, the most pronounced difference in the central loop tip between long-chain α-neurotoxins and κ-neurotoxins. The correct folding and structural stability for both chimeras were shown by 1H and 1H-15N NMR spectroscopy. Electrophysiology experiments on the nAChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes revealed that the first chimera and neurotoxin I blockα7 nAChRs with similar potency (IC50 6.1 and 34 nm, respectively). Therefore, the disulfide-confined loop endows neurotoxin II with full activity of long-chain α-neurotoxin and the C-terminal tail in neurotoxin I is not essential for binding. The A29K mutation of the chimera considerably diminished the affinity for α7 nAChR (IC50 126 nm) but did not convey activity at α3β2 nAChRs.

Neuronal receptors consist of two types of subunits, α (α2–α10) and β (β2–β4), and can have homooligomeric (for example, α7-type nAChR) or heterooligomeric (for example, α3β2-type receptor) composition. Neuronal nAChRs are widely expressed both pre- and postsynaptically, and presynaptic receptors modulate synaptic activity and the release of different neurotransmitters. Neuronal nAChRs are found also in non-neuronal tissues, such as keratinocytes and pulmonary and other tissues (5Li X.W. Wang H.

Dysfunctions of these receptors have been proposed to contribute to a number of disorders of the central and peripheral nervous systems such as schizophrenia, epilepsy, depression, nicotine and alcohol dependence, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and autism (9Bertrand D.

Distinct nAChR subtypes are involved in different disorders, and proper treatment of such diseases requires new therapeutic agents that are specific for a defined receptor subtype. α-Neurotoxins from snake venoms are natural potent inhibitors of nAChRs. These toxins are small proteins with a “three-fingered” structure formed by three β-structural loops stabilized by disulfide bonds (18Menez A. Toxicon. 1998; 36: 1557-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 19Tsetlin V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 20Tsetlin V.I. Hucho F. FEBS Lett. 2004; 557: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). α-Neurotoxins can be subdivided into several classes according to their biological and structural properties. Short-chain α-neurotoxins (4 disulfide bonds, 60–62 amino acid residues) selectively inhibit only muscle-type nAChRs, whereas long-chain α-neurotoxins (5 disulfide bonds, 66–75 amino acid residues) with an additional disulfide bond in the tip of the central loop can inhibit both muscle and neuronal α7 nAChRs (19Tsetlin V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 20Tsetlin V.I. Hucho F. FEBS Lett. 2004; 557: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). There are κ-neurotoxins (5 disulfide bonds, 66 amino acid residues) that also contain an additional disulfide bond in the central loop and block neuronal α3β2 nAChR (21Grant G.A. Frazier M.W. Chiappinelli V.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3794-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis (22Antil-Delbeke S. Gaillard C. Tamiya T. Corringer P.J. Changeux J.P.

Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) indicate that the central loop fragment with fifth disulfide bond is essential for interaction of α- and κ-neurotoxins with neuronal α7 and α3β2 receptors, respectively. Recently the structural basis of interaction between the central loop of a toxin and nAChR was revealed by x-ray investigation of a crystallized complex of long-chain α-cobratoxin from Naja kaouthia with the acetylcholine-binding protein from Lymnaea stagnalis (AChBP) (28Bourne Y. Talley T.T. Hansen S.B. Taylor P. Marchot P. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1512-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). (AChBP is a natural water-soluble homopentameric protein that is an excellent model of the ligand-binding domain of the nAChR) (29Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der O.J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar, 30Sixma T.K. Smit A.B. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2003; 32: 311-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Direct intermolecular contacts between the fifth disulfide of the neurotoxin, Cys-27-Cys-31 (numbers are given for neurotoxin I), and the residues on the surface of the adjacent subunit of the AChBP were observed in this complex. The structure of α-cobratoxin-AChBP complex explains common principles of interaction between α-neurotoxins and nAChRs. However, the exact structural features that determine the selectivity between different nAChR subtypes remain unclear. Design of chimeric molecules bearing features of toxins from different groups can shed light on this problem. In the present communication we describe heterologous expression in Escherichia coli of chimeric short/long-chain α-neurotoxins. We demonstrate using electrophysiology on human α7 nAChR expressed in Xenopus oocytes that grafting the disulfide-confined tip of the neurotoxin I N. oxiana on a short-chain neurotoxin II from the same venom makes the latter as active as neurotoxin I itself. An additional mutation, A29K, has been done in this chimera to test the hypothesis of Bourne et al. (28Bourne Y. Talley T.T. Hansen S.B. Taylor P. Marchot P. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1512-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) that the Lys-29 is the major factor underlying the difference in specificity between the long-chain α-neurotoxins and κ-neurotoxins toward α7 and α3β2 nAChRs, respectively. This mutation considerably decreased the activity against α7 nAChRs but showed no inhibition of human α3β2 nAChRs. Comparison of NTII Spatial Structure with Structures of Long-chain α-Neurotoxins—The atomic coordinates for NTII and five long-chain neurotoxins (neurotoxin I, α-bungarotoxin, α-cobratoxin, toxin B, κ-bungarotoxin) were taken from the Protein Data Bank (PDB codes 1NOR, 1NTN, 2ABX, 1CTX, 1TXA, 1KBA, respectively). Superimposition of structures and root mean square deviation calculation was done in MolMol program (31Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6454) Google Scholar). Expression of NTII Gene in E. coli—A synthetic NTII gene (32Liukmanova E.N. Shul'ga A.A. Aren'eva D.A. Pluzhnikov K.A. Dolgikh D.A. Arsen'ev A.S. Kirpichnikov M.P. Bioorg. Khim. 2004; 30: 30-40PubMed Google Scholar) was joined to a sequence encoding the signal peptide of E. coli heat-stable enterotoxin II (STII) (NCBI accession number M35729). This fusion gene was placed under the control of the T7 promoter in an expression vector pET-22b (Novagen) between the NdeI and HindIII sites. The resultant plasmid was named pET22b/STII/NTII. Engineering of the Mutant Neurotoxins—The fragment of the NTI central loop was introduced into the NTII molecule using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) on the basis of pET22b/STII/NTII. Primer 5′-CTACAAAAAGTGGTGGTGCGACGCGTGGTGCGGTTCCCGTGGTACCATCATC-3′, coding the disulfide-containing fragment of central loop of NTI, was used as direct primer. Primer 5′-GATGATGGTACCACGGGAACCGCACCACTTGTCGCACCACCACTTTTTGTAG-3, partly complementary to the direct primer sequence, coding the disulfide-containing fragment of the central loop of NTI with substitution Ala/Lys, was used as reverse primer. Amplification was performed on the Mastercycler® Personal PCR amplifier (Eppendorf, Germany). Bacterial Expression, Isolation, and Purification of Recombinant Neurotoxins—BL21(DE3) E. coli cells were transformed with the recombinant vectors and plated onto Petri dishes with Luria Bertani agar containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Several colonies were then inoculated with minimal mineral M9 medium (0.4% glycerol, 3 g/liter KH2PO4, 6 g/liter Na2HPO4, 0.5 g/liter NaCl, 0.24 g/liter MgSO4, 0.01 g/liter CaCl2, 2 g/liter NH4Cl, 1% thiamine chloride, 0.2% yeast extract) containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). The cells were cultivated at 37 °C and moderate mixing (250 rpm) until optical density of the bacterial culture had reached 0.6 optical units at 600 nm wavelength. After that, gene expression was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.05 mm. After 15 h of cultivation the cell culture was centrifuged (14,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). Growth medium was acidified to pH 4.5, heated at 70 °C during 30 min, and centrifuged once more (14000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was diluted 2-fold with Milli-Q deionized water (Millipore). The first step of purification was made using cation exchange SP-Sepharose Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare), equilibrated in 10 mm CH3COONa, pH 5.0. Protein fractions were eluted in the linear gradient of NaCl (from 0 mm to 1 m), and fractions containing modified neurotoxins were collected at 0.25 mm NaCl. The mutant toxins were additionally purified on a MonoS HR5/5 column (GE Healthcare), equilibrated with 10 mm CH3COONa, pH 5.0, and eluted from the column with 0.4 m NaCl. The buffer of protein samples was changed to 0.2 m CH3COOH using Sephadex™ G-25 NAP™-5 and NAP™-10 columns (GE Healthcare). Finally, protein solutions were lyophilized overnight on an Alpha I-5 freeze dryer (Martin Christ Gefriertrocknungsanlagen GmbH). Protocol for production and purification of 15N-labeled NTII and NTII/I chimera was the same as in the case of non-labeled toxins, with the exception of using 15NHCl as a sole source of nitrogen (15N > 99%; Martek Biosciences). Analysis of Recombinant Toxins—All the steps of protein production, isolation, and purification were controlled by 12% Tris/Tricine-SDS-PAGE (33Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the obtained proteins was determined on the Applied Biosystems 470A gas-phase sequenator. Recombinant neurotoxins were analyzed by mass spectrometry using a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization Daltonics Ultraflex II TOF/TOF (time-of-flight) instrument (Bruker) equipped with nitrogen laser and time-of-flight mass analyzer. All NMR experiments were performed on a 500-MHz DRX-500 spectrometer (Bruker). One-dimensional 1H and two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra were measured for 1 mm protein solutions in H2O (10% D2O). Electrophysiology—Expression and electrophysiological recording from nAChRs was carried out as described previously (34Hogg R.C. Hopping G. Alewood P.F. Adams D.J. Bertrand D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26908-26914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were injected intranuclearly with 2 ng of cDNA that coded for either the human α7or α3β2 receptors (cDNAs were a gift from J. P. Changeux). All recordings were performed in OR2 medium that contained 82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 5 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. Acetylcholine and toxins were dissolved in the OR2 medium just prior to use. Recordings were carried out at −100 mV. Oocyte loading, penetration, and voltage clamping were carried out by an automated system based around a liquid-handling robot controlled by in-house software. Solution exchanges were automated and carried out by the same liquid handler. Control responses were recorded before toxin exposure and toxin incubation was carried out in the recording chamber during 3 min using a static bath technique. Peak current amplitude was plotted as a function of the toxin concentration on a semilog scale. Dose-response curves for toxin inhibition were fit with the equation y = 1/1 ([toxin]/(IC50)n), where y is the normalized response, [toxin] is the toxin concentration, and n is the Hill coefficient. ACh concentration was close to the EC50 for receptor activation, and toxin incubation time was determined by testing receptor responses after increasing toxin incubation times. Equilibrium was assumed to be reached when no further inhibition of the response was seen. Modeling of Chimeras and Their nAChR Complexes—The models of the chimeric toxins were built using homology modeling technique under MODELLER with further molecular dynamics refinement in CHARMM'27 and stochastic dynamics under GROMACS. Further relaxation was done with Minimization routine in CHARMM'27 force field under TINKER program. 3-ns trajectories were calculated at the temperature 300 K and dielectric permittivity e = 1. The models of the nAChR subunits and their assemblies were built similarly as described in Ref. 35Mordvintsev D.Y. Polyak Y.L. Levtsova O.V. Tourleigh Y.V. Kasheverov I.E. Shaitan K.V. Utkin Y.N. Tsetlin V.I. Comput. Biol. Chem. 2005; 29: 398-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar for Torpedo californica nAChR subunits; the structure of the α-cobratoxin complex with AChBP (PDB code 1YI5) was additionally used as a template. Visual analysis was carried out with SPDBViewer version 3.7 sp5 program. Docking simulations were performed with both AutoDock 3.05 and HEX 4.5 programs. The solutions of the complexes were relaxed and underwent molecular dynamics simulation with GROMACS for 100–200-ps trajectories. Construction of Short/Long-chain α-Neurotoxin Chimeras—The chimeric toxins were built on the scaffold of the shortchain NTII chosen for several reasons. First, NTII has low activity against neuronal nAChRs (IC50 > 1 μm), thus providing reliable reference for detection of even subtle changes in affinity. Second, high level bacterial expression systems for this toxin had previously been developed (32Liukmanova E.N. Shul'ga A.A. Aren'eva D.A. Pluzhnikov K.A. Dolgikh D.A. Arsen'ev A.S. Kirpichnikov M.P. Bioorg. Khim. 2004; 30: 30-40PubMed Google Scholar, 36Bocharov E.V. Lyukmanova E.N. Ermolyuk Y.S. Schulga A.A. Pluzhnikov K.A. Dolgikh D.A. Kirpichnikov M.P. Arseniev A.S. Appl. Magn. Reson. 2003; 24: 247-254Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and could be adapted for production of chimeras. To find the most appropriate donor for the disulfide-confined fragment of the central loop, we compared, in terms of atomic pair-wise root mean square deviation, the spatial structures of several long-chain neurotoxins (neurotoxin I, α-bungarotoxin, α-cobratoxin, toxin B, κ-bungarotoxin) with the three-dimensional structure of NTII. The molecules were superimposed by fitting atomic coordinates for Cα atoms from four conserved disulfides and from two β-strands that form the central loop (residues 3, 14, 21–26, 37–42, 46, 57, 58, 63, numbers are given for NTI). The minimal value of pair-wise root mean square deviation with NTII for this group of atoms (0.89 Å) was found for NTI from N. oxiana (NTI), and this long-chain α-neurotoxin was chosen as donor, ensuring less structural perturbation during “transplantation.” To this end, Ser-29, Asp-30, and His-31 of NTII were replaced by Cys-27, Asp-28, Ala-29, Trp-30, Cys-31, Gly-32, and Ser-33 of NTI (Fig. 1). Bacterial Expression, Isolation, and Purification of Recombinant Toxins—Recombinant neurotoxins were produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) strain under the transcriptional control of a T7 promoter. After induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, toxins began to accumulate in periplasm and growth medium and were processed accurately during the secretion process. Chimeras were isolated from growth medium in two steps by separation on cation exchange SP-Sepharose Fast Flow resin and MonoS HR5/5 column (GE Healthcare). The toxin purity was checked by reversed phase HPLC (Fig. 2). It is seen that the elution times for chimeric toxins are between those for NTII and NTI. The substitution of alanine residue by lysine in NTII/I[A29K] resulted in decreased hydrophobicity manifested in shorter retention time on reversed phase HPLC. The final yield of the mutant toxins containing five disulfide bonds was ∼1 mg/liter of bacterial culture in the case of NTII/I chimera and 5 mg for NTII/I[A29K], which is several times lower than yield of NTII (∼20 mg/l) in this system. The yields of 15N-labeled NTII and NTII/I chimera were similar to the yields of non-labeled proteins. The lower yields of chimeric toxins can be explained by the presence of an additional disulfide bond. Nevertheless, the obtained quantities of chimeras were sufficient for structural and electrophysiological investigations. The N-terminal analysis using Edman's degradation showed that the obtained recombinant toxins had N-terminal sequences identical to that of the wild-type NTII. Thus, mutant neurotoxins were secreted into periplasm and the signal peptide STII was properly cleaved. Mass spectral analysis of natural NTII and mutant neurotoxins revealed very good correlation between the determined masses and expected calculated values (8020 Da versus 8021, 6878 versus 6877, 7257 versus 7258, and 7314 versus 7315 for NTI, NTII, NTII/I and NTII/I[A29K], respectively). Structural Analysis of Recombinant Chimeras—The fragments grafted to NTII consist of 7 residues and include additional disulfide bond. Introduction of these fragments might affect the stability and spatial structure of chimeric toxins. We used NMR spectroscopy to estimate possible changes in spatial structure of chimeras. The one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra for recombinant NTII/I and NTII/I[A29K] displayed narrow NMR lines and a large dispersion of signals in amide and aliphatic regions. Comparison with the one-dimensional 1H spectrum of NTII revealed almost coinciding envelope for all three one-dimensional spectra, with intact position of several characteristic non-overlapping resonances and with additional signals in the case of chimeras (data not shown). The 1H-15N HSQC spectra for recombinant 15N-labeled NTII and NTII/I (Fig. 3, A and B) revealed almost complete correspondence of 1H and 15N resonance frequencies for common residues in both toxins. The detailed analysis of these spectra allowed us to make resonance assignment for the NTII/I chimera. Comparison of the one-dimensional 1H spectrum of NTII/I[A29K] with the HSQC spectrum of NTII/I (Fig. 3C) indicated that point mutation A29K does not change the spatial structure of chimeric toxin. Thus, recombinant chimeras share a common, relatively rigid spatial structure with neurotoxin II. This conclusion was also supported by CD spectroscopy data (not shown). Electrophysiological Analysis of Chimeras—The biological activity of modified neurotoxins was tested in vitro by measuring the ability to inhibit acetylcholine-induced currents at neuronal α7 and α3β2 nAChRs expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The capacity of neurotoxins NTI and NTII to inhibit ACh-evoked currents at the human α7 nAChR was first examined. Fig. 4A shows that NTI blocked the human α7 nAChR with an IC50 of 34 nm, whereas the short-chain NTII had no effect. Then the effects of the NTII/I and NTII/I[A29K] chimeras at the human α7 nAChR were assessed. The inclusion of the central loop tip containing the additional disulfide in NTII conveyed activity at α7 nAChRs to NTII/I chimera (IC50 of 6.1 nm) (Fig. 4B). The second chimera, NTII/I[A29K], also inhibited ACh-evoked currents; however, the A29K substitution in the tip considerably decreased the activity at the α7 nAChR (IC50 126 nm, Fig. 4C). Neither the native toxins NTI and NTII nor the chimeras NTII/I and NTII/I[A29K] inhibited currents at human α3β2 nAChRs at concentrations up to 1 μm (data not shown). Modeling of Spatial Structures for Chimeric Toxins and Their Complexes with nAChRs—The spatial structures of the chimeric toxins were constructed using homology modeling on the basis of three-dimensional structures of NTI, NTII, and α-cobratoxin. The introduction of the insert from the long-chain neurotoxin and subsequent A29K replacement did not affect the stability of the general fold of the molecule and did not influence the flexibility of the disulfide-fixed core taken from NTII. Constructed models of the nAChR subunits and their assemblies (α7 and α3β2) were similar to those built previously (35Mordvintsev D.Y. Polyak Y.L. Levtsova O.V. Tourleigh Y.V. Kasheverov I.E.

The control docking of NTII and NTI to α7 and α3β2 nAChRs gave stable complex only in the case of NTI/-α7 (similar to 1YI5) (28Bourne Y. Talley T.T. Hansen S.B. Taylor P. Marchot P. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1512-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Docking of NTII/I chimera was possible both to α7 and α3β2, but only NTII/I-α7 complex was stable during subsequent molecular dynamics simulation. The main interactions were with the C-loop of the nAChR principal site, similar to α-cobratoxin complex (28Bourne Y. Talley T.T. Hansen S.B. Taylor P. Marchot P. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1512-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). However, the position of the whole chimera molecule resembled NTII bound to the α/γ interface of Torpedo nAChR (35Mordvintsev D.Y. Polyak Y.L. Levtsova O.V. Tourleigh Y.V. Kasheverov I.E. Shaitan K.V. Utkin Y.N. Tsetlin V.I. Comput. Biol. Chem. 2005; 29: 398-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Docking studies suggest that the A29K substitution in the NTII/I[A29K] chimera should not influence the position of the chimeric toxin on the receptor interface. However, the affinity of NTII/I[A29K] chimera to the α7 nAChR subtype was higher than to α3β2 nAChR (estimated energies of interaction are 1400 KJ/mol/binding site and 340 KJ/mol/binding site, respectively). Moreover, the chimera complex with α3β2 nAChR was unstable under MD simulation. Until recently, information on the mode of interaction of diverse snake toxins with various nAChRs was based mainly on mutations of toxins and/or receptors, pair-wise mutagenesis, and cross-linking (20Tsetlin V.I. Hucho F. FEBS Lett. 2004; 557: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Such approaches revealed, for example, some differences between short-chain and long-chain α-neurotoxins in the involvement of their three loops in the interaction with muscle-type nAChRs (38Antil S. Servent D. Menez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34851-34858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 39Teixeira-Clerc F. Menez A. Kessler P. J. Biol. Chem. 200"

Here, I combine data from (i) a long-term Black-winged Stilt (Himantopus himantopus) monitoring program, (ii) a capture-recapture marking program in Doñana, and (iii) reports from the Rare Birds Committee in the United Kingdom to analyse at different geographical scales the relationship between climate, survival, philopatry, and dispersive behaviour. Black-winged Stilt populations varied in size in consonance with changes in both the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and local rainfall during the breeding season. Changes in population size are related to changes in philopatry and increases in dispersal beyond the traditional range of the species.

Paradoxically, classical anti-psychotic, anti-calmodulin drugs were noted here to inhibit Ca(2+)-uptake via the vanilloid inducible Ca(2+)-channel/inflamatory pain receptor 1 (TRPV1), which suggests that calmodulin inhibitors may block pore formation and Ca(2+) entry. Functional assays on TRPV1 expressing cells support direct, dose-dependent inhibition of vanilloid-induced (45)Ca(2+)-uptake at microM concentrations: calmidazolium (broad range) > or = trifluoperazine (narrow range) chlorpromazine/amitriptyline>fluphenazine>>W-7 and W-13 (only partially). Most likely a short acidic domain at the pore loop of the channel orifice functions as binding site either for Ca(2+) or anti-calmodulin drugs. Camstatin, a selective peptide blocker of calmodulin, inhibits vanilloid-induced Ca(2+)-uptake in intact TRPV1(+) cells, and suggests an extracellular site of inhibition. TRPV1(+), inflammatory pain-conferring nociceptive neurons from sensory ganglia, were blocked by various anti-psychotic and anti-calmodulin drugs. Among them, calmidazolium, the most effective calmodulin agonist, blocked Ca(2+)-entry by a non-competitive kinetics, affecting the TRPV1 at a different site than the vanilloid binding pocket. Data suggest that various calmodulin antagonists dock to an extracellular site, not found in other Ca(2+)-channels. Calmodulin antagonist-evoked inhibition of TRPV1 and NMDA receptors/Ca(2+)-channels was validated by microiontophoresis of calmidazolium to laminectomised rat monitored with extracellular single unit recordings in vivo. These unexpected findings may explain empirically noted efficacy of clinical pain adjuvant therapy that justify efforts to develop hits into painkillers, selective to sensory Ca(2+)-channels but not affecting motoneurons."
https://openalex.org/W2065315614,"Background Selective control in a population is the ability to control a member of the population while leaving the other members relatively unaffected. The concept of selective control is developed using cell death or apoptosis in heterogeneous cell populations as an example. Control of apoptosis is essential in a variety of therapeutic environments, including cancer where cancer cell death is a desired outcome and Alzheimer's disease where neuron survival is the desired outcome. However, in both cases these responses must occur with minimal response in other cells exposed to treatment; that is, the response must be selective. Methodology and Principal Findings Apoptosis signaling in heterogeneous cells is described by an ensemble of gene networks with identical topology but different link strengths. Selective control depends on the statistics of signaling in the ensemble of networks, and we analyze the effects of superposition, non-linearity and feedback on these statistics. Parallel pathways promote normal statistics while series pathways promote skew distributions, which in the most extreme cases become log-normal. We also show that feedback and non-linearity can produce bimodal signaling statistics, as can discreteness and non-linearity. Two methods for optimizing selective control are presented. The first is an exhaustive search method and the second is a linear programming based approach. Though control of a single gene in the signaling network yields little selectivity, control of a few genes typically yields higher levels of selectivity. The statistics of gene combinations susceptible to selective control in heterogeneous apoptosis networks is studied and is used to identify general control strategies. Conclusions and Significance We have explored two methods for the study of selectivity in cell populations. The first is an exhaustive search method limited to three node perturbations. The second is an effective linear model, based on interpolation of single node sensitivity, in which the selective combinations can be found by linear programming optimization. We found that selectivity is promoted by acting on the least sensitive nodes in the case of weak populations, while selective control of robust populations is optimized through perturbations of more sensitive nodes. High throughput experiments with heterogeneous cell lines could be designed in an analogous manner, with the further possibility of incorporating the selectivity optimization process into a closed-loop control system."
https://openalex.org/W1975877902,"Recent studies suggest that adolescent adiposity is established already in preadolescence. Earlier studies have confirmed a strong tracking of obesity from adolescence to adulthood. Our aim was to examine the diagnostic accuracy of a population-derived protocol for identification of preschool children at risk for obesity in preadolescence.We analysed data obtained for child health surveillance up to age 5 from 5778 children born in a Swedish county in 1991. The basic data set included age, sex, and weight and height measurements from the regular checkups between ages 1.5 and 5. Data not routinely collected in the child health centre setting were disregarded. The children were at age 10 randomly assigned to protocol derivation and validation cohorts and assessed for obesity according to IOTF criteria. The accuracy of predicting obesity in the validation cohort was measured using decision precision, specificity, and sensitivity. The decision protocol selected 1.4% of preschool children as being at obesity risk. The precision of the protocol at age 10 was 82% for girls and 80% for boys, and the specificity was 100% for both boys and girls. The sensitivity was higher for girls (41%) than for boys (21%). The relative risk for obesity at age 10 estimated by the odds ratio for individuals selected by the protocol compared to non-selected peers was 212.6 (95% confidence interval 56.6 to 798.4) for girls and 120.3 (95% CI 24.5 to 589.9) for boys.A simple and inexpensive decision protocol based on BMI values proved to have high precision and specificity for identification of preschool children at risk for obesity persisting into adolescence, while the sensitivity was low especially for boys. Implementation and further evaluations of the protocol in child health centre settings are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2057148725,"(A) Newly synthesized secretory and membrane proteins enter the ER through the Sec61 protein-conducting channel complex unfolded. Hsp70-related molecular chaperones (Kar2p) bind to nascent polypeptides in the ER lumen and to the cytosolic domains of membrane proteins (Hsp70, B). These factors assist in substrate folding and also assist in their disposal if they fail to fold. Mannose residues on misfolded glycoproteins are trimmed by the ER mannosidase Mns1p (E). Mannose trimming facilitates the recognition of misfolded glycoproteins by luminally oriented lectin factors Htm1p and Yos9p. (C, D, and F) At least two ER membrane-localized E3 ubiquitin ligases organize protein complexes that receive and process misfolded proteins. These complexes define three pathways that recognize lesions in the cytosolic (ERAD-C), transmembrane (ERAD-M), and luminal (ERAD-L) domains of substrates. Both ERAD-M and ERAD-L use the Hrd1 ubiquitin ligase but the luminal factor Yos9p is dispensable for ERAD-M. A Hrd1 complex lacking Yos9p has been observed suggesting dedicated complexes for all three pathways. As ubiquitina-tion and degradation occurs in the cytosol, luminal substrates must be retrotranslocated. The identity of the conduit remains unresolved in the ubiquitin-dependent pathways, but the Sec61 complex and Der1 family members have been implicated. (G) In the yeast ubiquitin-independent pathway, misfolded proα-factor in yeast exits via Sec61. Cdc48p/p97 and its cofactors Npl4p and Ufd1p provide the driving force for the extraction of ubiquitinated luminal and membrane substrates from the ER membrane. In association with the Cdc48p/p97 complex, the E4 enzyme Ufd2p remodels ubiquitin chains. The polyubiquitinated substrate is transferred to the Rad23p or Dsk2p complexes assisted through an association with Ufd2p (H). N-linked glycans are removed by Png1p. Finally, the substrate is targeted by this complex to the proteasome where it is degraded (I)."
https://openalex.org/W1975797445,"Whether and how thermal reaction norm is under genetic control is fundamental to understand the mechanistic basis of adaptation to novel thermal environments. However, the genetic study of thermal reaction norm is difficult because it is often expressed as a continuous function or curve. Here we derive a statistical model for dissecting thermal performance curves into individual quantitative trait loci (QTL) with the aid of a genetic linkage map. The model is constructed within the maximum likelihood context and implemented with the EM algorithm. It integrates the biological principle of responses to temperature into a framework for genetic mapping through rigorous mathematical functions established to describe the pattern and shape of thermal reaction norms. The biological advantages of the model lie in the decomposition of the genetic causes for thermal reaction norm into its biologically interpretable modes, such as hotter-colder, faster-slower and generalist-specialist, as well as the formulation of a series of hypotheses at the interface between genetic actions/interactions and temperature-dependent sensitivity. The model is also meritorious in statistics because the precision of parameter estimation and power of QTLdetection can be increased by modeling the mean-covariance structure with a small set of parameters. The results from simulation studies suggest that the model displays favorable statistical properties and can be robust in practical genetic applications. The model provides a conceptual platform for testing many ecologically relevant hypotheses regarding organismic adaptation within the Eco-Devo paradigm."
