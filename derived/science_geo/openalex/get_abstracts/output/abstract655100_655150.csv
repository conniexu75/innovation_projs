https://openalex.org/W3037578804,"The recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the devastating COVID-19 lung disease pandemic. Here, we tested the inhibitory activities of the antiviral interferons of type I (IFN-α) and type III (IFN-λ) against SARS-CoV-2 and compared them with those against SARS-CoV-1, which emerged in 2003. Using two mammalian epithelial cell lines (human Calu-3 and simian Vero E6), we found that both IFNs dose-dependently inhibit SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, SARS-CoV-1 was restricted only by IFN-α in these cell lines. SARS-CoV-2 generally exhibited a broader IFN sensitivity than SARS-CoV-1. Moreover, ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of IFN-triggered Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling, boosted SARS-CoV-2 replication in the IFN-competent Calu-3 cells. We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to exogenously added IFNs. This finding suggests that type I and especially the less adverse effect-prone type III IFN are good candidates for the management of COVID-19."

These entangled pairs are valuable commodities for quantum information processing and quantum communications. Because the experimental setup is usually performed with bulk optical components, there is a need to decrease the size scale for application. Li et al. combined an array of specialized metalenses with a nonlinear crystal and show that the scale of the process can be shrunk substantially. The approach should prove useful for developing miniaturized integrated quantum optical technologies. Science , this issue p. 1487"

González-Rubio et al. show that morphological chirality can be induced during the seeded growth of gold nanoparticles, particularly for highly anisotropic nanorods. Chiral additives as cosurfactants formed helical micelles that directed the seeded growth to create grooves that maintained a chiral morphology. The resulting particles displayed high-intensity circular dichroism with anisotropy factors near 0.2 at near-infrared wavelengths. Science , this issue p. 1472"
https://openalex.org/W3037756962,"The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents a global challenge for managing acutely ill patients and complications from viral infection. Systemic inflammation accompanied by a “cytokine storm,” hemostasis alterations and severe vasculitis have all been reported to occur with COVID-19, and emerging evidence suggests that dysregulation of lipid transport may contribute to some of these complications. Here, we aim to summarize the current understanding of the potential mechanisms related to COVID-19 dyslipidemia and propose possible adjunctive type therapeutic approaches that modulate lipids and lipoproteins. Specifically, we hypothesize that changes in the quantity and composition of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) that occurs with COVID-19 can significantly decrease the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative functions of HDL and could contribute to pulmonary inflammation. Furthermore, we propose that lipoproteins with oxidized phospholipids and fatty acids could lead to virus-associated organ damage via overactivation of innate immune scavenger receptors. Restoring lipoprotein function with ApoA-I raising agents or blocking relevant scavenger receptors with neutralizing antibodies could, therefore, be of value in the treatment of COVID-19. Finally, we discuss the role of omega-3 fatty acids transported by lipoproteins in generating specialized proresolving mediators and how together with anti-inflammatory drugs, they could decrease inflammation and thrombotic complications associated with COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3037519049,"Gene regulation is chiefly determined at the level of individual linear chromatin molecules, yet our current understanding of cis-regulatory architectures derives from fragmented sampling of large numbers of disparate molecules. We developed an approach for precisely stenciling the structure of individual chromatin fibers onto their composite DNA templates using nonspecific DNA N6-adenine methyltransferases. Single-molecule long-read sequencing of chromatin stencils enabled nucleotide-resolution readout of the primary architecture of multikilobase chromatin fibers (Fiber-seq). Fiber-seq exposed widespread plasticity in the linear organization of individual chromatin fibers and illuminated principles guiding regulatory DNA actuation, the coordinated actuation of neighboring regulatory elements, single-molecule nucleosome positioning, and single-molecule transcription factor occupancy. Our approach and results open new vistas on the primary architecture of gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W3037808763,"The fate of genes after duplication Gene duplication within an organism is a relatively common event during evolution. However, we cannot predict the fate of the duplicated genes: Will they be lost, evolve, or overlap in function within an organismal lineage or species? Kuzmin et al. explored the fate of duplicated gene function within the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (see the Perspective by Ehrenreich). They examined how experimental deletions of one or two duplicated genes (paralogs) affected yeast fitness and were able to determine which genes have likely evolved new essential functions and which retained functional overlap, a condition the authors refer to as entanglement. On the basis of these results, they propose how entanglement affects the evolutionary trajectory of gene duplications. Science , this issue p. eaaz5667 ; see also p. 1424"
https://openalex.org/W3038113245,"The flow of plasma inside the Sun The activity of the Sun, including the occurrence of sunspots, is driven by magnetic fields that originate from the motion of charged plasma beneath the surface. Helioseismology uses acoustic oscillations to probe the Sun's interior, analogous to seismology's use of earthquakes to investigate Earth's interior. Gizon et al. analyzed helioseismology data from 1996 to 2019, covering two 11-year solar cycles. They measured the latitudinal and radial flow of plasma as a function of depth within the Sun and how it varies with time. The results support magnetic flux-transport dynamo models, which can explain the distribution of sunspots over each solar cycle. Science , this issue p. 1469"
https://openalex.org/W3037423625,"Although sled dogs are one of the most specialized groups of dogs, their origin and evolution has received much less attention than many other dog groups. We applied a genomic approach to investigate their spatiotemporal emergence by sequencing the genomes of 10 modern Greenland sled dogs, an ~9500-year-old Siberian dog associated with archaeological evidence for sled technology, and an ~33,000-year-old Siberian wolf. We found noteworthy genetic similarity between the ancient dog and modern sled dogs. We detected gene flow from Pleistocene Siberian wolves, but not modern American wolves, to present-day sled dogs. The results indicate that the major ancestry of modern sled dogs traces back to Siberia, where sled dog-specific haplotypes of genes that potentially relate to Arctic adaptation were established by 9500 years ago."
https://openalex.org/W3100844675,"DNA circular dichroism in gas phase Circular dichroism spectroscopy is widely used to distinguish between nonidentical mirror-image molecules. The technique relies on differential absorption of left versus right circularly polarized light and therefore tends to require solution-phase samples for adequate sensitivity. Daly et al. now report gas-phase circular dichroism spectra of DNA oligonucleotides based on detection of photodetached electrons rather than transmitted light (see the Perspective by Barran). The salient spectral features matched those in solution. Pairing the technique with mass spectrometry enables prior mass selection of particular molecules for analysis.

https://openalex.org/W3037984818,"The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has challenged the speed at which laboratories can discover the viral composition and study health outcomes. The small ∼30-kb ssRNA genome of coronaviruses makes them adept at cross-species spread while enabling a robust understanding of all of the proteins the viral genome encodes. We have employed protein modeling, molecular dynamics simulations, evolutionary mapping, and 3D printing to gain a full proteome- and dynamicome-level understanding of SARS-CoV-2. We established the Viral Integrated Structural Evolution Dynamic Database (VIStEDD at RRID:SCR_018793) to facilitate future discoveries and educational use. Here, we highlight the use of VIStEDD for nsp6, nucleocapsid (N), and spike (S) surface glycoprotein. For both nsp6 and N, we found highly conserved surface amino acids that likely drive protein–protein interactions. In characterizing viral S protein, we developed a quantitative dynamics cross-correlation matrix to gain insights into its interactions with the angiotensin I–converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)–solute carrier family 6 member 19 (SLC6A19) dimer. Using this quantitative matrix, we elucidated 47 potential functional missense variants from genomic databases within ACE2/SLC6A19/transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), warranting genomic enrichment analyses in SARS-CoV-2 patients. These variants had ultralow frequency but existed in males hemizygous for ACE2. Two ACE2 noncoding variants (rs4646118 and rs143185769) present in ∼9% of individuals of African descent may regulate ACE2 expression and may be associated with increased susceptibility of African Americans to SARS-CoV-2. We propose that this SARS-CoV-2 database may aid research into the ongoing pandemic.

We propose that this SARS-CoV-2 database may aid research into the ongoing pandemic. The current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has become a global pandemic. There is an urgent need to understand the proteins coded by SARS-CoV-2 and how they can be targeted for intervention. Coronaviruses belong to the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily, which lies under the Coronaviridae family. Their 26–33-kb genome consists of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA, coding for nonstructural and structural proteins. To date, seven coronaviruses have been discovered that are capable of human-to-human transmission. Four of these cause the common cold (HKU1, NL63, OC43, and 229E), whereas the other three (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2) can cause more severe respiratory illnesses resulting in multisystem organ failure and death (1Kasmi Y. Khataby K. Souiri A. Ennaji M.M. Coronaviridae: 100,000 years of emergence and reemergence.in: Ennaji M.M. Emerging and Reemerging Viral Pathogens.

Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 bind to the ACE2 receptor through the spike (S) protein (2Yan R. Zhang Y. Li Y. Xia L. Guo Y. Zhou Q. Structural basis for the recognition of SARS-CoV-2 by full-length human ACE2.Science. 2020; 367 (32132184): 1444-144810.1126/science.abb2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (3014) Google Scholar, 3Kuba K.

The ubiquitous presence of Coronaviridae in many animals and its relatively small genome makes these an ideal infective agent as it adapts and evolves into a highly effective pathogen. In the case of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, 96.2% of the genome is shared with a bat coronavirus, suggesting a zoonotic origin (4Ceraolo C. Giorgi F.M. Genomic variance of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus.J. Med.

Initial disease propagation was detected in Wuhan, China, a major transportation hub with over 11 million people. The population density and the heavy traffic into and out of the city made for a large outbreak that spread quickly throughout the world (6Guarner J. Three emerging coronaviruses in two decades: the story of SARS, MERS, and now COVID-19.Am. J. Clin.

This combination has given rise to a once-in-a-generation pandemic. Insights can be gathered from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV regarding SARS-CoV-2 illness severity. Studies in mouse models have led to speculation that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections cause a delayed type I interferon response, which allows for early uncontrolled viral replication. This leads to an influx of neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages, resulting in a hyperproduction of cytokines causing pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and global sepsis. In SARS-CoV-2, patients experience similar changes in neutrophils and lymphocytes, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 infection severity may closely depend on a delayed response of the innate immune system (8Prompetchara E. Ketloy C. Palaga T. Immune responses in COVID-19 and potential vaccines: lessons learned from SARS and MERS epidemic.Asian Pac. J. Allergy Immunol. 2020; 38 (32105090): 1-910.12932/ap-200220-0772PubMed Google Scholar). Early Chinese data provide remarkable insights into how SARS-CoV-2 drives lethality through a sepsis-driven multiple-organ failure model (9Zhou F. Yu T. Du R. Fan G. Liu Y. Liu Z. Xiang J. Wang Y.

Understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 genome could provide critical insights into the complex interplay with the host genome driving disease progression in severe risk group patients, allowing for the identification of potential target sites for intervention. Several Coronaviridae proteins have been highly studied as targets of intervention to prevent infection spread. One of these proteins, the N protein, is of particular interest as it interacts with host ribosomal subunits and has been shown to suppress nonsense-mediated decay of viral mRNA by the host cell (12Wada M. Lokugamage K.G. Nakagawa K. Narayanan K. Makino S. Interplay between coronavirus, a cytoplasmic RNA virus, and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Enzymes encoded by SARS-CoV-2, such as the 3-chymotrypsin (3C)-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and papain-like protease, are potential targets of drugs (14Wu C. Liu Y. Yang Y. Zhang P. Zhong W. Wang Y. Wang Q. Xu Y. Li M. Li X. Zheng M. Chen L. Li H. Analysis of therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2 and discovery of potential drugs by computational methods.Acta Pharm. Sin.

Proteins of the virus, including N, nsp9, nsp13, nsp15, ORF3a, and ORF6, have been shown to target innate immune signaling pathways (13Malle L. A map of SARS-CoV-2 and host cell interactions.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20 (32211816): 35110.1038/s41577-020-0318-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The S protein, surface-expressed, enters cells through ACE2/SLC6A19 membrane receptor contact similarly to SARS-CoV, but with higher binding affinity (2Yan R. Zhang Y. Li Y. Xia L. Guo Y. Zhou Q. Structural basis for the recognition of SARS-CoV-2 by full-length human ACE2.Science. 2020; 367 (32132184): 1444-144810.1126/science.abb2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (3014) Google Scholar). This interaction has the potential to be therapeutically inhibited through antibody neutralization (15Walls A.C. Park Y.-J. Tortorici M.A. Wall A. McGuire A.T. Veesler D. Structure, function, and antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein.Cell. 2020; 181 (32155444): 281-292.e610.1016/j.cell.2020.02.058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5041) Google Scholar). ACE2 is highly expressed in the heart, small intestine, kidney, thyroid, breast, arterial walls, adipose, and testis, with a lower number of cells in lung, oral/nasal cavity, pancreas, and liver (16Hamming I. Timens W. Bulthuis M.L.C. Lely A.T. Navis G.J. van Goor H. Tissue distribution of ACE2 protein, the functional receptor for SARS coronavirus: a first step in understanding SARS pathogenesis.J.

Berg M. Queen R. Litvinukova M. Talavera-López C. Maatz H. Reichart D. Sampaziotis F. Worlock K.B. Yoshida M. Barnes J.L.

In the lung, ACE2 is expressed in the type 2 pneumocytes, putative progenitor cells of alveolar epithelia linked to lung fibrosis pathways (18Uhal B.D. Dang M. Dang V. Llatos R. Cano E. Abdul-Hafez A. Markey J. Piasecki C.C. Molina-Molina M. Cell cycle dependence of ACE-2 explains downregulation in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.Eur. Respir.

The spike-ACE2 complex is further processed by TMPRSS2 for internalization of the virus, which has been postulated to be a target site with protease inhibitors (20Hoffmann M. Kleine-Weber H. Schroeder S. Krüger N. Herrler T. Erichsen S. Schiergens T.S. Herrler G. Wu N.-H. Nitsche A. Müller M.A. Drosten C. Pöhlmann S.

Currently, it is not well-understood how the spike-ACE2 complex is impacted by viral or human variants, suggesting a need for further research. As we learn more about viral pathogenesis, hopefully the current outbreak will be brought under control and future outbreaks prevented. In this current work, we developed the Viral Integrated Structural Evolution Dynamic Database (VIStEDD) for the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, enriching VIStEDD using evolutionary insights of viruses and human variant mapping for potential functional outcomes. A total of 24 proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1) were run through our standardized workflow (Fig. 1), consisting of protein structure assessment, setting of protein protonation at pH 7.4, energy minimization in water with NaCl, 20 ns of molecular dynamics simulations, analysis of the movement trajectories, sequence identification from the nonredundant (nr) database, mapping of conservation onto structure/dynamics, and assessment of interactions with known binding partners. We extracted 55,390 sequences homologous to the SARS-CoV-2 proteins that consist of 9,701 amino acids (Table 1). The uneven sequence depth for each of the proteins made it necessary to utilize a z-score conservation calculation for each of the amino acids in the proteins so as to normalize, using the average (z-score of 0) as the starting point (yellow), followed by z-scores of 0–0.5 (yellow), 0.5–1 (bright orange), 1–1.5 (orange), 1.5–2 (dark orange), and >2 (red) (Fig. 2). The dynamics and evolution for each protein were integrated together into VIStEDD, available at RRID:SCR_018793. VIStEDD has been built for the addition of future viruses. Within the SARS-CoV-2 page is a list of each of the 24 proteins in the format of Table 1, where each protein can be clicked to assess data. On the page for each protein is a link to the individual protein data folder system, a video of the protein rotating with conservation, details of the protein function, a widget to purchase a 3D print of the protein at cost of production, the amino acid movement from molecular dynamics simulations (mds), and the table of data for each amino acid of the protein. If protein interactions structures are known, information is present with a link to protein–protein interaction (PPI) data. For example, within the nsp10 data (RRID:SCR_018793, SARS-CoV-2, nsp10), structures of nsp10 interacting with either nsp14 or nsp16 are available, both of which show highly conserved contact sites of interaction. As we continue to advance VIStEDD, we anticipate the addition of more material within each page.Table 1SARS-CoV-2 proteins analyzedGeneSARS proteinAccessionModeling toolPDB filesAmino acidsBound moleculesSequencesRMSFDCCM >0.9CHETGrepnsp1QHD43415YASARA2GDT1802503.63.143.321.122.211.12.2repnsp2QHD43415ITASSER6382466.011.867.119.10.612.50.6repPapain-like proteinaseQHD43415YASARAMultiple1945Zn3,1803.18.850.524.613.111.30.5repnsp4QHD43415ITASSER5003,3252.83.057.835.00.07.20.0rep3C-like proteinaseQHD43415YASARAMultiple306Dimer3,3971.40.626.523.931.716.71.3repnsp6QHD43415ITASSER2902,5582.60.762.814.11.421.70.0repnsp7QHD43415YASARA6NUR, 2AHM, 3UB0833,2562.93.08.481.90.09.60.0repnsp8QHD43415YASARA6NUR, 3UB0, 5XOG1983,3395.98.919.252.019.79.10.0repnsp9QHD43415YASARAMultiple113Dimer3,3861.50.120.414.247.817.70.0repnsp10QHD43415YASARAMultiple139Zn3,3441.80.444.628.17.220.10.0repRNA-directed RNA polymeraseQHD43415YASARA6NUR932Zn5,0862.22.830.542.011.513.32.8repHelicaseQHD43415YASARA5WWP, 6JYT601Zn5,5981.51.535.826.623.514.10.0repGuanine-N7 methyltransferaseQHD43415YASARA5NFY, 5C8T527Zn2,7942.12.436.120.124.117.52.3repUridylate-specific endoribonucleaseQHD43415YASARAMultiple3462,4891.30.437.923.429.87.81.2rep2′-O-methyltransferaseQHD43415YASARA2XYV, 5YNN298Na, Mg, SAH2,4951.30.040.323.818.113.44.4SSpike glycoproteinQHD43416.1YASARA6CRW, 6NB6, 5X581273Trimer/Membrane6,6123.05.440.423.025.310.40.93aProtein 3aQIM47458.1ITASSER275652.70.673.812.02.511.60.0EEQIM47459.1ITASSER75944.82.218.758.70.016.06.7MMembrane proteinQIM47460.1ITASSER2221,5072.70.551.820.77.719.80.06ORF6QIM47461.1ITASSER61319.28.257.56.49.126.01.07a7aQHD43421.1YASARA1XAK, 1YO4121426.56.533.117.432.217.40.08ORF8QIM47463.1ITASSER121352.20.469.410.70.019.80.0NNucleoproteinQHD43423.2YASARA/ITASSERMultiple4192,2612.70.247.526.20.019.76.610ORF10QIM47465.1ITASSER382.60.042.131.626.30.00.0 Open table in a new tab Figure 2SARS-CoV-2 structural/evolution models.

For each protein present in VIStEDD, we have generated in the root folder of the protein a fasta sequence file, PDB file of the protein structure, protein models with conservation (sce = YASARA scene, pse- PyMOL scene), high-resolution image of conservation, molecular video of the conservation rotating around the y axis (mpg and mp4), and compiled conservation and dynamics data for each amino acid (csv or tab-delineated). Five folders of data are also present: 1) 3D, containing a vrml 3D printing file (also zipped) of conservation mapped on the protein; 2) genomics, containing aligned reads of the species sequences extracted; 3) mds, containing all of the trajectory files for the mds; 4) report, containing all of the analysis files from YASARA assessment of mds; and 5) tab, containing all of the tab-delineated analysis files of the mds. All of the 3D files can be ordered from Shapeways with the web links provided in Table S1. Another folder (PPI) contains data for all of the mds performed on protein–protein interactions, including spike-ACE2-SLC6A19, TMPRSS2, the polymerase complex, the N complex, and ACE2_S_Database consisting of 235 species ACE2 sequences modeled with spike interaction, energy-minimized, and binding or potential energy calculated. A tab-delineated file is in the ACE2_S_Database to label the species for each numbered complex. From the mds of all proteins, a total of 6,594,981 atoms including water, there is an average movement per amino acid (root mean square fluctuation (RMSF)) of 3.2 Å with 3 amino acids correlated per residue >0.9 based on dynamics cross-correlation calculation. The secondary structures of the proteins are relatively similar from the beginning of the simulation compared with the end (Fig. 3A), with the largest percentage coiled (C, 45.02%) followed by helix (H, 25.42%), β-sheet (E, 15.08%), turns (T, 13.44%), and three-turn helix (G, 1.05%). On their own, before PPI, the nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, E, 3C-proteinase, and RNA-directed RNA polymerase are the most helical and β-sheet–containing proteins, whereas protein 3a, ORF8, nsp2, nsp6, and nsp4 are the most disordered with coil composition (Fig. 3B). Several of the proteins contain high movement of the structure (ORF6, ORF7a, nsp8, and nsp2), and two of the proteins (papain-like proteinase and spike glycoprotein) have more overall lower movement indicative of hydrophobic collapse, with a high number of correlated amino acids per residue (Fig. 3C). The largest proteins of SARS-CoV-2 contain the highest number of sequences extracted for homology, including the papain-like proteinase, RNA-directed RNA polymerase, spike glycoprotein, and helicase (Fig. 3D). Several of the proteins, including E, protein 3a, protein 7a, ORF8, and ORF6, have a low number of mapped sequences (Fig. 3D), whereas ORF10 has no other identified sequences. Plotting the conservation relative to the mds-based movement, RMSF, for each of the 9,701 amino acids of SARS-CoV-2 can be used to identify critical sites of proteins under high selection that might be targeted (Fig. 3E). Highly dynamic and conserved amino acids are the prime location for critical PPI. Therefore, we mapped sites of high movement, >5 Å, with conservation 1–1.5 (gray), 1.5–2 (orange), or >2 (red) S.D. values higher than the mean of the protein. Clustering these sites to the percentage of amino acid reveals a likely high selection of dynamic amino acids (Fig. 3F). The nsp2 protein with low coverage of species has some suggested PPI contacts conserved in the range of 1–1.5 S.D. conservation. Proteins nsp7 and nsp8, which are known to contact the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Fig. 1), have several amino acids conserved in the 1.5–2 S.D. range with high dynamics, as the mds of PDB 6m71 and 7btf show stability and correlation to PPI within VIStEDD. The papain-like protease and nsp6 have conserved sites >2 S.D. values (Fig. 3F). The SARS-CoV-2 nsp6 protein is known to interact with multiple ATPases of vesicle trafficking (21Gordon D.E. Jang G.M.

Akhlaghpour M. Neuman B.W. Buchmeier M.J.

Nsp6 protein also interacts with the Sigma receptor, which is thought to regulate ER stress response (21Gordon D.E. Jang G.M. Bouhaddou M. Xu J. Obernier K. O'Meara M.J. Guo J.Z. Swaney D.L. Tummino T.A. Huettenhain R. Kaake R.M. Richards A.L. Tutuncuoglu B. Foussard H.

Whelband M.C. Wileman T. Coronavirus NSP6 restricts autophagosome expansion.Autophagy. 2014; 10 (24991833): 1426-144110.4161/auto.29309Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To date, no structures of nsp6 have been solved even though the protein is present in 2,558 Coronaviridae genomes. We identify two regions with minimal conserved hydrophobic collapse (Fig. 3G) consisting of mostly coiled secondary structure (Fig. 3B). These two regions of conservation (Fig. 3G) cluster together with multiple charged and aromatic amino acids that would tend to drive PPI (Fig. 3, H and I). Moving forward, these nsp6 sites could be critical regions to target with therapeutics for the broad Coronaviridae proteins. Both the S and N proteins have multiple sites conserved >2 S.D. with high dynamics (Fig. 3F), with N having around 4% of its amino acids falling into this category. These two proteins are further dissected below. The SARS-CoV-2 N protein has been shown to interact with multiple RNA processing and stress granule proteins (21Gordon D.E. Jang G.M. Bouhaddou M. Xu J. Obernier K. O'Meara M.J. Guo J.Z. Swaney D.L. Tummino T.A. Huettenhain R. Kaake R.M. Richards A.L. Tutuncuoglu B. Foussard H. Batra J. et al.A SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interaction map reveals drug targets and potential drug-repurposing.bioRxiv. 2020; 10.1101/2020.03.22.002386Google Scholar). Using 2,261 sequences (Fig. 4A), we mapped four highly conserved regions of N (Fig. 4B). The conservation of region 1 contributes to a highly conserved hydrophobic, aromatic core consisting of several β strands (Fig. 4, C and D). Conserved region 3 consists of several serine amino acids that are likely phosphorylated and a potential 14-3-3 binding motif (Fig. 4D). Molecular dynamics of N suggests three regions of structural organization, with region 1 corresponding to a domain with structural folding (Fig. 4E). Amino acids 331–333 were the most conserved yet dynamic site of N (Fig. 4F). The C-terminal region of N is known to form a multimer complex (Fig. 4G) with amino acids 331–333 fitting into contacts of the subunits (Fig. 4H). From the multimer N structure, conserved amino acids Val-270, Phe-274, Arg-277, Asn-285, Gly-287, Phe-286, and Asp-288 are clustered and surface-exposed (Fig. 4I). These sites are likely to contribute to PPI and warrant future investigations. Building on our insights for N, we expanded to a systematic analysis of posttranslational modifications for SARS-CoV-2 proteins that was integrated into our amino acid matrix insights (Fig. 5). Current literature on SARS-CoV-2 modifications focuses on conserved and novel glycosylation and phosphorylation sites of the S protein (24Xiao X. Chakraborti S. Dimitrov A.S. Gramatikoff K. Dimitrov D.S. The SARS-CoV S glycoprotein: expression and functional characterization.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

With host–pathogen interaction being regulated by modifications, it is now a target for pharmacotherapy. Data from SARS-CoV suggest modifications in the N, M, E, 3a, nsp4, and nsp9 proteins that have yet to be explored in SAR-CoV-2 (25Fung T.S. Liu D.X.

Specifically, the N protein was shown to undergo extensive acetylation, phosphorylation, sumoylation, cleavage, and ADP-ribosylation (28Fan Z. Zhuo Y. Tan X. Zhou Z. Yuan J. Qiang B. Yan J. Peng X. Gao G.F. SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein binds to hUbc9, a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme of the sumoylation system.J. Med.

Inhibition of several cellular kinases (CK2 and CDK) was shown to impact proper localization of the N protein, trapping it within the nucleus of the host cell, further highlighting the need for N protein phosphorylation to carry out proper function (30Surjit M.

https://openalex.org/W3037439589,"Exposure to early life adversity is associated with chronic stress and a range of stress-related health problems in adulthood. Since chronic stress debilitates activity in the prefrontal cortex (pFC), maladaptive regulatory strategies in response to stress have been proposed as one explanation for the impact of early life adversity on health outcomes in adulthood. We conducted a study to examine the impact of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) on cognitive flexibility, a key executive function implicated in activity in the pFC, in a sample of adults (N = 486). Additionally, we investigated whether perceptions of chronic stress in adulthood would mediate the influence of ACEs on cognitive flexibility. However, stress is a subjective experience, and emotion regulation strategies can attenuate the stress response. So, we also examined if individual differences in emotion regulation strategies would modulate the relationship between ACEs and chronic stress. Our results demonstrate that early life adversity, as characterized by ACEs, is associated with decreased cognitive flexibility in adulthood. Additionally, number of ACEs was positively correlated with perceived stress, which in turn was negatively correlated with cognitive flexibility. But, individual differences in the habitual use of emotion regulation strategies moderated the influence of ACEs on chronic stress. Specifically, habitual use of cognitive reappraisal attenuated the stress levels whereas habitual use of expressive suppression exacerbated stress levels. Overall, our study highlights the importance of examining emotion regulation in individuals who have experienced early life adversity."

https://openalex.org/W3099422779,"A nearby multiplanet system Exoplanets can interact gravitationally with other objects orbiting the same star, affecting their evolution and stability. Studying these effects requires locating systems with multiple planets. Monitoring the nearby red dwarf star GJ 887, Jeffers et al. detected periodic radial velocity signals, indicating the presence of two planets on orbits with periods of about 9 and 22 days and a further candidate planet (see the Perspective by Davies). The inclinations of the orbits are unknown, so only minimum masses could be determined, but those were consistent with both planets being super-Earths—more massive than Earth but less than Neptune.

https://openalex.org/W3037451067,"Pairs of peaks stabilize output power A counterintuitive feature of photosynthesis is that the primary pigments involved in absorbing light—for example, chlorophyll a and b in plants—do not all absorb right at the peak of the spectrum but instead are offset from the peak and each other. Arp et al. formulated a network model that explains how using pigments with this absorption-peak pattern can mitigate internal and external fluctuations in energy transfer, minimizing noise in output power (see the Perspective by Duffy). The model accurately reproduces absorption peaks for three diverse photosynthetic systems from different spectral environments. Such a mechanism may provide an underlying robustness to biological photosynthetic processes that can be further tuned and tweaked to adapt to longer-scale fluctuations in light intensity.

The study aimed to determine the effect of foam rolling on the rate of lactate removal and DOMS prevention and whether the type of foam roller is effective in the context of post-exercise recovery.This randomized trial enrolled 33 active healthy males divided into three groups of eleven individuals: foam rolling with a smooth (STH) or grid roller (GRID) or passive recovery (PAS). All the participants performed full squat jumps for one minute. Examination took place at rest (thermal imaging of skin temperature-[Tsk] and blood lactate-[LA]), immediately following exercise (Tsk & LA), immediately after recovery treatment (Tsk) and after 30 minutes of rest (Tsk & LA). Their pain levels were assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after exercise.The magnitude of lactate decrease depended on the type of recovery used. In the PAS group, the decrease in lactate concentration by 2.65 mmol/L following a half-hour rest was significantly lower than that in the other groups (STH vs. PAS p = 0.042 / GRID vs. PAS p = 0.025). For thermal responses, significant differences between both experimental groups were noted only 30 minutes after exercise. A significant decrease in pain in the STH group occurred between 48 and 96 hours, while the GRID group showed a systematic significant decrease in VAS values in subsequent measurements. Changes in VAS values in subsequent measurements in the PAS group were not statistically significant (p>0.05).Foam rolling seems to be effective for enhancing lactate clearance and counteracting DOMS, but the type of foam roller does not seem to influence the recovery rate."
https://openalex.org/W3037391359,"There is extensive evidence today linking exposure to natural environments to favorable changes in mental and even physical health. There is also a growing body of work indicating that there are specific geometric properties of natural scenes that mediate these effects, and that these properties can also be found in artificial structures like buildings, especially those designed before the emergence of modernism. These geometries are also associated with aesthetic preference-we seem to like what is good for us. Here, using a questionnaire-based survey, we have tried to elucidate some of the parameters that play a role in formulating a preference for one form over the other. The images used were nature scenes from the Alpine landscape with various manipulations to alter their complexity, or with additions of computer graphics or various buildings. In all cases, the presence of a natural scaling hierarchy and of either fractal graphics or of ornate, non-local pre-modern buildings was always preferable to the alternative. We discuss these findings under the light of recent evidence in the field and conclude that they support the idea of the existence of a preference of our perceptive system for certain types of visual organization."
https://openalex.org/W3037250517,"The prevalence of HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C amongst migrants in France is high. Thus, effective screening and follow-up is needed. The mandatory medical check-up for residency application is an opportunity to offer rapid HIV and hepatitis testing. The main objective of the STRADA study is to create a feasible and acceptable screening strategy for migrants. Within the STRADA study, this qualitative research examined the acceptability of conducting screening tests in the context of residency application.We conducted a qualitative study amongst legal migrants over 18 years of age with sufficient knowledge of the French, English, or Arabic language. Interviews were performed following a semi-structured interview guide of open-ended questions. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and subsequently analyzed through thematic analysis.We interviewed 34 migrants. Mean age was 32.6 (min-max: 19, 59) years. The participants' region of origin was mostly Sub-Saharan Africa and the main reason for migrating to France was family reunification. Migrants' acceptability of HIV and hepatitis testing was high. Participants who accepted testing indicated a benefit for individual health and to avoid transmission. Most preferred rapid tests; reluctance was related to anxiety about the immediate results and the perceived reliability of rapid tests. Migrants' knowledge about HIV was satisfactory, but inadequate for hepatitis. Screening in the context of a compulsory medical visit did not present an obstacle for acceptability. Some expressed concern in the case of HIV but when explained, the independence between obtaining the residence permit along with screening and access to medical care was well understood.Medical check-ups at immigration centers is an opportunity to screen for HIV and hepatitis which is considered acceptable by migrants. Informing migrants that test results do not affect residency applications, and incorporating their preferences, are all important to optimize the acceptability of screening."
https://openalex.org/W3037631326,"This paper investigates the profile of COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong, highlighting the unique age structure of confirmed cases compared to other territories. While the majority of cases in most territories around the world have fitted an older age profile, our analysis shows that positive cases in Hong Kong have been concentrated among younger age groups, with the largest incidence of cases reported in the 15–24 age group. This is despite the population’s rapidly aging structure and extremely high levels of population density. Using detailed case data from Hong Kong’s Centre for Health Department and Immigration Department, we analyze the sex and age distribution of the confirmed cases along with their recent travel histories and immigration flows for the period January to April 2020. Our analysis highlights Hong Kong’s high proportion of imported cases and large overseas student population in developing COVID-19 hotspot areas such as the United Kingdom. Combined with community action and targeted and aggressive early policy measures taken to contain the virus, these factors may have contributed to the uniquely younger age structure of COVID-19 cases in the city. Consequently, this young profile of confirmed cases may have prevented fatalities in the territory. Recent research has highlighted the importance of a demographic approach to understanding COVID-19 transmission and fatality rates. The experience in Hong Kong shows that while an older population age structure may be important for understanding COVID-19 fatality, it is not a given. From a social science perspective at least, there is ‘no easy answer’ to why one area should experience COVID-19 differently from another."
https://openalex.org/W3038106806,"The transcription factor NF-ĸB is a master regulator of the innate immune response and plays a central role in inflammatory diseases by mediating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Ubiquitination-triggered proteasomal degradation of DNA-bound NF-ĸB strongly limits the expression of its target genes. Conversely, USP7 (deubiquitinase ubiquitin-specific peptidase 7) opposes the activities of E3 ligases, stabilizes DNA-bound NF-ĸB, and thereby promotes NF-ĸB–mediated transcription. Using gene expression and synthetic peptide arrays on membrane support and overlay analyses, we found here that inhibiting USP7 increases NF-ĸB ubiquitination and degradation, prevents Toll-like receptor–induced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and represents an effective strategy for controlling inflammation. However, the broad regulatory roles of USP7 in cell death pathways, chromatin, and DNA damage responses limit the use of catalytic inhibitors of USP7 as anti-inflammatory agents. To this end, we identified an NF-ĸB–binding site in USP7, ubiquitin-like domain 2, that selectively mediates interactions of USP7 with NF-ĸB subunits but is dispensable for interactions with other proteins. Moreover, we found that the amino acids 757LDEL760 in USP7 critically contribute to the interaction with the p65 subunit of NF-ĸB.

As a consequence, NF-ĸB is critically important for the transcriptional response to infection and the development of immunity, and at least 500 genes are direct transcriptional targets of NF-κB including cytokines, chemokines, regulators of antigen presentation and cell adhesion, as well as genes that control cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation (1Mitchell J.P. Carmody R.J. NF-κB and the transcriptional control of inflammation.Int. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2018; 335 (29305014): 41-8410.1016/bs.ircmb.2017.07.007Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The functional nature of these transcriptional targets makes NF-κB a central factor in the pathology of a number of important human diseases including chronic inflammatory disease (e.g. arthritis, autoimmunity), atherosclerosis, cancer, and neurodegeneration (1Mitchell J.P. Carmody R.J. NF-κB and the transcriptional control of inflammation.Int. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2018; 335 (29305014): 41-8410.1016/bs.ircmb.2017.07.007Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In many of these diseases NF-ĸB is inappropriately activated or active at elevated levels, establishing it as a factor with significant therapeutic potential. NF-ĸB is in fact a family of transcription factors formed by the dimerization of five subunits; RelA (p65), c-Rel, RelB, p50, and p52. In resting cells, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm through interaction with the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) proteins, of which IκBα is the archetypal member. Activation of the IĸB kinase (IKK) complex (which contains the IKKα and IKKβ kinases and the scaffold protein NEMO) leads to IκBα degradation and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Once in the nucleus, NF-κB binds to specific DNA sequences (ĸB sites) to promote transcription (1Mitchell J.P. Carmody R.J. NF-κB and the transcriptional control of inflammation.Int. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2018; 335 (29305014): 41-8410.1016/bs.ircmb.2017.07.007Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The primary mechanism for terminating NF-κB activity is a negative feedback loop involving NF-κB–directed resynthesis of IκBα, which relocates NF-κB from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. There is also a critical IκBα-independent mechanism to limit NF-κB activity that requires the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NF-κB itself (2Saccani S. Marazzi I. Beg A.A. Natoli G. Degradation of promoter-bound p65/RelA is essential for the prompt termination of the nuclear factor κB response.J. Exp.

Ubiquitination of NF-κB occurs in the nucleus and depends on the binding of NF-κB to DNA (2Saccani S. Marazzi I. Beg A.A. Natoli G. Degradation of promoter-bound p65/RelA is essential for the prompt termination of the nuclear factor κB response.J. Exp.

NF-κB ubiquitination is predominantly composed of K48-linked polyubiquitin chains that trigger proteasomal mediated degradation, leading to reduced NF-κB promoter occupancy and inhibition of transcription (4Collins P.E. Mitxitorena I. Carmody R.J. The ubiquitination of NF-κB subunits in the control of transcription.Cells. 2016; 5 (27187478): 2310.3390/cells5020023Crossref Google Scholar). The ubiquitination of NF-ĸB with nondegradative ubiquitin linkages has also been described (6Li H. Wittwer T. Weber A. Schneider H. Moreno R. Maine G.N. Kracht M. Schmitz M.L. Burstein E.

At least six different E3 ligases for NF-κB have been identified that appear to regulate NF-κB transcriptional activity in a gene selective manner (4Collins P.E. Mitxitorena I. Carmody R.J.

The apparent nonredundant roles for these E3 ligases in the regulation of NF-ĸB suggest a complex mechanism for the control of NF-ĸB transcriptional activity by ubiquitination, which remains largely undefined. The importance of ubiquitination in regulating NF-ĸB transcriptional activity was fully recognized following the identification of USP7 (ubiquitin-specific protease 7) as a deubiquitinase of NF-κB (13Colleran A. Collins P.E. O'Carroll C. Ahmed A. Mao X. McManus B. Kiely P.A. Burstein E. Carmody R.J. Deubiquitination of NF-κB by ubiquitin-specific protease-7 promotes transcription.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110 (23267096): 618-62310.1073/pnas.1208446110Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). USP7 directly counteracts the activity of E3 ligases by removing polyubiquitin chains from NF-κB, thereby stabilizing NF-ĸB and promoting the transcription of target genes (13Colleran A. Collins P.E. O'Carroll C. Ahmed A. Mao X. McManus B. Kiely P.A. Burstein E. Carmody R.J. Deubiquitination of NF-κB by ubiquitin-specific protease-7 promotes transcription.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110 (23267096): 618-62310.1073/pnas.1208446110Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Blocking USP7-mediated deubiquitination of NF-ĸB inhibits NF-ĸB transcriptional activity while inhibiting the E3 ligases of NF-ĸB or the proteasome leads to increased transcription of NF-ĸB target genes (4Collins P.E. Mitxitorena I. Carmody R.J. The ubiquitination of NF-κB subunits in the control of transcription.Cells. 2016; 5 (27187478): 2310.3390/cells5020023Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, the transcriptional activity of NF-κB is determined by a balance of ubiquitination and deubiquitination. E3 ligases and USP7 target DNA-bound, transcriptionally active NF-κB and do not control the upstream activation of NF-ĸB. As such, the ubiquitination of NF-ĸB represents an unexploited avenue for the therapeutic control of inflammatory disease. We previously demonstrated that the inhibition of USP7 leads to the inhibition of NF-ĸB directed transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Il1b, Tnf, and Il6, identifying USP7 as a potential therapeutic target in inflammatory disease (13Colleran A. Collins P.E. O'Carroll C. Ahmed A. Mao X. McManus B. Kiely P.A. Burstein E. Carmody R.J. Deubiquitination of NF-κB by ubiquitin-specific protease-7 promotes transcription.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, USP7 deubiquitinates a growing number of substrate proteins, many with important roles in the regulation of key cellular processes such as cell cycle, differentiation, apoptosis, DNA replication, and transcription (14Pozhidaeva A. Bezsonova I. USP7: Structure, substrate specificity, and inhibition.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2019; 76 (30807924): 30-3910.1016/j.dnarep.2019.02.005Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 15Rawat R. Starczynowski D.T. Ntziachristos P. Nuclear deubiquitination in the spotlight: the multifaceted nature of USP7 biology in disease.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2019; 58 (30897496): 85-9410.1016/j.ceb.2019.02.008Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Indeed, the importance of two USP7 substrates in cancer, p53 and MDM2, has led to significant efforts to develop USP7 inhibitors. The currently available small molecule inhibitors of USP7 target the catalytic activity of USP7 and thus inhibit the activity of USP7 against all its substrates including p53, MDM2, and NF-ĸB (16Bhattacharya S. Chakraborty D. Basu M. Ghosh M.K. Emerging insights into HAUSP (USP7) in physiology, cancer and other diseases.Signal. Transduct. Target Ther. 2018; 3 (29967688): 1710.1038/s41392-018-0012-yCrossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although the impact of USP7 inhibitors on both cell survival (NF-ĸB) and cell death (p53/MDM2) pathways is desirable in the context of cancer therapy, such broad activity is unlikely to be beneficial in an anti-inflammatory agent. In this study, we map the regions of USP7 involved in the interaction with the p65 (RelA) subunit of NF-ĸB, using peptide array technology, molecular modeling, and mutagenesis approaches. We identify the ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain 2 of USP7 as critical for the interaction and deubiquitination of p65 but dispensable for the interaction of USP7 with the USP7 substrates p53, DAXX, and EBNA1. The Ubl2 domain of USP7 is also required for interaction with the c-Rel subunit but not the RelB subunit of NF-ĸB. Of note, we find the Ubl2 domain of USP7 is not required for USP7-mediated deubiquitination of RelB. The findings described here suggest that targeting noncatalytic domains of USP7 may enable substrate-selective inhibition of USP7 activity. Toward this goal we further describe a p65-binding site in the Ubl2 domain of USP7 that may facilitate the selective inhibition of USP7-mediated deubiquitination of p65. We have previously demonstrated that USP7 deubiquitinates NF-ĸB p65 to promote NF-ĸB transcriptional responses induced by tumor necrosis factor α and TLR ligands (13Colleran A. Collins P.E. O'Carroll C. Ahmed A. Mao X. McManus B. Kiely P.A. Burstein E. Carmody R.J. Deubiquitination of NF-κB by ubiquitin-specific protease-7 promotes transcription.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110 (23267096): 618-62310.1073/pnas.1208446110Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Our earlier studies showed that inhibition of USP7 by the small molecule inhibitor HBX41,108 or siRNA knockdown blocked the expression of key inflammatory cytokines including Tnf and Il6 (13). To further characterize the impact of USP7 inhibition on TLR-induced transcriptional responses, we performed a microarray-based transcriptomic analysis of murine bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMs) stimulated with the TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence or absence of the USP7 inhibitor HBX41,108 (17Colland F. Formstecher E. Jacq X. Reverdy C. Planquette C. Conrath S. Trouplin V. Bianchi J. Aushev V.N. Camonis J. Calabrese A. Borg-Capra C. Sippl W. Collura V. Boissy G. et al.Small-molecule inhibitor of USP7/HAUSP ubiquitin protease stabilizes and activates p53 in cells.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2009; 8 (19671755): 2286-229510.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0097Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Hierarchical clustering analysis of LPS-induced genes demonstrated that the USP7 inhibitor reduced the expression of a significant number of TLR-inducible genes in macrophages (Fig. 1A), including the NF-ĸB target genes encoding inflammatory cytokines Tnf, Il6, Il1b, and Il12b (Fig. 1B). To further investigate the impact of USP7 inhibition on NF-ĸB–mediated TLR-induced transcriptional responses, we next analyzed the promoter sequences of genes inhibited by USP7 inhibitor treatment for the enrichment of transcription factor–binding sites. This analysis revealed a significant over-representation of NF-κB–binding sites in TLR-inducible genes inhibited by USP7 inhibitor treatment (Fig. 1C). These promoter regions were also enriched in binding sites for PU.1 and interferon response factors, transcription factors that cooperate with NF-ĸB to promote the expression of pro-inflammatory genes (Table S1). These data demonstrate that USP7 inhibition is an effective approach to block NF-ĸB–mediated inflammatory responses. However, the expanding list of identified USP7 substrates means that the inhibition of UPS7 catalytic activity will not achieve a selective effect on NF-ĸB activity. Instead, strategies that inhibit USP7 activity in a substrate-specific manner are required, which necessitates a detailed analysis of the recognition of p65 by USP7. Our previous studies revealed that the C-terminal region of USP7, containing five Ubl domains, is essential for interaction with p65, whereas the N-terminal MATH domain is dispensable (13Colleran A. Collins P.E. O'Carroll C. Ahmed A. Mao X. McManus B. Kiely P.A. Burstein E. Carmody R.J. Deubiquitination of NF-κB by ubiquitin-specific protease-7 promotes transcription.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110 (23267096): 618-62310.1073/pnas.1208446110Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). To further define the C-terminal regions of USP7 that mediate interaction with p65, we next assessed the contribution of specific Ubl domains of USP7. To do this, we generated a series of USP7 mutants in which each of the five Ubl domains were deleted either individually or in combination (Fig. 2B). Immunoprecipitation assays using whole cell lysates from cells co-transfected with p65 revealed that the Ubl5, Ubl4, and Ubl3 domains of USP7 were dispensable for interaction with p65. Thus, the deletion of Ubl5, Ubl4, and Ubl3 either individually or together did not prevent the interaction of USP7 with p65 (Fig. 2, C and D). Deletion or mutation of the linker region between Ubl3 and Ubl4 also did not prevent interaction with p65 (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, the deletion of Ubl1 did not inhibit USP7 interaction with p65 (Fig. 2F). However, deletion of Ubl2, either alone or in combination with the deletion of Ubl3, Ubl4, and Ubl5, prevented the interaction of USP7 with p65 (Fig. 2, C and F). These data demonstrate that the Ubl2 domain of USP7 is essential for the interaction with p65. To determine the contribution of the Ubl2 domain to the interaction of USP7 with other substrates, we next assessed USP7 binding to selected substrates by immunoprecipitation assays using cells transfected with a mutant of USP7 lacking Ubl2 (USP7ΔUbl2). The results of these experiments demonstrated that the deletion of Ubl2 did not inhibit the interaction of USP7 with p53 or EBNA1 (Fig. 3, A and B). These findings support previous studies indicating that the N-terminal MATH domain of USP7 mediates interaction with p53 and EBNA1 (18Holowaty M.N. Sheng Y. Nguyen T. Arrowsmith C. Frappier L. Protein interaction domains of the ubiquitin-specific protease, USP7/HAUSP.J. Biol.

We also tested the ability of USP7ΔUbl2 to interact with DAXX, a substrate for which the contribution of the C-terminal of USP7 to the interaction is unknown (20Tang J. Qu L. Pang M. Yang X. Daxx is reciprocally regulated by Mdm2 and Hausp.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 393 (20153724): 542-54510.1016/j.bbrc.2010.02.051Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Similar to p53 and EBNA1, immunoprecipitation experiments using cells co-transfected with DAXX and USP7ΔUbl2 revealed that the deletion of Ubl2 did not affect the interaction of USP7 and DAXX (Fig. 3C). In similar experiments, we also tested the requirement for Ubl2 in the interaction of USP7 with the NF-ĸB subunits c-Rel and RelB, which share significant sequence and structural homology with p65. This revealed that, similar to p65, the interaction of c-Rel with USP7 requires the Ubl2 domain of USP7 (Fig. 3D). Remarkably, however, and in contrast to c-Rel and p65, the deletion of Ubl2 did not inhibit the interaction of USP7 with RelB (Fig. 3E). These data demonstrate that the Ubl2 domain of USP7 is selectively required for the interaction of USP7 with its substrates, including among homologous members of the NF-ĸB family of transcription factors. We previously demonstrated that p65 is a direct substrate of USP7 and that interaction of p65 with USP7 is required for USP7-mediated deubiquitination of p65 (13Colleran A. Collins P.E. O'Carroll C. Ahmed A. Mao X. McManus B. Kiely P.A. Burstein E. Carmody R.J. Deubiquitination of NF-κB by ubiquitin-specific protease-7 promotes transcription.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110 (23267096): 618-62310.1073/pnas.1208446110Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We next tested the ability of USP7ΔUbl2 to deubiquitinate p65 and RelB in an in-cell ubiquitination assay. The cells were transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin, WT USP7 or USP7ΔUbl2, and RelB or p65. Following denaturing lysis, RelB or p65 were immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody. This analysis revealed that WT USP7 but not USP7ΔUBL2 deubiquitinated p65 (Fig. 4A), consistent with the inability of USP7ΔUbl2 to interact with p65 (Fig. 3). In contrast, both WT USP7 and USP7ΔUbl2 were able to deubiquitinate RelB, demonstrating that Ubl2 is dispensable for USP7 interaction with and deubiquitination of RelB (Fig. 4B). Following the identification of the Ubl2 domain as essential for the interaction of USP7 with p65, we next sought to further define the specific regions of USP7 that mediate interaction with p65. To do this we employed a peptide array–based approach in which an immobilized peptide library representing the C-terminal region of USP7 was probed with purified recombinant GSH S-transferase (GST)–p65 protein. Specifically, a library of overlapping peptides 18 amino acids in length representing the C-terminal region of USP7 (amino acids 541–1102) was synthetic peptide arrays on membrane support (SPOT)–synthesized on nitrocellulose membranes to generate USP7 C-terminal arrays (Fig. 5A). The peptide arrays were overlaid with purified recombinant GST or GST-p65 protein, and interaction with specific peptides was detected using anti-GST antibody as previously described (21Collins P.E. Kiely P.A. Carmody R.J. Inhibition of transcription by B cell leukemia 3 (Bcl-3) protein requires interaction with nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) p50.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 (24459141): 7059-706710.1074/jbc.M114.551986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed a distinct set of peptides that interacted strongly with GST-p65 but not GST. These peptides corresponded to sequences in each of the Ubl1, Ubl2, Ubl3, Ubl4, and Ubl5 domains of USP7, indicating potentially broad contacts with p65 across the C-terminal of USP7 (Fig. 5, B and C). To identify specific amino acids within the identified regions of USP7 that may be important for interaction with p65, we next generated alanine-scanning arrays of selected peptides representing each Ubl domain and the C-terminal peptide region (Fig. 5A). The peptides in these arrays were modified such that successive amino acids were individually substituted with alanine and differed from the parent peptide by one amino acid. As before, peptide arrays were incubated with GST-p65, and binding was calculated with respect to the unmodified parent peptide contained on the same array. Substitutions with less than 60% binding of the parent peptide were considered as important amino acids for mediating the interaction of the peptide with p65. These data identified individual amino acids in each peptide that were required for interaction with p65. Of note, the individual substitution of four consecutive amino acids (LDEL) in a peptide representing amino acids 753–770 (753LDKALDELMDGDIIVFQK770) within the Ubl2 domain of USP7 blocked interaction with p65 (Fig. 6A). This identified the 757LDEL760 motif of USP7 as a potential binding site for p65. In addition, the alanine substitution of individual amino acids in peptides representing regions of USP7 in the other Ubl domains of the C-terminal protein region were also found to inhibit interaction with p65 (Fig. 6, A and B). This included a large number of amino acids in peptides corresponding to the Ubl3 domain, as well as the C-terminal peptide region. Although the data from experiments using USP7 mutants lacking individual Ubl domains showed that these domains are not essential for the interaction of USP7 with p65 (Fig. 3), it is possible that potential sites of interaction in these domains may also contribute to the interaction with p65, perhaps through stabilization of already bound p65. The alanine-scanning peptide array analysis identified USP7 amino acids Lys757, Asp758, Glu759, and Lys760 (757LDEL760) as residues that may mediate interaction of USP7 with p65. To investigate this we mutated these amino acids in USP7 and assessed the binding to p65 using immunoprecipitation assays. The cells were co-transfected with p65 and WT USP7 or a L757A, D758R, E759R, and L760A USP7 mutant, prior to immunoprecipitation using anti-p65 antibody and subsequent analysis by immunoblotting. The results of these experiments revealed that the mutation of Lys757, Asp758, Glu759, and Lys760 of USP7 significantly reduced interaction with p65 (Fig. 6A). Thus, these data identify a p65-binding site involving residues 757–760 of USP7 that mediates the selective binding to p65. The importance of NF-ĸB in the regulation of pro-inflammatory gene expression has established it as a therapeutic target of significant potential (22Herrington F.D. Carmody R.J. Goodyear C.S. Modulation of NF-κB signaling as a therapeutic target in autoimmunity.J. Biomol. Screen. 2016; 21 (26597958): 223-24210.1177/1087057115617456Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Previous strategies to inhibit NF-ĸB function focused largely on the development of inhibitors of the IKK kinases, key activators of the NF-ĸB pathway. Although the development of selective inhibitors of the IKK kinases was successful, their therapeutic use was precluded because of severe toxicity in early trials, possibly arising from the NF-ĸB–independent functions of the IKK kinases (23Chariot A. The NF-κB–independent functions of IKK subunits in immunity and cancer.Trends Cell. Biol. 2009; 19 (19648011): 404-41310.1016/j.tcb.2009.05.006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Thus, the therapeutic potential of the NF-ĸB pathway remains untapped, and alternative approaches beyond inhibiting the IKK kinases are required. The ubiquitin-triggered proteasomal degradation of the NF-ĸB subunits is an important mechanism for the termination of NF-ĸB transcriptional activity (13Colleran A. Collins P.E. O'Carroll C. Ahmed A. Mao X. McManus B. Kiely P.A. Burstein E. Carmody R.J. Deubiquitination of NF-κB by ubiquitin-specific protease-7 promotes transcription.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The level of NF-ĸB–directed pro-inflammatory gene transcription is dictated by the balance between the action of NF-ĸB E3 ligases and the NF-ĸB deubiquitinase USP7. The inhibition of USP7 leads to enhanced ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NF-ĸB p65, resulting in the inhibition of pro-inflammatory gene expression (13Colleran A. Collins P.E.

Here, we have performed the first transcriptomic analysis of the consequences of USP7 inhibition in macrophages stimulated with the TLR4 ligand LPS. This analysis reveals a significant and selective inhibition of NF-ĸB target gene expression following TLR4 activation and strongly supports the inhibition of USP7 deubiquitination of NF-ĸB as a potential therapeutic strategy. Although the importance of USP7 in promoting NF-ĸB–mediated inflammatory responses is clear (13Colleran A. Collins P.E. O'Carroll C. Ahmed A. Mao X. McManus B. Kiely P.A. Burstein E. Carmody R.J. Deubiquitination of NF-κB by ubiquitin-specific protease-7 promotes transcription.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This is because, like the IKK kinases, USP7 has numerous substrates with important roles in a broad range of cellular processes, including cell cycle, DNA damage repair, and cell death. Instead, the therapeutic exploitation of USP7 control of NF-ĸB will require a substrate-selective approach. The data in this study represent a first step toward this goal. A p65 mutant that does not bind USP7 is hyperubiquitinated, has a shorter t1/2, and has significantly reduced transcriptional activity (13Colleran A. Collins P.E. O'Carroll C. Ahmed A. Mao X. McManus B. Kiely P.A. Burstein E. Carmody R.J. Deubiquitination of NF-κB by ubiquitin-specific protease-7 promotes transcription.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Thus, interfering with USP7 and p65 interaction can achieve a substrate-selective inhibition of UPS7 mediated activity to inhibit the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Our previous work identified the C-terminal domain of USP7 as a critical region required for interaction with p65 (13Colleran A. Collins P.E. O'Carroll C. Ahmed A. Mao X. McManus B. Kiely P.A. Burstein E. Carmody R.J. Deubiquitination of NF-κB by ubiquitin-specific protease-7 promotes transcription.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In this study, we have further defined the Ubl2 domain of USP7 as essential for the interaction of USP7 with p65. In addition, we find that the Ubl2 domain is also essential for the interaction of USP7 with the c-Rel subunit of NF-ĸB but not the closely related RelB subunit. The finding that different domains of USP7 are important for the recognition of related substrates such as the NF-ĸB subunits is unexpected and suggests that substrate recognition by USP7 likely occurs through diverse interfaces, even among structurally related proteins. Of note, our data also show that the Ubl2 domain of USP7 is not required for the deubiquitination of RelB by USP7, suggesting that the Ubl2 domain functions primarily in substrate recognition rather than contributing to catalytic activity. Previous studies have shown the Ubl2 domain to be important for USP7 interaction with ICP0, UHRF1, and DHX40 (18Holowaty M.N. Sheng Y. Nguyen T. Arrowsmith C. Frappier L. Protein interaction domains of the ubiquitin-specific protease, USP7/HAUSP.J. Biol.

Wani G. Wani A.A.

A number of USP7 substrates do not require the C-terminal of USP7 for interaction, including MDM2, p53, and EBNA1 (18). Indeed, a recent proteomics-based screen to identify USP7-interacting proteins revealed that most interactions analyzed occurred through the N-terminal MATH domain of USP7 (25Georges A. Marcon E. Greenblatt J. Frappier L. Identification and characterization of USP7 targets in cancer cells.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 (30367141): 1583310.1038/s41598-018-34197-xCrossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Together with this study, these data indicate that targeting USP7–substrate interactions may allow for the selective inhibition of USP7 activity. Within the Ubl2 domain, we have identified the amino acids 757LDEL760 as important contributors to the interaction with p65. These residues may form part of a p65-binding pocket within the Ubl2 of USP7 that is important for the interaction with p65. This binding site is adjacent to, but distinct from, a binding site for UHRF1, IPC0, and GMPS formed by amino acids 761MDGD764. These studies, together with the data presented here, suggest that targeting the p65-specific binding site in USP7 may allow for the inhibition of p65 deubiquitination, leading to increased proteasomal degradation and reduced transcriptional activity, without broadly affecting the activity of USP7 toward all substrates. Similar approaches to mapping other substrate interaction sites of USP7 may lead to the identification of additional binding pockets that may be selectively targeted to achieve substrate-selective inhibition of USP7-mediated deubiquitination. Such an understanding of USP7 substrate interaction may facilitate the selective targeting of difficult to drug proteins such as NF-ĸB and other transcription factors. Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells were cultured in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Murine BMDMs were generated as previously described (5Carmody R.J. Ruan Q. Palmer S. Hilliard B. Chen Y.H. Negative regulation of toll-like receptor signaling by NF-κB p50 ubiquitination blockade.Science. 2007; 317 (17673665): 675-67810.1126/science.1142953Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Briefly, bone marrow was isolated from age- and sex-matched C57BL6/J mice at 8–12 weeks old and cultured in bacterial Petri dishes with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin supplemented with 30% L929 conditioned medium for 7 days, with medium replacement after 4 days. On day 7, BMDMs were harvested in PBS solution supplemented with 5 mm EDTA and replated into tissue culture–treated dishes in DMEM without L929 conditioned medium. They were rested overnight, and the experiments were performed on day 8. The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified environment with 5% CO2. These experiments were carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the Code of Practice for the Humane Killing of Animals under Schedule 1 to the United Kingdom Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, where excess tissue was used for isolation of bone marrow cells. Transfections were performed using Turbofect transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Fermentas). Mammalian expression vectors for USP7, p65, c-Rel, RelB, and DAXX were generated following PCR amplification and ligation of cDNAs into the pcDNA-FLAG or pRK5-FLAG vectors. MSCV-N EBNA1 was a gift from Karl Munger (Addgene plasmid 37954). pCMV-p53 plasmid was purchased from Clontech. pET-42a-GST-p65 plasmid was generated by gene synthesis (GenScript). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Q5 site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) with DNase treatment. RNA quantification and purity were measured using the Nanodrop ND1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific), with samples submitted for microarray profiling (Beckman Coulter Genomics, Morrisville, NC). Briefly, 200 ng of total RNA was fluorescently labeled with Cy3 nucleotides. Labeled RNA (cRNA) was hybridized to Agilent mouse 8X60K mouse microarrays (Agilent-028005). Hybridized arrays were washed and scanned, with data extrapolated for downstream bioinformatics analysis. Microarray gene-expression profiling was performed in duplicate. The data were normalized using Limma (3.38.3), including quantile normalization (27Ritchie M.E. Phipson B. Wu D. Hu Y. Law C.W. Shi W.

A linear model was fitted to identify differentially expressed probes using an adjusted p value (Benjamini and Hochberg) of 0.05. The data are available at the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE149478). Transcription factor–binding site analysis was performed using HOMER (RRID:SCR_010881). For purification of recombinant GST-p65, Escherichia coli BL21 DE3 (Agilent Technologies) were transformed with pET-42a-GST-p65. The cultures were induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside and incubated for 3 h with shaking (150 rpm) at 37 °C. The bacteria were resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm DTT, disrupted by sonication, and centrifuged to remove debris. GST-p65 was purified using GSH–agarose (Sigma) and eluted in buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 10 mm DTT, and 10 mm reduced GSH (Promega). Peptide libraries of USP7 were generated by automatic SPOT synthesis as previously described (21Collins P.E. Kiely P.A. Carmody R.J.

The interaction of GST and GST-p65 proteins with the peptide array was investigated by overlaying the peptide array membrane with 10 μg/ml of each protein overnight at 4 °C. Bound GST-p65 was measured by immunoblotting with anti-GST antibody (Sigma) and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody (GE Healthcare) prior to enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection. Specific alanine-scanning arrays were generated using the same procedure, and bound protein was detected and quantified using a digital chemiluminescence scanner (LiCor). For Western blotting analysis, whole cell lysates were prepared from cells suspended in radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1–1% Igepal, 0.25% deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 µg/ml pepstatin, and 1 µg/ml leupeptin. Lysates were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose, and membranes were immunoblotted with specific antibodies. Anti-p65 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (sc-80089 and sc-372) and Bethyl Laboratories (A301-824A); anti-USP7 was obtained from Bethyl Laboratories (A300-033A); and Santa Cruz Biotechnologies provided anti-p53 (sc-6243), anti-HA (sc-805), anti-c-Rel (sc-71), anti-DAXX (sc-7152), and anti-RelB (sc-226) antibodies. Anti-FLAG (F1804), anti-GST (G7781), and anti–β-actin (SAB 1305567) antibodies were supplied by Sigma. For immunoprecipitation, equal amounts of whole cell extracts were precleared for 30 min at 4 °C with protein G–agarose beads (Millipore) and immunoprecipitated with specific antibody overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times in RIPA buffer and eluted by boiling in 2× sample buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 200 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Equal volumes of eluted immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting. Ubiquitination assays were carried out as previously described (5Carmody R.J. Ruan Q. Palmer S. Hilliard B. Chen Y.H. Negative regulation of toll-like receptor signaling by NF-κB p50 ubiquitination blockade.Science. 2007; 317 (17673665): 675-67810.1126/science.1142953Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were incubated with 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide for 30 s and washed in PBS supplemented with 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide. The cells were lysed in 1% SDS, boiled for 5 min, and sonicated. Cleared lysates were diluted 1:10 in RIPA buffer supplemented with 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide. Immunoprecipitation was performed as above and analyzed by Western blotting to detect ubiquitinated protein.

https://openalex.org/W3037277062,"Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, tuberculosis (TB) is still a serious health threat. Mortality is even higher in people living with HIV who are diagnosed with TB. New therapies are needed to shorten the time required to cure TB and decrease fatality rates in this population. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a glutathione precursor and has shown recently in experimental setting to present in vitro and in vivo anti-mycobacterial activity. We test the hypothesis that NAC is safe, well tolerated and secondarily efficacious as adjunctive anti-TB therapy in hospitalized individuals with HIV-associated TB. Patients were enrolled sequentially in a tertiary care center, in the Brazilian Amazon. We performed a randomized, parallel group, single-center, open study trial of two arms, in hospitalized patients over 18 years of age, with microbiologically confirmed pulmonary TB in HIV: one with rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol at standard doses (Control Group), and a second in which NAC 600 mg bid for eight weeks was added (NAC Group). A total of 21 and 18 patients were enrolled to the Control Group and NAC Group, respectively. Adverse event rates were similar in the two arms. Our findings suggest that in the more critical population of hospitalized patients with HIV-associated TB, the use of NAC was not unsafe, despite the low sample size, and a potential impact on faster negative cultures needs to be further explored in larger studies."
https://openalex.org/W3037126969,"Menstrual blood is not just a physical substance; it is laden with symbolism and often powerfully stigmatised. It is important to understand local perceptions and attitudes towards menstrual blood, as well as the preferred practices of menstruating women, in order to design appropriate sanitation and solid waste systems to support menstruation. Failure to take account of socio-cultural factors can jeopardise the effectiveness of such infrastructure. This study, conducted in Blantyre, Malawi, is a qualitative socio-cultural examination of how women manage and view menstruation. Thirty nine interviews, conducted with individuals and with small groups of friends, were carried out with thirty one women using pit latrines, flush toilets, and urine-diverting dry toilets in early 2019. Menstruation in Blantyre was found to be shrouded in secrecy because it was viewed as ‘dirty’, and therefore remained concealed. There was widespread anxiety about menstrual blood being used in ufiti (witchcraft), which affected how women used and disposed of their menstrual absorbents. At the same time, menstrual blood was also viewed as a powerful healing substance with uses in traditional medicine. The type of infrastructure required by women to support their menstruation depended on the type of menstrual absorbent used. Those using reusable cloth generally preferred a private bathroom with discreet drainage, whilst those using disposable pads needed a discreet and convenient disposal system. Increased preference for disposable pads over reusable cloth (particularly for younger women in education or employment) suggested that menstrual waste profiles of urban areas may be changing. Understanding these changing needs will be crucial for planning effective, sustainable waste disposal and sanitation infrastructure."
https://openalex.org/W3037139218,"Abstract As the catalog of oncogenic driver mutations is expanding, it becomes clear that alterations in a given gene might have different functions and should not be lumped into one class. The transcription factor GATA3 is a paradigm of this. We investigated the functions of the most common GATA3 mutation (X308_Splice) and five additional mutations, which converge into a neoprotein that we called “neoGATA3,” associated with excellent prognosis in patients. Analysis of available molecular data from &gt;3000 breast cancer patients revealed a dysregulation of the ER-dependent transcriptional response in tumors carrying neoGATA3-generating mutations. Mechanistic studies in vitro showed that neoGATA3 interferes with the transcriptional programs controlled by estrogen and progesterone receptors, without fully abrogating them. ChIP-Seq analysis indicated that ER binding is reduced in neoGATA3-expressing cells, especially at distal regions, suggesting that neoGATA3 interferes with the fine tuning of ER-dependent gene expression. This has opposite outputs in distinct hormonal context, having pro- or anti-proliferative effects, depending on the estrogen/progesterone ratio. Our data call for functional analyses of putative cancer drivers to guide clinical application."
https://openalex.org/W3037432125,"To unravel the virome in birch trees of German and Finnish origin exhibiting symptoms of birch leaf-roll disease (BRLD), high-throughput sequencing (HTS) was employed. In total five viruses, among which three were so far unknown, were detected by RNAseq. One to five virus variants were identified in the transcriptome of individual trees. The novel viruses were genetically—fully or partially—characterized, belonging to the genera Carlavirus, Idaeovirus and Capillovirus and are tentatively named birch carlavirus, birch idaeovirus, and birch capillovirus, respectively. The recently discovered birch leafroll-associated virus was systematically detected by HTS in symptomatic seedlings but not in symptomless ones. The new carlavirus was detected only in one of the three symptomatic seedlings. The novel putative Capillovirus was detected in all seedlings—irrespective of their BLRD status—while the Idaeovirus was identified in a plant without leaf symptoms at the time of sampling. Further efforts are needed to complete Koch’s postulates and to clarify the possible association of the detected viruses with the BLR disease. Our study elucidates the viral population in single birch seedlings and provides a comprehensive overview for the diversities of the viral communities they harbor, to date."
https://openalex.org/W3037392275,"Segmentation of a natural scene into objects and background is a fundamental but challenging task for recognizing objects. Investigating intermediate-level visual cortical areas with a focus on local information is a crucial step towards understanding the formation of the cortical representations of figure and ground. We examined the activity of a population of macaque V4 neurons during the presentation of natural image patches and their respective variations. The natural image patches were optimized to exclude the influence of global context but included various characteristics of local stimulus. Around one fourth of the patch-responsive V4 neurons exhibited significant modulation of firing activity that was dependent on the positional relation between the figural region of the stimulus and the classical receptive field of the neuron. However, the individual neurons showed low consistency in figure-ground modulation across a variety of image patches (55–62%), indicating that individual neurons were capable of correctly signaling figure and ground only for a limited number of stimuli. We examined whether integration of the activity of multiple neurons enabled higher consistency across a variety of natural patches by training a support vector machine to classify figure and ground of the stimuli from the population firing activity. The integration of the activity of a few tens of neurons yielded discrimination accuracy much greater than that of single neurons (up to 85%), suggesting a crucial role of population coding for figure-ground discrimination in natural images."
https://openalex.org/W3037313330,"p120-catenin is considered to be a tumor suppressor because it stabilizes E-cadherin levels at the cell surface. p120-catenin phosphorylation is increased in several types of cancer, but the role of phosphorylation in cancer is unknown. The phosphorylation state of p120-catenin is important in controlling E-cadherin homophilic binding strength which maintains epithelial junctions. Because decreased cell-cell adhesion is associated with increased cancer metastasis we hypothesize that p120-catenin phosphorylation at specific Serine and Threonine residues alters the E-cadherin binding strength between tumor cells and thereby affect the ability of tumor cells to leave the primary tumor and metastasize to distant sites. In this study we show that expression of the p120-catenin phosphorylation dead mutant, by converting six Serine and Threonine sites to Alanine, leads to enhanced E-cadherin adhesive binding strength in tumor cells. We observed a decrease in the ability of tumor cells expressing the p120-catenin phosphorylation mutant to migrate and invade using in-vitro models of cancer progression. Further, tumor cells expressing the phosphorylation mutant form of p120-catenin demonstrated a decrease in ability to metastasize to the lungs using an in-vivo orthotopic mammary fat pad injection model of breast cancer development and metastasis. This suggests that regulation of p120-catenin phosphorylation at the cell surface is important in mediating cell-adhesion, thereby impacting cancer progression and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W3037335558,"The aim of this study was to assess the association between anxiety and depression with physical and sensory functional difficulties, among adults living in five low and middle-income countries (LMICs).A secondary data analysis was undertaken using population-based disability survey data from five LMICs, including two national surveys (Guatemala, Maldives) and 3 regional/district surveys (Nepal, India, Cameroon). 19,337 participants were sampled in total (range 1,617-7,604 in individual studies). Anxiety, depression, and physical and sensory functional difficulties were assessed using the Washington Group Extended Question Set on Functioning. Age-sex adjusted logistic regression analyses were undertaken to assess the association of anxiety and depression with hearing, visual or mobility functional difficulties. The findings demonstrated an increased adjusted odds of severe depression and severe anxiety among adults with mobility, hearing and visual functional difficulties in all settings (with ORs ranging from 2.0 to 14.2) except for in relation to hearing loss in India, the Maldives and Cameroon, where no clear association was found. For all settings and types of functional difficulties, there was a stronger association with severe anxiety and depression than with moderate. Both India and Cameroon had higher reported prevalences of physical and sensory functional difficulties compared with Nepal and Guatemala, and weaker associations with anxiety and depression.People with physical and sensory functional difficulties are more likely to report experiencing depression and anxiety. This evidence supports the need for ensuring a good awareness of mental health among those working with individuals with physical and sensory functional difficulties in LMICs. This implies that these practitioners must have the skills to identify anxiety and depression. Furthermore, mental health services must be available and accessible to patients with these conditions, which will likely require further programmatic scale-up in these LMIC settings."
https://openalex.org/W3037425343,"Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections remain the most common neglected tropical diseases among children living mainly in low-resource settings. Preventive chemotherapy (PC) has been implemented as one of the main public health interventions to control and eliminate STH infections. Although data on routine coverage of PC against STH are available at different level of the health system; these data are unreliable as they are subject to errors and manipulation and evidence is lacking on validated treatment coverage. Thus, this study aimed to determine anthelminthic coverage among school age children (SAC) to inform decision made in PC program implementation.We conducted a community-based cross-sectional coverage survey in ten districts of Ethiopia; in April 2019. Sample size was computed automatically using Coverage Survey Builder (CSB) tool in Microsoft excel. Thirty segments were randomly selected per each selected districts. Collected data were cleaned and analysed using SPSS software (IBM, version 25).In all, 8154 SAC participated in the study. The overall anthelminthic coverage was found to be 71% (95%confidence interval (CI) = 70-71.9%). The reported coverage was lower than the surveyed coverage only in Guagusa district. The PC coverage among males (71.9%) was slightly higher than females' coverage (70%); and the coverage in the age group between10 and 14 years (77%) was higher compared with the age group between 5 and 9 years (64.3%). In addition, the PC coverage in school attending children (81.1%) was much higher than coverage in non-enrolled children (28.3%). Moreover, the most frequently mentioned reasons for not swallowing drugs were drug not given (24.75%) and not attending school (19.75%).This study showed that only five out of ten districts met the target threshold (minimum 75%) for effective coverage. Hence, implementations of preventive chemotherapy should be improved in those districts with low coverage data."

Recent detection of D. citri in Africa and reports of Las-associated HLB in Ethiopia suggest that the citrus industry on the continent is under imminent threat. Endosymbionts and gut bacteria play key roles in the biology of arthropods, especially with regards to vector-pathogen interactions and resistance to antibiotics. Thus, we aim to profile the bacterial genera and to identify antibiotic resistance genes within the microbiome of different populations worldwide of D. citri. The metagenome of D. citri was sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore full-length 16S metagenomics protocol, and the ""What's in my pot"" (WIMP) analysis pipeline. Microbial diversity within and between D. citri populations was assessed, and antibiotic resistance genes were identified using the WIMP-ARMA workflow. The most abundant genera were key endosymbionts of D. citri (""Candidatus Carsonella"", ""Candidatus Profftella"", and Wolbachia). The Shannon diversity index showed that D. citri from Tanzania had the highest diversity of bacterial genera (1.92), and D. citri from China had the lowest (1.34). The Bray-Curtis dissimilarity showed that China and Kenya represented the most diverged populations, while the populations from Kenya and Tanzania were the least diverged. The WIMP-ARMA analyses generated 48 CARD genes from 13 bacterial species in each of the populations. Spectinomycin resistance genes were the most frequently found, with an average of 65.98% in all the populations. These findings add to the knowledge on the diversity of the African D. citri populations and the probable introduction source of the psyllid in these African countries."
https://openalex.org/W3037812989,"Background Rotator cuff tendon repair in humans is a commonly performed procedure aimed at restoring the tendon-bone interface. Despite significant innovation of surgical techniques and suture anchor implants, only 60% of repairs heal successfully. One strategy to enhance repair is the use of bioactive sutures that provide the native tendon with biophysical cues for healing. We investigated the tissue response to a multifilament electrospun polydioxanone (PDO) suture in a sheep tendon injury model characterised by a natural history of failure of healing. Methodology and results Eight skeletally mature English Mule sheep underwent repair with electrospun sutures. Monofilament sutures were used as a control. Three months after surgery, all tendon repairs healed, without systemic features of inflammation, signs of tumour or infection at necropsy. A mild local inflammatory reaction was seen. On histology the electrospun sutures were densely infiltrated with predominantly tendon fibroblast-like cells. In comparison, no cellular infiltration was observed in the control suture. Neovascularisation was observed within the electrospun suture, whilst none was seen in the control. Foreign body giant cells were rarely seen with either sutures. Conclusion This study demonstrates that a tissue response can be induced in tendon with a multifilament electrospun suture with no safety concerns."
https://openalex.org/W3037449517,"Background Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) affects about 13 million under-five children (U5), with an estimated one million dying every year. In this study we aimed at determining the in hospital mortality and its associated factors among U5s admitted with SAM. Methods This was a prospective cohort study of children 6 months to 5 years with SAM admitted at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH) between June and August 2015. Care-takers were interviewed to collect socio-demographic and clinical information. Children under-went physical examination and had blood drawn for HIV, serum glucose, malaria, full blood count, culture and serum electrolytes investigation. Children were managed according to WHO treatment guidelines for SAM. All participants were followed up for a maximum period of 30 days. The proportion of U5 deaths within the first 48 hours and during the entire admission period was calculated. Using Poisson regression analysis, predictors of in-hospital mortality were analyzed with STATA/IC 11.0. Results We enrolled 122 children, median age of 15 months [IQR:11–24], 58.2% males, 90% immunized, 81% ill for more than 2 weeks before admission, 71% from lower health facilities and majority with unknown HIV status(76%). Overall, 13 (10.7%) children died in hospital. Seven (5.7%) died within the first 48 hours. Intravenous (IV) fluid administration significantly predicted in-hospital mortality (adjusted IRR: 7.2, 95%CI: 2.14–24.08, p = 0.001). Conclusion The in-hospital mortality in U5s with SAM was lower than that previously reported in central Uganda. Intravenous fluid administration significantly predicted overall in-hospital mortality. While Administration of intravenous fluids is still the main stay of managing severely malnourished children with shock, more research needs to be conducted in order to review the parameters presently used to assess children for shock with a view of diagnosing and managing shock in these children when it is still early. Adequate guidance on use of IV fluids in management of severely malnourished children should be prioritized during continuous medical education for healthcare workers and in the treatment guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W3037185423,"Perennial crops in agricultural systems can increase sustainability and the magnitude of ecosystem services, but yield may depend upon biotic context, including soil mutualists, pathogens and cropping diversity. These biotic factors themselves may interact with abiotic factors such as drought. We tested whether perennial crop yield depended on soil microbes, water availability and crop diversity by testing monocultures and mixtures of three perennial crop species: a novel perennial grain (intermediate wheatgrass—Thinopyrum intermedium-- that produces the perennial grain Kernza®), a potential perennial oilseed crop (Silphium intregrifolium), and alfalfa (Medicago sativa). Perennial crop performance depended upon both water regime and the presence of living soil, most likely the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in the whole soil inoculum from a long term perennial monoculture and from an undisturbed native remnant prairie. Specifically, both Silphium and alfalfa strongly benefited from AM fungi. The presence of native prairie AM fungi had a greater benefit to Silphium in dry pots and alfalfa in wet pots than AM fungi present in the perennial monoculture soil. Kernza did not benefit from AM fungi. Crop mixtures that included Kernza overyielded, but overyielding depended upon inoculation. Specifically, mixtures with Kernza overyielded most strongly in sterile soil as Kernza compensated for poor growth of Silphium and alfalfa. This study identifies the importance of soil biota and the context dependence of benefits of native microbes and the overyielding of mixtures in perennial crops."
https://openalex.org/W3037469536,"Ubiquitination is a reversible post-translational modification that has emerged as a critical regulator of synapse development and function. However, the mechanisms that regulate the deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) responsible for the removal of ubiquitin from target proteins are poorly understood. We have previously shown that the DUB ubiquitin-specific protease 46 (USP-46) removes ubiquitin from the glutamate receptor GLR-1 and regulates its trafficking and degradation in Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that the WD40-repeat proteins WDR-20 and WDR-48 bind and stimulate the catalytic activity of USP-46. Here, we identified another mechanism by which WDR-48 regulates USP-46. We found that increased expression of WDR-48, but not WDR-20, promotes USP-46 abundance in mammalian cells in culture and in C. elegans neurons in vivo. Inhibition of the proteasome increased USP-46 abundance, and this effect was nonadditive with increased WDR-48 expression. We found that USP-46 is ubiquitinated and that expression of WDR-48 reduces the levels of ubiquitin–USP-46 conjugates and increases the t1/2 of USP-46. A point-mutated WDR-48 variant that disrupts binding to USP-46 was unable to promote USP-46 abundance in vivo. Finally, siRNA-mediated knockdown of wdr48 destabilizes USP46 in mammalian cells. Together, these results support a model in which WDR-48 binds and stabilizes USP-46 protein levels by preventing the ubiquitination and degradation of USP-46 in the proteasome. Given that a large number of USPs interact with WDR proteins, we propose that stabilization of DUBs by their interacting WDR proteins may be a conserved and widely used mechanism that controls DUB availability and function.

Ubiquitination is a widely used post-translational modification that regulates a large variety of neuronal processes including synapse development and function (1Kowalski J.R. Juo P. The role of deubiquitinating enzymes in synaptic function and nervous system diseases.Neural Plast. 2012; 2012 (23316392): 89274910.1155/2012/892749Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 2Mabb A.M.

The covalent attachment of ubiquitin to lysine residues on substrates by ubiquitin E3 ligases has many consequences for target proteins including degradation in the proteasome, changes in protein trafficking, or altered function. Ubiquitination is a highly regulated and reversible process, in which the removal of ubiquitin is achieved by a family of proteases called deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). Although there are ∼600 ubiquitin ligases encoded by the human genome, there are only ∼95 DUBs, suggesting that DUB function is tightly regulated (4Nijman S.M. Luna-Vargas M.P. Velds A.

Indeed, increasing evidence shows that DUBs can be highly selective for substrates and appear to have very specific cellular functions (5Clague M.J. Barsukov I. Coulson J.M. Liu H. Rigden D.J.

Additionally, because DUBs are intracellular proteases and the ubiquitination of proteins affects their function with profound cellular consequences, tight regulation of DUBs is needed to prevent indiscriminate proteolytic cleavage of ubiquitin conjugates (8Sahtoe D.D. Sixma T.K. Layers of DUB regulation.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2015; 40 (26073511): 456-46710.1016/j.tibs.2015.05.002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).

Three related DUBs, USP-46, USP-12, and USP-1, have received particular attention because of their roles in regulating neuronal function, cell growth and division, and DNA damage (10Villamil M.A. Liang Q.

We previously showed that USP-46 regulates glutamate receptor levels in neurons to control glutamatergic behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans (12Kowalski J.R. Dahlberg C.L. Juo P.

USP-46 deubiquitinates the glutamate receptor GLR-1 and protects it from degradation in the lysosome. Similarly, in mammalian neurons, USP-46 can promote glutamate receptor subunit stability by deubiquitinating the glutamate receptor subunits GluA1 and GluA2 (13Huo Y. Khatri N. Hou Q. Gilbert J.

Characterization of Usp46 mutant mice suggests that the DUB can also regulate GABA signaling and depression-like behaviors (14Imai S. Mamiya T. Tsukada A. Sakai Y. Mouri A. Nabeshima T. Ebihara S.

Lastly, USP-1 is a critical mediator of two major DNA damage response pathways: the Fanconi anemia and DNA translesion synthesis pathways (23Huang T.T. Nijman S.M. Mirchandani K.D. Galardy P.J.

The critical roles of these USPs in nervous system function, cell proliferation, and cancer progression underscore the need to understand how these DUBs are regulated.

Together, these structural studies revealed that the WDR proteins interact at a site distal to the active site, suggesting that an allosteric mechanism underlies the ability of the WDR proteins to stimulate the catalytic activity of the DUBs. Here we identify another mechanism by which WDR proteins regulate DUBs. We found that USP-46 is ubiquitinated and degraded in the proteasome. We show that WDR-48 promotes USP-46 protein abundance by binding to the DUB and inhibiting its ubiquitination. We propose that binding of WDR proteins to DUBs may provide a general mechanism to regulate the stability and thus the availability of DUBs to carry out their various cellular functions. We previously showed that the C. elegans WD40-repeat proteins WDR-48 and WDR-20 bind to the deubiquitinating enzyme USP-46 and increase its catalytic activity (37Dahlberg C.L. Juo P. The WD40-repeat proteins WDR-20 and WDR-48 bind and activate the deubiquitinating enzyme USP-46 to promote the abundance of the glutamate receptor GLR-1 in the of Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Biol.

We noticed that expression of WDR-48 but not WDR-20 increases USP-46 protein levels in HEK293T cells. To test whether this effect of WDR-48 occurs in neurons in vivo, we generated transgenic worms (pzIs40) containing an integrated multicopy array that overexpresses GFP-tagged USP-46 (USP-46::GFP) under control of the nmr-1 promoter (38Brockie P.J. Mellem J.E. Hills T. Madsen D.M. Maricq A.V. The C. elegans glutamate receptor subunit NMR-1 is required for slow NMDA-activated currents that regulate reversal frequency during locomotion.Neuron. 2001; 31 (11545720): 617-63010.1016/S0896-6273(01)00394-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) in ventral cord interneurons where the WDR proteins and USP-46 are known to act (12Kowalski J.R.

GFP-tagged USP-46 is functional because this transgene rescues specific glutamatergic behavioral defects observed in usp-46(ok2232) null mutants (Fig. S1; see also “Experimental procedures”). We first tested whether expression of the WDR proteins in ventral cord interneurons altered total USP-46::GFP levels by immunoblotting total worm lysates with anti-GFP antibodies. Consistent with our previous findings in HEK293T cells (37Dahlberg C.L. Juo P.

In contrast, overexpression of WDR-20 alone (wdr-20(xs)) had no effect on USP-46::GFP protein levels (Fig. 1, A and B). Next, we directly measured the levels of USP-46::GFP fluorescence in glr-1–expressing neurons in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) of C. elegans. In WT animals, USP-46::GFP is localized in a diffuse pattern throughout the cell bodies and ventral nerve cord processes (Fig. 1C). We estimated the levels of USP-46::GFP protein in these neurons by measuring the average fluorescence of USP-46::GFP in a defined anterior region of the VNC or in the cell body of the VNC neuron PVC (see “Experimental procedures”). We found that overexpression of WDR-48 and WDR-20 in these interneurons increases USP-46::GFP abundance by 2.6-fold (Fig. 1, C and D). This effect can be largely attributed to WDR-48, because overexpression of WDR-48 alone results in a 2.2-fold increase in USP-46::GFP levels, whereas overexpression of WDR-20 alone results in a smaller increase of 1.4-fold in USP-46::GFP levels (Fig. 1, C and D). We observed similar effects in the soma of VNC neurons (see Fig. 3C), suggesting that the WDR proteins increase USP-46::GFP levels throughout the neuron. We confirmed our findings by generating a single-copy integrant of USP-46::GFP (under control of the nmr-1 promoter) (pzSi1) using the Mos1 transposon-mediated single-copy insertion (MosSCI) technique (39Frøkjær-Jensen C. Davis M.W. Ailion M. Jorgensen E.M. Improved Mos1-mediated transgenesis in C. elegans.Nat.

Single-copy expression of USP-46::GFP (pzSi1 in the background of the usp-46 (ok2232) loss-of-function mutation) resulted in low but detectable levels of USP-46::GFP in the VNC. Similar to our findings with overexpressed USP-46::GFP (pzIs40), we found that overexpression of WDR-48 and WDR-20 (wdr-48(xs);wdr-20(xs)) increases single copy–expressed USP-46::GFP levels by ∼2.6-fold (Fig. 1, E and F).Figure 3WDR-48 increases USP-46 protein stability.

There is growing evidence that gamification-based interventions can reach substantial portions of the community. However, to date, these studies have been predominantly quantitative and as such there is a paucity of research in the area on motivations and barriers to engagement with these programs. Four focus groups conducted with N = 26 players who participated in a gamification-based intervention ‘Beat the Street’ revealed several varied motives to engagement, including collective reward; social influence; game reinvention; exploration; accessibility and awareness. However, several barriers specific to the Beat the Street intervention and outdoor gamification interventions more generally were also identified. This study provides novel insight into the motives which engage individuals into physical activity interventions and the design principles which need to be considered when implementing interventions of this nature."
https://openalex.org/W3037189993,"Background Liver cirrhosis has been known to be associated with increased intestinal permeability (IP); however, little is known about the modification of IP after liver transplantation (LT). The present study was aimed to assess IP after LT and evaluated its association with laboratory tests and clinical parameters, as well as with the development of infections. Methods LT recipients were consecutively enrolled and compared with an equal number of patients with liver cirrhosis and healthy subjects. IP was assessed by urinary excretion of chromium-51 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (51Cr-EDTA). Results The median 51Cr-EDTA excretion was found to be higher in 35 LT recipients as compared with that in the healthy controls [4.77% (2.79–6.03) vs. 2.07% (1.57–2.42), p<0.0001], and comparable to that in the cirrhotic patients [3.69% (2.34–6.57), p = 0.445]. 51Cr-EDTA excretion was not associated with clinical variables, the type of immunosuppressive therapy, donor-related factors, comorbidities and incidence of infections [infection/no infection: 4.97% (3.14–7.03) vs 4.62% (2.79–5.82), p = 0.938]. Conclusion LT recipients show an increased IP, similar to that in patients with liver cirrhosis. However, it is not associated with a high risk of infections. Further investigations into the pathogenesis of this persistent impairment of the intestinal barrier are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3037206358,"Background Chronic rejection remains the Achilles heel in vascularized composite allotransplantation. Animal models to specifically study chronic rejection in vascularized composite allotransplantation do not exist so far. However, there are established rat models to study chronic rejection in solid organ transplantation such as allogeneic transplantation between the rat strains Lewis and Fischer344. Thus, we initiated this study to investigate the applicability of hindlimb transplantation between these strains to imitate chronic rejection in vascularized composite allotransplantation and identify potential markers. Methods Allogeneic hindlimb transplantation were performed between Lewis (recipient) and Fischer344 (donor) rats with either constant immunosuppression or a high dose immunosuppressive bolus only in case of acute skin rejections. Histology, immunohistochemistry, microarray and qPCR analysis were used to detect changes in skin and muscle at postoperative day 100. Results We were able to demonstrate significant intimal proliferation, infiltration of CD68 and CD4 positive cells, up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines and initiation of muscular fibrosis in the chronic rejection group. Microarray analysis and subsequent qPCR identified CXC ligands 9–11 as potential markers of chronic rejection. Conclusions The Fischer344 to Lewis hindlimb transplantation model may represent a new option to study chronic rejection in vascularized composite allotransplantation in an experimental setting. CXC ligands 9–11 deserve further research to investigate their role as chronic rejection markers."
https://openalex.org/W3037237874,"Both intraflagellar transport (IFT) and lipidated protein intraflagellar transport (LIFT) pathways are essential for cilia/flagella biogenesis, motility, and sensory functions. In the LIFT pathway, lipidated cargoes are transported into the cilia through the coordinated actions of cargo carrier proteins such as Unc119 or PDE6δ, as well as small GTPases Arl13b and Arl3 in the cilium. Our previous studies have revealed a single Arl13b ortholog in the evolutionarily divergent Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness. TbArl13 catalyzes two TbArl3 homologs, TbArl3A and TbArl3C, suggesting the presence of a conserved LIFT pathway in these protozoan parasites. Only a single homolog to the cargo carrier protein Unc119 has been identified in T. brucei genome, but its function in lipidated protein transport has not been characterized. In this study, we exploited the proximity-based biotinylation approach to identify binding partners of TbUnc119. We showed that TbUnc119 binds to a flagellar arginine kinase TbAK3 in a myristoylation-dependent manner and is responsible for its targeting to and enrichment in the flagellum. Interestingly, only TbArl3A, but not TbArl3C interacted with TbUnc119 in a GTP-dependent manner, suggesting functional specialization of Arl3-GTPases in T. brucei. These results establish the function of TbUnc119 as a myristoylated cargo carrier and support the presence of a conserved LIFT pathway in T. brucei."
https://openalex.org/W3037251860,"In fish-farming areas, copious amounts of organic matter are released into the surrounding environment. Although it is well-known that bacterial community structures and activities are tightly coupled with organic conditions in the environment, actively growing bacteria (AGB) species that are responsible are still largely unknown. Here, we determined seasonal variations in the community structures of free-living and particle-attached AGB in surface and bottom seawater, and also in the easily resuspendable sediment boundary layer. Accordingly, we used bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) magnetic bead immunocapture and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (BUMP-DGGE) analysis. Whereas overall bacterial communities in the resuspendable sediment were quite different from those of the free-living and particle-attached bacteria, the AGB community structures were similar among them. This result suggests that sediment resuspension in aquaculture environments functions as an organic source for bacteria in the water column, and that bacterial species contributing to the environmental capacity and carbon cycle are limited. We identified 25 AGB phylotypes, belonging to Alphaproteobacteria (Roseobacter clade, nine phylotypes), Gammaproteobacteria (five phylotypes), Deltaproteobacteria (one phylotype), Bacteroidetes (seven phylotypes), and Actinobacteria (three phylotypes). Among them, some AGB phylotypes appeared throughout the year with high frequency and were also identified in other coastal environments. This result suggests that these species are responsible for the environmental capacity and carbon cycle, and are key species in this fish-farming area, as well as other coastal environments."

Unlike the first three, forest cover can be modified by silvicultural treatments, the effects of which manifest in the quality and quantity of water, as well as in the transport of sediments and soil nutrients. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of some stand variables on surface runoff and stemflow in pine-oak forests of northern Mexico. The stand variables included tree diameter at breast height, basal area, canopy cover, and volume. They were collected in eight 0.1-ha circular plots, measured in 2016 and re-measured in 2018. Nonlinear quantile regression was used to determine the best-fit relationships between the variables. Results indicated that surface runoff was most closely and inversely related to basal area. Stemflow was related to diameter at breast height, while showing no statistical significance. A stemflow funneling ratio did show an inverse, statistically-significant relationship with diameter at breast height. These results can help determine best forest management regimes compatible with the quantity and quality of water fluxes in this type of ecosystem."

https://openalex.org/W3037911905,"Macrophages play critical roles in homeostasis and inflammation. Macrophage polarization to either a pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory status is controlled by activating inflammatory signaling pathways. Ubiquitination is a posttranslational modification that regulates these inflammatory signaling pathways. However, the influence of protein ubiquitination on macrophage polarization has not been well studied. We hypothesized that the ubiquitination status of key proteins in inflammatory pathways contributes to macrophage polarization, which is regulated by itchy E3 ubiquitin ligase (ITCH), a negative regulator of inflammation. Using ubiquitin proteomics, we found that ubiquitination profiles are different among polarized murine macrophage subsets. Interestingly, interleukin-1α (IL-1α), an important pro-inflammatory mediator, was specifically ubiquitinated in lipopolysaccharide-induced pro-inflammatory macrophages, which was enhanced in ITCH-deficient macrophages. The ITCH-deficient macrophages had increased levels of the mature form of IL-1α and exhibited pro-inflammatory polarization, and reduced deubiquitination of IL-1α protein. Finally, IL-1α neutralization attenuated pro-inflammatory polarization of the ITCH-deficient macrophages.

Inflammation is the host's response to exogenous pathogen invasion or endogenous signals such as damaged cells. Inflammation is critical for tissue repair but can also lead to local or systemic tissue damage if unchecked (1Editorial A current view on inflammation.Nat. Immunol. 2017; 18 (28722714): 82510.1038/ni.3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Macrophages are plastic immune cells necessary for maintaining homeostasis and controlling inflammation (2Hamidzadeh K. Christensen S.M. Dalby E. Chandrasekaran P. Mosser D.M. Macrophages and the recovery from acute and chronic inflammation.Ann. Rev. Physiol. 2017; 79 (27959619): 567-59210.1146/annurev-physiol-022516-034348Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Once activated, macrophages are polarized into pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory macrophages (3Mills C.D. Kincaid K. Alt J.M. Heilman M.J. Hill A.M. M-1/M-2 macrophages and the Th1/Th2 paradigm.J. Immunol. 2000; 164 (10843666): 6166-617310.4049/jimmunol.164.12.6166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar, 4Sica A. Mantovani A.

Given the critical role of macrophages in inflammation, it is important to understand the regulation of macrophage polarization to intervene in unrestrained inflammation. Macrophages survey their milieu for abnormal microenvironmental stimuli through pattern-recognition receptors. Pathogens and environmental challenges activate macrophages and trigger inflammatory pathways such as the archetypical nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, resulting in the production of key inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (2Hamidzadeh K. Christensen S.M. Dalby E. Chandrasekaran P. Mosser D.M. Macrophages and the recovery from acute and chronic inflammation.Ann. Rev. Physiol. 2017; 79 (27959619): 567-59210.1146/annurev-physiol-022516-034348Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Cytokines differentially activate macrophages, resulting in macrophage polarization. Pro-inflammatory macrophages are activated by numerous factors, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and characterized by increased inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and nitric oxide production, which play a central role in the pathogen-killing inflammatory response. In contrast, anti-inflammatory macrophages are activated by IL-4 and characterized by increased arginase expression to promote ornithine metabolism, which is crucial for cell proliferation and tissue repair (5Orecchioni M. Ghosheh Y. Pramod A.B. Ley K. Macrophage polarization: Different gene signatures in M1(LPS+) vs. classically and M2 (LPS−) vs. alternatively activated macrophages.Front. Immunol. 2019; 10 (31178859): 108410.3389/fimmu.2019.01084Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Previous studies linked macrophage activation with the ubiquitination (ub) status of key proteins in inflammatory signal pathways (6Bhoj V.G. Chen Z.J. Ubiquitylation in innate and adaptive immunity.Nature. 2009; 458 (19325622): 430-43710.1038/nature07959Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Lysine-48 ub (Lys-48–ub) of the NF-κB inhibitor (IκB), the final checkpoint of the NFκB pathway, leads to IκB degradation and consequent NF-κB–associated inflammation (7Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Signal-induced site-specific phosphorylation targets IκBα to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.Genes Dev. 1995; 9 (7628694): 1586-159710.1101/gad.9.13.1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). In contrast, TRAF6, an upstream positive regulator of the NF-κB pathway, is modulated by Lys-63–ub, leading to its conformational change and activation (8Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. TAK1 is a ubiquitin-dependent kinase of MKK and IKK.Nature. 2001; 412 (11460167): 346-35110.1038/35085597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). However, a comprehensive analysis of ub profiles of polarized macrophages has not been reported. Whether a unique ub signature is associated with individual macrophage subsets is not known. Ub status of a protein is controlled by both ub and de-ub enzymes. The ub process is catalyzed sequentially by ubiquitin E1, E2, and E3 ligases whereas de-ub is carried out by de-ub enzymes (DUB). ITCH is a well-characterized negative regulator of inflammation that functions as an E3 ligase as well as an adaptor protein of DUB in addition to catalyzing the final step of protein ub (9Aki D. Zhang W. Liu Y.C. The E3 ligase Itch in immune regulation and beyond.Immunol. Rev. 2015; 266 (26085204): 6-2610.1111/imr.12301Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). ITCH catalyzes the Lys-48–ub of the pro-inflammatory AP-1 and JunB transcription factors, marking them for degradation, and consequently inhibits the expression of downstream cytokines in T cells (10Gao M. Labuda T. Xia Y. Gallagher E. Fang D. Liu Y.C. Karin M. Jun turnover is controlled through JNK-dependent phosphorylation of the E3 ligase Itch.Science. 2004; 306 (15358865): 271-27510.1126/science.1099414Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In contrast, ITCH forms complexes with the DUB enzyme A20 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, resulting in inflammation inhibition (11Shembade N. Harhaj N.S. Parvatiyar K. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Matesic L.E. Harhaj E.W. The E3 ligase Itch negatively regulates inflammatory signaling pathways by controlling the function of the ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20.Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9 (18246070): 254-26210.1038/ni1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We reported that ITCH interacts with DUB enzyme CYLD to reverse the Lys-63–ub of TRAF6 and down-regulate the NF-κB pathway in osteoclast precursors (12Zhang H. Wu C. Matesic L.E. Li X. Wang Z. Boyce B.F. Xing L. Ubiquitin E3 ligase Itch negatively regulates osteoclast formation by promoting deubiquitination of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6.J. Biol.

However, the role of ITCH as a ub modulator in polarized macrophages has not been studied. Itch is expressed at low levels at baseline. Itch is an NF-κB target-responsive gene, and with pro-inflammatory stimulation such as LPS, the expression of Itch is elevated to negatively regulate inflammation (9Aki D. Zhang W. Liu Y.C. The E3 ligase Itch in immune regulation and beyond.Immunol. Rev. 2015; 266 (26085204): 6-2610.1111/imr.12301Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, exploring genes and proteins affected in Itch−/− macrophages will improve our understanding of the negative regulation during sustained inflammation. IL-1 is an important pro-inflammatory cytokine. IL-1 family cytokines include IL-1α and IL-1β; both bind to the same IL-1 receptor and eventually activates NF-κB signaling to induce inflammation (13Malik A. Kanneganti T.D. Function and regulation of IL-1α in inflammatory diseases and cancer.Immunol. Rev. 2018; 281 (29247991): 124-13710.1111/imr.12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The ub of pro–IL-1β promotes its catalytic processing and subsequent maturation (14Duong B.H. Onizawa M. Oses-Prieto J.A. Advincula R. Burlingame A. Malynn B.A. Ma A. A20 restricts ubiquitination of pro-interleukin-1β protein complexes and suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome activity.Immunity. 2015; 42 (25607459): 55-6710.1016/j.immuni.2014.12.031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). However, how the ub and de-ub regulation of IL-1 affects mac polarization is unknown. In the current study, we show that quiescent, pro-inflammatory, and anti-inflammatory macrophages have distinct ub profiles and elevated ub of IL-1α in LPS-induced pro-inflammatory macrophages ITCH inhibits inflammatory cytokine IL-1α maturation by promoting the de-ub of pro–IL-1α, thereby negatively regulating LPS–macs pro-inflammatory polarization. Our data indicate that the ub status of key mediators affects macrophage pro-inflammatory polarization, which is regulated by ITCH. Our study provides rationale for modulating protein ub of key regulators in macrophages as an approach to interfere with inflammatory diseases. To test whether protein ub is altered during macrophage polarization, we treated WT BMMs with LPS to induce pro-inflammatory macrophages or IL-4 to induce anti-inflammatory macrophages using the protocol that we have described recently (15Wang W.

We assessed the expressional levels of total ubiquitinated proteins by Western blot analysis. We validated our cell model by assessing the expression of surface markers and effector genes expression in these cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Consistent with the literature (17Smith T.D. Tse M.J. Read E.L. Liu W.F. Regulation of macrophage polarization and plasticity by complex activation signals.Integr. Biol. (Camb). 2016; 8 (27492191): 946-95510.1039/c6ib00105jCrossref PubMed Google Scholar), LPS-treated cells (LPS-macs) were stained positively for iNOS whereas IL-4–treated cells (IL-4–macs) were stained positively for CD206, surface markers for pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory macrophages, respectively (Fig. 1A). LPS-macrophages had a pro-inflammatory gene expression profile with ∼500- to 1000-fold-increases in IL-1β, NOS2, and TNF mRNA levels compared with PBS-macs, whereas IL-4–macs had an anti-inflammatory gene expression profile with a similar -fold increase of IL10 and PPARγ mRNA expression (Fig. 1B). Surprisingly, the expressional levels of total ubiquitinated proteins were similar in all three types of macrophages (Fig. 1C), suggesting that changes in ub of specific proteins, rather than the total amount of ubiquitinated proteins, may be associated with macrophage polarization. To identify key regulatory proteins in macrophage polarization, we assessed the ub profiles of LPS-, IL-4–, and PBS-macs (Fig. 2A) using the ubiquitin proteomics approach (18Udeshi N.D. Mertins P. Svinkina T. Carr S.A. Large-scale identification of ubiquitination sites by mass spectrometry.Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 (24051958): 1950-196010.1038/nprot.2013.120Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). As expected, ub profiles were different among three macrophage subsets; 30, 32, and 14 proteins were differentially ubiquitinated in PBS-, LPS-, and IL-4–macs, respectively (Fig. 2B and Table 1 detailed the ubiquitin proteomics findings in Table S1 and PRIDE dataset identifier PXD018743). Among 32 ubiquitinated proteins in pro-inflammatory LPS-macs, iNOS and IL-1α were the fifth and eighth highest ubiquitinated proteins (Fig. 2C). Both iNOS and IL-1 proteins undergo posttranslational modification by ub (19Ainscough J.S. Frank Gerberick G. Zahedi-Nejad M. Lopez-Castejon G. Brough D. Kimber I. Dearman R.J.

However, whether ITCH affects ub of iNOS or IL-1α as a molecular mechanism for its anti-inflammatory effect has not been studied. To explore if ITCH mediated the ub of iNOS and IL-1α in macrophages, we utilized ITCH-deficient cells. Compared with WT LPS-macs, Itch−/− LPS-macs had 2-fold increased iNOS signal intensity by immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 3, A and B). Expression of NOS2 and IL1β mRNA significantly increased 5.44-fold in Itch−/− LPS-macs compared with 1.36-fold in WT LPS-macs (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that Itch−/− macrophages are predisposed to pro-inflammatory polarization. To determine whether ITCH negatively regulates pro-inflammatory polarization by mediating ub of IL-1α or iNOS in macrophages, we assessed the ub status of iNOS and IL-1α in macrophages from Itch−/− mice Ubiquitinated iNOS levels were comparable in Itch−/− and WT LPS-macs (4.1 ± 0.9 in Itch−/− versus 3.72 ± 0.74 in WT, -fold increase of LPS-macs over WT PBS-macs) (Fig. 4A). However, ubiquitinated IL-1α levels were ∼2-fold higher in Itch−/− compared with WT cells (9.27 ± 1.16 in Itch−/− versus 4.36 ± 1.05 in WT, -fold increase of LPS-macs over WT PBS-macs) (Fig. 4B), indicating that the ub status of IL-1α, but not iNOS, may be regulated by ITCH.Figure 4Elevated ubiquitinated IL-1α in Itch−/− pro-inflammatory macrophages. BMMs from Itch−/− mice or WT littermate controls were treated as in Fig. 3. Whole-cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-iNOS or anti–IL-1α antibodies and IP complexes were blotted with an anti-ubiquitin antibody. iNOS and IL-1α protein expression in the input whole lysates were used as controls. The intensity of the ubiquitinated iNOS or IL-1α was quantified with ImageJ as average intensity density × the area of the smeared band. The levels of ubiquitinated proteins were normalized to actin and then to PBS-treated WT samples. A, ubiquitinated iNOS was increased in LPS-macs, but is similar between WT and Itch−/− LPS-macs. B, ubiquitinated IL-1α was increased in LPS-macs and was further increased in Itch−/− LPS-macs. Data were analyzed with two-way ANOVA followed by Sidak's post hoc test. Values are mean ± S.D. of n = 3. *, p < 0.05 LPS-macs versus PBS-macs; #, p < 0.05 Itch−/− cells versus WT cells (only the statistics of the comparison between Itch−/− versus WT with the same treatment are shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Elevated ubiquitinated IL-1α in Itch−/− macrophages (Fig. 4) suggested that ITCH functioned as an adaptor protein for DUB enzymes to remove ubiquitin from IL-1α. To test whether ITCH affected the de-ub of IL-1α, we stimulated macrophages with LPS for 8 h and assessed the levels of ubiquitinated IL-1α 8 h and 16 h after removing LPS from the culture (Fig. 5A). We found that ubiquitinated IL-1α proteins were higher in Itch−/− macrophages compared with WT macrophages after LPS removal (-fold increase over PBS: 3.76 ± 1.00 in Itch−/− versus 1.24 ± 0.52 in WT cells at 8 h; 1.73 ± 0.45 in Itch−/− versus 0.69 ± 0.32 at 16 h) (Fig. 5, B and C). Furthermore, ubiquitinated IL-1α decreased slower in Itch−/− LPS-macs compared with WT (percentage decrease of ubiquitinated IL-1α during the chase: −1.09 ± 27.59% in Itch−/− versus 61.09 ± 12.51% in WT cells at 8 h; 50.43 ± 3.97 in Itch−/− versus 78.68 ± 5.70 at 16 h) (Fig. 5D). In contrast, the expression of IL-1α mRNA was not significantly different between Itch−/− and WT macrophages after removing LPS (Fig. 5E), suggesting that higher levels of ubiquitinated IL-1α in Itch−/− macrophages after LPS removal were not because of transcriptional regulation. Because the levels of ubiquitinated IL-1α were higher after LPS removal in macrophage-deficient ITCH, we suspected that ITCH may affect the de-ub process via its adaptor function, i.e. ITCH works with DUB enzymes to reduce IL-1α ubiquitination. To test this possibility, we treated LPS-macs 8 h after LPS removal (Fig. 5B, lanes 3 and 7) with a DUB inhibitor WP1130. WP1130 increased ubiquitinated IL-1α in WT LPS macrophages (Fig. 5F, lane 4 versus lane 3; (Fig. 5G) -fold increase over PBS: 9.78 ± 2.44 in WP1130-treated WT LPS-macs versus 3.83 ± 1.04 in vehicle-treated WT LPS-macs) to a similar level to that of Itch−/− macrophages (Fig. 5F, lane 4 versus lane 7; (Fig. 5G) -fold increase over PBS: 9.78 ± 2.44 in WP1130-treated WT LPS-macs versus 7.99 ± 1.96 in vehicle-treated Itch−/− LPS-macs). Thus, Itch regulates the ub status of IL-1α by promoting its de-ub process, which can be blocked by ITCH depletion or the DUB inhibition. We then studied how reduced IL-1α de-ub contributes to increased pro-inflammatory phenotype in Itch−/− LPS-macs because of the positive correlation between ubiquitinated IL-1α and inflammation (Figure 3, Figure 4). We hypothesized that ub promoted the processing of pro–IL-1α, resulting in its maturation. We found that mature form of IL-1α increased ∼2-fold in Itch−/− LPS-macs compared with WT cells (-fold increase of LPS-macs over WT PBS-macs: 13.33 ± 2.57 in Itch−/− versus 7.98 ± 0.039 in WT cells) (Fig. 6A) measured by Western blot analysis based on the different molecular weights of pro– and mature IL-1α. Consistently, secreted IL-1α in the supernatant of Itch−/− LPS-macs was ∼2.5-fold higher than WT (-fold increase of LPS-macs over WT PBS-macs: 62.70 ± 4.20 in Itch−/− versus 24.75 ± 2.25 in WT cells) (Fig. 6B) measured using ELISA that measures soluble IL-1α acquired upon maturation. Because the maturation of pro–IL-1α is chiefly catalyzed by granzyme B (21Afonina I.S. Tynan G.A. Logue S.E. Cullen S.P. Bots M. Lüthi A.U. Reeves E.P. McElvaney N.G. Medema J.P. Lavelle E.C. Martin S.J. Granzyme B-dependent proteolysis acts as a switch to enhance the proinflammatory activity of IL-1α.Mol. Cell. 2011; 44 (22017873): 265-27810.1016/j.molcel.2011.07.037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), it is possible that ITCH depletion increases mature IL-1α by increasing the enzymatic activity of granzyme B. To test this, we assessed granzyme B activity using specific substrate Ac-IETD-AFC. Although granzyme B activity increased after LPS stimulation in both WT and Itch−/− LPS-macs (-fold increase of over WT PBS-macs: 2.00 ± 0.45 in LPS-macs versus 1.00 ± 0.11 in PBS-macs in WT cells, 1.66 ± 0.38 in LPS-macs versus 1.05 ± 0.24 in PBS-macs in Itch−/− cells), there was no difference between WT and Itch−/− LPS-macs (-fold increase of LPS-macs over WT PBS-macs: 1.66 ± 0.38 in Itch−/− versus 2.00 ± 0.45 in WT cells) (Fig. 6C), suggesting that Itch's regulation of IL-1α maturation was independent of granzyme B. To further support that ITCH depletion promotes IL-1α maturation, we knocked down ITCH in WT macrophages using siRNA approach. Compared with control siRNA-transfected cells, cells that were transfected with siRNA Itch had 60% reduction in ITCH protein expression (-fold increase of ITCH in LPS-macs over control PBS-macs: 0.84 ± 0.04 in Itch siRNA versus 1.40 ± 0.20 in control siRNA) (Fig. 6D). Most importantly, Itch knockdown macrophages showed ∼1.6-fold increase of mature IL-1α than control macrophages, a similar increase in Itch−/− cells over WT cells (-fold increase of LPS-macs over control PBS-macs: 9.78 ± 1.15 in Itch siRNA versus 6.21 ± 1.19 in control siRNA) (Fig. 6D). These data further indicate that ITCH inhibits IL-1α maturation by decreasing the maturation process of ubiquitinated IL-1α. To further support the argument that IL-1α maturation contributes to susceptibility of Itch−/− macrophage to pro-inflammatory polarization, we examined whether IL-1α neutralizing antibodies (IL-1α–Ab) can rescue the increased pro-inflammatory phenotype in Itch−/− LPS-macs by immunofluorescence staining for iNOS intensity and qPCR analyzing for the expression of NOS2. IL-1α–Ab treatment slightly, about 35%, decreased iNOS intensity in WT cells (-fold increase of LPS- over PBS-macs: 3.30 ± 0.49 in IL-1α–Ab versus 5.03 ± 0.48 in IgG control, p = 8.54 × 10−5). More substantial, about 47%, decrease was observed in Itch−/− cells (-fold increase of LPS-macs over PBS-macs: 4.34 ± 058 in IL-1α–Ab versus 8.24 ± 0.50 in IgG control, p = 3.26 × 10−6) Fig. 7, A and B. An equivalent amount of IgG was used as control and did not affect iNOS signal intensity. IL-1α–Ab reduced the expression of NOS2 mRNA by ∼3-fold in Itch−/− LPS-macs (-fold increase of LPS-macs over WT PBS-macs: 3428.44 ± 236.35 in IL-1α–Ab versus 9182.04 ± 387.50 in IgG control, p = 1.57 × 10−5), but did not affect WT macrophages (-fold increase of LPS-macs over WT PBS-macs: 2991.97 ± 254.71 in IL-1α–Ab versus 3616.50 ± 82.99 in IgG control, p = 0.87) (Fig. 7C). These data suggest that increased activated IL-1α is correlated with increased susceptibility of macrophage polarization in Itch−/− macrophages. Recent studies demonstrated the importance of mac polarization in various pathological conditions, which are controlled by intricate signaling pathway crosstalk. Using ubiquitin proteomics, we showed that the ub profiles are distinct in polarized macrophages. We also found that the ub status of IL-1α is associated with its maturation, which is mediated by ubiquitin E3 ligase ITCH. ITCH depletion in macrophages resulted in elevated ubiquitinated IL-1α, decreased IL-1α de-ub, increased mature IL-1α, and more severe pro-inflammatory polarization (Fig. 8). This implies that modulating ub of key proteins may be a viable approach to manipulate macrophage phenotype and interfere with macrophage-mediated diseases.

For our reference, the parameter ""number of professionals who completed the course"" calculated the proportion of professionals who completed the course, and was divided by the total number of primary health care professionals in the municipality to create a ratio. The cutoff points used represented tertile distribution: T3: high (0.35-1.00), T2: intermediate (0.02-0.33) and T1: low (0.00-0.01); to avoid biased results, the analysis was also performed for the years prior to the beginning of the course in question (2009 and 2010).During the study period, enrollment of pregnant women, exclusive breastfeeding for children under 4 months, and up-to-date vaccinations in children younger than 1 year to 23 months increased (high to intermediate categories) in municipalities where professionals who completed the specialization course worked. Growth in the intermediate ratio was also observed in indicators related to cervical cancer screening and new diagnoses of congenital syphilis in infants under one year of age.The presence of care workers who completed a specialization course on family health was seen to be associated with improved care and indicators for maternal and child health in municipalities in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.

To investigate these pathways, we identified novel genes whose transcription was induced by GH in the liver of hypophysectomized (HPX) rats using the suppression subtractive hybridization technique. We found that regulator of calcineurin 1 (Rcan1) mRNA was upregulated by GH administration. RCAN1 regulates the activity of calcineurin, a Ca/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase. Rcan1 encodes two major transcripts, Rcan1-1 and Rcan1-4, resulting from differential promoter use and first exon choice. We found that a single injection of GH increased the levels of Rcan1-4 mRNA and RCAN1-4 protein transiently, but did not increase Rcan1-1 mRNA in HPX rat liver. Then the molecular mechanism of GH to induce Rcan1-4 transcription was examined in rat hepatoma H4IIE cells. Experiments using inhibitors suggested that c-JUN N-terminal kinase was required for the induction of Rcan1-4 mRNA by GH. GH increased the levels of phosphorylated c-JUN protein and c-Jun mRNA in HPX rat liver. The luciferase and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that c-JUN upregulated Rcan1-4 mRNA by binding to the cAMP-responsive element in the upstream of Rcan1 exon 4. These results indicate that GH activates c-JUN to affect the activity of calcineurin by the induction of Rcan1-4 in rat liver."

Using RNA-seq technology, a transcriptome analysis was carried out on the flesh and peel of 'Baiyu' fruit during four different fruit development stages. A total of 172.53 Gb clean reads with an average of 6.33 Gb reads were detected for each library, and the percentage of Q30 was higher than 90.84%. We identified 16 carotenogenic and 13 plastid-lipid-associated protein (PAP) genes through RNA-seq. Of these, five carotenogenic and four PAP related genes exhibited remarkable differences in the expression patterns. Carotenoids biosynthetic genes, including DXS, PSY1 and VDE displayed higher expression levels in peel than that in the flesh. However, carotenoids decomposition gene, such as NCDE1, exhibited higher expression in flesh than that in the peel. Notably, all differentially expressed PAP genes showed higher expression levels in peel than flesh. We inferred that the differential accumulation of carotenoids in flesh and peel of 'Baiyu' is caused by the up- or down-regulation of the carotenogenic and PAP related genes. The functional analysis of these important genes will provide valuable information about underlying molecular mechanism of carotenoids accumulation in loquat."

https://openalex.org/W3038098227,"An important inferential task in functional linear models is to test the dependence between the response and the functional predictor. The traditional testing theory was constructed based on the functional principle component analysis which requires estimating the covariance operator of the functional predictor. Due to the intrinsic high-dimensionality of functional data, the sample is often not large enough to allow accurate estimation of the covariance operator and hence causes the follow-up test underpowered. To avoid the expensive estimation of the covariance operator, we propose a nonparametric method called Functional Linear models with U-statistics TEsting (FLUTE) to test the dependence assumption. We show that the FLUTE test is more powerful than the current benchmark method (Kokoszka P,2008; Patilea V,2016) in the small or moderate sample case. We further prove the asymptotic normality of our test statistic under both the null hypothesis and a local alternative hypothesis. The merit of our method is demonstrated by both simulation studies and real examples."
