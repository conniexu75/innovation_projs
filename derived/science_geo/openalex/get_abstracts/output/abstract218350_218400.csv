https://openalex.org/W2346695454,"Chromaffin granules isolated from beef adrenal medulla took up C(14)-labeled catecholamines from an isotonic medium at 37 degrees C at a rate approximately 20 times the rate at 0 degrees C. The uptake was stimulated three- to five-fold by Mg(++) and adenosine triphosphate. Reserpine (1 x 10(-5)M) caused a 90 percent inhibition of uptake; ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid completely inhibited the stimulation by magnesium and adenosine triphosphate, and the inhibition could be reversed by addition of excess Mg(++)."

https://openalex.org/W2038136746,"We propose that the surface-active lining of the mammalian lung is formed in the mitochondria of the alveolar epithelial cells. Findings supporting this hypothesis are the presence of strong surfactant uniquely in the washed mitochondrial fraction of mammalian lung, almost complete loss of mitochondrial lamellar forms accompanying loss of lung surface activity after vagotomy, and the absence of strong surface activity from the lung extracts of animals whose alveolar lining cells show no lamellar forms."

https://openalex.org/W1969218663,Kittens sustaining bilateral amygdalectomy failed to show behavioral changes seen in the adult after subjection to similar lesions. No growth deficits or hypopituitarism occurred in the kittens. A certain level of neuroendocrine maturation may be necessary for the effects of amygdalectomy to be manifested.

https://openalex.org/W2038029974,The activity of alpha-glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase has been measured in muscles from four insect species. In flying insects the enzyme activity is much greater per unit weight for flight muscles than for leg muscles. The results indicate a direct relationship between muscle levels of the enzyme and habitual mode of locomotion.

https://openalex.org/W2034538296,"A method is described to implant a permanent indwelling polyethylene tube venting to the surface of the cerebral cortex of the dog. Morphine, amobarbital, or imipramine was administered through the tube, and behavioral changes were observed in unanesthetized and unrestrained animals. The results are different from those occurring after intraventricular injection."
