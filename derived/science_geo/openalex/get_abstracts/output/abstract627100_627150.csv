This, in turn, affects the production of myogenic precursors and impairs regeneration and suggests that increasing such divisions may be beneficial. Here, through a small-molecule screen, we identified epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Aurora kinase A (Aurka) as regulators of asymmetric satellite cell divisions. Inhibiting EGFR causes a substantial shift from asymmetric to symmetric division modes, whereas EGF treatment increases asymmetric divisions. EGFR activation acts through Aurka to orient mitotic centrosomes, and inhibiting Aurka blocks EGF stimulation-induced asymmetric division. In vivo EGF treatment markedly activates asymmetric divisions of dystrophin-deficient satellite cells in mdx mice, increasing progenitor numbers, enhancing regeneration, and restoring muscle strength. Therefore, activating an EGFR-dependent polarity pathway promotes functional rescue of dystrophin-deficient satellite cells and enhances muscle force generation.

The balance between stem cell self-renewal and differentiation affects the kinetics and efficiency of tissue regeneration. Rather than directly undergoing differentiation, stem cells can give rise to progenitors through asymmetric cell divisions. This creates a layer of regulation that allows stem cells to self-renew as well as imprint the identity of their progeny by asymmetrically segregating fate determinants through polarity, protein trafficking, and cell cycle-dependent mechanisms (Knoblich, 2008Knoblich J.A.

Although many intrinsic mechanisms of asymmetric divisions are conserved across evolution and in different cell types, extrinsic determinants are dependent on the tissue organization and spatial localization of cell fate determinants (Arsenio et al., 2015Arsenio J.

Muscle stem cells, or satellite cells, are essential for the growth and regeneration of skeletal muscle (reviewed in Dumont et al., 2015aDumont N.A. Bentzinger C.F. Sincennes M.-C. Rudnicki M.A. Satellite Cells and Skeletal Muscle Regeneration.Compr. Physiol. 2015; 5: 1027-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The majority of satellite cells represent a short-term repopulating cell (Kuang et al., 2007Kuang S. Kuroda K. Le Grand F.

We term these cells satellite stem cells. A key feature of satellite stem cells is the lack of the myogenic transcription factor Myf5, which can be used to distinguish stem cells from committed progenitors (Kuang et al., 2007Kuang S.

Stimulating satellite stem cell symmetric expansion results in augmented muscle regeneration with a dramatic increase in satellite cell numbers (Le Grand et al., 2009Le Grand F. Jones A.E. Seale V.

Rudnicki M.A. Wnt7a activates the planar cell polarity pathway to drive the symmetric expansion of satellite stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 535-547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Conversely, promiscuous activation of JAK2-STAT3 mediates the decline of satellite cell self-renewal in aging by biasing satellite stem cells toward asymmetric divisions (Price et al., 2014Price F.D. von Maltzahn J. Bentzinger C.F. Dumont N.A. Yin H. Chang N.C. Wilson D.H. Frenette J. Rudnicki M.A. Inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling stimulates adult satellite cell function.Nat.

Moreover, cell-autonomous defects leading to loss of polarized p38MAPK signaling in aged cells attenuates self-renewal, whereby pharmacological rejuvenation of aged stem cells can restore muscle function (Bernet et al., 2014Bernet J.D. Doles J.D. Hall J.K. Kelly Tanaka K. Carter T.A. Olwin B.B. p38 MAPK signaling underlies a cell-autonomous loss of stem cell self-renewal in skeletal muscle of aged mice.Nat.

Thus, regulation of satellite stem cell asymmetric division is a key control point that affects the efficiency of the muscle regenerative program. We recently discovered that deficits in muscle stem cell asymmetric divisions are part of the underlying mechanism that results in progressive wasting of skeletal muscle found in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), an X-linked genetic disease caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene (Dumont et al., 2015bDumont N.A. Wang Y.X. von Maltzahn J. Pasut A. Bentzinger C.F. Brun C.E. Rudnicki M.A. Dystrophin expression in muscle stem cells regulates their polarity and asymmetric division.Nat. Med. 2015; 21 (advance online publication): 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Although dystrophin deficiency in muscle fibers makes them susceptible to membrane damage (Anderson and Kunkel, 1992Anderson M.S. Kunkel L.M. The molecular and biochemical basis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 289-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, Cohn and Campbell, 2000Cohn R.D. Campbell K.P. Molecular basis of muscular dystrophies.Muscle Nerve. 2000; 23: 1456-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), dystrophin deficiency in satellite stem cells results in loss of polarity determination and reduced asymmetric divisions, ultimately leading to diminished production of myogenic progenitors and hindered regeneration. The compounding effect of diminished regeneration with chronic degeneration of fragile myofibers accounts for the eventual replacement of muscle by adipose and fibrotic infiltrates in mouse (Cohn et al., 2002Cohn R.D.

Histopathological changes in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.J. Neurol. Sci. 1968; 7: 529-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Here we report the identification of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Aurora kinase A (Aurka) pathways as determinants of asymmetric satellite stem cell divisions through an in-niche muscle stem cell screen. EGF stimulation activates EGFR localized at the basal surface of muscle stem cells and recruits the mitotic spindle assembly protein Aurka to induce apicobasal asymmetric divisions. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of Aurka abolishes EGF-induced asymmetric divisions. Importantly, the EGFR polarity pathway acts independently of dystrophin and can rescue the deficit in asymmetric division in dystrophin-deficient satellite cells. Treatment with exogenous EGF in mdx mice, a mouse model of DMD, enhances the formation of new myofibers, resulting in better muscle function while delaying fibrotic accumulation. Therefore, we conclude that the EGFR pathway can be exploited to restore muscle stem cell polarity and function in DMD. The satellite cell microenvironment is required to provide necessary signals for asymmetric divisions (Bentzinger et al., 2013aBentzinger C.F. Wang Y.X. Dumont N.A. Rudnicki M.A. Cellular dynamics in the muscle satellite cell niche.EMBO Rep. 2013; 14: 1062-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Therefore, we designed a scalable method to quantify satellite stem cell fate decisions without removing them from their native niche. Using Myf5-Cre (Tallquist et al., 2000Tallquist M.D. Weismann K.E. Hellström M. Soriano P. Early myotome specification regulates PDGFA expression and axial skeleton development.Development. 2000; 127: 5059-5070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and R26R-eYFP (Srinivas et al., 2001Srinivas S. Watanabe T. Lin C.S. William C.M. Tanabe Y. Jessell T.M. Costantini F. Cre reporter strains produced by targeted insertion of EYFP and ECFP into the ROSA26 locus.BMC Dev. Biol. 2001; 1: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (2305) Google Scholar) alleles, Cre-mediated recombination at the R26R-eYFP allele and expression of yellow fluorescent protein following Myf5 activation discriminate Myf5Neg satellite stem cells and Myf5Pos committed satellite cells. Culturing single myofibers from Myf5-Cre/ROSA26-eYFP mice for 42 h, where 80% of satellite cells have undergone a single round of cell division, we can quantify symmetric and asymmetric satellite stem cell divisions as well as committed satellite cell divisions through the expression of eYFP (Figure 1A). Recombination at the R26R-eYFP allele results in individual genotypes for satellite stem cells and committed satellite cells. Therefore, primer combinations designed against the recombination status of the R26R-eYFP allele can be used to quantify numbers of satellite stem cells and committed satellite cells by real-time qPCR (Figures S1A and S1B). Consistent with manual enumeration of satellite stem cells by immunofluorescence, real-time qPCR quantification of the recombination state of genomic DNA isolated from myofiber cultures accurately detected a 1.5-fold increase in satellite stem cell numbers after Wnt7a stimulation (Figure S1C). Thus, this method enables us to analyze changes in the stem cell population. We adapted this system to a 96-well format using myofibers isolated from flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) muscles, which have a higher satellite cell-to-myonuclei ratio and are amenable for transfer by pipetting (Shefer and Yablonka-Reuveni, 2005Shefer G. Yablonka-Reuveni Z. Isolation and culture of skeletal muscle myofibers as a means to analyze satellite cells.Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 290: 281-304PubMed Google Scholar), to screen well-characterized small-molecule inhibitors. Altogether, 640 well-characterized pharmacological compounds were screened against Wnt7a as a positive control (Le Grand et al., 2009Le Grand F. Jones A.E. Seale V. Scimè A. Rudnicki M.A. Wnt7a activates the planar cell polarity pathway to drive the symmetric expansion of satellite stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 535-547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). We identified 43 candidate compounds as inducers of satellite stem cell expansion (Table S1). Consistent with p38MAPK driving satellite cell commitment (Bernet et al., 2014Bernet J.D. Doles J.D. Hall J.K. Kelly Tanaka K. Carter T.A. Olwin B.B. p38 MAPK signaling underlies a cell-autonomous loss of stem cell self-renewal in skeletal muscle of aged mice.Nat.

Med. 2014; 20: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), several inhibitors of the p38MAPK pathway, including SB203580, were confirmed to increase satellite stem cell numbers in the screen (Figure 1C), validating that the screening platform reliably identified compounds capable of driving symmetric expansion of satellite stem cells. Several compounds effective in stimulating satellite stem cell expansion were inhibitors of the EGFR-Erbb or aurora kinase (Aurk) pathways (Figure 1C). Notably, lapatinib, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and clinically experienced EGFR-Erbb2 inhibitor, was identified as a lead compound. Furthermore, the top hit from the screen, ZM 449829, and its prodrug, ZM 39923 hydrochloride, have known inhibitory actions on EGFR (Brown et al., 2000Brown G.R. Bamford A.M. Bowyer J. James D.S. Rankine N. Tang E. Torr V. Culbert E.J. Naphthyl ketones: a new class of Janus kinase 3 inhibitors.Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2000; 10: 575-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Of the Aurk inhibitors, ZM 447439 and JNJ-7706621 are extensively studied inhibitors against both Aurka and Aurkb (Kollareddy et al., 2012Kollareddy M. Zheleva D. Dzubak P. Brahmkshatriya P.S. Lepsik M. Hajduch M. Aurora kinase inhibitors: progress towards the clinic.Invest. New Drugs. 2012; 30: 2411-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), whereas TC-A2317 is a VX-680 variant that exhibits higher specificity for Aurka (Ando et al., 2010Ando R. Ikegami H. Sakiyama M. Ooike S. Hayashi M. Fujino Y. Abe D. Nakamura H. Mishina T. Kato H. et al.3-Cyano-6-(5-methyl-3-pyrazoloamino)pyridines: selective Aurora A kinase inhibitors.Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2010; 20: 4709-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To identify specific gene targets of the EGFR-Erbb and Aurk inhibitors, we examined gene expression using microarray data (Bentzinger et al., 2013bBentzinger C.F. Wang Y.X. von Maltzahn J. Soleimani V.D. Yin H. Rudnicki M.A. Fibronectin regulates Wnt7a signaling and satellite cell expansion.Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 12: 75-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) to correlate the expression pattern of the EGFR-Erbb and Aurk family with possible regulatory function in satellite cell self-renewal. Only EGFR from the EGFR-Erbb family was highly expressed in freshly isolated satellite cells, whereas Erbb2, Erbb3, and Erbb4 were expressed at low levels (Figures 1D and S1D). This agrees with published data where EGFR protein is detectable in satellite cells and myoblasts but is lost in differentiation (Charville et al., 2015Charville G.W. Cheung T.H. Yoo B. Santos P.J. Lee G.K. Shrager J.B. Rando T.A. Ex Vivo Expansion and In Vivo Self-Renewal of Human Muscle Stem Cells.Stem Cell Reports. 2015; 5: 621-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, Olwin and Hauschka, 1988Olwin B.B. Hauschka S.D. Cell surface fibroblast growth factor and epidermal growth factor receptors are permanently lost during skeletal muscle terminal differentiation in culture.J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 761-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Aurka and Aurkb were expressed moderately in satellite cells. However, they were highly expressed in proliferating myoblasts, consistent with their function in regulating the cell cycle (Meraldi et al., 2004Meraldi P. Honda R. Nigg E.A. Aurora kinases link chromosome segregation and cell division to cancer susceptibility.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar; Figures 1D and S1E). Aurkc was only expressed late in differentiation (Figure 1D). This information suggested that EGFR, Aurka, and Aurkb are likely targets of the inhibitors identified in our screen. To confirm our lead compound activity in satellite cell asymmetric division and validate that our findings are not specific to FDB muscle satellite stem cells, we cultured satellite cells on myofibers isolated from extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles from Myf5-Cre/R26R-eYFP mice and monitored changes in cell proliferation and symmetric or asymmetric cell division. Inhibition of EGFR signaling resulted in a shift toward satellite stem cell symmetric division, as evidenced by an 83% decrease in the number of asymmetric divisions observed (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2A). This change in satellite stem cell division mode resulted in a 71% increase in the number of satellite stem cells (Figure 2C). Importantly, EGFR inhibition did not change the total numbers of satellite cells (Figure 2D), indicating that EGFR signaling does not affect cell proliferation. Similarly, we tested Aurka inhibition using TC-A2317 on single EDL myofibers isolated from Myf5-Cre/R26R-eYFP mice. Comparable with EGFR inhibition, TC-A2317 decreased the rate of asymmetric divisions by 74% (Figures 2E and 2F). This shift to symmetric divisions increased the number of satellite stem cells by 77% (Figure 2G). Consistently, inhibition of Aurka with TC-A2317 did not affect cell proliferation (Figure 2H). These results suggest that EGFR and Aurka signaling regulate the mode of satellite stem cell division. To investigate whether inhibition of EGFR or Aurka prevents myogenic differentiation generally, we treated differentiating primary myoblasts with lapatinib, TC-A2317, or vehicle controls. Interestingly, unlike satellite cells on myofibers, inhibition of EGFR signaling in differentiating myoblasts led to a slight increase in activation of the differentiation marker Myog (Figure S2B), consistent with reports regarding siRNA knockdown of EGFR in mouse and human myoblasts (Leroy et al., 2013Leroy M.C. Perroud J. Darbellay B. Bernheim L. Konig S. Epidermal growth factor receptor down-regulation triggers human myoblast differentiation.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e71770Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, Olwin and Hauschka, 1988Olwin B.B. Hauschka S.D. Cell surface fibroblast growth factor and epidermal growth factor receptors are permanently lost during skeletal muscle terminal differentiation in culture.J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 761-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Likewise, Aurka inhibition by TC-A2317 modestly increased the percentage of Myog-expressing cells (Figure S2B). These results suggest that EGFR and Aurka have different roles in satellite cell self-renewal and progenitor differentiation. To gain insight into the function of EGFR in satellite stem cell asymmetric division, we examined EGFR localization and activation in vitro and in vivo. Immunofluorescence on muscle sections revealed that EGFR protein is polarized to the basal surface of quiescent satellite cells (Figure 3A). To examine the signaling status of EGFR, we immunostained satellite cells on myofibers cultured in serum-free medium with and without EGF stimulation. In quiescent satellite cells, EGFR is inactive by immunostaining activated EGFR phosphorylated on Tyr1068 (p-EGFR) (Figure 3B). Following 1 h stimulation with EGF, activated p-EGFR was detected in most satellite cells (Figures 3B and 3C). In sublaminar satellite cells, p-EGFR was polarized in 63% of satellite cells (Figure 3C) localized to the basal surface on the opposite cortex to the myofiber (Figure S3B). Surprisingly, p-EGFR was restricted to a constrained streak-like domain (Figure 3B), and this polarized localization was maintained as satellite cells enter M phase (Figure 3D). p-EGFR is basolaterally localized in satellite cells on myofibers isolated and immediately fixed following injury-induced activation in vivo (Figure 3E; Video S1). In injured muscle, p-EGFR and Aurka follow the expression pattern of Pax7, peaking between 3–7 days of regeneration (Figure 3F). Early activation of EGFR and Aurka correlates with expansion of the proliferating satellite cell population (Dumont et al., 2015bDumont N.A. Wang Y.X. von Maltzahn J. Pasut A. Bentzinger C.F. Brun C.E. Rudnicki M.A. Dystrophin expression in muscle stem cells regulates their polarity and asymmetric division.Nat. Med. 2015; 21 (advance online publication): 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), and expression of Myog in differentiating myogenic progenitors (Figure 3F). Together, this suggests that basally localized EGFR primes satellite stem cells for asymmetric divisions. eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIyZGZlZThiYzk5M2IwNzM0ZTlhNDQ1ZWMyNWFlMDJjYyIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4NTgxNDQ3fQ.XRLIEvQpBpCYf9Y6MozP1xfkPw62pgi-44zNbe6FMONCeVjWvWLwffykGoHXiz7eRk9bylEdKNo57t5X4X2ztXos94yGQ8-9fZ_Q3vFXFqDAfyeCKdJ4OC46sdaKiaaioLvDrUJFaI-kughc7ax_W7XKIAs_bvXgucowI5jlab6VE5sdZlkHrpN4HgzLmbOesMr5BS-0gEdj0npx7ny8NYWmNspOnTcU-sYIkecWtR4dKYfWRd_YPLTgRukcQadS2ieKyhiumzPZrTACdImep58GFy6Hr3m2z0s7bOE8ULq-yb-kuhAMMIJJZUQDvq4ciygmS1L4szVHmsl4lgAC5g Download .mp4 (2 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S1. 3D Reconstruction of a Satellite Cell Expressing Polarized p-EGFR 2 Days after Injury, Related to Figure 3Myofibers were stained for DAPI (blue), Pax7 (red), and p-EGFR (green). The series of pictures was taken by confocal microscopy and reconstructed into a 3D image using ImageJ. To investigate whether EGFR activation is a driver of asymmetric division, EGF was added to cultures of single EDL myofibers isolated from Myf5-Cre/R26R-eYFP mice. Strikingly, EGF treatment increased the asymmetric satellite stem cell division rate 2.5-fold (Figure 3G). EGFR signaling can orient the mitotic axis of polarized epithelial MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cells along the apicobasal axis (Bañón-Rodríguez et al., 2014Bañón-Rodríguez I. Gálvez-Santisteban M. Vergarajauregui S. Bosch M. Borreguero-Pascual A. Martín-Belmonte F. EGFR controls IQGAP basolateral membrane localization and mitotic spindle orientation during epithelial morphogenesis.EMBO J. 2014; 33: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Moreover, asymmetric satellite cell divisions occur in an apicobasal orientation (Kuang et al., 2007Kuang S. Kuroda K. Le Grand F. Rudnicki M.A. Asymmetric self-renewal and commitment of satellite stem cells in muscle.Cell. 2007; 129: 999-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). Therefore, single EDL myofibers were cultured for 36 h, and satellite cell centrosomes were detected by immunostaining for phosphorylated Aurk (p-Aurk). Importantly, EGF increased the proportion of total mitotic satellite cells along the apicobasal axis by 50% (Figure 3H). We did not observe changes to the proliferation rate of satellite cells at 36 h with EGF, around 5% of cells undergoing mitosis were marked by p-Aurk staining (Figures S3C and S3D). Moreover, there was no change in the rate of S phase entry in eYFPPos or eYFPNeg satellite cell populations following EGF treatment, as determined by EdU (5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine) incorporation over the first 20h of culture (Figure 3I). To confirm the specific effect of EGFR signaling, siRNA against EGFR (siEGFR) was transfect into satellite cells on single EDL myofibers from Myf5-Cre/R26R-eYFP mice. Similar to inhibition with lapatinib, siEGFR reduced the rate of asymmetric division by 65% compared with scrambled siRNA (siSCR) (Figure 3J). Transfection of siEGFR also increased the rate of symmetric division and increased satellite stem cell numbers by 76% (Figures 3K and 3L). This suggests that EGF can change mitotic orientation by recruitment of centrosomes along polarized p-EGFR in satellite cells. To test whether EGF acts independently of cell polarity by activating Myf5 expression or enforcing myogenic commitment, we studied the effect of EGF on satellite stem cell-derived myoblasts in culture. Real-time qPCR showed no change in Myf5 (eYFP) activation in cultured myoblasts derived from eYFPPos or eYFPNeg satellite cells from Myf5-Cre/R26R-eYFP mice (Figures S3H and S3I). Importantly, EGF did not promote eYFP protein expression in eYFPNeg myoblasts (Figure S3J). These data support our hypothesis that polarized EGFR in satellite cells promotes apicobasal division within the myofiber niche. To explore whether EGFR signaling affects Myf5Neg satellite stem cells, Myf5Pos committed satellite cells, or myoblasts in vivo, we crossed the Myf5-Cre allele with a ROSA26R-nTnG allele (Prigge et al., 2013Prigge, J.R., Wiley, J.A., Talago, E.A., Young, E.M., Johns, L.L., Kundert, J.A., Sonsteng, K.M., Halford, W.P., Capecchi, M.R., and Schmidt, E.E.

Isolation of nTdTPos satellite cells (Myf5Neg) and nGFPPos satellite cells (Myf5Pos) allows us to determine the outcome of asymmetric division following transplantation, where nTdT satellite cells undergoing asymmetric division give rise to one nGFPPos myogenic progenitor and one nTdTPos satellite stem cell (Figures S4A–S4E). We observed that nTdTPos satellite cells gave rise to roughly 3-fold higher engraftment as Pax7-expressing satellite cells compared with nGFPPos satellite cells (Figures 4B and 4C ), consistent with our previous report (Kuang et al., 2007Kuang S. Kuroda K. Le Grand F. Rudnicki M.A. Asymmetric self-renewal and commitment of satellite stem cells in muscle.Cell. 2007; 129: 999-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). By contrast, nGFPPos satellite cell-derived myoblasts from the same donors lost all self-renewal capacity and failed to engraft as Pax7-expressing satellite cells despite injecting a 10-fold higher number of cells (Figure 4D). Strikingly, treatment of nTdTPos satellite cells with EGF for 3 h following isolation increased nGFPPos progeny and facilitated engraftment as nGFPPos satellite cells (Figure 4B). This enhanced differentiation as myonuclei by roughly 3-fold while maintaining stem cell self-renewal. Furthermore, consistent with our findings in ex vivo myofiber and primary myoblast culture, EGF had n"

Most previously introduced models have approximated media effect through disease incidence, making media influence dependent on the size of epidemic. We propose an alternative approach, which relies on real data about disease coverage in the news, allowing us to model low incidence/high interest diseases, such as SARS, Ebola or H1N1. We introduce a network-based model, in which disease is transmitted through local interactions between individuals and the probability of transmission is affected by media coverage. We assume that media attention increases self-protection (e.g. hand washing and compliance with social distancing), which, in turn, decreases disease model. We apply the model to the case of H1N1 transmission in Mexico City in 2009 and show how media influence-measured by the time series of the weekly count of news articles published on the outbreak-helps to explain the observed transmission dynamics. We show that incorporating the media attention based on the observed media coverage of the outbreak better estimates the disease dynamics from what would be predicted by using media function that approximate the media impact using the number of cases and rate of spread. Finally, we apply the model to a typical influenza season in Washington, DC and estimate how the transmission pattern would have changed given different levels of media coverage."
https://openalex.org/W2914848079,"Background and aims Automated recording of laboratory animal’s home cage behavior is receiving increasing attention since such non-intruding surveillance will aid in the unbiased understanding of animal cage behavior potentially improving animal experimental reproducibility. Material and methods Here we investigate activity of group held female C57BL/6J mice (mus musculus) housed in standard Individually Ventilated Cages across three test-sites: Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR, Rome, Italy), The Jackson Laboratory (JAX, Bar Harbor, USA) and Karolinska Insititutet (KI, Stockholm, Sweden). Additionally, comparison of female and male C57BL/6J mice was done at KI. Activity was recorded using a capacitive-based sensor placed non-intrusively on the cage rack under the home cage collecting activity data every 250 msec, 24/7. The data collection was analyzed using non-parametric analysis of variance for longitudinal data comparing sites, weekdays and sex. Results The system detected an increase in activity preceding and peaking around lights-on followed by a decrease to a rest pattern. At lights off, activity increased substantially displaying a distinct temporal variation across this period. We also documented impact on mouse activity that standard animal handling procedures have, e.g. cage-changes, and show that such procedures are stressors impacting in-cage activity. These key observations replicated across the three test-sites, however, it is also clear that, apparently minor local environmental differences generate significant behavioral variances between the sites and within sites across weeks. Comparison of gender revealed differences in activity in the response to cage-change lasting for days in male but not female mice; and apparently also impacting the response to other events such as lights-on in males. Females but not males showed a larger tendency for week-to-week variance in activity possibly reflecting estrous cycling. Conclusions These data demonstrate that home cage monitoring is scalable and run in real time, providing complementary information for animal welfare measures, experimental design and phenotype characterization."
https://openalex.org/W2914612812,"Epileptic seizures are frequent in patients with glioblastoma, and anticonvulsive treatment is often necessary. While clinical guidelines recommend all approved anticonvulsants, so far it is still unclear which of the available drugs is the best therapeutic option for treating glioma-associated seizures, also in view of possible anti-tumorigenic effects. In our study, we employed four patient-derived low-passage cell lines of glioblastoma and three cell lines of brain metastases, and challenged these cultures with four anticonvulsants with different mechanisms of action: levetiracetam, valproic acid, carbamazepine and perampanel. Cell proliferation was determined by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. To further analyze the effects of perampanel, apoptosis induction was measured by caspase 3/7 activation. Glutamate release was quantified and glucose uptake was determined using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was employed to assess the expression of genes associated with glutamate release and uptake in brain tumor cells. Of the four anticonvulsants, only perampanel showed systematic inhibitory effects on cell proliferation, whereas all other anticonvulsants failed to inhibit glioma and metastasis cell growth in vitro. Metastasis cells were much more resistant to perampanel than glioblastoma cell lines. Glucose uptake was attenuated in all glioblastoma cells after perampanel exposure, whereas cell death via apoptosis was not induced. Extracellular glutamate levels were found to be significantly higher in glioblastoma cell lines as compared to metastasis cell lines, but could be reduced by perampanel exposure. Incubation with perampanel up-regulated glutamine synthetase expression in glioblastoma cells, whereas treatment with valproic acid and levetiracetam downregulated excitatory amino acid transporter-2 expression. Overall, our data suggest that perampanel acts as an anticonvulsive drug and additionally mediated anti-tumorigenic effects."
https://openalex.org/W2914071752,"Wheat landraces, wild relatives and other ‘exotic’ accessions are important sources of new favorable alleles. The use of those exotic alleles is facilitated by having access to information on the association of specific genomic regions with desirable traits. Here, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a wheat panel that includes landraces, synthetic hexaploids and other exotic wheat accessions to identify loci that contribute to increases in grain yield in southern Australia. The 568 accessions were grown in the field during the 2014 and 2015 seasons and measured for plant height, maturity, spike length, spike number, grain yield, plant biomass, HI and TGW. We used the 90K SNP array and two GWAS approaches (GAPIT and QTCAT) to identify loci associated with the different traits. We identified 17 loci with GAPIT and 25 with QTCAT. Ten of these loci were associated with known genes that are routinely employed in marker assisted selection such as Ppd-D1 for maturity and Rht-D1 for plant height and seven of those were detected with both methods. We identified one locus for yield per se in 2014 on chromosome 6B with QTCAT and three in 2015, on chromosomes 4B and 5A with GAPIT and 6B with QTCAT. The 6B loci corresponded to the same region in both years. The favorable haplotypes for yield at the 5A and 6B loci are widespread in Australian accessions with 112 out of 153 carrying the favorable haplotype at the 5A locus and 136 out of 146 carrying the favorable haplotype at the 6A locus, while the favorable haplotype at 4B is only present in 65 out of 149 Australian accessions. The low number of yield QTL in our study corroborate with other GWAS for yield in wheat, where most of the identified loci have very small effects."
https://openalex.org/W2913555931,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the disparities in the outcomes of White, African American (AA) and non-AA minority (Hispanics and Native Americans (NA)), patients admitted in the hospitals with diabetic foot infections (DFIs).The HCUP-Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2002 to 2015) was queried to identify patients who were admitted to the hospital for management of DFI using ICD-9 codes. Outcomes evaluated included minor and major amputations, open or endovascular revascularization, and hospital length of stay (LOS). Incidence for amputation and open or endovascular revascularization were evaluated over the study period. Multivariable regression analyses were performed to assess the association between race/ethnicity and outcomes.There were 150,701 admissions for DFI, including 98,361 Whites, 24,583 AAs, 24,472 Hispanics, and 1,654 Native Americans (NAs) in the study cohort. Overall, 45,278 (30%) underwent a minor amputation, 9,039 (6%) underwent a major amputation, 3,151 underwent an open bypass, and 8,689 had an endovascular procedure. There was a decreasing incidence in major amputations and an increasing incidence of minor amputations over the study period (P < .05). The risks for major amputation were significantly higher (all p<0.05) for AA (OR 1.4, 95%CI 1.4,1.5), Hispanic (OR 1.3, 95%CI 1.3,1.4), and NA (OR 1.5, 95%CI 1.2,1.8) patients with DFIs compared to White patients. Hispanics (OR 1.3, 95%CI 1.2,1.5) and AAs (OR 1.2, 95%CI 1.1,1.4) were more likely to receive endovascular intervention or open bypass than Whites (all p<0.05). NA patients with DFI were less likely to receive a revascularization procedure (OR 0.6, 95%CI 0.3, 0.9, p = 0.03) than Whites. The mean hospital length of stay (LOS) was significantly longer for AAs (9.2 days) and Hispanics (8.6 days) with DFIs compared to Whites (8.1 days, p<0.001).Despite a consistent incidence reduction of amputation over the past decade, racial and ethnic minorities including African American, Hispanic, and Native American patients admitted to hospitals with DFIs have a consistently significantly higher risk of major amputation and longer hospital length of stay than their White counterparts. Native Americans were less likely to receive revascularization procedures compared to other minorities despite exhibiting an elevated risk of an amputation. Further study is required to address and limit racial and ethnic disparities and to further promote equity in the treatment and outcomes of these at-risk patients."
https://openalex.org/W2911511362,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common neurovascular complication of type 1 diabetes. Current therapeutics target neovascularization characteristic of end-stage disease, but are associated with significant adverse effects. Targeting early events of DR such as neurodegeneration may lead to safer and more effective approaches to treatment. Two independent prospective clinical trials unexpectedly identified that the PPARα agonist fenofibrate had unprecedented therapeutic effects in DR, but gave little insight into the physiological and molecular mechanisms of action. The objective of the present study was to evaluate potential neuroprotective effects of PPARα in DR, and subsequently to identify the responsible mechanism of action. Here we reveal that activation of PPARα had a robust protective effect on retinal function as shown by Optokinetic tracking in a rat model of type 1 diabetes, and also decreased retinal cell death, as demonstrated by a DNA fragmentation ELISA. Further, PPARα ablation exacerbated diabetes-induced decline of visual function as demonstrated by ERG analysis. We further found that PPARα improved mitochondrial efficiency in DR, and decreased ROS production and cell death in cultured retinal neurons. Oxidative stress biomarkers were elevated in diabetic Pparα-/- mice, suggesting increased oxidative stress. Mitochondrially mediated apoptosis and oxidative stress secondary to mitochondrial dysfunction contribute to neurodegeneration in DR. Taken together, these findings identify a robust neuroprotective effect for PPARα in DR, which may be due to improved mitochondrial function and subsequent alleviation of energetic deficits, oxidative stress and mitochondrially mediated apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2914408087,"Objective To study age and sex specific prevalence of 30 symptoms in random samples from the general population and to analyze possible secular trends across time. Study population The study was based on data from eight on-going Swedish cohort studies, with baseline investigations performed between 1973 and 2003. Samples were drawn from the general population of the cities of Gothenburg and Eskilstuna, and of Uppsala County. Overall, 20,160 subjects were sampled, 14,470 (71.8%) responded, of whom 12.000 were unique subjects, and 2548 were part of more than one sample. Methods The Complaint score sub-scale of the Gothenburg Quality of Life instrument, listing 30 general symptoms was used. Responders were asked to indicate which symptoms they had experienced during the last three months. Results Women reported on average 7.8 symptoms, and men 5.3 (p<0.0001). Women reported higher prevalence than men for 24 of the 30 symptoms. In multivariate analyses four patterns of prevalence across age were identified in both men and women; increasing prevalence, decreasing, stable and biphasic prevalence. The symptoms in the various pattern groups differed somewhat between men and women. However, symptoms related to strain were prominent among symptoms decreasing with age. Moreover, there were secular trends. Across all symptoms reporting prevalence increased over time in men (p<0.001) as well as in women (p<0.0001). Conclusions Women reported higher total symptom prevalence than men. Symptoms related to health generally increased with age, while symptoms related to stress decreased markedly. Significant secular trends across time regarding symptom prevalence were found."
https://openalex.org/W2913563375,"Background Policy makers in aging societies aim for the extension of work lives by increasing the official retirement age. Despite these efforts, many people stop working before reaching this retirement age. The main reason for early retirement is poor health. Health in turn is influenced by exposure to the work environment. Furthermore, health and work stress are influenced by education, which may lead to different effects for the lowly and the highly educated. Objective This study examines the relationship between work stress and retirement age. It investigates whether this relationship is mediated by health and moderated by education. Three dimensions of health are taken into account: self-rated health (SRH), depressive symptoms, and high cardiovascular risk diseases (HCVR). Methods A German subsample of the longitudinal Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) was linked with register data of the German Public Pension Scheme (SHARE-RV). The sample followed 302 individuals aged 50 to 65 years at baseline from 2004 to 2014. The data contains information on work stress, measured by job control and effort–reward–imbalance (ERI), health, and age of retirement. Multi-group structural equation modeling was applied to analyze the direct and indirect effects of work stress on retirement age via health. Work stress was lagged so that it temporally preceded health and retirement age. Results Lower job control and poorer SRH lead to a lower retirement age. Health does not operate as a mediator in the relationship between work stress and retirement age. Education moderates the relationship between work stress and health: high ERI leads to better SRH and better physical health of higher educated persons. Low job control increases the risk of depressive symptoms for persons with less education. Conclusions Improving stressful working conditions, particularly improving job control, can prolong the working lives of employees and postpone retirement."
https://openalex.org/W2913673181,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses HIV replication, but does not cure the infection because replication-competent virus persists within latently infected CD4+ T cells throughout years of therapy. These reservoirs contain integrated HIV-1 genomes and can resupply active virus. Thus, the development of strategies to eliminate the reservoir of latently infected cells is a research priority of global significance. In this study, we tested efficacy of a new inhibitor of apoptosis protein antagonist (IAPa) called Debio 1143 at reversing HIV latency and investigated its mechanisms of action. Debio 1143 activates HIV transcription via NF-kB signaling by degrading the ubiquitin ligase baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 2 (BIRC2), a repressor of the non-canonical NF-kB pathway. Debio 1143-induced BIRC2 degradation results in the accumulation of NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and proteolytic cleavage of p100 into p52, leading to nuclear translocation of p52 and RELB. Debio 1143 greatly enhances the binding of RELB to the HIV-1 LTR. These data indicate that Debio 1143 activates the non-canonical NF-kB signaling pathway by promoting the binding of RELB:p52 complexes to the HIV-1 LTR, resulting in the activation of the LTR-dependent HIV-1 transcription. Importantly, Debio 1143 reverses viral latency in HIV-1 latent T cell lines. Using knockdown (siRNA BIRC2), knockout (CRIPSR NIK) and proteasome machinery neutralization (MG132) approaches, we found that Debio 1143-mediated HIV latency reversal is BIRC2 degradation- and NIK stabilization-dependent. Debio 1143 also reverses HIV-1 latency in resting CD4+ T cells derived from ART-treated patients or HIV-1-infected humanized mice under ART. Interestingly, daily oral administration of Debio 1143 in cancer patients at well-tolerated doses elicited BIRC2 target engagement in PBMCs and induced a moderate increase in cytokines and chemokines mechanistically related to NF-kB signaling. In conclusion, we provide strong evidences that the IAPa Debio 1143, by initially activating the non-canonical NF-kB signaling and subsequently reactivating HIV-1 transcription, represents a new attractive viral latency reversal agent (LRA)."
https://openalex.org/W2912355901,"Three aligned, electrospun fiber scaffolds with unique surface features were created from poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA). Fibers without surface nanotopography (smooth fibers), fibers with surface divots (shallow pits), and fibers with surface pits (deeper pits) were fabricated, and fiber alignment, diameter, and density were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Whole dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were isolated from rats and placed onto uncoated fibers or fibers coated with laminin. On uncoated fibers, neurite outgrowth was restricted by fibers displaying divoted or pitted nanotopography when compared to neurite outgrowth on smooth fibers. However, neurites extending from whole DRG cultured on laminin-coated fibers were not restricted by divoted or pitted surface nanotopography. Thus, neurites extending on laminin-coated fibers were able to extend long neurites even in the presence of surface divots or pits. To further explore this result, individual neurons isolated from dissociated DRG were seeded onto laminin-coated smooth, pitted, or divoted fibers. Interestingly, neurons on pitted or divoted fibers exhibited a 1.5-fold increase in total neurite length, and a 2.3 or 2.7-fold increase in neurite branching compared to neurons on smooth fibers, respectively. Based on these findings, we conclude that fiber roughness in the form of pits or divots can promote extension and branching of long neurites along aligned electrospun fibers in the presence of an extracellular matrix protein coating. Thus, aligned, electrospun fibers can be crafted to not only direct the extension of axons but to induce unique branching morphologies."

Progressive sensory loss can predispose patients to foot ulcer and the neuropathy oftentimes causes pain. The pain can significantly affect the quality of life of patients.To describes the health-related quality of life of patients with type II diabetes mellitus suffering from painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy at two referral hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 2017.An institution based cross sectional study with internal comparison was conducted among a sample of 220 type II diabetes mellitus patients in a 1:1 matched ratio of those with and without diabetes associated peripheral neuropathic pain. All were having regular follow up at two hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The Short Form (SF-36) health-related quality of life instrument was used to collect data on quality of life while basic socio-demographic and other disease specific features were collected using a structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics was used to examine the mean scores of health related quality of life. Cronbach's alpha coefficient and Pearson's correlation coefficient were applied to estimate the internal consistency, and the level of agreement between the different domains of SF-36, respectively. To measure association between health related quality of life domains and explanatory variables, independent T-test and ANOVA were performed followed by multiple linear regression analyses.The health related quality of life of type II diabetes mellitus patients with peripheral neuropathic pain was poorer than those without pain in all the eight domains and the two summary scores by SF-36 (p < 0.001). Higher mean score difference was observed in Mental Component Summary Score (MCS) (14.6) compared to Physical Component Score (PCS) (9.3). Among the eight domains, the largest mean difference was found with the physical one (39.1) followed by mental health (38.2) and physical functioning (30). Pain intensity had a statistically significant negative correlation with all domains as well as the two summary scores. Younger age, a higher level of education, being single, a higher monthly income, normal body mass index, HbA1c less than seven mmo/L, absence of other diabetic complications and taking only oral hypoglycemic agents were found to predict better health related quality of life.The presence of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain was found to negatively influence the health-related quality of life of type II diabetic patients; the greatest impact being on the 'role physical' and 'mental health' domains. Older age, presence of diabetes related complications, longer duration of illness negatively influenced the health-related quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W2914186638,"BAP1 is a tumor suppressor gene important to the development and prognosis of many cancers, especially uveal melanoma (UM). Its role in more common cancers such as breast and colon cancer is largely unknown. We collected the transcriptome profiling data sets from the TCGA uveal melanoma (TCGA-UVM), breast cancer (TCGA-BRCA), and colon cancer (TCGA-COAD) projects to analyze the expression of BAP1. We found that patients with UM and breast cancer, but not colon cancer, who died had a lower level of BAP1 gene expression compared to surviving patients. Importantly, in breast cancer patients, the lowest BAP1 expression levels corresponded to the dead young patients (age at diagnosis < 46). Since the number of cases in TCGA-BRCA was much higher than TCGA-UVM, we obtained highly correlated genes with BAP1 in invasive breast carcinomas. Then, we tested if these genes are also highly correlated with BAP1 in UM and colon cancer. We found that BAP1 is highly positively correlated with RBM15B and USP19 expression in invasive breast carcinoma, UM, and colon adenocarcinoma. All three genes are located in close proximity on the 3p21 tumor suppressor region that is commonly altered in many cancers."

Only a fraction of the chloroplast (cp) genome data of Artemisia has been reported and chloroplast genomic materials have been widely used in genomic evolution studies, molecular marker development, and phylogenetic analysis of the genus Artemisia, which makes evolutionary studies, genetic improvement, and phylogenetic identification very difficult. In this study, the complete chloroplast genome of A. selengensis was compared with that of other species within Artemisia and phylogenetic analyses was conducted with other genera in the Asteraceae family. The results showed that A. selengensis is an AT-rich species and has a typical quadripartite structure that is 151,215 bp in length. Comparative genome analyses demonstrated that the available chloroplast genomes of species of Artemisia were well conserved in terms of genomic length, GC contents, and gene organization and order. However, some differences, which may indicate evolutionary events, were found, such as a re-inversion event within the Artemisia genus, an unequal duplicate phenomenon of the ycf1 gene because of the expansion and contraction of the IR region, and the fast-evolving regions. Repeated sequences analysis showed that Artemisia chloroplast genomes presented a highly similar pattern of SSR or LDR distribution. A total of 257 SSRs and 42 LDRs were identified in the A. selengensis chloroplast genome. The phylogenetic analysis showed that A. selengensis was sister to A. gmelinii. The findings of this study will be valuable in further studies to understand the genetic diversity and evolutionary history of Asteraceae."
https://openalex.org/W2911609224,"Classical Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (cEDS) is a dominant inherited connective tissue disorder mainly caused by mutations in the COL5A1 and COL5A2 genes encoding type V collagen (COLLV), which is a fibrillar COLL widely distributed in a variety of connective tissues. cEDS patients suffer from skin hyperextensibility, abnormal wound healing/atrophic scars, and joint hypermobility. Most of the causative variants result in a non-functional COL5A1 allele and COLLV haploinsufficiency, whilst COL5A2 mutations affect its structural integrity. To shed light into disease mechanisms involved in cEDS, we performed gene expression profiling in skin fibroblasts from four patients harboring haploinsufficient and structural mutations in both disease genes. Transcriptome profiling revealed significant changes in the expression levels of different extracellular matrix (ECM)-related genes, such as SPP1, POSTN, EDIL3, IGFBP2, and C3, which encode both matricellular and soluble proteins that are mainly involved in cell proliferation and migration, and cutaneous wound healing. These gene expression changes are consistent with our previous protein findings on in vitro fibroblasts from other cEDS patients, which exhibited reduced migration and poor wound repair owing to COLLV disorganization, altered deposition of fibronectin into ECM, and an abnormal integrin pattern. Microarray analysis also indicated the decreased expression of DNAJB7, VIPAS39, CCPG1, ATG10, SVIP, which encode molecular chaperones facilitating protein folding, enzymes regulating post-Golgi COLLs processing, and proteins acting as cargo receptors required for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis and implicated in the autophagy process. Patients’ cells also showed altered mRNA levels of many cell cycle regulating genes including CCNE2, KIF4A, MKI67, DTL, and DDIAS. Protein studies showed that aberrant COLLV expression causes the disassembly of itself and many structural ECM constituents including COLLI, COLLIII, fibronectin, and fibrillins. Our findings provide the first molecular evidence of significant gene expression changes in cEDS skin fibroblasts highlighting that defective ECM remodeling, ER homeostasis and autophagy might play a role in the pathogenesis of this connective tissue disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2911882972,"The majority of compressive vertebral fractures in osteoporotic bone occur at the level of the thoracolumbar junction. Immediate decompression is often required in order to reduce the extent of neurological damage. This study evaluated four fixation methods for decompression in patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures, and presented the most suitable method for osteoporotic patients. A finite element model of a T7–L5 spinal segment was created and subjected to an L1 corpectomy to simulate a serious burst fracture. Five models were tested: a) intact spine; 2) two segment fixation (TSF), 3) up-three segment fixation (UTSF), below-three segment fixation (BTSF), and four segment fixation (FSF). The ROM, stiffness and compression ratio of the fractured vertebra were recorded under various loading conditions. The results of this study showed that the ROM of the FSF model was the lowest, and the ROMs of UTSF and BTSF models were similar but still greater than the TSF model. Decreasing the BMD to simulate osteoporotic bone resulted in a ROM for the four instrumented models that was higher than the normal bone model. Of all models, the FSF model had the highest stiffness at T12-L2 in extension and lateral bending. Similarly, the compression ratio of the FSF model at L1 was also higher than the other instrumented models. In conclusion, FSF fixation is suggested for patients with osteoporotic thoracolumbar burst fractures. For patients with normal bone quality, both UTSF and BTSF fixation provide an acceptable stiffness in extension and lateral bending, as well as a favorable compression ratio at L1."
https://openalex.org/W2914099268,"Centrosome-associated protein E (CENPE) is a plus end-directed kinetochore motor protein, which plays a critical role in mitosis. In this in silico study, using data from the Cancer Genome Atlas-Esophageal Carcinoma (TCGA-ESCA), we analyzed the expression profile of CENPE mRNA in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and adenocarcinoma (EA), its independent prognostic value and the potential mechanisms of its dysregulation in EA. Results showed that both ESCC and EA tissues had significantly elevated CENPE expression compared with their respective adjacent normal tissues. However, Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that high CENPE was associated with unfavorable OS in EA. Univariate and multivariate analysis confirmed that CENPE expression was an independent indicator of unfavorable OS in EA patients, as a continuous variable (HR: 1.861, 95%CI: 1.235-2.806, p = 0.003) or as categorical variables (HR: 2.550, 95%CI: 1.294-5.025, p = 0.007). However, CENPE expression had no prognostic value in ESCC. Compared with the methylation status in normal samples, 3 CpG sites were hypomethylated (cg27388036, cg27443373, and cg24651824) in EA, among which two sites (cg27443373 and cg24651824) showed moderately negative correlation with CENPE expression. In addition, we also found that although heterozygous loss (-1) was frequent in EA (50/88, 56.8%), it was not necessarily associated with decreased CENPE expression compared with the copy neutral (0) cases. The methylation of the -1 group was significantly lower than that of the +1/0 group (p = 0.04). Based on these findings, we infer that CENPE upregulation in EA might serve as a valuable indicator of unfavorable OS. The methylation status of cg27443373 and cg24651824 might play a critical role in modulating CENPE expression."

We aim to describe the epidemiology of carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPOs), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in Norway, measure the importance of infections contracted abroad, and assess the morbidity and mortality associated with these resistant bacteria in Norway.We used data from the Norwegian surveillance system for communicable diseases covering all findings of the selected resistant bacteria including both infections and colonisation, in the period 2006-2017. Annual trends were assessed using negative binomial regression. For MRSA, we were able to calculate the Morisita-Horn index and transmission numbers following importation in order to assess the effect this had on further domestic transmission.The incidence rates (per 100,000 personyears) of the three groups of resistant bacteria have increased during the period. In 2017 the incidence rates were 0.82 for CPOs, 7.09 for VRE and 43.8 for MRSA. 81% of CPO cases were diagnosed in hospitals, but 73% were infected abroad. Most VRE cases were infected in Norwegian hospitals, 85% were associated with hospitals outbreaks. MRSA was predominantly diagnosed in the community, only 21% were diagnosed in hospitals. Of all MRSA cases, 35% were infected in other countries. Most MRSA spa-types were not identified again after introduction, resulting in a transmission of MRSA equivalent to a mean of 0.30 persons infected from each spa-type identified (range: 0-22). The proportion of infections among all notified cases within each diagnose was 44% for MRSA, 9% for VRE and 45% for CPOs. Among persons notified with bacteraemia, the 30 days all-cause mortality were 20%, 16% and 50% for MRSA, VRE and CPOs respectively.The incidence rates of CPOs, VRE and MRSA in Norway are low, but increasing. The continuing increase of notified resistant bacteria highlights the need for a revision of existing infection prevention and control guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W2912269756,"The Aquatic Eddy Covariance (AEC) technique has emerged as an important method to quantify in situ seafloor metabolism over large areas of heterogeneous benthic communities, enabling cross-habitat comparisons of seafloor productivity. However, the lack of a corresponding sampling protocol to perform biodiversity comparisons across habitats is impeding a full assessment of marine ecosystem metabolism. Here, we study a range of coastal benthic habitats, from rocky-bed communities defined by either perennial macroalgae or blue mussel beds to soft-sediment communities comprised of either seagrass, patches of different macrophyte species or bare sand. We estimated that the maximum contribution to the AEC metabolic flux can be found for a seafloor area of approximately 80 m2 with a 5 meter upstream distance of the instrument across all the habitats. We conducted a sampling approach to characterize and quantify the dominant features of biodiversity (i.e., community biomass) within the main seafloor area of maximum metabolic contribution (i.e., gross primary production and community respiration) measured by the AEC. We documented a high biomass contribution of the macroalgal Fucus vesiculosus, the seagrass Zostera marina and the macroinvertebrate Mytilus edulis to the net ecosystem metabolism of the habitats. We also documented a significant role of the bare sediments for primary productivity compared to vegetated canopies of the soft sediments. The AEC also provided insight into dynamic short-term drivers of productivity such as PAR availability and water flow velocity for the productivity estimate. We regard this study as an important step forward, setting a framework for upcoming research focusing on linking biodiversity metrics and AEC flux measurements across habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2912272136,"Healthy repair of cutaneous injury is a coordinated response of inflammatory cells, secreted factors, and biologically active extracellular vesicles (EVs). Although constitutive release of EVs into biologic fluids is a hallmark of cultured cells and tumors, their payload and biologic activity appears to be tightly regulated. We show that Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16 (TBC1) domain family member 3 (TBC1D3) drives the release of an EV population that causes a decrease in phosphorylation of the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 in naive recipient cells. To explore the biologic activity of EVs in vivo, we used a mouse model of sterile subcutaneous inflammation to determine the payload and biologic activity of EVs released into the microenvironment by committed myeloid lineages and stroma. Expression of TBC1D3 in macrophages altered the payload of their released EVs, including RNA-binding proteins, molecular motors, and proteins regulating secretory pathways. A wound-healing model demonstrated that closure was delayed by EVs released under the control of TBC1D3. We show that modulating the secretory repertoire of a cell regulates EV payload and biologic activity that affects outcomes in tissue repair and establishes a strategy for modifying EVs mediating specific biologic responses.-Qin, S., Dorschner, R. A., Masini, I., Lavoie-Gagne, O., Stahl, P. D., Costantini, T. W., Baird, A., Eliceiri, B. P.

https://openalex.org/W2914359747,"Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) is a very important leafy vegetable in China and is commonly grown using furrow irrigation. In order to improve production efficiency, greenhouse experiments were conducted at Experimental Station, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China using furrow irrigation (FI), micro-sprinkler irrigation (MS), plastic film mulching irrigation (PF) and a combined plastic film mulching–micro-sprinkler irrigation system (PF+MS) to study their effects on soil physical characteristics, water distribution, root morpho-physiological traits, nutrition absorption, lettuce yield and water use efficiency for a spring crop and autumn crop in 2015 (Fig 1). Root length, root surface area, and root density were significantly higher under PF and PF+MS than under FI. Moreover, these traits were higher under MS than under FI but these differences were not significant. The soluble protein, soluble sugar, and Vitamin C content of lettuce decreased in the order PF+MS > PF > MS > FI in both crops. In the spring crop, the biological yield of MS, PF, and PF+MS was 7.22%、36.77%、43.20% higher than FI, respectively. In the spring crop, biological water use efficiency (BWUE) of FI, MS, PF and PF+MS was 20.93, 25.24, 36.81 and 38.54 kg m−3, respectively. The BWUE of MS, PF, and PF+MS was 20.59%, 75.87% and 84.14% higher than FI. Economic water use efficiency (EWUE) of FI, MS, PF and PF+MS was 17.06, 21.31, 31.11 and 32.31 kg m−3, respectively. The EWUE of MS, PF, and PF+MS was 24.91%, 82.36% and 89.39% higher than FI, respectively. The autumn crop achieved a higher WUE than the spring crop. The results suggested that the combined plastic film mulching-micro-sprinkler irrigation was the most suitable irrigation approach for increasing lettuce yield."
https://openalex.org/W2949837772,"Symbiosis between Bathymodiolus and Gammaproteobacteria allows these deep-sea mussels to live in toxic environments such as hydrothermal vents and cold seeps. The quantity of endosymbionts within the gill-bacteriocytes appears to vary according to the hosts environment; however, the mechanisms of endosymbiont population size regulation remain obscure. We investigated the possibility of a control of endosymbiont density by apoptosis, a programmed cell death, in three mussel species. Fluorometric TUNEL and active Caspase-3-targeting antibodies were used to visualize and quantify apoptotic cells in mussel gills. To control for potential artefacts due to depressurization upon specimen recovery from the deep-sea, the apoptotic rates between mussels recovered unpressurised, versus mussels recovered in a pressure-maintaining device, were compared in two species from hydrothermal vents on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge: Bathymodiolus azoricus and B. puteoserpentis. Results show that pressurized recovery had no significant effect on the apoptotic rate in the gill filaments. Apoptotic levels were highest in the ciliated zone and in the circulating hemocytes, compared to the bacteriocyte zone. Apoptotic gill-cells in B. aff. boomerang from cold seeps off the Gulf of Guinea show similar distribution patterns. Deep-sea symbiotic mussels have much higher rates of apoptosis in their gills than the coastal mussel Mytilus edulis, which lacks chemolithoautotrophic symbionts. We discuss how apoptosis might be one of the mechanisms that contribute to the adaptation of deep-sea mussels to toxic environments and/or to symbiosis."
https://openalex.org/W2911763679,"Yellow seed is a desirable trait in Brassica oilseed crops. The B. rapa var. Yellow Sarson carry unique yellow seed color genes which are not only important for the development of yellow-seeded oilseed B. rapa cultivars but this variant can also be used to develop yellow-seeded B. napus. In this study, we developed near-isogenic lines (NILs) of Yellow Sarson for the major seed coat color QTL SCA9-2 of the chromosome A9 and used the NILs to fine map this QTL region and to identify the candidate genes through linkage mapping and transcriptome sequencing of the developing seeds. From the 18.4 to 22.79 Mb region of SCA9-2, six SSR markers showing 0.63 to 5.65% recombination were developed through linkage analysis and physical mapping. A total of 55 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the SCA9-2 region through transcriptome analysis; these included three transcription factors, Bra028039 (NAC), Bra023223 (C2H2 type zinc finger), Bra032362 (TIFY), and several other genes which encode unknown or nucleic acid binding protein; these genes might be the candidates and involved in the regulation of seed coat color in the materials used in this study. Several biosynthetic pathways, including the flavonoid, phenylpropanoid and suberin biosynthetic pathways were significantly enriched through GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of the DEGs. This is the first comprehensive study to understand the yellow seed trait of Yellow Sarson through employing linkage mapping and global transcriptome analysis approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2913362857,"Background Screening for prostate cancer is frequent in high-income countries, including Switzerland. Notably due to overdiagnosis and overtreatment, various organisations have recently recommended against routine screening, potentially having an impact on incidence, mortality, and surgery rates. Our aim was therefore to examine whether secular trends in the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer, and in prostatectomy rates, have recently changed in Switzerland. Methods We conducted a population-based trend study in Switzerland from 1998 to 2012. Cases of invasive prostate cancer, deaths from prostate cancer, and prostatectomies were analysed. We calculated changes in age-standardised prostate cancer incidence rates, stratified by tumor stage (early, advanced), prostate cancer-specific mortality, and prostatectomy rates. Results The age-standardised incidence rate of prostate cancer increased greatly in men aged 50–69 years (absolute mean annual change +4.6/100,000, 95% CI: +2.9 to +6.2) between 1998 and 2002, and stabilised afterwards. In men aged ≥ 70 years, the incidence decreased slightly between 1998 and 2002, and more substantially since 2003. The incidence of early tumor stages increased between 1998 and 2002 only in men aged 50–69 years, and then stabilised, while the incidence of advanced stages remained stable across both age strata. The rate of prostatectomy increased markedly until 2002, more so in the 50 to 69 age range than among men aged ≥ 70 years; it leveled off after 2002 in both age strata. Trends in surgery were driven by radical prostatectomy. Since 1998, the annual age-standardised mortality rate of prostate cancer slightly declined in men aged 50–69 years (absolute mean annual change -0.1/100,000, 95% CI: -0.2 to -0.1) and ≥ 70 years (absolute mean annual change -0.5/100,000, 95% CI: -0.7 to -0.3). Conclusions The increases in the incidence of early stage prostate cancer and prostatectomy observed in Switzerland among men younger than 70 years have concomitantly leveled off around 2002/2003. Given the decreasing mortality, these trends may reflect recent changes in screening and clinical workup practices, with a possible attenuation of overdiagnosis and overtreatment."
https://openalex.org/W2913905045,"Objective To examine the association between maternal BMI>50kg/m2 during pregnancy and maternal and perinatal outcomes. Materials and methods An international cohort study was conducted using data from separate national studies in the UK and Australia. Outcomes of pregnant women with BMI>50 were compared to those of pregnant women with BMI<50. Multivariable logistic regression estimated the association between BMI>50 and perinatal and maternal outcomes. Results 932 pregnant women with BMI>50 were compared with 1232 pregnant women with BMI<50. Pregnant women with BMI>50 were slightly older, more likely to be multiparous, and have pre-existing comorbidities. There were no maternal deaths, however, extremely obese women had a nine-fold increase in the odds of thrombotic events compared to those with a BMI<50 (uOR: 9.39 (95%CI:1.15–76.43)). After adjustment, a BMI>50 during pregnancy had significantly raised odds of preeclampsia/eclampsia (aOR:4.88(95%CI: 3.11–7.65)), caesarean delivery (aOR: 2.77 (95%CI: 2.31–3.32)), induction of labour (aOR: 2.45(95% CI:2.00–2.99)) post caesarean wound infection (aOR:7.25(95%CI: 3.28–16.07)), macrosomia (aOR: 8.05(95%CI: 4.70–13.78)) compared a BMI<50. Twelve of the infants born to women in the extremely obese cohort died in the early neonatal period or were stillborn. Conclusions Pregnant women with BMI>50 have a high risk of inferior maternal and perinatal outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2914434441,"The internal environment of the gallbladder has been considered extremely unfavorable for bacterial growth, and the microbial profile of the gallbladder still unknown. By high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, we studied the microbial profile of the gallbladder from healthy rabbits before and after weaning. Moreover, we investigated the difference of microbiota between the gallbladder and gut. Our results showed that the gallbladder was dominantly populated by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria in the phylum throughout the developmental stages of rabbits. The adult rabbits showed higher species richness and exhibited higher bacterial diversity than rabbits before weaning based on the results of alpha diversity. Beta diversity analyses indicated differences in the bacterial community composition between different developmental stages. In the comparison of the gallbladder and feces, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were dominant in the phylum, as they were present in about 61% and 21% of the feces, respectively. Conversely, in the gallbladder, Firmicutes was the most dominant (about 41%), and Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria were present in about 16% and 22% of the gallbladder, respectively. The Unweighted UniFrac Principal Coordinate Analysis results illustrated samples clustered into 2 categories: the gallbladder and feces. Our study might provide a foundation for knowledge on gallbladder microbiota for the first time and a basis for further studies on gallbladder and intestinal health."
https://openalex.org/W2911440201,"The life cycle of cultured proliferating cells is characterized by fluctuations in cell population density induced by periodic subculturing. This leads to corresponding changes in micro- and macroenvironment of the cells, accompanied by altered cellular metabolism, growth rate and locomotion. Studying cell density-dependent morphological, physiological and biochemical fluctuations is relevant for understanding basic cellular mechanisms and for uncovering the intrinsic variation of commonly used tissue culture experimental models. Using multiple cell lines, we found that expression levels of the autophagic markers p62 and LC3II, and lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D were altered in highly confluent cells as a consequence of nutrient depletion and cell crowding, which led to inactivation of the mTOR signaling pathway. Furthermore, both Lamp1 and active focal adhesion kinase (FAK) were reduced in high-density cells, while chemical inhibition or deletion of FAK led to alterations in lysosomal and autophagic proteins, as well as in the mTOR signaling. This was accompanied by alterations in the Hippo signaling pathway, while cell cycle checkpoint regulator p-cdc2 remained unaffected in at least one studied cell line. On the other hand, allometric scaling of cellular compartments in growing cell populations resulted in biochemically detectable changes in the plasma membrane proteins Na+K+-ATPase and cadherin, and nuclear proteins HDAC1 and Lamin B1. Finally, we demonstrate how treatment-induced changes in cell density and corresponding modulation of susceptible proteins may lead to ambiguous experimental outcomes, or erroneous interpretation of cell culture data. Together, our data emphasize the need to recognize cell density as an important experimental variable in order to improve scientific rigor of cell culture-based studies."
https://openalex.org/W2913876253,"Wildlife crossings are designed to mitigate barrier effects of transportation infrastructure on wildlife movement. Most efforts in evaluating crossing efficiency focus on counting animal use. However, crossings placed at suboptimal locations may alter animals’ natural movement pattern and decrease population fitness, which cannot be reflected solely by counts of animal use. The long-distance migration of Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsonii) is directly affected by the Qinghai-Tibet Railway (QTR). Using the Wubei wildlife underpass along the QTR, we evaluated how underpass placement affects migration routes and decreases movement efficiency. We calculated the net-squared displacement of each animal to identify migration segments (wintering, calving, and migrating) based on Argos tracking data. We used two corridor modeling methods to identify optimal routes that theoretically require less energy to travel between seasonal habitats. We calculated the distance from actual migration routes recorded by Argos to the modelled optimal routes. We found that antelopes stray farther away from the optimal routes as they approach Wubei, indicating that animals have to deviate from their optimal migration pathway to access the railway underpass. On average, antelopes prolong their migration distance by 86.19 km (SEM = 17.29 km) in order to access the underpass. Our study suggests crossing location can affect animal migrations even if structures facilitate animal crossing. To better conserve long-distance migrations, long-term studies using tracking data which evaluate optimal migration routes are needed. We suggest considering the location and structural characteristics in designing and improving wildlife crossings, which do not only facilitate utilization, but also optimize animal movement processes such as migration."
https://openalex.org/W2911755725,"Most research on consumer attitudes does not consider that attitudes are likely influenced by people with whom we have some relationship even though socioeconomic, psychological and political theories recognize the importance of referent individuals' opinions in attitude formation. Knowledge on the role of referent individuals' opinions in attitude formation could improve the understanding of consumer acceptance of foods frequently associated with health or other concerns. This article examines the association of attitudes towards genetically modified (GM) crops and foods between young adults and their referent individuals using data collected in 2016 via surveys from the Czech Republic, Russia and Ukraine. Loglinear models of cell counts in contingency tables reveal a positive association of GM food attitudes between young adults and their referent individuals. This association was stronger in Russia and the Czech Republic than it was in Ukraine and stronger between female young adults and their referent individuals than between males and their referent individuals. Concordance in GM food attitudes with mothers is significantly stronger than concordance with best friends but not significantly different from concordance with fathers."
https://openalex.org/W2911798617,"Obesity-derived inflammation and metabolic dysfunction has been related to the activity of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). To understand the interrelation between metabolism, obesity and NO., we evaluated the effects of obesity-induced NO. signaling on liver mitochondrial function. We used mouse strains containing mitochondrial nicotinamide transhydrogenase activity, while prior studies involved a spontaneous mutant of this enzyme, and are, therefore, more prone to oxidative imbalance. Wild-type and iNOS knockout mice were fed a high fat diet for 2, 4 or 8 weeks. iNOS knockout did not protect against diet-induced metabolic changes. However, the diet decreased fatty-acid oxidation capacity in liver mitochondria at 4 weeks in both wild-type and knockout groups; this was recovered at 8 weeks. Interestingly, other mitochondrial functional parameters were unchanged, despite significant modifications in insulin resistance in wild type and iNOS knockout animals. Overall, we found two surprising features of obesity-induced metabolic dysfunction: (i) iNOS does not have an essential role in obesity-induced insulin resistance under all experimental conditions and (ii) liver mitochondria are resilient to functional changes in obesity-induced metabolic dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2912398491,"Much research has examined how crime rates vary across urban neighborhoods, focusing particularly on community-level demographic and social characteristics. A parallel line of work has treated crime at the individual level as an expression of certain behavioral patterns (e.g., impulsivity). Little work has considered, however, whether the prevalence of such behavioral patterns in a neighborhood might be predictive of local crime, in large part because such measures are hard to come by and often subjective. The Facebook Advertising API offers a special opportunity to examine this question as it provides an extensive list of “interests” that can be tabulated at various geographic scales. Here we conduct an analysis of the association between the prevalence of interests among the Facebook population of a ZIP code and the local rate of assaults, burglaries, and robberies across 9 highly populated cities in the US. We fit various regression models to predict crime rates as a function of the Facebook and census demographic variables. In general, models using the variables for the interests of the whole adult population on Facebook perform better than those using data on specific demographic groups (such as Males 18-34). In terms of predictive performance, models combining Facebook data with demographic data generally have lower error rates than models using only demographic data. We find that interests associated with media consumption and mating competition are predictive of crime rates above and beyond demographic factors. We discuss how this might integrate with existing criminological theory."
https://openalex.org/W2913728140,"Hybridization capture with in-solution oligonucleotide probes has quickly become the preferred method for enriching specific DNA loci from degraded or ancient samples prior to high-throughput sequencing (HTS). Several companies synthesize sets of probes for in-solution hybridization capture, but these commercial reagents are usually expensive. Methods for economical in-house probe synthesis have been described, but they do not directly address one of the major advantages of commercially synthesised probes: that probe sequences matching many species can be synthesised in parallel and pooled. The ability to make ""phylogenetically diverse"" probes increases the cost-effectiveness of commercial probe sets, as they can be used across multiple projects (or for projects involving multiple species). However, it is labour-intensive to replicate this with in-house methods, as template molecules must first be generated for each species of interest. While it has been observed that probes can be used to enrich for phylogenetically distant targets, the ability of this effect to compensate for the lack of phylogenetically diverse probes in in-house synthesised probe sets has not been tested. In this study, we present a refined protocol for in-house RNA probe synthesis and evaluated the ability of probes generated using this method from a single species to successfully enrich for the target locus in phylogenetically distant species. We demonstrated that probes synthesized using long-range PCR products from a placental mammal mitochondrion (Bison spp.) could be used to enrich for mitochondrial DNA in birds and marsupials (but not plants). Importantly, our results were obtained for approximately a third of the cost of similar commercially available reagents."
https://openalex.org/W2913999575,"Dryland ecosystems cover nearly 45% of the Earth's land area and account for large proportions of terrestrial net primary production and carbon pools. However, predicting rates of plant litter decomposition in these vast ecosystems has proven challenging due to their distinctly dry and often hot climate regimes, and potentially unique physical drivers of decomposition. In this study, we elucidated the role of photopriming, i.e. exposure of standing dead leaf litter to solar radiation prior to litter drop that would chemically change litter and enhance biotic decay of fallen litter. We exposed litter substrates to three different UV radiation treatments simulating three-months of UV radiation exposure in southern New Mexico: no light, UVA+UVB+Visible, and UVA+Visible. There were three litter types: mesquite leaflets (Prosopis glandulosa, litter with high nitrogen (N) concentration), filter paper (pure cellulose), and basswood (Tilia spp, high lignin concentration). We deployed the photoprimed litter in the field within a large scale precipitation manipulation experiment: ∼50% precipitation reduction, ∼150% precipitation addition, and ambient control. Our results revealed the importance of litter substrate, particularly N content, for overall decomposition in drylands, as neither filter paper nor basswood exhibited measurable mass loss over the course of the year-long study, while high N-containing mesquite litter exhibited potential mass loss. We saw no effect of photopriming on subsequent microbial decay. We did observe a precipitation effect on mesquite where the rate of decay was more rapid in ambient and precipitation addition treatments than in the drought treatment. Overall, we found that precipitation and N played a critical role in litter mass loss. In contrast, photopriming had no detected effects on mass loss over the course of our year-long study. These results underpin the importance of biotic-driven decomposition, even in the presence of photopriming, for understanding litter decomposition and biogeochemical cycles in drylands."

Type 1 diabetes was induced via a single intravenous injection of Streptozotocin at a dose of 40 mg/kg. A partial tenotomy was performed in the right AT. LPBM was performed with an indium-gallium-aluminum-phosphide 660 nm 10 mW laser device (spot size 0.04 cm2, power density 250 mW/cm2, irradiation duration 16 s, energy 0.16 J, energy density 4 J/cm2) on alternate days for a total of 9 sessions over 3 weeks (total energy 1.44 J), using a stationary contact technique to a single point over the dorsal aspect of the AT. Moderate aerobic exercise was performed on a motorized treadmill (velocity 9 m/min for 60 minutes). At 3 weeks post-injury, biomechanical analyzes as well as assessment of fibroblast number and orientation were performed. Collagen 1 (Col1) and 3 (Col3) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) -3 and 13 protein distributions were studied by immunohistochemistry; while Col1 and Col3 and MMP-2 and 9 gene expression were assessed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). IDEAL exhibited significant increases in several biomechanical parameters in comparison to the other groups. Moreover, IDEAL presented stronger Col1 immunoreactivity when compared to ID, and weaker Col3 immunoreactivity than IDE. Both IDL and IDEAL demonstrated weaker expression of MMP-3 in comparison to I, while IDL presented no expression of MMP-13 when compared to ID. ID, IDL and IDE showed an increased number of fibroblasts in comparison to I, while IDEAL decreased the number of these cells in comparison to ID and IDE. IDL and IDEAL groups exhibited decreased angular dispersion among the fibroblasts when compared to I. The gene expression results showed that IDE demonstrated a downregulation in Col1 mRNA expression in comparison to I and ID. IDEAL demonstrated upregulation of Col1 mRNA expression when compared to IDL or IDE alone and increased MMP-2 expression when compared to IDL and IDE. MMP-9 expression was upregulated in IDEAL when compared to I, IDL and IDE. Our results suggest a beneficial interaction of combining both treatment strategies i.e., aerobic exercise and LPBM, on the biomechanical properties, tissue morphology and the expression of matrix molecules in diabetic tendons."

Furthermore, relevant instruments for assessing the resilience of divorced immigrant Southeast Asian women are rare. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to develop and examine a new Resilience Scale-Chinese version (RS-C) that is specific to divorced immigrant Southeast Asian women in Taiwan. Methods The study was conducted in two phases. In phase 1, 20 items were used to evaluate face and content validities. In phase 2, a cross-sectional study was conducted. In total, 118 immigrant women participated in this study and were recruited from three nongovernmental organizations providing services for immigrants in Taipei City and Miaoli and Chiayi Counties. Psychometric properties of the instrument (i.e., internal consistency, test–retest reliability, item-to-total correlation, construct validity, and convergent validity) were examined. Significance was set at p < 0.05 for all statistical tests. Results The final 16-item RS-C resulted in a three-factor model. The three factors, namely personal competence, family identity, and social connections, were an acceptable fit for the data and explained 54.60% of the variance. Cronbach’s α of the RS-C was 0.85, and those of its subscales ranged from 0.77 to 0.82. The correlation value of the test–retest reliability was 0.87. The RS-C was significantly associated with the General Self-Efficacy scale and the Chinese Health Questionnaire-12. Conclusion The RS-C is a brief and specific self-report tool for evaluating the resilience of divorced immigrant Southeast Asian women and demonstrated adequate reliability and validity in this study. This RS-C instrument has potential applications in both clinical practice and research with strength-based resiliency interventions. However, additional research on the RS-C is required to further establish its reliability and validity."

In each trial, visual acuity was assessed in 7 tasks for defocus from 0.2D to 3.0D while contrast sensitivity in 2 tasks for defocus 0.3D and 2.5D. The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study protocol and Pelli-Robson method were applied. Within visual acuity and contrast sensitivity results degree of homogeneity through defocus was determined. Reference and stenopeic trials were compared to Light Sword Lens results. Friedman analysis of variance, Nemenyi post-hoc, Wilcoxon tests were used, p-value < 0.05 was considered significant.In Light Sword Lens trial visual acuity was stable in tested defocus range [20/25-20/32], Stenopeic trial exhibited a limited range of degradation [20/25-20/40]. Light Sword Lens and reference trials contrast sensitivity was high [1.9-2.0 logCS] for both defocus cases, but low in stenopeic condition [1.5-1.7 logCS]. Between-trials comparisons of visual acuity results showed significant differences only for Light Sword Lens versus reference trials and in contrast sensitivity only for Light Sword Lens versus stenopeic trials.Visual acuity achieved with Light Sword Lens correction in presbyopic eye is comparable to stenopeic but exhibits none significant loss in contrast sensitivity. Such correction method seems to be very promising for novel contact lenses and intraocular lenses design."
https://openalex.org/W2911457286,"Introduction Triage systems with limited room for clinical judgment are used by emergency departments (EDs) worldwide. The Copenhagen Triage Algorithm (CTA) is a simplified triage system with a clinical assessment. Methods The trial was a non-inferiority, two-center cluster-randomized crossover study where CTA was compared to a local adaptation of Adaptive Process Triage (ADAPT). CTA involves initial categorization based on vital signs with a final modification based on clinical assessment by an ED nurse. We used 30-day mortality with a non-inferiority margin at 0.5%. Predictive performance was compared using Receiver Operator Characteristics. Results We included 45,347 patient visits, 23,158 (51%) and 22,189 (49%) were triaged with CTA and ADAPT respectively with a 30-day mortality of 3.42% and 3.43% (P = 0.996) a difference of 0.01% (95% CI: -0.34 to 0.33), which met the non-inferiority criteria. Mortality at 48 hours was 0.62% vs. 0.71%, (P = 0.26) and 6.38% vs. 6.61%, (P = 0.32) at 90 days for CTA and ADAPT. CTA triaged at significantly lower urgency level (P<0.001) and was superior in predicting 30-day mortality, Area under the curve: 0.67 (95% CI 0.65–0.69) compared to 0.64 for ADAPT (95% CI 0.62–0.66) (P = 0.03). There were no significant differences in rate of admission to the intensive care unit, length of stay, waiting time nor rate of readmission within 30 or 90 days. Conclusion A novel triage system based on vital signs and a clinical assessment by an ED nurse was non-inferior to a traditional triage algorithm by short term mortality, and superior in predicting 30-day mortality.

Parents of PLH individuals are chronically confronted with stressful situations. The aims of this study are i) to assess and compare the quality of life (QoL) of a large panel of parents of PLH individuals with age- and gender-matched controls and ii) to identify potential determinants of parents’ QoL. Method We conducted a cross-sectional study. Parents were recruited from 4 specialized rehabilitation centres, 9 residential facilities, and a specialized paediatric/neurological department. The selection criteria were age above 18 years and being the mother/father of a PLH individual. The data collected from the parents included sociodemographic, health status, and psycho-behavioural data (including QoL); additionally, the health status of the PLH individuals was collected. Results The QoL scores of all dimensions were significantly lower for parents than for controls. The main factors modulating parents’ QoL were financial issues, health status, and coping strategies. The PLH individuals’ health status was not associated with parents’ QoL. Conclusions Some QoL determinants might be amenable. These findings should help health care workers and health decision makers to implement specific and appropriate interventions."

Although state resource managers had little information on these elk herds, limited evidence suggested temporal movements into Canada. We collected and analyzed essential information on home range and habitat selection for 3 elk herds residing in North Dakota. We captured 5 adult female elk in each study area, affixed global positioning system collars, and monitored them for 1 year (2016-2017). We estimated diel period, seasonal, and hunting season home ranges using Brownian Bridge Movement Models for each individual. We analyzed habitat selection using multinomial logit models to test for differences in use of land classes, and for departures from proportionate use based on random sampling; our predictor variables included individual elk, diel period, and season. Home ranges differed between the 3 herds, seasons, and diel period; gun and winter season home ranges were both larger than in summer, as was night when compared with day. Female elk generally restricted themselves to cover during the day and entered open areas at night and during winter months. Our results also suggest that elk in our study areas tended to seek more cover, and in the case of our Turtle Mountain study area, some cross into Canada during gun season. Our study provides a better understanding of the spatial ecology of elk in the Northern Great Plains while highlighting the need for enhanced international cooperative management efforts."

This paper further explores how the social distributions of words affect lexical access by exploring whether access is facilitated by invoking more abstract social categories. We conduct four experiments, all of which combine an Implicit Association Task with a Lexical Decision Task. Participants sorted real and nonsense words while at the same time sorting older and younger faces (exp. 1), male and female faces (exp. 2), stereotypically male and female objects (exp. 3), and framed and unframed objects, which were always stereotypically male or female (exp. 4). Across the experiments, lexical decision to socially skewed words is facilitated when the socially congruent category is sorted with the same hand. This suggests that the lexicon contains social detail from which individuals make social abstractions that can influence lexical access."

This study aims to investigate whether this may be explained by reduced muscle strength and physical activity resulting from disease damage and steroid myopathy. Methods Forty-eight AAV patients were sequentially included from the outpatient clinic. Patients in different stages of disease and treatment underwent measurements of muscle strength and anthropometric parameters. Patients filled in physical activity (Baecke) and quality of life questionnaires (RAND-36) and carried an accelerometer for a week. Muscle strength and physical activity were compared to quality of life, prednisolone use and disease duration. Results Most AAV patients had lower knee extension (76%) and elbow flexion (67%) forces than expected based on healthy norms. Also, physical (P<0.001) and mental (P = 0.01) quality of life were significantly reduced compared to healthy norm values. Lower knee extension force (P = 0.009), younger age <70 (P<0.001) and relapse of vasculitis (P = 0.003) were associated with lower age-adjusted physical quality of life. Lower Baecke index (P = 0.006), higher prednisolone dose (P = 0.005) and ENT involvement (P = 0.006) were associated with lower age-adjusted mental quality of life. Leg muscle strength showed no association with current or cumulative prednisolone use. Disease duration was longer in patients with knee extension force below healthy norms (P = 0.006). Conclusion Knee extension force and physical activity are positively associated with quality of life in AAV. Knee extension force decreases with longer disease duration, suggesting that disease- and treatment-related damage have a cumulative negative effect on muscle strength."
https://openalex.org/W2799375000,"The Doha Development Agenda recognizes the central role that international trade can play in the promotion of economic development. In fact, the increase of exports from developing countries to developed nations' markets has been considered a key element for developing countries to realize the potential benefits of globalization. Over the last decades, developed countries have provided preferential access to their markets to developing countries through nonreciprocal trade agreements. Moreover, developing countries have also participated in reciprocal trade agreements. This paper re-examines comparatively the effect of both kinds of trade agreements on exports from developing countries but also from the developed world. In line with other studies, our results across specifications are unstable. However, the results of our preferred specification give additional support to the argument raised by critics of nonreciprocal preference regimes who consider that developing countries should abandon their reliance on one-way trade preferences in favor of reciprocal agreements."
https://openalex.org/W2913651330,"Objective Metal Road Safety Barriers (MRSB) are one of the devices implemented in roadsides to mitigate the consequences of run-off crashes. In Europe, they have to meet the requirements of the European Standard EN-1317-2. This article analyzes a set of run-off crashes against MRSB, for which an in-depth investigation has been performed, comparing them with the standard tests. It has been observed that in many of these real crashes, the barriers have not worked properly in spite of having passed these standard tests. This paper demonstrates which variables may be responsible for this, with the objective of helping to improve the current test standard through the analysis of new test variables. Methods Multidimensional Scaling, a dimension reduction multivariate statistical technique, has been used to better understand how real crashes compare to standard tests, using several impact variables at the same time. Then, a statistical analysis has been developed to show the influence of the “Relative orientation impact angle” on the performance of the MRSB. Results Most of the real crashes analyzed are close to “TB11” and “TB32” standard tests. In many of these real crashes, the “Relative orientation impact angle” is very different from the “Impact angle”, and in these situations, the vehicle is not safely redirected to the road concerning the so-called “Exit-Box”. Conclusions MRSB are not working properly in some situations that are not far from the standard tests. To handle this, it could be interesting to include the “Relative orientation impact angle” as a control variable in new versions of the EN-1317-2 tests to guarantee the behavior of the MRSB. These results can help to adapt some test variables from the EN-1317-2 to what is happening in crashes."
https://openalex.org/W2914224782,"We present an equivalence between stochastic and deterministic variable approaches to represent ranked data and find the expressions obtained to be suggestive of statistical-mechanical meanings. We first reproduce size-rank distributions N(k) from real data sets by straightforward considerations based on the assumed knowledge of the background probability distribution P(N) that generates samples of random variable values similar to real data. The choice of different functional expressions for P(N): power law, exponential, Gaussian, etc., leads to different classes of distributions N(k) for which we find examples in nature. Then we show that all of these types of functions can be alternatively obtained from deterministic dynamical systems. These correspond to one-dimensional nonlinear iterated maps near a tangent bifurcation whose trajectories are proved to be precise analogues of the N(k). We provide explicit expressions for the maps and their trajectories and find they operate under conditions of vanishing or small Lyapunov exponent, therefore at or near a transition to or out of chaos. We give explicit examples ranging from exponential to logarithmic behavior, including Zipf's law. Adoption of the nonlinear map as the formalism central character is a useful viewpoint, as variation of its few parameters, that modify its tangency property, translate into the different classes for N(k)."

Reproductive stress has been is suggested to reduce the width of lead to narrower cementum annuli widths in female Asian black bears (Ursus thibetanus); however, food availability in autumn strongly impacts bear nutrition and likely impacts cementum widths as well. This study aimed to test how cementum annuli widths and the formation of false annuli were influenced by hard mast production. We established two hypotheses: (1) cementum annuli widths become narrower in poor mast years owing to inadequate nutritional conditions and (2) false annuli occur more frequently in poor mast years. We used teeth samples from male bears to avoid reproductive influences and separated width data into “adult” and “subadult” groups. We calculated the proportional width index (PWI) and used linear mixed models to estimate the masting effects on PWI. Generalized linear mixed models estimated the masting effects on false annuli frequency. True annuli widths and false annuli formation showed no significant relationship with mast production in adults. In subadults, poor mast production weak negative influence on false annuli formation. These new data resolve previous questions, allowing us to deduce that cementum annuli widths are a reliable index of reproductive success in female bears."
https://openalex.org/W2913013523,"To determine the correlation between the parameters of MR diffusion kurtosis imaging (MR-DKI) and mismatch repair gene expression (MMR) for rectal carcinomas.Data from 80 patients with rectal carcinoma were analyzed in this prospective study. High-resolution T2WI and DKI (b = 0, 800 and 1600 s/mm2, respectively) were performed. Mean kurtosis (MK) and mean diffusivity (MD) from DKI were measured. MMR-positive expression and HER-2 expression were classified into two groups. For comparison between different grades, the Mann-Whitney U test, receiver operating characteristic curve, and Spearman's correlation analysis were used for statistical analyses.The MK values in identifying positive MMR expressions (MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6) were more reliable than the MD values (rs value: 0.772 vs. 0.448, 0.733 vs. 0.499, and 0.828 vs. 0.633 respectively, P<0.01). Receiver operating curve analysis showed that the performances of the MK values were better than those of the MD values (z = 2.835, 2.000, and 2.827, respectively, P<0.05), while the performances of the MK and MD-MK values were not statistically significant (z = 0.808, 1.557, and 0.596, respectively, P>0.05). Similarly, MK values were better than MD values in identifying HER2 expression (z = 2.795, P<0.05).MK derived from DKI demonstrated a greater correlation than MD with MMR expression. It also showed better performance in differentiating between high- and low-grade positive MMR expression and HER2 expression. Thus, DKI may be valuable for the prognoses and evaluation of non-invasive therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2911349426,"A precise frequency synchronization detection method is proposed based on the group quantization steeping law. Based on the different-frequency group quantization phase processing, high-precision frequency synchronization can be achieved by measuring phase comparison result quantization. If any repeated phase differences in the quantized phase comparison results are used as the starting and stopping signal of the counter gate, the time interval between identical phase differences is a group period as gate time. By measuring and analyzing the quantized phase comparison results, the ±1-word counting error is overcome in the traditional frequency synchronization detection method, and the system response time is significantly shortened. The experimental results show that the proposed frequency synchronization detection method is advanced and scientific. The measurement resolution is notably stable and the frequency stability better than the E-12/s level can be obtained. The method is superior to the traditional frequency synchronization detection method in many aspects, such as system reliability and stability, detection speed, development cost, power consumption and volume."
https://openalex.org/W2912548631,"Research on bowed string motion focuses on transverse waves rather than on torsional waves. These are believed to play only a minor role for stabilizing vibrations and no role for perception. Here, torsion is measured on both sides of the bow contact point for a variety of bridge-bow distances on a cello string. Every periodic string release is preceeded by a reverse torsional motion independent from bowing position or dynamics. Transverse and torsional motions are coupled and there are cases of stabilization, but also cases of perturbation or surrender. Structural and timing analyses of torsional waves suggest that the earlier concepts of differential slipping can be essentially confirmed while the concept of Schelleng ripples cannot be confirmed and the concept of subharmonics is under question."
