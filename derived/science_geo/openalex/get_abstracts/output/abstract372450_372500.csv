https://openalex.org/W2085948054,"Direct inhibition of transcription factor complexes remains a central challenge in the discipline of ligand discovery. In general, these proteins lack surface involutions suitable for high-affinity binding by small molecules. Here we report the design of synthetic, cell-permeable, stabilized alpha-helical peptides that target a critical protein-protein interface in the NOTCH transactivation complex. We demonstrate that direct, high-affinity binding of the hydrocarbon-stapled peptide SAHM1 prevents assembly of the active transcriptional complex. Inappropriate NOTCH activation is directly implicated in the pathogenesis of several disease states, including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL). The treatment of leukaemic cells with SAHM1 results in genome-wide suppression of NOTCH-activated genes. Direct antagonism of the NOTCH transcriptional program causes potent, NOTCH-specific anti-proliferative effects in cultured cells and in a mouse model of NOTCH1-driven T-ALL."

https://openalex.org/W2037113830,"Background The new generation of massively parallel DNA sequencers, combined with the challenge of whole human genome resequencing, result in the need for rapid and accurate alignment of billions of short DNA sequence reads to a large reference genome. Speed is obviously of great importance, but equally important is maintaining alignment accuracy of short reads, in the 25–100 base range, in the presence of errors and true biological variation. Methodology We introduce a new algorithm specifically optimized for this task, as well as a freely available implementation, BFAST, which can align data produced by any of current sequencing platforms, allows for user-customizable levels of speed and accuracy, supports paired end data, and provides for efficient parallel and multi-threaded computation on a computer cluster. The new method is based on creating flexible, efficient whole genome indexes to rapidly map reads to candidate alignment locations, with arbitrary multiple independent indexes allowed to achieve robustness against read errors and sequence variants. The final local alignment uses a Smith-Waterman method, with gaps to support the detection of small indels. Conclusions We compare BFAST to a selection of large-scale alignment tools - BLAT, MAQ, SHRiMP, and SOAP - in terms of both speed and accuracy, using simulated and real-world datasets. We show BFAST can achieve substantially greater sensitivity of alignment in the context of errors and true variants, especially insertions and deletions, and minimize false mappings, while maintaining adequate speed compared to other current methods. We show BFAST can align the amount of data needed to fully resequence a human genome, one billion reads, with high sensitivity and accuracy, on a modest computer cluster in less than 24 hours. BFAST is available at http://bfast.sourceforge.net."

The aim of this study was to study prognosis in young women, quantifying how much stage at diagnosis and management on the one hand, and tumour biology on the other; each contribute to the worse prognosis seen in this age group.In a registry based cohort of women aged 20-69 (n = 22 017) with a primary diagnosis of invasive breast cancer (1992-2005), women aged 20-34 (n = 471), 35-39 (n = 858) and 40-49 (n = 4789) were compared with women aged 50-69 years (n = 15 899). The cumulative 5-year relative survival ratio and the relative excess mortality (RER) were calculated. The cumulative 5-year relative survival ratio was lowest in women aged 20-34. The RER was 2.84 for women aged 20-34 and decreased with increasing age (RER 1.76 and 1.17 for women aged 35-39 and 40-49, respectively). The excess risk was, however, present only in disease stages I and II. For women aged 20-34 with stage I disease RER was 4.63, and 6.70 in the subgroup with tumour size 1-10 mm. The absolute difference in stage I between the youngest and the reference groups amounted to nearly 8%, with a 90% 5-year survival in women aged 20-34. In stages IIa and IIb, the relative excess risk was not as dramatic, but the absolute differences approached 15%. The youngest women with small tumours generally received more aggressive treatment than women in older age groups.After correction for stage, tumour characteristics and treatment, age remained an independent risk factor for breast cancer death in women <35 years of age. The excess risk for young women was only seen in early stages of disease and was most pronounced in women with small tumours. Young women affected by breast cancer have a high risk of dying compared to their middle-aged counterparts even if diagnosed early and receiving an intense treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2012332159,"The signalling pathways controlling both the evolution and development of language in the human brain remain unknown. So far, the transcription factor FOXP2 (forkhead box P2) is the only gene implicated in Mendelian forms of human speech and language dysfunction. It has been proposed that the amino acid composition in the human variant of FOXP2 has undergone accelerated evolution, and this two-amino-acid change occurred around the time of language emergence in humans. However, this remains controversial, and whether the acquisition of these amino acids in human FOXP2 has any functional consequence in human neurons remains untested. Here we demonstrate that these two human-specific amino acids alter FOXP2 function by conferring differential transcriptional regulation in vitro. We extend these observations in vivo to human and chimpanzee brain, and use network analysis to identify novel relationships among the differentially expressed genes. These data provide experimental support for the functional relevance of changes in FOXP2 that occur on the human lineage, highlighting specific pathways with direct consequences for human brain development and disease in the central nervous system (CNS). Because FOXP2 has an important role in speech and language in humans, the identified targets may have a critical function in the development and evolution of language circuitry in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2032298501,"Because certain groups at high risk for HIV/AIDS (human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) come together in correctional facilities, seroprevalence was high early in the epidemic. The share of the HIV/AIDS epidemic borne by inmates of and persons released from jails and prisons in the United States (US) in 1997 was estimated in a previous paper. While the number of inmates and releasees has risen, their HIV seroprevalence rates have fallen. We sought to determine if the share of HIV/AIDS borne by inmates and releasees in the US decreased between 1997 and 2006. We created a new model of population flow in and out of correctional facilities to estimate the number of persons released in 1997 and 2006. In 1997, approximately one in five of all HIV-infected Americans was among the 7.3 million who left a correctional facility that year. Nine years later, only one in seven (14%) of infected Americans was among the 9.1 million leaving, a 29.3% decline in the share. For black and Hispanic males, two demographic groups with heightened incarceration rates, recently released inmates comprise roughly one in five of those groups' total HIV-infected persons, a figure similar to the proportion borne by the correctional population as a whole in 1997. Decreasing HIV seroprevalence among those admitted to jails and prisons, prolonged survival and aging of the US population with HIV/AIDS beyond the crime-prone years, and success with discharge planning programs targeting HIV-infected prisoners could explain the declining concentration of the epidemic among correctional populations. Meanwhile, the number of persons with HIV/AIDS leaving correctional facilities remains virtually identical. Jails and prisons continue to be potent targets for public health interventions. The fluid nature of incarcerated populations ensures that effective interventions will be felt not only in correctional facilities but also in communities to which releasees return."
https://openalex.org/W2054082659,"Microglia are critical for amyloid-β peptide (Aβ)-mediated neuronal perturbation relevant to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. We demonstrate that overexpression of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) in imbroglio exaggerates neuroinflammation, as evidenced by increased proinflammatory mediator production, Aβ accumulation, impaired learning/memory, and neurotoxicity in an Aβ-rich environment. Transgenic (Tg) mice expressing human mutant APP (mAPP) in neurons and RAGE in microglia displayed enhanced IL-1β and TNF-α production, increased infiltration of microglia and astrocytes, accumulation of Aβ, reduced acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity, and accelerated deterioration of spatial learning/memory. Notably, introduction of a signal transduction-defective mutant RAGE (DN-RAGE) to microglia attenuates deterioration induced by Aβ. These findings indicate that RAGE signaling in microglia contributes to the pathogenesis of an inflammatory response that ultimately impairs neuronal function and directly affects amyloid accumulation. We conclude that blockade of microglial RAGE may have a beneficial effect on Aβ-mediated neuronal perturbation relevant to AD pathogenesis.—Fang, F., Lue, L.-F., Yan, S., Xu, H., Luddy, J.

https://openalex.org/W1988697119,"Resolvins are endogenous lipid mediators that actively regulate the resolution of acute inflammation. Resolvin E1 (RvE1; (5S,12R,18R)-trihydroxy-6Z,8E,10E,14Z,16E-eicosapentaenoic acid) is an endogenous anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving mediator derived from eicosapentaenoic acid that regulates leukocyte migration and enhances macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils to resolve inflammation. In the inflammatory milieu, RvE1 mediates counter-regulatory actions initiated via specific G protein-coupled receptors. Here, we have identified RvE1-specific signaling pathways initiated by the RvE1 receptor ChemR23. RvE1 stimulated phosphorylation of Akt that was both ligand- and receptor-dependent. RvE1 regulated Akt phosphorylation in a time (0–15 min)- and dose-dependent (0.01–100 nm) manner in human ChemR23-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. RvE1 stimulated phosphorylation of both Akt and a 30-kDa protein, a downstream target of Akt, identified using a phospho-Akt substrate antibody. The 30-kDa protein was identified as ribosomal protein S6, a translational regulator, and its phosphorylation was inhibited by a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor (wortmannin) and an ERK inhibitor (PD98059) but not by a p38-MAPK inhibitor (SB203580). Ribosomal protein S6 is a downstream target of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway as well as the Raf/ERK pathway. In ChemR23-expressing differentiated HL60 cells, RvE1 also stimulated the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6. In addition, RvE1 enhanced phagocytosis of zymosan A by human macrophages, which are inhibited by PD98059 and rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor). These results indicate that RvE1 initiates direct activation of ChemR23 and signals receptor-dependent phosphorylation.

The acute inflammatory response is a protective host reaction to foreign invaders or tissue injury.

Adherent PMA-differentiated cells (HL60-PMA) were then serum-depleted for 4 h preparatory to stimulation with RvE1. Differentiated cells were confirmed by flow cytometric analysis with anti-CD14 Ab. Fresh venous blood was collected in 10 units/ml sodium heparin from de-identified healthy volunteers who denied taking any drugs for at least 2 weeks before the experiments. The protocol was approved by the Brigham and Women’s Hospital Institutional Review Board (protocol 88-02642) and the Boston University Medical Center Institutional Review Board (protocol H-23425). The isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was performed as described by Böyum (18Böyum A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1968; 21: 77-89PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated by dextran sedimentation followed by Ficoll-Histopaque gradient centrifugation (400 × g, 30 min, 25 °C). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were then incubated with CD14 Microbeads (20 μl/107 cells) (15 min, 4 °C) in calcium/magnesium-free Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS, pH 7.45) containing 2 mm EDTA and 0.5% bovine serum albumin according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were subsequently washed and loaded onto a magnetic column (Miltenyi Biotech Inc.). Magnetically labeled CD14+ monocytes were eluted from the column and resuspended in the appropriate medium for differentiation (see below). Viability was >98% as evaluated by trypan blue and propidium iodide exclusion. The purity of the isolated fraction was routinely >95% as confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. Purified monocytes (1.0 × 106 cells/ml) were differentiated into macrophages in RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS and recombinant human granulocyte/monocyte colony-stimulating factor (10 ng/ml) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Complete fresh medium was added at day 3, and the cells were used for the experiments 7 days after isolation. Cells were then serum-depleted for 4 h prior to incubations with RvE1. Cell surface expression was assessed by FACS analysis on a FACSort (BD Bioscience). Cells (1.0 × 106 cells) were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in DPBS for 15 min at room temperature in the dark and washed three times for 5 min in DPBS. Cells were then incubated with anti-human ChemR23 Ab (1:100 ratio in FACS buffer) followed by incubation with FITC-labeled secondary Ab or phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD14 Ab (1:100) for 1 h at 4 °C. Appropriately labeled cross-matched isotype controls IgG were used as negative controls for ChemR23 and CD14 staining. Cell surface expression of ChemR23 was assessed by immunofluorescence as well as flow cytometry. Cells (0.5 × 106 cells/well) incubated in 4-well chamber slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rochester, NY) were fixed as described above and blocked with 2% goat serum (Sigma-Aldrich) in DPBS for 15 min followed by incubation with anti-ChemR23 Ab or isotype-matched control IgG3κ at a 1:100 ratio in 2% FBS/DPBS overnight at 4 °C. Cells were subsequently washed four times with DPBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) at a 1:250 dilution in 2% FBS/DPBS for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Following incubation, cells were washed five times and mounted using a Prolong® Gold antifade kit with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Invitrogen). Digital images of stained cells were captured with an inverted microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 200, Carl Zeiss, Heidelberg, Germany) and a video camera (Sony DFW-X700, Sony Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The images were imported into image analysis software (MicroSuite, Olympus America Inc., Melville, NY) for analysis. [3H]RvE1 methyl ester was obtained by catalytic hydrogenation of synthetic 6,14-diacetylenic RvE1, which was supplied to American Radiolabeled Chemicals for custom labeling. The resulting mixture was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, and [3H]RvE1 was saponified to the corresponding carboxylic acid and isolated by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (8Arita M. Bianchini F. Aliberti J. Sher A. Chiang N. Hong S. Yang R. Petasis N.A. Serhan C.N. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). The binding studies were carried out with the isolated tritiated RvE1 ([6,7,14,15-3H]RvE1; 100 Ci/mmol) as described previously (8Arita M. Bianchini F. Aliberti J. Sher A. Chiang N. Hong S. Yang R. Petasis N.A. Serhan C.N. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots of CHO-hChemR23 cells or CHO-mock cells (1.0 × 106 cells/0.5 ml) were incubated in binding mixtures at 4 °C for the indicated time periods. The binding mixtures contained cells and the indicated concentrations of [3H]RvE1 or unlabeled RvE1 as a competitor in DPBS with CaCl2 and MgCl2 (DPBS+/+). To determine ligand specificity by competition binding, cells were incubated with 10 nm [3H]RvE1 in the presence of the indicated concentrations of RvE1 (10−10 to 10−6 m) as a competitor for 1 h at 4 °C. To determine displacement of equilibrium-bound [3H]RvE1, cells were incubated at 4 °C in the presence of [3H]RvE1 (5 nm). After 10 min, unlabeled RvE1 was added to the incubations. For saturation binding, cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of [3H]RvE1 (0.5–10.0 nm) in the presence or absence of unlabeled RvE1 (2 μm) for 1 h at 4 °C. Bound and unbound radioligand was separated by filtration through Whatman GF/C glass microfiber filters (Fisher Scientific), and radioactivity was determined. The signaling transduction induced by RvE1 was assessed by Western blotting as described previously (19Ohira T. Zhan Q. Ge T. Van Dyke T. Badwey J.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 281: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Concentrations of antagonists and stimulation times are presented in the legends to FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6. Briefly, at the appropriate time intervals, cells (5.0 × 106/ml) were lysed rapidly by adding 60 μl of 5× SDS sample buffer to 240 μl of the reaction mixture and then boiling the samples for 5 min. The final composition of SDS sample buffer was 2% (w/v) SDS, 58.3 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 6% (v/v) glycerol, 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.002% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 1% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Aliquots of these samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (∼17 μg/lane) on 10 or 12% (v/v) polyacrylamide slab gels. The separated proteins were transferred immediately by electrophoresis to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with the secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate, 1:3000 dilution; Cell Signaling) for 1 h at room temperature. The activity of horseradish peroxidase was visualized with a luminol-ECL detection system (Pierce) followed by autoradiography. To confirm that equal amounts of protein were present in each lane, the membranes were reblotted with anti-actin Ab (1:2000 dilution; Sigma-Aldrich). The band density was measured using an image densitometer (Bio-Rad) and normalized to the actin band. Immunoprecipitations were performed to investigate the ability to detect rS6 phosphorylation by phospho-Akt(S) Ab, using a Seize® X-protein A immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce). Whole cell lysates were derived from CHO-hChemR23 cells (5.0 × 107 cells) in the presence or absence of RvE1 (10 nm, 15 min, 37 °C). Cells were lysed rapidly in the immunoprecipitation buffer and incubated on ice for 15 min followed by centrifugation (1000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) to remove insoluble debris as described previously (18Böyum A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1968; 21: 77-89PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of the soluble proteome fraction (∼1 mg) were incubated with monoclonal rS6 immobilized antibody. Immunoprecipitates were eluted, denatured, loaded on 12% (v/v) polyacrylamide slab gels (≈70 μg/lane), and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was blotted with the antibody to the (R/K)X(R/K)XX(S*/T*) consensus motif (phospho-Akt(S) Ab) to determine the phosphorylated rS6. Moreover, rS6 was detected from these samples using anti-rS6 Ab to confirm that the same amounts of protein were loaded. Cells (0.5 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated in 4-well chamber slides with RvE1 (10 nm, 15 min, 37 °C). The wells were subsequently aspirated gently, and cells were washed with ice-cold DPBS. Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde/DPBS for 15 min at room temperature in the dark and washed with DPBS. Cells were subsequently permeabilized with 1% Triton X/DPBS for 10 min at room temperature. 5% goat serum/DPBS was used for blocking, and cells were stained with anti-phospho-rS6 (Ser235/Ser236) Ab or isotype-matched control IgG in a 1:100 dilution in 2% FBS/DPBS overnight at 4 °C. Following incubation, cells were washed and incubated with Alexa® Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa® Fluor 488 conjugated with phalloidin. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. To evaluate ChemR23, PI3K, ERK, p38-MAPK, or mTOR involvement in RvE1-mediated phosphorylation by immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were treated with a monoclonal anti-human ChemR23 antibody, isotype-matched mouse IgG3κ control (1:100), PD98059 (50 μm), wortmannin (200 nm), SB203580 (10 μm), or rapamycin (20 nm) prior to incubation with RvE1. The pro-resolving actions of RvE1 were assessed as described previously (10Hong S. Porter T.F. Lu Y. Oh S.F. Pillai P.S. Serhan C.N. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 3512-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 13Schwab J.M. Chiang N. Arita M. Serhan C.N. Nature. 2007; 447: 869-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Briefly, for phagocytosis in vitro, human macrophages were plated onto 96-well plates (1.0 × 105 cells/well) and incubated with RvE1 (0.01–100.0 nm) for 15 min in DPBS+/+, pH 7.45. FITC-STZ (0.5 × 106 particles/well) was then added to macrophages for 30 min. The wells were subsequently aspirated, and extracellular fluorescence was quenched by briefly adding trypan blue. Cells were then washed, and intracellular fluorescence was measured (Excitation 485 nm/Absorption 535 nm) by a fluorescent plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To evaluate ChemR23, ERK, or rapamycin involvement in RvE1-mediated phagocytosis, cells were treated with a monoclonal anti-ChemR23 Ab (1:100 dilution), isotype-matched control IgG3 (1:100), PD98059 (50 μm), or rapamycin (20 nm) prior to incubation with RvE1. To determine the distribution of rS6 phosphorylation and phagocytosis of FITC-STZ by immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were plated onto 4-well chamber slides (0.5 × 106 cells/wells) and treated with the same concentrations of antagonists as described above prior to incubation with RvE1 (10 nm) and FITC-STZ (2.5 × 105 particles/well). Cells were then stained with anti-phospho-rS6 (Ser235/Ser236) Ab using Alexa Fluor® 568 secondary Ab. Actin filaments were labeled with Alexa Fluor® 488-phalloidin, and nuclei were labeled with DAPI. Statistical analyses were carried out using Student’s t test with p < 0.05 taken as significant. First, we established that the receptor was expressed on the surface of CHO cells transfected with hChemR23 (CHO-hChemR23) compared with wild type vectors (CHO-mock). Expression of human ChemR23 was only identified on CHO-hChemR23 cells but not on CHO-mock cells as assessed using immunofluorescence and flow cytometric analysis, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). We next examined competition binding of RvE1 with the radiolabeled homoligand RvE1 ([3H]RvE1) with CHO-hChemR23 and CHO-mock cells. ChemR23 is one of the high affinity G protein-coupled receptors that interacts with RvE1, demonstrating specific binding to ChemR23 using synthetic 3H-labeled RvE1 (8Arita M. Bianchini F. Aliberti J. Sher A. Chiang N. Hong S. Yang R. Petasis N.A. Serhan C.N. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Specific binding of [3H]RvE1 was displaced with increasing concentrations of the unlabeled homoligand and was completely reduced to levels of nonspecific binding following equilibrium by addition of a 3-log order excess of unlabeled RvE1. As shown in Fig. 1C, RvE1 displaced [3H]RvE1 binding to CHO-hChemR23, but not to CHO-mock cells, in a concentration-dependent manner. It is noteworthy that the amount of [3H]RvE1 binding to CHO-mock cells was ∼65% compared with th"
https://openalex.org/W2029383690,"Cue-evoked activity of midbrain dopamine neurons is proposed to encode the magnitude, delay and uncertainty of predicted rewards. Here the authors report that this activity separates costs and benefits, as it does not encode the costs of the action required to obtain predicted rewards. Reward-predicting cues evoke activity in midbrain dopamine neurons that encodes fundamental attributes of economic value, including reward magnitude, delay and uncertainty. We found that dopamine release in rat nucleus accumbens encodes anticipated benefits, but not effort-based response costs unless they are atypically low. This neural separation of costs and benefits indicates that mesolimbic dopamine scales with the value of pending rewards, but does not encode the net utility of the action to obtain them."
https://openalex.org/W2006461182,"Cohesin rings encircle pairs of sister DNA molecules during cell division to allow their proper segregation. These rings inhibit progression of the transcriptional apparatus, but do not prevent the replication machinery from duplicating the genome in the S phase of the cell cycle. Single-molecule analysis now shows that a replication complex (called replication factor C–CTF18 clamp loader) acetylates cohesin, thereby alleviating cohesin's association with regulatory factors and facilitating replication fork progression. Loss of acetylation, as observed in cells from patients with Roberts syndrome, causes defects in fork progression and the accumulation of DNA damage. Cohesin inhibits the transcriptional machinery's interaction with and movement along chromatin, but does not prevent replication forks from duplicating the genome in S phase. Using single-molecule analysis, a replication complex is now found to affect acetylation of a subunit of cohesin, and this acetylation appears to be a central determinant of fork processivity. Loss of this regulatory mechanism leads to the spontaneous accrual of DNA damage. Cohesin not only links sister chromatids but also inhibits the transcriptional machinery’s interaction with and movement along chromatin1,2,3,4,5,6. In contrast, replication forks must traverse such cohesin-associated obstructions to duplicate the entire genome in S phase. How this occurs is unknown. Through single-molecule analysis, we demonstrate that the replication factor C (RFC)–CTF18 clamp loader (RFCCTF18)1,7 controls the velocity, spacing and restart activity of replication forks in human cells and is required for robust acetylation of cohesin’s SMC3 subunit and sister chromatid cohesion. Unexpectedly, we discovered that cohesin acetylation itself is a central determinant of fork processivity, as slow-moving replication forks were found in cells lacking the Eco1-related acetyltransferases ESCO1 or ESCO2 (refs 8–10) (including those derived from Roberts’ syndrome patients, in whom ESCO2 is biallelically mutated11) and in cells expressing a form of SMC3 that cannot be acetylated. This defect was a consequence of cohesin’s hyperstable interaction with two regulatory cofactors, WAPL and PDS5A (refs 12, 13); removal of either cofactor allowed forks to progress rapidly without ESCO1, ESCO2, or RFCCTF18. Our results show a novel mechanism for clamp-loader-dependent fork progression, mediated by the post-translational modification and structural remodelling of the cohesin ring. Loss of this regulatory mechanism leads to the spontaneous accrual of DNA damage and may contribute to the abnormalities of the Roberts’ syndrome cohesinopathy."

https://openalex.org/W2069963495,"The surface abundance of lithium on the Sun is 140 times less than protosolar, yet the temperature at the base of the surface convective zone is not hot enough to burn Li. A large range of Li abundances in solar type stars of the same age, mass and metallicity is observed, but theoretically difficult to understand. An earlier suggestion that Li is more depleted in stars with planets was weakened by the lack of a proper comparison sample of stars without detected planets. Here we report Li abundances for an unbiased sample of solar-analogue stars with and without detected planets. We find that the planet-bearing stars have less than 1 per cent of the primordial Li abundance, while about 50 per cent of the solar analogues without detected planets have on average 10 times more Li. The presence of planets may increase the amount of mixing and deepen the convective zone to such an extent that the Li can be burned."
https://openalex.org/W2096592500,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is produced either as a pro-angiogenic or anti-angiogenic protein depending upon splice site choice in the terminal, eighth exon. Proximal splice site selection (PSS) in exon 8 generates pro-angiogenic isoforms such as VEGF165, and distal splice site selection (DSS) results in anti-angiogenic isoforms such as VEGF165b. Cellular decisions on splice site selection depend upon the activity of RNA-binding splice factors, such as ASF/SF2, which have previously been shown to regulate VEGF splice site choice. To determine the mechanism by which the pro-angiogenic splice site choice is mediated, we investigated the effect of inhibition of ASF/SF2 phosphorylation by SR protein kinases (SRPK1/2) on splice site choice in epithelial cells and in in vivo angiogenesis models. Epithelial cells treated with insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) increased PSS and produced more VEGF165 and less VEGF165b. This down-regulation of DSS and increased PSS was blocked by protein kinase C inhibition and SRPK1/2 inhibition. IGF-1 treatment resulted in nuclear localization of ASF/SF2, which was blocked by SPRK1/2 inhibition. Pull-down assay and RNA immunoprecipitation using VEGF mRNA sequences identified an 11-nucleotide sequence required for ASF/SF2 binding.

Inhibition of VEGF has shown to be effective in cancer (1.Kerbel R.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 358: 2039-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar) and ocular angiogenesis (2.Duh E. Aiello L.P. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1899-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and it is up-regulated by a number of growth factors also implicated in these conditions, including insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) (3.Slomiany M.G. Rosenzweig S.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 2838-2847Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). VEGF is generated as multiple isoforms by alternative splicing (4.Harper S.J. Bates D.O. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 880-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). There are two principal families of VEGF isoforms, the pro-angiogenic VEGFxxx isoforms, generated by proximal splice site selection in the terminal exon, exon 8a (5.Houck K.A. Ferrara N. Winer J. Cachianes G. Li B. Leung D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1806-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar), and the anti-angiogenic VEGFxxxb isoforms (6.Woolard J. Wang W.Y. Bevan H.S. Qiu Y.

Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7822-7835Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), generated by use of a distal splice site 66 bp further into exon 8, generating mRNA isoforms that contain exon 8b. As the stop codon for the protein is encoded in exon 8, these two isoforms contain alternate six amino acids at the C terminus (Fig. 1A). The pro-angiogenic isoforms such as VEGF165 encode a terminal six amino acid sequence of CDKPRR, and the anti-angiogenic isoforms such as VEGF165b encode SLTRKD (7.Bates D.O. Cui T.G. Doughty J.M.

In contrast, in non-angiogenic conditions where VEGF is up-regulated, such as glaucoma and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment associated with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (13.Dieudonné S.C.

Darland D. Luo Z.K. Grosskreutz C.L. Mol. Vis. 2008; 14: 1517-1524PubMed Google Scholar), the anti-angiogenic isoforms are up-regulated. We have previously shown that IGF-1 can switch splicing in cultured epithelial cells from anti-angiogenic to pro-angiogenic isoforms (15.Nowak D.G. Woolard J. Amin E.M. Konopatskaya O.

As IGF-1 has been implicated in a number of angiogenic conditions including diabetic retinopathy and colon cancer, we hypothesized that the mechanism through which IGF-1 mediates this change in splicing may be a potential therapeutic target to prevent angiogenesis. To this end, we have investigated the signaling pathways, the splicing factors involved, and the possibility of therapeutic intervention in the pathway in an animal model of diabetic retinopathy.DISCUSSIONVEGF induction by IGF-1 occurs via different signaling pathways including PKC (22.Beckert S.

IGF-1 modulates splicing of VEGF isoforms by preferential use of the PSS to increase expression of pro-angiogenic isoforms (15.Nowak D.G. Woolard J. Amin E.M. Konopatskaya O.

Moreover, previously we have shown that ASF/SF2 overexpression preferentially increases usage of the proximal splice site (15.Nowak D.G. Woolard J. Amin E.M. Konopatskaya O. Saleem M.A. Churchill A.J. Ladomery M.R. Harper S.J. Bates D.O. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 3487-3495Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and gives the same effect as IGF-1. SRPK1 has been shown specifically to phosphorylate 12 serines of the RS domain in ASF/SF2 (31.Ma C.T. Velazquez-Dones A. Hagopian J.C. Ghosh G. Fu X.D. Adams J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 376: 55-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and SRPK2 has been involved in the localization of ASF/SF2 within the nucleus. Thus, in this report, we have investigated the link between the splicing machinery and IGF-1 signaling.We have shown that the IGF-1-mediated increase in VEGF isoforms using the proximal splice site is inhibited by blocking PKC and SRPK1/2, and that this can be overcome by the use of a PKC inhibitor or mimicked by a PKC agonist or overexpression of SRPK1. This firmly suggests that this kinase cascade is involved in splice site selection in the VEGF gene. We have used RT-PCR, ELISA, and Western blotting to investigate VEGF splicing. VEGF isoform mRNA expression depends on transcription, splicing, and degradation of mRNA, and protein expression additionally depends upon translational rate and degradation rate. The finding that the mRNA and protein isoforms are both altered in a similar way by each intervention suggests that this is an mRNA switch, at least in part. As the mRNAs are generated by alternative splicing it is unlikely that differential isoform production is due to differential transcription, as both isoforms are transcribed from the same promoter region. However, VEGF has been shown to have two alternate transcription start sites. Although there is no evidence to date to show that these are differentially used for the different exon 8 isoforms, they do confer different exon 7 inclusion (32.Bastide A. Karaa Z. Bornes S. Hieblot C. Lacazette E. Prats H. Touriol C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 2434-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). If alternate transcription start sites are used, the splicing machinery would still need to be different in order for the transcription complex to recognize the different exon 8 splice sites. It is possible that these two different isoform families are differentially degraded, and that IGF mediates a decrease in degradation of mRNA encoding the proximal splice site. This is a possibility that we have not as yet excluded. However, the finding that ASF/SF2, a known splicing factor, requires the presence of a specific short sequence in the polypyrimidine tract upstream of the proximal splice site and that ASF/SF2 is induced to nuclear localization by SRPK1 activation and IGF-1 activation strongly suggest that this is a splicing mechanism rather than a degradation mechanism. We have shown that ASF/SF2 requires this sequence, which contains both a U2AF65 and consensus ASF/SF2 sequence, for binding to the VEGF pre-mRNA, but does not demonstrate that this is the sequence it binds to. ASF/SF2 binding to a region upstream of a splice site is generally considered a splicing repressor. There is evidence that SR proteins can interact with sequences upstream of the splice site that act as intronic splicing enhancer or silencer regions (reviewed in Ref. 33.Voelker R.B. Berglund J.A. Genome Res. 2007; 17: 1023-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); for instance in the FGFR2 gene mutations in 50% of the sequential 6 nucleotide sequences in the intronic region upstream of the splice site resulted in altered splicing (34.Hovhannisyan R.H. Warzecha C.C. Carstens R.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, an alternative explanation is that ASF/SF2 requires the U2AF65 consensus sequence adjacent to exon 8a to be present in order for it to bind to consensus sequences downstream and repress distal splice site selection, and hence when mutated or deleted DSS repression is lifted resulting in preferential proximal splice site selection. More research is required to pinpoint the exact mechanism of splicing regulation by ASF/SF2.It is still not clear if the IGF-1 system plays a direct role in the growth of new blood vessels. However, there are increasing examples that IGF-1 indirectly increases angiogenesis by up-regulation of VEGF (22.Beckert S. Farrahi F. Perveen Ghani Q. Aslam R. Scheuenstuhl H. Coerper S.

Moreover, IGF-1 induces angiogenesis in the rabbit cornea (36.Grant M.B. Mames R.N. Fitzgerald C. Ellis E.A. Aboufriekha M. Guy J.

Expression of IGF-1 was increased in the vitreous of patients with diabetic retinopathy (39.Grant M. Russell B. Fitzgerald C. Merimee T.J. Diabetes. 1986; 35: 416-420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is a positive correlation between elevated VEGF-A and IGF-1 in different types of cancers such as colorectal cancer (40.Warren R.S. Yuan H. Matli M.R. Ferrara N. Donner D.B. J. Biol.

Alternatively, the use of antisense oligonucleotides such as morpholinos, which can bind to the specific splice sites to modulate aberrant splicing has been investigated (48.Bruno I.G. Jin W.

Invest. 2007; 117: 3952-3957PubMed Google Scholar). SRPK1 seems to be a relatively new target for future cancer therapies but is receiving more attention recently as higher expression of SRPK1 has been observed in breast and colonic tumors, and its increased expression is associated with the grade of a tumor (50.Hayes G.M. Carrigan P.E. Miller L.J. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 2072-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that known anticancer drugs such as gemcitabine and cisplatin increase cell apoptosis with a much stronger effect when phosphorylation of SR proteins was inhibited by using siRNA against SRPK1 (51.Hayes G.M. Carrigan P.E. Beck A.M. Miller L.J. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 3819-3827Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). SRPK2 is able to bind and phosphorylate acinus, an SR protein, and moves it from nuclear speckles to the nucleoplasm, resulting in the activation of cyclin A1 (52.Jang S.W. Yang S.J. Ehlén A. Dong S. Khoury H. Chen J. Persson J.L. Ye K. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 4559-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of acinus or SRPK2 increased leukemia cell proliferation. SRPK2 and acinus were also overexpressed in human acute myelogenous leukemia patients and correlate with elevated cyclin A1 expression levels (52.Jang S.W. Yang S.J. Ehlén A. Dong S. Khoury H. Chen J. Persson J.L. Ye K. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 4559-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These two kinases are able to phosphorylate the splicing factor, ASF/SF2 and all these components are involved in the choice of the PSS in VEGF. The inhibitor of SRPK1/2 kinase, SRPIN340 prevents the down-regulation of the VEGFxxxb isoforms. Moreover, SRPK1 and SRPK2 are known to phosphorylate the ASF/SF2 splicing factor with high specificity (21.Wang H.Y. Lin W. Dyck J.A. Yeakley J.M. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Fu X.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 737-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 31.Ma C.T. Velazquez-Dones A. Hagopian J.C. Ghosh G. Fu X.D. Adams J.A. J. Mol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24569-24575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). These results indicate that an overactivity of SRPK1 can cause phosphorylation of ASF/SF2. However, SRPKs have other targets, including those known to up-regulate VEGFxxxb such as SRp55 (15.Nowak D.G. Woolard J. Amin E.M. Konopatskaya O. Saleem M.A. Churchill A.J. Ladomery M.R. Harper S.J. Bates D.O. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 3487-3495Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and the contribution of SRp55 phosphorylation to IGF-mediated effects (perhaps by inhibiting its binding to the distal splice enhancer region) cannot be ruled out. It thus appears likely that SRPK1-mediated phosphorylation of ASF/SF2 could support an activation of the PSS and increased production of pro-angiogenic isoforms.The overexpression findings, however, suggest that whereas SRPKs are necessary, they are not sufficient for proximal splice site selection. Thus these findings indicate that SRPK1 inhibitors may be potentially anti-angiogenic, and to that end we set out to investigate this in a model of angiogenesis in the eye. A single dose of SRPIN340 resulted in significant inhibition of angiogenesis and increased normal vascularization. Whereas, we have not measured VEGF165b levels in these eyes, there is a discrepancy between total and exon 8a-containing isoforms that is most likely a result of altered splicing. The angiogenesis is known to be mediated by pro-angiogenic VEGF and can be inhibited by anti-angiogenic VEGF165b (18.Konopatskaya O. Churchill A.J. Harper S.J. Bates D.O. Gardiner T.A. Mol. Vis. 2006; 12: 626-632PubMed Google Scholar); thus, allowing us to draw a parallel between anti-angiogenic splice forms and inhibition of splice factors that cause pro-angiogenic splicing in the same retinal angiogenesis model. These data suggest that anti-SRPK1 inhibitors may be useful anti-angiogenic agents, suggesting a use in cancer as well as diabetic retinopathy or age-related macular degeneration.

Inhibition of VEGF has shown to be effective in cancer (1.Kerbel R.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 358: 2039-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar) and ocular angiogenesis (2.Duh E. Aiello L.P. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1899-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and it is up-regulated by a number of growth factors also implicated in these conditions, including insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) (3.Slomiany M.G. Rosenzweig S.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 2838-2847Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). VEGF is generated as multiple isoforms by alternative splicing (4.Harper S.J. Bates D.O. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 880-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). There are two principal families of VEGF isoforms, the pro-angiogenic VEGFxxx isoforms, generated by proximal splice site selection in the terminal exon, exon 8a (5.Houck K.A. Ferrara N. Winer J. Cachianes G. Li B. Leung D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1806-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar), and the anti-angiogenic VEGFxxxb isoforms (6.Woolard J. Wang W.Y. Bevan H.S. Qiu Y.

Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7822-7835Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), generated by use of a distal splice site 66 bp further into exon 8, generating mRNA isoforms that contain exon 8b. As the stop codon for the protein is encoded in exon 8, these two isoforms contain alternate six amino acids at the C terminus (Fig. 1A). The pro-angiogenic isoforms such as VEGF165 encode a terminal six amino acid sequence of CDKPRR, and the anti-angiogenic isoforms such as VEGF165b encode SLTRKD (7.Bates D.O. Cui T.G. Doughty J.M. Winkler M. Sugiono M. Shields J.D. Peat D. Gillatt D. Harper S.J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4123-4131PubMed Google Scholar). Many normal tissues, including the eye generate both isoforms (8.Perrin R.M. Konopatskaya O. Qiu Y. Harper S. Bates D.O. Churchill A.J. Diabetologia. 2005; 48: 2422-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and previous studies have shown that the anti-angiogenic isoforms dominate in non-angiogenic tissues such as the normal colon (9.Varey A.H.

In contrast, in non-angiogenic conditions where VEGF is up-regulated, such as glaucoma and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment associated with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (13.Dieudonné S.C. La Heij E.C. Diederen R.M. Kessels A.G. Liem A.T. Kijlstra A. Hendrikse F. Ophthalmic. Res. 2007; 39: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or glaucoma (14.Ergorul C. Ray A. Huang W. Darland D. Luo Z.K. Grosskreutz C.L. Mol. Vis. 2008; 14: 1517-1524PubMed Google Scholar), the anti-angiogenic isoforms are up-regulated. We have previously shown that IGF-1 can switch splicing in cultured epithelial cells from anti-angiogenic to pro-angiogenic isoforms (15.Nowak D.G. Woolard J. Amin E.M. Konopatskaya O.

As IGF-1 has been implicated in a number of angiogenic conditions including diabetic retinopathy and colon cancer, we hypothesized that the mechanism through which IGF-1 mediates this change in splicing may be a potential therapeutic target to prevent angiogenesis. To this end, we have investigated the signaling pathways, the splicing factors involved, and the possibility of therapeutic intervention in the pathway in an animal model of diabetic retinopathy.

More recent research has also identified scaling regularities in the dynamics underlying the successive occurrences of events, suggesting the possibility of similar findings for language as well.By considering frequent words in USENET discussion groups and in disparate databases where the language has different levels of formality, here we show that the distributions of distances between successive occurrences of the same word display bursty deviations from a Poisson process and are well characterized by a stretched exponential (Weibull) scaling. The extent of this deviation depends strongly on semantic type -- a measure of the logicality of each word -- and less strongly on frequency. We develop a generative model of this behavior that fully determines the dynamics of word usage.Recurrence patterns of words are well described by a stretched exponential distribution of recurrence times, an empirical scaling that cannot be anticipated from Zipf's law. Because the use of words provides a uniquely precise and powerful lens on human thought and activity, our findings also have implications for other overt manifestations of collective human dynamics."

https://openalex.org/W2012381088,"Synaptic transmission depends on neurotransmitter pools stored within vesicles that undergo regulated exocytosis. In the brain, the vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT(2)) is responsible for the loading of dopamine (DA) and other monoamines into synaptic vesicles. Prior to storage within vesicles, DA synthesis occurs at the synaptic terminal in a two-step enzymatic process. First, the rate-limiting enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) converts tyrosine to di-OH-phenylalanine. Aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) then converts di-OH-phenylalanine into DA. Here, we provide evidence that VMAT(2) physically and functionally interacts with the enzymes responsible for DA synthesis. In rat striata, TH and AADC co-immunoprecipitate with VMAT(2), whereas in PC 12 cells, TH co-immunoprecipitates with the closely related VMAT(1) and with overexpressed VMAT(2). GST pull-down assays further identified three cytosolic domains of VMAT(2) involved in the interaction with TH and AADC. Furthermore, in vitro binding assays demonstrated that TH directly interacts with VMAT(2). Additionally, using fractionation and immunoisolation approaches, we demonstrate that TH and AADC associate with VMAT(2)-containing synaptic vesicles from rat brain. These vesicles exhibited specific TH activity. Finally, the coupling between synthesis and transport of DA into vesicles was impaired in the presence of fragments involved in the VMAT(2)/TH/AADC interaction. Taken together, our results indicate that DA synthesis can occur at the synaptic vesicle membrane, where it is physically and functionally coupled to VMAT(2)-mediated transport into vesicles."

Expression of these immune-associated genes is a highly regulated process to assure that the epithelium recognizes and responds to invading pathogens, but does not induce injury through an inappropriate immune response. Recent reports suggest the microRNA machinery contributes to the regulation of the immune-associated gene expression. MicroRNAs are small (21–23 nt) RNA molecules that target and regulate the stability or translational efficiency of mRNAs (11Bartel D.P. Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28978) Google Scholar). These regulatory RNAs are transcribed as mono- or polycistronic primary microRNAs (pri-microRNAs), which are sequentially processed to precursor and the functionally active mature microRNA. The molecular mechanisms regulating the expression of most microRNAs remain largely unknown.Using a human cholangiocyte cell culture model of biliary cryptosporidiosis, we previously reported that let-7i, a member of the let-7 family of microRNAs, targets Toll-like receptor 4 mRNA and limits the expression of this pathogen molecular pattern receptor resulting in decreased primary and mature let-7i expression (3Chen X.M. Splinter P.L. O'Hara S.P. LaRusso N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28929-28938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the expression of let-7i is responsive to pathogen recognition and regulated through primary-microRNA transcription. In the present report, we describe a novel transcriptional mechanism mediating the regulation of the primary let-7i transcript expressed in cholangiocytes. We demonstrate that the NFκB p50 subunit and the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ), which belongs to the larger family of basic leucine zipper (b-Zip) transcription factors (12Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1897-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar), form an inducible silencing complex in let-7i promoter following microbial stimulus. Overexpression or siRNA inhibition of these transcription factors had reciprocal effects on our let-7i promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene, whereas deletion of the putative NFκB binding sites abrogates the observed microbe or NFκB p50-induced decrease in reporter gene expression. Furthermore, under basal conditions, the promoter is associated with acetylated histones and is permissive for transcription; however, following NFκB p50 and C/EBPβ overexpression, this locus is associated with deacetylated histone H3, which promotes chromatin condensation and hence locus silencing. These results suggest that transcription of let-7i is regulated by both p50 and C/EBPβ, which may exist in an inducible inhibitory complex that promotes microRNA silencing, a process with potential implications for epithelial innate immune responses in general.DISCUSSIONThe results of our study provide the first direct evidence that microbial stimuli regulate the expression of a microRNA via the inflammation-associated transcription factors NFκB p50 and C/EBPβ. Using a human cholangiocyte model, we have shown that: (i) let-7i is expressed as an independent transcriptional unit in these cells; (ii) C/EBPβ and the p50 subunit, but not the p65 subunit, of NFκB repress transcription through interactions with the let-7i promoter following microbial stimulus; (iii) the consensus κB binding sites confer responsiveness of the reporter gene following microbial stimulus; and (iv) forced expression of either NFκB p50 or C/EBPβ results in chromatin deacetylation and let-7i transcription suppression. Our findings provide novel data regarding transcriptional regulation of microRNA expression in cholangiocytes in response to pathogen recognition, a process that may have implications in immune-related functions and inflammatory responses of epithelia in general and in cholangiocytes in particular.Cholangiocytes express a variety of pathogen recognition receptors and actively participate in the innate immune response through the secretion of cytokines/chemokines (5Chen X.M.

Immunol. 2005; 175: 7447-7456Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Here we have identified and characterized the full-length primary let-7i transcript, a microRNA we previously demonstrated targets and regulates TLR4 expression in cholangiocytes (3Chen X.M. Splinter P.L. O'Hara S.P. LaRusso N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28929-28938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). We further demonstrated that this microRNA is transcriptionally regulated following microbial stimulus, a process we propose conditions the cholangiocyte intracellular microenvironment for enhanced responses to microbial challenges and promotion of the innate immune response.The extent of microRNA involvement in the initiation or attenuation of inflammatory cascades is not well characterized. However, using a monocytic leukemia cell line, it was demonstrated that several microRNAs are up-regulated upon stimulation with LPS. At least one of the up-regulated microRNAs targets IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK1), and TRAF6, both with established roles in TLR and proinflammatory cytokine signaling cascades (16Taganov K.D. Boldin M.P. Chang K.J. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12481-12486Crossref PubMed Scopus (3453) Google Scholar). Conversely, using a human cholangiocyte cell culture model of biliary cryptosporidiosis, we reported that infection of cultured human cholangiocytes with C. parvum results in decreased let-7i expression. Decreased let-7i expression resulted in up-regulation of TLR4 in infected cells, and increased NFκB signaling (3Chen X.M. Splinter P.L. O'Hara S.P. LaRusso N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28929-28938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The work presented here provides a generalizable mechanism of transcription factor-dependent reduction of let-7i expression. Hence, it is plausible, if not likely that the transcriptional regulation of microRNA synthesis and microRNA-regulated post-transcriptional pathways contribute to host-cell responses to microbial infection, either through increasing inflammatory signaling in response to pathogens (3Chen X.M. Splinter P.L. O'Hara S.P. LaRusso N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28929-28938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) or attenuation of the inflammatory response (16Taganov K.D. Boldin M.P. Chang K.J. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12481-12486Crossref PubMed Scopus (3453) Google Scholar).Our results demonstrate a functional role for the NFκB p50 subunit and C/EBPβ in modulating let-7i transcription. We demonstrate that these proteins are complexed and interacting with the let-7i promoter following microbial stimulus. Therefore, the spatial distribution of these proteins within the nucleus of microbially stimulated cells and their demonstrated physical interaction support the feasibility of a repressive complex of proteins. Our data support a model in which upon microbial stimulus, a complex of these two proteins represses transcription through chromatin deacetylation, a well-established mechanism for gene silencing. The C/EBP family of transcription factors, together with AP-1 and ATF/CREB, belong to the b-ZIP class of DNA-binding proteins (17Vinson C.R. Sigler P.B. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 246: 911-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). The functional interaction between C/EBPβ and NFκB has been described previously (18Agrawal A. Cha-Molstad H. Samols D. Kushner I. Immunology. 2003; 108: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 19Cha-Molstad H. Young D.P. Kushner I. Samols D. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 2933-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Stein B. Cogswell P.C. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3964-3974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including, most recently, the functional interaction between C/EBPβ and the p50 subunit of NFκB in regulating the antiapoptotic protein, Nur77, in testicular Leydig cells (21El-Asmar B. Giner X.C. Tremblay J.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2009; 42: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This interaction can either synergistically promote the expression of immune or acute-phase response elements but can also repress transcription (20Stein B. Cogswell P.C. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3964-3974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ralph Jr., W.M. Liu K. Auborn K.J. J. Gen. Virol. 2006; 87: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The ability of C/EBPβ to function as a transcriptional activator or repressor has been attributed to the expression of different C/EBPβ isoforms generated by leaky ribosomal scanning of the primary mRNA (23Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Three isoforms have been characterized: liver-enriched transcriptional activator protein 1 (LAP1), liver-enriched transcriptional activator protein 2 (LAP2), and liver-enriched inhibitory protein (LIP). LAP1 and -2 contain dimerization and DNA binding domains, a transcriptional regulatory domain, and function as dimeric transcriptional regulators. LIP lacks the regulatory domain and is thought to function as a dominant negative inhibitor of LAPs (23Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 24Grimm S.L. Rosen J.M. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2003; 8: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The force-expressed C/EBPβ used in our reporter assays (LAP2) contains a conservative ATG to ATC mutation (Met to Ile) that eliminates the LIP start codon and hence is incapable of forming inhibitory LIP (25Gomis R.R. Alarcón C. Nadal C. Van Poznak C. Massagué J. Cancer Cell. 2006; 10: 203-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Additionally, we were unable to detect the 27-kDa LIP protein in the p50/C/EBPβ immunoprecipitations. We therefore propose, and our data support, that upon microbial insult, C/EBPβ LAP and the p50 subunit of NFκB functionally repress transcription of the microRNA, let-7i, through the induction of chromatin remodeling.The let-7 family of microRNAs consists of 12 genes that encode nine distinct mature let-7 microRNAs designated let-7a-let-7i. The mature forms of these microRNAs, and the highly similar mir-98, differ from the consensus let-7a by one to four nucleotides. Currently, the transcriptional mechanisms regulating the expression of primary let-7 are not well defined. However, post-transcriptional mechanisms have been implicated in the regulation of mature microRNA expression, including the let-7 family. For instance, post-transcriptional regulation has been demonstrated at the level of Drosha (26Thomson J.M. Newman M. Parker J.S. Morin-Kensicki E.M. Wright T. Hammond S.M. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2202-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 27Viswanathan S.R. Daley G.Q. Gregory R.I. Science. 2008; 320: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar) and/or Dicer (28Obernosterer G. Leuschner P.J. Alenius M. Martinez J. Rna. 2006; 12: 1161-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), which enables the expression of either the primary or precursor microRNA, whereas expression of the mature, functional microRNA is inhibited (26Thomson J.M. Newman M. Parker J.S. Morin-Kensicki E.M. Wright T. Hammond S.M. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2202-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). In addition, the regulated processing of microRNAs has been observed in embryonic tissues and human cancers (26Thomson J.M. Newman M. Parker J.S. Morin-Kensicki E.M. Wright T. Hammond S.M. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2202-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). Specifically, Lin-28, a small developmentally regulated RNA-binding protein, was shown to selectively block the processing of precursor let-7 family members in embryonic cells (27Viswanathan S.R. Daley G.Q. Gregory R.I. Science. 2008; 320: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). Additionally, methylation-dependent regulation of several microRNAs was observed in human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines force expressing IL-6 (29Meng F. Wehbe-Janek H. Henson R. Smith H. Patel T. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 378-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We were unable to detect methylation at the let-7i promoter region under basal or microbe-stimulated conditions. Hence, in addition to post-transcriptional regulation of let-7 microRNAs, our current data provide a mechanism of transcription factor-induced repression following microbial insult involving both NFκB p50 and C/EBPβ.In summary, we have identified and characterized the primary let-7i transcript expressed in human cholangiocytes. Using a cell culture model of cholangiocyte response to pathogens, we have defined a novel transcription mechanism mediating repression of let-7i primary transcript expression, a process that may contribute to the innate immune-associated phenotype, which actively participates in the defense response against pathogens and immune/inflammatory responses in general. It will be of interest to extend these studies to confirm the existence of an inhibitory complex of proteins, identify the full complement of proteins within this repressive complex, determine the extent of microRNAs regulated via this mechanism, and address the functional consequences of this microRNA repression under normal and pathological conditions.

Although lesions of EGCs are associated with neuronal degeneration in animal models, their direct neuroprotective role remains unknown. Therefore, the aims of this study were to demonstrate the direct neuroprotective effects of EGCs and to identify putative glial mediators involved. First, viral targeted ablation of EGCs in primary cultures of enteric nervous system increased neuronal death both under basal conditions and in the presence of oxidative stress (dopamine, hydrogen peroxide). Second, direct or indirect coculture experiments of EGC lines with primary cultures of enteric nervous system or neuroblastoma cell lines (SH-SY5Y) prevented neurotoxic effects induced by oxidative stress (increased membrane permeability, release of neuronal specific enolase, caspase-3 immunoreactivity, changes in [Ca(2+)](i) response). Finally, combining pharmacological inhibition and mRNA silencing methods, we demonstrated that neuroprotective effects of EGCs were mediated in part by reduced glutathione but not by oxidized glutathione or by S-nitrosoglutathione. Our study identified the neuroprotective effects of EGCs via their release of reduced glutathione, extending their critical role in physiological contexts and in enteric neuropathies.-Abdo, H., Derkinderen, P., Gomes, P., Chevalier, J., Aubert, P., Masson, D., Galmiche, J.-P., Vanden Berghe, P., Neunlist, M., Lardeux, B.

Therefore, the availability of online pathway browsers will facilitate post-genomic research, just as genome browsers have contributed to genomics. Many pathway maps have been provided online as part of public pathway databases. Most of these maps, however, function as the gateway interface to a specific database, and the comprehensiveness of their represented entities, data mapping capabilities, and user interfaces are not always sufficient for generic usage.We have identified five central requirements for a pathway browser: (1) availability of large integrated maps showing genes, enzymes, and metabolites; (2) comprehensive search features and data access; (3) data mapping for transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic experiments, as well as the ability to edit and annotate pathway maps; (4) easy exchange of pathway data; and (5) intuitive user experience without the requirement for installation and regular maintenance. According to these requirements, we have evaluated existing pathway databases and tools and implemented a web-based pathway browser named Pathway Projector as a solution.Pathway Projector provides integrated pathway maps that are based upon the KEGG Atlas, with the addition of nodes for genes and enzymes, and is implemented as a scalable, zoomable map utilizing the Google Maps API. Users can search pathway-related data using keywords, molecular weights, nucleotide sequences, and amino acid sequences, or as possible routes between compounds. In addition, experimental data from transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses can be readily mapped. Pathway Projector is freely available for academic users at (http://www.g-language.org/PathwayProjector/)."

Transient transfection of cells with a TAg expression vector also induced G2 checkpoint signaling and G2 arrest. Analysis of TAg mutants with different subnuclear localizations suggested that the association of TAg with cellular DNA contributes to the induction of G2 arrest. Abrogation of G2 arrest by inhibition of ATM and ATR, Chk1, and Wee1 suppressed JCV genome replication. In addition, abrogation of the G2-M transition by Cdc2 depletion disabled Wee1 depletion-induced suppression of JCV genome replication, suggesting that JCV replication is facilitated by G2 arrest resulting from G2 checkpoint signaling. Moreover, inhibition of ATM and ATR by caffeine suppressed JCV production. The observation that oligodendrocytes productively infected with JCV in vivo also undergo G2 arrest suggests that G2 checkpoint inhibitors such as caffeine are potential therapeutic agents for JCV infection.

JCV infection usually occurs during childhood, but remains subclinical. However, opportunistic reactivation of JCV results in the development of PML in individuals with a compromised immune system, such as those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or advanced-stage malignant tumors, or those recently having undergone organ transplantation with immunosuppressive therapy (1Berger J.R. Curr. Neurol. Neurosci. Rep. 2007; 7: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). There is currently no effective or specific therapy for PML, even though the incidence of this condition is increasing with the growing number of individuals with AIDS. human polyomavirus JC virus progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy large T antigen simian virus 40 replication protein A ataxia telangiectasia mutated ATM- and Rad3-related single-stranded DNA phosphate-buffered saline small interfering RNA fluorescein isothiocyanate propidium iodide 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine hemagglutination days postinoculation green fluorescent protein origin DNA binding domain wild-type nuclear residue heterochromatin protein 1α. JCV is a small virus with a double-stranded DNA genome that encodes early proteins (large T antigen, small t antigen, and T′ antigen) and late proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3, and agnoprotein) (2Frisque R.J. Bream G.L. Cannella M.T. J. Virol. 1984; 51: 458-469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The entry of JCV into the nucleus of an infected cell is followed by transcription of the early genes and the production of large T antigen (TAg). The replication of JCV DNA progresses in association with the accumulation of TAg, which subsequently stimulates transcription of late genes and represses that of the early genes (3Chen N.N. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5843-5848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). JCV TAg shares 72% amino acid sequence identity with TAg of simian virus 40 (SV40), another primate polyomavirus, and, like SV40 TAg, it is necessary for replication of the viral genome as a result of its DNA binding and helicase activities. The replication of polyomaviruses also requires DNA replication proteins of the host cell, such as DNA polymerase α, topoisomerases, and replication protein A (RPA) (4Bullock P.A. Seo Y.S. Hurwitz J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2350-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 5Fairman M.P. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1211-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), with such host cell factors being thought to serve as determinants of host specificity (6Schneider C. Weisshart K. Guarino L.A. Dornreiter I. Fanning E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3176-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The utilization of such cellular proteins requires that polyomaviruses replicate in a phase of the cell cycle in which they are available. Polyomavirus TAg thus modulates cellular signaling pathways to induce quiescent cells to enter S phase, in which cellular DNA is replicated (7Dickmanns A. Zeitvogel A. Simmersbach F. Weber R. Arthur A.K. Dehde S. Wildeman A.G. Fanning E. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5496-5508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A key event in this process is the interaction of TAg with members of the retinoblastoma protein family, which results in inactivation of retinoblastoma protein and in consequent progression of the cell cycle (8Caracciolo V. Reiss K. Khalili K. De Falco G. Giordano A. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 5294-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Moreover, polyomaviruses are thought to take advantage of the DNA damage response to enhance viral replication. SV40 lytic infection thus triggers the DNA damage checkpoint, resulting in a bypass of mitosis and additional replication of cellular and viral DNA (9Okubo E. Lehman J.M. Friedrich T.D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 1257-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and murine polyomavirus-infected cells accumulate in S and G2 phases (10Lehman J.M. Laffin J. Friedrich T.D. Cytometry. 1994; 16: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Replication of viral DNA in cells infected with SV40 or murine polyomavirus has also been recently shown to activate the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-mediated signaling pathway and thereby promote viral replication (11Dahl J. You J. Benjamin T.L. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 13007-13017Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 12Shi Y. Dodson G.E. Shaikh S. Rundell K. Tibbetts R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40195-40200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how polyomaviruses trigger DNA damage signaling. DNA damage checkpoints are biochemical pathways that delay or arrest cell cycle progression in response to DNA damage or replication stress. In mammalian cells, the DNA damage checkpoint is usually activated by ATM or ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR), both of which are members of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like kinase family. ATM is recruited to DNA double strand breaks by the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex (13Lee J.H. Paull T.T. Science. 2005; 308: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar), whereas ATR is recruited by ATR-interacting protein to RPA-coated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that accumulates at stalled DNA replication forks, or is generated by the processing of the initial DNA damage (14Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). The Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 (9:1:1) complex is also recruited to RPA-coated ssDNA and brings the ATR activator, topoisomerase-binding protein-1. After their recruitment to sites of DNA damage, ATM and ATR phosphorylate various substrate proteins, including Chk1 and Chk2, which in turn phosphorylate downstream factors to induce cell cycle arrest and facilitate DNA repair (16Chaturvedi P. Eng W.K. Zhu Y. Mattern M.R. Mishra R. Hurle M.R. Zhang X. Annan R.S. Lu Q. Faucette L.F. Scott G.F. Li X. Carr S.A. Johnson R.K. Winkler J.D. Zhou B.B.

Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The G2-M cell cycle transition is controlled by the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc2 (also known as Cdk1), which is positively regulated by cyclin B and negatively regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (18Nurse P. Nature. 1990; 344: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2220) Google Scholar). In response to ATM- or ATR-mediated activation of the DNA damage checkpoint, the inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdc2 is maintained by the kinase Wee1 and by inactivation of the phosphatase Cdc25 to arrest cells at the G2-M transition and to block entry into mitosis (19Raleigh J.M. O'Connell M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1727-1736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ATM and ATR also phosphorylate p53 at Ser15 (20Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C. Reiss Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1698) Google Scholar), resulting in inhibition of the interaction of p53 with Mdm2 (21Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar) and in p53 stabilization. Cdc2 is inhibited by the products of p53 target genes, including the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, Gadd45, and 14-3-3σ (22Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P.

Cells arrested at G2-M in this manner are able to resume cell cycle progression after abrogation of the checkpoint response subsequent to completion of DNA repair, unless the DNA damage is irreparable and leads to apoptosis (25Yoo H.Y. Kumagai A. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 2004; 117: 575-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We have now investigated the relationship between JCV replication and the host cell cycle to identify the cellular machinery required for JCV replication. We found that JCV TAg triggers the ATM- and ATR-mediated G2 checkpoint pathways and consequent G2 arrest during viral DNA replication. This function of TAg was shown to correlate with its association with cellular DNA. We also show that caffeine, an inhibitor of ATM and ATR function, markedly suppressed JCV replication and propagation after establishment of infection in host cells. Human neuroblastoma IMR-32 cells (HSRRB, Osaka, Japan) were maintained under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids. For virus infection, IMR-32 cells were inoculated with JCV (200 HAU/ml), prepared from JCV-producing JCI cells (26Nukuzuma S. Yogo Y. Guo J. Nukuzuma C. Itoh S. Shinohara T. Nagashima K. J. Med. Virol. 1995; 47: 370-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) in growth culture medium for 24 h and then transferred to fresh medium without virus. The JCV TAg expression vectors pCXN2-JCV TAg and pCMV-FLAG-JCV TAg were constructed from pBR-Mad1. The ΔOBD, E461D, E461A, R541K, and K617R mutants of JCV TAg were generated by polymerase chain reaction-mediated mutagenesis of pCMV-FLAG-JCV TAg with appropriate primers. All constructs were verified by sequencing and subcloned into pCXN2. The pCXN2-GFP and pCXN2-red fluorescent protein vectors were also generated as controls. For the assays of viral DNA replication, the full-length transcriptional control region of JCV Mad1 was subcloned into pBluescript II SK(+), and the resulting construct was designated pBS-JCori (27Orba Y. Sunden Y. Suzuki T. Nagashima K. Kimura T. Tanaka S. Sawa H. Virology. 2008; 370: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Caffeine and KU55933 (both from Sigma) were dissolved at 100 and 10 mm, respectively, in deionized water and dimethyl sulfoxide. UCN-01 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) was dissolved in 1 mm dimethyl sulfoxide. A mouse monoclonal antibody to SV40 TAg (pAb416), which was previously shown to cross-react with JCV TAg (28Okada Y.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to JCV TAg (JCT652), JCV VP1, and JCV Agnoprotein were generated as described (28Okada Y. Sawa H. Endo S. Orba Y. Umemura T. Nishihara H. Stan A.C. Tanaka S. Takahashi H.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the Thr21-phosphorylated form of RPA32 were prepared by Immuno-Biological Laboratories (Gunma, Japan) with a thyroglobulin-conjugated synthetic phosphopeptide corresponding to amino acid residues 16 to 29 of the human RPA32 (GAGGYpTQSPGGFGC). The immunoglobulin G fraction specific for the peptide was isolated from serum by chromatography on a column of antigen-coupled activated thiol-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare). Antibodies to Chk1, Ser317-phosphorylated Chk1, Chk2, Thr68-phosphorylated Chk2, Tyr15-phosphorylated Cdc2, and Ser15-phosphorylated p53 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Additional antibodies included those to ATR (N-19), Wee1 (B-11) and lamin A/C (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), Ser139-phosphorylated histone H2A.X (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY), Cdc2 and cyclin B (BD Biosciences), cyclin B1 (Novocastra, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK), p53 (DO-7; Dako, Carpinteria, CA), topoisomerase-binding protein-1, actin, and HP1α (Chemicon Millipore, Billerica, MA), RPA32 (Neomarkers, Fremont, CA), and FLAG M2 (Sigma). IMR-32 cells seeded onto 3.5-cm dishes were transfected with the indicated constructs by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) 3 days before collection. Virus-infected cells were harvested at 2 weeks after inoculation with JCV. Cells were harvested by exposure to trypsin, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and fixed overnight at −20 °C with 70% ethanol. For flow cytometric analysis of TAg or VP1 expression, cells were washed with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated antibodies to TAg (pAb108, BD Biosciences) and antibodies to VP1 and allophycocyanin-labeled secondary antibodies. For cell cycle analysis, DNA content was measured by staining the cells for 30 min at room temperature with propidium iodide (PI) (10 μg/ml) in PBS containing RNase A (0.1 mg/ml). Flow cytometry was performed with a FACSCanto system (BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed with Flowjo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). All analysis was performed with the PI-A (area) versus PI-W (width) subset to exclude doublet cells. IMR-32 cells seeded onto glass-bottom dishes or chamber slides were transfected with the indicated constructs at 3 days before fixation. Virus-infected cells were seeded onto poly-l-lysine-coated slide glasses and fixed at 2 weeks after inoculation with JCV. Cells were fixed for 3 min in 100% methanol at −20 °C, exposed to 1% bovine serum albumin to block nonspecific sites, and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were visualized by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. For sequential double immunostaining of TAg, the cells were incubated with pAb416 or JCT652 antibodies to Tag, and then with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). Cell nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Invitrogen). Fluorescence signals were detected with an FV-1000 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). For visualization of chromatin- or nuclear matrix-associated proteins, HeLa cells were seeded onto chamber slide glasses and transfected with the indicated constructs. The cells were then washed with PBS, incubated for 5 min on ice in isotonic Triton buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 300 mm sucrose) to remove cytoplasmic and soluble nuclear proteins, washed three times with PBS, and fixed in ice-cold 100% methanol for 3 min. For preparation of the nuclear matrix, after treatment of cells with isotonic Triton buffer, chromatin was digested for 20 min at room temperature with DNase I (100 μg/ml, Sigma) in isotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 300 mm sucrose) and then extracted for 2 min at room temperature with a solution containing 0.25 m ammonium sulfate, 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), and 0.2 mm MgCl2. The remaining nuclear matrix was washed with PBS and fixed with ice-cold methanol for 3 min. Fluorescence signals were detected with an inverted fluorescence and phase-contrast microscope (IX70, Olympus), and images were collected with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera with the use of DP controller software (Olympus). Cells were exposed to 10 μm EdU (Invitrogen) in culture medium for 45 min. For flow cytometric analysis of EdU incorporation and TAg expression, cells were fixed overnight with 70% ethanol at −20 °C. After staining with the FITC-labeled antibody to TAg as described above, EdU was detected with Alexa Fluor 647-azide with the use of a Click-iT EdU Flow Cytometry Assay Kit (Invitrogen). Flow cytometry was performed as described above. For immunocytofluorescence analysis, cells were fixed with 100% methanol for 3 min at −20 °C before detection of EdU with Alexa Fluor 647-azide. Sequential double immunostaining was performed with a monoclonal antibody to cyclin B and polyclonal antibodies to JCV Tag, and immune complexes were visualized with Alexa Fluor 405- or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen), respectively. IMR-32 cells seeded onto 12-well dishes were transfected with the indicated constructs 3 days before collection. Virus-infected cells were collected at the indicated times after inoculation with JCV. For induction of DNA damage, cells were exposed to UV (10 J/m2) with the use of a UV Cross-linker (UVP, Upland, CA) for 2 h prior to collection. Cells were suspended in RIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholic acid, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture 1 (Sigma)). Lysate proteins (10 μg) were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies. Immune complexes were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA), Immobilon Western HRP Substrate (Millipore), and a LAS-1000 Plus system (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, complete protease inhibitor mixture, and phosphatase inhibitor mixture 1). Lysed protein was immunoprecipitated with Dynabeads Protein G (Invitrogen) for 2 h at 4 °C after coating with FLAG M2 antibody. Protein complexes were eluted with SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 4% SDS, 10% sucrose, and 0.04% bromphenol blue) after washing with immunoprecipitation lysis buffer. For nuclear fractionation, IMR-32 cells transfected with the indicated constructs were subjected to sequential extraction as described previously (31Wang Q.E. Zhu Q. Wani G. Chen J. Wani A.A. Carcinogenesis. 2004; 25: 1033-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 32Rapić-Otrin V. McLenigan M.P. Bisi D.C. Gonzalez M. Levine A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2588-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), with some modifications. One-tenth of the harvested cells were lysed with RIPA buffer to obtain a whole cell extract. The remaining cells were suspended in buffer A (0.05% Triton X-100, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.8), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and complete protease inhibitor mixture) and centrifuged at 700 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to yield the soluble cytoplasmic extract. The nuclear pellet was washed with buffer A, suspended, and incubated for 5 min on ice in isotonic Triton buffer supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and complete protease inhibitor mixture, then centrifuged at 700 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to yield the nuclear soluble extract. The associated nuclear pellet was washed with isotonic Triton buffer and further extracted consecutively with increasing concentrations of NaCl (0.25, 0.5, and 1 m) in a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 0.2 mm MgCl2 to yield chromatin-associated proteins. The final nuclear residue (NR) consisting of DNA and nuclear matrix was dissolved by ultrasonic treatment in RIPA buffer. Equal amounts of protein for each fraction were then subjected to immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies. The nuclear matrix was also prepared as described previously (33He D.C. Nickerson J.A. Penman S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). After treatment of the initial nuclear pellet with isotonic Triton buffer, as described above, chromatin was digested for 30 min at room temperature with DNase I (100 μg/ml) in the same buffer and then extracted by incubation with 0.25 m ammonium sulfate for 5 min at room temperature. The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to yield a supernatant containing chromatin-associated proteins and a pellet containing insoluble and nuclear matrix proteins. The pellet was suspended in a solution containing 8 m urea, 100 mm NaH2PO4, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Equal amounts of protein for each fraction were then subjected to immunoblot analysis. The siRNA constructs were obtained as the siGENOME SMARTpool, ATR (M-003202), WEE1 (M-005050; Dharmacon, Thermo Scientific, Lafayette, CO), and CDC2 HP Validated siRNA (SI00299726; Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The non-targeting control siRNA was obtained from Qiagen. IMR-32 cells were transfected with 20 nm siRNA diluted in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) with the use of Lipofectamine RNAi MAX reagent (Invitrogen) according to the reverse transfection protocol of the manufacturer. After 24 h, the cells were transfected with pCXN2-JCV TAg or the empty vector, or pCXN2-JCV TAg and pBS-JCori for replication assay, with the use of Lipofectamine 2000, and cultured for 2 or 3 days. KU55933 (20 μm) or dimethyl sulfoxide (control) was added to the cells 15 h before collection. IMR-32 cells or siRNA-transfected IMR-32 cells were seeded onto 3.5-cm dishes and transfected with pBS-JCori and pCXN2-JCV TAg. One day after transfection, caffeine (2.5 mm), UCN-01 (50 nm), or dimethyl sulfoxide was added to the cells and cultured for an additional 24 h. Low molecular weight DNA was isolated from the cells as described previously (34Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar), incubated for 1 h at 56 °C with proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml), and precipitated with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol/ethanol. The DNA was suspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA) containing RNase A (75 μg/ml), and a 5-μg portion was digested with EcoRI and DpnI, the latter of which selectively digests transfected DNA that has been methylated during prokaryotic replication. The products of digestion were fractionated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel, and DNA fragments were transferred to a Hybond N+ membrane (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) by capillary transfer in ×20 standard saline citrate and then exposed to a digoxigenin-labeled DNA probe targeted to a vector-derived, ampicillin-resistant DNA sequence (DIG High Prime DNA Labeling and Detection Starter Kit II, Roche). Hybridization signals were detected with the LAS-1000 Plus system, and replication activities were determined by quantifying the intensity of the bands with the use of Multi Gauge software (Fujifilm). Measurement of JCV titer was based on HA of human type O erythrocytes as described previously (35Suzuki S. Sawa H. Komagome R. Orba Y. Yamada M. Okada Y. Ishida Y. Nishihara H. Tanaka S. Nagashima K. Virology. 2001; 286: 100-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Human blood was supplied from the Hokkaido Red Cross Blood Center. For analysis of viral proliferation, caffeine (1 or 2 mm) was added to JCV-infected IMR-32 cells at 7, 10, and 13 days postinoculation (d.p.i.) and the cells were collected at 13 or 16 d.p.i. The JCV in 5 × 106 cells was extracted by exposing the cells to 3 freeze-thaw cycles in 150 μl of Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. The extract was incubated for 15 h at 37 °C with neuraminidase (0.05 units/ml), and, after inactivation of neuraminidase for 30 min at 56 °C, it was centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was then subjected to the HA assay. 2-Fold serial dilutions of the supernatant (25 μl) in PBS (adjusted to pH 7.15) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin were added to the wells of a 96-well, V-bottomed microplate, and an equal volume of 0.5% red blood cells in PBS (pH 7.15) was added to each well. The mixture was incubated for 3 h at 4 °C, and the HA titer of the virus was then determined as the highest dilution resulting in HA. A surgical specimen was obtained from the brain of an individual with PML positive for JCV VP1 immunostaining. This aspect of the study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine. The tissue was fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned. Paraffin was then removed from the sections, and antigen retrieval was performed in 10 mm citrate buffer (pH 6.0) by placing the sections in a pressure cooker for 3 min. The sections were exposed to 10% normal goat serum and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with a monoclonal antibody to cyclin B1 or with polyclonal antibodies to Ser15-phosphorylated p53 or Thr21-phosphorylated RPA32. Immune complexes were detected by incubation for 90 min at room temperature with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies. The sections were then incubated with polyclonal antibodies to JCV TAg or monoclonal antibodies to TAg, and immune complexes were detected with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibodies. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI, and the sections were then stained with 1% Sudan black B for 5 min to quench the autofluorescence of brain tissue. Fluorescence was then observed with an inverted fluorescence and phase-contrast microscope, and images were obtained as described above. We first investigated the cell cycle in human neuroblastoma IMR-32 cells, which are permissive for JCV replication, expressing JCV early (TAg) or late (VP1) proteins 2 weeks after virus inoculation. Flow cytometric analysis of cells stained for DNA with PI revealed that those expressing TAg (TAg+ and TAg+VP1+ cells) accumulated at the G2/M phase, whereas those expressing VP1 (VP1+ cells) showed a cell cycle profile similar to that of noninfected cells or cells not expressing TAg or VP1 (TAg−VP1− cells) (Fig. 1A). Given that TAg is indispensable for viral DNA replication, the JCV genome would be expected to be replicated in TAg-expressing cells. We next examined DNA synthesis in JCV-infected cells by measurement of EdU incorporation. TAg-expressing cells incorporated less EdU than cells in S phase, even though they expressed cyclin B in the cytoplasm (36Toyoshima F. Moriguchi T. Wada A. Fukuda M. Nishida E.

Elevation of endogenous FPP by the squalene synthetase inhibitor zaragozic acid A (ZGA) or addition of FPP to the cell culture medium results in activation and nuclear translocation of the GR, a known wound healing inhibitor. We used functional studies to evaluate the effects of FPP on wound healing. Both FPP and ZGA inhibited keratinocyte migration and epithelialization in vitro and ex vivo. These effects were independent of farnesylation and indicate that modulation of FPP levels in skin may be beneficial for wound healing. FPP inhibition of keratinocyte migration and wound healing proceeds, in part, by repression of the keratin 6 gene. Furthermore, we show that the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA-reductase inhibitor mevastatin, which blocks FPP formation, not only promotes epithelialization in acute wounds but also reverses the effect of ZGA on activation of the GR and inhibition of epithelialization. We conclude that FPP inhibits wound healing by acting as a GR agonist. Of special interest is that FPP is naturally present in cells prior to glucocorticoid synthesis and that FPP levels can be further altered by the statins.

To characterize the effects of PGC-1 on lipid metabolism, we overexpressed PGC-1α and PGC-1β in C2C12 myotubes using adenoviral vectors. Both PGC-1α and -1β increased palmitate oxidation [31% (P<0.01) and 26% (P<0.05) respectively] despite reductions in cellular uptake [by 6% (P<0.05) and 21% (P<0.001)]. Moreover, PGC-1α and-1β increased mRNA expression of genes regulating both lipid oxidation (e.g., CPT1b and ACADL/M) and synthesis (FAS, CS, ACC1/2, and DGAT1). To determine the net effect, we assessed lipid composition in PGC-1-expressing cells. Total lipid content decreased by 42% in palmitate-loaded serum-starved cells overexpressing PGC-1α (P<0.05). In contrast, in serum-replete cells, total lipid content was not significantly altered, but fatty acids C14:0, C16:0, C18:0, and C18:1 were increased 2- to 4-fold for PGC-1α/β (P<0.05). Stable isotope-based dynamic metabolic profiling in serum-replete cells labeled with 13C substrates revealed both increased de novo fatty acid synthesis from glucose and increased fatty acid synthesis by chain elongation with either PGC-1α or -1β expression. These results indicate that PGC-1 can promote both lipid oxidation and synthesis, with net balance determined by the nutrient/hormonal environment.—Espinoza, D. O., Boros, L.

https://openalex.org/W2013933380,"Expression of the calcium channels Ca(V)2.1 and Ca(V)2.2 is markedly suppressed by co-expression with truncated constructs containing Domain I. This is the basis for the phenomenon of dominant negative suppression observed for many of the episodic ataxia type 2 mutations in Ca(V)2.1 that predict truncated channels. The process of dominant negative suppression has been shown previously to stem from interaction between the full-length and truncated channels and to result in downstream consequences of the unfolded protein response and endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation. We have now identified the specific domain that triggers this effect. For both Ca(V)2.1 and Ca(V)2.2, the minimum construct producing suppression was the cytoplasmic N terminus. Suppression was enhanced by tethering the N terminus to the membrane with a CAAX motif. The 11-amino acid motif (including Arg(52) and Arg(54)) within the N terminus, which we have previously shown to be required for G protein modulation, is also essential for dominant negative suppression. Suppression is prevented by addition of an N-terminal tag (XFP) to the full-length and truncated constructs. We further show that suppression of Ca(V)2.2 currents by the N terminus-CAAX construct is accompanied by a reduction in Ca(V)2.2 protein level, and this is also prevented by mutation of Arg(52) and Arg(54) to Ala in the truncated construct. Taken together, our evidence indicates that both the extreme N terminus and the Arg(52), Arg(54) motif are involved in the processes underlying dominant negative suppression."

In this study, we localized the region of claudin responsible for interaction with CPE to the C-terminal part of the second extracellular loop and found that the isoelectric point of this region in sensitive claudins was higher than insensitive claudins. Amino acid substitutions to lower the pI resulted in reduced sensitivity to CPE among sensitive claudins, whereas substitutions to raise the pI endowed CPE-insensitive claudins with sensitivity. The steric structure of the claudin-binding domain of CPE reveals an acidic cleft surrounded by Tyr306, Tyr310, Tyr312, and Leu315, which were reported to be essential for interaction with the sensitive claudins.

CPE consists of a single chain polypeptide of 319 amino acids. The toxin binds to a receptor on target cells via a C-terminal receptor-binding domain and reportedly organizes large molecular complexes with cellular components to make the pores, a process that is conducted by an N-terminal cytotoxic domain (1Hanna P.C.

Unlike other pore-forming toxins such as cholesterol-dependent cytolysins, CPE shows strict specificity for sensitive cells, implying the existence of a particular but not ubiquitous receptor for the toxin on CPE-sensitive cells (7Alouf J.E.

Horiguchi Y. Matsuda M. Sugimoto N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1239-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and was later found to be a component of tight junctions and designated claudin (Cldn) (11Furuse M. Fujita K. Hiiragi T. Fujimoto K. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1539-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar). CPE kills only cells presenting Cldn on their surface. No CPE receptors other than Cldn have been identified to date. It was demonstrated that the noncytotoxic C-terminal part of CPE (C-CPE, residues 184–319 of CPE) disrupted the strand structure of the tight junction and increased paracellular permeability by sequestering Cldn (12Sonoda N. Furuse M. Sasaki H. Yonemura S. Katahira J. Horiguchi Y. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), indicating that Cldn is essential to the function and structure of the tight junction. This raises the possibility that CPE or C-CPE could provide a useful tool for targeting Cldn-presenting cells or modulating the Cldn-dependent paracellular permeability. In fact, attempts have been made to use CPE in the treatment of several forms of cancer that highly express certain types of Cldns (13Kominsky S.L. Exp. Rev. Mol.

C. perfringens enterotoxin claudin C-terminal part of CPE human hemagglutinin mouse CPE sensitivity-related region. The Cldn family comprises more than 20 closely related transmembrane proteins. Not all of the members serve as the receptor for CPE; it was reported that Cldns 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 14, but not Cldns 1, 2, 5, and 10, were sensitive to CPE (16Fujita K. Katahira J. Horiguchi Y. Sonoda N. Furuse M. Tsukita S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 258-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Cldn is a tetratransmembrane protein and has two extracellular loops. CPE is considered to recognize the second extracellular loop of the sensitive Cldns. However, little is known about how CPE distinguishes the sensitive Cldns from the closely related insensitive Cldns. Therefore, we tried to narrow down the region of Cldn essential for CPE to recognize and look for common features in the CPE-sensitive Cldns. The results presented here imply that the C-terminal 12 amino acids of the second extracellular loop partly determined the sensitivity to CPE. Notably, the electric charge of this region was likely important for interaction with the toxin. These observations may provide important information for use of the toxin for cancer therapy and drug delivery through epithelial barriers.

These cDNAs were excised by digestion with XhoI and XbaI and inserted into the corresponding site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). pcDNA3·Cldn1–4-1(C) was constructed as follows. Upstream and downstream gene fragments of Cldn1–4-1(C) were amplified by PCR with pcDNA3·huCldn1 as a template and a combination of the primers T7 and 141C-R for the upstream fragment and of SP6 and 141C-F for the downstream fragment. The two fragments were further subjected to PCR with T7 and SP6. The DNA fragment was inserted into the XhoI-XbaI site of pcDNA3 by enzymatic digestion and ligation. pcDNA3·Cldn1–4-1(D) was prepared in the same way with the primers indicated. For pcDNA3·Cldn4HA, two fragments were amplified by PCR with pcDNA3·mkCldn4 as a template and a combination of 4aHS, flanked by HpaI and SacII sites, and T7, and of S-4b, containing a SacII site and SP6. After digestion with SacII, the two fragments were ligated and then inserted into the XhoI-XbaI site of pcDNA3. These procedures result in an HpaI-SacII site in the Cldn4 gene between codons corresponding to amino acid residues 72 and 73. Separately, synthetic oligonucleotides (HA-F and HA-R) were annealed to each other. The resultant fragment encoding the HA tag (VNYPYDVPDYAENLYFQGAA) flanked by adhesive ends for HpaI and SacII was inserted into the corresponding site of the Cldn4 gene. Other pcDNA3-derived plasmids were made by a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla CA) with the templates of pcDNA3·Cldn4–1(A) for pcDNA3·Cldn4–1(B) and pcDNA3·Cldn4–1(C) and pcDNA3·Cldn1–4-1(C) for pcDNA3·Cldn1–4-1(B). The cDNA of huCldn4 was amplified by PCR and inserted into pEF6/V5-His TOPO TA (Invitrogen). The Cldn4 gene was excised by digestion with SpeI and XbaI and inserted into the corresponding site of pMEneo (18Watanabe R. Kinoshita T. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Takeda J. Inoue N. J. Biol.

The EcoRV-PmeI fragment of pEF6/V5-His TOPO TA was inserted into the EcoRV site of the pMEneo-derived vector so that the gene for the V5 tag was inserted downstream of the Cldn4 gene. The DNA obtained was named pMEneo·huCldn4. cDNAs of huCldn5 and huCldn10 were obtained from the National Institutes of Health Mammalian Gene Collection (Image ID 5242567 and 4246806 for huCldn5 and huCldn10, respectively), and cDNA of mouse (ms) Cldn7 was obtained from the RIKEN Mouse Genome Encyclopedia DNABookTM (DNA ID 0610043B04, DNAFORM). DNA fragments amplified by PCR with the huCldn5, huCldn10, and msCldn7 cDNAs, and the indicated primers were cloned into pEF6/V5-His TOPO TA. The resultant plasmids were designated pEF6·huCldn5, pEF6·huCldn10, and pEF6·msCldn7. The DNA fragments encoding these Cldns were excised from each plasmid by digestion with SpeI and EcoRV and substituted for the Cldn4 gene of pMEneo·huCldn4 in the corresponding region. pMEneo·Cldn4-5-4 was constructed as follows. Two independent PCRs were carried out with pEF6·huCldn5 as the template and 454-R2 and T7 as the primers and with the template pEF6·huCldn4 and primers 454-F2 and BGHrv. The two DNA fragments obtained were used as templates for PCR with T7 and BGHrv, and a chimeric DNA fragment for huCldn5 (amino acids 1–160) and huCldn4 (amino acids 161–209) was obtained. This fragment was used as a template for PCR with the primers 454-F1 and BGHrv, and another PCR was carried out with pEF6· huCldn4 as a template and primers 454-R1 and T7. The two DNA fragments were subsequently subjected to PCR with primers T7 and BGHrv. The DNA fragment encoding Cldn4-5-4 was inserted into the SpeI-EcoRV site of pMEneo·huCldn4 as described above. pMEneo·Cldn5-4-5, pMEneo·Cldn7-5-7, and pMEneo·Cldn5-7-5 were prepared in the same way. Other pMEneo-derived plasmids were made by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit with pMEneo·huCldn4 as the template for pMEneo·Cldn4FYAA and pMEneo·Cldn4NRDY and pMEneo·huCldn5 as the template for pMEneo·Cldn5DYNR. HEK293 cells and L929 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in air. The cell lines stably expressing Cldns or Cldn variants were established as follows; HEK293 or L929 cells cultured in 24-well plates were transfected with the aid of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with 2 μg/well of the pMEneo-derived or pcDNA3-derived plasmid, respectively. The clone resistant to 1 mg/ml of G418 was selected as an actual transfectant and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 500 μg/ml of G418. The expression of Cldns or Cldn variants by the selected clones was checked before use by Western blotting with the anti-FLAG antibody for Cldns expressed in HEK293 cells or anti-V5 antibody for Cldns expressed in L929 cells. L929 cells expressing msCldns except msCldn7 were provided by Shoichiro Tsukita (Kyoto University). The expression levels in these cells were checked by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody because these Cldns were tagged with the FLAG peptide at the C terminus. pET16bCPE or pETH10PER (10Katahira J.

The proteins were produced by cultivation of the bacteria in LB broth supplemented with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The bacterial cells were disrupted by sonication and suspended in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.3 m NaCl and 10 mm imidazole. The produced proteins were purified from the bacterial cell extract by elution with a 10–500 mm imidazole gradient in the same buffer from a His-Select nickel affinity gel (Sigma) column. A 100-μl aliquot of cell suspension at a concentration of 2.0 × 106 cells/ml was mixed with the same volume of CPE in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at an appropriate concentration in each well of 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plates. After incubation of the mixture at 37 °C for 2 h, 4 μl of tetrazolium salt solution (WST-8; Kishida Chemical, Osaka Japan) was added as an indicator of viability, and the mixture was incubated for another 1 h. The absorbance of the mixture in the well was measured at a wavelength of 450 nm for the indicator color and 620 nm for background. The net value was obtained by subtraction of the latter value from the former. The survival rate of cells was calculated according to the following equation, where ACPE is the net absorbance of the CPE-treated sample, ANO is the net absorbance of the untreated sample, and ABLANK is the net absorbance of a well without cells. The survival rate can be calculated as follows, ACPE − ABLANK/ANO − ABLANK. The EC50 value was computed with Prism 4 (GraphPad Software). The radioiodination of CPE or C-CPE and binding assay for Cldn-expressing cells (105 cells/assay) were performed as described previously (10Katahira J. Inoue N. Horiguchi Y. Matsuda M. Sugimoto N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1239-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The specific radioactivity of 125I-labeled CPE ranged from 42 to 144 MBq/mg protein. The amount of proteins described here were determined with a micro BCA protein assay reagent kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or by the method of Bradford with protein assay CBB solution (Nacalai, Japan). For Western blotting, the samples were electrically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) following SDS-PAGE. The membranes were then treated with 5% skim milk, and the transferred proteins were probed with appropriate antibodies and visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL plus; GE Healthcare). The pI values of peptides were calculated with the PEPSTATS program of the EMBOSS software package (19Rice P. Longden I. Bleasby A. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 276-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6538) Google Scholar). The image of C-CPE was drawn from the structural data (Protein Data Bank code 2QUO) with PyMOL. The surface charge of C-CPE was evaluated by Adaptive Poisson-Boltxmann Solver. A previous report revealed that CPE recognizes the second loop of the sensitive Cldns by swapping extracellular loops between the CPE-sensitive Cldn3 and the CPE-insensitive Cldn1 (16Fujita K. Katahira J. Horiguchi Y. Sonoda N. Furuse M. Tsukita S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 258-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The chimeric Cldn possessing the second extracellular loop of the CPE-sensitive Cldn3 but not the CPE-insensitive Cldn1 was sensitive to CPE. Other groups also concluded that CPE recognizes the second loop of Cldns (20Winkler L. Gehring C. Wenzel A. Müller S.L. Piehl C. Krause G. Blasig I.E. Piontek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18863-18872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 21Ling J. Liao H. Clark R. Wong M.S. Lo D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30585-30595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It remains unclear whether the first extracellular loop of Cldn is involved in interaction with CPE in situ. Therefore, as a first step, we constructed a recombinant Cldn4 (Cldn4HA), which has an HA tag in the first extracellular loop (supplemental Fig. S1A). In this system, anti-HA antibody could be used as a specific ligand for the first loop of Cldn4HA. We established HEK293 cells stably expressing Cldn4HA and examined them for binding of anti-HA antibody and C-CPE, which carries the receptor-binding domain but not the cytotoxic domain. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated a positive correlation indicating that biotinylated C-CPE and anti-HA antibody independently bound to Cldn4HA (supplemental Fig. S1B). The binding of the biotinylated C-CPE was inhibited by unlabeled C-CPE but not by anti-HA antibody (supplemental Fig. S1, C and D). These results imply that the first loop of claudin may not be involved in the interaction of CPE with Cldns, confirming previous observations. Because we could not find any evidence of the involvement of the first loop in the recognition of CPE, we then focused on the second loop. We prepared CPE-insensitive HEK293 cells expressing Cldns, which have various forms of the chimeric second loop (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S2) and examined them for CPE sensitivity. It was confirmed by Western blotting of the cell fractions that the Cldns were presented on the cell membrane (supplemental Fig. S2). In the course of these experiments, we found that Cldn1, which had been considered to be a typical CPE-insensitive Cldn, actually responded to the toxin at higher concentrations. Therefore, we calculated the EC50 values of the cells expressing the chimeric Cldns against CPE from the results of the cytotoxicity assay and compared their sensitivities. As a result, the Cldns were grouped into a highly sensitive class (EC50 < 1 μg/ml), a slightly sensitive class (1 ≤ EC50 < 30 μg/ml), and an insensitive class (EC50 ≥ 30 μg/ml). According to these criteria, Cldn1 was classified as low sensitive, not insensitive. Among the chimeric Cldns, Cldn4–1(B) was highly sensitive to CPE, whereas Cldn4–1(A) was insensitive. Cldn1–4-1(B) was also highly sensitive, whereas Cldn1–4-1(C) and (D) were as slightly sensitive as Cldn1. These results imply that the region from Asn149 to Met160 of Cldn4 determines sensitivity to CPE. We named this region the CPE sensitivity-related region (CPE-SR). The reason why Cldn4–1(A), although expressed enough on the cell membrane (supplemental Fig. S2), became insensitive to CPE was unknown. This chimeric mutation may influence the structure around the second loop and downstream transmembrane region. Next, we tested whether the CPE-SR of Cldn4 changes another CPE-insensitive Cldn, Cldn5 (Fig. 1) (9Horiguchi Y. Uemura T. Kozaki S. Sakaguchi G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1985; 28: 131-135Crossref Google Scholar, 10Katahira J. Inoue N. Horiguchi Y. Matsuda M. Sugimoto N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1239-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). We used L929 cells instead of HEK293 cells for the following experiments, because in the first experiments, HEK293 cells were found to occasionally gain sensitivity to CPE after serial passages for long periods. We established L929 cells stably expressing Cldn5-4-5, a chimera in which the CPE-SR of Cldn4 was inserted into Cldn5 in place of the corresponding region, and examined them for CPE sensitivity. The cells expressing Cldn5-4-5 were found to be as sensitive to CPE as the cells expressing Cldn4 (Fig. 1). In contrast, when the CPE-SR of Cldn4 was replaced with the corresponding region of Cldn5, Cldn4 became insensitive to CPE (Fig. 1, Cldn4-5-4). This was also the case with Cldn5 and CPE-sensitive Cldn7. The CPE-SR of Cldn7 made Cldn5 sensitive (Fig. 1, Cldn5-7-5), whereas replacing the CPE-SR of Cldn7 with Cldn5 resulted in insensitivity to CPE (Fig. 1, Cldn7-5-7). According to the calculated EC50 values, Cldn5-4-5 and Cldn5-7-5 could be classified as highly sensitive (Table 2). 125I-Labeled CPE bound to the cells expressing Cldn4 or Cldn5-4-5 but not to the cells expressing Cldn5 or Cldn4-5-4 (Fig. 2). These results indicate that the sensitivity to CPE of the cells expressing various Cldns reflected the binding of CPE to Cldns. The Kd values of Cldn4 and Cldn5-4-5 for CPE were 4.42 × 10−9 and 1.91 × 10−8 m, respectively. These values are consistent with those estimated for the CPE-sensitive Cldns (9Horiguchi Y. Uemura T.

This is probably due to the former expressing more Cldn than the latter, as shown in Fig. 1B, the results of which were obtained with the same clones of Cldn-expressing cells.TABLE 1Cldns with the chimeric second loopClaudinAmino acid sequenceEC50SensitivityWild type huCldn1139WYGNRIVQEFYDPMTPVNARYEFGQALFTGW1694.32 ± 2.94Low mkCldn4138WTAHNIIQDFYNPLVASGQKREMGASLYVGW1680.18 ± 0.09HighChimera Cldn4-1(A)WTAHNIIQDFYNPLVASGQKREFGQALFTGW>30Insensitive Cldn4-1(B)WTAHNIIQDFYNPLVASGQKREMGQALFTGW0.50 ± 0.28High Cldn4-1(C)WTAHNIIQDFYNPLVASGQKREMGAALFTGW0.11 ± 0.01High Cldn1-4-1(A)WYGNRIVQEFYNPLVASGQKREMGASLYVGW0.65 ± 0.23High Cldn1-4-1(B)WYGNRIVQEFYNPLVASGQKREMGAALFTGW0.46 ± 0.29High Cldn1-4-1(C)WYGNRIVQEFYDPLVASGQKREMGAALFTGW3.42 ± 0.93Low Cldn1-4-1(D)WYGNRIVQEFYDPMVASGQKREMGAALFTGW2.08 ± 0.39Low Open table in a new tab TABLE 2CPE sensitivity of cells expressing various CldnsClaudinAmino acid sequencepIEC50**Highly sensitive msCldn4NVIRDFYNPMVASGQKREMGAS9.700.21 huCldn4NIIQDFYNPLVASGQKREMGAS9.700.083 mkCldn4NIIQDFYNPLVASGQKREMGAS9.700.18 msCldn3TIIRDFYNPLVPEAQKREMGAG6.530.20 msCldn7QIVTDFYNPLTPMNVKYEFGPA6.400.29 msCldn8SIIRDFYNPLVDVALKRELGEA6.490.69Slightly sensitive msCldn14DVVQNFYNPLLPSGMKFEIGQA6.414.7 msCldn2GILRDFYSPLVPDSMKFEIGEA4.184.4 msCldn1GIVQEFYDPLTPINARYEFGQA4.1812 huCldn1RIVQEFYDPMTPVNARYEFGQA4.184.3Insensitive msCldn5IVVREFYDPTVPVSQKYELGAA4.18>30 huCldn5IVVREFYDPSVPVSQKYELGAA4.18>30 huCldn10KITTEFFDP-LFVEQKYELGAA3.93>30Cldn mutants examined in this study huCldn4-5-4NVIRDFYDPSVPVSQKYELGAS4.18>30 huCldn5-4-5IVVREFYNPLVASGQKREMGAA9.700.40 mhCldn7-5-7QIVTDFYDPSVPVSQKYELGPA4.18>30 mhCldn5-7-5IVVREFYNPLTPMNVKYEFGAA6.400.13 huCldn5DYNRIVVREFYNPSVPVSQKRELGAA9.701.4 huCldn4NRDYNIIQDFYDPLVASGQKYEMGAS4.1814 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2Effects of CPE-SR on binding of 125I-CPE to L929 cells expressing Cldns.

To understand what element of the CPE-SR is recognized by CPE, we examined two possibilities: Cldns may have an intrinsic ability to bind to CPE, which the CPE-SR of the insensitive Cldns negates, or the CPE-SR of sensitive Cldns may have a common feature with which to interact with the toxin. Concerning the first possibility, we focused on a previous report suggesting that two consensus aromatic amino acids located in the second loop of Cldns directly interact with aromatic amino acids in the receptor-binding region of CPE (21Ling J. Liao H. Clark R. Wong M.S. Lo D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30585-30595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These aromatic amino acids, FY or FF, are located immediately upstream of the CPE-SRs of Cldns (Table 2) and are suggested to be involved in the transinteraction of Cldns between opposing cells to form tight junction strands (23Piontek J. Winkler L. Wolburg H. Müller S.L. Zuleger N. Piehl C. Wiesner B. Krause G. Blasig I.E. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 146-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), indicating that they are exposed outside the Cldn molecule. If this is the case, it is possible that FY or FF, which are common in members of the Cldn family, provide a contact site on Cldn for CPE, and the CPE-SR of CPE-insensitive Cldns might interfere with their interaction through the aromatic residues. To address this issue, we examined whether the FY residues of Cldn are actually involved in interaction with CPE. We established L929 cells expressing Cldn4FYAA, in which the consensus residues (Phe147 and Tyr148) were replaced with Ala and examined them for CPE sensitivity (Fig. 3). The cells with Cldn4FYAA were found to be as sensitive as those expressing Cldn4. In addition, the toxin bound to Cldn4FYAA-expressing cells as well as Cldn4-expressing cells. These results exclude the first possibility. We next examined the alternative possibility that the CPE-SRs of the sensitive Cldns have a common feature with which to interact with CPE and tried to find in the CPE-SRs a consensus sequence or motif that likely determines CPE sensitivity. For this purpose, we first carried out cytotoxic assays with cells expressing various Cldns and classified them as highly sensitive, slightly sensitive, and insensitive and then compared the sequences of the CPE-SRs (Table 2). These results showed that all of the Cldns kept in the laboratory could be classified into three classes on the basis of sensitivity to CPE as described above, and no consensus sequences or motifs were evident in the CPE-SRs of each class. Instead, we found that CPE-SRs of highly sensitive Cldns had relatively high pI values, whereas those of slightly sensitive or insensitive Cldns showed lower pI values (Table 2). The difference in pI values of CPE-SR is derived from different amino acids at the first and tenth positions in CPE-SR, e.g. Asn and Arg for Cldn4 versus Asp and Tyr for Cldn5 (Table 2). To examine the relationship between pI values of CPE-SR and sensitivity, we constructed genes for Cldn4 and Cldn5 derivatives, whose first and tenth amino acids in the CPE-SR were exchanged so that the Cldn4 derivative, Cldn4NRDY, has a CPE-SR with a pI value equivalent to that of Cldn5, and the Cldn5 derivative, Cldn5DYNR, has a CPE-SR with a pI equivalent to Cldn4 (Table 2). These Cldns were expressed in L929 cells, and their sensitivity to CPE was examined (Fig. 4). As expected, the mutation to raise the pI value of CPE-SR made Cldn5 sensitive, whereas that to lower the pI value made Cldn4 ∼100 times less sensitive (Fig. 4). Cldn5DYNR was 10 times more sensitive than Cldn4NRDY, although they were both classified into the slightly sensitive group according to our criteria (Table 2). The binding assay also revealed that Cldn5DYNR but not Cldn5 served as a CPE receptor, and Cldn4NRDY reduced the ability to bind to the toxin, at least to levels below the limit of detection for the binding assay. Additionally, we carried out binding assays with Cldn4-expressing cells and C-CPE in the presence of various concentrations of NaCl to examine the effect of ionic strength on the Cldn-CPE interaction. Increasing the concentration of NaCl from 0.14 to 1.0 m in the reaction environment reduced the amount of C-CPE bound to the cells by ∼40% (data not shown). In this study, we tried to understand the mechanism by which CPE identifies sensitive Cldns, which make up a large family of more than 20 members. For this purpose, we established cultured cells stably expressing a variety of Cldns including chimeric or amino acid-substituted mutants. Western blotting revealed that the expression levels of Cldns varied among the established cell lines. However, we found that they had little influence on the sensitivity to CPE, probably because the sensitivity of detection in Western blotting is much lower than that of the cytotoxicity assay. Occasionally, the sensitive Cldns in HEK293 or L929 cells induced sensitivity to the toxin, even if they were barely detected by Western blotting (see supplemental Fig. S3 as a typical example). We established several lines for each Cldn and chose one that expressed enough Cldn to be detected by Western blotting. Thus, we consider that the differences in sensitivity to CPE are hardly attributable to those in the expression level of Cldns in the experiments presented here. The results of the cytotoxicity assay classified Cldns into three groups according to the sensitivity to CPE: highly sensitive (EC50 < 1 μg/ml), slightly sensitive (1 ≤ EC50 < 30 μg/ml), and insensitive (EC50 ≥ 30 μg/ml). The cytotoxicity assay with the chimera of Cldn1 and Cldn4 revealed that the CPE-SR (Asn149–Met160 for Cldn4) determines the sensitivity of Cldns to the toxin. Furthermore, the pI values of the CPE-SR were apparently related to the sensitivity, with the more sensitive Cldns having higher pI values. Cldn5, which is insensitive to the toxin, became sensitive with amino acid substitutions to raise the pI value of the CPE-SR. In contrast, Cldn4, a typical receptor for CPE, became less sensitive with substitutions to lower the pI value of the CPE-SR. The binding of 125I-labeled CPE to the cells exhibited a close relationship to the sensitivity of the expressed Cldns, indicating that the toxin actually binds to sensitive but not insensitive Cldns. Analyses characterizing the receptor-binding domain of CPE have revealed that the 16–17 amino acids at the C-terminal end are important for binding to Cldn4 (15Kondoh M. Masuyama A. Takahashi A.

Notably, Tyr306, Tyr310, Tyr312, and Leu315 in this region were shown to be involved in interaction with Cldn4 (25Takahashi A. Komiya E. Kakutani H. Yoshida T. Fujii M. Horiguchi Y. Mizuguchi H.

The steric structure of the C-terminal portion (residues 194–319) of CPE demonstrates that Tyr306, Tyr310, and Tyr312 reside on a large loop bulging out of the molecule (28Van Itallie C.M. Betts L. Smedley 3rd, J.G. McClane B.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 268-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Additionally, the surface charge model reveals that these Tyr residues together with Leu315 form a cleft space, the bottom of which is negatively charged compared with the surrounding area (Fig. 5). Therefore, we consider the electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged cleft of CPE and the positively charged CPE-SR of the sensitive Cldns to partially play a role in the mutual interaction. Cldns are major components of the tight junction, which organizes paracellular barriers to delimitate functional compartments of each tissue of the animal body. Specific Cldns are known to be overexpressed in various cancer cells (13Kominsky S.L. Exp. Rev. Mol. Med. 2006; 8: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 14Morin P.J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9603-9606Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). CPE kills eukaryotic cells, and C-CPE opens the paracellular barrier by binding to sensitive Cldns. Therefore, they are considered probable candidates for a modulator of the paracellular barrier for drug delivery or for a Cldn-targeting agent for cancer therapy (13Kominsky S.L. Exp. Rev. Mol. Med. 2006; 8: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 14Morin P.J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9603-9606Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 15Kondoh M. Masuyama A. Takahashi A. Asano N.

In addition, some research groups have tried to understand the interaction between Cldns and CPE at the molecular level to ultimately modulate the selectivity or specificity of CPE against Cldns, which may make the toxin more useful. Fujita et al. (16Fujita K. Katahira J. Horiguchi Y. Sonoda N. Furuse M. Tsukita S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 258-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) presented the first evidence that the second extracellular loop is responsible for binding to CPE, showing an in vitro interaction between the second loop of Cldn3 and CPE or C-CPE. However, the binding of C-CPE to peptide fragments comprising the second extracellular loop of Cldns could not be reproduced (21Ling J. Liao H. Clark R. Wong M.S. Lo D.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2008; 283: 30585-30595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) succeeded in demonstrating the in vitro interaction using fragments consisting of the second loop and the subsequent transmembrane domain. These results imply that the steric structure of the second loop organized with the transmembrane domain is necessary for interaction with CPE or C-CPE. In this context, we tried to understand the interaction between Cldns and CPE by using the full-length toxin and mammalian cells expressing full-length Cldns, so as to examine the events that may occur in situ. Recently, another group identified a motif, NPL(V/L)(P/A), as an essential sequence of the second extracellular loop of Cldns for interaction with CPE (20Winkler L. Gehring C. Wenzel A. Müller S.L. Piehl C. Krause G. Blasig I.E. Piontek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18863-18872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This motif in Cldn3 corresponds to the N-terminal half of the CPE-SR. However, we observed that Cldns that do not possess the motif were sensitive to CPE (e.g. DPLTP for msCldn1, DPMTP for huCldn1, and SPLVP for msCldn2). Their conclusions were based on results obtained using an array with synthetic peptides corresponding to the second extracellular loop, which seem to be unreliable because the typical receptor Cldn4 was judged to be negative for binding to GST-CPE116–319. In addition, there were some contradictory results in that paper; Cldn5 was considered sensitive to CPE with low affinity, whereas in our experience, Cldn5 is definitely insensitive to CPE, and huCldn5 and msCldn5 did not confer CPE sensitivity to L929 cells. The binding of 125I-labeled CPE to the cells expressing huCldn5 was not detected. A further understanding of interactions between CPE and Cldns at a molecular level may be required to explain these discrepancies. In this study, we conclude that electrostatic characteristics are important for Cldn and CPE to interact. This may provide information helpful to the use of CPE or C-CPE in a drug delivery system or cancer therapy. It remains to be elucidated how the electrostatic characteristics are involved in the interaction between Cldns and CPE. Although Cldn1, Cldn2, and Cldn5 possess CPE-SRs with pI values of 4.18 (Table 2), the former two are sensitive, whereas the latter is insensitive to CPE. Cldn4NRDY, also with a pI of 4.18 in the CPE-SR, still responded to the toxin. These results suggest that other factors are involved in the interaction between Cldn and CPE. To confirm or extend our conclusions, we are now attempting to determine the steric structure of a CPE-Cldn complex. We greatly appreciate the gifts of cDNAs for huCldn1, huCdn4, mkCldn4, Cldn4–1(A), and Cldn1–4-1(A) from Dr. Jun Katahira (Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences, Osaka University) and L929 cells expressing msCldns from Dr. Shoichiro Tsukita (Kyoto University).

https://openalex.org/W2062736632,"In animals, thiamine deficiency leads to specific brain lesions, generally attributed to decreased levels of thiamine diphosphate, an essential cofactor in brain energy metabolism. However, another far less abundant derivative, thiamine triphosphate (ThTP), may also have a neuronal function. Here, we show that in the rat brain, ThTP is essentially present and synthesized in mitochondria. In mitochondrial preparations from brain (but not liver), ThTP can be produced from thiamine diphosphate and Pi. This endergonic process is coupled to the oxidation of succinate or NADH through the respiratory chain but cannot be energized by ATP hydrolysis. ThTP synthesis is strongly inhibited by respiratory chain inhibitors, such as myxothiazol and inhibitors of the H+ channel of F0F1-ATPase. It is also impaired by disruption of the mitochondria or by depolarization of the inner membrane (by protonophores or valinomycin), indicating that a proton-motive force (Δp) is required. Collapsing Δp after ThTP synthesis causes its rapid disappearance, suggesting that both synthesis and hydrolysis are catalyzed by a reversible H+-translocating ThTP synthase. The synthesized ThTP can be released from mitochondria in the presence of external Pi. However, ThTP probably does not accumulate in the cytoplasm in vivo, because it is not detected in the cytosolic fraction obtained from a brain homogenate. Our results show for the first time that a high energy triphosphate compound other than ATP can be produced by a chemiosmotic type of mechanism. This might shed a new light on our understanding of the mechanisms of thiamine deficiency-induced brain lesions.

It is also impaired by disruption of the mitochondria or by depolarization of the inner membrane (by protonophores or valinomycin), indicating that a proton-motive force (Δp) is required. Collapsing Δp after ThTP synthesis causes its rapid disappearance, suggesting that both synthesis and hydrolysis are catalyzed by a reversible H+-translocating ThTP synthase. The synthesized ThTP can be released from mitochondria in the presence of external Pi. However, ThTP probably does not accumulate in the cytoplasm in vivo, because it is not detected in the cytosolic fraction obtained from a brain homogenate. Our results show for the first time that a high energy triphosphate compound other than ATP can be produced by a chemiosmotic type of mechanism. This might shed a new light on our understanding of the mechanisms of thiamine deficiency-induced brain lesions. Thiamine (vitamin B1) is essential for brain function, and its deficiency causes specific brain lesions (1Desjardins P. Butterworth R.F. Mol. Neurobiol. 2005; 31: 17-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hazell A.S. Butterworth R.F. Alcohol. Alcohol. 2009; 44: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It is thought that this selective vulnerability results from decreased levels of thiamine diphosphate (ThDP), 3The abbreviations used are: ThDPthiamine diphosphateAKadenylate kinaseAThDPadenosine thiamine diphosphateAThTPadenosine thiamine triphosphateCCCPcarbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazoneDCCDN,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimideDTMFdigitonin-treated mitochondrial fractionRCRrespiratory control ratioThTPthiamine triphosphateThTPasethiamine triphosphataseURCuncoupled respiratory controlBistris propane1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propaneHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. an indispensable cofactor for several key enzymes in cell energy metabolism (especially pyruvate and oxoglutarate dehydrogenases and transketolase). thiamine diphosphate adenylate kinase adenosine thiamine diphosphate adenosine thiamine triphosphate carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide digitonin-treated mitochondrial fraction respiratory control ratio thiamine triphosphate thiamine triphosphatase uncoupled respiratory control 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane high pressure liquid chromatography. In the brain, as in most other mammalian tissues, ThDP is the most abundant thiamine derivative, amounting to 80–90% of total thiamine, but several other thiamine derivatives, such as ThTP, might play physiological roles (3Bettendorff L. Metab. Brain Dis. 1994; 9: 183-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 4Bettendorff L. Wins P. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 2917-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Recently, we discovered the first thiamine adenine nucleotide, adenosine thiamine triphosphate (AThTP), that is accumulated in Escherichia coli during carbon starvation (5Bettendorff L. Wirtzfeld B. Makarchikov A.F. Mazzucchelli G. Frédérich M. Gigliobianco T. Gangolf M. De Pauw E. Angenot L. Wins P. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 211-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). AThTP is also present in mammalian tissues. Furthermore, another adenine thiamine nucleotide, adenosine thiamine diphosphate (AThDP), seems to exist, at least in the liver (6Frédérich M. Delvaux D. Gigliobianco T. Gangolf M. Dive G. Mazzucchelli G. Elias B. De Pauw E. Angenot L. Wins P. Bettendorff L. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 3256-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although ThTP is found in most organisms, from bacteria to mammals, it exists only in small amounts (0.1–1% of total thiamine) in animal tissues (7Makarchikov A.F. Lakaye B. Gulyai I.E. Czerniecki J. Coumans B. Wins P. Grisar T. Bettendorff L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1477-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), but much higher amounts of ThTP are found in E. coli during amino acid starvation (8Lakaye B. Wirtzfeld B. Wins P. Grisar T. Bettendorff L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17142-17147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic organisms, the physiological role(s) of ThTP remain unknown. In view of the particular sensitivity of the nervous system to thiamine deprivation, some authors considered over 30 years ago that nerve cells might contain a specific “neuroactive” form of thiamine, different from ThDP, and that it might be ThTP (9Cooper J.R. Itokawa Y. Pincus J.H. Science. 1969; 164: 74-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 10Itokawa Y. Cooper J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 196: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 11Eliasson S.G. Scarpellini J.D. Neurochem. Res. 1976; 1: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 12Eder L. Dunant Y. J. Neurochem. 1980; 35: 1278-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). There was, however, no firm experimental basis for this hypothesis. Indeed, the amounts of ThTP present in nerve and other tissue could be accurately and reliably determined only after the development of HPLC methods in the early 1980s (4Bettendorff L. Wins P. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 2917-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 6Frédérich M. Delvaux D. Gigliobianco T. Gangolf M. Dive G. Mazzucchelli G. Elias B. De Pauw E. Angenot L. Wins P. Bettendorff L. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 3256-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Actually, the compound(s) identified as ThTP in earlier studies may not have been authentic ThTP, and the existence of a “neuroactive” form of thiamine other than ThDP has remained doubtful. More recently, it was shown that ThTP activates high conductance anion channels in excised patches of neuroblastoma cells, possibly via a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism (13Bettendorff L. Kolb H.A. Schoffeniels E. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 136: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Later, it was shown that ThTP may indeed phosphorylate proteins (14Nghiêm H.O. Bettendorff L. Changeux J.P. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although there is presently no proof that these effects are of physiological significance, it is possible that ThTP may be part of a signaling cascade involved in some kind of cellular regulation. ThTP can be hydrolyzed by thiamine triphosphatases (ThTPases). Membrane-bound ThTPases are present in many animal tissues, including rat brain (15Barchi R.L. Braun P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7668-7673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bettendorff L. Grandfils C. Wins P. Schoffeniels E. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 738-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), but so far, those enzymes could be neither purified nor characterized at the molecular level. However, a soluble 25-kDa cytosolic ThTPase has been purified from bovine brain (17Makarchikov A.F. Chernikevich I.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1117: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and characterized at the molecular level (18Lakaye B. Makarchikov A.F. Antunes A.F. Zorzi W. Coumans B. De Pauw E. Wins P. Grisar T. Bettendorff L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13771-13777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This enzyme exhibits nearly absolute specificity for ThTP and a high catalytic efficiency. Although ThTP hydrolysis has been rather well studied, the mechanism of its synthesis remains unclear. Eckert and Möbus (19Eckert T. Möbus W. Hoppe Seylers Z. Physiol. Chem. 1964; 338: 286-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) originally proposed that ThTP synthesis is catalyzed by a ThDP kinase (ThDP:ATP phosphoryltransferase), according to the reaction, ThDP + ATP ⇆ ThTP + ADP. In 1984, Chernikevich et al. (20Chernikevich I.P. Luchko V. Voskoboev A.I. Ostrovsky Y.M. Biokhimiya. 1984; 49: 899-907Google Scholar) reported the purification of a ThDP kinase from brewers' yeast, but the specific activity of the enzyme was very low (kcat on the order of 1 min−1). Moreover, the authenticity of ThTP was not checked in these studies. It is possible that the reaction product was AThTP or AThDP rather than ThTP. Indeed, AThTP may be synthesized in vitro by a soluble high molecular mass enzyme complex according to the reaction ThDP + ATP (ADP) ⇆ AThTP + PPi (Pi) (21Makarchikov A.F. Brans A. Bettendorff L. BMC Biochem. 2007; 8: 17Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Nishino et al. (22Nishino K. Itokawa Y. Nishino N. Piros K. Cooper J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11871-11878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported the purification of a ThDP kinase from a crude bovine brain mitochondrial fraction, but in this case, the substrate was protein-bound rather than free ThDP. Again, the purified preparation had a very low specific activity, and these results could not be reproduced elsewhere (23Voskoboev A.I. Chernikevich I.P. Biokhimiya. 1985; 50: 1421-1427PubMed Google Scholar). At the end of the 1980s, Kawasaki and co-workers (24Shikata H. Koyama S. Egi Y. Yamada K. Kawasaki T. Biochem. Int. 1989; 18: 933-941PubMed Google Scholar, 25Miyoshi K. Egi Y. Shioda T. Kawasaki T. J. Biochem. 1990; 108: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 26Shioda T. Egi Y. Yamada K. Kawasaki T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1115: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) demonstrated that adenylate kinase (AK; EC 2.7.4.3) 1 (AK1; a cytosolic form found mainly in skeletal muscle) was able to synthesize ThTP according to the reaction ThDP + ADP ⇆ ThTP + AMP. They suggested that this reaction, although very slow (kcat ∼ 0.5 min−1 at physiological pH) (25Miyoshi K. Egi Y. Shioda T. Kawasaki T. J. Biochem. 1990; 108: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) was of physiological significance. However, the observation that transgenic mice deficient in AK1 have normal ThTP levels was not in agreement with this conclusion (27Makarchikov A.F. Wins P. Janssen E. Wieringa B. Grisar T. Bettendorff L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we recently showed that when an E. coli strain with a thermo-sensitive AK was grown in minimal medium supplemented with glucose, the ThTP level strongly increased, although the AK activity was completely inactivated (28Gigliobianco T. Lakaye B. Makarchikov A.F. Wins P. Bettendorff L. BMC Microbiol. 2008; 8: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). All AKs that we tested had the property of synthesizing ThTP at a very slow rate, but this reaction did not appear to be the main mechanism for ThTP synthesis. Except for AK, we have been unable to measure any ThTP-synthesizing activity involving a soluble enzyme, but we have previously shown that when rat brain homogenates were incubated with ThDP, a significant amount of ThTP was detected in the particulate fraction containing cell debris, synaptosomes, and mitochondria (29Bettendorff L. Peeters M. Wins P. Schoffeniels E. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 30Bettendorff L. Hennuy B. Wins P. Schoffeniels E. Neuroscience. 1993; 52: 1009-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). At that time, we thought that ThTP synthesis took place inside the synaptosomal compartment, but this poses the problem of the transport of ThDP into these structures. Indeed, there is no known ThDP transporter in plasma membranes, but the internal mitochondrial membrane does contain a ThDP transporter (31Marobbio C.M. Vozza A. Harding M. Bisaccia F. Palmieri F. Walker J.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5653-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 32Lindhurst M.J. Fiermonte G. Song S. Struys E. De Leonardis F. Schwartzberg P.L. Chen A. Castegna A. Verhoeven N. Mathews C.K. Palmieri F. Biesecker L.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 15927-15932Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It was therefore possible that the synthesis observed took place inside the free mitochondria rather than in the synaptosomes. The present study demonstrates that ThTP synthesis indeed occurs in the mitochondrial matrix with ThDP as precursor, but we find, unexpectedly, that the phosphate donor is not ATP or ADP but Pi. We further demonstrate that the free energy required for driving the reaction ThDP + Pi ⇆ ThTP + H2O is provided by electron transfer through the respiratory chain and the resulting proton-motive force. Thus, ThTP synthesis in brain mitochondria appears to be carried out through an utterly new type of mechanism reminiscent of ATP synthesis, which ceases to be operative when the organelle is disrupted. DMSO and tetrahydrofuran (HPLC grade) were from Biosolve B.V. Percoll, mannitol, sucrose, EDTA, EGTA, bovine serum albumin (essentially fatty acid-free), sodium pyruvate, succinic acid, l-malic acid, Triton X-100, antimycin A, stigmatellin, myxothiazol, oligomycin, N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), 2,4-dinitrophenol, digitonin, ATP, ADP, and ThDP were from Sigma. Valinomycin was from Fluka (Sigma). Protease inhibitor mixture was from Roche Applied Science. All solutions were prepared with Milli-Q water. Radiolabeled phosphoric acid (H332PO4, 314–337 TBq/mmol, 370 MBq/ml) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. ThTP was prepared as previously described (33Bettendorff L. Nghiêm H.O. Wins P. Lakaye B. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 322: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All animal experiments were made following the directives of the committee for animal care and use of the University of Liège, in accordance with the European Communities Council Directive of 24 November 1986 (86/609/EEC). Rat brain mitochondria were prepared by a modification of the method described by Rosenthal et al. (34Rosenthal R.E. Hamud F. Fiskum G. Varghese P.J. Sharpe S. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1987; 7: 752-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Male Wistar rats (200 g) were killed by decapitation. The brain was rapidly removed, minced, and homogenized on ice with a motor-driven glass-Teflon Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer in 10 ml of homogenizing medium A (225 mm mannitol, 75 mm sucrose, 7.5 mm Hepes, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free), pH adjusted to 7.3 with KOH) in the presence of protease inhibitor mixture and filtered on a double layer of gauze. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min in a Beckman Avanti 30 centrifuge fixed angle rotor. The supernatant was carefully decanted, and the pellet (P1; Table 1) was precipitated with 2 ml of trichloroacetic acid 12%).TABLE 1Distribution of ThTP in subcellular fractions from rat brainThTP contentFumaraseLDHThTP synthesispmol mg−1nmol mg−1 min−1nmol mg−1 min−1pmol mg−1 10 min−1Homogenate0.59 ± 0.24P10.99 ± 0.36Myelin0.40 ± 0.08Synaptosomes0.70 ± 0.210.38 ± 0.061.4 ± 0.24.6 ± 0.7Mitochondria3.5 ± 0.6ap < 0.01, analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's test for comparison with the synaptosomes.1.04 ± 0.07bp < 0.05.0.19 ± 0.01ap < 0.01, analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's test for comparison with the synaptosomes.60 ± 4cp < 0.001.a p < 0.01, analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's test for comparison with the synaptosomes.b p < 0.05.c p < 0.001. Open table in a new tab The supernatant was centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet, containing free mitochondria and synaptosomes, was resuspended in 10 volumes of medium A containing digitonin 0.015% to disrupt synaptosomal plasma membranes and release the mitochondria trapped within (34Rosenthal R.E. Hamud F. Fiskum G. Varghese P.J. Sharpe S. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1987; 7: 752-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). After 30 s at 4 °C, the suspension was centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 10 min, the pellet was resuspended in medium B (225 mm mannitol, 75 mm sucrose, 7.5 mm Hepes, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH). The suspension, called digitonin-treated fraction (DTMF), was split in several aliquots that were kept on ice until use, generally within 1 h. The protocol for the isolation of rat liver mitochondria was a modification of previously published methods (35Reinhart P.H. Taylor W.M. Bygrave F.L. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 731-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 36Chalmers S. Nicholls D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19062-19070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar); the liver was removed, minced, and homogenized on ice in 40 ml of solution 1 (220 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mm Hepes, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free), pH adjusted to pH 7.4 with KOH). After homogenization, a centrifugation (600 × g, 10 min) was performed, the supernatant was decanted, and the previous step was repeated in half of the original volume. The supernatants were pooled and centrifuged at 7000 × g for 10 min. The resulting pellet contained the mitochondria, which were resupended in 40 ml of solution 2 (220 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mm Hepes, and 0.1 mm EGTA, pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH) and centrifuged (7000 × g, 10 min). The final pellet was kept on ice and used within 1 h. Mouse and quail brain mitochondrial fractions were prepared as described for the rat brain. Cytosolic fractions of various rat tissues and quail brain were prepared after homogenization in medium A using a glass- Teflon Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer and centrifugation (100,000 × g, 1 h). Proteins were precipitated by the addition of 40 μl of trichloroacetic acid (72%) to 200 μl of supernatant (cytosolic fraction) and 2 ml of trichloroacetic acid (12%) to the pellet. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Peterson (37Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7134) Google Scholar). The protocol was adapted from previously published methods (38Dunkley P.R. Heath J.W. Harrison S.M. Jarvie P.E. Glenfield P.J. Rostas J.A. Brain Res. 1988; 441: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 39Sims N.R. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 698-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The rat brains were homogenized as described above. After centrifugation (1000 × g, 10 min), the supernatant was carefully decanted, and the pellet was resuspended in half of the original volume. The previous step was repeated, and the supernatants were pooled (S1). The discontinuous density gradient was prepared in 15 × 97-mm centrifuge tubes by layering 4 ml of S1 on three preformed layers consisting of 3 ml of 10% Percoll, 3 ml of 20% Percoll, and 3 ml of 40% Percoll. The gradients were centrifuged for 13 min at 30,000 × g in a Beckman Avanti 30 centrifuge fixed angle rotor. The synaptosomal fraction was near the interface between the 20 and 10% Percoll layers, whereas the fraction at the interface between the 40 and 20% Percoll layers corresponded to free mitochondria. The myelin fraction was in the 10% layer. The fractions were collected using a Pasteur pipette and diluted with medium B. The suspensions were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The pellets were washed once again to eliminate the residual Percoll and resuspended in a medium suitable for assay of ThTP synthesis (see below) in Eppendorf tubes on ice. Cross-contamination between synaptosomal and mitochondrial fractions was tested by the enzyme markers fumarase (40Hill R.L. Bradshaw R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 91-99Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and lactate dehydrogenase (41Bergmeyer H.U. Bernt E. Bergmeyer H.U. Methoden der Enzymatischen Analyse. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim1974: 607-612Google Scholar). Different fractions were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate (Sorensen) buffer (pH 7.4, 30 min, 4 °C) and postfixed in 0.1 m phosphate buffer containing 1% OsO4 (aqueous osmium tetroxide) for 30 min at 4 °C. Then the preparations were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and embedded in Epon. Ultrathin sections (50–80 nm) were contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate before examination with a Jeol (Tokyo, Japan) CX100 electron microscope at 60 kV. The mitochondrial preparations were incubated at 30 or 37 °C, under different conditions. Unless otherwise stated, the incubation medium was a saline containing 140 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm K-MOPS, pH adjusted to 7.3 with KOH. A small volume of mitochondrial preparation was added so that the final protein concentration was about 0.7 mg/ml. The final volume of incubation medium was 1 ml. The duration of incubation was usually 10 or 15 min. When the incubation medium contained added ThDP, the mitochondria were washed twice by centrifugation (11,000 × g, 10 min) in medium B in order to remove excess ThDP that would interfere with ThTP estimation. The final pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of 12% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 3 min. The supernatant was extracted with diethyl ether, and thiamine derivatives were determined by HPLC (42Bettendorff L. Peeters M. Jouan C. Wins P. Schoffeniels E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In order to check whether ThTP synthesized in mitochondria is free or bound to matrix proteins, the mitochondrial pellet was suspended in 500 μl of hypotonic phosphate buffer (10 mm, pH 7.5) for 10 min and freeze-thawed (−80 °C) twice. After centrifugation (20,000 × g, 10 min), the pellet was suspended in 200 μl of 12% trichloroacetic acid, and 80 μl of 72% trichloroacetic acid were added to the supernatant (400 μl). After centrifugation and trichloroacetic acid extraction, ThTP was determined in both fractions. The authenticity of ThTP synthesized was checked by enzymatic hydrolysis using a specific recombinant ThTPase, as previously described (7Makarchikov A.F. Lakaye B. Gulyai I.E. Czerniecki J. Coumans B. Wins P. Grisar T. Bettendorff L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1477-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To 50 μl of mitochondrial trichloroacetic acid extract treated with diethyl ether we added 10 μl of Bistris propane buffer (final concentration 156 mm, pH 8.0), 2 μl of MgCl2 (final concentration 3.125 mm), and 2 μl of (9.6 mg/ml) purified human recombinant ThTPase (43Lakaye B. Makarchikov A.F. Wins P. Margineanu I. Roland S. Lins L. Aichour R. Lebeau L. El Moualij B. Zorzi W. Coumans B. Grisar T. Bettendorff L. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1348-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The samples were then analyzed by HPLC. Oxygen consumption was measured polarographically using a Clark-type electrode (Hansatech, King's Lynn, Norfolk, UK) in a 2-ml cell at 25 °C in the same saline as for ThTP synthesis (140 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm K-MOPS, pH adjusted to 7.3 with KOH) in the presence of Pi (5 mm), succinate (5 mm), and ADP (0.2 mm). Typically, the respiratory control ratio (RCR) is calculated from the ratio of O2 consumption at state 3 over state 4, but because our preparation contained a significant ATPase activity, we instead estimated RCR from state 3 over state 2 respiration. The uncoupled respiratory control (URC) was calculated from the ratio of O2 consumption in the presence of CCCP (1 μm) over the O2 consumption in the presence of oligomycin (1 μg/ml). ATP synthesis was measured in the presence of Pi (5 mm), ADP (0.2 mm), succinate (5 mm), or other substrates and various metabolic inhibitors at the concentrations indicated. An aliquot (1 ml) of the mitochondrial suspension was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence of 1 mm ThDP, 5 mm pyruvate, 5 mm Pi and 10 μl of H332PO4 (3.7 MBq final). The mitochondria were then washed twice, treated with 12% trichloroacetic acid, and centrifuged for 3 min at 5000 × g. After extraction with diethyl ether, the supernatant was used for the assay of thiamine derivatives by HPLC, and the pellet was used for the determination of protein concentration by the method of Peterson (37Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7134) Google Scholar). The HPLC effluent was collected (0.5-ml samples), and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation. Thiamine and its phosphate esters were determined by HPLC after oxidation to fluorescent thiochromes (42Bettendorff L. Peeters M. Jouan C. Wins P. Schoffeniels E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). ATP was determined by HPLC using either UV detection (44Hill M. Dupaix A. Volfin P. Kurkdian A. Arrio B. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 132-141Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) or fluorescence detection after ethenylation with chloroacetaldehyde by a slight modification of previously published methods (45Levitt B. Head R.J. Westfall D.P. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 46Lazarowski E.R. Tarran R. Grubb B.R. van Heusden C.A. Okada S. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36855-36864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). After precipitation, the trichloroacetic acid (12%) was extracted from the supernatants by diethyl ether. To 150 μl of sample were added 25 μl of sodium acetate (1 m, pH 4.0) and 25 μl of chloroacetaldehyde. After incubation (30 min, 72 °C), the samples were put on ice, and 50 μl of NH4HCO3 (0.5 m) were added. Control solutions containing ATP, ADP, or AMP were treated the same way and used as standards. Ethenylated adenine nucleotides were separated by HPLC and detected fluorimetrically (300 nm for excitation and 420 nm for emission) using a 5-μm Apollo C18 column (150 × 4.6 mm, Varian B.V. Middelburg, The Netherlands) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a gradient elution. Solvent A was composed of sodium phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 6.0). Solvent B contained 70% solvent A and 30% methanol.

Yet, efforts to evict nest contents by the blind and naked common cuckoo Cuculus canorus hatchling are counterintuitive as both adult parasites and large older cuckoo chicks appear to be better suited to tossing the eggs and young of the foster parents.Here we show experimentally that egg tossing imposed a recoverable growth cost of mass gain in common cuckoo chicks during the nestling period in nests of great reed warbler Acrocephalus arundinaceus hosts. Growth rates of skeletal traits and morphological variables involved in the solicitation of foster parental care remained similar between evictor and non-evictor chicks throughout development. We also detected no increase in predation rates for evicting nests, suggesting that egg tossing behavior by common cuckoo hatchlings does not increase the conspicuousness of nests.The temporary growth cost of egg eviction by common cuckoo hatchlings is the result of constraints imposed by rejecter host adults and competitive nestmates on the timing and mechanism of parasite virulence."
https://openalex.org/W2025289525,"The East Asian variant of mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) exhibits significantly reduced dehydrogenase, esterase, and nitroglycerin (GTN) denitrating activities. The small molecule Alda-1 was reported to partly restore low acetaldehyde dehydrogenase activity of this variant. In the present study we compared the wild type enzyme (ALDH2*1) with the Asian variant (ALDH2*2) regarding GTN bioactivation and the effects of Alda-1. Alda-1 increased acetaldehyde oxidation by ALDH2*1 and ALDH2*2 approximately 1.5- and 6-fold, respectively, and stimulated the esterase activities of both enzymes to similar extent as the coenzyme NAD. The effect of NAD was biphasic with pronounced inhibition occurring at > or = 5 mM. In the presence of 1 mM NAD, Alda-1 stimulated ALDH2*2-catalyzed ester hydrolysis 73-fold, whereas the NAD-stimulated activity of ALDH2*1 was inhibited because of 20-fold increased inhibitory potency of NAD in the presence of the drug. Although ALDH2*2 exhibited 7-fold lower GTN denitrating activity and GTN affinity than ALDH2*1, the rate of nitric oxide formation was only reduced 2-fold, and soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) activation was more pronounced than with wild type ALDH2 at saturating GTN. Alda-1 caused slight inhibition of GTN denitration and did not increase GTN-induced sGC activation in the presence of either variant. The present results indicate that Alda-1 stimulates established ALDH2 activities by improving NAD binding but does not improve the GTN binding affinity of the Asian variant. In addition, our data revealed an unexpected discrepancy between GTN reductase activity and sGC activation, suggesting that GTN denitration and bioactivation may reflect independent pathways of ALDH2-catalyzed GTN biotransformation."
https://openalex.org/W2060211321,"Isoniazid (INH) is an anti-tuberculosis prodrug that is activated by mammalian lactoperoxidase and Mycobacterium tuberculosis catalase peroxidase (MtCP). We report here binding studies, an enzyme assay involving INH, and the crystal structure of the complex of bovine lactoperoxidase (LPO) with INH to illuminate binding properties and INH activation as well as the mode of diffusion and interactions together with a detailed structural and functional comparison with MtCP. The structure determination shows that isoniazid binds to LPO at the substrate binding site on the distal heme side. The substrate binding site is connected to the protein surface through a long hydrophobic channel. The acyl hydrazide moiety of isoniazid interacts with Phe(422) O, Gln(423) O(epsilon1), and Phe(254) O. In this arrangement, pyridinyl nitrogen forms a hydrogen bond with a water molecule, W-1, which in turn forms three hydrogen bonds with Fe(3+), His(109) N(epsilon2), and Gln(105) N(epsilon2). The remaining two sides of isoniazid form hydrophobic interactions with the atoms of heme pyrrole ring A, C(beta) and C(gamma) atoms of Glu(258), and C(gamma) and C(delta) atoms of Arg(255). The binding studies indicate that INH binds to LPO with a value of 0.9 x 10(-6) m for the dissociation constant. The nitro blue tetrazolium reduction assay shows that INH is activated by the reaction of LPO-H(2)O(2) with INH. This suggests that LPO can be used for INH activation. It also indicates that the conversion of INH into isonicotinoyl radical by LPO may be the cause of INH toxicity."

Recently, we presented autosomal dominant hypomagnesemia as a new phenotypic characteristic associated with a mutation in Kv1.1 (N255D) (Glaudemans, B., van der Wijst, J., Scola, R. H., Lorenzoni, P. J., Heister, A., van der Kemp, A. W., Knoers, N. V., Hoenderop, J. G., and Bindels, R. J. (2009) J. Clin. Invest. 119, 936-942). A conserved asparagine at position 255 in the third transmembrane segment was converted into an aspartic acid, resulting in a non-functional channel. In this study, we explored the functional consequence of this conserved residue by substitution with other hydrophobic, polar, or charged amino acids (N255E, N255Q, N255A, N255V, N255T, and N255H). Upon overexpression in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, cell surface biotinylation revealed plasma membrane expression of all mutant channels. Next, we used the whole-cell patch clamp technique to demonstrate that the N255E and N255Q mutants were non-functional. Substitution of Asn-255 with other amino acids (N255A, N255V, N255T, and N255H) did not prevent ion conduction, and these mutant channels activated at more negative potentials when compared with wild-type channels, -41.5 +/- 1.6, -45.5 +/- 2.0, -50.5 +/- 1.9, and -33.8 +/- 1.3 mV to -29.4 +/- 1.1 mV, respectively. The time constant of activation was significantly faster for the two most hydrophobic mutations, N255A (6.2 +/- 0.2 ms) and N255V (5.2 +/- 0.3 ms), and the hydrophilic mutant N255T (9.8 +/- 0.4 ms) in comparison with wild type (13.0 +/- 0.9 ms). Furthermore, the voltage dependence of inactivation was shifted approximately 13 mV to more negative potentials in all mutant channels except for N255H. Taken together, our data showed that an asparagine at position 255 in Kv1.1 is required for normal voltage dependence and kinetics of channel gating."
https://openalex.org/W2042203700,"ß-Catenin is a component of adherens junctions that also acts as a transcriptional coactivator when expressed in the nucleus. Growth factors are believed to regulate the nuclear expression of ß-catenin via inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) by phosphorylation, resulting in increased ß-catenin protein stability. Here, we report on a novel pathway that regulates the expression and nuclear presence of ß-catenin. In proliferating human airway smooth muscle cells, we observed increased expression of ß-catenin, which was required for proliferation. Interestingly, increased ß-catenin expression was accompanied by an increase in ß-catenin mRNA and was independent of ß -catenin liberation from the plasma membrane, suggesting a role for de novo synthesis. This was confirmed using actinomycin D and cycloheximide, which abrogated the induction and nuclear localization of ß-catenin protein. GSK-3 inhibition using SB216763 failed to regulate ß-catenin mRNA. However, expression of dominant negative H-Ras or pharmacological inhibition of MEK reduced serum and TGF-ß-induced ß-catenin mRNA and protein. Collectively, these data indicate that ß-catenin is an important signaling intermediate in airway smooth muscle growth and that its cellular accumulation and nuclear localization require de novo protein synthesis effected, in part, via H-Ras and MEK.—Gosens, R., Baarsma, H.

https://openalex.org/W2090695673,"Epigenetic regulation of transcription plays an important role in cell-specific gene expression by altering chromatin structure and access of transcriptional regulators to DNA binding sites. Surfactant protein B (Sftpb) is a developmentally regulated lung epithelial gene critical for lung function. Thyroid transcription factor 1 (Nkx2-1) regulates Sftpb gene expression in various species. We show that Nkx2-1 binds to the mouse Sftpb (mSftpb) promoter in the lung. In a mouse lung epithelial cell line (MLE-15), Nkx2-1 knockdown reduces Sftpb expression, and mutation of Nkx2-1 cis-elements significantly reduces mSftpb promoter activity. Whether chromatin structure modulates Nkx2-1 regulation of Sftpb transcription is unknown. We found that DNA methylation of the mSftpb promoter inversely correlates with known patterns of Sftpb expression <i>in vivo</i>. The mSftpb promoter activity can be manipulated by altering its cytosine methylation status <i>in vitro</i>. Nkx2-1 activation of the mSftpb promoter is impaired by DNA methylation. The unmethylated Sftpb promoter shows an active chromatin structure enriched in the histone modification H3K4me3 (histone 3-lysine 4 trimethylated). The ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling protein Brg1 is recruited to the Sftpb promoter in Sftpb-expressing, but not in non-expressing tissues and cell lines. Brg1 knockdown in MLE-15 cells greatly decreases H3K4me3 levels at the Sftpb promoter region and expression of the Sftpb gene. Brg1 can be co-immunoprecipitated with Nkx2-1 protein. Last, Nkx2-1 and Brg1 with intact ATPase activity are required for mSftpb promoter activation <i>in vitro</i>. Our findings suggest that DNA methylation and chromatin modifications cooperate with Nkx2-1 to regulate Sftpb gene cell specific expression."

We had previously hypothesized that the presence of interfacial water molecules is partially responsible for this thermodynamic behavior. We present here a thermodynamic, structural, and molecular dynamics simulation study of the interaction of p41 with Abl-SH3 and a set of mutants designed to alter the water-mediated interaction network. Our results provide a detailed description of the dynamic properties of the interfacial water molecules and a molecular interpretation of the thermodynamic effects elicited by the mutations in terms of the modulation of the water-mediated hydrogen bond network. In the light of these results, a new dual binding mechanism is proposed that provides a better description of proline-rich ligand recognition by Abl-SH3 and that has important implications for rational design."

Recruitment of clathrin adaptors, including epsins, CALM/AP180, Dab2, HIP1/1R, and AP-2, to the plasma membrane strictly requires the presence of PI(4,5)P2, which associates directly with cognate recognition motifs and domains within these proteins. AP-2 is a heterotetrameric complex composed of α, β2, μ2, and σ2 subunits that fold into a largely α-helical solenoid (termed the “core”) with two appendage domains joined to the core by long flexible linkers (11Collins B.M. McCoy A.J. Kent H.M. Evans P.R. Owen D.J. Cell. 2002; 109: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Membrane recruitment of AP-2 is thought to be accomplished by a coincidence detection system involving transmembrane cargo proteins (12Loerke D. Mettlen M. Yarar D. Jaqaman K. Jaqaman H. Danuser G. Schmid S.L. PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e57Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) bound to AP-2μ or AP-σ2 (13Kelly B.T. McCoy A.J. Spate K. Miller S.E. Evans P.R. Honing S. Owen D.J. Nature. 2008; 456: 976-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) via sorting motif peptides and two binding sites for PI(4,5)P2 within the AP-2 core (11Collins B.M. McCoy A.J. Kent H.M. Evans P.R. Owen D.J. Cell. 2002; 109: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). One site is located within the N-terminal portion of the α subunit; this site is mainly responsible for targeting AP-2 to the plasma membrane (14Gaidarov I. Keen J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The second site within the μ2 subunit (15Rohde G. Wenzel D. Haucke V. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) presumably requires prior activation of AP-2 through a phosphorylation-induced conformational change by which the C-terminal sorting signal binding domain of AP-2μ gets dislodged from the AP-2 core. This conformational opening enables μ2 to recognize YXXØ-based sorting motifs within the cytoplasmic domain of transmembrane cargo proteins and to interact with PI(4,5)P2 in the membrane (16Höning S. Ricotta D. Krauss M. Späte K. Spolaore B. Motley A. Robinson M. Robinson C. Haucke V. Owen D.J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 519-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Hence, PI(4,5)P2 is required for the initial targeting of AP-2 to the plasma membrane as well as for cargo recognition, which in turn serves to stabilize nascent coated pits during CME (12Loerke D. Mettlen M. Yarar D. Jaqaman K. Jaqaman H. Danuser G. Schmid S.L. PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e57Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Given that CME is a pathway active in most cell types, one might expect that PIPKI-mediated synthesis of PI(4,5)P2 would be subject to common mechanisms of spatiotemporal regulation. In support of this idea, it has been reported that PIPKI isozymes associate with AP-2 via direct interaction between the kinase core and a site within AP-2μ distinct from that involved in recognizing YXXØ-based sorting motifs. Moreover, cargo protein binding has been shown to stimulate PIPKI activity, suggesting that synthesis of an endocytic pool of PI(4,5)P2 is under the control of a positive feedback loop (17Krauss M. Kukhtina V. Pechstein A. Haucke V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11934-11939Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Such a mechanism might be important for sustaining endocytosis under conditions of intense competition for PI(4,5)P2 by other pathways. Synapses face special challenges with respect to membrane trafficking because of the spatial and temporal constraints of chemical neurotransmission (4Galli T. Haucke V. Sci. STKE. 2004; 2004: re19PubMed Google Scholar). A number of independent lines of evidence indicate a central role for PI(4,5)P2 metabolism in exo-/endocytic cycling of SVs. Perturbation of PI(4,5)P2 breakdown by genetic or acute manipulation of the inositol phosphatase synaptojanin impairs SV endocytosis at the stage of vesicle uncoating, resulting in synaptic depression following intense stimulation (18Cremona O.

Most importantly, in mice the loss of PIPKIγ, the major synthesizing enzyme at synapses, produces defects in SV recycling including significantly reduced frequencies of spontaneous miniature postsynaptic currents and decreased rates of clathrin-mediated SV endocytosis (20Di Paolo G. Moskowitz H.S. Gipson K. Wenk M.R. Voronov S. Obayashi M. Flavell R. Fitzsimonds R.M. Ryan T.A. De Camilli P. Nature. 2004; 431: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). These data suggest a crucial role for PIPKIγ-mediated PI(4,5)P2 generation in CME of SV proteins. Consistent with these results, it has been reported that the tail domain of PIPKIγ-p90, the major splice isoform in neurons, can associate directly with the β2 appendage domain (21Nakano-Kobayashi A. Yamazaki M. Unoki T. Hongu T. Murata C. Taguchi R. Katada T. Frohman M.A. Yokozeki T. Kanaho Y. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1105-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and/or the sorting signal binding domain of the μ2 subunit of AP-2 (22Bairstow S.F. Ling K. Su X. Firestone A.J. Carbonara C. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20632-20642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, overexpression of the AP-2-binding PIPKIγ tail domain has been shown to impair depolarization-induced SV endocytosis (21Nakano-Kobayashi A. Yamazaki M. Unoki T. Hongu T. Murata C. Taguchi R. Katada T. Frohman M.A. Yokozeki T. Kanaho Y. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1105-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The precise structural basis of these effects, however, has remained elusive. In this work we report on the crystal structures of a peptide derived from the 28-amino acid splice insert of the PIPKIγ-p90 tail in complex with the β2 appendage or the C-terminal sorting signal binding domain of AP-2μ. Our biochemical and structure-based mutagenesis analysis revealed that association of the natively unfolded tail domain of PIPKIγ-p90 with AP-2 involves both of these interaction sites. Moreover, the ability of the PIPKIγ tail to impair endocytic retrieval of SV proteins in primary neurons is critically dependent on its association with both AP-2β and AP-2μ. Our data indicate that interactions between AP-2 and the tail domain of PIPKIγ-p90 may serve to regulate complex formation and enzyme activity, suggesting a model according to which multiple interactions between PIPKIγ-p90 and AP-2 lead to spatiotemporally controlled PI(4,5)P2 synthesis during SV endocytosis.

Site-directed mutants of PIPKIγ-p90 or GST-β2-ear were generated using overlap extension PCR with mutagenic primers followed by digestion and ligation into EcoRI/NotI-cleaved pGEX4T-1. The identities of the DNA inserts and the presence of mutations were confirmed by double-stranded DNA sequencing. Constructs encoding His6-C-μ2 or HA-PIPKIγ-p90 have been described previously (17Krauss M. Kukhtina V. Pechstein A. Haucke V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11934-11939Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Constructs in pGEX4T-1 and pET28 were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21-Codon PlusTM (DE3)-RP competent cells (Stratagene). His6- or GST-tagged fusion proteins were expressed and purified using HIS-SelectTM nickel affinity gel (Sigma) or GST Bind® resin (Novagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. For isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments, the His6-C-μ2 or His6-β2 appendage was purified using HisTrap HP columns (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The proteins were further purified by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex S200, Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 200 mm NaCl. Rat brain extract was prepared from frozen rat brains homogenized in 10 ml of homogenization buffer (4 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 320 mm sucrose, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) by using a glass-Teflon homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g. The supernatant was then adjusted to 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm MgCl2 containing 1% Triton X-100. Following incubation for 10 min on ice, the extract was centrifuged for 15 min at 43,500 × g. The resulting supernatant was precleared by ultracentrifugation for 15 min at 184,000 × g and used for pulldown experiments. For preparation of rat brain synaptosomal extracts, homogenized rat brain was centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g. Postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged for 20 min at 14,600 × g. The crude synaptosomal pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of homogenization buffer containing 1 mm PMSF and protease inhibitor mixture followed by further centrifugation for 20 min at 14,600 × g. The resulting synaptosomal pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer containing 1 mm PMSF and protease inhibitor mixture and adjusted to 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm MgCl2 containing 0.5% CHAPS. Synaptosomes were incubated for 40 min at 4 °C. The resulting lysate was precleared by further centrifugation steps, first for 15 min at 35,000 × g and then for 15 min at 184,000 × g, and used for pulldown experiments. For GST pulldowns GST or GST-PIPKIγ-p90-(451–668) was incubated with 3 mg of rat brain extract (in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 320 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitor mixture) or 900 μg of rat brain synaptosomal extract (in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 320 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5% CHAPS, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitor mixture) for 1 h by end-over-end rotation at 4 °C. The beads were extensively washed four times, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Alternatively, 7 μg of GST or GST-PIPKIγ-p90-(451–668) was incubated with 7 μg of His6-talin FERM domain or His6-C-μ2 for 1 h at 4 °C in 100 μl of pulldown buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1% Triton X-100). For β2-ear pulldowns, 50 μg of GST or GST-PIPKIγ-p90-(451–668) was incubated with an equimolar amount of His6-β2-ear for 1 h at 4 °C in 500 μl of pulldown buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% Tween 20). Beads were washed extensively (four times), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting. An E. coli construct containing the gene coding for the ear domain of the β2 subunit of AP-2 (His6-β2 appendage, amino acids 705–937) was cultured in “double” LB medium supplemented with kanamycin (40 μg/ml each). When the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.7, overexpression was induced by supplementing the culture with 0.8 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and cells were harvested 3 h later. His6-β2ear was isolated by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography (Qiagen), and the His6 tag cleaved off by thrombin and β2-ear was purified by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex S75, Amersham Biosciences). The purified protein was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 8, and 150 mm NaCl, concentrated to about 60–80 mg/ml, and supplied with a 5-fold molar surplus of the PIPKIγ-p90 pentadecapeptide YFPTDERSWVYSPLH. Crystals were grown at 18 °C using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method in the presence of trimethylphenylammonium-exchanged hectorite (<2 μm). The reservoir solution contained 18% polyethylene glycol 8000, 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 4 mm dithiothreitol. Drops were prepared by mixing 1 μl of reservoir and 1 μl of protein/peptide solution at 80 mg/ml. Crystal showers with poorly defined microcrystals not suitable for single crystal x-ray studies appeared within 10–30 s. To slow the crystallization process, nucleation seeds were introduced in the form of trimethylphenylammonium-exchanged hectorite (<2 μm). Thin plate-like crystals formed around these sites within 60 min and reached their final size in about 3 h at 18 °C. Single crystals of the AP-2 β2 ear co-crystallized with the above mentioned PIPKIγ pentadecapeptide were soaked briefly in a cryoprotection medium of 18% polyethylene glycol 8000, 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 4 mm dithiothreitol, and 15% v/v glycerol, mounted in a nylon loop, and then flash-cooled in liquid N2.

https://openalex.org/W2048801511,"When yeast cells detect external amino acids via their permease-like Ssy1 sensor, the cytosolic precursor forms of Stp1 and Stp2 transcription factors are activated by endoproteolytic removal of their N-terminal domains, a reaction catalyzed by the Ssy5 endoprotease. The processed Stp factors then migrate into the nucleus, where they activate transcription of several amino acid permease genes including AGP1. We report here that the STP1 and STP2 genes most likely derive from the whole genome duplication that occurred in a yeast ancestor. Although Stp1 and Stp2 have been considered redundant, we provide evidence that they functionally diverged during evolution. Stp2 is the only factor processed when amino acids are present at low concentration, and the transcriptional activation of AGP1 promoted by Stp2 is moderate. Furthermore, only Stp2 can sustain Agp1-dependent utilization of amino acids at low concentration. In contrast, Stp1 is only processed when amino acids are present at high concentration, and it promotes higher level transcriptional activation of AGP1. Domain swapping experiments show that the N-terminal domains of Stp1 and Stp2 are responsible for these proteins being cleaved at different amino acid concentrations. Last, induction of the DIP5 permease gene by amino acids depends on Stp2 but not Stp1. We propose that post-whole genome duplication co-conservation of the STP1 and STP2 genes was favored by functional divergence of their products, likely conferring to cells an increased ability to adapt to various amino acid supply conditions.

We propose that post-whole genome duplication co-conservation of the STP1 and STP2 genes was favored by functional divergence of their products, likely conferring to cells an increased ability to adapt to various amino acid supply conditions. Yeast cells possess a signaling pathway activated by external amino acids. This activation leads to transcriptional induction of a set of amino acid permease genes, including AGP1, GNP1, BAP2, BAP3, and DIP5 (1Boles E. André B. Boles E. Krämer R. Molecular Mechanisms Controlling Transmembrane Transport. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2004: 121-153Google Scholar, 2Ljungdahl P.O. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2009; 37: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). At the start of this pathway is Ssy1, a protein member of the amino acid permease family (3Jørgensen M.U. Bruun M.B. Didion T. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Yeast. 1998; 14: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Ssy1 is apparently devoid of transport activity and also differs from classical amino acid permeases by a much larger N-terminal cytosolic domain and two larger external loops between transmembrane domains (4Didion T.

Biol. 1999; 19: 5405-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). According to a recent model, Ssy1 would bind directly to external amino acids, thus stabilizing a signaling, outward-facing conformation (7Wu B. Ottow K. Poulsen P. Gaber R.F. Albers E. Kielland-Brandt M.C. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In response to this binding, the cytosolic precursor forms of the Stp1 and Stp2 transcription factors are cleaved by the Ssy5 endoprotease (8Andréasson C. Ljungdahl P.O. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3158-3172Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 9Abdel-Sater F. El Bakkoury M. Urrestarazu A. Vissers S. André B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9771-9785Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The released C-terminal domains of the Stp factors are then translocated into the nucleus (8Andréasson C. Ljungdahl P.O. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3158-3172Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), where they activate transcription of amino acid permease genes via an upstream UASAA sequence (10De Boer M. Bebelman J.P.

Genetics. 2004; 166: 1727-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Ssy1-dependent activation of the Ssy5 protease in response to amino acids requires several intermediary factors, i.e. Ptr3, casein kinase I, and the SCFGrr1 ubiquitin ligase complex (1Boles E. André B. Boles E. Krämer R. Molecular Mechanisms Controlling Transmembrane Transport. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2004: 121-153Google Scholar, 2Ljungdahl P.O. Biochem. Soc.

Lai W. Breslav M. Naider F. Becker J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It is hyperphosphorylated in response to amino acids (13Liu Z. Thornton J. Spírek M. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 551-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation depends on casein kinase I (13Liu Z. Thornton J. Spírek M. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 551-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), known to play a crucial role in the amino acid signaling pathway (9Abdel-Sater F. El Bakkoury M. Urrestarazu A. Vissers S.

Biol. 2008; 28: 551-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The positive action of casein kinase I appears to be counteracted by a CKI phosphatase complex containing Rts1 as a regulatory subunit (14Eckert-Boulet N. Larsson K. Wu B. Poulsen P. Regenberg B. Nielsen J. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The SCFGrr1 complex also plays an essential role in the pathway, but its exact role remains unclear (15Bernard F. André B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 496: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the Ssy1-Ptr3-casein kinase I-SCFGrr1 factors activate the Ssy5 endoprotease remains unknown. Experiments suggest that Ssy5 activation involves relief from a negative control exerted by the N terminus of the enzyme on its C-terminal catalytic domain (16Andréasson C. Heessen S. Ljungdahl P.O.

STP plasmids were constructed by in vivo recombination between the CEN-based pFL38 vector and one, two, or three DNA fragments amplified by PCR using the genomic DNA of strains CA045 (STP1-HA3 ura3) or JA827 (STP2-(GA)5-HA3 ura3) as a template. The oligonucleotides used to generate the PCR fragments are listed in supplemental Table 1. All plasmids were verified by sequencing. Total protein extracts were prepared as described previously (21Hein C. Springael J.Y. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. André B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Proteins were resuspended in 200 μl of sample buffer and incubated for 10 min at 95 °C. For immunoblot analysis, equal quantities of proteins were loaded onto an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel in a Tricine system. After transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), the Stp1-HA3 and Stp2-(GA)5-HA3 proteins were detected with monoclonal antibodies raised against HA (1:10000; Roche Diagnostics). Phosphoglycerate kinase, used as a loading control, was detected with monoclonal antibodies (1:5000; Invitrogen). Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (GE Healthcare) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Roche Diagnostics). β-Galactosidase activities were measured as described previously (22André B. Hein C. Grenson M. Jauniaux J.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 237: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and are expressed in nmol of ο-nitrophenol/min/mg of protein. Protein concentrations were measured with the Folin reagent, and the standard used was bovine serum albumin. For each β-galactosidase assay, the indicated values correspond to the means of at least two independent sets of cultures and experiments, and the error bars correspond to S.D. Flasks of minimal medium containing increasing concentrations of phenylalanine as the sole nitrogen source were inoculated with identical amounts of cells and incubated for 2 days. The optical density at 660 nm reached by each culture was measured, and cultures without phenylalanine served as blanks. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed essentially as described previously (23Wery M. Ruidant S. Schillewaert S. Leporé N. Lafontaine D.L. RNA. 2009; 15: 406-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in duplicate using independent cultures. Stp1-HA3 and Stp2-(GA)5-HA3 were immunoprecipitated with Pan-Mouse IgG Dynabeads (Invitrogen) using an anti-HA antibody (12CA5). Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR on a StepOne Plus machine (Applied Biosystems) with the Platinium SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG with Rox (Invitrogen). The occupancy level for a specific fragment was defined as the ratio of immunoprecipitated to total DNA. The GAL1 ORF region was used as a non-transcribed control. The value 1.0 was arbitrarily given to the reference signal provided by amplifying the GAL1 gene. The lengths of the qPCR products were 127 bp (AGP1-0), 120 bp (AGP1-4), and 170 bp (AGP1-8). The positions of the qPCR products are depicted in Fig. 7. The oligonucleotide pairs used are listed in supplemental Table 1. The specificity of the qPCR amplification was checked for each oligonucleotide pair by melting curve analysis at the end of each qPCR run. Negative controls where the template DNA was replaced with sterile water revealed that the primers used did not form dimers. Orthologues of STP genes were retrieved from the Genolevures data base (24Sherman D.J. Martin T. Nikolski M. Cayla C. Souciet J.L. Durrens P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D550-D554Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and used in Blastp analyses (E threshold: 1e-40) against all proteins of several pre-WGD species (Zygosaccharomyces rouxii, Saccharomyces kluyveri, Kluyveromyces thermotolerans, Kluyveromyces lactis, Eremothecium (Ashbya) gossypii) and post-WGD species (Candida glabrata, Kluyveromyces polysporus) (supplemental Table 2) (24Sherman D.J. Martin T. Nikolski M. Cayla C. Souciet J.L. Durrens P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D550-D554Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The syntenic context of the STP genes was analyzed with the Yeast Gene Browser online tool (25Byrne K.P. Wolfe K.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D452-D455Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It is established that an ancestor of Saccharomyces cerevisiae underwent a WGD after diverging from yeast lineages like K. lactis, K. thermotolerans, or Kluyveromyces waltii (17Wolfe K.H. Shields D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar, 26Kellis M. Birren B.W. Lander E.S. Nature. 2004; 428: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). One member of most pairs of “twin” genes was subsequently lost from one of the chromosomes, and a minor fraction of these genes, about 10% in S. cerevisiae, subsisted as duplicates. Analysis of the STP gene orthologues in yeast lineages having diverged before or after the WGD (see “Experimental Procedures”) strongly suggests that the STP1 and STP2 genes derive from the WGD. In support of this view, pre-WGD yeast lineages typically contain a single STP gene, whereas C. glabrata and Saccharomyces castellii, two post-WGD yeast species, contain two. Furthermore, the neighboring genes of the unique STP gene present in pre-WGD yeast species like K. thermotolerans display syntenic conservation with genes close to either STP1 or STP2 of S. cerevisiae (Fig. 1). K. polysporus, a post-WGD species distantly related to S. cerevisiae (27Scannell D.R. Frank A.C. Conant G.C. Byrne K.P. Woolfit M. Wolfe K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 8397-8402Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), contains only one STP gene, suggesting that the other gene copy was lost during evolution. In contrast, some of the neighboring genes of this unique STP gene have been conserved as gene duplicates (Fig. 1). Conservation of both STP gene copies in S. cerevisiae and other post-WGD lineages raises the interesting possibility that Stp1 and Stp2 may have diverged functionally during evolution. We have accordingly shown that induction of AGP1 transcription by phenylalanine is reduced by more than 80% in a stp1Δ mutant but remains unaltered in a stp2Δ mutant (11Abdel-Sater F. Iraqui I. Urrestarazu A. André B. Genetics. 2004; 166: 1727-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Yet other papers (8Andréasson C. Ljungdahl P.O. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3158-3172Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 28de Boer M. Nielsen P.S. Bebelman J.P. Heerikhuizen H. Andersen H.A. Planta R.J.

Genet. 2001; 264: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) suggest that Stp1 and Stp2 might be functionally redundant, at least when AGP1 expression was induced by leucine; the stp1Δ and stp2Δ single mutations did not significantly alter this induction, whereas none was observed with the stp1Δ stp2Δ double mutant. We, thus, sought to determine whether the relative contributions of Stp1 and Stp2 to induction of AGP1 expression vary according to the amino acid inducer. For this we isolated a set of mutant strains containing a stp1Δ mutation, a stp2Δ mutation, or both and used them to monitor induction of AGP1 expression by various amino acids. We also analyzed the influence of a deletion mutation altering Uga35/Dal81, a pleiotropic transcription factor contributing importantly to induction of AGP1 transcription (5Iraqui I. Vissers S. Bernard F. de Craene J.O. Boles E. Urrestarazu A. André B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 989-1001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Abdel-Sater F. Iraqui I. Urrestarazu A. André B. Genetics. 2004; 166: 1727-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 30Boban M. Ljungdahl P.O. Genetics. 2007; 176: 2087-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). AGP1 expression was measured 2 h after the addition of phenylalanine, isoleucine, valine, tryptophan, or citrulline at high concentration (5 mm) to cells transformed with a low copy number plasmid bearing the AGP1-lacZ reporter construct (Fig. 2). In the wild type, the induction level varied according to the amino acid, Phe being the strongest and citrulline the weakest inducer. In the stp1Δ stp2Δ double-mutant strain, we observed no induction by any amino acid. Hence, the expression level observed in either single mutant should reflect the ability of the corresponding Stp protein to mediate induction. When Stp1 alone was present, the induction level varied strongly according to the amino acid and was often the same as, or close to that observed in the wild type. As a notable exception, citrulline promoted only weak Stp1-mediated induction. Stp2-mediated induction, on the other hand, varied much less according to the amino acid inducer, its level always remaining lower than the highest Stp1-mediated induction levels. Furthermore, Stp2 appeared largely responsible for induction of AGP1 expression by citrulline, the weakest inducer. Thus, Stp1 and Stp2 do not respond similarly to external amino acids. Interestingly, induction by Leu was about the same in the wild-type, stp1Δ, and stp2Δ strains, indicating that, as previously observed (8Andréasson C. Ljungdahl P.O. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3158-3172Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 28de Boer M. Nielsen P.S. Bebelman J.P. Heerikhuizen H. Andersen H.A. Planta R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 974-981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Nielsen P.S. van den Hazel B. Didion T. de Boer M. Jørgensen M. Planta R.J. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Andersen H.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2001; 264: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), Stp1 and Stp2 are largely redundant under these conditions. With an inducer such as Val, in contrast, the contributions of Stp1 and Stp2 appeared largely additive. In a previous work (11Abdel-Sater F. Iraqui I. Urrestarazu A. André B. Genetics. 2004; 166: 1727-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) we presented results suggesting that the residual induction of AGP1 expression by Phe observed in the stp1Δ mutant was not mediated by Stp2. Our present results obtained with the stp2Δ and stp1Δ stp2Δ strains isolated in this study (Fig. 2) contradict this finding. We have, thus, further analyzed the stp2Δ strain used here and the one (strain FA064) in that earlier study. In the stp2Δ strains used previously, it appears that the antibiotic resistance gene used to delete the STP2 coding region by gene replacement was integrated at the STP2 locus but without deleting the STP2 gene (supplemental Fig. S1). In the newly isolated stp2Δ mutants, STP2 is appropriately deleted. The data obtained with these mutants (Fig. 2) are also fully consistent with those of previous studies showing complete loss of induction in the stp1Δ stp2Δ mutant (8Andréasson C. Ljungdahl P.O. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3158-3172Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 28de Boer M. Nielsen P.S. Bebelman J.P. Heerikhuizen H. Andersen H.A. Planta R.J.

Genet. 2001; 264: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Uga35/Dal81 is a pleiotropic transcription factor containing a Zn(II)2-Cys6 cluster-type DNA binding domain (31Bricmont P.A. Daugherty J.R. Cooper T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1161-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 32Coornaert D. Vissers S. André B. Gene. 1991; 97: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is essential to full induction of AGP1 expression (5Iraqui I. Vissers S. Bernard F. de Craene J.O. Boles E. Urrestarazu A. André B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 989-1001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Abdel-Sater F. Iraqui I. Urrestarazu A. André B. Genetics. 2004; 166: 1727-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and to expression of other nitrogen compound-inducible genes, such as those involved in γ-aminobutyric acid, allophanate, and allantoin utilization (31Bricmont P.A. Daugherty J.R. Cooper T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1161-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 32Coornaert D. Vissers S. André B. Gene. 1991; 97: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In each induction mechanism, Uga35/Dal81 acts in conjunction with an inducer-specific transcription factor, e.g. Uga3 for γ-aminobutyric acid (33André B. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 220: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and Dal82/DurM for allophanate (34Dorrington R.A. Cooper T.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3777-3784Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 35André B. Jauniaux J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The results shown in Fig. 2A reveal that Uga35/Dal81 strongly potentiates Stp1-dependent induction, in keeping with previous results (11Abdel-Sater F. Iraqui I. Urrestarazu A. André B. Genetics. 2004; 166: 1727-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A weak though significant induction nevertheless subsists in the absence of Stp2 and Uga35, suggesting that Stp1 alone can activate AGP1 expression to some degree. In contrast, Uga35/Dal81 is essential to Stp2-dependent induction, indicating that Stp2 alone cannot activate AGP1 expression. These results were confirmed by growth tests on media containing a low concentration of Phe, Ile, or Leu as the sole nitrogen source (Fig. 2B). We previously reported that Agp1 is essential to growth on these media when the general amino acid permease, Gap1, is not functional (5Iraqui I. Vissers S. Bernard F. de Craene J.O. Boles E. Urrestarazu A. André B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 989-1001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented in Fig. 2B confirm that Agp1 is not functional when both Stp factors or Stp1 and Uga35 are defective, whereas it remains functional if Stp1 alone is functional. The above results clearly show that Stp1 and Stp2 diverged functionally during evolution. The activating power of Stp1 appears higher, as revealed when induction of AGP1 expression was assayed in response to the strongest inducers like Phe or Ile and by the ability of Stp1 to activate AGP1 expression in the absence of the Uga35/Dal81 co-activator. The activation power of Stp2 is lower, and this might explain why Stp2 absolutely needs Uga35/Dal81 for significant transcriptional activation of AGP1. On the other hand, the stronger response of Stp2 to citrulline, the weakest inducer, raises the possibility that Stp2 might respond more efficiently than Stp1 to limited activation of the amino acid signaling pathway. To test this hypothesis, we examined the induction of AGP1-lacZ expression in response to increasing concentrations of Phe (Fig. 3). In response to low Phe concentrations (25 and 50 μm), AGP1-lacZ induction was weak and principally Stp2-dependent, but at the highest Phe concentrations (1 and 5 mm), the much higher induction of AGP1-lacZ appeared to be largely mediated by Stp1, as shown also in Fig. 2A. Interestingly, in the presence of intermediate Phe concentrations (200 μm), the contributions of Stp1 and Stp2 appeared similar and additive. We next tested whether the apparent higher sensitivity of Stp2 to activation by the Ssy1 sensor correlates with a greater propensity to be cleaved by the Ssy5 endoprotease. Each Stp factor was tagged at its C terminus with three repeats of the HA epitope and tested for functionality (supplemental Fig. S2). In the case of Stp2, a linker consisting of glycine-alanine dipeptide repeats had to be inserted between the protein and the 3HA epitope to keep the protein active. In the absence of any amino acid inducer, Stp1 and Stp2 migrated in their uncleaved forms (Fig. 4). Two minutes after the addition of an amino acid, Stp1 and Stp2 appeared to have undergone partial processing. When Phe, Ile, Trp, or Leu was added to the medium, processing of both Stp factors was complete within 5 min. With Val and citrulline, cleavage of Stp1 and Stp2 remained partial even 5 min after the addition of the amino acid to the medium. Stp2 was more efficiently processed than Stp1 in the presence of citrulline, in keeping with the view that Stp2 contributes more importantly than Stp1 to activation of AGP1 expression in response to this poor inducer. We next compared processing of Stp1 and Stp2 in response to increasing concentrations of Phe (Fig. 5). At low Phe concentrations (25, 50, and 200 μm), Stp2 was more efficiently cleaved than Stp1, whereas both Stp factors were processed with similar efficiency in response to higher Phe concentrations (1 and 5 mm).FIGURE 5Stp2 is more readily processed than Stp1 when amino acids are present at low concentration. Strains CA045 (STP1-HA3 ura3) and JA827 (STP2-(GA)5-HA3 ura3) were grown on minimal medium with proline as sole nitrogen source. Phenylalanine (25, 50, 200, 1000, or 5000 μm) was then added or not (-) to the medium for 2 or 5 min. Total cell extracts were then prepared, and immunoblotting was carried out with anti-HA and anti-phosphoglycerate kinase (PgK) antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These results indicate that Stp2 has a greater propensity than Stp1 to be processed by the Ssy5 protease w"
https://openalex.org/W2036118170,"A previous study comparing non-emotive mice from the strain C57BL/6/ByJ with ABP/Le mice showed ABP/Le to be more anxious in an open-field situation. In the present study, several compounds affecting anxiety were assayed on ABP/Le and C57BL/6/ByJ mice using three behavioural models of anxiety: the elevated plus-maze, the light-dark discrimination test and the free exploratory paradigm. The compounds used were the full benzodiazepine receptor agonist, chlordiazepoxide, and the antagonist, flumazenil, the GABAA antagonist, bicuculline, the full 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT, and the mixed 5-HT1A/5-HT1B agonist, RU 24969. Results showed the effect of the compounds to be dependent on both the strain and the behavioural task. Several compounds found to be anxiolytic in ABP/Le mice had an anxiogenic effect on C57BL/6/ByJ mice. More behavioural changes were observed for ABP/Le in the elevated plus-maze, but the clearest findings for C57BL/6/ByJ mice were observed in the light-dark discrimination apparatus. These data demonstrate that anxious behaviour is a complex phenomenon which cannot be described by a single behavioural task nor by the action of a single compound."

There are, however, a number of experimental observations suggesting that the APP family of proteins might play a role in regulating cell adhesion. For example, most triple knock-out mice developed cortical dysplasias, a condition that could result from defects in the adhesion of migrating neurons to extracellular matrix (4Herms J. Anliker B. Heber S. Ring S. Fuhrmann M. Kretzschmar H. Sisodia S. Müller U. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4106-4115Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Overexpression of apl-1 in the worm caused organ detachment (7Hornsten A. Lieberthal J. Fadia S. Malins R. Ha L. Xu X. Daigle I. Markowitz M. O'Connor G. Plasterk R. Li C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1971-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and transgenic flies expressing human APP developed a blistered-wing phenotype (12Fossgreen A. Brückner B. Czech C.

Furthermore, in cell cultures, APP appears to concentrate to sites of adhesion (13Storey E. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Brain Res. 1996; 735: 217-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 14Yamazaki T. Koo E.H. Selkoe D.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1004-1010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sabo S.L. Ikin A.F.

Ha Y. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 343-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 11Dulubova I. Ho A. Huryeva I. Südhof T.C. Rizo J.

Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1614-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the x-ray structure, which contains the entire E2 region, the molecule forms a head-to-tail dimer (10Wang Y. Ha Y. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 343-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This observation has led to the suggestion that E2 might mediate homophilic interactions among APP molecules. F-spondin, a secreted protein involved in neuronal development and repair, also appears to interact directly with E2 (16Ho A. Südhof T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 2548-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Besides participating in these potentially important protein-protein interactions, E2 binds heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), which are abundant both inside the cell and in extracellular matrix. Although E1 also binds heparin, E2 appears to have a higher binding affinity (17Mok S.S. Sberna G. Heffernan D. Cappai R. Galatis D. Clarris H.J. Sawyer W.H. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Small D.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). How APP interacts with HSPG, and whether this interaction is important for its proposed function in regulating cell adhesion, are currently unknown. Here we use a combination of crystallographic and biochemical techniques to characterize the heparin binding site on the E2 domain of the worm homolog APL-1. The sodium salt of sucrose octasulfate (SOS) was obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals (Canada). All other reagents were obtained from common vendors and were of the highest available grade. Based on the human E2 structure and sequence alignment (10Wang Y. Ha Y. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 343-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we initially designed six constructs that differed only by several residues at both N and C termini. After subcloning into pET28a (Novagen), the proteins were overexpressed in BL21(DE3) cells (Stratagene). Unfortunately, crystals derived from these constructs were either twinned in morphology, or of low resolution (8 Å). Re-analysis of APL-1 sequence suggested that its most C-terminal helix (αF) might be longer and that sequence downstream of αF might form additional secondary structures. Thus a longer construct (APL-1234–472) was made, ligated into pET28a in-frame with an N-terminal His tag, and overexpressed in BL21(DE3). The His-tagged recombinant protein was purified using a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Invitrogen). After cleaving off the His tag by thrombin, the protein was concentrated and passed through a Superdex G-200 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) to remove aggregates. The longer construct eventually produced suitable crystals for diffraction analysis. All mutants of E2 used in this study were based on the APL-1234–472 construct and generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). All initial crystallization screens were performed in sitting drops using 96-well plates. After identifying crystallization leads, the conditions were usually repeated by hanging drop vapor diffusion method in 24-well Hampton crystallization trays. The best crystals were obtained from construct APL-1234–472 at room temperature: 1 μl of protein solution (20 mg/ml E2 or Se-Met-substituted E2, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 0.5 m NaCl) was mixed with 1 μl of freshly prepared well solution (20% PEG 3350, 15% isopropyl alcohol, 100 mm HEPES pH 7.5), and equilibrated with the same well solution in the dark; rod-like and needle-like crystals typically formed within 3 days. They were cryo-protected in 25% ethylene glycol before being flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected either in-house on a Rigaku R-axis 4E system or at National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) beamline X29. All diffraction images were processed by HKL2000 (33Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38570) Google Scholar). The Se-Met-containing crystals were generally more mosaic after freezing. The final data set used for phasing were merged from three data sets collected from a single low-mosaicity crystal by aiming the focused x-ray beam at different points along a needle-like crystal. The selenium sites were found and used to calculate SAD phases to 3.3-Å resolution using hkl2map (34Pape T. Schneider T.R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2004; 37: 843-844Crossref Google Scholar). The electron density map based on the experimental phases was easily interpretable in most regions of the molecule. The model was built using O (35Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar), and improved by iterative rounds of refinement using CNS (36Brünger A.T. et al.Acta Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), map inspection, and manual adjustments. To generate the complex with ligand, the protein crystal was soaked overnight in an artificial mother liquor containing 5 mm SOS before being cryo-protected and flash-frozen. The experiment was performed with a Beckman Optima XL-I at the Center for Analytical Ultracentrifugation of Macromolecular Assemblies at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. Sedimentation velocity data were analyzed with UltraScan (41Demeler B. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation: Techniques and Methods. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK2005: 210-229Google Scholar). Calculations were performed on the Lonestar cluster at the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of Texas at Austin, and on the Jacinto cluster at the Bioinformatics Core Facility at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. All measurements were made at 230 nm in a buffer containing 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 20 mm NaCl. The data were collected at 20 °C, and at 45 krpm, using standard epon 2-channel centerpieces. Partial specific volume of APL-1 was determined to be 0.728 cm3/g. Data were first analyzed by two-dimensional spectrum analysis with simultaneous removal of time-invariant noise (42Brookes E. Cao W. Demeler B. Eur. Biophys. J. 2009; (in press)Google Scholar) and then by van Holde-Weischet analysis and genetic algorithm refinement, followed by Monte Carlo analysis (43Demeler B. Brookes E. Colloid Polym. Sci. 2008; 286: 129-137Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Measurements were performed at three loading concentrations of E2 (A230 nm 0.39, 0.88, and 1.35). Data were collected using a Superdex S-200 10/30 HR column (GE Healthcare) connected to a HPLC System. Elution from the column was monitored by a photodiode array UV/VIS detector (2996 PDA, Waters Corp.), differential refractometer (OptiLab-rEx Wyatt Corp.), and static, multiangle laser light scattering detector (DAWN-EOS, Wyatt Corp.). The system was equilibrated in 10 mm HEPES, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0 at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Weight-average molecular weight was determined using ASTRA software as described (46Folta-Stogniew E. Williams K.R. J. Biomol. Tech. 1999; 10: 51-63PubMed Google Scholar) that used a Rayleigh-Debye-Gans light scattering model (see Equation 1), which related the amount of scattered light to the concentration and weight average molecular weight of solute and second virial coefficient, K*c/R(θ)=1/MW+2A2C(Eq. 1) where R(θ) is the intensity of excess scattered light at an angle θ, c is the concentration of the solute, Mw is the weight average molecular weight of the solute, A2 is the second virial coefficient, K* is an optical parameter equal to 4π2n2(dn/dc)2/(λ04NA), n is the refractive index, dn/dc is the refractive index increment for the solute, NA is Avogadro's number, and λ0 is the wavelength of the scattered light. The hydrodynamic radius Rh was measured on a DynaPro dynamic light scattering detector in batch mode at 1 mg/ml (Wyatt Corp.). The intensity correlation function was analyzed by the method of cumulants (38Koppel D.E. J. Chem. Phys. 1972; 57: 4814-4820Crossref Scopus (2729) Google Scholar) and regularization (39Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Teplow D.B. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 429-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) to extract Rh. The thermal stability test was performed on an AVIV Model 215 CD spectrometer. The protein sample was kept in phosphate-buffered saline buffer at a concentration of 0.3 mg/ml. Protein unfolding was monitored by a loss of rotation of polarized light at 222 nm upon heating (4 to 95 °C with one-degree increment and 6-min equilibration time). To ensure formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond in E371K/D342C/S362C, the purified mutant protein was diluted to 10 μg/ml with ice-cold phosphate buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. 1.4 mm reduced and 0.7 mm oxidized glutathione, and then 5% PEG 600, were added. Air was bubbled through a sparger into the protein solution for 2 days at 4 °C. The oxidized protein was repurified by a Ni2+ column. To generate a plasmid containing the apl-1(yn32) E371K mutation, DNA from yn32 animals were amplified with primers APP22 (5′-AAGCAGTGCAAGACCAAGAAG-3′) and APP19 (5′-TGCTGAAGGCCGATTCAAAGG-3′); the product was digested with SgrA1 and SphI (New England Biolabs) and subcloned into APL-1HSGFP (7Hornsten A. Lieberthal J. Fadia S. Malins R. Ha L. Xu X. Daigle I. Markowitz M. O'Connor G. Plasterk R. Li C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1971-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To generate a plasmid containing the yn32 E71K/D342C/S362C triple mutations, we digested the pET28a construct containing these mutations with BamHI and SphI and subcloned the fragment into APL-1HS to generate APL-1(E71K/D342C/S362C) (7Hornsten A. Lieberthal J. Fadia S. Malins R. Ha L. Xu X. Daigle I. Markowitz M. O'Connor G. Plasterk R. Li C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1971-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar); the APL-1(E71K/D342C/S362C) construct was digested with BglII and SacII, and subcloned into the APL-1HSGFP construct to generate APL-1(E71K/D342C/S362C)::GFP (7Hornsten A. Lieberthal J. Fadia S. Malins R. Ha L. Xu X. Daigle I. Markowitz M. O'Connor G. Plasterk R. Li C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1971-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Constructs were microinjected at 50 ng/μl as described (40Mello C. Fire A. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 451-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Extrachromosomal arrays were integrated into the genome by UV irradiation (Stratalinker; 300 μJ). Confocal images were taken on a Zeiss LSM 710. Approximately 500 μl of packed worms were lysed for each strain, and extracts were electrophoresed and Western blotted as described (7Hornsten A. Lieberthal J. Fadia S. Malins R. Ha L. Xu X. Daigle I. Markowitz M. O'Connor G. Plasterk R. Li C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1971-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar): blots were incubated with 1:5000 dilution of anti-APL-1EXT antisera and immunodetected; to ensure equal loading, total protein amount for the extracts was determined by a Bradford assay. The protein amounts were also confirmed by gel staining with Coomassie Blue; in addition, blots were subsequently stripped and reprobed with 1:500 anti-actin antisera (Sigma) (data not shown). Various E2 mutants were loaded onto a 1-ml heparin column (Amersham Biosciences) mounted on the ÄKTA FPLC system. The binding buffer was either 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0) or 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), and the elution buffers contains additional 2 m or 1 m NaCl, respectively. The amounts of salt required to elute the protein were recorded in S·m−1 by the internal conductivity probe, and later converted to molar concentrations for ease of comparison. The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the PDB with the following accession numbers: 3K66 and 3K6B. Because our initial attempt to solve the structure by molecular replacement using the human E2 coordinates failed, we resorted to Se-Met-substituted protein to solve the phase problem (Table 1). The 3.3 Å resolution experimental map derived from SAD phases was clear enough for us to trace the majority of the polypeptide backbone. Missing regions, primarily loops between helices, and most of the side chains were added later to the model when the calculated phases were improved and used to generate maps.TABLE 1Crystallographic statisticsSe-MetNativeSOSData collectionCell dimensions (Å)a = 98.1, c = 67.5a = 97.6, c = 68.0a = 97.3, c = 67.5Wavelength (Å)0.97951.54181.0809Resolution (Å)aHighest resolution shell is shown in parentheses.40.0-3.3 (3.42-3.30)30.0-2.7 (2.80-2.70)40.0-2.8 (2.90-2.80)Observed reflections158,160101,32086,604Unique reflections5,87810,4759,028Redundancy26.99.79.6Completeness (%)aHighest resolution shell is shown in parentheses.99.9 (100.0)99.1 (99.0)96.0 (71.4)<I/σ>aHighest resolution shell is shown in parentheses.11.9 (3.4)25.4 (2.0)20.7 (2.6)RmergeaHighest resolution shell is shown in parentheses.,bRmerge = Σ|Ii − <I> |/ΣIi.0.090 (0.559)0.055 (0.511)0.053 (0.346)RefinementResolution (Å)30.0-2.740.0-2.8Rwork/RfreecRwork = Σ| Fo − Fc | / ΣFo.

Open table in a new tab The C. elegans E2 is 34% identical in sequence to the human E2 (Fig. 1B). Therefore, as expected, the two structures appear similar (Fig. 2). The most prominent feature of E2 is a long α-helix (αC) that spans the entire length of the molecule, connecting its two halves (supplemental Fig. S1): the N-terminal portion of αC forms an anti-parallel coiled-coil with αB that constitutes one structural subdomain, and the C-terminal half of αC forms a four-helix bundle with αD, αE, and αF that constitutes the other subdomain. Near the center of the molecule, there is a short cleft formed between αB and αD, where a number of conserved and basic residues are clustered. When the worm and human E2 structures were superimposed, it became apparent that the angle between the two subdomains had changed. To facilitate the comparison between the two structures, we divided E2 in the middle of αC at residue 327 (441 for APP751). Previous proteolytic analysis of human APP indicated that this region of αC could partially unfold and become cleavable by trypsin (11Dulubova I. Ho A. Huryeva I. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9583-9588Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The N-terminal subdomains were superimposible with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.89 Å for 62 Cα atoms from helices αB (APL-1 residues 249–278) and αC (residues 295–326) (Fig. 2A). The C-terminal subdomains were superimposible with an r.m.s. deviation of 1.10 Å (1.71 Å when compared with the NMR structure; Ref. 11Dulubova I. Ho A. Huryeva I. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9583-9588Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) for 75 Cα atoms from helices αC (APL-1 residues 327–347), αD (residues 358–384), and αE (residues 393–419) (Fig. 2B). For APL-1, the electron density features were clearer in the turn between αD and αE, and at the C terminus, where two helical turns and a stretch of extended structure were added to the short αF observed in human APP (green in supplemental Fig. S1). This addition shows that the C terminus of E2 folds back to project the juxtamembrane region toward the midportion of E2. Although in both APL-1 and APP the central helix αC is continuous, when superimposed on the C-terminal subdomain, the N-terminal half of APL-1 appears to have bent outwards by about 26 degrees (Fig. 2B). It is not yet clear whether this bending is due to sequence difference or results from crystal packing, or simply reflects intrinsic conformational flexibilities of the molecule. We have previously noticed that proteins with similarly arranged coiled-coil domains, such as spectrin and α-catenin, can also bend near the middle of a long connecting helix (18Grum V.L. Li D. MacDonald R.I. Mondragón A. Cell. 1999; 98: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 19Pokutta S. Weis W.I. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). E2 has a calculated molecular mass of 28.9 kDa. It eluted from the size-exclusion column with an apparent molecular mass around 50 kDa. This result may indicate that E2 could form dimers in solution (10Wang Y. Ha Y. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 343-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, the elongated shape of the molecule renders this interpretation unreliable: for example, based on the crystal structure, the radius of gyration for a monomeric E2 was calculated to be around 26 Å (20Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2778) Google Scholar), a value that corresponded roughly to that of a spherically shaped 50-kDa protein. To accurately determine the oligomeric state of E2 in solution, we performed analytical ultracentrifugation and laser light scattering experiments (Fig. 3). A comparison between the sedimentation coefficient distributions at three E2 concentrations is shown in Fig. 3A. The van Holde-Weischet integral distribution plot showed identical sedimentation coefficient distributions for all three concentrations, suggesting that little or no oligomerization was occurring. To confirm the composition and identify the molecular weights, a global genetic algorithm/Monte Carlo analysis was performed (Fig. 3B), which showed a major species with a molecular mass of 31.9 (25.4, 33.9) kDa and a frictional ratio of 1.47 (1.39, 1.67) (in parenthesis: 95% confidence intervals). As expected for particles smaller than 1:20 of incident laser wavelength (633 nm), the static scattering signal was independent of molecular shape and yielded an average molecular mass of 29.3 kDa for E2 (Fig. 3C). Dynamic light scattering measurement determined a hydrodynamic radius of 3.0 ± 0.3 nm, which for a molar mass of 29.3 kDa yielded frictional ratio of 1.46. Taken together, these biophysical measurements strongly suggested that E2 was monomeric in the solution. Further evidence about the oligomeric state of E2 was provided in the supplemental data and Fig. S2. We previously found a single mutation (E371K) within the E2 region of APL-1 that caused a lethal phenotype (incorrectly labeled previously as E372K (7Hornsten A. Lieberthal J. Fadia S. Malins R. Ha L. Xu X. Daigle I. Markowitz M. O'Connor G. Plasterk R. Li C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1971-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar)). Although the mutation could have affected ligand binding and the release of soluble forms of APL-1 from the membrane by secretases (11Dulubova I. Ho A. Huryeva I. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9583-9588Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 16Ho A. Südhof T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 2548-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), a shortened construct of APL-1 bearing the E371K mutation that corresponded to secretase-cleaved protein (thus constitutively secreted) failed to rescue the lethal phenotype (data not shown). It was initially difficult to rationalize the effect of E371K mutation on protein structure because the corresponding residue in APP (Gln-483) was exposed on the surface (10Wang Y. Ha Y. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 343-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 11Dulubova I. Ho A. Huryeva I. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9583-9588Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After solving the structure of APL-1, we found that Glu-371 was buried by the two turns of α-helix added to short αF mentioned above (green in supplemental Fig. S1). The carboxylate group of Glu-371 formed a salt bridge with Arg-439, and was hydrogen-bonded to Trp-435, both from the extended αF (Fig. 4A). Replacing Glu-371 with a positively charged lysine was expected to disrupt these interactions. To test whether E371K could have destabilized the protein structure, we compared thermal unfolding curves of the wild-type and mutant E2 proteins. As shown in Fig. 4B, the wild-type protein showed two transitions, which were likely caused by non-cooperative unfolding of the two subdomains (between which there were little interactions). The N-terminal subdomain was probably responsible for the first and lower temperature transition because it was composed mainly of only two α-helices. The E371K mutation, which occurred in the C-terminal subdomain (supplemental Fig. S1), affected the higher temperature transition, lowering it by about ten degrees. In the transgenic animal, the mutant APL-1 protein accumulated to a very low level in intact worms (Fig. 4, C and D). This did not appear to be solely caused by the reduction of protein stability. At the temperature the worm was grown (20 °C), both wild-type and E371K E2s should have acquired a folded conformation (the mutant E2 unfolded around 42 °C). Based on the observation that insect APP homologs all appeared to have an intramolecular disulfide bond bridging αC and αD, 4R. Lauffer, personal communication. we introduced a disulfide bond to the same location in an attempt to restore E2 stability (supplemental Fig. S1). The triple mutant (D342C/S362C/E371K), after oxidization, seemed to be as stable as the wild-type protein (Fig. 4B). Nonetheless, the full-length APL-1 bearing the triple mutation still failed to rescue the phenotype in the worm (0/3 rescued lines), suggesting that the altered conformation in E371K must have triggered another mechanism for its clearance in vivo. How heparin interacts with E2 is not known. An earlier study used synthetic peptides to map the heparin binding site (17Mok S.S. Sberna G. Heffernan D. Cappai R. Galatis D. Clarris H.J. Sawyer W.H. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Small D.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The result could now be projected onto the known crystal structures, and suggested that helices αB and αD, located separately in the two subdomains, were probably both involved (Fig."
https://openalex.org/W2000224399,"Background Sensing of muramyl dipeptide (MDP) is impaired in Crohn's disease (CD) patients with disease-linked variants of the CARD15 (caspase activation and recruitment domain 15) gene. Animal studies suggest that normal CARD15 signalling prevents inflammatory bowel disease, and may be important for disease development in CD. However, only a small fraction of CD patients carry the disease linked CARD15 variants. The aim of this study was thus to investigate if changes could be found in CARD15 signalling in patients without disease associated CARD15 variants. Methodology/Principal Findings By mapping the response to MDP in peripheral monocytes obtained from CD patients in remission not receiving immunosuppresives, an impaired response to MDP was found in patients without disease linked CARD15 variants compared to control monocytes. This impairment was accompanied by a decreased activation of IκB kinase α/β (IKKα/β), the initial step in the nuclear factor κB (NFκB) pathway, whereas activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP)-kinases was unaffected. MDP additionally stimulates the inflammasome which is of importance for processing of cytokines. The inflammasome was constitutively activated in CD, but unresponsive to MDP both in CD and control monocytes. Conclusions/Significance These results suggest that inhibited MDP-dependent pathways in CD patients not carrying the disease-associated CARD15 variants might be of importance for the pathogenesis of CD. The results reveal a dysfunctional immune response in CD patients, not able to sense relevant stimuli on the one hand, and on the other hand possessing constitutively active cytokine processing."

https://openalex.org/W1980258131,"The ability of bacteria to rapidly evolve resistance to antibiotics is a critical public health problem. Resistance leads to increased disease severity and death rates, as well as imposes pressure towards the discovery and development of new antibiotic therapies. Improving understanding of the evolution and genetic basis of resistance is a fundamental goal in the field of microbiology.We have applied a new genomic method, Scalar Analysis of Library Enrichments (SCALEs), to identify genomic regions that, given increased copy number, may lead to aminoglycoside resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa at the genome scale. We report the result of selections on highly representative genomic libraries for three different aminoglycoside antibiotics (amikacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin). At the genome-scale, we show significant (p<0.05) overlap in genes identified for each aminoglycoside evaluated. Among the genomic segments identified, we confirmed increased resistance associated with an increased copy number of several genomic regions, including the ORF of PA5471, recently implicated in MexXY efflux pump related aminoglycoside resistance, PA4943-PA4946 (encoding a probable GTP-binding protein, a predicted host factor I protein, a delta 2-isopentenylpyrophosphate transferase, and DNA mismatch repair protein mutL), PA0960-PA0963 (encoding hypothetical proteins, a probable cold shock protein, a probable DNA-binding stress protein, and aspartyl-tRNA synthetase), a segment of PA4967 (encoding a topoisomerase IV subunit B), as well as a chimeric clone containing two inserts including the ORFs PA0547 and PA2326 (encoding a probable transcriptional regulator and a probable hypothetical protein, respectively).The studies reported here demonstrate the application of new a genomic method, SCALEs, which can be used to improve understanding of the evolution of antibiotic resistance in P. aeruginosa. In our demonstration studies, we identified a significant number of genomic regions that increased resistance to multiple aminoglycosides. We identified genetic regions that include open reading frames that encode for products from many functional categories, including genes related to O-antigen synthesis, DNA repair, and transcriptional and translational processes."
https://openalex.org/W2062610371,"Sharp waves (SPWs) are irregular waves that originate in field CA3 and spread throughout the hippocampus when animals are alert but immobile or as a component of the sleep EEG. The work described here used rat hippocampal slices to investigate the factors that initiate SPWs and govern their frequency. Acute transection of the mossy fibers reduced the amplitude but not the frequency of SPWs, suggesting that activity in the dentate gyrus may enhance, but is not essential for, the CA3 waves. However, selective destruction of the granule cells and mossy fibers by in vivo colchicine injections profoundly depressed SPW frequency. Reducing mossy fiber release with an mGluR2 receptor agonist or enhancing it with forskolin respectively depressed or increased the incidence of SPWs. Collectively, these results indicate that SPWs can be triggered by constitutive release from the mossy fibers. The waves were not followed by large after-hyperpolarizing potentials and their frequency was not strongly affected by blockers of various slow potassium channels. Antagonists of GABA-B mediated IPSCs also had little effect on incidence. It appears from these results that the spacing of SPWs is not dictated by slow potentials. However, modeling work suggests that the frequency and variance of large mEPSCs from the mossy boutons can account for the temporal distribution of the waves. Together, these results indicate that constitutive release from the mossy fiber terminal boutons regulates the incidence of SPWs and their contribution to information processing in hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W2092524492,"The pinewood nematode (PWN), Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, is a mycophagous and phytophagous pathogen responsible for the current widespread epidemic of the pine wilt disease, which has become a major threat to pine forests throughout the world. Despite the availability of several preventive trunk-injection agents, no therapeutic trunk-injection agent for eradication of PWN currently exists. In the characterization of basic physiological properties of B. xylophilus YB-1 isolates, we established a high-throughput screening (HTS) method that identifies potential hits within approximately 7 h. Using this HTS method, we screened 206 compounds with known activities, mostly antifungal, for antinematodal activities and identified HWY-4213 (1-n-undecyl-2-[2-fluorphenyl] methyl-3,4-dihydro-6,7-dimethoxy-isoquinolinium chloride), a highly water-soluble protoberberine derivative, as a potent nematicidal and antifungal agent. When tested on 4 year-old pinewood seedlings that were infected with YB-1 isolates, HWY-4213 exhibited a potent therapeutic nematicidal activity. Further tests of screening 39 Caenorhabditis elegans mutants deficient in channel proteins and B. xylophilus sensitivity to Ca2+ channel blockers suggested that HWY-4213 targets the calcium channel proteins. Our study marks a technical breakthrough by developing a novel HTS method that leads to the discovery HWY-4213 as a dual-acting antinematodal and antifungal compound."
https://openalex.org/W1990521836,"Homo-oligomeric proteins fulfill numerous functions in all cells. The ability to co-express subunits of these proteins that preferentially self-assemble without cross-oligomerizing provides for controlled experiments to analyze the function of mutant homo-oligomers in vivo. Hsp90 is a dimeric chaperone involved in the maturation of many kinases and steroid hormone receptors. We observed that co-expression of different Hsp90 subunits in Saccharomyces cerevisiae caused unpredictable synthetic growth defects due to cross-dimerization. We engineered superstabilized Hsp90 dimers that resisted cross-dimerization with endogenous Hsp90 and alleviated the synthetic growth defect. Superstabilized Hsp90 dimers supported robust growth of S. cerevisiae, indicating that dissociation of Hsp90 dimers could be hindered without compromising essential function. We utilized superstabilized dimers to analyze the activity of ATPase mutant homodimers in a temperature-sensitive yeast background where elevated temperature inactivated all other Hsp90 species. We found that ATP binding and hydrolysis by Hsp90 are both required for the efficient maturation of glucocorticoid receptor and v-Src, confirming the critical role of ATP hydrolysis in the maturation of steroid hormone receptors and kinases in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2016757701,"Glycerolipids are structural components for membranes and serve in energy storage. We describe here the use of a photodynamic selection technique to generate a population of Chinese hamster ovary cells that display a global deficiency in glycerolipid biosynthesis. One isolate from this population, GroD1, displayed a profound reduction in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and triglycerides but presented high levels of phosphatidic acid and normal levels of phosphatidylinositol synthesis. This was accompanied by a reduction in phosphatidate phosphatase 1 (PAP1) activity. Expression cloning and sequencing of the cDNA obtained from GroD1 revealed a point mutation, Gly-189 → Glu, in glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), a glycolytic enzyme involved in an inherited disorder that results in anemia and neuromuscular symptoms in humans. GPI activity was reduced by 87% in GroD1. No significant differences were found in DNA synthesis, protein synthesis, and ATP levels, whereas glycerol 3-phosphate levels were increased in the mutant. Expression of wild-type hamster GPI restored GPI activity, glycerolipid biosynthesis, and PAP1 activity in GroD1. Two additional, independently isolated GPI-deficient mutants displayed similar phenotypes with respect to PAP1 activity and glycerolipid biosynthesis.

The production of glycerolipids, including glycerophospholipids and triacylglycerols, is important for the supply of structural components for membrane production and the storage of excess calories in animal cells. This process must be regulated to adjust to the demands of the cell and the environmental conditions. For example, dividing cells require a constant supply of glycerophospholipids for membrane production, whereas diets rich in carbohydrates result in increased production of fatty acids, which are stored as triglycerides. Dysregulation of glycerolipid biosynthesis results in a number of pathologies, including diabetes and obesity (1Mittra S. Bansal V.S. Bhatnagar P.K. Drug Discov. Today. 2008; 13: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 2Cheung O. Sanyal A.J. Semin. Liver Dis. 2008; 28: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Metabolic syndromes have become a prominent health issue in the United States as well as in other developed countries (3Ford E.S. Giles W.H. Dietz W.H. JAMA. 2002; 287: 356-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (5684) Google Scholar, 4Grundy S.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2008; 28: 629-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which glycerolipid biosynthesis is regulated is still not well defined. This is due, in part, to the fact that, until recently, few of the biosynthetic enzymes had been purified to homogeneity and many of the genes that code for these proteins had yet to be identified. Besides the enzymes directly involved in assembling glycerolipids, there are undoubtedly many genes and gene products involved in controlling glycerolipid biosynthesis. Forward genetics (mutant isolation) is used to identify genes required for a certain phenotype. This way, one can identify factors important for that phenotype, which may not have been predicted given the existing knowledge about the biochemistry in that area. A number of animal cell mutants have been isolated using screening or selection techniques that target cell lines deficient in the synthesis of specific phospholipid species such as phosphatidylcholine (PC), 2The abbreviations used are: PCphosphatidylcholineP121-O-[12-(1′pyrene)]dodecanoic acidCHOChinese hamster ovaryPAP1phosphatidate phosphatase 1GPIglucose-6-phosphate isomerasePEphosphatidylethanolaminePIphosphatidylinositolTGtriglycerideSMsphingomyelinCLcardiolipinPGphosphatidylglycerolDAGdiacylglycerol32Pi[32P]orthophosphateG3Pglycerol 3-phosphatePAphosphatidateMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide. sphingomyelin (SM), or phosphatidylserine (5Esko J.D.

Using a photodynamic selection technique we have generated a population of CHO cells that display a decreased ability to incorporate fatty acids into complex lipids. Isolates from this population displayed a reduction in glycerolipid biosynthesis accompanied by a reduction in a phosphatidate phosphatase activity (PAP1, sn-3-phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.4). However, expression cloning and sequencing revealed the primary defect to be a point mutation in glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI, d-glucose-6-phosphate aldoseketose isomerase, EC 5.3.1.9), a glycolytic enzyme with moonlighting cytokine functions (9Watanabe H. Takehana K. Date M. Shinozaki T. Raz A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2960-2963PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in GPI are the second most frequent cause of inherited glycolytic erythroenzymopathy in humans (10Kugler W. Lakomek M. Baillieres Best Pract. Res. Clin. Haematol. 2000; 13: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by a non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia of variable severity, which can present with neurological dysfunctions (10Kugler W. Lakomek M. Baillieres Best Pract. Res. Clin. Haematol. 2000; 13: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our findings presented here reveal an unexpected relationship between GPI and PAP1. They may also yield insight into the nature of communication between carbohydrate metabolism and glycerolipid biosynthesis and may help explain the neurological dysfunctions associated with the human GPI disorders. 1-O-[12-(1′-Pyrene)]dodecanoic acid (P12) was obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). All radioactive compounds were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Silica gel 60 TLC plates (EMD Biosciences), Ham's F-12 medium (Cellgro), fetal bovine serum (HyClone), and tissue culture dishes (Corning) were obtained from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). All other reagents, unless otherwise specified, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm glutamine, penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (75 units/ml). This growth medium is designated “F12c” throughout the text. Cells were cultured at 33 °C or 40 °C at 5% CO2. The initial parent cell line, ZR-82, is a peroxisome/plasmalogen-deficient strain derived from the CHO-K1 cell line (11Zoeller R.A. Raetz C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1986; 83: 5170-5174Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Other parent cell lines, used to confirm our initial findings, were ZR-87, another CHO-K1 derived peroxisome/plasmalogen-deficient strain (11Zoeller R.A. Raetz C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1986; 83: 5170-5174Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and wild-type CHO-K1. Cells were plated into 100-mm diameter tissue culture dishes at 5 × 105 cells/dish and allowed to attach overnight. The cells were exposed to 200 μg/ml ethylmethane sulfonate for 20 h at 37 °C, the ethylmethane sulfonate-containing medium was removed, and the cells were allowed to grow to confluence at 33 °C (the permissive temperature) to allow establishment of phenotypes prior to selection. Mutagenized cells (107 cells total) were plated into 100-mm diameter tissue culture dishes (106 cells/dish) and allowed to attach overnight at 33 °C. The following day, the cells were shifted to 40 °C. After 2 h at 40 °C, medium containing P12 was added to a final concentration of 5 μm. After 3 h at 40 °C, medium was removed, regular growth medium was added, and the cells were incubated for another hour at 40 °C to remove any P12 fatty acid not assimilated into complex lipids. The cells were then suspended on a 1.5-mm-thick glass plate over a long wavelength (>300 nm) UV source (Black-Ray UV lamp, Model XX-15L, UVP, Inc., San Gabriel, CA) and irradiated from underneath. The distance from the UV source and the duration of the UV irradiation was predetermined to result in >95% cell death. The dishes were then returned to 33 °C to allow growth of the survivors. The surviving cells were pooled and subjected to the same selection process twice more. In the third round of selection, the majority of the cells survived. In all cases, the cells were grown at 33 °C, and the selections were performed at 40 °C. Clonal isolates were generated from the surviving population using limiting dilution at 33 °C. Each isolate was tested for phospholipid biosynthesis as described below. For phospholipid biosynthesis, short term labeling with 32Pi was used. Cells were plated into sterile glass scintillation vials (2.5 × 105 cells/vial) and allowed to attach overnight at 33 °C. The next day, some vials were placed at 40 °C for 2 h while others were left at 33 °C. An aliquot of medium containing 32Pi (25 μCi/ml or 50 μCi/ml) was added, and cells were incubated for 3 h at the appropriate temperature. Medium was removed, and lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (12Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41814) Google Scholar) in the presence of 300 μg of carrier lipid (total bovine heart extract). An aliquot was taken to determine total chloroform-soluble radioactivity. Phospholipids were separated by two-dimensional TLC using Silica Gel 60 plates, developing in the first dimension with chloroform:methanol:29% ammonium hydroxide (60:30:5, v/v) followed by development in the second dimension using chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:H2O (50:30:6:1, v/v). The labeled species were localized by autoradiography, the labeled bands were scraped into scintillation vials, and radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Identification of the labeled species was determined by co-migration with authentic standards. Parallel, unlabeled vials were used for protein determination. For phospholipid composition, steady-state labeling with 32Pi was used (13James P.F. Lake A.C. Hajra A.K. Larkins L.K. Robinson M. Buchanan F.G. Zoeller R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23540-23546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cells were plated into sterile glass scintillation vials (2.5 × 104 cells/vial) at 33 °C and allowed to attach overnight. An aliquot of medium containing 32Pi was then added to achieve a final concentration of 4 μCi/ml. Cells were incubated for 96 h at 33 °C prior to analysis as described above. Cells were labeled with 32Pi (5 μCi/ml) for 4 days (several generations) to uniformly label the phospholipids. Cells were then harvested and plated into unlabeled medium in 6-well dishes at 2 × 105 cells/well. At various times, medium was removed, the cell monolayer was washed once with 3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and phospholipids were extracted into 2 ml of methanol containing 300 μg of carrier lipid. After recovery using the method of Bligh & Dyer (12Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41814) Google Scholar), samples were blown to dryness, resuspended in 1 ml of chloroform, and an aliquot was taken for determination of total phospholipid label using liquid scintillation spectrometry. The individual phospholipids were isolated, and radioactivity was quantitated as described above. Cells were plated into sterile glass scintillation vials (2.5 × 105 cells/vial) and allowed to attach overnight at 33 °C. The next day, vials were shifted to 40 °C for 2 h. An aliquot of medium containing [9,10-3H]oleic acid or [9,10-3H]palmitic acid was added to achieve a final concentration of 2 μm at 2 μCi/ml, and the cells were incubated for 3 h at 40 °C. Labeling medium was removed, and the cell monolayer was incubated for 30 min in F12c medium prior to extraction of cellular lipids as described above. Labeled lipids were separated using single dimension TLC on Silica Gel 60 plates using hexane:ethyl ether:acetic acid (70:30:1; v/v) as the development system. The plates were sprayed with EN3HANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) prior to exposure to x-ray film at −80 °C to localize labeled species. Identification of labeled species was determined by co-migration with authentic standards. Labeled bands were scraped into scintillation vials, and radioactivity was quantified as described above. Parallel, unlabeled vials were used for protein determinations. Cells were plated into 100-mm diameter tissue culture dishes at 106 cells/dish and allowed to attach overnight at 33 °C. The next morning, the medium was changed to F12c containing 100 μm oleic acid, and cells were grown at 33 °C for 48 h after which they were harvested with trypsin and resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. An aliquot of 50 μl was used for protein determination, and 0.75 ml of this cell suspension was transferred to a glass tube containing 3 ml of methanol: chloroform (2:1, v/v). Lipids were extracted and separated on a Silica Gel G plates using the same single dimension system describe for fatty acid labeling. Plates were charred on a hot plate after spraying the plate with 50% sulfuric acid. Charred plates were scanned, and the densities of the bands of interest were determined using the National Institutes of Health ImageJ program. 3W. S. Rasband (1997–2008) ImageJ, rsb.info.nih.go/ij/, National Institutes of Health. Quantitation was performed by comparison to a standard curve for each neutral lipid class, run in adjacent lanes on the same TLC plate. Cells were plated in 60-mm diameter tissue culture dishes at 105 cells/dish and allowed to attach overnight at 33 °C. The next day, dishes were transferred to 33 °C or 40 °C and allowed to grow. Cells were harvested each day with trypsin and counted using a hemocytometer. Cell growth was also visualized by staining cell colonies grown on tissue culture plates with 0.5% Coomassie Blue in methanol:water:acetic acid (45:45:10, v/v) for 1 h, followed by three washes with methanol:water:acetic acid (45:45:10, v/v). DNA and protein synthesis was determined by measuring the incorporation of [methyl-3H]thymidine and [35S]methionine, respectively, into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material. Cells were plated into 24-well dishes (2 × 104 cells/well) and allowed to attach overnight at 33 °C. One dish was shifted the next morning to 40 °C 3 h prior to the labeling. [methyl-3H]Thymidine or [35S]methionine was added to yield final radioactive concentrations of 2.5 μCi/ml and 1 μCi/ml, respectively. After 2 h at either 33 °C or 40 °C medium was removed, and 0.5 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid was added to each well. The cell monolayers were washed 5 times with 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid and twice using ice-cold ether:ethanol (1:3, v/v). After drying, cellular material was solubilized in 0.3 ml of 0.5 n NaOH and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Aliquots were counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry following neutralization with HCl. Cellular ATP levels were measured using the ENLITEN® luciferase bioluminescent kit assay (Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's protocol. ATP was extracted in 0.5% trichloroacetic acid, and bioluminescence was measured in a TD 20/20 single tube luminometer (Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA). Glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) was extracted in 0.75 ml of 0.1 n NaOH from confluent 100-mm diameter tissue culture dishes. The alkaline extracts were heated for 45 min at 80 °C to selectively destroy NADH, then neutralized with 0.2 n HCl in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8). G3P levels were measured spectrophotometrically by following the reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) (15Larsson K. Ansell R. Eriksson P. Adler L. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) at 536 nm, in the presence of 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 9), 4 mm NAD+, 0.25 mm MTT, 0.25 mm phenazine methosulfate and 10 units/ml glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Cells were grown at 33 °C prior to harvest without exposure to 40 °C. Cell monolayers were washed twice using Tris-buffered saline and then scraped into Tris-buffered saline using a rubber policeman. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in ice-cold homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and disrupted by sonication, using a Branson cell disrupter (Branson Sonifier Co.), with two 10-s bursts at a power setting of 30% using a microtip. The sonicated cell suspension was centrifuged for 30 min at 13,000 × g. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged for 90 min at 100,000 × g to pellet membranes and membrane-associated proteins. The supernatant (“soluble fraction”) was collected, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.5 m NaCl in homogenization buffer and centrifuged again for 90 min at 100,000 × g to extract any remnants of soluble, membrane-associated proteins from the membranes. The final pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer (“membrane fraction”). All fractions were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C prior to assay. [32P] PA was synthesized enzymatically, using diacylglycerol kinase, diolein, and [γ-32P]ATP as described previously (16Carman G.M. Lin Y.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with the exception that TLC purification was omitted for some PAP assays after observing no significant difference in PAP activity compared with the non-TLC-purified substrate. PAP activity was measured by following the release of water-soluble 32Pi from chloroform-soluble [32P]PA for 20 min at 37 °C. The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-maleate buffer (pH 7.0), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm [32P]PA (10,000 cpm/nmol), 0.5 mm Triton X-100, and cellular protein (0.1 mg) in a total volume of 0.1 ml. Mg2+-dependent PAP activity (PAP1) represents the difference in activity obtained with or without the addition of 5 mm EDTA to the assay mixture. All enzyme assays were conducted in triplicate and were linear with time and protein concentration. A retroviral cDNA library from human substantia nigra (ViraPort®, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to infect a GroD1 population. 10 separate pools of 106 cells were infected at a 1:5 (virus:cell) ratio to optimize chances of single gene insertion. After 2 days at 33 °C cells were shifted to 40 °C to obtain temperature-resistant colonies. Genomic DNA was isolated from temperature-resistant clones using the Genomic tip 100/G kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and human cDNA inserts were amplified by PCR using primers against the flanking regions of the cDNA insert in the vector. PCR amplification of genomic DNA was performed by cycling 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 64 °C, and 4 min at 72 °C for 40 cycles. Primers were as follows: 5′ Retro, 5′-GGC TGC CGA CCC CGG GGG TGG-3′; 3′pBF, 5′-CGA ACC CCA GAG TCC CGC TCA-3′. PCR products were purified using the QIAquick Spin® kit (Qiagen) and sequenced at Tufts University Core Facility (Boston, MA). GPI activity was measured at room temperature in whole cell homogenates, as described previously (17Gracy R.W. Tilley B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 41: 392-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) by monitoring the production of NADPH from fructose 6-phosphate at 340 nm. Thermal inactivation of the residual GPI activity was performed similarly as described (18Maitra P.K. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 107: 759-769Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); aliquots of whole cell lysate were incubated in a 60 °C water bath for different periods of times and chilled immediately on ice, then assayed for GPI activity. For zymograms, a polyacrylamide native PhastagelTM (Amersham Biosciences) with a gradient of 8–25% was used to separate proteins obtained from soluble fractions of ZR-82 and GroD1, prepared as described above. The gel was stained by immersion in a GPI-specific staining solution (19Rogers T.J. O'Day K. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 92: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) for 30 min at 37 °C. The staining solution was removed by rinsing the gel with deionized water and was fixed with 7% (v/v) acetic acid. Total cellular RNA was isolated from cells with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen), and first strand synthesis of the RNA was performed with SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The cDNA coding region for GPI was amplified using the GoTag® Green master mix (Promega) and primers 5′-TCG ACC GTC CGG CTC CGT GT-3′ and 5′-TTT GGC TGG CTC GGC TGA CTT TAT TC-3′. The PCR product was purified and sequenced as described above. The entire coding region of GPI cDNA was amplified from cDNA of CHO-K1 cells using Phusion DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs Inc., Ipswich, MA) and the primers 5′-GTT GTT GAA TTC TCT CCG CTC CCG CCA TGA-3′ and 5′-GTT GTT GAA TTC TTA TTC TAT TCT GAT GTC CCG C-3′, and cloned as an EcoRI fragment into the pBABEpuro vector (20Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar) to generate pBABE(GPI)puro. Insert directionality was confirmed by PCR and sequencing using pBABE 5′ and pBABE 3′ primers (20Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar). HEK 293T cells were co-transfected, using FuGENE 6, with helper virus DNA pCL-10A1 (Imgenex, San Diego, CA) and either equal amounts of pBABE(GPI)puro or pBABEpuro. Supernatants containing retrovirus were harvested 48 h after transfection, filtered, and stored at −80 °C. Cells were infected for 3 h with virus-containing supernatant containing 10 μg/ml Polybrene. Medium was changed to F12c containing 6 μg/ml puromycin 24 h after infection. Protein determinations were performed using the BCA kit and Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce). Two-tailed Student's t tests were performed, and values of p ≤ 0.05 were considered significant differences. The ZR-82 cell line is a peroxisome/plasmalogen-deficient variant of the CHO-K1 cell line. This cell line was chosen as the parent strain due to the fact that it accumulates the fluorescent fatty acid P12 almost 3-fold compared with CHO-K1 and is hypersensitive to P12/UV treatment (21Zoeller R.A. Morand O.H. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11590-11596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ZR-82 cells were mutagenized, and a P12/UV-resistant population of cells was generated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We assumed that major deficiencies in glycerolipid biosynthesis would be lethal, similar to previously reported cell lines with severe phospholipid biosynthesis deficiencies (5Esko J.D. Raetz C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1980; 77: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To obtain conditionally lethal (temperature-sensitive) mutants, once mutagenized, the cells were grown at 33 °C (the permissive temperature). One isolate, GroD1, displayed reduced phospholipid biosynthesis; incorporation of 32Pi into phospholipids was reduced by 60% at 33 °C and reduced by 68% at 40 °C in comparison to the parent cell line (Fig. 1A). Separation of the labeled phospholipid classes by two-dimensional TLC revealed that, when compared with the parent strain, the most affected classes in GroD1 were PC and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (Fig. 1, B and C), reduced by 85 and 73%, respectively, when measured at 33 °C. The differences were more pronounced at 40 °C. Both of these species are synthesized in mammalian cells using diacylglycerol (DAG) as an intermediate (Fig. 2) (22Kennedy E.P. Weiss S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 222: 193-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The labeling of SM, which depends on PC for donation of the phosphocholine head group (6Hanada K. Hara T. Fukasawa M. Yamaji A. Umeda M. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33787-33794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 23Ullman M.D. Radin N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 1506-1512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was also severely reduced in GroD1 (Fig. 1C). In contrast, phosphatidylinositol (PI), which does not require DAG formation for its synthesis (24Agranoff B.W. Bradley R.M. Brady R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 1077-1083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not show a significant reduction over ZR-82 at 33 °C and was only reduced by 22% at 40 °C. Labeling of cardiolipin (CL) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) was also severely reduced in GroD1 compared with ZR-82. Interestingly, although there appeared to be a severe decrease in the synthesis of phospholipids in GroD1, the labeling of phosphatidic acid (PA), an intermediate for the synthesis of all glycerolipids (25Smith S.W. Weiss S.B. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 228: 915-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Carman G.M. Han G.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 694-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), was increased 80% over the parent strain.FIGURE 2Metabolic pathways in the synthesis of the major glycerolipid in animal cells. PAP1 (phosphatidic acid phosphatase 1) catalyzes the dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid supplying diacylglycerol for the synthesis of PC, PE, and TG. If not dephosphorylated, PA can be converted to CDP-diacylglycerol, which is a precursor of phosphatidylinositol. CDP-eth, CDP-ethanolamine; CDP-cho, CDP-choline; CDP-DAG, CDP-diacylglycerol; and Ino, inositol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Labeling of cellular lipids with either [9,10-3H]oleate or [9,10-3H]palmitate was consistent with a decrease in glycerolipid biosynthesis (Fig. 3A). Oleate labeling of the phospholipids was reduced by 55% in GroD1, whereas palmitate labeling was reduced by only 25%. This decrease is less severe than that obtained using 32Pi. This is likely due to the fact that fatty acids can be incorporated into pre-existing phospholipids through deacylation/reacylation reactions (27Shindou H. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 1-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). The labeling of triglycerides was dramatically reduced in GroD1 using either oleate or palmitate (∼11% of ZR-82 when using either fatty acid). In contrast to triglycerides and phospholipids, the labeling of cholesterol esters was increased in the mutant strain. To confirm the fatty acid labeling data for TG and cholesterol ester, we also measured the cellular accumulation of neutral lipids after 48 h of incubation with 100 μm oleate (Fig. 3, B and C). During this period GroD1 was able to accumulate only 20% of the TG found in ZR-82. However, the mutant cell line was capable of depositing fatty acids in the form of cholesterol esters, displaying increased levels (70% greater than ZR-82). Free cholesterol levels were not significantly different between the two strains under these conditions. We could not detect the accumulation of DAG in either cell line under t"

A major hurdle in the development of therapies targeting GPCRs is the drug candidate's nonselective actions in multiple tissues. The ability to spatially control GPCR signaling would provide a venue for developing therapies that require targeted GPCR signaling. Here, we show that the fusion of a RAMP1 co-receptor with the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), or calcitonin, transforms the RAMP1 from a co-receptor to bona fide membrane-anchored ligands (CGRP-RAMP1 and CAL-RAMP1). The CAL-RAMP1 selectively activates the calcitonin receptor (CR), whereas, the CGRP-RAMP1 activates both the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and CR. Unlike a free peptide, which moves freely in the extracellular space and differentiates targets based on molecular affinity, the anchored CGRP-RAMP1 and CAL-RAMP1 ligands confine their activities to individual cells. In addition, our study showed that a CGRP8-37-RAMP1 chimera, but not RAMP1, functions as an antagonist for CGRP-RAMP1-mediated signaling, suggesting that the activation of CLR by CGRP-RAMP1 shares similar molecular mechanisms with the CGRP-mediated activation of CLR/RAMP1 receptor complexes. Taken together, our finding thus provides a novel class of ligands that activate CR and CLR exclusively in an autocrine manner and a proof-of-concept demonstration for future development of targeted therapies aimed at these receptors in specific cell populations."
