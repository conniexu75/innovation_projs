https://openalex.org/W1966206179,"Oxygen consumption, heart rate, skin resistance, and electroenceph-alograph measurements were recorded before, during, and after subjects practiced a technique called transcendental meditation. There were significant changes between the control period and the meditation period in all measurements. During meditation, oxygen consumption and heart rate decreased, skin resistance increased, and the electroencephalogram showed specific changes in certain frequencies. These results seem to distinguish the state produced by transcendental meditation from commonly encountered states of consciousness and suggest that it may have practical applications."
https://openalex.org/W1995887996,"A behavioral reflex mediated by identified motor neurons in the abdominal ganglion of Aplysia undergoes two simple forms of short-term modification. When the gill-withdrawal reflex was repeatedly evoked by a tactile stimulus to the siphon or mantle shelf, the amplitude of the response showed marked decrement (habituation). After a period of rest the response showed spontaneous recovery. The amplitude of a habituated response was facilitated by the presentation of a strong tactile stimulus to another part of the animal (dishabituation). Many characteristics of habituation and dishabituation in Aplysia are similar to those in vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2052164288,"Natural selection, operating on phenotypic expressions of the genetic material, is generally held to be of fundamental importance in evolution. Natural selection includes environmental selection, by which is meant here the selection of particular correlated phenotypic-genotypic changes or adaptations that confer better survival, including competitive advantages of the genotype, in a new or changing environment. However, the behavioral characteristics of many, if not most, mammals operate to reduce exposure to new or changing habitats. For example, most mammals are reluctant to go beyond the limits of familiar territory-their home range-and generally must be forced to do so. In addition, socially dominant animals usually occupy and hold the most desirable portions of the habitat and are the most successful breeders. In turn, their offspring tend to be dominant. Moreover, mammals generally occupy the habitat for which they are best adapted, and a given species may occupy similar, if not identical, habitats for many millennia. Therefore, if animals occupy a specific habitat and move with it as the habitat shifts with time and climatic change, how can they be subjected to the selective force of environmental changes, and by which mechanisms does mammalian evolution occur? Mammalian evolution might be expected to be conservative and limited to a rate characteristic of the entire ecosystem. However, mammalian evolution has been explosive with respect to rate and diversity. I suggest that the conservative influence of social dominance is more than offset by other consequences of hierarchical behavior, and that social behavior is a major force in the evolution"
https://openalex.org/W1986839225,"The tension output of single motor units in the cat triceps surae muscle was studied during patterned stimulation of the innervating motoneurons. With repetitive stimulation within a rather narrow frequency range, the tension output of slow-twitch (type S) motor units may be quite sensitive to the pattern of stimulus intervals in the train. The presence of only one stimulus interval that is much shorter than the others in the train can cause marked, long-lasting tension enhancement, provided that the stimulus repetition rate in the basic train is within certain limits."

https://openalex.org/W2079587963,"The maturation of swimming behavior and the evoked cortical response to sciatic stimulation were studied in newborn rats receiving thyroxine or cortisol. Compared to that of controls the maturation of swimming is accelerated or delayed 2 to 3 days by thyroxine or cortisol treatment, respectively, and this corresponds to ontogenetic shifts in the characteristics of the evoked potential. Front leg movement during swimming normally diminishes at about 16 days of age and is inhibited by day 22. Thyroxine also advances and cortisol delays the age at which this inhibitory mechanism becomes evident, and compresses (thyroxine) or expands (cortisol) the time interval over which it becomes functional. During early postnatal life certain circuilating hormones can affect the rate and chronology of central nervous system maturation. Swimming behavior may be a simple model to use in studies concerned with factors affecting the functional and behavioral development of the central nervouts system."

https://openalex.org/W2112652304,"Abstract Estradiol stimulates the differentiation of tubular glands in the magnum portion of the chick oviduct. These glands synthesize egg white proteins, predominantly ovalbumin. When chicks are given estradiol daily for 10 days (primary stimulation) and are then withdrawn from hormonal treatment, there is a decrease in oviduct size, a decrease in protein concentration, and a reduction in protein and RNA synthesis. If estradiol or progesterone are administered again (secondary stimulation), protein and RNA synthesis are re-established within 12 to 24 hours. During this time, the rate of ovalbumin synthesis increases several hundred fold, without dependence on cell proliferation. Although the biochemical responses observed during secondary stimulation are similar with both estradiol and progesterone during the first 18 hours, at later times the rate of protein synthesis continues to rise with estradiol but not with progesterone. Biochemical and ultrastructural studies indicate that the increased rate of protein synthesis during secondary stimulation is associated with an organization of ribosomes into polysomes within gland cells. During the early stages of secondary stimulation the polysomes are assembled predominantly from pre-existing single ribosomes. Later, newly synthesized ribosomes enter the polysomes. Both new and old ribosomes seem to be in the same pool."

https://openalex.org/W2064072791,"A relation between enzyme induction in embryonic cells and cellular organization is indicated by the finding that the levels of glutamine synthetase induced by hydrocortisone in the embryonic neural retina in vitro are dependent on the associations between the retina cells. Intact retina tissue, aggregates of dissociated cells, and cells in monolayer culture showed a decreasing response, in this order, to glutamine synthetase induction. With time of culture, the enzyme activity continued to rise in the intact retina and in cell aggregates, but activity declined in monolayer cultures even though the inducer was continuously present. Dispersed cells cultured in monolayer without the inducer showed after 24 hours a loss of inducibility which could not be reversed by reaggregating such modified cells but could be prevented by maintaining the freshly dispersed cells at a low temperature."

This specificity of inhibition allows (i) the demonstration that the initial phase of amino acid incorporation dependent on RNA of tobacco mosaic virus involves an ""initiation"" reaction between ribosome and messenger RNA which requires two soluble factors, (ii) an assay facilitating purification of the initiation factors, and (iii) the demonstration that these factors are distinct from aminoacyl transfer enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W1586113154,"Abstract The arginyl transfer ribonucleic acid-protein transferase has been purified nearly 7000-fold from the supernatant fraction of rabbit liver cytoplasm by a procedure including ammonium sulfate fractionation, precipitation at pH 5.2, chromatography on carboxymethyl cellulose, and chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose. The purified preparations show one major and two minor components in polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis and 1 mg of protein catalyzes the transfer at 37° of approximately 135 nmoles of arginine per min from tRNA to the amino-terminal aspartic acid residue of bovine serum albumin. Arginine can be quantitatively transferred from tRNA to protein and is the only amino acid which participates in this reaction. A sulfhydryl compound is required and maximal rates are obtained at pH 9 with 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol or 10 mm dithiothreitol. There is also a requirement for a monovalent cation with an optimal reaction occurring at 0.2 m KCl. Transfer is completely dependent upon the presence of a suitable acceptor protein. When bovine serum albumin is used in limiting amounts, 1 molecule of arginine is transferred from tRNA for each molecule of albumin. Bovine thyroglobulin appears to accept 2 molecules of arginine per molecule. Under similar conditions other proteins were far less effective as acceptors."
https://openalex.org/W1618675595,"Abstract Administration of hydrazine to fasted rats results in a state of hypoglycemia which slowly abates over a period of several hours. Hydrazine also abolishes the increase in blood glucose normally seen after administration of hydrocortisone to fasted rats. Comparison of the concentrations of hepatic metabolites of rats treated with hydrazine with those of control rats reveals that hydrazine causes accumulations of lactate, pyruvate, citrate, malate, and oxalacetate coincident with less than normal amounts of phosphoenolpyruvate, 2- and 3-phosphoglyceric acids, and hexose monophosphates. The metabolic crossover point between oxalacetate and phosphoenolpyruvate is an indication that hydrazine in vivo inhibits the conversion of oxalacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate. Hydrazine in vitro inhibits rat liver phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase noncompetitively with respect to oxalacetate. Hydrazine also appears to inhibit renal gluconeogenesis. These data offer a possible explanation for the well-known hypoglycemic effect of hydrazine. Hydrocortisone is capable of increasing further the accumulations of malate and citrate in hydrazine-treated, fasted, adrenalectomized rats, whereas glucose depresses the accumulations of these same metabolites in normal rats treated with hydrazine. These observations are consistent with the known effects of hydrocortisone and glucose on gluconeogenesis and clearly demonstrate that these agents are capable of affecting reactions early in the over-all process of the synthesis of glucose."
https://openalex.org/W1974594194,Muscle cells that conitract spontaneously and rhythmically can be obtained from adult mouse myocardium. Contractions are observed immediately after homogenization in a solution that is ionically similar to intracellular fluid. Contraction frequency varies directly with temperature and decreases as a function of time after homogenization. At 16 degrees C rhythmic relaxation and contraction occur for about 20 minutes. Contractions are dependent on the presence of adenosine triphosphate in the homogenization medium.
https://openalex.org/W1502266075,"Controlled photooxidation inactivates supernatant glutamate aspartate transaminase through the destruction of histidyl residues only. Since previous studies have failed to show alterations in the over-all enzyme structure, the mechanism of transamination has been examined before and after photooxidation, taking advantage of the spectral changes associated with the enzyme prosthetic group, pyridoxal phosphate, after substrate or inhibitor binding. By spectrophotometric titration of the active site, photooxidized enzyme retains its ability to bind the dicarboxylic acids, glutarate, oxaloacetate, and α-ketoglutarate, to form non-covalent enzyme-substrate complexes. Binding of αmethyl aspartate was also measured spectrophotometrically. Because the interaction of the enzyme with radioactive substrate can be trapped by reduction of the enzyme-substrate complex with sodium borohydride, it is shown that aspartate in the forward reaction and α-ketoglutarate in the back reaction form the initial aldimine and ketimine complexes, respectively. The affinity for each substrate or substrate analogue is greater in the case of photooxidized enzyme under normal buffer conditions. Native enzyme exhibits relatively large changes in the dissociation constant with changes in the buffer anion concentration, while photooxidized enzyme fails to show these competitive anion effects. Photooxidized enzyme forms all of the visible enzyme substrate intermediates characteristic of the half-transamination reaction between an amino acid and its keto acid analogue, except for the semiquinoid intermediate which absorbs at 490 mµ. This inability correlates with the failure to catalyze the exchange of the α-hydrogen of the amino acid with tritium from tritiated water. From these data and from studies on the rate of the forward and back reaction with cysteine sulfinate and α-ketoglutarate, respectively, it is concluded that the primary defect after photooxidation of the active site histidine of supernatant glutamate aspartate transaminase occurs in the removal of the α-hydrogen from the aldimine Schiff's base in the forward reaction. A role of proton acceptor is proposed for the histidine residue at the active site."

A similar persisting rhythm is initiated in exponentially increasing cultures (growing in darkness at 19 degrees C) by a single ""switch-up"" in irradiance to continuous bright illumination. The results implicate an endogenous biological clock which ""gates"" the specific event of cell division in the cell developmental cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1593345987,"Abstract Steroid glucosyl-, glucuronyl-, and N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases from rabbit liver microsomes have been partially purified by detergent solubilization and ammonium sulfate precipitation. Transfer of glucose to the 17α-hydroxyl group of 17α-estradiol-3-glucuronoside has been shown in the microsomes of kidney and large intestine as well as in those of liver. The liver glucosyltransferase has a specific requirement for UDP-glucose and will transfer glucose from this nucleotide to estrone, 17α-estradiol, and 17β-estradiol. In the case of estrone and 17α-estradiol, it has been established that the transfer is to the phenolic 3-hydroxyl group. The preparation of 17α-estradiol 3-glucoside is reported."

https://openalex.org/W1512197606,"Abstract Treatment of transglutaminase with 2 moles of sodium tetrathionate results in almost complete losses in the transferase and hydrolysis activities of the enzyme toward the substrate, benzyloxycarbonyl-l-glutaminylglycine. The calcium-dependent esterase activity of transglutaminase toward p-nitrophenyl acetate is only partially lost as a result of this treatment. A change in the mechanism of calcium activation, however, is evident from the relationship of the velocities of ester hydrolysis to metal ion concentrations. The losses in the catalytic activities of transglutaminase are accompanied by a concomitant disappearance of four sulfhydryl groups in the enzyme protein. Enzyme inactivated with 35S-labeled tetrathionate showed incorporation of only small amounts of isotope, equivalent to 0.1 to 0.15 mole per mole of enzyme protein. This is in accord with evidence that the loss of the four —SH groups is the result of formation of two intramolecular disulfide bridges. Peptide mapping studies show that a single —SH group of transglutaminase previously identified as essential for all catalytic activities is not a component of the disulfide bridges formed by tetrathionate treatment. Brief incubation of the modified enzyme with dithiothreitol reduces one of these two disulfide bonds as evidenced by the recovery of two —SH groups. No restoration of enzymatic activities, however, accompanies this disulfide cleavage. Upon continued incubation with dithiothreitol, the remaining two —SH groups are recovered together with a parallel restoration of all enzymatic activities. It would appear that the catalytic changes which occur as a result of tetrathionate treatment are associated with formation of a single intramolecular disulfide bridge in the enzyme protein."
https://openalex.org/W1584572898,"Abstract Reduction of the protein—S—S—R bond in the zymogen of streptococcal proteinase leads to an enzymatically active molecule without any proteolysis being required. This conclusion is based upon experiments in which the zymogen has been reduced in very dilute solution where the rate of bimolecular autodigestion is at a minimum. Under these conditions, even in the presence of 3.5 m guanidinium chloride, the rate of activation depends upon the concentration of reducing agent and does not depend upon the protein concentration; also, the amino acid composition of the activated zymogen is indistinguishable from that of the starting material. In the more concentrated solutions that have usually been employed for autodigestion, reduced zymogen molecules can initiate the autodigestion that leads to removal of about 100 amino acid residues. The end product in that case has been shown earlier to be similar to that obtained when the conversion is accomplished by controlled proteolysis with trypsin followed by reduction of the protein—S—S—R bond. In aqueous solution, the rate of reduction of the disulfide bond in the zymogen is slow relative to the rate of its reduction in the molecule obtained after proteolysis. The slowness of reduction contributes to the stability of the zymogen in dilute solutions under mildly reducing conditions such as may exist in bacterial cultures in the early stages of growth. The rate of reduction can be accelerated in vitro by the partial unfolding of the molecule induced by the addition of guanidinium chloride. The reduced zymogen and the reduced proteolyzed zymogen possess similar specific activities. The nature of the zymogen-enzyme relationship for this enzyme of bacterial origin differs from that which has been established for the zymogens of pancreatic proteinases where proteolysis is a prerequisite for activity."
https://openalex.org/W1921202056,"Abstract The hydrolytic mechanism of an exo-β-(1 → 3)-d-glucanase was investigated. The enzyme quantitatively inverts anomeric configuration producing α-d-glucose, and will not catalyze transglucosylation reactions even at very high acceptor concentrations. The velocity of the reaction was studied as a function of the molarity of water and a linear correlation was found which implies that water is involved in the rate-limiting step of hydrolysis in a unimolecular manner. The results suggest that the enzyme catalyzes a single displacement mechanism in which the rate-limiting step occurs with a back-side nucleophilic attack by water resulting in inversion of configuration."

https://openalex.org/W1532575993,"Abstract Guinea pig thyroglobulin (19 S) shows a time-dependent dissociation into half-sized (12 S) subunits at neutral pH in 0.1 M KCl. The reaction is completely reversible between 1 and 23° and is endothermic since higher temperature favors the 19 S species. The rate and equilibrium of association have been measured by light scattering and velocity centrifugation, respectively. Increasing the salt concentration increases the rate and the equilibrium constant of association. The velocity constant of association is strongly dependent on pH, decreasing rapidly as the pH is raised from 6.4 to 8.4. The degree of dissociation of guinea pig thyroglobulin increases with decreasing iodine content."
https://openalex.org/W1573421496,"Abstract The effects of varying polarity of solvent on the hydroxyl pK and on the rates of iodination of tyrosine and monoiodotyrosine have been studied by spectrophotometric techniques. When methanol replaces water to 50% (v/v), ΔpKa for the hydroxyl group is +0.74 for tyrosine and +1.29 for monoiodotyrosine. The pKa of the hydroxyl group of each compound correlates well with the dielectric constant of the solvent. When the observed rates of iodination of the two phenolic derivatives are corrected for varying iodide and hydrogen ion concentrations in the system according to appropriate pre-equilibria, increasing concentrations of methanol decrease the rate constant of iodination of tyrosine more than that of monoiodotyrosine. The data for tyrosine again correlate well with theoretical considerations of the dielectric constant of the solvent, but the data for monoiodotyrosine do not. It is concluded that the nonpolar environment favors diiodination relative to monoiodination, which may have biological significance in the case of the nonpolar internal environment of thyroglobulin."
