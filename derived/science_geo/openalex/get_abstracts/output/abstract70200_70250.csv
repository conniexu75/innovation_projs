https://openalex.org/W2092307234,"We have found marked anatomical asymmetries between tile upper surfaces of the human right and left temporal lobes. The planum temporale (the area behind Hesch's gyrus) is larger on the left in 65 percent of brains; on the right it is larger in only 11 percent. The left planum is on the average one-third longer than the planum. This area makes up part of the temporal speech cortex, whose importance is well established on the basis of both anatomical findings in aphasic patients ans cortical stimulation at operation."

https://openalex.org/W1967363611,"Right-handed patients with surgical disconnection of the cerebral hemispheres cannot report verbal input to the left ear if different verbal stimuli have been channeled simultaneously to the right ear. With monaural stimulation, they show equal accuracy of report for the two ears. These findings highlight the dominance of the contralateral over the ipsilateral auditory projection system. Suppression of right-ear input is obtained in nonverbal tests. Dissociation between verbal and left-hand stereognostic responses indicate a right-left dichotomy for auditory experience in the disconnected hemispheres."
https://openalex.org/W2093477186,Proinsulin in nearly homogeneous form has been isolated from a preparation of porcine insulin. A molecular weight close to 9100 was calculated from the amino acid composition and from sedimentation-equilibrium studies. Through the action of trypsin this single-chain protein is transformed to desalanine insulin by cleavage of a polypeptide chain connecting the carboxy-terminus of the B chain to the amino-terminus of the A chain of insulin. The amino acid sequence of this connecting peptide was found to be Arg-Arg-Glu-Ala-Gln-Asn-Pro-Gln-Ala-Gly-Ala-Val-Glu-Leu-Gly-Gly-Gly-Leu-Gly-Gly-Leu-Gln-Ala-Leu-Ala-Leu-Glu-Gly-Pro-Pro-Gln-Lys-Arg.
https://openalex.org/W1970010434,"WE have reported that cell contact per se is not sufficient to explain the rapid and dramatic in vitro destruction of target L cells observed when they are treated with immune lymphocytes or non-immune phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated lymphocytes derived from various inbred mice1. Instead, cell contact is apparently involved in the induction of additional steps, which result in the release of a soluble toxic factor(s). The presence of the factor(s) is related to the ability of the aggressor cell to promote the destruction of target L cells. Once released, the factor has a non-specific toxic effect when tested on mammalian cells of many genotypes2. Lymphocyte-induced destruction of target cells seems to be related to the capacity of the aggressor lymphocyte to undergo enlargement and form blast cells. With these observations in mind we decided to treat lymphocytes in vitro by various techniques known to induce blast cells, and to test the culture medium for the presence of cytotoxic material."

https://openalex.org/W2018574304,Diversity of cytomembrane types is confirmed in hyphae of the fungus Pythium ultimum by electron microscopy. A transition in membrane morphology across stacks of dictyosome cisternae (from endoplasmic reticulumlike at one pole to plasma membrane-like at the opposite pole) suggests that dictyosomes of the Golgi apparatus are sites of membrane interconversion.

https://openalex.org/W1986821726,"Rat thoracic duct lymphocytes altered by trypsin in vitro do not circulate normally. At early intervals after transfusion of lymphocytes labeled with chromium-51 selective accumulation of radioactivity in the lymph nodes is abolished, while uptake in the spleen is not reduced. Later, the cells appear to ""home"" to lymph nodes and recirculate to the lymph."

https://openalex.org/W2151169315,When an observer moves his arm he shows more precise visual tracking of a target mounted on his fingertip-the eye lags behind the target less and makes fewer corrective saccades-than when he relaxes his arm and the experimenter moves it in a similar manner. Apparently the control system for eye movements can use outflow (efferent) signals in order to anticipate motion of the self-moved target.

Topical application of aspirin to the dentin promptly inhibited both steady-state discharge and response to a brief heat stimulus. When the drug was washed out, the initial excitability was restored in 15 minutes."

https://openalex.org/W2029426437,"The tropical thermocline must have existed since the ocean's depth exceeded 300 meters. The density gradient in this layer concentrated organic aggregates formed abiologically near the surface of the sea, and the low rates of diffusion across this layer permitted the accumulation of oxygen once the layer was populated by blue-green algae; thus the evolution of eukaryotes became possible within the layer. Because of rapid mixing over the shelves, the eukaryotes were restricted initially to the thermocline over deep water. The shelves could not be permanently inhabited by organisms requiring respiration until the oxygen level of the atmosphere was adequate. At this stage, the swimming Metazoa of the thermocline could adapt to a benthic environment on the shelves by developing exoskeletons."
https://openalex.org/W2026083005,Polydipsia and polyuria are pronounced in chickens of a selected strain and this diabetes insipidus is inherited. The kidneys of such birds are capable of an antidiuretic response when lysine vasopressin or arginine vasotocin is injected. Osmotic pressure and sodium concentration of the plasmas of normal and mutant chickens are identical. Chicks predicted to have diabetes insipidus on the basis of parental pedigree are polydipsic.

https://openalex.org/W1998482781,"THE mechanism of immunological tolerance is still poorly understood. Numerous model systems have been used in attempts to resolve some of the important questions concerning the fundamental role of both antigen and antibody in the establishment and maintenance of immunological tolerance to various antigens, in a variety of conditions in mammalian or avian species1–3. It has been observed recently that establishment of immunological tolerance to certain antigens, such as serum proteins, foreign erythrocytes or bacterial extracts, can be prevented by specific antiserum4–9. The suppressive effect of antibody on the induction of tolerance seems to be similar in many respects to the effect of specific antiserum on antibody formation."

Some investigators may prefer to have the original gel structure formed consequent to the action of thrombin on fibrinogen, so it should be noted that a simple charcoal adsorption procedure is highly effective in the removal of plasminogen from a variety of human and animal fibrinogens, including commercially available ones2–6."
https://openalex.org/W2020157408,"A plant with four and one with six extra A chromosomes were discovered in a hybrid swarm involving Liatris aspera and Liatris spicata. In each plant, the extra chromosomes formed trivalents with chromosomes of the normal complement. This pairing behavior indicates that of the ten chromosomes in the complement the plants are triplicate for four and six chromosomes, respectively."
