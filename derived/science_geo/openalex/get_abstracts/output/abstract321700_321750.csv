https://openalex.org/W1983822766,"Photochemical production rates and steady-state concentrations of hydroxyl radicals (.OH) were measured in sunlight-irradiated seawater. Values ranged from 110 nanomolar per hour and 12 x 10(-18) molar in coastal surface water to 10 nanomolar per hour and 1.1 x 10(-18) molar in open ocean surface water. The wavelengths responsible for this production are in the ultraviolet B region (280 to 320 nanometers) of the solar spectrum. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) appears to be the main source for .OH over most of the oceans, but in upwelling areas nitrite and nitrate photolysis may also be important. DOM in the deep sea is degraded more readily by .OH (and its daughter radicals), by a factor of 6 to 15, than is DOM in open-ocean surface water. This finding may in part bear on major discrepancies among current methods for measuring dissolved organic carbon in seawater."
https://openalex.org/W1979883063,"Sea urchin skeletal elements are composed of single crystals of calcite. Unlike their synthetic counterparts, these crystals do not have well-developed cleavage and are consequently much more resistant to fracture. This phenomenon is due in part to the presence of acidic glycoproteins occluded within the crystals. By means of x-ray diffraction with synchrotron radiation, it is shown that the presence of the protein in synthetic calcite only slightly decreases the coherence length but significantly increases the angular spread of perfect domains of the crystals. In biogenic calcite, the coherence length is 1/3 to 1/4 as much as that in synthetic calcite and the angular spread is 20 to 50 times as wide. It is proposed that the presence of macromolecules concentrated at mosaic boundaries that are oblique to cleavage planes is responsible for the change in fracture properties. These results may be important in the material sciences, because of the unusual nature of this material, namely, a composite based on the controlled intercalation of macromolecules inside single-crystal lattices."

This unequivocal terrestrial fauna from the Silurian constitutes the earliest direct record of land animals. The presence of predatory arthropods suggests that complex terrestrial ecosystems were in place by the late Silurian (414 x 10(6) years before present) and that the animal invasion of the land occurred earlier than was previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2086631537,"In contrast to interdiffusion in simple liquids, interdiffusion of polymeric chains is dominated by their intertanglement and their large size. These properties profoundly reduce both the molecular mobilities and the role of entropy in driving the mixing. The resulting diffusional processes have only recently been studied. Such studies reveal a wide spectrum of behavior ranging from accelerated interdiffusion (for strongly compatible chains) to its suppression below the critical point for phase separation. Effects that are still poorly understood include the initial disposition at interfaces of the chains' ends (through which diffusion proceeds by reptation) and the need for cooperative motion, which can strongly magnify local friction."
https://openalex.org/W1996280803,"Embryonic lethal mutations in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans were generated and screened for phenotypes that suggest regulatory functions in order to identify genes involved in the control ofearly development. In embryos homozygous for mutations in one such gene, pha-1, the pharynx fails to undergo late differentiation and morphogenesis. Early pharynx development is not affected; thus, pha-l controls the latter stages of this developmental process. All markers specific for differentiation in various pharyngeal cell types tested are affected, suggesting that pha-1 acts in an organ-specific, rather than cell type-specific, manner. The temperature-sensitive phases of both temperature sensitive mutations indicate that pha-l function is required solely during midembryogenesis, shortly before the onset of morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2037741501,"The evolution of biramous appendages in crustaceans is central to the debate on the origin of the arthropods. It is proposed that the biramous limb evolved through the basal fusion of adjacent pairs of ancestrally uniramous appendages. As a result, the existing system of homology, in which uniramous and biramous appendages are considered equivalent, may be invalid. Similarly, the homology of individual body segments between uniramians, such as insects and myriapods, and arthropod groups with biramous limbs is also called into question. Two uniramian segments, or a diplosegment, may be homologous to a single body segment in biramous groups."
