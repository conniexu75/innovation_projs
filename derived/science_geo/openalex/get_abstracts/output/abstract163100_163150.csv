https://openalex.org/W1984547206,"Multiple death signals influence mitochondria during apoptosis, yet the critical initiating event for mitochondrial dysfunction in vivo has been unclear. tBID, the caspase-activated form of a ""BH3-domain-only"" BCL-2 family member, triggers the homooligomerization of ""multidomain"" conserved proapoptotic family members BAK or BAX, resulting in the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. We find that cells lacking both Bax and Bak, but not cells lacking only one of these components, are completely resistant to tBID-induced cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Moreover, doubly deficient cells are resistant to multiple apoptotic stimuli that act through disruption of mitochondrial function: staurosporine, ultraviolet radiation, growth factor deprivation, etoposide, and the endoplasmic reticulum stress stimuli thapsigargin and tunicamycin. Thus, activation of a ""multidomain"" proapoptotic member, BAX or BAK, appears to be an essential gateway to mitochondrial dysfunction required for cell death in response to diverse stimuli."

Observations of this variability provide constraints on the timing, rates, and magnitudes of the changes in ice mass during a glacial cycle, as well as more limited information on the distribution of ice between the major ice sheets at any time. Observations of glacially induced sea level changes also provide information on the response of the mantle to surface loading on time scales of 10 3 to 10 5 years. Regional analyses indicate that the earth-response function is depth dependent as well as spatially variable. Comprehensive models of sea level change enable the migration of coastlines to be predicted during glacial cycles, including the anthropologically important period from about 60,000 to 20,000 years ago."
https://openalex.org/W1964189680,"Carbon nanotubes display either metallic or semiconducting properties. Both large, multiwalled nanotubes (MWNTs), with many concentric carbon shells, and bundles or “ropes” of aligned single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs), are complex composite conductors that incorporate many weakly coupled nanotubes that each have a different electronic structure. Here we demonstrate a simple and reliable method for selectively removing single carbon shells from MWNTs and SWNT ropes to tailor the properties of these composite nanotubes. We can remove shells of MWNTs stepwise and individually characterize the different shells. By choosing among the shells, we can convert a MWNT into either a metallic or a semiconducting conductor, as well as directly address the issue of multiple-shell transport. With SWNT ropes, similar selectivity allows us to generate entire arrays of nanoscale field-effect transistors based solely on the fraction of semiconducting SWNTs."

In pancreas, insulin is produced and secreted by specialized structures, islets of Langerhans. Diabetes, which affects 16 million people in the United States, results from abnormal function of pancreatic islets. We have generated cells expressing insulin and other pancreatic endocrine hormones from mouse ES cells. The cells self-assemble to form three-dimensional clusters similar in topology to normal pancreatic islets where pancreatic cell types are in close association with neurons. Glucose triggers insulin release from these cell clusters by mechanisms similar to those employed in vivo. When injected into diabetic mice, the insulin-producing cells undergo rapid vascularization and maintain a clustered, islet-like organization."

All three molecules (P5abc only in the absence of Mg2+) can be mechanically unfolded at equilibrium, and when kept at constant force within a critical force range, are bi-stable and hop between folded and unfolded states. We determine the force-dependent equilibrium constants for folding/unfolding these single RNA molecules and the positions of their transition states along the reaction coordinate."
https://openalex.org/W1983224287,"Metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes have been proposed to be good one-dimensional conductors. However, the finite curvature of the graphene sheet that forms the nanotubes and the broken symmetry due to the local environment may modify their electronic properties. We used low-temperature atomically resolved scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate zigzag and armchair nanotubes, both thought to be metallic. ""Metallic"" zigzag nanotubes were found to have energy gaps with magnitudes that depend inversely on the square of the tube radius, whereas isolated armchair tubes do not have energy gaps. Additionally, armchair nanotubes packed in bundles have pseudogaps, which exhibit an inverse dependence on tube radius. These observed energy gaps suggest that most ""metallic"" single-walled nanotubes are not true metals, and they have implications for our understanding of the electronic properties and potential applications of carbon nanotubes."

https://openalex.org/W2158340752,"Atherogenic low density lipoproteins are cleared from the circulation by hepatic low density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR). Two inherited forms of hypercholesterolemia result from loss of LDLR activity: autosomal dominant familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), caused by mutations in the LDLR gene, and autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH), of unknown etiology. Here we map the ARH locus to an approximately 1-centimorgan interval on chromosome 1p35 and identify six mutations in a gene encoding a putative adaptor protein (ARH). ARH contains a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain, which in other proteins binds NPXY motifs in the cytoplasmic tails of cell-surface receptors, including the LDLR. ARH appears to have a tissue-specific role in LDLR function, as it is required in liver but not in fibroblasts."

https://openalex.org/W1539332683,"Magnetotelluric exploration has shown that the middle and lower crust is anomalously conductive across most of the north-to-south width of the Tibetan plateau. The integrated conductivity (conductance) of the Tibetan crust ranges from 3000 to greater than 20,000 siemens. In contrast, stable continental regions typically exhibit conductances from 20 to 1000 siemens, averaging 100 siemens. Such pervasively high conductance suggests that partial melt and/or aqueous fluids are widespread within the Tibetan crust. In southern Tibet, the high-conductivity layer is at a depth of 15 to 20 kilometers and is probably due to partial melt and aqueous fluids in the crust. In northern Tibet, the conductive layer is at 30 to 40 kilometers and is due to partial melting. Zones of fluid may represent weaker areas that could accommodate deformation and lower crustal flow."

https://openalex.org/W2126037485,"Translocation of conventional protein kinases C (PKCs) to the plasma membrane leads to their specific association with transmembrane-4 superfamily (TM4SF; tetraspanin) proteins (CD9, CD53, CD81, CD82, and CD151), as demonstrated by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation and covalent cross-linking experiments. Although formation and maintenance of TM4SF-PKC complexes are not dependent on integrins, TM4SF proteins can act as linker molecules, recruiting PKC into proximity with specific integrins. Previous studies showed that the extracellular large loop of TM4SF proteins determines integrin associations. In contrast, specificity for PKC association probably resides within cytoplasmic tails or the first two transmembrane domains of TM4SF proteins, as seen from studies with chimeric CD9 molecules. Consistent with a TM4SF linker function, only those integrins (α3β1, α6β1, and a chimeric “X3TC5” α3 mutant) that associated strongly with tetraspanins were found in association with PKC. We propose that PKC-TM4SF-integrin structures represent a novel type of signaling complex. The simultaneous binding of TM4SF proteins to the extracellular domains of the integrin α3 subunit and to intracellular PKC helps to explain why the integrin α3 extracellular domain is needed for both intracellular PKC recruitment and PKC-dependent phosphorylation of the α3 integrin cytoplasmic tail."

https://openalex.org/W2054530726,"Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) comprise a rapidly growing group of inherited disorders in which glycosylation of glycoproteins is defective due to mutations in genes required for the assembly of lipid-linked oligosaccharides, their transfer to nascent glycoproteins (CDG-I) or the processing of protein-bound glycans (CDG-II). Previously' a defect in the GDP-fucose import into the lumen of the Golgi was identified in a person with CDG (A.C.) with a general deficiency of fucosyl residues in glycoproteins. This patient presents the clinical features of leukocyte adhesion deficiency type II (LAD II) including mental retardation, short stature, facial stigmata, and recurrent bacterial peripheral infections with persistently elevated peripheral leukocytes. Using a fucose-specific, lectin-staining procedure for detection of fucosylated glycoproteins and a retroviral cDNA library, we isolated a cDNA complementing the fucosylation defect in the patient's fibroblasts. The cDNA encodes a highly hydrophobic protein of 364 amino acids with multiple putative transmembrane domains. Restoration of GDP-fucose import activity in Golgi-enriched vesicles from the patient's fibroblasts verified the GDP-fucose transporter activity of this protein. We identified two missense mutations in the GDP-fucose transporter cDNA of patient A.C. and of two other people with LAD II. Thus complementation cloning allowed us to identify the human GDP-fucose transporter cDNA and GDP-fucose transporter deficiency as a cause for a new type of CDG. Following the recent recommendations for the nomenclature for CDG, this new type is classified as CDG-IIc (formerly LAD II)."
https://openalex.org/W2101806285,"Data taken in aircraft transects of emissions plumes from rural U.S. coal-fired power plants were used to confirm and quantify the nonlinear dependence of tropospheric ozone formation on plume NO(x) (NO plus NO(2)) concentration, which is determined by plant NO(x) emission rate and atmospheric dispersion. The ambient availability of reactive volatile organic compounds, principally biogenic isoprene, was also found to modulate ozone production rate and yield in these rural plumes. Differences of a factor of 2 or greater in plume ozone formation rates and yields as a function of NO(x) and volatile organic compound concentrations were consistently observed. These large differences suggest that consideration of power plant NO(x) emission rates and geographic locations in current and future U.S. ozone control strategies could substantially enhance the efficacy of NO(x) reductions from these sources."

These observations suggest that the direction of mantle flow rotates from convergence-parallel in the Fiji plateau to north-south beneath the Lau basin and arc-parallel beneath the Tonga arc. These results correlate with helium isotopes that map mantle flow of the Samoan plume into the Lau basin through an opening tear in the Pacific plate.

We found that migrating mesodermal cells in vivo respond to Slit as both an attractant and a repellent and that Robo receptors are required for both functions. Mesoderm cells expressing Robo receptors initially migrate away from Slit at the midline. A few hours after migration, these same cells change their behavior and require Robo to extend toward Slit-expressing muscle attachment sites.

https://openalex.org/W2035472375,"Success of mitosis depends upon the coordinated and regulated activity of many cellular factors, including kinesin motor proteins, which are required for the assembly and function of the mitotic spindle. Eg5 is a kinesin implicated in the formation of the bipolar spindle and its movement prior to and during anaphase. We have determined the crystal structure of the Eg5 motor domain with ADP-Mg bound. This structure revealed a new intramolecular binding site of the neck-linker. In other kinesins, the neck-linker has been shown to be a critical mechanical element for force generation. The neck-linker of conventional kinesin is believed to undergo an ordered-to-disordered transition as it translocates along a microtubule. The structure of Eg5 showed an ordered neck-linker conformation in a position never observed previously. The docking of the neck-linker relies upon residues conserved only in the Eg5 subfamily of kinesin motors. Based on this new information, we suggest that the neck-linker of Eg5 may undergo an ordered-to-ordered transition during force production.

Centrosome separation is dependent upon numerous proteins, including Eg5, a kinesin motor (1Heald R. Cell. 2000; 102: 399-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Eg5 slides the microtubules of the developing spindle past each other, thereby pushing the centrosomes apart (2Sharp D.J. McDonald K.L. Brown H.M. Matthies H.J. Walczak C. Vale R.D. Mitchison T.J. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 125-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). This outward force is balanced by other kinesin motors that provide an inward force (3Walczak C. Vernos I.

This compound was named monastrol because its presence causes the formation of a mono-astral spindle by inhibiting centrosome separation (5Mayer T.U. Kapoor T.M. Haggerty S.J. King R.W.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 975-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The addition of monastrol after bipolar spindle formation caused the spindle to collapse, indicating that a force is constantly required to maintain spindle integrity (6Kapoor T.M. Mayer T.U. Coughlin M.L. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 975-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). In addition to its role as a cell biological reagent, monastrol and its derivatives may be useful in the clinical setting as anti-mitotic agents.At least one Eg5 homologue has been found in every eukaryote (called BimC in Aspergillus (7Enos A.P.

These kinesins and other homologues (identified by sequence similarity) comprise the KinN2 kinesin subfamily (14Vale R.D. Fletterick R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 745-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). They share slow, plus end-directed, nonprocessive movement (15Lockhart A. Cross R.A.

Nature. 1996; 379: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Like conventional kinesin, two motor domains form a dimer via association of their stalks. However, in a KinN2 motor, two dimers interact, anti-parallel to each other, to form a rod with two motor domains at each end, a structure often referred to as “bipolar.” Both ends interact with microtubules, bundling and sliding them past each other. The activity of these proteins is restricted to the mitotic spindle and is controlled, at least in part, by phosphorylation at a conserved C-terminal region by p34cdc2 (13Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Herin P. Harper M. Kress M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 18Swain K.E. Mitchison T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4289-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar).Recently, a general mechanism used by kinesin motors to produce motility has been proposed (19Vale R.D. Milligan R.A. Science. 2000; 288: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). This model is based upon alternating cycles of weak and strong microtubule binding that are dependent upon whether ATP or ADP is bound to the protein. When ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP, the affinity for the microtubule is weakened and the motor releases. When ATP re-binds, a series of conformational changes take place which trigger the movement of a mechanical element. This positions the motor closer to the next binding site on the microtubule, where it will bind tightly, allowing a step forward to take place. Although the same general scheme appears to be utilized by all kinesin motors, different kinesins perform numerous different activities in the cell. This wide variety of functions is the result of subtle alterations within the motor domain and the placement of the motor within the ultra-structure of the protein.To better understand how Eg5 functions, we have determined the structure of its motor domain. The structure of the Eg5 motor revealed a unique conformation of the mechanical element. Unlike conventional kinesin, where the mechanical element is disordered in the ADP state, the Eg5 mechanical element is structured in a position not observed in any other kinesin. This observation may help explain how Eg5 can work in arrays to efficiently slide microtubules and why Eg5 is not a processive motor.RESULTSThe structure of Eg5 was solved by molecular replacement methods using the KAR3 motor (22Gulick A.M. Song H. Endow S.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1769-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) as a model. Details of the data collection and refinement are presented in Table I. The refined Eg5 model revealed a protein with the general features expected of a kinesin motor, with six major ϒ-sheets surrounded by six α-helices (Fig. 1A). The kinesin motor structure has been described as an arrowhead (23Kull F.J. Sablin E.P. Lau R. Fletterick R.J. Vale R.D.

Nature. 1996; 380: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) with a nucleotide binding site at the wider end of the arrowhead. In Eg5, the nucleotide binding site is occupied by Mg-ADP.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsData collectionSpace groupP21a, b, c, ϒ (°)53.08, 78.59, 94.15, 93.84Observed reflections236,822Unique reflections42,896Completeness (2.14–2.1 Å)94.9% (85%)R merge (2.14–2.1 Å)12.5 (10.3)〈I〉/ς〈I〉9.4Refinementr.m.s.d.1-ar.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. in bond length (Å)0.012r.m.s.d. in bond angle (°)0.467R cryst (%)21.78%R free (%)25.52%Water atoms3511-a r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. Open table in a new tab This structure of Eg5 is the first structure of a Kin N2 motor. However, it is the ninth structure of a motor from the kinesin superfamily. In analyzing the structure, we noticed many differences between Eg5 and other kinesin motors. Our challenge was to determine which of these features are important for Eg5 function in particular and which are important for kinesin motor function in general.Here, we present a detailed comparison of Eg5 and one kinesin motor, KHC. We chose kinesin heavy chain (KHC) because it shares 40% identity with Eg5, the highest of all the motors with structures available (Fig.1B). The comparison of divergent structures is facilitated by superimposing elements that are known to be conserved in the structures and then examining the differences this highlights in other regions. The phosphate binding region (P-loop) is conserved in all kinesin structures. Therefore, we used the P-loop region (Eg5 105–113, KHC 85–93) to align Eg5 with KHC. To more easily view the results of the comparison, Fig. 1, C—H, presents a single region of the overlapping structures at a time, with the Eg5 structure shown inpink and the KHC structure in blue.After superimposing KHC and Eg5, it becomes apparent that the core ϒ-sheets are almost identical in the two structures (Fig.1C). However, there is a region of divergence near the tip of the protein, leading to the appearance of a slight tilting and lengthening of Eg5 with respect to KHC. The recently determined structure of the Kif1A motor shares this feature with Eg5 (25Kikkawa M. Sablin E.P. Fletterick R.J. Hirokawa N. Nature. 2001; 411: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). It is believed that the tip of the kinesin arrowhead may play an important role in transient interactions with the microtubule during force production. Therefore, this structural alteration may be a factor in determining the affinity of kinesin motors for the microtubule rather than a transient change that occurs as part of the ATP hydrolysis cycle.Of the six helices that surround the core ϒ-sheets, helix α1 did not appear different in the Eg5 and KHC structures (not shown). However, there was a dramatic difference in helix α2. This helix is interrupted by a loop in all kinesins, and its function is not known. As seen in Fig. 1D, this loop is larger in Eg5 than in KHC. The size of the loop is variable among kinesin family members, but it is largest in the Kin N2 family (see Fig. 3A for a limited sequence comparison). This loop is located on the opposite face of the protein from that which binds to the microtubule and is in proximity to, but not a part of, the nucleotide binding site. One idea, which remains unsubstantiated, is that this loop may somehow regulate motor activity, perhaps by interacting with other proteins.Figure 3A speculative model illustrating how the neck-linker may be utilized differently by Eg5 motors and processive walking motors.A, the activity of two Eg5 motors (in this figure, just one head is shown at either end of Eg5) on two microtubules that are oriented in opposite directions. Potential binding sites on the microtubule are labeled in gray and the neck-linker is red. Eg5 motors with ADP bound and neck-linker perpendicular to the motor may attach weakly to the microtubule. Upon exchanging ADP for ATP, a series of conformational changes takes place that cause the neck-linker to reorient itself parallel to the motor and the microtubule; this causes the microtubules to slide toward their minus ends. Note that the neck-linker is structured in both the ADP and ATP states. B, in contrast, the model for conventional kinesin movement along microtubules requires that the neck-linker be flexible in the ADP-bound state. This flexibility is illustrated by red arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Kinesin motility is based upon nucleotide state sensing. In this way, small changes (the presence or absence of the γ-phosphate) can be transmitted to and amplified in other parts of the structure. This activity relies upon loop components of the switch I and switch II regions. When ATP binds, these loops make direct contact with the γ-phosphate of ATP and also form interactions with each other (22Gulick A.M. Song H. Endow S.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1769-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 23Kull F.J. Sablin E.P. Lau R. Fletterick R.J. Vale R.D.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16155-16165Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). These adjustments cause a cascade of secondary movements in the protein, including docking of the neck-linker mechanical element and increasing microtubule affinity. When ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP, the interactions among switch I, switch II, and the nucleotide are lost. This reverses the conformational changes that took place upon ATP binding, resulting in the release of the neck-linker and a decrease in microtubule affinity.The switch I region is found at the end of helix α3. In KHC, switch I is a short α-helix, whereas in Eg5 switch I is a loop (Fig.1E). Is this structural difference the basis for the functional differences between Eg5 and KHC? We think it is more likely that the two structures may represent two different states that all kinesin motors assume at some point during force generation. As mentioned above, the γ-phosphate acts to bring together switch I and switch II. However, both the Eg5 and KHC structures contain ADP and therefore no γ-phosphate. Therefore, switch I with ATP bound likely assumes the same conformation in all kinesins, whereas without the γ-phosphate “tether” this region is flexible. This prediction is supported by the many different positions of this region observed in other kinesin motors (22Gulick A.M. Song H. Endow S.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1769-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 23Kull F.J. Sablin E.P. Lau R. Fletterick R.J. Vale R.D.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16155-16165Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, it is also possible that the different switch I conformations may reflect real differences among kinesin family members. Additional structures and biochemical experiments should be able to answer this question in the future.In addition to nucleotide sensing by switch I, the switch II region is also critical for nucleotide sensing and force production. Switch II consists of helix α4 (often referred to as the switch II helix or the relay helix) and a loop that interacts with the nucleotide. A portion of this loop is disordered and therefore not observed in the electron density map of Eg5 and most other kinesins (22Gulick A.M. Song H. Endow S.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1769-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 23Kull F.J. Sablin E.P. Lau R. Fletterick R.J. Vale R.D.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16155-16165Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Helix α4 of Eg5 and KHC differ in two ways. In Eg5, helix α4 is one and one-half turns longer and slightly rotated with respect to helix α4 in KHC (Fig. 1F).The helix extension observed in Eg5 is formed by ordering a region of the switch II loop that is disordered in the KHC structure. A longer α4 is also seen in the structure of Kif1A but only with ADP (not the ATP analogue AMP-PCP) bound (25Kikkawa M. Sablin E.P. Fletterick R.J. Hirokawa N. Nature. 2001; 411: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In that study, the length of helix α4 was found to be dependent upon the nucleotide state. However, by looking at all of the kinesin structures available, it becomes obvious that there is not a strict correlation with helix α4 length and nucleotide state (22Gulick A.M. Song H. Endow S.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1769-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 23Kull F.J. Sablin E.P. Lau R. Fletterick R.J. Vale R.D.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16155-16165Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). As a case in point, the two molecules of Eg5 in the asymmetric unit of the current crystal structure differ in the length of the α4 helix although they are nearly identical elsewhere (not shown). Therefore, it appears as though the length of α4 may change during ATP hydrolysis but that this change requires a low energy input in the absence of microtubules. In other words, crystals may trap structural intermediates that occur within motors in the absence of microtubules. This reflects a flexibility in this region that may be required for helix α4 to adjust its position in response to ATP binding.In addition to the length of helix α4, the position of this helix is a key component in force generation. All known kinesin structures can be classified as switch II helix-up or switch II helix-down. Neck-linker docking is inhibited in the switch II helix-down position, which is believed to be reflective of the ADP-bound state. Although the position of α4 is slightly different in Eg5 and KHC, both of these structures are part of the switch II helix-down group (25Kikkawa M. Sablin E.P. Fletterick R.J. Hirokawa N. Nature. 2001; 411: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Again, we attribute the slightly different positions to trapping of these mobile elements in the crystal structures.In addition to switch I and switch II, helix α5 and its neighboring loops undergo nucleotide-dependent rearrangements. Structural changes in this region likely effect microtubule binding, because this region is an important surface for interaction between the motor and the microtubule. The differences observed between Eg5 and KHC in this area (Fig. 1G) may again indicate flexibility of this region in the ADP-bound state in the absence of microtubules. Alternatively, this region may contribute to differences in microtubule binding observed in the two proteins.Helix α6 is virtually identical in the two proteins (Fig.1H). However, the region at the end of helix α6 is very different in the two structures. In the KHC model, there is no electron density in this region, whereas in Eg5 electron density is clearly visible. (Fig. 2). This region, termed the neck-linker, is a critical mechanical component of the force production cycle of kinesins and also serves to attach the motor to the coiled-coil stalk (27Case R.B. Rice S. Hart C.L. Ly B. Vale R.D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 157-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In recent years, much attention has been paid to the neck-linker of kinesin motors. In all kinesin crystal structures except Eg5, the neck-linker is either disordered (as in KHC) or found docked to the motor, parallel to the longest motor edge (as in rat KHC). The neck-linker position directly correlates with the switch II helix position. The only exception is the Eg5 neck-linker, which adopts a position perpendicular to the long edge of the protein. The neck-linker position is not stabilized by crystal contacts but rather by a series of hydrogen bonds between the neck-linker and the ϒ1/ϒ2 lobe it docks against.Figure 2Identification and analysis of residues specifically conserved in the Eg5-family.A, sequence alignment of human Eg5 (HEg5), Xenopus Eg5 (XEg5), Drosophila Eg5 homologue (KLP61), Aspergillus Eg5 homologue (BimC), human monomeric kinesin (Kif1A), human kinesin heavy chain (KHC), Drosophila C-terminal, minus end-directed motor (Ncd), and yeast Ncd homologue (KAR3).

The neck-linker was modeled after the position observed in rat KHC and Kif1A with AMP-PCP bound (indicated by thedashed gray line).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In addition to comparing the structure of Eg5 to the structures of other kinesin motors, we were interested in understanding how specific residues may play roles in specializing the activity of the different families of motor domains. In this analysis, we identified a subset of residues conserved among the KinN2 family that was not conserved in other kinesins. A sequence alignment of selected motor domains is presented in Fig. 2A, with Kin N2-specific residues highlighted in red. These residues were mapped onto the Eg5 structure and are shown in Fig. 2B.Surprisingly, a number of the KinN2-conserved residues mapped to regions of Eg5 involved in neck-linker docking. Two residues in the neck-linker are specific to the KinN2 family, Lys-364 and Pro-365. These residues interact with residues Glu-49, and Thr-67, which are also conserved in the KinN2 family (Fig. 2C). The identification of these KinN2-conserved interactions lends more substance to the argument that the neck-linker conformation seen in Eg5 is not merely an experimental artifact but is a potential intermediate in the mechanochemical cycle.This analysis identified other residues conserved specifically in the Kin N2 family that may be important for the interaction of the neck-linker with the core of the protein in other nucleotide states. Although we do not yet have structural information on the ATP bound state of Eg5, we can model where the neck-linker will go based on information available from other kinesin structures (22Gulick A.M. Song H. Endow S.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1769-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 23Kull F.J. Sablin E.P. Lau R. Fletterick R.J. Vale R.D.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16155-16165Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In the ADP bound state, the parallel conformation of the neck-linker is precluded by the down position of the switch II helix. When ATP binds, the switch II helix moves up and the neck-linker is able to zip down the side of the motor core. This position is shown in Fig.2C. Interestingly, some of the residues on Eg5 that would need to move to allow the neck-linker to dock are specifically conserved in the KinN2 family (Val-303, Arg-327, and Thr-328). Further down the predicted pathway for the neck-linker, another group of KinN2-specific residues is encountered at the “tip” of the protein (Gly-252, Glu-253, Glu-254). These may represent the last specific contact site the neck-linker makes with the motor core in the ATP bound state. Future experiments will determine the contribution of these conserved residues located in interesting regions.DISCUSSIONThe result of this analysis was that most of the differences between Eg5 and KHC are likely the result of capturing the motors in slightly different stages of the movements that they go through during a force generation cycle. Kinesin motors are built to move and contain modules that move in a regulated and coordinated manner during force generation. Crystal structures are useful in that they capture one particular state that a motor may assume during force production. This information is valuable only in the context of understanding that other conformations did and will exist immediately before and immediately after the particular state a crystal has trapped.By comparing Eg5 to all other kinesin structures, only one feature stood out as truly unique. This was the position of the neck-linker, docked perpendicular to the motor in the presence of Mg-ADP. This conformation was not seen to be stabilized by crystal contacts and involved conserved residues. Taken together, these observations suggest that perpendicular neck-linker docking may play a role in the force generation cycle of Eg5.Although Eg5 contains a motor domain similar to that found in all other kinesins, it has evolved to perform a unique biological function. Unlike conventional kinesin, which walks along stationary microtubules, Eg5 has the job of putting microtubules into motion. A model highlighting possible differences in the mechanisms of these two types of kinesins is shown in Fig. 3. Eg5 works in arrays along the microtubule, and therefore to symbolize this, two motors are illustrated. However, for the sake of clarity, only one head is shown at either end of the Eg5 bipolar structure (Fig.3A). With ADP bound, the Eg5 neck-linker (shown inred) exits the motor core perpendicular to the long edge of the motor, as seen in the structure reported here. When microtubules are encountered, ADP release is stimulated, and ATP readily binds the empty nucleotide binding site. This causes a cascade of conformational changes that result in the “zipping” of the neck-linker down the side of the microtubule-attached motor core. Because both ends of Eg5 are interacting with microtubules, the motors themselves cannot move. Therefore, the microtubule must move as the neck-linker assumes a position parallel to the length of the motor. When ATP is hydrolyzed, the neck-linker is pushed out of the down position and the affinity of the motor for the microtubule is decreased. Because the microtubule has moved as a result of the previous ATP binding, release of the microtubule brings the motor into position for binding the next site on the microtubule.The establishment of defined positions of the neck-linker in both the ADP and the ATP bound states may allow control over the direction and efficiency of microtubule sliding. If the neck-"

We show that a short alpha helix at the tip of the flaplike domain that covers the RNA exit channel of RNAP contacts a nascent RNA stem-loop structure (hairpin) that inhibits transcription, and that this flap-tip helix is required for activity of the regulatory protein NusA. Protein-RNA cross-linking, molecular modeling, and effects of alterations in RNAP and RNA all suggest that a tripartite interaction of RNAP, NusA, and the hairpin inhibits nucleotide addition in the active site, which is located 65 angstroms away. These findings favor an allosteric model for regulation of transcript elongation."

The structure of bacteriophage HK97 capsid, Head-II, was recently solved by crystallography, revealing a catenated cross-linked topology. We have visualized its precursor, Prohead-II, by cryoelectron microscopy and modeled the conformational change by appropriately adapting Head-II. Rigid-body rotations ( approximately 40 degrees) cause switching to an entirely different set of interactions; in addition, two motifs undergo refolding. These changes stabilize the capsid by increasing the surface area buried at interfaces and bringing the cross-link-forming residues, initially approximately 40 angstroms apart, close together. The inner surface of Prohead-II is negatively charged, suggesting that the transition is triggered electrostatically by DNA packaging."

This discrepancy can be accounted for by including the pseudogap, which removes at least 90% of the spectral weight at the Fermi energy. Key to the pseudogap and to many other properties are the parallel straight Fermi surface sections, which are highly susceptible to nesting instabilities. These nesting instabilities produce nanoscale fluctuating charge/orbital modulations, which cooperate with Jahn-Teller distortions and compete with the electron itinerancy favored by double exchange."

Although DA1 receptor agonist alone decreases surface NHE3, simultaneous DA2 agonist synergistically enhances the effect of DA1. Decreased surface NHE3 antigen, caused by stimulation of NHE3 endocytosis, is dependent on intact functioning of the GTPase dynamin and involves increased binding of NHE3 to the adaptor protein AP2.

In this paper we characterize one mechanism by which DA acutely inhibits NHE3: the internalization of NHE3 secondary to PKA-mediated NHE3 phosphorylation and NHE3 endocytosis via clathrin-coated vesicles. OK cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin and were rendered quiescent postconfluence by serum removal for 48 h prior to experimentation. Transient transfections were performed with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfection efficiency was monitored by cotransfection with β-galactosidase and staining cells with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside as well as staining with anti-epitope (c-Myc) antibody (typically 80%). Mammalian expression plasmids used in this study include: 1) C-terminal c-Myc- and hexahistidine (6His)-tagged wild type opossum (NHE3/c-Myc/6H); 2) C-terminal enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-tagged NHE3 (NHE3/eGFP); 3) C-terminal c-Myc- and 6His-tagged NHE3 with two mutated serines, S560A and S613A (NHE3S560A/S613A/c-Myc/6H); 4) wild type dynamin (dynWT); 5) dominant-negative GTP binding-defective dynamin (dynK44A); 6) cyclic AMP binding-defective regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (RIImut). Agonists used include dopamine (stabilized with 1.1 mm sodium ascorbate) (Sigma), the DR1-specific agonist SKF38393 (Tocris, St. Louis, MO), the DR2-specific agonist quinpirole (Tocris), DR1-specific antagonist SCH23390 (Research Biochemicals, Natick, MA), the DR2-specific antagonist sulpiride (Tocris), 8-bromo-cAMP, and the PKA inhibitor H89. Commercial antisera include anti-c-Myc (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA) and anti-adaptin a (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). To disrupt activation of PKA by cAMP by RIImut, a 5-min pulse of 5 mm8-bromo-cAMP was given to the cells 16 h post-transfection to allow the dominant-negative RIImut to engage the native PKA-catalytic subunit. Experiments with dopamine were performed at 48 h post-transfection. These assays were performed as described previously (56Collazo R. Fan L. Hu M.C. Zhao H. Wiederkehr M.R. Moe O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31601-31608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To measure surface NHE3, OK cells were surface-labeled with biotin using a modification of the method of Gottardi after the addition of agonists (56Collazo R. Fan L. Hu M.C. Zhao H. Wiederkehr M.R. Moe O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31601-31608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 69Gottardi C.J. Dunbar L.A. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F285-F295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After rinsing in PBS/calcium/magnesium (150 mm NaCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.40, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2), cells were incubated with the arginine and lysine reactive of NHS-SS-biotin (2 mg/ml; Pierce) in buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mmtriethanolamine, pH 7.4, 2 mm CaCl2), quenched (PBS/calcium/magnesium with 100 mm glycine), and lysed in biotin-RIPA (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS). Lysates were centrifuged (109,000 × g for 25 min at 2 °C, Beckman TLX/TLA 100.3 rotor, Fullerton, CA), and protein content in the supernatant was quantified by the method of Bradford. Equal amounts of cell lysate were equilibrated with streptavidin-agarose (Pierce) at 4 °C. Beads were rinsed sequentially with solutions A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA), B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl), and C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), and biotinylated proteins were liberated by reduction incubation in 100 mm dithiothreitol, reconstituted in Laemmli's buffer, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and electrotransferred to Imobilin. NHE3 antigen was quantified by labeling with either anti-NHE3 antiserum 5683 or for experiments with exogenous c-Myc-tagged NHE3, a monoclonal anti-c-Myc was used (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Endocytosis was measured by a protocol adapted and modified from the stage-specific MesNa-resistant and avidin-protection endocytosis assays originally described by Carter and co-workers (56Collazo R. Fan L. Hu M.C. Zhao H. Wiederkehr M.R. Moe O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31601-31608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 70Carter L.L. Redelmeier T.E. Woollenweber L.A. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). OK cells were surface-labeled with NHS-SS-biotin and quenched as described above. Cells were then warmed to 37 °C in the presence of DA or vehicle to allow endocytosis to occur over 30 min. Surface biotin was then saturated with avidin (50 mg/ml PBS) and washed with biocytin (50 mg/ml PBS), or alternatively, surface biotin was cleaved with the small cell-impermeant reducing agent MesNa (50 mm in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4). The freshly endocytosed proteins bearing biotin were protected from either avidin saturation or MesNa cleavage. Cells were then solubilized in RIPA, and biotinylated proteins were retrieved and assayed for NHE3 as described above. Avidin-protected fraction measures early and late endocytosis because avidin cannot enter the constricted necks of clathrin-coated pits. TCEP-protected fraction measures late endocytosis because complete excommunication from the exterior is required to prevent TCEP access. OK cells were plated on glass coverslips and transfected with NHE3/eGFP. Cultures of transfected OK cells were maintained at 37 °C for 48 h, and fresh medium was replenished 2 h prior to the experiment. Using a fluorescence microscope, living green fluorescent cells were selected before the treatment as described previously (71Karim-Jimenez Z. Hernando N. Biber J. Murer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12896-12901Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). DA or vehicle was then added to the cell medium. After the stated period of incubation at 37 °C, the same selected cells were identified again, and the pattern of expression of the different cotransporters was compared with that before treatment. At least six experiments were performed for each condition to evaluate the results. 80% confluent OK cells were transfected with either wild type NHE3/c-Myc/6H or NHE3S560A/S613A/c-Myc/6H. 48 h post-transfection, OK cells were treated with either vehicle or DA. After washing with ice-cold PBS, cells were lysed with ice-cold RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 100 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 mg/ml leupeptin, 4 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml pepstatin). The slurry was cleared by centrifugation (109,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TLX/TLA 100.3 rotor), and the adaptin AP2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-adaptin α (1:500 dilution) and protein G-Sepharose. After washing with RIPA buffer, the antibody-antigen complex was eluted in SDS buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (w/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue), resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. NHE3 was quantified by immunoblot with anti-c-Myc. In the OK cell, DA decreases NHE3 protein in a dose-dependent (Fig.1) and time-dependent (Fig.2) fashion. Typical experiments are shown in Figs. 1 A and 2 A, and the summarized data are shown in Figs. 1 B and 2 B. The dose dependence (Fig. 1) of a decrease in surface NHE3 (half-maximal decrease at 10−5m and maximal decrease of 70% at 10−4m measured after 30 min DA) is similar to that of DA-induced inhibition of NHE3 activity described previously (33Wiederkehr M.R. Di Sole F. Fan L. Hu M.C. Collazo R. Murer H. Helmle-Kolb C. Moe O.W. Kidney Int. 2001; 59: 197-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The time dependence (Fig. 2) of decrease in surface NHE3 however is discrepant with changes in NHE3 activity. Whereas a decrease in NHE3 activity is evident after 5 min of DA (33Wiederkehr M.R. Di Sole F. Fan L. Hu M.C. Collazo R. Murer H. Helmle-Kolb C. Moe O.W. Kidney Int. 2001; 59: 197-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), a decrease in surface NHE3 is not detectable until after 20 to 30 min. There was no change in total cellular NHE3 within the experimental period (Fig. 1 A). Identical results were obtained from studying native OK NHE3 protein or with OK cells transiently expressing NHE3/c-Myc/6H (not shown).Figure 2Effect of DA on surface NHE3 in OK cells: time dependence. OK cells were rendered quiescent, and 10−5m dopamine was added for the stated period of time. Monolayers were biotinylated, and surface proteins were retrieved from the cell lysate by streptavidin precipitation.

Asterisks indicatep < 0.05 compared with control (ANOVA).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition to the biochemical biotin assay, we also examined the effect of DA on NHE3 by imaging live cells. OK cells were transiently transfected with NHE3/eGFP, and fluorescent microscopy on live transfected cells showed NHE3 to be a typical brush-border protein with the characteristic punctate staining (Fig.3). The addition of DA caused a time-dependent decrease in surface NHE3 with the appearance of a characteristic intracellular staining pattern (Fig. 3). Within the 2 h of fluorescent microscopic examination, no significant decrease in total cellular NHE3 was appreciated. This is compatible with the biochemical data presented above. The addition of vehicle served as a time control where no change in NHE3 distribution was seen (Fig. 3). Previous studies have shown synergistic roles for DA1 and DA2 receptor agonism on NHE3 activity (33Wiederkehr M.R. Di Sole F. Fan L. Hu M.C. Collazo R. Murer H. Helmle-Kolb C. Moe O.W. Kidney Int. 2001; 59: 197-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We next examined the relative roles of DA1 and DA2 receptors on surface NHE3 antigen. DA1agonist alone was effective in reducing surface NHE3, whereas DA2 alone was ineffective. The combination of DA1 and DA2 resulted in greater reduction of surface NHE3 than DA1 alone. (Fig. 4,A and B). To confirm these results further, we used subtype-specific inhibitors to try to block the effect of DA on surface NHE3 (Fig. 4, C andD). DA1 blockade abolished most of the DA-induced decrease in surface NHE3, whereas DA2 blockade had minimal effect. These findings are similar to the previously reported synergistic effect observed with the inhibition of NHE3 activity by DA1 and DA2 agonists (33Wiederkehr M.R. Di Sole F. Fan L. Hu M.C. Collazo R. Murer H. Helmle-Kolb C. Moe O.W. Kidney Int. 2001; 59: 197-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). NHE3 has been visualized in both the plasma membrane and in intracellular compartments in both native kidney tissue and culture cells (48–64). The decrease in surface NHE3 in response to DA can be caused by decreased exocytotic insertion or increased endocytotic retrieval. We quantified endocytotic rate biochemically with the MesNa protection assay. Fig. 5,A and B, shows that DA stimulated NHE3 endocytosis by 58%. When cells were kept at 4 °C to arrest trafficking, a small amount of MesNa-protected NHE3 was visible. This likely reflects incomplete cleavage of the NHS-biotin rather than endocytosis at 4 °C (Fig. 5 A). This usually represents <10% of the signal. The GTPase dynamin is required for both clathrin- and caveolin-mediated endocytosis (72Schmid S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 511-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 73Vallee R.B. Herskovits J.S. Aghajanian J.G. Burgess C.C. Shpetner H.S. CIBA Found. Symp. 1993; 176: 185-193PubMed Google Scholar). We next cotransfected the GTP binding-defective dominant-negative dynamin I (dynK44A) along with c-Myc-tagged NHE3 into OK cells and studied the effect of DA on surface NHE3 protein (Fig.6 A). Because the read-out in this assay is with the anti-c-Myc antiserum, which does not react with the native NHE3, only transfected cells were selectively studied. Whereas cells transfected with wild type dynamin (dynWT) showed normal down-regulation of surface NHE3 by DA, cells transfected with dynK44A failed to respond to DA (Fig. 6, Aand B). A key component of the clathrin-coated vesicle endocytotic pathway is the family of adaptor proteins (APs) (73Vallee R.B. Herskovits J.S. Aghajanian J.G. Burgess C.C. Shpetner H.S. CIBA Found. Symp. 1993; 176: 185-193PubMed Google Scholar, 74Robinson M.S. Hirst J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 173-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). We next examined the association of NHE3 with the adaptor protein AP2 by coimmunoprecipitation. Fig.7 A shows that DA increased the amount of NHE3 bound to total cellular AP2. In fact, the association of NHE3 to AP2 is barely detectable without DA. In sum, our data indicate that DA shifts NHE3 from the plasma membrane to endocytic vesicles via a dynamin- and AP2-dependent process.Figure 6Effect of DA on surface NHE3 : dependence on dynamin. OK cells were cotransfected with NHE3/c-Myc along with either wild type dynamin (dynWT) or K44A dominant-negative dynamin (dynK44A). DA (10−5m 30 min) was added.

Mutants of this enzyme were produced, carrying additional weak interactions found in thermostable α-amylases. It is shown that single amino acid side chain substitutions can significantly modify the melting point T m, the calorimetric enthalpyΔH cal, the cooperativity and reversibility of unfolding, the thermal inactivation rate constant, and the kinetic parameters k cat andK m. The correlation between thermal inactivation and unfolding reversibility displayed by the mutants also shows that stabilizing interactions increase the frequency of side reactions during refolding, leading to intramolecular mismatches or aggregations typical of large proteins. Although all mutations were located far from the active site, their overall trend is to decrease bothk cat and K m by rigidifying the molecule and to protect mutants against thermal inactivation. The effects of these mutations indicate that the cold-adapted α-amylase has lost a large number of weak interactions during evolution to reach the required conformational plasticity for catalysis at low temperatures, thereby producing an enzyme close to the lowest stability allowing maintenance of the native conformation.

It has been proposed that this unusual behavior is dictated by the requirement for an improved flexibility or plasticity of the protein molecule to perform catalysis at near-zero temperatures (1Feller G. d'Amico D. Gerday C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4613-4619Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Structural investigations have suggested that this is achieved by decreasing the number and strength of weak interactions stabilizing the native conformation (2Feller G. Payan F. Theys F. Qian M. Haser R. Gerday C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 3Aghajari N. Feller G. Gerday C. Haser R.

Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 564-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Accordingly, one can expect that any mutation designed to improve the stability of this fragile edifice will induce significant perturbations of the denaturation pattern, thereby giving evidence for the structural features linked to the unfolding parameters. Small globular proteins that unfold according to a pure two-state process, i.e. reversibly and without a stable intermediate between the native and the unfolded states, have allowed researchers to establish the thermodynamic stability function accounting for the Gibbs energy change associated with their denaturation over physiological and nonphysiological temperature ranges. The current availability of this thermodynamic function, mainly gained by differential scanning calorimetry, represents much more than the simple physicochemical characterization of a polymer because it offers a powerful tool for investigation of the still unexplained “second genetic code,”i.e. the driving force allowing a polypeptide to fold into a predetermined native and biologically active conformation (5Rumbley J. Hoang L. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The validity of the bell-shaped stability curve, which predicts protein unfolding at both high and subzero temperatures, has been established by the experimental demonstration of cold unfolding (6Privalov P.L. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 25: 281-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Proteins are said to be marginally stable because the positive Gibbs free energy change is only a small difference between the large enthalpic and entropic contributions in the temperature range restrained between the cold and hot melting temperatures. Basically, denaturation at high temperature is entropy-driven, because the large and positive thermal dissipative force exceeds the corresponding enthalpy change. By contrast, cold unfolding is enthalpy-driven and arises from the negative contribution of the hydration Gibbs energy of protein groups, mainly polar, at low temperatures (7Makhatadze G.I. Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein. Chem. 1995; 47: 307-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). Four parameters are usually assigned to the unfolding event recorded by differential scanning calorimetry, (i) the melting point of the unfolding transition; (ii) ΔCp, the difference in heat capacity between the native and unfolded states arising from the transfer of buried groups in the protein to water, in the random coil; (iii) ΔH cal, the calorimetric enthalpy corresponding to the total amount of heat absorbed during unfolding and recorded by the calorimeter; and (iv)ΔH eff, the effective or van't Hoff enthalpy calculated from the slope of the transition and describing the cooperativity of the unfolding reaction. In the case of a pure two-state model, ΔH cal andΔH eff are nearly identical. However, large proteins generally unfold irreversibly as a result of strong heat-induced aggregation, with large deviations from the two-state model because their multidomain structure induces a stepwise or overlapping unfolding of domains, behaving as individual calorimetric units (Fig. 1). We report here the calorimetric characterization of mutants from the cold-active α-amylase defined on the basis of its strong homology with heat-stable mesophilic α-amylases. These mutants reveal the unsuspected contribution of single amino acid substitutions to the thermodynamic parameters characteristic of large heat-stable proteins and provide new insight into the molecular adaptations of enzymes from psychrophilic organisms. Mutations in theP. haloplanktis α-amylase gene were introduced by polymerase chain reaction as described (8Feller G. le Bussy O. Houssier C. Gerday C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23836-23841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the constructions was checked on an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ALF DNA sequencer. The recombinant wild-type α-amylase and the mutant enzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli at 18 °C and purified by DEAE-agarose, Sephadex G-100, and Ultrogel AcA54 column chromatography, as described previously (9Feller G. le Bussy O. Gerday C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 1163-1165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pig pancreatic α-amylase (PPA)1 was from Roche. Measurements were performed using a MicroCal MCS-DSC instrument as detailed (1Feller G. d'Amico D. Gerday C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4613-4619Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Samples (∼3 mg/ml) were dialyzed overnight against 30 mm MOPS, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.2. Thermograms were analyzed according to a non-two-state model in whichT m, ΔH cal, andΔH eff of individual transitions are fitted independently using the MicroCal Origin software (version 2.9). The magnitude and source of the errors in the T m and enthalpy values have been discussed elsewhere (10Matouschek A. Matthews J.M. Johnson C.M. Fersht A.R. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Fitting standard errors on a series of three DSC measurements made under the same conditions in the present study were found to be ±0.05 K onT m and ±1% on both enthalpies. Thermograms generated by starch hydrolysis were recorded on a MCS isothermal titration calorimeter. The technical background for such an experiment has been described elsewhere (11Lonhienne T. Baise E. Feller G. Bouriotis V. Gerday C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1545: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Starch concentration was 2% in 50 mmHepes, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.2, and was saturating during the time course of the experiment. Reactions were initiated by injecting 10–50 µl of a 30 µg/ml enzyme solution into the same buffer. The activity decay at 45 °C was recorded continuously for 30 min, and data were fitted on a monoexponential function to determine the first order constant rate of enzyme inactivation at 45 °C, S.E. <1%. The k catvalues were determined at 25 °C using 3.5 mm4-nitrophenyl-α-d-maltoheptaoside-4,6-O-ethylidene as substrate (8Feller G. le Bussy O. Houssier C. Gerday C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23836-23841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The k cat /K mvalues for substrate hydrolysis were determined from initial rates using the following relation.k cat /K m = v 0/S0 E 0, which is valid at S0 ≪ K m for systems that obey Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The validity of this equation was ascertained by performing determinations at three substrate concentrations. The psychrophilic α-amylase from P. haloplanktis (AHA) belongs to chloride-dependent α-amylases. This group includes all known animal α-amylases and the enzymes from some Gram-negative bacteria, covering a large range of living temperatures (12D'Amico S. Gerday C. Feller G. Gene ( Amst. ). 2000; 253: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The high degree of amino acid sequence identity between chloride-dependent α-amylases allowed us to construct a multiple sequence alignment of the available primary structures (12D'Amico S. Gerday C. Feller G. Gene ( Amst. ). 2000; 253: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and to detect about 20% of 453 residues that are specific to the cold-adapted enzyme. The involvement of these residues in the weak stability of the psychrophilic α-amylase was assessed by comparison of its crystal structure (3Aghajari N. Feller G. Gerday C. Haser R. Structure. 1998; 6: 1503-1516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 4Aghajari N. Feller G. Gerday C. Haser R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 564-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) with that of PPA, the closest structural homolog, as well as with the structure of α-amylases from human salivary and pancreatic glands and from the insect Tenebrio molitor. Molecular modeling was then used to check the consistency of mutations aimed to introduce weak interactions found in mesophilic α-amylases in the heat-labile AHA. The selected mutations are listed in Table I along with the restored interactions. Following production in E. coli and purification, the stability and kinetic parameters of 14 mutant enzymes were determined (Table II). Mutants are listed according to their main properties, as discussed below. Fig. 1 depicts the microcalorimetric behavior of the recombinant wild-type AHA and of heat-stable α-amylases, including PPA taken as reference for mutation selection.Table ISelected mutations in this studyMutantsRestored interactions1-a(A) and (C) refer to the central (β/α)8 barrel and to the globular C-terminal domain, respectively.K300RAdditional H-bond in the Cl− binding site (A)N150DSalt bridge with Lys-190 (A)V196FDouble aromatic interaction with Tyr-82 and Phe-198 (A)N150D/V196FDouble mutant (A)Q164I/V196FDouble mutant (A)Q164IHydrophobic interaction in a core cluster (A)T232VHydrophobic interaction in a core cluster (A)N288VHydrophobic interaction in a core cluster (A)M379VHydrophobic interaction in a core cluster (C)R64EHelix dipole stabilization (A)L219RAmino-aromatic interaction with Tyr-298 (A)Del6Deletion of 6 nonconstrained residues at the C terminus possibly involved in unzipping (C)N12RSalt bridge with Asp-15 (A)E279WAromatic interaction with Phe-307 (A)1-a (A) and (C) refer to the central (β/α)8 barrel and to the globular C-terminal domain, respectively.

Open table in a new tab Enthalpic stabilization involves an increase of the denaturation enthalpy and of the melting point. Such stabilization of the heat-labile α-amylase is obtained when a salt bridge (N150D), polar aromatic interactions (V196F), or an additional H-bond (K300R) is introduced in the protein. Thermal unfolding of some of these mutants is illustrated in Fig. 2. These additional electrostatic interactions induce a slightly higherT m value (Table II) associated, however, with a large increase of the calorimetric enthalpy (ΔH cal). Characterization of the double mutant N150D/V196F revealed several interesting features. The effect of the mutations on the melting point is additive (Table II, Fig. 2). Moreover, both mutations affectΔH cal andΔH eff differently, whereas their cumulative effect in the double mutant leads to aΔH cal/ΔH effratio at unity, indicative of a perfect two-state unfolding pattern. Aliphatic side chains were introduced in AHA in order to reconstruct hydrophobic core clusters found in mesophilic α-amylases (Q164I, T232V, N288V, and M379V). Interestingly, each substitution results in a non-two-state unfolding of the mutant enzymes and in the appearance of two calorimetric units or domains (Fig. 3). As also shown in Fig. 3, the separation between both calorimetric units in the mutants can be improved by adjusting the experimental conditions, providing evidence for the coexistence of two protein domains of distinct stability. Deconvolution of the heat capacity function revealed that one domain always has an increasedT m compared with that of AHA (Table II), underlining the stabilization induced by the reconstituted hydrophobic cluster. By contrast, the lower T m of the first domain seems to be the consequence of strain imposed in one domain that is not compensated in other protein regions. This is supported by the combination of mutations Q164I and V196F resulting in a mutant enzyme displaying two stabilized domains, as far as T m is concerned. The mutant T232V deserves special comments. Indeed, the shape of its heat capacity function is similar to that of PPA (Fig. 3) as well as the relative contribution of each domain toΔH cal andΔH eff (Table II). Therefore, this mutant consistently reproduces the microcalorimetric unfolding pattern of the heat-stable PPA but at lower temperatures. The comparison ofΔH cal andΔH eff values allows us to analyze the unfolding cooperativity by microcalorimetry. Several mutations listed in Table II affect the unfolding cooperativity without noticeable change of ΔH cal. Thermal unfolding of mutants Del6, L219R and R64E (Fig.4) clearly illustrates the relation between ΔH eff and the steepness of the transition. Furthermore, the thermogram slope of mutants L219R and R64E is considerably decreased and approaches the profile of large and stable proteins such as Bacillus amyloliquefaciensα-amylase (BAA) (Fig. 1). In these experiments, the mutant enzymes were 100% unfolded, then allowed to refold during a cooling period of 15 min at 15 °C. Reversibility was calculated by the recovery of ΔH calduring a second scan (Table II). Substitution of a single amino acid side chain is sufficient to drastically alter this critical parameter of protein folding, as demonstrated by mutant N12R that displays only 25% renaturation. Mutants Q164I, V196F, and Q164I/V196F that are stabilized by hydrophobic groups also decrease the unfolding reversibility significantly. In the same conditions, unfolding of the heat-stable PPA and BAA is completely irreversible. Determination of inactivation rate constants usually requires the recording of the residual enzyme activity after incubation at high temperature. In the case of AHA and of its mutants, the model of Lumry and Eyring (13Lumry R. Eyring H. J. Phys. Chem. 1954; 58: 110-120Crossref Scopus (729) Google Scholar) is valid: N⇌k−1k1U→k2I(Eq. 1) where k 2 is the first order rate constant of thermal inactivation. However, the various degrees of reversibility noted for the mutants (kinetically characterized byk −1) strongly impair the validity of the results obtained by conventional methods. We have therefore devised a new method using isothermal titration calorimetry and recording activity at 45 °C as the heat released by the hydrolysis of starch glycosidic bonds. This method provides a direct and continuous monitoring of activity at the denaturing temperature (Fig.5). As a prerequisite, the same experiment was followed by fluorescence (without substrate) showing that the structural modifications accompanying a temperature shift from 15 to 45 °C are fast with a k 1 value of about 0.04 s−1. Therefore, the transition N → U is one order of magnitude faster than the transition U → I, and the disappearance of the active state N can be taken as a measure ofk 2, as reported in Table II. It is significant that 10 of 14 mutants are protected against thermal inactivation and that mutants carrying newly introduced electrostatic interactions display the lowest inactivation rate constants (Fig. 5). A plot of unfolding reversibility versus thermal inactivation (Fig.6 A) shows that these parameters for the mutant enzymes are clustered between the respective values for AHA and PPA.Figure 6Correlation of stability (A) and kinetic (B) parameters for wild-type (○) and mutant (●) α-amylases.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The kinetic parametersk cat and K m were recorded using a chromogenic maltoheptaose oligosaccharide (Table II). From these results, four main aspects should be pointed out. (i) As reported previously, AHA possesses a higher activity (k cat) than PPA in order to compensate for the slow chemical reaction rates at low temperature. (ii) The general trend of the mutations is to decrease both k cat andK m. Fig. 6 B shows that both kinetic parameters for mutants all fall within a narrow region of the plot, between the values of AHA and PPA. (iii) As a result, the mutations tend to raise the specificity constant or catalytic efficiencyk cat /K m to values close to that of PPA (Table II). (iv) Most mutations protecting the enzymes against thermal inactivation also concomitantly decrease thek cat value. The magnitude of the contribution, as recorded by microcalorimetry, of a single amino acid side chain to the stability parameters of a large protein is one of the most significant features revealed by engineering the heat-labile α-amylase. Such individual contributions are generally masked in stable proteins by the complex network of interactions involved in the native state conformation and by the fact that frequently, heat-induced unfolding of large proteins is kinetically driven as a result of pronounced irreversibility. Our results show that the selected electrostatic interactions provide the largest contribution to stability per se, by increasing both T mand ΔH cal and by protecting mutants against thermal inactivation (Table II). Thermal unfolding of the double mutant N150D/V196F follows the two-state transition model and is essentially reversible. Accordingly, its thermodynamic stability can be analyzed using the modified Gibbs-Helmholtz equation: ΔG(T)=ΔHm(1−T/Tm)+ΔCp(T−Tm)−TΔCp ln(T/Tm)(Eq. 2) This function corresponds to the energy required to disrupt the native state (14Privalov P. Creighton T. Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992: 83-126Google Scholar) and is illustrated in Fig.7. One can note that despite a modest increase of the melting point, the conformational energy of the double mutant is twice that of the wild-type AHA around 10 °C. Similarly, the contribution at 20 °C of the ion pair in N150D can be estimated to 4.4 kcal/mol, of the H-bond in K300R to 0.7 kcal/mol, and of a polar aromatic interaction in V196F (assuming two interplanar interactions) to 0.8 kcal/mol. These values are in good agreement with data obtained by ab initio calculations (15Burley S.K. Petsko G.A. Adv. Protein. Chem. 1988; 39: 125-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar) or by experimental studies (16Anderson D.E. Becktel W.J. Dahlquist F.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2403-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 17Jaenicke R. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 155-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These free energy gains originate, however, from very large enthalpic-entropic compensation effects. The denaturation enthalpy and entropy can be calculated according to the relations (18Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein. Chem. 1979; 33: 167-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar):ΔH(T)=ΔHm+ΔCp(T−Tm)(Eq. 3) ΔS(T)=ΔHm/Tm+ΔCp ln(T/Tm)(Eq. 4) For instance, the denaturation enthalpy at 20 °C for AHA is 10.5 kcal/mol, and the entropic term (TΔS) amounts to 2.2 kcal/mol. The corresponding values for mutant N150D are 60.9 and 48.2 kcal/mol, respectively. Therefore, the gain of 4.4 kcal/mol in conformational energy provided by the ion pair arises from a 6-fold increase of the denaturation enthalpy balanced by a 20-fold increase of the entropic cost. It should be added that mutant N150D restores a surface salt bridge. Although the net contribution of solvent-exposed ion pairs has been frequently questioned (19Strop P. Mayo S.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1251-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), our results demonstrate that such interactions can provide a substantial increment of conformational stability. This is especially relevant for thermophilic and hyperthermophilic proteins that are characterized by an abundance of surface ion pairs (20Cambillau C. Claverie J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32383-32386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), in some instances organized in interconnected networks (21Pappenberger G. Schurig H. Jaenicke R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 676-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 22Vetriani C. Maeder D.L. Tolliday N. Yip K.S. Stillman T.J. Britton K.L. Rice D.W. Klump H.H. Robb F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12300-12305Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). On the other hand, about 8 ion pairs, 15 arginine residues and 10 aromatic interactions are lacking in the crystal structure of AHA when compared with the heat-stable PPA (3Aghajari N. Feller G. Gerday C. Haser R. Structure. 1998; 6: 1503-1516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The disappearance of these electrostatic based features is obviously a main determinant for both the low T m and melting enthalpy of the psychrophilic α-amylase. It is generally agreed that the hydrophobic effect is the main factor in stabilizing folded conformations (23Matthews B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 139-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 and TableII, the insertion of a nonpolar group into a hydrophobic core cluster creates a stabilization center in the protein and in the peculiar case of AHA promotes the appearance of calorimetric domains. Unfortunately, large deviations from the two-state model preclude any reliable calculation for these mutants. It should be noted, however, that the increases of T m for the stabilized transition are of the same magnitude or even higher (M379V) than that provided by electrostatic interactions. Analysis of the hydrophobic clusters in AHA shows that 20 substitutions decrease the hydrophobicity index of the involved residues relative to PPA. As indicated by the calorimetric behavior of the mutations selected for this work (Fig. 3), the overall low core hydrophobicity of the heat-labile AHA accounts to a large extent for the lack of discrete unfolding intermediates. It is usually accepted that extreme cooperativity is only achieved in small molecules with tight packing of groups (14Privalov P. Creighton T. Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992: 83-126Google Scholar). This obviously is not the case for the large multidomain heat-labile α-amylase. As suggested by the mutation effects, its unfolding cooperativity arises from the very low number of interactions maintaining the native state, which therefore results in the simultaneous disruption of all structural elements and in the unusual two-state unfolding of this large protein. Considering protein adaptation to temperature, a practical implication of the flattening of the unfolding transition in thermostable α-amylases such as BAA (Fig. 1) is to maintain a higher level of native conformation at elevated temperatures. Fig. 4 shows that the same holds true between 45 and 55 °C for mutants of the heat-labile α-amylase with altered cooperativity. The relation between unfolding reversibility and thermal inactivation (Fig. 6 A) is another unsuspected result gained from the α-amylase mutant analysis. Referring to Equation 1, mutants protected against thermal inactivation are also those that refold less efficiently, mimicking the behavior of thermostable α-amylases. This could be explained by the large number of all types of weak interactions required for proper folding and stability in mesophilic and thermophilic enzymes. As a consequence, there will be more possibilities of side reactions during refolding, either by intramolecular mismatch or by aggregation due to replacement of the regular intramolecular pairing by intermolecular interactions (17Jaenicke R. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 155-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It was shown that all 24 side chains in the active site performing H-bonding to a large pseudosaccharide inhibitor in the transition state conformation are strictly conserved in both AHA and PPA crystal structures (4Aghajari N. Feller G. Gerday C. Haser R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 564-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 24Qian M. Haser R. Buisson G. Duee E. Payan F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6284-6294Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). As a consequence, changes in primary structure that occur far from the active site should be responsible for the high specific activity of AHA. As a matter of fact, all mutations in this study designed to restore a mesophilic character are located far from the catalytic center and tend to decrease bothk cat and K m (Fig.6 B). It has been convincingly argued that increases in flexibility of cold-adapted enzymes lead to a broader distribution of conformational states, translated into higher K mvalues for enzymes devoid of adaptive changes within the active site (25Holland L.Z. McFall-Ngai M. Somero G.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3207-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 26Fields P.A. Somero G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11476-11481Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In this context, rigidifying the molecule or part of the molecule by the newly engineered weak interactions in the psychrophilic α-amylase should contribute to decreased K m values by reducing the conformational entropy of the binding-competent species. The kinetic parameters of the mutants (Fig. 6 B) give experimental support to the previous hypothesis that temperature-adaptive increases in k cat occur concomitantly with increases in K m (26Fields P.A. Somero G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11476-11481Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that stability and activity are not physically linked (27Petrounia I.P. Arnold F.H. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2000; 11: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Laboratory evolution can indeed yield nonnatural catalysts that are thermostable and active either at high (28Cherry J.R. Lamsa M.H. Schneider P. Vind J. Svendsen A. Jones A. Pedersen A.H. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) or low (29Giver L. Gershenson A. Freskgard P.O. Arnold F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2000; 297: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) temperatures. Nevertheless, when the selection is only applied on low temperature activity (the relevant parameter for psychrophilic enzymes), especially by in vivo functional selection systems (allowing cell growth, for instance), the evolved enzymes generally display a concomitant reduced thermostability (31Lebbink J.H. Kaper T. Bron P. van der Oost J. de Vos W.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3656-3665Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 32Merz A. Yee M.C. Szadkowski H. Pappenberger G. Crameri A. Stemmer W.P.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1101-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It was assumed that the selective advantage for these optimized catalysts depends on a high k cat and not on maintaining stability (27Petrounia I.P. Arnold F.H. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2000; 11: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, our structure-based approach demonstrates that natural mutations occurring in the cold-active α-amylase associate high activity and low stability. The convergence of the results from both random and rational studies stresses that the lack of selective pressure for stable proteins at low temperatures does not entirely account for the instability of psychrophilic proteins. On the contrary, heat lability or conformational plasticity seems to be intimately interlaced with sustained activity in cold environments. This is possibly the easiest route taken by natural selection on the evolutionary time scale or because large fluctuations around the native state are required by the energetics of substrate binding (35Ma B. Kumar S. Tsai C.J. Nussinov R. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) and catalysis at low temperatures, an aspect that is not documented for such enzymes to date. The mutant N288V represents an extreme case. This mutant possesses a heat-labile domain with the lowestT m (Table II) but is marginally stable even at 4 °C, with a half-life of 2 h at 25 °C and requiring fast purification procedures. This behavior is consistent with the proposal that AHA has reached a state close to the lowest accessible stability of its native state and cannot be further destabilized (1Feller G. d'Amico D. Gerday C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4613-4619Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). If indeed stability is linked to activity in cold-adapted enzymes, this limitation explains the imperfect adaptation of psychrophilic enzymes,i.e. their activity at low temperatures remains lower than that of mesophiles at 37 °C. This mutational analysis of a large protein demonstrates that the psychrophilic α-amylase has lost numerous weak interactions during evolution to reach the proper conformational flexibility at low temperatures. These adaptive adjustments contribute to improve k cat without alteration of the catalytic mechanism, because the active site architecture is not modified, but at the expense of a weaker substrate binding affinity. On the other hand, thermophilic enzymes strengthen the same type of interaction to gain in structural stability at high temperatures but at the expense of poor activity at room temperature (36Varley P.G. Pain R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 37Zavodszky P. Kardos J. Svingor A. Petsko G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These aspects underline the continuum in the strategy of temperature adaptation in proteins and reinforce the concepts of “compromise” (39Somero G.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 43-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) between activity and stability leading to “corresponding states” (40Jaenicke R. Bohm G. Curr. Opin. Struct.

https://openalex.org/W2141466802,"The recent crystallographic structure of a serpin-protease complex revealed that protease inactivation results from a disruption of the catalytic site architecture caused by the displacement of the catalytic serine. We hypothesize that inhibition depends on the length of the N-terminal portion of the reactive center loop, to which the active serine is covalently attached. To test this, α1-antitrypsin Pittsburgh variants were prepared with lengthened and shortened reactive center loops. The rates of inhibition of factor Xa and of complex dissociation were measured. The addition of one residue reduced the stability of the complex more than 200,000-fold, and the addition of two residues reduced it by more than 1,000,000-fold, whereas the deletion of one or two residues lowered the efficiency of inhibition and increased the stability of the complex (2-fold). The deletion of more than two residues completely converted the serpin into a substrate. Similar results were obtained for the α1-antitrypsin variants with thrombin and for PAI-1 and PAI-2 with their common target tissue plasminogen activator. We conclude that the length of the serpin reactive center loop is critical for its mechanism of inhibition and is precisely regulated to balance the efficiency of inhibition and stability of the final complex.

Landes, Co., Austin, TX1996Google Scholar). Their relative bulk compared with the inhibitory domains of the 19 other protein families of serine protease inhibitors (3Laskowski M. Qasim M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 324-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) provides the serpins with potential regulatory sites, but it is the unique mechanism of inhibition that accounts for the evolutionary success of the serpins. Serpins inhibit proteases by subverting the proteolytic cycle after the formation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate. This is achieved by preventing hydrolysis of the ester bond between the carbonyl carbon of the reactive center P1 residue and the Oγ of the active site serine. Inhibition by serpins is best described as a suicide-substrate mechanism (4Patston P.A. Gettins P. Beechem J. Schapira M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8876-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 5Gettins P. Patston P.A. Schapira M. Hematol. Oncol. Clin. North Am. 1992; 6: 1393-1408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as shown in Scheme FS1. The kinetic model of the reaction of a serpin, I,1 with a protease, P, is identical to that of the proteolysis of a substrate. After formation of a Michaelis complex, [IP], the carbonyl carbon of the reactive center P1 residue undergoes nucleophilic attack by the catalytic serine Oγ (Ser-195). The attack proceeds through a tetrahedral transition state that requires a precise geometry of main-chain amide groups on residues 193 and 195 of the protease for continuation to the acyl-enzyme intermediate, [IP]*. At this stage, there is an ester bond between the Ser-195 Oγ and the carbonyl carbon of the P1 residue, and the peptide bond between P1 and P1′ has been broken. The serpin then undergoes a dramatic conformational change of incorporation of the entire reactive center loop as the fourth strand in β-sheet A, resulting in a 70-Å translocation of the attached protease to the opposite pole of the serpin (Fig. 1 a). The inhibited serpin-protease complex, IPcpx, is stable for weeks to years depending on the serpin-protease pair and conditions but eventually will dissociate via k 5 to yield the products of normal proteolysis, cleaved serpin, I*, and active protease, P. If loop insertion is not rapid enough to compete with deacylation, then the reaction proceeds directly to the cleaved product by a step defined by k 3. The relative rates ofk 4 and k 3 determine the stoichiometry of inhibition. Serpins have also been demonstrated to induce proteolytic susceptibility in inhibited proteases, resulting in a dead-end pathway, k 6, for the protease (6Kaslik G. Patthy A. Balint M. Graf L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 7Stavridi E.S. O'Malley K. Lukacs C.M. Moore W.T. Lambris J.D. Christianson D.W. Rubin H. Cooperman B.S.

The recent structure of a serpin-protease complex shows how inhibition results from a conformational displacement and deformation of the protease (9Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 a). The deformation is brought about by the overlap of the hyperstable serpin and the destabilized protease. A principal contribution to the loss of stability in the protease is the distortion of its active site, which is caused by the plucking of the active site serine away from its catalytic partners (Fig.1 b). This distortion of the active site disrupts the interactions in the protease that were formed to stabilize it at the stage of zymogen activation (10Huber R. Bode W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1978; 11: 114-122Crossref Scopus (608) Google Scholar). More critically, the displacement of the serine from the catalytic site of the protease effectively ensures the kinetic stability of serpin-protease complex by preventing hydrolysis of its ester bond with the serpin through destruction of the oxyanion hole (Fig. 1 b) (9Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). It is apparent from the structure of the complex that a critical factor in producing the distortion of the protease is the limited length of the fully inserted reactive center loop of the serpin. This tightness of the tethering of the ester bond and the leverage provided through the overlap of the serpin and the protease effectively “plucks” the serine from its catalytic site. Supporting evidence for the critical contribution of this tight linkage is given by the observation of a consistently conserved reactive center loop length in the inhibitory serpins. The loop in almost all the serpins is formed by 17 residues, from the glutamate (P17) at the base of the proximal hinge of the loop to the reactive center (P1) residue (11Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). This is not invariant, but no functional inhibitory serpin has more than 17 residues in the reactive center loop, and only the α2-antiplasmin (12Holmes W.E. Nelles L. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1659-1664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), C1-inhibitor (13Carter P.E. Dunbar B. Fothergill J.E. Eur. J.

The only example a serpin, natural or recombinant, with an 18-residue reactive center loop was for a variant of α2-antiplasmin, which was identified from a patient with a bleeding disorder (16Holmes W.E. Lijnen H.R. Nelles L. Kluft C. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Rijken D.C. Collen D. Science. 1987; 238: 209-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Here we assess the effect of a systematic change in loop length, N-terminal to the reactive center, on the inhibitory activity of the recombinant Pittsburgh, P1 Arg, variant of α1-antitrypsin (17Owen M.C. Brennan S.O. Lewis J.H. Carrell R.W. N. Engl. J. Med. 1983; 309: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Modified versions of the Pittsburgh α1-antitrypsin, with reactive center loop deletions of 1–4 residues and insertions of one and two residues were prepared (Fig. 2), and their ability to form stable complexes with factor Xa and thrombin were examined. PAI-1 and PAI-2 variants with an extra residue in the reactive center loop were also prepared, and complex formation with their target protease tPA was assessed. The results define the critical requirements for effective inhibition and also clearly demonstrate the way in which the deformation mechanism provides the serpins with the selective advantage of stable and irreversible inhibition. Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs, and oligonucleotides were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. The expression vector pQE31 and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid gel were from Qiagen. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was from Melford Laboratories Ltd. (Suffolk, England). Kanamycin sulfate was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Hitrap Q-Sepharose columns were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Ampicillin, bovine thrombin, and bovine factor Xa were from Sigma. Protease concentrations were determined by active site titrations. The substrates S-2222 and S-2238 were from Chromogenix. Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethylketone and the tissue plasminogen activator tPA were from Calbiochem (CN Biosciences UK, Nottingham, United Kingdom). All experiments were conducted at room temperature (22 ± 1 °C). Human α1-antitrypsin cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into the expression vector pQE31 by the restriction sites BamHI and HindIII. Mutagenesis was carried out by a two-step polymerase chain reaction. The length of the reactive center loop was altered as shown in Fig. 2. Each variant of α1-antitrypsin is denoted according to change in the reactive center loop length as Add-1 and Add-2 or Del-1, -2, -3 or -4. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The recombinant α1-antitrypsin was expressed with an MRSHHHHHH tag at the N terminus, which can bind to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose. Human wild type and Add-1, PAI-1, and PAI-2 were similarly prepared, and the expression and purification were performed as described previously (18Zhou A. Jiang X. Dou F. Zhu D. Xu X. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 930-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 19Zhou A. Faint R. Charlton P. Dafforn T.R. Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9115-9122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Recombinant α1-antitrypsin was purified from the soluble fraction of Escherichia coli lysate. Briefly, expression plasmids were transformed into SG13009 (pREP4) cells and grown in 2 liters of 2TY at 37 °C untilA 600 = 0.8–1.0; then isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a concentration of 1 mm, and the culture was transferred to 30 °C for a further 3 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer A (10 mmphosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, and 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol), and disrupted by sonication. The supernatant of the cell lysate was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (20-ml bed column), and after washing to baseline with buffer A, the bound protein eluted as a shouldered peak with an imidazole gradient (0–0.2 m). The fractions were collected, dialyzed against buffer B (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and loaded onto a Hitrap-Q-Sepharose column (5 ml). The column was then washed with a NaCl gradient (0–0.5 m) in buffer B. α1-Antitrypsin was eluted as the major peak (second peak) around 0.2 m NaCl. The fractions were pooled, and protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of 27,560 m−1cm−1 (20Pannell R. Johnson D. Travis J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5439-5445Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. All α1-antitrypsin variants were confirmed to be in pure monomeric form by SDS and native PAGE. α1-Antitrypsin was mixed with protease (2:1 molar ratio) at room temperature (22 ± 1 °C). Samples were taken at timed intervals, mixed immediately with reduced SDS-loading buffer at 100 °C, and heated for a further 3 min. SDS-gel electrophoresis (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206977) Google Scholar) was performed in a 12% gel, and the protein was visualized by Coomassie Blue or silver staining. Stoichiometries of inhibition were determined by incubating increasing concentrations of α1-antitrypsin with a fixed concentration of factor Xa or thrombin. Reactions were conducted at room temperature (22 ± 1 °C) and incubated from 30 min to 4 h in PBS with 0.1% PEG 8000. The residual amidolytic activity was determined by the addition of 0.1 mm S-2222 or S-2238 substrate. Linear regression analysis of the decrease in protease activity with an increasing concentration of α1-antitrypsin yielded the estimates for the stoichiometry of inhibition as the intercept on the abscissa. The stoichiometry of inhibition for Add-1 and Add-2 α1-antitrypsin was estimated from an SDS gel by comparing the band density of cleaved and complexed α1-antitrypsin at an early time point before significant cleaved material accumulated as a result of complex dissociation. Band densities were standardized by dividing by the molecular weight of cleaved and complexed species. The rates of inhibition of factor Xa and thrombin by recombinant α1-antitrypsin variants were determined at room temperature (22 ± 1 °C) by a discontinuous assay procedure. Briefly, under pseudo first-order conditions, 10 µl of 2 µm or 0.2 µmα1-antitrypsin variants were mixed with 10 µl of 50 nm or 10 nm protease in PBS with 0.1% PEG 8000. The residual protease activity was determined at timed intervals by diluting the reaction mixture into the assay buffer containing 0.1 mm S-2222 or S-2238. The observed rate constant,k obs, for the reaction was obtained from the slope of a semilog plot of the residual protease activity against time, and the second-order rate constant, k app, was calculated by dividing k obs by the initial α1-antitrypsin concentration. Rates of complex dissociation were determined essentially as described previously (22Jesty J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10044-10050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Olson S.T. Bock P.E. Kvassman J. Shore J.D. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. Bjork I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30007-30017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). α1-Antitrypsin complexes with factor Xa or thrombin were prepared by incubating enzyme with a 5–10-fold molar excess of α1-antitrypsin for 2–240 min and subsequently diluted 500-fold into 0.2 mm substrate S-2222 or S2238 to monitor complex dissociation. High substrate concentrations were used to ensure that the dissociated protease would not react with the excess α1-antitrypsin. The reappearance of proteolytic activity, reflecting complex dissociation, was monitored continuously for 10–150 min by measuring change in A at 405 nm at room temperature (22 ± 1 °C). Under these experimental conditions, less than 5% of substrate was converted to product, and less than 3% of the complex was dissociated, so that an initial rate of complex dissociation was measured. Data were fit satisfactorily to Equation 1, which describes the initial rate of enzyme generation (22Jesty J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10044-10050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), At=A0+V0×t+koff×[E−I]0×TN×t2/2(Eq. 1) where A t and A 0 are the absorbance at time t and time zero, respectively.V 0 is the rate of change inA 405 at time zero, k offis the first-order rate constant for complex dissociation, [E − I]0 is the starting concentration of complex, and TN is the turnover number for the hydrolysis of substrate by enzyme under the conditions of the experiment and was independently measured. Complex dissociation is irreversible because serpin is released from the complex in an inactive cleaved form rather than in the native intact form (24Olson S.T. Swanson R. Patston P.A. Bjork I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13338-13342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The dissociation rate of the α1-antitrypsin Add-2-factor Xa complex was too fast to be analyzed by the above method and was therefore determined by SDS-PAGE. Briefly, Add-2 was mixed with factor Xa at a molar ratio of 2.5:1 at room temperature (22 ± 1 °C) for 1 min, and then 1 mmPhe-Pro-Arg-chloromethylketone was added to neutralize the free factor Xa and stop the association of factor Xa with excess inhibitor. Time points were taken soon after and the samples were mixed immediately with reducing SDS-loading buffer at 100 °C and heated for a further 3 min. SDS-gel electrophoresis was performed as described above. The density of the complex bands was determined by scanning and using the software Quantity One (Bio-Rad) and analyzed by a semilog plot against dissociation time. The method was validated using the Add-1 mutant, in which comparable rates were obtained using both the chromogenic and the SDS-PAGE methods (see TableI and Fig. 4).Table IRates and stoichiometries of complex formation and rates of complex dissociationComplexPitts-XaAdd-1-XaAdd-2-XaDel-1-XaDel-2-XaPitts-IIaAdd-1-IIaDel-1-IIakapp (m−1s−1)3.2 × 1041.6 × 104ND1.0 × 1043.0 × 1031.8 × 1054.1 × 1055.0 × 103SI1.21.21-aDetermined from densitometry of SDS gels as described under “Experimental Procedures.”1.21-aDetermined from densitometry of SDS gels as described under “Experimental Procedures.”1.22.81.21.43.1k off (s−1)8.4 × 10−91.8 × 10−3 − 1.9 × 10−3*1.3 × 10−21-aDetermined from densitometry of SDS gels as described under “Experimental Procedures.”4.5 × 10−94.8 × 10−98.4 × 10−82.0 × 10−52.0 × 10−8t 12136 weeks6 min53 s255 weeks239 weeks14 weeks10 h57 weeksPitts, recombinant Pittsburgh (P1 Arg); ND, not determined.1-a Determined from densitometry of SDS gels as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Pitts, recombinant Pittsburgh (P1 Arg); ND, not determined. The insertion and deletion variants were created on the α1-antitrypsin Pittsburgh (P1 Arg) (17Owen M.C. Brennan S.O. Lewis J.H. Carrell R.W. N. Engl. J. Med. 1983; 309: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) background to ensure that the changes in the reactive center loop length would not affect the site of proteolytic attack by thrombin and factor Xa. The normal targets of wild-type α1-antitrypsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase react with less specificity for the P1 residue, and thus changes in reactive center loop composition might affect the site of proteolytic attack, as has been observed previously (25Chaillan-Huntington C.E. Gettins P.G.W. Huntington J.A. Patston P.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9562-9570Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 26Huntington J.A. Fan B. Karlsson K.E. Deinum J. Lawrence D.A. Gettins P.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5432-5440Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The insertions and deletions were constructed as shown in Fig. 2 and were placed between P3 and P4 so as not to disrupt the rate or thermodynamics of reactive center loop insertion. Because of the complexity of the serpin-protease reaction mechanism (Scheme FS1), reactants and reaction products are best visualized as bands on an SDS gel. Fig. 3 clearly illustrates the effects of altering the length of the serpin reactive center loop on the initial formation and eventual dissociation of the serpin-protease complex. The first gel (Pitts) confirms that the unmodified α1-antitrypsin Pittsburgh is an effective inhibitor of factor Xa, with rapid formation of complex and a minor amount of cleaved form. The complex is stable over the 60 min of incubation. Similarly, Del-1 α1-antitrypsin can also form stable complex with factor Xa but at a moderately reduced rate and with slightly more cleaved α1-antitrypsin being formed. In both the control and the Del-1 α1-antitrypsins, there is also a small amount of cleaved complex evident from the gels. Del-2 is striking in its inability to effectively inhibit factor Xa. The majority of Del-2 α1-antitrypsin, which has reacted with protease, has become cleaved, and the complex that has formed has all been degraded by free protease by the end of the 60-min incubation. When three residues are deleted from the reactive center loop (Del-3), no complex is observed, and all of the α1-antitrypsin is cleaved. The effect of the addition of one and two extra residues to the reactive center loop of α1-antitrypsin Pittsburgh, shown by gels Add-1 and Add-2, respectively, is dramatic. Whereas in the control gel the α1-antitrypsin-factor Xa complex is stable over the duration of the experiment, the addition of one residue (Add-1) to the reactive center loop results in complete dissociation of the complex by 20 min (lane 9), despite the 2.5-fold excess of inhibitor over protease. The dissociation is clearly via deacylation, because the only two reaction products are cleaved serpin and intact active protease. The excess of serpin makes determination of the half-life difficult under these condition, but it can be estimated at 5 min, because at 5 min (lane 7) most of the native serpin has already reacted, by 10 min (lane 8) half of the complex has dissociated, and by 20 min (lane 9) no complex remains. The addition of two residues to the reactive center loop (Add-2) results in a rate of dissociation that competes with the rate of association, so that by the time all of the native α1-antitrypsin has reacted no complex is detectable. It is not possible to estimate a half-life from this gel, but an upper limit of 1 min can be set, because between the 2- and 5-min time points (lanes 6 and 7) all of the complex has dissociated. It is interesting to note that although in all lanes for Add-1 and Add-2 there is a clear band for free factor Xa, there is no evidence for cleaved complex as in Pitts, Del-1, and Del-2. This may be because of the short half-life of the complex, but may also reflect the loss of induced proteolytic susceptibility of proteases within the complexes with reactive center loop lengthened α1-antitrypsin. Stoichiometries and rates of factor Xa inhibition by the control Pittsburgh α1-antitrypsin and the variants Del-1, Del-2, Add-1, and Add-2 are given in Table I. It is clear from Fig. 3that the stoichiometry of inhibition is extremely sensitive to truncation of the reactive center loop of α1-antitrypsin. In the extreme case of three or more deletions, α1-antitrypsin is effectively rendered a substrate to factor Xa, and in the case of two deletions, there is significantly more cleaved material visible on the gel. The stoichiometry of inhibition in solution for Del-1 is indistinguishable from the control, but for Del-2 the stoichiometry of inhibition is nearly three, indicating that for each reaction resulting in a stable complex, two reactions do not. In the case of the loop insertion variants, it is possible that the large amount of cleaved α1-antitrypsin evident on the gels is caused by a change in stoichiometry of inhibition, an increase in the rate of dissociation, or both. Cleaved serpin is the final product of two distinct pathways defined by the rate constantsk 3 and k 5 (Scheme FS1). The stoichiometry of inhibition is defined as (k 3 +k 4)/k 4 and is thus independent of the complex dissociation term,k 5; however the rate of dissociation of the complex depends on the concentration of the complex. This rendered determination of the stoichiometries using the traditional chromogenic method problematic, because the reactions need to proceed to completion. It was possible to estimate stoichiometries at early time points from SDS gels by dividing the band densities for the cleaved and complex products by their respective molecular weights. The stoichiometries of inhibition for Add-1 and Add-2 thus were determined to be indistinguishable from the control (Table I). Thus, it is possible to delete one residue and add up to two without significantly affecting the relative rates of k 3 andk 4, and deletion of more than two may significantly alter the final conformation of the complex such that full protease translocation can not be achieved. Association rates are also given in Table I. The rate of inactivation of factor Xa by α1-antitrypsin is only mildly sensitive to the length of the reactive center loop, because both the insertion of a single residue and the deletion of up to two residues result in a similar small decrease in second-order rate constant (2-to-4-fold) when accounting for changes in stoichiometry of inhibition. Fig. 3 unequivocally demonstrates the major effect of increasing the length of the serpin reactive center loop: the reduction of stability of the final serpin-protease complex. This is predicted from the crystallographic structure of the α1-antitrypsin-trypsin complex, in which the disruption of the catalytic architecture is the direct result of a 3.5-Å shift in position of the catalytic serine. An increase in the number of reactive center loop residues by one would be equivalent to adding 3.5 Å to its length. The rates of complex dissociation are given in Table I. The insertion of one extra residue in the reactive center loop decreased the stability of the complex by 200,000-fold, and the addition of two residues destabilized it by another 5-fold. Fig.4 shows representative data and fits for the determination of first-order rate constants for complex dissociation. The figure illustrates the determination of dissociation rates for the complex between Add-1 α1-antitrypsin and factor Xa by the chromogenic (Fig. 4 a) and SDS-gel densitometry (Fig. 4 b) methods. The fact that the rates are indistinguishable validates the SDS-gel method for determination of the rate of dissociation of the Add-2 α1-antitrypsin-factor Xa complex (Fig. 4 c), for which the rate was too great for the chromogenic method. Truncation of the reactive center loop by one or two residues had the opposite effect of doubling the complex stability. A unique property of the serpins is their promiscuity as protease inhibitors. α1-Antitrypsin Pittsburgh is no exception and can readily inhibit trypsin, thrombin, factor Xa, and activated protein C. If the plucking displacement of the active site serine from the catalytic site of the protease is a common feature for the inhibition of all serine proteases by serpins, then a similar dependence on reactive center loop length should be observed for other serpin-protease pairs. Fig.5 depicts a set of gels showing the kinetics of reaction for α1-antitrypsin Pittsburgh variants Add-1, Add-2, Del-1, and Del-2 with thrombin and for PAI-1 and PAI-2 with their common target, tissue plasminogen activator. For all, there is a clear trend toward loss of complex stability relative to the control caused by an increase in the length of the reactive center loop. Kinetics and stoichiometries of inhibition of thrombin by the α1-antitrypsin variants and rates of complex dissociation are given in Table I. In contrast to the complexes with factor Xa, the addition of one residue (Add-1) more than doubles the rate of complex formation and effects a mere 240-fold reduction in complex stability. The insertion of an additional residue (Add-2) is required to reach the rates of complex dissociation observed for the Add-1 complex with factor Xa. Conversely, the deletion of just one residue from the reactive center loop (Del-1) is sufficient to increase the stoichiometry of inhibition by 3-fold, decrease the rate of association by 3-fold, and increase the stability of the complex by 4-fold. The increase in stoichiometry of inhibition is similar to what was observed for the reaction of the Del-2 variant with factor Xa, in which the Del-1 mutation had little effect. The tight conservation of the length of serpin reactive center loops is striking when compared with the wide variance in the length of surface loops for other protein families. Indeed, one might predict that the length of the reactive center loop would vary significantly between members of the serpin family because it is this region that determines protease specificity. Conservation of loop length, hinge region (P15–P8) composition, and an absence of charged or bulky even-registered P residues indicates that the entirety of the reactive center loop is involved in the serpin mechanism of inhibition. This conclusion is supported by the only structure of a serpin-protease complex solved to date: that of the prototypical serpin α1-antitrypsin and trypsin (9Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). The structure revealed that the limited length of the reactive center loop induced a 3.5-Å displacement of the catalytic serine from the active site through full reactive center loop incorporation into β-sheet A at the acyl-enzyme intermediate step of the proteolytic cycle. This plucking of the active site serine away from its catalytic partners is only possible if leverage is applied through interactions between the body of the serpin and the protease. Such interactions are clear from the structure of the α1-antitrypsin-trypsin complex. On the basis of these observations we hypothesized that the effect of an increase in the length of reactive center loop would be a reduction in kinetic stability of the covalent serpin-protease complex and furthermore that this would be general to all serpin-protease complexes. We set out to test this hypothesis by creating loop-length variants of Pittsburgh α1-antitrypsin, because it forms complexes with several proteases specifically through reaction with the P1 arginine. Previously, the effect of adding residues C-terminal to the P1 residue has been investigated (27Bottomley S.P. Stone S.R. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 1243-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), but understood in the current context, it is not surprising that there was no effect on the serpin mechanism of inhibition other than a minor change in the rate of complex formation. The data presented here clearly demonstrate the critical dependence of the serpin mechanism on the length of the peptide loop between the reactive center P1 and the conserved hinge (Glu-342 using the template numbering of Huber and Carrell (11Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar)). It is also interesting to compare the kinetics for the formation and dissociation of the α1-antitrypsin Pittsburgh variants with the two coagulation proteases, factor Xa and thrombin. Both followed the general trend shared with the other serpin-protease complexes studied here of a decrease in complex stability with loop elongation and an increase in complex stability with loop truncation. Another trend, most evident for the reaction of the α1-antitrypsin variants with thrombin, is the correlation between loop length and rate of complex formation. The major difference for the factor Xa and thrombin complexes was in their respective sensitivities to loop elongation and truncation. The stability of the complex of α1-antitrypsin Add-1 with factor Xa was reduced by more than 5 orders of magnitude, whereas the stability of the Add-1 complex with thrombin was reduced by only 2 orders of magnitude. Conversely, the deletion of one residue in the Del-1 α1-antitrypsin variant had no effect on the stoichiometry of factor Xa inhibition but resulted in a tripling of the stoichiometry of thrombin inhibition. Such an increase in stoichiometry of factor Xa inhibition required the deletion of two residues from the reactive center loop. We believe this can be explained by differences in plucking stress exerted on the protease active site loop in the two wild-type α1-antitrypsin Pittsburgh-protease complexes. Plucking of the active site loop requires an ester bond between the catalytic serine of the protease and the P1 residue of the serpin and clashes between the bottom of the serpin and the face of the protease containing the active site cleft. The structure of thrombin contains several stretches of sequence not found in factor Xa. Of these, the 60 loop and 147 loop are on the face of the protease that would be in contact with the serpin in the final complex (Fig.6). The difference in bulk is evident from the figure. Models of the complexes were created on the template of the α1-antitrypsin-trypsin complex to determine regions in which the α1-antitrypsin and factor Xa or thrombin would overlap (Fig. 6, red). Serpins with large loops on the pole where proteases sit in the final complex (Fig.1 a, bottom) would be predicted to have a similar effect of increasing the plucking stress on the active site loop of the protease. The serpin mechanism can clearly accommodate shortening but not elongation of the 17-residue reactive center loop. Serpins with 16-residue reactive center loops may share a requirement for the increased complex stability that a foreshortened loop affords. In conclusion, the results presented here provide a clear and consistent picture of a single serpin mechanism of protease inhibition that is critically dependent on a limited reactive center loop length to ensure the kinetic stability of the serpin-protease complex."

Substantial expression of two different mRNAs (HCN4, HCN1) of the family of pacemaker channels (HCN) is found in rabbit SAN, suggesting that the native channels may be formed by different isoforms. Here we report the cloning and heterologous expression of HCN1 from rabbit SAN and its specific localization in pacemaker myocytes. rbHCN1 is an 822-amino acid protein that, in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, displayed electrophysiological properties similar to those of I(f), suggesting that HCN1 can form a pacemaker channel. The presence of HCN1 in the SAN myocytes but not in nearby heart regions, and the electrophysiological properties of the channels formed by it, suggest that HCN1 plays a central and specific role in the formation of SAN pacemaker currents."

These events resemble platelet responses to thrombin, ADP, collagen, and other stimuli that operate optimally at 37 °C through energy-dependent signaling reactions resulting in actin remodeling. However, cooling slows these reactions and causes most cell types to round up. The response of human blood platelets to chilling has profound medical consequences. It limits the storage of over 90 milion platelet units collected worldwide per year for transfusion to 5 days at room temperature, because longer storage leads to unacceptable amounts of microbial growth. Even 5-day storage of platelets without refrigeration results in occasional septic complications following transfusion (6Chernoff A. Snyder E. Transfusion. 1992; 32: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 7Moroff G. Holme S. George V. Heaton W. Transfusion. 1994; 34: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Unactivated discoid platelets have a unique submembrane coil of microtubules. Some microtubules depolymerize at low temperatures, and the microtubule coils of platelets dissolve in the cold (1White J. Krivit W. Blood. 1967; 30: 625-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8White J. Am. J. Pathol. 1968; 53: 281-291PubMed Google Scholar). At reduced temperatures, cells also become less able to maintain energy-dependent low cytosolic calcium levels, and chilled platelets have increased cytosolic calcium concentrations (4Winokur R. Hartwig J. Blood. 1995; 85: 1796-1804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since calcium-dependent severing of the actin scaffolding that maintains the discoid shape of the resting platelet is an early step in normal platelet activation, this calcium rise is presumably a mediator of cold-induced platelet activation. In addition to these clues to possible mechanisms underlying cold activation of platelets, recent work has implicated phosphoinositide-mediated actin assembly (9Hartwig J. Bokoch G. Carpenter C. Janmey P. Taylor L. Toker A. Stossel T. Cell. 1995; 82: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 10Tolias K. Hartwig J. Ishihara H. Shibisaki Y. Erickson J. Cantley L.

Platelet stimulation through the PAR-1 receptor activates the Rho GTPase Rac leading to the synthesis of polyphosphoinositides (ppIs).1 Studies in permeabilized platelets indicated that these lipids induce actin assembly by producing actin nucleation sites equivalent to actin filament fast growing barbed ends. Since these ppIs release barbed end capping proteins such as gelsolin from actin filaments in permeabilized platelets, uncapping of preexisting actin filaments is one pathway proposed from ppIs to actin assembly and is amplifiable by actin filament severing and capping, which increase the number of ends. A second pathway involves ppIs and Cdc42-activated unfolding of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) family proteins, which then bind the Arp2/3 complex, resulting in branching barbed end nucleation at the cell cortex that leads to cell movement (11Derry J.

Although ppI turnover would predictably diminish in the cold, if degradation declined more than synthesis, net ppI levels might increase, leading to actin assembly. A more plausible explanation is that temperature influences the structure of these lipids. The physical chemistry of lipid presentation affects lipid-protein interactions in general and gelsolin actin binding in particular (21Janmey P. Stossel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4825-4831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tablin et al. (22Tablin F. Oliver A. Walker N. Crowe L. Crowe J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) have proposed evidence for lipid phase changes at the critical temperature for cold-induced platelet activation. We previously showed that chilled platelets assemble actin from barbed end nuclei (4Winokur R. Hartwig J. Blood. 1995; 85: 1796-1804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we document that chilling activates ppI-induced barbed end assembly independently of phospholipid synthesis and GTPase activation. We show that ppIs work through both actin filament barbed end uncapping and Arp2/3-mediated nucleation in chilled platelets. We also provide direct evidence that chilling of platelets activates gelsolin to amplify the actin remodeling response. Chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma. Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was isolated and labeled with pyrene as previously described (23Hartwig J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1421-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The QRLFQVKGRR 10-mer polyphosphoinositide-binding peptide was synthesized based on residues 160–169 of gelsolin (24Janmey P. Lamb J. Allen P. Matsudaira P. J. Biol.

The Arp3 component of the Arp2/3 complex was detected using affinity-purified anti-Arp3 antibody provided by Dr. Matt Welch (University of California, Berkeley, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-adducin antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Vann Bennett (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC). The monoclonal anti-gelsolin antibody (2C4) was previously described (25Chaponnier C. Yin H.L. Stossel T.P. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Vectors encoding GST-CA (aa 450–505 of N-WASp) and GST-VCA (aa 392–505 of N-WASp) constructs, derived from the C-terminal end of N-WASp, were kindly provided by Drs. Rajat Rohatgi and Marc Kirschner (Department of Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). The GST-RacN17 and -Cdc42N17 expression constructs were kindly provided by Dr. G. Bokoch (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). GST proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified on glutathione-agarose beads, and stored at −80 °C in concentrations of ≥1 mg/ml. Proteins were thawed at 37 °C and diluted immediately before use. Purity was checked following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis through 15% gels and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Blood was drawn from normal human volunteers by venipuncture into 0.1 volume of Aster-Jandl citrate-based anticoagulant as previously described (26Hartwig J. DeSisto M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 407-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Platelet-rich plasma was prepared by centrifugation of anticoagulated blood at 100 × g for 20 min, and platelets were separated from the plasma proteins by gel filtration (26Hartwig J. DeSisto M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 407-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) through a small Sepharose 2B column. Blood was obtained from wild-type and gelsolin −/− (27Witke W. Sharpe A. Hartwig J. Azuma T. Stossel T. Kwiatkowski D. Cell. 1995; 81: 41-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) mice by cardiac puncture into 0.1 volume of Aster-Jandl anticoagulant. Mouse platelet-rich plasma was separated from the red blood cells by centrifugation of the blood at 100 ×g for 6 min, followed by centrifugation of the supernatant and the buffy coat again at 100 × g for 6 min. Mouse platelets were isolated from platelet-rich plasma using a metrizamide gradient (28Falet H. Barkalow K.L. Pivniouk V.I. Barnes M.J. Geha R.S. Hartwig J.H. Blood. 2000; 96: 3786-3792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, platelets were concentrated between 25 and 10% metrizamide in 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 12 mm trisodium citrate, 10 mm glucose, 12.5 mm sucrose, pH 6, by centrifugation at 1,100 ×g for 12 min. This washing procedure was repeated, and the platelets were resuspended in 140 mm NaCl, 3 mmKCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmNaHCO3, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mmHepes, pH 7.4. The concentration of human and mouse platelets was adjusted to 3 × 108/ml, and platelets were allowed to rest for 30 min at 37 °C before use. Resting platelets in suspension (90 μl containing 1.5 × 108platelets) were permeabilized at 37 °C by the addition of one-ninth volume (10 μl) of 2.5% OG in 60 mm Pipes, 25 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mmMgCl2, 2 μm phallacidin, and protease inhibitors (PHEM buffer) (29Hartwig J. Carraway K.L. Carraway C.-A.C. The Cytoskeleton: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1992: 23-45Google Scholar). The detergent-platelet suspension was mixed, and the platelets were allowed to extract for 30 s at 37 °C. TRAP, GTPγS, GDPβS, GST-RacN17, GST-Cdc42N17, GST-VCA, or GST-CA were added to the OG-permeabilized cells just before cooling. Permeabilized cells were then cooled for 5 min at ice bath temperatures and rewarmed for 2 min at 37 °C. This procedure resulted in 70–80% of the platelet permeabilized as judged by the incorporation of FITC-phalloidin into the platelets (data not shown). Phosphatidylserine (l-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine dipalmitoyl (C16:0)) and PtdIns-4,5-P2 were obtained from Sigma. Phosphatidylserine and PtdIns-4,5-P2 were dissolved by sonication in water as described by Janmey and Stossel (21Janmey P. Stossel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4825-4831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were added to the chilled and rewarmed OG permeabilized platelets. 25-mm round coverslips were attached to the bottom of 35-mm plastic Petri dishes, each having a 10-mm hole punched in its bottom. The coverslips were coated with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 10 min. For experiments using OG, the platelets were permeabilized for 30 s using a final concentration of 0.25% OG. OG suspensions were chilled in plastic tubes for 5 min in an ice bath. In experiments on rewarmed platelets, the tubes were rewarmed to 37 °C for 2 min in a water bath. Platelets were fixed for morphological examination with a final concentration of 3.4% formaldehyde in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. The fixed platelets were viewed in a Zeiss IM-35 inverted microscope using differential interference contrast optics and a 100× oil immersion objective. Images were captured with a Hamamatsu C2400 CCD camera (Hamamatsu, Japan), processed for background subtraction and frame averaging with a Hamamatsu ARGUS image processor, and digitally stored with a Macintosh computer equipped with a SCION frame grabber LG-3 (SCION, Frederick, MD). Human platelets were pelleted and washed from platelet-rich plasma by two sequential centrifugations at 800 × g for 10 min in the presence of 1 μm prostaglandin E1 (Sigma). The purified platelets (∼109/ml) were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 2 mCi/ml of [32P]orthophosphoric acid.32P in the medium was separated from the platelets by gel filtration over a Sepharose 2B column as described above. The platelets were incubated at ice bath temperatures for 10, 20, 30, or 40 min, and total phospholipids were extracted using two combined washes of chloroform/methanol/HCl. ppIs were deacylated and analyzed by HPLC as described (9Hartwig J. Bokoch G. Carpenter C. Janmey P. Taylor L. Toker A. Stossel T. Cell. 1995; 82: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 30Hartwig J. Kung S. Kovacsovics T. Janmey P.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Intact platelets (90 μl containing 1.5 × 108 platelets), incubated at ice bath temperatures for 5 min or treated with 1 unit/ml thrombin for 60 s, were permeabilized with one-ninth volume of 1% Triton X-100 in PHEM buffer. To assess filament end numbers in a temperature-dependent manner, intact platelets (90 μl containing 1.5 × 108 platelets) were incubated for 5 min at 37, 25, 20, 15, 10, 5, or 0 °C with or without the addition of 25 μm TRAP for 60 s and were permeabilized as described above. To assay filament barbed ends, 185 μl of a solution containing 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0, was added to 100 μl of the Triton X-100 or OG-lysate. The actin polymerization rate assay was started by the addition of 15 μl of 20 μmmonomeric pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal muscle actin to a final concentration of 1 μm. In this assay, the fluorescence increase is proportional to actin assembled into filaments. Fluorescence was recorded in a LS50 spectrofluorimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using excitation and emission wavelengths of 366 and 386 nm, respectively. Actin assembly inhibited by 2 μmcytochalasin B is defined as occurring at the barbed end of the actin filament. Activity not inhibited by cytochalasin B is defined as pointed end assembly. The number of free actin filament barbed ends was calculated from the known assembly rates of actin and the cytochalasin sensitivity of this assembly as previously described (23Hartwig J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1421-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The barbed and pointed end addition rates used are 10 and 1 monomer s−1, respectively (32Pollard T. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Resting and cold-activated platelets (1, 2, 5, and 30 min at ice bath temperatures) or platelets loaded with 40 μm EGTA-AM for 30 min at 37 °C and then chilled (1, 2, 5, and 30 min at ice bath temperatures) were lysed using a final Triton X-100 concentration of 0.1% in PHEM buffer. The lysates were centrifuged at 450,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the resultant pellets and supernatants were separated. The pellet, corresponding to the cytoskeleton, was resuspended to 133% of original volume in 1× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer (33Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. The supernatant was dissolved by the addition of 33% of the original volume of 4× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis buffer. The samples were boiled for 5 min. Proteins were displayed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp.). Membranes were blocked using 1% bovine serum albumin in 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and then probed with specific antibodies and appropriate peroxidase-tagged secondary antibodies. Detection was performed with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce). Resting or cold-activated platelets (1, 2, 5, and 30 min at ice bath temperatures) were fixed in 3.4% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in the presence of 10 μm FITC-phalloidin. Bound FITC-phalloidin was quantified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis using a Beckton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Franklin Lakes, NJ). A total of 10,000 events were analyzed for each sample. Fig. 1 shows that most platelets remain discoid at 37 °C after permeabilization with OG (Fig. 1 a) and that these permeabilized platelets change shape when chilled (Fig. 1 b). Chilled OG-permeabilized platelets have blebs on their surfaces and elaborate filopodial-like structures that remain after rewarming (Fig. 1 c). Rewarming is, however, required to detect actin filament barbed ends that nucleate the assembly of pyrene-actin, suggesting that OG-treated platelets reseal upon cooling but become permeable again when rewarmed (Fig. 1 d). We verified this idea by extracting OG-permeabilized cells with Triton X-100 after cooling, followed or not by rewarming. After Triton X-100 treatment, 199 ± 30 barbed end nucleation sites were detectable in chilled platelets, an increase of 3-fold over cells maintained at 37 °C. Chilling of OG-permeabilized platelets for ≥5 min at 4 °C followed by rewarming led to the production of 170 ± 10 barbed ends/cell, demonstrating that the permeabilized cells retain ∼90% of their response to cold. Exposure of filament ends was restricted to barbed ends in OG-permeabilized platelets, since 2 μm cytochalasin B, an agent that binds to the barbed end and inhibits monomer assembly onto this end, abolished all detectable actin assembly from OG-permeabilized platelets (data not shown). In summary, cooling and rewarming of permeabilized platelets reports barbed end exposure and allows dissection of this process through the addition of inhibitory reagents normally unable to penetrate into platelets. The addition of a 10-mer peptide derived from the ppI-binding site of gelsolin to OG-permeabilized platelets diminished barbed actin filament end exposure when permeabilized platelets were chilled for 5 min. 2 μm peptide decreased detectable barbed ends by ∼65%, and 20–30 μmcompletely inhibited barbed end exposure following chilling (Fig.2 a). Resting platelets have 44 ± 16 exposed actin filaments barbed ends. This result is consistent with previous studies showing that 25 μm of the 10-mer peptide inhibits all barbed end nucleation in permeabilized PAR-1-activated platelets and formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine-activated neutrophils (9Hartwig J. Bokoch G. Carpenter C. Janmey P. Taylor L. Toker A. Stossel T. Cell. 1995; 82: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 34Glogauer M. Hartwig J. Stossel T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Incubation with 25 μm of the 10-mer peptide prevented the growth of protrusions from the surface of chilled permeabilized platelets (Fig. 2 b). The addition of PtdIns-4,5-P2 to OG-permeabilized, peptide-treated platelets rescued actin nucleation in a dose-dependent manner, whereas phosphatidylserine (PS) was without effect (Fig. 2 c). These data show that ppIs are intimately involved in the actin assembly reaction that distorts the shape of the platelet in the cold. To determine whether the ppI content changes during the chilling process, platelets, loaded with 32P to label the phospholipid pool, were incubated at ice bath temperatures for 5–40 min. Fig. 3 shows that cooling did not alter the content of D3- and D4-containing ppIs in platelet membranes at time points when actin assembly and shape change are maximal.Figure 3Chilling of platelets to 4 °C does not result in the synthesis or degradation of membrane ppIs. Platelet ppIs, labeled to equilibrium with 32P, were isolated from resting and chilled platelets. The relative distribution of each ppI type was quantified by HPLC analysis. Profiles are shown of phosphatidylinositol 3-trisphosphate (PI 3 P) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI 34 P 2 ) (top) and of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI 4 P) and PtdIns-4,5-P2(PI 45 P 2 ) (bottom) in platelets incubated at ice bath temperatures for 5–40 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the temperature dependence of cold-induced actin assembly, platelets were incubated at decreasing temperatures for 5 min. As the temperature decreased, the barbed end number per platelet increased from 55 ± 9 at 37 °C to maximal values at or below 10 °C of 254 ± 21 barbed ends per cell. The platelet F-actin content increased maximally by ∼25% at temperatures of ≤15 °C. Both barbed end exposure and F-actin content begin to increase when the temperature decreases to ≤20 °C. Tablin et al. (22Tablin F. Oliver A. Walker N. Crowe L. Crowe J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) have shown that membrane phase transitions and platelet shape changes begin at this temperature. Platelets lose their responsiveness as their temperatures decrease and do not respond to TRAP at ≤5 °C (Fig.4 a). When platelets are activated at 37 °C by ligation of the PAR-1 receptor, GTPases are upstream of ppI production (9Hartwig J. Bokoch G. Carpenter C. Janmey P. Taylor L. Toker A. Stossel T. Cell. 1995; 82: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 10Tolias K. Hartwig J. Ishihara H. Shibisaki Y. Erickson J. Cantley L. Carpenter C. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 153-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). As reported, GTPase antagonists, GDPβS or dominant negative GTPases, are potent inhibitors of PAR-1-mediated signaling to actin in platelets (9Hartwig J. Bokoch G. Carpenter C. Janmey P. Taylor L. Toker A. Stossel T. Cell. 1995; 82: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Fig.5 shows that actin assembly is not coupled to GTPases in chilled OG-permeabilized platelets. The nonhydrolyzable GDPβS and GTPγS analogs fail to affect the number of barbed ends exposed after chilling of OG-permeabilized platelets. In accordance with this finding, the dominant negative GTPases, 1.5 μm GST-N17Rac1 or 3 μm GST-N17Cdc42, do not affect the number of barbed filament ends produced in chilled OG-permeabilized platelets (Fig. 5). These data, combined with a lack of new ppI synthesis in the cold and the temperature dependence of barbed end exposure, support the notion that lipid rearrangements, uncoupled from receptors and GTPases, induce actin assembly and shape change in cooled platelets. Barbed end capping proteins such as gelsolin or adducin regulate platelet actin assembly. In the resting platelet, gelsolin is inactive, and most of it is not bound to actin and therefore extractable by detergents (35Lind S.E. Janmey P.A. Chaponnier C. Herbert T.-J. Stossel T.P. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Binding to actin by gelsolin is rapidly induced by the intracellular free calcium increase following PAR-1 ligation. A large fraction of the bound gelsolin subsequently dissociates from actin. Fig.6 a shows that gelsolin reversibly associates with the actin cytoskeleton fraction of chilled platelets. Gelsolin is ∼80–90% detergent-extractable in resting platelets at 37 °C, but 20–30% becomes inextractable ≤5 min after chilling. In contrast, the small amount of gelsolin in the resting cytoskeleton (10%) dissociates from the cytoskeletal fraction of EGTA-AM-loaded and cooled platelets (Fig. 6 a). As we previously reported, platelet F-actin content increased following cooling (4Winokur R. Hartwig J. Blood. 1995; 85: 1796-1804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The F-actin content increases from 40 to ∼60% after chilling for 30 min, as determined by FITC-phalloidin binding by flow cytometry (data not shown) (4Winokur R. Hartwig J. Blood. 1995; 85: 1796-1804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inset in Fig.6 a shows the gelsolin/F-actin ratio in cooled untreated platelets and in platelets preloaded with 40 μm EGTA-AM. The ratio increases from 1:300 in resting cells to 1:180 after 5 min of cooling and then decreases to 1:250 after 30 min of chilling. In contrast, the ratio decreased to 1:1000 within the first minute of cooling in platelets loaded with EGTA-AM. Direct evidence that gelsolin is involved in the actin response induced by chilling comes from experiments on platelets from gelsolin −/− mice. Fig. 6 bshows that gelsolin −/− platelets undergo only small distortions from their discoid shape when cooled compared with wild-type mouse platelets. The most prominent shape change is the elongation of the discs into barbell shapes, although a few filopodia and blebs are observable. Wild-type mouse platelets lose their discoid shapes and protrude filopodia and blebs in similar fashion to human platelets when chilled. Gelsolin −/− platelets expose 50% less barbed ends upon chilling compared with gelsolin +/+ platelets. Fig. 6 creports that cold activation stimulates a ∼3-fold increase of barbed end exposure in wild-type mouse platelets, whereas gelsolin −/− platelets have only a ∼1.5-fold increase in barbed ends. Exposure of filament ends is restricted to the barbed ends in the Triton X-100 permeabilized platelets, since 2 μm cytochalasin B abolished all detectable pyrene actin assembly (data not shown). Murine platelets activated with 1 unit/ml thrombin for 1 min at 37 °C increased the number of actin nuclei by ∼5-fold in wild-type and ∼2.8-fold in the gelsolin null platelets. Chilling also dissociates the barbed end capping protein adducin from the platelet actin cytoskeleton (Fig. 7). In resting platelets, ∼70–80% of the total adducin is bound to the cytoskeletal fraction. Adducin begins to dissociate from the platelet actin cytoskeleton 2 min after chilling, and the dissociation becomes maximal after 30 min (Fig. 7). The inset in Fig. 7 shows the adducin/F-actin ratio in the cytoskeleton of cold-activated platelets. The amount of adducin bound to the cytoskeletal fraction decreases during the cold activation 1:100 in resting cells to 1:333 after 30 min. The d"

Tiam1, a newly identified guanine nucleotide exchange factor, has been shown to inhibit or promote cell migration in a cell type-dependent manner. In this study, we identified Tiam1 as a target of HRG signaling. HRG stimulation of breast cancer epithelial cells induced the phosphorylation and redistribution of Tiam1 to the membrane ruffles and the loosening of intercellular junctions. In addition, HRG-mediated scattering of breast epithelial cells was accompanied by stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation and redistribution of β-catenin from the cell junctions to the cytosol and, finally, entry into the nucleus. Decompaction of breast cancer epithelial cells by HRG was accompanied by a transient physical association of the tyrosine-phosphorylated β-catenin with the activated human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and subsequent nuclear translocation of β-catenin, as well as β-catenin-dependent transactivation of T-cell factor·lymphoid enhancer factor-1. All of these HRG-induced phenotypic changes were regulated in a phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-sensitive manner. HRG-induced cellular ruffles, loss of intercellular adhesiveness, and increased cell migration could be mimicked by overexpression of a fully functional Tiam1 construct. Furthermore, ectopic expression of Tiam1 or of an active β-catenin mutant led to potentiation of the β-catenin-dependent T-cell factor·lymphoid enhancer factor-1 transactivation and invasiveness of HRG-treated cells. We also found preliminary evidence suggesting a close correlation between the status of Tiam1 expression and invasiveness of human breast tumor cells with the degree of progression of breast tumors. Together, these findings suggest that HRG regulate Tiam1 activation and lymphoid enhancer factor/β-catenin nuclear signaling via phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase in breast cancer cells."

The N- and C-terminal domains of gephyrin are homologous to the Escherichia coli enzymes MogA and MoeA, respectively, both of which are involved in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis. This enzymatic pathway is highly conserved from bacteria to mammals, as underlined by the ability of gephyrin to rescue molybdenum cofactor deficiencies in different organisms.

Chem. 1991; 266: 22242-22245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the cytoplasmic loop region of the glycine receptor β-subunit (10Meyer G. Kirsch J. Betz H. Langosch D.

Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1323-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Similar interactions are also thought to mediate the synaptic localization of γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (12Kneussel M. Betz H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 525: 1-9Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). A high concentration of gephyrin at the cytoplasmic face of inhibitory postsynaptic membrane specializations (13Triller A. Cluzeaud F.

Brain Res. 1986; 369: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) is consistent with gephyrin acting as a synaptic receptor scaffolding protein (reviewed in Ref. 15Kneussel M. Betz H. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 429-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In addition to its synaptic function in the central nervous system, gephyrin has been shown to be involved in the biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor (Moco),1 which is a crucial component of different enzymes catalyzing important redox reactions (16Kisker C. Schindelin H. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 233-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). This was first highlighted by the homology of gephyrin to theEscherichia coli enzymes MogA and MoeA, which are known to be implicated in Moco biosynthesis (12Kneussel M. Betz H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 525: 1-9Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Homology lies within the N- and C-terminal domains of gephyrin, which are separated by an intervening region of ∼170 amino acids that harbors multiple protein interaction domains (17Ramming M. Kins S. Werner N. Herman A. Betz H. Kirsch J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10266-10271Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Similar multi-domain proteins comprising both MogA and MoeA homologous domains are found in Drosophila melanogaster (cinnamon) (18Kamdar K.P. Primus J.P. Shelton M.E. Archangeli L.L. Wittle A.E. Finnerty V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 778-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and Arabidopsis thaliana(Cnx1) (19Stallmeyer B. Nerlich A. Schiemann J. Brinkmannn H. Mendel R.R. Plant J. 1995; 8: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), in which they have also been shown to be implicated in Moco biosynthesis. Moco consists of mononuclear molybdenum coordinated by the dithiolene moiety of tricyclic pyranopterins such as molybdopterin. InE. coli, Moco is synthesized by multiple enzymes (20Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10199-10202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Mendel R.R. Planta. 1997; 203: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) that catalyze the conversion of GTP via precursor Z to molybdopterin (MPT) followed by the insertion of molybdenum (22Pitterle D.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13499-13505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 26811-26814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Gephyrin has been shown to bind MPT with high affinity and to restore Moco biosynthesis in E. coli MogA mutants as well as in Moco-deficient L929 fibroblasts and plants (25Stallmeyer B. Schwarz G. Schulze J. Nerlich A. Reiss J. Kirsch K. Mendel R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1333-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These complementation assays indicate that the N-terminal domain of gephyrin is functionally equivalent to MogA in catalyzing the transfer of molybdenum to MPT (25Stallmeyer B. Schwarz G. Schulze J. Nerlich A. Reiss J. Kirsch K. Mendel R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1333-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The MoeA-like C-terminal domain, in contrast, seems either essential for the conversion of precursor Z to Moco, because MoeA mutants of E. coli accumulate this precursor (26Johnson M.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 110-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or may have a function in the transformation of molybdenum into thiomolybdate (27Hasona A. Ray R.M. Shanmugam K.T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1466-1472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in gephyrin, gene fusion has allowed the recruiting of two independent enzymatic activities and a membrane protein scaffolding function into a single polypeptide. The crucial role played by gephyrin in Moco biosynthesis was revealed previously by the analysis of gephyrin knockout mice, which in addition to an impaired synaptic localization of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors, shows only basal levels of Moco-dependent enzyme activities in peripheral organs (5Feng G. Tintrup H. Kirsch J. Nichol M.C. Kushe J. Betz H. Sanes J. Science. 1998; 282: 1321-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 7Kneussel M. Brandstätter J.-H. Laube B. Stahl S. Müller U. Betz H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9289-9297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, hereditary Moco deficiencies in humans cause symptoms that are similar to those observed upon the loss of inhibitory neurotransmission in gephyrin knockout mice (5Feng G. Tintrup H. Kirsch J. Nichol M.C. Kushe J. Betz H. Sanes J. Science. 1998; 282: 1321-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Both are characterized by severe neurological abnormalities such as increased muscle tone, mental retardation, microcephaly, myoclonus, and tonic-clonic seizures (28Johnson J.L. Wadman S.K. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 2271-2283Google Scholar). Moreover, a microdeletion in the gephyrin gene has been identified recently in a Moco-deficient patient (29Reiss J. Gross-Hardt S. Christensen E. Schmidt P. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 66: 208-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, the lack of molybdoenzyme activities such as sulfite oxidase in affected patients as well as in gephyrin knockout mice (5Feng G. Tintrup H. Kirsch J. Nichol M.C. Kushe J. Betz H. Sanes J. Science. 1998; 282: 1321-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) could cause neurological disorders through the accumulation of toxic metabolites (28Johnson J.L. Wadman S.K. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 2271-2283Google Scholar, 30Brown G.K. Scholem R.D. Croll R.B. Wraith J.E. McGill J.J. Neurology. 1989; 39: 252-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not yet clear whether the role of gephyrin in Moco biosynthesis and receptor clustering at the postsynaptic membrane are two interdependent or completely separate processes. Here we present the three-dimensional structure of the N-terminal domain of gephyrin from rat and show that it forms a trimer both in solution and in the crystalline state. Overall, the structure of gephyrin displays high homology to that of E. coli MogA. Differences include a MogA insertion of unknown function as well as different paths of the C-terminal ends. The predicted orientations of the C-terminal linker regions of gephyrin suggest 3-fold symmetry for the entire molecule. A highly conserved region is discussed as being the putative active site based on sequence homologies and mutagenesis data. Gephyrin cDNA encoding residues 2–188 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using synthetic oligonucleotides and cloned into the expression vector pRset (Invitrogen) using the restriction sitesNheI and EcoRI. This strategy placed a His tag derived from the vector on the N terminus. The correct sequence of the construct was verified by DNA sequencing. Expression was achieved inE. coli BL21/codon+ cells (Invitrogen) following standard protocols. Expression of gephyrin-(2–188) was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.8, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The supernatant was cleared by centrifugation and loaded onto a Ni2+-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer. The column was then extensively washed with lysis buffer, and a 0–500 mm imidazole gradient in lysis buffer was applied to elute gephyrin-(2–188). Fractions containing pure gephyrin-(2–188) were concentrated and loaded onto a Superdex 200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column in a buffer containing 20 mm bicine, pH 9.3, and 100 mm NaCl. The total yield of gephyrin-(2–188) was 60 mg from 1 liter of the E. coli culture. Gephyrin-(2–188) was incubated with glutaraldehyde concentrations as indicated (Fig. 1) in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions, and the bands were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Molybdopterin bound to gephyrin was analyzed according to Johnson and Rajagopalan (26Johnson M.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 110-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. 1 mg of gephyrin-(2–188) was oxidized over night at room temperature by the addition of acidic iodine solution (1% I2/2% KI/1 m HCl). Residual iodine was reduced by the addition of ascorbic acid, and 1 m Tris base was added to adjust the pH to 8.5. After centrifugation, alkaline phosphatase (2 units, Sigma-Aldrich) and 7 mmMgCl2 were added to the supernatant for dephosphorylation (4 h at 37 °C). The sample was applied to a 0.5-ml QAE-Sephadex (acetate form) column and washed (5 ml of water), and form A dephospho was eluted with 5 ml of 10 mm acetic acid. High pressure liquid chromatography was performed using a C18 column (Hypersil ODS, 5 μm, 25 cm) coupled to a fluorescence detector (370/450 nm). 1 ml of the QAE-Sephadex eluate was injected and eluted with 50 mmammonium acetate/7% methanol at 1 ml/min. The lower limit for quantitative measurement of the form A dephospho derivative of molybdopterin was 0.03 pmol/injection corresponding to about 0.3 pmol of MPT/sample. Gephyrin-(2–188) was crystallized at a concentration of 18 mg/ml using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals grew in drops of a mixture of 1 μl of protein solution and 1 μl of reservoir solution containing 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 1500, 0.1m sodium citrate, pH 5.6, and 10% isopropanol. Cryotreatment was performed by a quick transfer of the crystals into a solution containing 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 1500, 0.1m sodium citrate, pH 5.6, 10% isopropanol, and 20% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol followed by flash cooling in a gaseous nitrogen stream. Data to 1.9 Å were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble) beamline ID14 EH2 at a wavelength of 0.933 Å, with a 2° oscillation range. X-ray data were processed using the program packages DENZO (31Otwinowsky Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38446) Google Scholar), SCALEPACK (31Otwinowsky Z. Minor W.

The structure of gephyrin was solved by molecular replacement using the E. coli MogA structure (34Liu M.W. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. J. Biol.

The program package AMoRe (35Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar) was employed using data between 15 and 4.5 Å. This resulted in a clear peak with a correlation coefficient of 38.7 and an R-factor of 45.0 after rigid body refinement, which corresponded to the correct solution. Automated model building and refinement were performed with the program ARP/wARP (36Perrakis A. Morris R.J.H. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct.

The automated refinement included both positional and restrained B-factor refinement applying bulk solvent correction with CNS (39Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

The N-terminal domain of gephyrin (residues 2–188) expressed in E. coliforms trimers in solution as detected by gel filtration chromatography. The recombinant protein (calculated molecular mass of 21.2 kDa) eluted at a volume of 13.2 ml from a Superdex 200 gel filtration column compared with a volume of 13.6 ml determined for bovine serum albumine (molecular mass of 66 kDa) (data not shown); this is consistent with an oligomeric structure. Chemical cross-linking experiments corroborate this conclusion. Incubation of gephyrin-(2–188) with increasing concentrations of the cross-linking reagent glutaraldehyde caused the appearance of two adducts, the sizes of which corresponded to dimeric and trimeric forms of gephyrin-(2–188) (Fig.1). Rat gephyrin-(2–188) expressed inE. coli was crystallized in the rhombohedral space group R3. The crystals diffracted x-rays to 1.9-Å resolution (TableI) and contain 1 molecule/asymmetric unit. The three-dimensional structure of gephyrin-(2–188) was solved by molecular replacement using the E. coli MogA structure (34Liu M.W. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1814-1822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) as a search model. The final model has been refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 19.9 (R free = 21.9) with good stereochemistry (Table II) and includes residues 13–181 and 90 water molecules. The N-terminal His tag and the first 12 residues as well as C-terminal residues 182–188 were disordered in the crystal, and the last two residues of helix 8 were built as alanines. The N-terminal domain of gephyrin forms an α/β structure that contains a central predominantly parallel β-sheet with flanking α-helices. β-strands 1–4 and 6 form a parallel β-sheet that is interrupted by the antiparallel β-strand 5 (Fig. 2a). The trimer axis coincides with the crystallographic 3-fold axis and includes three layers of interactions. The top layer (viewed from the opposite end of the connection to the intervening domain in Fig. 2) is characterized by a hydrophobic core made up of residues from helix 5 (Figs.2a and 3). This is followed by hydrophobic and polar interactions contributed by a 3/10 helix and the linker to β-strand 5. The opposite site of the interface is characterized by polar interactions involving residues from the linker region preceding helix 4 and β-strand 4 (Figs. 2a and 3). The most prominent is a salt bridge between Lys-101 and Glu-107 of a neighboring molecule. In addition, this region also forms a number of polar contacts with water molecules. Interestingly, the bottom surface is more hydrophilic than the top surface, and it connects the N-terminal domain to the intervening region (Figs. 4, a andc, and 2b).Figure 3Sequence alignment of the Mog-A like domains from gephyrin (Rattus norvegicus),Caenorhabditis elegans protein (data base code Q23069, 35.1% homology to gephyrin), cinnamon (D. melanogaster, 41.6% homology), Cnx1 (A.thaliana, 41.97% homology), and MogA (E. coli, 28.5% homology).

White arrows indicate slight differences in the trimer interface as seen from the top.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A side view of the trimeric gephyrin-(2–188) molecule (Fig.2b) shows that the connection to the intervening region lies underneath the trimer formed by the N-terminal domain (bottom part of the gephyrin trimer). This connection includes the linker residues 173–181 that extend from the main structure by forming a short helix 8 (Figs. 2, b and c, and 3). Clear electron density for this region was present in the map calculated after automatic model building using ARP/wARP (36Perrakis A. Morris R.J.H. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar). The orientation of the connecting helix is determined by a network of hydrogen bonds that are provided mostly by water molecules and by a salt bridge from Lys-177 to Glu-76 (Fig.2c). The fixed orientation of the linker residues implies that the intervening region will form a second layer of domains that may associate in a fashion that most likely will obey the same 3-fold symmetry. The lack of clear electron density for the last seven residues that are followed by a proline-rich region (189-PPPPLSPPPP-198) suggests that the intervening regions may be linked via a long spacer sequence. This may account for possible interdomain flexibility that in turn may be crucial for interactions with other effector molecules (15Kneussel M. Betz H. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 429-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Superposition of the C-α atoms of the MogA structure with the gephyrin model revealed an overall root-mean-square deviation of 3.7 Å. If the MogA β-hairpin insertion (Fig. 3) and the C-terminal ends (regions beyond residue 170 in both structures) of both gephyrin-(2–188) and MogA are excluded, the root-mean-square deviation is 1.24 Å (Fig. 5a). Both molecules form a very similar trimer interface, and most of the residues within van der Waals contact are conserved between gephyrin-(2–188) and MogA (Fig. 3). Interestingly, a small hydrophilic cavity lies on top of the MogA trimer interface, whereas the corresponding region in gephyrin is mostly hydrophobic (Fig. 4, aand b, white arrows). However, despite of the overall similarity, there are three regions of major divergence. (i) MogA contains 12 additional residues that form a β-hairpin (β-strands 7 and 8) that, if presented in the gephyrin structure, would be positioned C-terminally to α-helix 6 (Figs. 3 and5a). (ii) The loop region connecting helix 2 and β-strand 2 (Fig. 3) is organized differently in both molecules. In gephyrin-(2–188), Pro-46 is at the beginning of a turn where the carbonyl oxygen of the previous residue Asn-45 hydrogen bonds to the backbone nitrogen of Leu-48. Instead, the same region is extended in MogA and makes hydrogen bond interactions with a C-terminal segment (residues 175 and 177). (iii) The C termini of both molecules show completely different chain directions. At residue 170 (same residue number in both molecules), there is a dramatic change in main chain orientation, as indicated by a φ dihedral value of −53.8 for gephyrin and 67.4 for MogA. This results in opposite spatial placements of these regions in both structures. In MogA, the turn at residue 170 keeps the main chain antiparallel to helix 6 in an extended conformation, which reverses direction at positions 179 and establishes interactions with the MogA-specific β-hairpin insertion (β-strands 7 and 8). In gephyrin-(2–188), in contrast, the corresponding linker segment between helix 7 and the C-terminal end extends into the opposite direction away from the N-terminal domain and ends in a short helix 8 (Figs. 2b and 5a). The structural differences mediated by the sequence insertion in MogA as well as the different directions of the C-terminal ends result in major differences in the exposed surfaces of the trimers (Fig. 4,yellow arrows). The differences in the electrostatic surfaces of gephyrin-(2–188) and MogA noted on the top of the molecule can be attributed to the insertion of the β-hairpin loop as well as the different paths of the C termini. Gephyrin shows a prominent negatively charged surface as well as small positively charged islands on the top of the trimer (Fig. 4a) as compared with a reduced negative surface charge of MogA (Fig. 4b). Interestingly, the bottom of the trimer that forms the interface to the intervening domains of gephyrin is characterized also by a mostly negatively charged surface and closely resembles the electrostatic profile of the corresponding surface of MogA (Fig. 4, c andd). The high degree of sequence similarity and the conserved function of the N-terminal domain of mammalian gephyrin and E. coli MogA suggest that the homologous domains from CaenorhabditisQ23O69, Drosophila cinnamon, and Arabidopsis Cnx1 may have similar overall architectures (Fig. 3). Significant structural differences can therefore only be expected at the respective N- and C-terminal ends that are longer or form linkers to additional domains. The sequence alignment shown in Fig. 3 highlights this conservation and indicates a set of conserved residues that may be implicated in the enzymatic function of these proteins. The highest sequence conservation among all known MogA-related polypeptides (Fig. 3) maps to a loop region connecting β-strand 3 and helix 4 (Fig. 5b). The conserved sequence motif GGTG in thi"

Sequence analysis reveals that this 1,958-base pair cDNA encodes a 57–58-kDa 502-amino acid polypeptide that is 70–91% identical to CYP2J subfamily P450s and is designated CYP2J9. Recombinant CYP2J9 was co-expressed with NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (CYPOR) in Sf9cells using a baculovirus system. Microsomes of CYP2J9/CYPOR-transfected cells metabolize arachidonic acid to 19-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) thus CYP2J9 is enzymologically distinct from other P450s. Northern analysis reveals that CYP2J9 transcripts are present at high levels in mouse brain. Mouse brain microsomes biosynthesize 19-HETE. RNA polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrates that CYP2J9 mRNAs are widely distributed in brain and most abundant in the cerebellum. Immunoblotting using an antibody raised against human CYP2J2 that cross-reacts with CYP2J9 detects a 56-kDa protein band that is expressed in cerebellum and other brain segments and is regulated during postnatal development. In situ hybridization of mouse brain sections with a CYP2J9-specific riboprobe and immunohistochemical staining with the anti-human CYP2J2 IgG reveals abundant CYP2J9 mRNA and protein in cerebellar Purkinje cells. Importantly, 19-HETE inhibits the activity of recombinant P/Q-type Ca2+ channels that are known to be expressed preferentially in cerebellar Purkinje cells and are involved in triggering neurotransmitter release. Based on these data, we conclude that CYP2J9 is a developmentally regulated P450 that is abundant in brain, localized to cerebellar Purkinje cells, and active in the biosynthesis of 19-HETE, an eicosanoid that inhibits activity of P/Q-type Ca2+ channels. We postulate that CYP2J9 arachidonic acid products play important functional roles in the brain.AF336850 A cDNA encoding a new cytochrome P450 was isolated from a mouse brain library.

Herein, we report the cDNA cloning and heterologous expression of CYP2J9, a new mouse P450 that is primarily expressed in the brain, regulated during postnatal brain development, and active in the ω-1 hydroxylation of arachidonic acid to 19-HETE. We further demonstrate, using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical techniques, that CYP2J9 mRNA and protein are localized to Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Importantly, we show that 19-HETE significantly inhibits the activity of recombinant P/Q-type Ca2+ channels, voltage-gated channels which are known to be preferentially expressed in Purkinje cells and are involved in triggering the release of neurotransmitters. Based on these data, we postulate that CYP2J9 products play important functional roles in the brain. [α-32P]dATP, [1-14C]arachidonic acid, and [1-14C]linoleic acid were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). PCR reagents including AmpliTaq® DNA polymerase were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. All other chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. An oligo(dT)-primed λgt10 C57B6 mouse brain cDNA library (a gift from Dr. David Burt, University of Maryland) was screened with a radiolabeled 1.6-kb CYP2J8 cDNA fragment (GenBankTM accession number AF218857). Nucleic acid hybridizations were done at 57 °C in 0.9 mNaCl containing 0.05 mNaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 (pH 7.0), 0.5% SDS, 0.01 m EDTA, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 0.1 mg of heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA/ml. Fourteen duplicate positive clones were identified, of which 10 clones, selected at random, were plaque-purified and rescued into pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene). Plasmid DNAs were isolated using a Qiagen Plasmid Purification Kit (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA), and insert sizes were determined by agarose gel electrophoresis after EcoRI digestion. The pBluescript cDNA inserts were partially sequenced on an ABI model 377 automated DNA sequencer using the ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit with AmpliTaq® DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and T3/T7 universal oligonucleotide primers. Nucleotide sequences were analyzed by searching GenBankTM and EMBL data bases utilizing GCG software (Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI). One of the duplicate positive clones (clone WQ24-1, ∼1.8-kb) contained a novel sequence that shared homology with several human and rodent CYP2 family P450s (36Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamataki T. Stegeman J.J. Feyereisen R. Waxman D.J. Waterman M.R. Gotoh O. Coon M.J. Estabrook R.W. Gunsalus I.C. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1996; 6: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (2669) Google Scholar). Based on alignment with other CYP2J subfamily members, it was determined that this clone was missing ∼120 nucleotides at the 5′-end of the cDNA including the start codon. The full-length cDNA was obtained by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends using Mouse Brain Marathon-ReadyTM cDNA (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) and the following gene-specific primer, 5′-GTCTCATTGCACGCACTCTGTGTCACC-3′. The resulting ∼2.0-kb cDNA was gel-purified, cloned into the pCRTM2.1 vector using the Original TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA), and replicated in DH5α-competent Escherichia coli. Ten of the resulting clones contained identical sequences, one of which (clone WQ2J9-7) was completely sequenced utilizing a total of 14 oligonucleotide primers (20–25 nucleotides, each) that spanned the entire length of the sense and antisense cDNA strands. Co-expression of the protein encoded by the cloned 1.958-kb WQ2J9-7 cDNA insert (CYP2J9) with CYPOR in Sf9 insect cells was accomplished with the pAcUW51-CYPOR shuttle vector (kindly provided by Dr. Cosette Serabjit-Singh, GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC) and the BaculoGold Baculovirus Expression System (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) using methods similar to those described previously (37Wu S.

The CYP2J9 cDNA (nucleotides 130–1649) including the entire coding region was amplified by PCR and ligated into a slightly modified pAcUW51-CYPOR vector at the NheI andKpnI sites. The orientation and identity of the resulting expression vector (pAcUW51-CYPOR-CYP2J9) was confirmed by sequence analysis. In this construct, the expression of CYPOR is controlled by the p10 promoter, whereas the expression of CYP2J9 is independently controlled by the polyhedrin promoter. Cultured Sf9cells were co-transfected with the pAcUw51-CYPOR-CYP2J9 vector and linear wild-type BaculoGold viral DNA, and recombinant viruses were purified as described (37Wu S. Chen W. Murphy E. Gabel S. Tomer K.B. Foley J. Steenbergen C. Falck J.R. Moomaw C.R. Zeldin D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12551-12559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 38Ma J. Qu W.

Cultured Sf9 cells grown in spinner flasks at a density of 1.5–2 × 106cells/ml were then infected with high titer CYP2J9-CYPOR recombinant baculovirus stock in the presence of δ-aminolevulinic acid and iron citrate (100 μm each). Cells co-expressing recombinant CYP2J9 and CYPOR were harvested 72 h after infection, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and used to prepare microsomal fractions by differential centrifugation at 4 °C. P450 content was determined spectrally according to the method of Omura and Sato (40Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a Shimadzu UV-3000 dual-wavelength/double-beam spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD). Sf9cells expressing only recombinant CYPOR (no P450) were prepared as described (39Lee C. Kadwell S.H. Kost T.A. Serabjit-Singh C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures containing 0.05 mTris-Cl buffer (pH 7.5), 0.15 m KCl, 0.01 mMgCl2, 8 mm sodium isocitrate, 0.5 IU/ml isocitrate dehydrogenase, CYP2J9-CYPOR-transfectedSf9 cell microsomes (an amount corresponding to 0.1–0.2 nmol P450/ml, final concentration), and [1-14C]arachidonic acid (55–56 μCi/μmole; 100 μm, final concentration) were constantly stirred at 37 °C. After temperature equilibration, NADPH (1 mm, final concentration) was added to initiate the reaction. At different time points (5–20 min, selected to ensure that the quantitative assessment of the rates of product formation reflect initial rates), aliquots were withdrawn, and the reaction products were extracted and analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC as described (37Wu S. Chen W. Murphy E. Gabel S. Tomer K.B. Foley J. Steenbergen C. Falck J.R. Moomaw C.R. Zeldin D.C. J. Biol.

All products were identified by comparing their reverse- and normal-phase HPLC properties with those of authentic EET and HETE standards. In addition, the CYP2J9-derived 19-HETE was analyzed by negative ion chemical ionization GC/MS using methane as the reagent gas as described (41Clare R.A. Huang S. Doig M.V. Gibson G.G. J. Chromatogr. 1991; 562: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 19-HETE was derivatized to the corresponding pentafluorobenzyl (PFB) ester, trimethylsilyl ether, and injected on a ThermoQuest Trace MS equipped with a 30-m Supelco SPB-5 capillary column (0.32 mm inner diameter, 0.25-μm film thickness). The gas chromatograph was programmed from 150 to 300 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min with an initial hold time of 1 min. Both full scan and selected ion monitoring data were collected. For chiral analysis, the EETs and 19-HETE were collected from the HPLC eluent, derivatized to the corresponding PFB or methyl esters, and purified by normal-phase HPLC. The 11,12-EET-PFB, 8,9-EET-PFB, and 14,15-EET-methyl esters were resolved into corresponding antipodes by chiral-phase HPLC and quantified by liquid scintillation as described previously (42Capdevila J.H.

Biochem. 1989; 182: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Chiral analysis of 19-HETE-methyl ester was performed on naphthylated derivatives using a Pirkle covalent d-phenyl glycine column (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm, Regis Chemical Co., Morton Grove, IL) equilibrated with 99.75% hexane, 0.25% isopropyl alcohol at 1 ml/min as described (44Oliw E.H. J. Chromatogr. 1990; 526: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the retention times for authentic (19R)- and (19S)-HETEs are 76 and 80 min, respectively, with a resolution factor of 0.93. Control studies were performed by incubating uninfected Sf9 cell microsomes and baculovirus-infected Sf9 cell microsomes expressing recombinant CYPOR but containing no spectrally evident P450 with arachidonic acid under identical conditions. In some experiments, [1-14C]linoleic acid (55 μCi/μmol; 100 μm, final concentration) was substituted for [1-14C]arachidonic acid, and the products were identified by co-elution with authentic hydroxyoctadecenoic acid and epoxyoctadecenoic acid standards on reverse-phase HPLC. Microsomal fractions were prepared from freshly isolated mouse brains by differential centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-Cl buffer (pH 7.4), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol. Reaction mixtures containing 0.05 m Tris-Cl buffer (pH 7.5), 0.15m KCl, 0.01 m MgCl2, 8 mm sodium isocitrate, 0.5 IU/ml isocitrate dehydrogenase, 1 mm NADPH, 5 mg of brain microsomal protein/ml, and 100 μm [1-14C]arachidonic acid were incubated at 37 °C for 30–90 min. Reaction products were extracted and analyzed by HPLC as described (37Wu S. Chen W. Murphy E. Gabel S. Tomer K.B. Foley J. Steenbergen C. Falck J.R. Moomaw C.R. Zeldin D.C. J. Biol.

All products were identified by comparing their reverse- and normal-phase HPLC properties with those of authentic EET and HETE standards. Normal mouse tissues (lung, brain, liver, kidney, spleen, heart, stomach, small intestine, colon, and testes) were obtained from adult male and female C57BL/6J mice fed NIH 31 rodent chow (Agway, St. Mary, OH)ad libitum and sacrificed by lethal CO2inhalation. For some experiments, the brain was subdivided into the following anatomic sections using conventional morphologic criteria as follows: cerebellum, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, hypothalamus, midbrain, brainstem, and pituitary. RNA was prepared using TRIreagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Northern analysis, total RNA (20 μg) was denatured and electrophoresed in 1.2% agarose gels containing 2.2 m formaldehyde as described (45Maniatis T. Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After capillary-pressure transfer to Hybond-N+ membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the blots were hybridized with the cloned 1.958-kb CYP2J9 cDNA insert. Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C in 50% formamide containing 0.7 m NaCl, 70 mm sodium citrate, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 0.1 mg of heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA/ml. The cDNA probe was labeled with [α-32P]dATP using the MegaprimeTM DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and purified using G-50 Sephadex columns (Stratagene). Northern blot results were confirmed by PCR amplification of reverse-transcribed mouse RNAs using the GeneAmp® RNA PCR kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The following CYP2J9 sequence-specific oligonucleotides were used: forward primer, 5′-CAACCTAACTGCACTGCACAG-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 1403–1423 of the CYP2J9 cDNA; reverse primer, 5′-GGCTTTCTACTTACTGAACCC-3′, complementary to nucleotides 1834–1854 of the CYP2J9 cDNA. Reverse transcription was performed with 1 μg of total RNA in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 μm random hexamers, 1 mm each of dGTP, dATP, dTTP, and dCTP, and 50 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase incubated at 42 °C for 15 min. The PCR amplifications were performed in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2, 0.15 μmforward and reverse primers, and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq® DNA polymerase. Following an initial incubation for 120 s at 95 °C, samples were subjected to 30 cycles of 25 s at 95 °C, 45 s at 64 °C, and 45 s at 72 °C, followed by a final 7-min incubation at 72 °C. The PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. As a positive control, clone WQ2J9-7 (CYP2J9) was substituted for the first strand products. Negative controls included omission of RNA, omission of primers, and use of CYP2J5, CYP2J6, CYP2J7, and CYP2J8 cDNAs as the template. The following β-actin sequence-specific primers were used to control for the quality and amount of RNA: forward primer, 5′-GAGCTATGAGCTGCCTGACG-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 776–795 of the mouse β-actin cDNA; reverse primer, 5′-AGCACTTGCGGTGCACGATG-3′, complementary to nucleotides 1166–1185 of the mouse β-actin cDNA. Following electrophoresis, gels were scanned using a ChemiImager 4000 Imaging System (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA), and relative P450 mRNA levels were determined by normalization to the β-actin signal. Lysates were prepared from frozen mouse (3-day to 7-month postnatal) cerebellum, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, hypothalamus, midbrain, and brainstem by homogenization in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm NaF, 0.25 mphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, and 100 mm Na3VO4.

Once produced, SOCS-3 binds to phosphorylated tyrosine 960 of the insulin receptor and inhibits insulin signaling. Now we show that in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and in transfected COS-7 cells insulin leads to SOCS-3 tyrosine phosphorylation. This phosphorylation takes place on Tyr204 and is dependent upon a functional SOCS-3 SH2 domain. Purified insulin receptor directly phosphorylates SOCS-3. However, in intact cells, a mutant of the insulin receptor, IRY960F, unable to bind SOCS-3, was as efficient as the wild type insulin receptor to phosphorylate SOCS-3. Importantly, IRY960F is as potent as the wild type insulin receptor to activate janus-activated kinase (Jak) 1 and Jak2. Furthermore, expression of a dominant negative form of Jak2 inhibits insulin-induced SOCS-3 tyrosine phosphorylation. As transfected Jaks have been shown to cause SOCS-3 phosphorylation, we propose that insulin induces SOCS-3 phosphorylation through Jak activation.

Later on, it appeared that these docking proteins are also phosphorylated in response to several cytokines (2White M.F. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1998; 53: 119-138PubMed Google Scholar).

Generally speaking, this inhibition can be mediated by the following mechanisms: (i) a direct association and inhibition of the Jak and/or (ii) the association of the SOCS with a tyrosine-phosphorylated cytokine receptor, leading to a competitive inhibition with SH2 domain-containing molecules, such as the Stats (13Krebs D.

Mice lacking SOCS-2 grow significantly larger than their wild type littermates (18Metcalf D. Greenhalgh C. Viney E. Willson T. Starr R. Nicola N. Hilton D. Alexander W.

Originally the SOCS were found to be induced by ligands acting through receptors belonging to the cytokine receptor family, such as LIF, IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, interferon γ, GH, and leptin (13Krebs D. Hilton D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1819-2813Google Scholar, 14Chen X. Losman J. Rothman P. Immunity. 2000; 13: 287-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We have shown that insulin induces SOCS-3 expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (1Emanuelli B. Peraldi P. Filloux C. Sawka-Verhelle D. Hilton D. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15958-15991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Moreover, insulin leads to translocation of SOCS-3 from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane, where it colocalizes with the insulin receptor. The interaction with the receptor happens through the SH2 domain of SOCS-3 and the phosphorylated tyrosine 960 of the insulin receptor. Because Stat5B binds to a domain containing this residue (4Sawka-Verhelle D. Filloux C. Tartare-Decker S. Mothe I. Van Obberghen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), SOCS-3 was found to inhibit insulin-induced Stat5B activation. These data suggested to us that SOCS-3 was not only a partner of cytokine signaling but that it also interferes with insulin signal generation. To further characterize the functional links between the insulin receptor and SOCS-3 we investigated whether insulin leads to SOCS-3 tyrosine phosphorylation. We show that insulin induces SOCS-3 tyrosine phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and in transfected COS-7 cells. This phosphorylation takes place on tyrosine 204 of SOCS-3 and necessitates a functional SOCS-3 SH2 domain. Although in vitro the insulin receptor directly phosphorylates SOCS-3, we found that in intact cells, insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation is mediated by the Jaks. Therefore, SOCS-3 belongs to a novel class of distal receptor substrates that are tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to insulin, independently of a direct coupling with the insulin receptor but dependent on cytosolic kinases such as the Jaks. SOCS-3 antibodies were produced by Eurogentech (Herstal, Belgium) using a peptide corresponding to the N-terminal sequence of SOCS-3 (SKFPAAGMSRPLDTSLR). This sequence is specific for SOCS-3 and is not found in the other known SOCS (9Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kiguchi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Hara T. Miyajima A.

The antibodies were tested for their ability to recognize specifically SOCS-3 by immunoprecipitation and by Western blotting (data not shown). Antibodies to Jak1, Jak2, and insulin receptor were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD). They were grown and differentiated into adipocytes as described previously (20Garcia de Herreros A. Birnbaum M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19994-19999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). COS-7 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. 3T3-L1 and COS-7 calls were starved overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.2% bovine serum albumin (w/v) before use. COS-7 cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran procedure as described (21Maniatis T. Fritsch E. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1642-1644Google Scholar). Cells were lysed 36 or 48 h after transfection. The human insulin receptor cDNA was obtained from A. Ullrich (Martinsreid, Germany) and subcloned in pCDNA3. SOCS-3 cDNA, subcloned in pEF, have been described previously (22Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A. Farley A. Starr R. Zhang J.G. Baca M.

The dominant negative Jak2Δ8 cloned in pCDNA3 was described elsewhere (23Gual P. Baron V. Lequoy V. Van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 884-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Blunt-ended SOCS-3 cDNA was inserted in-frame with the GST cDNA present in pGex-3X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) blunted after an EcoRI digestion and filled in by the Klenow fragment. GST and GST-SOCS-3 were produced according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Point mutations (SOCS-3 Y204F and SOCS-3 R71K) were produced using the Quickchange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. All constructions were verified by sequencing. Partially purified insulin receptors (24Van Obberghen E. Kasuga M. Le Cam A. Hedo J.A. Itin A. Harrison L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 1052-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) were incubated with insulin (10−7m) for 45 min at room temperature in (30 mmHepes, pH 7.2, 30 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100) and incubated with GST-SOCS-3 or GST alone adsorbed on Sepharose beads. The phosphorylation reaction was initiated by adding 15 mm[γ-32P]ATP, 8 mm MnCl2, and 4 mm MgCl2. After 30 min beads were washed twice in 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 30 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Laemmli buffer was added, and proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. After appropriate treatments cells were rinsed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in stop buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 150 mmNaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 2 mmNa3VO4, 100 mm NaF, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μm leupeptin, 0.18 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine). SOCS-3 was immunoprecipitated, and the obtained proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions on an 11% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and Western blot analyses were performed. As we have previously shown that SOCS-3 participates in the insulin signaling network (1Emanuelli B. Peraldi P. Filloux C. Sawka-Verhelle D. Hilton D. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15958-15991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (384) Google Scholar), we investigated whether SOCS-3 was phosphorylated in response to the hormone. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding SOCS-3 and the insulin receptor. Cells were treated for 5 min with 10−10 to 10−6m insulin or for 0 to 300 min with 10−7m insulin. Cells were lysed, and SOCS-3 was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by Western blot using antibody to phosphotyrosine. In parallel, cell lysates were analyzed for SOCS-3 expression and insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig.1). As observed, insulin induces an increase in SOCS-3 tyrosine phosphorylation. This phosphorylation was detectable after a treatment with 10−9m of insulin and reached a maximum at 10−7m. Thus, it appears that SOCS-3 phosphorylation occurs at physiologically relevant insulin concentration and with kinetics compatible with insulin action. Phosphorylation was observed after 5 min of insulin treatment and maintained a plateau of phosphorylation for at least 150 min. In all conditions tested SOCS-3 tyrosine phosphorylation paralleled that of the insulin receptor. We then tested whether purified insulin receptor phosphorylates SOCS-3. GST or GST-SOCS-3 were incubated with various amounts of purified insulin receptors in the presence of a phosphorylation mixture containing [γ-32P]ATP. After 30 min, phosphorylation of GST and GST-SOCS-3 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography (Fig.2). In the absence of insulin receptor, GST was phosphorylated by contaminating bacterial kinases. This contaminating phosphorylation was unaffected by addition of increasing doses of insulin receptors, indicating that GST is not a substrate of the insulin receptor. When GST-SOCS-3 was incubated in the presence of increasing amounts of insulin receptor, its phosphorylation intensified, indicating that SOCS-3 can be phosphorylated by purified insulin receptors. Using yeast two-hybrid experiments we have previously shown that SOCS-3 interacts directly with the phosphotyrosine 960 of the insulin receptor (1Emanuelli B. Peraldi P. Filloux C. Sawka-Verhelle D. Hilton D. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15958-15991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (384) Google Scholar). This view was supported by confocal microscopy illustrating that, upon insulin stimulation, SOCS-3 and insulin receptor colocalize at the cell membrane. This interaction is strictly dependent on the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor tyrosine 960 both in the yeast two-hybrid system and in intact cells. Therefore, we compared the ability of a wild type insulin receptor (IRWT) and of the IRY960F mutant (unable to bind to SOCS-3) to induce SOCS-3 tyrosine phosphorylation. As a control, we compared the phosphorylation of IRS-1 in cells expressing insulin receptor or IRY960F. COS-7 cells were transfected with IRWT or IRY960F and with SOCS-3 or with IRS-1. Cells were treated with insulin and lysed. SOCS-3 or IRS-1 were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates and analyzed by anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot (Fig.3). Controls for the expression of the various transfected proteins and for the tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptors were performed. As previously observed, insulin induces SOCS-3 tyrosine phosphorylation in cells expressing IRWT. Unexpectedly, the insulin-induced SOCS-3 phosphorylation was unaltered in cells expressing IRY960F. In contrast, IRS-1 was less phosphorylated in cells expressing IRY960F compared with cells expressing IRWT, indicating that IRY960F behaves as anticipated for IRS-1 (25White M.F. Livingstone J.N. Backer J.M. Lauris V. Dull T.J. Ullrich A. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 641-649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The remaining level of IRS-1 phosphorylation could be because of endogenous IGF-I receptor or because of the phosphorylation of IRS-1 by Jak (see “Discussion”). To summarize, although insulin receptor phosphorylates SOCS-3 in vitro, and although SOCS-3 binds to the insulin receptor through phosphotyrosine 960, SOCS-3 does not have to associate with the insulin receptor to be phosphorylated on tyrosine. The Jak kinases appeared to be likely candidates for this insulin-induced SOCS-3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Indeed, it has been shown that (i) SOCS-3 interacts directly with Jak1 and Jak2 through its SH2 domain (26Suzuki R. Sakamoto H. Yasukawa H. Masuhara M. Wakioka T. Sasaki A. Yuge K. Komiya S. Inoue A. Yoshimura A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2271-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 27Cohney S.J. Sanden D. Cacalano N.A. Yoshimura A. Mui A. Migone T.S. Johnston J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4980-4988Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), (ii) these two cytosolic tyrosine kinases induce SOCS-3 tyrosine phosphorylation (27Cohney S.J. Sanden D. Cacalano N.A. Yoshimura A. Mui A. Migone T.S. Johnston J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4980-4988Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and (iii) insulin activates Jak1 and Jak2 (7Giorgetti-Peraldi S. Peyrade F. Baron V. Van Obberghen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 8Saad M.J. Carvalho C.R. Thirone A.C. Velloso L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22100-22104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23Gual P. Baron V. Lequoy V. Van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 884-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, the ability of IRY960F to stimulate the Jak is not established. To address this issue, we transfected COS-7 cells with IRWT or IRY960F. Cells were treated or not with insulin, and endogenous Jaks were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by antiphosphotyrosine Western blot (Fig. 4). As shown, insulin treatment of cells expressing IRWT and IRY960F induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 and Jak2 to comparable levels. Because it has been reported that the autophosphorylation of the Jaks in response to insulin parallel their tyrosine kinase activity toward substrates (23Gual P. Baron V. Lequoy V. Van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 884-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), our observations indicate that Jak1 and Jak2 are activated by insulin independently of the phosphorylation of insulin receptor Tyr960. We then tested the effect of the expression of a dominant negative form of Jak2 (Jak2Δ8) on insulin-induced SOCS-3 tyrosine phosphorylation. This mutant Jak2Δ8 is a construct mutated within the type VIII phosphotransferase motif of the C-terminal protein-tyrosine kinase domain and has been described previously (28Zhuang H. Patel S.V. He T.C. Sonsteby S.K. Niu Z. Wojchowski D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21411-21414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding insulin receptor, SOCS-3, and various amounts of Jak2Δ8. Cells were treated with insulin, and SOCS-3 was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by antiphosphotyrosine Western blot (Fig.5). Whole cell lysates were used to verify insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and SOCS-3 expression. As shown, insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SOCS-3 was inhibited by increasing amounts of Jak2Δ8. Jak2Δ8 did not modify insulin-induced insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation or SOCS-3 expression. Together these results suggest that insulin causes SOCS-3 tyrosine phosphorylation through Jak activation. Next we explored in more detail the insulin-produced SOCS-3 tyrosine phosphorylation. As SOCS-3 binds to Jak through its SH2 domain, we studied the involvement of SOCS-3 SH2 domain in the insulin-induced SOCS-3 tyrosine phosphorylation. We also investigated which tyrosine of SOCS-3 is phosphorylated. To do so, we produced an SH2-defective mutant of SOCS-3 (R71K) in which Arg71, crucial for the binding of the phosphorylated tyrosine residue, has been replaced by a Lys. We also prepared several tyrosine to phenylalanine mutants of SOCS-3, but we will discuss only Y204F for reasons that will become obvious later on. COS-7 cells were transfected with insulin receptor and with wild type SOCS-3, SOCS-3 Y204F, or SOCS-3 (R71K). Cells were treated or not with insulin, and SOCS-3 was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by antiphosphotyrosine Western blot (Fig. 6). In parallel, the quantity of SOCS-3 and the tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor were verified using specific antibodies. As previously observed, insulin induces SOCS-3 tyrosine phosphorylation. When SOCS-3 was mutated on Y204, its tyrosine phosphorylation was nearly undetectable. With the SOCS-3 (R71K) mutant no phosphorylation was detected at all. These data indicate that, in response to insulin, SOCS-3 is phosphorylated on Y204 in a manner dependent on a functional SOCS-3 SH2 domain. We used 3T3-L1 adipocytes to determine whether the hormone induces tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous SOCS-3. As SOCS-3 is not expressed in these cells under basal conditions, we studied its expression after LIF treatment. Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated for 1 to 4 h with LIF. SOCS-3 was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by Western blot using antibodies to SOCS-3 (Fig. 7 A). SOCS-3 was not detected in untreated cells, but was induced after 1 h of LIF treatment. After 2 h the expression decreases and dropped to non-detectable levels after 4 h. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated for 1 h with LIF and for various times with insulin. SOCS-3 was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by antiphosphotyrosine Western blot (Fig. 7 B). A 1-h treatment with LIF induces SOCS-3 protein expression and its weak tyrosine phosphorylation. This tyrosine phosphorylation was further increased by insulin. It was observed as soon as 2.5 min after treatment and appeared to reach a plateau within 7.5 min. We next investigated whether insulin-produced SOCS-3 tyrosine phosphorylation was specific for SOCS-3 induced by LIF. 3T3L1 adipocytes were treated for 2, 4, and 6 h with insulin alone or pretreated for 1 h with LIF or GH and then stimulated with insulin. SOCS-3 was imunoprecipitated and analyzed by antiphosphotyrosine or by anti-SOCS-3 Western blot (Fig.7 C). Treatment with LIF and GH induced comparable levels of SOCS-3 expression. Insulin leads to SOCS-3 expression after 2 and 4 h of treatment, but after 6 h the expression becomes nearly undetectable. LIF and GH alone produce a weak increase in SOCS-3 tyrosine phosphorylation. In both conditions this basal phosphorylation is further increased after insulin treatment. Exposure of cells to insulin alone leads also to SOCS-3 tyrosine phosphorylation. This phosphorylation reached a maximum within 2 h of treatment and decreased after 4 h, although SOCS-3 expression was maintained at this time. We conclude that in 3T3-L1 adipocytes endogenous SOCS-3 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to insulin. We have previously presented evidence for the idea that SOCS-3 is a component of the insulin signaling network (1Emanuelli B. Peraldi P. Filloux C. Sawka-Verhelle D. Hilton D. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15958-15991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Indeed, insulin induces SOCS-3 mRNA expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In addition, insulin leads to the translocation of SOCS-3 from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane where it colocalizes with the insulin receptor. This interaction with the receptor could be a mean for desensitization of insulin signaling, because we have shown that SOCS-3 inhibits insulin-dependent Stat5B activation. Here we show that insulin leads to SOCS-3 tyrosine phosphorylation in transfected COS-7 cells and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes after induction of endogenous SOCS-3. Interestingly, it would appear that in intact cells SOCS-3 does not have to be coupled directly to the insulin receptor to be phosphorylated on tyrosine. This is in apparent contradiction with our observation that purified insulin receptor phosphorylates SOCS-3 and that SOCS-3 binds to the insulin receptor phosphotyrosine 960. Indeed, using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have shown that SOCS-3 binds through its SH2 domain to the phosphotyrosine 960 of the insulin receptor (1Emanuelli B. Peraldi P. Filloux C. Sawka-Verhelle D. Hilton D. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15958-15991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Further, in cells expressing a mutant of the receptor (IRY960F), which does not bind SOCS-3, insulin does not modify the cytoplasmic localization of SOCS-3. However, insulin-induced SOCS-3 tyrosine phosphorylation in cells expressing IRY960F is comparable with that seen in cells expressing wild type insulin receptor (Fig. 3). This observation is intriguing, because most recognized substrates of the insulin receptor, such as the IRS, Shc, and Gab, have to be coupled to the insulin receptor to be phosphorylated on tyrosine (29Virkamaki A. Ueki K. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 30White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). This interaction can be direct, through the phosphotyrosine binding domain of the IRS and Shc to tyrosine 960 of the insulin receptor or through the IRS-2 kinase regulatory binding domain to the so-called regulatory loop domain of insulin receptor (31Sawka-Verhelle D. Tartare-Deckert S. White M.F. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5980-5983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The coupling can also be indirect through the plekstrin homology domain of IRS and Gab-1 (32Burks D.J. Pons S. Towery H. Smith-Hall J. Myers M.G. Yenush L. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27716-27721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 33Rocchi S. Tartare-Deckert S. Murdaca J. Holgado-Madruga M. Wong A.J. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 914-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These plekstrin homology domains may bind acidic peptide motifs in membrane proteins or phospholipids that link substrates to activated cell surface insulin receptors (34Burks D.J. Wang J. Towery H. Ishibashi O. Lowe D. Riedel H. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31061-31067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Differently from these proximal substrates, SOCS-3 does not require to be localized to the cell membrane and coupled with the insulin receptor to be phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to insulin. Therefore, it is likely that in intact cells, the insulin receptor does not directly phosphorylate SOCS-3 but utilizes an intermediary tyrosine kinase for this to be achieved. Several experimental observations indicate that the Jaks are the kinases involved. First, it has already been reported that the Jaks are activated in response to insulin. This was observed originally in cells overexpressing insulin receptors (7Giorgetti-Peraldi S. Peyrade F. Baron V. Van Obberghen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and later confirmed in intact rats where injection of insulin stimulates Jak2 in liver, muscle, and adipose tissue (8Saad M.J. Carvalho C.R. Thirone A.C. Velloso L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22100-22104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This activation is probably linked to a coupling of the Jak to the insulin receptor. Indeed, using GST fusion proteins and coimmunoprecipitation experiments, our laboratory showed that the Jaks interact directly with the insulin receptor (23Gual P. Baron V. Lequoy V. Van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 884-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This interaction involves two domains of Jak1, one located in its N terminus and the other located in its C terminus, and necessitates a phosphorylated insulin receptor. Second, it has also been already observed that ectopic expression of Jak1 or Jak2 induces SOCS-3 tyrosine phosphorylation (27Cohney S.J. Sanden D. Cacalano N.A. Yoshimura A. Mui A. Migone T.S. Johnston J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4980-4988Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). This can be correlated with the direct association between the Jak and SOCS-3 (26Suzuki R. Sakamoto H. Yasukawa H. Masuhara M. Wakioka T. Sasaki A. Yuge K. Komiya S. Inoue A. Yoshimura A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2271-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 27Cohney S.J. Sanden D. Cacalano N.A. Yoshimura A. Mui A. Migone T.S. Johnston J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4980-4988Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we show that a mutant of SOCS-3 defective in its SH2 domain is not phosphorylated in response to insulin, probably because (as previously reported) it can not bind to Jak (26Suzuki R. Sakamoto H. Yasukawa H. Masuhara M. Wakioka T. Sasaki A. Yuge K. Komiya S. Inoue A. Yoshimura A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2271-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Third, both wild type insulin receptor and IRY960F cause a comparable phosphorylation of Jak1 and Jak2, which is in agreement with the ability of these two receptors to induce SOCS-3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Fourth, the use of a dominant negative Jak2 mutant showed that the Jaks are necessary to mediate insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SOCS-3 (Fig. 5). Such kinase-dead Jak2 mutants have previously been reported to inhibit the effect of both Jak1 and Jak2 on Stat3 activation by IGF-I, for example (35Zong C.S. Chan J. Levy D.E. Horvath C. Sadowski H.B. Wang L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15099-15105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Therefore, we would like to suggest that insulin stimulates the Jaks in a manner independent of the phosphorylation of insulin receptor tyrosine 960. Once activated, some of the Jak molecules would translocate to the cytoplasm, capture the SOCS-3 through binding to their SH2 domain, and then phosphorylate the SOCS-3. Schematically speaking, it would appear that SOCS-3 can interfere at different levels in insulin signaling. Indeed, we found earlier that SOCS-3 inhibits insulin-induced Stat5 activation probably by competing for the same phosphotyrosine 960 on the receptor (1Emanuelli B. Peraldi P. Filloux C. Sawka-Verhelle D. Hilton D. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15958-15991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Here we show that insulin leads to SOCS-3 tyrosine phosphorylation. It is likely that this phosphorylation has an impact on insulin signaling. We did not detect a striking difference in the subcellular localization of SOCS-3 and SOCS-3 Y204F, before or after insulin treatment, and both molecules inhibit insulin-induced Stat-5B activation in a similar manner (data not shown). However, SOCS-3 Tyr204 is located in close vicinity to the consensus elonginBC (the complex of elongin B and elongin C) binding site (36Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin W.J. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 37Zhang J.G. Farley A. Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A. Zugaro L.M. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Cary D. Richardson R.

Because the function of the association between SOCS-3 and eloginBC (the complex of elongin B and elongin C) is still a matter of debate, it is difficult to predict the effect of SOCS-3 tyrosine phosphorylation on this event (36Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin W.J. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 37Zhang J.G. Farley A. Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A. Zugaro L.M. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Cary D. Richardson R. Hausmann G. Kile B.J. Kent S.B. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Baca M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2071-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). It can also be envisioned that SOCS-3 tyrosine phosphorylation may create binding sites for SH2-containing molecules. SOCS-3 would be then able to create a bridge between the insulin receptor and a SH2-containing molecules. This would be reminiscent of Shp-2, which binds to the platelet-derived growth factor receptor through its SH2 domain and to Grb2 through its phosphorylated tyrosine (38Li W. Nishimura R. Kashishian A. Batzer A.G. Kim W.J.H. Cooper J.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 509-517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This docking function of SOCS-3 could be occurring when SOCS-3 is in the cytosol. After its translocation to the cell surface SOCS-3 could function as a cargo bringing proteins in vicinity to the insulin receptor. SOCS-3, located at the cell surface, could modify the functioning of the insulin receptor by docking proteins. Our observations add weight to the role of the Jaks in insulin signaling. Indeed, although the Jaks have been shown to induce IRS-1 and IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation, their relative contribution to this process, compared with the direct phosphorylation of IRS by the insulin receptor, is thought to be small. This view comes from the finding that mutation of the insulin receptor on tyrosine 960 leads to a decrease in insulin-induced IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation (25White M.F. Livingstone J.N. Backer J.M. Lauris V. Dull T.J. Ullrich A. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 641-649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). However, it can be noted that as shown in Fig. 3 (and as observed by other authors) some insulin-induced IRS-1 phosphorylation is still detectable in cells expressing IRY960F (39Chen D. Van Horn D.J. White M.F. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4711-4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 40Yenush L. Makati K.J. Smith-Hall J. Ishibashi O. Myers M.G. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24300-24306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This remaining phosphorylation could be because of the Jaks. Because we have shown earlier that the phosphopeptide maps of IRS-1 phosphorylated in vitro by insulin receptor versus Jak1 are different (23Gual P. Baron V. Lequoy V. Van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 884-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), it is tempting to think that the docking function of IRS-1 will also differ and consequently so will its signaling potential. In summary, to the best of our knowledge, SOCS-3 appears as the first example of a protein tyrosine phosphorylated in intact cells in response to insulin in a fashion that is entirely Jak-dependent. However, it is possible that other proteins share this property. Several substrates of the insulin receptor (such as Tub; see Ref. 41Kapeller R. Moriarty A. Strauss A. Stubdal H. Theriault K. Siebert E. Chickering T. Morgenstern J.P. Tartaglia L.A. Lillie J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24980-24986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) have been proposed to be direct substrates of the insulin receptor based on their phosphorylation by purified insulin receptors. Considering our present work the possible implication of the Jaks should be evaluated. Finally, it is tempting to suggest that insulin uses the Jak activity not only to modulate its action through SOCS-3 but also to generate specific biological responses.

By monitoring Pi release, we explored the relationship between the ATPase activity and polymerization characteristics of a mutant yeast actin, GG. In this mutant, two hydrophobic residues at the tip of a proposed hydrophobic plug between actin subdomains 3 and 4, Val266and Leu267, were mutated to Gly. Although GG-actin does not polymerize by itself in vitro, GG cells are viable. We show that GG-actin ATPase activity increases under normal polymerization conditions, although stable filaments do not form. A plot of Pi release rate versus actin concentration yields an apparent critical concentration, like that seen for actin polymerization, of ∼8 μm for Mg2+GG-actin and 11 μm for Ca2+ GG-actin. In contrast to WT-actin, Pi release from GG-actin is cold-sensitive, reflecting the temperature sensitivity associated with mutations that decrease hydrophobicity in this region. Thus, under polymerization conditions, GG-actin exhibits a continuous F-actin-like ATPase activity resulting from the temperature-sensitive formation of unstable cycling F-actin oligomers. Tropomyosin limits the extent and rate of this activity and restores polymerization by capturing and stabilizing these oligomers rather than enhancing filament nucleation.

This activity is greatly enhanced by polymerization of the actin (1Carlier M.F. Adv. Biophys. 1990; 26: 51-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For those actins studied to date, hydrolysis occurs shortly after the incorporation of the actin monomer into the filament producing an ADP-Pi species, which slowly loses its Pi to yield an ADP-monomer. Because ATP and ADP-Pi F-actin are both more stable than ADP-F-actin, this Pi release is believed to play a major role in the treadmilling of actin filaments that occurs within the cell. Actin polymerization is a multiple-step process that includes a salt-induced G to F conformational change, rate-determining nucleation, and filament elongation until the monomer actin concentration reaches a limiting value called the critical concentration. Prior to incorporation of the actin monomer into the filament, it has been hypothesized that the actin proceeds through an F-monomer state (2Rich S.A. Estes J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 777-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Evidence for such a species derives from experiments such as comparing protease digestion patterns of the actin in the absence and presence of polymerization-inducing salts at actin concentrations below the critical concentration of actin needed for formation of filaments. Using muscle actin, Shu et al. (3Shu W.P. Wang D. Stracher A. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) determined that the F-monomer exhibits a low ATPase activity similar to that observed with G-monomer, suggesting that the enhanced ATPase activity associated with actin polymerization requires the conformation and inter-monomer contacts formed within the context of the actin filament. We have previously created a mutant actin (GG-actin) in which we simultaneously converted Val266 and Leu267 to glycines (4Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4412-4418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 5Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1237-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These residues along with Leu269 reside in the tip of a loop between actin subdomains 3 and 4. Holmes and co-workers (6Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar) proposed that one major interstrand force stabilizing the actin filament was a “plug-pocket” interaction in which the tip of this loop interacts with a hydrophobic surface formed by the interface of two monomers on the opposing strand. In agreement with the predictions of this model, we have demonstrated that, as assessed by a change in light scattering, purified GG-actin alone fails to polymerize under normal polymerization conditions. The actin binding proteins tropomyosin (7Wen K.K. Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40594-40600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and fimbrin (8Cheng D. Marner J. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35873-35880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) can rescue GG-actin polymerization. However, this rescue is temperature-sensitive. In the presence of tropomyosin or fimbrin, polymerization of GG-actin occurs only at a temperature higher than 15 °C. Furthermore, when the temperature is lowered after polymerization reaches the steady state, depolymerization of actin filaments occurs. The polymerization defect exhibited by GG-actin and the cold-sensitive rescue of GG-actin polymerization are consistent with the Holmes model. If the model is correct, removal of two hydrophobic residues at the tip of the plug should greatly decrease the proposed hydrophobic cross-strand interaction, leading to polymer instability of the mutant actin. Tropomyosin or fimbrin binding may strengthen intermonomer contacts along one strand partially compensating for the loss of cross-strand stabilization to the point that polymerization at 25 °C is restored. However, hydrophobic interactions are destabilized by colder temperatures (9Privalov P.L. Gill S.J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1988; 39: 191-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). Thus, at low temperatures, the residual cross-strand interaction of the mutant actin is reduced to such an extent that the extra stabilization can no longer compensate, and filament formation cannot occur. Although GG-actin has been used as a model system for examining the filament-stabilizing abilities of actin-binding proteins (7Wen K.K. Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40594-40600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 8Cheng D. Marner J. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35873-35880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the specific mechanism responsible for the polymerization defect associated with GG-actin is unclear. For example, it is not known whether GG-actin remains in its G form under normal polymerization conditions, is converted to an F-actin monomer, or actually forms transient unstable F-actin oligomers. To understand the mechanisms by which this rescue of GG-actin polymerization occurs, it is necessary to first understand the nature of the polymerization defect. To explore these alternatives, we have assessed in this paper the effect of F buffer1 on the ATPase activity exhibited by GG-actin and the dependence of this activity on actin concentration and temperature. We have also determined the effect of temperature on the ATPase activity of WT yeast actin under polymerizing conditions. Purification of wild-type and GG-actins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was done by a combination of DNase I affinity chromatography and DEAE-cellulose chromatography as previously described (10Cook R.K. Blake W.T. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9430-9436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Affinity columns were made with DNase I purchased from Worthington and Affi-Gel 10 obtained from Bio-Rad Laboratories. Purified Ca2+/G-actin was stored at 4 °C in Ca2+/G buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mmCaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, and 0.5 mm DTT) and used within 4 days. Actin polymerization was induced by the addition of 2 mmMgCl2 and 50 mm KCl to a G-actin solution in G buffer (F buffer). Reactions of a total volume of 120 μl were followed in the thermostatted cuvette chamber of a fluorescence spectrometer. The increase in light-scattering caused by polymerization was monitored with the excitation and emission wavelengths set at 360 nm. For studies with the Mg2+ form of actin, purified Ca2+-actin was converted into the Mg2+ form by treatment with 0.2 mm EGTA in the presence of 0.1 mm MgCl2 at 4 °C for 10 min using a modification of a previously published procedure (11Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Mg2+-G-actin was used immediately after the conversion from Ca2+/G-actin. Release of inorganic phosphate from actin was quantitated by the Enzchek phosphate assay. This assay employs a kit obtained from Molecular Probes and is based on the Pi-dependent liberation of 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine from methyl-thioguanine, a nucleoside derivative of this base, by a purine nucleoside phosphorylase. The product base has a characteristic UV spectrum, not evident when part of a nucleoside, which can be utilized to monitor its phosphate-dependent rate of release by the enzyme. Each reaction mixture contained actin at the desired concentration as specified by the manufacturer, 2 units/ml purine nucleoside phosphorylase, and 200 μm methyl-thioguanine riboside. Pi release from actin in F buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm DTT, 2 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm KCl) or in Mg2+-G buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm MgCl2) was monitored continuously by the increase in absorbance at 360 nm. Phosphate standard curves were generated for each assay. Bovine cardiac tropomyosin was purified from cardiac acetone powder according to the procedure of Butters et al. (12Butters C.A. Willadsen K.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15565-15570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). G-actin in G buffer was centrifuged through a micro Bio-Spin chromatography column (Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated with DTT-free G buffer to remove remaining DTT, and the eluted G-actin was diluted to 20 μm with DTT-free G buffer. 20 μl of 20 μm actin was then incubated at 25 °C for 10 min with or without the addition of 2 mmMgCl2 and 50 mm KCl. A stock solution of 5 mmN,N′-1,4-phenylenedimaleimide (PDM) in dimethylformamide was freshly diluted 10 times with DTT-free G buffer, and 1 μl of PDM was added into the 20-μl actin solution followed by an additional 8-min incubation. The final ratio of PDM to actin was about 1:1. The cross-linking was quenched by the addition of 20 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer containing 20% β-mercaptoethanol. The presence of cross-linked actin oligomers was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. We first determined whether increasing the ionic strength to that normally used to induce actin polymerization enhances the ATPase activity of GG-actin by comparing Pirelease from GG-actin under polymerization (F buffer) and monomeric (G buffer) conditions. Fig. 1 shows the time-dependent release of Pi from GG-actin with or without the addition of 2 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm KCl. Monomeric GG-actin exhibited a Pirelease curve similar to that of WT actin. Addition of 2 mmMgCl2 and 50 mm KCl, which induces polymerization of WT-actin, did not do so with GG-actin as judged by a lack of change in light scattering and the absence of filaments in samples examined by electron microscopy (5Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1237-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, the rate of Pi release from GG-actin in F buffer increased 4-fold compared with that in G buffer. To explore the mechanism behind this enhanced GG-actin ATPase activity in the presence of F buffer, we first measured the continuous release of Pi from WT-actin to which F salts had been added. Our results demonstrate (see Fig. 6) that Pi release from WT-actin closely mirrors its polymerization curve reaching a plateau when F-actin formation reaches equilibrium. We next measured Pi release by Mg2+-GG-actin at different concentrations under polymerization conditions (Fig.2A). At low concentrations, a continuous slow monophasic Pi release occurred. However, at higher actin concentrations, Pi release by GG-actin appeared to be biphasic: a lag phase and a linear fast release phase with no plateau. We observed the same behavior with Ca2+/GG-actin, showing that this behavior, at least qualitatively, was independent of the nature of the tightly bound divalent cation (Fig. 2B).Figure 2Effect of actin concentration on GG-actin ATPase activity. To different concentrations of GG-actin in G buffer were added 2 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm KCl, and Pi release was monitored continuously by the Enzchek phosphate assay.

This experiment was repeated with two different preparations of actin with essentially similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) This type of concentration-dependent Pi release by GG-actin resembles a critical concentration curve determination for actin polymerization, suggesting that GG-actin might form unstable oligomers leading to abortive polymerization. For both cations, we thus plotted the rate of Pi release by determining the slopes of the linear second phase of each curve as a function of actin concentration (Fig. 3). This plot exhibited two linear phases as a function of actin concentration, and the intersection of the two lines yielded an apparent critical concentration for enhancement of ATPase activity of ∼8 μm for Mg2+-GG-actin. A duplicate experiment with a second actin preparation yielded an apparent critical characterization of 7 μm (data not shown). Both determinations using Ca2+-actin yielded a critical concentration value of 11 μm. This distinction in apparent critical concentration for enhancement of Pirelease is consistent with the divalent cation-dependent difference in critical concentration for polymerization determined earlier for muscle actin (13Selden L.A. Estes J.E. Gershman L.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 116: 478-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), although the difference is smaller than that reported in this previous study. Our results therefore indicate that the enhanced ATPase activity we observed for GG-actin in F buffer results not merely from conversion of a G- to an F-monomer but derives from the formation of unstable oligomers of F-actin. It has previously been shown (14Tobacman L.S. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3207-3214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that, for a polymerization process like that of actin, a plot of ln (lag phase) versus ln (actin) will produce a line with a slope equal to one-half of the number of monomers in the nucleus. Using the data in Fig. 2 for Mg2+-actin, we calculated the lag phase by determining the point at which the second linear part of the curve intersected the first section of the plot for the 10, 12, and 16 μmcurves. The plot of ln (lag phase) versus ln (actin) shown in Fig. 4 is a straight line with a slope of 2.1. This experiment was repeated with a second preparation of actin, and a slope of 1.85 was obtained (data not shown). This result, consistent with the data of Tobacman and Korn for muscle actin (14Tobacman L.S. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3207-3214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicates that the increase in ATPase activity following addition of salt depends on formation of a nucleus with three or four monomers, further demonstrating that it results from abortive F-actin formation. Our previous work demonstrated that the ability of beryllium fluoride, BeFx (5Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1237-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), tropomyosin (7Wen K.K. Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40594-40600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), or Sac6p (8Cheng D. Marner J. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35873-35880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) to rescue GG-actin polymerizability was cold-sensitive. We therefore determined whether or not the F-actin-like ATPase activity associated with GG-actin displayed a similar temperature sensitivity. Control experiments to determine the temperature sensitivity of the Enzchek assay system showed a peak activity at 20 °C, which decreased to between 85% and 90% of this activity as the temperature was decreased to 4 °C or increased to 25 °C. As an indication of ATPase activity, we assessed the release of Pi from 12 μm Mg2+-GG-actin at temperatures ranging from 15 °C to 25 °C following the addition of 2 mmMgCl2 and 50 mm KCl. Results were then adjusted to reflect the small temperature-dependent differences in the efficiency of the Enzchek system. As shown in Fig.5A, at 15 °C, minimal Pi release was observed. Increasing the temperature above this point resulted in a corresponding increase in the rate of Pi release. The biphasic nature of these plots is similar to what is observed when one studies the polymerization of actin at different temperatures and suggests that the lag phase is due to nucleation whereas the faster second phase is associated with the unstable addition of monomers to the nuclei. To further analyze the dependence of Pi release on temperature, we plotted the slopes of both the first and second phases of the plots shownversus temperature in Fig. 5, B and C. Fig. 5D shows that both sets of data points produce the same line when the points in each curve are normalized to the slope at 25 °C for each curve. In each case, the intercept on the temperature axis is about 15 °C. When the experiment was reproduced with another preparation of actin, the onset of polymerization was 15.5 °C. Actin polymerization follows nucleation/elongation kinetics, and if nucleation is rate-limiting, the number of nuclei will dictate the rate of oligomerization. Our data therefore suggest that a threshold for nucleation for 12 μm Mg2+-GG-actin is 15 °C and that, over the temperature range tested, the increase observed in Pi release results primarily from an increase in the number of nuclei present as a function of temperature. It is possible that the temperature sensitivity of Pi release by GG-actin reflects an inherent sensitivity of the ATPase reaction per se rather than temperature-sensitive actin oligomerization. We thus assessed both the extent of polymerization and the Pi release of WT yeast actin as a function of temperature following induction of polymerization by the addition of salts. Fig. 6 shows that decreasing the temperature results in a concomitant decrease in both the rate of polymerization and Pi release. ATPase activity is present at all temperatures, and the extent of Pi release from WT actin is governed solely by the extent of actin polymerization. These results suggest that the decrease in ATPase activity observed reflects a decrease in the rate of polymerization and not an inherent temperature-sensitive decrease in the ATPase activity per se. At 15 °C, where Pi release from GG-actin had disappeared, WT actin exhibited significant Pi release with its rate dependent solely on the rate of polymerization of the actin. Therefore, the lack of Pi release, and thus ATPase activity, seen with GG-actin at 15 °C most likely results from the inability of this actin to nucleate and form transient F-actin oligomers. Although it has been demonstrated that muscle actin slowly releases its bound Pi after ATP hydrolysis (15Melki R. Fievez S. Carlier M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12038-12045Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), it is not known whether or not yeast actin has the same behavior. To address this question, we normalized the data from light scattering and Pi release at 25 °C and plotted them together (Fig. 6C). The concentration of yeast actin we used, 4.5 μm, polymerized as rapidly as 10 μm muscle actin (data not shown) under the same conditions, in agreement with the results of Buzan and Frieden (16Buzan J.M. Frieden C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) that yeast actin polymerizes substantially faster than muscle actin. Although we observed a significant lag phase in the rate of Pi release following polymerization for muscle actin, no apparent lag phase was seen in the case of the yeast actin. We have previously shown that tropomyosin (7Wen K.K. Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40594-40600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) restores the polymerizability of GG-actin. If the continuous ATPase activity observed with GG-actin alone in F salts is due to the continuous turnover of oligomers, this activity should be greatly curtailed in the presence of tropomyosin after polymerization reaches a steady state. We therefore determined the rate of Pirelease when polymerization-inducing salts were added to mixtures of actin in the presence of tropomyosin. Fig.7 demonstrates that, as predicted, the linear increase in Pi is greatly inhibited when polymerization approaches the steady state. Although Shu et al. (3Shu W.P. Wang D. Stracher A. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) reported that the F-monomer did not exhibit enhanced ATPase activity over the G-monomer, their study was performed for very short times following addition of salt to actin solutions above the critical concentration, which might have led to inaccuracies in their measurements. Second, in a number of instances dealing with polymerization rates and nucleotide exchange, yeast and muscle actins have been shown to behave quantitatively quite differently (4Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4412-4418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 16Buzan J.M. Frieden C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that oligomerization of GG-actin only occurs when its concentration is above the critical concentration. This suggests that we could possibly gain a population representing F-monomeric actin when we induce the conformational switch by F salts with GG-actin at concentrations below the critical concentration. Thus, we determined whether, below the critical concentration, GG-actin in F buffer would display an enhanced ATPase activity over that seen in G buffer. We incubated 5 μm Mg2+-GG-actin at 25 °C with or without the addition of salts and determined the rate of Pi release by the Enzchek phosphate assay. No difference could be seen between these two salt conditions in agreement with the results of Shu et al. N,N′-1,4-Phenylenedimaleimide (PDM) has been used to probe the oligomeric state of actin polymerization. Millonig and Aebi (17Millonig R. Salvo H. Aebi U. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) have demonstrated the time-dependent appearance of two cross-linked species during polymerization, a lower dimer (LD) with an apparent molecular mass of 86 kDa and an upper dimer (UD) with an apparent molecular mass of 115 kDa by SDS-PAGE. The LD, a Cys374-Cys374 cross-linked species (18Hesterkamp T. Weeds A.G. Mannherz H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), appears immediately after salt induction and is not compatible with the structure of the actin filament. The UD forms between Lys191 on one subunit and Cys374 on another subunit along the helical filament and reflects the structure of a dimer in the actin filament. The LD is consumed during polymerization probably via two pathways (19Steinmetz M.O. Goldie K.N. Aebi U. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 559-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In one path, the LD is in equilibrium with a G-actin pool and indirectly involved in polymerization. In a second pathway, during polymerization LD directly incorporates into actin filaments to form LD-decorated F-actin. The unincorporated actin subunits are then released during filament maturation probably due to an F-conformational change resulting in smooth-looking filaments. We monitored GG-actin oligomerization by PDM cross-linking. 20 μm Ca2+-GG-actin in G or F buffer was incubated at 25 °C for 10 min during which phosphate release is linear, and cross-linking by PDM was initiated as described under “Materials and Methods.” WT actin from rabbit skeletal muscle was treated in the same way as a control. Fig.8 shows that muscle actin yielded all upper dimer, consistent with what was previously reported and what we observed with yeast WT actin (20Wen K.K. Giardina P.C. Blake M.S. Edwards J. Apicella M.A. Rubenstein P.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8638-8647Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In contrast, a significant amount of LD was observed with GG-actin along with a fainter UD band demonstrating that GG-actin could form F-actin like assemblies. The Mg2+ form of GG-actin gave essentially the same result (data not shown). We previously demonstrated that, in agreement with Holmes' model of the actin filament, eliminating hydrophobicity in a subdomain 3/4 loop in yeast actin (GG) resulted in a nonpolymerizing protein (5Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1237-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, we showed that polymerizability could be restored by incubation with phalloidin (5Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1237-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), Sac6p (8Cheng D. Marner J. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35873-35880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), or tropomyosin (7Wen K.K. Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40594-40600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Whether the polymerization defect lay in the nucleation or elongation phase could not be determined. The demonstration that BeFx, a phosphate analogue, also restored polymerization (5Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1237-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) suggested that the protein could still hydrolyze ATP. However, BeFx-dependent rescue of polymerization could have resulted from stabilization of labile oligomers following nucleation or by generation of ADP-BeFx actin, which then polymerized due to an altered conformation. We have addressed these questions by employing a continuous phosphate release assay to assess nucleotide hydrolysis by GG-actin. This assay provides a combined estimate of the hydrolysis of ATP and the subsequent release of the Pi from the actin, although it does not allow us to examine the ATP hydrolysis step per se. However, the virtual coincidence of the polymerization and Pi-release curves for yeast actin makes it very unlikely that Pi release is rate-limiting in comparison to ATP hydrolysis, thereby validating this approach. Although GG-actin will not form stable filaments, our results demonstrate a substantial F buffer-dependent increase in GG-actin ATPase activity for both the Ca2+ and Mg2+ forms of the actin. In contrast with the case of WT actin, however, the ATPase activity of GG-actin is continuous. Theoretically, the continuous nature of this activity could result from an F-monomer ATPase, because previous work had presented evidence for the generation of such a species in solution (2Rich S.A. Estes J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 777-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Alternatively, continuous activity could result from the formation and cycling of small oligomers, undetectable by light scattering. Our results demonstrate that the second alternative is the correct one. In the case of WT actin polymerization, continuous low level linear ATPase activity due to treadmilling occurs at the steady state. In response to the introduction of F salts into solution, GG-actin exhibits a biphasic ATPase activity, an initial low linear ATPase activity followed by a faster but still linear phase. The low ATPase activity is very likely due to a process involving nucleation. The second faster phase could not result from a typical net elongation phenomenon, because this would require the attainment of a steady-state level of filament formation that does not occur. Instead, the continuous activity probably reflects a steady state of exchange of monomers from unstable oligomers driven by the hydrolysis of ATP. In essence, the system is one in which, once an apparent critical concentration for GG-actin is reached, nuclei or short oligomers provide a surface catalyst for the hydrolysis of ATP by cycling monomers. Because this is a steady-state situation governed by the critical concentration of the system, as the actin concentration increases, the filament ends, but not the free monomers, increase concomitantly leading to the actin-dependent linear increase in ATPase activity we observe. The apparent critical concentration of GG-actin, about 11 μm for Ca2+ actin and 7 or 8 μmfor Mg2+ actin is ∼50–60 times higher than it is for WT actin. Wen (7Wen K.K. Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40594-40600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) had previously determined a critical concentration of 5.5 μm for the tropomyosin-dependent rescue of Mg2+-GG-actin polymerization by light scattering. The small difference (0.086 mg/ml) between the critical concentration of intrinsic oligomerization and tropomyosin-dependent polymerization may be due to different preparations of actin or small variations in carrying out the experiments. It is also possible that tropomyosin slightly decreases the critical concentration of GG-actin polymerization. However, the measurement of an intrinsic critical concentration for GG-actin oligomerization allows for the first time an estimate of the importance for filament stabilization of the hydrophobicity normally associated with Val266 and Leu267, which was eliminated in this mutant. Furthermore, this system provides us with a way of actually assessing nucleation and oligomerization of actin under conditions that do not permit formation of stable filaments. Demonstration of an oligomerization-dependent ATPase coupled with our previous finding that BeFx allows formation of stable GG-actin filaments allows one to understand the underlying basis for the inability of GG-actin to form stable filaments alone. There is clearly an effect on the critical concentration of the ATP-actin. In other words, in terms of the Holmes model, in the ATP monomer, the residual hydrophobicity of the plug is oriented correctly enough to provide sufficient cross-strand stabilization for initiation of actin filament formation. However, ATP hydrolysis and subsequent release of the phosphate alters the conformation of either the plug or other monomer contacts enough so that this residual plug hydrophobicity is no longer sufficient for maintenance of the filament structure. In other words, the critical concentration of the ADP-actin monomer is so high that, under the conditions of the experiment, filaments cannot form. Oligomerization of GG-actin was directly demonstrated by PDM cross-linking. Under conditions where steady ATPase activity is observed, GG-actin forms a significant amount of LD along with much less UD. Because the UD is the precursor for nucleus and filament formation, presumably it is the conformation responsible for the F-like ATPase activity. Taking into account the differences between the critical concentrations of WT- and GG-actin, there can be no more than half as much GG F-actin species as WT species at any point. The fact that the ratio for UD between these two actins is much greater than 2:1 can be attributed to the continuous cycling of the GG F species and a resulting reduction in the frequency with which they can react with the cross-linker and perhaps to an inherently less reactive conformation assumed by the GG-actin per se. This result substantiates our previous hypothesis that tropomyosin-dependent rescue of GG-actin polymerization depends initially on the capture of pre-formed actin oligomers and not on tropomyosin-dependent nucleation of filament formation. Our temperature studies not only provide additional information concerning the effect of the GG mutation on actin function, but they also provide new insight into the ATPase of WT actin as well. The extent of polymerization of WT actin is minimally affected by cold temperatures, although, as the temperature drops, the rate of filament formation slows. Our demonstration that the rate and extent of Pi release during this process closely parallels the rate of formation of F-actin indicates, for the first time, that the F-actin ATPase activity per se is not cold-sensitive. This situation is contrary to what is found with many enzyme-substrate systems in which cold temperatures do not inhibit substrate binding but do inhibit catalysis. With 12 μm Mg2+-GG-actin, F-actin-dependent ATPase activity was not observed unless the temperature was >15 °C. This cold-sensitive behavior of GG-actin alone allows us for the first time to compare the effects of this double mutation quantitatively with the less severe polymerization defects observed with other alterations in the hydrophobic plug. The L267D mutant, in which a negative charge was placed between the two remaining hydrophobic groups required >6 °C for polymerization, whereas little if any effect was observed when either Val266 or Leu267 was altered singly to G or when Val266 was substituted with D (21Chen X. Cook R.K. Rubenstein P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1185-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Pi release is the slow step in the nucleotide cycle that occurs during the polymerization of muscle actin (1Carlier M.F. Adv. Biophys. 1990; 26: 51-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and the lag between ATP hydrolysis and Pi release has been proposed to be an important factor in the rate of actin filament turnover (22Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3-4PubMed Google Scholar). In this light, our observation that such a lag did not exist with yeast actin was very surprising and suggests the possibility of a comparatively greater degree of instability of yeast actin filaments compared with those of higher eukaryotic actins. We previously observed that nucleotide exchange in yeast actin is faster than in higher eukaryotic actins (4Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4412-4418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 23Yao X. Grade S. Wriggers W. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37443-37449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when we compared the rate of release of Pi by monomeric yeast and muscle actins (data not shown), the rate constant for the reaction in yeast G-actin (2.8 × 10−4 s−1) is faster than that exhibited by muscle actin (9 × 10−5s−1). These findings reinforce the suggestion of an inherently less stable yeast actin filament in comparison with that of higher eukaryotic actins. Systematically studying the ATPase activity that accompanies actin polymerization is inherently difficult because of the self-limiting nature of the reaction. Its rate slows drastically as polymerization reaches the steady state requiring that large amounts of actin be employed if reasonable signals are to be obtained. This problem can be circumvented somewhat by employing continuous sonication to make the ATPase reaction continuous. However, the awkwardness of this approach coupled with artifacts arising from the heat generated by the sonic probe makes this approach less than desirable. The continuous ATPase activity exhibited by GG-actin in F buffer potentially provides us with a means for experimentally addressing the mechanism of the actin-dependent hydrolysis of ATP under polymerizing conditions. We are grateful to Dr. Larry Tobacman for the muscle actin and his suggestions concerning the analysis of the data and the writing of the manuscript and to Kuo-Kuang Wen for preparing the tropomyosin used in this work."

The ""OPV/AIDS hypothesis"" suggests that the OPV used in this campaign was produced in chimpanzee kidney epithelial cell cultures rather than in monkey kidney cell cultures, as stated by H. Koprowski and co-workers, who produced the OPV. If chimpanzee cells were indeed used, this would lend support to the OPV/AIDS hypothesis, since chimpanzees harbor a simian immunodeficiency virus, widely accepted to be the origin of HIV-1. We analyzed several early OPV pools and found no evidence for the presence of chimpanzee DNA; by contrast, monkey DNA is present."

Because deoxyribonucleotides are building blocks of DNA, RNR is essential for DNA synthesis in living cells. A number of enzymes from different species has been described and classified into three major classes (1Reichard P. Science. 1993; 260: 1773-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Common for the RNRs known so far is that they all make use of a free radical mechanism to reduce ribonucleotides. RNR of class Ia, found in mammals, plants, DNA viruses, and some procaryotes like Escherichia coli, consists of two non-identical homodimeric components, proteins R1 and R2 (2Sjöberg B.-M. Struct.

The crystal structures of both components of E. coli RNR have been solved separately (4Nordlund P. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H.

The specific substrate reaction takes place in the larger R1 component, whereas the free radical on a tyrosyl side chain required for enzyme activity is generated in the smaller R2 component on Tyr-122 (1Reichard P.

The tyrosyl radical is formed together with a µ-oxo-bridged diferric center in a reconstitution reaction involving ferrous iron and molecular oxygen. The present study concerns the role in the radical generation reaction of one of the iron ligands, Glu-238, a conserved residue in protein R2. The E238A mutant R2 protein lacks a stable tyrosyl radical and enzymatic activity (11Persson B.O. Karlsson M. Climent I. Ling J. Sanders Loehr J. Sahlin M. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 247-256Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Despite many studies of the iron reconstitution reaction, a conclusive mechanism for the oxygen activation and radical formation is still missing. In the reduced protein, the iron ions are bridged by the carboxylate ligands Glu-115 and Glu-238 (for numbering of residues, see Scheme 1a). Fe1 has the monodentate ligands Asp-84 and His-118 and Fe2 has the monodentate ligands Glu-204 and His-241. At this point both Fe1 and Fe2 are 4-coordinate (12Logan D.T. Su X.D. Åberg A. Regnström K. Hajdu J. Eklund H. Nordlund P. Structure. 1996; 4: 1053-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). According to one of the latest mechanistic proposals oxygen binds to Fe2 and a conformational change of Glu-238 is induced, rendering Fe2 6-coordinate (Scheme FS1 a) (13Andersson M.E. Högbom M.

Reduction of oxygen is proposed to result in a peroxide complex, and the ferrous ions are oxidized to ferric. The next step is proposed to be heterolytic cleavage of the peroxide complex, resulting in a high valent iron-oxo species. By proton/electron transfer from an external source via the radical transfer pathway, the so-called intermediate X is formed. This is the only relatively well characterized paramagnetic intermediate in the R2 wild-type system. It is considered to be the precursor to the tyrosyl radical on Tyr-122. Formally it is considered to be a FeIII-FeIV center with an iron-iron distance of about 2.5 Å (14Bollinger J.M. Edmondson D.E. Huynh B.H. Filley J. Norton J.R. Stubbe J.

Finally Tyr-122 oxidation to the radical state, which involves abstraction of a H⋅, and equilibration with solvent, result in the active radical-containing R2 protein with Glu-238 as a monodentate ligand and an additional H2O ligand to Fe2. In the active form of the enzyme the ferric irons are both 6-coordinate, antiferromagnetically coupled, and bridged by a µ-oxo bridge, also originating from the molecular oxygen (17Ling J.S.

In this last step both Asp-84 and Glu-238 undergo carboxylate shifts, leaving Glu-238 a monodentate ligand to Fe2 and Asp-84 a bidentate ligand to Fe1. The iron ligand Glu-238 has been shown to be able to adopt several different conformations depending on oxidation state and ligand binding mode of the metal site (4Nordlund P. Sjöberg B.-M.

This suggests that it is a key residue for controlling the oxygen activation, as was also indicated in structural studies of the azide complex of the reduced R2 F208A/Y122F mutant (13Andersson M.E.

In the present work the iron-oxygen reconstitution reaction in theE. coli R2 mutant E238A was studied by 9.6 GHz and 285 GHz EPR spectroscopy. The reconstitution reaction was investigated in the presence of a number of potential small molecule iron ligands. The objective was to determine whether the small molecule ligand could assume the role of Glu-238 and keep the iron center in a structure that would allow it to react properly with oxygen and give rise to a tyrosyl radical. This was observed for an azide complex. A crystal structure of the diferrous mutant R2 protein E238A/Y122F complexed with azide was obtained. Based on the combined EPR and structure data a plausible scheme for radical regeneration in the E238A mutant is proposed (SchemeFS1 b), in analogy with the proposed reconstitution reaction in wild-type protein R2 (13Andersson M.E.

R2-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated to ∼2 mm by ultradialysis against a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, and 10% glycerol, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The R2 proteins were in the apo form (metal-free) after purification (21Sjöberg B-M. Hahne S. Karlsson M. Jörnvall H. Göransson M. Uhlin B.E. J. Biol.

The protein R2 concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm minus the absorbance at 310 nm (E 280–310= 120 mm−1 cm−1) using a Varian Cary-4 spectrophotometer. Buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5 was thoroughly degassed in a septum-sealed bulb for several hours by repeatedly flushing with oxygen-free argon and evacuation. A second bulb containing Mohr's salt crystals (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 was sealed with a septum and degassed according to the same procedure. The bulbs were then left under a slight excess pressure of argon. A plastic syringe was made anaerobic by washing several times with oxygen-free argon gas. Then the appropriate volume of anaerobic buffer to prepare the desired iron concentration was transferred into the bulb containing Mohr's salt. Reconstitution of the iron site in the R2 proteins were carried out by mixing equal volumes of apoprotein in oxygen-saturated 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, with anaerobic Fe2+ solution. Where indicated 0.1 m acetate, azide, or formate was added to the oxygen-saturated Tris buffer. Rapid freeze quenching (RFQ) was performed with a System 1000 apparatus from Update Instruments to obtain reaction times from 8 ms to 1 s. The reaction times were varied by changing the length of the reaction tube between mixer and spray nozzle. An EPR tube connected with a funnel fixed in a home-built holder was immersed completely into an isopentane bath of −110 °C to −120 °C. Aerobic apoprotein and anaerobic Fe2+ solution were rapidly mixed and then quenched by spraying them into the EPR tube in the isopentane bath. The crystals were tightly packed into the EPR tube using a packing rod made from Teflon. The isopentane in the EPR tube was removed and then the EPR tubes were kept for at least 20 min under high vacuum to get rid of isopentane trapped between the crystals. During this time the tubes were stored in a separate n-pentane bath of −120 °C. For reaction times longer than 2 s, slow freeze quench (SFQ) samples were obtained by hand-mixing. EPR tubes with the aerobic protein solution and a septum sealed bulb with the anaerobic Fe2+ solution were thermostated at the reaction temperature in a water bath. A gas-tight Hamilton syringe, equipped with a long needle, was washed several times with the anaerobic Fe2+solution to remove oxygen. Then the anaerobic ferrous solution was mixed with the apoprotein, and the reaction was stopped by immersing the EPR tube into cold n-pentane (−120 °C). 9.6 GHz EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Elexsys E500 system using a rectangular dual mode Bruker EPR cavity (ER 4116DM). For measurements below 77 K, the spectrometer was equipped with an Oxford helium flow cryostat. Spin quantitation was performed using a Cu2+/EDTA (1 mm/10 mm) primary standard or by a sample of E. coliwild-type R2 with a known tyrosyl radical content by comparing the double integrals under non-microwave saturating conditions. Spectra were evaluated using Xepr 2.0 software from Bruker. 285 GHz EPR spectra were recorded at 5 K in the Grenoble High Magnetic Field Laboratory (CNRS-MPI, Grenoble, France) as previously described (23Barra A.L. Brunel L.C. Robert J.B. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1990; 165: 107-109Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The frequency source used to generate a 285 GHz excitation is a Gunn-diode delivering a 95 GHz basic frequency, which is then tripled to obtain 285 GHz (system supplied by Radiometer Physics GmbH). The basic frequency can be changed ± 50 MHz. The exact frequency used was recorded automatically by the system. The E238A/Y122F mutant protein was crystallized using the hanging drop vapor-diffusion method as previously described for the wild-type R2 protein (24Nordlund P. Uhlin U. Westergren C. Joelsen T. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. FEBS Lett. 1989; 258: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The crystals attained a size of about 0.5 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm and belonged to spacegroup P212121. The E238A/Y122F mutant protein crystals were first soaked in mother liquor containing 80 mm FeCl2 and 0.5% sodium dithionite for 90 min to reconstitute the reduced diiron site. The crystals were then moved to mother liquor containing 0.5% sodium dithionite and 500 mm sodium azide for 30 min. The crystals were subsequently transferred to mother liquor with 20% glycerol as cryoprotectant, 0.5% dithionite, and 500 mm sodium azide, for about a minute before being flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at the Swiss-Norwegian beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France. The data were collected at a wavelength of 1.00 Å using a Mar Research imaging plate. The crystal was kept at 100 K using a cryosystem (Oxford cryosystems). The data were processed and scaled using the Denzo and Scalepack programs (25Otwinowski Z. Data Collection and Processing. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend. Warrington, UK1993Google Scholar). The structure was solved using molecular replacement with the refined structure of reduced wild-type R2 including water molecules (12Logan D.T. Su X.D. Åberg A. Regnström K. Hajdu J. Eklund H. Nordlund P. Structure. 1996; 4: 1053-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) as the starting model. During the initial rounds of refinement the starting model was used as a rigid body. The resolution limits were gradually increased to their final values during the refinement. Rigid body and positional refinement was performed using the TNT refinement package (26Tronrud D.E. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 306-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Electron density maps were calculated using TNT and programs from the CCP4 (27Collaborative Computational Project No. 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. C. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19769) Google Scholar) suite. Interpretation of maps and model building was done using QUANTA (Molecular Simulations). After several cycles of refinement water molecules with B values exceeding 70 Å2were removed, new waters were added at peaks higher than 4ς in difference maps. The free R-factor (28Brünger A. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3864) Google Scholar) was calculated using 5% of the data and monitored throughout the refinement. Once the refinement had converged, a final round of refinement was performed with all the data included. Mutant apo-protein R2 E238A was reconstituted with Fe2+ (4 Fe2+/R2) and molecular oxygen, either in the presence of acetate, azide, or formate, or without small potential iron ligand present. By combining RFQ and SFQ methods the reaction was followed from 8 ms to 10 min. EPR spectroscopy was used to detect any paramagnetic intermediates appearing in the reaction. When the reconstitution reaction was performed in the absence of any exogenous ligand, no significant production of EPR visible species in the g = 2.00 region was observed. Increasing the iron concentration to 6 Fe2+/R2 did not change this result (data not shown). Similarly, when the reconstitution (4 Fe2+/R2) was performed in the presence of formate or acetate, no significant EPR visible species could be observed, as summarized in TableI. In contrast, when azide was present in the reaction mixture, the reconstitution reaction gave rise to EPR observable species.Table IReconstitution of iron/radical site in the R2 mutant E238A from E. coliSmall ligandConcentrationTime range studiedEPR observable species1-aAll experiments were done in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5 with a ratio of ferrous iron to protein R2 dimer of 4, and a reaction temperature of 5 °C (SFQ) or 22 °C (RFQ).None—3 s –5 minNoneFormat0.1 m8 ms –25 sNoneAcetate0.1 m3 s –25 sNoneAzide0.1 m8 ms –10 minIntermediate (XA)1-bCorresponding to intermediate X observed in the reactions of wild-type and Y122F proteins, as described in the text.Tyrosyl radical1-a All experiments were done in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5 with a ratio of ferrous iron to protein R2 dimer of 4, and a reaction temperature of 5 °C (SFQ) or 22 °C (RFQ).1-b Corresponding to intermediate X observed in the reactions of wild-type and Y122F proteins, as described in the text. Open table in a new tab Fig. 1 shows a series of EPR spectra obtained after reaction times at 5 °C spanning between 80 ms and 10 min in the presence of azide. The EPR signals can be explained as superposition of two components with different weights. After long reaction times the doublet signal is close, but not quite identical, to that of a wild-type Tyr-122 tyrosyl radical (Fig.2). The composite spectra were quantitatively evaluated by subtracting a suitable amount of the spectra obtained after 90 s reaction (Fig. 1 f), so that the corresponding resulting traces are EPR singlets with line widths (peak to through) of 2.3 mT after all reaction times (data not shown). When the reconstitution reaction was performed in the presence of15N-labeled azide (14N-15N-14N from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) the EPR spectra were unchanged (data not shown). As will be shown later in the section on high-field EPR, the singlet spectrum dominating at early times in azide is virtually identical to that of intermediate X as it is observed in wild-type and Y122F protein R2 (14Bollinger J.M.

The high-field studies also confirm the assignment of the EPR doublet spectrum to a tyrosyl radical. The total amounts of unpaired spins per R2 as well as the relative contributions of the two components are summarized in Table II. The kinetic data were approximately evaluated and correspond to a rate of formation of XA > 30 s−1 (assuming > 90% formation at the earliest time point of 80 ms), and rate of disappearance of XA of 0.04 s−1. The rate of formation includes the iron binding step. These rates should be compared with those of intermediate X in wild-type R2, with a rate of formation of 8 s−1 (including iron binding) and disappearance of 1 s−1 (14Bollinger J.M. Edmondson D.E. Huynh B.H. Filley J. Norton J.R. Stubbe J. Science. 1991; 253: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), as illustrated in Scheme FS1. The rate of formation of the doublet spectrum of the tyrosyl radical in R2 E238A is compatible with XA being its precursor.Figure 2EPR spectra of the tyrosyl radical from the protein R2 E238A azide complex (solid line) and the tyrosyl radical from R2 wild-type E. coli RNR (broken line).

Open table in a new tab EPR at 285 GHz corresponding to a magnetic field of about 10.1 T was used to further characterize the composite EPR spectra in a sample of reconstituted R2 E238A protein quenched after a 10-s reaction time (Fig.4 a). To calibrate the field-scale we used a sample of wild-type protein R2 from E. coli, known to contain no other radical than the pure tyrosyl radical, and with known g-values (Fig. 4 b) (33Gerfen G.J. Bellew B.F. Un S. Bollinger Jr., J.M. Stubbe J. Griffin R.G. Singel D.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 6420-6421Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The spectra were recorded under identical conditions. Because the EPR signal from E238A was weak, we had to use a strong modulation amplitude, resulting in over-modulation (and loss of hyperfine resolution) of the wild-type EPR signal. The g-values were however not affected by the overmodulation. As can be seen from Fig. 4 a the signal is clearly composed of two components, in agreement with the observations by 9.6 GHz EPR (compare with Fig. 1 c). The signal can be explained as a superposition of a tyrosyl radical and intermediate XA. The three g-value components of the tyrosyl radical are well resolved and almost identical to those of the radical found in wild-type E. coli R2 recorded under identical conditions (Fig. 4 b, Table IV). Using the known g-values of the tyrosyl radical as an internal calibration standard, two of the g-value components of intermediate XAwere determined to be g2 = 1.998 and"

In this study, we examined whether the biochemical and catalytic properties of SIV DNA polymerases (reverse transcriptases; RT) can change during the course of viral infection. For this test, we analyzed RTs obtained from two SIV clones, SIVMNE CL8 and SIVMNE 170. SIVMNE 170 was isolated during the late symptomatic phase of infection with the parental strain, SIVMNE CL8. We found these two RTs have identical DNA polymerase specific activities and kinetics with three different DNA and RNA templates. In addition, the processivity of these two SIV RT proteins were also similar. However, as demonstrated by a misincorporation assay, the SIVMNE 170 RT showed much higher fidelity than SIVMNE CL8. The fidelity difference between these two SIV RTs was also confirmed by a steady state kinetic fidelity assay. These findings suggest that the fidelity of lentiviral RTs may change during the course of viral infection, possibly in response to alterations of host anti-viral immune capability.

Microorganisms that undergo escape from host selection systems are equipped with their own defense devices that can antagonize the anti-parasite mechanisms of the infected hosts. In the case of lentiviruses such as human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIV), genomic hypervariability has been considered to be an evolutionary tool that allows the viruses to escape from highly developed host anti-viral immune responses (1Coffin J.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 176: 156-158Google Scholar, 2Coffin J.M. Cell. 1986; 46: 1-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 3Coffin J.M. Science. 1995; 267: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1675) Google Scholar). Alterations in the biochemical and structural properties of virally encoded proteins have consistently been observed during the course of lentiviral infection (4Goudsmit J. Back N.K. Nara P.L. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2427-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 5Zhang L. Carruthers C.D. He T. Huang Y. Cao Y. Wang G. Hahn B. Ho D.D. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1997; 13: 1357-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Genomic hypermutation of lentiviruses underlies these molecular and functional shifts of viral gene products. For example, hypermutation at the variable (V) regions of lentiviral envelope proteins enables the virus to alter Env-related virological properties (i.e. cell tropism, infectivity, and cytopathicity) (6Kirchhoff F. Mori K. Desrosiers R.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3682-3692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Shioda T. Oka S. Ida S. Nokihara K. Toriyoshi H. Mori S. Takebe Y. Kimura S. Shimada K. Nagai Y. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7689-7696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These molecular alterations of env genes allow for adaptation and selection of the viral population, leading to viral escape from the host anti-viral immune system. However, even with constant molecular diversification of viral envelope protein, it is obvious that fundamental biological functions of the envelope protein must remain intact (8Douglas N.W. Munro G.H. Daniels R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 122-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Sequence variation has also been observed in the pol gene, which encodes the viral DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase; RT)1(9Quinones-Mateu M.E. Albright J.L. Mas A. Soriano V. Arts E.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9002-9015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is also obvious that the basic enzymatic activities of RT, such as DNA polymerase and RNase H activities, should remain active enough to support viral replication. However, it is not clear whether other biochemical properties of lentiviral RTs such as replicational fidelity remain constant in the face of sequence variations during the course of viral infection. Lentiviral RTs are the most error prone DNA polymerases known to be involved in DNA replication (10Williams K.J. Loeb L.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 176: 165-180PubMed Google Scholar, 11Preston B.D. Poiesz B.J. Loeb L.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1168-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), and RT infidelity is thought to be the major driving force behind the generation of new viral variants, which are essential for viral escape from host immune pressure (10Williams K.J. Loeb L.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 176: 165-180PubMed Google Scholar,12Preston B.D. Dougherty J.P. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 16-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In fact the level of host immune capability gradually but progressively decreases during the course of lentiviral infection, ultimately declining to a level that results in clinically apparent immune deficiency (i.e. AIDS) and in overwhelming opportunistic infections. Therefore, it is a logical assumption that the viral capability to mutate, evolve, and escape may also vary, particularly as host anti-viral selective pressure becomes diminished during the late stages of viral infection. Therefore, if RT infidelity is a source of viral hypermutagenesis, it is possible that the level of RT fidelity may change when the virus grows under conditions of reduced or no anti-viral selective pressure (i.e. the symptomatic phase of infection). Even though several RT mutants with slightly increased fidelity have been isolated following the anti-viral chemotherapy (13Rezende L.F. Curr K. Ueno T. Mitsuya H. Prasad V.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2890-2895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wainberg M.A. Drosopoulos W.C. Salomon H. Hsu M. Borkow G. Parniak M.A. Gu Z. Song Q. Manne J. Islam S. Castriota G. Prasad V.R. Science. 1996; 271: 1282-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), RT mutants with greatly enhanced fidelity have not been isolated from the natural lentiviral population. Therefore, whether RT fidelity changes during the course of viral infection remains unanswered. In this study, we examined the enzymatic properties of SIV RTs obtained from two representative viruses (SIVMNE CL8 and SIVMNE 170) that were isolated from the same animal at two different stages of infection (15Kimata J.T. Kuller L. Anderson D.B. Dailey P. Overbaugh J. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 16Kimata J.T. Gosink J.J. KewalRamani V.N. Rudensey L.M. Littman D.R.

Virology. 1995; 207: 528-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). SIVMNE 170 is a molecular clone of SIVMNE that was isolated from a pig-tailed macaque during the late symptomatic phase of infection with the parental SIVMNE CL8 virus (17Rudensey L.M. Kimata J.T. Benveniste R.E. Overbaugh J. Virology. 1995; 207: 528-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 18Kimata J.T. Overbaugh J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7629-7639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These two clones have been used as representative clones to investigate alterations in various viral phenotypes (i.e. co-receptor use, cytopathicity, and pathogenicity) during lentiviral infection (15Kimata J.T. Kuller L. Anderson D.B. Dailey P. Overbaugh J. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 16Kimata J.T. Gosink J.J. KewalRamani V.N. Rudensey L.M. Littman D.R.

Med. 1999; 5: 488-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In this report, we present evidence that SIVMNE 170 RT has much higher fidelity than the RT of initial SIVMNE CL8. This finding suggests that RT fidelity can change during the course of viral infection. Presumably, this fidelity change could be due to a viral response to alterations in host immune capability. Possible molecular and structural strategies that the virus may employ to alter its RT fidelity are also discussed. Escherichia coli NM522 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used for construction of plasmids, and BL21 (Novagen, Madison, WI) for overexpression of SIVMNE RT proteins. pBK90 and 125 are pHis/NdeI plasmids (20Kim B. Methods. 1997; 12: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) encoding full-length SIVMNE CL8 and 170 RT genes, fused at the N-terminus to six histidine residues, respectively. The RT genes were derived from pSIVMNE170 and pSIVMNECL8 (15Kimata J.T. Kuller L. Anderson D.B. Dailey P. Overbaugh J. Nat.

Virol. 1997; 71: 7629-7639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pSIVmac239–5′ was obtained from Dr. Stephen Dewhurst (University of Rochester). For the expression plasmids for SIVMNE CL8 and 170 RTs, RT genes were amplified by Pfu DNA polymerase (CLONTECH, San Francisco, CA) from pSIVMNECL8 and pSIVMNE170by using SRT SD F forward (5′-TTTTTTAAGCTTGAAGGAGATATACATATGCCCATAGCTAAGGTAGAGCC-3′;NdeI site in underline, start codon in bold) and SRT C-T R reverse primers (5′-TTTTTTGGATCCGTCGACTTAAACTTGTCTAATCCCTTG-3′;BamHI in underline, termination codon in bold). Amplified 1.6-kilobase products were cloned to the pHis/NdeI plasmid after digestion with NdeI and BamHI. Two independent clones of each SIV RT were analyzed for both sequencing and biochemical analysis. The 396-amino acid long N-T regions of both SIVMNE CL8 and 170 RT genes in two independent clones of pBK90 and pBK125 as well as in original viral plasmids, pSIVMNE170 and pSIVMNECL8 were sequenced by the ABI system (Perkin Elmer, Roche Molecular Systems, Branchburg, NJ). HSG5′ primer (5′-TATGTTGTGTGGAATTGT-3′ for pBK90 and 125) for the region of amino acids 1 to 151 of the RT gene and SIVMNE 150F, an internal sequencing primer, (5′-CGATACATTTATAAGGTTC-3′) for the region of amino acids 152–396 were used for the sequencing analysis of pBK90 and 125. For sequencing of the RT gene in the full-length viral vectors, SIV-POL3 (5′-ATTATTAGATACAGGGGCTG-3′), SIV-POL8 (5′-CTAATCTTACTTAGTGGT-3′), SIV-POL9 (5′-TGGCACCCATGCTACAT-3′), SIV-POL10 (5′-TAGTGCTGTCTGTCTTC-3′), SIV-POL20 (5′-CAGAAGTCCAATTGGGAATACCAC-3′), SIV-POL21 (5′-GAGACCTGGACAGTGAATGATATAC-3′), SIV-POL22 (5′-CCAATGGAGTTAGACTATTAGCAC-3′), and SIV-RT1 (5′-AGGCAGTGGCCATTATC-3′) primers were used. The analyzed sequence of the SIVMNE 170 RT gene was compared with that of SIVMNE CL8 RT gene. SIV RT proteins were purified using our purification protocol for HIV-1 RT as previously described (20Kim B. Methods. 1997; 12: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Expression of SIVMNE RTs was induced by addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 1000 ml of log phase E. coli BL21 with the RT expression plasmids (pBK90 and pBK125), grown in 2 × YT to anA600 of 0.5. After incubation for 2 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation and the pellets were resuspended and frozen (−70 °C) with 20 ml of 1 × binding buffer and lysozyme (200 μg/ml). All buffers and binding resin used in this work were purchased from Novagen. Frozen cells were thawed and lysed on ice for ∼2 h. The lysed cells were centrifuged (27,000 ×g) and the supernatant solution was applied to a charged 10-ml His-Bind column (1 × 10 cm). The resin was prepared by successive washes with deionized water (30 ml), 1 × charge buffer (30 ml) and 1 × binding buffer (45 ml). All chromatographic steps were carried out at 4 °C at a flow rate of 20 ml/h. Following application of the crude supernatant solution, the column was washed with 1 × binding buffer (40 ml) and mixture of 1 × binding buffer and 1 × wash buffer (7:3, 10 ml). RT proteins were eluted with 1 × elute buffer (20 ml); 90% of the recovered RT protein was released from the resin in the first 8 ml. Fractions containing purified SIVMNE RT proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Fractions containing RT were dialyzed against 1 × dialysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) for 16 h and 1 × dialysis buffer with 1 mmdithiothreitol for 6 h. In this protocol the purity of SIVMNE was typically greater than 95%, estimated by visual inspection of Coomassie Blue-stained gels. RT proteins were purified from two independent clones of pBK90 or pBK125. A p66/p66 homodimer of SIVRT proteins was used in this study. Three templates were used to measure both DNA dependent DNA polymerase and RNA dependent DNA polymerase activities of RT proteins. The heteropolymeric DNA template is a gapped salmon sperm DNA prepared as described (21Battula N. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4086-4093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The homopolymeric RNA template-primer is poly(rA) (286–428 nucleotides long, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) annealed to a 20-base pair long oligo(dT) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; T:P, 1:4). The heteropolymeric RNA template-primer is a 3,569-nucleotide long MS2 phage (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) annealed to 20-mer DNA primer (5′-CGTTAGCCACTCCGAAGTGC-3′, T:P, 1:2) annealing to the 3315 to 3334 region of the MS2 RNA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Branchburg, NJ). Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 2 nm SIVMNE RT protein, dNTPs (100 μm each), [3H]TTP (10 μm, ICN), 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and either gapped salmon sperm DNA (5 μg), poly(rA)/oligo(dT) (1 μg), or heterologous RNA annealed 17-mer DNA (100 ng). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min and terminated by addition of 400 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. The incorporation of [3H]TTP was linear up to 15 min incubation time under this condition. The protocol for this assay was previously described (22Kim B. Hathaway T.R. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4872-4878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Procedures were modified from those of Preston et al. (11Preston B.D. Poiesz B.J. Loeb L.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1168-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). The DNA template-primer was prepared by annealing a 40-mer (5′-AAGCTTGGCTGCAGAATATTGCTAGCGGGAATTCGGCGCG-3′) to a 17-mer (5′-CGCGCCGAATTCCCGCT-3′; A primer, template:primer, 2.5:1)32P-labeled at the 5′ end by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The RNA template-primer was also prepared by annealing a 40-mer (5′-AAGCUUGGCUGCAGAAUAUUGCUAGCGGGAAUUCGGCGCG-3′, Dharmacon Research, Lafayette, CO) which encodes the same sequence as the 40-mer DNA template, annealed to the 17-mer used for DNA template-primer preparation. Assay mixtures (20 μl) contained 10 nm template/primer, 10 to 40 nm SIVMNE RT proteins as specified in the figure legends, 3 or 4 dNTPs (250 μm each), 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, 2 μm unlabeled primer, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min and terminated by 4 μl of 40 mm EDTA, 99% formamide. Reaction products were immediately denatured by incubating at 95 °C for 5 min and analyzed by electrophoresis in 14% polyacrylamide-urea gels. To measure RTs capability to extend mismatched primer, we used two different mismatched primers annealed to either the RNA or DNA template used in the misincorporation assay. 16-mer G/T mismatched primer (5′-CGCGCCGAATTCCCGT-3′: mismatch with underline) or 19-mer C/A mismatched primer (5′-CGCGCCGAATTCCCGCTAA-3′) was annealed to the 40-mer RNA and DNA templates (see above), respectively. For control matched primer, we used the 15-mer C primer (5′-CGCGCCGAATTCCCG-3′). Reaction conditions for these mismatched primers were identical to those used in the misincorporation assay described above. The same RT activities of SIVMNE RT proteins were used in this assay, as determined by the extension reaction with the matched C primer. Two RT concentrations (4× and 1×) of RT proteins and all dNTPs were used in this assay. The reactions were also analyzed by 14% denaturing gel. A modification of the steady-state kinetic assay of Boosalis et al. (23Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14689-14696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used to determine misinsertion frequencies. Reaction conditions were the same as those described in the misincorporation assay except for the primers, the concentrations of dNTPs. For RNA template reaction (1st DNA strand synthesis), 32P-labeled C primer (5′-CGCGCCGAATTCCCG-3′) annealed to 40-mer RNA template (see above) was extended by the two SIVMNE RTs with increasing concentrations of correct (dCTP) or incorrect (TTP) nucleotide at 37°C (Fig. 3). The amounts of RTs and incubation time were adjusted to yield extension of 30–50% of the total labeled primer at the highest dNTP concentrations. Products were resolved in 14% polyacrylamide-urea gel and quantitated by phosphor-imaging analysis (Cyclone, Packard, Meriden, CT). For the DNA template reaction (2nd DNA strand synthesis), G primer (5′-CGCGCCGAATTCCC-3′) annealed to 40-mer DNA template (see above) was extended with correct (dGTP) or incorrect (dATP). Thekcat and Km values were determined from Hanes-Woolf plots (24Kamath-Loeb A.S. Hizi A. Kasai H. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5892-5898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The misinsertion fidelity,fins((kcat/Km for incorrect dNTP)/(kcat/Km for correct dNTP)) was calculated from the kcat andKm values. M184V mutants of SIVMNE CL8 and 170 RTs were constructed by polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis. For N-T RT polymerase chain reaction, two different mutagenesis reverse primers (5′-TTTTTTTTTGCTAGCTACTAAGATGTCATCTAC- (for M184V; AAT for M184I) -ATACTGGACTAAGGTCAC-3′) encoding (−)-strand sequences of the YMDD region of SIVMNE RT. These primers contained mutations at the positions encoding Met-184 mutations (bold) and SacI site at position 190 (underlined). These two mutagenesis primers and SRT SD F forward primer (see above) were used for amplification of the N-T 191 amino acid region of RTs from pBK90 (SIVMNE CL8 RT) or pBK125 (SIVMNE 170 RT) by Pfu DNA polymerase. A C-terminal 243-amino acid long fragment (residue 190–433) of SIV RTs were amplified with two primers, SacI SIV RT primer (5′-TTTTTTTTTGCTAGCGACAGGACAGACCTGGAAC-3′) encoding (+)-strand sequences of the YMDD region and SacI (underlined), and SpeI SIV RT primer (5′- CTTACTAGTGGTGGTGTTG-3′) encoding (−)-strand sequence ofSpeI region (RT amino acids 426–433). These two amplified N-T and C-T fragments were double-digested byNdeI/SacI and SacI/SpeI, respectively. These two digested fragments of SIVMNE CL8 and 170 RTs were then inserted into 3.5-kilobase backbone DNAs of pBK90 and pBK125 digested with NdeI and SpeI, respectively. Met-184 mutations created in pBK90 and pBK125 were identified by ABI sequencing system (see above). A plasmid expressing SIVmac239 RT was constructed using SIVmac239 RT genes amplified from pSIVmac239–5′ using the SRT SD F and SRT C-T R primers that were used for construction of pBK90 and pBK125 (see above). SIVmac239 RT protein was purified by using the same protocol as one used for SIVMNE RT proteins (see above). Reaction condition for measuring processivity requires a single round of primer extension (25Kim B. Ayran J.C. Sagar S.G. Adman E.T. Fuller S.M. Tran N.H. Horrigan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26673-27666Google Scholar, 26Weiss K.K. Isaacs S.J. Tran N.H. Adman E.T. Kim B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10684-10694Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). RT proteins were preincubated with 20 nm poly(rA) (average size = 260 nucleotides, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) annealed to the 32P-labeled 20-mer oligo(dT) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) for 3 min at 20 °C. The concentrations of wild type RTs and M184I RTs of SIVMNE CL8 and 170 were 10 and 25 nm, respectively. The extension reactions were initiated by adding the trap mixture containing dNTPs (0.5 mm with final concentration 5 mmMgCl2), molar excess of cold poly(rA)/oligo(dT) (20 μm) and heparin (10 μg/20 μl). The extension reactions were terminated with 4 μl of stop solution after 3 min incubation at 37 °C. Two control reactions were performed as described (25Kim B. Ayran J.C. Sagar S.G. Adman E.T. Fuller S.M. Tran N.H. Horrigan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26673-27666Google Scholar, 26Weiss K.K. Isaacs S.J. Tran N.H. Adman E.T. Kim B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10684-10694Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), confirming the single round of primer extension under this reaction condition. In the +Trap control reaction, the trap mixture was added during preincubation of RT and T/P, which prevents RT from extending the primer. In the −Trap reaction, the T/P preincubated with RT was extended by only dNTP in the absence of the trap molecules, which allows multiple round of primer extension. The terminated processivity reaction and control reactions were analyzed by 8% polyacrylamide-urea gel after 3 min heat inactivation. To test whether the DNA polymerase activity of lentiviral RT can change during the course of viral infection, we purified RT proteins from two SIV representative clones, SIVMNE CL8 (early asymptomatic phase) and SIVMNE 170 (late symptomatic phase) using a bacterial overexpression system. We determined the DNA polymerase specific activities of these two purified SIVMNE RT proteins with a heteropolymeric DNA template and two homo- and heteropolymeric RNA templates. As seen in TableI, these two SIV RT proteins showed very similar levels of DNA- and RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities with both heterogeneous and homogeneous DNA and RNA templates. The similarity of DNA polymerase activity between these two SIV RT proteins was also confirmed by the RT assay, with a gel-based primer extension reaction (see below and Fig.1, lanes containing all dNTPs), and steady state kinetic measurement (Km andkcat for correct dNTPs, dCTP, and dGTP; Fig. 3and Table II). We purified RTs from two independent clones of each SIVMNE strain. Purified RT proteins from two independent clones of each SIVMNE also showed similar specific activities with both DNA and RNA templates. This result shows that the DNA polymerase catalytic activities of these two SIVMNE RTs, isolated in different stages of viral infection, are largely identical.Table IDNA polymerase activities of SIVMNE CL8 and 170 RTsTemplatesSpecific activity (mol/mol s)1-aSpecific activities were determined by incorporation of [3H]TTP with each of three templates as described under “Experimental Procedures.”SIVMNE CL8 RTSIVMNE 170 RTHeteropolymeric DNA1-bGapped salmon sperm DNA prepared as described (20).0.670.52Homopolymeric RNA1-cPoly(rA)/oligo(dT)20.2.892.69Heteropolymeric RNA1-dMS2 phage RNA annealed to 20-mer primer.1.801.631-a Specific activities were determined by incorporation of [3H]TTP with each of three templates as described under “Experimental Procedures.”1-b Gapped salmon sperm DNA prepared as described (20Kim B.

Open table in a new tab Next, we examined the fidelity of SIVMNE CL8 and 170 RT proteins using the misincorporation assay. This is a primer extension assay that monitors both misinsertion and mismatch extension of a 17-mer primer annealed to a 40-mer DNA or RNA template with biased dNTP pools containing only three kinds of dNTPs. In this assay with only three kinds of dNTPs, the primer extension stops at one base before the template nucleotide for which the complementary dNTP was deleted (stop sites; see the sites with “*” in Fig. 1). Therefore, the higher efficiency of primer extension beyond the stop sites will reflect higher utilization of incorrect dNTPs and the lower fidelity of the RT protein assayed. We used concentrations of SIVMNE CL8 and 170 RTs that showed identical levels of primer extension with all dNTPs present. As shown in Fig. 1,A (RNA template) and B (DNA template), in reactions containing all 4 dNTPs, equivalent concentrations of SIVMNE CL8 and 170 RT proteins catalyzed approximately the same amounts of DNA synthesis and fully extended primers (50% in RNA template; 80% in DNA template). However, when incubated with mixtures of only 3 dNTPs (Fig.1, A, −dATP and −TTP; B,−dGTP and –TTP), SIVMNE CL8 RT catalyzed substantial extension past the stop sites (*), indicating low fidelity (11Preston B.D. Poiesz B.J. Loeb L.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1168-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 25Kim B. Ayran J.C. Sagar S.G. Adman E.T. Fuller S.M. Tran N.H. Horrigan J. J. Biol.

On the other hand, the SIVMNE 170 RT protein catalyzed much less synthesis and shorter extension beyond the stop sites than SIVMNE CL8 RT protein in reactions with 3 dNTPs, indicative of higher replicational fidelity on both RNA and DNA templates. Creation of one mutation during DNA synthesis consists of two sequential steps, 1) incorporation of the incorrect dNTP (misinsertion) and 2) extension of the mismatched primer generated by the misinsertion. In the misincorporation assay shown in Fig. 1, extension of primer beyond the stop sites measured the capability of the RT proteins to misinsert and then to extend the mismatched primer. Next, we examined the capability of SIVMNE 170 and CL8 RT proteins only to extend the mismatched primer (2ndstep of mutation synthesis). In this study, we used two different mismatched primers (MP) annealed to either RNA or DNA template. One T/P contains a G/T mismatch at the 3′ end of the primer annealed to the RNA template. The other T/P contains a C/A mismatch at the 3′ end of the primer annealed to the DNA template. These C/T (1st DNA strand synthesis) and"

Mutation of either Arg-279, the penultimate basic residue within the Walker A nucleotide-binding fold in the bisphosphatase domain, or Arg-359 to Ala eliminated the activation of the chicken 6PF-2K by ATP. Binding analysis by fluorescence spectroscopy using 2′(3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-ATP revealed that the kinase domains of these two mutants, unlike that of the wild type enzyme, showed no cooperativity in ATP binding and that the mutant enzymes possess only the high affinity ATP binding site, suggesting that the ATP binding site on the bisphosphatase domain represents the low affinity site. This conclusion was supported by the result that the affinity of ATP for the isolated bisphosphatase domain is similar to that for the low affinity site in the wild type enzyme. In addition, we found that the 6PF-2K of a chimeric enzyme, in which the last 25 residues of chicken enzyme were replaced with those of the rat enzyme, could not be activated by ATP, despite the fact that the ATP-binding properties of this chimeric enzyme were not different from those of the wild type chicken enzyme. These results demonstrate that activation of the chicken 6PF-2K by ATP may result from allosteric binding of ATP to the bisphosphatase domain where residues Arg-279 and Arg-359 are critically involved and require specific C-terminal sequences.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8775-8784Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It has long been recognized that both the N and C termini of the enzyme play important roles in the regulation of the 6PF-2K and the Fru-2,6-P2ase activities (11Kurland I.J. Pilkis S.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1023-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recently, Wu et al. (12Wu R.F. Uyeda K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) found that the charged residues as well as Ser20–Ser24 in the N-terminal tail might be involved in interactions with the catalytic domains. The interaction may lead to increased 6PF-2K and reduced Fru-2,6-P2ase activities, as disruption of this N-terminal interaction resulted in the reduction in both kinase and phosphatase activities. The work of Kurland et al. (13Kurland I.J. Chapman B. El-Maghrabi M.R. Biochem.

The C terminus of the bifunctional enzyme has a regulatory function on both the kinase and bisphosphatase activities, and it is generally regarded as having an inhibitory effect on the bisphosphatase activity (14Lin K.

Ling S. Yang Q.H. Li L. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 1195-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The kinase domain of the bifunctional enzyme has a Walker A motif (Gly-X-X-X-X-Gly-Lys-Thr) and B motif (Z-Z-Z-Z-Asp), which are typical of nucleotide-binding proteins (3Bazan J.F. Fletterick R.J.

Mutation of the first Gly of the A motif abolished the kinase activity of the rat liver bifunctional enzyme (20Li L. Lin K. Kurland I.J. Correia J.J. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4386-4393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Lys residue in the A motif is critical for ATP binding, and the Thr residue is necessary for catalysis (21Vertommen D. Bertrand L. Sontag B. Di Pietro A. Louckx M.P. Vidal H. Hue L. Rider M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17875-17880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10Mizuguchi H. Cook P.F. Hasemann C.A. Uyeda K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8775-8784Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The Asp residue in the B motif is also important for the binding of ATP, as it coordinates the ATP-bound Mg2+ (18Rider M.H. Crepin K.M. De Cloedt M. Bertrand L. Hue L. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a sequence characteristic of the Walker A motif was also identified in the Fru-2,6-P2ase domain (22Lee Y.H. Okar D. Lin K. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11002-11010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Early work on rat hepatic enzyme revealed that the isolated Fru-2,6-P2ase domain can be regulated by GTP, ATP, and other nucleotide triphosphates, and Arg-360 was important for the regulation of Fru-2,6-P2ase activity by nucleotide triphosphates (22Lee Y.H. Okar D. Lin K. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11002-11010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the nucleotide triphosphates might regulate the activity of Fru-2,6-P2ase by binding specifically to this domain. In addition, it has been found that 6PF-2K of chicken hepatic enzyme was activated by substrate ATP. The Hill plot of the kinase activity against the concentrations of ATP yielded a coefficient of 0.56 (23Li L. Pan L. Xu G.J. Sci. China B. 1991; 34: 916-922PubMed Google Scholar). Such a phenomenon might be either the result of negative cooperativity between the two identical ATP binding sites in the kinase domains of the homodimeric enzyme or the allosteric binding of ATP to the Fru-2,6-P2ase domain. In this work, we provide evidence to support the latter possibility by using site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical approaches. Restriction endonucleases and other DNA modifying enzymes were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. or New England Biolabs. ATP, Fru-6-P, and Fru-2,6-P2 were purchased from Sigma. N-methylisatoic anhydride was purchased from Aldrich. Point mutations were made using standard polymerase chain reaction techniques and checked by double strand DNA sequencing. The construct for chimeric enzyme, where the last 25 residues from the C terminus of CKB was replaced with that of RKB (CKB-RCT), was generated as reported elsewhere (17Zhu Z. Ling S. Yang Q.H. Li L. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 1195-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). All forms of CKB were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) using pET3a plasmid and purified to homogeneity by the same procedures for the preparation of the wild type CKB (24Li L. Yao W.Z. Lange A.J. Pilkis S.J. Dong M.Q. Yin Y. Xu G.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 25Yang Q.H. Wu C.L. Lin K. Li L. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 10: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The N-methylanthraniloyl derivative of ATP was synthesized according to Hiratsuda (26Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). After reaction, the product was purified according to Woodward et al. (27Woodward S.K.A. Eccleston J.F. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), except that a DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column was used instead of a DEAE-cellulose column. The purified Mant-ATP was verified by absorption spectra, fluorescence spectra, and thin-layer chromatography (data not shown). All far UV spectra were collected on a Jasco 720 dichrograph in a 0.01-cm cell at 25 °C. Scans were collected at 50 nm/min between 190 and 250 nm with a response of 2 s and resolution of 0.2 nm. The bandwidth was 1 nm. All data were the average of four blank corrected samples. The proteins were equilibrated with buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, and 1 mm DTT by mini-gel filtration. Samples were then centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g to remove any precipitates, and the A 280 was measured to scale the CD data to the same concentration. Different forms of CKB (final concentration, 20 μg/ml) were incubated for 20 min at 25 °C with various concentrations of GdnHCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm DTT. Protein fluorescence was measured with a Hitachi F-4010 fluorescence spectrophotometer from 300 to 400 nm with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. The emission fluorescence intensity at 335 nm and the maximum emission wavelength were recorded. The increase in the extrinsic fluorescence was employed to measure the binding of Mant-ATP to different enzyme forms at 20 °C with an Hitachi F-4010 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The spectral bandwidths were 3 and 5 nm, respectively, for excitation and emission. Mant-ATP (50 μm-5 mm) was added dropwise (1–2 μl) to 90–100 μg of enzyme diluted in 1 ml of buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm Pi, 2 mm DTT, and 5 mm MgCl2. The sample was excited at 350 nm, and the fluorescence was scanned from 400 to 500 nm. The fluorescence of free Mant-ATP in the absence of enzyme was also recorded under the same conditions. The differential spectrum resulted from subtracting the fluorescence of Mant-ATP in the absence of enzyme from that in the presence enzyme was integrated. All measurements were corrected for dilution (less than 3%) and inner filter effects. 6PF-2K activity was assayed by the formation of Fru-2,6-P2, which was quantified by the stimulation of potato tuber pyrophosphate (fructose-6-phosphate phosphotransferase) (28Van Schaftingen E. Davies D.R. Hers R.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 124: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, the reaction mixture contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mmPi, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm Fru-6-P in a final volume of 50 μl. The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C and terminated with the addition of 1.5 m NaOH. The solution was heated for 1 h at 80 °C and diluted to 1 ml with water. Suitable aliquots of the diluted solution were then assayed for Fru-2,6-P2. The activity of Fru-2,6-P2ase was assayed at pH 7.4 by following the rate of production of [32P]Pifrom [2-32P]Fru-2,6-P2 as described previously by El-Maghrabi et al. (29El-Maghrabi M.R. Correia J.J. Heil P.J. Pate T. Cobb C. Pilkis S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5005-5009Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Our early work showed that the 6PF-2K activity of the chicken liver bifunctional enzyme was stimulated by its substrate ATP, indicating an apparent negative cooperativity for the enzyme in binding of ATP (23Li L. Pan L. Xu G.J. Sci. China B. 1991; 34: 916-922PubMed Google Scholar, 24Li L. Yao W.Z. Lange A.J. Pilkis S.J. Dong M.Q. Yin Y. Xu G.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Because 6PF-2K/Fru-2,6-P2ase is a homodimer, such cooperativity might result from the interaction between the two ATP binding sites of the kinase domains of the CKB homodimer (23Li L. Pan L. Xu G.J. Sci. China B. 1991; 34: 916-922PubMed Google Scholar, 24Li L. Yao W.Z. Lange A.J. Pilkis S.J. Dong M.Q. Yin Y. Xu G.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the cooperativity may result from the interaction between the ATP binding site of the kinase domain and that of the bisphosphatase domain. To determine which mechanism underlies the ATP activation of chicken 6PF-2K, we examined whether elimination of the binding of ATP to the bisphosphatase domain affected the activation of chicken 6PF-2K. Previously, it was reported that the Fru-2,6-P2ase activities of the hepatic bifunctional enzyme was regulated by triphosphate nucleotides such as GTP or ATP (22Lee Y.H. Okar D. Lin K. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11002-11010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Van Schaftingen E. Davies D.R. Hers R.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 124: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Lee et al. (22Lee Y.H. Okar D. Lin K. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11002-11010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the activation of the Fru-2,6-P2ase by GTP or ATP involved a direct interaction of the triphosphate nucleotides with the active site of the bisphosphatase domain, and the activation is caused by the phosphate moieties of the triphosphate nucleotides competing with the 2-phospho group of Fru-2,6-P2 for the phosphoenzyme interaction, thus relieving substrate inhibition. Arg-360 of rat liver enzyme was demonstrated as a critical residue responsible for the substrate inhibition (30Li L. Lin K. Pilkis J. Correia J.J. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21588-21594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is important for the binding of GTP to the bisphosphatase domain (22Lee Y.H. Okar D. Lin K. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11002-11010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, this residue is highly conserved among various isoforms of the bifunctional enzymes; the corresponding residue of the chicken liver enzyme is Arg-359. In addition, the nucleotide-binding motif (Gly274-Leu-Ser-Ala-Arg-Gly-Lys-Gln281) found in the bisphosphatase domain of RKB (22Lee Y.H. Okar D. Lin K. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11002-11010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is also conserved in CKB (Table I). The penultimate basic residue was shown previously to be critical for nucleotide binding (31Traut T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The corresponding residue in the chicken liver enzyme is Arg-279 (Table I). To investigate whether Arg-279 and/or Arg-359 are involved in the binding of ATP to the bisphosphatase domain of CKB, two mutants, CKBR279A and CKBR359A, were produced and analyzed.Table IComparison of the Walker A motif and the sequence around Arg-359 in the bisphosphatase domain of CKB with the corresponding sequences in other isoforms of the bifunctional enzymeEnzyme speciesSequence alignmentChicken liver273GLSTRGR QYA...351RDQDKYRYRYPKRat liver274GLSARGKQYA...352RDQDKYRYRYPKRat testisGLSPRGREFS...RDQDKYRYRYPKRat skeletal muscleGLSARGKQYA...RDQDKYRYRYPKRat brainGLSLRGKQFA...RDQEKYLYRYPGHuman liverGLSVRGKQYA...RDQDKYRYRYPKBovine heartGLSVRGKQFA...RDEEKYLYRYPGThe Walker A motif in the bisphosphatase domain of CKB is underlined, and the two basic amino acid residues, Arg-279 and Arg-359, are in bold face type.

Open table in a new tab The Walker A motif in the bisphosphatase domain of CKB is underlined, and the two basic amino acid residues, Arg-279 and Arg-359, are in bold face type. The corresponding residues in RKB are Lys-280 and Arg-360, respectively. The mutant enzymes CKBR279A and CKBR359A were expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity as described previously (24Li L. Yao W.Z. Lange A.J. Pilkis S.J. Dong M.Q. Yin Y. Xu G.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 25Yang Q.H. Wu C.L. Lin K. Li L. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 10: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We first examined the Fru-2,6-P2ase activities of the two mutant enzymes. As shown in Table II, CKBR359A has a K m value for Fru-2,6-P2 that is 6.5-fold higher than the wild type CKB, and substrate inhibition of CKBR359A by Fru-2,6-P2 was also diminished (Fig.1). These results are consistent with those of the corresponding RKB mutant, RKBR360A (30Li L. Lin K. Pilkis J. Correia J.J. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21588-21594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that Arg-359, like Arg-360 in the rat enzyme, is a critical residue in the chicken Fru-2,6-P2ase domain for triphosphate nucleotide binding. On the other hand, CKBR279A showed V max andK m values for Fru-2,6-P2 similar to those of the wild type CKB and acted similarly to the wild type enzyme with regard to substrate inhibition (Fig. 1). However, the Fru-2,6-P2ase activity of CKBR279A, unlike the wild type enzyme, could not be activated by ATP (Fig.2), suggesting that Arg-279 of CKB is required for ATP binding to the Fru-2,6-P2ase domain.Table IIComparison of kinetic parameters of the wild type and mutant forms of CKB and RKBKinetic propertiesEnzyme formsCKBCKBR279ACKBR359ACKB-RCTRKB6PF-2KV max(milliunits/mg)97 ± 16197 ± 2074 ± 8130 ± 11120 ± 15203 ± 26K m ATP(mm)0.11 ± 0.030.19 ± 0.050.10 ± 0.030.17 ± 0.060.077 ± 0.0130.54 ± 0.10K m Fru-6-P (mm)−Pi0.86 ± 0.070.62 ± 0.050.72 ± 0.070.97 ± 0.110.91 ± 0.10+5 mmPi0.015 ± 0.0020.022 ± 0.0040.018 ± 0.0020.018 ± 0.0030.020 ± 0.003Fru-2,6-P2aseV max(milliunits/mg)16 ± 315 ± 318 ± 539 ± 437 ± 4K m Fru-2,6-P2(μm)0.13 ± 0.040.11 ± 0.020.85 ± 0.110.17 ± 0.080.17 ± 0.03The 6PF-2K activity was measured in buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm Pi, 1 mm DTT, and 10 mm MgCl2.K m values for ATP or Fru-6-P were determined in the presence of 2 mm Fru-6-P or 10 mm ATP, respectively.

The values represent the mean ± S.D. for three determinations. Knowing that the two Arg residues are important for the Fru-2,6-P2ase domain to bind ATP, an important question is whether the two mutations affect the activation of the 6PF-2K of CKB by ATP. The 6PF-2K of the wild type CKB exhibited substrate activation by ATP, as reported earlier when assayed in the presence of 1–2 mm of MgCl2 (23Li L. Pan L. Xu G.J. Sci. China B. 1991; 34: 916-922PubMed Google Scholar, 24Li L. Yao W.Z. Lange A.J. Pilkis S.J. Dong M.Q. Yin Y. Xu G.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Although MgCl2 at concentrations over 2 mminhibits the chicken liver 6PF-2K, it does not affect the substrate activation of 6PF-2K of wild type CKB by ATP, as the ATP activation was also observed in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2(Fig. 3). For convenience, all of the following kinetic analyses were carried out in buffers containing 10 mm MgCl2. The double reciprocal plot of 6PF-2K activity of CKB versus the ATP concentrations revealed two slopes (Fig. 3), which yielded two pairs of K m andV max values corresponding to the nonactivated and the ATP-activated activities of the 6PF-2K of CKB, respectively (Table II). In contrast, neither CKBR279A nor CKBR359A exhibited ATP activation (Fig. 3). Because these two mutations did not affect the K m of the 6PF-2K for Fru-6-P (Table II), it is likely that the ATP activation of the chicken liver 6PF-2K is caused by allosteric binding of ATP to the Fru-2,6-P2ase domain. To determine whether any of these two mutations grossly alters the secondary structure of the enzyme, the circular dichroic spectra of the mutant and wild type forms of CKB were examined. As shown in Fig. 4, the circular dichroic spectra of various forms of CKB were very similar: The wild type CKB may contain 29.1 ± 1.7% α-helix, 27.3 ± 1.3% β-structure, and 10.2 ± 1.2% turn; CKBR279A may contain 30.4 ± 1.7% α-helix, 26.9 ± 1.3% β-structure, and 10.7 ± 1.2% turn; and CKBR359A may contain 28.7 ± 1.6% α-helix, 27.6 ± 1.5% β-structure and 11.3 ± 0.9% turn. These data indicated that the mutations are unlikely to cause significant changes in the secondary structure of the enzyme. This conclusion was further confirmed by the fluorescence spectroscopic analysis. Fig.5 shows that there were no significant differences between either of the mutant forms and the wild type CKB in fluorescence quenching or red shift of the emission maximum caused by GdnHCl.Figure 5GdnHCl-induced changes in fluorescence of the mutant and wild type CKB. Each protein (final concentration, 20 μg/ml) was incubated for 20 min at 25 °C with various concentrations of GdnHCl. The fluorescence was measured with the excitation wavelength of 295 nm. The emission maximum (upper panel) and fluorescence intensity at 335 nm (lower panel) for CKB (○), CKBR279A (▿), CKBR359A (■), and CKB-RCT (⋄) are shown. Assays were performed in duplicate, and the results represent at least two separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although the analysis of the kinetic parameters of the two mutants suggested that the binding of ATP to the Fru-2,6-P2ase domain regulates the 6PF-2K activity allosterically, direct measurement of ATP binding of the enzyme should provide more straightforward evidence. Thus the ATP binding properties of these different forms of CKB were investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy, using Mant-ATP as ligand. Mant-ATP had been previously used to study the ATP binding properties of RKB and the rat testis enzyme (21Vertommen D. Bertrand L. Sontag B. Di Pietro A. Louckx M.P. Vidal H. Hue L. Rider M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17875-17880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 32Uyeda K. Wang X.L. Mizuguchi H. Li Y. Nguyen C. Hasemann C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7867-7872Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). CKB could utilize Mant-ATP as phosphate donor with a K m value of 14 μm and V max of 75 milliunits/mg. In addition, the 6PF-2K activities were inhibited by Mant-ATP at higher concentrations (>0.1 mm) (data not shown), consistent with the report on the rat testis enzyme (32Uyeda K. Wang X.L. Mizuguchi H. Li Y. Nguyen C. Hasemann C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7867-7872Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The addition of CKB resulted in an increase of the fluorescence of the Mant-ATP under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” Such an increase caused by enzyme was used to analyze the binding of enzymes to Mant-ATP. A Scatchard plot of ΔF (the fluorescence change) versus ΔF/(Mant-ATP) (the fluorescence change over the concentration of Mant-ATP) showed that the wild type CKB exhibits an apparent negative cooperativity for binding Mant-ATP. As shown in Fig. 6, it seems that the wild type enzyme has two kinds of sites with different affinities for binding of ATP, as there were the two distinct slopes for ATP binding showing two different dissociation constants (K d ) (Table III). However, CKBR279A and CKBR359A did not show cooperativity in binding Mant-ATP (Fig. 6), and there is only oneK d value of CKBR279A or CKBR359A, which is similar to the high affinity value of the wild type CKB (Table III). We also tested the binding of the isolated bisphosphatase domain of CKB (CBD) with Mant-ATP. As expected, CBD bound Mant-ATP with oneK d value equivalent to the low affinity value of CKB (Fig. 6, Table III). These data indicate that the mutation of Arg-359 or Arg-279 to Ala eliminates both the binding of ATP to the bisphosphatase domain of the bifunctional enzyme and the activation of 6PF-2K by ATP in CKB and that the Walker A motif in the bisphosphatase domain is critical for the binding of ATP. Considering these together with the kinetic data, it is reasonable to conclude that the ATP activation of the chicken liver 6PF-2K is caused by the allosteric binding of ATP to the Fru-2,6-P2ase domain of the enzyme.Table IIIDissociation constants of Mant-ATP to the wild type and mutant enzymesEnzyme formsCKBCKBR279ACKBR359ACBDCKB-RCTRKBK d (μm)1.5 ± 0.31.7 ± 0.51.7 ± 0.445 ± 101.8 ± 0.40.7 ± 0.266 ± 1252 ± 1026 ± 7The binding was measured by fluorescence spectroscopy as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” The dissociation constants (K d ) were calculated from the double reciprocal plot of the values of integrated differential fluorescence intensity against the corresponding concentrations of Mant-ATP using a hyperbolic regression analysis program.

The data were the means of three determinations. Despite the high homology between RKB and CKB, ATP activation of 6PF-2K was not observed in RKB. It raised the question of whether this difference is due to the divergence in their amino acid sequences at the C and N termini, in which the majority of amino acid sequence differences between the two enzymes are found. Recently, we found that a chimeric enzyme, CKB-RCT, in which the C-terminal sequence of CKB was replaced with that of the RKB, mimicked RKB in all of the kinetic properties of the Fru-2,6-P2ase activity (17Zhu Z. Ling S. Yang Q.H. Li L. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 1195-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). It was interesting to see whether the replacement of the C-terminal tail also affects the kinetic behavior of the N-terminal 6PF-2K. In comparison with the wild type CKB and RKB, CKB-RCT was more like RKB than CKB in the 6PF-2K properties; particularly, the 6PF-2K of CKB-RCT could not be activated by substrate ATP (Table II and Fig.7 A). Regardless of their different kinetic properties in the 6PF-2K activity, CKB, RKB, and CKB-RCT had similar properties in binding to Mant-ATP, as shown in Fig. 7 B and Table III. Thus, the difference in the C-terminal tails between these two hepatic enzymes may be accounted for by the differences in the kinetic properties of the 6PF-2K in respect to ATP. The two K d values of RKB for Mant-ATP were in the same ranges as those of CKB (Table III), and the K d value for the high affinity binding was also similar to that of the rat testis enzyme (32Uyeda K. Wang X.L. Mizuguchi H. Li Y. Nguyen C. Hasemann C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7867-7872Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, these values were different from those of RKB as reported by Vertommenet al. (21Vertommen D. Bertrand L. Sontag B. Di Pietro A. Louckx M.P. Vidal H. Hue L. Rider M.H. J. Biol.

Two models, the pre-existent asymmetric model and the ligand-induced sequential model, have been proposed to explain the apparent negative cooperativity (33Wang Z-. X. Pan X-. M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The present study supports the pre-existent asymmetric model for the binding of ATP to the bifunctional enzymes. It is the allosteric binding of ATP to the bisphosphatase domain that causes the activation of 6PF-2K in CKB. The binding of the bisphosphatase domain to ATP is specific because it has a Walker A motif, which is typical of nucleotide-binding. In addition, Arg-279, a basic residue within this motif, has here been proved vital for binding of ATP. Another basic residue, Arg-359, is equally important for the binding of ATP to the bisphosphatase domain; this was suggested initially by Lee et al. (22Lee Y.H. Okar D. Lin K. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11002-11010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and confirmed by our present work. Although the Fru-2,6-P2ase domain shares homology with proteins of the acid phosphatases and phosphoglycerate mutase families, neither acid phosphatases and phosphoglycerate mutases possess the nucleotide-binding motif (3Bazan J.F. Fletterick R.J. Pilkis S.J. Prog. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9642-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The appearance of the nucleotide-binding sequence (273Gly-Leu-Ser-Thr-Arg-Gly-Arg-Gln280 in CKB) in the bisphosphatase domain of the bifunctional enzyme might be an event that occurs later in evolution to meet the demand of the multiple and subtle regulations of the critical bifunctional enzyme. High concentrations of ATP favor the binding of ATP to the allosteric binding site in the bisphosphatase domain, which might induce a global structural change of that domain, and this in turn affects the catalytic core of the kinase domain, resulting in the activation of 6PF-2K. CKB is highly homologous to all documented mammalian 6PF-2K/Fru-2,6-P2ases. For example, CKB and RKB share about 88% amino acid sequence identity (34Li L. Lange A.J. Pilkis S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although RKB also exhibited negative cooperativity in ATP binding as revealed by a Mant-ATP binding analysis (Fig. 7 B), this isoform did not show ATP activation of 6PF-2K (Fig. 7 A). Interestingly, ATP activation of 6PF-2K was not observed on the chimeric enzyme CKB-RCT, where the C-terminal tail of CKB was replaced with that of RKB (Fig. 7). Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that the C-terminal region of CKB is involved in the activation of the 6PF-2K by the binding of ATP to the bisphosphatase domain and that the differences in the C-terminal amino acid sequences between the chicken and rat enzyme are responsible for the differences in their kinetic properties in respect to ATP. In addition, our recent work had revealed a role of the C-terminal tail of CKB in the mediation of the repressive effect of the kinase domain on the Fru-2,6-P2ase activity of the enzyme. 2Z. Zhu, S. Ling, Q. H. Yang, and L. Li, manuscript submitted for publication. Taken together, these data demonstrate the importance of the C-terminal tail in the modulation of the 6PF-2K activity by the bisphosphatase domain, and vice versa. Although the N-terminal tail of bifunctional enzyme is also critically involved in the regulation of enzyme activities, its role in the ATP-activation of chicken liver 6PF-2K remains to be determined. The V max ratio of 6PF-2K to Fru-2,6-P2ase was 6–13 for CKB, which was 2–4-fold higher than that for RKB (Table II), indicating that CKB behaves more like a 6PF-2K comparing with RKB. In addition, the 6PF-2K of CKB is activated by high concentrations of ATP whereas RKB cannot, and the inhibition of 6PF-2K activity of CKB by cAMP-dependent protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation is much less than that of RKB.2 Thus, the 6PF-2K activity is favored under physiological conditions. This idea is consistent with the observation that the chicken liver has a higher capacity for glucose utilization than the rat liver (35Pearce J. Int. J. Biochem. 1977; 8: 260-268Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 36Mapes J.P. Krebs H.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 190: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).

Manganese oxides, the more conventional cousins of the cuprates, have been studied intensively to test the quasi-particle concept. As
 Keimer
 explains in his Perspective, the manganites seemed to behave even more strangely than the cuprates, but a report by
 Chuang
 et al.
 now comes to the rescue of the quasi-particles. The case remains open for the cuprates."
