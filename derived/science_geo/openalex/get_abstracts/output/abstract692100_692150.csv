https://openalex.org/W4220830840,"Virus-like particle (VLP) and live virus assays were used to investigate neutralizing immunity against Delta and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants in 259 samples from 128 vaccinated individuals. Following Delta breakthrough infection, titers against WT rose 57-fold and 3.1-fold compared with uninfected boosted and unboosted individuals, respectively, versus only a 5.8-fold increase and 3.1-fold decrease for Omicron breakthrough infection. Among immunocompetent, unboosted patients, Delta breakthrough infections induced 10.8-fold higher titers against WT compared with Omicron (p = 0.037). Decreased antibody responses in Omicron breakthrough infections relative to Delta were potentially related to a higher proportion of asymptomatic or mild breakthrough infections (55.0% versus 28.6%, respectively), which exhibited 12.3-fold lower titers against WT compared with moderate to severe infections (p = 0.020). Following either Delta or Omicron breakthrough infection, limited variant-specific cross-neutralizing immunity was observed. These results suggest that Omicron breakthrough infections are less immunogenic than Delta, thus providing reduced protection against reinfection or infection from future variants."
https://openalex.org/W4221088689,"The rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant, including in highly vaccinated populations, has raised important questions about the efficacy of current vaccines. In this study, we show that the mRNA-based BNT162b2 vaccine and the adenovirus-vector-based Ad26.COV2.S vaccine provide robust protection against high-dose challenge with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in cynomolgus macaques. We vaccinated 30 macaques with homologous and heterologous prime-boost regimens with BNT162b2 and Ad26.COV2.S. Following Omicron challenge, vaccinated macaques demonstrated rapid control of virus in bronchoalveolar lavage, and most vaccinated animals also controlled virus in nasal swabs. However, 4 vaccinated animals that had moderate Omicron-neutralizing antibody titers and undetectable Omicron CD8+ T cell responses failed to control virus in the upper respiratory tract. Moreover, virologic control correlated with both antibody and T cell responses. These data suggest that both humoral and cellular immune responses contribute to vaccine protection against a highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variant."

Engineering these systems to meet clinical requirements has enormous medical implications. Here, we adopted a clinically driven design process to build receptors for the autonomous control of therapeutic cells. We examined the function of key domains involved in regulated intramembrane proteolysis and showed that systematic modular engineering can generate a class of receptors that we call synthetic intramembrane proteolysis receptors (SNIPRs) that have tunable sensing and transcriptional response abilities. We demonstrate the therapeutic potential of the receptor platform by engineering human primary T cells for multi-antigen recognition and production of dosed, bioactive payloads relevant to the treatment of disease. Our design framework enables the development of fully humanized and customizable transcriptional receptors for the programming of therapeutic cells suitable for clinical translation."

https://openalex.org/W4223575014,"GPR84 is an immune cell–expressed, proinflammatory receptor currently being assessed as a therapeutic target in conditions including fibrosis and inflammatory bowel disease. Although it was previously shown that the orthosteric GPR84 activators 2-HTP and 6-OAU promoted its interactions with arrestin-3, a G protein–biased agonist DL-175 did not. Here, we show that replacement of all 21 serine and threonine residues within i-loop 3 of GPR84, but not the two serines in the C-terminal tail, eliminated the incorporation of [32P] and greatly reduced receptor–arrestin-3 interactions promoted by 2-HTP. GPR84 was phosphorylated constitutively on residues Ser221 and Ser224, while various other amino acids are phosphorylated in response to 2-HTP. Consistent with this, an antiserum able to identify pSer221/pSer224 recognized GPR84 from cells treated with and without activators, whereas an antiserum able to identify pThr263/pThr264 only recognized GPR84 after exposure to 2-HTP and not DL-175. Two distinct GPR84 antagonists as well as inhibition of G protein–coupled receptor kinase 2/3 prevented phosphorylation of pThr263/pThr264, but neither strategy affected constitutive phosphorylation of Ser221/Ser224. Furthermore, mutation of residues Thr263 and Thr264 to alanine generated a variant of GPR84 also limited in 2-HTP–induced interactions with arrestin-2 and -3. By contrast, this mutant was unaffected in its capacity to reduce cAMP levels. Taken together, these results define a key pair of threonine residues, regulated only by subsets of GPR84 small molecule activators and by GRK2/3 that define effective interactions with arrestins and provide novel tools to monitor the phosphorylation and functional status of GPR84.

Sci. 2021; 4: 1598-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) can potentially provide insights into the former of these questions, but other reagents and biosensors will be needed to probe the degree of receptor activation. A broadly applicable feature of GPCRs following agonist occupancy is that phosphorylation of various hydroxy-amino acids within intracellular sequences of the receptor is stimulated and this promotes the effectiveness of interactions of the receptor with arrestin isoforms (12Wanka L.

This can limit the ability of the receptor to interact with G proteins and hence restrict signaling. It can also potentially promote other distinct signaling cascades and generally promotes movement of the receptor away from the cell surface and into intracellular locations. The patterns and locations of the amino acids that become phosphorylated in an agonist-dependent manner have been extensively mapped for a range of GPCRs (14Mann A. Illing S. Miess E. Schulz S.

These can then potentially be used as surrogate reagents to detect and demonstrate the extent of receptor activation in situ. Among ligands that activate GPR84, the recently described molecule 3-(2-((4-chloronaphthalen-1-yl)oxy)ethyl)pyridine 1-oxide (DL-175) is reported to be functionally “biased,” in that, although a potent regulator of G protein–mediated signaling, it is not effective in promoting arrestin interactions (21Lucy D. Purvis G.S.D. Zeboudj L. Chatzopoulou M. Recio C. Bataille C.J.R. Wynne G.M. Greaves D.R. Russell A.J. A biased agonist at immunometabolic receptor GPR84 causes distinct functional effects in macrophages.ACS Chem. Biol. 2019; 14: 2055-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and has distinct characteristics in signaling compared with the agonist 6-n-octylaminouracil (6-OAU) (21Lucy D. Purvis G.S.D. Zeboudj L. Chatzopoulou M. Recio C. Bataille C.J.R. Wynne G.M. Greaves D.R. Russell A.J. A biased agonist at immunometabolic receptor GPR84 causes distinct functional effects in macrophages.ACS Chem. Biol. 2019; 14: 2055-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Because we anticipated that DL-175 and 6-OAU might well produce a different pattern or extent of phosphorylation of GPR84, to obtain a fuller understanding of such potential variation caused by GPR84 activators, herein in addition we have assessed both 2-(hexylthio)pyrimidine-4,6 diol (2-HTP) as a potent orthosteric activator (7Mancini S.J. Mahmud Z.A. Jenkins L. Bolognini D. Newman R. Barnes M. Edye M.E. McMahon S.B. Tobin A.B. Milligan G. On-target and off-target effects of novel orthosteric and allosteric activators of GPR84.Sci. Rep. 2019; 9: 1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and the allosteric activator PSB-16771 (22Pillaiyar T. Köse M. Sylvester K. Weighardt H. Thimm D. Borges G. Förster I. von Kügelgen I. Müller C.E. Diindolylmethane derivatives: Potent agonists of the immunostimulatory orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPR84.J. Med. Chem. 2017; 60: 3636-3655Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This is a more potent analogue of the originally defined allosteric activator of GPR84, 3,3′-diindolylmethane (23Takeda S. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Matsumura E. Nose E. Kogure K. Kojima S. Haga T. Identification of surrogate ligands for orphan G protein-coupled receptors.Life Sci. 2003; 74: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We show that, although both 2-HTP and 6-OAU produce effective phosphorylation of human GPR84 at residues within the third intracellular loop, neither DL-175 nor PSB-16771 does so. Moreover, although each of 2-HTP, 6-OAU, and DL-175 acts as orthosteric agonists of GPR84, we use homology modeling and mutagenesis to provide a molecular basis for their differences in function and bias. In addition, based on mass spectrometry, we identify residues in the third intracellular loop of GPR84 that are phosphorylated constitutively. Production of antisera that identify specific sites of both constitutive and agonist-regulated phosphorylation allowed us to demonstrate that phosphorylation at amino acids Thr263 and/or Thr264 is required to generate highly effective interactions with arrestin-2 and arrestin-3 and that these amino acids become phosphorylated in a GRK2/3-dependent manner. By contrast, neither Ser221 nor Ser224, which are constitutively phosphorylated and not affected by inhibition of GRK2/3, plays a major role in arrestin-2 or arrestin-3-interactions. However, the phosphorylation status of neither of these sets of amino acids impacts on the ability of the receptor to regulate cellular levels of cAMP. Of importance, as GPR84 is markedly upregulated in a wide range of immune cells and in a variety of proinflammatory settings (4Wang J. Wu X. Simonavicius N. Tian H. Ling L.

In membranes prepared from such doxycycline-induced cells the ability of each ligand to cause activation of Gi-G proteins was measured via [35S]GTPγS binding assays. Each compound promoted an increase in binding of [35S]GTPγS in a concentration-dependent fashion with rank order 2-HTP > PSB-16671 > 6-OAU = DL-175 (Fig. 1B), and each ligand displayed similar efficacy at maximally effective concentrations (Fig. 1B). Activation of GPR84 with certain, but not all, ligands is reported to promote interaction with arrestin isoforms (21Lucy D. Purvis G.S.D. Zeboudj L. Chatzopoulou M. Recio C. Bataille C.J.R.

When hGPR84-eYFP was transiently coexpressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells with arrestin-3 fused to nanoluciferase, 2-HTP effectively promoted proximity and potential interactions between the receptor and this arrestin construct (Fig. 1C). 6-OAU was also able to promote interactions between hGPR84-eYFP and arrestin-3-nanoluciferase. Once more 2-HTP was substantially more potent than 6-OAU, although it was not possible to add 6-OAU at sufficiently high concentrations to allow full concentration–response curves to be defined (Fig. 1C) because both compounds displayed substantially lower potency than in the [35S]GTPγS binding studies (compare Fig. 1, B and C). In contrast, DL-175 did not promote measurable interactions between hGPR84-eYFP and arrestin-3-nanoluciferase at any concentration that was practical to assess (Fig. 1C) and neither did PSB-16671 (Fig. 1C). However, as anticipated for a positive allosteric modulator at GPR84 (7Mancini S.J. Mahmud Z.A. Jenkins L. Bolognini D. Newman R. Barnes M. Edye M.E. McMahon S.B. Tobin A.B. Milligan G.

Chem. 2017; 60: 3636-3655Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) PSB-16671 substantially increased (p < 0.0001) the potency of 2-HTP in such arrestin-3 interaction studies (Fig. 1D), and this was also the case for 6-OAU (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1E). By contrast, coaddition of DL-175 did not increase the observed potency of 2-HTP (Fig. 1D) or 6-OAU (Fig. 1E). Interaction of a GPCR with an arrestin is often dependent upon phosphorylation of the receptor that occurs subsequent to agonist occupancy of the receptor (12Wanka L. Behr V. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Arrestin-dependent internalization of rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptors.Biol. Chem. 2021; 403: 133-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). To examine this directly we labeled Flp-In TREx 293 cells induced to express hGPR84-eYFP with [32P] orthophosphate and then treated the cells with vehicle or a concentration of 2-HTP (3.7 × 10-6 M) determined to produce an EC90 effect in the arrestin-3 interaction BRET assay. Lysates of these cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) antiserum (that also identifies eYFP) and then resolved by SDS-PAGE. After drying, such gels were subsequently exposed to X-ray film. No substantial incorporation of [32P] was detected in vehicle-treated samples. However, clear incorporation of [32P] into polypeptide(s) with molecular mass corresponding to some 80 kDa was observed following treatment with 2-HTP, with close to maximal incorporation of [32P] achieved within 5 min of agonist exposure (Fig. 2A). 6-OAU (6.4 × 10−5 M) also effectively promoted incorporation of [32P] into hGPR84-eYFP (Fig. 2B). Because neither DL-175 nor PSB-16671 produced effective interactions of hGPR84-eYFP with arrestin-3, and therefore no EC90 concentration could be defined, for [32P]-phosphorylation studies we employed concentrations of these ligands that were 100 times greater than their EC90 concentrations in [35S]GTPγS binding studies on the basis that, as shown earlier, 2-HTP and 6-OAU were to this extent less potent in the arrestin-3 interaction studies than in [35S]GTPγS binding studies. However, even at these concentrations, no significant incorporation of [32P] into hGPR84-eYFP was observed in samples treated with either DL-175 (9.8 × 10−5 M) or PSB-16671 (1.3 × 10−5 M) (Fig. 2B). As expected, the ability of 2-HTP to promote phosphorylation of hGPR84-eYFP was prevented by coincubation with either of two chemically distinct GPR84 antagonists, GLPG1205 (8Labéguère F. Dupont S.

https://openalex.org/W4223995997,"Spaghetti meat (SM), woody breast (WB), and white striping (WS) are myopathies that affect the pectoral muscle of fast-growing broiler chickens. The prevalence and possible risk factors of these myopathies have been reported in other countries, but not yet in Canada. Thus, the objective of this study was to assess the prevalence and risk factors associated with these myopathies in a representative population of Canadian broilers. From May 2019 to March 2020, 250 random breast fillets from each of 37 flocks (total, 9,250) were obtained from two processing plants and assessed for the presence and severity of myopathies. Demographic data (e.g., sex and average live weight), environmental conditions during the grow-out period (e.g., temperature), and husbandry parameters (e.g., vaccination) were collected for each flock. Associations between these factors and the myopathies were tested using logistic regression analyses. The prevalence of SM, severe WB, and mild or moderate WS was 36.3% (95% CI: 35.3-37.3), 11.8% (95% CI: 11.2-12.5), and 96.0% (95% CI: 95.6-96.4), respectively. Most (85.1%) of the fillets showed multiple myopathies. Regression analyses showed that the odds of SM increased with live weight (OR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.01-1.69) and higher environmental temperature during the grow-out period (OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.31-2.34). The odds of WB increased with live weight (OR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.03-1.47) and when flocks were not vaccinated against coccidia (OR = 1.86, 95% CI 1.51-2.29). This study documents for the first time a high prevalence of myopathies in Ontario broilers, and suggests that these lesions may have a significant economic impact on the Canadian poultry industry. Our results indicate that environmental conditions and husbandry are associated with the development of breast myopathies, in agreement with the current literature. Future studies are needed to determine how risk factors can promote the occurrence of these conditions, in order to implement possible mitigating strategies."

https://openalex.org/W4224125533,"This study examined the distinctive roles of chronotype and trait self-control in predicting sleep quality and the mediation of sleep hygiene habits and bedtime media use of the relations between chronotype, trait self-control and sleep quality. Self-report questionnaire measuring chronotype, trait self-control, sleep hygiene behaviors, bedtime media use and sleep quality was administered to 224 Chinese adult participants (83.5% female). A multiple mediation model was estimated with sleep hygiene habits and bedtime media use as parallel mediators of the relations between chronotype, trait self-control, and sleep quality. Chronotype and trait self-control positively predicted sleep quality. Results of mediation analyses indicated that trait self-control predicted sleep quality both directly and indirectly through pre-sleep stress management and keeping a restful sleep environment, whereas chronotype predicted sleep quality indirectly through pre-sleep stress management and bedtime media use. This study provides evidence for the possible mechanism through which eveningness and low trait self-control undermine sleep quality: Whereas bedtime media use and sleep timing irregularity are linked to poor sleep quality in evening types, environmental interference (e.g., noise or disorganization) appears to be more relevant to poor sleep quality in individuals low in self-control. These findings can inform the design of personalized sleep hygiene recommendations appropriate for the target population. Practical implications regarding sleep hygiene education and interventions are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4223936888,"Bloodstream infections have been the leading complications in cancer patients because they are at high risk for antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. There is increasing evidence from different parts of the world of the high prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant bacterial strains in cancer patients. The burden of the infection is high in developing countries, especially in Ethiopia. Data on bacterial profile and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns among cancer patients in Ethiopia is limited. Thus, this study aimed to determine the predominant bacterial species causing bacteremia and their antibiotic resistance pattern among cancer patients at University of Gondar comprehensive specialized hospital.A hospital-based, cross-sectional study was conducted on 200 study participants from March to July 2021. All cancer patients who developed a fever at the time of hospital visit were included in this study, and their socio-demographic and clinical data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Blood samples (10 mL for adults and 4 mL for children) were collected from each patient, and the collected blood samples were transferred into sterile tryptic soy broth, then incubated at 37°C for 7 days. Tryptic soy broth which showed signs of growth were Gram-stained and sub-cultured on blood agar, chocolate agar, MacConkey agar, and mannitol salt agar. The inoculated plates were then aerobically incubated at 37°C for 18-24 hours and the isolates obtained were identified using standard microbiological methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were done using a modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion technique following CLSI 2021 guidelines. Data were entered using EPI data version 4.6 and analyzed with SPSS version 20.In this study, out of 200 cancer patients included and 67.5% (135/200) of them were males. The majorities of study participants, 56% (113/200) of cancer patients were pediatrics and 26.5% (53/200) of them belong under five years of age. Out of 200 patient samples that had undergone culture, 27% (54/200) samples had bacterial growth. Gram-positive bacterial isolates were predominant, 61.1%, and S. aureus was the predominant Gram-positive isolate, (51.5.6%), followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci (48.5%). Moreover, K. pneumoniae (47%) and P. aeruginosa (29.5%) were the most common Gram-negative bacterial isolates. Among patients who had BSIs, the highest prevalence of BSIs was observed among males (66.7%), and in pediatrics cancer patients (44.2%). Pediatric study participants were more venerable to bloodstream infection (P = 0.000) compared to adult participants. Meropenem (100%), amikacin (100%), piperacillin/tazobactam (72.3%), and ceftazidime (73.5%) were effective against for Gram-negative isolates while cefoxitin (81.2%) and penicillin (70.5%) were effective for Gram-positive isolates. Additionally, most Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial isolates were sensitive for gentamycin (75.9%). Multidrug resistance was seen among 17.1% bacterial isolates, and MDR in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria were 83.3% and 16.7%, respectively. Gram-negative bacterial isolates showed a high prevalence of MDR than Gram-positive isolates.BSI's remains an important health problem in cancer patients, and Gram-positive bacteria were more common as etiologic agents of BSIs in cancer patients. S. aureus was the dominant bacteria followed by CoNS, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa. Multidrug-resistant isolates found in cancer patients and routine bacterial surveillance and study of their resistance patterns may guide successful antimicrobial therapy and improve the quality of care. Therefore, strict regulation of antibiotic stewardship and infection control programs should be considered in the study area."

https://openalex.org/W4225620561,"Culture and demography jointly facilitate flexible human adaptation, yet it still remains unclear how social learning operates in populations with age structure. Here, we present a mathematical model of the evolution of social learning in a population with different age classes. We investigate how demographic processes affect the adaptive value of culture, cultural adaptation and population growth, and identify the conditions that favor learning from older vs. younger individuals. We find that, even with age structure, social learning can evolve without increasing population fitness, i.e., ""Rogers' paradox"" still holds. However, a process of ""demographic filtering"", together with cultural transmission, can generate cumulative improvements in adaptation levels. We further show that older age classes have higher proportions of adaptive behavior when the environment is stable and adaptive behavior is hard to acquire but important to survival. Through individual-based simulations comparing temporal and spatial variability in the environment, we find a ""copy-the-old""-strategy only evolves when social learning is erroneous and the opposite ""copy-the-young""-strategy can function as a compromise between individual and social information use. Our results reveal that age structure substantially changes how culture evolves and provide principled empirical expectations about age-biased social learning and the role of demography in cultural adaptation."

Austin &amp; Staples were investigated using passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction assay and RBL-2H3 cell degranulation assay, respectively. The crude ethanol extract exhibited promising activities when compared with the known anti-allergic agents, namely dexamethasone and ketotifen fumarate. The ethyl acetate subfraction showed the highest anti-allergic activity among various sub-partitions and showed better activity than the crude extract, consistent with the high abundance of total phenolic and flavonoid contents in this subfraction. LC-MS/MS metabolomics analysis and bioassay-guided isolation were then used to identify chemical constituents responsible for the anti-allergic activity. The results showed that major components of the ethyl acetate subfraction consist of 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside, kaempferol-3-O-rhamnoside and luteolin-7-O-glucoside. The inhibitory activity of the isolated compounds against mast cell degranulation was validated, ensuring their important roles in the anti-allergic activity of the plant. Notably, besides showing the anti-allergic activity of X . tridentata , this work highlights the role of metabolomic analysis in identifying and selectively isolating active metabolites from plants."
https://openalex.org/W4224120785,"Background Untreated latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is a major source of active tuberculosis disease in the United States. In 2016, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended that screening for latent tuberculosis infection among individuals at increased risk be performed as routine preventive care. Traditionally, LTBI management–including both testing and treatment–has been conducted by specialists in the United States. It is believed that knowledge gaps among primary care team members and discomfort with LTBI treatment are significant barriers to LTBI management being conducted in primary care. Methods and objectives This qualitative study sought to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes, and skills of primary care team members regarding the LTBI care cascade, and to identify each stepwise barrier limiting primary care teams in following the USPSTF recommendations. Results We conducted 24 key informant interviews with primary care providers and nurses in Rhode Island. Our results demonstrate that overall, few primary care providers and nurses felt comfortable with LTBI management, and their confidence and comfort decreased throughout the cascade. Participants felt least confident with LTBI treatment and held misconceptions about LTBI testing, such as high cost. Although participants were not confident about LTBI treatment, most were enthusiastic about treating patients if provided additional training. Participants suggested that their lack of knowledge regarding LTBI treatment led to high rates of referral to specialist providers. Conclusion The gaps revealed in this study can inform training curricula for primary care team members in Rhode Island and nationally to shift the USPSTF policy into practice, and, ultimately, contribute to TB elimination in the United States."
https://openalex.org/W4224139489,"No data are available on severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the French overseas department of Reunion Island. This is unfortunate as the microorganisms responsible for the disease are likely to differ from those in temperate regions due to a tropical climate and proximity to other islands of the Indian Ocean region. The aim of this study was to assess the epidemiological, clinical, prognosis, and microbiological characteristics of patients with severe CAP in Reunion Island.This retrospective study evaluated all patients with CAP aged >18 years and hospitalized in one of the two intensive care units of Reunion Island between 2016 and 2018. Microorganisms were identified by culture from blood and respiratory samples, multiplex polymerase chain reaction from respiratory samples, urinary antigen tests, and serology.Over the study period, 573 cases of severe CAP were recorded, with a mean incidence of 22 per 100,000 person-years. The most frequently isolated microorganism was influenza (21.9%) followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (12%). The influenza virus was detected in affected patients all year round. Twenty-four patients with severe CAP came from another island of the Indian Ocean region (4.2%), mainly Madagascar (>50%). Two of these patients presented with melioidosis and 4 were infected with Acinetobacter spp.Our findings have major implications for the management of severe CAP in tropical regions. The most frequently isolated microorganism in patients with severe CAP in Reunion Island is influenza followed by S. pneumoniae. Physicians should be aware that influenza is the main cause of severe CAP in patients living in or returning from Reunion Island, where this virus circulates all year round."
https://openalex.org/W4229366503,"Arterial media calcification is an active cell process. This encompasses osteochondrogenic transdifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells followed by the deposition of calcium-phosphate crystals. Increasing evidence suggests a significant role for endothelial cells (ECs) in the development of arterial media calcification. This manuscript explores a role for endothelial dysfunction in the disease progression of arterial media calcification. Male rats were randomly assigned to four different groups. The first group received standard chow. The second group was given L-NAME (≈50 mg kg-1 · d-1 ), to induce endothelial dysfunction, in addition to standard chow. The third group and fourth group received a warfarin-supplemented diet to induce mild calcification and the latter group was co-administered L-NAME. Prior to sacrifice, non-invasive measurement of aortic distensibility was performed. Animals were sacrificed after 6 weeks. Arterial media calcification was quantified by measuring aortic calcium and visualized on paraffin-embedded slices by the Von Kossa method. Arterial stiffness and aortic reactivity was assessed on isolated carotid segments using specialized organ chamber setups. Warfarin administration induced mineralization. Simultaneous administration of warfarin and L-NAME aggravated the arterial media calcification process. Through organ chamber experiments an increased vessel tonus was found, which could be linked to reduced basal NO availability, in arteries of warfarin-treated animals. Furthermore, increased calcification because of L-NAME administration was related to a further compromised endothelial function (next to deteriorated basal NO release also deteriorated stimulated NO release). Our findings suggest early EC changes to impact the disease progression of arterial media calcification."
https://openalex.org/W4223546533,"Hyperammonemia is known to cause various neurological dysfunctions such as seizures and cognitive impairment. Several studies have suggested that hyperammonemia may also be linked to the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the direct evidence for a role of ammonia in the pathophysiology of AD remains to be discovered. Herein, we report that hyperammonemia increases the amount of mature amyloid precursor protein (mAPP) in astrocytes, the largest and most prevalent type of glial cells in the central nervous system that are capable of metabolizing glutamate and ammonia, and promotes amyloid beta (Aβ) production. We demonstrate the accumulation of mAPP in astrocytes was primarily due to enhanced endocytosis of mAPP from the plasma membrane. A large proportion of internalized mAPP was targeted not to the lysosome, but to the endoplasmic reticulum, where processing enzymes β-secretase BACE1 (beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1) and γ-secretase presenilin-1 are expressed, and mAPP is cleaved to produce Aβ. Finally, we show the ammonia-induced production of Aβ in astrocytic endoplasmic reticulum was specific to Aβ42, a principal component of senile plaques in AD patients.

Ammonia is a potent neurotoxin that causes severe damage to the central nervous system. It is formed in nearly all tissues of the vertebrate organism and is a byproduct of cellular metabolism: hydrolysis of amide groups of proteins, degradation of amino acids, deamination of amino-purines and -pyrimidines, oxidative deamination of primary amines, and glycine catabolism (1Seiler N. Ammonia and Alzheimer's disease.Neurochem. Int. 2002; 41: 189-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Deficient hepatic urea formation, urea cycle failure, and bacterial infection in the gut are the major causes of pathological accumulation of ammonia, which results in hyperammonemia (2Adlimoghaddam A.

Hyperammonemia has been shown to be a key pathogenic feature of the neuropsychiatric disorder hepatic encephalopathy (HE), which leads to an alteration in mental status and coma, as well as various neurological dysfunctions, such as tremor, ataxia, and seizure (4Häussinger D.

In the brain, where the urea cycle does not occur, astrocytes, the most prevalent glial cells in the brain, detoxify ammonia via glutamine synthetase and convert it to glutamine (7Norenberg M.D. Martinez-Hernandez A. Fine structural localization of glutamine synthetase in astrocytes of rat brain.Brain Res. 1979; 161: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar).

Taken together, all these findings indicate the contribution of ammonia in the symptoms of AD; however, direct evidence for a role of ammonia in the pathophysiology of AD is not concrete. AD is the leading cause of neurodegenerative dementia, symptomatically characterized by cognitive decline, irreversible memory loss, disorientation, and language impairment. AD pathogenesis is widely believed to be driven by amyloid plaques composed primarily of aggregated amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides and neurofibrillary tangles of the microtubule-binding protein tau. In contrast to amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles are less specific to AD, as they are seen in a greater variety of less common neurodegenerative diseases, such as progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and subtypes of frontotemporal dementia (14Gouras G.K. Olsson T.T. Hansson O. β-Amyloid peptides and amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease.Neurotherapeutics. 2015; 12: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Pathological, genetic, and biologic evidence have supported an important role for Aβ in the development of AD. An ∼40 amino acid Aβ peptide is derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is a type I membrane protein with a large N-terminal extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail (15Pinnix I. Musunuru U. Tun H. Sridharan A. Golde T. Eckman C. Ziani-Cherif C. Onstead L. Sambamurti K. A novel gamma -secretase assay based on detection of the putative C-terminal fragment-gamma of amyloid beta protein precursor.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 481-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Newly synthesized APP is subjected to N-glycosylation (immature APP: imAPP) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is subsequently subjected to O-glycosylation in the Golgi compartment as it reaches its mature form (16Tomita S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. Cleavage of Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein (APP) by secretases occurs after O-glycosylation of APP in the protein secretory pathway. Identification of intracellular compartments in which APP cleavage occurs without using toxic agents that interfere with protein metabolism.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6277-6284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Therefore, mature APP (mAPP) at the plasma membrane possesses both N- and O-glycans. APP is sequentially cleaved by two membrane-bound endoproteases, β- and γ-secretase, to generate Aβ. Numerous different Aβ species are known to exist, but Aβ40 are the most abundant peptides (∼90%) followed by Aβ42 (∼10%). In particular, Aβ42 is more hydrophobic and fibrillogenic than Aβ40 and is thought to be the principal species deposited in the AD brain (17Murphy M.P. LeVine 3rd, H. Alzheimer's disease and the amyloid-beta peptide.J. Alzheimers Dis. 2010; 19: 311-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). There is compelling evidence that production of Aβ is closely associated with neuroinflammation, and reactive astrocytes are localized tightly around amyloid plaques (18Orre M. Kamphuis W. Osborn L.M. Melief J. Kooijman L. Huitinga I. Klooster J. Bossers K. Hol E.M. Acute isolation and transcriptome characterization of cortical astrocytes and microglia from young and aged mice.Neurobiol. Aging. 2014; 35: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Astrocytes are known to engulf dead cells as well as protein aggregates such as Aβ and α-synuclein (19Chang G.H. Barbaro N.M. Pieper R.O.

Toll-like receptor 4 is required for alpha-synuclein dependent activation of microglia and astroglia.Glia. 2013; 61: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In addition, astrocytes with high Aβ load are frequently found in AD brain tissue (22Nagele R.G. D’Andrea M.R. Lee H. Venkataraman V. Wang H.Y. Astrocytes accumulate A beta 42 and give rise to astrocytic amyloid plaques in Alzheimer disease brains.Brain Res. 2003; 971: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Here, we show that ammonia directly triggers the production and accumulation of Aβ42 in astrocytes by inducing the endocytosis of mAPP from the plasma membrane, leading to its translocation to the ER. All of our findings provide evidence for a novel role of ammonia in the pathogenesis of AD, describing the direct connection between hyperammonemia and AD. To examine whether ammonia-treated astrocytes are amyloidogenic, we prepared cultured cortical astrocytes from rat E18 to 19 embryos (Fig. S1, A–E). We found that prolonged NH4Cl treatment significantly increased the amount of APP in dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A–D). Interestingly, elevated APP expression was only detected in the mAPP (N- and O-glycosylated) and not in the imAPP (N-glycosylated). These substantial changes in mAPP expression were also observed after a short application of NH4Cl (Fig. 1, E and F). Of note, the mitotic activity of astrocytes was significantly suppressed by NH4Cl (Fig. 1, G and H); however, wounding of a monolayer of primary astrocytes leads to a slow but directed migration, and no difference in cell migration was observed in NH4Cl-treated astrocytes (Fig. 1I). We also examined if ammonium acetate, another type of ammonium salt, increases the level of APP in astrocytes. We observed similar changes in APP levels as those found in NH4Cl-treated cells (Fig. 1, J and K). Furthermore, we found that the removal of NH4Cl from culture medium reduced APP to baseline levels (Fig. 1, L and M). A high level of NH4Cl inhibits protein degradation by increasing the pH of lysosomes (23Tanaka R.D. Li A.C. Fogelman A.M. Edwards P.A. Inhibition of lysosomal protein degradation inhibits the basal degradation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase.J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 261-273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the pH of cultured media containing 10 mM NH4Cl was around 7.9 (n = 7), whereas in control cultured media, the pH was around 7.5 (n = 7). The pH of culture media containing 10 mM ammonium acetate was around 7.5 (n = 4). We further examined if artificially elevated pH in the culture medium affects APP levels in astrocytes. We found that both short-term and long-term incubation of cultured astrocytes with alkaline medium (pH 8.7) did not alter APP levels (Fig. S2, A–D). In the brain, ammonia is the precursor of glutamine, a substrate for the production of both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters (7Norenberg M.D. Martinez-Hernandez A. Fine structural localization of glutamine synthetase in astrocytes of rat brain.Brain Res. 1979; 161: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Thus, we wondered if elevated glutamine alters APP levels. We first removed glutamine from the culture medium for 36 h (glutamine starvation) and stimulated with 4 mM glutamine for up to 24 h (24Nguyen T.V. Lee J.E. Sweredoski M.J. Yang S.J. Jeon S.J. Harrison J.S. Yim J.H. Lee S.G. Handa H. Kuhlman B. Jeong J.S. Reitsma J.M. Park C.S. Hess S. Deshaies R.J. Glutamine triggers acetylation-dependent degradation of glutamine synthetase via the thalidomide receptor cereblon.Mol. Cell. 2016; 61: 809-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We found that glutamine does not regulate APP levels in astrocytes (Fig. S2, E–F). In addition, prolonged inhibition of glutamine synthesis with L-methionine sulfoximine had no effect on APP expression (Fig. S2, G–H). These results revealed that ammonia modulates astrocytic APP expression levels, an effect that is independent of pH. Several ammonia transporters such as the Na+, K+, 2Cl− cotransporter (NKCC1) and aquaporin-4 (AQP4) have been reported in astrocytes (25Assentoft M. Kaptan S. Schneider H.P. Deitmer J.W. de Groot B.L. MacAulay N. Aquaporin 4 as a NH3 channel.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 19184-19195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 26Kelly T. Rose C.R. Ammonium influx pathways into astrocytes and neurones of hippocampal slices.J. Neurochem. 2010; 115: 1123-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used the NKCC1 inhibitor bumetanide and the AQP4 inhibitor TGN-020 and examined the expression of mAPP after NH4Cl stimulation (6Rangroo Thrane V. Thrane A.S. Wang F. Cotrina M.L. Smith N.A. Chen M. Xu Q. Kang N. Fujita T. Nagelhus E.A. Nedergaard M. Ammonia triggers neuronal disinhibition and seizures by impairing astrocyte potassium buffering.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 27Verkman A.S. Smith A.J. Phuan P.W. Tradtrantip L. Anderson M.O. The aquaporin-4 water channel as a potential drug target in neurological disorders.Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2017; 21: 1161-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Neither bumetanide nor TGN-020 prevented the NH4Cl-induced elevation of mAPP (Fig. 1, N–Q). These results suggested that mAPP levels in astrocytes were not regulated by these two ammonia transporters. In addition, we examined the time-dependent effect of NH4Cl in cultured cortical neurons and no change in APP expression was detected (Fig. 1, R and S). To determine if NH4Cl-induced elevated mAPP was caused by enhanced APP synthesis, we analyzed mRNA expression of APP. Prolonged treatment of cultured astrocytes with NH4Cl did not alter APP mRNA (Fig. 1, T and U). APP is known as an integral membrane protein expressed in many cell types. Therefore, we examined whether NH4Cl alters the cell surface expression of astrocytic APP. Cell surface biotinylation revealed that a 24 h, but not 4 h, NH4Cl treatment significantly increased the expression of surface APP (Fig. 2, A and B). However, when surface APP was normalized to total APP, we found significantly reduced surface APP after 4 h of NH4Cl treatment (Fig. 2C). The internalization of surface APP at the 4 h timepoint was confirmed by an antibody feeding assay (Fig. 2D). A reduced amount of surface APP, as well as an increased amount of internalized APP, was detected after NH4Cl treatment (Fig. 2, D–G). The amount of total APP (surface + internalized) was not significantly altered after NH4Cl treatment (Fig. 2H). We performed further internalization assays and found increased APP internalization in 24 h treatment groups (Fig. 2,I and J). These results indicated that ammonia induces APP endocytosis, but surface APP is recovered upon prolonged NH4Cl treatment. To confirm our hypothesis, we analyzed surface APP after 72 h of NH4Cl treatment, a time point when ammonia significantly increased the expression of APP in astrocytes (Fig. 1C). We found that 72 h of ammonia treatment increased the amount of surface APP, but this was not significant when normalized to total mAPP (Fig. 2, K–M). In addition, we examined whether astrocytic APP was internalized via clathrin-dependent mechanisms. We treated astrocytes with dynasore, an inhibitor of dynamin GTPase activity, stimulated with NH4Cl for 4 h, and performed a steady state cell surface biotinylation assay. We found that dynasore inhibited the endocytosis of APP (Fig. 2, N and O). Additionally, we used chlorpromazine, a blocker of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and observed similar results (Fig. S3, A and B). Taken together, these data indicate that ammonia induces astrocytic APP endocytosis via clathrin-mediated mechanisms but that prolonged ammonia treatment recovers the expression of surface APP. Since ammonia promoted APP endocytosis, we planned to determine the site of APP accumulation in astrocytes. We first performed immunocytochemistry to observe cellular localization of APP after NH4Cl exposure. In control cultures, APP expression was broad, but cells exposed to NH4Cl showed distinct localization of APP around the nucleus (Fig. 3, A–C). We also performed subcellular fractionations and found that APP was not localized in the cytoplasmic fractions but accumulated in the membrane fractions after NH4Cl exposure (Fig. 3, D and E). Since a high concentration of NH4Cl is a lysosomotropic inhibitor, we examined whether 10 mM NH4Cl treatment blocked lysosomal protein degradation in the astrocytic cultures. We observed that after NH4Cl treatment, the lysosomal protease inhibitor leupeptin increased the expression of mAPP but not imAPP (Fig. 3, F and G). The potent proteasome inhibitor MG132 did not alter APP levels, suggesting that APP is degraded through autophagy-lysosome pathways (Fig. S4, A and B). We then performed a chase analysis of APP degradation by cycloheximide (CHX), a potent inhibitor of protein biosynthesis, and found that the half-life of APP is approximately 50 min for mAPP and 25 min for imAPP (Fig. 3,H and I). Upon NH4Cl exposure, the half-life of mAPP was extended to around 1.5 h, but degradation still occurred. These results suggested that NH4Cl exposure increased mAPP stability and delayed its proteolysis. By using the fluorescent dye LysoTracker, we found that 72 h NH4Cl-treated cultures increased LysoTracker-positive lysosomal area (Fig. S5, A and B). To determine whether APP is accumulated within these lysosomes, we performed coimmunostaining of APP with LAMP2, a lysosomal membrane protein. Increased APP accumulation in LAMP2-positive area was observed after NH4Cl exposure (Figs. 3, J–N and S5, C and D). Taken together, these data indicate that although NH4Cl delays the degradation of mAPP, APP can still be degraded in hyperammonemic conditions. Recent studies in neurons have revealed that Aβ can be produced not only at the plasma membrane of neurons but also in intracellular compartments such as the ER, Golgi apparatus, and the trans-Golgi network (TGN). The generation of Aβ42 in the ER is thought to contribute to the development of AD (28Choy R.W. Cheng Z. Schekman R. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) traffics from the cell surface via endosomes for amyloid β (Aβ) production in the trans-Golgi network.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

S. A. 1997; 94: 3748-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Since APP was strongly expressed around the nucleus after NH4Cl treatment (Fig. 3A), we thought that the elevation of APP in this area might be caused by APP’s translocation to and accumulation in intracellular compartments. We found that the localization of APP to the ER was significantly increased after 72 h NH4Cl stimulation (Figs. 4, A–D, S6, A and B). An enlarged ER-positive area was also observed (Fig. 4E). In contrast, colocalization of APP with GM130, a marker for cis-Golgi, was less than the increase in colocalization with the ER (Figs. 4,F–I, S6, C and D). We did not observe an enlarged Golgi area after NH4Cl treatment (Fig. 4J). To determine whether the NH4Cl-induced enlargement of the ER-positive area was due to elevated ER stress, we examined the expression of ER stress markers, old astrocyte specifically induced substance (OASIS), and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1). Both OASIS and IRE1 expression were not affected by NH4Cl treatment and the phosphorylation of IRE1, which represents its enzymatic activity, was also unaltered (Fig. S6, E and H). To further confirm the accumulation of APP in the ER following NH4Cl treatment, we performed subcellular fractionation and purified ER-enriched (PDI positive) and Golgi-enriched (GM130 positive) fractions. We observed that mAPP was highly expressed in the ER-enriched fraction and meager in the Golgi-enriched fraction, and NH4Cl stimulation significantly increased the expression of mAPP only in the ER-enriched fraction (Fig. 4, K–M). To examine the translocation of APP from the plasma membrane to the ER, we performed an antibody-feeding assay and coimmunostained internalized APP with ER, Golgi, and lysosomal markers. Four hours of NH4Cl exposure induced a remarkable translocation of internalized APP to the ER (Fig. 5, A and B). Enlarged KDEL-positive areas were also identified (Fig. 5C). We also found APP localization in the Golgi and lysosomes, but the expression of internalized APP after NH4Cl treatment was less remarkable in these areas than that of the ER (Fig. 5, D–H). In addition, enlarged lysosome positive areas were not identified after 4 h of NH4Cl treatment (Fig. 5I). Interestingly, the localization ratio of internalized APP in the ER versus Golgi versus lysosome was equally distributed in the control condition; however, this ratio was shifted after 4 h of NH4Cl treatment and more than 60% of APP was localized in the ER (Fig. 5J). Together, these results show that ammonia induces internalized APP accumulation in the ER. We then examined the production of Aβ in astrocytes after 72 h of NH4Cl treatment. A selective increase in the production of Aβ42, the principal component of senile plaques in the brain of AD patients, was found in NH4Cl-treated astrocytes (Fig. 6, A and B). An increased Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio was also detected in these cells (control: 0.013 ± 0.0027, NH4Cl: 0.1173 ± 0.0065, n = 5, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001). We further examined whether Aβ42 accumulated in the astrocytic ER. We performed coimmunostaining of Aβ42 with ER markers and determined their colocalization after either 4 h or 72 h of NH4Cl stimulation (Figs. 6, C–H and S7A). We found that ammonia induces the production of Aβ42 in the ER and these amyloidogenic processes were inhibited by dynasore (Figs. 6, C–E and S7A). Furthermore, we examined if blockade of ER–Golgi trafficking by Brefeldin A modifies Aβ42 production in the ER. We found that Brefeldin A, which disassembles the Golgi complex (Fig. S7B), inhibited the production of Aβ42 in the ER (Fig. S7A). These data suggested that the retrograde transport of internalized APP from TGN to the ER may be the route of APP transportation. To confirm the presence of the two secretases that cleave APP to produce Aβ in the astrocytic ER, we purified ER-enriched fractions from cultured astrocytes and examined the expression of two secretases BACE1 (beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1) and presenilin-1. We found that both proteins were located in the astrocytic ER and no change in their expression was detected after NH4Cl treatment (Fig. 6,I and J). These results indicate that ammonia induces the production and accumulation of Aβ42 in the astrocytic ER. Finally, we examined the amount of Aβ in the culture media. Interestingly, dot blot analysis revealed that NH4Cl reduced the release of Aβ from astrocytes (Fig. 6K). We also examined which of the two forms of Aβ are involved in this reduction and found that only the amount of Aβ42 was slightly reduced (Fig. 6, L and M). These data suggested that Aβ42 accumulates in astrocytes and it is not secreted. To examine whether increased ammonia production is involved in the pathogenesis of AD in vivo, we intraperitoneally injected NH4Cl (5 mmol kg−1) in C57BL6/J mice, an acute model of hyperammonemia, and investigated its effect on APP. Shortly after the injection, a substantial increase in the level of blood ammonia was observed; these levels gradually returned to the baseline value in 2 h (Fig. 7A). Mice were video recorded after the injection, and their locomotion was scored, revealing a decrease in spontaneous movement immediately after NH4Cl injection, an effect which lasted for few minutes (Fig. 7B). Brains were harvested at 1 h- and 2 h-post NH4Cl challenge and showed significantly increased levels of APP in the cortex at the 2 h-post injection time point (Fig. 7C). The number and area of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive reactive astrocytes was increased following 1 h NH4Cl injection (Fig. 7, D–F), while the number of Iba1-positive microglia was not modified (Fig. 7, G and H), suggesting that acute hyperammonemia induced by this agent leads to astrocytic neuroinflammation. In order to further verify whether hyperammonemia induces the pathology of AD, we used the thioacetamide (TAA)-induced hepatic encephalopathy model in C57BL6/J mice (31Vasquez K.O. Peterson J.D. Early detection of acute drug-induced liver injury in mice by noninvasive near-infrared fluorescence imaging.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2017; 361: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Compared to saline-injected controls, TAA administration caused severe liver damage, including acute focal necrosis, vacuolization in some hepatocytes with mild inflammatory cell infiltration (Fig. 8A), and a marked increase in the concentration of blood ammonia (Fig. 8B). To investigate whether hyperammonemia leads to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, we labeled reactive astrocytes with GFAP and degenerating neurons using Fluoro-Jade C staining. We identified an increased number of reactive astrocytes, characterized by thickening of the cell body and cellular processes, as well as a progression of neurodegeneration in TAA groups (Figs. 8, C and D and S8A). The extent of neuroinflammation was further determined by the reduced expression of NeuN, a neuron-specific nuclear protein, in TAA-treated mouse brains (Figs. 8E and S8B). We then examined if the expression of proteins related to AD pathology were increased in TAA-treated mice. The expression of both APP and Aβ were elevated compared to saline injection group (Fig. 8, F and G). To determine the colocalization of these proteins with astrocytes, the only non-neuronal brain cells capable of detoxifying ammonia, we employed immunostaining. We found a strong signal for both APP and Aβ in TAA-injected mouse astrocytes (Figs. 8,H and I, S8, C and D). Together, these data suggest that hyperammonemia triggers neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, as well as elevation of APP and Aβ levels in astrocytes. Many studies have indicated that ammonia could be a pathogenic factor in the etiology of AD (1Seiler N. Ammonia and Alzheimer's disease.Neurochem.

While unmet social determinants of health (SDOH) have been associated with low uptake of preventive health services, this association is unknown for PrEP. To understand the relationship between SDOH and PrEP adoption in this population, we analyzed data from an online survey of HIV-negative YBLSMM aged 18-29 in New York City (n = 143). Participants completed a 17-item SDOH needs scale measuring basic, health/social-services, and economic needs. We used regression models to examine associations of unmet SDOH with outcomes of intention to use PrEP and current PrEP use. Of those not on PrEP (n = 114), 69 (61%) intended to use PrEP. More unmet SDOH needs overall were associated with intention to use PrEP (OR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1, 2.0), as were more unmet basic needs (OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.1, 2.5) and more unmet economic needs (OR 1.3; 95% CI 1.0, 1.7). Unmet SDOH needs were not associated with current PrEP use. Findings suggest that intention to use PrEP among YBLSMM is a likely marker of unmet SDOH needs, as YBLSMM with unmet needs may have limited resources to support moving from intention to actual use. Future research should evaluate programs engaging YBLSMM intending to use PrEP with interventions to screen for and address SDOH."

Seventy-four pregnant women newly diagnosed with GDM received MNT for one-week. The effect of glycemic control was evaluated by fasting and 2-hour postprandial blood glucose; and stool samples of pregnant women were collected to detect the gut microbiome before and after MNT. We used a nested case-control study design, with pregnant women with GDM who did not meet glycemic standards after MNT as the ineffective group and those with an age difference of ≤5 years, matched for pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) 1:1, and meeting glycemic control criteria as the effective group. Comparison of the gut microbiome characteristics before MNT showed that the ineffective group was enriched in Desulfovibrio , Aeromonadales , Leuconostocaceae , Weissella , Prevotella , Bacillales_Incertae Sedis XI , Gemella and Bacillales , while the effective group was enriched in Roseburia , Clostridium , Bifidobacterium , Bifidobacteriales , Bifidobacteriaceae , Holdemania and Proteus . After treatment, the effective group was enriched in Bifidobacterium and Actinomycete , while the ineffective group was enriched in Holdemania , Proteus , Carnobacteriaceae and Granulicatella . In conclusion, the decrease in the abundance of characteristic gut microbiome positively correlated with blood glucose may be a factor influencing the poor hypoglycemic effect of MNT in pregnant women with GDM. Abundance of more characteristic gut microbiome negatively correlated with blood glucose could help control blood glucose in pregnant women with GDM."
https://openalex.org/W4224044864,"Invasive mosquito vector species have been inadvertently transported to new areas by humans for decades. Strong evidence supports that monitoring maritime, terrestrial, and aerial points of entry is an essential part of the effort to curb the invasion and establishment of invasive vector mosquito species. Miami-Dade County, Florida is an important operational hub for the cruise ship industry and leisure boats that routinely visit nearby areas in the Caribbean, and freight cargo ships transporting goods from Miami-Dade to Caribbean countries and vice versa. To deal with the increasing public health concern, we hypothesized that mosquito surveillance in small- and medium-sized maritime ports of entry in Miami-Dade is crucial to allow the early detection of invasive mosquito species. Therefore, we have selected 12 small- and medium-sized maritime ports of entry in Miami-Dade County with an increased flow of people and commodities that were not covered by the current mosquito surveillance system. Collection sites were comprised of two distinct environments, four marinas with international traffic of leisure boats, and eight maintenance and commercial freight cargo ship ports. Mosquitoes were collected weekly at each of the 12 collection sites for 24 hours for 6 weeks in the Spring and then for 6 additional weeks in the Summer using BG-Sentinel traps. A total of 32,590 mosquitoes were collected, with Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti being the most abundant species totaling 19,987 and 11,247 specimens collected, respectively. Our results show that important mosquito vector species were present in great numbers in all of the 12 maritime ports of entry surveyed during this study. The relative abundance of Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti was substantially higher in the commercial freight cargo ship ports than in the marinas. These results indicate that even though both areas are conducive for the proliferation of vector mosquitoes, the port area in the Miami River is especially suitable for the proliferation of vector mosquitoes. Therefore, this potentially allows the establishment of invasive mosquito species inadvertently brought in by cargo freights."
https://openalex.org/W4224089802,"Background There were limited epidemiological data of pediatric COVID-19 in Asia outside China, especially during the era of the variants of concern such as the Delta and Alpha variants. The objective was to describe the clinical epidemiology of pediatric COVID-19 in a tertiary care center in Thailand from April to August 2021. The identification of risk factors for the development of pneumonia in these children was also performed. Methods This retrospective cohort study was conducted by retrospective chart review of all children aged 0–15 years admitted to Thammasat University Hospital care system during the study period. The risk factors for the development of pneumonia were analyzed using logistic regression. Results A total of 698 children were included for analysis, of which 52% were male. The mean age of the cohort was 7.2 + 4.5 years old. Radiographic pneumonia was identified in 100 children (14.3%) and a total of 16 children (2.3%) were diagnosed with severe and critical diseases. The mortality rate was 0.1%. Children younger than 1 year and children with comorbidity were at higher risk of developing pneumonia (Adjusted odds ratios 2.99 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.56–5.74) and 2.32 (95% CI: 1.15–4.67), respectively). Conclusion In the era of the variants of concern, the proportion of children with severe and critical diseases remained low. However, prudence must be taken in caring for younger children and children with comorbidity."
https://openalex.org/W4223929815,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a public health challenge and an increasing cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the precise role of serpina3c in the process of NAFLD. Male Apoe-/- /serpina3c-/- double knockout (DKO) and Apoe-/- mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks. Several markers of steatosis and inflammation were evaluated. In vitro cell models induced by palmitic acid (PA) treatment were used to evaluate the beneficial effect of serpina3c on necroptosis and the underlying molecular mechanism. Compared with Apoe-/- mice, DKO mice exhibited a significantly exacerbated hepatic steatosis, increased hepatic triglyceride content and expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism (SREBP1c and SCD1), promoted hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, promoted necroptosis by increasing expression of receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3), phosphorylated mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). Notably, serpina3c deficiency increased β-catenin, Foxo1, and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) protein expression. In vitro , serpina3c knockdown promoted necroptosis and lipid droplet formation under condition of lipotoxicity. However, these phenomena were reversed by the overexpression of serpina3c. Mechanistically, downregulation of serpina3c expression promoted Foxo1 and β-catenin colocalized in the nucleus under condition of lipotoxicity, consequently upregulating the expression of TLR4. Conversely, disruption of Foxo1-β/catenin by Foxo1 and β-catenin inhibitors decreased TLR4 expression and ameliorated hepatic necroptosis in vitro. This study highlights a novel mechanism that serpina3c modulates NAFLD development by inhibiting necroptosis via β-catenin/Foxo1/TLR4."
https://openalex.org/W4223991567,"Photography and photogrammetry have recently become among the most widespread and preferred visualisation methods for the representation of small objects and artefacts. People want to see the past, not only know about it; and the ability to visualise objects into virtually realistic representations is fundamental for researchers, students and educators. Here, we present two new methods, the 'Small Object and Artefact Photography' ('SOAP') and the 'High Resolution ""DIY"" Photogrammetry' ('HRP') protocols. The 'SOAP' protocol involves the photographic application of modern digital techniques for the representation of any small object. The 'HRP' protocol involves the photographic capturing, digital reconstruction and three-dimensional representation of small objects. These protocols follow optimised step-by-step explanations for the production of high-resolution two- and three-dimensional object imaging, achievable with minimal practice and access to basic equipment and softwares. These methods were developed to allow anyone to easily and inexpensively produce high-quality images and models for any use, from simple graphic visualisations to complex analytical, statistical and spatial analyses."
https://openalex.org/W4224004361,"The classification of biological sequences is an open issue for a variety of data sets, such as viral and metagenomics sequences. Therefore, many studies utilize neural network tools, as the well-known methods in this field, and focus on designing customized network structures. However, a few works focus on more effective factors, such as input encoding method or implementation technology, to address accuracy and efficiency issues in this area. Therefore, in this work, we propose an image-based encoding method, called as WalkIm, whose adoption, even in a simple neural network, provides competitive accuracy and superior efficiency, compared to the existing classification methods (e.g. VGDC, CASTOR, and DLM-CNN) for a variety of biological sequences. Using WalkIm for classifying various data sets (i.e. viruses whole-genome data, metagenomics read data, and metabarcoding data), it achieves the same performance as the existing methods, with no enforcement of parameter initialization or network architecture adjustment for each data set. It is worth noting that even in the case of classifying high-mutant data sets, such as Coronaviruses, it achieves almost 100% accuracy for classifying its various types. In addition, WalkIm achieves high-speed convergence during network training, as well as reduction of network complexity. Therefore WalkIm method enables us to execute the classifying neural networks on a normal desktop system in a short time interval. Moreover, we addressed the compatibility of WalkIm encoding method with free-space optical processing technology. Taking advantages of optical implementation of convolutional layers, we illustrated that the training time can be reduced by up to 500 time. In addition to all aforementioned advantages, this encoding method preserves the structure of generated images in various modes of sequence transformation, such as reverse complement, complement, and reverse modes."

It elaborates on trapping techniques, tools, lures, baits, and beetle preservation. The main rule of manual collecting is to not attempt to pry the insect out of the wood or bark, but instead, remove the wood/bark away from the beetle: gently and systematically. The main rule of trapping is that there is no general attractant; instead, attractants and traps should reflect the ecology of the targeted beetle taxa."
https://openalex.org/W4224093406,"Point of interest (POI) recommendation is a popular personalized location-based service. This paper proposes a Geographic Personal Matrix Factorization (GPMF) model that makes effective use of geographic information from the perspective of the relationship between POIs and users. This model considers the role of geographic information from multiple perspectives based on the locational relationship among users, the distributional relationship between users and POIs, and the proximity and clustering relationship among POIs. The GPMF mines the influence of geographic information on different objects and carries out unique modeling through cosine similarity, non-linear function, and k nearest neighbor (KNN). This study explored the influence of geographic information on POI recommendation through extensive experiments with data from Foursquare. The result shows that GPMF performs better than the commonly used POI recommendation algorithm in terms of both precision and recall. Geographic information through proximity relations effectively improves the recommendation algorithm."

In addition, caspase-1 amplifies inflammation by proteolytic activation of cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Modern mammals of the order Carnivora lack the caspase-1 catalytic domain but express an unusual version of caspase-4 that can activate both gasdermin D and IL-1β. Seeking to understand the evolutionary origin of this caspase, we utilized the large amount of data available in public databases to perform ancestral sequence reconstruction of an inflammatory caspase of a Carnivora ancestor. We expressed the catalytic domain of this putative ancestor in Escherichia coli, purified it, and compared its substrate specificity on synthetic and protein substrates to extant caspases. We demonstrated that it activates gasdermin D but has reduced ability to activate IL-1β. Our reconstruction suggests that caspase-1 was lost in a Carnivora ancestor, perhaps upon a selective pressure for which the generation of biologically active IL-1β by caspase-1 was detrimental. We speculate that later, a Carnivora encountered selective pressures that required the production of IL-1β, and caspase-4 subsequently gained this activity. This hypothesis would explain why extant Carnivora possess an inflammatory caspase with caspase-1 catalytic function placed on a caspase-4 scaffold.

Caspases’ distinctive cleavage specificity of signature substrate proteins results in programmed cell death of distinct phenotypes. For example, apoptosis is noninflammatory (2Martin S.J. Henry C.M.

The cell conformation changes as it blebs, shrinks, and decays without interrupting its immediate environment. In contrast, pyroptosis displays a lytic phenotype and is highly inflammatory (4Cookson B.T.

Mouse caspase-11, and human caspase-4 and caspase-5, have inadequate capacity to cleave pro-IL-1β (9Bibo-Verdugo B. Snipas S.J. Kolt S. Poreba M. Salvesen G.S.

Caspase-1 is activated downstream of caspase-11 in an NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain–containing protein 3) inflammasome–dependent manner, providing an alternative mechanism to produce IL-1β during noncanonical pyroptosis (7Kayagaki N.

Hence, pyroptosis is an essential first line of defense against pathogens by eliminating their replicating niche and influences downstream immune responses by producing inflammatory IL-1β and IL-18 (24Dinarello C.A. Overview of the IL-1 family in innate inflammation and acquired immunity.Immunol. Rev. 2018; 281: 8-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 25Garlanda C. Dinarello Charles A. Mantovani A. The interleukin-1 family: Back to the future.Immunity. 2013; 39: 1003-1018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). The proteolytic efficiency differences among caspases of the canonical and noncanonical pathways on pro-IL-1β highlight a pivotal difference in their contribution to innate immunity. Inflammatory caspases consist of a caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) followed by a catalytic domain with proteolytic function (26Ramirez M.L.G. Salvesen G.S. A primer on caspase mechanisms.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2018; 82: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Typically, CASP1 and CASP4 are contiguous genes, except in primates where CASP5 lies between these two genes (27Martinon F. Tschopp J. Inflammatory caspases and inflammasomes: Master switches of inflammation.Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 10-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). The dog genome contains a single caspase-1 and caspase-4-like gene (Fig. 1A). This gene encodes a protein called “hybrid caspase-1/caspase-4” or “hybrid inflammatory caspase,” (28Eckhart L. Ballaun C. Hermann M. VandeBerg J.L. Sipos W. Uthman A. Fischer H. Tschachler E. Identification of novel mammalian caspases reveals an important role of gene loss in shaping the human caspase repertoire.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2008; 25: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) which contains a caspase-1 CARD followed by a caspase-4 CARD and a catalytic domain (Fig. 1A). Early studies suggest that this gene originated via the deletion of a chromosomal segment encoding the caspase-1 catalytic domain and exon 1 of CASP4 (28Eckhart L. Ballaun C. Hermann M. VandeBerg J.L. Sipos W. Uthman A. Fischer H. Tschachler E. Identification of novel mammalian caspases reveals an important role of gene loss in shaping the human caspase repertoire.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2008; 25: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In our previous report of inflammatory cell death in mammals of the order Carnivora, we observed that the catalytic domain of the dog inflammatory caspase behaved like caspase-1 catalytically, despite its sequence identity to caspase-4 (29Digby Z. Tourlomousis P. Rooney J. Boyle J.P. Bibo-Verdugo B. Pickering R.J. Webster S.J. Monie T.P. Hopkins L.J. Kayagaki N. Salvesen G.S. Warming S. Weinert L. Bryant C.E. Evolutionary loss of inflammasomes in the Carnivora and implications for the carriage of zoonotic infections.Cell Rep. 2021; 36: 109614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Moreover, the caspase-1 and caspase-4-like gene seems to be common in mammals of this order (29Digby Z. Tourlomousis P. Rooney J. Boyle J.P. Bibo-Verdugo B. Pickering R.J. Webster S.J. Monie T.P.

Cao A. Kagan J.C. Evolution-inspired redesign of the LPS receptor caspase-4 into an interleukin-1β–converting enzyme.Sci. Immunol. 2021; 6eabh3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Given the importance of caspase-1 in inflammation through pyroptosis signaling and pro-IL-1β processing, we hypothesized that the loss of caspase-1 catalytic domain in Carnivora became compensated by reshaping the caspase-4 catalytic domain and function. We looked for caspases with similar domain architecture in mammals to test this hypothesis and approximate how the caspase-1 and caspase-4-like gene originated. Previous studies suggest that the inflammatory caspase locus is under extreme selective pressure, leading for instance toward a new inflammatory caspase in higher primates (27Martinon F. Tschopp J. Inflammatory caspases and inflammasomes: Master switches of inflammation.Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 10-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 31Bibo-Verdugo B. Salvesen G.S. Caspase mechanisms in the regulation of inflammation.Mol. Aspects Med. 2022; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mam.2022.101085Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). To understand the evolution of this locus in Carnivora, we set out to reconstruct the most probable protein sequence that represents the ancestor from whom the inflammatory caspase catalytic domain diverged in these mammals. Finally, we evaluated the substrate cleavage and specificity of this hypothetical ancestral inflammatory caspase. To investigate the occurrence of inflammatory caspases with the CARD–CARD–catalytic domain architecture in mammals, we performed a BLAST analysis search using the dog inflammatory caspase sequence as a query (UniProt: A9YEF4). We found a total of 24 proteins (Table S1), 23 of which were found in mammals of the order Carnivora (of the more than 270 reported species of Carnivora), and only one belonging to the order Artiodactyla, namely sheep. The high prevalence of the hybrid inflammatory caspase in Carnivora and the lack of a caspase-1 ortholog in this clade suggest that CASP1 deletion occurred early in the evolution of these mammals. Cladograms revealed that the first CARD in the hybrid inflammatory caspase grouped with caspase-1, whereas the subsequent CARD grouped with caspase-4 CARDs (Fig. S1). In addition, the catalytic domain grouped with caspase-4 (Figs. 1B and S1). Consequently, we hypothesize that, regardless of the CARD-dependent activation mechanism, the catalytic activity and specificity of the catalytic domain in the Carnivora inflammatory caspases would be caspase-4 like. Human caspase-4 and mouse caspase-11 cleave gasdermin D more efficiently than they cleave pro-IL-1β (9Bibo-Verdugo B. Snipas S.J. Kolt S. Poreba M. Salvesen G.S.

Accordingly, our hypothesis predicts that the catalytic domain of the Carnivora inflammatory caspase would cleave gasdermin D better than pro-IL-1β. We recombinantly expressed and purified the CARD-depleted version of the dog inflammatory caspase. We obtained an active and processed protein consisting of a large (p20) and a small (p10) subunit (Fig. S2). Utilizing in vitro cleavage assays, we calculated the catalytic parameter kcat/Km of the dog inflammatory caspase toward recombinant protein substrates gasdermin D, pro-IL-18, and pro-IL-1β. Strikingly, the dog inflammatory caspase cleaved gasdermin D, pro-IL-18, and pro-IL-1β with similar efficiency to mouse and human caspase-1 (9Bibo-Verdugo B. Snipas S.J. Kolt S. Poreba M.

We conclude that the dog inflammatory caspase is endowed with the biochemical properties that allow it to perform caspase-1 functions. Caspase specificity is dictated by interactions with amino acids in a bipartite sequence motif surrounding the cleaved peptide bond. Most caspases, including caspase-1, recognize the N-terminal portion of this motif. In contrast, caspase-4 recognizes the C-terminal side (9Bibo-Verdugo B. Snipas S.J. Kolt S. Poreba M. Salvesen G.S.

Because the usage of substrate recognition subsites is an elemental distinction between caspase-1 and caspase-4, we tested the specificity of the dog inflammatory caspase on peptides corresponding to the recognition motif by using a set of internally quenched fluorogenic substrates.

We employed positional scanning tetrapeptide libraries to further explore this concept and reveal subtle differences between closely related enzymes (32Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P.

The dog inflammatory caspase was tolerant of a broad range of amino acids, and it preferred His in position P2 and Val in position P3. It also demonstrated the typical preference of inflammatory caspases for bulky and hydrophobic amino acids in the P4 position favoring Trp and Tyr (Fig. 3B). Exploring of the specificity determinants in more depth revealed that the dog inflammatory caspase showed the highest correlation with human and mouse caspase-1 within the recognition motifs (Fig. 3C). Consequently, our prediction that the catalytic domain of Carnivora inflammatory caspase would have a caspase-4-like specificity is incorrect, and it has a caspase-1-like specificity. Interested in the evolutionary process that generated the caspase-1 function on the caspase-4 catalytic domain scaffold, we utilized ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) to examine the characteristics of the protein from which the Carnivora inflammatory caspases descended. ASR calculates a phylogenetic tree based on statistical analysis of sequence conservation and substitutions of existing proteins within a family (33Harms M.J. Thornton J.W. Analyzing protein structure and function using ancestral gene reconstruction.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2010; 20: 360-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These relationships allow for calculation of sequences that represent the diverging nodes within the phylogenetic tree and thus the ancestor of each branch. The resurrected protein represents the node from which the Carnivora inflammatory caspases diverged. We termed this caspase “node 22” based on the position on the phylogenetic tree (Figs. 4A and S4). The results of ASR analysis are site-specific probabilities for each position in the protein sequence (33Harms M.J. Thornton J.W. Analyzing protein structure and function using ancestral gene reconstruction.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2010; 20: 360-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 34Eick G.N. Bridgham J.T. Anderson D.P. Harms M.J. Thornton J.W. Robustness of reconstructed ancestral protein functions to statistical uncertainty.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2016; 34: 247-261Google Scholar). Only 5% of the node 22 caspase sequence was identified as ambiguous, defined as sites with <70% probability (Fig. 5A). All ambiguous residues in the node 22 sequence are indicated in Fig. S5. The node 22 sequence shares more than 80% identity with the dog inflammatory caspase and human caspase-4 but only 60% identity with human caspase-1 (Fig. S5). Because node 22 is the predicted ancestor of the catalytic domain of the Carnivora inflammatory caspases, we expected that these proteins would have the same specificity. Accordingly, we hypothesized that the Carnivora inflammatory caspase evolved from a protein that should have been able to convert pro-IL-1β. To test the specificity of node 22, we examined the cleavage efficiency on protein and peptide substrates. Node 22 appeared to have similar cleavage efficiencies of inflammatory substrates to the dog inflammatory caspase (Figs. 2 and 4, B and C). However, close observation highlights a significant distinction in the cleavage pattern of pro-IL-1β (Fig. 4B). While pro-IL-1β is preferably converted into the 17 kDa active form by caspase-1 (9Bibo-Verdugo B. Snipas S.J. Kolt S. Poreba M. Salvesen G.S.

Chem. 2018; 293: 7058-7067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the major observed proteolytic product of caspase node 22 was 27 kDa, an alternative product of unknown function and that can also be generated by caspase-1 (35Afonina I.S.

Proteolytic processing of interleukin-1 family cytokines: Variations on a common theme.Immunity. 2015; 42: 991-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). To investigate whether caspase node 22 can produce a bioactive IL-1β, we used a cellular reporter assay. When we cleaved pro-IL-1β with equal amounts of caspases (Fig. 6A), we observed similar levels of IL-1β signaling generated by mouse caspase-1 and the dog inflammatory caspase (Fig. 6B). Conversely, we observed 2.5-fold lower IL-1β signaling by caspase node 22 compared with caspase-1 (Fig. 6B). Mouse caspase-11 served as a negative control. These results signify that caspase node 22 has decreased ability to produce bioactive IL-1β compared with caspase-1 and the dog inflammatory caspase, implying that it has caspase-4-like specificity. If this is the case, the specificity of caspase node 22 on synthetic peptides should match caspase-4. Indeed, the catalytic efficiency of caspase node 22 toward the inflammatory caspase reference substrate WEHD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (AFC) was highly efficient. However, cleavage of caspase-1-optimized substrates by node 22 was substantially less efficient than cleavage by the dog inflammatory caspase (Table 2 and Fig. S6). We conclude that a caspase-4-like protease that lacked the ability to convert pro-IL-1β gave rise to the inflammatory caspase of extant Carnivora.Table 2kcat/Km of the dog inflammatory caspase and resurrected ancestral caspase of node 22 for Ac-WEHD-AFC and caspase-1-optimized substrates (Ac-WQPD-ACC and Ac-FEAD-ACC)SubstrateDog inflammatory caspaseAncestral caspase node 22kcat (s−1)Km ("

The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between nutrient intakes in three younger-middle-older generations of Tehranian adults by sex. Of individuals who participated in 2012-15 phase of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study, 1286 families (4685 subjects), who had at least two members of the family with complete data in two or three generations were entered in this cross-sectional study. The energy and nutrient intakes of parents and their young or adult offspring or grandparents-grandson/granddaughter dyads were compared. The differences were estimated using pairwise t-test and partial correlation. Data of parents with their offspring were paired based on living arrangement. There were 857 fathers (mean age: 55.4±11.1) and 1394 mothers (mean age: 50.1±11.4). The mean age of grandfathers and grandmothers were 69.4±7.9 and 63.7±8.5 respectively. The significant correlation in fathers-sons and father-daughter (living with their parents) pairs were observed for 9 and 7 nutrients, respectively. Correlations for most nutrients were significant for mother-daughter or sons (living with their parents) dyads. The mean percentage of energy from total fat and trans-fatty acids of sons or daughters (living with their parents) were higher than their parents. For most nutrients, there were no significant adjusted correlations between parents-adult offspring (living independent of their parents) dyads. Also few nutrient intakes of grandparents-grandson or granddaughter dyads were correlated. The nutrient intakes of adult offspring were not associated with their parents; this correlation for younger and older generations disappeared. There were weak to moderate correlation between nutrient intakes of parent-offspring dyads that lived with their parents. The resemblance was higher for mother-offspring than father-offspring. Overall, total fat and trans-fatty acid intakes of young offspring were higher than their parents."
https://openalex.org/W4224101856,"In modern society, dairy products have become increasingly important in our diet because of changes in consumption patterns due to urbanization. However, Chinese residents’ dairy consumption remains at a relatively low level, with great potential for growth. Exploring the main determinants of dairy consumption and their effect mechanisms not only helps to improve the health status of residents, but also has important policy implications for the development of China’s dairy industry. Based on the data of China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) from 1989 to 2011, this study empirically analyzes the impact of urbanization on residents’ dairy consumption. The results indicate that urbanization could significantly promote residents’ consumption of dairy products and the effect is higher in areas with low urbanization levels and in midwestern regions than in areas with high urbanization levels and in midwestern regions. From the perspective of effect mechanism, income growth, employment structure transition and the rise of modern markets are three important mediating paths. Additionally, the results imply that in areas with low urbanization levels, income growth and the rise of modern markets are the main significant mediators; while in areas with high urbanization levels, employment structure transition is a significant mediator. Moreover, in midwestern regions, income growth is a significant mediator, and employment structure transition is a significant mediator in all regions. These findings have practical implications for understanding the relationship between urbanization and residents’ food consumption and for further promoting residents’ dairy consumption and the development of China’s dairy industry."
https://openalex.org/W4224105332,"Professional development has been identified as an effective way to increase college STEM instructors’ use of research-based instructional strategies (RBIS) known to benefit student learning and persistence in STEM. Yet only a few studies relate professional development experiences to later teaching behaviors of higher education instructors. This study of 361 undergraduate mathematics instructors, all of whom participated in multi-day, discipline-based workshops on teaching held in 2010–2019, examined the relationship between such participation and later use of RBIS. We found that instructors’ RBIS attitudes, knowledge, and skills strengthened after participating in professional development, and their self-reported use of RBIS became more frequent in the first year after the workshop. Applying the Theory of Planned Behavior as a conceptual framework, we used a structural equation model to test whether this theory could explain the roles of workshop participation and other personal, professional and contextual factors in fostering RBIS use. Findings indicated that, along with workshop participation, prior RBIS experience, class size, and course coordination affected RBIS use. That is, both targeted professional development and elements of the local context for implementation were important in supporting instructors’ uptake of RBIS—but, remarkably, both immediate and longer-term outcomes of professional development did not depend on other individual or institutional characteristics. In this study, the large sample size, longitudinal measurement approach, and consistency of the form and quality of professional development make it possible to distinguish the importance of multiple possible influences on instructors’ uptake of RBIS. We discuss implications for professional development and for institutional structures that support instructors as they apply what they learned, and we offer suggestions for the use of theory in future research on this topic."

Altered functional connectivity has been shown to be altered in neonates born with CHD; however, it is unclear if these early life alterations are also present during adulthood. Therefore, this study aimed to compare resting state functional connectivity networks associated with executive function deficits between youth (16 to 24 years old) with complex CHD (mean age = 20.13; SD = 2.35) who underwent open-heart surgery during infancy and age- and sex-matched controls (mean age = 20.41; SD = 2.05). Using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version questionnaire, we found that participants with CHD presented with poorer performance on the inhibit, initiate, emotional control, working memory, self-monitor, and organization of materials clinical scales than healthy controls. We then compared the resting state networks theoretically corresponding to these impaired functions, namely the default mode, dorsal attention, fronto-parietal, fronto-orbital, and amygdalar networks, between the two groups. Participants with CHD presented with decreased functional connectivity between the fronto-orbital cortex and the hippocampal regions and between the amygdala and the frontal pole. Increased functional connectivity was observed within the default mode network, the dorsal attention network, and the fronto-parietal network. Overall, our results suggest that youth with CHD present with disrupted resting state functional connectivity in widespread networks and regions associated with altered executive functioning."
https://openalex.org/W4225422193,"Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) has been shown to act as a critical regulator in the processes of embryo implantation and endometrial decidualization. The expression and production of pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is essential for successful pregnancy, and aberrant production of PTX3 is involved in the pathogenesis of several vascular complications during pregnancy. Studies have shown that several transforming growth factor β superfamily members, including BMP2, can regulate female reproductive function by modulating the expression of PTX3 in human granulosa cells. However, to date, whether BMP2 can regulate the production of PTX3 during endometrial decidualization remains to be elucidated. In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of BMP2 on the expression and production of PTX3 and the underlying molecular mechanisms using immortalized human endometrial stromal cells (I-HESCs) and human decidual stromal cells (HDSCs). We demonstrated that treatment with exogenous BMP2 significantly suppressed PTX3 production by decreasing the mRNA level of PTX3 in both I-HESCs and HDSCs. The results also showed that BMP2 activated SMAD signaling by inducing an increase in the protein levels of phosphorylated SMAD1/5/8, and this effect could be abolished by pretreatment with the ALK2/3 inhibitor DMH-1 but not with the ALK1/4/7 inhibitor SB431542. Additionally, combined knockdown of ALK2 and ALK3 completely reversed the BMP2-induced suppressive effect on PTX3 expression, while concomitant knockdown of SMAD1 and SMAD5 or knockdown of SMAD4 completely reversed the BMP2-induced suppressive effect on PTX3 expression. Taken together, these results indicate that BMP2 suppressed PTX3 production by decreasing PTX expression, which is mediated by a canonical ALK2/3-mediated SMAD1/5-SMAD4-dependent signaling pathway. Our findings suggest that BMP2 may potentially regulate the process of endometrial decidualization by suppressing the production of PTX3 in humans."

Response surface methodology (RSM), instead of the single factor experiments and orthogonal tests, was firstly applied to optimize the condition parameters of the catalytic process. Results indicated that RSM is accurate and feasible for the condition optimization of catalytic denitrification. Better catalytic performance (71.6% N2 Selectivity) was obtained under the following conditions: 5.1 pH, 127 min reaction time, 3.2 mass ration (Pd: Ag), and 4.2 g/L Fe0, which was higher than the previous study designed by single factor experiments and orthogonal tests, 68.1% and 68.7% of N2 Selectivity, respectively. However, under this optimal conditions, N2 selectivity showed a mild decrease (69.3%), when the real wastewater was used as influent. Further study revealed that cations (K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and Al3+) and anions (Cl-, HCO3-, and SO42-) exist in wastewater could have distinctive influence on N2 selectivity. Finally, the reaction mechanism and kinetic model of catalytic denitrification were further studied."
https://openalex.org/W4223528528,"Unlike most riboswitches, which have one cognate effector, the bacterial yjdF riboswitch binds to diverse azaaromatic compounds, only a subset of which cause it to activate translation. We examined the yjdF aptamer domain by small-angle X-ray scattering and found that in the presence of activating ligands, the RNA adopts an overall shape similar to that of tRNA. Sequence analyses suggested that the yjdF aptamer is a homolog of tRNALys, and that two of the conserved loops of the riboswitch are equivalent to the D-loop and T-loop of tRNA, associating to form an elbow-like tertiary interaction. Chemical probing indicated that this association is promoted by activating ligands such as chelerythrine and harmine. In its native mRNA context, activator ligands stabilize the tRNA-like fold of the yjdF aptamer, outcompeting the attenuated state in which its T-loop base pairs to the Shine-Dalgarno element of the mRNA. Moreover, we demonstrate that the liganded aptamer itself activates translation, as authentic tRNAs, when grafted into mRNA, can potently activate translation. Taken together, our data demonstrate the ability of tRNA to function as a small-molecule responsive cis regulatory element."

Subjective and objective spherical equivalent power (SE), logMAR, pupil diameter, ocular aberration, and ocular axial length were evaluated. Measurements were conducted in a light room with high luminance (300 cd/m2) targets (photopic), in a dark room with low luminance (10 cd/m2) targets (twilight), and a dark room after 15 min of adaptation to low luminance (10 cd/m2) targets (after adaptation: AA). Differences between the three conditions were analyzed using the Friedman test and Scheffe's multiple comparisons.The results of logMAR were -0.20 ± 0.07, -0.08 ± 0.08, and -0.11 ± 0.08 in photopic, twilight, and AA, respectively, with significant differences between photopic and twilight (p < 0.001) and between photopic and AA (p < 0.001). Then subjective SE were -3.58 ± 2.04 D, -3.75 ± 2.08 D, and -3.74 ± 2.04 D in photopic, twilight, and AA, respectively, with significant differences between photopic and twilight (p = 0.007) and photopic and AA (p = 0.023). However, none of the other objective SEs produced a significant difference (p = 0.63). The pupil diameter and ocular aberration changed significantly in all conditions (p < 0.001).Subjective myopic refraction increased and visual resolution decreased in younger subjects. However, this change in refraction is less than one level (±0.25 D) in clinical optometry, so fully corrected eyeglasses are important when assuming refraction in twilight, and there is no need for additional correction."
https://openalex.org/W4223908880,"Emerging evidence suggests that signaling through the C3a anaphylatoxin receptor (C3aR) protects against various inflammation-related diseases. However, the role of C3aR in psoriasis remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible protective role of C3aR in psoriasis and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. We initially found that the psoriatic epidermis exhibited significantly decreased C3aR expression. C3aR showed protective roles in mouse models of imiquimod (IMQ)- and interleukin-23-induced psoriasis. Furthermore, increased epidermal thickness and keratin 6 (K6), K16, and K17 expression occurred in the ears and backs of C3aR-/- mice. Pharmacological treatment with a C3aR agonist ameliorated IMQ-induced psoriasiform lesions in mice and decreased the expression of K6, K16, and K17. Additionally, the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway participated in the protective function of C3aR. More importantly, the expression levels of K6, K16, and K17 in keratinocytes were all restored in HaCaT cells transfected with a C3aR-overexpression plasmid after treating them with colivelin (a STAT3 activator). Our findings demonstrate that C3aR protects against the development of psoriasis and suggest that C3aR confers protection by negatively regulating K6, K16, and K17 expression in a STAT3-dependent manner, thus inhibiting keratinocyte proliferation and helping reverse the pathogenesis of psoriasis."

More evidence indicates that long non-coding RNA participates in tumor initiation and progression. It's known that cancer susceptibility candidate 9 is an oncogenic long non-coding RNA in CRC. miR-542-3p is a negative regulator of CRC, while integrin-linked kinase could contribute to tumor progression and chemoresistance. However, the correlation among long non-coding RNA cancer susceptibility candidate 9, miR-542-3p and integrin-linked kinase in CRC is still unclear. We demonstrated long non-coding RNA cancer susceptibility candidate 9 in CRC specimens and cell lines overexpressed via real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Once long non-coding RNA cancer susceptibility candidate 9 was knocked down, it significantly inhibited proliferation, invasion, and migration of CRC cells in real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, cell counting kit-8, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine, and transwell assays, which also was validated in vivo. Long non-coding RNA cancer susceptibility candidate 9 negatively regulates miR-542-3p in a targeted manner, and the function of up-regulated miR-542-3p was confirmed similarly. While miR-542-3p negatively regulates integrin-linked kinase. Thus, we further verified that overexpression of integrin-linked kinase on down-regulated long non-coding RNA cancer susceptibility candidate 9 or up-regulated miR-542-3p significantly restored CRC cell proliferation via bioinformatic analysis, dual-luciferase report assay, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, RNA immunoprecipitation, and western blot. This study testified that silencing long non-coding RNA cancer susceptibility candidate 9 could inhibit proliferation and invasion of CRC cells by miR-542-3p/integrin-linked kinase."

Body composition was measured using a bioelectrical impedance (InBody770), and the dynamometry was performed by an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex System 3) for knee flexion and extension, and by an isometric dynamometer (Smart Groin Trainer), for hip adduction and abduction. Comparisons were made between dominant members (D) vs. non-dominant members (ND) and adductors vs. abductors (ADD:ABD) using the Wilcoxon test. There were statistically significant differences in the peak torques between the dominant and non-dominant members in the flexion function (Z = -4.198, p < 0.01) and in the extension function (Z = -4.197, p < 0.01) of the knee in concentric muscular action, and the flexion (Z = -4.198, p < 0.01) and in the extension (Z = -4.198, p < 0.01) of the knee in eccentric muscular action.

Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the original structure of seven factors was maintained in the Spanish-speaking version, with appropriate levels of convergent and discriminant validity. Positive and significant relationships were found between internal corporate social responsibility and organizational commitment, both at affective and normative levels. Finally, type of employment contract (permanent or fixed term) implied significant differences in employee perceptions of internal corporate social responsibility. Our results provide evidence for the validity of the Spanish-speaking version of the internal corporate responsibility scale, suggesting its future application in investigations of internal aspects of corporate social responsibility in Spanish-speaking organizational contexts."

Moreover, undiagnosed or poorly controlled diabetes can lead to lower limb amputation, blindness, and kidney disease. However, there is a paucity of information on the magnitude and associated factors among adult populations in rural pastoral areas. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the magnitude of diabetes mellitus and associated factors among Guji Zone Government Civil Servants, Southern Ethiopia.Cross-sectional study was conducted from March 1-14/2018, among 437 randomly selected Government employees of Guji Zone. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Data were coded and entered using Epi-data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was done to identify significant factors associated with the magnitude of DM. P<0.05 was used to declare statistical significance and odds ratio with 95% confidence interval were calculated.The median (±IQR) age of participants was 33 (±14) years of age. Overall, the prevalence of DM in the study population was found to be 16 (3.9%) [95% CI: 2.2-5.6%]. The prevalence of DM among males and females was 3.8% and 4.2% respectively. Age (<35 years) [0.21 (0.04-0.94)], increasing salt amount in dietary feeding [14.31(1.28-159.2)], Consumption of vegetable &fruit once per week [23.38(2.01-269.17)], diagnosed with HTN [21.35(2.28-199.37)], and Family history of DM [9.42(1.72-51.42)] were significantly associated with DM.Comparably lower prevalence of previously undiagnosed DM was found by this study. Being old, excess salt consumption, intake of vegetables & fruit once per week, hypertension, and family history of DM were significantly associated with DM. Therefore, the zonal Health department should enhance and strengthen the provision of health education programs and counseling about nutrition, weight control, and appropriate physical activity and advised the communities for mass screening for diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W4224087041,"One of the mechanisms explaining perinatal health inequalities could be inadequate antenatal care among some immigrant groups. Few European studies compared antenatal care use between different groups of immigrants taking into account individual characteristics. This research investigates the associations of three birth regions with the use of antenatal care, by also considering socioeconomic and migration-related determinants.We included 879 mothers born in Belgium, North Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa, and interviewed them in four Brussels hospitals after they gave birth, using an adapted version of the Migrant-Friendly Maternity Care Questionnaire. We additionally collected clinical data from hospital records. We carried out descriptive analyses and ran univariate and multivariable logistic regression models to estimate the associations of socioeconomic and migration characteristics with a) late start of antenatal care and b) less than minimum recommended number of consultations.The vast majority of women in this study had adequate care in terms of timing (93.9%), frequency of consultations (82.2%), and self-reported access (95.9%). Region of birth was an independent risk factor for late initiation of care, but not for infrequent consultations. Women born in Sub-Saharan Africa were more prone to accessing care late (OR 3.3, 95%CI 1.5-7.7), but were not more at risk of infrequent consultations. Women born in North Africa, had similar adequacy of care compared to the Belgium-born population. The three groups also differed in terms of socioeconomic profiles and socioeconomic predictors of antenatal care use. Housing type, professional activity, and health insurance status were important predictors of both outcomes.This study showed that the region of birth was partly associated with adequacy of care, in terms of initiation, but not number of consultations. Further dimensions of adequacy of care (content, quality) should be studied in the future. Socioeconomic factors are also key determinants of antenatal care use."
https://openalex.org/W4224139962,"This study sought to evaluate the impact of subject positioning on body composition assessments by air displacement plethysmography using the BOD POD®.Eighty-two adults (42 men and 40 women), aged 26.1 ± 8.4 y (mean ± standard deviation), body mass index = 23.6 ± 4.8 kg/m2, were assessed by repeated measurements in two different positions: relaxed (legs apart, back away from the rear) and compact (legs together, arms near the body, back touching the rear). We relied on Bland-Altman analysis to quantify the agreement between results recorded in the two positions. Using body surface charts, we tested the hypothesis that posture-induced variability stems from differences in exposed skin area.Switching from compact to relaxed position resulted in a bias of -197 mL for body volume, -1.53% for percent body fat, and 1.085 kg for fat-free mass. The body surface area in contact with air was larger in relaxed position by 3632 ± 522 cm2. When body volume was expressed in terms of the actual area of exposed skin in the compact position, the percent body fat bias became 0.08%, with a 95% confidence interval of (-0.14, 0.29)%.Subject posture is a source of significant variability in air displacement plethysmography. The disagreement between results obtained in different positions can be eliminated by adjusting the surface area artifact, suggesting that subject positioning in the BOD POD® should be controlled to avoid changes in the amount of air maintained under isothermal conditions by the body."

It highlights the value of using a standardized, easy-to-use tool to determine disability in children and contextualizing disability in children in light of their developmental needs. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted between September 2018–January 2019 at the Iganga-Mayuge Health and Demographic Surveillance Site in Uganda. Respondents were caregivers of children between 5–17 years and were administered an in-depth Child Functioning Module (CFM). The outcome variable, disability, was defined as an ordered categorical variable with three categories–mild, moderate, and severe. Generalized ordered logit model was applied to explore factors associated with disability categories. Results Out of 1,842 caregivers approached for the study, 1,439 (response: 78.1%) agreed to participate in the study. Out of these 1,439, some level of disability was reported by 67.89% (n = 977) of caregivers. Of these 977 children with disability, 48.01% (n = 692) had mild disability and 15.84% (n = 228) had moderate disability, while 3.96% (n = 57) had severe disability. The mean (SD) score for mild disability was 2.22±1.17, with a median of 2. The mean and median for moderate disability was 5.26±3.28 and 4 (IQR:3–6), and for severe disability was 14.23±9.51 and 12 (IQR:6–22). The most common disabilities reported were depression (54.83%) and anxiety (50.87%). Statistically significant association was found for completion of immunization status and school enrollment when controlled for a child’s age, sex, having a primary caregiver, age of mother at child’s birth, family system, family size and household wealth quintile. Conclusion This study suggests association between incomplete immunization status and school enrollment for children with disability. These are areas for further exploration to ensure inclusive health and inclusive education of children with disabilities in Uganda."

We aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of the MCP sT1w/T2w ratio for differentiating between MSA-C and spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). Methods We included 32 MSA-C, 8 SCA type 3 (SCA3), 16 SCA type 6 (SCA6) patients, and 17 controls, and the MCP sT1w/T2w ratio was analyzed using a region-of-interest approach. The diagnostic performance of the MCP sT1w/T2w ratio in discriminating among MSA-C, SCA3, and SCA6 was assessed and compared with diagnosis based on visual interpretation of MCP hyperintensities and the “hot cross bun” (HCB) sign. Results MCP sT1w/T2w ratio values were markedly lower in patients with MSA-C than in those with SCA3, those with SCA6, and controls ( p &lt; 0.001). The MCP sT1w/T2w ratio showed high diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing MSA-C from SCA3 (area under curve = 0.934), SCA6 (area under curve = 0.965), and controls (area under curve = 0.980). The diagnostic accuracy of the MCP sT1w/T2w ratio for differentiating MSA-C from SCA3 or SCA6 (90.0% for MSA-C vs. SCA3, and 91.7% for MSA-C vs. SCA6) was comparable to or superior than that of visual interpretation of MCP hyperintensities (80.0–87.5% in MSA-C vs. SCA3 and 87.6–97.9% in MSA-C vs. SCA6) or the HCB sign (72.5–80.0% in MSA-C vs. SCA3 and 77.1–93.8% in MSA-C vs. SCA6). Conclusions The MCP sT1w/T2w ratio might be a sensitive imaging-based marker for detecting MSA-C-related changes and differentiating MSA-C from SCA3 or SCA6."
https://openalex.org/W4223919221,"Introduction More people are living with and beyond a cancer diagnosis. There is limited understanding of the long-term effects of cancer and cancer treatment on quality of life and personal and household finances when compared to people without cancer. In a separate protocol we have proposed to link de-identified data from electronic primary care and hospital records for a large population of cancer survivors and matched controls. In this current protocol, we propose the linkage of Patient Reported Outcomes Measures data to the above data for a subset of this population. The aim of this study is to investigate the full impact of living with and beyond a cancer diagnosis compared to age and gender matched controls. A secondary aim is to test the feasibility of the collection of Patient Reported Outcomes Measures (PROMS) data and the linkage procedures of the PROMs data to electronic health records data. Materials and methods This is a cross-sectional study, aiming to recruit participants treated at the Leeds Teaching Hospitals National Health Service Trust. Eligible patients will be cancer survivors at around 5 years post-diagnosis (breast, colorectal and ovarian cancer) and non-cancer patient matched controls attending dermatology out-patient clinics. They will be identified by running a query on the Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust patient records system. Approximately 6000 patients (2000 cases and 4000 controls) will be invited to participate via post. Participants will be invited to complete PROMs assessing factors such as quality of life and finances, which can be completed on paper or online (surveys includes established instruments, and bespoke instruments (demographics, financial costs). This PROMs data will then be linked to routinely collected de-identified data from patient’s electronic primary care and hospital records. Discussion This innovative work aims to create a truly ‘comprehensive patient record’ to provide a broad picture of what happens to cancer patients across their cancer pathway, and the long-term impact of cancer treatment. Comparisons can be made between the cases and controls, to identify the aspects of life that has had the greatest impact following a cancer diagnosis. The feasibility of linking PROMs data to electronic health records can also be assessed. This work can inform future support offered to people living with and beyond a cancer diagnosis, clinical practice, and future research methodologies."
https://openalex.org/W4223940150,"This study was an in-depth exploration of unique data from a nationally representative sample of adults living in the United States to identify biomarkers associated with musculoskeletal pain.We performed secondary analyses of 2003-2004 NHANES data. After a first screening of 187 markers, analyses of 31 biomarkers were conducted on participants aged ≥20 years identified in all counties using the 2000 Census Bureau data (n = 4,742). To assess the association of each biomarker with each pain outcome (acute, subacute and chronic low back, neck, and shoulder pain), analyses were carried out using multivariable logistic regression with adjustments for sex, age and body mass index. Biomarkers were considered as continuous variables and categorized at the median of their distributions.Pain at any site for ≥24 hours during the past month was reported by 1,214 participants. Of these, 779 mentioned that the pain had lasted for ≥3 months (""chronic pain""). α-carotene, ascorbic acid, β-carotene, mercury and total protein had a statistically significant, inverse association with ≥2 chronic pain sites. Acrylamide, alkaline phosphatase, cadmium, cotinine, glycidamide, homocysteine, retinol, triglycerides and white blood cell count were positively associated with ≥2 chronic pain sites. Few biological markers were associated with acute and subacute pain.This study identified some biomarkers that were strongly and consistently associated with musculoskeletal pain. These results raise new hypotheses and could have tremendous implications for advancing knowledge in the field. Research on musculoskeletal pain needs to put more effort on the biological dimension of the biopsychosocial model of pain."
https://openalex.org/W4224036361,"From 2014 to 2017, the Islamic State in Irak and Syria (ISIS), a terrorist political organization of Salafist jihadist ideology, had put in place an operational and relatively stable educational system. Among its Complementary Programs, ISIS included a curriculum for programming using the Scratch software. In this article, we discuss this curriculum by analyzing the content of the official ISIS programming textbook, with the objectives of characterizing: 1) the curriculum's pedagogical intentions and definition of programming; 2) the programming curriculum; and 3) the religious and military indoctrination value. We found that, first, ISIS's programming curriculum intentions are more about religious and military injunctions to build the caliphate than they are about developing 21st-century skills such as computational thinking. Second, although the progression of learning in the sequence of activities designed by ISIS seems logical and, overall, well-ordered, the ISIS programming curriculum does not encourage the development of 21st-century skills such as problem solving, discovery learning, or creativity-nor for that matter, the transfer of programming knowledge to different contexts. Finally, the textbook is particularly rich in elements of military and religious indoctrination and effectively participates in the indoctrination of students by helping to inculcate values consistent with ISIS's jihadist ideology. This contribution seeks to better understand ISIS's approach to education, which could provide support for initiatives aimed at rebuilding impacted education systems and groups."

Although the survival has improved over the years there is a significant gastrointestinal morbidity affecting physical function and health-related quality of life. The aims of the study were to identify and evaluate predictors of histopathological esophagitis in infants and adolescents with EA.Single centre, cross-sectional study including one and 15-year-old patients operated for EA that participated in the national follow-up programme between 2012 and 2020 according to a pre-established protocol including upper endoscopy with oesophageal biopsies and 24h-pH-test. Data was collected from patients' medical records and pH-analysis software. Regression models were used to identify predictors of histopathological oesophagitis. Possible predictors were abnormal reflux index, endoscopic esophagitis, hiatal hernia, symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and age.65 patients were included, 47 children and 18 adolescents. All children were treated with PPI during their first year of life. Symptoms of GER were reported by 13 (31.7%) of the infant's caregivers, 34 of the children (72.3%) had abnormal reflux index and 32 (68.1%) had histopathological esophagitis. The corresponding numbers for adolescents were 8 (50%), 15 (83.3%) and 10 (55.6%). We found no significant associations between histopathological esophagitis and endoscopic esophagitis, symptoms of GER, hiatus hernia or age group. Abnormal reflux index was an independent predictor of histopathological esophagitis. Seven patients with normal reflux index had histopathological esophagitis, all grade I.We found a high prevalence of histopathological esophagitis despite PPI treatment in accordance with recommendations. No significant difference between the two age groups was seen. Abnormal reflux index was an independent predictor of histopathological esophagitis. However, we cannot recommend the use of pH-metry as a substitute for esophageal biopsies; future studies are needed to elucidate if esophageal biopsies might be postponed in infants with normal reflux index."
https://openalex.org/W4224071542,"While the development of cities tends to focus on improving traffic mobility, it has gradually neglected people’s demand for safety and comfort walking on the streets. To address this problem, shared streets that can integrate traditional street life and traffic mobility are getting more attention as pedestrian-friendly development. In order to measure the performance of shared streets, it is essential to identify how people feel when driving and walking around. However, investigating the various factors that influence the real world is not straightforward because of cost, time-consuming, and safety problems. Virtual reality and the Human-in-the-loop (HITL) have become valuable tools for conducting experiments without compromising them. The experiments are performed on both pedestrians’ and drivers’ sides. The three shared street layouts in a virtual environment are designed according to Europe’s real shared street cases. To evaluate shared street effects, questions in five aspects: amenity, walking or driving experience, safety, economy or priority, and environmental perception are asked to participants, respectively. MPR, EWM, and Fuzzy Comprehension Evaluation methods are used to assess the performance. The result revealed that different groups of people have different sensitivity and preferences for each evaluation criteria. However, the results of the comprehensive evalutation showed that scenario C with the largest isolation measurement is preferable in both pedestrian and driver’s groups based on shared street design elements. The city planners can get help from this shared street analysis, where the new design and layout could be tested in advance."
https://openalex.org/W4224087217,"This paper primarily aims to provide a citation-based method for exploring the scholarly network of artificial intelligence (AI)-related research in the information science (IS) domain, especially from Global North (GN) and Global South (GS) perspectives. Three research objectives were addressed, namely (1) the publication patterns in the field, (2) the most influential articles and researched keywords in the field, and (3) the visualization of the scholarly network between GN and GS researchers between the years 2010 and 2020. On the basis of the PRISMA statement, longitudinal research data were retrieved from the Web of Science and analyzed. Thirty-two AI-related keywords were used to retrieve relevant quality articles. Finally, 149 articles accompanying the follow-up 8838 citing articles were identified as eligible sources. A co-citation network analysis was adopted to scientifically visualize the intellectual structure of AI research in GN and GS networks. The results revealed that the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom are the most productive GN countries; by contrast, China and India are the most productive GS countries. Next, the 10 most frequently co-cited AI research articles in the IS domain were identified. Third, the scholarly networks of AI research in the GN and GS areas were visualized. Between 2010 and 2015, GN researchers in the IS domain focused on applied research involving intelligent systems (e.g., decision support systems); between 2016 and 2020, GS researchers focused on big data applications (e.g., geospatial big data research). Both GN and GS researchers focused on technology adoption research (e.g., AI-related products and services) throughout the investigated period. Overall, this paper reveals the intellectual structure of the scholarly network on AI research and several applications in the IS literature. The findings provide research-based evidence for expanding global AI research."
https://openalex.org/W4229372934,"Hemocytes are invertebrate immune cells that are similar to blood cells in vertebrates and play a crucial role in innate immunity. Previous work has found that mature circulating hemocytes lack the ability to proliferate. However, recent single-cell RNA sequencing and functional studies in invertebrate have challenged this view. Here, we report that bacteria induced hemocytes proliferation in the Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis. Flow cytometry was used to collect non-proliferating and proliferating hemocytes populations, while the expression of EsCyclin E was highly expressed in proliferating hemocytes, but the expression of EsCsn5 was significantly suppressed in proliferating hemocytes. Subsequent studies have found EsCsn5 distributed in two fractions include holo-complex and monomeric form, whereas knockdown of EsCsn5 has little impact on the amount of the holo-complex. EsCsn5 was widely expressed in different crab tissues, while its expression was significantly reduced upon bacterial infection. Crab hemocytes showed significantly enhanced proliferation when EsCsn5 was genetically knocked down, suggesting a critical role for CSN5 in the negative regulation of crab hemocyte proliferation. Moreover, EsCSN5 but not the EsCSN8 was demonstrated to negatively regulate the early G1 phase of the cell cycle by controlling the degradation of EsCyclin E through ubiquitination steps, rather than affecting its transcription. Furthermore, in the EsCyclin E-suppressed crab there was a significantly reduced survival rate and an up-regulated hemolymph bacterial concentration. Taken together, this study provides evidence demonstrating that invertebrate hemocytes down-regulate the expression of EsCsn5 upon bacterial challenge, thus promoting proliferation in an EsCyclin E-dependent manner in order to protect the crab from infection."
