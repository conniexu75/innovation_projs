However, computational models suggest complex dynamics with discrete oscillatory bursts. We analyzed local field potential (LFP) and spiking from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of monkeys performing a working memory task. There were brief bursts of narrow-band gamma oscillations (45–100 Hz), varied in time and frequency, accompanying encoding and re-activation of sensory information. They appeared at a minority of recording sites associated with spiking reflecting the to-be-remembered items. Beta oscillations (20–35 Hz) also occurred in brief, variable bursts but reflected a default state interrupted by encoding and decoding.

This supports the hypothesis that working memory is manifested by discrete oscillatory dynamics and spiking, not sustained activity. The ability to keep information available in the absence of sensory input is a key component of working memory (WM) and one of the most studied cognitive functions (Fuster and Alexander, 1971Fuster J.M.

It is widely assumed to have a neural correlate in sustained neural activity in higher-order cortical areas, such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Fuster and Alexander, 1971Fuster J.M. Alexander G.E.

The mechanism, at first glance, seems straightforward: a sensory event elicits spiking activity that is maintained until that information is needed. This seemingly continuous delay activity may, however, reflect averaging across trials and/or neurons. Closer examination has suggested that the underlying dynamics are more complex (Rainer and Miller, 2002Rainer G. Miller E.K.

For example, random sampling of neurons indicates that individual neurons bridging a multi-second memory delay is rare. Instead, most neurons show brief bouts of activity with variable onset latency and durations, sprinkled throughout the delay (Cromer et al., 2010Cromer J.A. Roy J.E. Miller E.K.

Continuous, persistent WM information can be simulated by attractor networks, originally serving as models for maintenance of saccade information (Amit and Brunel, 1997Amit D.J. Brunel N.

Synaptic mechanisms and network dynamics underlying spatial working memory in a cortical network model.Cereb. Cortex. 2000; 10: 910-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). In these models, information about saccade location is held in a persistent state without interruption. This state corresponds to a dynamic attractor and is supported by recurrent connections that sustain a pattern of activity. If this activity is disrupted, the information it was conveying is lost. By contrast, a related class of attractor models suggests that WM activity is non-stationary. Information is only expressed as spiking during short-lived attractor states. Between the active states, information is held by selective synaptic changes in the recurrent connections and therefore not lost with disrupted activity (Sandberg et al., 2003Sandberg A. Tegnér J. Lansner A. A working memory model based on fast Hebbian learning.Network. 2003; 14: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, Mongillo et al., 2008Mongillo G. Barak O. Tsodyks M.

Variability of spike firing during θ-coupled replay of memories in a simulated attractor network.Brain Res. 2012; 1434: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The limited lifetime of the attractor states has two advantages. First, less spiking is needed to store the information; energy is conserved during the silent states. Second, as information is not lost when activity is disrupted, attractors can hold multiple items in WM with minimal interference between them (or from sensory distractions). In these models, different items are serially encoded and read out, resulting in brief activations of spiking in the coding assemblies. One of these models (Lundqvist et al., 2011Lundqvist M. Herman P. Lansner A. Theta and gamma power increases and alpha/beta power decreases with memory load in an attractor network model.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2011; 23: 3008-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar; Figure 1A) implemented the functionality of short-lived attractor states using connectivity and synaptic plasticity constrained by known biology. The model predicts that a burst of gamma oscillations accompanies each attractor state (Figures 1B and 1C) and that the lifetime of such bursts should correspond roughly to an alpha/theta cycle. The gamma oscillations result from fast, local feedback inhibition (Figure 1C), which has two chief consequences. First, firing rates are reduced during attractor retrieval. This state is otherwise characterized by runaway excitation but instead excitation and inhibition are dynamically balanced, leading to the low-rate irregular firing observed in biology (Lundqvist et al., 2010Lundqvist M. Compte A. Lansner A. Bistable, irregular firing and population oscillations in a modular attractor memory network.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2010; 6: e1000803Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Second, feedback inhibition normalizes firing rates in a winner-takes-all dynamic, resulting in selective (informative) spiking in only a small subset of neurons (those that are part of the attractor; see Figure 1). This further predicts that there should be a close link between information in spiking and gamma power that goes beyond the broad-band increase in gamma power accompanying general increases in spiking activity. The model also predicts that, as more items are stored in the network, they are replayed more and more often leading to a higher density of gamma bursts (Figure 1B; Lundqvist et al., 2011Lundqvist M. Herman P. Lansner A. Theta and gamma power increases and alpha/beta power decreases with memory load in an attractor network model.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2011; 23: 3008-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This could explain observed load-dependent power changes in gamma (Howard et al., 2003Howard M.W. Rizzuto D.S. Caplan J.B.

Non-stationary memory delay activity also has been suggested by observations that PFC activity and gamma oscillations show slow frequency modulation (Jensen and Tesche, 2002Jensen O. Tesche C.D.

Cross-frequency coupling supports multi-item working memory in the human hippocampus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 3228-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). However, the model makes more specific predictions. On a single trial, there should be no prolonged baseline shift in gamma power following stimulus encoding. Gamma power should instead make sharp transitions into the high-power attractor state and repeatedly fall back to pre-stimulus baseline levels throughout the WM delay (thus manifesting what Stokes, 2015Stokes M.G. ‘Activity-silent’ working memory in prefrontal cortex: a dynamic coding framework.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2015; 19: 394-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, refers to as active-silent states; Figure 1B). As a result, on a trial-by-trial basis, PFC activity is not modulated at slower frequencies in a highly periodic fashion. Instead gamma bursts occur irregularly and the slow periodicity previously observed is instead due to the lifespan of the gamma bursts. The power modulation only appears as periodic when averaging across trials. We sought to test model predictions in local field potential (LFP) and spike data from the PFC of monkeys performing a multi-item memory task. We did so by performing a unique trial-by-trial analysis of neural activity. This avoided the cross-trial averaging that would obscure the complex temporal dynamics predicted by the model. We trained two monkeys to retain multiple colored squares over a short memory delay period (Figure 2A). Each trial began with an encoding phase, where two or three squares appeared in a sequence, each in a unique location. After a memory delay (1.2 or 0.6 s), there was a test phase in which a new sequence of squares appeared in the same locations as during the encoding phase. However, one of the squares in the test sequence had a different color. The monkey had to respond by making a saccade (Figure S1) to the changed square to receive a reward. Performance was 73% correct on two-item trials and 56% correct on three-item trials, comparable to performance previously reported in monkeys (Buschman et al., 2011Buschman T.J. Siegel M. Roy J.E. Miller E.K. Neural substrates of cognitive capacity limitations.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 11252-11255Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Using multiple acute electrodes in lateral PFC (lPFC) and frontal eye field (FEF), we recorded LFPs and spikes from 321 electrodes with isolatable neurons, which were kept for LFP analysis. Of the isolatable units, we analyzed those with at least four spikes per trial (n = 293). The tested model predicts specific roles for gamma and beta oscillations. Encoding or decoding a stimulus triggers a gamma oscillatory attractor state and suppresses a default beta oscillatory state (Figure 1C). This was superficially supported by the average time-frequency evolution for all electrodes (Figure 2B); beta (20–35 Hz) power was suppressed and weak gamma (45–100 Hz) power increases were observed during stimulus presentations. These beta and gamma oscillations were induced (not phase locked to stimuli, Figures S2A and S2B). By contrast, stimulus presentation also evoked lower-frequency (3–10 Hz) activity that was phase locked to stimulus and not present during memory delays (Figures S2A and S2B). Because of its posited role in gating encoding, gamma should only occur where local neuron populations convey stimulus information. Thus, the model predicts that, at sites where the gamma state is not triggered, spiking is not informative. We first tested this by determining whether gamma was present at some recording sites and not others. Indeed, there was a dramatic difference. The majority of sites (195/321, 61%) showed beta oscillations throughout the trial and no significant increase of gamma in response to stimuli (Figure 2C, referred to as non-modulated sites). However, for the other sites (126/321, 39%; 42.2% monkey M1 and 37.5% monkey M2), gamma power significantly increased following stimulus presentations (Figure 2C, referred to as gamma-modulated sites). A comparison revealed that the largest difference between the gamma-modulated and non-modulated sites was between 45 and 100 Hz (Figure S2C), indicating that gamma power changes indeed reflected oscillations and not the spectral consequences of spiking (investigated in more detail below). In addition, modulated sites showed a stronger beta suppression during stimulus presentations and stronger stimulus-locked 3–10 Hz power (Figure S2C). The latter difference was evident in the evoked potentials (Figure S3), suggesting differences in the processing of bottom-up inputs. Next we determined whether firing in gamma-modulated sites selectively conveyed information about the stimulus. First, we analyzed the spiking of all recorded neurons. To quantify information they carried about stimuli, we estimated the percentage explained variance (PEV; Olejnik and Algina, 2003Olejnik S. Algina J. Generalized eta and omega squared statistics: measures of effect size for some common research designs.Psychol. Methods. 2003; 8: 434-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar; see Experimental Procedures), which measured for each cell the proportion of variance in firing rate that could be explained by stimulus identity (color and location, see Experimental Procedures). About one-quarter of the neurons (24.2%, 71 of 293; see Experimental Procedures for criteria) carried information about the location of the square, its color, or both (Figure S4; average PEV based on color and location combined for informative group was 0.063, PEV based on location only was 0.046). Remarkably, all of these informative neurons (71/71) were recorded at the less common gamma-modulated sites (Fisher’s exact test for contingency, p < 10−24). The more common non-modulated sites produced spiking activity that did not convey any significant information about stimuli. To further demonstrate this, we recalculated the spectrograms separately for the recording sites that contained any neuron whose spiking conveyed stimulus information (Figure 2D, Population: informative cells) and those that did not (Figure 2D, Population: no informative cells). This yielded virtually identical results to the spectrograms sorted by the presence or absence of stimulus-induced gamma power. To illustrate this yet further, we plotted the average information from spiking on gamma-modulated versus non-modulated sites (Figure 3A). Neurons from the non-modulated sites had virtually no average stimulus information. They only showed weak information after the test stimulus when the animal made a saccade to the target. By contrast, spiking from gamma-modulated sites showed significant stimulus information starting from sample stimulus onset and continuing throughout the trial (Figure 3A). Thus, induced gamma oscillations and beta-band suppressions at stimulus presentation were strongly co-localized with stimulus information in spiking. This is consistent with the model prediction that stimulus/encoding depends on triggering a gamma attractor state (Figures 1A and 1B) that disrupts the default beta state. If the local neurons do not carry stimulus information, gamma is not triggered and that population stays in the default beta state. This difference between stimulus information from gamma-modulated versus non-modulated sites was not simply due to better quality recordings from the gamma-modulated sites. The average number of isolatable neurons was not higher in the gamma-modulated versus the non-modulated sites (1.41 versus 1.43, p = 0.81). The average spiking rate from gamma-modulated sites was only slightly higher than that of non-modulated sites (8.3 versus 6.5 spikes/s; Figure S5). But, to ensure that the differences were not merely due to increased spiking, we gradually removed the neurons with the highest spike rates from gamma-modulated sites until the mean spike rate was the same on the gamma-modulated and non-modulated sites (removing 10% of the most active units was sufficient; Figure S5). This did not change the average information (PEV across all neurons and the entire trial) for the gamma-modulated sites (0.031 versus 0.031, p = 0.87), and the information in non-modulated sites remained significantly lower (mean PEV = 0.0006) than in gamma-modulated sites. Similarly, taking 80% of the most active neurons from non-modulated sites resulted in equating average spiking rates between the two types of sites (8.3 spikes/s), but the mean PEV nonetheless remained significantly lower on the non-modulated sites (0.0008; not significantly higher than in the original group, p = 0.91). Finally, the gamma-modulated sites were clustered (Figure 3B) in the cortex. As they were sampled with new electrodes each day, the difference between gamma-modulated and non-modulated sites was not due to the electrodes. Instead, there seemed to be an anatomical clustering of WM information where gamma-modulated sites contained a mix of informative and non-informative neurons, while non-modulated sites contained only non-informative neurons (as suggested by the model, compare recording sites 2 and 3 in schematic Figure 1A of the model). The model predicts that, on single trials, beta and gamma power increases should occur in brief, irregular, bursts (Figure 1). Each burst should be narrow band and well defined in frequency, but widely scattered in frequency because it reflects a transient attractor state where the exact frequency is set by the instantaneous level of excitation in the local microcircuit. The average spectrograms in Figure 2 seem to suggest the opposite (broad-band, long-lasting signals), but this was an artifact of averaging across trials. Further, the model predicts that, as WM load increases, the number of coding assemblies taking turn being active will increase, leading to more gamma bursts per trial (and consequently higher trial-averaged gamma power; Figure 1). Below we demonstrate that, as predicted, on individual trials both gamma and beta oscillations occurred in brief bursts that were narrow and variable in frequency, like high-power bubbles against low tonic background activity. Examples from a single trial are shown in Figures 4A (spectrogram) and 4B (raw LFP). To quantify this bubbling, we defined a gamma or beta burst as an increase in power of two SDs above the mean spectral power in that band, lasting at least three cycles (see Experimental Procedures). The gamma bursting predominantly ranged from 45 to 100 Hz. Each burst on average lasted 67 ms (SD 19 ms) and was narrow in frequency (on average power dropped to 50% relative to the power of the central frequency of the burst within 9.5 Hz, SD 2.9 Hz, see Experimental Procedures). Beta bursting occurred predominately in the 20–35 Hz range, each burst on average lasting 130 ms (SD 37 ms) and also narrow in frequency (mean 5.1, SD 1.7 Hz). To investigate the bursts’ relation to trial-averaged power, we calculated burst rate on gamma-modulated sites (Experimental Procedures) by measuring the across-trial density of bursts in each time point (Figure 4C). Both the gamma and beta burst rates were indeed highly correlated with the across-trial power (mean correlation over electrodes: r = 0.93, SE = 0.01 for gamma and r = 0.91, SE = 0.01 for beta; for all correlations p < 10−8; Figure S7). This suggests that the broad-band long-lasting increases in beta and gamma power seen in the average spectrograms were due to gamma and beta bursts of short duration and narrow frequency on a trial-by-trial basis. We confirmed that a bubbling pattern of gamma and beta bursts on single trials gradually turned into smooth continuous broad-band pattern when averaged over an increasing number of trials (Figure S6). To test the prediction that gamma bursting increases with WM load (Figure 1B), we studied trials with three-item presentations focusing on the time of each sequential stimulus presentation and the first 300 ms of each following delay. Each subsequent stimulus presentation (increase in load; Figure 2A) seemed to result in higher gamma burst rates (Figure 4D). This was tested by quantifying the burst rate over a 150-ms window centered on the peak in average burst rate for each stimulus presentation. Pairwise comparisons between all combinations of stimulus load (i.e., 1 versus 2, 2 versus 3, 1 versus 3) demonstrated significantly higher burst rates for higher loads (p < 10−8, Friedman test; pairwise post hoc comparisons with Bonferroni correction at the overall significance α = 0.05; see inset for statistics on each monkey separately). Importantly, as also predicted (Figure 1), this was due to an increased number of bursts (burst count during the presentation and delay combined [600 ms] for each load condition progressively increased, p < 10−12, testing procedure as above) and not due to load-dependent changes in burst length (p > 0.31, Kruskal-Wallis test). The gamma bursting allowed us to study the relationship between gamma bursts and spiking at a single-trial level. The model predicts that gamma, but not beta, bursts should correspond to states with higher spiking rates (Figure 1C). Indeed, spike rates were significantly higher inside than outside gamma bursts (p < 10−12, permutation test on the largest cluster-based statistics; Figure S8A). There was no significant difference between spikes rates inside and outside of beta bursts (Figures S8B and S8C; p = 0.98). The relatively long duration and narrow frequency range of individual bursts quantified above (see also Figure 4A) suggest they are not simply spectral by-products of spiking. Spike-shaped bleeding would have created gamma events with the opposite profile: broad in frequency and even briefer (around 1 ms) (Ray and Maunsell, 2011Ray S. Maunsell J.H. Different origins of gamma rhythm and high-gamma activity in macaque visual cortex.PLoS Biol. 2011; 9: e1000610Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). In addition, the gamma and beta bursts were visible in raw LFPs (Figure 4B). We further tested whether the gamma oscillations corresponded to rhythmic population activity rather than spike-shaped bleeding by looking at spike-gamma burst interactions as above. Early network models (Brunel and Wang, 2003Brunel N. Wang X.J. What determines the frequency of fast network oscillations with irregular neural discharges? I. Synaptic dynamics and excitation-inhibition balance.J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 90: 415-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) with the same pyramidal-interneuron interaction as in the tested model (Figure 1C) suggest that both gamma frequency and spike rates are co-modulated by excitation. We therefore divided gamma into two non-overlapping sub-bands (low: 40–65 Hz versus high: 70–100 Hz). As predicted, the spike rate modulation by gamma bursts was higher in the high gamma than in the low gamma band (p < 10−8, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Thus, higher spike rates are associated with the higher frequency gamma bursts. This would not have been expected if gamma power was due to spike-shaped bleeding, as spike rate then would have had no effect on the spectral component. The model further predicts that, because gamma and beta bursting correspond to different states of the network (stimulus coding versus default states, respectively), they should be anti-correlated. The average spectrogram shown in Figure 2D and the plots of burst rates for gamma-modulated sites (Figure 4C; Figure S7) suggest this. Indeed, most of the gamma-modulated sites (112/126) showed a significant negative correlation between gamma and beta power across the trial (p < 0.05; r = −0.41, SE = 0.04). However, looking into beta (20–25 and 25–35 Hz) and gamma (45–60, 60–75, and 75–90 Hz) power in small 50-ms time bins, we could not find evidence that power in any beta sub-band correlated with power in any gamma sub-band in the same trial and time bin. Thus, there was no apparent instantaneous connection between the two frequencies on a single-trial level. Several studies (Palva et al., 2005Palva J.M. Palva S. Kaila K.

https://openalex.org/W2302217736,"Background Accumulating evidence shows that Helicobacter pylori protects against some metabolic and immunological diseases in which the development of these diseases coincide with temporal or permanent dysbiosis. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of H. pylori eradication on the human gut microbiome. Methods As part of the currently on-going ESSAY (Eradication Study in Stable Adults/Youths) study, we collected stool samples from 17 H. pylori-positive young adult (18–30 years-old) volunteers. The same cohort was followed up 6, 12 and 18 months-post H. pylori eradication. The impact of H. pylori on the human gut microbiome pre- and post-eradication was investigated using high throughput 16S rRNA gene (V3-V4 region) sequencing using the Illumina Miseq followed by data analysis using Qiime pipeline. Results We compared the composition and diversity of bacterial communities in the fecal microbiome of the H. pylori-positive volunteers, before and after H. pylori eradication therapy. The 16S rRNA gene was sequenced at an average of 150,000–170,000 reads/sample. The microbial diversity were similar pre- and post-H. pylori eradication with no significant differences in richness and evenness of bacterial species. Despite that the general profile of the gut microbiome was similar pre- and post-eradication, some changes in the bacterial communities at the phylum and genus levels were notable, particularly the decrease in relative abundance of Bacterioidetes and corresponding increase in Firmicutes after H. pylori eradication. The significant increase of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA)-producing bacteria genera could also be associated with increased risk of metabolic disorders. Conclusions Our preliminary stool metagenomics study shows that eradication of H. pylori caused perturbation of the gut microbiome and may indirectly affect the health of human. Clinicians should be aware of the effect of broad spectrum antibiotics used in H. pylori eradication regimen and be cautious in the clinical management of H. pylori infection, particularly in immunocompromised patients."
https://openalex.org/W2298418920,"Although acupuncture therapy is widely used in traditional Asian medicine for the treatment of diverse internal organ disorders, its underlying biological mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we investigated the functional involvement of acupuncture stimulation (AS) in the regulation of inflammatory responses. TNF-α production in mouse serum, which was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration, was decreased by manual acupuncture (MAC) at the zusanli acupoint (stomach36, ST36). In the spleen, TNF-α mRNA and protein levels were also downregulated by MAC and were recovered by using a splenic neurectomy and a vagotomy. c-Fos, which was induced in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (DMV) by LPS and electroacupuncture (EAC), was further increased by focal administration of the AMPA receptor blocker CNQX and the purinergic receptor antagonist PPADS. TNF-α levels in the spleen were decreased by CNQX and PPADS treatments, implying the involvement of inhibitory neuronal activity in the DVC. In unanesthetized animals, both MAC and EAC generated c-Fos induction in the DVC neurons. However, MAC, but not EAC, was effective in decreasing splenic TNF-α production. These results suggest that the therapeutic effects of acupuncture may be mediated through vagal modulation of inflammatory responses in internal organs."

This coordinated inhibition and excitation of two separate neuronal circuits by a single interneuron suggests a unique advantage in differential detection of visual field uniformity and contrast. Amacrine cells are interneurons in the vertebrate retina that mediate complex synaptic computation in the inner plexiform layer (IPL), where visual signals undergo the final stage of processing before being encoded into spike trains and relayed to the brain along parallel visual channels by retinal ganglion cells (GCs) (Masland, 2012Masland R.H. The tasks of amacrine cells.Vis. Neurosci. 2012; 29: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Composed of over 35 subtypes in the mammalian retina, amacrine cells are generally classified as inhibitory neurons because they release either GABA or glycine as their major neurotransmitter (Masland, 2012Masland R.H. The tasks of amacrine cells.Vis. Neurosci. 2012; 29: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Recently, it was discovered that a special subclass of amacrine cell, which is immunoreactive to vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (vGluT3) (Fremeau et al., 2002Fremeau Jr., R.T. Burman J. Qureshi T.

These glutamatergic amacrine cells (GACs) also have been found to be immunoreactive to glycine and glycine transporter GlyT1, but not vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (vIAAT) (Haverkamp and Wässle, 2004Haverkamp S.

Neurol. 2004; 477: 386-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), raising an intriguing possibility that GACs may release glycine in addition to glutamate (Marshak et al., 2015Marshak D.W. Chuang A.Z. Dolino D.M. Jacoby R.A. Liu W.S. Long Y.E. Sherman M.B. Suh J.M. Vila A. Mills S.L. Synaptic connections of amacrine cells containing vesicular glutamate transporter 3 in baboon retinas.Vis. Neurosci. 2015; 32: E006Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar), even though functional glycine-glutamate co-release has not been reported in the mature nervous system. To test this possibility and gain a functional insight into a potential glycine-glutamate co-transmission system, one needs to determine the following: (1) whether GACs release glycine under physiological conditions, and if they do, (2) whether the release is through a vesicular mechanism, (3) whether GACs release glycine and glutamate onto the same or different postsynaptic targets, and (4) what specific synaptic circuits and functional advantages may be subserved by such inhibitory-excitatory co-transmission. Using a combination of optogenetics, dual patch-clamp recordings, visual stimulation, and two-photon microscopy in a transgenic mouse line, this study provides the first functional evidence for glycine-glutamate co-release by a single neuron in the mature nervous system. It demonstrates that GACs release glycine and glutamate separately onto uniformity detectors (UDs) and OFF alpha ganglion cells (OFF αGCs), and our study reveals a critical role of GACs in shaping the suppressed-by-contrast trigger feature of UDs. The results suggest a functional advantage of glycine-glutamate co-release in differential and coordinated detection of visual field uniformity and contrast. To determine whether GACs co-release glycine and glutamate, we stimulated ChR2-expressing GACs in whole-mount retinae of vGluT3-Cre/ChR2-YFP mice with a flash of intense full-field blue light (henceforth referred to as simply blue light), while patch clamping from various cell types in the ganglion cell layer (GCL). With light-evoked excitatory inputs from bipolar cells and cholinergic amacrine cells blocked by L-AP4 (20 μM), ACET (20 μM), and hexamethonium (HEX, 300 μM) (Lee et al., 2014Lee S. Chen L. Chen M. Ye M. Seal R.P. Zhou Z.J. An unconventional glutamatergic circuit in the retina formed by vGluT3 amacrine cells.Neuron. 2014; 84: 708-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we found that a small population of GCs (<2% of the GCs randomly targeted for recording, Figure 1A) responded to blue light stimulation of GACs with an outward current at 0 mV (cation reversal potential, ECat), but no discernible current at −70 mV (chloride equilibrium potential, ECl; Figure 1C). These GCs (n = 31) all shared a characteristic recurrent bistratified dendritic morphology, with some of their ON dendrites in sublamina-b arising recurrently from OFF dendrites in sublamina-a (Figures 1A and 3E). Before characterizing the physiology of these cells (see below), we tentatively referred to them as recurrent bistratified GCs (rBSGCs). We also found an additional GC type that responded to blue light activation of GACs with a large inward current at −70 mV, but no obvious response at 0 mV (Figures 1B and 1D). This GC type ramified narrowly in sublamina-a, at a level slightly more proximal than OFF starburst dendrites, and had dendritic morphology (Figure 1B) and basic light response properties (Figure S1) resembling those of OFF αGCs (Murphy and Rieke, 2008Murphy G.J. Rieke F. Signals and noise in an inhibitory interneuron diverge to control activity in nearby retinal ganglion cells.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). At 0 mV, the outward response of rBSGCs to blue light stimulation of GACs was not blocked by glutamate receptor antagonists CNQX (25 μM) and CPP (20 μM) (Figures 1E and 1I; n = 11), or by the further application of GABAA antagonist SR95531 (50 μM, n = 5; Figures 1G and 1I), but it was completely blocked by strychnine (1 μM, applied either alone, n = 9 or together with SR95531, n = 10 in the presence of glutamate receptor blockers; Figures 1G and 1I), indicating a direct glycinergic input from GACs rather than an indirect input from intermediate amacrine cells that were driven by glutamate release from GACs. In contrast, blue light-evoked responses of OFF αGCs (at −70 mV) were not blocked by strychnine (1 μM; Figures 1F and 1J), but they were largely blocked by CNQX (Figures 1H and 1J). CPP alone only slightly reduced the current at −35 mV, while CNQX on top of CPP completely blocked the current at both −70 and −35 mV (Figures 1H and 1J), suggesting a glutamatergic input from GACs that was mediated predominantly by non-NMDA receptors. The above results demonstrate that GACs release both glycine and glutamate. Notably, this co-release targeted two separate postsynaptic circuits, with rBSGCs receiving the glycinergic input (peak amplitude at 0 mV: 298 ± 26 pA, mean ± SEM, n = 31) but little or no glutamatergic input (peak amplitude at −70 mV: 2 ± 3 pA, mean ± SEM, n = 31) (Figures 1I and 1K), and OFF αGCs receiving the glutamatergic input (peak amplitude at −70 mV: 259 ± 17 pA, mean ± SEM, n = 37) but little or no glycinergic input (peak amplitude at 0 mV: 11 ± 4 pA, mean ± SEM, n = 37) from GACs (Figures 1J and 1L). Because some GCs in the vGluT3-Cre/ChR2-YFP mouse also express ChR2-YFP (Grimes et al., 2011Grimes W.N. Seal R.P. Oesch N. Edwards R.H. Diamond J.S.

An unconventional glutamatergic circuit in the retina formed by vGluT3 amacrine cells.Neuron. 2014; 84: 708-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we tried to rule out the possibility that the blue light-evoked response in rBSGCs or OFF αGCs was mediated indirectly by the activation of other glycinergic or glutamatergic cell types that were coupled to ChR2-YFP-expressing cells via gap junctions. Prolonged (15–30 min) bath perfusion of 18β-GA (25 μM), which has been shown to block gap junction coupling of GCs in the same preparation (Lee et al., 2014Lee S. Chen L. Chen M. Ye M. Seal R.P.

Schwab D.J. Balasubramanian V. Awatramani G.B. Lag normalization in an electrically coupled neural network.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), did not block the blue light-evoked glycine response in rBSGCs or the glutamate responses in OFF αGCs (Figures 2A and 2B ), arguing against gap junction-mediated, indirect synaptic inputs from non-GAC cells. Moreover, dual patch-clamp recordings from GAC-rBSGC pairs in the whole-mount retina directly detected outward postsynaptic currents in the rBSGC at 0 mV (but no current at −70 mV), when the presynaptic GAC was depolarized by voltage steps from −85 to −30 mV and above (n = 2 pairs; Figures 2C and 2E). Similarly, dual patch-clamp recordings from GAC-OFF αGC pairs detected inward postsynaptic currents at −70 mV (but no current at 0 mV, n = 2 pairs; Figures 2D and 2F). These experiments confirmed that GACs make direct and differential glycinergic and glutamatergic synapses onto rBSGCs and OFF αGCs, respectively. We next tested whether this glycine-glutamate co-transmission is mediated by a Ca2+-dependent mechanism. Application of CdCl2 (0.3 mM) blocked blue light-activated responses in rBSGCs (n = 7) and OFF αGCs (n = 10) (Figures 2G and 2H). Bath perfusion of a nominally Ca2+-free (with no added Ca2+) ACSF also completely and reversibly blocked the responses of both rBSGCs (n = 2; Figure 2I) and OFF αGCs (n = 4; Figure 2J) to GAC activation by blue light. Together, these results demonstrate that both glycine release and glutamate release from GACs were Ca2+ dependent, suggesting a vesicular release mechanism (see Discussion). To determine the physiological identity of the rBSGCs that received a glycinergic input from GACs, we first examined the light response properties of rBSGCs. Under on-cell loose-patch-clamp recording, rBSGCs generated maintained spikes when the whole-mount retina was presented with a uniform dark background. Stimulation with a flash of a center light spot (100 μm in radius) strongly suppressed the spikes at both light onset and offset (Figure 3A, left). The same rBSGCs also generated maintained spikes when presented with a uniform bright background, and these spikes were similarly suppressed by a flash of a center dark spot on the bright background (Figure 3A, right). A moving light bar across a uniform dark background also triggered strong suppression of the maintained background spikes in rBSGCs (Figure 3B). These suppressed-by-contrast receptive field properties closely resembled the trigger feature of UDs that are also known to have a recurrent bistratified dendritic morphology in rabbit and mouse (Amthor et al., 1989Amthor F.R.

Genetically identified suppressed-by-contrast retinal ganglion cells reliably signal self-generated visual stimuli.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 10815-10820Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, GACs selectively make glycinergic synapses onto UDs in the mouse retina. The rBSGCs whose light responses were characterized in our study (n = 41) all showed a transient suppression of spikes in response to a center spot illumination. Following an initial suppression, the spikes typically recovered within 2 s (Figure 3). The recovery was faster at light ON than OFF and sometimes showed a transient increase (overshoot) in spike frequency as the spikes returned during the ON recovery (Figures 3B and 3C). Increasing the duration of spot illumination did not change the transient nature of suppression (Figure 3C). However, there were considerable variations in the rate of maintained background spikes, the duration of spike suppression at light onset and offset, and the spike rate during the post-suppression recovery phase among the rBSGCs examined, as exemplified in Figure 3D. This temporal variability may be attributable to subtle differences in recording conditions and/or to an intrinsic cell-to-cell variability, but the existence of different functional subtypes of UDs also remains a possibility. We found at least two morphological varieties/subtypes among our recorded UDs. The majority (36 of 41) of the recorded UDs had a relatively smaller soma size (15- to 17-μm diameter) than that of ON-OFF direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs, 18- to 20-μm diameter) and five to ten recurrent dendrites diving from sublamina-a into sublamina-b (Figure 3E, top), while a minority of the recorded UDs (5 of 41) had a soma size (21- to 23-μm diameter) slightly larger than that of ON-OFF DSGCs and only one to three recurrent dendrites (Figure 3E, bottom). Both morphological varieties/subtypes shared the basic transient suppressed-by-contrast receptive field properties and received a strong glycinergic input from GACs, with the bigger soma UDs receiving larger currents at 0 mV (417 ± 80 pA, mean ± SEM, n = 5) than the smaller soma UDs (267 ± 25 pA, mean ± SEM, n = 22) (p = 0.024). Because of the low frequency in encountering the larger soma UDs, our results are based mainly on the smaller soma UDs. Notably, we also encountered an ON-sustained, bistratified GC type (n = 2), which had an annular recurrent dendritic morphology similar to that of the ON bistratified cell in rabbit (Hoshi et al., 2013Hoshi H. Tian L.M. Massey S.C. Mills S.L. Properties of the ON bistratified ganglion cell in the rabbit retina.J. Comp. Neurol. 2013; 521: 1497-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar); but, this cell did not respond to blue light activation of GACs (data not shown). To understand the functional contribution of GACs to the suppressed-by-contrast trigger feature of UDs, we examined the spatial and pharmacological properties of the UD receptive field using concentric light annuli of various radii (13–600 μm; Figures 4A and 4B ). Under voltage clamp at −70 mV, UDs responded to the onset (ON) of a small center light annulus (50 μm in radius, 50 μm in thickness) with a small inward excitatory current, which consisted of an initial fast transient component and a gradually developing sustained component (Figure 4A). The spatial profile of this excitatory input had a receptive field center size of 100–150 μm in radius, which roughly matched the dendritic field size of a UD (Figure 4B), indicating direct excitatory input from bipolar cells. At the offset of this small center light annulus, however, the response typically appeared as a small outward current at −70 mV, suggesting a presynaptic suppression of the baseline glutamatergic input from bipolar cells. In contrast to the weak light-evoked excitatory input at −70 mV, the outward inhibitory current response (at 0 mV) to the 50-μm-radius light annulus was prominent at both light ON and OFF, with the response being larger at ON than at OFF (Figure 4A). As the light annulus increased in radius, the inhibitory response quickly declined, displaying a spatial extent of 150–200 μm in radius, roughly corresponding to the dendritic radius of a UD (70–100 μm) plus the dendritic diameter of a GAC (70–100 μm; Figure 4B). The spatial profile of the inhibitory input also displayed a shoulder that extended up to 400 μm in radius, but this medium-wide field inhibition was much smaller in current amplitude than the narrow/central inhibitory input (Figure 4B). Thus, the center receptive field of a UD was dominated by a transient ON-OFF inhibitory input, which was consistent with both the small spatial extent of the GAC arbor and the ON-OFF light response properties of GACs (Figures S2A and S2B; also see Lee et al., 2014Lee S.

Soto F. Kerschensteiner D. An excitatory amacrine cell detects object motion and provides feature-selective input to ganglion cells in the mouse retina.eLife. 2015; 4: e08025Google Scholar), implicating GACs as the main source of this inhibition. At the light onset, the large inhibitory input, which overshadowed the small ON excitatory input, was likely responsible for the transient ON suppression of the background spikes in UDs. At the light offset, the postsynaptic inhibition, though smaller than that at light onset, was combined with a presynaptic suppression of the background excitatory input to produce a strong and relatively longer lasting (compared to that at light onset) suppression of the spikes, as seen in Figure 3. Pharmacological experiments further demonstrated that the center inhibitory input was largely mediated by a strychnine-sensitive current, with a small additional component that was SR-95531 sensitive (Figures 4C and 4D), consistent with GACs providing a main inhibitory drive for the suppressed-by-contrast mechanism (Figures 1 and 2). Indeed, strychnine effectively diminished the suppressive effect of a center light stimulation on maintained spikes of UDs under on-cell loose-patch recording (n = 4; Figure 4E), confirming a key role of the glycinergic inhibition in the UD mechanism (Sivyer et al., 2010Sivyer B.

An amacrine cell circuit for signaling steady illumination in the retina.Cell Rep. 2015; 13: 2663-2670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To demonstrate further that the glycinergic input from GACs alone was strong enough to produce a functional suppression of the maintained spikes in UDs, we tried to mimic the center light-triggered suppression of UD spikes (Figure 4F, top left) by optogenetic activation of GACs in a cocktail of drugs (LAP-4, ACET, HEX, and CNQX) that blocked light-evoked input to UDs. In this cocktail, UDs no longer generated spontaneous spikes, but they could be reliably induced to generate maintained spikes by a small step of current injection under current clamp (Figure 4F, top right). As expected, a center light stimulus had no effect on the induced spikes in the cocktail (data not shown), but blue light activation of GACs caused a strong hyperpolarization in the UD and a transient block of the spikes (Figure 4F, bottom left), reminiscent of the suppression by the onset of a center light spot under the control condition (Figure 4F, top left). This blue light effect could be blocked by strychnine (Figure 4F, bottom right). Because the blue light-evoked depolarization of GACs was within the physiological range of GAC responses to center light illumination (see Figure S4 in Lee et al., 2014Lee S. Chen L. Chen M. Ye M. Seal R.P. Zhou Z.J. An unconventional glutamatergic circuit in the retina formed by vGluT3 amacrine cells.Neuron. 2014; 84: 708-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the above results confirmed that the glycinergic transmission from GACs to UDs played a critical role in the suppressed-by-contrast mechanism. Notably, however, because GACs were strongly suppressed by their inhibitory surround, their glycinergic output to UDs was diminished under large-field stimulation, resulting in a weaker suppression of spikes by large spots (Figure S2). The residual suppression by large-field stimulation is likely mediated by additional feedback and feedforward inhibition from other amacrine cells (see Figure S2 legend for detail). This spatial regulation of spike suppression by multiple mechanisms may allow UDs to encode not only the disruption of uniformity by contrast but also the spatial characteristics of the disruption. This study has established that GACs release both glutamate and glycine, thus revealing a new combination of excitatory-inhibitory co-transmission in the adult nervous system. Both glycine and glutamate are released in a Ca2+-dependent manner, indicating an underlying vesicular release mechanism, even though vIAAT was previously not immunolocalized to GACs (Haverkamp and Wässle, 2004Haverkamp S. Wässle H. Characterization of an amacrine cell type of the mammalian retina immunoreactive for vesicular glutamate transporter 3.J. Comp.

Vesicular glutamate transporter 3 expression identifies glutamatergic amacrine cells in the rodent retina.J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 477: 386-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the two co-released transmitters target separate postsynaptic GC circuits, suggesting most parsimoniously that glycine and glutamate are released from two separate populations of vesicles at different synapses, as also supported by a recent electron microscopy (EM) study that found both symmetric and asymmetric synapses on GAC processes in the primate retina (Marshak et al., 2015Marshak D.W.

In most known examples of co-transmission, the two co-transmitters target the same postsynaptic cells, where the outcome of co-transmission is determined by the relative strength and the dynamic integration of the two transmitter signals (Hnasko and Edwards, 2012Hnasko T.S.

The present study demonstrates that GACs make segregated glycine and glutamate synapses onto GCs in two functionally opposing visual channels (one channel that is sensitive to visual field uniformity but suppressed by contrast and motion, and the other that is sensitive to contrast and motion but suppressed by uniformity) (Figure 4G), suggesting that this mode of co-transmission may allow differential but coordinated signaling from one neuron to multiple downstream circuits. The glycinergic output of GACs is highly selective in targeting postsynaptic GCs, with UDs being the only type so far found from our randomly recorded GC sample (though it is possible that additional rare types of GCs also may receive a glycinergic input from GACs). The glycinergic input from GACs is much larger than other synaptic inputs to UDs and plays a critical role in shaping the UD receptive field properties. Our results indicate that other amacrine cells, including GABAergic amacrine cells, also contribute to the suppressed-by-contrast mechanism (Jacoby et al., 2015Jacoby J. Zhu Y. DeVries S.H.

On the other hand, GCs that receive a glutamatergic input from GACs now include at least four identified types (OFF αGC, ON and ON-OFF direction selective, and a subpopulation of W3; Figure 4G; Krishnaswamy et al., 2015Krishnaswamy A.

These four GC types all belong to nonlinear GCs that are known to extract local intensity variations within their receptive field, such as contrast change, image motion, and edge (Chiao and Masland, 2003Chiao C.C.

An excitatory amacrine cell detects object motion and provides feature-selective input to ganglion cells in the mouse retina.eLife. 2015; 4: e08025Google Scholar). On the other hand, compared to the glutamate input from bipolar cells, which is already contrast sensitive, the glutamate input from GACs to OFF αGCs is relatively small (Figures 1 and S1) and likely plays a secondary (modulatory) role in shaping the postsynaptic receptive field; but, the detailed mechanism remains to be elucidated. Notably, the glycine response of UDs to blue light activation of GACs has a large transient component followed by a large sustained component, whereas the glutamate response of OFF αGCs is predominantly transient with only a small sustained component (Figure 1). This difference in kinetics may be attributable to multiple pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms. Of particular interest is the possibility of differential presynaptic regulation at glycine and glutamate release sites on GAC dendrites, for example, through differential activation of certain voltage-gated channels and/or local dendritic integration of synaptic inputs. Such a possibility, which is still under investigation, may further enhance the computational capability of glycine-glutamate co-release by GACs. Taken together, our study discovered a new form of fast excitatory-inhibitory co-transmission in the nervous system and shed important light on the mechanism, circuitry, and functional advantage of this special mode of neurotransmission.

Three pipette solutions were used as follows (in mM): (1) for voltage clamp, 105 CsMeSO4, 0.5 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 5 EGTA, 5 Na2-phosphocreatine, 2 ATP-Mg, 0.5 GTP-2Na, 2 ascorbic acid, and 8 QX314-Cl (pH 7.2), with 20–30 CsOH; (2) for current clamp, 105 potassium gluconate, 5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 5 Na2-phosphocreatine, 2 ATP-2Na, 0.5 GTP-2Na, and 2 ascorbic acid (pH 7.2) with 5 NaOH and 15 KOH; and (3) for loose-patch clamp, ACSF. Drugs were applied by bath perfusion at the same concentrations as first described in the text. Liquid junction potentials were calculated and corrected. Spike rates were computed by convolving raster plot with normalized step function with a 0.1 s duration. Statistical results were expressed as mean ± SEM. rBSGCs and OFF aGCs were targeted for recording based on their soma size (15–23 μm and 22–25 μm in diameter, respectively) under dim white light illumination (105 photons μm2s1 at retina) and confirmed by their light response properties and dendritic morphology revealed at the end of recording. GACs were identified under brief (2–10 s each time, two to five times in total) epifluorescence illumination (1010 photons μm2s1 at retina, 465 ± 15 nm in wavelength) and recorded under white light illumination (105 photons μm2s1 at retina). Visual stimuli were generated on a black and white LCD (model SGA4LCD, CRL Opto Ltd., Dunfirmline, Scotland, contrast 100:1; maximum image intensity at retina, ∼2 × 105 photons μm2s1 with an intensity-weighted mean wavelength of 573 nm) and projected to the retina via the microscope condenser lens. Stable light responses were obtained from UDs, OFF aGCs, and GACs after 1–5 min of dark adaptation following the establishment of a patch clamp configuration. ChR2 was activated by intense blue light from either a high power LED (lpeak, 470 nm) focused on the retina through the condenser lens of a Zeiss upright microscope (Axioskop FS, Peabody, MA) or the epifluorescence light source (100 W Hg bulb, band-pass filtered at 465 ± 15 nm, focused on the retina through the 60, NA/0.9 water immersion objective lens of an Olympus BX51WI microscope, Olympus USA) controlled by a Uniblitz shutter (Vincent Associates). The intensity of the blue light measured at the retina was 22 nW μm2 (5.5 × 1010 photons μm2s1) and 8 nW μm2 (2 × 1010 photons μm2s1) for the blue LED and the Hg bulb, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2297935727,"Prebiotics are non-digestible carbohydrate dietary supplements that selectively stimulate the growth of one or more beneficial bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract of the host. These bacteria can inhibit colonization of pathogenic bacteria by producing antimicrobial substances such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and competing for niches with pathogens within the gut. Pasture flock chickens are generally raised outdoors with fresh grass, sunlight and air, which represents different environmental growth conditions compared to conventionally raised chickens. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the difference in microbial populations from naked neck chicken ceca fed with commercial prebiotics derived from brewer’s yeast cell wall via an Illumina MiSeq platform. A total of 147 day-of-hatch naked neck chickens were distributed into 3 groups consisted of 1) C: control (no prebiotic), 2) T1: Biolex® MB40 with 0.2%, and 3) T2: Leiber® ExCel with 0.2%, consistently supplemented prebiotics during the experimental period. At 8 weeks, a total of 15 birds from each group were randomly selected and ceca removed for DNA extraction. The Illumina Miseq platform based on V4 region of 16S rRNA gene was applied for microbiome analysis. Both treatments exhibited limited impact on the microbial populations at the phylum level, with no significant differences in the OTU number of Bacteroidetes among groups and an increase of Proteobacteria OTUs for the T1 (Biolex® MB40) group. In addition there was a significant increase of genus Faecalibacterium OTU, phylum Firmicutes. According to the development of next generation sequencing (NGS), microbiome analysis based on 16S rRNA gene proved to be informative on the prebiotic impact on poultry gut microbiota in pasture-raised naked neck birds."
https://openalex.org/W2324963200,"Stripe rust (or yellow rust), which is caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most devastating wheat diseases worldwide. The wheat cultivar Xingzi 9104 (XZ) is an elite wheat germplasm that possesses adult plant resistance (APR), which is non-race-specific and durable. Thus, to better understand the mechanism underlying APR, we performed transcriptome sequencing of wheat seedlings and adult plants without Pst infection, and a total of 157,689 unigenes were obtained as a reference. In total, 2,666, 783 and 2,587 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found to be up- or down-regulated after Pst infection at 24, 48 and 120 hours post-inoculation (hpi), respectively, based on a comparison of Pst- and mock-infected plants. Among these unigenes, the temporal pattern of the up-regulated unigenes exhibited transient expression patterns during Pst infection, as determined through a Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. In addition, a Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that many biological processes, including phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, reactive oxygen species, photosynthesis and thiamine metabolism, which mainly control the mechanisms of lignification, reactive oxygen species and sugar, respectively, are involved in APR. In particular, the continuous accumulation of reactive oxygen species may potentially contribute to the ability of the adult plant to inhibit fungal growth and development. To validate the bioinformatics results, 6 candidate genes were selected for further functional identification using the virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) system, and 4 candidate genes likely contribute to plant resistance against Pst infection. Our study provides new information concerning the transcriptional changes that occur during the Pst-wheat interaction at the adult stage and will help further our understanding of the detailed mechanisms underlying APR to Pst."
https://openalex.org/W2297716012,"Background Currently in Ethiopia, young people’s sexual and reproductive health services are limited and there is a growing issue of confidentiality and affordability of these health services. Moreover, the available services provided are not sensitive to the special needs of young people. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess young people’s sexual and reproductive health service utilization and its associated factors in Awabel district, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods A community based cross-sectional study was conducted among 781 randomly selected young people using a pre-tested structured questionnaires in Awabel district, Northwest Ethiopia. Data were entered into Epi data version 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 16.0 software. Results The mean age of respondents were 17.80 (+ 2.65) years. About 41% of young people had utilized sexual and reproductive health services. Young people from families of higher family expenditure, lived with mothers, participated in peer education and lived near to a Health Center were more likely to utilize sexual and reproductive health services. Furthermore, those who had a parental discussion on sexual and reproductive health (AOR (95% C.I): 2.23 (1.43, 3.46)) and ever had sexual intercourse (AOR (95% C.I): 1.88 (1.30, 2.71)) were more likely to utilize the service than their counterparts. On the other hand, those young people lived with their father and had a primary level of educational attainment was less likely to utilize the service. Conclusion Utilization of sexual and reproductive health services is low which needs a great attention where; if not intervened, young people might engage in risky sexual activities. Therefore, it needs a concerted effort from all the concerned bodies to improve their service utilization and thereby reduce the burden of young people’s disease and disabilities associated with sexual and reproductive health."

Mapping PRR resistance genes can provide linked DNA markers for breeding PRR resistant varieties by molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS). Two BC1 populations and an F2 population derived from a cross between P. capsici-resistant accession, Criollo de Morelos 334 (CM334) and P. capsici-susceptible accession, New Mexico Capsicum Accession 10399 (NMCA10399) were used to investigate the genetic characteristics of PRR resistance. PRR resistance to isolate Byl4 (race 3) was controlled by a single dominant gene, PhR10, that was mapped to an interval of 16.39Mb at the end of the long arm of chromosome 10. Integration of bulked segregant analysis (BSA) and Specific Length Amplified Fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) provided an efficient genetic mapping strategy. Ten polymorphic Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers were found within this region and used to screen the genotypes of 636 BC1 plants, delimiting PhR10 to a 2.57 Mb interval between markers P52-11-21 (1.5 cM away) and P52-11-41 (1.1 cM). A total of 163 genes were annotated within this region and 31 were predicted to be associated with disease resistance. PhR10 is a novel race specific gene for PRR, and this paper describes linked SSR markers suitable for marker-assisted selection of PRR resistant varieties, also laying a foundation for cloning the resistance gene."
https://openalex.org/W2308758579,"HIV-1 favors integration into active genes and gene-enriched regions of host cell chromosomes, thus maximizing the probability of provirus expression immediately after integration. This requires cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 6 (CPSF6), a cellular protein involved in pre-mRNA 3′ end processing that binds HIV-1 capsid and connects HIV-1 preintegration complexes to intranuclear trafficking pathways that link integration to transcriptionally active chromatin. CPSF6 together with CPSF5 and CPSF7 are known subunits of the cleavage factor I (CFIm) 3′ end processing complex; however, CPSF6 could participate in additional protein complexes. The molecular mechanisms underpinning the role of CPSF6 in HIV-1 infection remain to be defined. Here, we show that a majority of cellular CPSF6 is incorporated into the CFIm complex. HIV-1 capsid recruits CFIm in a CPSF6-dependent manner, which suggests that the CFIm complex mediates the known effects of CPSF6 in HIV-1 infection. To dissect the roles of CPSF6 and other CFIm complex subunits in HIV-1 infection, we analyzed virologic and integration site targeting properties of a CPSF6 variant with mutations that prevent its incorporation into CFIm. We show, somewhat surprisingly, that CPSF6 incorporation into CFIm is not required for its ability to direct preferential HIV-1 integration into genes. The CPSF5 and CPSF7 subunits appear to have only a minor, if any, role in this process even though they appear to facilitate CPSF6 binding to capsid. Thus, CPSF6 alone controls the key molecular interactions that specify HIV-1 preintegration complex trafficking to active chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W2299755110,"Background Climate change poses a major public health threat. A survey of U.S. local health department directors in 2008 found widespread recognition of the threat, but limited adaptive capacity, due to perceived lack of expertise and other resources. Methods We assessed changes between 2008 and 2012 in local public health departments' preparedness for the public health threats of climate change, in light of increasing national polarization on the issue, and widespread funding cutbacks for public health. A geographically representative online survey of directors of local public health departments was conducted in 2011–2012 (N = 174; response rate = 50%), and compared to the 2008 telephone survey results (N = 133; response rate = 61%). Results Significant polarization had occurred: more respondents in 2012 were certain that the threat of local climate change impacts does/does not exist, and fewer were unsure. Roughly 10% said it is not a threat, compared to 1% in 2008. Adaptation capacity decreased in several areas: perceived departmental expertise in climate change risk assessment; departmental prioritization of adaptation; and the number of adaptation-related programs and services departments provided. In 2008, directors' perceptions of local impacts predicted the number of adaptation-related programs and services their departments offered, but in 2012, funding predicted programming and directors' impact perceptions did not. This suggests that budgets were constraining directors' ability to respond to local climate change-related health threats. Results also suggest that departmental expertise may mitigate funding constraints. Strategies for overcoming these obstacles to local public health departments' preparations for climate change are discussed."

Here, we derived a porcine pluripotent stem cell (pPSC) line from day 5.5 blastocysts in a newly developed culture system based on MXV medium and a 5% oxygen atmosphere. The pPSCs had been passaged more than 75 times over two years, and the morphology of the colony was similar to that of human embryonic stem cells. Characterization and assessment showed that the pPSCs were alkaline phosphatase (AKP) positive, possessed normal karyotypes and expressed classic pluripotent markers, including OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG. In vitro differentiation through embryonic body formation and in vivo differentiation via teratoma formation in nude mice demonstrated that the pPSCs could differentiate into cells of the three germ layers. The pPSCs transfected with fuw-DsRed (pPSC-FDs) could be passaged with a stable expression of both DsRed and pluripotent markers. Notably, when pPSC-FDs were used as donor cells for somatic nuclear transfer, 11.52% of the reconstructed embryos developed into blastocysts, which was not significantly different from that of the reconstructed embryos derived from porcine embryonic fibroblasts. When pPSC-FDs were injected into day 4.5 blastocysts, they became involved in the in vitro embryonic development and contributed to the viscera of foetuses at day 50 of pregnancy as well as the developed placenta after the chimeric blastocysts were transferred into recipients. These findings indicated that the pPSCs were porcine pluripotent cells; that this would be a useful cell line for porcine genetic engineering and a valuable cell line for clarifying the molecular mechanism of pluripotency regulation in pigs."

Nutrient management guidelines aimed at reducing harmful forms of N loss such as nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and nitrate (NO3(-)) leaching have been tailored for many cropping systems. The developing bioenergy industry is likely to make use of novel cropping systems, such as polycultures of perennial species, for which we have limited nutrient management experience. We studied how a switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) monoculture, a 5-species native grass mixture and an 18-species restored prairie responded to annual fertilizer applications of 56 kg N ha(-1) in a field-scale agronomic trial in south-central Wisconsin over a 2-year period. We observed greater fertilizer-induced N2O emissions and sub-rooting zone NO3(-) concentrations in the switchgrass monoculture than in either polyculture. Fertilization increased aboveground net primary productivity in the polycultures, but not in the switchgrass monoculture. Switchgrass was generally more productive, while the two polycultures did not differ from each other in productivity or N loss. Our results highlight differences between polycultures and a switchgrass monoculture in responding to N fertilization."

The 107 invasive S. aureus isolates, collected between February 2012 and August 2014, were analysed retrospectively. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, spa typing and DNA microarray analysis were performed to determine clonal distribution, diversity and gene content in regard to patients characteristics. In total, 107 isolates were recovered from 88 patients with clinical symptoms of invasive bacterial infection. The final set of 92 non-duplicate samples included 38 MRSA isolates. Additionally, a set of 54 S. aureus isolates collected during epidemiological screening was genotyped and analysed. There were 72 healthcare-associated (HCA) and 20 community-onset (CO) infection events caused by 33 and 5 MRSA isolates, respectively. The majority of isolates were affiliated with the major European clonal complexes CC5 (t003, spa-CC 002), CC45 (spa-CC 015), CC7 or CC15 (t084, t091, spa-CC 084). Two epidemic clones (CC5-MRSA-II or CC45-MRSA-IV) dominated among MRSA isolates, while MSSA population contained 15 different CCs. The epidemiological screening isolates belonged to similar genetic lineages as those collected from invasive infection cases. The HCA infection events, spa types t003, t2642 or CC5 were significantly associated with infections occurring in neonates and children under 5 years of age. Moreover, carriage of several genetic markers, including erm(A), sea (N315), egc-cluster, chp was significantly higher in isolates obtained from children in this age group. The spa types t091 and t008 were underrepresented among patients aged 5 years or younger, whereas spa type t008, CC8 and presence of splE was associated with infection in children aged 10 years or older. The HCA-MRSA strains were most frequently found in children under 5 years, although the majority of invasive infections was associated with MSSA strains. Moreover, an association between age group of children from the study population and a specific strain genotype (spa type, clonal complex or genetic content) was observed among the patients."
https://openalex.org/W2298752342,"Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most prevalent symptomatic primary immunodeficiency in adults. CVID patients often present changes in the frequency and function of B lymphocytes, reduced number of Treg cells, chronic immune activation, recurrent infections, high incidence of autoimmunity and increased risk for malignancies. We hypothesized that the frequency of B10 cells would be diminished in CVID patients because these cells play an important role in the development of Treg cells and in the control of T cell activation and autoimmunity. Therefore, we evaluated the frequency of B10 cells in CVID patients and correlated it with different clinical and immunological characteristics of this disease. Forty-two CVID patients and 17 healthy controls were recruited for this study. Cryopreserved PBMCs were used for analysis of T cell activation, frequency of Treg cells and characterization of B10 cells by flow cytometry. IL-10 production by sorted B cells culture and plasma sCD14 were determined by ELISA. We found that CVID patients presented decreased frequency of IL-10-producing CD24hiCD38hi B cells in different cell culture conditions and decreased frequency of IL-10-producing CD24hiCD27+ B cells stimulated with CpG+PIB. Moreover, we found that CVID patients presented lower secretion of IL-10 by sorting-purified B cells when compared to healthy controls. The frequency of B10 cells had no correlation with autoimmunity, immune activation and Treg cells in CVID patients. This work suggests that CVID patients have a compromised regulatory B cell compartment which is not correlated with clinical and immunological characteristics presented by these individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2304299091,"Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic Th2 and food antigen-mediated disease characterized by esophageal eosinophilic infiltration. Thymic stromal lymphopoetin (TSLP), an epithelial derived cytokine which bridges innate and Th2-type adaptive immune responses in other allergic conditions, is overexpressed in esophageal biopsies of EoE subjects. However, the triggers of TSLP expression in the esophageal epithelium are unknown. The objective of the current study was to characterize TSLP expression in human esophageal epithelium in EoE in vivo and to determine the role of food antigens upon epithelial TSLP expression in vitro. Using immunohistochemistry (IHC), we localized TSLP in esophageal biopsies of active EoE (≥15 eos/hpf), inactive EoE (<15 eos/hpf) and non-EoE control subjects, and found that TSLP expression was restricted to the differentiated suprabasal layer of the epithelium in actively inflamed EoE biopsies. Consistent with these results in vivo, inducible TSLP protein secretion was higher in CaCl2 differentiated telomerase-immortalized esophageal epithelial cells (EPC2-hTERT) compared to undifferentiated cells of the basal phenotype, following stimulation with the TLR3 ligand poly(I:C). To determine whether food antigens could directly induce epithelial TSLP secretion, differentiated and undifferentiated primary esophageal epithelial cells from EoE and non-EoE subjects were challenged with food antigens clinically relevant to EoE: Chicken egg ovalbumin (OVA), wheat, and milk proteins beta-lactoglobulin (blg) and beta-casein. Food antigens failed to induce TSLP secretion by undifferentiated cells; in contrast, only OVA induced TSLP secretion in differentiated epithelial cells from both EoE and control cell lines, an effect abolished by budesonide and NF-κb inhibition. Together, our study shows that specific food antigens can trigger innate immune mediated esophageal TSLP secretion, suggesting that esophageal epithelial cells at the barrier surface may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of EoE by regulating TSLP expression."
https://openalex.org/W2335266547,"Germline loss- and gain-of-function mutations of G-protein α-11 (Gα11), which couples the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) to intracellular calcium (Ca(2+) i) signaling, lead to familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 2 (FHH2) and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 2 (ADH2), respectively, whereas somatic Gα11 mutations mediate uveal melanoma development by constitutively up-regulating MAPK signaling. Cinacalcet and NPS-2143 are allosteric CaSR activators and inactivators, respectively, that ameliorate signaling disturbances associated with CaSR mutations, but their potential to modulate abnormalities of the downstream Gα11 protein is unknown. This study investigated whether cinacalcet and NPS-2143 may rectify Ca(2+) i alterations associated with FHH2- and ADH2-causing Gα11 mutations, and evaluated the influence of germline gain-of-function Gα11 mutations on MAPK signaling by measuring ERK phosphorylation, and assessed the effect of NPS-2143 on a uveal melanoma Gα11 mutant. WT and mutant Gα11 proteins causing FHH2, ADH2 or uveal melanoma were transfected in CaSR-expressing HEK293 cells, and Ca(2+) i and ERK phosphorylation responses measured by flow-cytometry and Alphascreen immunoassay following exposure to extracellular Ca(2+) (Ca(2+) o) and allosteric modulators. Cinacalcet and NPS-2143 rectified the Ca(2+) i responses of FHH2- and ADH2-associated Gα11 loss- and gain-of-function mutations, respectively. ADH2-causing Gα11 mutations were demonstrated not to be constitutively activating and induced ERK phosphorylation following Ca(2+) o stimulation only. The increased ERK phosphorylation associated with ADH2 and uveal melanoma mutants was rectified by NPS-2143.

Seeking amino acid residues with unique roles at the protein-protein interaction interface (PPI) of FGF14·Nav1.6, we engineered model-guided mutations of FGF14 and validated their impact on the FGF14·Nav1.6 complex and the FGF14:FGF14 dimer formation using a luciferase assay. Divergence was found in the β-9 sheet of FGF14 where an alanine (Ala) mutation of Val-160 impaired binding to Nav1.6 but had no effect on FGF14:FGF14 dimer formation.

https://openalex.org/W2297354159,"Consolidated memories return to a labile state after the presentation of cues (reminders) associated with acquisition, followed by a period of stabilization (reconsolidation). However not all cues are equally effective in initiating the process, unpredictable cues triggered it, predictable cues do not. We hypothesize that the different effects observed by the different reminder types on memory labilization-reconsolidation depend on a differential neural involvement during reminder presentation. To test it, we developed a declarative task and compared the efficacy of three reminder types in triggering the process in humans (Experiment 1). Finally, we compared the brain activation patterns between the different conditions using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (Experiment 2). We confirmed that the unpredictable reminder is the most effective in initiating the labilization-reconsolidation process. Furthermore, only under this condition there was differential left hippocampal activation during its presentation. We suggest that the left hippocampus is detecting the incongruence between actual and past events and allows the memory to be updated."

Using a prototrophic strain derived from the standard auxotrophic laboratory strain BY4742, we showed that supplementation of non-essential amino acids to a synthetic defined (SD) medium increases maximal cell growth and extends the chronological lifespan. The positive effects of amino acids can be reproduced by modulating the medium pH, indicating that amino acids contribute to chronological longevity in a cell-extrinsic manner by alleviating medium acidification. In addition, we showed that the amino acid-mediated effects on extension of chronological longevity are independent of those achieved through a reduction in the TORC1 pathway, which is mediated in a cell-intrinsic manner. Since previous studies showed that extracellular acidification causes mitochondrial dysfunction and leads to cell death, our results provide a path to premature chronological aging caused by differences in available nitrogen sources. Moreover, acidification of culture medium is generally associated with culture duration and cell density; thus, further studies are required on cell physiology of auxotrophic yeast strains during the stationary phase because an insufficient supply of essential amino acids may cause alterations in environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2302989504,"Introduction Hyperglycaemia in pregnancy (HIP), i.e. gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and diabetes in pregnancy (DIP), increases the risk of various short- and long-term adverse outcomes. However, much remains to be understood about the role of different risk factors in development of HIP. Objective The aims of this observational study were to examine the role of potential risk factors for HIP, and to investigate whether any single or accumulated risk factor(s) could be used to predict HIP among women attending GDM screening at three centres in urban, semi-urban and rural Tamil Nadu, India. Methodology Pregnant women underwent a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test. Data on potential risk factors was collected and analysed using logistical regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were calculated for significant risk factors and a risk factor scoring variable was constructed. Results HIP was prevalent in 18.9% of the study population (16.3% GDM; 2.6% DIP). Increasing age and BMI as well as having a mother only or both parents with diabetes were significant independent risk factors for HIP. Among women attending the rural health centre a doubling of income corresponded to an 80% increased risk of HIP (OR 1.80, 95%CI 1.10–2.93; p = 0.019), whereas it was not significantly associated with HIP among women attending the other health centres. The performance of the individual risk factors and the constructed scoring variable differed substantially between the three health centres, but none of them were good enough to discriminate between those with and without HIP. Conclusions The findings highlight the importance of socio-economic circumstances and intergenerational risk transmission in the occurrence of HIP as well as the need for universal screening."
https://openalex.org/W2413299070,"The response to UV irradiation is important for a cell to maintain its genetic integrity when challenged by environmental genotoxins. An immediate early response to UV irradiation is the rapid induction of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) expression. Although emerging evidence has linked ATF3 to stress pathways regulated by the tumor suppressor p53 and the histone acetyltransferase Tip60, the role of ATF3 in the UV response remains largely unclear. Here, we report that ATF3 mediated dichotomous UV responses. Although UV irradiation enhanced the binding of ATF3 to Tip60, knockdown of ATF3 expression decreased Tip60 stability, thereby impairing Tip60 induction by UV irradiation. In line with the role of Tip60 in mediating UV-induced apoptosis, ATF3 promoted the death of p53-defective cells in response to UV irradiation. However, ATF3 could also activate p53 and promote p53-mediated DNA repair, mainly through altering histone modifications that could facilitate recruitment of DNA repair proteins (such as DDB2) to damaged DNA sites. As a result, ATF3 rather protected the p53 wild-type cells from UV-induced apoptosis. Our results thus indicate that ATF3 regulates cell fates upon UV irradiation in a p53-dependent manner.

The DNA damage response is essential for the maintenance of genetic integrity in the face of intrinsic and environmental genotoxins.

Laiho M. Cellular UV damage responses: functions of tumor suppressor p53.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1755: 71-89PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian cells mobilize a mechanism referred to as nucleotide excision repair (NER) whereby a repair complex composed of up to 30 proteins is assembled at damaged sites, unwind, and excise DNA adducts from damaged strands (1.Latonen L. Laiho M. Cellular UV damage responses: functions of tumor suppressor p53.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1755: 71-89PubMed Google Scholar). UV-induced DNA damage also provokes cellular signaling mediated by the sensor kinase ATM and Rad3-related (ATR)/ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) and, notably, the tumor suppressor p53, leading to rapid induction of cell cycle arrest to allow repair of damaged DNA or apoptosis for the removal of irreparable cells (1.Latonen L. Laiho M. Cellular UV damage responses: functions of tumor suppressor p53.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1755: 71-89PubMed Google Scholar). Intriguingly, although p53 induced by UV irradiation transactivates genes that can drive cell cycle arrest (e.g. p21) or apoptosis (e.g. Bax), it can also directly engage in NER by inducing the expression of genes (i.e. DDB2 and XPC) responsible for sensing and binding DNA adducts to prime the repair of cross-linked DNA (2.Hwang B.J.

Milner J. p53 is a chromatin accessibility factor for nucleotide excision repair of DNA damage.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 975-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), thereby promoting UV damage repair independent of its transcriptional activity (6.Sengupta S.

Contrary to the general view that p53 is proapoptotic, p53 is often prosurvival in the UV response. Indeed, it has been shown that p53 protect cells from UV-induced apoptosis (7.McKay B.C.

The MYST histone acetyltransferase Tip60, or KAT5, is another important regulator of the cellular UV response. Although it can acetylate both histones and non-histone proteins to regulate gene expression, Tip60 is best known for its roles in regulating the cellular response to DNA double strand breaks (10.Squatrito M. Gorrini C. Amati B. Tip60 in DNA damage response and growth control: many tricks in one HAT.Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 433-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Tip60 not only senses double strand breaks but promotes damage repair through altering chromatin structure, increasing the deoxynucleoside triphosphate pool (11.Niida H. Katsuno Y. Sengoku M. Shimada M. Yukawa M. Ikura M. Ikura T. Kohno K. Shima H. Suzuki H. Tashiro S. Nakanishi M.

Jiang X. Chen S. Fernandes N. Price B.D. A role for the Tip60 histone acetyltransferase in the acetylation and activation of ATM.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13182-13187Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Tip60 can also selectively promote the expression of proapoptotic genes (e.g. PUMA) by acetylating p53 at lysine 120 in response to genotoxic stresses, including UV irradiation (13.Tang Y. Luo J. Zhang W. Gu W. Tip60-dependent acetylation of p53 modulates the decision between cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis.Mol.

It thus comes as no surprise that Tip60 was shown to be indispensable for UV-induced apoptosis (9.Kranz D. Dohmesen C. Dobbelstein M. BRCA1 and Tip60 determine the cellular response to ultraviolet irradiation through distinct pathways.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 197-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 15.Tyteca S.

Tip60 and p400 are both required for UV-induced apoptosis but play antagonistic roles in cell cycle progression.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1680-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, recent evidence indicates that Tip60-mediated apoptosis upon UV irradiation does not require p53 but, rather, is involved in prosurvival signaling mediated by JNK (9.Kranz D. Dohmesen C. Dobbelstein M. BRCA1 and Tip60 determine the cellular response to ultraviolet irradiation through distinct pathways.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 197-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Notably, although Tip60 stability was shown to be controlled by the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 (16.Legube G. Linares L.K. Lemercier C. Scheffner M. Khochbin S. Trouche D. Tip60 is targeted to proteasome-mediated degradation by Mdm2 and accumulates after UV irradiation.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1704-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), how Tip60 is regulated during the UV response is poorly understood. Previously, we reported that activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is a major Tip60 regulator that can bind Tip60 and promote Tip60-mediated activation of ATM signaling upon IR (17.Cui H. Guo M. Xu D. Ding Z.-C. Zhou G. Ding H.-F. Zhang J. Tang Y. Yan C. The stress-responsive gene ATF3 regulates the histone acetyltransferase Tip60.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6752Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). ATF3 achieves this function partly through stabilizing Tip60 as a consequence of promoting its deubiquitination mediated by the deubiquitinase USP7 (17.Cui H. Guo M. Xu D. Ding Z.-C. Zhou G. Ding H.-F. Zhang J. Tang Y. Yan C. The stress-responsive gene ATF3 regulates the histone acetyltransferase Tip60.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6752Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). ATF3 is a member of the ATF/cAMP response element-binding protein transcription factor family and can regulate gene expression through binding the consensus ATF/cAMP response element-binding protein cis-regulatory element via its basic region leucine zipper domain (18.Yan C. Boyd D.D. ATF3 regulates the stability of p53: a link to cancer.Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 926-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). ATF3 can also regulate cellular functions independent of its transcriptional activity. ATF3, for instance, can directly interact with key cancer-associated proteins (e.g. p53, E6, androgen receptor, and p63) and alter their interactions with DNA or other proteins (19.Stelzl U. Worm U.

Loss of ATF3 promotes Akt activation and prostate cancer development in a Pten knockout mouse model.Oncogene. 2015; 34: 4975-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the exact biological function of ATF3 remains largely unknown and sometimes controversial (25.Hai T. Wolford C.C. Chang Y.-S. ATF3, a hub of the cellular adaptive-response network, in the pathogenesis of diseases: is modulation of inflammation a unifying component?.Gene Expr. 2010; 15: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Because ATF3 can be rapidly induced by a wide range of cellular stresses, including DNA damage (26.Hai T. Hartman M.G. The molecular biology and nomenclature of the activating transcription factor/cAMP responsive element binding family of transcription factors: activating transcription factor proteins and homeostasis.Gene. 2001; 273: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), it is often assumed that ATF3 is required for a cell to maintain homeostasis upon cellular stresses (18.Yan C. Boyd D.D. ATF3 regulates the stability of p53: a link to cancer.Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 926-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Indeed, our findings that ATF3 can activate p53 by blocking MDM2-mediated ubiquitination while regulating Tip60 and ATM activation (17.Cui H. Guo M. Xu D. Ding Z.-C. Zhou G. Ding H.-F. Zhang J. Tang Y. Yan C. The stress-responsive gene ATF3 regulates the histone acetyltransferase Tip60.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6752Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 27.Yan C. Lu D. Hai T. Boyd D.D. Activating transcription factor 3, a stress sensor, activates p53 by blocking its ubiquitination.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) argue for the notion that ATF3 contributes to the maintenance of genetic stability in the face of genotoxic challenges. Because ATF3 is one of the few genes immediately induced by UV irradiation in various cell types (28.Amundson S.A. Bittner M. Chen Y. Trent J. Meltzer P. Fornace A.J. Fluorescent cDNA microarray hybridization reveals complexity and heterogeneity of cellular genotoxic stress responses.Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3666-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 29.Abe T.

Com. 2003; 310: 1168-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), ATF3 might also regulate the cellular response to UV-induced DNA damage. However, although ATF3 was shown to mediate UV-mediated cell death through transactivating Hif-2α expression (30.Turchi L. Aberdam E. Mazure N. Pouysségur J. Deckert M. Kitajima S. Aberdam D. Virolle T. Hif-2α mediates UV-induced apoptosis through a novel ATF3-dependent death pathway.Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 1472-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), an early study also suggests that ATF3 induces p15PAF expression required for eliminating UV-induced DNA adducts and thus protect cells from UV-induced damage (31.Turchi L. Fareh M. Aberdam E. Kitajima S. Simpson F. Wicking C. Aberdam D. Virolle T. ATF3 and p15PAF are novel gatekeepers of genomic integrity upon UV stress.Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 728-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This apparent paradox warrants further investigations into the precise role ATF3 plays in the UV response. Here we provide evidence demonstrating that ATF3 mediated the dichotomous cellular response to UV irradiation. Although ATF3 was found to regulate Tip60 and promote UV-induced death of p53-defective cells, this stress-responsive gene could rather protect p53 wild-type cells from UV-induced apoptosis by promoting p53-mediated DNA repair. ATF3 thus determined cell fates upon UV irradiation in a p53-dependent manner. HCT116, U2OS, DU145, and PC3 cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium (HCT116 cells), DMEM (U2OS and DU145 cells), and RPMI 1640 medium (PC3 cells) supplemented with 10% FBS, respectively, and routinely maintained in our laboratory. HCT116-F-Tip60 cells were genetically modified from HCT116 cells to express the endogenous Tip60 protein fused with a 3× FLAG tag (32.Du Z. Song J. Wang Y. Zhao Y. Guda K. Yang S. Kao H.-Y. Xu Y.

Signal. 2010; 3: ra80Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). This modification allowed us to detect endogenous Tip60 using the well characterized FLAG antibody. To generate ATF3 knockout (ATF3−/−) cells, HCT116 cells were infected with adeno-associated viruses carrying a vector targeting exon 2 of the ATF3 gene. After removal of the targeting vector, a 22-bp deletion was generated within the exon. 4H. Cui, X. Li, C. Han, Q. E. Wang, H. Wang, H. F. Ding, J. Zhang, and C. Yan, unpublished data. The pSIH-H1 shRNA cloning and lentivector expression system (System Biosciences) was used to knock down ATF3 and p53 expression in HCT116 and U2OS cells as descried previously (20.Wang H. Mo P.

The targeted sequences for ATF3 and p53 were 5′-GCAAAGTGCCGAAACAAGA-3′ and 5′-GACTCCAGTGGTAATCTAC-3′, respectively. The Tip60 siRNA was synthesized on the basis of an earlier publication (13.Tang Y.

To knock down ATF3 expression in PC3 and DU145 cells, a single guided RNA (sgRNA) (5′-AAAATGATGCTTCAACACCC-3′) targeting a region immediately downstream of the ATF3 start codon was co-expressed with hCas9. Clones with sgRNA-guided ATF3 knockdown were isolated as described previously (24.Wang Z. Xu D. Ding H.-F. Kim J. Zhang J. Hai T. Yan C.

For Western blotting, cells irradiated with UV light were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, and proteinase inhibitor mixtures. Cytosolic, nucleoplasmic, and chromatin-bound proteins were separated from UV-treated cells following a protocol described recently (33.Wang Q.-E. Han C. Zhao R. Wani G. Zhu Q. Gong L. Battu A.

Bound proteins were eluted and detected by Western blotting. For the co-immunoprecipitation assay, cell lysates (1–2 mg) were incubated with 25 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. After extensive washes, precipitated proteins were detected by Western blotting. The antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (ATF3 (sc-188) and p53 DO-1 (sc-126)), Cell Signaling Technology (PARP (9542) and cleaved caspase 3 (9661)), Abcam (DDB2 (ab51017)), and Sigma (FLAG (F3165) and β-actin (A5441)), respectively.

The cellular CPD level was measured using the OxiSelect UV-induced DNA damage ELISA kit (Cell Biolabs, STA-322) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Briefly, genomic DNA was prepared using lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K) at 50 °C overnight, followed by phenol extraction (1:1) and ethanol precipitation. The DNA dissolved in Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer was then treated with 0.2 mg/ml RNase A at 37 °C for 2 h and purified by phenol extraction. 500 ng of DNA was then denatured and absorbed into the wells of a DNA high-binding plate for ELISA using an anti-CPD antibody. To ensure that equal amounts of DNA were used for ELISA, 50 ng of DNA was also subjected to real-time PCR using the primers 5′-CGCGAGGAGGAGCAACTG-3′ and 5′-AGGAGCTCACATCCCCATTG-3′, which amplified a 63-bp region in the human genome (chr9:80911735–80912222, hg19). This was carried out as described previously (33.Wang Q.-E. Han C. Zhao R. Wani G. Zhu Q. Gong L. Battu A. Racoma I. Sharma N.

Essentially, cells cultured on coverslips were washed with PBS, UV-irradiated at 40 J/m2 through a polycarbonate filter containing 5-μm pores (Millipore), and then double-stained with a mouse anti-DDB2 (1:50) (ab51017, Abcam) and a rabbit anti-CPD antibody. Fluorescence images were obtained with a Nikon E80i fluorescence microscope and processed with SPOT software (Diagnostic Instruments). Transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. pCMV-Luc was constructed by inserting a CMV promoter into pGL3 (35.Yan C. Boyd D.D. Histone H3 acetylation and H3 K4 methylation define distinct chromatin regions permissive for transgene expression.Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 6357-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and irradiated with 500 J/m2 of UV light before transfections. Cells in 24-well plates were co-transfected with 100 ng of UV-damaged or intact pCMV-Luc and 5 ng of pRL-CMV. 48 h later, cells were lysed for Dual-Luciferase activity assays (Promega). We previously reported that ATF3 can stabilize Tip60 and activate ATM in response to IR (17.Cui H. Guo M. Xu D. Ding Z.-C. Zhou G. Ding H.-F. Zhang J. Tang Y. Yan C. The stress-responsive gene ATF3 regulates the histone acetyltransferase Tip60.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6752Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Given that ATF3 can be rapidly induced by UV irradiation (28.Amundson S.A. Bittner M. Chen Y. Trent J. Meltzer P. Fornace A.J. Fluorescent cDNA microarray hybridization reveals complexity and heterogeneity of cellular genotoxic stress responses.Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3666-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 29.Abe T.

Com. 2003; 310: 1168-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether ATF3 also regulates Tip60 in the UV response. We thus knocked down ATF3 expression by shRNA or sgRNA in three genetically diversified cancer cell lines (U2OS, PC3, and genetically modified HCT116 cells), treated the cells with UV light (20 J/m2), and measured the Tip60 expression level by Western blotting. UV irradiation elevated the Tip60 protein level at early time points (4 and 8 h), but the Tip60 expression level was decreased to the basal level 24 h after UV irradiation (Fig. 1, A–C). Importantly, not only the basal Tip60 level but also the UV-induced increase in Tip60 expression was decreased in all three cell lines when ATF3 expression was knocked down (Fig. 1, A–C). We also measured the Tip60 mRNA level by qRT-PCR. Although UV irradiation rather repressed Tip60 transcription at 4 and 8 h after irradiation, ATF3 knockdown did not alter Tip60 transcription in both quiescent and UV-treated cells (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that UV irradiation likely triggered an ATF3-dependent mechanism that could increase Tip60 protein stability as an early response to UV irradiation. Indeed, we found that Tip60 stability was decreased in UV irradiation-treated ATF3 knockdown cells, as measured by cycloheximide chase experiments (Fig. 1E). These results indicate that ATF3 can stabilize Tip60 in response to UV radiation. Interestingly, although it has been shown that ATF3 can stabilize Tip60 by binding the latter protein and promoting its deubiquitination (17.Cui H. Guo M. Xu D. Ding Z.-C. Zhou G. Ding H.-F. Zhang J. Tang Y. Yan C. The stress-responsive gene ATF3 regulates the histone acetyltransferase Tip60.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6752Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we found that UV irradiation could enhance the ATF3-Tip60 interaction. Thus, when cell lysates containing similar amounts of Tip60 were incubated with immobilized GST-ATF3, the amount of Tip60 pulled down by GST-ATF3 from UV-treated samples was much more than that from quiescent cells (Fig. 1F, lane 6 versus lane 5). This effect was also apparent 8 h after UV irradiation but appeared to be diminished 24 h after irradiation (Fig. 1F). Co-immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that more ATF3 bound by Tip60 in UV-irradiated cells (Fig. 1G, lane 2 versus lane 1). However, i"
https://openalex.org/W2296877601,"Nitrogen mineralization is a key biogeochemical process transforming organic nitrogen to inorganic nitrogen in estuarine and coastal sediments. Although sedimentary nitrogen mineralization is an important internal driver for aquatic eutrophication, few studies have investigated sedimentary nitrogen mineralization in these environments. Sediment-slurry incubation experiments combined with 15N isotope dilution technique were conducted to quantify the potential rates of nitrogen mineralization in surface sediments of the Yangtze Estuary. The gross nitrogen mineralization (GNM) rates ranged from 0.02 to 5.13 mg N kg-1 d-1 in surface sediments of the study area. The GNM rates were generally higher in summer than in winter, and the relative high rates were detected mainly at sites near the north branch and frontal edge of this estuary. The spatial and temporal distributions of GNM rates were observed to depend largely on temperature, salinity, sedimentary organic carbon and nitrogen contents, and extracellular enzyme (urease and L-glutaminase) activities. The total mineralized nitrogen in the sediments of the Yangtze Estuary was estimated to be about 6.17 × 105 t N yr-1, and approximately 37% of it was retained in the estuary. Assuming the retained mineralized nitrogen is totally released from the sediments into the water column, which contributed 12–15% of total dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) sources in this study area. This result indicated that the mineralization process is a significant internal nitrogen source for the overlying water of the Yangtze Estuary, and thus may contribute to the estuarine and coastal eutrophication."
https://openalex.org/W2301480322,"Food-based approaches such as biofortification are meant to sustainably address micronutrient deficiencies in poor settings. Knowing more about micronutrient intakes and deficiencies is a prerequisite to designing and evaluating interventions.The objectives of the study were to assess biological status and dietary intakes of iron, zinc and vitamin A among women and children aged 36-59 months in rural Burkina Faso and to study relationships between intake and status to better inform future food-based interventions.A cross-sectional survey was carried out in two rural provinces of Burkina Faso on a random cluster sample of 480 mother-child pairs. Dietary data was obtained by 24-hour recalls repeated on a random sub-selection of 37.5% of subjects to allow calculation of nutrient's probability of adequacy (PA). Biomarkers were measured on a sub-sample of 180 mother-child pairs. Blood samples were analyzed for hemoglobin, serum ferritin, soluble transferrin receptors (sTfR), C-reactive protein, alpha-1-glycoprotein, serum zinc concentration (SZnC) and retinol. For each micronutrient the relationship between biomarker and dietary intake was investigated by multiple linear regression models accounting for inflammatory biomarkers.Mean PA for iron, zinc and vitamin A was 0.49, 0.87 and 0.21 among women and 0.61, 0.95 and 0.33 among children, respectively. Prevalence of anemia, corrected low serum ferritin and high sTfR was 37.6%, 4.0% and 77.5% among women and 72.1%, 1.5% and 87.6% among children, respectively. Prevalence of low SZnC and corrected low serum retinol was 39.4% and 12.0% among women and 63.7% and 24.8% among children, respectively. There was a tendency for a positive relationship between vitamin A intakes and serum retinol among women (β = 0.0003, P = 0.06). Otherwise, no link was found between micronutrients biomarkers and intakes.Our study depicted different images of micronutrient deficiencies when based on dietary intakes or biomarkers results, thus highlighting the need for more suitable biomarkers and more precise measures of absorbable micronutrient intakes at the individual level. It thus points to challenges in the design and evaluation of future biofortification or other food-based interventions in rural areas of Burkina Faso."
https://openalex.org/W2301136303,"There is evidence that greater neighbourhood walkability (i.e., neighbourhoods with more amenities and well-connected streets) is associated with higher levels of total walking in Europe and in Asia, but it remains unclear if this association holds in the Canadian context and in chronic disease populations. We examined the relationships of different walkability measures to biosensor-assessed total walking (i.e., steps/day) in adults with type 2 diabetes living in Montreal (QC, Canada).Participants (60.5±10.4 years; 48.1% women) were recruited through McGill University-affiliated clinics (June 2006 to May 2008). Steps/day were assessed once per season for one year with pedometers. Neighbourhood walkability was evaluated through participant reports, in-field audits, Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-derived measures, and the Walk Score®. Relationships between walkability and daily steps were estimated using Bayesian longitudinal hierarchical linear regression models (n = 131).Participants who reported living in the most compared to the least walkable neighbourhoods completed 1345 more steps/day (95% Credible Interval: 718, 1976; Quartiles 4 versus 1). Those living in the most compared to the least walkable neighbourhoods (based on GIS-derived walkability) completed 606 more steps per day (95% CrI: 8, 1203). No statistically significant associations with steps were observed for audit-assessed walkability or the Walk Score®.Adults with type 2 diabetes who perceived their neighbourhoods as more walkable accumulated more daily steps. This suggests that knowledge of local neighborhood features that enhance walking is a meaningful predictor of higher levels of walking and an important component of neighbourhood walkability."

It has been suggested that this relationship is extended to subjects without renal dysfunction, but further explorations in diverse races and regions are still needed. We performed a cross-sectional study of 2,509 Korean subjects (Far Eastern Asian) with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of ≥60 ml/min/1.73m2 and who underwent coronary computerized tomography. Serum P concentration was divided into pre-determined 4 categories: ≤3.2, 3.2< to ≤3.6, 3.6< to ≤4.0 and >4.0 mg/dL. Agatston score (AS), an index of CAC, was divided into 3 categories: 0, 0< to ≤100, and >100. A multinomial logit model (baseline outcome: AS = 0) was applied to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for each serum P category (reference: ≤3.2mg/dL). Mean age of subjects was 53.5±9.1 years and 36.9% were female. In the adjusted model, serum P concentration of 3.6< to ≤4.0 mg/dL and >4.0 mg/dL showed high ORs for AS of >100 [OR: 1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04–2.40 and OR: 2.11, 95% CI: 1.34–3.32, respectively]. A unit (mg/dL) increase in serum P concentration was associated with 50% increase in risk of AS >100 (OR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.16–1.94). A higher serum P concentration, even within a normal range, may be associated with a higher CAC in subjects with normal renal function."

Twelve patients with advanced head and neck cancer were injected with BoNT into the submandibular glands prior to primary radiochemotherapy. Six patients received BoNT/A and 6 patients BoNT/A and B, half of each subgroup into their left and the other half into their right gland. As an internal control, sodium chloride was injected into the respective contralateral gland (placebo). For the evaluation of the salivary gland function, technetium pertechnetate salivary gland scintigraphy was performed before and after the end of radiotherapy. BoNT/A and B were well tolerated. Analysis of the scintigraphic data revealed no statistically significant difference between BoNT and placebo regarding the scintigraphic uptake difference (pBoNT/A = 0.84 and pBoNT/A-B = 0.56 for BoNT/A vs. placebo and BoNT/A-B vs. placebo, respectively). We also found no significant difference in treatment between BoNT and placebo in terms of salivary excretion fraction (pBoNT/A = 0.44; pBoNT/A-B = 0.44). This study demonstrates that BoNT can be safely combined with radiochemotherapy. Dosing and timing of BoNT injection should be further investigated for efficacy analysis.

It also binds MuSK and perlecan/dystroglycan, 2 signaling platforms of the postsynaptic domain. Mutations in ColQ cause a congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) with AChE deficiency. Because the absence of AChE does not fully explain the complexity of the syndrome and there is no curative treatment for the disease, we explored additional potential targets of ColQ by conducting a large genetic screening of ColQ-deficient mice, a model for CMS with AChE deficiency, and analyzed their NMJ and muscle phenotypes. We demonstrated that ColQ controls the development and the maturation of the postsynaptic domain by regulating synaptic gene expression. Notably, ColQ deficiency leads to an up-regulation of the 5 subunits of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR), leading to mixed mature and immature AChRs at the NMJ of adult mice. ColQ also regulates the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) components. However, whereas the ECM mRNAs were down-regulated in vitro, compensation seemed to occur in vivo to maintain normal levels of these mRNAs. Finally, ColQ deficiency leads to a general atrophic phenotype and hypoplasia that affect fast muscles. This study points to new specific hallmarks for this CMS.—Sigoillot, S.

https://openalex.org/W2302163325,"The penultimate enzyme in the histidine biosynthetic pathway catalyzes dephosphorylation of l-histidinol 1-phosphate (HOLP) into l-histidinol. The recently discovered in Arabidopsis thaliana plant-type histidinol phosphate phosphatase (HPP) shares no homology with the two other HPP superfamilies known previously in prokaryotes and resembles myo-inositol monophosphatases (IMPases). In this work, identification of an HPP enzyme from a model legume, Medicago truncatula (MtHPP) was based on the highest sequence identity to A. thaliana enzyme. Biochemical assays confirmed that MtHPP was able to cleave inorganic phosphate from HOLP but not from d-myo-inositol-1-phosphate, the main substrate of IMPases. Dimers of MtHPP, determined by size exclusion chromatography, in the presence of CO2 or formaldehyde form mutual, methylene-bridged cross-links between Lys(158) and Cys(245) residues. Four high resolution crystal structures, namely complexes with HOLP (substrate), l-histidinol (product), and PO4 (3-) (by-product) as well as the structure showing the cross-linking between two MtHPP molecules, provide detailed structural information on the enzyme. Based on the crystal structures, the enzymatic reaction mechanism of IMPases is accustomed to fit the data for MtHPP. The enzymatic reaction, which requires Mg(2+) cations, is catalyzed mainly by amino acid residues from the N-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain, sharing little identity with IMPases, is responsible for the substrate specificity (i.e. allows the enzyme to distinguish between HOLP and d-myo-inositol-1-phosphate). Structural features, mainly the presence of a conserved Asp(246), allow MtHPP to bind HOLP specifically."
https://openalex.org/W2304722280,"The aim of this paper is to estimate the cumulative effect of childhood household dysfunction (CHD) on alcohol related illness and death later in life and to test the interaction between CHD and socioeconomic background. The study utilised Swedish national registers including data of a Swedish national cohort born 1973–82 (n = 872 912), which was followed from age 18 to 29–40 years. Cox regression analyses were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) for alcohol related illness or death in young adulthood. The CHD measure consisted of seven indicators: parental alcohol/drug misuse, mental health problems, criminality, death, divorce, social assistance, and child welfare interventions. Childhood socioeconomic position (SEP) was indicated by parental occupational status. Outcomes were alcohol related inpatient hospital care, specialised outpatient care or deaths. Using the highest socioeconomic group without CHD experience as a reference, those in the same socioeconomic group with one indicator of CHD had HRs of 2.1 [95% CI: 1.7–2.5], two CHD indicators 5.6 [4.4–7.1], three or more indicators 9.4 [7.1–12.4] for retrieving inpatient care. Socioeconomic disadvantage further increased the risks–those with low socioeconomic background and three CHD indicators or more had a HR of 12.5 [10.9–14.3]. Testing for interaction suggests that the combined HRs deviates from additivity [Synergy index: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.4–1.9]. The results for outpatient care were similar, but not as pronounced. In conclusion, this Swedish national cohort study shows that childhood household dysfunction is strongly and cumulatively associated to alcohol related illness later in life and that it interacts with socioeconomic disadvantage."
https://openalex.org/W2307226737,"Shale has been considered as good gas reservoir due to its abundant interior nanoscale pores. Thus, the study of the pore structure of shale is of great significance for the evaluation and development of shale oil and gas. To date, the most widely used approaches for studying the shale pore structure include image analysis, radiation and fluid invasion methods. The detailed pore structures can be studied intuitively by image analysis and radiation methods, but the results obtained are quite sensitive to sample preparation, equipment performance and experimental operation. In contrast, the fluid invasion method can be used to obtain information on pore size distribution and pore structure, but the relative simple parameters derived cannot be used to evaluate the pore structure of shale comprehensively and quantitatively. To characterize the nanoscale pore structure of shale reservoir more effectively and expand the current research techniques, we proposed a new method based on gas adsorption experimental data and the method of moments to describe the pore structure parameters of shale reservoir. Combined with the geological mixture empirical distribution and the method of moments estimation principle, the new method calculates the characteristic parameters of shale, including the mean pore size (mean), standard deviation (σ), skewness (Sk) and variation coefficient (c). These values are found by reconstructing the grouping intervals of observation values and optimizing algorithms for eigenvalues. This approach assures a more effective description of the characteristics of nanoscale pore structures. Finally, the new method has been applied to analyze the Yanchang shale in the Ordos Basin (China) and Longmaxi shale from the Sichuan Basin (China). The results obtained well reveal the pore characteristics of shale, indicating the feasibility of this new method in the study of the pore structure of shale reservoir."
https://openalex.org/W2311159376,"Whether using two languages enhances executive functions is a matter of debate. Here, we take a novel perspective to examine the bilingual advantage hypothesis by comparing bi-dialect with mono-dialect speakers’ performance on a non-linguistic task that requires executive control. Two groups of native Chinese speakers, one speaking only the standard Chinese Mandarin and the other also speaking the Southern-Min dialect, which differs from the standard Chinese Mandarin primarily in phonology, performed a classic Flanker task. Behavioural results showed no difference between the two groups, but event-related potentials recorded simultaneously revealed a number of differences, including an earlier P2 effect in the bi-dialect as compared to the mono-dialect group, suggesting that the two groups engage different underlying neural processes. Despite differences in the early ERP component, no between-group differences in the magnitude of the Flanker effects, which is an index of conflict resolution, were observed in the N2 component. Therefore, these findings suggest that speaking two dialects of one language does not enhance executive functions. Implications of the current findings for the bilingual advantage hypothesis are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2297112056,"Twitter is an extremely high volume platform for user generated contributions regarding any topic. The wealth of content created at real-time in massive quantities calls for automated approaches to identify the topics of the contributions. Such topics can be utilized in numerous ways, such as public opinion mining, marketing, entertainment, and disaster management. Towards this end, approaches to relate single or partial posts to knowledge base items have been proposed. However, in microblogging systems like Twitter, topics emerge from the culmination of a large number of contributions. Therefore, identifying topics based on collections of posts, where individual posts contribute to some aspect of the greater topic is necessary. Models, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), propose algorithms for relating collections of posts to sets of keywords that represent underlying topics. In these approaches, figuring out what the specific topic(s) the keyword sets represent remains as a separate task. Another issue in topic detection is the scope, which is often limited to specific domain, such as health. This work proposes an approach for identifying domain-independent specific topics related to sets of posts. In this approach, individual posts are processed and then aggregated to identify key tokens, which are then mapped to specific topics. Wikipedia article titles are selected to represent topics, since they are up to date, user-generated, sophisticated articles that span topics of human interest. This paper describes the proposed approach, a prototype implementation, and a case study based on data gathered during the heavily contributed periods corresponding to the four US election debates in 2012.

https://openalex.org/W2304951188,"Human calumenin (hCALU) is a six EF-hand protein belonging to the CREC family. As other members of the family, it is localized in the secretory pathway and regulates the activity of SERCA2a and of the ryanodine receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We have studied the effects of Ca2+ binding to the protein and found it to attain a more compact structure upon ion binding. Circular Dichroism (CD) measurements suggest a major rearrangement of the protein secondary structure, which reversibly switches from disordered at low Ca2+ concentrations to predominantly alpha-helical when Ca2+ is added. SAXS experiments confirm the transition from an unfolded to a compact structure, which matches the structural prediction of a trilobal fold. Overall our experiments suggest that calumenin is a Ca2+ sensor, which folds into a compact structure, capable of interacting with its molecular partners, when Ca2+ concentration within the ER reaches the millimolar range."

Although low parental education has been identified as a factor in depression in college students, the mechanisms through which parental educational achievement affects students’ depression are not well understood. We tested whether adverse family and college environments mediate the relationship between parental educational level and depression among Chinese college students. Methods A total of 5180 respondents were selected using a cross-sectional survey. We examined the association of parental education, adverse family and college environments with depression in college students using the Adolescent Self-Rating Life Events Checklist, Beck Depression Inventory and socio-demographic questionnaires. Results Lower parental educational level is significantly correlated with depression in college students in our sample. Additionally, low family economic status, paternal or maternal unemployment, long periods spent apart from family, family conflicts, having been scolded and beaten by parents, poor or dissatisfying test performance, conflict with friends, heavy course load and failure in selection processes are also associated with parental education. Low family economic status, paternal or maternal unemployment, long periods spent apart from family, family conflicts, poor or dissatisfying test performance, conflict with friends and heavy course load mediated the relationship between parental education and depression in college students. Conclusions Adverse family and college environments could explain the influence of parental educational level on depression in college students."

The purpose of this study was to identify gene expression profiles downstream of IGF1R and its two adaptor proteins. IRS-null breast cancer cells (T47D-YA) were engineered to express IRS-1 or IRS-2 alone and their ability to mediate IGF ligand-induced proliferation, motility, and gene expression determined. Global gene expression signatures reflecting IRS adaptor specific and primary vs. secondary ligand response were derived (Early IRS-1, Late IRS-1, Early IRS-2 and Late IRS-2) and functional pathway analysis examined. IRS isoforms mediated distinct gene expression profiles, functional pathways, and breast cancer subtype association. For example, IRS-1/2-induced TGFb2 expression and blockade of TGFb2 abrogated IGF-induced cell migration. In addition, the prognostic value of IRS proteins was significant in the luminal B breast tumor subtype. Univariate and multivariate analyses confirmed that IRS adaptor signatures correlated with poor outcome as measured by recurrence-free and overall survival. Thus, IRS adaptor protein expression is required for IGF ligand responses in breast cancer cells. IRS-specific gene signatures represent accurate surrogates of IGF activity and could predict response to anti-IGF therapy in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2299784588,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) have been intensively studied as drug targets to treat type 2 diabetes, lipid disorders, and metabolic syndrome. This study is part of our ongoing efforts to map conformational changes in PPARs in solution by a combination of chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry (MS). To our best knowledge, we performed the first studies addressing solution structures of full-length PPAR-β/δ. We monitored the conformations of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) as well as full-length PPAR-β/δ upon binding of two agonists. (Photo-) cross-linking relied on (i) a variety of externally introduced amine- and carboxyl-reactive linkers and (ii) the incorporation of the photo-reactive amino acid p-benzoylphenylalanine (Bpa) into PPAR-β/δ by genetic engineering. The distances derived from cross-linking experiments allowed us to monitor conformational changes in PPAR-β/δ upon ligand binding. The cross-linking/MS approach proved highly advantageous to study nuclear receptors, such as PPARs, and revealed the interplay between DBD (DNA-binding domain) and LDB in PPAR-β/δ. Our results indicate the stabilization of a specific conformation through ligand binding in PPAR-β/δ LBD as well as full-length PPAR-β/δ. Moreover, our results suggest a close distance between the N- and C-terminal regions of full-length PPAR-β/δ in the presence of GW1516. Chemical cross-linking/MS allowed us gaining detailed insights into conformational changes that are induced in PPARs when activating ligands are present. Thus, cross-linking/MS should be added to the arsenal of structural methods available for studying nuclear receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2301083257,"The aim of this study was to investigate augmented pain processing in the cortical somatosensory system in patients with fibromyalgia (FM). Cortical evoked responses were recorded in FM (n = 19) and healthy subjects (n = 21) using magnetoencephalography after noxious intra-epidermal electrical stimulation (IES) of the hand dorsum (pain rating 6 on a numeric rating scale, perceptually-equivalent). In addition, healthy subjects were stimulated using the amplitude corresponding to the average stimulus intensity rated 6 in patients with FM (intensity-equivalent). Quantitative sensory testing was performed on the hand dorsum or thenar muscle (neutral site) and over the trapezius muscle (tender point), using IES (thresholds, ratings, temporal summation of pain, stimulus-response curve) and mechanical stimuli (threshold, ratings). Increased amplitude of cortical responses was found in patients with FM as compared to healthy subjects. These included the contralateral primary (S1) and bilateral secondary somatosensory cortices (S2) in response to intensity-equivalent stimuli and the contralateral S1 and S2 in response to perceptually-equivalent stimuli. The amplitude of the contralateral S2 response in patients with FM was positively correlated with average pain intensity over the last week. Quantitative sensory testing results showed that patients with FM were more sensitive to painful IES as well as to mechanical stimulation, regardless of whether the stimulation site was the hand or the trapezius muscle. Interestingly, the slope of the stimulus-response relationship as well as temporal summation of pain in response to IES was not different between groups. Together, these results suggest that the observed pain augmentation in response to IES in patients with FM could be due to sensitization or disinhibition of the cortical somatosensory system. Since the S2 has been shown to play a role in higher-order functions, further studies are needed to clarify the role of augmented S2 response in clinical characteristics of FM."

Integrin α4β1 mediates a mixture of rolling and firm cell adhesion on vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) when in its resting state but only supports firm cell adhesion upon activation. The transition from rolling to firm cell adhesion is controlled by integrin activation. Kindlin-3 has been shown to bind to integrin β tails and trigger integrin activation via inside-out signaling. However, the role of kindlin-3 in regulating resting α4β1-mediated cell adhesion is not well characterized. Herein we demonstrate that kindlin-3 was required for the resting α4β1-mediated firm cell adhesion but not rolling adhesion. Knockdown of kindlin-3 significantly decreased the binding of kindlin-3 to β1 and down-regulated the binding affinity of the resting α4β1 to soluble VCAM-1. Notably, it converted the resting α4β1-mediated firm cell adhesion to rolling adhesion on VCAM-1 substrates, increased cell rolling velocity, and impaired the stability of cell adhesion. By contrast, firm cell adhesion mediated by Mn2+-activated α4β1 was barely affected by knockdown of kindlin-3. Structurally, lack of kindlin-3 led to a more bent conformation of the resting α4β1. Thus, kindlin-3 plays an important role in maintaining a proper conformation of the resting α4β1 to mediate both rolling and firm cell adhesion.

Besides the critical role of kindlin-3 in inducing integrin activation through inside-out signaling, it is also reported that kindlin-3 binds the resting integrin α4β7 at a high level, and the dissociation of kindlin-3 from β7 tail specifically increases the binding affinity of α4β7 to mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 but suppresses VCAM-1 binding (18.Sun H.

Cell. 2014; 30: 61-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, kindlin-3 may have distinct functions in regulating the resting and activated integrins. Although numerous studies have revealed the role of kindlin-3 in inside-out activation of integrin, little is known regarding its function in regulating the resting α4β1-mediated cell adhesion. Herein we report that kindlin-3 was required for the resting α4β1-mediated firm cell adhesion but not rolling adhesion under shear flow conditions. Silencing of kindlin-3 in K562 cells stably expressing human α4β1 (K562-α4β1) significantly decreased the binding of kindlin-3 to β1 and thus down-regulated the binding affinity of the resting α4β1 to soluble VCAM-1. Furthermore, knockdown of kindlin-3 converted the resting α4β1-mediated firm cell adhesion to rolling adhesion on VCAM-1 substrates, increased cell rolling velocity, and impaired the stability of cell adhesion under flow. By contrast, firm cell adhesion mediated by Mn2+-activated α4β1 was barely affected. Moreover, lack of kindlin-3 resulted in a more bent conformation of the resting α4β1. Re-expression of knockdown-resistant wild-type (WT) kindlin-3 but not integrin binding-deficient kindlin-3 mutant could rescue the observed defects in integrin α4β1-mediated cell adhesion and α4β1 conformation in kindlin-3 knockdown cells, suggesting that the observed defects were due to the deficient kindlin-3/integrin binding induced by kindlin-3 knockdown. Thus, kindlin-3 has an important role in maintaining a proper conformation of the resting α4β1 and its ability to mediate firm cell adhesion before activation. cDNA of human α4 integrin subunit was constructed in vector pcDNA3.1/Hygro(−) (Invitrogen). Kindlin-3 shRNA and luciferase shRNA were constructed in vector pLKO.1 (Invitrogen). The shRNA-resistant point mutation in WT kindlin-3 was generated using QuikChange (Stratagene); human kindlin-3 cDNA in vector pCDH-puro (Invitrogen) was used as the template. The kindlin-3 W596A mutation was generated using shRNA-resistant WT kindlin-3 construct as the template. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transient transfection of 293T cells was performed as described (21.Chen J. Salas A. Springer T.A. Bistable regulation of integrin adhesiveness by a bipolar metal ion cluster.Nat. Struct.

A polystyrene Petri dish was coated with a 5-mm diameter, 20-μl spot of 5 μg/ml purified VCAM-1/Fc in coating buffer (PBS, 10 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.0) for 1 h at 37 °C followed by 2% BSA in coating buffer for 1 h at 37 °C to block nonspecific binding sites. Cells were diluted to 1 × 106/ml in Buffer A (Hepes-buffered saline, 0.5% BSA) containing the indicated divalent cations immediately before infusion in the flow chamber. Cells were allowed to accumulate for 30 s at 0.3 dyne/cm2 and 10 s at 0.4 dyne/cm2. Then shear stress was increased every 10 s from 1 dyne/cm2 up to 32 dynes/cm2 in 2-fold increments. The number of cells remaining bound at the end of each 10-s interval was determined. Rolling velocity at each shear stress was calculated from the average distance traveled by rolling cells in 3 s. A velocity of 1 μm/s, which corresponds to a movement of ½ cell diameter during the 3-s measurement interval, was the minimum velocity required to define a cell as rolling instead of firmly adherent. For integrin α4β1 blocking, cells were preincubated with 20 μg/ml AIIB2 for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were prepared as described in the flow chamber assay and then infused in the flow chamber. Cells were allowed to accumulate for 0.3 dyne/cm2 and 10 s at 0.4 dyne/cm2. Then shear stress was increased every 10 s from 1 dyne/cm2 up to 16 dynes/cm2 in 2-fold increments. The cells remaining bound to VCAM-1 substrates (5 μg/ml) at each wall shear stress were determined as a percentage of initial adherent cells at 1 dyne/cm2. FRET was measured as described (33.Yue J.

For detecting the orientation of integrin ectodomain relative to cell membrane, cells were seeded on a poly-l-lysine (100 μg/ml)-coated surface in serum-free DMEM with the indicated divalent cation and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Adherent cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, and nonspecific sites were blocked by incubation with 10% serum-rich medium for 10 min at room temperature. Then cells were stained with 20 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated AIIB2 Fab, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-CD45 Fab, or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated Act-1 Fab for 40 min at 37 °C. After two washes, cells were labeled with 10 μm FM4-64 FX (Invitrogen) for 4 min on ice, washed once, and immediately mounted with Mowiol® 4-88 (Polysciences Inc.) mounting solution under a coverslip. The mounted slides were kept in the dark and subjected to photobleach FRET acquisition by a confocal microscope (TCS SP8, Leica). FRET efficiency (E) was calculated as E = 1 − (Fdonor(d)Pre/Fdonor(d)Post) where Fdonor(d)Pre and Fdonor(d)Post are the mean donor emission intensity of pre- and postphotobleaching. To investigate the role of kindlin-3 in α4β1-mediated cell adhesion, we knocked down the expression of kindlin-3 in K562-α4β1 cells. Cells were transduced with lentivirus-based control shRNA (luciferase shRNA) or kindlin-3-targeting shRNA (kindlin-3 shRNA). Reduced expression of kindlin-3 was verified by Western blotting analysis. Compared with the untransduced control cells, cells transduced with kindlin-3 shRNA showed an approximately 80% decrease in kindlin-3 expression (Fig. 1A). As a control, luciferase shRNA did not influence the kindlin-3 expression in the transfectant. To examine the off-target effect of kindlin-3 shRNA and the effect of kindlin-3 silencing-induced deficient kindlin-3/β1 integrin binding, we included two controls by re-expressing shRNA-resistant WT kindlin-3 or shRNA-resistant kindlin-3 mutant containing a tryptophan 596 to alanine point mutation (kindlin-3 W596A), which impairs β1 integrin binding (40.Ussar S.

Chem. 2009; 284: 11485-11497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), in kindlin-3 knockdown cells, respectively. The expression level of WT kindlin-3 and kindlin-3 W596A mutant in kindlin-3 knockdown K562-α4β1 stable cells was comparable with that of control cells (Fig. 1A). Flow cytometry analyses showed comparable levels of cell surface expression of α4β1 in control, kindlin-3-silenced, and kindlin-3-re-expressing cells (Fig. 1B), indicating that kindlin-3 expression does not affect the cell surface expression of α4β1 in K562-α4β1 cells. Next, we examined the effect of kindlin-3 knockdown on the association of kindlin-3 with the resting β1 integrin in 1 mm Ca2+/Mg2+ or with the activated β1 integrin in 1 mm Mn2+. A co-immunoprecipitation assay showed that knockdown of kindlin-3 significantly reduced the binding of kindlin-3 to both the resting and Mn2+-activated β1 integrins (Fig. 1C). As expected, re-expression of WT kindlin-3 in kindlin-3 knockdown cells restored the binding of kindlin-3 to β1 integrin to the level in control cells. However, re-expression of kindlin-3 W596A mutant did not rescue the kindlin-3 binding (Fig. 1C). Kindlins are coactivators of integrins (15.Kahner B.N. Kato H. Banno A. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J.

Chem. 2010; 285: 18640-18649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); therefore we next investigated the effect of reduced kindlin-3 expression on the ligand binding affinity of α4β1 by examining the binding of soluble VCAM-1/Fc to K562-α4β1 cells. The binding of soluble VCAM-1/Fc complexed with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-human IgG to K562-α4β1 transfectants in different divalent cations was measured by flow cytometry. Compared with the binding of VCAM-1/Fc complexes to K562-α4β1 in 1 mm Ca2+/Mg2+, VCAM-1/Fc binding was greatly enhanced in 1 mm Mn2+, indicating the increased ligand binding affinity after integrin activation by Mn2+ (Fig. 2). In the presence of 1 mm Ca2+/Mg2+, kindlin-3 knockdown cells showed a 53% decrease in VCAM-1/Fc binding compared with control cells. However, those cells showed only a 36% decrease in VCAM-1/Fc binding in the presence of 1 mm Mn2+. These data suggest that knockdown of kindlin-3 induces a greater decrease in the ligand binding affinity of the resting α4β1 than of Mn2+-activated α4β1. Moreover, re-expression of WT kindlin-3 rescued the observed defects in VCAM-1/Fc binding to integrin α4β1 in kindlin-3 knockdown cells, whereas re-expression of kindlin-3 W596A mutant showed no rescue effect (Fig. 2). These data suggest that the observed defects in α4β1-VCAM-1 binding are due to the deficient kindlin-3/β1 integrin binding induced by kindlin-3 knockdown. As a control, the binding of VCAM-1 was completely blocked by β1 integrin-blocking antibody AIIB2, indicating that VCAM-1 binding is β1 integrin-dependent. Integrin α4β1 mediates a mixtur"

Immense efforts have been devoted to identifying factors that can predict operative difficulty, but the results are inconsistent. Objective Our study was conducted to screen patients’ factors to build models for predicting the operative difficulty using well controlled data. Method We retrospectively reviewed records of 199 consecutive patients who had rectal cancers 5–8 cm from the anal verge. All underwent laparoscopic sphincter-preserving low anterior resections with total mesorectal excision (TME) and double stapling technique (DST). Data of 155 patients from one surgeon were utilized to build models to predict standardized endpoints (operative time, blood loss) and postoperative morbidity. Data of 44 patients from other surgeons were used to test the predictability of the built models. Results Our results showed prior abdominal surgery, preoperative chemoradiotherapy, tumor distance to anal verge, interspinous distance, and BMI were predictors for the standardized operative times. Gender and tumor maximum diameter were related to the standardized blood loss. Temporary diversion and tumor diameter were predictors for postoperative morbidity. The model constructed for the operative time demonstrated excellent predictability for patients from different surgeons. Conclusions With a well-controlled patient population, we have built a predictable model to estimate operative difficulty. The standardized operative time will make it possible to significantly increase sample size and build more reliable models to predict operative difficulty for clinical use."
https://openalex.org/W2302770853,"Duplicate address detection (DAD) is an important component of the address resolution protocol (ARP) and the neighbor discovery protocol (NDP). DAD determines whether an IP address is in conflict with other nodes. In traditional DAD, the target address to be detected is broadcast through the network, which provides convenience for malicious nodes to attack. A malicious node can send a spoofing reply to prevent the address configuration of a normal node, and thus, a denial-of-service attack is launched. This study proposes a hash method to hide the target address in DAD, which prevents an attack node from launching destination attacks. If the address of a normal node is identical to the detection address, then its hash value should be the same as the “Hash_64” field in the neighboring solicitation message. Consequently, DAD can be successfully completed. This process is called DAD-h. Simulation results indicate that address configuration using DAD-h has a considerably higher success rate when under attack compared with traditional DAD. Comparative analysis shows that DAD-h does not require third-party devices and considerable computing resources; it also provides a lightweight security resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2303137843,"In this study, we examined the influence of different nitrogen (N) application rates (0, 168, 240, 270 and 312 kg N ha(-1)) on soil properties, maize (Zea mays L.) yields and microbial communities of three types of soils (clay, alluvial and sandy soils). Phospholipid fatty acid analysis was used to characterize soil microbial communities. Results indicated that N fertilization significantly decreased microbial biomass in both clay and sandy soils regardless of application rate. These decreases were more likely a result of soil pH decreases induced by N fertilization, especially in the sandy soils. This is supported by structural equation modeling and redundancy analysis results. Nitrogen fertilization also led to significant changes in soil microbial community composition. However, the change differences were gradually dismissed with increase in N application rate. We also observed that N fertilization increased maize yields to the same level regardless of application rate. This suggests that farmers could apply N fertilizers at a lower rate (i.e. 168 kg N ha(-1)), which could achieve high maize yield on one hand while maintain soil microbial functions on the other hand."
https://openalex.org/W1890898617,"When two variables are related by a known function, the coefficient of determination (denoted R2) measures the proportion of the total variance in the observations explained by that function. For linear relationships, this is equal to the square of the correlation coefficient, ρ. When the parametric form of the relationship is unknown, however, it is unclear how to estimate the proportion of explained variance equitably--assigning similar values to equally noisy relationships. Here we demonstrate how to directly estimate a generalised R2 when the form of the relationship is unknown, and we consider the performance of the Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC)--a recently proposed information theoretic measure of dependence. We show that our approach behaves equitably, has more power than MIC to detect association between variables, and converges faster with increasing sample size. Most importantly, our approach generalises to higher dimensions, estimating the strength of multivariate relationships (Y against A, B, …) as well as measuring association while controlling for covariates (Y against X controlling for C).

After excluding ineligible subjects, the total number of subjects in the study was 8,963, including 4,091 males and 4,872 females. All participants reported disabilities related to spine OA. Plain radiographs of the spine were taken for all participants.Age, sex, smoking, drinking, education, and income level were significantly related to spine OA morbidity (P<0.05). OA morbidity was significantly higher in female ex-smokers (OR; 2.94, P<0.05). Quality of life (EQ-5D: L1~5) was significantly compromised in the group with spine OA compared to the group without spine OA (P<0.05). Overall, LQ 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 domain scores were significantly higher in the group with spine OA (P<0.05). In the group with spine OA, quality of life was reduced on more than three questions for 34.3% of the group (EQ-5D: grade≥2); on two questions, for 18.5% of the group; and on one question, for 11.1% of the group. Mental stress, melancholy, and suicidal thinking were also more common in the group with spine OA (P<0.05). The group with radiographic spine OA but without symptoms did not have compromised EQ-5D scores, whereas the group with radiographic OA and symptoms showed a significantly reduced quality of life.Quality of life was significantly reduced in the group with symptomatic spine OA in a large cross-sectional analysis. Physicians should consider quality of life in the treatment of patients with spine OA."
https://openalex.org/W2300576922,"Introduction Ethiopia achieved a rapid expansion of TB microscopic centers for acid fast bacilli (AFB). However, external quality assurance (EQA) services were, until recently, limited to few regional and sub-regional laboratories. In this paper, we describe the decentralization experience and the result of EQA using random blinded rechecking. Materials and Methods The routine EQA quarterly report was compiled and analyzed. A positive result by the microscopic center while the EQA center reported negative result is categorized as false positive (FP). A negative result by the microscopic center while the EQA center reported positive is considered false negative (FN). The reading of EQA centers was considered a gold standard to compute the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) of the readings of microscopic centers. Results We decentralized sputum smear AFB EQA from 4 Regional Laboratories (RRLs) to 82 EQA centers and enrolled 956 health facilities in EQA schemes. Enrollment of HFs in EQA was gradual because it required training and mentoring laboratory professionals, institutionalizing internal QA measures, equipping all HFs to perform diagnosis, and establishing more EQA centers. From 2012 to 2014 (Phase I), the FP rate declined from 0.6% to 0.2% and FN fell from as high as 7.6% to 1.6% in supported health facilities (HFs). In HFs that joined in Phase II, FN rates ranged from 5.6 to 7.3%. The proportion of HFs without errors has increased from 77.9% to 90.5% in Phase I HFs and from 82.9% to 86.9% in Phase II HFs. Overall sensitivity and specificity were 95.0% and 99.7%, respectively. PPV and NPV were 93.3% and 99.7%, respectively. Conclusion Decentralizing blinded rechecking of sputum smear microscopy is feasible in low-income settings. While a comprehensive laboratory improvement strategy enhanced the quality of microscopy, laboratory professionals’ capacity in slide reading and smear quality requires continued support."
https://openalex.org/W2300820337,"Predation and competition are critical processes influencing the ecology of organisms, and can play an integral role in shaping coral reef fish communities. This study compared the relative and interacting effects of competition and predation on two competing species of coral reef fish, Pomacentrus amboinensis and P. moluccensis (Pomacentridae), using a multifactorial experiment. Fish were subjected to the sight and smell of a known predator (Pseudochromis fuscus), the presence of the heterospecific competitor (i.e., P. amboinensis vs. P. moluccensis), or a combination of the two for a period of 19 days. The sub-lethal effects of predator/competitor treatments were compared with controls; a combination of otolith microstructure analysis and observations were used to determine otolith growth patterns and behaviour. We predicted that the stress of competition and/or predation would result in strong sub-lethal impacts, and act synergistically on growth and behavioural patterns. We found strong evidence to support this prediction, but only for P. amboinensis, which suffered reductions in growth in both predator and competitor treatments, with the largest reductions occurring when subjected to both predation and competition concurrently. There was strong evidence of asymmetrical competition between the two damselfish species, with P. moluccensis as the dominant competitor, displaying strong aggressive behaviour towards P. amboinensis. Growth reductions for P. amboinensis in predator/competitor treatments appeared to come about primarily due to increases in shelter seeking behaviour, which significantly reduced the foraging rates of individuals compared with controls. These data highlight the importance of predator/competitor synergisms in influencing key behaviours and demographic parameters for juvenile coral reef fishes."

The results herein have revealed a set of residues R65-E69 on MDM2 proximal to the p53 hydrophobic binding pocket that exhibited an energetic profile deviating significantly from similar residues elsewhere in the protein. In light of the continued search for novel competitive inhibitors for MDM2, we discuss possible implications of our findings on the drug discovery field."

Methods Retrospective review of 191 cases of bartonellosis managed in Caraz District Hospital, Peru, during the last outbreak (2003). Results The majority of cases (65%) were 14 years old and younger. There was a peak in acute cases after the rainy season; chronic cases presented more constantly throughout the year. The sensitivity of blood smear against blood culture in acute disease was 25%. The most commonly used treatment for chronic disease was rifampicin; chloramphenicol was used to treat most acute cases. Complications arose in 6.8% and there were no deaths. Conclusions Diagnostic and treatment algorithms for acute and chronic bartonellosis have been developed without a strong evidence base. Preparation of ready-to-go operational research protocols for future outbreaks would strengthen the evidence base for diagnostic and treatment strategies and enhance opportunities for control."
https://openalex.org/W2300549329,"Thirty healthy adults completed a mediolateral weight-shifting balance task in which they were instructed to shift their weight to visually displayed target regions. A model-based filter and three different moving average filters employing 10, 34, and 58 samples were applied to the center of pressure visual feedback that guided the activity. The effects of filter selection on both the displayed feedback and the shift performance were examined in terms of shift time and non-minimum phase behavior. Shift time relates to feedback delay and shift speed, whereas non-minimum phase behavior relates to the force applied in shift initiation. Results indicated that increasing the number of samples in moving average filters (indicative of stronger filtering) significantly increases shift speed and shift initiation force. These effects indicate that careful selection and documentation of data filtering is warranted in future work and suggest opportunities for strategic filtering of visual feedback in clinical weight-shifting balance activities in order to improve outcomes based on such feedback."
https://openalex.org/W2308369905,"The sequence of cattle genome provided a valuable opportunity to systematically link genetic and metabolic traits of cattle. The objectives of this study were 1) to reconstruct genome-scale cattle-specific metabolic pathways based on the most recent and updated cattle genome build and 2) to identify duplicated metabolic genes in the cattle genome for better understanding of metabolic adaptations in cattle. A bioinformatic pipeline of an organism for amalgamating genomic annotations from multiple sources was updated. Using this, an amalgamated cattle genome database based on UMD_3.1, was created. The amalgamated cattle genome database is composed of a total of 33,292 genes: 19,123 consensus genes between NCBI and Ensembl databases, 8,410 and 5,493 genes only found in NCBI or Ensembl, respectively, and 266 genes from NCBI scaffolds. A metabolic reconstruction of the cattle genome and cattle pathway genome database (PGDB) was also developed using Pathway Tools, followed by an intensive manual curation. The manual curation filled or revised 68 pathway holes, deleted 36 metabolic pathways, and added 23 metabolic pathways. Consequently, the curated cattle PGDB contains 304 metabolic pathways, 2,460 reactions including 2,371 enzymatic reactions, and 4,012 enzymes. Furthermore, this study identified eight duplicated genes in 12 metabolic pathways in the cattle genome compared to human and mouse. Some of these duplicated genes are related with specific hormone biosynthesis and detoxifications. The updated genome-scale metabolic reconstruction is a useful tool for understanding biology and metabolic characteristics in cattle. There has been significant improvements in the quality of cattle genome annotations and the MetaCyc database. The duplicated metabolic genes in the cattle genome compared to human and mouse implies evolutionary changes in the cattle genome and provides a useful information for further research on understanding metabolic adaptations of cattle."
