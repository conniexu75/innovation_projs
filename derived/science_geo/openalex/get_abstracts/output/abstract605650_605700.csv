https://openalex.org/W2788633781,"The implementation of clinical-decision support algorithms for medical imaging faces challenges with reliability and interpretability. Here, we establish a diagnostic tool based on a deep-learning framework for the screening of patients with common treatable blinding retinal diseases. Our framework utilizes transfer learning, which trains a neural network with a fraction of the data of conventional approaches. Applying this approach to a dataset of optical coherence tomography images, we demonstrate performance comparable to that of human experts in classifying age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema. We also provide a more transparent and interpretable diagnosis by highlighting the regions recognized by the neural network. We further demonstrate the general applicability of our AI system for diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia using chest X-ray images. This tool may ultimately aid in expediting the diagnosis and referral of these treatable conditions, thereby facilitating earlier treatment, resulting in improved clinical outcomes. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W2789008353,"The extracellular space (ECS) of the brain has an extremely complex spatial organization, which has defied conventional light microscopy. Consequently, despite a marked interest in the physiological roles of brain ECS, its structure and dynamics remain largely inaccessible for experimenters. We combined 3D-STED microscopy and fluorescent labeling of the extracellular fluid to develop super-resolution shadow imaging (SUSHI) of brain ECS in living organotypic brain slices. SUSHI enables quantitative analysis of ECS structure and reveals dynamics on multiple scales in response to a variety of physiological stimuli. Because SUSHI produces sharp negative images of all cellular structures, it also enables unbiased imaging of unlabeled brain cells with respect to their anatomical context. Moreover, the extracellular labeling strategy greatly alleviates problems of photobleaching and phototoxicity associated with traditional imaging approaches. As a straightforward variant of STED microscopy, SUSHI provides unprecedented access to the structure and dynamics of live brain ECS and neuropil."
https://openalex.org/W2626923045,"X-linked Dystonia-Parkinsonism (XDP) is a Mendelian neurodegenerative disease that is endemic to the Philippines and is associated with a founder haplotype. We integrated multiple genome and transcriptome assembly technologies to narrow the causal mutation to the TAF1 locus, which included a SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) retrotransposition into intron 32 of the gene. Transcriptome analyses identified decreased expression of the canonical cTAF1 transcript among XDP probands, and de novo assembly across multiple pluripotent stem-cell-derived neuronal lineages discovered aberrant TAF1 transcription that involved alternative splicing and intron retention (IR) in proximity to the SVA that was anti-correlated with overall TAF1 expression. CRISPR/Cas9 excision of the SVA rescued this XDP-specific transcriptional signature and normalized TAF1 expression in probands. These data suggest an SVA-mediated aberrant transcriptional mechanism associated with XDP and may provide a roadmap for layered technologies and integrated assembly-based analyses for other unsolved Mendelian disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2788408124,"How signaling dynamics encode information is a central question in biology. During vertebrate development, dynamic Notch signaling oscillations control segmentation of the presomitic mesoderm (PSM). In mouse embryos, this molecular clock comprises signaling oscillations of several pathways, i.e., Notch, Wnt, and FGF signaling. Here, we directly address the role of the relative timing between Wnt and Notch signaling oscillations during PSM patterning. To this end, we developed a new experimental strategy using microfluidics-based entrainment that enables specific control of the rhythm of segmentation clock oscillations. Using this approach, we find that Wnt and Notch signaling are coupled at the level of their oscillation dynamics. Furthermore, we provide functional evidence that the oscillation phase shift between Wnt and Notch signaling is critical for PSM segmentation. Our work hence reveals that dynamic signaling, i.e., the relative timing between oscillatory signals, encodes essential information during multicellular development."
https://openalex.org/W4250821936,"Bacterial mechanisms of drug resistance operate at sequential lines of defense tackling drug at entry, accumulation, target binding, or downstream toxicity. These mechanisms are encoded by genomic changes ranging in scale from point mutations, through assembly of preexisting genetic elements, to horizontal import of genes from the environment. A many-to-many relationship prevails between resistance mechanisms and the spectrum of genetic changes encoding them."
https://openalex.org/W2788548190,"To better understand the gene regulatory mechanisms that program developmental processes, we carried out simultaneous genome-wide measurements of mRNA, translation, and protein through meiotic differentiation in budding yeast. Surprisingly, we observed that the levels of several hundred mRNAs are anti-correlated with their corresponding protein products. We show that rather than arising from canonical forms of gene regulatory control, the regulation of at least 380 such cases, or over 8% of all measured genes, involves temporally regulated switching between production of a canonical, translatable transcript and a 5' extended isoform that is not efficiently translated into protein. By this pervasive mechanism for the modulation of protein levels through a natural developmental program, a single transcription factor can coordinately activate and repress protein synthesis for distinct sets of genes. The distinction is not based on whether or not an mRNA is induced but rather on the type of transcript produced."
https://openalex.org/W2788138562,"Certain mutations can cause proteins to accumulate in neurons, leading to neurodegeneration. We recently showed, however, that upregulation of a wild-type protein, Ataxin1, caused by haploinsufficiency of its repressor, the RNA-binding protein Pumilio1 (PUM1), also causes neurodegeneration in mice. We therefore searched for human patients with PUM1 mutations. We identified eleven individuals with either PUM1 deletions or de novo missense variants who suffer a developmental syndrome (Pumilio1-associated developmental disability, ataxia, and seizure; PADDAS). We also identified a milder missense mutation in a family with adult-onset ataxia with incomplete penetrance (Pumilio1-related cerebellar ataxia, PRCA). Studies in patient-derived cells revealed that the missense mutations reduced PUM1 protein levels by ∼25% in the adult-onset cases and by ∼50% in the infantile-onset cases; levels of known PUM1 targets increased accordingly. Changes in protein levels thus track with phenotypic severity, and identifying posttranscriptional modulators of protein expression should identify new candidate disease genes."
https://openalex.org/W2788495409,"Viruses that are typically benign sometimes invade the brainstem in otherwise healthy children. We report bi-allelic DBR1 mutations in unrelated patients from different ethnicities, each of whom had brainstem infection due to herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), influenza virus, or norovirus. DBR1 encodes the only known RNA lariat debranching enzyme. We show that DBR1 expression is ubiquitous, but strongest in the spinal cord and brainstem. We also show that all DBR1 mutant alleles are severely hypomorphic, in terms of expression and function. The fibroblasts of DBR1-mutated patients contain higher RNA lariat levels than control cells, this difference becoming even more marked during HSV1 infection. Finally, we show that the patients' fibroblasts are highly susceptible to HSV1. RNA lariat accumulation and viral susceptibility are rescued by wild-type DBR1. Autosomal recessive, partial DBR1 deficiency underlies viral infection of the brainstem in humans through the disruption of tissue-specific and cell-intrinsic immunity to viruses."

Yeast have a single H3K4 HMT, SET1, that is present in a multiprotein (COMPASS) complex responsible for all H3K4 methylation (Schneider et al., 2005Schneider J. Wood A. Lee J.S. Schuster R. Dueker J. Maguire C. Swanson S.K. Florens L. Washburn M.P. Shilatifard A. Molecular regulation of histone H3 trimethylation by COMPASS and the regulation of gene expression.Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 849-856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Mammals have 6 homologs of yeast SET1 that possess H3K4 HMT activity, including MLL1–4 (KMT2A–D) and SETD1A/B (KMT2F/G). Each of these enzymes is found in a multiprotein complex with overlapping subunits. While each of these complexes have been shown to possess H3K4 HMT activity, the extent to which their cellular functions are largely a result of SET-domain-associated enzymatic activity is unclear. One of the most well-characterized mammalian SET1 homologs is MLL1. MLL1 is found in fusion proteins generated by chromosomal translocation of the MLL1 gene to one of more than 60 different partner genes (Krivtsov and Armstrong, 2007Krivtsov A.V. Armstrong S.A. MLL translocations, histone modifications and leukaemia stem-cell development.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 823-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Pediatric acute leukemia cases with MLL1-rearrangement (MLL-r) have a poor prognosis (Balgobind et al., 2009Balgobind B.V. Raimondi S.C. Harbott J. Zimmermann M. Alonzo T.A. Auvrignon A.

Recent studies have shown that wild-type MLL proteins play a role in MLL-r leukemia, but the mechanistic details and whether these roles are dependent on H3K4 HMT activity are just beginning to be explored (Milne et al., 2010Milne T.A.

Wild-type MLL1 is also indispensable for several subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) beyond MLL-r AML including MN1-expressing leukemia, NPM1-mutated leukemia and NUP98-rearranged leukemia (Kühn et al., 2016Kühn M.W.

However, the catalytic SET domain of the MLL1 protein is dispensable for leukemia growth suggesting a non-catalytic function of wild-type MLL1 and redundancies such that other SET1 homologs might contribute H3K4 HMT activity (Kühn et al., 2016Kühn M.W. Song E. Feng Z. Sinha A. Chen C.W. Deshpande A.J. Cusan M. Farnoud N. Mupo A.

Since the enzymatic domains of the SET1 vertebrate homologs are highly conserved during evolution, these homologs might have both redundant and unique functions in regulating H3K4 methylation and leukemia cell proliferation. Distinguishing the dependencies on enzymatic and non-enzymatic functions in leukemia will shape small-molecule drug development focused on targeting chromatin-associated, epigenetic mechanisms. Notable functional differences between closely related SET1 homologs have been characterized in leukemia. For instance, although MLL3 and MLL4 are homologs of Drosophila Trithorax-related (Trr), MLL4 has a tumor-promoting role in MLL-r leukemia (Santos et al., 2014Santos M.A. Faryabi R.B. Ergen A.V. Day A.M. Malhowski A. Canela A. Onozawa M. Lee J.E. Callen E. Gutierrez-Martinez P. et al.DNA-damage-induced differentiation of leukaemic cells as an anti-cancer barrier.Nature. 2014; 514: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), while MLL3 is a tumor suppressor in −7/del(7q) AML (Chen et al., 2014Chen C. Liu Y. Rappaport A.R. Kitzing T. Schultz N. Zhao Z. Shroff A.S. Dickins R.A. Vakoc C.R. Bradner J.E. et al.MLL3 is a haploinsufficient 7q tumor suppressor in acute myeloid leukemia.Cancer Cell. 2014; 25: 652-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Differences such as these highlight the importance of defining unique functions of SET1 homologs. Homolog-specific binding proteins are likely one of the factors that influence the biologic activity of the different MLL complexes. For instance, MEN1 (also known as Menin) is a specific binding partner of MLL1/MLL2, and it is essential for chromatin binding and leukemogenic activity of MLL1 fusion proteins (Hughes et al., 2004Hughes C.M. Rozenblatt-Rosen O. Milne T.A. Copeland T.D. Levine S.S. Lee J.C. Hayes D.N. Shanmugam K.S. Bhattacharjee A.

Importantly, drugs targeting SET1 homolog binding partners have been identified as potential therapeutic tools against MLL-r/non-MLL-r leukemia and other solid cancers (Borkin et al., 2015Borkin D.

Thus, to identify novel therapeutic drug targets in cancer, we need to better understand the unique protein-protein interactions and the functional roles of H3K4 HMT complexes in normal cells and in cancer cells. Here, we report the essential roles of SETD1A in cell proliferation and define a novel protein-interacting domain in SETD1A. We show that the domain is required for the regulation of DNA damage response genes and that this novel domain binds cyclin K. Our data also demonstrate that SETD1A/cyclin K control DNA damage response gene expression during the S phase of the cell cycle. These results reveal a non-redundant and non-enzymatic role of SETD1A and suggest a potential therapeutic opportunity for leukemia and potentially other tumors. To identify MLL/SET/COMAPSS complex subunits important for leukemia cell growth, we performed a small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-based screen with murine MLL-AF9 leukemia cells. We prepared 42 individual-shRNA vectors against MLL family members and COMPASS subunits and then performed a growth competition assay (Figure 1A). Toxicity from Setd1a, Cxxc1, Hcfc1, and Wdr5 shRNAs suggested that the SETD1A/COMPASS complex might have critical roles in MLL-AF9 leukemia cells (Figure 1A). Efficacy and specificity of shRNAs were confirmed by rescue experiments with an exogenous SETD1A construct (Figures S1A–S1C). To evaluate the effect of Setd1a knockdown in greater detail, we generated murine MLL-AF9 leukemia single-cell clones that highly express a doxycycline-inducible Setd1a shRNA. After doxycycline administration, two Setd1a shRNAs showed significant suppression of Setd1a expression (Figure 1B), and inhibition of leukemia cell proliferation (Figure 1C). Setd1a shRNAs induced apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest, and neutrophilic differentiation (Figures 1D, 1E, and S1D). To examine and compare the functional role of Setd1a and Setd1b on H3K4 methylation, we also performed an inducible knockdown of either Setd1a or Setd1b, or both genes in murine MLL-AF9 leukemia cells (Figures 1F and S1E–S1I). Even in this setting, Setd1a knockdown predominantly induced growth arrest and cell differentiation (Figures S1H and S1I). Surprisingly, Setd1a knockdown did not show reduction of global H3K4me3 (Figure 1F). H3K4me3 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) also showed no obvious change in H3K4me3 after knockdown of Setd1a (Figure S1J). To confirm these effects on other leukemia cells, we suppressed SETD1A in the MOLM-13 human leukemia cell line (Figures S1K). Consistent with murine cells, SETD1A shRNA expression in MOLM-13 cells induced growth arrest and differentiation (Figures S1L and S1M). To examine a role for SETD1A in leukemia progression in vivo, we performed a Setd1a knockdown experiment in a MLL-AF9 murine leukemia model. At 3 weeks post-transplantation, Setd1a shRNAs significantly suppressed the frequency of leukemia cells in the peripheral blood (PB) (Figure 1G). In addition, Setd1a shRNA constructs significantly prolonged the survival of recipient mice (Figures 1H). Consistent with data from the PB, Setd1a knockdown strongly suppressed the growth of leukemia cells in bone marrow (Figure S1N). In mice that did get sick in the Setd1a knockdown group, we did not observe GFP++ cells in their bone marrow (BM) (Figure S1O), demonstrating loss of Setd1a shRNA expression. When we sorted GFP++ cells expressing Setd1a shRNAs from the bone marrow and spleen at earlier time points, these cells showed comparable H3K4me3 levels (Figure S1P), lower Setd1a expression (Figure S1Q), higher percentage of apoptotic cells (Figure 1I), and decreased proliferation (Figure S1R). The morphology and Gr-1 expression of the GFP++ cells also indicated induction of differentiation by Setd1a suppression in vivo (Figures 1J and S1S). These data show that Setd1a has indispensable roles in leukemia cell proliferation and leukemia progression.Figure S1Knockdown of Setd1b by miR-E Suppresses Cell Growth, but Does Not Induce Cell Differentiation in MLL-AF9 Leukemia Cells, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Setd1a expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR in mouse MLL-AF9 leukemia cells that were transfected with non-targeting control (shRen) or 3 independent Setd1a shRNAs.

To evaluate the functional dependency on SETD1A, we performed rescue experiments with exogenous SETD1A mutant constructs (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2A). As expected, wild-type SETD1A expression restored the growth of RFP+ Setd1a shRNA-expressing cells (Figure S2B). Although the RRM domain deletion mutant failed to fully rescue cell growth at 12 days post-doxycycline, deletion of NSET and SET domains completely rescued the growth of Setd1a knockdown cells (Figures S2C).

https://openalex.org/W2791403082,"Human exposure to green space and vegetation is widely recognized to result in physical and mental health benefits; however, to date, the specific effects of tree cover, diversity, and species composition on student academic performance have not been investigated. We compiled standardized performance scores in Grades 3 and 6 for the collective student body in 387 schools across the Toronto District School Board (TDSB), and examined variation in relation to tree cover, tree diversity, and tree species composition based on comprehensive inventories of trees on school properties combined with aerial-photo-based assessments of tree cover. Analyses accounted for variation due to socioeconomic factors using the learning opportunity index (LOI), a regional composite index of external challenges to learning that incorporates income and other factors, such as students with English as a second language. As expected, LOI had the greatest influence on student academic performance; however, the proportion of tree cover, as distinct from other types of ""green space"" such as grass, was found to be a significant positive predictor of student performance, accounting for 13% of the variance explained in a statistical model predicting mean student performance assessments. The effects of tree cover and species composition were most pronounced in schools that showed the highest level of external challenges, suggesting the importance of urban forestry investments in these schools."

However, molecular insights into the NC assembly process are lacking. Using a hybrid approach, we characterized the NC-like assembly of eNP, identified novel regulatory elements, and described how these elements impact function. We generated a three-dimensional structure of the eNP NC-like assembly at 5.8 Å using electron cryo-microscopy and identified a new regulatory role for eNP helices α22–α23. Biochemical, biophysical, and mutational analyses revealed that inter-eNP contacts within α22–α23 are critical for viral NC assembly and regulate viral RNA synthesis. These observations suggest that the N terminus and α22–α23 of eNP function as context-dependent regulatory modules (CDRMs). Our current study provides a framework for a structural mechanism for NC-like assembly and a new therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2788203519,"Higher Education (HE), once the prerogative of a tiny elite, is now accessible to larger numbers of people around the world than ever before yet despite the fact that an understanding of student satisfaction has never been more important for today's universities, the concept remains poorly understood. Here we use published data from the UK's National Student Survey (NSS), representing data from 2.3 million full-time students collected from 2007 to 2016, as a case study of the benefits and limitations of measuring student satisfaction that might have applicability for other countries, particularly those that, like the UK, have experienced significant growth in student numbers. The analyses showed that the factor structure of the NSS remained generally stable and that the ability of the NSS to discriminate between different subjects at different universities actually improved over the ten-year sample period. The best predictors of overall satisfaction were 'Teaching Quality' and 'Organisation & Management', with 'Assessment & Feedback' having relatively weak predictive ability, despite the sector's tangible efforts to improve on this metric. The tripling of student fees in 2012 for English students (but not the rest of the UK) was used as a 'natural experiment' to investigate the sensitivity of student satisfaction ratings to the real economic costs of HE. The tuition fee increase had no identifiable negative effect, with student satisfaction steadily improving throughout the decade. Although the NSS was never designed to measure perceived value-for-money, its insensitivity to major changes in the economic costs of HE to the individual suggest that the conventional concept of student satisfaction is incomplete. As such we propose that the concept of student satisfaction: (i) needs to be widened to take into account the broader economic benefits to the individual student by including measures of perceived value-for-money and (ii) should measure students' level of satisfaction in the years post-graduation, by which time they may have a greater appreciation of the value of their degree in the workplace."
https://openalex.org/W2793491712,"Objective To evaluate the association between racial residential segregation, a prominent manifestation of systemic racism, and the White-Black survival gap in a contemporary cohort of adults, and to assess the extent to which socioeconomic inequality explains this association. Design This was a cross sectional study of White and Black men and women aged 35–75 living in 102 large US Core Based Statistical Areas. The main outcome was the White-Black survival gap. We used 2009–2013 CDC mortality data for Black and White men and women to calculate age-, sex- and race adjusted White and Black mortality rates. We measured segregation using the Dissimilarity index, obtained from the Manhattan Institute. We used the 2009–2013 American Community Survey to define indicators of socioeconomic inequality. We estimated the CBSA-level White–Black gap in probability of survival using sequential linear regression models accounting for the CBSA dissimilarity index and race-specific socioeconomic indicators. Results Black men and women had a 14% and 9% lower probability of survival from age 35 to 75 than their white counterparts. Residential segregation was strongly associated with the survival gap, and this relationship was partly, but not fully, explained by socioeconomic inequality. At the lowest observed level of segregation, and with the Black socioeconomic status (SES) assumed to be at the White SES level scenario, the survival gap is essentially eliminated. Conclusion White-Black differences in survival remain wide notwithstanding public health efforts to improve life expectancy and initiatives to reduce health disparities. Eliminating racial residential segregation and bringing Black socioeconomic status (SES) to White SES levels would eliminate the White-Black survival gap."
https://openalex.org/W2788551722,"Interneurons navigate along multiple tangential paths to settle into appropriate cortical layers. They undergo a saltatory migration paced by intermittent nuclear jumps whose regulation relies on interplay between extracellular cues and genetic-encoded information. It remains unclear how cycles of pause and movement are coordinated at the molecular level. Post-translational modification of proteins contributes to cell migration regulation. The present study uncovers that carboxypeptidase 1, which promotes post-translational protein deglutamylation, controls the pausing of migrating cortical interneurons. Moreover, we demonstrate that pausing during migration attenuates movement simultaneity at the population level, thereby controlling the flow of interneurons invading the cortex. Interfering with the regulation of pausing not only affects the size of the cortical interneuron cohort but also impairs the generation of age-matched projection neurons of the upper layers."
https://openalex.org/W2792578296,"Excess mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation promotes target organ dysfunction, vascular injury and fibrosis. MR antagonists like eplerenone are used for treating heart failure, but their use is limited due to the compound class-inherent hyperkalemia risk. Here we present evidence that AZD9977, a first-in-class MR modulator shows cardio-renal protection despite a mechanism-based reduced liability to cause hyperkalemia. AZD9977 in vitro potency and binding mode to MR were characterized using reporter gene, binding, cofactor recruitment assays and X-ray crystallopgraphy. Organ protection was studied in uni-nephrectomised db/db mice and uni-nephrectomised rats administered aldosterone and high salt. Acute effects of single compound doses on urinary electrolyte excretion were tested in rats on a low salt diet. AZD9977 and eplerenone showed similar human MR in vitro potencies. Unlike eplerenone, AZD9977 is a partial MR antagonist due to its unique interaction pattern with MR, which results in a distinct recruitment of co-factor peptides when compared to eplerenone. AZD9977 dose dependently reduced albuminuria and improved kidney histopathology similar to eplerenone in db/db uni-nephrectomised mice and uni-nephrectomised rats. In acute testing, AZD9977 did not affect urinary Na+/K+ ratio, while eplerenone increased the Na+/K+ ratio dose dependently. AZD9977 is a selective MR modulator, retaining organ protection without acute effect on urinary electrolyte excretion. This predicts a reduced hyperkalemia risk and AZD9977 therefore has the potential to deliver a safe, efficacious treatment to patients prone to hyperkalemia."
https://openalex.org/W2793231859,"Objectives Knowledge concerning antibiotic use in the general population is insufficient. The way health literacy is related to antibiotic use aside from knowledge needs further investigation. Our aim was to compare the levels of knowledge of antibiotics and health literacy in individuals who had taken antibiotics in recent years compared with those who not had taken antibiotics. Methods A population-based cross-sectional survey of 2,000 individuals aged 35 and older from Berlin, Germany and its surrounding rural and suburban areas (response rate 59%) with strata urban/rural, sex, age, and education. Computer-assisted personal interviews were conducted by external, trained interviewers during home visits. Knowledge, health literacy, and antibiotic use were assessed using standardized questionnaires. Results In all, 33.3% (666/2,000) of the participants indicated having had an antimicrobial therapy during the previous 12 months. Adjusting for sex, age, educational level and health literacy, individuals with four correct answers regarding antibiotics were 1.70 times and those with three correct answers 1.94 more likely to have had a history of recent antibiotic use than those who did not have any correct answers. Individuals with sufficient health literacy were 0.57 times less likely to have had a recent history of antibiotic use than individuals with insufficient health literacy. Conclusion Patients who have used antibiotics might have more knowledge as a result of their recent involvement with the topic of antibiotic use; health literacy may be a preventive mechanism to use antibiotics more critically. Besides improving the health knowledge of the general population and of vulnerable groups such as patients with low levels of health literacy, intervention strategies should focus on providers as well."

Many (pre)analytical issues remain to be resolved for miRNA screening with TaqMan Low Density Arrays (TLDA) in plasma samples, such as optimal RNA isolation, preamplification and data normalization. We optimized the TLDA protocol using three RNA isolation protocols and preamplification dilutions. By using 100μL elution volume during RNA isolation and adding a preamplification step without dilution, 49% of wells were amplified. Informative target miRNA were defined as having quantification cycle values ≤35 in at least 20% of samples and low technical variability (CV across 2 duplicates of 1 sample <4%). A total of 218 miRNA was considered informative (= 59% of all target miRNA). Different normalization strategies were compared: exogenous Ath-miR-159a, endogenous RNA U6, and three mathematical normalization techniques: geNorm (Qbase, QB) and NormFinder (NF) normalization algorithms, and global mean calculation. To select the best normalization method, technical variability, biological variability, stability, and the extent to which the normalization method reduces data dispersion were calculated. The geNorm normalization algorithm reduced data dispersion to the greatest extent, while endogenous RNA U6 performed worst. In conclusion, for miRNA profiling in plasma samples using TLDA cards we recommend: 1. Implementing a preamplification step in the TLDA protocol without diluting the final preamplification product 2. A stepwise approach to exclude non-informative miRNA based on quality control parameters 3. Against using snoRNA U6 as normalization method for relative quantification 4. Using the geNorm algorithm as normalization method for relative quantification."

The patients filled out a questionnaire asking whether they were previously diagnosed with the comorbidities in interest. Obstructive sleep apnea was diagnosed and categorized based on a standard respiratory polygraphic sleep study using a type 3 portable monitor. The patients' weight, height and blood pressure were measured during the consultations.In total, 37.9% were categorized as not having obstructive sleep apnea (Apnea-hypopnea index <5), 29.6% mild obstructive sleep apnea (Apnea-hypopnea index 5-14.9), 17.3% moderate obstructive sleep apnea (Apnea-hypopnea index 15-29.9), and 15.2% severe obstructive sleep apnea (Apnea-hypopnea index ≥30). The prevalence of heart attack, angina pectoris, hypertension, measured systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg, measured diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg, diabetes mellitus and obesity (body mass index≥30) were higher with greater obstructive sleep apnea severity. Logistic and linear regression analyses showed that these comorbidities were positively associated with obstructive sleep apnea severity. This was not the case for stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. After adjustment for sex, age, alcohol and smoking in the logistic regression analyses, hypertension, measured systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg, measured diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg and obesity remained positively associated with obstructive sleep apnea severity.A higher prevalence of heart attack, angina pectoris, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity was seen with greater obstructive sleep apnea severity. Obesity and hypertension, conditions easy to clinically assess, appear as the most central comorbidities with greater obstructive sleep apnea severity."
https://openalex.org/W2792912382,"It is well known that saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and unsaturated fatty acid, in particular omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), have different effects on inflammatory signaling: SFAs are pro-inflammatory but n-3 PUFAs have strong anti-inflammatory properties. We have reported that palmitic acid (PA), a saturated fatty acid, robustly amplifies lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signaling to upregulate proinflammatory gene expression in macrophages. We also reported that the increased production of ceramide (CER) via sphingomyelin (SM) hydrolysis and CER de novo synthesis plays a key role in the synergistic effect of LPS and PA on proinflammatory gene expression. However, it remains unclear if n-3 PUFAs are capable of antagonizing the synergistic effect of LPS and PA on gene expression and CER production. In this study, we employed the above macrophage culture system and lipidomical analysis to assess the effect of n-3 PUFAs on proinflammatory gene expression and CER production stimulated by LPS and PA. Results showed that DHA strongly inhibited the synergistic effect of LPS and PA on proinflammatory gene expression by targeting nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB)-dependent gene transcription. Results also showed that DHA inhibited the cooperative effect of LPS and PA on CER production by targeting CER de novo synthesis, but not SM hydrolysis. Furthermore, results showed that myriocin, a specific inhibitor of serine palmitoyltransferase, strongly inhibited both LPS-PA-stimulated CER synthesis and proinflammatory gene expression, indicating that CER synthesis is associated with proinflammatory gene expression and that inhibition of CER synthesis contributes to DHA-inhibited proinflammatory gene expression. Taken together, this study demonstrates that DHA antagonizes the boosting effect of PA on LPS signaling on proinflammatory gene expression by targeting both NFκB-dependent transcription and CER de novo synthesis in macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2790127711,"Micronutrient deficiency, also known as the hidden hunger, affects over two billion people worldwide. Potato is the third most consumed food crops in the world, and is therefore a fundamental element of food security for millions of people. Increasing the amount of micronutrients in food crop could help alleviate worldwide micronutrient malnutrition. In the present study, we report on the identification of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers associated with folate, an essential micronutrient in the human diet. A high folate diploid clone Fol 1.6 from the wild potato relative Solanum boliviense (PI 597736) was crossed with a low/medium folate diploid S. tuberosum clone USW4self#3. The resulting F1 progeny was intermated to generate an F2 population, and tubers from 94 F2 individuals were harvested for folate analysis and SNP genotyping using a SolCap 12K Potato SNP array. Folate content in the progeny ranged from 304 to 2,952 ng g-1 dry weight. 6,759 high quality SNPs containing 4,174 (62%) polymorphic and 2,585 (38%) monomorphic SNPs were used to investigate marker-trait association. Association analysis was performed using two different approaches: survey SNP-trait association (SSTA) and SNP-trait association (STA). A total of 497 significant SNPs were identified, 489 by SSTA analysis and 43 by STA analysis. Markers identified by SSTA were located on all twelve chromosomes while those identified by STA were confined to chromosomes 2, 4, and 6. Eighteen of the significant SNPs were located within or in close proximity to folate metabolism-related genes. Forty two SNPs were identical between SSTA and STA analyses. These SNPs have potential to be used in marker-assisted selection for breeding high folate potato varieties."
https://openalex.org/W2792038173,"Diabetes mellitus is associated with sensory abnormalities, including exacerbated responses to painful (hyperalgesia) or non-painful (allodynia) stimuli. These abnormalities are symptoms of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), which is the most common complication that affects approximately 50% of diabetic patients. Yet, the underlying mechanisms linking hyperglycemia and symptoms of DPN remain poorly understood. The transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel plays a central role in such sensory abnormalities and shows elevated expression levels in animal models of diabetes. Here, we investigated the function of TRPV1 channels in sensory neurons cultured from the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) of neonatal mice, under control (5mM) and high glucose (25mM) conditions. After maintaining DRG neurons in high glucose for 1 week, we observed a significant increase in capsaicin (CAP)-evoked currents and CAP-evoked depolarizations, independent of TRPV1 channel expression. These functional changes were largely dependent on the expression of the receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE), calcium influx, cytoplasmic ROS accumulation, PKC, and Src kinase activity. Like cultured neurons from neonates, mature neurons from adult mice also displayed a similar potentiation of CAP-evoked currents in the high glucose condition. Taken together, our data demonstrate that under the diabetic condition, DRG neurons are directly affected by elevated levels of glucose, independent of vascular or glial signals, and dependent on RAGE expression. These early cellular and molecular changes to sensory neurons in vitro are potential mechanisms that might contribute to sensory abnormalities that can occur in the very early stages of diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2791036074,"Objective Although obesity is recognized as an important risk of mortality, how the amount and distribution of body fat affect mortality risk is unclear. Furthermore, whether fat distribution confers any additional risk of mortality in addition to fat amount is not understood. Methods This data linkage cohort study included 16415 participants (8554 females) aged 18 to 89 years from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (1988–1994) and its linked mortality data (31 December 2011). Cox proportional hazard models and parametric survival models were used to estimate the association between body fat percentage (BF%), based on bioelectrical impedance analysis, and waist-hip ratio (WHR) with mortality. Results A total of 4999 deaths occurred during 19-year follow-up. A U-shaped association between BF% and mortality was found in both sexes, with the adjusted hazard ratios for other groups between 1.02 (95% confidence interval: 0.89, 1.18) and 2.10 (1.47, 3.01) when BF% groups of 25–30% in males and 30–35% in females were used as references. A non-linear relationship between WHR and mortality was detected in males, with the adjusted hazard ratios among other groups ranging from 1.05 (0.94, 1.18) to 1.52 (1.15, 2.00) compared with the WHR category of 0.95–1.0. However in females, the death risk constantly increased across the WHR spectrum. Joint impact of BF% and WHR suggested males with BF% of 25–30% and WHR of 0.95–1.0 and females with BF% of 30–35% and WHR <0.9 were associated with the lowest mortality risk and longest survival age compared with their counterparts in other categories. Conclusions This study supported the use of body fat distribution in addition to fat amount in assessing the risk of all-cause mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2788624546,"The influence of the jaw position on postural control, body posture, walking and running pattern has been reported in the literature. All these movements have in common that a relatively small, but well controlled muscle activation is required. The induced effects on motor output through changed jaw positions have been small. Therefore, it has been questioned if it could still be observed in maximal muscle activation.Twenty-three healthy, mid age recreational runners (mean age = 34.0 ± 10.3 years) participated in this study. Three different jump tests (squat jump, counter movement jump, and drop jumps from four different heights) and three maximal strength tests (trunk flexion and extension, leg press of the right and left leg) were conducted. Four different dental occlusion conditions and an additional familiarization condition were tested. Subjects performed the tests on different days for which the four occlusion conditions were randomly changed.No familiarization effect was found. Occlusion conditions with a relaxation position and with a myocentric condylar position showed significantly higher values for several tests compared to the neutral condition and the maximal occlusion position. Significance was found in the squat jump, countermovement jump, the drop jump from 32cm and 40cm, trunk extension, leg press force and rate of force development. The effect due to the splint conditions is an improvement between 3% and 12% (min and max). No influence of the jaw position on symmetry or balance between extension and flexion muscle was found.An influence of occlusion splints on rate of force development (RFD) and maximal strength tests could be confirmed. A small, but consistent increase in the performance parameters could be measured. The influence of the occlusion condition is most likely small compared to other influences as for example training status, age, gender and circadian rhythm."
https://openalex.org/W2790911281,"The social environment can alter pubertal timing through neuroendocrine mechanisms that are not fully understood; it is thought that stress hormones (e.g., glucocorticoids or corticotropin-releasing hormone) influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis to inhibit puberty. Here, we use the eusocial naked mole-rat, a unique species in which social interactions in a colony (i.e. dominance of a breeding female) suppress puberty in subordinate animals. Removing subordinate naked mole-rats from this social context initiates puberty, allowing for experimental control of pubertal timing. The present study quantified gene expression for reproduction- and stress-relevant genes acting upstream of gonadotropin-releasing hormone in brain regions with reproductive and social functions in pre-pubertal, post-pubertal, and opposite sex-paired animals (which are in various stages of pubertal transition). Results indicate sex differences in patterns of neural gene expression. Known functions of genes in brain suggest stress as a key contributing factor in regulating male pubertal delay. Network analysis implicates neurokinin B (Tac3) in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus as a key node in this pathway. Results also suggest an unappreciated role for the nucleus accumbens in regulating puberty."
https://openalex.org/W2792429614,"Dietary triggers acting on a developing fetus can affect the functioning of the body in later life; this can be observed on various levels, including epigenetic modifications and gene expression. Early-life programmed changes may be transmitted to successive generations. In this study, the impact of prenatal restricted diet was studied in four generations of rats. We hypothesized that this diet can induce changes in the expression of major genes involved in two epigenetic mechanisms: DNA methylation and histone modifications. The transcript level of six genes involved in these processes (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, Mecp2, Hdac1, and Sin3a) was therefore determined in three tissues (liver, adipose, and muscle). This diet was found to have no effect on the F0 pregnant females. In the F1 progeny (fetuses at day 19 of pregnancy and 4-week-old rats) significant differences in the expression of the genes were observed mostly in the liver; in subsequent generations, we therefore studied only this tissue. Among the genes encoding DNA methyltransferases, significant changes were observed for Dnmt1 in the F1 animals from the restricted group, but these were no longer evident in F2 and F3. The Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b genes showed no differences in mRNA level in F1 fetuses. Concerning the transcript level of the Mecp2 gene only in F1 generation significant changes were found. For the histone modification genes, an increase in the expression of Hdac1 in fetus liver was found in F1 and F2, while its level decreased in F3. The abundance of the Sin3a transcript varied in all generations. It was also found that the mRNA levels of the studied genes correlated highly positive with each other, but only in fetuses from the F1 restricted group. The DNA methylation cell potential, defined as the ratio of SAM (S-adenosylmethionine) to SAH (S-adenosylhomocysteine), was measured in the liver, with no alterations being found in the restricted groups. Evaluation of global histone H3 acetylation showed that it underwent a significant increase in the fetal livers of F1, while during aging (four-week old animals) this difference was no longer maintained. A tendency of increased H3 acetylation in fetuses was also detected in F2 generation. In F1 fetuses from restricted group the increased H3 acetylation positively correlated with transcriptional status of the studied genes. Our results indicate that the prenatal restriction diet can affect the activity of genes involved in epigenetic mechanisms in the liver across generations. Moreover, this feeding type influenced the global histone H3 acetylation in fetal liver."
https://openalex.org/W2792343439,"The beneficial effects from exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) have been widely acknowledged. We assessed the effect of exclusive breastfeeding promotion by peer counsellors in Uganda and Burkina Faso, on cognitive abilities, social emotional development, school performance and linear growth among 5-8 years old children.Children in the PROMISE EBF trial (2006-2008) were re-enrolled in the follow-up PROMISE Saving Brains (SB) study (2013-2015). Caretaker interviews captured sociodemographic characteristics and social emotional development using the parent version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Overall cognition and working memory were assessed using the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, second edition (KABC2), cognitive flexibility was measured with the Child Category Test (CCT), and attention with the Test of Variables of Attention (T.O.V.A), while school performance was measured by a standardized test on arithmetic and reading. Country-pooled, age adjusted z-scores from each of the above outcomes were entered into a linear regression model controlling for confounders.The number of children re-enrolled in the intervention and control arms were: 274/396 (69.2%) and 256/369 (69.4%) in Uganda and 265/392 (67.6%) and 288/402 (71.6%) in Burkina Faso. Assessment of cognitive ability showed small and no significant differences, of which general cognition (z-scores, 95% CI) showed the largest mean difference: -0.17 (-0.40; 0.05). Social emotional symptoms were similar across arms. There were no differences in school performance or linear growth for age detected.Peer promotion for exclusive breastfeeding in Burkina Faso and Uganda was not associated with differences at 5-8 years of age in a range of measures of child development: cognitive abilities, emotion-behaviour-social symptoms or linear growth. This study from sub Saharan Africa did not reconfirm findings elsewhere that have shown an association between exclusive breastfeeding and cognitive performance. This might be due to a number of methodological limitations inherent in the current study. For example since the majority of the children were breastfed, the benefits of the intervention could have been diluted. Other factors such as the mental and HIV status of the mothers (which were not assessed in the current study) could have affected our results. Hence regarding the effect of exclusive breastfeeding on measures of child neurocognitive development in sub Saharan Africa, the jury is still out.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01882335."
https://openalex.org/W2793930761,"Gastric cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Accurate prediction of disease progression is difficult, and new biomarkers for clinical use are essential. Recently, we reported that the proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzyme UCHL5/Uch37 is a new prognostic marker in both rectal cancer and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Here, we have assessed by immunohistochemistry UCHL5 tumor expression in gastric cancer. The study cohort comprised 650 patients, who underwent surgery in Helsinki University Hospital, Finland, between 1983 and 2009. We investigated the association of cytoplasmic UCHL5 tumor expression to assess clinicopathological parameters and patient survival. Positive cytoplasmic UCHL5 tumor immunoexpression is linked to increased survival of patients with small (<5 cm) tumors (p = 0.001), disease stages I-II (p = 0.025), and age 66 years or older (p = 0.037). UCHL5 is thus a potential marker in gastric cancer with new prognostic relevance."
https://openalex.org/W2789458242,"Four full-sibling intact male Miniature Poodles were evaluated at 4–19 months of age. One was clinically normal and three were affected. All affected dogs were reluctant to exercise and had generalised muscle atrophy, a stiff gait and a markedly elevated serum creatine kinase activity. Two affected dogs also showed poor development, learning difficulties and episodes of abnormal behaviour. In these two dogs, investigations into forebrain structural and metabolic diseases were unremarkable; electromyography demonstrated fibrillation potentials and complex repetitive discharges in the infraspinatus, supraspinatus and epaxial muscles. Histopathological, immunohistochemical and immunoblotting analyses of muscle biopsies were consistent with dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy. DNA samples were obtained from all four full-sibling male Poodles, a healthy female littermate and the dam, which was clinically normal. Whole genome sequencing of one affected dog revealed a >5 Mb deletion on the X chromosome, encompassing the entire DMD gene. The exact deletion breakpoints could not be experimentally ascertained, but we confirmed that this region was deleted in all affected males, but not in the unaffected dogs. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction confirmed all three affected males were hemizygous for the mutant X chromosome, while the wildtype chromosome was observed in the unaffected male littermate. The female littermate and the dam were both heterozygous for the mutant chromosome. Forty-four Miniature Poodles from the general population were screened for the mutation and were homozygous for the wildtype chromosome. The finding represents a naturally-occurring mutation causing dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy in the dog."
https://openalex.org/W2792959062,"Large old trees are critically important keystone structures in forest ecosystems globally. Populations of these trees are also in rapid decline in many forest ecosystems, making it important to quantify the factors that influence their dynamics at different spatial scales. Large old trees often occur in forest landscapes also subject to fire and logging. However, the effects on the risk of collapse of large old trees of the amount of logging and fire in the surrounding landscape are not well understood. Using an 18-year study in the Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forests of the Central Highlands of Victoria, we quantify relationships between the probability of collapse of large old hollow-bearing trees at a site and the amount of logging and the amount of fire in the surrounding landscape. We found the probability of collapse increased with an increasing amount of logged forest in the surrounding landscape. It also increased with a greater amount of burned area in the surrounding landscape, particularly for trees in highly advanced stages of decay. The most likely explanation for elevated tree fall with an increasing amount of logged or burned areas in the surrounding landscape is change in wind movement patterns associated with cutblocks or burned areas. Previous studies show that large old hollow-bearing trees are already at high risk of collapse in our study area. New analyses presented here indicate that additional logging operations in the surrounding landscape will further elevate that risk. Current logging prescriptions require the protection of large old hollow-bearing trees on cutblocks. We suggest that efforts to reduce the probability of collapse of large old hollow-bearing trees on unlogged sites will demand careful landscape planning to limit the amount of timber harvesting in the surrounding landscape."
https://openalex.org/W2793291483,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of adult blindness. Retinal Müller cells maintain water homeostasis and potassium concentration via inwardly rectifying Kir4.1 channels. Accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) is a major pathologic event in DR. While diabetes leads to a decrease in the Kir4.1 channels, it remains unknown whether AGEs-linked to the basement membrane (BM) affect normal Kir4.1 channels. For this study, we hypothesized that AGE-modification of laminin is detrimental to Kir4.1 channels, therefore, disrupting Müller cell function. The AGE-modified laminin-coated substrates were prepared by incubating Petri-dishes with laminin and methylglyoxal for seven days. The rat Müller cells (rMC-1) were propagated on AGE-modified laminin, and Kir4.1 expression and function were evaluated. Quantification of AGEs using ELISA revealed a dose-dependent increase in methylglyoxal-hydro-imidazolone adducts. The rMC-1 propagated on AGE-modified laminin demonstrated a decrease in Kir4.1 levels in immunofluorescence and western blot studies and a decrease in the Kir4.1 channel function. Kir4.1 decrease on AGE-modified laminin resulted in a disorganization of an actin cytoskeleton and disruption of α-dystroglycan-syntrophin-dystrophin complexes. Our studies suggest that AGE-modification of laminin is detrimental to Kir4.1 channels. By studying the role of AGEs in Kir4.1 channels we have identified a novel mechanism of Müller cell dysfunction and its subsequent involvement in DR."
https://openalex.org/W2788010143,"Su(Hw) belongs to the class of proteins that organize chromosome architecture and boundaries/insulators between regulatory domains. This protein contains a cluster of 12 zinc finger domains most of which are responsible for binding to three different modules in the consensus site. Su(Hw) forms a complex with CP190 and Mod(mdg4)-67.2 proteins that binds to well-known Drosophila insulators. To understand how Su(Hw) performs its activities and binds to specific sites in chromatin, we have examined the previously described su(Hw)f mutation that disrupts the 10th zinc finger (ZF10) responsible for Su(Hw) binding to the upstream module. The results have shown that Su(Hw)f loses the ability to interact with CP190 in the absence of DNA. In contrast, complete deletion of ZF10 does not prevent the interaction between Su(Hw)Δ10 and CP190. Having studied insulator complex formation in different mutant backgrounds, we conclude that both association with CP190 and Mod(mdg4)-67.2 partners and proper organization of DNA binding site are essential for the efficient recruitment of the Su(Hw) complex to chromatin insulators."
https://openalex.org/W2790215865,"A prolonged increase in proinflammatory cytokines is associated with osteoporotic and autoimmune bone loss and, conversely, anti-inflammatory pathways are associated with protection against bone loss. Milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor (MFG-E)-8 is a glycoprotein that is proresolving, regulates apoptotic cell clearance, and has been linked to autoimmune disease and skeletal homeostasis. The role of MFG-E8 in the young vs. adult skeleton was determined in mice deficient in MFG-E8 (KO). In vivo, trabecular bone was similar in MFG-E8KO and wild-type (WT) mice at 6 and 16 wk, whereas 22 wk adult MFG-E8KO mice displayed significantly reduced trabecular BV/TV. The number of osteoclasts per bone surface was increased in 22-wk MFG-E8 KO vs. WT mice, and recombinant murine MFG-E8 decreased the number and size of osteoclasts in vitro. Adult MFG-E8KO spleen weight:body weight was increased compared with WT, and flow cytometric analysis showed significantly increased myeloid-derived suppressor cells (CD11bhiGR-1+) and neutrophils (CD11bhiLy6G+) in MFG-E8KO bone marrow, suggesting an inflammatory phenotype. PTH-treated MFG-E8KO mice showed a greater anabolic response (+124% BV/TV) than observed in PTH-treated WT mice (+64% BV/TV). These data give insight into the role of MFG-E8 in the adult skeleton and suggest that anabolic PTH may be a valuable therapeutic approach for autoimmune-associated skeletal disease.—Michalski, M.

https://openalex.org/W2790368985,"The biobased production of adipic acid, a precursor in the production of nylon, is of great interest in order to replace the current petrochemical production route. Glucose-rich lignocellulosic raw materials have high potential to replace the petrochemical raw material. A number of metabolic pathways have been proposed for the microbial conversion of glucose to adipic acid, but achieved yields and titers remain to be improved before industrial applications are feasible. One proposed pathway starts with lysine, an essential metabolite industrially produced from glucose by microorganisms. However, the drawback of this pathway is that several reactions are involved where there is no known efficient enzyme. By changing the order of the enzymatic reactions, we were able to identify an alternative pathway with one unknown enzyme less compared to the original pathway. One of the reactions lacking known enzymes is the reduction of the unsaturated α,β bond of 6-amino-trans-2-hexenoic acid and trans-2-hexenedioic acid. To identify the necessary enzymes, we selected N-ethylmaleimide reductase from Escherichia coli and Old Yellow Enzyme 1 from Saccharomyces pastorianus. Despite successful in silico docking studies, where both target substrates could fit in the enzyme pockets, and hydrogen bonds with catalytic residues of both enzymes were predicted, no in vitro activity was observed. We hypothesize that the lack of activity is due to a difference in electron withdrawing potential between the naturally reduced aldehyde and the carboxylate groups of our target substrates. Suggestions for protein engineering to induce the reactions are discussed, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of the two metabolic pathways from lysine. We have highlighted bottlenecks associated with the lysine pathways, and proposed ways of addressing them."
https://openalex.org/W2790452546,"This paper aims to reschedule online metro trains in delay scenarios. A graph representation and a mixed integer programming model are proposed to formulate the optimization problem. The solution approach is a two-stage optimization method. In the first stage, based on a proposed train state graph and system analysis, the primary and flow-on delays are specifically analyzed and identified with a critical path algorithm. For the second stage a hybrid genetic algorithm is designed to optimize the schedule, with the delay identification results as input. Then, based on the infrastructure data of Beijing Subway Line 4 of China, case studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the solution approach. The results show that the algorithm can quickly and accurately identify primary delays among different types of delays. The economic cost of energy consumption and total delay is considerably reduced (by more than 10% in each case). The computation time of the Hybrid-GA is low enough for rescheduling online. Sensitivity analyses further demonstrate that the proposed approach can be used as a decision-making support tool for operators."
https://openalex.org/W2789491932,"Objective Patients presenting with suspected urinary tract infection are common in every day emergency practice. Urine flow cytometry has replaced microscopic urine evaluation in many emergency departments, but interpretation of the results remains challenging. The aim of this study was to develop and validate tools that predict urine culture growth out of urine flow cytometry parameter. Methods This retrospective study included all adult patients that presented in a large emergency department between January and July 2017 with a suspected urinary tract infection and had a urine flow cytometry as well as a urine culture obtained. The objective was to identify urine flow cytometry parameters that reliably predict urine culture growth and mixed flora growth. The data set was split into a training (70%) and a validation set (30%) and different decision-making approaches were developed and validated. Results Relevant urine culture growth (respectively mixed flora growth) was found in 40.2% (7.2% respectively) of the 613 patients included. The number of leukocytes and bacteria in flow cytometry were highly associated with urine culture growth, but mixed flora growth could not be sufficiently predicted from the urine flow cytometry parameters. A decision tree, predictive value figures, a nomogram, and a cut-off table to predict urine culture growth from bacteria and leukocyte count were developed, validated and compared. Conclusions Urine flow cytometry parameters are insufficient to predict mixed flora growth. However, the prediction of urine culture growth based on bacteria and leukocyte count is highly accurate and the developed tools should be used as part of the decision-making process of ordering a urine culture or starting an antibiotic therapy if a urogenital infection is suspected."
https://openalex.org/W2788273222,"Social insect colonies function cohesively due, in part, to altruistic behaviors performed towards related individuals. These colonies can be affected by parasites in two distinct ways, either at the level of the individual or the entire colony. As such, colonies of social insects can experience conflict with infected individuals reducing the cohesiveness that typifies them. Parasites of social insects therefore offer us a framework to study conflicts within social insect colonies in addition to the traditionally viewed conflicts afforded by groups of low genetic relatedness due to multiple mating for example. In our study, we use the behavior manipulating fungal pathogen, Ophiocordyceps kimflemingiae (= unilateralis) and its host, Camponotus castaneus, to ask if colony members are able to detect infected individuals. Such detection would be optimal for the colony since infected workers die near foraging trails where the fungus develops its external structures and releases spores that infect other colony members. To determine if C. castaneus workers can detect these future threats, we used continuous-time point observations coupled with longer continuous observations to discern any discrimination towards infected individuals. After observing 1,240 hours of video footage we found that infected individuals are not removed from the colony and continuously received food during the course of fungal infection. We also calculated the distances between workers and the nest entrance in a total of 35,691 data points to find infected workers spent more time near the entrance of the nest. Taken together, these results suggest healthy individuals do not detect the parasite inside their nestmates. The colony's inability to detect infected individuals allows O. kimflemingiae to develop within the colony, while receiving food and protection from natural enemies, which could damage or kill its ant host before the parasite has completed its development."

Several leptospiral proteins that are upregulated during infection have been described, but their utility as a diagnostic marker is still unclear. In this study, we undertook a lipidomics approach to determine if there are any differences in the serum lipid profiles of horses naturally infected with pathogenic Leptospira spp. and horses vaccinated against a commercially available bacterin. Utilizing a high-resolution mass spectrometry serum lipidomics analytical platform, we demonstrate that cyclic phosphatidic acids, diacylglycerols, and hydroperoxide oxidation products of choline plasmalogens are elevated in the serum of naturally infected as well as vaccinated horses. Other lipids of interest were triacylglycerols that were only elevated in the serum of infected horses and sphingomyelins that were increased only in the serum of vaccinated horses. This is the first report looking at the equine serum lipidome during leptospiral infection and vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2793614094,"Identifying relationships between variables in ecological systems is challenging due to the large number of interacting factors. One system studied in detail is avian reproduction, where molecular analyses have revealed dramatic variation in rates of extra-pair paternity—the frequency with which broods contain individuals sired by different males. Despite the attention the topic has received, identification of ecological predictors of the observed variation remains elusive. In this study we evaluate how structural equation modeling—which allows for simultaneous estimation of covariation between all variables in a model—can help identify significant relationships between ecological variables and extra-pair paternity. We estimated the correlation of eight different variables using data from 36 species of passerines by including them in six different models of varying complexity. We recover strong support for species with lower rates of male care having higher rates of extra-pair paternity. Our results also suggest that testes size, range size, and longevity all potentially have a relationship with rates of extra-pair paternity; however, interpretation of this result is more challenging. More generally, these results demonstrate the utility of applying structural equation modeling to understanding correlations among interacting variables in complex biological systems."
https://openalex.org/W2791577274,"This study investigates the effects of toxic and non-toxic dinoflatellates on two sympatric bivalves, the clam Mulinia edulis and the mussel Mytilus chilensis. Groups of bivalves were fed one of three diets: (i) the toxic paralytic shellfish producing (PSP) Alexandrium catenella + Isochrysis galbana; (ii) the non-toxic Alexandrium affine + Isochrysis galbana and (iii) the control diet of Isochrysis galbana. Several physiological traits were measured, such as, clearance rate, pre-ingestive selection efficiency and particle transport velocity in the gill. The clearance rates of both M. chilensis and M. edulis showed a significant reduction when fed a mixed toxic diet of 50% Alexandrium catenella: 50% Isochrysis galbana. Similarly, when both species of bivalves were fed with the non-toxic diet (50% A. affine: 50% I. galbana), clearance rate was significantly lower compared with a diet of 100% I. galbana. Under all the experimental diets, M. chilensis showed higher clearance rate values, slightly more than double that of M. edulis. M. edulis and M. chilensis have the ability to select particles at the pre-ingestive level, thus eliminating a larger proportion of the toxic dinoflagellate A. catenella as well as the non-toxic A. affine in the form of pseudofaeces. Higher values of selection efficiency were registered in M. edulis than in M. chilensis when exposed to the toxic diet. Similar results were observed when these two species were exposed to the diet containing the non-toxic dinoflagellate, explained by the fact that the infaunal Mulinia edulis is adapted to dealing with larger particle sizes and higher particle densities (Navarro et al., 1993). The lower transport particle velocity observed in the present work for both species, is related to the reduced clearance rate, the higher particle concentration, and the presence of larger, toxic dinoflagellates. In addition, the species differ in their feeding responses to diets, with and without A. catenella or A. affine, largely reflecting their adaptations to different environmental conditions. The results suggest that the presence of a dinoflagellate bloom, whether toxic or non-toxic spp in Yaldad Bay, is likely to have a greater impact on the Mytilus chilensis than the infaunal Mulinia edulis, based on the combined effects on clearance rate, selection efficiency and particle transport velocity."
https://openalex.org/W2793407684,"An Acute Hypotensive Episode (AHE) is the sudden onset of a sustained period of low blood pressure and is one among the most critical conditions in Intensive Care Units (ICU). Without timely medical care, it can lead to an irreversible organ damage and death. By identifying patients at risk for AHE early, adequate medical intervention can save lives and improve patient outcomes. In this paper, we design a novel dual–boundary classification based approach for identifying patients at risk for AHE. Our algorithm uses only simple summary statistics of past Blood Pressure measurements and can be used in an online environment facilitating real–time updates and prediction. We perform extensive experiments with more than 4,500 patient records and demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous best approaches of AHE prediction. Our method can identify AHE patients two hours in advance of the onset, giving sufficient time for appropriate clinical intervention with nearly 80% sensitivity and at 95% specificity, thus having very few false positives."

Methods In this longitudinal study two pharmacists in each of three community pharmacies were trained to perform risk assessments, HbA1c-measurements and counselling. Pharmacy customers who were > 18 years old and could understand and speak Norwegian or English were recruited in the pharmacies during a two-months-period. Information about the service was presented in local newspapers, social media, leaflets and posters at the pharmacy. Customers wishing to participate contacted the pharmacy staff. Participants completed a validated diabetes risk test and a background questionnaire including a validated instrument for self-rated health. A HbA1c measurement was performed for individuals with a moderate to high risk of developing diabetes. If HbA1c ≥ 6.5% they were recommended to visit their general practitioner for follow-up. The pharmacies performed internal and external quality control of the HbA1c instrument. Results Of the 211 included participants 97 (46%) were > 50 years old. HbA1c was measured for the 47 participants (22%) with high risk. Thirty-two (15%) had HbA1c values < 5.7%, twelve (5.4%) had values between 5.7%—6.4%, and three (1.4%) had an HbA1c ≥ 6.5%. Two participants with HbA1 ≥ 6.5% were diagnosed with diabetes by their general practitioner. The third was lost to follow-up. Results from internal and external quality control for HbA1c were within set limits. Conclusion The pharmacists were able to perform the risk assessment and measurement of HbA1c, and pharmacy customers were willing to participate. The HbA1c measurements fulfilled the requirements for analytical quality. Thus, it is feasible to implement this service in community pharmacies in Norway. In a large-scale study the inclusion criteria should be increased to 45 years in accordance with the population the risk test has been validated for."

Ratios of mtDNA4977 to total-mtDNA and total-mtDNA to nuclear-DNA were calculated. Nested PCR and Sanger sequencing were used to confirm undetectable levels of mtDNA4977.For 191 patients and 74 control subjects in the male group and 92 patients and 61 control subjects in the female group, there were no significant between-group differences in age, cholesterol level, body mass index, stroke severity, or 4977 deletion. After adjusting for confounding factors, there was no correlation between mtDNA4977 amount and infarction risk, recurrent stroke, or stroke severity. However, mtDNA4977 was undetected in 6.94% subjects, and these individuals had a higher prevalence of stroke than those with detectable mtDNA4977 (OR: 0.181, 95% CI 0.041-0.798, p = 0.024). Additionally, mtDNA4977 status had no effect on stroke prognosis, including stroke severity and recurrent stroke.In conclusion, there was no apparent association between mtDNA4977 deletion and cerebral infarction.

https://openalex.org/W2792686031,"Objective Patients usually receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation during ventilatory expiration and with their arms down, which does not reflect the normal imaging position. This study used scout images from low-dose chest computed tomography to compare the locations of the left ventricle (LV) in the expiration with arms down position (EAD) and in the full inspirational with arms raised position (IAR). Methods This cross-sectional study used a convenience sample and evaluated scout images that were obtained during screening with the participants in the EAD and IAR positions. The effective compression point was defined as being on the sternum above the longest anteroposterior diameter (APD) of the LV (using axial computed tomography images). The sternum was divided into three parts and the heart’s position was evaluated on the EAD and the IAR images, and the distance from the xiphoid process to the LV’s sternum landmark (XLVD) was measured. We also examined the compressible organs during CPR based on the EAD and IAR images. Results We enrolled 127 participants. The LVs were located in the middle of the sternum at EAD for 117 participants (92%) and in the lower half of the sternum at IAR for 107 participants (84%). The mean XLVD was significantly different between the EAD and IAR positions (mean: 85 ± 21 mm vs. 33 ± 17 mm, respectively). The liver’s left lobe was located in the lower half of the sternum at EAD for 118 participants (93%). Conclusions These findings indicate that the location of the LV during cardiopulmonary resuscitation might be in the middle of the sternum if the patient is treated in the EAD position."
https://openalex.org/W2791278081,"Introduction There is growing recognition in the health community that the legal environment—including laws, policies, and related procedures—impacts vulnerability to HIV and access to HIV-related services both positively and negatively. Assessing changes in the legal environment and how these affect HIV-related outcomes, however, is challenging, and understanding of appropriate methodologies nascent. Methods We conducted an evaluation of a UNDP project designed to strengthen legal environments to support the human rights of key populations, in particular LGBT populations, women and girls, affected by HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. We analyzed data on activities designed to improve legal environments through a systematic document review and 53 qualitative interviews. Results The project made substantial strides towards legal change in many places, and examples provide broader lessons for work in this area. Two core pillars appear fundamental: a government-led participatory assessment of the legal environment, and building the capacity of those impacted by and engaged in this work. Systematic attention to human rights is vital: it can help open new spaces for dialogue among diverse stakeholders, foster new collaborations, and ensure local ownership, nuanced understanding of the political landscape, attention to marginalized populations, and accountability for (in)action. Entry points for effecting legal change go beyond “HIV laws” to also include other laws, national policies and strategies. Conclusion Conducting legal environment assessments, multi-stakeholder dialogues, action planning and related activities, alongside capacity building, can contribute to changes in knowledge and attitudes directly relevant to reforming laws that are found to be harmful. Shorter-term goals along the causal pathway to legal change (e.g. changes in policy) can constitute interim markers of success, and recognition of these can maintain momentum. Increasing understanding of progress towards changes in the legal environment that can positively affect HIV-related outcomes is important in working to improve the health and lives of people living with HIV."
https://openalex.org/W2792772503,"LC16m8 (m8), a highly attenuated vaccinia virus (VAC) strain, was developed as a smallpox vaccine, and its safety and immunogenicity have been confirmed. Here, we aimed to develop a system that recovers infectious m8 from a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) that retains the full-length viral genomic DNA (m8-BAC system). The infectious virus was successfully recovered from a VAC-BAC plasmid, named pLC16m8-BAC. Furthermore, the bacterial replicon-free virus was generated by intramolecular homologous recombination and was successfully recovered from a modified VAC-BAC plasmid, named pLC16m8.8S-BAC. Also, the growth of the recovered virus was indistinguishable from that of authentic m8. The full genome sequence of the plasmid, which harbors identical inverted terminal repeats (ITR) to that of authentic m8, was determined by long-read next-generation sequencing (NGS). The ITR contains x 18 to 32 of the 70 and x 30 to 45 of 54 base pair tandem repeats, and the number of tandem repeats was different between the ITR left and right. Since the virus recovered from pLC16m8.8S-BAC was expected to retain the identical viral genome to that of m8, including the ITR, a reference-based alignment following a short-read NGS was performed to validate the sequence of the recovered virus. Based on the pattern of coverage depth in the ITR, no remarkable differences were observed between the virus and m8, and the other region was confirmed to be identical as well. In summary, this new system can recover the virus, which is geno- and phenotypically indistinguishable from authentic m8."
https://openalex.org/W2793824503,"Advances in light shaping techniques are leading to new tools for optical trapping and micromanipulation. For example, optical tweezers made from Laguerre-Gaussian or donut beams display an increased axial trap strength and can impart angular momentum to rotate a specimen. However, the application of donut beam optical tweezers to precision, biophysical measurements remains limited due to a lack of methods for calibrating such devices sufficiently. For instance, one notable complication, not present when trapping with a Gaussian beam, is that the polarization of the trap light can significantly affect the tweezers' strength as well as the location of the trap. In this article, we show how to precisely calibrate the axial trap strength as a function of height above the coverslip surface while accounting for focal shifts in the trap position arising from radiation pressure, mismatches in the index of refraction, and polarization induced intensity variations. This provides a foundation for implementing a donut beam optical tweezers capable of applying precise axial forces."
https://openalex.org/W2789579643,"The current study aimed to examine the reproducibility of estimated peak power and estimated pedal velocity in a multi-trial 10-s all-out cycling test among adult athletes (n = 22; aged 23.50±4.73 years). Stature, sitting height and body mass were measured. Leg length was estimated as stature minus sitting height. Body volume was obtained from air displacement plethysmography and was subsequently used to calculate body density. Fat mass and fat-free mass were derived. The short-term power outputs were assessed from the force-velocity test (FVT), using a friction-braked ergometer on two separated occasions. Differences between repeated measurements were examined with paired t-test and effect sizes calculated. No significant differences were found between session 1 (898 W, 142 rpm) and session 2 (906 W, 142 rpm). Test-retest procedure showed acceptable reliability for estimated peak power output [technical error of measurement (TEM) = 31.9 W; % coefficient of variation (CV) = 3.5; intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.986] and pedal velocity (TEM = 5.4 rpm, %CV = 3.8, ICC = 0.924). The current study demonstrated a reasonable reproducibility of estimated peak power and pedal velocity outputs in non-elite male athletes and supports that a familiarization session including a complete FVT protocol is not required."
