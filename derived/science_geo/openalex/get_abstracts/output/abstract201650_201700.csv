https://openalex.org/W1520621428,"The neuron doctrine, which we chiefly owe to Cajal (1), was unquestionably a giant stride forward in the understanding of the substratum of nervous function. It forms the basis of all modem work on the nervous system. It asserts that the nerve cell and its processes, together called the neuron, form the cellular units of the nervous system which are directly involved in nervous function; that all nerve fibers are neuronal processes; that the neuron and all its extensions develop embryologically from a single neuroblast; and that the neuron is a trophic unit, all its processes being dependent upon the nucleated cell body for their maintenance and regeneration. Although this is not inherent in the original anatomical concept, the neuron has classically come to be regarded as a functional unit, and it is here that newer information forces a reappraisal."

Similarly, finely divided powder and chlorophyll extracts of green plants, when illuminated in an environment of oxygen and water, will yield small quantities of carbon monoxide as well as certain aldehydes. The component of the light spectrum which is absorbed in photosynthesis (480 to 680 mmicro) was found to be responsible for the CO and aldehyde phenomena."

Similarly, histidine and one of its analogs inhibit the action of an enzyme essential for histidine biosynthesis. A mutant resistant to the histidine analog produces an apparently altered enzyme which is insensitive to both the analog and histidine."

https://openalex.org/W2032521778,"LYMPHOCYTIC neoplasms with characteristic thymic involvement occur spontaneously with high frequency in certain strains of mice1, and in other strains following X-irradiation2, chemical carcinogens3 or the inoculation at birth of cell-free extracts of leukæmic tissue from high leukæmic strain mice4. Total thymectomy has been shown to reduce markedly the incidence of the disease, either spontaneous1 or induced2,3. No report has yet appeared as to the effect of subsequent thymectomy on the occurrence of the disease in mice inoculated at birth with leukæmia extracts. Harris5 has, however, an interesting theory which suggests that non-cellular leukæmic-inducing extracts might be capable of replacing thymic influence. Latarjet et al. 6 and Furth et al. 7 have shown that inoculation of Ak leukæmic cell-free extracts into newborn Ak mice accelerates the development of leukæmia. The effect of thymectomy on this acceleration has been investigated and reported here."

https://openalex.org/W2084397164,In cats bilateral sympathectomy or administration of reserpine results in a marked reduction in concentration of myocardial catecholamines. The contractility of papillary muscles from such animals is significantly less than that of muscles from untreated animals. These findings demonstrate the importance of normal levels of myocardial catecholamines in the maintenance of normal cardiac contractility.

https://openalex.org/W2026004064,"During the past few years there has been a considerable amount of confusion with respect to the terminology used for adrenocorticotropins (ACTH) isolated from the pituitary glands of various species. In this paper (1) a unified system of nomenclature for these hormones is proposed. It is hoped that this system will furnish readily and at a glance, from the terminology itself, pertinent information about the source of the particular preparation as well as the chemical formula of any active degraded product derived from the natural hormone."

https://openalex.org/W1984946142,"Deterioration of paper in the book stock-especially among books of recent decades-has become a serious problem for libraries, but exact measures of the extent or rate of this deterioration have not been available. By the same token, no good indications have been available of the expected useful life of paper in books currently coming off the press. Furthermore, although attention has been given to means of counteracting one of the recognized causes of deterioration-pollutants absorbed from the atmosphere-similar attention has not been given to the problems of identifying and counteracting the other recognized source of deterioration-agents left in or introduced into the paper at the time of manufacture. Our investigation was undertaken in an attempt to fill some of these gaps in our knowledge. It has been found that modern books-even those written with a serious or scholarly purpose (""nonfiction"") and published (""to last!"") in hard bindings-are deteriorating rapidly, and many of those issued 25 to 50 years ago are now almost unusable. The paper of an average American publication of the first decade of this century retains only 4 percent of the folding endurance of a typical new book paper of today; even the paper in the average publication of the 1940's has already declined in folding endurance to 36 percent of today's new book paper. Meanwhile this typical new book paper itself shows low initial strength (for example, folding endurance on the order of only 20 percent of that of book papers already 200 to 500 years old) as well as indications that it is subject to rapid deterioration. Acidity appears to be the principal cause of deterioration, both in the older papers and the new. A stabilizing process for neutralizing this acidity was developed and was brought during the investigation to an initial stage of economic feasibility. This process appears to inactivate the most injurious properties found in new book papers and precipitates compounds into the fibers which should, in addition, counteract the effect of pollutants absorbed from the air. A principal technique used for predicting the durability of paper is the accelerated aging procedure developed by the National Bureau of Standards; by extending the use of this technique, interesting decay curves have been obtained which facilitate comparison of modern papers with papers which have already demonstrated their stability for several centuries. These curves offer other values as well for the study of permanence in paper and suggest that a principle exists relating extended accelerated aging to even longer periods of natural aging than those with which it has hitherto been equated. During the past 300 years the papermaker has done an excellent job in meeting the demand for more and cheaper paper. A by-product of this accomplishment has been the production of many weak and unstable papers. This does not give rise to any problem where strength or stability are not critical, but where permanence is important, as in libraries of record, the problem becomes serious. While the present study describes a procedure for stabilizing initially unstable paper, much more remains to be done if relatively stable papers are to be made for books of lasting value. There is evidence that this is possible-that such papers can be made from certain types of chemical wood fibers at but little additional cost. But more research is needed, and the cooperation of the scientist, papermaker, printer, publisher, and librarian will be required to assure permanent books for the future."

https://openalex.org/W2045034830,One mating type of the yeast Hansenula wingei possesses a specific protein on its cell surface which is complementary to a specific polysaccharide on the cell surface of the opposite mating type. The initial phase of mating in which cells of opposite types combine is therefore analogous to a reaction between an antibody and a polysaccharide antigen.

https://openalex.org/W165114174,"Sources of Compounds Tested-Thiamine hydrochloride (Merck, U.S.P. grade), 0-acetylthiamine hydrochloride and oxythiamine dihydrochloride (California Foundation for Biochemical Research), pyrithiamine hydrobromide and 4-amino-5 aminomethyl-a-methyl pyrimidine dihydrochloride (Nutritional Biochemicals Corporation) were all used without further purification. For determination of pK, values, the 4-amino-5-aminomethyl-2-methyl pyrimidine dihydrochloride was recrystallized from ethanol and ether until it gave the theoretical end point when titrated with base. 5-(2-Hydroxyethyl)I-methyl thiazole was redistilled from pooled commercial products of Merck’ and du Pont. The boiling point was lo%‘, 0.8 mm. Infrared inspection of the redistilled product showed the loss of a strong carbonyl peak which was originally present. The purified product was stored in a desiccator at -20” to hinder oxidation. Salts of 5-(d-Hydroxyethyl)-4-methyl Thiazole-The method of Clarke (6) was employed to prepare the 3-methyl and 3-benzyl (7) and the 3-o-, m-, and p-nitrobenzyl (8) salts. The 3-cr-methylbenzyl salt was prepared by dissolving 0.04 mole each of oc-bromoethyl benzene (Eastman, redistilled 89”, 15 mm.) and 5-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methyl thiazole in 4 ml. of thiophene-free anhydrous benzene in a stoppered 18 x 150-mm. test tube. The solution was heated overnight at 55”. The amethylbenzyl salt separates as a light yellow syrup. Attempts to crystallize this compound from a number of solvent systems were all unsuccessful. During crystallization attempts in hot absolute ethanol the salt was partially solvolyzed to the pyrimidylmethyl ethyl ether and 5-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methyl thiazole hydrobromide. The absorption spectra in both acid and base and the titration behavior very closely paralleled those of the 3-benzyl salt. These properties plus the method of preparation leave little doubt as to the character of the product. The 3-cyanomethyl salt was prepared in a similar manner from chloroacetonitrile (Eastman white label, redistilled 24O, 27 mm.) and 5-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methyl thiazole. The solution was heated at 80’ for 3 days, the benzene supernatant was discarded,"

https://openalex.org/W2013919594,"The paradoxical features of transplantation specificity-its strict genetic control in transfers of tissue from strain to strain as compared with its malleability on tissue passage in foreign immunological environments where the host does not reject the implant (F(1) hybrid passage, tolerance actively acquired by immature hosts, and so on)-present a challenge to genetic interpretation. The attempt is made in this article to show parallels between this behavior and such changes as the transformation of serotypes in Paramecium, in which the activity of genetic units becomes fixed as a cytoplasmic state-a cellular heredity persistent under specified environmental conditions but capable of change to an alternative state-while the genetic structure of the cell remains constant. The reactions appear to differ from those in the Paramecium case in that the diverse loci control a mosaic of different specificities, which change relatively independently of each other, in contrast to mutual exclusion of cytoplasmic states influenced by the different loci in Paramecium. The process of antibody formation is considered as a change in cellular phenotype from the same point of view. The primary response in the stem cells of the lymphoid tissues is interpretable as the establishment of a new cytoplasmic state in response to a nuclear stimulus by the foreign antigen. For the secondary response, the suggestion is made that a reaction of antigen with cellular antibody at the surface of stem cells exhibiting the primary response serves as the stimulus for specific proliferation of antibody-forming clones of cells. A parallel is drawn with the fertilization reaction, specifically with regard to the initiation of cleavage in eggs by antisera to them. Finally, a general chromosomal mechanism is sought for these phenomena, on the basis of activities of specific chromosome regions in response to special developmental stimuli, such as the disproportionate local synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid demonstrated in the giant chromosomes of the Diptera. By a correlation of such activities with the nucleocytoplasmic system of ribonucleic acid granules on membranes, a possible mechanism appears for the formation, in response to environmental stimuli, of cytoplasmic states which might supply the persistent pattern required for this type of cell heredity. The analogies made, it is believed, provide a framework for the design of test experiments."

https://openalex.org/W2067156531,The number of cells that remain free in the presence of agglutinin is usually much larger than the number of inagglutinable cells. The true inagglutinable proportion can be found by successive agglutinations of a labeled population in the presence of unlabeled carrier cells. By this means it is shown that group A persons possess non-A erythrocytes in proportions of the order of 10(-3).
