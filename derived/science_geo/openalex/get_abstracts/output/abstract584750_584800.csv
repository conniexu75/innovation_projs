https://openalex.org/W2606840533,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) provides a constant homeostatic brain environment that is essential for proper neural function. An unusually low rate of vesicular transport (transcytosis) has been identified as one of the two unique properties of CNS endothelial cells, relative to peripheral endothelial cells, that maintain the restrictive quality of the BBB. However, it is not known how this low rate of transcytosis is achieved. Here we provide a mechanism whereby the regulation of CNS endothelial cell lipid composition specifically inhibits the caveolae-mediated transcytotic route readily used in the periphery. An unbiased lipidomic analysis reveals significant differences in endothelial cell lipid signatures from the CNS and periphery, which underlie a suppression of caveolae vesicle formation and trafficking in brain endothelial cells. Furthermore, lipids transported by Mfsd2a establish a unique lipid environment that inhibits caveolae vesicle formation in CNS endothelial cells to suppress transcytosis and ensure BBB integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2606086658,"Abstract Structural rearrangements have long been recognized as an important source of genetic variation, with implications in phenotypic diversity and disease, yet their detailed evolutionary dynamics remain elusive. Here we use long-read sequencing to generate end-to-end genome assemblies for 12 strains representing major subpopulations of the partially domesticated yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its wild relative Saccharomyces paradoxus . These population-level high-quality genomes with comprehensive annotation enable precise definition of chromosomal boundaries between cores and subtelomeres and a high-resolution view of evolutionary genome dynamics. In chromosomal cores, S. paradoxus shows faster accumulation of balanced rearrangements (inversions, reciprocal translocations and transpositions), whereas S. cerevisiae accumulates unbalanced rearrangements (novel insertions, deletions and duplications) more rapidly. In subtelomeres, both species show extensive interchromosomal reshuffling, with a higher tempo in S. cerevisiae . Such striking contrasts between wild and domesticated yeasts are likely to reflect the influence of human activities on structural genome evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2605612340,"Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is an important staple food crop in Africa and South America; however, ubiquitous deleterious mutations may severely decrease its fitness. To evaluate these deleterious mutations, we constructed a cassava haplotype map through deep sequencing 241 diverse accessions and identified >28 million segregating variants. We found that (i) although domestication has modified starch and ketone metabolism pathways to allow for human consumption, the concomitant bottleneck and clonal propagation have resulted in a large proportion of fixed deleterious amino acid changes, increased the number of deleterious alleles by 26%, and shifted the mutational burden toward common variants; (ii) deleterious mutations have been ineffectively purged, owing to limited recombination in the cassava genome; (iii) recent breeding efforts have maintained yield by masking the most damaging recessive mutations in the heterozygous state but have been unable to purge the mutation burden; such purging should be a key target in future cassava breeding."
https://openalex.org/W2605631262,"The lack of tools to identify causative variants from sequencing data greatly limits the promise of precision medicine. Previous studies suggest that one-third of disease-associated alleles alter splicing. We discovered that the alleles causing splicing defects cluster in disease-associated genes (for example, haploinsufficient genes). We analyzed 4,964 published disease-causing exonic mutations using a massively parallel splicing assay (MaPSy), which showed an 81% concordance rate with splicing in patient tissue. Approximately 10% of exonic mutations altered splicing, mostly by disrupting multiple stages of spliceosome assembly. We present a large-scale characterization of exonic splicing mutations using a new technology that facilitates variant classification and keeps pace with variant discovery."

Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) have important nutritional and biological activities that guide the development of the immune system of the infant and shape the composition of normal gut microbiota. In this manner, HMOs help protect against pathogen colonization and reduce the risk of infection. In the course of our studies of HMO-microbial interactions, we unexpectedly uncovered a novel HMO property to directly inhibit the growth of GBS independent of host immunity. By separating different HMO fractions through multidimensional chromatography, we found the bacteriostatic activity to be confined to specific non-sialylated HMOs and synergistic with a number of conventional antibiotic agents. Phenotypic screening of a GBS transposon insertion library identified a mutation within a GBS-specific gene encoding a putative glycosyltransferase that confers resistance to HMOs, suggesting that HMOs may function as an alternative substrate to modify a GBS component in a manner that impairs growth kinetics. Our study uncovers a unique antibacterial role for HMOs against a leading neonatal pathogen and expands the potential therapeutic utility of these versatile molecules.

As such, oxygen deprivation (hypoxia) limits cholesterol synthesis through incompletely understood mechanisms mediated by the oxygen-sensitive transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α). We show here that HIF-1α links pathways for oxygen sensing and feedback control of cholesterol synthesis in human fibroblasts by directly activating transcription of the INSIG-2 gene.

Moreover, pharmacologic stabilization of HIF-1α in the liver stimulated HMGCR degradation via a reaction that requires the protein's prior ubiquitination and the presence of the Insig-2 protein. In summary, our results show that HIF-1α activates INSIG-2 transcription, leading to accumulation of Insig-2 protein, which binds to HMGCR and triggers its accelerated ubiquitination and degradation.

We therefore sought to investigate the expression and functional relevance of MS channels in human platelets. The effect of shear stress on Ca2+ entry in human platelets and Meg-01 megakaryocytic cells loaded with Fluo-3 was examined by confocal microscopy. Cells were attached to glass coverslips within flow chambers that allowed applications of physiological and pathological shear stress. Arterial shear (1002.6 s−1) induced a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i in Meg-01 cells and enhanced the frequency of repetitive Ca2+ transients by 80% in platelets. These Ca2+ increases were abrogated by the MS channel inhibitor Grammostola spatulata mechanotoxin 4 (GsMTx-4) or by chelation of extracellular Ca2+. Thrombus formation was studied on collagen-coated surfaces using DiOC6-stained platelets. In addition, [Ca2+]i and functional responses of washed platelet suspensions were studied with Fura-2 and light transmission aggregometry, respectively. Thrombus size was reduced 50% by GsMTx-4, independently of P2X1 receptors. In contrast, GsMTx-4 had no effect on collagen-induced aggregation or on Ca2+ influx via TRPC6 or Orai1 channels and caused only a minor inhibition of P2X1-dependent Ca2+ entry. The Piezo1 agonist, Yoda1, potentiated shear-dependent platelet Ca2+ transients by 170%. Piezo1 mRNA transcripts and protein were detected with quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively, in both platelets and Meg-01 cells.

Platelet activation plays a crucial role in the physiological process of hemostasis but is also the key precipitating event leading to arterial thrombosis and thus potentially life threatening pathological events such as myocardial infarction or stroke. In the circulation, shear stress exerted by laminar flow of blood is regarded as a vital environmental factor during platelet activation in both normal and pathological situations. For example, shear stress is required at the early stages of the hemostatic machinery where it unfolds von Willebrand factor to reveal the binding domains to glycoprotein Ib and thus allow attachment to collagen exposed at an injury site (1Schneider S.W. Nuschele S. Wixforth A. Gorzelanny C. Alexander-Katz A. Netz R.R. Schneider M.F. Shear-induced unfolding triggers adhesion of von Willebrand factor fibers.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7899-7903Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Ion channels have important roles in regulating physiological responses of all cells by controlling transmembrane ionic fluxes. In particular, an increase in [Ca2+]i is a pivotal signaling event that is essential for most major functional responses during platelet activation, including cytoskeletal rearrangements and integrin inside-out signaling (2Li Z.

Platelet proteomic and transcriptomic studies also indicate Piezo1 expression in human platelets (6Boyanova D. Nilla S. Birschmann I. Dandekar T. Dittrich M.

In the present study, we provide evidence that human platelets and a megakaryocytic cell line express MS Piezo1 ion channels. A novel in vitro approach was developed, using PECAM-1 antibodies, to adhere platelets to glass slides without inducing spontaneous activation and thereby permit the study of shear-induced Ca2+ responses. Arterial shear stress stimulated GsMTx-4-sensitive Ca2+ entry in platelets and Meg-01 cells, providing evidence that they exhibit MS cation channel activity. GsMTx-4 also inhibited thrombus formation under flow, demonstrating a potential role for MS ion channels in platelet function. The stimulation of Ca2+ responses by Yoda1 in both Meg-01 cells and platelets together with mRNA and protein expression studies provide evidence that the MS cation channel Piezo1 contributes to the shear-dependent events observed. Meg-01 cells express several platelet lineage surface markers and have been used as a model for studies of signaling in megakaryocytes and platelets (4Mahaut-Smith M.P.

Establishment of a novel human megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line, MEG-01, with positive Philadelphia chromosome.Blood. 1985; 66: 1384-1392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the effect of applied shear stress on [Ca2+]i in this megakaryoblastic cell line as a first step to address our hypothesis that MS cation channels contribute to platelet responses. When Ca2+-containing saline was applied at increasing arterial shear rates to Meg-01 cells attached to a glass coverslip, increases in the Fluo-3 signal were observed of a magnitude that correlated with the size of the shear force applied (Fig. 1, A and B, top panels): F/F0 increased from 1.0 ± 0.1 at no shear (0.0 s−1) to 1.1 ± 0.2, 1.2 ± 0.3, and 1.4 ± 0.4 at normal arterial (1002.6 s−1), stenotic (low) (2282.7 s−1), and stenotic (high) (3989.3 s−1) shear rates, respectively (Fig. 1C). In the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (0 Ca2+, 1 mm EGTA saline) shear-dependent increases in the Fluo-3 signal were abolished except for a small, residual response (F/F0 = 1.2 ± 0.2) at the highest flow rate (Fig. 1, A and B, middle panels, and D). Pretreating the attached Meg-01 cells with 2.5 μm GsMTx-4 abolished all increases in Fluo-3 signal in response to applied shear stress (Fig. 1, A and B, bottom panels, and D). We also compared the effect of shear flow in parallel-plate flow chambers on [Ca2+]i in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, which are known to express functional Piezo1 channels (14Li J. Hou B.

We therefore used an antibody against the receptor PECAM-1, which is inhibitory to platelet function, to immobilize these cells on glass slides. PECAM-1 normally plays a role in homophilic interactions between Ig domains 1 and 2 of the molecules on nearby platelets (22Sun Q.H. DeLisser H.M. Zukowski M.M. Paddock C. Albelda S.M. Newman P.J.

PECAM-1 antibody used in this assay (clone WM59) binds to Ig domains 1 and 2, hence inhibiting homophilic binding between platelets. It therefore provides a coat onto which platelets can attach and become immobilized without being activated by the glass surface (23Jones C.I. Moraes L.A. Gibbins J.M.

Exposure of attached unstimulated platelets to normal arterial shear stress (1002.6 s−1) resulted in multiple transient increases in cytosolic Ca2+ after a delay of 1–2 min (Fig. 2, B and C). Subsequent arrest of flow led to a reduction but not complete inhibition of this Ca2+ response, although a second application of arterial shear caused a further increase in the number of Ca2+ transients (Fig. 2C, panel i). The Ca2+ responses were quantified using the F/F0 integral for a total of 4 min (F/F0·4 min, in arbitrary units). Prior to the application of flow, when only occasional Ca2+ transients were observed, this value was 0.4 ± 0.6; during normal arterial shear it increased significantly to 1.9 ± 1.9 (Fig. 2D). In every platelet sample, a proportion of attached platelets did not show increased Ca2+ transients in response to arterial shear. However, in the platelets that did respond, the F/F0 integrals during a first and second exposure to either arterial or stenotic shear were not significantly different (Fig. 2, E and G). This allowed the effects of GsMTx-4 and removal of Ca2+ to be assessed during the second cycle of shear. The shear-induced Ca2+ transients were significantly reduced by either the addition of 2.5 μm GsMTx-4 (F/F0·4 min value of 0.6 ± 0.6, which is 31.8% of control, i.e. 1.9 ± 1.9) or removal of extracellular Ca2+ (F/F0·4 min value of 0.7 ± 0.6, which is 38.5% of control) (Fig. 2, C, panels ii and iii, and D). A higher arterial shear (3989.3 s−1), equivalent to the situation when stenosis or narrowing occurs in the arteries, induced a larger and more significant increase (F/F0·4 min value of 2.1 ± 2.1, n = 38, p < 0.0001) above prestimulus (no flow) levels when compared with normal arterial shear (Fig. 2F) and was also inhibited by GsMTx-4 (F/F0·4 min value of 0.6 ± 0.4, which is 28.6% of control, i.e. 2.1 ± 2.1, n = 13, p < 0.05). Together, these results suggest that platelets, like Meg-01 cells, possess a MS Ca2+ influx pathway induced by physiological levels of shear. The major difference between the response in these two cell types was the longer delay between stimulus application and the [Ca2+]i increase in platelets compared with Meg-01 cells. This may result from the greater rigidity of platelet surface membranes, a consequence of the extensive cortical cytoskeleton that will resist deformation and thus activation of MS ion channels (25Mahaut-Smith M.P. Patch-clamp recordings of electrophysiological events in the platelet and megakaryocyte.Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 273: 277-300PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hartwig J. Italiano Jr., J. The birth of the platelet.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 1: 1580-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Pretreating whole blood with GsMTx-4 for 30 s consistently resulted in a marked reduction in thrombus formation under arterial flow on a collagen surface (Fig. 3A). All three aspects of thrombus dimension analyzed (height, volume, and surface coverage) were reduced compared with control conditions; mean thrombus height to 52% of control (1.2 ± 0.5 to 0.6 ± 0.4 μm), mean thrombus volume to 52% of control (48,133 ± 18,957 to 25,126 ± 15,759 μm3), and mean surface coverage to 62% of control (26.4 ± 10.2 to 16.3 ± 8.6%) (Fig. 3B). In contrast, GsMTx-4 had no effect on the aggregation response of platelets to 1 μg/ml collagen measured in stirred suspensions, which induce minimal levels of shear (Fig. 3C). This response depends upon activation of the αIIbβ3 integrin (27King S. Short M. Harmon C. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors: the resurgence of tirofiban.Vascul. Pharmacol. 2016; 78: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), as demonstrated by the effect of the inhibitor integrilin (Fig. 3C). Together, these data suggest that the underlying GsMTx-4-sensitive pathway is crucially dependent upon application of shear stress for its activation. GsMTx-4 is widely used as an inhibitor of MS ion channels; however, its effects on well established platelet Ca2+ entry pathways are unknown. Store-operated Ca2+ entry through Orai1 channels is a major Ca2+ entry pathway evoked by multiple agonists and can be selectively activated by depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores with the SERCA inhibitor thapsigargin (3Varga-Szabo D. Braun A. Nieswandt B. Calcium signaling in platelets.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2009; 7: 1057-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 4Mahaut-Smith M.P. The unique contribution of ion channels to platelet and megakaryocyte function.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2012; 10: 1722-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). GsMTx-4 had no significant effect on store-operated Ca2+ entry assessed from the peak increase in Ca2+ after addition of 1.26 mm Ca2+ to platelets pretreated with 1 μm thapsigargin for 15 min in nominally Ca2+-free saline (Fig. 4A, panels i and ii). Furthermore, GsMTx-4 caused no inhibition of Ca2+ entry through transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily C member 6 (TRPC6) ion channels directly activated using the diacylglycerol analogue 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-glycerol (OAG) (60 μm) (28Hassock S.R. Zhu M.X. Trost C. Flockerzi V. Authi K.S. Expression and role of TRPC proteins in human platelets: evidence that TRPC6 forms the store-independent calcium entry channel.Blood. 2002; 100: 2801-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B, panels i and ii). A third Ca2+-permeable pathway in platelets is the ATP-gated P2X1 channel, which can be selectively activated by α,β-meATP (29Rolf M.G. Brearley C.A. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Platelet shape change evoked by selective activation of P2X1 purinoceptors with α,β-methylene ATP.Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 85: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a 30-s pretreatment with GsMTx-4 led to a reduction in the peak Ca2+ response (to 60% of control) to a supramaximal concentration of α,β-meATP (10 μm; a decrease from 296.1 ± 21.1 to 162.4 ± 35.9 nm) (Fig. 4C, panels i and ii). Loss of P2X1 receptor activity did not contribute to the inhibition of platelet shear-dependent Ca2+ responses by GsMTx-4 (Fig. 2) because these experiments were carried out in the absence of apyrase, which leads to complete desensitization of these ATP-gated cation channels (29Rolf M.G. Brearley C.A. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Platelet shape change evoked by selective activation of P2X1 purinoceptors with α,β-methylene ATP.Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 85: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 8A). However, P2X1 receptors will be functional in the thrombus formation experiments using whole blood because of the ectonucleotidase activity of plasma and leukocytes (30Cauwenberghs S. Feijge M.A. Hageman G. Hoylaerts M. Akkerman J.W. Curvers J. Heemskerk J.W.

We therefore compared the effect of GsMTx-4 and specific inhibition of P2X1 using 1 μm NF449 on thrombus formation. This concentration of NF449, which abolishes P2X1 activity (Fig. 5A), caused a reduction in thrombus volume to 63% of control (Fig. 5B, panel i), consistent with previous reports (32Hechler B. Magnenat S. Zighetti M.L. Kassack M.U. Ullmann H. Cazenave J.P. Evans R. Cattaneo M. Gachet C. Inhibition of platelet functions and thrombosis through selective or nonselective inhibition of the platelet P2 receptors with increasing doses of NF449 [4,4′,4″,4‴-(carbonylbis(imino-5,1,3-benzenetriylbis-(carbonylimino)))tetrakis-benzene-1,3-disulfonic acid octasodium salt.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 314: 232-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Importantly, the combined addition of GsMTx-4 and NF449 caused a more significant inhibition of thrombus formation compared with NF449 alone (Fig. 5B). Using NF449 alone, mean thrombus volume was reduced from 99,856 ± 30,184 μm3 to 62,678 ± 28,802 μm3(63% of control), whereas using GsMTx-4 alone and GsMTx-4 and NF449 combined, there were reductions to 31% (to 31,290 ± 7986 μm3) and 25% (to 24,889 ± 6251 μm3) of control in thrombus volume, respectively (Fig. 5B, panel i). Similarly, mean percentage surface coverage was reduced from 46.9 ± 7.6 to 36.1 ± 11.6% using NF449 and to 24.6 ± 4.5 and 18.4 ± 3.7% using GsMTx-4 and both GsMTx-4 and NF449, respectively (Fig. 5B, panel ii). Mean thrombus height decreased from 2.4 ± 0.7 to 1.5 ± 0.7 μm using NF449 and to 0.8 ± 0.2 and 0.6 ± 0.2 μm using GsMTx-4 and both GsMTx-4 and NF449, respectively (Fig. 5B, panel iii). Together, these results indicate that a pathway other than P2X1 receptors is the main target for GsMTx-4 during inhibition of thrombus formation.Figure 8Assessment of P2X1 activity in Fura-2-loaded platelet and Meg-01 cell suspensions in the presence and absence of extracellular apyrase.

https://openalex.org/W2606581283,"The proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzyme Usp14/Ubp6 inhibits protein degradation by catalyzing substrate deubiquitination and by poorly understood allosteric actions. However, upon binding a ubiquitin chain, Usp14 enhances proteasomal degradation by stimulating ATP and peptide degradation. These studies were undertaken to clarify these seemingly opposite regulatory roles of Usp14 and their importance. To learn how the presence of Usp14 on 26S proteasomes influences its different activities, we compared enzymatic and regulatory properties of 26S proteasomes purified from wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblast cells and those lacking Usp14. The proteasomes lacking Usp14 had higher basal peptidase activity than WT 26S, and this activity was stimulated to a greater extent by adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) (ATPγS) than with WT particles. These differences were clear even though Usp14 is present on only a minor fraction (30–40%) of the 26S in WT mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. Addition of purified Usp14 to the WT and Usp14-defficient proteasomes reduced both their basal peptidase activity and the stimulation by ATPγS. Usp14 inhibits these processes allosterically because a catalytically inactive Usp14 mutant also inhibited them. Proteasomes lacking Usp14 also exhibited greater deubiquitinating activity by Rpn11 and greater basal ATPase activity than WT particles. ATP hydrolysis by WT proteasomes is activated if they bind a ubiquitinated protein, which is loosely folded. Surprisingly, proteasomes lacking Usp14 could be activated by such proteins even without a ubiquitin chain present. Furthermore, proteasomes lacking Usp14 are much more active in degrading non-ubiquitinated proteins (e.g. Sic1) than WT particles. Thus, without a ubiquitinated substrate present, Usp14 suppresses multiple proteasomal activities, especially basal ATP consumption and degradation of non-ubiquitinated proteins. These allosteric effects thus reduce ATP hydrolysis by inactive proteasomes and nonspecific proteolysis and enhance proteasomal specificity for ubiquitinated proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2607272905,"The implementation of successful strategies to achieve an HIV cure has become a priority in HIV research. However, the current location and size of HIV reservoirs is still unknown since there are limited tools to evaluate HIV latency in viral sanctuaries such as gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). As reported in the so called ""Boston Patients"", despite undetectable levels of proviral HIV-1 DNA in blood and GALT, viral rebound happens in just few months after ART interruption. This fact might imply that current methods are not sensitive enough to detect residual reservoirs. Showing that, it is imperative to improve the detection and quantification of HIV-1 reservoir in tissue samples. Herein, we propose a novel non-enzymatic protocol for purification of Lamina Propria Leukocytes (LPL) from gut biopsies combined to viral HIV DNA (vDNA) quantification by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to improve the sensitivity and accuracy of viral reservoir measurements (LPL-vDNA assay).Endoscopic ileum biopsies were sampled from 12 HIV-1-infected cART-suppressed subjects. We performed a DTT/EDTA-based treatment for epithelial layer removal followed by non-enzymatic disruption of the tissue to obtain lamina propria cell suspension (LP). CD45+ cells were subsequently purified by flow sorting and vDNA was determined by ddPCR.vDNA quantification levels were significantly higher in purified LPLs (CD45+) than in bulk LPs (p<0.01). The levels of vDNA were higher in ileum samples than in concurrent PBMC from the same individuals (p = 0.002). As a result of the increased sensitivity of this purification method, the Poisson 95% confidence intervals of the vDNA quantification data from LPLs were narrower than that from bulk LPs. Of note, vDNA was unambiguously quantified above the detection limit in 100% of LPL samples, while only in 58% of bulk LPs.We propose an innovative combined protocol for a more sensitive detection of the HIV reservoir in gut-associated viral sanctuaries, which might be used to evaluate any proposed eradication strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2607272036,"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating disease without effective treatment. After ICH, the immediate infiltration of leukocytes and activation of microglia are accompanied by a rapid up-regulation of the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO). TSPO ligands have shown anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties in models of CNS injury. In this study, we determined the impact of a TSPO ligand, etifoxine, on brain injury and inflammation in 2 mouse models of ICH. TSPO was up-regulated in Iba1+ cells from brains of patients with ICH and in CD11b+CD45int cells from mice subjected to collagenase-induced ICH. Etifoxine significantly reduced neurodeficits and perihematomal brain edema after ICH induction by injection of either autologous blood or collagenase. In collagenase-induced ICH mice, the protection of etifoxine was associated with reduced leukocyte infiltration into the brain and microglial production of IL-6 and TNF-α. Etifoxine improved blood–brain barrier integrity and diminished cell death. Notably, the protective effect of etifoxine was abolished in mice depleted of microglia by using a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor. These results indicate that the TSPO ligand etifoxine attenuates brain injury and inflammation after ICH.

Aberrantly increased NF-κB O-GlcNAcylation has been linked to NF-κB constitutive activation and cancer development. Therefore, it is of a great biological and clinical significance to dissect the molecular mechanisms that tune NF-κB activity.

https://openalex.org/W2605916299,"Savannas once constituted the range of many species that human encroachment has now reduced to a fraction of their former distribution. Many survive only in protected areas. Poaching reduces the savanna elephant, even where protected, likely to the detriment of savanna ecosystems. While resources go into estimating elephant populations, an ecological benchmark by which to assess counts is lacking. Knowing how many elephants there are and how many poachers kill is important, but on their own, such data lack context. We collated savanna elephant count data from 73 protected areas across the continent estimated to hold ~50% of Africa’s elephants and extracted densities from 18 broadly stable population time series. We modeled these densities using primary productivity, water availability, and an index of poaching as predictors. We then used the model to predict stable densities given current conditions and poaching for all 73 populations. Next, to generate ecological benchmarks, we predicted such densities for a scenario of zero poaching. Where historical data are available, they corroborate or exceed benchmarks. According to recent counts, collectively, the 73 savanna elephant populations are at 75% of the size predicted based on current conditions and poaching levels. However, populations are at <25% of ecological benchmarks given a scenario of zero poaching (~967,000)—a total deficit of ~730,000 elephants. Populations in 30% of the 73 protected areas were <5% of their benchmarks, and the median current density as a percentage of ecological benchmark across protected areas was just 13%.

In our results, DIO could induce G1 phase arrest and thus enhance the radiosensitivity of radioresistant A549/IR lung cancer cells. Furthermore, DIO also restrains the IR-induced DNA damage repair by inhibiting the activated Akt signaling pathway. The combination of Akt inhibition (DIO, LY294002 or MK-2206) and radiation potently blocked A549/IR cancer cell proliferation.

To validate the ability and accuracy of DIR algorithms in organ at risk (OAR) contour mapping, ten intensity-based DIR strategies, which were classified into four categories—optical flow-based, demons-based, level-set-based and spline-based—were tested on planning CT and fractional CBCT images acquired from twenty-one head & neck (H&N) cancer patients who underwent 6~7-week intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Three similarity metrics, i.e., the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), the percentage error (PE) and the Hausdorff distance (HD), were employed to measure the agreement between the propagated contours and the physician-delineated ground truths of four OARs, including the vertebra (VTB), the vertebral foramen (VF), the parotid gland (PG) and the submandibular gland (SMG). It was found that the evaluated DIRs in this work did not necessarily outperform rigid registration. DIR performed better for bony structures than soft-tissue organs, and the DIR performance tended to vary for different ROIs with different degrees of deformation as the treatment proceeded. Generally, the optical flow-based DIR performed best, while the demons-based DIR usually ranked last except for a modified demons-based DISC used for CT-CBCT DIR. These experimental results suggest that the choice of a specific DIR algorithm depends on the image modality, anatomic site, magnitude of deformation and application. Therefore, careful examinations and modifications are required before accepting the auto-propagated contours, especially for automatic re-planning ART systems."
https://openalex.org/W2606636562,"Calcineurin inhibitors are powerful immunosuppressants that revolutionized organ transplantation. However, non-immune effects of the calcineurin inhibitor, such as cyclosporine A (CsA), have significantly hindered their use. Specifically, nephrotoxicity, which is associated with tubulointerstitial fibrosis, inflammation, and podocyte damage, affects up to half of all transplant patients. Calcineurin is involved in many aspects of kidney development and function; therefore, mechanisms of CsA-induced nephrotoxicity are complex and not yet fully understood. MicroRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that regulate protein-coding RNA expression through post-translational repression of target messenger RNAs. MicroRNA dysregulation is known to be involved in kidney diseases including fibrosis. In this study, we compared the renal microRNA expression profiles between mice that received CsA (20 mg/kg) or vehicle daily for six weeks. The results demonstrate that CsA induces significant changes in renal microRNA expression profile. We used combined criteria of False Discovery Rate (≤0.1), fold change (≥2) and median signal strength (≥50) and identified 76 differencially expressed microRNAs. This approach identified microRNAs previously linked to renal fibrosis that includes let-7d, miR-21, miR-29, miR-30, miR-130, miR-192, and miR-200 as well as microRNAs that have not been reported to be related to nephrotoxicity or immunosuppression. Pathway analysis of microRNA/mRNA changes highlights the Wnt, TGF-β, mTOR, and VEGF pathways. The mRNA expression profiles were compared in the same samples. The change of mRNA and microRNA profiles showed close correlations. To validate that the observed microRNA and mRNA expression level changes in mice kidney tissue were directly related to CsA treatment, the expression change induced by CsA treatment of three microRNAs (miR-21, miR-186, and miR-709) and three mRNAs (BMPR1a, SMURF1 and SMAD7) were compared in HEK293 cell line. A similar trend of expression level change was induced by CsA treatment in all selected microRNAs and mRNAs in the in vitro cell model. These data provide a roadmap for future work to study the role of the known and novel candidate microRNAs in the mechanism of nephrotoxicity and their further therapeutic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2607235381,"In this study, we have uncovered a novel crosstalk between TGFβ and IGF-1R signaling pathways. We show for the first time that expression and activation of IRS-1, an IGF-1R adaptor protein, is decreased by TGFβ/Smad3 signaling. Loss or attenuation of TGFβ activation leads to elevated expression and phosphorylation of IRS-1 in colon cancer cells, resulting in enhanced cell proliferation, decreased apoptosis and increased tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Downregulation of IRS-1 expression reversed Smad3 knockdown-mediated oncogenic phenotypes, indicating that TGFβ/Smad3 signaling inhibits cell proliferation and increases apoptosis at least partially through the inhibition of IRS-1 expression and activation. Additionally, the TGFβ/Smad3/IRS-1 signaling axis regulates expression of cyclin D1 and XIAP, which may contribute to TGFβ/Smad3/IRS-1-mediated cell cycle progression and survival. Given that loss of TGFβ signaling occurs frequently in colon cancer, an important implication of our study is that IRS-1 could be a potential therapeutic target for colon cancer treatment."

The evidence for an involvement of TRP family members in adipogenesis, however, is scant. We present the first comprehensive expression profile of all known 27 human TRP genes in mesenchymal progenitors cells during white or brown adipogenesis. Using positive trilineage differentiation as an exclusion criterion, TRP polycystic (P)3, and TPR melastatin (M)8 were found to be uniquely adipospecific. Knockdown of TRPP3 repressed the expression of the brown fat signature genes uncoupling protein (UCP)-1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator (PGC)-1α as well as attenuated forskolin-stimulated uncoupled respiration. However, indices of generalized adipogenesis, such as lipid droplet morphology and fatty acid binding protein (FAPB)-4 expression, were not affected, indicating a principal mitochondrial role of TRPP3. Conversely, activating TRPM8 with menthol up-regulated UCP-1 expression and augmented uncoupled respiration predominantly in white adipocytes (browning), whereas streptomycin antagonized TRPM8-mediated calcium entry, downregulated UCP-1 expression, and mitigated uncoupled respiration; menthol was less capable of augmenting uncoupled respiration (thermogenesis) in brown adipocytes. TRPP3 and TRPM8 hence appear to be involved in the priming of mitochondria to perform uncoupled respiration downstream of adenylate cyclase. Our results also underscore the developmental caveats of using antibiotics in adipogenic studies.—Goralczyk, A., van Vijven, M., Koch, M., Badowski, C., Yassin, M.

https://openalex.org/W2605872025,"Myxomycetes (plasmodial slime molds, Amoebozoa) are often perceived as widely distributed, confounding to the ""everything is everywhere"" hypothesis. To test if gene flow within these spore-dispersed protists is restricted by geographical barriers, we chose the widespread but morphologically unmistakable species Hemitrichia serpula for a phylogeographic study. Partial sequences from nuclear ribosomal RNA genes (SSU) revealed 40 ribotypes among 135 specimens, belonging to three major clades. Each clade is dominated by specimens from a certain region and by one of two morphological varieties which can be differentiated by SEM micrographs. Partial sequences of the protein elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1A) showed each clade to possess a unique combination of SSU and EF1A genotypes. This pattern is best explained assuming the existence of several putative biospecies dominating in a particular geographical region. However, occasional mismatches between molecular data and morphological characters, but as well heterogeneous SSU and heterozygous EF1A sequences, point to ongoing speciation. Environmental niche models suggest that the putative biospecies are rather restricted by geographical barriers than by macroecological conditions. Like other protists, myxomycetes seem to follow the moderate endemicity hypothesis and are in active speciation, which is most likely shaped by limited gene flow and reproductive isolation."

The likelihood of overweight and obesity was significantly higher at 8 years and older among children living without siblings, compared with those living with siblings, and odds ratios were highest at 11 years of age in boys (1.87, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.49, 2.33) and at 10 and 13 years of age in girls (1.75 [95% CI: 1.36, 2.23] and 1.73 [95% CI: 1.30, 2.31], respectively). It was also significantly higher at 5.5 years and older among children living with grandparents, compared with those living without grandparents, and odds ratios were highest at 10 and 13 years of age in boys (1.53 [95% CI: 1.30, 1.80] and 1.54 [95% CI: 1.27, 1.86], respectively) and at 11 years of age in girls (1.51, 95% CI: 1.24, 1.84). In Japan, living without siblings and living with grandparents may increase the likelihood of overweight and obesity at 8 and 5.5 years and older, respectively. Child’s age should be considered during formulation of strategies for prevention of overweight and obesity in these groups."

The primary aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial glucose (PG) and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) with brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) in Caucasian adults. The secondary aim was to analyse this relationship by glycaemic status. Methods Cross-sectional study. Setting: Primary care. Participants: 2,233 subjects, 35–74 years. Measures: FPG (mg/dL) and HbA1c (%) of all subjects were measured using standard automated enzymatic methods. PG (mg/dL) was self-measured at home two hours after meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner) for one day using an Accu-chek ® glucometer. CAVI was measured using a VaSera VS-1500® device (Fukuda Denshi), and baPWV was calculated using a validated equation. Results CAVI and baPWV values were significantly higher in subjects with diabetes mellitus than in glucose normal and prediabetes groups (p<0.001). FPG, PG and HbA1c were positively associated with CAVI and baPWV. The β regression coefficient for: HbA1c was 0.112 (CI 95% 0.068 to 0.155) with CAVI, 0.266 (CI 95% 0.172 to 0.359) with baPWV; for PG was 0.006 (CI 95% 0.004 to 0.009 and for FPG was 0.005 (CI 95% 0.002 to 0.008) with baPWV; and for PG was 0.002 (CI 95% 0.001 to 0.003) and 0.003 (CI 95% 0.002 to 0.004) with CAVI (p<0.01 in all cases). When analysing by hyperglycaemic status, FPG, PG and HbA1c were positively associated with CAVI and baPWV in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Conclusion FPG, PG and HbA1c show a positive association with CAVI and baPWV, in Caucasian adults with intermediate cardiovascular risk factors. When analysing by hyperglycaemic status, the association is only maintained in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Trial registration Clinical Trials.gov Identifier: NCT01428934.

https://openalex.org/W2606163439,"Within seven days following peroral high dose infection with Toxoplasma gondii susceptible conventionally colonized mice develop acute ileitis due to an underlying T helper cell (Th) -1 type immunopathology. We here addressed whether mice harboring a human intestinal microbiota developed intestinal, extra-intestinal and systemic sequelae upon ileitis induction.Secondary abiotic mice were generated by broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment and associated with a complex human intestinal microbiota following peroral fecal microbiota transplantation. Within three weeks the human microbiota had stably established in the murine intestinal tract as assessed by quantitative cultural and culture-independent (i.e. molecular 16S rRNA based) methods. At day 7 post infection (p.i.) with 50 cysts of T. gondii strain ME49 by gavage human microbiota associated (hma) mice displayed severe clinical, macroscopic and microscopic sequelae indicating acute ileitis. In diseased hma mice increased numbers of innate and adaptive immune cells within the ileal mucosa and lamina propria and elevated intestinal secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators including IFN-γ, IL-12 and nitric oxide could be observed at day 7 p.i. Ileitis development was accompanied by substantial shifts in intestinal microbiota composition of hma mice characterized by elevated total bacterial loads and increased numbers of intestinal Gram-negative commensals such as enterobacteria and Bacteroides / Prevotella species overgrowing the small and large intestinal lumen. Furthermore, viable bacteria translocated from the inflamed ileum to extra-intestinal including systemic compartments. Notably, pro-inflammatory immune responses were not restricted to the intestinal tract as indicated by increased pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in extra-intestinal (i.e. liver and kidney) and systemic compartments including spleen and serum.With respect to the intestinal microbiota composition ""humanized"" mice display acute ileitis following peroral high dose T. gondii infection. Thus, hma mice constitute a suitable model to further dissect the interactions between pathogens, human microbiota and vertebrate host immunity during acute intestinal inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2605868575,"This study examined a knowledge-centered theory of institutional trust development. In the context of trust in water regulatory institutions, the moderating impact of knowledge was tested to determine if there were longitudinal changes in the bases of institutional trust as a function of increases in knowledge about a target institution. We hypothesized that as people learn about an institution with which they were previously unfamiliar, they begin to form more nuanced perceptions, distinguishing the new institution from other institutions and relying less upon their generalized trust to estimate their trust in that institution. Prior to having specific, differential information about a new institution, we expected institutional trust to be a function of generalized trust variables such as dispositional trust and trust in government. The longitudinal experiment involved 185 college students randomly assigned to one of three information conditions. Every 3 months for 15 months, participants read information about water regulatory institutions or a control institution. At each time point, participants reported their trust in and perceptions of the trust- and distrust-worthiness of the water regulatory institutions. Participants also completed measures of knowledge of water regulatory institutions, dispositional trust, and governmental trust. Our manipulation check indicated that, as expected, those in the experimental group increased in subjective knowledge of water regulatory institutions to a greater extent than those in the control condition. Consistent with our hypotheses, there was some evidence that, compared to the control group, the experimental group relied less on their general trust in government as a basis for their trust in water regulatory institutions. However, contrary to our hypotheses, there was no evidence the experimental group relied less on dispositional trust as a basis for institutional trust. There also was some evidence the experimental group's trust in water regulatory institutions was less affected by fluctuations of trustworthiness (but not distrustworthiness) perceptions over time. This suggests that knowledge results in the development of more stable institutional trust attitudes, but that trustworthiness and distrustworthiness perceptions may operate somewhat differently when impacting trust in specific institutions."
https://openalex.org/W2605872519,"There is an emerging consensus that hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for cerebral vascular disease and that homocysteine-lowering therapy protects from ischemic stroke. However, the mechanisms by which hyperhomocysteinemia produces abnormalities of cerebral vascular structure and function remain largely undefined. Our objective in this study was to define the mechanistic role of superoxide in hyperhomocysteinemia-induced cerebral vascular dysfunction and hypertrophy. Unlike previous studies, our experimental design included a genetic approach to alter superoxide levels by using superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1)-deficient mice fed a high methionine/low folate diet to produce hyperhomocysteinemia. In wild-type mice, the hyperhomocysteinemic diet caused elevated superoxide levels and impaired responses to endothelium-dependent vasodilators in cerebral arterioles, and SOD1 deficiency compounded the severity of these effects. The cross-sectional area of the pial arteriolar wall was markedly increased in mice with SOD1 deficiency, and the hyperhomocysteinemic diet sensitized SOD1-deficient mice to this hypertrophic effect. Analysis of individual components of the vascular wall demonstrated a significant increase in the content of smooth muscle and elastin. We conclude that superoxide is a key driver of both cerebral vascular hypertrophy and vasomotor dysfunction in this model of dietary hyperhomocysteinemia. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms by which hyperhomocysteinemia promotes cerebral vascular disease and ischemic stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2606154399,"Objective To measure the parapapillary atrophy (PPA) area in en face images obtained with swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT), and to evaluate its relationship to glaucoma, myopia, and age in non-highly myopic subjects. Design Retrospective, cross-sectional study. Participants Fifty eyes of 30 subjects with open-angle glaucoma (G group) and forty-three eyes of 26 healthy control subjects (C group). Eyes with high myopia (spherical equivalent refractive error ≤ -8 diopters or axial length ≥ 26.5 mm) were excluded. Methods Mean age ± standard deviation was 59.9 ± 12.4 years. The beta zone and the gamma zone PPA areas were measured in en face images reconstructed from three-dimensional SS-OCT images. Relationship between the PPA areas and patient characteristics such as glaucoma, axial length, and age was statistically evaluated using multivariate mixed-effects models. Main outcome measures Areas of the beta zone and the gamma zone PPA measured on en face OCT images. Results Average ± standard deviation area of the beta and the gamma zone was 0.64 ± 0.79 and 0.16 ± 0.30 mm2, respectively. In multivariate models, the gamma zone significantly correlated with axial length (P = 0.001) but not with glaucoma (P = 0.944). In contrast, the beta zone significantly correlated with age (P = 0.0249) and glaucoma (P = 0.014). Conclusions En face images reconstructed from 3D SS-OCT data facilitated measurements of the beta and the gamma PPA zones even in eyes with optic disc distortion. The OCT-defined beta zone is associated with glaucoma and age, whereas the gamma zone correlated with myopia but not with glaucoma. This study confirmed the clinical usefulness of OCT-based classification of the PPA zones in distinguishing glaucomatous damage of the optic nerve from myopic damage in non-highly myopic eyes."
https://openalex.org/W2605554828,"Both spiny and edible amaranths (Amaranthus spinosus and A. tricolor) are exotic annuals in China that produce numerous small seeds every year. Spiny amaranth has become a successful invader and a troublesome weed in Xishuangbanna, but edible amaranth has not, although it is widely grown as a vegetable there. As seed germination is one of the most important life-stages contributing to the ability of a plant to become invasive, we conducted experiments to compare the effects of high temperature and water stress on seed germination in two varieties each of spiny amaranth and edible amaranth. Overall, the seeds of both amaranth species exhibited adaptation to high temperature and water stress, including tolerance to ground temperatures of 70°C for air-dried seeds, which is consistent with their behavior in their native ranges in the tropics. As expected, the invasive spiny amaranth seeds exhibited higher tolerance to both continuous and daily periodic high-temperature treatment at 45°C, and to imbibition-desiccation treatment, compared to edible amaranth seeds. Unexpectedly, edible amaranth seeds exhibited higher germination at extreme temperatures (10°C, 15°C, and 40°C), and at lower water potential (below -0.6 MPa). It is likely that cultivation of edible amaranth has selected seed traits that include rapid germination and germination under stressful conditions, either of which, under natural conditions, may result in the death of most germinating edible amaranth seeds and prevent them from becoming invasive weeds in Xishuangbanna. This study suggests that rapid germination and high germination under stress conditions-excellent seed traits for crops and for many invasive species-might be a disadvantage under natural conditions if these traits are asynchronous with natural local conditions that support successful germination."
https://openalex.org/W2606796139,"This study evaluated the effect of pH on the activity of antioxidant and immune enzymes in the sea cucumber Isostichopus badionotus exposed to different temperatures. The organisms (530 ±110 g) were exposed to 16, 20, 24, 28, 30, 34 and 36°C for 6 h to evaluate thermal limits at two water pH values (treatment = 7.70; control = 8.17). For the thermal tolerance experiment, the organisms were exposed to sublethal temperature of 34°C for 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. I. badionotus showed signs of thermal stress by synthesizing heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) at the cold (16°C) and warm thermal limits (34°C). The glutathione peroxidase (GPx) showed a negative correlation with superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in modulating the effect of oxidative stress at different temperature levels. Specifically, GPx activity was maximal at the extremes of the cold and warm temperatures (16, 20, and 36°C) tested, while contrarily, the SOD activity increased significantly in the narrow range of temperature between 28 and 30°C, as a part of a reaction to offset oxidative damage. The effect of pH on the expression of hsp70 was not significant, whereas the antioxidant enzymes activity was stimulated at pH 7.70. Mucosal immunity, evidenced by the activation of the phenoloxidase (PO) system, increased above the basal level at pH 7.70 and at 28, 30, and 34°C. Independent of pH, the temperature of 34°C was identified as the 12 h-sublethal upper limit for I. badionotus."

Although the functions of CD36 in parasite sequestration and phagocytosis have been clearly defined, less is known about its role in malaria immunity. Here, to understand the function of CD36 in malaria immunity, we studied parasite growth, innate and adaptive immune responses, and host survival in WT and Cd36−/− mice infected with a non-lethal strain of Plasmodium yoelii. Compared with Cd36−/− mice, WT mice had lower parasitemias and were resistant to death. At early but not at later stages of infection, WT mice had higher circulatory proinflammatory cytokines and lower anti-inflammatory cytokines than Cd36−/− mice. WT mice showed higher frequencies of proinflammatory cytokine-producing and lower frequencies of anti-inflammatory cytokine-producing dendritic cells (DCs) and natural killer cells than Cd36−/− mice. Cytokines produced by co-cultures of DCs from infected mice and ovalbumin-specific, MHC class II-restricted α/β (OT-II) T cells reflected CD36-dependent DC function. WT mice also showed increased Th1 and reduced Th2 responses compared with Cd36−/− mice, mainly at early stages of infection. Furthermore, in infected WT mice, macrophages and neutrophils expressed higher levels of phagocytic receptors and showed enhanced phagocytosis of parasite-infected erythrocytes than those in Cd36−/− mice in an IFN-γ-dependent manner. However, there were no differences in malaria-induced humoral responses between WT and Cd36−/− mice.

This interaction mediates the adherence of IRBCs to microvascular endothelia, enabling parasites to be sequestered in host organs and avoid clearance from the circulation. When immunity against an adherent PfEMP1 is present in the host, parasites expressing other PfEMP1 variants having different adherent specificity are sequestered in the host organs. The parasites multiply and accumulate in large numbers in organs, contributing to severe malaria pathogenesis (31Ochola L.B. Siddondo B.R. Ocholla H. Nkya S. Kimani E.N. Williams T.N. Makale J.O.

Although murine parasites do not express PfEMP1 orthologs, CD36 mediates the sequestration of Plasmodium berghei Antwerpen-Kasapa (ANKA), a cytoadherent murine malaria parasite strain, to lungs and adipose tissue of infected mice, presumably by interacting with unidentified structure(s) on the IRBC surface (35Franke-Fayard B.

Thus, CD36 plays an important role in immune responses to malaria, but insight into CD36-mediated regulation of immune responses to malaria remains less understood. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to determine the contribution of CD36 in malaria-induced immune responses and dissect the associated cellular mechanisms. To this end, we analyzed immune responses and assessed parasite growth kinetics and host survival in WT and Cd36−/− mice infected with a non-lethal, non-sequestering Plasmodium yoelii strain, which allows assessment of immune responses during the course of innate and adaptive immunity development. The results showed that CD36 significantly contributes to the production of proinflammatory cytokines by the cells of the innate immune system and Th1 development. CD36 also contributes to the suppression of anti-inflammatory cytokine production and Th2 development. Additionally, the CD36-dependent immune responses contribute to the expression of other phagocytic receptors and phagocytic activity, thereby significantly reducing parasite burden and malarial mortality. Overall, our results define the role of CD36 in malaria immunity, revealing the associated cellular mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the role of CD36 in immunity to blood stage malaria and in clinical outcomes by infecting WT and Cd36−/− mice with a non-sequestering P. yoelii 17XNL strain and analyzing various responses during the course of innate and adaptive immunity development. In mice infected with P. yoelii 17XNL strain, parasitemias reach a peak of 30–40% by about 20 days, and mice generally survive by clearing infection (42Butler N.S. Moebius J. Pewe L.L. Traore B.

Survival analysis showed that 90% of WT mice infected with P. yoelii 17XNL survived, whereas the majority of infected Cd36−/− mice died between 17 and 24 days pi (Fig. 1A). Analysis of parasite growth kinetics showed, in both WT and Cd36−/− mice, slow parasite growth during the 1st week of infection and then a rapid increase, reaching peak parasitemias at 20–22 days pi (Fig. 1B). After this period, parasitemias were markedly decreased to basal levels in surviving mice. These observations agree with the previously reported growth pattern of P. yoelii 17XNL (42Butler N.S.

Throughout the infection period, parasitemias were significantly higher in Cd36−/− mice than in WT mice. Although parasitemias were relatively low in both WT and Cd36−/− mice up to 10–12 days pi, the parasitemias in Cd36−/− mice were 57–125% higher than those in WT mice (Fig. 1C). The CD36-depedent control of parasitemia is consistent with the reported results that CD36 is efficiently expressed by Mϕs and contributes to parasitemia control in mice infected with Plasmodium chabaudi (25Patel S.N. Lu Z. Ayi K. Serghides L. Gowda D.C. Kain K.C.

Immunol. 2007; 178: 3954-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Because CD36 functions both as a scavenger and pattern recognition receptor, it is not surprising that P. yoelii IRBCs are recognized by CD36 on Mϕs likely through relatively weak interactions and phagocytosed. Thus, the above data demonstrated that CD36 contributes to parasitemia control and resistance against malarial fatality. Based on the results presented in Fig. 1, we predicted that CD36 contributes to malaria-induced immune responses that are involved in parasitemia control and resistance to disease severity. Proinflammatory cytokine responses induced at early stages of infection play important roles in either pathogenesis or resistance to malaria depending on whether or not parasites are sequestered in host organs (10Stevenson M.M.

Key developmental genes tend to exhibit changes in histone modification patterns from the H3K4me3/H3K27me3 bivalent pattern to the H3K4me3 monovalent pattern. Using comprehensive chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) and mature osteoclasts, we found that cell surface adhesion molecule 1 (Cadm1) is a direct target of nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATc1) and exhibits a bivalent histone pattern in BMMs and a monovalent pattern in osteoclasts. Cadm1 expression was upregulated in BMMs by receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), and blocked by a calcineurin/NFATc1 inhibitor, FK506. Cadm1-deficient mice exhibited significantly reduced bone mass compared with wild-type mice, which was due to the increased osteoclast differentiation, survival and bone-resorbing activity in Cadm1-deficient osteoclasts. These results suggest that Cadm1 is a direct target of NFATc1, which is induced by RANKL through epigenetic modification, and regulates osteoclastic bone resorption in a negative feedback manner."
https://openalex.org/W2605439888,"In mammals, very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) perform pleiotropic roles in a wide range of biological processes, such as cell membrane formation, cell signal transduction, and endocrine regulation. Beef and milk are abundant of palmitic acid which can be further elongated into stearic acid for synthesizing VLCFAs. Elongase of very long chain fatty acid 6 (ELOVL6) is a rate-limiting enzyme for converting palmitic acid to stearic acid. Consequently, investigating the tissue expression patterns and transcriptional regulation of bovine ELOVL6 can provide new insights into improving the composition of beneficial fats in cattle and expanding the knowledge of transcriptional regulation mechanism among domestic animals. In the current study, we found that bovine ELOVL6 expressed ubiquitously. Dual-luciferase reporter assay identified that the core promoter region (-130/-41 bp) was located in the second CpG island. In addition, the deletion mutation of binding sites demonstrated that sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1) and specific protein 1 (SP1) both were able to stimulate bovine ELOVL6 promoter activity independently, while resulting the similar effect. To confirm these findings, further RNA interference assays were executed in bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs). In summary, these data suggest that bovine ELOVL6 expressed ubiquitously and is activated by SREBF1 and SP1, via two binding sites present in the ELOVL6 promoter region between -130 bp to -41bp."

The maximum region of overlap between their deletions spanned ~430 kb and included two pseudogenes, CENPVL1 and CENPVL2, whose functions are not known, and two protein coding genes—the G1 to S phase transition 2 gene (GSPT2) and the MAGE family member D1 gene (MAGED1). Deletions of this ~430 kb region have not been previously implicated in human disease. Duplications of GSPT2 have been documented in individuals with intellectual disability, but the phenotypic consequences of a loss of GSPT2 function have not been elucidated in humans or mouse models. Changes in MAGED1 have not been associated with intellectual disability in humans, but loss of MAGED1 function is associated with neurocognitive and neurobehavioral phenotypes in mice. In all cases, the Xp11.22 deletion was inherited from an unaffected mother. Studies performed on DNA from one of these mothers did not show evidence of skewed X-inactivation. These results suggest that deletions of an ~430 kb region on chromosome Xp11.22 that encompass CENPVL1, CENPVL2, GSPT2 and MAGED1 cause a distinct X-linked syndrome characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delay, hypotonia, joint hypermobility and relative macrocephaly. Loss of GSPT2 and/or MAGED1 function may contribute to the intellectual disability and developmental delay seen in males with these deletions."
https://openalex.org/W2606273705,"The increasing growth of literature in biodiversity presents challenges to users who need to discover pertinent information in an efficient and timely manner. In response, text mining techniques offer solutions by facilitating the automated discovery of knowledge from large textual data. An important step in text mining is the recognition of concepts via their linguistic realisation, i.e., terms. However, a given concept may be referred to in text using various synonyms or term variants, making search systems likely to overlook documents mentioning less known variants, which are albeit relevant to a query term. Domain-specific terminological resources, which include term variants, synonyms and related terms, are thus important in supporting semantic search over large textual archives. This article describes the use of text mining methods for the automatic construction of a large-scale biodiversity term inventory. The inventory consists of names of species, amongst which naming variations are prevalent. We apply a number of distributional semantic techniques on all of the titles in the Biodiversity Heritage Library, to compute semantic similarity between species names and support the automated construction of the resource. With the construction of our biodiversity term inventory, we demonstrate that distributional semantic models are able to identify semantically similar names that are not yet recorded in existing taxonomies. Such methods can thus be used to update existing taxonomies semi-automatically by deriving semantically related taxonomic names from a text corpus and allowing expert curators to validate them. We also evaluate our inventory as a means to improve search by facilitating automatic query expansion. Specifically, we developed a visual search interface that suggests semantically related species names, which are available in our inventory but not always in other repositories, to incorporate into the search query. An assessment of the interface by domain experts reveals that our query expansion based on related names is useful for increasing the number of relevant documents retrieved. Its exploitation can benefit both users and developers of search engines and text mining applications."

Purified recombinant LytB showed a murolytic activity on Micrococcus lysodeikticus cell suspension and was able to disperse the long chains of the mutant, restoring the wild type diplococci/short chain phenotype. LytB protein was localized only in culture supernatant cell fraction of S. gordonii, and co-cultures of wild type and lytB mutant showed a significant reduction of bacterial chain length, indicating that LytB is a secreted enzyme. Our results demonstrate that LytB is a secreted peptidoglycan hydrolase required for S. gordonii cell separation."

Methods We conducted cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses alongside a cluster randomized trial with one-year follow-up. Participants were aged ≥ 70 years and at increased risk of functional decline. Participants in the intervention group (n = 1209) received a comprehensive geriatric assessment and individually tailored multifactorial interventions coordinated by a community-care registered nurse with multiple follow-up visits. The control group (n = 1074) received usual care. Costs were assessed from a healthcare perspective. Outcome measures included disability (modified Katz-Activities of Daily Living (ADL) index score), and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Statistical uncertainty surrounding Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs) was estimated using bootstrapped bivariate regression models while adjusting for confounders. Results There were no statistically significant differences in Katz-ADL index score and QALYs between the two groups. Total mean costs were significantly higher in the intervention group (EUR 6518 (SE 472) compared with usual care (EUR 5214 (SE 338); adjusted mean difference €1457 (95% CI: 572; 2537). Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showed that the maximum probability of the intervention being cost-effective was 0.14 at a willingness to pay (WTP) of EUR 50,000 per one point improvement on the Katz-ADL index score and 0.04 at a WTP of EUR 50,000 per QALY gained. Conclusion The current intervention was not cost-effective compared to usual care to prevent or postpone new disabilities over a one-year period. Based on these findings, implementation of the evaluated multifactorial nurse-led care model is not to be recommended."

Here, we assessed the effects of maternal Ca in Daphnia on transfer of resistance to their offspring against Microcystis aeruginosa PCC7806 (M. aeruginosa). Laboratory microcosm experiments were performed to examine effects in Daphnia carinata (D. carinata) and Daphnia pulex (D. pulex), and that how Ca induce responses in their offspring. The results showed that growth and survival were increased in offspring from exposed Daphnia as compared to unexposed, when raised in high Ca and increasing M. aeruginosa concentration. Among exposed Daphnia, offspring from high Ca mothers, produced more neonates with large size and higher survival as compared to offspring from low maternal Ca. Exposed D. carinata and D. pulex offspring, when reared in Ca deficient medium and increasing M. aeruginosa concentration, time to first brood increased, size become large and total offspring decreased subsequently in three alternative broods in offspring from low maternal Ca. In contrast, growth and reproduction in offspring from high Ca exposed mothers were consistent in three alternative broods. Despite species specific responses in growth, survival and variant life history traits in two Daphnia species, our results not only show maternal induction in Daphnia but also highlight that offspring response to M. aeruginosa varies with maternal Ca. This study demonstrates that Ca have role in Daphnia maternal induction against Microcystis, and recent Ca decline and increasing Microcystis concentration in lakes may decrease Daphnia growth and survival. Our data provide insights into the interactive effect of maternal Ca and Microcystis exposure on Daphnia and their outcome on offspring life history traits and survival."
https://openalex.org/W2606012532,"Hydrologic alteration is a major threat to freshwater biota, and particularly fish, in many river courses around the world. We analyzed and compared the effects of water abstraction on two threatened cyprinid fishes of contrasting ecology (the Mediterranean barbel Barbus meridionalis and the Catalan chub Squalius laietanus) in a Mediterranean stream. We compared abundance, size-structure, growth, and condition of both species across perennial and artificially intermittent reaches affected by water abstraction. Both species were less abundant, had scarce large individuals, and displayed slower growth rates (length-at-age) in intermittent reaches, showing clear detrimental effects of water diversion. Mixed-effect models of scale increments showed variation among individuals and among sites, years and age classes for both species. The larger-sized, water-column species (chub) disappeared or was rare in many intermittent reaches. The barbel present in intermittent reaches showed better somatic condition than in sites with permanent flow, perhaps due to reduced competition after rewetting or colonization by better fitted individuals. This benthic, rheophilic species seems more resilient to moderate water abstraction than chub. Many effects of water flow intermittency were only detected on fish life-history traits when accounting for natural, often non-linear, variation, along upstream-downstream gradients. Our results suggest that abundance was the strongest indicator of effects of water abstraction on fish populations, whereas condition was a more labile trait, rapidly recovering from anthropogenic disturbance."
https://openalex.org/W2606090356,"BIG1, an activator protein of the small GTPase, Arf, and encoded by the Arfgef1 gene, is one of candidate genes for epileptic encephalopathy. To know the involvement of BIG1 in epileptic encephalopathy, we analyzed BIG1-deficient mice and found that BIG1 regulates neurite outgrowth and brain development in vitro and in vivo. The loss of BIG1 decreased the size of the neocortex and hippocampus. In BIG1-deficient mice, the neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) and the interneurons were unaffected. However, Tbr1+ and Ctip2+ deep layer (DL) neurons showed spatial-temporal dependent apoptosis. This apoptosis gradually progressed from the piriform cortex (PIR), peaked in the neocortex, and then progressed into the hippocampus from embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) to E17.5. The upper layer (UL) and DL order in the neocortex was maintained in BIG1-deficient mice, but the excitatory neurons tended to accumulate before their destination layers. Further pulse-chase migration assay showed that the migration defect was non-cell autonomous and secondary to the progression of apoptosis into the BIG1-deficient neocortex after E15.5. In BIG1-deficient mice, we observed an ectopic projection of corticothalamic axons from the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) into the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). The thalamocortical axons were unable to cross the diencephalon-telencephalon boundary (DTB). In vitro, BIG1-deficient neurons showed a delay in neuronal polarization. BIG1-deficient neurons were also hypersensitive to low dose glutamate (5 μM), and died via apoptosis. This study showed the role of BIG1 in the survival of DL neurons in developing embryonic brain and in the generation of neuronal polarity."
https://openalex.org/W2605548152,"DNA sequences that are guanine-rich have received considerable attention because of their potential to fold into a secondary, four-stranded DNA structure termed G-quadruplex (G4), which has been implicated in genomic instability and some human diseases. We have previously identified positive coactivator of transcription (PC4), a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein, as a novel G4 interactor. Here, to expand on these previous observations, we biochemically and biophysically characterized the interaction between PC4 and G4DNA. PC4 can bind alternative G4DNA topologies with a low nanomolar Kd value of ∼2 nm, similar to that observed for ssDNA. In consideration of the different structural features between G4DNA and ssDNA, these binding data indicated that PC4 can interact with G4DNA in a manner distinct from ssDNA. The stoichiometry of the PC4-G4 complex was 1:1 for PC4 dimer:G4 substrate. PC4 did not enhance the rate of folding of G4DNA, and formation of the PC4-G4DNA complex did not result in unfolding of the G4DNA structure. We assembled a G4DNA structure flanked by duplex DNA. We find that PC4 can interact with this G4DNA, as well as the complementary C-rich strand. Molecular docking simulations and DNA footprinting experiments suggest a model where a PC4 dimer accommodates the DNA with one monomer on the G4 strand and the second monomer bound to the C-rich strand. Collectively, these data provide a novel mode of PC4 binding to a DNA secondary structure that remains within the framework of the model for binding to ssDNA. Additionally, consideration of the PC4-G4DNA interaction could provide insight into the biological functions of PC4, which remain incompletely understood."
https://openalex.org/W2606064520,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic disease characterized by progressive tissue damage. In recent decades, novel treatments have greatly extended the life span of SLE patients. This creates a high demand for identifying the overarching symptoms associated with SLE and developing therapies that improve their life quality under chronic care. We hypothesized that SLE patients would present dysphonic symptoms. Given that voice disorders can reduce life quality, identifying a potential SLE-related dysphonia could be relevant for the appraisal and management of this disease. We measured objective vocal parameters and perceived vocal quality with the GRBAS (Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, Strain) scale in SLE patients and compared them to matched healthy controls. SLE patients also filled a questionnaire reporting perceived vocal deficits. SLE patients had significantly lower vocal intensity and harmonics to noise ratio, as well as increased jitter and shimmer. All subjective parameters of the GRBAS scale were significantly abnormal in SLE patients. Additionally, the vast majority of SLE patients (29/36) reported at least one perceived vocal deficit, with the most prevalent deficits being vocal fatigue (19/36) and hoarseness (17/36). Self-reported voice deficits were highly correlated with altered GRBAS scores. Additionally, tissue damage scores in different organ systems correlated with dysphonic symptoms, suggesting that some features of SLE-related dysphonia are due to tissue damage. Our results show that a large fraction of SLE patients suffers from perceivable dysphonia and may benefit from voice therapy in order to improve quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W2606132261,"The value of preserving high quality bio specimens for fundamental research is significant as linking cellular and molecular changes to clinical and epidemiological data has fueled many recent advances in medicine. Unfortunately, storage of traditional biospecimens is limited to fixed samples or isolated genetic material. Here, we report the effect of cryopreservation of routine myocardial biopsies on explant derived cardiac stem cell (EDC) culture outcomes. We demonstrate that immediate cryopreservation or delayed cryopreservation after suspension within cardioplegia for 12 hours did not alter EDC yields, proliferative capacity, antigenic phenotype or paracrine signature. Cryopreservation had negligible effects on the ability of EDCs to adopt a cardiac lineage, stimulate new vessel growth, attract circulating angiogenic cells and repair injured myocardium. Finally, cryopreservation did not influence the ability of EDCs to undergo genetic reprogramming into inducible pluripotent stem cells. This study establishes a means of storing cardiac samples as a retrievable live cell source for cardiac repair or disease modeling."
https://openalex.org/W2606717710,"Background Rehabilitation can improve physical activity after stroke. However, patients may be more prone to falls and fractures because of balance and gait deficits. Few reports have studied the relationship between rehabilitation and subsequent fractures after ischemic stroke. Objective To investigate whether post-stroke rehabilitation affects fracture risk. Methods We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study based on the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients with a newly diagnosed ischemic stroke between 2000 and 2012 were included. After propensity score matching, a total of 8,384 patients were enrolled. Half of the patients (4,192) received post-stroke rehabilitation within 1 month; the other half did not receive any post-stroke rehabilitation. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for fractures among patients with and without rehabilitation within 1 year after ischemic stroke. Patients were further stratified by sex and age (20–64 and ≥65 years). Results Patients receiving post-stroke rehabilitation had a higher incidence of fracture (6.2 per 100 person-years) than those who did not (4.1 per 100 person-years) after adjustment for sociodemographic and coexisting medical conditions [HR = 1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.25–1.87, p < 0.001]. The analyses performed after stratifying for sex and age showed that only older women undergoing rehabilitation had a significantly higher risk of fracture (HR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.21–2.17, p = 0.001). Conclusion Rehabilitation after ischemic stroke is associated with an increased fracture risk in older women."
https://openalex.org/W2606832206,"Background Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) has been successfully implemented in 14 countries as an additional HIV prevention intervention. As VMMC programs mature in most countries, the focus is now on how to sustain the HIV prevention gains realised from VMMC. As part of preparations for the sustainability phase, countries are either piloting or preparing to pilot early infant male circumcision (EIMC). This qualitative study explored the acceptability and feasibility of EIMC in Malawi in order to inform pilot implementation. Methods In 2016, 23 focus group discussions were held across Malawi with participants from several ethnicities and religions/faiths. Additionally, 21 key informant interviews were held with traditional and religious leaders, traditional circumcisers (ngalibas), policy-makers, programme managers and health-care workers. Audio recordings were transcribed, translated into English (where necessary), and thematically coded using NVivo 10. Results Discussions highlighted the socio-cultural significance of MC in Malawi. Knowledge or experience of EIMC was poor although acceptability was high among most ethnic/religious groups and key informants. Participants identified EIMC's comparative HIV benefits although a few health-care workers expressed scepticism. All participants said EIMC should be offered within a clinical setting. In addition to fathers, maternal uncles and traditional leaders were deemed key decision-makers. Potential barriers to EIMC included concerns about procedure safety as well as cultural considerations. Key informants felt it was feasible to offer EIMC in Malawi. Participants' recommendations, including phased implementation, engagement of traditional leaders, use of external mobilisers and initially reaching out to influential parents, will be taken into account when designing a pilot EIMC program. Conclusions EIMC is potentially an acceptable and feasible HIV prevention intervention for most ethnic/religious groups in Malawi if wide-ranging, culturally appropriate demand-creation activities are developed, piloted, evaluated and appropriately implemented."
https://openalex.org/W2607378359,"Independent component analysis (ICA) is a ubiquitous method for decomposing complex signal mixtures into a small set of statistically independent source signals. However, in cases in which the signal mixture consists of both nongaussian and Gaussian sources, the Gaussian sources will not be recoverable by ICA and will pollute estimates of the nongaussian sources. Therefore, it is desirable to have methods for mixed ICA/PCA which can separate mixtures of Gaussian and nongaussian sources. For mixtures of purely Gaussian sources, principal component analysis (PCA) can provide a basis for the Gaussian subspace. We introduce a new method for mixed ICA/PCA which we call Mixed ICA/PCA via Reproducibility Stability (MIPReSt). Our method uses a repeated estimations technique to rank sources by reproducibility, combined with decomposition of multiple subsamplings of the original data matrix. These multiple decompositions allow us to assess component stability as the size of the data matrix changes, which can be used to determinine the dimension of the nongaussian subspace in a mixture. We demonstrate the utility of MIPReSt for signal mixtures consisting of simulated sources and real-word (speech) sources, as well as mixture of unknown composition."
https://openalex.org/W2607005134,"A new purple quail-like (q-lp) mutant found from the plain silkworm strain 932VR has pigment dots on the epidermis similar to the pigment mutant quail (q). In addition, q-lp mutant larvae are inactive, consume little and grow slowly, with a high death rate and other developmental abnormalities. Pigmentation of the silkworm epidermis consists of melanin, ommochrome and pteridine. Silkworm development is regulated by ecdysone and juvenile hormone. In this study, we performed RNA-Seq on the epidermis of the q-lp mutant in the 4th instar during molting, with 932VR serving as the control. The results showed 515 differentially expressed genes, of which 234 were upregulated and 281 downregulated in q-lp. BLASTGO analysis indicated that the downregulated genes mainly encode protein-binding proteins, membrane components, oxidation/reduction enzymes, and proteolytic enzymes, whereas the upregulated genes largely encode cuticle structural constituents, membrane components, transport related proteins, and protein-binding proteins. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR was used to verify the accuracy of the RNA-Seq data, focusing on key genes for biosynthesis of the three pigments and chitin as well as genes encoding cuticular proteins and several related nuclear receptors, which are thought to play key roles in the q-lp mutant. We drew three conclusions based on the results: 1) melanin, ommochrome and pteridine pigments are all increased in the q-lp mutant; 2) more cuticle proteins are expressed in q-lp than in 932VR, and the number of upregulated cuticular genes is significantly greater than downregulated genes; 3) the downstream pathway regulated by ecdysone is blocked in the q-lp mutant. Our research findings lay the foundation for further research on the developmental changes responsible for the q-lp mutant."
https://openalex.org/W2607204578,"Burkholderia pseudomallei (Bpm) is a saprophytic rod-shaped gram-negative bacterium and the causative agent of melioidosis. This disease has previously been described as endemic in areas such as northern Australia and Southeast Asia, but, more recently, a better understanding of the epidemiology of melioidosis indicated that the disease is distributed worldwide, including regions of the Americas and Africa. A 16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) typing system has been developed for Bpm and has revealed that ITS types C, E, and hybrid CE are mainly associated with Australia and Southeast Asia while type G strains are more associated with cases of melioidosis in the Western Hemisphere. The purpose of the current study was to determine the in vitro and in vivo virulence profiles of the understudied Bpm type G strains Ca2009, Ca2013a, Mx2013, and 724644 and compared such phenotypes to the commonly studied Bpm type C strain K96243. We evaluated virulence by measuring invasion/uptake and survival of these Bpm strains in murine respiratory epithelial LA-4 cells and alveolar macrophage MH-S cells using different multiplicity of infections (MOIs of 1 and 10). We also calculated the lethal dose 50 values (LD50) in BALB/c mice that were inoculated intranasally with either Ca2009, Ca2013a, or Mx2013. Overall, the virulence and lethality phenotypes of Bpm type G strains were similar to the Bpm type C strain K96243. Additional comparative analyses between the Bpm ITS types may lead to a better understanding of the contribution of the ITS type to the epidemiology and ecology of Bpm strains."
https://openalex.org/W2606978257,"Loss of tissue coherency in brain white matter is found in many neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). While several approaches have been proposed to evaluate white matter coherency including fractional anisotropy and fiber tracking in diffusion-weighted imaging, few are available for standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Here we present an image post-processing method for this purpose based on Fourier transform (FT) power spectrum. T2-weighted images were collected from 19 patients (10 relapsing-remitting and 9 secondary progressive MS) and 19 age- and gender-matched controls. Image processing steps included: computation, normalization, and thresholding of FT power spectrum; determination of tissue alignment profile and dominant alignment direction; and calculation of alignment complexity using a new measure named angular entropy. To test the validity of this method, we used a highly organized brain white matter structure, corpus callosum. Six regions of interest were examined from the left, central and right aspects of both genu and splenium. We found that the dominant orientation of each ROI derived from our method was significantly correlated with the predicted directions based on anatomy. There was greater angular entropy in patients than controls, and a trend to be greater in secondary progressive MS patients. These findings suggest that it is possible to detect tissue alignment and anisotropy using traditional MRI, which are routinely acquired in clinical practice. Analysis of FT power spectrum may become a new approach for advancing the evaluation and management of patients with MS and similar disorders. Further confirmation is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2606768119,"Continuous loop averaging deconvolution (CLAD) is one of the proven methods for recovering transient auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) in rapid stimulation paradigms, which requires an elaborated stimulus sequence design to attenuate impacts from noise in data. The present study aimed to develop a new metric in gauging a CLAD sequence in terms of noise gain factor (NGF), which has been proposed previously but with less effectiveness in the presence of pink (1/f) noise. We derived the new metric by explicitly introducing the 1/f model into the proposed time-continuous sequence. We selected several representative CLAD sequences to test their noise property on typical EEG recordings, as well as on five real CLAD electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings to retrieve the middle latency responses. We also demonstrated the merit of the new metric in generating and quantifying optimized sequences using a classic genetic algorithm. The new metric shows evident improvements in measuring actual noise gains at different frequencies, and better performance than the original NGF in various aspects. The new metric is a generalized NGF measurement that can better quantify the performance of a CLAD sequence, and provide a more efficient mean of generating CLAD sequences via the incorporation with optimization algorithms. The present study can facilitate the specific application of CLAD paradigm with desired sequences in the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W2605711150,"This paper uses experimental investigation and theoretical derivation to study the unified failure mechanism and ultimate capacity model of reinforced concrete (RC) members under combined axial, bending, shear and torsion loading. Fifteen RC members are tested under different combinations of compressive axial force, bending, shear and torsion using experimental equipment designed by the authors. The failure mechanism and ultimate strength data for the four groups of tested RC members under different combined loading conditions are investigated and discussed in detail. The experimental research seeks to determine how the ultimate strength of RC members changes with changing combined loads. According to the experimental research, a unified theoretical model is established by determining the shape of the warped failure surface, assuming an appropriate stress distribution on the failure surface, and considering the equilibrium conditions. This unified failure model can be reasonably and systematically changed into well-known failure theories of concrete members under single or combined loading. The unified calculation model could be easily used in design applications with some assumptions and simplifications. Finally, the accuracy of this theoretical unified model is verified by comparisons with experimental results."
