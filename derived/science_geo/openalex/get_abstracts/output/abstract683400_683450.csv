https://openalex.org/W3210849595,"Loss of functional mitochondrial complex I (MCI) in the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra is a hallmark of Parkinson’s disease1. Yet, whether this change contributes to Parkinson’s disease pathogenesis is unclear2. Here we used intersectional genetics to disrupt the function of MCI in mouse dopaminergic neurons. Disruption of MCI induced a Warburg-like shift in metabolism that enabled neuronal survival, but triggered a progressive loss of the dopaminergic phenotype that was first evident in nigrostriatal axons. This axonal deficit was accompanied by motor learning and fine motor deficits, but not by clear levodopa-responsive parkinsonism—which emerged only after the later loss of dopamine release in the substantia nigra. Thus, MCI dysfunction alone is sufficient to cause progressive, human-like parkinsonism in which the loss of nigral dopamine release makes a critical contribution to motor dysfunction, contrary to the current Parkinson’s disease paradigm3,4. Dysfunction of mitochondrial complex I in mice is sufficient to cause progressive parkinsonism in which the loss of nigral dopamine release critically contributes to motor dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W3211239537,"Reading amino acids by nanopore Nanopore technology enables sensing of minute chemical changes at the single-molecule level by detecting differences in an ion current as molecules are drawn through a membrane-embedded pore. The sensitivity is sufficient to discriminate between nucleotide bases in nanopore sequencing, and other applications of this technology are promising. Brinkerhoff et al . developed a nanopore-based, single-molecule approach in which a protein was sequentially scanned in single-amino-acid steps through the narrow construction of a nanopore, and ion currents were monitored to resolve differences in the amino acid sequence along the peptide backbone (see the Perspective by Bošković and Keyser). The peptide reader was capable of reliably detecting single-amino-acid substitutions within individual peptides. An individual protein could be re-read many times, yielding very high read accuracy in variant identification. These proof-of-concept nanopore experiments constitute a promising basis for the development of a single-molecule protein sequencer. —DJ"
https://openalex.org/W3209742255,"Aviation and shipping currently contribute approximately 8% of total anthropogenic CO2 emissions, with growth in tourism and global trade projected to increase this contribution further1-3. Carbon-neutral transportation is feasible with electric motors powered by rechargeable batteries, but is challenging, if not impossible, for long-haul commercial travel, particularly air travel4. A promising solution are drop-in fuels (synthetic alternatives for petroleum-derived liquid hydrocarbon fuels such as kerosene, gasoline or diesel) made from H2O and CO2 by solar-driven processes5-7. Among the many possible approaches, the thermochemical path using concentrated solar radiation as the source of high-temperature process heat offers potentially high production rates and efficiencies8, and can deliver truly carbon-neutral fuels if the required CO2 is obtained directly from atmospheric air9. If H2O is also extracted from air10, feedstock sourcing and fuel production can be colocated in desert regions with high solar irradiation and limited access to water resources. While individual steps of such a scheme have been implemented, here we demonstrate the operation of the entire thermochemical solar fuel production chain, from H2O and CO2 captured directly from ambient air to the synthesis of drop-in transportation fuels (for example, methanol and kerosene), with a modular 5 kWthermal pilot-scale solar system operated under field conditions. We further identify the research and development efforts and discuss the economic viability and policies required to bring these solar fuels to market."
https://openalex.org/W3208241804,"Chemical doping is a key process for investigating charge transport in organic semiconductors and improving certain (opto)electronic devices1–9. N(electron)-doping is fundamentally more challenging than p(hole)-doping and typically achieves a very low doping efficiency (η) of less than 10%1,10. An efficient molecular n-dopant should simultaneously exhibit a high reducing power and air stability for broad applicability1,5,6,9,11, which is very challenging. Here we show a general concept of catalysed n-doping of organic semiconductors using air-stable precursor-type molecular dopants. Incorporation of a transition metal (for example, Pt, Au, Pd) as vapour-deposited nanoparticles or solution-processable organometallic complexes (for example, Pd2(dba)3) catalyses the reaction, as assessed by experimental and theoretical evidence, enabling greatly increased η in a much shorter doping time and high electrical conductivities (above 100 S cm−1; ref. 12). This methodology has technological implications for realizing improved semiconductor devices and offers a broad exploration space of ternary systems comprising catalysts, molecular dopants and semiconductors, thus opening new opportunities in n-doping research and applications12, 13. Electron doping of organic semiconductors is typically inefficient, but here a precursor molecular dopant is used to deliver higher n-doping efficiency in a much shorter doping time."
https://openalex.org/W3210402627,"Small, soluble metabolites not only are essential intermediates in intracellular biochemical processes, but can also influence neighbouring cells when released into the extracellular milieu1-3. Here we identify the metabolite and neurotransmitter GABA as a candidate signalling molecule synthesized and secreted by activated B cells and plasma cells. We show that B cell-derived GABA promotes monocyte differentiation into anti-inflammatory macrophages that secrete interleukin-10 and inhibit CD8+ T cell killer function. In mice, B cell deficiency or B cell-specific inactivation of the GABA-generating enzyme GAD67 enhances anti-tumour responses. Our study reveals that, in addition to cytokines and membrane proteins, small metabolites derived from B-lineage cells have immunoregulatory functions, which may be pharmaceutical targets allowing fine-tuning of immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W3210691815,"Immune exclusion predicts poor patient outcomes in multiple malignancies, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)1. The extracellular matrix (ECM) contributes to immune exclusion2. However, strategies to reduce ECM abundance are largely ineffective or generate undesired outcomes3,4. Here we show that discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1), a collagen receptor with tyrosine kinase activity5, instigates immune exclusion by promoting collagen fibre alignment. Ablation of Ddr1 in tumours promotes the intratumoral penetration of T cells and obliterates tumour growth in mouse models of TNBC. Supporting this finding, in human TNBC the expression of DDR1 negatively correlates with the intratumoral abundance of anti-tumour T cells. The DDR1 extracellular domain (DDR1-ECD), but not its intracellular kinase domain, is required for immune exclusion. Membrane-untethered DDR1-ECD is sufficient to rescue the growth of Ddr1-knockout tumours in immunocompetent hosts. Mechanistically, the binding of DDR1-ECD to collagen enforces aligned collagen fibres and obstructs immune infiltration. ECD-neutralizing antibodies disrupt collagen fibre alignment, mitigate immune exclusion and inhibit tumour growth in immunocompetent hosts. Together, our findings identify a mechanism for immune exclusion and suggest an immunotherapeutic target for increasing immune accessibility through reconfiguration of the tumour ECM. In mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer, the extracellular domain of the collagen receptor DDR1 has a role in tumour defence against the immune system, by aligning collagen fibres to obstruct immune infiltration."
https://openalex.org/W3209374438,"Abstract The majority of oncogenic drivers are intracellular proteins, thus constraining their immunotherapeutic targeting to mutated peptides (neoantigens) presented by individual human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allotypes 1 . However, most cancers have a modest mutational burden that is insufficient to generate responses using neoantigen-based therapies 2,3 . Neuroblastoma is a paediatric cancer that harbours few mutations and is instead driven by epigenetically deregulated transcriptional networks 4 . Here we show that the neuroblastoma immunopeptidome is enriched with peptides derived from proteins that are essential for tumourigenesis and focus on targeting the unmutated peptide QYNPIRTTF, discovered on HLA-A*24:02, which is derived from the neuroblastoma dependency gene and master transcriptional regulator PHOX2B . To target QYNPIRTTF, we developed peptide-centric chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) using a counter-panning strategy with predicted potentially cross-reactive peptides. We further hypothesized that peptide-centric CARs could recognize peptides on additional HLA allotypes when presented in a similar manner. Informed by computational modelling, we showed that PHOX2B peptide-centric CARs also recognize QYNPIRTTF presented by HLA-A*23:01 and the highly divergent HLA-B*14:02. Finally, we demonstrated potent and specific killing of neuroblastoma cells expressing these HLAs in vitro and complete tumour regression in mice. These data suggest that peptide-centric CARs have the potential to vastly expand the pool of immunotherapeutic targets to include non-immunogenic intracellular oncoproteins and widen the population of patients who would benefit from such therapy by breaking conventional HLA restriction."

https://openalex.org/W3209291978,"The discrete time crystal (DTC) is a nonequilibrium phase of matter that spontaneously breaks time-translation symmetry. Disorder-induced many-body localization can stabilize the DTC phase by breaking ergodicity and preventing thermalization. Here, we observe the hallmark signatures of the many-body–localized DTC using a quantum simulation platform based on individually controllable carbon-13 nuclear spins in diamond. We demonstrate long-lived period-doubled oscillations and confirm that they are robust for generic initial states, thus showing the characteristic time-crystalline order across the many-body spectrum. Our results are consistent with the realization of an out-of-equilibrium Floquet phase of matter and introduce a programmable quantum simulator based on solid-state spins for exploring many-body physics."
https://openalex.org/W3209709231,"Plants use seasonal temperature cues to time the transition to reproduction. In Arabidopsis thaliana, winter cold epigenetically silences the floral repressor locus FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) through POLYCOMB REPRESSIVE COMPLEX 2 (PRC2)1. This vernalization process aligns flowering with spring. A prerequisite for silencing is transcriptional downregulation of FLC, but how this occurs in the fluctuating temperature regimes of autumn is unknown2-4. Transcriptional repression correlates with decreased local levels of histone H3 trimethylation at K36 (H3K36me3) and H3 trimethylation at K4 (H3K4me3)5,6, which are deposited during FRIGIDA (FRI)-dependent activation of FLC7-10. Here we show that cold rapidly promotes the formation of FRI nuclear condensates that do not colocalize with an active FLC locus. This correlates with reduced FRI occupancy at the FLC promoter and FLC repression. Warm temperature spikes reverse this process, buffering FLC shutdown to prevent premature flowering. The accumulation of condensates in the cold is affected by specific co-transcriptional regulators and cold induction of a specific isoform of the antisense RNA COOLAIR5,11. Our work describes the dynamic partitioning of a transcriptional activator conferring plasticity in response to natural temperature fluctuations, thus enabling plants to effectively monitor seasonal progression."
https://openalex.org/W3209414730,"The state of somatic energy stores in metazoans is communicated to the brain, which regulates key aspects of behaviour, growth, nutrient partitioning and development1. The central melanocortin system acts through melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) to control appetite, food intake and energy expenditure2. Here we present evidence that MC3R regulates the timing of sexual maturation, the rate of linear growth and the accrual of lean mass, which are all energy-sensitive processes. We found that humans who carry loss-of-function mutations in MC3R, including a rare homozygote individual, have a later onset of puberty. Consistent with previous findings in mice, they also had reduced linear growth, lean mass and circulating levels of IGF1. Mice lacking Mc3r had delayed sexual maturation and an insensitivity of reproductive cycle length to nutritional perturbation. The expression of Mc3r is enriched in hypothalamic neurons that control reproduction and growth, and expression increases during postnatal development in a manner that is consistent with a role in the regulation of sexual maturation. These findings suggest a bifurcating model of nutrient sensing by the central melanocortin pathway with signalling through MC4R controlling the acquisition and retention of calories, whereas signalling through MC3R primarily regulates the disposition of calories into growth, lean mass and the timing of sexual maturation."
https://openalex.org/W3208342997,"Symbiotic N2-fixing microorganisms have a crucial role in the assimilation of nitrogen by eukaryotes in nitrogen-limited environments1-3. Particularly among land plants, N2-fixing symbionts occur in a variety of distantly related plant lineages and often involve an intimate association between host and symbiont2,4. Descriptions of such intimate symbioses are lacking for seagrasses, which evolved around 100 million years ago from terrestrial flowering plants that migrated back to the sea5. Here we describe an N2-fixing symbiont, 'Candidatus Celerinatantimonas neptuna', that lives inside seagrass root tissue, where it provides ammonia and amino acids to its host in exchange for sugars. As such, this symbiosis is reminiscent of terrestrial N2-fixing plant symbioses. The symbiosis between Ca. C. neptuna and its host Posidonia oceanica enables highly productive seagrass meadows to thrive in the nitrogen-limited Mediterranean Sea. Relatives of Ca. C. neptuna occur worldwide in coastal ecosystems, in which they may form similar symbioses with other seagrasses and saltmarsh plants. Just like N2-fixing microorganisms might have aided the colonization of nitrogen-poor soils by early land plants6, the ancestors of Ca. C. neptuna and its relatives probably enabled flowering plants to invade nitrogen-poor marine habitats, where they formed extremely efficient blue carbon ecosystems7."
https://openalex.org/W3208538415,"The ability to suppress actions that lead to a negative outcome and explore alternative actions is necessary for optimal decision making. Although the basal ganglia have been implicated in these processes1–5, the circuit mechanisms underlying action selection and exploration remain unclear. Here, using a simple lateralized licking task, we show that indirect striatal projection neurons (iSPN) in the basal ganglia contribute to these processes through modulation of the superior colliculus (SC). Optogenetic activation of iSPNs suppresses contraversive licking and promotes ipsiversive licking. Activity in lateral superior colliculus (lSC), a region downstream of the basal ganglia, is necessary for task performance and predicts lick direction. Furthermore, iSPN activation suppresses ipsilateral lSC, but surprisingly excites contralateral lSC, explaining the emergence of ipsiversive licking. Optogenetic inactivation reveals inter-collicular competition whereby each hemisphere of the superior colliculus inhibits the other, thus allowing the indirect pathway to disinhibit the contralateral lSC and trigger licking. Finally, inactivating iSPNs impairs suppression of devalued but previously rewarded licking and reduces exploratory licking. Our results reveal that iSPNs engage the competitive interaction between lSC hemispheres to trigger a motor action and suggest a general circuit mechanism for exploration during action selection. Indirect striatal projection neurons in the basal ganglia modulate activity in the superior colliculus, thereby controlling selection and exploration of actions in response to a reward omission."

https://openalex.org/W3154835818,"Amorphous-amorphous transformations under pressure are generally explained by changes in the local structure from low- to higher-fold coordinated polyhedra1-4. However, as the notion of scale invariance at the critical thresholds has not been addressed, it is still unclear whether these transformations behave similarly to true phase transitions in related crystals and liquids. Here we report ab initio-based calculations of compressed silica (SiO2) glasses, showing that the structural changes from low- to high-density amorphous structures occur through a sequence of percolation transitions. When the pressure is increased to 82 GPa, a series of long-range ('infinite') percolating clusters composed of corner- or edge-shared tetrahedra, pentahedra and eventually octahedra emerge at critical pressures and replace the previous 'phase' of lower-fold coordinated polyhedra and lower connectivity. This mechanism provides a natural explanation for the well-known mechanical anomaly around 3 GPa, as well as the structural irreversibility beyond 10 GPa, among other features. Some of the amorphous structures that have been discovered mimic those of coesite IV and V crystals reported recently5,6, highlighting the major role of SiO5 pentahedron-based polyamorphs in the densification process of vitreous silica. Our results demonstrate that percolation theory provides a robust framework to understand the nature and pathway of amorphous-amorphous transformations and open a new avenue to predict unravelled amorphous solid states and related liquid phases7,8."
https://openalex.org/W3209318039,"Expanded use of novel oil extraction technologies has increased the variability of petroleum resources and diversified the carbon footprint of the global oil supply1. Past life-cycle assessment (LCA) studies overlooked upstream emission heterogeneity by assuming that a decline in oil demand will displace average crude oil2. We explore the life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions impacts of marginal crude sources, identifying the upstream carbon intensity (CI) of the producers most sensitive to an oil demand decline (for example, due to a shift to alternative vehicles). We link econometric models of production profitability of 1,933 oilfields (~90% of the 2015 world supply) with their production CI. Then, we examine their response to a decline in demand under three oil market structures. According to our estimates, small demand shocks have different upstream CI implications than large shocks. Irrespective of the market structure, small shocks (−2.5% demand) displace mostly heavy crudes with ~25–54% higher CI than that of the global average. However, this imbalance diminishes as the shocks become bigger and if producers with market power coordinate their response to a demand decline. The carbon emissions benefits of reduction in oil demand are systematically dependent on the magnitude of demand drop and the global oil market structure. Here the non-linear relationship is revealed between carbon emissions reductions and oil demand reductions, which depends on the magnitude of demand drop and the global oil market structure."
https://openalex.org/W3211266281,"A key goal for society as a whole is the pursuit of well-being, which leads to the happiness of its individual members; as such, it is of critical socioeconomic relevance. In this regard, it is important to study which factors primarily affect the happiness of the population. In principle, these factors are associated with income level and residential and job stability, or more specifically, citizens’ quality of life. This research, which is based on a multidimensional concept of quality of life, uses a regression model to explain the dependence of Spaniards’ happiness on the well-being or quality of life provided by their work, their family situation, their income level and aspects of their place of residence, among other factors. The data were collected through an anonymous survey administered to a representative sample of Spanish citizens. The methodology used approaches the intangible concept of happiness as resulting from different individual and social causes selected from dimensions addressed in the literature, and calculates their effects or importance through regression coefficients. One of the findings is that people with the highest level of well-being or quality of life in the most important dimensions mostly claim to be happy. With respect to gender, it has a significant influence on the dimensions included in the model of citizen happiness and on personal issues. It is also shown that the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic negatively influenced the quality of life of Spanish citizens and therefore their happiness."
https://openalex.org/W3208915400,"COVID-19 continues to pose a threat to global public health. Multiple safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19 are available with one-third of the global population now vaccinated. Achieving a sufficient level of vaccine coverage to suppress COVID-19 requires, in part, sufficient acceptance among the public. However, relatively high rates of hesitance and resistance to COVID-19 vaccination persists, threating public health efforts to achieve vaccine-induced population protection. In this study, we examined longitudinal changes in COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, hesitance, and resistance in two nations (the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland) during the first nine months of the pandemic, and identified individual and psychological factors associated with consistent non-acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination. Using nationally representative, longitudinal data from the United Kingdom (UK; N = 2025) and Ireland (N = 1041), we found that (1) COVID-19 vaccine acceptance declined in the UK and remained unchanged in Ireland following the emergence of approved vaccines; (2) multiple subgroups existed reflecting people who were consistently willing to be vaccinated ('Accepters': 68% in the UK and 61% in Ireland), consistently unwilling to be vaccinated ('Deniers': 12% in the UK and 16% in Ireland), and who fluctuated over time ('Moveable Middle': 20% in the UK and 23% in Ireland); and (3) the 'deniers' and 'moveable middle' were distinguishable from the 'accepters' on a range of individual (e.g., younger, low income, living alone) and psychological (e.g., distrust of scientists and doctors, conspiracy mindedness) factors. The use of two high-income, Western European nations limits the generalizability of these findings. Nevertheless, understanding how receptibility to COVID-19 vaccination changes as the pandemic unfolds, and the factors that distinguish and characterise those that are hesitant and resistant to vaccination is helpful for public health efforts to achieve vaccine-induced population protection against COVID-19."

https://openalex.org/W3154617622,"Hosta ventricosa is a robust ornamental perennial plant that can tolerate low temperatures, and which is widely used in urban landscaping design in Northeast China. However, the mechanism of cold-stress tolerance in this species is unclear. A combination of transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis was used to explore the mechanism of low-temperature tolerance in H. ventricosa. A total of 12 059 differentially expressed genes and 131 differentially expressed metabolites were obtained, which were mainly concentrated in the signal transduction and phenylpropanoid metabolic pathways. In the process of low-temperature signal transduction, possibly by transmitting Ca2+ inside and outside the cell through the ion channels on the three cell membranes of COLD, CNGCs and CRLK, H. ventricosa senses temperature changes and stimulates SCRM to combine with DREB through the MAPK signal pathway and Ca2+ signal sensors such as CBL, thus strengthening its low-temperature resistance. The pathways of phenylpropanoid and flavonoid metabolism represent the main mechanism of low-temperature tolerance in this species. The plant protects itself from low-temperature damage by increasing its content of genistein, scopolentin and scopolin. It is speculated that H. ventricosa can also adjust the content ratio of sinapyl alcohol and coniferyl alcohol and thereby alter the morphological structure of its cell walls and so increase its resistance to low temperatures.When subjected to low-temperature stress, H. ventricosa perceives temperature changes via COLD, CNGCs and CRLK, and protection from low-temperature damage is achieved by an increase in the levels of genistein, scopolentin and scopolin through the pathways of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W3208236437,"A central goal of condensed-matter physics is to understand how the diverse electronic and optical properties of crystalline materials emerge from the wavelike motion of electrons through periodically arranged atoms. However, more than 90 years after Bloch derived the functional forms of electronic waves in crystals [1] (now known as Bloch wavefunctions), rapid scattering processes have so far prevented their direct experimental reconstruction. In high-order sideband generation [2-9], electrons and holes generated in semiconductors by a near-infrared laser are accelerated to a high kinetic energy by a strong terahertz field, and recollide to emit near-infrared sidebands before they are scattered. Here we reconstruct the Bloch wavefunctions of two types of hole in gallium arsenide at wavelengths much longer than the spacing between atoms by experimentally measuring sideband polarizations and introducing an elegant theory that ties those polarizations to quantum interference between different recollision pathways. These Bloch wavefunctions are compactly visualized on the surface of a sphere. High-order sideband generation can, in principle, be observed from any direct-gap semiconductor or insulator. We thus expect that the method introduced here can be used to reconstruct low-energy Bloch wavefunctions in many of these materials, enabling important insights into the origin and engineering of the electronic and optical properties of condensed matter."
https://openalex.org/W3210028538,"Previous research suggests that less emotionally stable, less conscientious, less extraverted, and less agreeable women tend to suffer from higher fear of childbirth and experience their delivery as worse. Moreover, there is evidence that birth characteristics and unexpected incidents during delivery may impact women's birth experiences. However, it remains unknown whether the role of personality in subjective birth experiences varies between women with different birth characteristics.We used data from the Maternal Anxiety in Relation to Infant Development (MARI) Study, a regional-epidemiological study among pregnant women, who were prospectively followed up in multiple waves across the peripartum period. During pregnancy, personality was assessed with the short version of the Big Five Inventory. The Wijma Delivery Expectancy/ Experience Questionnaire was used to measure fear of childbirth (version A) during pregnancy and subjective birth experiences (version B) within the first 10 days after delivery.Linear regressions revealed that lower levels of emotional stability, agreeableness, and extraversion predicted higher fear of childbirth during pregnancy. Moreover, personality affected subjective birth experiences especially in women with specific birth characteristics: Lower emotional stability predicted worse subjective birth experiences in women with (vs. without) a preterm delivery, and higher conscientiousness predicted worse subjective birth experiences in women with an emergency cesarean section (vs. spontaneous delivery). Subjective birth experiences were also worse in less emotionally stable and less open women with (general) anesthesia (vs. no anesthesia) during delivery. Finally, higher emotional stability predicted a subjective birth experience that was worse than expected, particularly in multiparous women and women without anesthesia during delivery.These findings suggest that less emotionally stable, less conscientious, and less open women tend to experience their delivery as worse particularly in case of unexpected incidents (i.e., preterm delivery, emergency cesarean section, and necessity of anesthetics) and might thus profit from early targeted interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3212784178,"Earth's distant past and potentially its future include extremely warm 'hothouse'1 climate states, but little is known about how the atmosphere behaves in such states. One distinguishing characteristic of hothouse climates is that they feature lower-tropospheric radiative heating, rather than cooling, due to the closing of the water vapour infrared window regions2. Previous work has suggested that this could lead to temperature inversions and substantial changes in cloud cover3-6, but no previous modelling of the hothouse regime has resolved convective-scale turbulent air motions and cloud cover directly, thus leaving many questions about hothouse radiative heating unanswered. Here we conduct simulations that explicitly resolve convection and find that lower-tropospheric radiative heating in hothouse climates causes the hydrologic cycle to shift from a quasi-steady regime to a 'relaxation oscillator' regime, in which precipitation occurs in short and intense outbursts separated by multi-day dry spells. The transition to the oscillatory regime is accompanied by strongly enhanced local precipitation fluxes, a substantial increase in cloud cover, and a transiently positive (unstable) climate feedback parameter. Our results indicate that hothouse climates may feature a novel form of 'temporal' convective self-organization, with implications for both cloud coverage and erosion processes."

The effective sample size for the present paper 699,686 women aged 15-49 years in India. Descriptive statistics along with bivariate analysis were used to do the preliminary analysis. Additionally, binary logistic regression analysis was used to fulfil the objectives.About 1.6% of women had multimorbidity in India. The prevalence of multimorbidity was high among women from southern region of India. Women who smoke tobacco, chew tobacco and consume alcohol had 87% [AOR: 1.87CI: 1.65, 2.10], 18% [AOR: 1.18; CI: 1.10, 1.26] and 18% [AOR: 1.18; CI: 1.04, 1.33] significantly higher likelihood to suffer from multi-morbidity than their counterparts respectively.

https://openalex.org/W3211333391,"Coastal land reclamation (CLR), particularly port reclamation, is a common approach to alleviating land shortages. However, the spatial extent, percentages, and processes of these newly reclaimed ports are largely unknown. The Bohai Sea is the most concentrated area of port reclamation worldwide. Thus, this study addresses the changes in the different coastline types and port reclamation process in the area. The reclamation area of the 13 ports in the Bohai Sea in 2002-2018 was 2,300 km2, which decreased the area of the sea by 3%. The natural coastline length in Tianjin decreased by 47.5 km, whereas the artificial coastline length increased by 46.6 km. Based on the port boundary, however, only 26.3% of the reclaimed areas have been used for port construction, which concentrates in the Tianjin and Tangshan ports. The ratio of built-up area within the ports is only 32.5%, and approximately 48.3% of the reclaimed areas have no construction projects. The port land reclamation in the Bohai Sea has been undergoing periods of acceleration, peak, deceleration, and stagnation since 2002. Hence, future port reclamation should not be totally prohibited, and fine management should be conducted based on the optimization of the reclaimed port area. The innovation of this research is its analysis of the port internal land use pattern, the percentage of built-up area in the ports, and the sustainability of port reclamation policies. The findings have vital implications for scientifically regulating the spatial pattern and exploring the utility of port reclamation."

Aiming to understand the roles of EVs in bovine reproductive tract, we intended to characterize and profile the EVs of oviduct and uterine fluids (OF-EVs, UF-EVs) and their miRNA across the estrous cycle. Nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy confirmed the existence of small EV population in OF and UF at all stages, (size between 30 and 200 nm; concentration: 3.4 × 1010 EVs/ml and 6.0 × 1010 EVs/ml for OF and UF, respectively, regardless of stage). The identification of EV markers (CD9, HSP70, and ALIX proteins) was confirmed by western blot. The miRNA analysis revealed the abundance of 310 and 351 miRNAs in OF-EVs and UF-EVs, respectively. Nine miRNAs were differentially abundant in OF-EVs between stages of the cycle, eight of them displayed a progressive increase from S1 to S4 (p < .05). In UF-EVs, a total of 14 miRNAs were differentially abundant between stages. Greater differences were observed between stage 1 (S1) and stage 3 (S3), with 11 miRNAs enriched in S3 compared to S1. Functional enrichment analysis revealed the involvement of these miRNAs in relevant pathways such as cell signaling, intercellular junctions, and reproductive functions that may be implicated in oviduct and uterus modulation across the cycle, but also in their preparation for embryo/conceptus presence and development."

Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, thematically coded and analysed using a grounded theory approach.Ways of socialising, concerns over appearance while being physically active, safety concerns and prioritising educational attainment in adolescence were all described as barriers to physical activity in second-generation British Indian women. Facilitators for physical activity included acknowledging the importance of taking time out for oneself; religious beliefs and religious groups promoting activity; being prompted by family illness; positive messages in both the media and while at school, and having local facilities to use.Barriers to physical activity in second-generation Indian women were very similar to those already reported for White British women. Public health measures aimed at women in the general population may also positively affect second-generation Indian women. First-generation Indian women, second-generation children and Muslim women may respond better to culturally tailored interventions."

It was noteworthy that among all bacteria previously isolated from the same origin, only Curtobacterium sp. GD1 showed a strong chitinase activity. The enzyme was secreted and its production was induced by the presence of colloidal chitin in the medium. The chitinase was partially purified and characterized: molecular weight was approximately 37 kDa and specific activity 90.8 U/mg. Furthermore, Curtobacterium sp. GD1 genome was sequenced and analyzed. Our isolate formed a phylogenetic cluster with four other Curtobacterium spp. strains, with ANIb/ANIm ≥ 98%, representing a new, still non described Curtobacterium species. The circular genome visualization and comparison of genome sequences of strains forming new cluster indicated that most regions within their genomes were highly conserved. The gene associated with chitinase production was identified and the distribution pattern of glycosyl hydrolases genes was assessed. Also, genes associated with catabolism of structural carbohydrates such as oligosaccharides, mixed polysaccharides, plant and animal polysaccharides, as well as genes or gene clusters associated with resistance to antibiotics, toxic compounds and auxin biosynthesis subsystem products were identified. The abundance of putative glycosyl hydrolases in the genome of Curtobacterium sp. GD1 suggests that it has the tools for the hydrolysis of different polysaccharides. Therefore, Curtobacterium sp. GD1 isolated from soybean might be a bioremediator, biocontrol agent, an elicitor of the plant defense responses or simply degrader."

It has demonstrated superiority in the charts properly placed to record P5VS, in the number of emergency departments recording P5VS, in the regularity of audits, and in the existence of guidelines and staff training on pain assessment and management.The standardization of both evaluation and recording of pain intensity constitutes a measure of good clinical practice. Public hospitals demonstrated better commitment to these procedures that should be properly carried out in all health care institutions."
https://openalex.org/W3209838404,"A hallmark of celiac disease is the gluten-dependent production of antibodies specific for deamidated gluten peptides (DGP) and the enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2). Both types of antibodies are believed to result from B cells receiving help from gluten-specific CD4+ T cells and differentiating into antibody-producing plasma cells. We have here studied the collaboration between DGP- and TG2-specific B cells with gluten-specific CD4+ T cells using transgenic mice expressing celiac patient-derived T-cell and B-cell receptors, as well as between B-cell transfectants and patient-derived gluten-specific T-cell clones. We show that multivalent TG2-gluten complexes are efficient antigens for both TG2-specific and DGP-specific B cells and allow both types of B cells to receive help from gluten-specific T cells of many different specificities."
https://openalex.org/W3210659843,"Protecting secrets is a key challenge in our contemporary information-based era. In common situations, however, revealing secrets appears unavoidable; for instance, when identifying oneself in a bank to retrieve money. In turn, this may have highly undesirable consequences in the unlikely, yet not unrealistic, case where the bank’s security gets compromised. This naturally raises the question of whether disclosing secrets is fundamentally necessary for identifying oneself, or more generally for proving a statement to be correct. Developments in computer science provide an elegant solution via the concept of zero-knowledge proofs: a prover can convince a verifier of the validity of a certain statement without facilitating the elaboration of a proof at all1. In this work, we report the experimental realization of such a zero-knowledge protocol involving two separated verifier–prover pairs2. Security is enforced via the physical principle of special relativity3, and no computational assumption (such as the existence of one-way functions) is required. Our implementation exclusively relies on off-the-shelf equipment and works at both short (60 m) and long distances (≥400 m) in about one second. This demonstrates the practical potential of multi-prover zero-knowledge protocols, promising for identification tasks and blockchain applications such as cryptocurrencies or smart contracts4. A zero-knowledge proof, which can be used to verify secret information, is reported here with security that is enforced by the laws of special relativity."
https://openalex.org/W3209455613,"Despite several attempts to provide a definite pattern regarding the effects of personality traits on performance in higher education, the debate over the nature of the relationship is far from being conclusive. The use of different subject pools and sample sizes, as well as the use of identification strategies that either do not adequately account for selection bias or are unable to establish causality between measures of academic performance and noncognitive skills, are possible sources of heterogeneity. This paper investigates the impact of the Big Five traits, as measured before the beginning of the academic year, on the grade point average achieved in the first year after the enrolment, taking advantage of a unique and large dataset from a cohort of Italian students in all undergraduate programs containing detailed information on student and parental characteristics. Relying on a robust strategy to credibly satisfy the conditional independence assumption, we find that higher levels of conscientiousness and openness to experience positively affect student score."

https://openalex.org/W3208443298,"The Caribbean is a genetically diverse region with heterogeneous admixture compositions influenced by local island ecologies, migrations, colonial conflicts, and demographic histories. The Commonwealth of Dominica is a mountainous island in the Lesser Antilles historically known to harbor communities with unique patterns of migration, mixture, and isolation. This community-based population genetic study adds biological evidence to inform post-colonial narrative histories in a Dominican horticultural village. High density single nucleotide polymorphism data paired with a previously compiled genealogy provide the first genome-wide insights on genetic ancestry and population structure in Dominica. We assessed family-based clustering, inferred global ancestry, and dated recent admixture by implementing the fastSTRUCTURE clustering algorithm, modeling graph-based migration with TreeMix, assessing patterns of linkage disequilibrium decay with ALDER, and visualizing data from Dominica with Human Genome Diversity Panel references. These analyses distinguish family-based genetic structure from variation in African, European, and indigenous Amerindian admixture proportions, and analyses of linkage disequilibrium decay estimate admixture dates 5–6 generations (~160 years) ago. African ancestry accounts for the largest mixture components, followed by European and then indigenous components; however, our global ancestry inferences are consistent with previous mitochondrial, Y chromosome, and ancestry marker data from Dominica that show uniquely higher proportions of indigenous ancestry and lower proportions of African ancestry relative to known admixture in other French- and English-speaking Caribbean islands. Our genetic results support local narratives about the community’s history and founding, which indicate that newly emancipated people settled in the steep, dense vegetation along Dominica’s eastern coast in the mid-19 th century. Strong genetic signals of post-colonial admixture and family-based structure highlight the localized impacts of colonial forces and island ecologies in this region, and more data from other groups are needed to more broadly inform on Dominica’s complex history and present diversity."
https://openalex.org/W3210897588,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has become standard of care for cisplatin-eligible patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer qualified to radical cystectomy, providing a modest increase in 5-year overall survival rate. Several regimens are being employed for neoadjuvant treatment, largely because of their efficacy in metastatic setting. There is however a scarcity of evidence on the optimal cytotoxic regimen for neoadjuvant chemotherapy.We evaluated the efficacy of different protocols of neoadjuvant chemotherapy amongst patients who underwent radical cystectomy at our institution.This is a single-center, retrospective, observational study including a cohort of 220 patients who underwent radical cystectomy between 2014 and 2020. The neoadjuvant chemotherapy cohort included 79 patients and was compared to the cohort of historical controls including 141 patients operated prior to routine administration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and those who opted for upfront surgery.Administration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy decreased the risk of overall and cancer-specific mortality HR = 0.625 (95% CI 0.414-0.944), p = 0.025 and HR = 0.579 (95% CI 0.348-0.964), p = 0.036. Rates of downstaging, complete responses, lymph node metastasis, extravesical extension and positive surgical margins significantly favored neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Out of cytotoxic regimens, dose-dense MVAC and gemcitabine-cisplatin were similarly efficacious providing 46.9% and 50% of downstaging to <ypT2N0 respectively, including 30.6% and 25% of complete remissions. However, only dose-dense MVAC was associated with reduction of all-cause and cancer specific mortality risk HR = 0.385 (95% CI 0.214-0.691) p = 0.001 and HR = 0.336 (95% CI 0.160-0.703), p = 0.004 respectively.Our study implies that neoadjuvant chemotherapy with subsequent radical cystectomy provides significant improvement over upfront surgery in locoregional control and long-term prognosis of muscle-invasive bladder cancer. The urologic community should strive to maximize utilization of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, yet further research, including randomized control trials, is needed to validate superiority of dose-dense MVAC as the preferred regimen for cisplatin-eligible patients."
https://openalex.org/W3211242631,"It is currently unknown which attitude-based profiles are associated with symptom checker use for self-triage. We sought to identify, among university students, attitude-based latent classes (population profiles) and the association between latent classes with the future use of symptom checkers for self-triage. Informed by the Technology Acceptance Model and a larger mixed methods study, a cross-sectional survey was developed and administered to students (aged between 18 and 34 years of age) at a University in Ontario. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify attitude-based profiles that exist among the sample while general linear modeling was applied to identify the association between latent classes and future symptom checker use for self-triage. Of the 1,547 students who opened the survey link, 1,365 did not use a symptom checker in the past year and were thus identified as ""non-users"". After removing missing data (remaining sample = n = 1,305), LCA revealed five attitude-based profiles: tech acceptors, tech rejectors, skeptics, tech seekers, and unsure acceptors. Tech acceptors and tech rejectors were the most and least prevalent classes, respectively. As compared to tech rejectors, tech seekers and unsure acceptors were the latent classes with the highest and lowest odds of future symptom checker use, respectively. After controlling for confounders, the effect of latent classes on symptom checker use remains significant (p-value < .0001) with the odds of future use in tech acceptors being 5.6 times higher than the odds of future symptom checker use in tech rejectors [CI: (3.458, 9.078); p-value < .0001]. Attitudes towards AI and symptom checker functionality result in different population profiles that have different odds of using symptom checkers for self-triage. Identifying a person's or group's membership to a population profile could help in developing and delivering tailored interventions aimed at maximizing use of validated symptom checkers."
https://openalex.org/W3211260046,"Sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), a parasitic fish which survives on blood of other fishes, is consumed as a delicacy in many countries. Our earlier studies on sea lamprey compounds that showed potential to deter adult sea lampreys yielded several sterols, glycerides, free fatty acids, amino acids, organic acids and nitrogenous compounds. Therefore, this study was to assess the health-benefits of these compounds including additional isolates from HPLC fractions that kept aside due to lack of activity in sea lamprey deterrent assays. In vitro cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and -2) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) inhibitory assays, respectively, were used to determine antiinflammatory and antioxidant activities. Among the tested sterols, cholesteryl eicosapentaenoate and cholesteryl arachidonate exhibited IC50 values of 14.6 and 17.7 μg/mL for COX-1 and 17.3 and 20.8 μg/mL for COX-2, respectively. Cholesteryl palmitate and cholesteryl oleate showed moderate COX-1 and COX-2 enzyme inhibition at 25 μg/mL. Amino acids arginine, tyrosine, glutamic acid, tryptophan and asparagine also showed moderate COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition at the same concentration. Among the twelve new isolates from fractions that we did not investigate earlier, a novel uracil derivative petromyzonacil showed COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition at 25 μg/mL by 35 and 15%, respectively. Cholesterol esters tested at 25 μg/mL exhibited LPO inhibition between 38 and 82 percent. Amino acids cysteine, methionine, aspartic acid, threonine, tryptophan, histidine, glutamic acid, phenylalanine and tyrosine at 25 μg/mL showed LPO inhibition between 37 and 58% and petromyzonacil by 32%. These assay results indicate that consumption of sea lamprey offer health-benefits in addition to nutritional benefits."
https://openalex.org/W4225960507,"Adipose tissue is the primary site of energy storage, playing important roles in health. While adipose research largely focuses on obesity, fat also has other critical functions, producing adipocytokines and contributing to normal nutrient metabolism, which in turn play important roles in satiety and total energy homeostasis. SMAD2/3 proteins are downstream mediators of activin signaling, which regulate critical preadipocyte and mature adipocyte functions. Smad2 global knockout mice exhibit embryonic lethality, whereas global loss of Smad3 protects mice against diet-induced obesity. The direct contributions of Smad2 and Smad3 in adipose tissues, however, are unknown. Here, we sought to determine the primary effects of adipocyte-selective reduction of Smad2 or Smad3 on diet-induced adiposity using Smad2 or Smad3 ""floxed"" mice intercrossed with Adiponectin-Cre mice. Additionally, we examined visceral and subcutaneous preadipocyte differentiation efficiency in vitro. Almost all wild type subcutaneous preadipocytes differentiated into mature adipocytes. In contrast, visceral preadipocytes differentiated poorly. Exogenous activin A suppressed differentiation of preadipocytes from both depots. Smad2 conditional knockout (Smad2cKO) mice did not exhibit significant effects on weight gain, irrespective of diet, whereas Smad3 conditional knockout (Smad3cKO) male mice displayed a trend of reduced body weight on high-fat diet. On both diets, Smad3cKO mice displayed an adipose depot-selective phenotype, with a significant reduction in subcutaneous fat mass but not visceral fat mass. Our data suggest that Smad3 is an important contributor to the maintenance of subcutaneous white adipose tissue in a sex-selective fashion. These findings have implications for understanding SMAD-mediated, depot selective regulation of adipocyte growth and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W3209541317,"Regardless of the issue, most of the research carried out on summer pastures of European Alps had to consider the effects of grazing management, as it is an intrinsic component of alpine environment. The management intensity of grazing livestock is measured in terms of livestock stocking rate, but not always a direct measure of it is easily retrievable. Therefore, the aim of the research was to test the reliability of proxies easily retrievable from open data sources (i.e. slope and distance from buildings) in approximating the pastoral site-use intensity. To test the proxies' effectiveness two different approaches were used. With the first one, the proxies' reliability was assessed in a case-study conducted at farm scale by using the number of positions gathered with GPS collars, which are a reliable measure of livestock site-use intensity. With the second, the proxies' reliability was assessed by means of five Vegetation Ecological Groups (VEGs), used as a tool for indirect quantification of livestock site-use intensity at regional scale (thirty-two alpine valleys of the Western Italian Alps, Piedmont Region-Italy). At farm scale, distance from buildings and slope were both reliable predictors of the number of GPS locations as assessed with a Generalized Additive Model. Results of Generalized Linear Models at the regional scale showed that the values of both the slope and the distance from buildings were able to separate VEGs along the same site-use intensity gradient assessed by modelling the number of GPS locations at farm scale. By testing proxies' reliability both with a direct (i.e. GPS collar positions) and indirect (i.e. VEGs) measurement of livestock site-use intensity, results indicated that slope and distance from buildings can be considered effective surrogates of site-use intensity gradient in alpine grasslands managed under livestock grazing. Therefore, when the level of site-use intensity in research carried out in alpine summer pastures is not directly available, a reliable solution consists in the use of the terrain slope and the distance from buildings, which are also easily retrievable from open data sources or computable."

In initial experiments, a five-factor Plackett-Burman design including 12 experimental runs was tested against the total polyphenolic content (TP). Amongst, XA: extraction temperature, XC: solvent concentration and XE: sample-to-solvent ratio had shown significant influence on yield. These influential factors were further subject to a three-factor-three-level Box-Wilson Central Composite Design; including 20 experimental runs and 3D response surface methodology plots were used to determine optimum conditions [i.e. XA: (80°C), XC:(87%), XE: (1g/40ml)].This optimized condition was further used in other Quercus species of western Himalaya, India. The High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) revealed occurrence of 12 polyphenols in six screened Quercus species with the highest concentration of catechin followed by gallic acid. Amongest, Q. franchetii and Q. serrata shared maximum numbers of polyphenolic antioxidants (8 in each). This optimized extraction condition of Quercus species can be utilized for precise quantification of polyphenols and their use in pharmaceutical industries as a potential substitute of synthetic polyphenols."

Given that existing PV animal models only recapitulate aspects of the disease, we aimed to establish a more comprehensive disease model based on the immunization of mice with PV autoantigen(s).The following immunization strategies were tested: (i) C57Bl/6J, B6.SJL-H2s C3c/1CyJ, DBA2/J, or SJL/J mice were immunized with recombinant murine Dsg3 (mDsg3), (ii) DBA2/J and SJL/J mice were immunized with mDsg3 and additionally injected a single non-blister inducing dose of exfoliative toxin A (ETA), and (iii) DBA2/J and SJL/J mice were immunized with human Dsg (hDsg) 1 and 3.Despite the induction of autoantibodies in each immunization protocol, the mice did not develop a clinical phenotype. Tissue-bound autoantibodies were not detected in the skin or mucosa. Circulating autoantibodies did not bind to the native antigen in indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using monkey esophagus as a substrate.Immunization with PV autoantigens induced non-pathogenic Dsg1/3 antibodies, but did not cause skin/mucous membrane disease in mice. These findings, confirmed by failure of binding of the induced autoantibodies to their target in the skin, suggest that the autoantibodies which were formed were unable to bind to the conformational epitope present in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3211009362,"Germany is among the largest countries in the world in terms of total GDP, owing largely to rapid industrialization and expansion of economic activities into several sectors. This paper contributes to the literature on German economic development by investigating the evolution of industry diversification in Germany; particularly focusing on the recent concepts of related (RV) and unrelated variety (UV) in West German regions. It also identifies the statistical and economic determinants of variation in variety over time. Among several industry structure measures; RV is the only measure that reveals a pronounced increasing trend. Since RV is composed of two parts: 1) entropy at five-digit within a two-digit classification, and 2) shares of two-digit sectors in total output, we examined which of the two components dominate. Our findings suggest that the entropy component within two-digit sectoral shares of the RV index is more dominant than the two-digit sectoral shares themselves. We further examined entries and exits of the firms among regions with top and bottom rankings in RV. Findings suggest that both the top and bottom regions experienced an increase in the total number of industries, however, exits were much less pronounced in the bottom regions. It suggests that an increase in variety among top regions is the result of the creative destruction type effect where new industries force inefficient old industries to leave the region. Finally, analysis shows support for the inverse u-shaped relationship between development and diversification."

Informed consent was obtained from the HCPs, and a structured questionnaire was thereafter administered. Data were analysed using SPSS® version 25. Factors associated with knowledge of the HCPs were determined using logistic regression analysis.Of the 459 participants, 22.2% (n = 102) were doctors, 11.3% (n = 52) pharmacists, 63.8% (n = 293) nurses and 2.6% (n = 12) dietitians. Most of the HCPs were females 79.7% (n = 366), the mean age of the HCPs was 38.61±0.48. The knowledge score of the HCPs was 22.66±0.25 out of an overall score of 46. The HCPs poorly identified food types that interact with drugs and correct administration time of drugs relative to meals.

SGUS findings of four major salivary glands (bilateral parotid and submandibular glands) were scored in five categories and compared between ACA-positive and ACA-negative pSS patients. Linear regression analysis was performed to elucidate the factors associated with SGUS score.In total, 121 pSS patients were enrolled (19, ACA-positive). The ACA-positive patients were older (67.0 vs 58.0 years, P = 0.028), whereas anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB positivity was more prevalent in the ACA-negative group (89.2% vs 21.1%, P < 0.001, and 47.1% vs 10.5%, P = 0.007, respectively). The total SGUS and hypoechoic area scores were lower in ACA-positive patients (16.0 vs 23.0, P = 0.027, and 4.0 vs 7.0, P = 0.004, respectively). In univariate regression analysis, being positive for unstimulated salivary flow rate (USFR < 1.5 ml/15 min), anti-Ro/SSA, and rheumatoid factor were positively associated whereas ACA positivity was negatively associated with the SGUS score.

Research have included analysis-based cultivation of soil-microbial-plant relationships to clarify microbiota potential. The goal of the research was to (i) evaluate the symbiotic microorganism effects on tomato seedling fitness under stressed conditions simulating a fragile soil susceptible to degradation; (ii) compare the plant-microbial interactions after inoculation with microbial isolates and fungi-bacteria consortia; (iii) develop an effective crop-microbial network, which improves soil and plant status. The experimental design included non-inoculated treatments with peat and sand at ratios of 50:50, 70:30, 100:0 (v:v), inoculated treatments with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and Azospirillum brasilense (AZ) using the aforementioned peat:sand ratios; and treatment with peat co-inoculated with AMF and Saccharothrix tamanrassetensis (S). AMF + AZ increased root fresh weight in peat substrate compared to the control (4.4 to 3.3 g plant-1). An increase in shoot fresh weight was detected in the AMF + AZ treatment with a 50:50 peat:sand ratio (10.1 to 8.5 g plant-1). AMF + AZ reduced antioxidant activity (DPPH) (18-34%) in leaves, whereas AMF + S had the highest DPPH in leaves and roots (45%). Total leaf phenolic content was higher in control with a decreased proportion of peat. Peroxidase activity was enhanced in AMF + AZ and AMF + S treatments, except for AMF + AZ in peat. Microscopic root assays revealed the ability of AMF to establish strong fungal-tomato symbiosis; the colonization rate was 78-89%. AMF + AZ accelerated K and Mg accumulation in tomato leaves in treatments reflecting soil stress. To date, there has been no relevant information regarding the successful AMF and Saccharothrix co-inoculation relationship. This study confirmed that AMF + S could increase the P, S, and Fe status of seedlings under high organic C content conditions. The improved tomato growth and nutrient acquisition demonstrated the potential of PGPM colonization under degraded soil conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3210721015,"Low plasma levels of Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin 9 (PCSK9) are associated with decreased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. PCSK9 binds to the epidermal growth factor-like repeat A (EGFA) domain of LDL receptors (LDLR), very low-density lipoprotein receptors (VLDLR), apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2), and lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and accelerates their degradation, thus acting as a key regulator of lipid metabolism. Antibody and RNAi-based PCSK9 inhibitor treatments lower cholesterol and prevent cardiovascular incidents in patients, but their high-cost hampers market penetration. We sought to develop a safe, long-term and one-time solution to treat hyperlipidemia. We created a cDNA encoding a chimeric protein in which the extracellular N- terminus of red blood cells (RBCs) specific glycophorin A was fused to the LDLR EGFA domain and introduced this gene into mouse bone marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Following transplantation into irradiated mice, the animals produced RBCs with the EGFA domain (EGFA-GPA RBCs) displayed on their surface. These animals showed significantly reduced plasma PCSK9 (66.5% decrease) and reduced LDL levels (40% decrease) for as long as 12 months post-transplantation. Furthermore, the EGFA- GPA mice remained lean for life and maintained normal body weight under a high-fat diet. Hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy can generate red blood cells expressing an EGFA-glycophorin A chimeric protein as a practical and long-term strategy for treating chronic hyperlipidemia and obesity."

https://openalex.org/W3208806646,"Some research suggests that positive and negative valence stimuli may be processed differently. For example, negative material may capture and hold attention more readily than equally arousing positive material. This is called the negativity bias, and it has been observed as both behavioural and electroencephalographic (EEG) effects. Consequently, it has been attributed to both automatic and elaborative processes. However, at the lowest levels of arousal, faster reaction times and stronger EEG responses to positive material have been observed. This is called the positivity offset, and the underlying cognitive mechanism is less understood. To study the role of selective attention in the positivity offset, participants completed a negative affective priming (NAP) task modified to dissociate priming for positive and negative words. The task required participants to indicate the valence of a target word, while simultaneously ignoring a distractor. In experiment 1, a behavioural facilitation effect (faster response time) was observed for positive words, in stark contrast to the original NAP task. These results were congruent with a previously reported general categorization advantage for positive material. In experiment 2, participants performed the task while EEG was recorded. In additional to replicating the behavioural results from experiment 1, positive words elicited a larger Late Positive Potential (LPP) component on ignored repetition relative to control trials. Surprisingly, negative words elicited a larger LPP than positive words on control trials. These results suggest that the positivity offset may reflect a greater sensitivity to priming effects due to a more flexible attentional set."

We identify four latent classes at each time horizon, where classes (i)-(ii) include a greater number of IPOs: (i) large-sized and underpriced IPOs; (ii) small-sized and overpriced IPOs; (iii) small-sized and severely underpriced IPOs; and (iv) large-sized IPOs that are overpriced at the one-day horizon but underpriced at the four-week horizon. The market returns are normal in latent classes (i)-(iii) and weak in class (iv). Approximately half of the IPOs in the technology sector are in the latent class with small-sized and overpriced IPOs, and most of the IPOs in the class with small-sized and severely underpriced IPOs are in the healthcare sector. Finally, the underpricing of IPOs is not corrected after one or four weeks of trading. Instead, the mean return and the standard deviation of returns increase with the time horizon."
