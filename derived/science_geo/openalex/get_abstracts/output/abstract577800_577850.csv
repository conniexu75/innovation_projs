https://openalex.org/W2245592118,"The global effects of epistasis on protein and RNA function are revealed by an unsupervised model of amino acid co-conservation in evolutionary sequence variation. Many high-throughput experimental technologies have been developed to assess the effects of large numbers of mutations (variation) on phenotypes. However, designing functional assays for these methods is challenging, and systematic testing of all combinations is impossible, so robust methods to predict the effects of genetic variation are needed. Most prediction methods exploit evolutionary sequence conservation but do not consider the interdependencies of residues or bases. We present EVmutation, an unsupervised statistical method for predicting the effects of mutations that explicitly captures residue dependencies between positions. We validate EVmutation by comparing its predictions with outcomes of high-throughput mutagenesis experiments and measurements of human disease mutations and show that it outperforms methods that do not account for epistasis. EVmutation can be used to assess the quantitative effects of mutations in genes of any organism. We provide pre-computed predictions for ∼7,000 human proteins at http://evmutation.org/ ."

It is among the most potent anti-HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies isolated so far. Here we report on its safety and activity in 33 individuals who received a single intravenous infusion of the antibody. 10-1074 was well tolerated and had a half-life of 24.0 d in participants without HIV-1 infection and 12.8 d in individuals with HIV-1 infection. Thirteen individuals with viremia received the highest dose of 30 mg/kg 10-1074. Eleven of these participants were 10-1074-sensitive and showed a rapid decline in viremia by a mean of 1.52 log10 copies/ml. Virologic analysis revealed the emergence of multiple independent 10-1074-resistant viruses in the first weeks after infusion. Emerging escape variants were generally resistant to the related V3-specific antibody PGT121, but remained sensitive to antibodies targeting nonoverlapping epitopes, such as the anti-CD4-binding-site antibodies 3BNC117 and VRC01. The results demonstrate the safety and activity of 10-1074 in humans and support the idea that antibodies targeting the V3 glycan supersite might be useful for the treatment and prevention of HIV-1 infection."
https://openalex.org/W2579604288,"The functions and underlying mechanisms of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep remain unclear. Here we show that REM sleep prunes newly formed postsynaptic dendritic spines of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the mouse motor cortex during development and motor learning. This REM sleep-dependent elimination of new spines facilitates subsequent spine formation during development and when a new motor task is learned, indicating a role for REM sleep in pruning to balance the number of new spines formed over time. Moreover, REM sleep also strengthens and maintains newly formed spines, which are critical for neuronal circuit development and behavioral improvement after learning. We further show that dendritic calcium spikes arising during REM sleep are important for pruning and strengthening new spines. Together, these findings indicate that REM sleep has multifaceted functions in brain development, learning and memory consolidation by selectively eliminating and maintaining newly formed synapses via dendritic calcium spike-dependent mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W2577141559,"Differential expression of inflammasome gene modules and inflammasome-activating metabolites correlates with interleukin-1β expression, hypertension, arterial stiffness and longevity in older individuals. Low-grade, chronic inflammation has been associated with many diseases of aging, but the mechanisms responsible for producing this inflammation remain unclear. Inflammasomes can drive chronic inflammation in the context of an infectious disease or cellular stress, and they trigger the maturation of interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Here we find that the expression of specific inflammasome gene modules stratifies older individuals into two extremes: those with constitutive expression of IL-1β, nucleotide metabolism dysfunction, elevated oxidative stress, high rates of hypertension and arterial stiffness; and those without constitutive expression of IL-1β, who lack these characteristics. Adenine and N4-acetylcytidine, nucleotide-derived metabolites that are detectable in the blood of the former group, prime and activate the NLRC4 inflammasome, induce the production of IL-1β, activate platelets and neutrophils and elevate blood pressure in mice. In individuals over 85 years of age, the elevated expression of inflammasome gene modules was associated with all-cause mortality. Thus, targeting inflammasome components may ameliorate chronic inflammation and various other age-associated conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2578822114,"CBP/p300 are transcription co-activators whose binding is a signature of enhancers, cis-regulatory elements that control patterns of gene expression in multicellular organisms. Active enhancers produce bi-directional enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) and display CBP/p300-dependent histone acetylation. Here, we demonstrate that CBP binds directly to RNAs in vivo and in vitro. RNAs bound to CBP in vivo include a large number of eRNAs. Using steady-state histone acetyltransferase (HAT) assays, we show that an RNA binding region in the HAT domain of CBP-a regulatory motif unique to CBP/p300-allows RNA to stimulate CBP's HAT activity. At enhancers where CBP interacts with eRNAs, stimulation manifests in RNA-dependent changes in the histone acetylation mediated by CBP, such as H3K27ac, and by corresponding changes in gene expression. By interacting directly with CBP, eRNAs contribute to the unique chromatin structure at active enhancers, which, in turn, is required for regulation of target genes."
https://openalex.org/W2576780822,"Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels underlie the control of rhythmic activity in cardiac and neuronal pacemaker cells. In HCN, the polarity of voltage dependence is uniquely reversed. Intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels tune the voltage response, enabling sympathetic nerve stimulation to increase the heart rate. We present cryo-electron microscopy structures of the human HCN channel in the absence and presence of cAMP at 3.5 Å resolution. HCN channels contain a K+ channel selectivity filter-forming sequence from which the amino acids create a unique structure that explains Na+ and K+ permeability. The voltage sensor adopts a depolarized conformation, and the pore is closed. An S4 helix of unprecedented length extends into the cytoplasm, contacts the C-linker, and twists the inner helical gate shut. cAMP binding rotates cytoplasmic domains to favor opening of the inner helical gate. These structures advance understanding of ion selectivity, reversed polarity gating, and cAMP regulation in HCN channels."
https://openalex.org/W2574695133,"Opioid pain medications have detrimental side effects including analgesic tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH). Tolerance and OIH counteract opioid analgesia and drive dose escalation. The cell types and receptors on which opioids act to initiate these maladaptive processes remain disputed, which has prevented the development of therapies to maximize and sustain opioid analgesic efficacy. We found that μ opioid receptors (MORs) expressed by primary afferent nociceptors initiate tolerance and OIH development. RNA sequencing and histological analysis revealed that MORs are expressed by nociceptors, but not by spinal microglia. Deletion of MORs specifically in nociceptors eliminated morphine tolerance, OIH and pronociceptive synaptic long-term potentiation without altering antinociception. Furthermore, we found that co-administration of methylnaltrexone bromide, a peripherally restricted MOR antagonist, was sufficient to abrogate morphine tolerance and OIH without diminishing antinociception in perioperative and chronic pain models. Collectively, our data support the idea that opioid agonists can be combined with peripheral MOR antagonists to limit analgesic tolerance and OIH."
https://openalex.org/W2574978705,"C2c2, the effector of type VI CRISPR-Cas systems, has two RNase activities-one for cutting its RNA target and the other for processing the CRISPR RNA (crRNA). Here, we report the structures of Leptotrichia shahii C2c2 in its crRNA-free and crRNA-bound states. While C2c2 has a bilobed structure reminiscent of all other Class 2 effectors, it also exhibits different structural characteristics. It contains the REC lobe with a Helical-1 domain and the NUC lobe with two HEPN domains. The two RNase catalytic pockets responsible for cleaving pre-crRNA and target RNA are independently located on Helical-1 and HEPN domains, respectively. crRNA binding induces significant conformational changes that are likely to stabilize crRNA binding and facilitate target RNA recognition. These structures provide important insights into the molecular mechanism of dual RNase activities of C2c2 and establish a framework for its future engineering as a RNA editing tool."
https://openalex.org/W2575684964,"ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP) couple intracellular ATP levels with membrane excitability. These channels play crucial roles in many essential physiological processes and have been implicated extensively in a spectrum of metabolic diseases and disorders. To gain insight into the mechanism of KATP, we elucidated the structure of a hetero-octameric pancreatic KATP channel in complex with a non-competitive inhibitor glibenclamide by single-particle cryoelectron microscopy to 5.6-Å resolution. The structure shows that four SUR1 regulatory subunits locate peripherally and dock onto the central Kir6.2 channel tetramer through the SUR1 TMD0-L0 fragment. Glibenclamide-bound SUR1 uses TMD0-L0 fragment to stabilize Kir6.2 channel in a closed conformation. In another structural population, a putative co-purified phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) molecule uncouples Kir6.2 from glibenclamide-bound SUR1. These structural observations suggest a molecular mechanism for KATP regulation by anti-diabetic sulfonylurea drugs, intracellular adenosine nucleotide concentrations, and PIP2 lipid."
https://openalex.org/W2578245286,"Superior predatory skills led to the evolutionary triumph of jawed vertebrates. However, the mechanisms by which the vertebrate brain controls predation remain largely unknown. Here, we reveal a critical role for the central nucleus of the amygdala in predatory hunting. Both optogenetic and chemogenetic stimulation of central amygdala of mice elicited predatory-like attacks upon both insect and artificial prey. Coordinated control of cervical and mandibular musculatures, which is necessary for accurately positioning lethal bites on prey, was mediated by a central amygdala projection to the reticular formation in the brainstem. In contrast, prey pursuit was mediated by projections to the midbrain periaqueductal gray matter. Targeted lesions to these two pathways separately disrupted biting attacks upon prey versus the initiation of prey pursuit. Our findings delineate a neural network that integrates distinct behavioral modules and suggest that central amygdala neurons instruct predatory hunting across jawed vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2578505993,"Transcriptional control requires epigenetic changes directed by mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites. In the mouse embryo, global epigenetic changes occur during zygotic genome activation (ZGA) at the 2-cell stage. Pyruvate is essential for development beyond this stage, which is at odds with the low activity of mitochondria in this period. We now show that a number of enzymatically active mitochondrial enzymes associated with the TCA cycle are essential for epigenetic remodeling and are transiently and partially localized to the nucleus. Pyruvate is essential for this nuclear localization, and a failure of TCA cycle enzymes to enter the nucleus correlates with loss of specific histone modifications and a block in ZGA. At later stages, however, these enzymes are exclusively mitochondrial. In humans, the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase is transiently nuclear at the 4/8-cell stage coincident with timing of human embryonic genome activation, suggesting a conserved metabolic control mechanism underlying early pre-implantation development."
https://openalex.org/W2575704225,"Tumors contain hostile inflammatory signals generated by aberrant proliferation, necrosis, and hypoxia. These signals are sensed and acted upon acutely by the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to halt proliferation and activate an immune response. Despite the presence of TLR ligands within the microenvironment, tumors progress, and the mechanisms that permit this growth remain largely unknown. We report that self-renewing cancer stem cells (CSCs) in glioblastoma have low TLR4 expression that allows them to survive by disregarding inflammatory signals. Non-CSCs express high levels of TLR4 and respond to ligands. TLR4 signaling suppresses CSC properties by reducing retinoblastoma binding protein 5 (RBBP5), which is elevated in CSCs. RBBP5 activates core stem cell transcription factors, is necessary and sufficient for self-renewal, and is suppressed by TLR4 overexpression in CSCs. Our findings provide a mechanism through which CSCs persist in hostile environments because of an inability to respond to inflammatory signals."

https://openalex.org/W2573077199,"Certain cell types function as factories, secreting large quantities of one or more proteins that are central to the physiology of the respective organ. Examples include surfactant proteins in lung alveoli, albumin in liver parenchyma, and lipase in the stomach lining. Whole-genome sequencing analysis of lung adenocarcinomas revealed noncoding somatic mutational hotspots near VMP1/MIR21 and indel hotspots in surfactant protein genes (SFTPA1, SFTPB, and SFTPC). Extrapolation to other solid cancers demonstrated highly recurrent and tumor-type-specific indel hotspots targeting the noncoding regions of highly expressed genes defining certain secretory cellular lineages: albumin (ALB) in liver carcinoma, gastric lipase (LIPF) in stomach carcinoma, and thyroglobulin (TG) in thyroid carcinoma. The sequence contexts of indels targeting lineage-defining genes were significantly enriched in the AATAATD DNA motif and specific chromatin contexts, including H3K27ac and H3K36me3. Our findings illuminate a prevalent and hitherto unrecognized mutational process linking cellular lineage and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2575307585,"In vitro selection of RNA libraries constructed by randomization of RNA structural scaffolds from known ribozymes and riboswitches led to the identification of aptamers that were readily translated into functional biosensors in cells. Allosteric RNA devices are increasingly being viewed as important tools capable of monitoring enzyme evolution, optimizing engineered metabolic pathways, facilitating gene discovery and regulators of nucleic acid–based therapeutics. A key bottleneck in the development of these platforms is the availability of small-molecule-binding RNA aptamers that robustly function in the cellular environment. Although aptamers can be raised against nearly any desired target through in vitro selection, many cannot easily be integrated into devices or do not reliably function in a cellular context. Here, we describe a new approach using secondary- and tertiary-structural scaffolds derived from biologically active riboswitches and small ribozymes. When applied to the neurotransmitter precursors 5-hydroxytryptophan and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, this approach yielded easily identifiable and characterizable aptamers predisposed for coupling to readout domains to allow engineering of nucleic acid–sensory devices that function in vitro and in the cellular context."

AML-iPSCs lacked leukemic potential, but when differentiated into hematopoietic cells, they reacquired the ability to give rise to leukemia in vivo and reestablished leukemic DNA methylation/gene expression patterns, including an aberrant MLL signature. Epigenetic reprogramming was therefore not sufficient to eliminate leukemic behavior.

Epigenetic dysregulation is an established feature of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that is implicated in disease pathogenesis (Melnick, 2010Melnick A.M. Epigenetics in AML.Best Pract. Res.

Aberrant DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin accessibility are observed in AML both in the presence and absence of mutations in key epigenetic regulatory factors (Ntziachristos et al., 2016Ntziachristos P.

Epigenetics and approaches to targeted epigenetic therapy in acute myeloid leukemia.Blood. 2016; 127: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that epigenetic dysregulation may independently contribute to leukemogenesis, a concept broadly proposed in cancer and referred to as epigenetic stochasticity (reviewed in Timp and Feinberg, 2013Timp W. Feinberg A.P. Cancer as a dysregulated epigenome allowing cellular growth advantage at the expense of the host.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2013; 13: 497-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). This model proposes that oncogenic mutations act within the context of an epigenetic setting conducive to cancer development, often with epigenetic dysregulation establishing the context. For example, in several human cancers including Wilms’ tumor and colorectal cancer, loss of imprinting of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) leads to increased activity of this mitogen and promotes cancer development and progression upon acquisition of additional mutations (Leick et al., 2011Leick M.B.

Genet. 1994; 7: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Mechanistic studies in immortalized fibroblasts demonstrated that DNA methylation patterns are heterogeneous and polymorphic, generated through a stochastic process that eventually results in deterministic epigenetic remodeling that may be critical for the emergence of cancer-specific epigenetic patterns (Landan et al., 2012Landan G. Cohen N.M. Mukamel Z. Bar A. Molchadsky A. Brosh R. Horn-Saban S. Zalcenstein D.A. Goldfinger N. Zundelevich A. et al.Epigenetic polymorphism and the stochastic formation of differentially methylated regions in normal and cancerous tissues.Nat. Genet. 2012; 44: 1207-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In leukemogenesis, several recent studies have indicated that the nature of the resulting disease is dependent on the cellular context in which mutations occur. For example, in the commonly employed retroviral MLL-AF9 model, transduced HSCs developed more aggressive, chemoresistant disease compared to GMP-derived leukemias (Krivtsov et al., 2013Krivtsov A.V. Figueroa M.E. Sinha A.U. Stubbs M.C. Feng Z. Valk P.J. Delwel R. Döhner K. Bullinger L. Kung A.L. et al.Cell of origin determines clinically relevant subtypes of MLL-rearranged AML.Leukemia. 2013; 27: 852-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Using this same model, AML failed to develop when myeloid differentiation of HSCs to GMPs was blocked, even though the oncogene was expressed in HSCs (Ye et al., 2015Ye M. Zhang H. Yang H. Koche R. Staber P.B. Cusan M. Levantini E. Welner R.S. Bach C.S. Zhang J. et al.Hematopoietic differentiation is required for initiation of acute myeloid leukemia.Cell Stem Cell. 2015; 17: 611-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrate that the epigenetic context is critical to the development and characteristics of the resulting AML. Given the importance of the epigenome, a number of epigenetic targeted therapies have been used to treat AML, but thus far with limited efficacy (Stein and Tallman, 2016Stein E.M. Tallman M.S. Emerging therapeutic drugs for AML.Blood. 2016; 127: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Despite this recent focus, the reversibility of epigenetic modifications and relative contributions of leukemic genetic and epigenetic programs to pathogenesis in AML are poorly understood. To investigate these questions, we sought to reprogram primary AML leukemic blasts into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and assess the effect of epigenetic reprogramming on leukemic behavior. Epigenetic reprogramming of somatic human cells to a pluripotent stem cell state has been achieved through the expression of defined sets of transcription factors (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from adult human fibroblasts by defined factors.Cell. 2007; 131: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14962) Google Scholar), while leaving underlying genetic abnormalities intact. The ability to globally modulate and reverse epigenetic alterations separate from underlying genetic abnormalities has broad applications to studying the interactions between genetic and epigenetic drivers of oncogenesis. Like many cancers, genome sequencing in AML has demonstrated that most cases are composed of a mixture of disease subclones defined by variable mutation composition (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013Cancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkGenomic and epigenomic landscapes of adult de novo acute myeloid leukemia.N. Engl. J. Med. 2013; 368: 2059-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (3299) Google Scholar, Ding et al., 2012Ding L. Ley T.J. Larson D.E. Miller C.A. Koboldt D.C. Welch J.S. Ritchey J.K. Young M.A. Lamprecht T.

Med. 2012; 366: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Indeed, the presence of subclones has major implications for disease pathogenesis and relapse and more importantly, for the development of targeted therapies (Alizadeh et al., 2015Alizadeh A.A. Aranda V. Bardelli A. Blanpain C. Bock C. Borowski C. Caldas C. Califano A. Doherty M. Elsner M. et al.Toward understanding and exploiting tumor heterogeneity.Nat. Med. 2015; 21: 846-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). One major barrier to investigation of cancer subclones is that reliable methods to separate disease subclones to permit detailed characterization do not yet exist. Notably, because iPSCs are derived from single cells and passaged as clones, subclones can be separated to permit such detailed characterization. Here, we sought to reprogram primary human AML leukemic blasts into iPSCs to facilitate investigation of a number of key questions. First, can AML cells with multiple karyotypic and genetic abnormalities be successfully reprogrammed into iPSCs? Second, if reprogramming is possible, are leukemia-specific epigenetic abnormalities reversed? Third, does the reprogramming process suppress leukemic behavior, and can these AML-derived iPSCs give rise to leukemia when forced to differentiate? Finally, can iPSCs from distinct subclones serve as a model to therapeutically target individual subclones within an AML patient? We identified two cases of AML (SU042 and SU223) harboring 11q23/MLL rearrangements and used targeted sequencing to identify additional somatic mutations in the leukemic blasts (Figure S1A). Using non-integrating Sendai virus, we transduced blasts with iPSC reprogramming factors (Sox-2, Klf4, Oct4, and Myc) to attempt pluripotent reprogramming (Figure S1B). Reprogrammed AML cells gave rise to iPSCs as indicated by classic pluripotency features including iPSC morphology and expression of pluripotency markers (Figures 1A–1C and S1C–S1E). When transplanted into immunodeficient mice, these cells formed teratomas indicative of successful iPSC formation (Figures 1D and S1F). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis demonstrated presence of the MLL rearrangement in multiple iPSC clones derived from each patient (Figure 1E). Targeted sequencing identified the presence of the leukemia-specific mutations in each case (Figure 1F). Notably, in case SU042, one clone (SU042-3) harbored all the leukemia-specific mutations except for KRAS-G13D, indicating it was derived from a KRAS wild-type subclone. In case SU223, a frameshift mutation in WT1 was found to be subclonal, and all iPSC clones were derived from WT1 wild-type leukemic cells. Cytogenetic analysis of AML-derived iPSCs (AML-iPSCs) demonstrated the MLL rearrangement without additional chromosomal abnormalities (Figures 1G and S1G). These data demonstrate that AML cells can be successfully reprogrammed into iPSCs that retain the original genetic abnormalities. AML-iPSCs from both cases possessed mutations known to be oncogenic drivers in multiple cancer types, including CNS tumors, such as MLL, ARID1A, ATM, and RAS (Choi et al., 2016Choi M. Kipps T.

To investigate whether AML-iPSCs give rise to normal, non-tumorigenic cell types in the presence of these oncogenes, we differentiated them into the neural and cardiomyocyte lineages (Figure S2). Neuronal cells differentiated from AML-iPSCs demonstrated normal neuronal morphology with expression of the pan-neuronal marker Map2 and presynaptic marker synapsin similar to control iPSC line C6-a (Figure S2B). These neurons fired spontaneous and current-induced action potentials and demonstrated the presence of voltage-gated Na+/K+ channels and AMPAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents similar to control (Figure S2C). Next, AML-iPSCs were differentiated into cardiomyocytes (CMs) through culture in CM-specific support media (Figure S2D). AML-iPSCs yielded similar percentages of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) expressing cells compared to a control iPSC line (Figure S2E). Differentiated CMs demonstrated typical cardiomyocyte morphology and expression of cardiac-specific markers cardiac troponin T type 2 (Tnnt2) and actinin (Figure S2F). Both contractile stress and contractility rates were similar between CMs differentiated from AML-iPSCs and control (Figure S2G), with no difference in several parameters assessing calcium handling (Figure S2H). In summary, despite the presence of several oncogenic driver mutations in AML-iPSCs, normal differentiation occurred down non-hematopoietic lineages without evidence of tumor formation. We next differentiated AML-iPSCs into hematopoietic progenitors using a co-culture feeder system with the mesenchymal mouse embryo stromal cell line C3H/10T1/2 (modified from Takayama and Eto, 2012Takayama N.

Hematopoietic differentiation of pluripotent stem cells in culture.Methods Mol. Biol. 2014; 1185: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This population was composed of a mixture of primitive and definitive hematopoietic cells with an average of 88.1% (range 84%–92.1%) definitive hematopoietic cells when evaluated by lack of expression of the primitive hematopoietic markers CD41a and CD235a (Doulatov et al., 2013Doulatov S.

Simultaneously, AML-iPSCs downregulated expression of pluripotent markers, demonstrating loss of pluripotency (Figures 2D and S3A). CD43+CD45+-differentiated AML-iPSCs were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and in parallel bulk cells, and CD34+CD43− cells (that enrich for endothelial cells) (Choi et al., 2011Choi K.D. Vodyanik M. Slukvin I.I. Hematopoietic differentiation and production of mature myeloid cells from human pluripotent stem cells.Nat. Protoc. 2011; 6: 296-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) were plated in methylcellulose to evaluate hematopoietic colony forming potential (Figure S3B). Compared to bulk cells and CD34+CD43− cells, which failed to produce colonies, CD43+CD45+ cells were enriched for hematopoietic colony forming potential (Figures S3D and S3E). Colony formation was then compared between CD43+CD45+ cells differentiated from AML-iPSCs and control iPSCs and ESCs. CD43+CD45+ cells differentiated from controls gave rise to both myeloid and erythroid colonies (Figures 2E and 2F) while those from AML-iPSCs predominantly formed myeloid colonies. Hematopoietic colonies from AML-iPSCs demonstrated a significantly higher myeloid:erythroid cell ratio compared to controls (Figure S3F). Lastly, through serial replating assays, AML-iPSC colonies replated across multiple passages in contrast to controls, suggesting more extensive proliferative potential (Figure 2G). We next transplanted CD43+CD45+ hematopoietic cells from AML-iPSCs into immunodeficient NSG mice to evaluate leukemia formation in vivo. Cells were transplanted either intravenously into sublethally irradiated NSG mice or orthotopically into NSG mice harboring human ossicles, a model that gives rise to a humanized hematopoietic niche and enables efficient human hematopoietic cell engraftment (Reinisch et al., 2016Reinisch A. Thomas D. Corces M.R. Zhang X. Gratzinger D. Hong W.J. Schallmoser K. Strunk D. Majeti R. A humanized bone marrow ossicle xenotransplantation model enables improved engraftment of healthy and leukemic human hematopoietic cells.Nat. Med. 2016; 22: 812-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Transplantation of AML-iPSC-derived CD43+CD45+ cells from both AML patients led to an aggressive myeloid leukemia as indicated by robust human CD33+ myeloid-restricted engraftment in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and spleen (Figures 3A and 3B ). Human CD33+CD45+ cells isolated from mouse bone marrow demonstrated classic AML blast morphology (Figure 3A, right panel), and human CD45+ leukemic infiltrates were observed in mouse marrows (Figure 3C). Mice engrafted with differentiated AML-iPSCs had significantly enlarged spleens compared to non-transplanted mice (Figure 3D). Mutational analysis of engrafted cells demonstrated that they harbored mutations present in the original patient blasts and iPSC clones (Figures 3F, 3G, and S4A). Transplantation of engrafted cells into secondary recipients resulted in robust engraftment for all AML-iPSC clones (Figure 3H) and led to death from fulminant leukemia (Figure 3I), as evidenced by progressive cytopenias (Figures S4E and S4F). Notably, the engrafted leukemia cells derived from the AML-iPSCs exhibited a similar cell surface immunophenotype as the patients’ original blasts (Figures S4C and S4D). Ex vivo hematopoietic differentiation of AML-iPSCs was required for leukemia formation as undifferentiated AML-iPSCs failed to give rise to hematopoietic engraftment (Figure S4B). Next, we sought to determine the effects of reprogramming and re-differentiation on the global epigenetic DNA methylation (Infinium 450K arrays) and gene expression (RNA-sequencing [RNA-seq]) profiles by comparing AML blasts both directly from patients and engrafted in mice, undifferentiated AML-iPSCs, engrafted leukemia cells derived from AML-iPSCs, and iPSCs and ES cells from normal controls. We additionally generated patient-matched germline controls by deriving iPSCs from T cells of both AML patients (Figure S5). Resulting T cell-iPSCs formed teratomas (Figure S5C) and did not harbor somatic leukemic mutations from patient AML cells, demonstrating that these T cell-iPSCs were not derived from the leukemic clone (Figures S5D and S5E). T cell-iPSCs harbored clonal T cell receptor rearrangements confirming that these cells were derived from T cells (Figure S5F; Table S1). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering using the 1,000 most variable CpG sites from DNA methylation arrays demonstrated clustering of undifferentiated AML-iPSCs with T cell-iPSCs and control iPSCs/ESCs, indicating the similarity of all pluripotent populations (Figure 4A). Hematopoietic cells differentiated from AML-iPSCs clustered with primary AML cells and engrafted patient AML blasts, indicating the similarity of all leukemic populations (Figure 4A). Moreover, multi-dimensional scaling analysis separated undifferentiated iPSCs/ESCs from hematopoietic cells (first coordinate) and leukemic from non-leukemic hematopoietic cells (second coordinate) (Figure 4B). Again, differentiated AML-iPSCs grouped with primary AML cells. When assessing absolute methylation differences, undifferentiated iPSC populations were globally hypermethylated compared to primary AML and differentiated AML-iPSCs (Figure S6A). Hypermethylation mostly occurred in CpG islands and shores, while hypomethylation occurred mainly in open seas (Table S2A). We next investigated the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between the various populations. First, undifferentiated AML-iPSCs demonstrated significant DMRs when compared to primary AML samples (Figure 4C, top row). Distinct DMRs were also observed between undifferentiated and differentiated hematopoietic cells from AML-iPSCs (Figure 4C, right middle panel). In contrast, minimal differences were observed between all undifferentiated iPSC/ESC lines (Figure 4C, bottom row). Virtually no significant differences in DMRs were observed comparing primary AML to primary engrafted AML (data not shown). We then characterized the specific gene regions encompassing the DMRs, focusing on genes associated with pluripotency and hematopoietic differentiation. Relative hypomethylation was seen at promoter regions of several pluripotency genes in undifferentiated AML-iPSCs in contrast to differentiated AML-iPSCs and primary AML (Figures 4D and S6B). In contrast, hematopoietic gene promoter regions were hypermethylated in undifferentiated AML-iPSCs compared to differentiated AML-iPSCs and primary AML cells (Figures 4D and S6B). Furthermore, gene ontology analysis demonstrated that undifferentiated AML-iPSCs were enriched for hypomethylation of gene sets involved in pluripotency and hypermethylation of gene sets involved in hematopoietic differentiation and leukemogenesis, including upregulated MLL gene targets (Figures S6C and S6D). Differentiated AML-iPSCs, similar to primary AML, demonstrated relative hypermethylation of pluripotency gene sets but hypomethylation of hematopoietic and leukemic gene sets. We next performed RNA-seq analyses to determine the effect of AML reprogramming on gene expression. As with the DNA methylation profiles, all pluripotent samples possessed similar gene expression profiles, regardless of whether they were derived from AML patients or normal controls (Figures 4E and 4F). In contrast, hematopoietic cells differentiated from AML-iPSCs possessed similar gene expression profiles to primary AML samples. These findings were confirmed when all samples were analyzed by unsupervised clustering (Figure 4E) and multi-dimensional scaling analysis (Figure 4F). Pluripotency genes were upregulated in undifferentiated AML-iPSCs similar to control iPSCs/ESCs, while hematopoietic differentiation genes were upregulated in AML-iPSCs differentiated into hematopoietic cells, similar to primary AML samples (Figure S6E). Taken together, these results demonstrate that pluripotent reprogramming of AML samples led to global resetting of both leukemic DNA methylation and gene expression patterns that were reacquired upon hematopoietic differentiation into transplantable leukemia. To investigate the possibility of residual epigenetic memory contributing to the re-acquisition of the leukemic phenotype upon differentiation of AML-iPSCs, we conducted two comparisons. First, we evaluated the DMRs between undifferentiated healthy control iPSCs and AML-iPSCs. Notably, only six DMRs were found in this comparison mostly corresponding to pseudogenes or intronic regions (Table S2B). No differential expression of these genes was found by RNA-seq (Table S2C). Second, we evaluated epigenetic and gene expression differences between patient AML cells and the leukemia cells re-derived from AML-iPSCs. In this comparison, we found 716 DMRs overlapping gene promoter regions (at 1% false discovery rate [FDR]), with 659 hypomethylated and 57 hypermethylated in the re-derived leukemia. The only significant gene annotations were for sets that acquire differential H3K27me3 methylation marks during ES cell differentiation (Meissner et al., 2008Meissner A. Mikkelsen T.S. Gu H. Wernig M. Hanna J. Sivachenko A. Zhang X. Bernstein B.E. Nusbaum C. Jaffe D.B. et al.Genome-scale DNA methylation maps of pluripotent and differentiated cells.Nature. 2008; 454: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar). Nine of the genes with DMRs in their promoter regions were differentially expressed (Table S2D), and in only two cases was there concurrence with the changes in expression that would be anticipated based on the difference in CpG methylation—for PVT1 (a long non-coding RNA) and ADAMTS3 (ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 3). Thus, although the samples derived by differentiation from AML-iPSCs retained some differences in methylation from the original leukemia cells, these did not appear to significantly impact gene expression at the RNA level. These results suggest that no residual epigenetic memory was present upon AML reprogramming to iPSCs. In order to explore how AML-iPSCs reacquired the leukemic phenotype, we determined whether AML-iPSCs reactivated leukemic target genes upon hematopoietic differentiation. We performed additional methylation and gene expression analyses comparing differentiated hematopoietic cells from AML-iPSCs to differentiated hematopoietic cells from control iPSCs. Hematopoietic cells from AML-iPSCs clustered separately from control iPSC-derived cells in both methylation (Figures 4B and 5A ) and gene expression analyses (Figure 5B), consistent with the idea that the mutations present in AML-iPSCs drive the leukemic phenotype only upon differentiation to hematopoietic cells. As both cases harbored MLL rearrangements that drive leukemogenesis, we investigated the activation of MLL fusion target genes. First, we found significant differences in DMRs with hypomethylation of MLL fusion targets in differentiated AML-iPSCs compared to differentiated control iPSCs (Figure 5C), whereas no difference was detected in the undifferentiated state (Table S2B). Second, when restricted to MLL fusion targets (Ross et al., 2004Ross M.E. Mahfouz R. Onciu M. Liu H.C. Zhou X. Song G. Shurtleff S.A. Pounds S. Cheng C. Ma J. et al.Gene expression profiling of pediatric acute myelogenous leukemia.Blood. 2004; 104: 3679-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), differentiated AML-iPSCs exhibited hypomethylation and clustered separately when compared to differentiated control iPSCs (Figure 5D). Third, differentiated AML-iPSCs specifically exhibited hypomethylation of MLL target genes known to play key roles in leukemic pathogenesis mediated by MLL fusions, including MEIS1 and HOX family proteins (Afonja et al., 2000Afonja O. Smith Jr., J.E. Cheng D.M. Goldenberg A.S. Amorosi E. Shimamoto T. Nakamura S. Ohyashiki K. Ohyashiki J. Toyama K. Takeshita K. MEIS1 and HOXA7 genes in human acute myeloid leukemia.Leuk.

This suggests that the genetic mutations in AML-iPSCs reactivate leukemia target genes upon hematopoietic differentiation leading to the leukemic phenotype. Lastly, while MLL rearrangements can lead to both"

V. cholerae has a characteristic curved rod morphology, with a longer outer face and a shorter inner face. The mechanism and function of this curvature were previously unknown. Here, we identify and characterize CrvA, the first curvature determinant in V. cholerae. CrvA self-assembles into filaments at the inner face of cell curvature. Unlike traditional cytoskeletons, CrvA localizes to the periplasm and thus can be considered a periskeletal element. To quantify how curvature forms, we developed QuASAR (quantitative analysis of sacculus architecture remodeling), which measures subcellular peptidoglycan dynamics. QuASAR reveals that CrvA asymmetrically patterns peptidoglycan insertion rather than removal, causing more material insertions into the outer face than the inner face. Furthermore, crvA is quorum regulated, and CrvA-dependent curvature increases at high cell density. Finally, we demonstrate that CrvA promotes motility in hydrogels and confers an advantage in host colonization and pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2572285617,"Alongside the rapid growth in aging populations worldwide, prevention and therapy for age-related memory decline and dementia are in great demand to maintain a long, healthy life. Here we found that iso-α-acids, hop-derived bitter compounds in beer, enhance microglial phagocytosis and suppress inflammation via activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ. In normal mice, oral administration of iso-α-acids led to a significant increase both in CD11b and CD206 double-positive anti-inflammatory type microglia (p < 0.05) and in microglial phagocytosis in the brain. In Alzheimer's model 5xFAD mice, oral administration of iso-α-acids resulted in a 21% reduction in amyloid β in the cerebral cortex as observed by immunohistochemical analysis, a significant reduction in inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and chemokines including macrophage inflammatory protein-1α in the cerebral cortex (p < 0.05) and a significant improvement in a novel object recognition test (p < 0.05), as compared with control-fed 5xFAD mice. The differences in iso-α-acid-fed mice were due to the induction of microglia to an anti-inflammatory phenotype. The present study is the first to report that amyloid β deposition and inflammation are suppressed in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease by a single component, iso-α-acids, via the regulation of microglial activation. The suppression of neuroinflammation and improvement in cognitive function suggests that iso-α-acids contained in beer may be useful for the prevention of dementia."

Our work suggests that even though the retina is often considered immune-privileged, suppression of host immune-mediated cell rejection may well be a useful approach for improving long-term integration of transplanted cells with a view to successful clinical outcomes. Many retinopathies, acquired or inherited, share a common endpoint, the loss of photoreceptors (rods and cones) in the retina, leading to severe and permanent visual loss. This is due to the fact that the adult mammalian retina lacks any significant regenerative potential. In the past couple of decades, significant progress has been made in the understanding of the pathogenesis of a range of retinal degenerative diseases. However, currently available treatment options are very limited. Cell replacement therapy is a promising therapeutic strategy for retinal degenerative diseases, especially following the discovery of pluripotent stem cell sources. Several groups have successfully generated retinal cells, including rod and cone photoreceptors, from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Lamba et al., 2006Lamba D.A.

The retinal cells derived from either hESCs or iPSCs can be transplanted to the adult mouse retina and integrate into the host retina and mature into photoreceptors (Lamba et al., 2009Lamba D.A.

Using a model of congenital blindness (Crx mutation), we have previously demonstrated that hESC-derived retinal cells can even restore some light sensitivity (Lamba et al., 2009Lamba D.A. Gust J. Reh T.A. Transplantation of human embryonic stem cell-derived photoreceptors restores some visual function in Crx-deficient mice.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 73-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Both hESCs and iPSCs have demonstrated considerable potential to be taken forward to clinical trials of photoreceptor diseases but are currently limited by concerns regarding their efficient integration, long-term safety, and efficacy. Generally, donor cells survive poorly in a degenerating environment, and only a small number of cells can integrate into the host retina. Additionally, most of the studies, including our previous report, have only tracked the cells for a short duration, and it is unclear how well these cells would do in the long term. Additionally, although our previous report did show restoration of the local electroretinography (ERG) response, whether this information travels centrally was not assessed. One of the issues with any stem cell therapy is the use of allogeneic cells. These cells have an increased risk of rejection. The retina has classically been considered immune-privileged. Previous full-thickness sheet transplantation studies as well as hESC-derived retina studies in immunocompetent mice have shown good survival in the subretinal space. However, none of these groups observed much photoreceptor integration over the long term (Hambright et al., 2012Hambright D. Park K.Y. Brooks M. McKay R. Swaroop A. Nasonkin I.O. Long-term survival and differentiation of retinal neurons derived from human embryonic stem cell lines in un-immunosuppressed mouse retina.Mol.

Subretinal space and vitreous cavity as immunologically privileged sites for retinal allografts.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1993; 34: 3347-3354PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, long-term transplantation studies in murine models have shown evidence of cell rejection months after transplantation (Jiang et al., 1995Jiang L.Q. Jorquera M. Streilein J.W.

Long-term survival of photoreceptors transplanted into the adult murine neural retina requires immune modulation.Stem Cells. 2010; 28: 1997-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Using an established model of mouse rod photoreceptor integration, a recent study demonstrated a significant decline in the survival of integrated mouse photoreceptors over time, even with partially matched donor mice, which is caused by both acute and chronic immune responses in the host retina (West et al., 2010West E.L. Pearson R.A. Barker S.E. Luhmann U.F. Maclaren R.E. Barber A.C. Duran Y. Smith A.J. Sowden J.C. Ali R.R. Long-term survival of photoreceptors transplanted into the adult murine neural retina requires immune modulation.Stem Cells. 2010; 28: 1997-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In this study, we focused on clarifying the role of cell rejection in the survival and integration of hESC-derived photoreceptors using a severe immunodeficient mouse model with interleukin 2 receptor γ chain gene knockdown (IL2rγ−/−), which results in decreased numbers of B and T lymphocytes and lack of natural killer cells, which are known to be involved in cell rejection. We show that this model allows for better integration of transplanted human photoreceptors, especially for long-term transplantation studies (3 months and beyond). Additionally, by crossing this mouse background to a mouse model of congenital blindness because of a point mutation in the Crx gene, we confirm that the hESC-derived retinal photoreceptors can functionally integrate into the host circuitry and transmit the visual signal to central circuits. This work helps to pinpoint one of the key issues that need to be addressed to improve the efficiency of photoreceptor replacement therapies. It has been reported that immunosuppression in host animals is needed to reduce rejection of donor cells in long-term transplantation studies (Lamba et al., 2009Lamba D.A. Gust J. Reh T.A.

Although some studies have reported good survival of cells in the subretinal space, these same studies did not report efficient integration, particularly in the photoreceptor layer (Hambright et al., 2012Hambright D. Park K.Y. Brooks M. McKay R. Swaroop A. Nasonkin I.O. Long-term survival and differentiation of retinal neurons derived from human embryonic stem cell lines in un-immunosuppressed mouse retina.Mol. Vis. 2012; 18: 920-936PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the relative immune privilege status of the subretinal space may not extend into the neural retina. To test this, we used a mouse model of immunodeficiency, IL2rγ−/− mice. These mice carry a mutation in the interleukin 2 receptor γ chain gene on the X chromosome. This results in a 10-fold reduction in the absolute number of lymphocytes and a complete absence of natural killer cells, which mediate cell rejection (Cao et al., 1995Cao X. Shores E.W. Hu-Li J.

IL2rγ gene knockdown did not cause any defects in retinal morphology, including the number or morphology of photoreceptors (Figures S1A and S1B), and prior to transplantation did not have any obvious T, B, and dendritic cell infiltration (Figure S1D). ERG recording data also show that IL2rγ gene knockdown does affect visual function in these mice (Figure S1C). We used a modification of our previously reported differentiation protocol to generate retinal cells from hESCs by inhibition of BMP and WNT signaling (Lamba et al., 2006Lamba D.A. Karl M.O.

We confirmed this using immunocytochemistry (ICC) and RT-PCR analysis. At 3 months of culture, a large portion of cells displayed typical neuronal morphology and expressed the pan-neuronal marker TUJ1; approximately 40% of cells expressed OTX2 and CRX, two early markers of developing photoreceptors; 10% of cells expressed AIPL1, another protein expressed in immature photoreceptors; 33% of cells expressed retinal stem cell marker LHX2; and 0.8% cells expressed cell proliferation marker Phospho Histone H3 (PHH3) (Figures 1A–1D). qRT-PCR data also showed a significant increase in the expression of various photoreceptor-specific markers (RCVRN, NRL, TRβ2, and BLIMP1) in addition to expression of the retinal stem cell markers PAX6, CHX10, and LHX2 (Figure 1E). To track cells following transplantation, retinal cells in culture were infected with a replication-incompetent lentivirus expressing EGFP under a ubiquitous promoter (hEF1α) as described previously (Lamba et al., 2009Lamba D.A. Gust J. Reh T.A.

This resulted in expression of GFP by 50%–70% of all cells in the plate (Figure S1N). After an additional 5–7 days of culture following viral medium wash-off, the cells were dissociated and transplanted into the subretinal space of 4- to 6-week-old control (IL2rγ+/+) and IL2rγ−/− mice via the transcorneal subretinal injection approach. Approximately 500,000–750,000 cells in a 1- to 1.5-μL volume were transplanted into the left eye of each recipient mouse (Figure S1N). The procedure resulted in a wide distribution of GFP+ donor cells, covering approximately one third to one quarter of subretinal space in the host eye. Upon analysis 6 weeks post-transplantation, we observed that the transplanted cells survived in the subretinal space of both IL2rγ+/+ and IL2rγ−/− host eyes; however, very few cells integrated into the host neural retina (Figures S1O and S1P). However, upon analysis 3 months following transplantation, we observed robust integration in the host eyes of IL2rγ−/− recipient mice (Figures 1H and 1I). An average of 20,858 (± 5,823) GFP+ donor human retinal cells integrated within the outer nuclear layer (ONL) of the recipient retina and exhibited an unambiguous photoreceptor morphology with properly orientated photoreceptor segments and synaptic endfeet (Figures 1K and 1L). On the other hand, at this late time point, donor cells integrated extremely poorly in the control non-immunosuppressed host mouse photoreceptor layer, although grafted GFP+ cells were still present in the subretinal space (Figures 1F and 1G). To test whether the observed enhancement of photoreceptor integration was an IL2rγ−/−-specific effect or a result of generalized immune suppression, we transplanted cells in another model of immunosuppression, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice (Prkdcscid), which have a complete absence of functional B and T cells. Although overall the mice were much sicker post-transplantation and at older ages than IL2rγ−/− mice, we observed a similarly high degree of integration at 3 months (Figure S1Q). We confirmed that the GFP+ integrated cells were, in fact, of human origin by co-staining with a previously described human-specific STEM121 antibody (Figure 1M; Cummings et al., 2005Cummings B.J. Uchida N. Tamaki S.J. Salazar D.L. Hooshmand M. Summers R. Gage F.H. Anderson A.J. Human neural stem cells differentiate and promote locomotor recovery in spinal cord-injured mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 14069-14074Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Finally, to rule out cell fusion between the transplanted and host photoreceptors, we took high-resolution confocal image stacks with DAPI co-staining and confirmed the absence of binucleated GFP+ photoreceptors (Figure 2J). We also observed some GFP+ cells in the subretinal space of IL2rγ−/− mice but did not detect any obvious retinal detachment or formation of tumors (data not shown). To test whether subretinal cell transplantation is, in fact, associated with a significant immune response, we looked at markers of immune cells as well as microglia and activated macrophages in IL2rγ−/− and control mice 3 months following subretinal injection of cells. We analyzed T cell infiltration by looking at the pan T cell marker CD3 as well as the mature T cell markers CD4 and CD8a. Interestingly, although there were CD3+ cells in both cases, CD4+ and CD8a+ cells were virtually absent in the IL2rγ−/− retinal environment, suggesting failure of formation of mature T cells, which take part in the immune cell response (Figures 2A–2I). We also found that CD49b-expressing natural killer cells were absent, as expected, in IL2rγ−/− mice, but present in a wild-type non-immunosuppressed host, confirming the presence of an immune rejection response following transplantation of retinal cells (Figures 2J, 2L, and 2N). We also detected the presence of CD11c expressing dendritic cells in wild-type transplanted retinas that were absent in IL2rγ−/− mice (Figures 2K, 2M, and 2O). Finally, we looked for the presence of activated macrophages and microglia by staining for CD68 and F4/80. Large numbers of CD68+ and F4/80+ cells were found in the vitreous and the retina in a non-immunosuppressed host compared with IL2rγ−/− mice (Figures 2P–2U). These data confirm that the subretinal transplantation procedure is immunogenic and will lead to an immune response following cellular transplantation. Next we looked at maturation and synaptic integration of hESC-derived photoreceptors in the host IL2rγ−/− retina. The integrated donor cells in the ONL expressed the pan-photoreceptor markers OTX2 and RCVRN (Figures 3A–3B”’ ). We looked for and confirmed maturation of the transplanted cells by co-staining for markers of mature photoreceptors, including the cone marker peanut agglutinin (PNA) as well as the rod and cone phototransduction proteins rhodopsin (Ret-P1) and green cone opsin (GCO) (Figures 3C–3E’”), suggestive of their potential to respond to a light stimulus. We also confirmed expression of the photoreceptor-specific synaptic marker SV2 in the outer plexiform layer (Figures 3F–F’”), indicating that the cells have the potential to communicate with host inner retinal neurons. These results show that a receptive host retinal environment that lacks a significant cell rejection capacity likely will promote better integration and maturation, which, in turn, enhances the potential for visual restoration. Previous studies have described limited integration of mouse photoreceptors in degenerating retinas (Barber et al., 2013Barber A.C. Hippert C. Duran Y. West E.L. Bainbridge J.W. Warre-Cornish K.

Also, retinal degeneration is associated with loss of retinal barriers, which will likely further negatively affect the immune privilege status of the retina (Chen and Xu, 2015Chen M. Xu H. Parainflammation, chronic inflammation, and age-related macular degeneration.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2015; 98: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, Forrester and Xu, 2012Forrester J.V. Xu H. Good news-bad news: the Yin and Yang of immune privilege in the eye.Front. Immunol. 2012; 3: 338Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Here we wanted to test the hypothesis that loss of the immune privilege barrier secondary to retinal degeneration contributes to poor integration of exogenous photoreceptors in degenerating retinas. We generated Crx mutant mice on the IL2rγ−/− background, where we do not anticipate cell-rejection to play a role. CRX gene mutations lead to vision defects in patients with Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA7). We obtained Crxtvrm65 mice generated by Patsy Nishina’s lab, which are C57BL/6J mice carrying the tvrm65 recessive mutation in the last exon of the Crx gene (Won et al., 2011Won J. Shi L.Y. Hicks W. Wang J. Hurd R. Naggert J.K. Chang B. Nishina P.M. Mouse model resources for vision research.J. Ophthalmol. 2011; 2011: 391384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutation causes an early termination at Leu277 (TTG) of the 323 amino acids (aa) from the longer isoform or at Leu253 of a 299-aa product from the shorter isoform. These mice were bred with IL2rγ−/− mice described above. Crxtvrm65 and Crxtvrm65/IL2rγ−/− mice were used as recipients to compare whether the immunosuppressed degenerative retinal environment will help the survival and integration of donor cells. We first compared the Crxtvrm65 and Crxtvrm65/IL2rγ−/− mice to assess whether the IL2rγ−/− background affected the rate of degeneration or immune cell infiltration. The recipient Crxtvrm65 and Crxtvrm65/IL2rγ−/− mice have ongoing retinal degeneration with five to six cell layers in the ONL at 4–6 weeks of age (Figures S2A and S2B). We did not observe any significant difference in photoreceptor layer thickness or expression of Otx2 and rhodopsin in Crxtvrm65 mice in the IL2rγ−/− background. In non-transplanted mice, there were no B/T/NK/dendritic cells in the retina in either mouse strain (Figure S2C). Finally, we did not observe any difference in GFAP expression pattern (Figure S2D), suggesting no differences in degeneration-associated gliosis. Three months following transplantation, we observed very few GFP+ cells in the host eye, including both the retina and the subretinal space of Crxtvrm65 mice (Figures 4A–4C). In contrast, we found an average of 4,323 (± 2,438) cells integrated in the host retina of Crxtvrm65/IL2rγ−/− mice (Figures 4B and 4C). The integrated GFP+ donor cells expressed the pan-photoreceptor marker OTX2 (Figures 4D and 4E). We also confirmed expression of the mature rod photoreceptor marker rhodopsin in integrated donor cells (Figures 4F and 4G). Because our GFP infection only labels 50%–70% of cells and because Crx mutant mice lack rhodopsin (Figures S2A and S2B), we looked at the abundance of rhodopsin in the subretinal space region to assess rod integration from non-GFP cells. Compared with Crxtvrm65 mice that received transplantation at the same time but did not have any integrated photoreceptors, we observed an abundant presence of rhodopsin in the retina, extending into the subretinal space of host Crxtvrm65/IL2rγ−/− mouse eyes, suggesting robust integration of human photoreceptors (Figures 4F–4I). In general, the overall integration of donor cells in Crxtvrm65/IL2rγ−/− mice is much lower than that of IL2rγ−/− mice 3 months following transplantation (compare Figures 1I–1L with Figures 4B and 4C), indicating the presence of other microenvironmental factors in the degenerated retina that hinder the survival and integration of donor cells. One such factor is degeneration-associated chronic inflammation. To test whether this was still playing a role in the IL2rγ−/− background, we compared inflammation-associated markers, including those for macrophage and microglia activation (CD11b), and markers of neutrophils (Gr-1) in non-transplanted mice. We observed robust infiltration of both cell types in the retinas as well as the vitreous of Crxtvrm65 and Crxtvrm65/IL2rγ−/− mice but not in non-degenerating IL2rγ−/− mouse retinas (Figures S2E–S2G). These data are suggestive of ongoing pro-inflammatory changes that are likely to affect cell integration and will need to be addressed for improved integration of exogenous cells. Finally, we wanted to test whether the transplanted photoreceptors were actually functionally integrated into the host retina using methodologies previously used to assess human and mouse photoreceptor integration (Lamba et al., 2009Lamba D.A.

Hence, they lack both a local ERG response and a centrally mediated photoreceptor component of pupillary light response (PLR). To test functional integration, the recipient Crxtvrm65/IL2rγ−/− mice were tested for visual function restoration via pupillometry 3 months following transplantation by stimulating the transplanted eye and recording from the contralateral non-transplanted eye (Figure 5A).

https://openalex.org/W2574824017,"Degradation of the extracellular matrices in the human body is controlled by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of more than 20 homologous enzymes. Imbalance in MMP activity can result in many diseases, such as arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, fibrosis, and cancers. Thus, MMPs present attractive targets for drug design and have been a focus for inhibitor design for as long as 3 decades. Yet, to date, all MMP inhibitors have failed in clinical trials because of their broad activity against numerous MMP family members and the serious side effects of the proposed treatment. In this study, we integrated a computational method and a yeast surface display technique to obtain highly specific inhibitors of MMP-14 by modifying the natural non-specific broad MMP inhibitor protein N-TIMP2 to interact optimally with MMP-14. We identified an N-TIMP2 mutant, with five mutations in its interface, that has an MMP-14 inhibition constant (Ki ) of 0.9 pm, the strongest MMP-14 inhibitor reported so far. Compared with wild-type N-TIMP2, this variant displays ∼900-fold improved affinity toward MMP-14 and up to 16,000-fold greater specificity toward MMP-14 relative to other MMPs. In an in vitro and cell-based model of MMP-dependent breast cancer cellular invasiveness, this N-TIMP2 mutant acted as a functional inhibitor. Thus, our study demonstrates the enormous potential of a combined computational/directed evolution approach to protein engineering. Furthermore, it offers fundamental clues into the molecular basis of MMP regulation by N-TIMP2 and identifies a promising MMP-14 inhibitor as a starting point for the development of protein-based anticancer therapeutics."

However, its mode of action is unclear and a systematic analysis of its molecular targets is needed. In the present study, we investigated the effects of prenatal exposure to 300 mg/kg/day DEHP during a critical period for gonads differentiation to testes on male mice offspring reproductive parameters, including the genome-wide RNA expression and associated promoter methylation status in the sperm of the first filial generation. It was observed that adult male offspring displayed symptoms similar to the human testicular dysgenesis syndrome. A combination of sperm transcriptome and methylome data analysis allowed to detect a long-lasting DEHP-induced and robust promoter methylation-associated silencing of almost the entire cluster of the seminal vesicle secretory proteins and antigen genes, which are known to play a fundamental role in sperm physiology. It also resulted in the detection of a DEHP-induced promoter demethylation associated with an up-regulation of three genes apparently not relevant for sperm physiology and partially related to the immune system. As previously reported, DEHP induced an increase in mir-615 microRNA expression and a genome-wide decrease in microRNA promoter methylation. A functional analysis revealed DEHP-induced enrichments in down-regulated gene transcripts coding for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and tumor necrosis factor signaling pathways, and in up-regulated gene transcripts coding for calcium binding and numerous myosin proteins. All these enriched pathways and networks have been described to be associated in some way with the reproductive system. This study identifies a large new array of genes dysregulated by DEHP that may play a role in the complex system controlling the development of the male reproductive system."

One potential explanation of these data is that lumacaftor only partially rescues the plasma membrane expression of F508del-CFTR; combinations of correctors will probably be required for complete rescue (22.Farinha C.M.

However, chronic treatment of F508del-CFTR-expressing cells with ivacaftor destabilizes lumacaftor-rescued F508del-CFTR Cl− currents (24.Cholon D.M. Quinney N.L. Fulcher M.L. Esther Jr., C.R. Das J.

Although this result argues that ivacaftor might have counterproductive effects on F508del-CFTR, other studies offer alternative explanations, including limited efficacy of lumacaftor (26.Matthes E. Goepp J. Carlile G.W. Luo Y. Dejgaard K. Billet A. Robert R. Thomas D.Y. Hanrahan J.W. Low free drug concentration prevents inhibition of F508del CFTR functional expression by the potentiator VX-770 (ivacaftor).Br. J.

Physiol. 2016; 310: L928-L939Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, the aims of this study were 2-fold: first, to understand better the impact of F508del on CFTR stability, and second, to investigate the effects of lumacaftor and ivacaftor on the instability of F508del-CFTR. To address our aims, we used biochemical and functional assays, purified CFTR protein, and recombinant CFTR expressed in cultured cells. We discovered that the F508del mutation destabilized purified full-length CFTR protein by ∼10 °C and deactivated CFTR Cl− channels in excised membrane patches by the time-dependent loss of both channel gating and current flow through open channels. We found that lumacaftor and ivacaftor had complex effects on F508del-CFTR. Whereas lumacaftor thermally stabilized purified full-length F508del-CFTR protein, ivacaftor destabilized it. At the macroscopic level, chronic ivacaftor treatment accelerated the temporal deactivation of lumacaftor-rescued F508del-CFTR Cl− currents. However, at the single-channel level, chronic lumacaftor and ivacaftor co-treatment greatly increased F508del-CFTR channel activity and stability in most, but not all, excised membrane patches. We conclude that lumacaftor-ivacaftor combination therapy rescues a small subpopulation of F508del-CFTR Cl− channels. We speculate that understanding the heterogeneity of CFTR populations in epithelial cells might be crucial for CF therapy development. Here, we investigated the instability of the most common CF mutant F508del-CFTR and its rescue by the CFTR corrector lumacaftor (16.Van Goor F. Hadida S. Grootenhuis P.D.J. Burton B. Stack J.H.

We analyzed the functional instability of F508del-CFTR in excised membrane patches and polarized epithelia at 37 °C to relate molecular defects to tissue dysfunction. To complement these studies, we examined the thermal instability of full-length F508del-CFTR protein in membranes and after purification. As controls, we studied wild-type CFTR and the CF mutation G551D, which severely disrupts CFTR channel gating without altering protein processing and stability (28.Gregory R.J. Rich D.P. Cheng S.H.

Physiol. 2014; 592: 1931-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)) was reduced dramatically (Fig. 1, A and D). By contrast, neither F508del nor G551D affected current flow through fully open CFTR Cl− channels (Fig. 1, A–C). However, close inspection of single-channel recordings revealed that F508del-CFTR also opened partially to a smaller current level, a subconductance state (Fig. 1A). These partial channel openings are more clearly seen in the single-channel current amplitude histogram of F508del-CFTR as a shoulder to the closed channel amplitude, 29% of the value of the fully open state (Fig. 1, B (middle) and C). Openings to subconductance states were observed in 37 of 39 recordings of F508del-CFTR in excised membrane patches and were always associated with channel deactivation (see below). By contrast, openings to subconductance states were only observed in 4 of 18 recordings of wild-type CFTR and were not associated with channel deactivation. We did not quantify the Po of the subconductance state of F508del-CFTR because of its small current amplitude and variable gating pattern (76.Wang, Y., (2016) Investigation of the thermoinstability of cystic fibrosis mutants. Ph.D. thesis, University of Bristol, Bristol, UKGoogle Scholar). The F508del mutation destabilizes full-length CFTR protein at the plasma membrane (14.Lukacs G.L. Chang X.-B. Bear C. Kartner N. Mohamed A. Riordan J.R. Grinstein S. The ΔF508 mutation decreases the stability of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in the plasma membrane: determination of functional half-lives on transfected cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21592-21598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), leading to accelerated rundown of CFTR Cl− channels at 37 °C (e.g. see Ref. 34.Aleksandrov A.A. Kota P. Aleksandrov L.A. He L. Jensen T. Cui L. Gentzsch M. Dokholyan N.V. Riordan J.R. Regulatory insertion removal restores maturation, stability and function of ΔF508 CFTR.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 401: 194-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To investigate the impact of CF mutations on CFTR stability, we used Po values to monitor the duration of channel activity in excised membrane patches at 37 °C (32.Wang Y. Liu J. Loizidou A. Bugeja L.A. Warner R. Hawley B.R. Cai Z. Toye A.M. Sheppard D.N. Li H. CFTR potentiators partially restore channel function to A561E-CFTR, a cystic fibrosis mutant with a similar mechanism of dysfunction as F508del-CFTR.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2014; 171: 4490-4503Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 illustrates the single-channel activity of wild-type CFTR, F508del-CFTR, and G551D-CFTR in excised membrane patches over the first 9 min of recordings at 37 °C after channel activation was complete (for details, see the legend to Fig. 2). Wild-type CFTR and G551D-CFTR both demonstrated stable and sustained channel activity, albeit that of G551D-CFTR was greatly reduced compared with wild-type CFTR (Fig. 2, A–D). When rescued by low temperature incubation, F508del-CFTR exhibited sustained low level channel activity at 23 °C (32.Wang Y. Liu J. Loizidou A. Bugeja L.A. Warner R. Hawley B.R. Cai Z. Toye A.M. Sheppard D.N. Li H. CFTR potentiators partially restore channel function to A561E-CFTR, a cystic fibrosis mutant with a similar mechanism of dysfunction as F508del-CFTR.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2014; 171: 4490-4503Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). By contrast, at 37 °C its activity was unstable and declined rapidly over time (Fig. 2, E and F). Comparison of normalized Po values reveals that rundown of F508del-CFTR was 50% complete around 3 min and complete within 7 min (Fig. 2E). Visual inspection of single-channel records (Figs. 2F and 3) suggests that F508del-CFTR rundown involves both changes in channel gating and current flow through open channels. Reflecting the decline in F508del-CFTR Po, the change in gating pattern was characterized by reduced frequency of channel openings before complete channel deactivation (Figs. 2 (E and F) and 3). The change in current flow through F508del-CFTR accompanying channel rundown was characterized by increased frequency of partial channel openings to a subconductance state (e.g. Fig. 3). Thus, F508del causes CFTR instability by perturbing both channel gating and current flow through the CFTR pore. Some studies suggest that ivacaftor destabilizes F508del-CFTR Cl− channels (24.Cholon D.M. Quinney N.L. Fulcher M.L. Esther Jr., C.R. Das J. Dokholyan N.V. Randell S.H. Boucher R.C. Gentzsch M.

To investigate the action of ivacaftor on F508del-CFTR, we studied single channels in excised membrane patches at 37 °C, comparing acute and chronic effects of the small molecule on F508del-CFTR Cl− channels rescued by lumacaftor. Fig. 2, E–H, compares the single-channel activity and stability of F508del-CFTR rescued by lumacaftor (3 μm for 24 h at 37 °C) with low temperature correction (48–72 h at 27 °C). Consistent with previous results (35.Kopeikin Z. Yuksek Z. Yang H.-Y. Bompadre S.G. Combined effects of VX-770 and VX-809 on several functional abnormalities of F508del-CFTR channels.J. Cyst. Fibros. 2014; 13: 508-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), lumacaftor-rescued F508del-CFTR exhibited a gating defect, and its initial Po at 37 °C following complete channel activation was not different from that of low temperature-rescued F508del-CFTR (p = 0.74; unpaired t test) (Fig. 2, E and G). Like low temperature-rescued F508del-CFTR, lumacaftor-rescued F508del-CFTR was unstable and deactivated over time (Fig. 2, E–H). Comparison of normalized Po values suggests that lumacaftor-rescued F508del-CFTR Cl− channels were slower to deactivate, but the difference was not statistically significant (low temperature-rescued F508del-CFTR, 50% normalized Po = 3.5 min; lumacaftor-rescued F508del-CFTR, 50% normalized Po = 5.0 min; p = 0.10; unpaired t test) (Fig. 2, E and G). As we reported previously (32.Wang Y. Liu J. Loizidou A. Bugeja L.A. Warner R. Hawley B.R. Cai Z. Toye A.M. Sheppard D.N. Li H.

However, ivacaftor-potentiated F508del-CFTR deactivated noticeably faster when compared with the absence of the drug (Fig. 2, E and I). Acute treatment of lumacaftor-rescued F508del-CFTR with ivacaftor (10 μm) also potentiated Po markedly to attain wild-type levels of channel activity (Fig. 2, A and K).

Although the concentrations of signaling proteins are perturbed in disease states, such as cancer, and are modulated by drug therapies, our understanding of how such changes shape the properties of signaling networks is limited. Here we couple mass-cytometry-based single-cell analysis with overexpression of tagged signaling proteins to study the dependence of signaling relationships and dynamics on protein node abundance. Focusing on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling network in HEK293T cells, we analyze 20 signaling proteins during a 1-h EGF stimulation time course using a panel of 35 antibodies. Data analysis with BP-R2, a measure that quantifies complex signaling relationships, reveals abundance-dependent network states and identifies novel signaling relationships. Further, we show that upstream signaling proteins have abundance-dependent effects on downstream signaling dynamics. Our approach elucidates the influence of node abundance on signal transduction networks and will further our understanding of signaling in health and disease."

Total 25(OH)D serum concentration was associated with disease activity categorized in 5 continuous groups of SLEDAI. 25(OH)D serum concentrations were higher among patients with SLEDAI 1–5 and lower in those with severe activity (SLEDAI≥20) (p <0.05). On the other hand, no statistically significant difference was observed for DBP, free and bioavailable vitamin D measurements in the disease activity subgroups evaluated.

Although TAA production has been detected in bacteria and plants for many years and is known to be a potent inhibitor of aconitase, its biosynthetic origins and the physiological relevance of its activity have remained unclear. We have serendipitously uncovered key information relevant to both of these questions. Specifically, in a search for novel nematicidal factors from Bacillus thuringiensis, a significant nematode pathogen harboring many protein virulence factors, we discovered a high yielding component that showed activity against the plant-parasitic nematode Meloidogyne incognita and surprisingly identified it as TAA. Comparison with CAA, which displayed a much weaker nematicidal effect, suggested that TAA is specifically synthesized by B. thuringiensis as a virulence factor. Analysis of mutants deficient in plasmids that were anticipated to encode virulence factors allowed us to isolate a TAA biosynthesis-related (tbr) operon consisting of two genes, tbrA and tbrB. We expressed the corresponding proteins, TbrA and TbrB, and characterized them as an aconitate isomerase and TAA transporter, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis of the TAA biosynthetic gene cluster revealed the association of the TAA genes with transposable elements relevant for horizontal gene transfer as well as a distribution across B. cereus bacteria and other B. thuringiensis strains, suggesting a general role for TAA in the interactions of B. cereus group bacteria with nematode hosts in the soil environment. This study reveals new bioactivity for TAA and the TAA biosynthetic pathway, improving our understanding of virulence factors employed by B. thuringiensis pathogenesis and providing potential implications for nematode management applications. trans-Aconitic acid (TAA) is an isomer of cis-aconitic acid (CAA), an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle that is synthesized by aconitase.

https://openalex.org/W2575865178,"ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification that is known to be involved in cellular homeostasis and stress but has been challenging to analyze biochemically. To facilitate the detection of ADP-ribosylated proteins, we show that an alkyne-adenosine analog, N6-propargyl adenosine (N6pA), is metabolically incorporated in mammalian cells and enables fluorescence detection and proteomic analysis of ADP-ribosylated proteins. Notably, our analysis of N6pA-labeled proteins that are upregulated by oxidative stress revealed differential ADP-ribosylation of small GTPases. We discovered that oxidative stress induced ADP-ribosylation of Hras on Cys181 and Cys184 in the C-terminal hypervariable region, which are normally S-fatty-acylated. Downstream Hras signaling is impaired by ADP-ribosylation during oxidative stress, but is rescued by ADP-ribosyltransferase inhibitors. Our study demonstrates that ADP-ribosylation of small GTPases not only is mediated by bacterial toxins but is endogenously regulated in mammalian cells. N6pA provides a useful tool to characterize ADP-ribosylated proteins and their regulatory mechanisms in cells."
https://openalex.org/W4253033061,"Background The recent crisis of refugees seeking asylum in European countries challenges public health on many levels. Most refugees currently arrive from Syria, Afghanistan, or Eritrea. Data about multidrug resistant bacteria (MDR) prevalence are not present for these countries. However, when entering the European heath care systems, data about colonisation rates regarding highly resistant bacterial pathogens are important. Methods We performed a cross-sectional screening in four Swiss refugee centres to determine the colonization rates for MRSA and ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. We used pharyngeal, nasal, and inguinal swabs for MRSA and rectal swabs and urine for ESBL and carbapenemase screening using standard microbiological procedures. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was used to determine the relatedness of MRSA isolates with high resolution due to a suspected outbreak. Results 41/261(15.7%) refugees were colonized with MRSA. No differences regarding the country of origin were observed. However, in a single centre significantly more were colonized, which was confirmed to be a recent local outbreak. 57/241 (23.7%) refugees were colonized with ESBL with significantly higher colonisation in persons originating from the Middle East (35.1%, p<0.001). No carbapenemase producers were detected. Conclusion The colonisation rate of the refugees was about 10 times higher for MRSA and 2–5 times higher for ESBL compared to the Swiss population. Contact precaution is warranted for these persons if they enter medical care. In cases of infections, MRSA and ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae should be considered regarding antibiotic treatment choices."
https://openalex.org/W2575004706,"The ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-like (Nedd4L, or Nedd4-2) binds to and regulates stability of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) in salt-absorbing epithelia in the kidney, lung, and other tissues. Its role in the distal colon, which also absorbs salt and fluid and expresses ENaC, is unknown. Using a conditional knock-out approach to knock out Nedd4L in mice intestinal epithelium (Nedd4Lf/f ;Vil-CreERT2 ) we show here that Nedd4L depletion leads to a higher steady-state short circuit current (Isc) in mouse distal colon tissue relative to controls. This higher Isc was partially reduced by the addition of apical amiloride and strongly reduced by basolateral bumetanide as well as by depletion of basolateral Cl-, suggesting that Na+/K+/2Cl- (NKCC1/SLC12A2) co-transporter and ENaC are targets of Nedd4L in the colon. In accordance, NKCC1 (and γENaC) protein abundance in the colon of the Nedd4L knock-out animals was increased, indicating that Nedd4L normally suppresses these proteins. However, we did not observe co-immunoprecipitation between Nedd4L and NKCC1, suggesting that Nedd4L indirectly suppresses NKCC1 expression. Low salt diet resulted in a strong increase in β and γ (but not α) ENaC mRNA and protein expression and ENaC activity. Although salt restriction also increased NKCC1 protein and mRNA abundance, it did not lead to its elevated activity (Isc). These results identify NKCC1 as a novel target for Nedd4L-mediated down-regulation in vivo, which modulates ion and fluid transport in the distal colon together with ENaC."
https://openalex.org/W2571974398,"Impaired adenosine homeostasis has been associated with numerous human diseases. Lysosomes are referred to as the cellular recycling centers that generate adenosine by breaking down nucleic acids or ATP. Recent studies have suggested that lysosomal adenosine overload causes lysosome defects that phenocopy patients with mutations in transient receptor potential channel mucolipin-1 (TRPML1), a lysosomal Ca2+ channel, suggesting that lysosomal adenosine overload may impair TRPML1 and then lead to subsequent lysosomal dysfunction. In this study, we demonstrate that lysosomal adenosine is elevated by deleting adenosine deaminase (ADA), an enzyme responsible for adenosine degradation. We also show that lysosomal adenosine accumulation inhibits TRPML1, which is rescued by overexpressing ENT3, the adenosine transporter situated in the lysosome membrane. Moreover, ADA deficiency results in lysosome enlargement, alkalinization, and dysfunction. These are rescued by activating TRPML1. Importantly, ADA-deficient B-lymphocytes are more vulnerable to oxidative stress, and this was rescued by TRPML1 activation. Our data suggest that lysosomal adenosine accumulation impairs lysosome function by inhibiting TRPML1 and subsequently leads to cell death in B-lymphocytes. Activating TRPML1 could be a new therapeutic strategy for those diseases. Impaired adenosine homeostasis has been associated with numerous human diseases.

It is produced constitutively by cells under normal conditions, and its concentration increases under metabolic stress (e.g. ischemia) or at sites of tissue injury (1Obata T.

Cell. 2013; 26: 511-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ADA activity has been detected in lysosomes isolated from human fibroblasts (23Lindley E.R. Pisoni R.L. Demonstration of adenosine deaminase activity in human fibroblast lysosomes.Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 24Pisoni R.L. Thoene J.G. Detection and characterization of a nucleoside transport system in human fibroblast lysosomes.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4850-4856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesize that in ADA mutant cells TRPML1 activity may be compromised by accumulated adenosine in lysosomes, and this might be involved in ADA deficiency. In this study, we report that lysosomal TRPML1 is suppressed by a high concentration of adenosine from the lumen. ADA−/− cells display impaired TRPML1 activity, which is rescued by increasing ENT3. We have also shown that deleting ADA results in lysosomal adenosine accumulation, lysosome enlargement, alkalinization, and dysfunction. Additionally, ADA deficiency causes B-lymphocyte cell death in response to oxidative stress. Importantly, all these phenotypes in ADA-deficient cells are rescued by TRPML1 activation. Our data suggest that ADA deficiency impairs TRPML1 activity, which may cause lysosome dysfunction and subsequent cell death in lymphocytes. This study provides a molecular mechanism underlying diseases associated with ADA deficiency. Because ADA activity has been detected in lysosomes (23Lindley E.R. Pisoni R.L.

Detection and characterization of a nucleoside transport system in human fibroblast lysosomes.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4850-4856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), loss of ADA presumably leads to adenosine accumulation in lysosomes. To explore the role of adenosine in lysosomes, we first measured the level of adenosine in lysosomes isolated from human skin fibroblasts using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (25Shin K. Pandey A. Liu X.Q. Anini Y. Rainey J.K. Preferential apelin-13 production by the proprotein convertase PCSK3 is implicated in obesity.FEBS Open Bio. 2013; 3: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We detected significant amounts of adenosine and ATP in the lysosomes of human fibroblasts. With the calculation method we described before (26Huang P. Zou Y. Zhong X.Z. Cao Q. Zhao K. Zhu M.X. Murrell-Lagnado R. Dong X.P. P2X4 forms functional ATP-activated cation channels on lysosomal membranes regulated by luminal pH.J. Biol.

The concentration of lysosomal ATP obtained here using HPLC is in agreement with the value we reported previously using an ATP bioluminescence assay (26Huang P. Zou Y. Zhong X.Z. Cao Q. Zhao K.

Next, we compared the amount of lysosomal ATP and adenosine between wild-type (WT) human fibroblasts and ADA−/− human fibroblasts derived from an ADA-SCID patient that contain very low ADA activity (2Blackburn M.R.

Interestingly, although the ATP level is not different between WT and ADA−/− human fibroblasts (Fig. 1, A and B), the lysosomal adenosine level was significantly increased in ADA−/− cells (Fig. 1, A and C). These data suggest that ADA deficiency causes adenosine accumulation in lysosomes, which may further inhibit lysosome function, resulting in cell dysfunction. The similar cellular phenotypes between TRPML1-deficient cells and cells with lysosomal adenosine accumulation (7Hsu C.L. Lin W. Seshasayee D. Chen Y.H. Ding X. Lin Z. Suto E. Huang Z. Lee W.P.

To test this, HEK293T cells were transfected with surface-expressed mutant TRPML1 channels (TRPML1-L15A/L16A/L577A/L578A; abbreviated as TRPML1-4A), which serve as a surrogate of lysosomal TRPML1 (27Vergarajauregui S.

Consistent with our previous study, TRPML1 currents were activated by mucolipin synthetic agonist 1 (ML-SA1; a TRPML1 agonist; 5 μm) (29Shen D. Wang X. Li X. Zhang X. Yao Z. Dibble S. Dong X.P. Yu T.

As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, adenosine induced a dose-dependent decrease in TRPML1 currents. Because TRPML1 acts as a Ca2+-permeable channel (31Parkinson K. Baines A.E. Keller T. Gruenheit N.

Commun. 2012; 3: 731Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), activation of TRPML1-4A by ML-SA1 induced a rapid increase in Fura-2 signal followed by a quick rundown. The mechanism underlying the rundown remains unclear. To avoid the contamination of the rundown, we co-applied ML-SA1 and adenosine followed by application of ML-SA1 alone. If adenosine inhibits TRPML1, we would expect to see a smaller Ca2+ signal followed by a larger one. As shown in Fig. 2, C and D, the Fura-2 signal in cells expressing TRPML1-4A was increased by co-application of ML-SA1 (10 μm) and adenosine (10 mm), presumably due to incomplete inhibition of TRPML1 by adenosine. However, a much larger response was observed when ML-SA1 (10 μm) was applied alone. ML-SA1 did not reveal Fura-2 response in untransfected cells (Fig. 2, C and D) or cells transfected with GFP alone (data not shown). These data suggest that adenosine inhibits TRPML1 activity. To verify the inhibitory effect of adenosine on TRPML1 in the native environment, COS1 cells expressing GFP-TRPML1 were treated with 1 μm vacuolin-1, a small chemical known to increase the size of lysosomes (32Dong X.P. Cheng X. Mills E. Delling M. Wang F. Kurz T. Xu H.

TRPML1 currents in the luminal-side-out patch were markedly inhibited by bath application of adenosine (10 mm, pH 5.5) by 56.7 ± 2.2% (Fig. 2, E and F). These data suggest that luminal adenosine inhibits lysosomal TRPML1 channel activity. Next, we aimed to test whether adenosine accumulation inhibits TRPML1 in intact cells. TRPML1 activity in intact cells can be assessed by monitoring the cytoplasmic Ca2+ change using a Fura-2-based Ca2+ measurement. We compared ML-SA1-induced Fura-2 signals between WT and ADA−/− human fibroblasts. If adenosine accumulation inhibits TRPML1, we would expect to detect less Fura-2 signal in response to ML-SA1 in ADA−/− cells. As shown in Fig. 3, A and C, ADA−/− cells exhibited a significantly smaller Fura-2 signal in response to ML-SA1 (50 μm), decreasing from 0.0600 ± 0.0052 in control fibroblasts to 0.0050 ± 0.0008 in ADA−/− fibroblasts. This reduction in Fura-2 signal in ADA−/− cells was not caused by a decrease in lysosomal Ca2+ content because ADA−/− cells showed a comparable Fura-2 signal in response to GPN (400 μm), a cathepsin C substrate that induces osmotic lysis of lysosomes to release lysosomal Ca2+ (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, overexpression of ENT3 but not ENT3-G437R, a mutant ENT3 with compromised transport activity but normal subcellular localization (8Kang N. Jun A.H. Bhutia Y.D. Kannan N. Unadkat J.D.

To further measure lysosomal TRPML1 activity and lysosomal Ca2+ release in intact cells, we have generated a lysosome-targeted genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator by fusing GECO, a single wavelength genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator (34Zhao Y. Araki S. Wu J. Teramoto T. Chang Y.F. Nakano M. Abdelfattah A.S. Fujiwara M. Ishihara T. Nagai T. Campbell R.E.

GECO-TRPML1 has been used as a probe to specifically measure TRPML1-mediated lysosomal Ca2+ release, representing TRPML1 activity (30Cao Q. Zhong X.Z. Zou Y. Zhang Z. Toro L. Dong X.P.

Cell. 2015; 33: 427-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To exclude the possible contamination of external Ca2+, low external Ca2+ (nominally free Ca2+ with 1 mm EGTA; free Ca2+ estimated to be <10 nm) was used for the GECO-TRPML1 fluorescence measurement. As shown in Fig. 3, E and F, ML-SA1 (10 μm)-induced GECO fluorescence intensity in ADA−/− cells was significantly smaller than that in WT cells, decreasing from 0.68 ± 0.09 in control fibroblasts to 0.24 ± 0.03 in ADA−/− fibroblasts. In contrast, a comparable GPN-induced GECO signal (Fig. 3G) and ionomycin-induced GECO signal (Fig. 3H) were observed between WT and ADA−/− cells. These data suggest that TRPML1 activity is reduced in lysosomes of human skin fibroblasts with ADA deficiency. TRPML1-mediated lysosomal Ca2+ release is essential for lysosomal membrane trafficking, and defective TRPML1 results in enlarged lysosomes (35Lloyd-Evans E. Platt F.M.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The above results suggest that by affecting TRPML1-mediated Ca2+ release lysosomal adenosine accumulation in ADA−/− fibroblasts may result in enlarged lysosomes. In agreement with this, ADA−/− fibroblasts displayed enlarged lysosomes as revealed by electron microscopy, and this was rescued by ML-SA1 treatment (Fig. 4, A and B). Overall, these results confirm that lysosomal adenosine accumulation inhibits TRPML1 activity, subsequently resulting in defective membrane trafficking. Because TRPML1 is important for lysosome function (16Cheng X. Shen D. Samie M. Xu H. Mucolipins: intracellular TRPML1–3 channels.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 2013-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), to test whether adenosine accumulation impairs lysosomal function, we first monitored lysosomal pH using LysoTracker Red DND-99. Strong LysoTracker signals were detected in WT but not ADA−/− fibroblasts (Fig. 5, A and B). Notably, TRPML1-GFP but not lysosomal associated membrane protein 1 (Lamp1)-GFP or TRPML1-DDKK (non-conducting pore mutation)-GFP rescued the loss of LysoTracker signal in ADA−/− cells. These data suggest that ADA deletion results in elevated pH in lysosomes, which is likely due to a reduction in TRPML1 activity. Because LysoTracker provides only a qualitative assessment of lysosomal pH, a ratiometric approach has been used to more accurately measure lysosomal pH (40Steinberg B.E. Huynh K.K. Brodovitch A.

Therefore, it is vital to diagnose the insulation quality to detect early signs of insulation failure. It is well known that there is a correlation between Partial discharge (PD) and the insulation quality. Although many works have been done on PD pattern recognition, it is usually performed in a noise free environment. Also, works on PD pattern recognition in actual cable joint are less likely to be found in literature. Therefore, in this work, classifications of actual cable joint defect types from partial discharge data contaminated by noise were performed. Five cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) cable joints with artificially created defects were prepared based on the defects commonly encountered on site. Three different types of input feature were extracted from the PD pattern under artificially created noisy environment. These include statistical features, fractal features and principal component analysis (PCA) features. These input features were used to train the classifiers to classify each PD defect types. Classifications were performed using three different artificial intelligence classifiers, which include Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). It was found that the classification accuracy decreases with higher noise level but PCA features used in SVM and ANN showed the strongest tolerance against noise contamination."
https://openalex.org/W2573793685,"Substrate channeling has emerged as a common mechanism for enzymatic intermediate transfer. A conspicuous gap in knowledge concerns the use of covalent lysine imines in the transfer of carbonyl-group-containing intermediates, despite their wideuse in enzymatic catalysis. Here we show how imine chemistry operates in the transfer of covalent intermediates in pyridoxal 5'-phosphate biosynthesis by the Arabidopsis thaliana enzyme Pdx1. An initial ribose 5-phosphate lysine imine is converted to the chromophoric I320 intermediate, simultaneously bound to two lysine residues and partially vacating the active site, which creates space for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to bind. Crystal structures show how substrate binding, catalysis and shuttling are coupled to conformational changes around strand β6 of the Pdx1 (βα)8-barrel. The dual-specificity active site and imine relay mechanism for migration of carbonyl intermediates provide elegant solutions to the challenge of coordinating a complex sequence of reactions that follow a path of over 20 Å between substrate- and product-binding sites."

https://openalex.org/W2574313940,"Background Several common genetic variants have been associated with either ventricular fibrillation (VF) or sudden cardiac death (SCD). However, replication efforts have been limited. Therefore, we aimed to analyze whether such variants may contribute to VF caused by first ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Methods We analyzed 27 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) previously associated with SCD/VF in other cohorts, and examined whether these SNPs were associated with VF caused by first STEMI in the GEnetic causes of Ventricular Arrhythmias in patients with first ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (GEVAMI) study on ethnical Danes. The GEVAMI study is a prospective case-control study involving 257 cases (STEMI with VF) and 537 controls (STEMI without VF). Results Of the 27 candidate SNPs, one SNP (rs11720524) located in intron 1 of SCN5A which was previously associated with SCD was significantly associated with VF caused by first STEMI. The major C-allele of rs11720524 was present in 64% of the cases and the C/C genotype was significantly associated with VF with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.87 (95% CI: 1.12–3.12; P = 0.017). After controlling for clinical differences between cases and controls such as age, sex, family history of sudden death, alcohol consumption, previous atrial fibrillation, statin use, angina, culprit artery, and thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow, the C/C genotype of rs11720524 was still significantly associated with VF with an OR of 1.9 (95% CI: 1.05–3.43; P = 0.032). Marginal associations with VF were also found for rs9388451 in HEY2 gene. The CC genotype showed an insignificant risk for VF with OR = 1.50 (95% CI: 0.96–2.40; P = 0.070). Conclusion One common intronic variant in SCN5A suggested an association with VF caused by first STEMI. Further studies into the functional abnormalities associated with the noncoding variant in SCN5A may lead to important insights into predisposition to VF during STEMI."
https://openalex.org/W2574315799,"Auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) transmit acoustic information from the sensory hair cells to the cochlear nuclei. In experimental and clinical audiology, probing the whole ANF population remains a difficult task, as the ANFs differ greatly in their threshold and onset response to sound. Thus, low spontaneous rate (SR) fibers, which have rather higher thresholds, delay and larger jitter in their first spike latency are not detectable in the far-field compound action potential of the auditory nerve. Here, we developed a new protocol of acoustic stimulation together with electrophysiological signal processing to track the steady state activity of ANFs. Mass potentials at the round window were recorded in response to repetitive 300-ms bursts of 1/3 octave band noise centered on a frequency probe. Analysis was assessed during the last 200-ms of the response to capture the steady-state response of ANFs. To eliminate the microphonic component reflecting the sensory cells activity, repetitive pairs of sounds of opposite polarities were used. The spectral analysis was calculated on the average of two consecutive responses, and the neural gain was calculated by dividing point-by-point the spectrum to sound over unstimulated condition. In response to low-sound-level stimulation, neural gain predominated in the low-frequency cochlear regions, while a second component of responses centered on higher cochlear frequency regions appeared beyond 30 dB SPL. At 60 dB SPL, neural gain showed a bimodal shape, with a notch near 5.6 kHz. In addition to correlate with the functional mapping of ANFs along the tonotopic axis, the deletion of low-SR fibers leads to a reduction in the high-frequency response, where the low-SR fibers are preferentially located. Thus, mass potentials at the round window may provide a useful tool to probe the SR-based distribution of ANFs in humans and in other species in which direct single-unit recordings are difficult to achieve or not feasible."
https://openalex.org/W2574909551,"The presence of large carnivores can affect lower trophic levels by suppressing mesocarnivores and reducing their impacts on prey. The mesopredator release hypothesis therefore predicts prey abundance will be higher where large carnivores are present, but this prediction assumes limited dietary overlap between large and mesocarnivores. Where dietary overlap is high, e.g., among omnivorous carnivore species, or where prey are relatively easily accessible, the potential exists for large and mesocarnivores to have redundant impacts on prey, though this possibility has not been explored. The intertidal community represents a potentially important but poorly studied resource for coastal carnivore populations, and one for which dietary overlap between carnivores may be high. To evaluate usage of the intertidal community by coastal carnivores and the potential for redundancy between large and mesocarnivores, we surveyed (i) intertidal prey abundance (crabs and fish) and (ii) the abundance and activity of large carnivores (predominantly black bears) and mesocarnivores (raccoons and mink) in an area with an intact carnivore community in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Overall carnivore activity was strongly related to intertidal prey availability. Notably, this relationship was not contingent on carnivore species identity, suggestive of redundancy–high intertidal prey availability was associated with either greater large carnivore activity or greater mesocarnivore activity. We then compared intertidal prey abundances in this intact system, in which bears dominate, with those in a nearby system where bears and other large carnivores have been extirpated, and raccoons are the primary intertidal predator. We found significant similarities in intertidal species abundances, providing additional evidence for redundancy between large (bear) and mesocarnivore (raccoon) impacts on intertidal prey. Taken together, our results indicate that intertidal prey shape habitat use and competition among coastal carnivores, and raise the interesting possibility of redundancy between mesocarnivores and large carnivores in their role as intertidal top predators."

In the present study, we performed competitive binding assays to examine the binding of l-THBr to neurotransmitter receptors known to be involved in sedation, hypnosis and anxiety. Our results show that l-THBr does not interact with GABAergic receptors but has binding affinities for dopamine and serotonin receptors. In addition, cAMP and [35S]GTPγS assays were used to determine the agonist or antagonist properties of l-THBr at dopamine (D1, D2) or serotonin (5-HT) receptors. Our results show that l-THBr displays D1 and D2 antagonist and 5-HT1A agonist properties. Moreover, l-THBr-treated rodents exhibit anxiolytic-like effects in the light/dark box and elevated plus-maze tests, and the anxiolytic effect of l-THBr can be reduced by WAY-100635, a selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist. Our results suggest that l-THBr may produce potent anxiolytic-like effects mainly through serotonin receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2578939622,"A TV series from the 1970s, “The Six Million Dollar Man,” imagines a former astronaut with bionic implants and superhuman strength acting as a secret agent for the government. Such enhancement of human abilities with artificial components (all at a reasonable price tag) might resonate with some of today’s scientists who are working on a more modest goal of augmenting the properties of cells and biological systems. Their aim is to design new synthetic routes for compounds and even create completely new molecules that may not exist in nature by exploiting the versatility of the life’s systems. Take the current work on silicon. Silicon is a ubiquitous element that sits next to carbon in the periodic table and shares some of its properties. The similarities in the ways silicon and carbon bond with other atoms have led to the idea that silicon might give rise to an alternative, silicon-based life with unique properties. Yet, silicon does not readily partake in biochemical couplings unless nudged to bind carbon via chemical synthesis. Organosilicon compounds that are thus created are highly valued for their ability to bind organic and inorganic substrates and are used as adhesives, sealants, and caulks. Their industrial synthesis is laborious, and thus the interest in bringing silicon into the fold of nature’s biochemistry persists. Now, advances in enzyme engineering have made it possible to incorporate silicon into organic compounds through bacterial biosynthetic pathways. Frances Arnold and her team (Kan et al., 2016Kan S.B.J. Lewis R.D. Chen K. Arnold F.H. Science. 2016; 354: 1048-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) have discovered that a cytochrome c protein from the thermophilic bacterium Rhodothermus marinus can, under the right conditions, catalyze the formation of a carbon-silicon bond to create short organosilicon compounds. The examination of the enzyme’s structure yields clues to the motifs driving this process, allowing the rapid directed evolution of an enzyme with high activity for making such products. Strikingly, this altered cytochrome c churns out silicon-containing compounds inside of bacteria, suggesting that relatively few tweaks are sufficient to bring silicon into the realm of in vivo synthesis, albeit under highly engineered conditions, and creating compounds that are not yet industrially relevant. Retooling an enzyme for a new production line may, however, require a more comprehensive overhaul of its properties. In a recent work from John Hartwig’s lab (Dydio et al., 2016Dydio P. Key H.M.

The widening of the biochemical space achieved with such manipulations is tantalizing, and the next frontier is making such artificial enzymes work inside of a cell, a challenging task, given the complex intracellular environment. Thomas Ward and colleagues (Jeschek et al., 2016Jeschek M. Reuter R. Heinisch T. Trindler C. Klehr J. Panke S. Ward T.R.

On a different spatial scale, other recent studies have endeavored to create large artificial structures within cells. Neil King, Wesley Sundquist, and colleagues (Votteler et al., 2016Votteler J.

Such structures can be released from their host eukaryotic cells and taken up by other cells, allowing the transfer of encapsulated cargo and representing a prototype hybrid biological material that can be used to perform complex tasks, such as exchange of metabolites or information, in a controlled and tailored manner. These examples of repurposing natural solutions are still at their proof-of-principle stage; however, they support the idea that biochemical reactions and cellular functions can be augmented to bring new elements to life and create unexpected biological products."

Similarly, lenalidomide induces ubiquitination and degradation of casein kinase 1A1 (CK1α), which accounts for the clinical efficacy of lenalidomide in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with deletion of chromosome 5q (del(5q)) (19.Krönke J.

Crystal structure studies reveal that the glutarimide moiety of lenalidomide directly inserts into a hydrophobic pocket of cereblon (CRBN), a CRL4 substrate receptor, and that the exposed chemical moiety, together with CRBN, creates a new surface for receiving substrates (20.Fischer E.S.

Human DDA1 (DDB1- and DET1-associated protein 1) is a small (12-kDa) DDB1-interacting protein that co-purifies with the Cul4-DDB1 complex (26.Jin J. Arias E.E. Chen J. Harper J.W. Walter J.C.

Molecular architecture and assembly of the DDB1-CUL4A ubiquitin ligase machinery.Nature. 2006; 443: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). DDA1 associates with some DDB1- and Cul4-associated factors and is assembled into CRL4 complexes (28.Olma M.H. Roy M. Le Bihan T. Sumara I. Maerki S. Larsen B. Quadroni M. Peter M. Tyers M.

Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but how this process is regulated remains elusive. Here we present evidence that the c-Abl non-receptor kinase phosphorylates DDB1 at residue Tyr-316 to recruit DDA1, leading to increased substrate ubiquitination. Furthermore, the newly approved anti-myeloma drug LBH589 (panobinostat) (29.Laubach J.P. Moreau P. San-Miguel J.F. Richardson P.G. Panobinostat for the treatment of multiple myeloma.Clin. Cancer Res. 2015; 21: 4767-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, stimulates c-Abl kinase activity to promote lenalidomide-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of IKZF transcription factors in MM cells, justifying their combination in treating MM patients for better clinical benefits. IMiDs target the CRL4CRBN ubiquitin ligase to induce the ubiquitination and degradation of IKZF1 and IKZF3 to block MM cell proliferation (17.Krönke J. Udeshi N.D. Narla A. Grauman P. Hurst S.N.

The myeloma drug lenalidomide promotes the cereblon-dependent destruction of Ikaros proteins.Science. 2014; 343: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). c-Abl was reported to bind and phosphorylate DDB1 (30.Cong F. Tang J. Hwang B.J. Vuong B.Q. Chu G. Goff S.P. Interaction between UV-damaged DNA binding activity proteins and the c-Abl tyrosine kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34870-34878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), an adaptor protein of the CRL4 complex, but the exact role of c-Abl in regulating CRL4 is not clear. We first tested whether c-Abl kinase affects the cytotoxicity of lenalidomide in MM cells. In our initial experiments, imatinib (Gleevec), an inhibitor of Abl family kinases, ameliorated the anti-proliferative activity of lenalidomide in several MM cell lines, including MM1S, MM1R, and U266 (Fig. 1, A–C). Deletion of Abl1, which encodes c-Abl, by CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing via lentiviral vectors similarly desensitized the cells to lenalidomide-induced cell death (Fig. 1, D and E). These results show that the activity of c-Abl kinase is required for optimal lenalidomide-induced inhibition of MM cell proliferation. c-Abl can be activated by multiple stress signals, such as cell adhesion (31.Lewis J.M. Baskaran R. Taagepera S. Schwartz M.A. Wang J.Y. Integrin regulation of c-Abl tyrosine kinase activity and cytoplasmic-nuclear transport.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 15174-15179Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) and DNA damage (32.Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D. Feller S.M. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D.W. Activation of the c-Abl tyrosine kinase in the stress response to DNA-damaging agents.Nature. 1995; 376: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Trichostatin A, a pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor, was reported to activate c-Abl by inducing chromatin distortion (33.Kaidi A. Jackson S.P. KAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation couples chromatin sensing to ATM signalling.Nature. 2013; 498: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). LBH589 (panobinostat), a pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor, has recently been approved to treat relapsed MM patients in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone (29.Laubach J.P. Moreau P. San-Miguel J.F. Richardson P.G. Panobinostat for the treatment of multiple myeloma.Clin. Cancer Res. 2015; 21: 4767-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We first generated an MM1S cell line stably expressing c-Abl by lentiviral vectors and treated these cells with increasing concentrations of LBH589. Using c-Abl self-phosphorylation (Tyr(P)-245) as a readout, we confirmed that LBH589 activated c-Abl kinase in a dose-dependent manner in these MM cells (Fig. 1F). To test whether LBH589 would affect lenalidomide cytotoxicity in MM cells by activating c-Abl, we treated MM1S cells with lenalidomide and LBH589 in the presence or absence of imatinib. Proliferation of MM1S cells was better inhibited by combination treatment with LBH589 and lenalidomide, but the enhanced inhibition could be abolished by imatinib treatment (Fig. 1G). Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid approved to treat MM in combination with IMiDs and proteasome inhibitors (34.Meijer E. Sonneveld P. Hematology: lenalidomide plus dexamethasone is effective in multiple myeloma.Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2009; 6: 247-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 35.Avigan D. Rosenblatt J. Current treatment for multiple myeloma.N. Engl. J. Med. 2014; 371: 961-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Little is known about the mechanism underlying how dexamethasone enhances the anti-myeloma activity of these drugs. We found that imatinib similarly reversed the dexamethasone-dependent increase of lenalidomide-induced MM cell proliferation arrest (Fig. 3A). We conclude that LBH589 and dexamethasone increase the cytotoxic effect of lenalidomide on MM cells by activating the c-Abl kinase. We next sought to determine whether c-Abl enhanced lenalidomide cytotoxicity by stimulating the turnover of the lenalidomide substrates IKZF1 and IKZF3. LBH589 increased lenalidomide-induced degradation of IKZF1/IKZF3 and loss of viability in lenalidomide-sensitive MM cell lines, including MM1S cells (Fig. 2A), OPM2 cells (Fig. 2B), and U266 cells (Fig. 2C), with no significant effect on the abundance of CRBN protein (Fig. 2, A–C). LBH589 did not alter IKZF1/IKZF3 levels or cause significant cytotoxicity in these sensitive cell lines as a single agent (Fig. 2, A–C, second lanes). We generated pomalidomide-resistant MM1S-P5000 cells by continuous culture of MM1S cells in medium containing gradually increasing concentrations of pomalidomide. The final pomalidomide concentration in medium was 5 μm to maintain the growth of these cells. MM1S-P5000 cells are also lenalidomide-resistant, likely because of the loss of CRBN expression (Fig. 2A). We found that LBH589 did not alter IKZF1/IKZF3 levels or cause obvious cytotoxicity in MM1S-P5000 cells as a single agent or even in combination with lenalidomide (Fig. 2A), suggesting that LBH589-induced cytotoxicity is dependent on lenalidomide. Deletion of c-Abl mitigated the decrease of IKZF1/IKZF3 protein levels and the arrest of cell proliferation in cells treated with LBH589 and lenalidomide (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, treatment with MLN4924, a neddylation inhibitor that inactivates all CRLs, including CRL4CRBN (36.Soucy T.A. Smith P.G. Milhollen M.A. Berger A.J. Gavin J.M. Adhikari S. Brownell J.E. Burke K.E. Cardin D.P. Critchley S. Cullis C.A. Doucette A. Garnsey J.J. Gaulin J.L. Gershman R.E. et al.An inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme as a new approach to treat cancer.Nature. 2009; 458: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar), completely rescued the decrease in IKZF1/IKZF3 protein abundance after treatment with either lenalidomide alone or a combination of LBH589 and lenalidomide in these three MM cell lines (Fig. 2E). As LBH589 activated c-Abl, we then examined whether c-Abl regulates the lenalidomide-dependent ubiquitination of IKZF1/IKZF3. IKZF1/IKZF3 ubiquitination was detectable in HEK 293T cells only when the cells were treated with lenalidomide, and expression of exogenous wild-type c-Abl, but not the kinase-defective c-Abl (Abl-KR), enhanced the levels of IKZF3 and IKZF1 ubiquitination (Fig. 2, F and G). These data suggest that LBH589 stimulates the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of IKZF1/IKZF3 in the presence of lenalidomide. Like LBH589, dexamethasone further destabilized IKZF3 protein (Fig. 3B) and reduced IKZF1/IKZF3 abundance (Fig. 3C) in lenalidomide-treated MM cells, leading to enhanced inhibition of MM1S (Fig. 3A) and OPM2 cell (Fig. 3D) proliferation. Co-treatment with imatinib abolished the dexamethasone-stimulated destabilization of IKZF3 (Fig. 3B) and inhibition of cell proliferation in lenalidomide-treated MM1S cells (Fig. 3A). Put together, these results suggest that LBH589 and dexamethasone promote lenalidomide-induced IKZF1/IKZF3 ubiquitination and degradation by activating c-Abl kinase. c-Abl was reported to bind and phosphorylate DDB1 (30.Cong F. Tang J. Hwang B.J. Vuong B.Q. Chu G. Goff S.P. Interaction between UV-damaged DNA binding activity proteins and the c-Abl tyrosine kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34870-34878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and promote the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of DDB2 in cells exposed to UV damage (37.Chen X. Zhang J. Lee J. Lin P.S. Ford J.M. Zheng N. Zhou P. A kinase-independent function of c-Abl in promoting proteolytic destruction of damaged DNA binding proteins.Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 489-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We confirmed that c-Abl kinase phosphorylated DDB1 in a kinase-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). However, which sites of DDB1 are phosphorylated is not clear. There are three potential c-Abl target sites in the primary sequence of DDB1 protein with the consensus YXXP sequence (Fig. 4B): Tyr-182 and Tyr-718 on the exposed surface and Tyr-678 inside the DDB1-Cul4 binding scaffold (27.Angers S. Li T. Yi X. MacCoss M.J. Moon R.T. Zheng N. Molecular architecture and assembly of the DDB1-CUL4A ubiquitin ligase machinery.Nature. 2006; 443: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Mutation at Tyr-182 or Tyr-718, but not Tyr-678, reduced the phosphorylation of DDB1 (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that c-Abl phosphorylates diverse tyrosines of DDB1 protein. Interestingly, we found that c-Abl kinase promoted the interaction of DDB1 with DDA1 (Fig. 5A), a small protein (12 kDa) with no obvious motif and likely a positive regulator of the CRL4 ligase (28.Olma M.H. Roy M. Le Bihan T. Sumara I. Maerki S. Larsen B. Quadroni M. Peter M. Tyers M. Pintard L. An interaction network of the mammalian COP9 signalosome identifies Dda1 as a core subunit of multiple Cul4-based E3 ligases.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of c-Abl is essential for the increased DDB1-DDA1 interaction because treating cells with imatinib or expressing kinase-defective Abl-KR abolished this effect (Fig. 5A). A conserved cluster of residues (Tyr-316/Asp-318/Asn-319) on one of the three seven-bladed WD40 β propellers (BPA, BPB, and BPC) of DDB1 (27.Angers S. Li T. Yi X. MacCoss M.J. Moon R.T. Zheng N. Molecular architecture and assembly of the DDB1-CUL4A ubiquitin ligase machinery.Nature. 2006; 443: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) is required for DDA1 interaction (26.Jin J. Arias E.E. Chen J. Harper J.W. Walter J.C. A family of diverse Cul4-Ddb1-interacting proteins includes Cdt2, which is required for S phase destruction of the replication factor Cdt1.Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 709-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Conversion of Tyr-316 of DDB1 to Phe completely abrogated the interaction of DDB1 and DDA1, which also failed to be enhanced by c-Abl expression (Fig. 5B). However, the total tyrosine phosphorylation of DDB1 was only marginally reduced by this mutation (Fig. 5B), consistent with DDB1 harboring additional sites (Tyr-182 and Tyr-718) phosphorylated by c-Abl. Besides, c-Abl-induced recruitment of DDA1 was independent of phosphorylation at these two sites (Fig. 5C). Triple mutations (TMs) in Tyr-316/Tyr-182/Tyr-718 of DDB1 exhibited a more severe phosphorylation defect than the double mutations (DMs, Tyr-182/Tyr-718), indicating that all three tyrosine residues are phosphorylated (Fig. 5C). c-Abl phosphorylated DDB1 mostly in the cytoplasm, enriched DDA1 in the nucleus, and promoted the assembly of the DDB1-DDA1 complex in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 5D). These data demonstrate that DDB1 is phosphorylated by c-Abl at Tyr-316 to recruit DDA1. To address the role of DDA1 in lenalidomide-induced substrate turnover, we examined the ubiquitination and stability of IKZF3 protein overexpressed in HEK 293T cells with knockdown of DDA1 expression. Expression of c-Abl increased the levels of ubiquitinated IKZF3, whereas knocking down DDA1 reduced both the basal and Abl-induced IKZF3 ubiquitination levels (Fig. 6, A and B). Similarly, lenalidomide-dependent destabilization of IKZF3 was abrogated by knockdown of DDA1 expression but enhanced by overexpression of c-Abl with intact kinase activity (Fig. 6, C and D). Expression of c-Abl without lenalidomide treatment did not alter IKZF3 stability (Fig. 6C). Put together, these results suggest that DDA1 is recruited to DDB1 at phosphorylated Tyr-316 to promote lenalidomide-induced ubiquitination and degradation of IKZF3. In summary, we have uncovered a mechanism underlying clinically approved combination treatment options with lenalidomide for MM (Fig. 7). Other than their inherent cytotoxicity, small-molecule drugs such as LBH589 and dexamethasone can activate the c-Abl kinase, which phosphorylates DDB1 at Tyr-316 to recruit DDA1, leading to increased substrate ubiquitination. CRL4 assembles with a subset of WD40 proteins to target a variety of substrates to regulate the cell cycle, chromatin functions, and DNA damage repair (1.Jackson S. Xiong Y.

These data suggest that c-Abl kinase can increase the ubiquitination of diverse substrates of CRL4 E3 ligase. In this way, it would be interesting to explore the functional significance of c-Abl activation in regulating the turnover of the various CRL4 substrates in physiological or pathological processes. DDA1 is a small protein without an obvious motif that co-purifies with the Cul4-DDB1 complex (26.Jin J. Arias E.E. Chen J. Harper J.W. Walter J.C.

The resultant Bt poplar seeds occurred at a frequency of ~0.15% at 0 m to ~0.02% at 500 m from the Bt poplar plantation. The germination of Bt poplar seeds diminished within three weeks in the field (germination rate from 68% to 0%) compared to 48% after three weeks of storage at 4°C. The survival rate of seedlings in the field was 0% without any treatment but increased to 1.7% under the addition of four treatments (cleaning and trimming, watering, weeding, and covering with plastic film to maintain moisture) after being seeded in the field for eight weeks. The results of this study indicate that gene flow originating from the Bt poplar plantation occurred at an extremely low level through pollen or seeds under natural conditions. This study provides first-hand field data on the extent of transgene flow in poplar plantations and offers guidance for the risk assessment of transgenic poplar plantations."
https://openalex.org/W2578018289,"Purpose To evaluate the effects of repeated intravitreal ranibizumab injections on corneal sensitivity, corneal sub-basal nerve plexus (SBNP) and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Methods Sixty-six eyes of 33 patients who had received unilateral repeated intravitreal ranibizumab injections (0.5 mg/0.05 ml) for the treatment of AMD and 25 eyes of 25 healthy subjects were included in the study. Central corneal sensation was measured using the contact Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer. The laser scanning in vivo corneal confocal microscope was used to determine corneal SBNP parameters. The peripapillary RNFL thickness was assessed with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Data obtained from the ranibizumab-injected eyes were compared with those of the fellow non-treated eyes and the eyes of the healthy control subjects. Results The mean number of ranibizumab injections per eye was 8.9±5.0 (range 3–20). There were no statistically significant differences in the central corneal sensitivity threshold and corneal SBNP parameters between the ranibizumab-injected eyes and the fellow untreated eyes or between those with neovascular AMD and the healthy control group (P>0.05 for all). The average peripapillary RNFL thickness of the treated eyes did not differ significantly to the fellow eyes (P = 0.237), and the eyes of healthy control subjects (P = 0.918). There were no significant correlations between the number of ranibizumab injections and any of the study parameters. Conclusions Multiple intravitreal injections of ranibizumab seem to have no harmful effects on corneal sensitivity, innervation and peripapillary RNFL thickness in patients with AMD."

Shin et al. introduce a novel optogenetic tool, which enables different phase-space regimes inside living cells to be assessed and the transition paths between them to be studied with unprecedented spatiotemporal control. Phase separation of proteins is recognized as an important aspect of cellular organization and disease mechanisms. Shin et al. introduce a novel optogenetic tool, which enables different phase-space regimes inside living cells to be assessed and the transition paths between them to be studied with unprecedented spatiotemporal control. That proteins can change phases comes as no surprise to biochemists who dread the nightmare of protein precipitation nor to crystallographers who depend on controlled protein aggregation into a crystalline state for their studies. Yet, phase separation of proteins is a relatively new concept in cell biology and is encountered under a variety of guises depending on context. For example, two P granules, membraneless cellular bodies that exhibit many characteristics of a distinct liquid phase within a cell cytoplasm (Brangwynne et al., 2009Brangwynne C.P. Eckmann C.R. Courson D.S. Rybarska A. Hoege C. Gharakhani J. Jülicher F. Hyman A.A. Science. 2009; 324: 1729-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar), can coalesce into a single larger one. More generally, phase separation—a property of fluids that any of us can observe as droplet formation after mixing oil and vinegar—is now recognized as an effective compartmentalization strategy for the cell as it facilitates localized high concentrations of specific proteins and factors, including RNAs. At the same time, the dynamic nature of these membraneless droplets maintains a continuous exchange of molecules with the surrounding cellular milieu. Quantitative studies of these processes within cells have been limited, but in this issue of Cell, Shin et al., 2017Shin Y. Berry J. Pannucci N. Haataja M.P. Toettcher J.E. Brangwynne C.P. Cell. 2017; 168 (this issue): 159-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar introduce a novel optogenetic tool that allows unprecedented spatiotemporal control of phase transitions inside living cells. Several studies in recent years have contributed to our understanding of the factors involved in the formation and maintenance of these discrete, membraneless “reaction centers,” which include tuning of protein concentration, binding strength, the number of interactions that can be formed (multivalency), salt conditions, crowding, and temperature (for a review, see Hyman et al., 2014Hyman A.A. Weber C.A. Jülicher F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2014; 30: 39-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1450) Google Scholar). However, due to the emerging nature of those discoveries, our understanding of how phase separation of large biomolecules like protein and RNA makes integral functional contributions to living cells is undermined by a lack of tools that can simplify this complex system and enable specific in vivo processes to be probed, controlled, and tested. The approach presented by Shin et al., 2017Shin Y. Berry J. Pannucci N. Haataja M.P. Toettcher J.E. Brangwynne C.P. Cell. 2017; 168 (this issue): 159-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, termed optoDroplet, is based on fusing a phase-separating protein of interest with the photolyase homology region of Arabidopsis thaliana cryptochrome 2 (CRY2), which self-associates upon illumination with blue light. The light dose offers a powerful way to control the strength of protein self-association and thus to trigger phase separation (see Figure 1). The authors demonstrated their optogenetic approach on aggregation-prone (phase separation prone) domains from three proteins—FUS, HNRNPA1, and DDX4—studied as protein fusions with CRY2 and GFP. GFP serves here as a convenient readout of protein concentration. Modulating the light dose, the authors mapped the conditions under which liquid to liquid phase separation, i.e., droplet formation, can occur. Notably, they discovered sharp boundaries where switch-like behavior demarking phase separation was observed, in agreement with previous studies (Molliex et al., 2015Molliex A. Temirov J. Lee J.

Cell. 2015; 57: 936-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have highlighted that phase separation is not a black and white scenario. A liquid-to-solid phase transition yielding more fibrillar, amyloid-like aggregates, potentially linked to aging of the droplets, can cause loss of the dynamics seen within the liquid phase (Lin et al., 2015Lin Y. Protter D.S. Rosen M.K. Parker R. Mol. Cell. 2015; 60: 208-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, Patel et al., 2015Patel A. Lee H.O. Jawerth L. Maharana S. Jahnel M.

The optoDroplet system can also induce phase-separated states with arrested dynamics in live cells. Use of high illumination power drove phase separation far beyond the liquid phase separation boundary, resulting initially in gel-like aggregates with irregular morphology that could dissolve over time. The subsequent observation that multiple cycles of gel assembly triggered the irreversible formation of aggregates led the authors to suggest that the gel state and not the liquid state promotes the formation of static aggregate structures. This intriguing suggestion therefore has implications for our current understanding of the development of pathogenic phenotypes linked to amyloid appearance such as Alzheimer’s and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A challenge of phase separation is that it extends the number of supramolecular states—the phase space—that we need to consider when thinking about cell biological mechanisms and distinguishing artifacts from physiological states. As the optoDroplet approach allows precise tuning of key parameters affecting phase separation, the authors were also able to develop models to assess the entire concentration and light dependent phase space (a 2D phase diagram) and use it to predict in vivo behavior of proteins that were then validated. While it is a long way to go from the custom-designed optoDroplet protein system to the full complexity of the cell, the quantitative description of the phase space is exciting. Such approaches will increase our ability to compare studies done under diverse conditions by different labs and might help to reconcile seemingly conflicting results in the literature. Since established optogenetic methods offer a plethora of genetically encoded tools, extending the technique to enable multicolor control would be a feasible development to broaden our ability to probe multicomponent systems, such as those recently discovered for nucleoli and stress granules. These cellular bodies appear to be composed of phase-separated structures formed from a static gel-like core surrounded by a dynamic liquid phase (Feric et al., 2016Feric M. Vaidya N. Harmon T.S. Mitrea D.M. Zhu L. Richardson T.M. Kriwacki R.W. Pappu R.V. Brangwynne C.P. Cell. 2016; 165: 1686-1697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, Jain et al., 2016Jain S. Wheeler J.R. Walters R.W. Agrawal A. Barsic A. Parker R. Cell. 2016; 164: 487-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). However, even the most sophisticated light-based control mechanisms will only be able to resolve parts of the mysteries around phase separation. It is intriguing that many liquid-liquid phase separating proteins contain intrinsically disordered domains (IDD), which lack stable structure in their native state, as well RNA binding domains (RBB). In fact, the underlying design principle of the fusion construct presented by Shin et al., 2017Shin Y. Berry J. Pannucci N. Haataja M.P. Toettcher J.E. Brangwynne C.P. Cell. 2017; 168 (this issue): 159-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar was to swap the RBB domain with CRY2 and fuse this to the IDD domain of FUS, HNRNPA1, and DDX4. Future studies combining the optoDroplet method with systematic mutagenesis could enable a better understanding of the functional relevance of sequence composition and complexity of the IDD. However, the very design of the optoDroplet tool precludes asking at the same time what role the properties of RNA play. As RNA mixtures are frequently added to in vitro phase separation experiments and are abundant in many of the cellular bodies studied for phase separation, questions about whether it is an important but inert bystander or what specific aspects of RNA structure or chemistry are critical for functional phase separated droplets still remain to be investigated. Right now, our tools to control and study RNA function are underdeveloped compared to proteins. With the innovative concept introduced here, the authors have ushered in a new generation of in vivo, quantitative, phase separation studies, which will hopefully shed light on the physiological and pathogenic aspects of such processes.

https://openalex.org/W2575009990,"Aminoalcohols have been addressed as activating buffers for alkaline phosphatase. However, there is no record on the buffer activation regarding organophosphorus hydrolase (OPH). Here we reported the activating effects of aminoalcohols on OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), an analog molecule of G-type warfare agents. The kinetic parametors kcat, Vmax and kcat/Km in the OPH reaction were remarkably increased in the buffers (pH 8.0, 25°C) containing aminoalcohols with C2 between nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) in their structures, including triethanolamine (TEA), diethanolamine, monoethanolamine, 1-amino-2-propanol, 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol, and triisopropanolamine. In contrast, much lower or no rate-enhancing effects were observed in the adding of amines, alcohols, amine/alcohol mixtures, or 3-amino-1-propanol (C3 between N and O). The 300 mM TEA further increased DFP-degrading activities of OPH mutants F132Y and L140Y, the previously reported OPH mutants with desirable activities towards DFP. However, the treatment of ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) markedly abolished the TEA-induced activation of OPH. The product fluoride effectively inhibited OPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of DFP by a linear mixed inhibition (inhibition constant Ki ~ 3.21 mM), which was partially released by TEA adding at initial or later reaction stage. The obtained results indicate the activation of OPH by aminoalcohol buffers could be attributed to the reduction of fluoride inhibition, which would be beneficial to the hydrolase-based detoxification of organophosphofluoridate."
