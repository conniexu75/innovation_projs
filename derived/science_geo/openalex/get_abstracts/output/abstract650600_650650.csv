https://openalex.org/W3015631361,"Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have shown promise in predicting susceptibility to common diseases1-3. We estimated their added value in clinical risk prediction of five common diseases, using large-scale biobank data (FinnGen; n = 135,300) and the FINRISK study with clinical risk factors to test genome-wide PRSs for coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, atrial fibrillation, breast cancer and prostate cancer. We evaluated the lifetime risk at different PRS levels, and the impact on disease onset and on prediction together with clinical risk scores. Compared to having an average PRS, having a high PRS contributed 21% to 38% higher lifetime risk, and 4 to 9 years earlier disease onset. PRSs improved model discrimination over age and sex in type 2 diabetes, atrial fibrillation, breast cancer and prostate cancer, and over clinical risk in type 2 diabetes, breast cancer and prostate cancer. In all diseases, PRSs improved reclassification over clinical thresholds, with the largest net reclassification improvements for early-onset coronary heart disease, atrial fibrillation and prostate cancer. This study provides evidence for the additional value of PRSs in clinical disease prediction. The practical applications of polygenic risk information for stratified screening or for guiding lifestyle and medical interventions in the clinical setting remain to be defined in further studies."
https://openalex.org/W3015490153,"This study was designed to test the efficacy of an air treatment using ozone and relative humidity (RH) for the inactivation of airborne viruses. Four phages (φX174, PR772, MS2 and φ6) and one eukaryotic virus (murine norovirus MNV-1) were exposed to low ozone concentrations (1.23 ppm for phages and 0.23 ppm for MNV-1) and various levels of RH for 10 to 70 minutes. The inactivation of these viruses was then assessed to determine which of the tested conditions provided the greatest reduction in virus infectivity. An inactivation of at least two orders of magnitude for φX174, MS2 and MNV-1 was achieved with an ozone exposure of 40 minutes at 85% RH. For PR772 and φ6, exposure to the reference condition at 20% RH for 10 minutes yielded the same results. These findings suggest that ozone used at a low concentration is a powerful disinfectant for airborne viruses when combined with a high RH. Air treatment could therefore be implemented inside hospital rooms ventilated naturally."

https://openalex.org/W3015928967,"Depression is a major public health concern in the U.S. and globally. While successful early identification and treatment can lead to many positive health and behavioral outcomes, depression, remains undiagnosed, untreated or undertreated due to several reasons, including denial of the illness as well as cultural and social stigma. With the ubiquity of social media platforms, millions of people are now sharing their online persona by expressing their thoughts, moods, emotions, and even their daily struggles with mental health on social media. Unlike traditional observational cohort studies conducted through questionnaires and self-reported surveys, we explore the reliable detection of depressive symptoms from tweets obtained, unobtrusively. Particularly, we examine and exploit multimodal big (social) data to discern depressive behaviors using a wide variety of features including individual-level demographics. By developing a multimodal framework and employing statistical techniques to fuse heterogeneous sets of features obtained through the processing of visual, textual, and user interaction data, we significantly enhance the current state-of-the-art approaches for identifying depressed individuals on Twitter (improving the average F1-Score by 5 percent) as well as facilitate demographic inferences from social media. Besides providing insights into the relationship between demographics and mental health, our research assists in the design of a new breed of demographic-aware health interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3015654211,"Tumor associated angiogenesis is the development of new blood vessels in response to proteins secreted by tumor cells. These new blood vessels allow tumors to continue to grow beyond what the pre-existing vasculature could support. Here, we construct a mathematical model to simulate tumor angiogenesis by considering each endothelial cell as an agent, and allowing the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nutrient fields to impact the dynamics and phenotypic transitions of each tumor and endothelial cell. The phenotypes of the endothelial cells (i.e., tip, stalk, and phalanx cells) are selected by the local VEGF field, and govern the migration and growth of vessel sprouts at the cellular level. Over time, these vessels grow and migrate to the tumor, forming anastomotic loops to supply nutrients, while interacting with the tumor through mechanical forces and the consumption of VEGF. The model is able to capture collapsing and breaking of vessels caused by tumor-endothelial cell interactions. This is accomplished through modeling the physical interaction between the vasculature and the tumor, resulting in vessel occlusion and tumor heterogeneity over time due to the stages of response in angiogenesis. Key parameters are identified through a sensitivity analysis based on the Sobol method, establishing which parameters should be the focus of subsequent experimental efforts. During the avascular phase (i.e., before angiogenesis is triggered), the nutrient consumption rate, followed by the rate of nutrient diffusion, yield the greatest influence on the number and distribution of tumor cells. Similarly, the consumption and diffusion of VEGF yield the greatest influence on the endothelial and tumor cell numbers during angiogenesis. In summary, we present a hybrid mathematical approach that characterizes vascular changes via an agent-based model, while treating nutrient and VEGF changes through a continuum model. The model describes the physical interaction between a tumor and the surrounding blood vessels, explicitly allowing the forces of the growing tumor to influence the nutrient delivery of the vasculature."
https://openalex.org/W3016206823,"The microbial community in the plant rhizosphere is vital to plant productivity and disease resistance. Alterations in the composition and diversity of species within this community could be detrimental if microbes suppressing the activity of pathogens are removed. Species of the insect-pathogenic fungus, Metarhizium, commonly employed as biological control agents against crop pests, have recently been identified as plant root colonizers and provide a variety of benefits (e.g. growth promotion, drought resistance, nitrogen acquisition). However, the impact of Metarhizium amendment on the rhizosphere microbiome has yet to be elucidated. Using Illumina sequencing, we examined the community profiles (bacteria and fungi) of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) rhizosphere (loose soil and plant root) after amendment with M. robertsii conidia, in the presence and absence of an insect host. Although alpha diversity was not significantly affected overall, there were numerous examples of plant growth-promoting organisms that significantly increased with Metarhizium amendment (Bradyrhizobium, Flavobacterium, Chaetomium, Trichoderma). Specifically, the abundance of Bradyrhizobium, a group of nitrogen-fixing bacteria, was confirmed to be increased using a qPCR assay with genus-specific primers. In addition, the ability of the microbiome to suppress the activity of a known bean root pathogen was assessed. The development of disease symptoms after application with Fusarium solani f. sp. phaseoli was visible in the hypocotyl and upper root of plants grown in sterilized soil but was suppressed during growth in microbiome soil and soil treated with M. robertsii. Successful amendment of agricultural soils with biocontrol agents such as Metarhizium necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the effects on the diversity of the rhizosphere microbiome. Such research is fundamentally important towards sustainable agricultural practices to improve overall plant health and productivity."
https://openalex.org/W3015403671,"Background Sexually explicit media exposure during early adolescence has been found to be associated with risky sexual behavior. However, previous study suffered from methodological issue, such as selection bias. Furthermore, little is known about the effect of multi-modality sexually explicit media exposure on risky sexual behavior, and how this relationship can be applied to non-western societies. Objectives This study aimed to improve upon previous studies by using instrumental variable estimation. In addition, this study also included multi-modality of sexually explicit media and three risky sexual behavior measure from a sample of Taiwanese adolescents. Methods Participants were recruited from a prospective longitudinal study (Taiwan Youth Project). All were in 7th grade (mean age = 13.3) when the study was initiated in 2000. Sexually explicit media exposure, including ever-exposure and number of modalities exposed to, was measured in wave 2 (8th grade). Risky sexual behavior was measured in waves 8 (mean age = 20.3) and 10 (mean age = 24.3). A two-stage least squares regression was employed, with pubertal timing as the instrumental variable. Results About 50% of participants had been exposed to sexual media content by 8th grade, from an average of one modality. Sexually explicit media exposure predicted early sexual debut, unsafe sex, and multiple sexual partners (all: p < .05). Furthermore, exposure to more media modalities increased the likelihood of risky sexual behaviors. However, only the effect on early sexual debut was gender invariant. Conclusions Exposure to sexually explicit media in early adolescence had a substantive relationship with risky sexual behavior in the emerging adulthood. Knowledge of this causal like effect provides a basis for building better preventive programs in early adolescence. One prominent way is early education on media literacy, and physicians themselves may need to be familiar with such content to initiate it."
https://openalex.org/W3015861324,"There is compelling evidence implicating intestinal permeability in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we examined the role of bile acids (BA) in western diet (WD)-induced loss of colonic epithelial barrier (CEB) function in mice with a genetic impairment in intestinal epithelial barrier function, junctional adhesion molecule A knockout mice, F11r-/- . WD-fed knockout mice developed severe NASH, which was associated with increased BA concentration in the cecum and loss of CEB function. Analysis of cecal BA composition revealed selective increases in primary unconjugated BAs in the WD-fed mice, which correlated with increased abundance of microbial taxa linked to BA metabolism. In vitro permeability assays revealed that chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), which was elevated in the cecum of WD-fed mice, increased paracellular permeability, while the BA-binding resin sevelamer hydrochloride protected against CDCA-induced loss of barrier function. Sequestration of intestinal BAs by in vivo delivery of sevelamer to WD-fed knockout mice attenuated colonic mucosal inflammation and improved CEB. Sevelamer also reduced hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, and improved metabolic derangements associated with NASH. Collectively, these findings highlight a hitherto unappreciated role for BAs in WD-induced impairment of the intestinal epithelial barrier in NASH."
https://openalex.org/W3015395474,"Disrupted mitochondrial function and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation cause cellular damage and oxidative stress-induced macrophage inflammatory cell death. It remains unclear how mitochondrial dysfunction relates to inflammasome activation and pyroptotic cell death. In this study, we demonstrated that tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) regulates mitochondrial ROS production and promotes TLR agonist LPS plus nigericin (LPS/Ng)-induced inflammasome and pyroptosis in mouse primary macrophages and human monocyte THP-1 cells. Co-IP assays confirmed that TRAF3 forms a complex with TRAF2 and cIAP1 and mediates ubiquitin and degradation of Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1). Moreover, knockdown of ULK1 in THP-1 cells significantly promoted LPS/Ng-induced inflammasome by activating caspase 1 and mature IL-1β. Apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) translocation from mitochondrial to nuclear was observed in ULK1-deficient THP-1 cells under LPS/Ng stimulation, which mediates LPS/Ng-induced cell death in ULK1 deficient macrophages. In conclusion, this study identified a novel role of TRAF3 in regulation of ULK1 ubiquitination and inflammasome signaling and provided molecular mechanisms by which ubiquitination of ULK1 controls mitochondrial ROS production, inflammasome activity, and AIF-dependent pyroptosis."
https://openalex.org/W3015895961,"Using data from the real world to solve clinical questions that cannot be answered using data from clinical trials is attracting more attention. Clinical outcomes for patients with esophageal cancer in a real-world setting might be different from data in randomized controlled trials. This study aimed to provide real world data on treatment and prognosis in Korean patients with esophageal cancer. This retrospective cancer cohort included newly diagnosed cases of esophageal cancer at 19 tertiary hospitals between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2017. Cancer staging was defined according to the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer criteria. We identified 6,354 patients with newly diagnosed esophageal cancer (mean age: 64.9 ± 9.0 years, 96.9% squamous cell carcinoma). The proportion of early esophageal cancer increased from 24.7% in 2005 to 37.2% in 2015 (p<0.001). Among all cases, surgery alone was 31.3%, followed by definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) (27.0%), neoadjuvant therapy (12.4%), adjuvant therapy (11.1%), and endoscopic resection (5.8%). The 5-year overall survival rate was 45.7 ± 0.7%. Endoscopic resection provided similar median survival relative to surgery for stage Ia cases. Among stage II–III cases, definitive CCRT was associated with poorer survival than neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy, although there was no survival difference between neo-adjuvant and adjuvant therapy. Early esophageal cancer is gradually becoming more common and endoscopic resection provided similar long-term survival relative to surgery. Surgery with combined therapy provided better survival in locally advanced esophageal cancer, relative to definitive CCRT."
https://openalex.org/W3015382316,"Background India is expected to experience an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events in the coming decades, which poses serious risks to human health and wellbeing in the country. Objective This paper aims to shed light on the possible detrimental effects of monsoon weather shocks on childhood undernutrition in India using the Demographic and Health Survey 2015–16, in combination with geo-referenced climate data. Methods Undernutrition is captured through measures of height-for-age, weight-for-height, stunting and wasting among children aged 0–59 months. The standardised precipitation and evapotranspiration index (SPEI) is used to measure climatic conditions during critical periods of child development. Results The results of a multivariate logistic regression model show that climate anomalies experienced in utero and during infancy are associated with an increased risk of child undernutrition; exposure to excessive monsoon precipitation during these early periods of life elevates the risk of stunting, particularly for children in the tropical wet and humid sub-tropical regions. In contrast, the risk of stunting is reduced for children residing in the mountainous areas who have experienced excessive monsoon precipitation during infancy. The evidence on the short-term effects of climate shocks on wasting is inconclusive. We additionally show that excessive precipitation, particularly during the monsoon season, is associated with an increased risk of contracting diarrhoea among children under five. Diseases transmitted through water, such as diarrhoea, could be one important channel through which excessive rainfall increases the risk of stunting. Conclusions We find a positive association between childhood undernutrition and exposure to excessive monsoon precipitation in India. Pronounced differences across climate zones are found. The findings of the present analysis warn of the urgent need to provide health assistance to children in flood-prone areas."
https://openalex.org/W3015881183,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/ Chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) has been associated with abnormalities in mitochondrial function. In this study we have analysed previous bioenergetics data in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using new techniques in order to further elucidate differences between ME/CFS and healthy control cohorts. We stratified our ME/CFS cohort into two individual cohorts representing moderately and severely affected patients in order to determine if disease severity is associated with bioenergetic function in PBMCs. Both ME/CFS cohorts showed reduced mitochondrial function when compared to a healthy control cohort. This shows that disease severity does not correlate with mitochondrial function and even those with a moderate form of the disease show evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction. Equations devised by another research group have enabled us to calculate ATP-linked respiration rates and glycolytic parameters. Parameters of glycolytic function were calculated by taking into account respiratory acidification. This revealed severely affected ME/CFS patients to have higher rates of respiratory acidification and showed the importance of accounting for respiratory acidification when calculating parameters of glycolytic function. Analysis of previously published glycolysis data, after taking into account respiratory acidification, showed severely affected patients have reduced glycolysis compared to moderately affected patients and healthy controls. Rates of ATP-linked respiration were also calculated and shown to be lower in both ME/CFS cohorts. This study shows that severely affected patients have mitochondrial and glycolytic impairments, which sets them apart from moderately affected patients who only have mitochondrial impairment. This may explain why these patients present with a more severe phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W3015906451,"Let-7i modulates the physical function and inflammation in endothelial cells (ECs). However, whether the let-7i of ECs involves in brain vasculature and ischemic stroke is unknown. Using inducible Cadherin5-Cre lineage-tracking mice, a loxp-RNA-sponge conditional knockdown of let-7 in ECs- induced increase of transforming growth factor-β receptor type 1 (TGF-βR1), endothelial-mesenchymal transition (endMT), vascular fibrosis, and opening of the brain-blood barrier (BBB). By this lineage-tracking mice, we found that ECs underwent endMT after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Through specifically overexpressed let-7i in ECs, we found that it reduced TGF-βR1, endMT, and vascular fibrosis. Furthermore, this overexpression reduced the infarct volume and leakage of the BBB, and improved the neurological function. Further, the expression of let-7i decreased after MCAO, but was reversed by antagonist of TGF-βR1 or inhibition of Mek phosphorylation. And the inhibition of Mek attenuated the vascular fibrosis after MCAO. In summary, we concluded that ischemic stroke activates a let-7i/TGF-βR1 double-negative feedback loop, thereby inducing endMT and vascular fibrosis. These results suggest that endMT is a potential target for the treatment of cerebral vascular fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3015396701,"Proteomic analyses indicate that STAT1 protein (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 or transcription factor ISGF-3 components p91/p84) is upregulated in some colorectal cancers. This study examined 736 colorectal cancer patients for the expression of STAT1 protein in tissue specimens, including 614 early stage patients and 122 advanced stage patients. Tissue microarrays were constructed, and STAT1 expression was examined by immunohistochemistry and scored semi-quantitatively. Among all cases, 9% of cases displayed high levels of cytoplasmic expression of STAT1 and 15% of cases had positive nuclear expression. Based on statistical analyses of a cohort of 559 early stage patients with survival data and no neoadjuvant therapy, we found that high levels of cytoplasmic expression of STAT1 correlated with shorter survival time in early stage colorectal cancer, particularly of the microsatellite instability (MSI) subtype. Additional analysis of a 244-case cohort of colorectal cancers from the Cancer Genome Atlas found that STAT1 gene expression correlated positively with PD-L1 (CD274) and PD-1 (PDCD1) but had no correlation with KRAS or BRAF mutation status. STAT1 expression showed no clear correlation with any of the 4 clinical diagnostic markers of mismatch repair, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, suggesting its potential as an independent outcome marker for MSI cancers. Our findings suggest that STAT1 may be used as a potential prognostic protein marker for stratifying the outcome risk of early stage MSI colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3015759228,"We aimed to explore continuity of health care and health barriers, facilitators, and opportunities for people at the time of release from a provincial correctional facility in Ontario, Canada. We conducted focus groups in community-based organizations in a city in Ontario, Canada: a men's homeless shelter, a mental health service organization, and a social service agency with programs for people with substance use disorders. We included adults who spoke English well enough to participate in the discussion and who had been released from the provincial correctional facility in the previous year. We conducted three focus groups with 18 total participants. Participants had complex health needs on release, including ongoing physical and psychological impacts of time in custody. They identified lack of access to high quality health care; lack of housing, employment, social services, and social supports; and discrimination on the basis of incarceration history as barriers to health on release. Access to health care, housing, social services, and social supports all facilitated health on release. To address health needs on release, participants suggested providing health information in jail, improving discharge planning, and developing accessible clinics in the community. This pilot study identified opportunities to support health at the time of release from jail, including delivery of programs in jail, linkage with and development of programs in the community, and efforts to support structural changes to prevent and address discrimination. These data will inform ongoing work to support health and continuity of care on release from a provincial correctional facility."
https://openalex.org/W3016266178,"Aim This study sought to clarify the usefulness of lenvatinib for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods The subjects were 69 patients with HCC receiving lenvatinib; the median age was 73 years, and 14 and 67 patients had been previously treated with regorafenib and/or sorafenib and therapies without molecular-targeted agents, respectively. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated using contrast-enhanced CT images obtained 4–8 weeks after the start of lenvatinib and the middle-term outcome using Kaplan-Meier method. Results The baseline Child-Pugh scores were 5, 6 and 7 in 31, 32 and 6 patients, respectively, and the modified albumin-bilirubin (mALBI) grades were 1, 2a and 2b in 20, 20 and 29 patients, respectively. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stages following downsizing after prior treatment were A, B and C in 17, 22 and 30 patients, respectively. The therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in 54 patients, and the percentages of patients achieving CR, PR, SD and PD were 3.7%, 44.4%, 37.0%, and 14.8%, respectively. The ALBI scores deteriorated significantly between 4 and 12 weeks after the start of therapy, compared with the baseline. The cumulative survival rates at 48 weeks were significantly higher among patients achieving CR/PR (95.5%) than among those showing no response (54.3%). Multivariate analyses revealed that the BCLC stages and the serum AFP levels were significantly associated with therapeutic efficacy, while the mALBI grade was associated with the middle-term outcome. Conclusions A favorable middle-term outcome was obtained in patients with HCC receiving lenvatinib, especially in those manifesting grades 1/2a mALBI at baseline, despite the deterioration in ALBI scores during treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3016181090,"Mental disorders and suicidality among adolescents have been identified as a major public health concern worldwide; however, they often do not get the necessary attention from parents, school and health professional, and therefore are left untreated. This study aimed to investigate the factors associated with the use of mental health services among Australian adolescents aged 13-17 with mental disorders and/or suicidality.Adolescents aged 13-17 (n = 2134) from Young Minds Matter (YMM): the Second Australian Child and Adolescent Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing were included in this study. The YMM is a cross-sectional nationwide survey, in which information was collected from both parents and adolescents (aged 13-17 years). Both bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify the factors that have an impact on the use of mental health services (outcome variable) in two subsamples: (1) adolescents with mental disorder and (2) adolescents with suicidality.Overall, 740 (34.7%) and 168 (7.9%) adolescents reported a mental disorder and/or suicidality, respectively. The incidence of seeking any service was higher among adolescents with suicidality (approximately 50%) compared to those with a mental disorder (about 30%). Girls, older age-group (15-17), adolescents living with disadvantaged families (lower-income, less educated and unemployed parents), those who had multiple mental disorders and history of substance use were most likely to use mental health services regardless of mental disorder and suicidality. Health services and online services were the most popular type of mental health service among adolescents aged 13-17 across two subgroups, while, school and telephone services were less utilized.Many adolescents with mental disorders and/or suicidality do not use mental health services. The findings indicate differences in factors associated with the use of mental health services among adolescents with mental disorder and suicidality. Further research is needed to address the specific barriers that limit the use of the services."
https://openalex.org/W3015211639,"Despite increasing research on the gut-skin axis, there is a lack of comprehensive studies on the improvement of skin health through the regulation of the intestinal condition in humans. In this study, we investigated the benefits of Lactobacillus plantarum HY7714 (HY7714) consumption on skin health through its modulatory effects on the intestine and ensuing immune responses. HY7714 consumption led to differences in bacterial abundances from phylum to genus level, including increases in Actinobacteria followed by Bifidobacterium and a decrease in Proteobacteria. Additionally, HY7714 significantly ameliorated inflammation by reducing matrix metallopeptidases (MMP-2 and MMP-9), zonulin, and calprotectin in plasma, all of which are related to skin and intestinal permeability. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis revealed its efficacy at restoring the integrity of the gut barrier by regulating gene expression associated with the extracellular matrix and immunity. This was evident by the upregulation of IGFBP5, SERPINE1, EFEMP1, COL6A3, and SEMA3B and downregulation of MT2A, MT1E, MT1X, MT1G, and MT1F between TNF- α and TNF- α plus HY7714 treated Caco-2 cells. These results propose the potential mechanistic role of HY7714 on skin health by the regulation of the gut condition."
https://openalex.org/W3016160669,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the tumor microenvironment facilitate intercellular communication. Cancer cell-derived EVs act as an immunosuppressor by transporting cargos and presenting transmembrane proteins. By contrast, CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) exert anti-cancer cytotoxicity via the pore-forming protein perforin. Here, we hypothesize that although EVs are destroyed by perforin, cancer cell-derived EVs might possess mechanisms that enable them to avoid this destruction. We used a breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H2LN (D3H2LN), to generate EVs. Destruction of the EVs by perforin was demonstrated visually using atomic force microscopy. To investigate immunosuppressive metabolites within cancer cell-derived EVs, we performed metabolomic profiling of EVs from D3H2LN cells cultured for 48 h with or without IFN-γ, which induces metabolic changes in the cells. We found that both types of EV from IFN-γ treated D3H2LN cells and non-treated D3H2LN cells contained adenosine, which has immunosuppressive effects. When we exposed cancer cell-derived EVs to CTLs, perforin secretion by CTLs fell significantly. In addition, the decreases in perforin secretion were ameliorated by treatment with adenosine deaminase, which degrades extracellular adenosine. Taken together, these results suggest that after perforin secreted by CTLs disrupts the membrane of EVs, adenosine released from the EVs acts as an immunosuppressive metabolite by binding to the adenosine receptor on the CTL membrane. This mechanism provides a novel survival strategy using cancer cell-derived EVs."
https://openalex.org/W3016083036,"Mutations in ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 (GDAP1) alter mitochondrial morphology and result in several subtypes of the inherited peripheral neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease; however, the mechanism by which GDAP1 functions has remained elusive. GDAP1 contains primary sequence homology to the GST superfamily; however, the question of whether GDAP1 is an active GST has not been clearly resolved. Here, we present biochemical evidence, suggesting that GDAP1 has lost the ability to bind glutathione without a loss of substrate binding activity. We have revealed that the α-loop, located within the H-site motif is the primary determinant for substrate binding. Using structural data of GDAP1, we have found that critical residues and configurations in the G-site which canonically interact with glutathione are altered in GDAP1, rendering it incapable of binding glutathione. Last, we have found that the overexpression of GDAP1 in HeLa cells results in a mitochondrial phenotype which is distinct from oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial fragmentation. This phenotype is dependent on the presence of the transmembrane domain, as well as a unique hydrophobic domain that is not found in canonical GSTs. Together, we data point toward a non-enzymatic role for GDAP1, such as a sensor or receptor."
https://openalex.org/W3015591006,"One of the main objectives of Physical Education in elementary schools is to encourage motivation so that the subject enhances academic performance and the practice of physical exercise. Didactic research should evaluate the effectiveness of educational methods to know if they are applicable, useful, and in what sense. Exergames are digital motor games that aim to stimulate players' motor skills. Gamification refers to the use of game-based elements in nongame contexts to motivate actions. This research evaluates a gamified exergaming intervention, designed to improve children's academic performance by focusing on understanding applicability and usefulness. A natural experiment was set up in schools according to a mixed methods design. The qualitative data herein reported were collected during a natural experiment with a nonrandomized controlled design. The qualitative research design was used with field notes, an open-questions questionnaire, individual semi-structured interviews and focus group interviews. Eight teachers and 417 students took part. A content analysis was chosen as the methodological orientation. The facilitators were the realism of their didactic design and their adaptability to different educational contexts. The main barriers were the required materials and facilities. Teachers and students' attitudes were very positive, although future use was inconclusive. These findings may imply that this study is one of the few to provide positive evidence for educational gamification. The ""Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics"" gamification model and the ""Just Dance Now"" exergame may be applicable and useful for didactics in Physical Education, but all the participants' suggestions need to be considered to improve teaching interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3015953001,"Securing economically and ecologically significant molluscs, as our oceans warm due to climate change, is a global priority. South eastern Australia receives warm water in a strengthening East Australia Current and so resident species are vulnerable to elevated temperature and marine heat waves. This study tested whether prior exposure to elevated temperature can enhance resilience of oysters to ocean warming. Two Australian species, the flat oyster, Ostrea angasi, and the Sydney rock oyster, Saccostrea glomerata, were obtained as adults and ""heat shocked"" by exposure to a dose of warm water in the laboratory. Oysters were then transferred to elevated seawater temperature conditions where the thermal outfall from power generation was used as a proxy to investigate the impacts of ocean warming. Shell growth, condition index, lipid content and survival of flat oysters and condition of Sydney rock oysters were all significantly reduced by elevated seawater temperature in the field. Flat oysters grew faster than Sydney rock oysters at ambient temperature, but their growth and survival was more sensitive to elevated temperature. ""Stress inoculation"" by heat shock did little to ameliorate the negative effects of increased temperature, although the survival of heat-shocked flat oysters was greater than non-heat shocked oysters. Further investigations are required to determine if early exposure to heat stress can enhance resilience of oysters to ocean warming."
https://openalex.org/W3015208372,"Objectives Previous research has studied the influence of physical fitness on academic achievement through executive functions. However, the nature of this relationship remains unclear. This study aimed to analyze how cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and executive functions are associated with academic achievement and to examine whether the relationship between CRF and academic achievement is mediated by executive functions in schoolchildren. Methods This was a cross-sectional study including 570 schoolchildren, aged 8 to 11 years, from Cuenca, Spain. Data were collected from September to October 2017. Sociodemographic variables, family socioeconomic status, pubertal status, academic achievement, CRF (20-meter shuttle run test) and executive functions (inhibition, cognitive flexibility and working memory, NIH Toolbox battery in Spanish, v 1.8; iPad Pro, Apple, Inc.) were measured. Results Overall, ANCOVA models controlling for age, gender and mother educational level showed higher scores in language and mathematics in children in higher categories of CRF, inhibition, cognitive flexibility and working memory than in children in lower categories. The effect sizes were moderate (p < 0.05, partial eta squared: from 0.05 to 0.12). Moreover, the mediation analysis showed that inhibition partially mediated the relationship between CRF and language (c’ = 0.058; IC = [0.005; 0.028]) and mathematics (c’ = 0.064; IC = [0.005; 0.030]) grades. Similarly, cognitive flexibility mediated CRF’s relationship with language (c’ = 0.059; IC = [0.003; 0.028]) and with mathematics (c’ = 0.066; IC = [0.003; 0.029]); however, a significant relationship remained. For working memory, mediation analysis showed no significant results (c′ = 0.92; IC = [-0.002;0.025] P > 0.05 in language; c′ = 0.103; IC = [-0.002;0.029] P > 0.05 in mathematics). Mediation ranged from 13.38% to 36%. Conclusions Children in higher categories of both CRF and executive function showed higher grades in mathematics and language. The findings indicated that a significant proportion of the positive influence of CRF on academic achievement was mediated by improvements in inhibition and cognitive flexibility. Thus, this study supports the hypothesis that improvements in CRF may contribute to increasing academic achievement not only through a direct mechanism but also through improvements in executive functions."
https://openalex.org/W3016095989,"The improved understanding of complex interactions of marine ecosystem components makes the use of fully coupled hydrodynamic, biogeochemical and individual based models more and more relevant. At the same time, the increasing complexity of the models and diverse user backgrounds calls for improved user friendliness and flexibility of the model systems. We present FlexSem, a versatile and user-friendly framework for 3D hydrodynamic, biogeochemical, individual based and sediment transport modelling. The purpose of the framework is to enable natural scientists to conduct advanced 3D simulations in the marine environment, including any relevant processes. This is made possible by providing a precompiled portable framework, which still enables the user to pick any combination of models and provide user defined equation systems to be solved during the simulation. We here present the ideas behind the framework design, the implementation and documentation of the numerical solution to the Navier-Stokes equations in the hydrodynamic module, the surface heat budget model, the pelagic and benthic equation solvers and the Lagrangian movement of the agents in the agent based model. Five examples of different applications of the system are shown: 1) Hydrodynamics in the Disko Bay in west Greenland, 2) A biogeochemical pelagic and benthic model in the inner Danish waters, 3) A generic mussel farm model featuring offline physics, food levels and mussel eco-physiology, 4) Sediment transport in Clarion-Clipperton zone at the bottom of the Pacific and 5) Hydrodynamics coupled with an agent based model around Zanzibar in Tanzania. Hence we demonstrate that the model can be set up for any area with enough forcing data and used to solve a wide range of applications."
https://openalex.org/W3016243196,"Two major proteolytic systems, the proteasome and the autophagy pathway, are key components of the proteostasis network. The immunoproteasome, a proteasome subtype, and autophagy are upregulated under stress conditions, forming a coordinated unit designed to minimize the effect of cell stress. We investigated how genetic ablation of the LMP2 immunoproteasome subunit affects autophagy in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) from WT and LMP2 knockout mice. We monitored autophagy regulation by measuring LC3, phosphorylation of AKT (S473), and phosphorylation of S6, a downstream readout of AKT (mTOR) pathway activation. We also evaluated transcription factor EB (TFEB) nuclear translocation, a transcription factor that controls expression of autophagy and lysosome genes. WT and LMP2 KO cells were monitored after treatment with EBSS to stimulate autophagy, insulin to stimulate AKT, or an AKT inhibitor (trehalose or MK-2206). Under basal conditions, we observed hyper-phosphorylation of AKT and S6, as well as lower nuclear-TFEB content in LMP2 KO RPE compared with WT. AKT inhibitors MK-2206 and trehalose significantly inhibited AKT phosphorylation and stimulated nuclear translocation of TFEB. Starvation and AKT inhibition upregulated autophagy, albeit to a lesser extent in LMP2 KO RPE. These data support the idea that AKT hyper-activation is an underlying cause of defective autophagy regulation in LMP2 KO RPE, revealing a unique link between two proteolytic systems and a previously unknown function in autophagy regulation by the immunoproteasome."
https://openalex.org/W3016084114,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become a prominent method of AI implementation in medical classification tasks. Grading Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) has been at the forefront of the development of AI for ophthalmology. However, major obstacles remain in the generalization of these CNNs onto real-world DR screening programs. We believe these difficulties are due to use of 1) small training datasets (<5,000 images), 2) private and 'curated' repositories, 3) locally implemented CNN implementation methods, while 4) relying on measured Area Under the Curve (AUC) as the sole measure of CNN performance. To address these issues, the public EyePACS Kaggle Diabetic Retinopathy dataset was uploaded onto Microsoft Azure™ cloud platform. Two CNNs were trained; 1 a ""Quality Assurance"", and 2. a ""Classifier"". The Diabetic Retinopathy classifier CNN (DRCNN) performance was then tested both on 'un-curated' as well as the 'curated' test set created by the ""Quality Assessment"" CNN model. Finally, the sensitivity of the DRCNNs was boosted using two post-training techniques. Our DRCNN proved to be robust, as its performance was similar on 'curated' and 'un-curated' test sets. The implementation of 'cascading thresholds' and 'max margin' techniques led to significant improvements in the DRCNN's sensitivity, while also enhancing the specificity of other grades."
https://openalex.org/W3016185486,"The role of central juxtaposed with another zinc finger gene 1 (JAZF1) in glucose regulation remains unclear. Here, we activated mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) JAZF1 in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed rats by an adenovirus expressing JAZF1 (Ad-JAZF1). We evaluated the changes in the hypothalamic insulin receptor (InsR)-PI3K-Akt-AMPK pathway and hepatic glucose production (HGP). To investigate the impact of MBH Ad-JAZF1 on HGP, we activated MBH JAZF1 in the presence or absence of ATP-dependent potassium (KATP ) channel inhibition, hepatic branch vagotomy (HVG), or an AMPK activator (AICAR). In HFD-fed rats, MBH Ad-JAZF1 decreased body weight and food intake, and inhibited HGP by increasing hepatic insulin signaling. Under insulin stimulation, MBH Ad-JAZF1 increased InsR and Akt phosphorylation, and phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5-trisphosphate (PIP3) formation; however, AMPK phosphorylation was decreased in the hypothalamus. The positive effect of MBH JAZF1 on hepatic insulin signaling and HGP was prevented by treatment with a KATP channel inhibitor or HVG. The metabolic impact of hypothalamic JAZF1 was also blocked by MBH AICAR. Ad-JAZF1 treatment in SH-SY5Y cells resulted in an elevation of InsR and Akt phosphorylation following insulin stimulation. Our findings show that hypothalamic JAZF1 regulates HGP via the InsR-PI3K-Akt-AMPK pathway and KATP channels."
https://openalex.org/W3016204139,"Objectives High-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) fragment enhances bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC) recruitment to damaged tissue to promote tissue regeneration. This study aimed to evaluate whether systemic injection of HMGB1 fragment could promote tissue repair in a rat model of myocardial infarction (MI). Methods HMGB1 (n = 14) or phosphate buffered saline (n = 12, control) was administered to MI rats for 4 days. Cardiac performance and left ventricular remodeling were evaluated using ultrasonography and immunostaining. BM-MSC recruitment to damaged tissue in green fluorescent protein-bone marrow transplantation (GFP-BMT) models was evaluated using immunostaining. Results At four weeks post-treatment, the left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly improved in the HMGB1 group compared to that in the control. Interstitial fibrosis and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy were also significantly attenuated in the HMGB1 group compared to the control. In the peri-infarction area, VEGF-A mRNA expression was significantly higher and TGFβ expression was significantly attenuated in the HMGB1 group than in the control. In GFP-BMT rats, GFP+/PDGFRα+ cells were significantly mobilized to the peri-infarction area in the HMGB1 group compared to that in the control, leading to the formation of new vasculature. In addition, intravital imaging revealed that more GFP+/PDGFRα+ cells were recruited to the peri-infarction area in the HMGB1 group than in the control 12 h after treatment. Conclusions Systemic administration of HMGB1 induced angiogenesis and reduced fibrosis by recruiting PDGFRα+ mesenchymal cells from the bone marrow, suggesting that HMGB1 administration might be a new therapeutic approach for heart failure after MI."
https://openalex.org/W3015572072,"Increasingly, studies are revealing that endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can alter animal behavior. Early life exposure to EDCs may permanently alter phenotypes through to adulthood. In addition, the effects of EDCs may not be isolated to a single generation − offspring may indirectly be impacted, via non-genetic processes. Here, we analyzed the effects of paternal atrazine exposure on behavioral traits (distance moved, exploration, bottom-dwelling time, latency to enter the top zone, and interaction with a mirror) and whole-brain mRNA of genes involved in the serotonergic system regulation (slc6a4a, slc6a4b, htr1Aa, htr1B, htr2B) of zebrafish (Danio rerio). F0 male zebraFIsh were exposed to atrazine at 0.3, 3 or 30 part per billion (ppb) during early juvenile development, the behavior of F1 progeny was tested at adulthood, and the effect of 0.3 ppb atrazine treatment on mRNA transcription was quantified. Paternal exposure to atrazine significantly reduced interactions with a mirror (a proxy for aggression) and altered the latency to enter the top zone of a tank in unexposed F1 offspring. Bottom-dwelling time (a proxy for anxiety) also appeared to be somewhat affected, and activity (distance moved) was reduced in the context of aggression. slc6a4a and htr1Aa mRNA transcript levels were found to correlate positively with anxiety levels in controls, but we found that this relationship was disrupted in the 0.3 ppb atrazine treatment group. Overall, paternal atrazine exposure resulted in alterations across a variety of behavioral traits and showed signs of serotonergic system dysregulation, demonstrating intergenerational effects. Further research is needed to explore transgenerational effects on behavior and possible mechanisms underpinning behavioral effects."
https://openalex.org/W3015888402,"Food insecurity is an important and persistent social issue in Bangladesh. Existing data based on socio-economic surveys produce divisional and nationally representative food insecurity estimates but these surveys cannot be used directly to generate reliable district level estimates. We deliberate small area estimation (SAE) approach for estimating the food insecurity status at district level in Bangladesh by combining Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2010 with the Bangladesh Population and Housing Census 2011. The food insecurity prevalence, gap and severity status have been determined based on per capita calorie intake with a threshold of 2122 kcal per day, as specified by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics.The results show that the food insecurity estimates generated from SAE are precise and representative of the spatial heterogeneity in the socioeconomic conditions than do the direct estimates. The maps showing the food insecurity indicators by district indicate that a number of districts in northern and southern parts are more vulnerable in terms of all indicators. These maps will guide the government, international organizations, policymakers and development partners for efficient resource allocation."

https://openalex.org/W3016067938,"The traditional full-scan method is commonly used for identifying critical links in road networks. This method simulates each link to be closed iteratively and measures its impact on the efficiency of the whole network. It can accurately identify critical links. However, in this method, traffic assignments are conducted under all scenarios of link disruption, making this process prohibitively time-consuming for large-scale road networks. This paper proposes an approach considering the traffic flow betweenness index (TFBI) to identify critical links, which can significantly reduce the computational burden compared with the traditional full-scan method. The TFBI consists of two parts: traffic flow betweenness and endpoint origin–destination (OD) demand (rerouted travel demand). There is a weight coefficient between these two parts. Traffic flow betweenness is established by considering the shortest travel-time path betweenness, link traffic flow and total OD demand. The proposed approach consists of the following main steps. First, a sample road network is selected to calibrate the weight coefficient between traffic flow betweenness and endpoint OD demand in the TFBI using the network robustness index. This index calculates changes in the whole-system travel time due to each link’s closure under the traditional full-scan method. Then, candidate critical links are pre-selected according to the TFBI value of each link. Finally, a given number of real critical links are identified from the candidate critical links using the traditional full-scan method. The applicability and computational efficiency of the TFBI-based approach are demonstrated for the road network in Changchun, China."
https://openalex.org/W3015451236,"Small extracellular vesicles (sEV) are nano-sized (40–150 nm), membrane-encapsulated vesicles that are released by essentially all cells into the extracellular space and function as intercellular signaling vectors through the horizontal transfer of biologic molecules, including microRNA (miRNA) and other small non-coding RNA (ncRNA), that can alter the phenotype of recipient cells. sEV are present in essentially all extracellular biofluids, including serum, urine and saliva, and offer a new avenue for discovery and development of novel biomarkers of various disease states and exposures. The objective of this study was to systematically interrogate similarities and differences between sEV ncRNA derived from saliva, serum and urine, as well as cell-free small ncRNA (cf-ncRNA) from serum. Saliva, urine and serum were concomitantly collected from 4 healthy donors to mitigate potential bias that can stem from interpersonal and temporal variability. sEV were isolated from each respective biofluid, along with cf-RNA from serum. sEV were isolated from the respective biofluids via differential ultracentrifugation with a 30% sucrose cushion to minimize protein contamination. Small RNA-sequencing was performed on each sample, and cluster analysis was performed based on ncRNA profiles. While some similarities existed in terms of sEV ncRNA cargo across biofluids, there are also notable differences in ncRNA class and ncRNA secretion, with sEV in each biofluid bearing a unique ncRNA profile, including major differences in composition by ncRNA class. We conclude that sEV ncRNA cargo varies according to biofluid, so thus should be carefully selected and interpreted when designing or contrasting translational or epidemiological studies."
https://openalex.org/W3015715818,"Safety assessment of genetically modified (GM) crops is crucial at the product-development phase before GM crops are placed on the market. Determining characteristics of sequences flanking exogenous insertion sequences is essential for the safety assessment and marketing of transgenic crops. In this study, we used genome walking and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to identify the flanking sequence characteristics of the SbSNAC1 transgenic drought-tolerant maize line “SbSNAC1-382”, but both of the two methods failed. Then, we constructed a genomic fosmid library of the transgenic maize line, which contained 4.18×105 clones with an average insertion fragment of 35 kb, covering 5.85 times the maize genome. Subsequently, three positive clones were screened by pairs of specific primers, and one of the three positive clones was sequenced by using single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology. More than 1.95 Gb sequence data (~105× coverage) for the sequenced clone were generated. The junction reads mapped to the boundaries of T-DNA, and the flanking sequences in the transgenic line were identified by comparing all sequencing reads with the maize reference genome and the sequence of the transgenic vector. Furthermore, the putative insertion loci and flanking sequences were confirmed by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing. The results indicated that two copies of the exogenous T-DNA fragments were inserted at the same genomic site, and the exogenous T-DNA fragments were integrated at the position of Chromosome 5 from 177155650 to 177155696 in the transgenic line 382. In this study, we demonstrated the successful application of the SMRT technology for the characterization of genomic insertion and flanking sequences."
https://openalex.org/W3016229703,"Background Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a peer-referral sampling methodology used to estimate characteristics of underserved groups that cannot be randomly sampled. RDS has been implemented in several settings to identify hidden populations at risk for HIV, but few studies have reported the methodological lessons learned on RDS design and implementation for assessing sexual risk behaviors in marginalized youth. Methods We used RDS to recruit N = 350 young adults, aged 18 to 22, who were living in urban slum settlements in Nairobi, Kenya. A structured survey was used to assess sexual risk behaviors. Twenty seeds were selected and asked to recruit up to three eligible peers. We used small monetary incentives and a three-day recruitment coupon with sequential numbers linking recruiters to their recruits. Results Data collection was completed in 8 days with a maximum chain length of 6 waves. Each seed yielded 16 to 21 eligible recruits. Three (15%) seeds were unproductive and were replaced. RDS benefits were high identification rates (90% coupons returned per coupons given), high eligibility rates (100% eligible recruits per coupons returned), and high efficiency (~39 eligible recruits per day). 44% of the sample was female. Most recruits (74%) reported being “friends” for 7+ years with their recruiter. RDS overcame feasibility concerns of household-, clinic-, and school-based sampling methodologies in that underserved youth who were unemployed (68%), out of school (48%), ethnic minorities (26%), and having prior residential instability (≥2 moves in the past year) (20%) were successfully recruited, based on weighted analyses. Youth reporting HIV risk behaviors, including unprotected sex (38%), sex while high/drunk (35%), and sex exchange for pay (14%), were also enrolled. However, 28% were not sexually active within the last 6 months. Challenges included managing wait times during peaks and participant referral expectations. Community engagement, use of study-stamped coupons, broad inclusion criteria, incentives, and study sites within walking distances all contributed to the successful implementation of the sampling methodology. Conclusion RDS is an important tool in reaching a diverse sample of underserved and at-risk young adults for study participation. Implications for optimizing RDS for behavioral studies in this population are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3015251765,"Adipocytes are key players in maintaining energy homeostasis and are classified into two different categories: white and brown adipocytes. While white adipocytes store energy as triacylglycerols in lipid droplets, brown adipocytes combust excess chemical energy and release in the form of heat through uncoupled respiration. This characteristic phenomenon of brown fat attracts researchers and pharmacological industries to view brown fat as one of the potential therapeutic targets for obesity and associated metabolic disease. In the current study, we investigated the effect of a small molecule, sesaminol (SML) on brown fat activity and found that SML induces the thermogenic program in primary white adipocytes as well as chow diet fed mice. In particular, SML treatment to mice elevated mitochondrial complex proteins and the rate of oxygen consumption in brown and white fat. Administration of SML to high fat diet (HFD) challenged mice decreased weight gain, adiposity and cholesterol levels along with an increase of brown fat gene program in brown and white fat. Mechanistically, SML repressed the myogenic gene program in C2C12 myoblasts and increased all mitochondrial marker genes as appeared in brown adipose cells. Together, our results demonstrate that SML stimulates brown adipose function and protects mice against diet-induced weight gain."
https://openalex.org/W3015265483,"Purpose To accelerate the acquisition of free-breathing 3D saturation-recovery-based (SASHA) myocardial T1 mapping by acquiring fewer saturation points in combination with a post-processing 3D denoising technique to maintain high accuracy and precision. Methods 3D SASHA T1 mapping acquires nine T1-weighted images along the saturation recovery curve, resulting in long acquisition times. In this work, we propose to accelerate conventional cardiac T1 mapping by reducing the number of saturation points. High T1 accuracy and low standard deviation (as a surrogate for precision) is maintained by applying a 3D denoising technique to the T1-weighted images prior to pixel-wise T1 fitting. The proposed approach was evaluated on a T1 phantom and 20 healthy subjects, by varying the number of T1-weighted images acquired between three and nine, both prospectively and retrospectively. Following the results from the healthy subjects, three patients with suspected cardiovascular disease were acquired using five T1-weighted images. T1 accuracy and precision was determined for all the acquisitions before and after denoising. Results In the T1 phantom, no statistical difference was found in terms of accuracy and precision for the different number of T1-weighted images before or after denoising (P = 0.99 and P = 0.99 for accuracy, P = 0.64 and P = 0.42 for precision, respectively). In vivo, both prospectively and retrospectively, the precision improved considerably with the number of T1-weighted images employed before denoising (P<0.05) but was independent on the number of T1-weighted images after denoising. Conclusion We demonstrate the feasibility of accelerating 3D SASHA T1 mapping by reducing the number of acquired T1-weighted images in combination with an efficient 3D denoising, without affecting accuracy and precision of T1 values."

https://openalex.org/W3015523978,"Single-cell expression analysis is an effective tool for studying the dynamics of cell population profiles. However, the majority of statistical methods are applied to individual profiles and the methods for comparing multiple profiles simultaneously are limited. In this study, we propose a nonparametric statistical method, called Decomposition into Extended Exponential Family (DEEF), that embeds a set of single-cell expression profiles of several markers into a low-dimensional space and identifies the principal distributions that describe their heterogeneity. We demonstrate that DEEF can appropriately decompose and embed sets of theoretical probability distributions. We then apply DEEF to a cytometry dataset to examine the effects of epidermal growth factor stimulation on an adult human mammary gland. It is shown that DEEF can describe the complex dynamics of cell population profiles using two parameters and visualize them as a trajectory. The two parameters identified the principal patterns of the cell population profile without prior biological assumptions. As a further application, we perform a dimensionality reduction and a time series reconstruction. DEEF can reconstruct the distributions based on the top coordinates, which enables the creation of an artificial dataset based on an actual single-cell expression dataset. Using the coordinate system assigned by DEEF, it is possible to analyze the relationship between the attributes of the distribution sample and the features or shape of the distribution using conventional data mining methods."
https://openalex.org/W3015947323,"A high prevalence of intermediate cardiometabolic risk factors and obesity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has suggested the existence of pathophysiological links between hypertriglyceridemia, insulin resistance, visceral adiposity, and hypoxia or impaired pulmonary function. However, whether COPD contributes independently to the development of these cardiometabolic risk factors remains unclear. Our objective was to compare ectopic fat and metabolic profiles among representative individuals with COPD and control subjects and to evaluate whether the presence of COPD alters the metabolic risk profile. Study participants were randomly selected from the general population and prospectively classified as non-COPD controls and COPD, according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease classification. The metabolic phenotype, which consisted of visceral adipose tissue area, metabolic markers including homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and blood lipid profile, was obtained in 144 subjects with COPD and 119 non-COPD controls. The metabolic phenotype was similar in COPD and controls. The odds ratios for having pathologic values for HOMA-IR, lipids and visceral adipose tissue area were similar in individuals with COPD and control subjects in multivariate analyses that took into account age, sex, body mass index, tobacco status and current medications. In a population-based cohort, no difference was found in the metabolic phenotype, including visceral adipose tissue accumulation, between COPD and controls. Discrepancies between the present and previous studies as to whether or not COPD is a risk factor for metabolic abnormalities could be related to differences in COPD phenotype or disease severity of the study populations."

In total, 4,710,650, 4,787,750, 4,646,026, and 4,590,616 SNPs and 1,481,002, 1,534,198, 1,471,304, and 1,425,393 InDels were detected in the 'Ruby-3', 'Yongfeng male', 'Kuilv male', and 'Hongbei male' genomes, respectively, compared with the reference genome sequence of cv 'Hongyang'. A subset of 120 InDels were selected for re-sequencing validation. Additionally, genes related to non-synonymous SNPs and InDels in coding domain sequences were screened for functional analysis. The analysis of GO and KEGG showed that genes involved in cellular responses to water deprivation, sucrose transport, decreased oxygen levels and plant hormone signal transduction were significantly enriched in A. arguta. The results of this study provide insight into the genomic variation of kiwifruit and can inform future research on molecular breeding to improve cold resistance in kiwifruit."
https://openalex.org/W3016261639,"Purpose Patient-reported long-term follow-up after endovascular treatment of indirect carotid cavernous fistulas is important, but rarely addressed in literature. We report on this issue with a special focus on the patient’s view and its impact on the indication evaluation process. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients (n = 33) with a minimum follow-up interval of at least 36 and up to 166 months after endovascular treatment of an indirect carotid cavernous fistula (Barrow B-D) at our institution (treated from 01/2003 to 06/2015). We determined treatment details including primary therapy success and complication rate and quote the patient’s subjective perception of the long-term treatment success using a standardized interview form. Results As a primary result the fistula was completely occluded in 25/33 cases (76%), while a downgrading was achieved in 8/33 (24%) of the cases. Secondary occlusion was observed in three out of eight patients (38%). In the long-term interview (response rate: 91%, median follow-up interval: 114 months) 87% of the patients reported high satisfaction with the long-term therapy result. Endovascular treatment achieved a sustainable relief from all eye-related symptoms in 89% and from pulsatile tinnitus in 57% of the cases. Conclusions In addition to good results in terms of angiographic and clinical cure, endovascular treatment is also perceived as beneficial by most of the patients. This is another important argument in favor of an endovascular treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3015353534,"Semantic context modulates precision and speed of language production. Using different experimental designs including the Picture-Word-Interference (PWI) paradigm, it has consistently been shown that categorically related distractor words (e.g., cat) inhibit retrieval of the target picture name (dog). Here we introduce a novel variant of the PWI paradigm in which we present 8 words prior to a to be named target picture. Within this set, the number of words categorically related was varied between 3 and 5, and the picture to be named was either related or unrelated to the respective category. To disentangle interacting effects of semantic context we combined different naming paradigms manipulating the number of competitors and assessing the effect of repeated naming instances. Evaluating processing of the cohort by eye-tracking provided us with a metric of the (implicit) recognition of the semantic cohort. Results replicate the interference effect in that overall naming of pictures categorically related to the distractor set was slower compared to unrelated pictures. However, interference did not increase with increasing number of distractors. Tracking this effect across naming repetitions, we found that interference is prominent at the first naming instance of every picture only, whereby it is stable across distractor conditions, but dissipates across the experiment. Regarding eye-tracking our data show that participants fixated longer on semantically related items, indicating the identification of the lexico-semantic cohort. Our findings confirm the validity of the novel paradigm and indicate that besides interference during first exposure, repeated exposure to the semantic context may facilitate picture naming and counteract lexical interference."
https://openalex.org/W3015467809,"Human neutrophils have a vital role in host defense and inflammatory responses in innate immune systems. Growing evidence shows that the overproduction of reactive oxygen species and granular proteolytic enzymes from activated neutrophils is linked to the pathogenesis of acute inflammatory diseases. However, adequate therapeutic targets are still lacking to regulate neutrophil functions. Herein, we report that MVBR-28, synthesized from the Mannich bases of heterocyclic chalcone, has anti-neutrophilic inflammatory effects through regulation of intracellular pH. MVBR-28 modulates neutrophil functions by attenuating respiratory burst, degranulation, and migration. Conversely, MVBR-28 has no antioxidant effects and fails to alter elastase activity in cell-free systems. The anti-inflammatory effects of MVBR-28 are not seen through cAMP pathways. Significantly, MVBR-28 potently inhibits extracellular Ca2+ influx in N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLF)- and thapsigargin-activated human neutrophils. Notably, MVBR-28 attenuates fMLF-induced intracellular alkalization in a K+-dependent manner, which is upstream of Ca2+ pathways. Collectively, these findings provide new insight into Mannich bases of heterocyclic chalcone regarding the regulation of neutrophil functions and the potential for the development of MVBR-28 as a lead compound for treating neutrophilic inflammatory diseases."

We tested the hypothesis that IMT would maintain and/or improve inspiratory muscle strength variables measured in Thoroughbreds during detraining. Thoroughbreds from one training yard were placed into a control (Con, n = 3 males n = 7 females; median age 2.2±0.4 years) or treatment group (Tr, n = 5 males, n = 5 females; median age 2.1±0.3 years) as they entered a detraining period at the end of the racing/training season. The Tr group underwent eight weeks of IMT twice a day, five days per week using custom-made training masks with resistance valves and an incremental threshold of breath-loading protocol. An inspiratory muscle strength test to fatigue using an incremental threshold of breath-loading was performed in duplicate before (T0) and after four (T1) and eight weeks (T2) of IMT/no IMT using a custom-made testing mask and a commercial testing device. Inspiratory measurements included the total number of breaths achieved during the test, average load, peak power, peak volume, peak flow, energy and the mean peak inspiratory muscle strength index (IMSi). Data were analysed using a linear mixed effects model, P≤0.05 significant. There were no differences for inspiratory measurements between groups at T0. Compared to T0, the total number of breaths achieved (P = 0.02), load (P = 0.003) and IMSi (P = 0.01) at T2 had decreased for the Con group while the total number of breaths achieved (P<0.001), load (P = 0.03), volume (P = 0.004), flow (P = 0.006), energy (P = 0.01) and IMSi (P = 0.002) had increased for the Tr group. At T2 the total number of breaths achieved (P<0.0001), load (P<0.0001), volume (P = 0.02), energy (P = 0.03) and IMSi (P<0.0001) were greater for the Tr than Con group. In conclusion, our results support that IMT can maintain and/or increase aspects of inspiratory muscle strength for horses in a detraining programme."

Ammon these, the most frequent substitutions were Q80R (13.69%, 23/168) followed by V36L (18.33%, 14/168) and V55I (5.95%, 10/168). Among HCV-3b patients, 26.98% were found with RAPs and S122R and Q80R were the dominant variants detected in 17.46 (11/63) and 12.70% (8/63) patients respectively. All these substitutions were associated with Boceprevir, Simeprevir, Telaprevir, and Paritaprevir. Single substitution in one sequence was found in 18.77% (52/277) and multiple in 10.46% (29/277). More than one RAP was frequent in HCV-3a sequences. Natural RAPs are common in chronic HCV patients infected with genotype 1a, 3a and 3b, the most prevalent subtypes in Pakistan. High prevalence of HCV NS3 RAPs suggested a large scale study of the NS3 gene before the introduction of NS3 protease inhibitors in Pakistan."

The processes by which the ordering of these various things is stored and recalled are moderately well understood. We use here a computational model of a cortex-like recurrent neural network adapted by a multitude of plasticity mechanisms. We first demonstrate the learning of a sequence. Then, we examine the influence of different types of distractors on the network dynamics during the recall of the encoded ordered information being ordered in a sequence. We are able to broadly arrive at two distinct effect-categories for distractors, arrive at a basic understanding of why this is so, and predict what distractors will fall into each category."

Nevertheless, there are still patients where the primary tumor cannot be located. In these situations, the standard of care is comprehensive head and neck radiation therapy however it is unclear whether this is necessary. This study examines the effects of radiation treatment volume on outcomes among using data from two cancer centers in unknown primary carcinoma of the head and neck.Patients received unilateral (n = 34), or bilateral radiation (n = 28). Patient factors such as age, gender, smoking history, and patterns of failure were compared using Mann Whitney U and Chi Square. Overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) trends were estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Effect of treatment volume on survival was examined using multivariate cox proportional hazard regression model.No significant differences were observed in the frequency of local (p = 0.32), regional (p = 0.50), or distant (p = 0.76) failures between unilateral and bilateral radiation therapy. By Kaplan-Meier estimates, OS (3-year OS bilateral = 71.67%, unilateral = 77.90%, p = 0.50) and DFS (3-year DFS bilateral = 77.92%, unilateral = 69.43%, p = 0.63) were similar between the two treatment approaches. Lastly, multivariate analysis did not demonstrate any significant differences in outcome by treatment volumes (OS: HR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.31, 1.81, p = 0.51; DFS: HR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.24, 1.93, p = 0.47).Unilateral radiation therapy compared with bilateral produced similar survival."
https://openalex.org/W3015625142,"Heart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome where diagnostic certainty varies. The prognosis of individuals with some clinical features of HF, but without the fully overt syndrome, is unclear. Therefore, we sought to evaluate their natural history.Between 1990 and 2009, all suspected HF cases in the Framingham Heart Study were adjudicated into 3 groups reflecting varying diagnostic certainty: definite (meeting HF diagnostic criteria; n = 479), possible (meeting HF criteria but with an alternative explanation for findings; n = 135), and probable (insufficient criteria for definite HF; n = 121) HF. Age-and-sex-matched individuals (n = 1112) without HF or cardiovascular disease (CVD) were controls. Using multivariable-adjusted Cox regression, we compared the possible/probable HF groups with controls regarding risk of incident definite HF, coronary heart disease (CHD), other CVD or death; and with definite HF regarding risk of latter three outcomes. During follow-up (mean 8.6 years), ~90% of individuals with possible, probable and definite HF experienced CVD events or died. Compared with controls, those with possible or probable HF experienced higher hazards for definite HF, CHD, other CVD and death (hazards ratios [HR] 1.35-9.31; p<0.05). The possible/probable groups did not differ from the definite HF group for risk of any outcome. Compared with the possible HF group, the probable HF group had a higher propensity for definite HF (HR 1.64, with a higher proportion of ischemic HF) but lower risk of death (HR 0.69).Individuals meeting partial criteria for HF are at a substantial risk for progression to HF, CVD, and mortality."
