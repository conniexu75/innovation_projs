https://openalex.org/W1669479280,"The contribution of cell generation to physiological heart growth and maintenance in humans has been difficult to establish and has remained controversial. We report that the full complement of cardiomyocytes is established perinataly and remains stable over the human lifespan, whereas the numbers of both endothelial and mesenchymal cells increase substantially from birth to early adulthood. Analysis of the integration of nuclear bomb test-derived (14)C revealed a high turnover rate of endothelial cells throughout life (>15% per year) and more limited renewal of mesenchymal cells (<4% per year in adulthood). Cardiomyocyte exchange is highest in early childhood and decreases gradually throughout life to <1% per year in adulthood, with similar turnover rates in the major subdivisions of the myocardium. We provide an integrated model of cell generation and turnover in the human heart."
https://openalex.org/W1561349380,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are required to initiate and sustain T cell-dependent anti-cancer immunity. However, tumors often evade immune control by crippling normal DC function. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response factor XBP1 promotes intrinsic tumor growth directly, but whether it also regulates the host anti-tumor immune response is not known. Here we show that constitutive activation of XBP1 in tumor-associated DCs (tDCs) drives ovarian cancer (OvCa) progression by blunting anti-tumor immunity. XBP1 activation, fueled by lipid peroxidation byproducts, induced a triglyceride biosynthetic program in tDCs leading to abnormal lipid accumulation and subsequent inhibition of tDC capacity to support anti-tumor T cells. Accordingly, DC-specific XBP1 deletion or selective nanoparticle-mediated XBP1 silencing in tDCs restored their immunostimulatory activity in situ and extended survival by evoking protective type 1 anti-tumor responses. Targeting the ER stress response should concomitantly inhibit tumor growth and enhance anti-cancer immunity, thus offering a unique approach to cancer immunotherapy."

The cortical subthreshold membrane potential and synaptic dynamics underlying optimal sensory signal detection are not well known. Human and animal studies have reported that performance on signal detection tasks is highly state-dependent, exhibiting an inverted-U dependence on arousal and the activity of neuromodulatory pathways. This relationship, known as the Yerkes-Dodson curve, predicts that optimal performance occurs at intermediate levels of arousal (Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005Aston-Jones G. Cohen J.D.

But what are the synaptic and circuit mechanisms of this inverted-U dependence of optimal states for behavior and neural responses? Reports on the cortical membrane potential dynamics associated with wakeful states have come to widely differing conclusion between species and sensory systems. Wakefulness is traditionally associated with low amplitude and arrhythmic scalp EEG. This canonical wakeful state has been referred to as the “activated” or “asynchronous” state, because excitatory neurons are thought to be tonically depolarized while interacting in a manner that reduces broad-ranging synchrony (Renart et al., 2010Renart A. de la Rocha J.

Membrane potential recordings in awake cats support this view (Steriade et al., 2001Steriade M. Timofeev I. Grenier F. Natural waking and sleep states: a view from inside neocortical neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 85: 1969-1985PubMed Google Scholar), but recent work in rodent sensory cortical areas has revealed additional complexity. Membrane potentials in auditory cortex of rats have been found to be hyperpolarized and inactive across un-anesthetized states, though the arousal level of the animals was not quantified (Hromádka et al., 2008Hromádka T.

Movement (walking or whisking) in mice is associated with cortical membrane potential dynamics akin to the “asynchronous” state in somatosensory, visual, and auditory cortical areas (Bennett et al., 2013Bennett C.

One possible explanation of these apparently divergent results is that state (arousal) fluctuates continuously and rapidly, resulting in a high degree of variability between studies and between moments within individual studies, which has not been accounted for. The diameter of the pupil and the occurrence of sharp-wave activity in the hippocampus are two well-established measures of arousal (Bradley et al., 2008Bradley M.M. Miccoli L. Escrig M.A. Lang P.J.

Arousal and locomotion make distinct contributions to cortical activity patterns and visual encoding.Neuron. 2015; 86: 740-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Indeed, in rodents, measures of the pupil diameter have been used for binary classification of “aroused” or “unaroused” states and predict differences in sensory response magnitude and reliability and the extent of slow fluctuations in visual cortical membrane potential (Reimer et al., 2014Reimer J. Froudarakis E. Cadwell C.R. Yatsenko D. Denfield G.H. Tolias A.S. Pupil fluctuations track fast switching of cortical states during quiet wakefulness.Neuron. 2014; 84: 355-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). We wondered if pupil diameter and hippocampal sharp-wave activity could be used to derive a continuous measure of arousal level, allowing study of the membrane potential dynamics associated with the inverted-U shaped dependence of signal detection task performance on arousal. Here we report that the mouse’s internal state fluctuates continuously and rapidly (in seconds or less), and arousal can be quantified simply as the diameter of the pupil. We find that pupil diameter closely tracks the rate of occurrence of hippocampal sharp waves. In addition, auditory cortical membrane potentials of layer 4 and 5 excitatory neurons exhibit: slowly fluctuating (1–10 Hz) rhythmic activity with low arousal, hyperpolarization and low variability at intermediate arousal, depolarization and variability with sustained hyper-arousal (with or without walking), and transient depolarization in synchrony with micro-arousal events. These results provide a framework with which to resolve apparent discrepancies between species and sensory systems in cortical membrane potential dynamics and reveal the membrane potential signature of optimal performance in a signal detection task. Substantial portions of this work have been presented previously in abstract form (McGinley et al., 2013McGinley, M.J., David, S.V., and McCormick, D.A. (2013). Modulation of spontaneous and sensory-evoked synaptic dynamics in A1 during auditory discrimination tasks in mice. In Society for Neuroscience annual meeting.Google Scholar, McGinley et al., 2014McGinley, M.J., David, S.V., and McCormick, D.A. (2014). Predicting cortical response variability in awake-behaving mice: the role of arousal, behavioral performance, and auditory stimuli. Association for Research in Otolaryngology abstracts.Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the arousal state of waking mice exhibits rapid moment-to-moment variations that impact behavior and cortical activity. We further hypothesized that there is an “optimal” state in which the behavioral performance of the animal on a task would peak and sensory responses would be large and reliable. Finally, we sought to determine the dynamic signature of membrane potential activity in the optimal sensory signal detection state. To this end, we trained mice in a challenging auditory tone-in-noise detection task and quantified the state of the mice in several conditions: (1) in the absence of sound exposure, (2) during passive listening to task stimuli (temporally orthogonal ripple combinations [TORCs]) (Atiani et al., 2009Atiani S. Elhilali M. David S.V. Fritz J.B. Shamma S.A. Task difficulty and performance induce diverse adaptive patterns in gain and shape of primary auditory cortical receptive fields.Neuron. 2009; 61: 467-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar)), or (3) during the performance of an auditory task detecting tones embedded in these TORCs (see Experimental Procedures). To quantify state, we used pupillometry, rate of occurrence of sharp wave/ripple combinations and theta activity (θ/δ ratio; see Csicsvari et al., 1999Csicsvari J. Hirase H. Czurkó A. Mamiya A. Buzsáki G. Oscillatory coupling of hippocampal pyramidal cells and interneurons in the behaving Rat.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 274-287PubMed Google Scholar) in the CA1 field of the hippocampus and spontaneous locomotor patterns on a cylindrical treadmill (Figures 1, S1, and S2). These measures relate to the internal state of the animal (Buzsáki, 1986Buzsáki G. Hippocampal sharp waves: their origin and significance.Brain Res. 1986; 398: 242-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, Loewenfeld, 1999Loewenfeld I.E. The Pupil. Anatomy, Physiology, and Clinical Applications. Volume 1. Butterworth Heinemann, Boston1999Google Scholar, Reimer et al., 2014Reimer J. Froudarakis E. Cadwell C.R. Yatsenko D. Denfield G.H. Tolias A.S. Pupil fluctuations track fast switching of cortical states during quiet wakefulness.Neuron. 2014; 84: 355-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Pupil diameter in waking mice varied widely on multiple time scales over the 1–3 hr recording/behavioral sessions (N = 41; n = 83), ranging from nearly pinpoint (∼0.15 mm) to nearly fully dilated (∼1.8 mm) in constant low-light conditions (see e.g., Figures 1B, 1C, 2A, 2B, 3A, 6A, 6C, S2, S4, and S5). Pupil dilations exhibited a broad range of periodicities and amplitudes, but three features were prominent: (1) frequent and brief (∼2 to 3 s duration) dilations (Figures 1C and 2), (2) slower constrictions over periods of 5–30 s (Figures 1C and 3), and (3) nearly fully dilated pupils encompassing periods of walking (Figures 1B and 2A). We term the rapid, relatively brief dilations, “microdilations” to differentiate them from more prolonged changes in diameter. We detected microdilations by their rapid rate of rise of pupil diameter at their onset (see Experimental Procedures; Figures 1C and S4D). To determine the relationship between the pupil diameter and brain state, we compared the moment-to-moment pupil diameter to fast ripples associated with sharp waves and theta activity in the hippocampus during spontaneous state changes in the absence of sensory stimulation (see Experimental Procedures). The pupil diameter exhibited a strong inverse relationship to the rate of occurrence of fast ripples (Figures 1C–1F and S1), with a peak coherence of 0.78 ± 0.07 (n = 6 cells from N = 6 animals) at low frequencies (<0.05 Hz) and a significant coherence at all frequencies up to 1 Hz (Figures 1E). Theta activity was largely associated with walking (Figures 1C, S1B, and S1C). These results support the view that pupil diameter may be a useful indicator of brain state (Murphy et al., 2011Murphy P.R. Robertson I.H. Balsters J.H. O’connell R.G.

Arousal and locomotion make distinct contributions to cortical activity patterns and visual encoding.Neuron. 2015; 86: 740-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). To ensure that pupil dilations were not in response to changes in illumination due to eye movements, we also measured eyelid opening in darkness (Figure S2), since eyelid opening and pupil diameter are coupled together through co-innervation by the sympathetic nervous system (Loewenfeld, 1999Loewenfeld I.E. The Pupil. Anatomy, Physiology, and Clinical Applications. Volume 1. Butterworth Heinemann, Boston1999Google Scholar). As expected, pupil dilation and eyelid opening fluctuated coherently, such that even in darkness (where pupil dilation is saturated) eyelid opening exhibited the same slow changes associated with walking or disengagement and micro-openings that are characteristic of pupil diameter (Figure S2; N = 7 animals). We also found that an easily measured proxy for changes in lid opening and pupil diameter is the amount of light reflected from the eye from an infrared light source, a measure we term eye-indexed state (EIS) (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2; N = 7). These results indicate that pupil dilation in constant illumination, eyelid opening in the dark, or EIS in either condition are precise, accurate, and easily obtained measures of brain state. Large pupillary dilations, whisking, walking, and other movements frequently, but not always, occurred simultaneously as part of a larger realm of behavioral state changes, as observed previously (Mitchinson et al., 2011Mitchinson B. Grant R.A. Arkley K. Rankov V. Perkon I. Prescott T.J. Active vibrissal sensing in rodents and marsupials.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

Nelson A. Mooney R. A synaptic and circuit basis for corollary discharge in the auditory cortex.Nature. 2014; 513: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). We primarily focus on pupil diameter as a measure of state, owing to its ease of measurement, non-invasive nature, and ability to continuously and sensitively track state changes, whether or not they accompany overt walking, whisking, or other movements (see e.g., Movie S1). The maximal pupil diameter achieved during each recording or behavioral session always occurred during walking and varied, slightly, from day to day and animal to animal. Thus, to facilitate population-level comparisons and analysis, we normalized the pupil diameter by dividing by its maximal value in each session (see Figure 1B; see Experimental Procedures). Next we examined if pupil diameter/eyelid opening was related to the state of activity in auditory cortical neurons. We performed whole-cell recordings from auditory cortex (ACtx) layer 4 or 5 presumed excitatory neurons (see Figure S3) in waking animals, measured spontaneous activity without sound presentation, and measured either pupil diameter (n = 9 neurons in N = 7 animals) or EIS (n = 7 neurons in N = 5 animals). Remarkably, the microdilations/micro-openings observed in still animals were reliably associated with 5–20 mV time-locked depolarization of cortical neuronal membrane potential (Figure 2; see also Figures 3 and S4; n = 16 neurons). These transient depolarizations preceded pupil dilation/eyelid opening by 1.1 ± 0.1 s (n = 16; see Figure 2C, inset). Much or all of this lag may represent the slow time course of pupillary/eyelid movement to alterations in sympathetic and parasympathetic activity (Loewenfeld, 1999Loewenfeld I.E. The Pupil. Anatomy, Physiology, and Clinical Applications. Volume 1. Butterworth Heinemann, Boston1999Google Scholar). Microdilations were of a similar duration as the transient depolarizations (Figures 2A and 2B), and typically exhibited a rapid rise and a slower return to baseline (see e.g., Figures 2A, 2B, 3A, and S4D), suggestive of activation of the sympathetic innervation of pupillary dilator muscles (Loewenfeld, 1999Loewenfeld I.E. The Pupil. Anatomy, Physiology, and Clinical Applications. Volume 1. Butterworth Heinemann, Boston1999Google Scholar). We performed detailed analysis of the nine recordings with long, stable membrane potential recordings, high-quality pupillometry data, and in which the pupil of the animal exhibited variation over a broad range of diameters. Membrane potential of cortical neurons exhibited a remarkably high coherence (calculated in a 200 s sliding window; see Experimental Procedures) with pupil diameter, peaking at 0.7 ± 0.1 at approximately 0.03 Hz (Figure 2C; n = 9). The close relationship between microdilations and transient depolarization was apparent as a peak in coherence at ∼0.3 Hz, reflecting their seconds-long time course (Figure 2C). In addition to a high correlation between cortical membrane potential and pupil diameter during microdilations, we also noted that in anticipation of a bout of walking, cortical membrane potential depolarized, followed (∼1 s later) by large dilation of the pupil and finally (3 to 4 s later) walking (Figures 2 and S4). Walking was always associated with large diameter pupils (Figure 1B; see also Figure 6C), indicating that our animals only walked during high arousal states, and that the transition from still to walking is typically associated with a large change in arousal. Following the cessation of walking, the pupil diameter slowly constricted and cortical membrane potential slowly repolarized (n = 9; Figures 2 and S4). The changes in membrane potential we observed in cortical neurons with pupil dilations or walking did not result from disruptions of recording quality, since the membrane potential depolarization initiated prior to each behavioral event (e.g., dilation or walking) and always returned to pre-movement levels once movement or arousal ceased. Furthermore, spike threshold was only weakly correlated (r = −0.16 ± 0.08) with pupil diameter and varied largely in relation to the rate-of-rise of the membrane potential leading up to action potential threshold, irrespective of pupillary or walking patterns (Figure S3H–S3J; see Experimental Procedures) (Azouz and Gray, 2000Azouz R.

In addition to the high positive correlation between pupil diameter/eyelid microdilations and cortical neuronal membrane potential (e.g., Figures 2A and S4) that occurred during periods of intermediate to high arousal, additional features were apparent. Constricted pupil diameters (e.g., low arousal) were associated with slow rhythmic synaptic activity, resulting in high power in the low (2–10 Hz) and delta (1–4 Hz) frequency ranges, resulting in high membrane potential variance (see e.g., Figures 2A, 2B, 3A, S5, and S6). Dilation of the pupils from small toward intermediate diameters resulted in a strong suppression of this low-frequency synaptic activity, which in turn resulted in an average hyperpolarization of t"

Yet, essentially all HSC studies have been performed with cells isolated and processed in non-physiologic ambient air. By collecting and manipulating bone marrow and cord blood in native conditions of hypoxia, we demonstrate that brief exposure to ambient oxygen decreases recovery of long-term repopulating HSCs and increases progenitor cells, a phenomenon we term extraphysiologic oxygen shock/stress (EPHOSS). Thus, true numbers of HSCs in the bone marrow and cord blood are routinely underestimated. We linked ROS production and induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) via cyclophilin D and p53 as mechanisms of EPHOSS. The MPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A protects mouse bone marrow and human cord blood HSCs from EPHOSS during collection in air, resulting in increased recovery of transplantable HSCs. Mitigating EPHOSS during cell collection and processing by pharmacological means may be clinically advantageous for transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W1581353228,"We show that ATE1-encoded Arg-transfer RNA transferase (R-transferase) of the N-end rule pathway mediates N-terminal arginylation of multiple endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-residing chaperones, leading to their cytosolic relocalization and turnover. N-terminal arginylation of BiP (also known as GRP78), protein disulphide isomerase and calreticulin is co-induced with autophagy during innate immune responses to cytosolic foreign DNA or proteasomal inhibition, associated with increased ubiquitylation. Arginylated BiP (R-BiP) is induced by and associated with cytosolic misfolded proteins destined for p62 (also known as sequestosome 1, SQSTM1) bodies. R-BiP binds the autophagic adaptor p62 through the interaction of its N-terminal arginine with the p62 ZZ domain. This allosterically induces self-oligomerization and aggregation of p62 and increases p62 interaction with LC3, leading to p62 targeting to autophagosomes and selective lysosomal co-degradation of R-BiP and p62 together with associated cargoes. In this autophagic mechanism, Nt-arginine functions as a delivery determinant, a degron and an activating ligand. Bioinformatics analysis predicts that many ER residents use arginylation to regulate non-ER processes. Kim and colleagues and Kwon and colleagues reveal that amino-terminal arginylation of BiP promotes its targeting to autophagy adaptor p62 and subsequent lysosomal degradation of BiP, p62 and associated cargo."
https://openalex.org/W2127373801,"Early studies from psychology suggest that sleep facilitates memory retention by stopping ongoing retroactive interference caused by mental activity or external sensory stimuli. Neuroscience research with animal models, on the other hand, suggests that sleep facilitates retention by enhancing memory consolidation. Recently, in Drosophila, the ongoing activity of specific dopamine neurons was shown to regulate the forgetting of olfactory memories. Here, we show this ongoing dopaminergic activity is modulated with behavioral state, increasing robustly with locomotor activity and decreasing with rest. Increasing sleep-drive, with either the sleep-promoting agent Gaboxadol or by genetic stimulation of the neural circuit for sleep, decreases ongoing dopaminergic activity, while enhancing memory retention. Conversely, increasing arousal stimulates ongoing dopaminergic activity and accelerates dopaminergic-based forgetting. Therefore, forgetting is regulated by the behavioral state modulation of dopaminergic-based plasticity. Our findings integrate psychological and neuroscience research on sleep and forgetting."
https://openalex.org/W1580426270,"Animals can detect and consume nutritive sugars without the influence of taste. However, the identity of the taste-independent nutrient sensor and the mechanism by which animals respond to the nutritional value of sugar are unclear. Here, we report that six neurosecretory cells in the Drosophila brain that produce Diuretic hormone 44 (Dh44), a homolog of the mammalian corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), were specifically activated by nutritive sugars. Flies in which the activity of these neurons or the expression of Dh44 was disrupted failed to select nutritive sugars. Manipulation of the function of Dh44 receptors had a similar effect. Notably, artificial activation of Dh44 receptor-1 neurons resulted in proboscis extensions and frequent episodes of excretion. Conversely, reduced Dh44 activity led to decreased excretion. Together, these actions facilitate ingestion and digestion of nutritive foods. We propose that the Dh44 system directs the detection and consumption of nutritive sugars through a positive feedback loop."
https://openalex.org/W1905375199,"Consolidation of long-term memories depends on de novo protein synthesis. Several translational regulators have been identified, and their contribution to the formation of memory has been assessed in the mouse hippocampus. None of them, however, has been implicated in the persistence of memory. Although persistence is a key feature of long-term memory, how this occurs, despite the rapid turnover of its molecular substrates, is poorly understood. Here we find that both memory storage and its underlying synaptic plasticity are mediated by the increase in level and in the aggregation of the prion-like translational regulator CPEB3 (cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein). Genetic ablation of CPEB3 impairs the maintenance of both hippocampal long-term potentiation and hippocampus-dependent spatial memory. We propose a model whereby persistence of long-term memory results from the assembly of CPEB3 into aggregates. These aggregates serve as functional prions and regulate local protein synthesis necessary for the maintenance of long-term memory."
https://openalex.org/W611597605,"The chemosensory capacity of the somatosensory system relies on the appropriate expression of chemoreceptors, which detect chemical stimuli and transduce sensory information into cellular signals. Knowledge of the complete repertoire of the chemoreceptors expressed in human sensory ganglia is lacking. This study employed the next-generation sequencing technique (RNA-Seq) to conduct the first expression analysis of human trigeminal ganglia (TG) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG). We analyzed the data with a focus on G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels, which are (potentially) involved in chemosensation by somatosensory neurons in the human TG and DRG. For years, transient receptor potential (TRP) channels have been considered the main group of receptors for chemosensation in the trigeminal system. Interestingly, we could show that sensory ganglia also express a panel of different olfactory receptors (ORs) with putative chemosensory function. To characterize OR expression in more detail, we performed microarray, semi-quantitative RT-PCR experiments, and immunohistochemical staining. Additionally, we analyzed the expression data to identify further known or putative classes of chemoreceptors in the human TG and DRG. Our results give an overview of the major classes of chemoreceptors expressed in the human TG and DRG and provide the basis for a broader understanding of the reception of chemical cues."
https://openalex.org/W1951576969,"Chronic itch is a prevalent and debilitating condition for which few effective therapies are available. We harnessed the natural variation across genetically distinct mouse strains to identify transcripts co-regulated with itch behavior. This survey led to the discovery of the serotonin receptor HTR7 as a key mediator of serotonergic itch. Activation of HTR7 promoted opening of the ion channel TRPA1, which in turn triggered itch behaviors. In addition, acute itch triggered by serotonin or a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor required both HTR7 and TRPA1. Aberrant serotonin signaling has long been linked to a variety of human chronic itch conditions, including atopic dermatitis. In a mouse model of atopic dermatitis, mice lacking HTR7 or TRPA1 displayed reduced scratching and skin lesion severity. These data highlight a role for HTR7 in acute and chronic itch and suggest that HTR7 antagonists may be useful for treating a variety of pathological itch conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1784684866,"To investigate vitamin D-related control of brain-expressed genes, candidate vitamin D responsive elements (VDREs) at -7/-10 kb in human tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH)2 were probed. Both VDREs bound the vitamin D receptor (VDR)-retinoid X receptor (RXR) complex and drove reporter gene transcription in response to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D). Brain TPH2 mRNA, encoding the rate-limiting enzyme in serotonin synthesis, was induced 2.2-fold by 10 nM 1,25D in human U87 glioblastoma cells and 47.8-fold in rat serotonergic RN46A-B14 cells. 1,25D regulation of leptin (Lep), encoding a serotoninlike satiety factor, was also examined. In mouse adipocytes, 1,25D repressed leptin mRNA levels by at least 84%, whereas 1,25D induced leptin mRNA 15.1-fold in human glioblastoma cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis of the mouse Lep gene in response to 1,25D revealed a cluster of regulatory sites (cis-regulatory module; CRM) at -28 kb that 1,25D-dependently docked VDR, RXR, C/EBPβ, and RUNX2. This CRM harbored 3 VDREs and single C/EBPβ and RUNX2 sites. Therefore, the expression of human TPH2 and mouse Lep are governed by 1,25D, potentially via respective VDREs located at -7/-10 kb and -28 kb. These results imply that vitamin D affects brain serotonin concentrations, which may be relevant to psychiatric disorders, such as autism, and may control leptin levels and affect eating behavior."

Here we show that loss of miR-15 and miR-16 in cooperation with increased miR-21 expression promote prostate cancer spreading and bone lesions. This combination of microRNA endows bone-metastatic potential to prostate cancer cells. Concomitant loss of miR-15/miR-16 and gain of miR-21 aberrantly activate TGF-β and Hedgehog signaling, that mediate local invasion, distant bone marrow colonization and osteolysis by prostate cancer cells. These findings establish a new molecular circuitry for prostate cancer metastasis that was validated in patients' cohorts.

https://openalex.org/W2109306696,"Compared to normal tissues, many cancer cells overexpress autotaxin (ATX). This secreted enzyme produces extracellular lysophosphatidate, which signals through 6 GPCRs to drive cancer progression. Our previous work showed that ATX inhibition decreases 4T1 breast tumor growth in BALB/c mice by 60% for about 11 d. However, 4T1 cells do not produce significant ATX. Instead, the ATX is produced by adjacent mammary adipose tissue. We investigated the molecular basis of this interaction in human and mouse breast tumors. Inflammatory mediators secreted by breast cancer cells increased ATX production in adipose tissue. The increased lysophosphatidate signaling further increased inflammatory mediator production in adipose tissue and tumors. Blocking ATX activity in mice bearing 4T1 tumors with 10 mg/kg/d ONO-8430506 (a competitive ATX inhibitor, IC90 = 100 nM; Ono Pharma Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) broke this vicious inflammatory cycle by decreasing 20 inflammatory mediators by 1.5-8-fold in cancer-inflamed adipose tissue. There was no significant decrease in inflammatory mediator levels in fat pads that did not bear tumors. ONO-8430506 also decreased plasma TNF-α and G-CSF cytokine levels by >70% and leukocyte infiltration in breast tumors and adjacent adipose tissue by >50%. Hence, blocking tumor-driven inflammation by ATX inhibition is effective in decreasing tumor growth in breast cancers where the cancer cells express negligible ATX."
https://openalex.org/W1524165063,"Mutations in SETD2, a histone H3 lysine trimethyltransferase, have been identified in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC); however it is unclear if loss of SETD2 function alters the genomic distribution of histone 3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) in ccRCC. Furthermore, published epigenomic profiles are not specific to H3K36me3 or metastatic tumors. To determine if progressive SETD2 and H3K36me3 dysregulation occurs in metastatic tumors, H3K36me3, SETD2 copy number (CN) or SETD2 mRNA abundance was assessed in two independent cohorts: metastatic ccRCC (n=71) and the Cancer Genome Atlas Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma data set (n=413). Although SETD2 CN loss occurs with high frequency (>90%), H3K36me3 is not significantly impacted by monoallelic loss of SETD2. H3K36me3-positive nuclei were reduced an average of ~20% in primary ccRCC (90% positive nuclei in uninvolved vs 70% positive nuclei in ccRCC) and reduced by ~60% in metastases (90% positive in uninvolved kidney vs 30% positive in metastases) (P<0.001). To define a kidney-specific H3K36me3 profile, we generated genome-wide H3K36me3 profiles from four cytoreductive nephrectomies and SETD2 isogenic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput DNA sequencing and RNA sequencing. SETD2 loss of methyltransferase activity leads to regional alterations of H3K36me3 associated with aberrant RNA splicing in a SETD2 mutant RCC and SETD2 knockout cell line. These data suggest that during progression of ccRCC, a decline in H3K36me3 is observed in distant metastases, and regional H3K36me3 alterations influence alternative splicing in ccRCC."

A phylogenetic analysis of the E. coli HADs suggested that their secondary activities might have no direct physiological function, but they could comprise a reservoir for the evolution of phosphatases with novel specificities. The genome of the yeast S. cerevisiae contains at least 45 genes encoding the predicted HAD-like hydrolases (IPR023214), which include 19 membrane proteins (mostly ATPases), seven HAD-like domains in large proteins, and 19 soluble, stand-alone HAD-like proteins (supplemental Table 1). From the last group, the enzymatic activity and specific substrates have previously been experimentally demonstrated for two deoxyglucose-6-phosphate phosphatases (DOG1 and DOG2), two glycerol-3-phosphate phosphatases (GPP1 and GPP2), DNA 3′-phosphatase TPP1, phosphomannomutase SEC53, phosphatidylglycerophosphatase GEP4, pyrimidine 5′-nucleotidase SDT1, and protein fructosamine 6-phosphatase MDP-1 (41Randez-Gil F.

Here, we present the results of biochemical and structural studies of soluble HAD-like hydrolases from S. cerevisiae with a focus on the 10 uncharacterized HADs. Eight previously uncharacterized HADs had phosphatase activity. Additional substrates were found for the five known S. cerevisiae HAD phosphatases. Collectively, these were active against 2-phosphoglycolate, thiamine monophosphate, pyridoxal phosphate, phosphoserine, glycerol 1-phosphate (Gly-1-P), nucleotides, and phosphorylated peptides. The crystal structures of four S. cerevisiae HADs provided insight into the molecular basis of their substrate specificity. Although the S. cerevisiae and E. coli HADs share low overall sequence similarities, these enzymes show remarkable conservation of their biochemical activities. The genes encoding 15 selected yeast HADs (Table 1) were amplified by PCR from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA and cloned into a modified pET15b vector (Novagen) as described previously (40Kuznetsova E.

https://openalex.org/W1953136439,"Dietary fructose that is linked to metabolic abnormalities can up-regulate its own absorption, but the underlying regulatory mechanisms are not known. We hypothesized that glucose transporter (GLUT) protein, member 5 (GLUT5) is the primary fructose transporter and that fructose absorption via GLUT5, metabolism via ketohexokinase (KHK), as well as GLUT5 trafficking to the apical membrane via the Ras-related protein-in-brain 11 (Rab11)a-dependent endosomes are each required for regulation. Introducing fructose but not lysine and glucose solutions into the lumen increased by 2- to 10-fold the heterogeneous nuclear RNA, mRNA, protein, and activity levels of GLUT5 in adult wild-type mice consuming chow. Levels of GLUT5 were >100-fold that of candidate apical fructose transporters GLUTs 7, 8, and 12 whose expression, and that of GLUT 2 and the sodium-dependent glucose transporter protein 1 (SGLT1), was not regulated by luminal fructose. GLUT5-knockout (KO) mice exhibited no facilitative fructose transport and no compensatory increases in activity and expression of SGLT1 and other GLUTs. Fructose could not up-regulate GLUT5 in GLUT5-KO, KHK-KO, and intestinal epithelial cell-specific Rab11a-KO mice. The fructose-specific metabolite glyceraldehyde did not increase GLUT5 expression. GLUT5 is the primary transporter responsible for facilitative absorption of fructose, and its regulation specifically requires fructose uptake and metabolism and normal GLUT5 trafficking to the apical membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1801698032,"The mechanisms by which some melanoma cells adapt to Serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf (BRAF) inhibitor therapy are incompletely understood. In the present study, we used mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics to determine how BRAF inhibition remodeled the signaling network of melanoma cell lines that were BRAF mutant and PTEN null. Short-term BRAF inhibition was associated with marked changes in fibronectin-based adhesion signaling that were PTEN dependent. These effects were recapitulated through BRAF siRNA knockdown and following treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs. Increased fibronectin expression was also observed in mouse xenograft models as well as specimens from melanoma patients undergoing BRAF inhibitor treatment. Analysis of a melanoma tissue microarray showed loss of PTEN expression to predict for a lower overall survival, with a trend for even lower survival being seen when loss of fibronectin was included in the analysis. Mechanistically, the induction of fibronectin limited the responses of these PTEN-null melanoma cell lines to vemurafenib, with enhanced cytotoxicity observed following the knockdown of either fibronectin or its receptor α5β1 integrin. This in turn abrogated the cytotoxic response to BRAF inhibition via increased AKT signaling, which prevented the induction of cell death by maintaining the expression of the pro-survival protein Mcl-1. The protection conveyed by the induction of FN expression could be overcome through combined treatment with a BRAF and PI3K inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W561219188,"Measurement of Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive human Mac-2 binding protein (WFA+-M2BP) in serum was recently shown to be a noninvasive method to assess liver fibrosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of serum WFA+-M2BP values to predict the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients who achieved a sustained virological response (SVR) by interferon treatment. For this purpose, we retrospectively analyzed 238 patients with SVR who were treated with interferon in our department. Serum WFA+-M2BP values were measured at pre-treatment (pre-Tx), post-treatment (24 weeks after completion of interferon; post-Tx), the time of HCC diagnosis, and the last clinical visit. Of 238 patients with SVR, HCC developed in 16 (6.8%) patients. The average follow-up period was 9.1 years. The cumulative incidence of HCC was 3.4% at 5 years and 7.5% at 10 years. The median pre-Tx and post-Tx WFA+-M2BP values were 1.69 (range: 0.28 to 12.04 cutoff index (COI)) and 0.80 (range: 0.17 to 5.29 COI), respectively. The WFA+-M2BP values decreased significantly after SVR (P < 0.001). The median post-Tx WFA+-M2BP value in patients who developed HCC was significantly higher than that in patients who did not (P < 0.01). Multivariate analysis disclosed that age (> 60 years), sex (male), pre-Tx platelet count (< 15.0×10(3)/μL), and post-Tx WFA+-M2BP (> 2.0 COI) were associated with the development of HCC after SVR. Conclusion: Post-Tx WFA+-M2BP (> 2.0 COI) is associated with the risk for development of HCC among patients with SVR. The WFA+-M2BP values could be a new predictor for HCC after SVR."

It was shown that inhibition of β1 integrins sensitizes cells to radiotherapy. Here, we examined the impact of β1 integrin targeting on the repair of radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). β1 Integrin inhibition was accomplished using the monoclonal antibody AIIB2 and experiments were performed in three-dimensional cell cultures and tumor xenografts of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines. AIIB2, X-ray irradiation, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown and Olaparib treatment were performed and residual DSB number, protein and gene expression, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) activity as well as clonogenic survival were determined. β1 Integrin targeting impaired repair of radiogenic DSB (γH2AX/53BP1, pDNA-PKcs T2609 foci) in vitro and in vivo and reduced the protein expression of Ku70, Rad50 and Nbs1. Further, we identified Ku70, Ku80 and DNA-PKcs but not poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 to reside in the β1 integrin pathway. Intriguingly, combined inhibition of β1 integrin and PARP using Olaparib was significantly more effective than either treatment alone in non-irradiated and irradiated HNSCC cells. Here, we support β1 integrins as potential cancer targets and highlight a regulatory role for β1 integrins in the repair of radiogenic DNA damage via classical NHEJ. Further, the data suggest combined targeting of β1 integrin and PARP as promising approach for radiosensitization of HNSCC."
https://openalex.org/W576512939,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and its sequelae remain a major public health burden, but both HBV basic research and the development of antiviral therapeutics have been hindered by the lack of an efficient in vitro infection system. Recently, sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) has been identified as the HBV receptor. We herein report that we established a NTCP-complemented HepG2 cell line (HepG2-NTCP12) that supports HBV infection, albeit at a low infectivity level following the reported infection procedures. In our attempts to optimize the infection conditions, we found that the centrifugation of HepG2-NTCP12 cells during HBV inoculation (termed ""spinoculation"") significantly enhanced the virus infectivity. Moreover, the infection level gradually increased with accelerated speed of spinoculation up to 1,000g tested. However, the enhancement of HBV infection was not significantly dependent upon the duration of centrifugation. Furthermore, covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA was detected in infected cells under optimized infection condition by conventional Southern blot, suggesting a successful establishment of HBV infection after spinoculation. Finally, the parental HepG2 cells remained uninfected under HBV spinoculation, and HBV entry inhibitors targeting NTCP blocked HBV infection when cells were spinoculated, suggesting the authentic virus entry mechanism is unaltered under centrifugal inoculation. Our data suggest that spinoculation could serve as a standard protocol for enhancing the efficiency of HBV infection in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W640419040,"Pro-inflammatory cytokines have been noted to increase following exercise but their relationship to exercise-induced cardiac dysfunction has not previously been investigated. We sought to evaluate whether exercise-induced cardiac dysfunction was associated with increases in cytokines, particularly the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-12p70 and TNFα, which have been most implicated in cardiac pathology.40 well-trained endurance athletes underwent evaluation prior to and immediately following one of four endurance sporting events ranging from 3 to 11 hours duration. Cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70 and TNFα) were analyzed by flow cytometry from serum samples collected within 50 minutes of race completion. Cardiac troponin (cTnI) and B-type natriuretic peptide were combined with an echocardiographic assessment of cardiac function, and a composite of cTnI > 0.04 μg/L, BNP increase > 10 ng/L and a decrease in right ventricular ejection (RVEF) > 10% were prospectively defined as evidence of myocardial dysfunction.Relative to baseline, IL-6 IL-8 and IL-10 increased 8.5-, 2.9-, and 7.1-fold, respectively, P<0.0001. Thirty-one (78%), 19 (48%) and 18 (45%) of the athletes met the pre-specified criteria for significant cTnI, BNP and RVEF changes, respectively. TNFα, IL-12p70 were univariate predictors of ΔRVEF and ΔBNP whilst none of the anti-inflammatory cytokines were significantly associated with these measures. Ten athletes (25%, all athletes competing in the endurance event of longest duration) met criteria for exercise-induced myocardial dysfunction. In these 10 athletes with myocardial dysfunction, as compared to those without, there was significantly greater post-race expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12p70 (8.1±3.8 pg/ml vs. 2.5±2.6 pg/ml, P<0.0001) and TNFα (6.5±3.1 pg/ml vs. 2.0±2.5 pg/ml, P<0.0001).Cardiac dysfunction following intense endurance exercise was associated with increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This does not prove a causal relationship but provides rationale for further investigations into whether inflammation mediates exercise-induced myocardial dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2267666909,"FOXF2 (forkhead box F2) is a mesenchyme-specific transcription factor that plays a critical role in tissue homeostasis through the maintenance of epithelial polarity. In a previous study, we demonstrated that FOXF2 is specifically expressed in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) cells and functions as an epithelial-mesenchymal transition suppressor. FOXF2 deficiency enhances the metastatic ability of BLBC cells through activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition program, but reduces cell proliferation. In this study, we demonstrate that CpG island methylation of the FOXF2 proximal promoter region is involved in the regulatory mechanism of the subtype-specific expression of FOXF2 in breast cancer cells. DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B commonly or individually contributed to this DNA methylation in different breast cancer cells. SP1 regulated the transcriptional activity of FOXF2 through direct binding to the proximal promoter region, whereas this binding was abrogated through DNA methylation. FOXF2 mediated the SP1-regulated suppression of progression and promotion of proliferation of non-methylated BLBC cells. Thus, we conclude that the subtype-specific expression and function of FOXF2 in breast cancer cells are regulated through the combined effects of DNA methylation and SP1 transcriptional regulation.

To examine the mechanisms by which the innate immune system coordinates different stages of the host response to fungal pathogens, we dissect the immune-cell response into chemotaxis, adhesion, and phagocytosis. Our single-cell technique reveals a surprisingly strong response by initially quiescent neutrophils to close encounters with C. posadasii, both from a distance (by complement-mediated chemotaxis) as well as upon contact (by serum-dependent adhesion and phagocytosis). This response closely resembles neutrophil interactions with Candida albicans and zymosan particles, and is significantly stronger than the neutrophil responses to Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Rhizopus oryzae under identical conditions. The vigorous in vitro neutrophil response suggests that C. posadasii evades in vivo recognition by neutrophils through suppression of long-range mobilization and recruitment of the immune cells. This observation elucidates an important paradigm of the recognition of microbes, i.e., that intact immunotaxis comprises an intricate spatiotemporal hierarchy of distinct chemotactic processes. Moreover, in contrast to earlier reports, human neutrophils exhibit vigorous chemotaxis toward, and frustrated phagocytosis of, the large spherules of C. posadasii under physiological-like conditions. Finally, neutrophils from healthy donors and patients with chronic coccidioidomycosis display subtle differences in their responses to antibody-coated beads, even though the patient cells appear to interact normally with C. posadasii endospores."
https://openalex.org/W1620750937,"The unique chromatin signature of ES cells is fundamental to the pluripotency and differentiation of ES cells. One key feature is the poised chromatin state of master developmental genes that are transcriptionally repressed in ES cells but ready to be activated in response to differentiation signals. Poised chromatin in ES cells contains both H3 Lys-4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and H3 Lys-27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) methylation, indicating activating and repressing potential. However, the contribution of non-covalent chromatin structure to the poised state is not well understood. To address whether remodeling of nucleosomes is important to the poised state, we characterized the function of BAF250a, a key regulatory subunit of the ES cell ATP-dependent Brahma-associated factor (BAF) chromatin remodeling complex (esBAF). Acute deletion of BAF250a disrupted the differentiation potential of ES cells by altering the expression timing of key developmental genes and pluripotent genes. Our genome-wide nucleosome and histone modification analyses indicated that the disruption of gene expression timing was largely due to changes of chromatin structures at poised genes, particularly those key developmental genes mediated by BAF250a. Specifically, BAF250a deletion caused a nucleosome occupancy increase at H3K4me3- and/or H3K27me3-associated promoters. Moreover, H3K27me3 levels and the number of bivalent promoter genes were reduced in BAF250a KO ES cells. We revealed that BAF250a ablation led to elevated Brg1 but reduced Suz12 recruitment at nucleosome occupancy-increased regions, indicating an unexpected and complicated role of BAF250a in regulating esBAF and Polycomb repressive complex (PRC) activities. Together, our studies identified that BAF250a mediates esBAF and PRC functions to establish the poised chromatin configuration in ES cells, which is essential for the proper differentiation of ES cells.

Embryonic stem cells are capable of self-renewal and differentiation into all somatic and germ line cell types. A comprehensive network of transcription and epigenetic factors regulates proper ES cell function (1Surani M.A. Hayashi K. Hajkova P. Genetic and epigenetic regulators of pluripotency.Cell. 2007; 128: 747-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that chromatin structure plays an essential role in ES cell regulation (2Gaspar-Maia A. Alajem A. Meshorer E. Ramalho-Santos M. Open chromatin in pluripotency and reprogramming.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 36-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). One unique feature of the ES cell genome is the presence of an open chromatin structure compared with somatic cells (3Mattout A. Meshorer E. Chromatin plasticity and genome organization in pluripotent embryonic stem cells.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2010; 22: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), with higher chromatin accessibility, as characterized by higher levels of the active histone modification H3K4me3, lower occupancy of nucleosomes, and less heterochromatin (4Meshorer E. Yellajoshula D. George E. Scambler P.J. Brown D.T. Misteli T. Hyperdynamic plasticity of chromatin proteins in pluripotent embryonic stem cells.Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 105-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). During ES cell differentiation, developmental genes and signals are rapidly activated to direct lineage specification. In ES cells, most key developmental transcription factors are in bivalent state which is characterized by the presence of both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3. During differentiation, these developmental genes quickly lose the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 and become activated (5Bernstein B.E. Mikkelsen T.S. Xie X. Kamal M. Huebert D.J. Cuff J. Fry B. Meissner A. Wernig M. Plath K. Jaenisch R. Wagschal A. Feil R. Schreiber S.L. Lander E.S. A bivalent chromatin structure marks key developmental genes in embryonic stem cells.Cell. 2006; 125: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4050) Google Scholar). However, despite being a major component of chromatin, the role of nucleosome configuration in maintaining the poised chromatin structure and regulating rapid gene activation during differentiation is not clear. Nucleosome configuration is regulated through ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, which use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to slide, remodel, displace, and replace the nucleosomes (6Lorch Y.

BAF complexes play important roles during various biological processes with different assemblies of the complexes (9Wu J.I. Lessard J. Crabtree G.R.

Chromatin remodelling during development.Nature. 2010; 463: 474-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). In ES cells, the BAF complex is composed of unique subunit components termed esBAF (11Ho L. Jothi R. Ronan J.L. Cui K. Zhao K. Crabtree G.R. An embryonic stem cell chromatin remodeling complex, esBAF, is an essential component of the core pluripotency transcriptional network.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 5187-5191Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Disruption of esBAF components, such as BAF250a, BRG1, and BAF155, leads to ES cell pluripotency defects (12Gao X. Tate P. Hu P. Tjian R. Skarnes W.C. Wang Z. ES cell pluripotency and germ-layer formation require the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling component BAF250a.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In this study, we sought to address how esBAF complexes maintain specific chromatin architecture, in particular the nucleosomes, and attempted to connect the nucleosome and related chromatin structures to ES cell maintenance and rapid differentiation. To achieve this goal, we generated tamoxifen-inducible BAF250a KO ES cells. We then applied genome-wide nucleosome mapping by MNase-sequencing and histone modifications, including H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, by ChIP-sequencing to study the function of esBAF in regulating key chromatin structures in ES cells. We further identified the regulatory roles of BAF250a in recruiting esBAF and PRC2, a complex that deposits H3K27 trimethylation. Our result showed that BAF250a mediates the proper nucleosome occupancy and H3K27me3 modification at ES cells by regulating esBAF and PRCs, and disruption of these epigenetic regulations caused the differentiation defects in BAF250a KO ES cells. E3.5 blastocysts were collected by crossing CreErt2;BAF250af/f with BAF250af/f mice. Blastocysts were washed with M2 medium (M7167), followed by treatment of acidic Tyrode's solution to remove the zonae pellucidae. Blastocysts were cultured for 7 days for outgrowth, and ES cell were generated by dissociating the outgrowth as described previously (14Nagy A. Marina G. Kristina V. Richard B. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2003: 359-398Google Scholar). Inducible BAF250a KO ES cells with the Rosa26-LacZ reporter were also generated using E3.5 blastocysts from CreErt2;BAF250af/f with BAF250af/f;Rosa26-LacZ mice. WT and BAF250a KO ES cells with Rosa26-LacZ reporter were injected into WT embryos and harvested at E9.5. The embryos were then fixed and stained with X-gal. Embryonic tissue derived from BAF250a-inducible KO ES cells were identified by X-gal staining (blue). In principle, normal ES cells contribute to all embryo lineages. ES cells were cultured under standard conditions (DMEM, 2 mm glutamine, sodium pyruvate, non-essential amino acids, 15% FBS, 0.1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1000 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor) on mouse embryonic fibroblast feeders. ES cells were treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen for 36 h and recovered for 36 h to generate BAF250a KO ES cells. ES cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and the fixation was stopped in 0.125 m glycine for 5 min. ES cells were rinsed with cold PBS and collected by scraper. 2 × 107 cells were washed with cold PBS twice and resuspended in nuclear lysis buffer (5 mm PIPES (pH 8.0), 85 mm KCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and rocked at 4 °C for 10 min. The nuclei pellet was collected by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min. Mouse ES cells were dissociated and resuspended in 15% FBS/DMEM at a concentration of 3.3 × 104 cells/ml. 15 μl of cell suspension was then added to the dish and aggregated to form EBs using the hanging drop method (15Takahashi T. Lord B. Schulze P.C. Fryer R.M. Sarang S.S. Gullans S.R. Lee R.T. Ascorbic acid enhances differentiation of embryonic stem cells into cardiac myocytes.Circulation. 2003; 107: 1912-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). EBs were collected every other day for gene expression analysis. Nuclei were digested with three concentrations of MNase for 15 min at room temperature. MNase-digested nuclei were decross-linked at 55 °C overnight with proteinase K digestion. DNAs were harvested via phenol-chloroform extraction. Nucleosomal DNAs were run on 1% agarose gels, and the mononucleosomal DNAs (150 bp) were gel-purified. Mononucleosomal DNAs from three digestions were pooled and prepared for sequencing (16Bowman S.K. Simon M.D. Deaton A.M. Tolstorukov M. Borowsky M.L. Kingston R.E. Multiplexed Illumina sequencing libraries from picogram quantities of DNA.BMC Genomics. 2013; 14: 466Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Sequencing reads were aligned to mouse genome data (mm9) using Bowtie (17Langmead B. Trapnell C. Pop M. Salzberg S.L. Ultrafast and memory-efficient alignment of short DNA sequences to the human genome.Genome Biol. 2009; 10: R25Crossref PubMed Scopus (14996) Google Scholar) with the following options: -M 1 -q -v 2 -k 1 -X 2000 -best -strata. The distribution of mononucleosome fragment sizes was calculated. MNase-seq fragments with different fragment size distribution will lead to extensive false positives in the analysis (18Chen K. Xi Y.

DANPOS: dynamic analysis of nucleosome position and occupancy by sequencing.Genome Res. 2013; 23: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The fragment sizes determined by paired-end MNase-seq were calculated to confirm that the fragment sizes of different samples were comparable. Nucleosome occupancy was analyzed by DANPOS (18Chen K. Xi Y. Pan X. Li Z. Kaestner K. Tyler J. Dent S. He X. Li W. DANPOS: dynamic analysis of nucleosome position and occupancy by sequencing.Genome Res. 2013; 23: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) with default parameters. Briefly, different replicates were pooled, and the nucleosome occupancy was calculated at base pair resolution. The nucleosome occupancy was then normalized with quantile normalization. The nucleosome coverage was calculated by read per million reads. All aligned plots of nucleosome occupancy were calculated with 10-bp binning, and the midpoints of fragments were considered nucleosome centers. The coordinates of transcription start site (TSS) of each gene cluster were retrieved from the UCSC genome browser. The binding site coordinates of Suz12 were obtained from GSE11431 (19Chen X. Xu H. Yuan P. Fang F. Huss M. Vega V.B. Wong E. Orlov Y.L. Zhang W. Jiang J. Loh Y.-H. Yeo H.C. Yeo Z.X. Narang V. Govindarajan K.R. Leong B. Shahab A. Ruan Y. Bourque G. Sung W.-K. Clarke N.D. Wei C.-L.

Nuclei were pelleted and digested with MNase in MNase digestion buffer for 15 min at 37 °C. Chromatins were collected by brief sonication and incubated with Mangabeads and antibodies against H3K4me3 (Millipore, catalog no. 07-473), H3K27me3 (Millipore, catalog no. 07-449), and Suz12 (Abcam, catalog no. ab12073) overnight. The chromatin solutions were washed four times with LiCl wash buffer and eluded with elution buffer at 65 °C. DNAs were purified using phenol:chloroform extraction. Enrichment of immunoprecipitation DNA was then validated by quantitative PCR. Approximately 100 ng of ChIPed DNAs were used to prepared the library using the NEBNext kit (E6240) following the protocol of the manufacturer. The ChIP-seq reads were aligned to mouse genome data (mm9) using Bowtie with the following options: -M 1 -q -v 2 -k 1 -X 2000 -best -strata. Peak calling was performed using SCIER 1.1 (20Zang C. Schones D.E. Zeng C. Cui K. Zhao K. Peng W. A clustering approach for identification of enriched domains from histone modification ChIP-Seq data.Bioinformatics. 2009; 25: 1952-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar) with the following parameters: window size, 200; gap size, 600; false discovery rate, 0.05. The input DNAs were used as a control. The ChIP-seq reads at each base pair were normalized to read per million reads. The coverage of the ChIP-seq signal across TSS was calculated by averaging the ChIP-seq signals at 10-bp binning. The cell lysates were prepared from cells as described previously (21Yan Z. Wang Z. Sharova L. Sharov A.A. Ling C. Piao Y. Aiba K. Matoba R. Wang W. Ko M.S. BAF250B-associated SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex is required to maintain undifferentiated mouse embryonic stem cells.Stem Cells. 2008; 26: 1155-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 million cells were harvested and washed with PBS twice. Cell pellets were then subjected to lysis buffer. The cell lysate were immunoprecipitated with Brg1 antibody and protein G beads at 4 °C overnight. The protein G beads/proteins were washed three times with wash buffer and eluted with elution buffer. The precipitated proteins were identified with specific BAF component antibody by Western blot analyses. Total RNA was isolated from WT and inducible BAF250a KO ES cells using TRIzol according to the protocol of the manufacturer, followed by quality assessment using Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent). RNA was then subjected to in vitro transcription and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse 2.0 ST arrays. The V5 sequence was inserted into the C terminus of Brg1 using CRISPR/Cas9 technology (22Mali P. Yang L. Esvelt K.M. Aach J. Guell M. DiCarlo J.E. Norville J.E. Church G.M. RNA-guided human genome engineering via Cas9.Science. 2013; 339: 823-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (6424) Google Scholar). In brief, guide RNA (5′-CCGCTCAGGAAGTGGCAGTG-3′), the V5 sequence with a 50-bp 5′ and 3′ arm (single-stranded DNA synthesized from IDT), and the Cas9 plasmid were electroporated into 1 million ES cells. Two thousand cells were then seeded in a 10-cm dish, andV5 knockin ES cells clones were picked and identified by PCR. We have shown previously that BAF250a is required for the maintenance of ES cell pluripotency (12Gao X. Tate P. Hu P. Tjian R. Skarnes W.C. Wang Z. ES cell pluripotency and germ-layer formation require the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling component BAF250a.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6656-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Because long-term culture of BAF250a KO ES cells without feeder cells could lead to secondary events (12Gao X. Tate P. Hu P. Tjian R. Skarnes W.C. Wang Z. ES cell pluripotency and germ-layer formation require the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling component BAF250a.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6656-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), we generated tamoxifen-inducible BAF250a KO ES cells to investigate the immediate effect of BAF250a deletion. In these conditional KO ES cells, BAF250a was excised rapidly, and BAF250a protein was depleted 72 h after tamoxifen treatment (data not shown). Interestingly, these cells continued to abundantly express pluripotent genes such as OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG (data not shown). To study the effect of BAF250a on ES cell pluripotency and differentiation, we first performed chimera analyses by injecting both WT and BAF250a KO ES cells into E3.5 blastocysts. About 60% of WT and BAF250a KO ES cells could contribute to form chimeras (WT, 15 chimeras in 22 embryos; KO, 6 chimeras in 10 embryos). However, WT ES cells could contribute to almost all cell lineages, whereas BAF250a KO ES cells displayed remarkable defects in contributing to three germ layers of embryos (Fig. 1A), suggesting that BAF250a is required for potency of ES cells. To study the regulation of BAF250a on developmental genes during differentiation, we performed an in vitro EB differentiation assay and analyzed gene expression by quantitative PCR. We found that, during differentiation, the expression of developmental genes such as Otx2, Nes, Hoxb3, Pax2, Eomes, T, Hand1, Sox7, Sox17, Foxa1, and Foxa2 were aberrant. In particular the mesoderm and endoderm genes were delayed dramatically in BAF250a KO cells (Fig. 1B). Importantly, pluripotent genes such as Oct4 and Esrrb were not shut down properly during differentiation (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that BAF250a-mediated epigenetic mechanisms are essential for gene expression plasticity during ES cell differentiation. Given the nucleosome remodeling function of the esBAF complex, it is likely that BAF250a regulates ES cell function through mediate nucleosome structures. Therefore, we examined the genome-wide nucleosome profile in both WT and BAF250a-inducible KO ES cells using mild micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion coupled with high-throughput sequencing of mononucleosome-protected DNA fragments, as described previously (23Dennis J.H.

To validate the MNase-seq results, we analyzed the fragment distribution of MNase-seq. The size distribution of all samples was similar, and the average fragment size in WT and KO cells was 153/154 and 159/161, respectively, indicating that they had undergone a similar degree of MNase digestion. We then analyzed the nucleosome profile at the binding sites of chromatin insulators such as CTCF and REST. Consistent with previous reports (25Hu G. Schones D.E. Cui K. Ybarra R. Northrup D. Tang Q. Gattinoni L. Restifo N.P. Huang S. Zhao K.

To study the nucleosome changes in BAF250a KO ES cells, we studied the nucleosome profiles at TSS regions. We observed a well organized nucleosome positioning at TSS (Fig. 2C). However, in our study, we found a nucleosome located at nucleosome-free regions. These nucleosomes were also found in other limited digestion studies (27Chen K. Wilson M.A. Hirsch C. Watson A.

H2A.Z facilitates access of active and repressive complexes to chromatin in embryonic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 12: 180-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The observation of these nucleosomes indicates that these nucleosomes are most accessible and can be further digested with higher MNase concentrations. To investigate the relationship of TSS nucleosome occupancy and transcription, we clustered the gene promoters into four groups on the basis of the gene expression level and examined the nucleosome profile in each group. Nucleosomes were well positioned at highest expressed genes (Fig. 2D), whereas nucleosomes were not positioned around TSSs of the lowest expressed genes (Fig. 2G). In second and third quantile-expressed genes, nucleosomes became less organized (Fig. 2, E and F), suggesting a correlation between nucleosome phrasing at TSS and gene expression. When comparing the nucleosome occupancy at WT and KO TSS, we observed an overall nucleosome occupancy increase in BAF250a KO ES cells across TSS regions (Fig. 2C) but not other regions. Western blot analysis of H3 protein showed that there was an increase of chromatin H3 protein after BAF250a KO (Fig. 2H), suggesting an increase of nucleosome in BAF250a KO ES cells. Moreover, the unstable nucleosomes at nucleosome-free regions were less evident in BAF250a KO ES cells (Fig. 2C), suggesting that BAF250a may have an important function in stabilizing these nucleosomes. Finally, we found that the nucleosome occupancy increase became less pronounced when gene expression decreased (Fig. 2, D–G), suggesting that BAF250a-regulated nucleosome density is positively correlated with gene expression in general. To test how BAF250a-regulated nucleosome changes correlate with promoter chromatin status, we compared the nucleosome profiles at promoters associated with H3K4me3 alone, both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, H3K27me3 alone, and neither H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 (none) (30Mikkelsen T.S.

Genome-wide maps of chromatin state in pluripotent and lineage-committed cells.Nature. 2007; 448: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (3235) Google Scholar) in WT and BAF250a-inducible KO cells. Similar to high expression gene promoters, we observed well positioned nucleosomes at H3K4me3 promoters, whereas only +1 nucleosomes were positioned in H3K27me3 promoters and promoters with no histone modifications (Fig. 3, A–D). Notably, the bivalent promoters exhibited relatively good nucleosome phrasing (Fig. 3B), although these genes were silenced. These observations suggested that the open chromatin structure characterized by well positioned nucleosomes at bivalent promoters may be related to rapid activation of these genes during differentiation. Moreover, the increase of nucleosome occupancy in BAF250a KO ES cells was prominent in promoters associated with H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 but not in the no histone modification promoters. These results suggest that BAF250a-mediated nucleosome remodeling may contribute to the open chromatin structure at promoters associated with histone modifications in ES cells. The changing of nucleosome occupancy in BAF250a KO ES cells may lead to disruption of deposition of histone modifications and, therefore, poised chromatin signatures. To address this possibility, we examined the global modification of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 by ChIP-seq. We found that H3K4me3 did not show significant changes at TSS regions (Fig. 4A), whereas a prominent reduction of H3K27me3 binding was found at TSS in BAF250a KO ES cells (Fig. 4B). Reduction of H3K27me3 also led to a loss of bivalent promoters in BAF250a KO ES cells (Fig. 4C), indicating that the poised chromatin structure was affected upon BAF250a deletion. However, loss of BAF250a did not lead to a decrease of H3K27me3 at all genes. The H3K27me3 level decreased at the up-regulated genes, whereas it remained unchanged in down-regulated genes (Fig. 4, D and E). For example, there was an H3K27me3 reduction at Hoxb gene clusters and several developmental genes such as Nkx2.5 and Meis1, but the Fabp3 promoter showed an increased H3K27me3 level in BAF250a KO ES cells (Fig. 4, F–I). Changes in H3K27me3 prompted us to examine the recruitment of the PRC complex. We performed a genome-wide ChIP-seq assay using antibodies against Suz12, a core component of PRC2 complex. Suz12 binding was reduced at Hoxb gene regions and developmental genes such as Nkx2.5 and Meis1 (Fig. 4, F–H). Notably, Suz12 binding was increased at H3K27me3-elevated regions such as Fabp3 (Fig. 4I), suggesting a possible regulation of BAF250a on H3K27me3 through modulation of Suz12 binding. Together, these results showed that BAF250a functioned synergistically with PcG proteins and contributed to a repressive role of esBAF in ES cells. To identify the underlying molecular mechanism, we first examined the effect of BAF250a deletion on BAF complex assembly by coimmunoprecipitation. We found that the interaction of Brg1 with other core BAF subunits, such as BAF155, was not affected, whereas the interaction of Brg1 with BAF60a, BAF57, and BAF53a was diminished, and the interaction of BAF47 with Brg1 was almost abolished (Fig. 5A). Because components of the BAF complex contribute to the specificity of the BAF complex, these results indicate that Brg1 recruitment may be affected in BAF250a KO ES cells. To further examine this hypothesis, we performed ChIP-seq analyses against the catalytic subunit of esBAF Brg1 to study the possible change of Brg1 occupancy. We knocked in a V5 tag to the C terminus of Brg1 that allowed us to successfully study genome-wide Brg1 binding. Subsequently, we examined whether Brg1 was involved in the process of modulation of nucleosome density in BAF250a KO ES cells. We found that Brg1 was enriched in the nucleosome regions compared with random regions (Fig. 5B). In addition, Brg1 occupancy was increased in regions that exhibited elevated nucleosome density in BAF250a KO ES cells, whereas there was no increase of Brg1 occupancy in regions with a reduced density of nucleosomes (Fig. 5, C and D). We found that Brg1 bound to promoter regions and was positively correlated with gene expression (Fig. 5E), which is consistent with what has been described previously (11Ho L. Jothi R. Ronan J.L. Cui K. Zhao K. Crabtree G.R. An embryonic stem cell chromatin remodeling complex, esBAF, is an essential component of the core pluripotency transcriptional network.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 5187-5191Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Increased binding of Brg1 in BAF250a KO cells was less profound in low expression genes (Fig. 5F). These data suggest that BAF250a may be required for proper recruitment of Brg1 to poised and active genes to maintain proper nucleosome configuration for gene expression in ES cells. To determine how BAF250a regulates H3K27me3 density in ES cells, we analyzed the nucleosomes occupancy and Brg1 binding to target loci of Suz12, a core component in PRC2. There was pronounced nucleosome occupancy increase at Suz12 binding sites (Fig. 5G), accompanied by elevated Brg1 binding in BAF250a KO ES cells (Fig. 5H). For example, we found that Brg1 binding was increased at the Hox cluster region with decreased H3K27me3 modification. Consistent with decreased H3K27me3, Suz12 binding was reduced in the HoxB cluster region (Fig. 4H). Previous studies have shown that Suz12 binds to low nucleosome occupancy regions during ES cell differentiation to regulate H3K27me3 modifications (31Woo C.J. Kharchenko P.V. Daheron L. Park P.J. Kingston R.E. A region of the human HOXD cluster that confers polycomb-group responsiveness.Cell. 2010; 140: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 32Woo C.J. Kharchenko P.V. Daheron L. Park P.J. Kingston R.E. Variable requirements for DNA-binding proteins at polycomb-dependent repressive regions in human HOX clusters.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2013; 33: 3274-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore it is likely that the nucleosome occupancy increase in BAF250a KO ES cells led to lower binding of Suz12. Collectively, BAF250a deletion resulted in elevated Brg1 binding at Suz12 binding regions and a subsequent nucleosome occupancy increase. The nucleosome occupancy increase also contributed to reduced Suz12 binding and abnormal modification of H3K27me3 in BAF250a KO ES cells (Fig. 5I). The H3K27me3 defects in ES cells caused by the nucleosome occupancy increase may also explain the inefficient shutdown of pluripotent genes during ES cell differentiation (Fig. 1B). In this study, we demonstrate that BAF250a, a regulatory component of esBAF, controls key aspects of chromatin structure at the level of nucleosome position and modification. Deletion of BAF250a in ES cells significantly decreased the potential of ES cells to contribute to differentiated lineages, leading us to propose that the ability of esBAF to appropriately modify nucleosomes is critical to differentiation. We found that BAF250a differentially regulates nucleosome structure in promoters associated with different gene expression levels and histone modifications. Importantly, our results show that BAF250a mediates the level of Brg1 binding, particularly at BAF-repressed genes, to control proper nucleosome occupancy at ES cells. Moreover, BAF250a deletion led to reduced Suz12 recruitment and decreased H3K27me3 modifications at developmental genes in ES cells. Collectively, these epigenetic disruptions may cause incomplete shutdown of pluripotent genes and aberrant expression of developmental genes and contribute to the differentiation defects of BAF250a KO ES cells. Our results show that BAF250a-mediated promoter nucleosome occupancy increase at promoters correlates with histone marks H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, suggesting a potential role for nucleosome positioning in the poised chromatin signature. In this study, we found that nucleosomes are well positioned in the promoters of highly expressed genes and that they become disorganized in the promoters of lower expressed genes, suggesting that a well positioned nucleosome is a feature of open chromatin. Moreover, we found that nucleosomes are well organized in H3K4me3 promoters and less organized in bivalent H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 promoters and that only +1 nucleosomes are positioned at promoters decorated with H3K27me3 and promoters that lacked these marks. Noticeably, there is a more prominent nucleosome occupancy increase in promoters associated with either H3K3me4 alone or both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modifications. Specifically, the binding level of Brg1 descends from H3K4me3 promoters, bivalent promoters, H3K27me3 promoters, and promoters lacking these histone modifications. Importantly, Brg1 occupancy increases in regions with elevated nucleosome occupancy in BAF250a KO ES cells. These results suggest that BAF250a directs esBAF to remodel the nucleosome structure into a poised chromatin configuration at poised genes in ES cells. Furthermore, our results show that BAF250a not only mediates nucleosome density on poised gene promoters but also regulates bivalent marks in ES cells. We found that global H3K27me3 decreased in BAF250a KO ES cells. In particular, we observed a decreased H3K27me3 level in BAF250a-repressed genes but no significant change of H3K27me3 in BAF250a-activated genes. The alteration of H3K27me3 levels may indicate a specific repressive role of BAF250a in ES cells. Although Brg1 deletion does not result in global H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 changes, H3K27me3 density decreased in Brg1-repressed genes and increased in Brg1-activated genes in Brg1 KO ES cells (33Ho L. Miller E.L. Ronan J.L. Ho W.Q. Jothi R. Crabtree G.R. esBAF facilitates pluripotency by conditioning the genome for LIF/STAT3 signalling and by regulating polycomb function.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These differences in histone modification changes in BAF250a KO and Brg1 KO ES cells reflect distinct functions exercised by esBAF components on histone modification regulations. Therefore, it seems that the BAF250a-containing esBAF complex has a specific function in gene repression via regulating the H3K27me3 modification in ES cells. A comparison of our data to a study in mouse embryonic fibroblasts suggests that BAF complexes regulate nucleosomes in a cell type-specific manner. BAF complexes have different composition assemblies in different cell type. Therefore, BAF complexes may achieve a cell-specific function by different assemblies of the BAF complex (9Wu J.I. Lessard J. Crabtree G.R. Understanding the words of chromatin regulation.Cell. 2009; 136: 200-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Indeed, deletion of Brg1 or BAF47 in mouse embryonic fibroblast leads to an overall nucleosome occupancy decrease at TSS regions (34Tolstorukov M.Y. Sansam C.G. Lu P. Koellhoffer E.C. Helming K.C. Alver B.H. Tillman E.J. Evans J.A. Wilson B.G. Park P.J. Roberts C.W. Swi/Snf chromatin remodeling/tumor suppressor complex establishes nucleosome occupancy at target promoters.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 10165-10170Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), a finding that differs from the nucleosome increase we observed in BAF250a KO ES cells. These results likely reflect the distinct functions of BAF complexes in different cell types. It has been shown that ES cells have less heterochromatin than differentiated cells (3Mattout A. Meshorer E. Chromatin plasticity and genome organization in pluripotent embryonic stem cells.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2010; 22: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). ES cells have more abundant active histone modifications such as H3K4me3 and more active transcription with lower nucleosome occupancy. The nucleosome occupancy increase in BAF250a KO ES cells may indicate that the KO ES cell chromatin is transitioning into a more differentiated status. The tendency to differentiation observed in prolonged culture of BAF250a KO ES cells also suggests that esBAF is essential for ES cell-specific chromatin structure maintenance. In contrast, BAF mutations in somatic cells may lead to more open chromatin structure changes. Indeed, many of these mutations cause aberrant cell growth and cancer (35Kadoch C. Hargreaves D.C. Hodges C. Elias L. Ho L. Ranish J. Crabtree G.R. Proteomic and bioinformatic analysis of mammalian SWI/SNF complexes identifies extensive roles in human malignancy.Nat. Genet. 2013; 45: 592-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Therefore, a BAF-mediated, cell type-specific nucleosome structure is essential for proper cell function. In summary, our results show that BAF250a is a key player in regulating nucleosome occupancy and bivalent histone modifications in ES cells. The dynamic nucleosome and histone modifications mediated by BAF250a ensure that ES cells respond to differentiation signals in a timely manner. Ablation of BAF250a leads to altered nucleosome structures that severely hamper the plasticity of ES cell chromatin, which, in turn, contributes to a general delay in the expression of developmental genes and continued expression of pluripotent genes during differentiation. The aberrant expression of both developmental and pluripotent genes by BAF250a ablation causes the early germ layer developmental defects in vivo and various lineage differentiation defects in EB-based differentiation in vitro. Our studies further indicate that BAF250a is required for proper Brg1 recruitment and also regulates Suz12 recruitment at nucleosome occupancy-increased regions, indicating an intricate role of BAF250a in regulating esBAF and PRC activities. Future studies of the BAF complex and its involvement in high-order chromatin structures will elucidate the unique role of the esBAF chromatin remodeling complex in ES cell differentiation and development.

Sequencing generated over 1.2 billion short reads with an average length of 101 nt. De novo transcriptome assembly yielded 47,788 and 47,840 unigenes in the red and green forms of perilla plants, respectively. Comparison of the assembled unigenes and existing perilla cDNA sequences showed highly reliable alignment. All unigenes were annotated with gene ontology (GO) and Enzyme Commission numbers and entered into the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. We identified 68 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in red and green forms of perilla. GO enrichment analysis of the DEGs showed that genes involved in the anthocyanin metabolic process were enriched. Differential expression analysis revealed that the transcript level of anthocyanin biosynthetic unigenes encoding flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase, and anthocyanidin synthase was significantly higher in red perilla, while the transcript level of unigenes encoding limonene synthase was significantly higher in green perilla.

They are involved in pain sensation, the expression of fear, and in neurodegeneration after ischemic stroke. Our study investigates the role of extracellular subunit interactions in ASIC1a function. We identified two regions involved in critical intersubunit interactions. First, formation of an engineered disulfide bond between the palm and thumb domains leads to partial channel closure. Second, linking Glu-235 of a finger loop to either one of two different residues of the knuckle of a neighboring subunit opens the channel at physiological pH or disrupts its activity.

Voltage-clamp fluorometry experiments indicate that both the finger loop and the knuckle move away from the β-ball residue Trp-233 during acidification and subsequent desensitization.

Structure of the acid-sensing ion channel 1 in complex with the gating modifier Psalmotoxin 1.Nat. Commun. 2012; 3: 936Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) underlines the functional importance of subunit interactions. A recent study suggested that the dynamic formation of intersubunit disulfide bonds between intracellular C-terminal Cys residues may regulate ASIC activity as a function of the redox state (15Zha X.M. Wang R. Collier D.M. Snyder P.M. Wemmie J.A. Welsh M.J. Oxidant regulated inter-subunit disulfide bond formation between ASIC1a subunits.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 3573-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, no molecular information is available on the interactions between extracellular domains of the ASIC subunits. In the present study we identified a palm-thumb and two finger loop-knuckle residue pairs predicted to form intersubunit hydrogen bonds. We show that engineered disulfide bonds between these residues impede channel opening in the case of the palm-thumb pair and promote either the open or a non-conducting state in the case of the two finger loop-knuckle pairs. These findings reveal unexpected roles of the geometries of the palm-thumb and knuckle-finger interactions in the control of the functional state of the ASIC pore. The human ASIC1a cDNA (16García-Añoveros J. Derfler B. Neville-Golden J. Hyman B.T. Corey D.P.

Wild type (WT) and mutants used in all experiments except voltage-clamp fluorometry (VCF) experiments had a hemagglutinin (HA) tag inserted in the extracellular loop between residues Phe-147 and Lys-148 (17Chen X. Gründer S. Permeating protons contribute to tachyphylaxis of the acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC) 1a.J. Physiol. 2007; 579: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Point mutations were introduced by QuikChange (Stratagene) and verified by sequencing (Synergene Biotech, Zurich). In vitro transcription was performed using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 kit (Life Technologies, Zug, Switzerland). All experimental procedures on Xenopus laevis were carried out in accordance with the Swiss federal law on animal welfare and had been approved by the committee on animal experimentation of the Canton de Vaud. Oocytes from stage V and VI from female X. laevis were treated with collagenase, defolliculated, isolated as described previously (18Vukicevic M. Weder G. Boillat A. Boesch A. Kellenberger S. Trypsin cleaves acid-sensing ion channel 1a in a domain that is critical for channel gating.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 714-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and injected with 50–100 nl of cRNA (0.4–0.6 μg/μl for mutants and 0.03 μg/μl for WT). The oocytes were kept in modified Barth's saline (MBS) composed of 85 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.33 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 4.08 mm NaOH. Where indicated, oocytes were maintained in MBS containing 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) to prevent oxidation. Oocytes used for VCF experiments were incubated after RNA injection for 1 h with 10 mm 3-maleimido-propionic acid (Bachem) dissolved in MBS solution to modify the free Cys residues of proteins present on the oocyte surface. Recording solutions contained 110 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (MES for pH ≤ 6.8). 10 mm stock solutions of AlexaFluor 488 C-5 maleimide (Life Technologies, Zug, Switzerland) and CF 488A maleimide (Biotium, Basel, Switzerland) were prepared in DMSO. All oxidation/reduction treatments except where explicitly indicated were done as follows. Oocytes were perfused with recording solution at physiological, pH 7.4, and ASICs were initially activated twice with an acidic pH at an interval of 1 min. Then the oxidative agent copper-o-phenanthroline complex (150 μm CuSO4, 450 μm phenanthroline) was applied for 3 min followed by a 3-min application of recording solution supplemented with 5 mm EGTA and 2 mm MgCl2 and a 2-min wash with normal recording solution, both at pH 7.4. The reducing agent TCEP was applied in electrophysiological experiments at 1 mm for 3 min followed by a 2-min wash with recording solution. cRNA (20 ng per oocyte) coding for WT ASIC1a and different simple and double cysteine mutants (carrying an extracellular HA tag as described above) was injected into Xenopus oocytes. 48 h after injection, the surface expression was measured as described (17Chen X. Gründer S. Permeating protons contribute to tachyphylaxis of the acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC) 1a.J. Physiol. 2007; 579: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse anti-HA antibody (clone HA-7; 0.5 μg/ml; Sigma) and peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (2 μg/ml; Amersham Biosciences) were used to label the surface-expressed HA-tagged ASIC1a constructs. Chemiluminescence of single oocytes was detected with a Victor 3 Multiwell Microplate Reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using SuperSignal Elisa Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo Scientific). Electrophysiological measurements were performed 1–3 days after cRNA injection. Currents were recorded with a Dagan TEV-200 amplifier (Minneapolis, MN) equipped with two bath electrodes at a holding potential of −60 mV (−40 mV in VCF experiments). Oocytes were placed in a recording chamber and perfused by gravity at a rate of 10–12 ml/min. To determine the activation and steady-state desensitization (SSD) pH dependence, oocytes were exposed for 55 s to the conditioning pH solution, and ASICs were activated every min by a 5-s acidification. VCF measurements were carried out as described previously (14Bonifacio G. Lelli C.I. Kellenberger S. Protonation controls ASIC1a activity via coordinated movements in multiple domains.J. Gen. Physiol. 2014; 143: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were labeled in the dark with 5 μm AlexaFluor 488 C-5 maleimide or CF 488 maleimide at 19 °C for 15 min. The VCF setup was equipped with an Intensilight lamp (C-HGFI, Nikon). The signal emitted by the labeled oocyte was detected with a 40× oil-immersion objective (CFI Plan Fluor, Nikon) and measured by a photodiode (S1336–18BQ, Hamamatsu Photonics). Changes in fluorescence intensity (ΔF) were normalized to the total fluorescence intensity (determined with a scalable offset device) as ΔF/F. The signal was filtered and amplified by a low pass eight-pole Bessel filter (LPF-8, Warner Instruments) at 40 Hz. Each Cys mutant used for VCF was initially tested with each of the two fluorophores in two different protocols, acidification to pH 6 from a conditioning pH of either pH 7.4, at which the channels are closed and acidification produced a current (closed-open protocol), and from a conditioning pH at which the channels were desensitized (usually pH 6.7), where acidification did not induce a current (desensitized-open protocol). We considered fluorescence changes (ΔF) measured in the desensitized-open protocol as potential artifacts due to intrinsic pH dependence of the fluorophore in its specific environment (14Bonifacio G. Lelli C.I. Kellenberger S. Protonation controls ASIC1a activity via coordinated movements in multiple domains.J. Gen. Physiol. 2014; 143: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and used the fluorophore for which the ratio of the desensitized-open/closed-open ΔF/F was lower. AlexaFluor 488 was used for E235C and all derived double mutants, whereas CF488A was used for K388C, Y389C, and K392C and all derived double mutants. Mutants in which the ratio of the desensitized-open/closed-open ΔF was >0.2 were not used for analysis. In the measuring chamber used to carry out the VCF experiments, fluorescence is measured on a surface of ∼0.5-mm diameter (corresponding to ∼20% of the oocyte surface), whereas the current is measured on the entire oocyte surface. The kinetics of perfusion change in the VCF measuring chamber that we used for these experiments have previously been measured (14Bonifacio G. Lelli C.I. Kellenberger S. Protonation controls ASIC1a activity via coordinated movements in multiple domains.J. Gen. Physiol. 2014; 143: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This test showed that the delay in appearance of the new solution, caused by the dead volume of the system, was 685 ± 27 ms for the ΔF and 597 ± 24 ms for the current signal; thus there is a difference of <100 ms. The rise time of solution change was 346 ± 13 ms for the ΔF and 301 ± 19 ms for the current signal (14Bonifacio G. Lelli C.I. Kellenberger S. Protonation controls ASIC1a activity via coordinated movements in multiple domains.J. Gen. Physiol. 2014; 143: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Ion selectivity of ASIC1a was investigated by recording the current-voltage relationship using either Na+- or K+-containing recording solutions (110 mm NaCl or 110 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (or 10 mm MES for pH ≤ 6.8)). The pH was adjusted using NaOH, except for solutions containing KCl, whose pH was adjusted with KOH. A ramp protocol was used to determine the reversal potential of the ASIC leak and peak current. From a holding potential of −60 mV, oocytes were held during 500 ms at −120 mV followed by a voltage ramp from −120 to +60 mV for the duration of 90 ms. This ramp protocol was run at pH 7.4 (baseline and leak current) and at the peak of the pH5-induced current to determine the peak current I-V relationship. Electrophysiological measurements on oocytes were recorded and analyzed using pClamp 9.2 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), or ChartMaster (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany; for VCF experiments). The pH of half-maximal activation (pH50) was determined by fitting normalized activation curves to the Hill equation, I = Imax/(1 + (10−pH50/10−pH)nH), where Imax is the maximal current amplitude, pH50 is the value at which the current amplitude is half-maximal, and nH is the Hill coefficient (Kaleidagraph 4.0, Synergy Software, Reading, PA). SSD curves were fitted by an analogous equation. Na+/K+ permeability ratios were calculated from the difference in reversal potential (Erev) obtained in the presence of extracellular Na+ or K+ solution according to the equation ΔErev = Erev, Na − Erev, K = (RT/zF)·ln(PNa·[Na]o/PK·[K]o), where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in K, z is the valence of the ion, F is the Faraday constant, PNa and PK are the relative permeabilities of Na+ and K+, respectively, and [Na]o and [K]o are the extracellular concentrations of these ions (19Hille B.

A sequence alignment of human ASIC1a and chicken ASIC1 is shown in Fig. 1. Statistical analysis were performed using software Prism version 6.00 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). The distribution of the experimental population was verified with the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. For Gaussian distributions, parametric tests were performed (one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons test or unpaired t test with Welch's correction for comparison of two conditions). For distributions that were not Gaussian, non-parametric tests were used (Kruskal-Wallis followed by Dunn's multiple comparisons test or Mann-Whitney test for two conditions). All data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of independent experiments. We considered that residue pairs forming extracellular intersubunit hydrogen bonds in ASIC1a likely participate in functionally important interactions between ASIC subunits.

Double Cys mutations between these pairs of residues were made in human ASIC1a (containing an HA tag in the finger domain (17Chen X. Gründer S. Permeating protons contribute to tachyphylaxis of the acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC) 1a.J. Physiol. 2007; 579: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)) to study the functional relevance of these interactions. Among them, combined mutations of the pairs G215C (β-ball)/Q260C (β-ball) and R175C (palm)/K356C (thumb) led to loss of current. We analyzed the cell surface expression of Cys double mutants by using an approach that consists of binding of a primary antibody to an extracellular HA tag on ASIC1a at the surface of intact oocytes. After binding of a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the addition of a substrate, chemiluminescence is measured on single, intact oocytes (21Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N.

Results are expressed as relative light units per second and normalized to the WT signal for presentation (Fig. 2C). The surface expression signal of oocytes expressing the HA-tagged ASIC1a WT and the mutant G260C was significantly higher than that of non-injected or non-tagged ASIC1a-expressing oocytes. In contrast, G215C and the double mutants R175C/K356C and G215C/Q260C did not show any significant increase in cell surface expression relative to the negative controls despite a tendency of higher values of the G215C/Q260C double mutant (Fig. 2C). The residue Glu-355 is located at the lower end of the thumb helix α5, and Arg-175 is part of a palm loop adjacent to β strand β3 (Fig. 2B). The “acidic pocket,” to which Glu-355 belongs, has been implicated in ASIC activation (6Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E.

Chem. 2009; 284: 4689-4694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The side chain of Arg-175 of the palm is predicted to form a hydrogen bond with the backbone of Glu-355 (Fig. 2B). When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the R175C/E355C double mutant was functional and its pH dependence of activation and SSD (corresponding to the transition from the closed to the desensitized state) was not different from that of WT (Fig. 2D, p = 0.4 and p = 0.06, respectively, n = 3–4). To test whether the interaction between Arg-175 and Glu-355 affects ASIC function, oocytes expressing the mutant R175C/E355C were exposed to the oxidant copper phenanthroline (CuPhe, 3 min, pH 7.4) that promotes disulfide bond formation. Application of EGTA-containing and normal recording solutions followed the exposure to CuPhe to remove any free copper (see “Experimental Procedures”). Oxidation decreased the pH 5-induced peak current amplitude by 53 ± 4%, n = 11 (Fig. 2E). This effect was not spontaneously reversible, as even after 10 min of washout the inhibition persisted (hatched bar in Fig. 2E). The current decrease of the R175C/E355C double mutant was partially reversed by exposure to the reducing agent TCEP (1 mm, 3 min; Fig. 2E). Together with the fact that no current decrease upon exposure to the oxidant was observed in WT ASIC1a and the single mutants, this strongly suggests that the observed current decrease is due to disulfide bond formation between R175C and E355C. The absence of effects in the controls is consistent with previous studies showing that the effects of redox reagents on WT A"
https://openalex.org/W1501932881,"α-Catenin plays a crucial role in cadherin-mediated adhesion by binding to β-catenin, F-actin, and vinculin, and its dysfunction is linked to a variety of cancers and developmental disorders. As a mechanotransducer in the cadherin complex at intercellular adhesions, mechanical and force-sensing properties of α-catenin are critical to its proper function. Biochemical data suggest that α-catenin adopts an autoinhibitory conformation, in the absence of junctional tension, and biophysical studies have shown that α-catenin is activated in a tension-dependent manner that in turn results in the recruitment of vinculin to strengthen the cadherin complex/F-actin linkage. However, the molecular switch mechanism from autoinhibited to the activated state remains unknown for α-catenin. Here, based on the results of an aggregate of 3 μs of molecular dynamics simulations, we have identified a dynamic salt-bridge network within the core M region of α-catenin that may be the structural determinant of the stability of the autoinhibitory conformation. According to our constant-force steered molecular dynamics simulations, the reorientation of the MII/MIII subdomains under force may constitute an initial step along the transition pathway. The simulations also suggest that the vinculin-binding domain (subdomain MI) is intrinsically much less stable than the other two subdomains in the M region (MII and MIII). Our findings reveal several key insights toward a complete understanding of the multistaged, force-induced conformational transition of α-catenin to the activated conformation."

https://openalex.org/W2035381219,"LKB1 (liver kinase B1) plays important roles in tumor suppression, energy metabolism, and, recently, in innate immune responses. However, how LKB1 is regulated under physiological or pathological conditions is still unclear. Here, we report that LKB1 protein (but not mRNA) was decreased in both LPS-treated RAW 264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages isolated from LPS-challenged mice. Additional LPS treatment promoted protein ubiquitination and degradation of LKB1. Pharmacological inhibition or gene silencing of inducible NOS abrogated LPS-induced LKB1 degradation, whereas exposure of RAW 264.7 cells to S-nitroso-l-glutathione, a NO donor, triggered LKB1 S-nitrosylation. Consistently, mutation of one cysteine (C430S) in LKB1 prevented LPS-induced S-nitrosylation, ubiquitination, and degradation. Moreover, S-nitrosylation and ubiquitination of LKB1 were confirmed in macrophages from LPS-challenged mice in vivo. Co-administration of the inducible NOS inhibitor S-methylisothiourea or the proteasome inhibitor MG132 prevented LPS-induced LKB1 degradation and improved the survival rate. Finally, mice lacking LKB1 in macrophages had significantly lower survival rates in response to LPS challenge compared with wild-type mice. Thus, we concluded that LKB1 is degraded by LPS treatment via S-nitrosylation-dependent proteasome pathways, and this had a protective role in LPS-induced septic shock."

By cross comparison of microarray gene lists on human neurofibroma-initiating cells and developed neurofibroma Schwann cells (SCs) we identified RUNX1 overexpression in human neurofibroma initiation cells, suggesting RUNX1 might relate to neurofibroma formation. Immunostaining confirmed RUNX1 protein overexpression in human plexiform neurofibromas. Runx1 overexpression was confirmed in mouse Schwann cell progenitors (SCPs) and mouse neurofibromas at the messenger RNA and protein levels. Genetic inhibition of Runx1 expression by small hairpin RNA or pharmacological inhibition of Runx1 function by a Runx1/Cbfβ interaction inhibitor, Ro5-3335, decreased mouse neurofibroma sphere number in vitro. Targeted genetic deletion of Runx1 in SCs and SCPs delayed mouse neurofibroma formation in vivo. Mechanistically, loss of Nf1 increased embryonic day 12.5 Runx1(+)/Blbp(+) progenitors that enable tumor formation. These results suggest that Runx1 has an important role in Nf1 neurofibroma initiation, and inhibition of RUNX1 function might provide a novel potential therapeutic treatment strategy for neurofibroma patients."

We hypothesized that complete peroxisomal oxidation of azelate could form peroxisomal malonyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA. Alternatively, partial peroxidation of azelate would yield acetyl-CoA + a shorter odd-chain dicarboxylate that would complete its degradation in mitochondria. The catabolism of glutarate is mitochondrial (14Rothstein M. Miller L.L. The metabolism of glutaric acid-1, 5-C14: I. in normal and phlorhizinized rats.J. Biol.

The goal of the present study was to characterize the catabolism of azelate, contrasting it with the catabolism of DODA and glutarate. Our strategy was to use a combination of metabolomics and fully 13C-labeled n-dicarboxylates so that the labeling patterns of CoA esters and of other compounds would reflect mitochondrial and/or peroxisomal oxidation of the substrates (15Zhang G.F.

The data presented below support the compartmentation of the catabolism of DODA, azelate, and glutarate outlined in Scheme 1.

Standards of [1-13C]acetyl-CoA and [13C2]acetyl-CoA were prepared by reacting free CoA with [1,1′-13C2]acetic anhydride or [13C4]acetic anhydride (20Dils R. Carey E.M.

Sprague-Dawley male rats were kept on standard rodent chow ad libitum for 8–12 days. Isolated livers from overnight fasted rats were perfused (21Brunengraber H. Boutry M. Lowenstein J.M.

Other livers were perfused with non-recirculating albumin-free buffer containing 0 to 0.6 mm fully 13C-labeled dicarboxylate for 30 min. One liver was perfused with 2 mm [13C2]acetate as a control where CAC intermediates are labeled only from M2 acetyl-CoA. At the end of the perfusions, livers were quick frozen and kept in liquid nitrogen until analysis. To assay the fatty acids and citric acid cycle intermediates, 200 mg of powdered frozen liver was homogenized in 2 ml of methanol. Protein was precipitated by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 20 min. Supernatants were dried under nitrogen gas and derivatized with 100 μl of BSTFA at 70 °C for 1 h. The samples were analyzed on Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph coupled to Agilent 5973 mass spectrometer operated in electron impact ionization (EI) mode. The GC column was Agilent VF-5MS capillary column (60 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). The inlet and transfer line temperatures were set at 290 and 300 °C, respectively. The EI source and mass analyzer temperatures were 230 and 150 °C. The temperature gradient was: start at 80 °C, increase to 300 °C at the rate of 5 °C/min, and hold for 10 min.

In livers perfused with recirculating buffer containing M12 DODA, M9 azelate, or M5 glutarate, we assayed the M2 labeling of total acetyl-CoA, acetylcarnitine, the acetyl moiety of citrate, and the C-1 + 2 moiety of BHB (Fig. 1A) 4Data are presented as mean percentages ± S.D. (n = 5 for livers perfused with M12 DODA, M9 azelate, or M5 glutarate; n = 1 for M2 acetate (see text)). . The acetyl moiety of citrate and the C-1 + 2 moiety of BHB are proxies of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA (16Bian F. Kasumov T. Thomas K.R. Jobbins K.A. David F. Minkler P.E. Hoppel C.L. Brunengraber H. Peroxisomal and mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids in the heart, assessed from the 13C labeling of malonyl-CoA and the acetyl moiety of citrate.J. Biol.

Chem. 2009; 284: 33521-33534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In all cases, the acetyl moiety of citrate and the C-1 + 2 moiety of BHB were equally M2 labeled, as expected. However, in livers perfused with M12 DODA or M9 azelate, the M2 labeling of total acetyl-CoA was significantly higher than those of the acetyl moiety of citrate and the C-1 + 2 moiety of BHB. This was not the case in livers perfused with M5 glutarate where the three labeling were about equal. The data reflect the partial peroxisomal β-oxidation of M12 DODA and M9 azelate (Scheme 1), based on the following rationale. The enrichment of acetyl-CoA generated in mitochondria from a fully 13C-labeled substrate becomes diluted by unlabeled acetyl-CoA derived from unlabeled endogenous and exogenous substrates (glucose, glycogen, and fatty acids). Thus the M2 enrichment of the acetyl moiety of citrate reflects the contribution of the labeled substrate to energy metabolism. In contrast, the M2 labeling of acetyl-CoA generated in peroxisomes (and transferred to the cytosol) can be much higher than that of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA because it is less diluted by unlabeled acetyl-CoA generated extra mitochondrially (18Leighton F. Bergseth S. Rørtveit T. Christiansen E.N. Bremer J. Free acetate production by rat hepatocytes during peroxisomal fatty acid and dicarboxylic acid oxidation.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10347-10350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, although extra-mitochondrial acetyl-CoA accounts for a small fraction of total liver acetyl-CoA, it can substantially increase the average labeling of total liver acetyl-CoA. We observed a similar process in livers and hearts perfused with labeled fatty acids, which are partially degraded in peroxisomes ([1-13C]octanoate, [3-13C]octanoate, [1-13C]docosanoate, and [1,2,3,4-13C4]docosanoate) (20Dils R.

Cell Cardiol. 2006; 41: 868-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), we showed that labeling of substrates was acetate > acetylcarnitine > acetyl moiety of citrate. Thus, the labeling of acetylcarnitine reflects the labeling of peroxisomal acetyl-CoA, albeit to a lower degree than the labeling of acetate. Thus, our data indicate that DODA and azelate are partially degraded in peroxisomes, whereas glutarate is not degraded in peroxisomes to a detectable degree (Scheme 1). In livers perfused with non-recirculating buffer containing increasing concentrations of M12 DODA or M9 azelate, the M2 labeling of total acetyl-CoA was greater than that of the acetyl moiety of citrate (Fig. 2). This was not the case in the presence of M5 glutarate. The M2 labeling ratio (acetyl-CoA)/(acetyl moiety of citrate) was 4–6 with M12 DODA, 1.5 to 2 with M9 azelate, and about 1.0 with M5 glutarate. This is further support for the partial oxidation of DODA and azelate in peroxisomes. A proxy of the labeling of liver peroxisomal acetyl-CoA is the labeling of free acetate released by livers perfused with non-recirculating buffer (18Leighton F. Bergseth S. Rørtveit T. Christiansen E.N. Bremer J. Free acetate production by rat hepatocytes during peroxisomal fatty acid and dicarboxylic acid oxidation.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10347-10350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is because there are very active acetyl-CoA hydrolases in peroxisomes (27Hunt M.C. Tillander V. Alexson S.E. Regulation of peroxisomal lipid metabolism: the role of acyl-CoA and coenzyme A metabolizing enzymes.Biochimie. 2014; 98: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The acetate proxy is useful only in non-recirculating perfusions where the acetate is released from the liver (rather than metabolized in the liver). Fig. 2D shows that, in livers perfused with M12 DODA or M9 azelate, the enrichment of released acetate is greater than the enrichment of the acetyl moiety of citrate. In contrast, in livers perfused with M5 glutarate, the enrichment of released acetate is much lower than that of the acetyl moiety of citrate. The release of low-labeled acetate reflects probably the release of unlabeled acetate from (i) the peroxisomal β-oxidation of unlabeled peroxisomal substrates, plus (ii) a low rate of acetyl-CoA to acetate cycling in mitochondria and cytosol (28Crabtree B. Gordon M.J. Christie S.L. Measurement of the rates of acetyl-CoA hydrolysis and synthesis from acetate in rat hepatocytes and the role of these fluxes in substrate cycling.Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 29Crabtree B. Souter M.J. Anderson S.E. Evidence that the production of acetate in rat hepatocytes is a predominantly cytoplasmic process.Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 673-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The following calculations support a substantial contribution of peroxisomes to the catabolism of DODA and azelate. If one were to assume that all acetyl-CoA derived from DODA, azelate, and glutarate are generated in mitochondria, one could estimate the total mitochondrial acetyl-CoA turnover in the livers, using (i) the uptake of the dicarboxylates (0.075 ± 0.029, 0.097 ± 0.02, and 0.081 ± 0.047 μmol min−1 g−1, for DODA, azelate, and glutarate, respectively), (ii) the M2 enrichment of the acetyl moiety of citrate (Fig. 1A), and (iii) the total yields of acetyl groups/dicarboxylate. One would calculate turnover rates of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA at 0.94, 1.5, and 2.0 μmol min−1 g−1 in livers perfused with DODA, azelate, and glutarate, respectively. It is unlikely that the turnover of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA would be much lower in livers perfused with DODA or azelate, compared with livers perfused with glutarate. With the latter substrate, the two derived acetyls are generated in mitochondria. The lower apparent turnover of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA in livers perfused with DODA or azelate, compared with perfusions with glutarate suggests that 2 of 4 acetyls derived from DODA were lost as free acetate and did not contribute to the turnover of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA. Similarly 1 or 2 of the 3 acetyls derived from azelate would be lost as free acetate. This is compatible with current concepts of dicarboxylate metabolism starting in peroxisomes, followed by a shortened dicarboxylyl being transferred to mitochondria (Scheme 1). Fig. 1B shows that, in livers perfused with recirculating buffer, malonyl-CoA is mostly M2 labeled from M12 DODA, M9 azelate, or M5 glutarate, with a small or very small M3 component in perfusions with M12 DODA and M9 azelate. The M2 malonyl-CoA was formed from M2 acetyl-CoA derived from the catabolism of the three fully 13C-labeled dicarboxylates. In livers perfused with M12 DODA or M9 azelate, the M2 enrichment of malonyl-CoA is significantly lower than that of total acetyl-CoA (Fig. 1A), but not significantly higher than that of the acetyl moiety of citrate (Fig. 1A). Thus, in the presence of M12 DODA or M9 azelate, the pool of cytosolic acetyl-CoA used for malonyl-CoA synthesis consisted mostly of acetyl-CoA transferred from mitochondria, with a component of acetyl-CoA made in peroxisomes. In livers perfused with M5 glutarate, the M2 malonyl-CoA is not significantly different from M2 of total acetyl-CoA, or the acetyl moiety of citrate. Thus, in the presence of M5 glutarate, the pool of cytosolic acetyl-CoA used for malonyl-CoA synthesis consisted mostly of acetyl-CoA transferred from mitochondria. We had hypothesized that in livers perfused with M9 azelate or M5 glutarate, the presence of M3 malonyl-CoA would reflect the complete peroxisomal β-oxidation of part of the metabolized odd-chain dicarboxylate. In livers perfused with M9 azelate, we found a low M3 enrichment of malonyl-CoA, compatible with some degree of complete peroxisomal β-oxidation of azelate. No M3 malonyl-CoA was detected in livers perfused with M5 glutarate, as expected. The even-chain M12 DODA was not expected from M3 malonyl-CoA (but would form M4 succinyl-CoA if completely β-oxidized in peroxisomes, see below). Unexpectedly, in livers perfused with M12 DODA, malonyl-CoA had a small M3 component that was larger than in livers perfused with M9 azelate (Fig. 1B). We cannot explain this finding with current knowledge of the metabolism of peroxisomes. It is possible that a small amount of M3 malonyl-CoA was formed by the reaction of M2 acetyl-CoA with 13CO2 derived from the oxidation of M12 DODA.

It also shows for comparison the MIDs of the same metabolites from one liver perfused with M2 acetate. In the latter case, all metabolites are labeled from M2 acetyl-CoA.

When forming an abstract representation of a speaker, it is important to extract relevant features from acoustic signals that are invariant to the modulation of these signals. This study investigated the way in which individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) recognize and memorize vocal identity. The ASD group and control group performed similarly in a task when asked to choose the name of the newly-learned speaker based on his or her voice, and the ASD group outperformed the control group in a subsequent familiarity test when asked to discriminate the previously trained voices and untrained voices. These findings suggest that individuals with ASD recognized and memorized voices as well as the neurotypical individuals did, but they categorized voices in a different way: individuals with ASD categorized voices quantitatively based on the exact acoustic features, while neurotypical individuals categorized voices qualitatively based on the acoustic patterns correlated to the speakers' physical and mental properties."

Cholesterol and fatty acid absorption from the intestine is a complicated process involving specific transporters and efflux pumps, the expression of which is regulated by nuclear receptors, such as liver X receptor (LXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α (15Bonamassa B. Moschetta A. Atherosclerosis: lessons from LXR and the intestine.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2013; 24: 120-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Wahli W. Michalik L. PPARs at the crossroads of lipid signaling and inflammation.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2012; 23: 351-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). In addition, metabolism of cholesterol and fatty acids in enterocytes determines their absorption into the lymph and blood and availability to other organs. Unesterified free cholesterol is taken up into the enterocytes by the cholesterol transporter NPC1L1, which can have three fates (15Bonamassa B. Moschetta A. Atherosclerosis: lessons from LXR and the intestine.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2013; 24: 120-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Free cholesterol can be transported to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is esterified by acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 2 enzyme and then conjugated with ApoB48 to form chylomicron, which enters into the lymphatic system. Unesterified free cholesterol can be transported back to the intestinal lumen by apically located cholesterol pump ABCG5/ABCG8 heterodimer. Free cholesterol may be transported into the circulation as a constituent of HDL via ABCA1 located on the basolateral membrane of the enterocytes. When cellular oxysterols accumulate as a result of increasing concentrations of cholesterol, LXR activation, by cholesterol metabolites such as oxysterols (17Janowski B.A. Willy P.J. Devi T.R.

Important intestinal fatty acid transporters are: 1) fatty acid-binding protein, plasma membrane (FABPpm/Got2), located peripherally on the plasma membrane; 2) fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36), an integral membrane glycoprotein; and 3) fatty acid transport protein subtype 4 (FATP4/Slc27a4), an integral membrane protein (21Masson C.J.

In the intestinal lumen, triglyceride (TG) is broken down into free fatty acids by lipases. Once fatty acids enter into the enterocytes, cytoplasmic fatty acid-binding protein (FABPc) may transport them to the mitochondria for β-oxidation (22Glatz J.F. van der Vusse G.J. Cellular fatty acid-binding proteins: their function and physiological significance.Prog. Lipid Res. 1996; 35: 243-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The majority of fatty acids are re-esterified into TG and excreted into chylomicrons. In the enterocytes, PPARα promotes β-oxidation of fatty acids, thereby decreasing fatty acid absorption in the circulation (23Kimura R. Takahashi N. Goto T. Murota K. Kawada T.

The present study unravels a novel physiological function of AEG-1 in lipid homeostasis by analyzing an AEG-1 knock-out (AEG-1KO) mouse. We previously documented that AEG-1 interacts with retinoid X receptor (RXR) (25Srivastava J. Robertson C.L. Rajasekaran D. Gredler R. Siddiq A. Emdad L. Mukhopadhyay N.D. Ghosh S. Hylemon P.B.

RXR heterodimerizes with one-third of the 48 human nuclear receptor superfamily members, including LXR and PPARα (27Lefebvre P. Benomar Y. Staels B. Retinoid X receptors: common heterodimerization partners with distinct functions.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2010; 21: 676-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In the absence of their corresponding ligands, RXR heterodimers interact with co-repressors that maintain histones in a deacetylated state and inhibit transcription. Upon ligand binding, there is a conformational change so that the co-repressors are replaced by co-activators inducing histone acetylation and transcriptional activation. Co-activators, such as SRC-1, interact with nuclear receptors via an LXXLL motif (28Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. A signature motif in transcriptional co-activators mediates binding to nuclear receptors.Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar). We documented that AEG-1 contains an LXXLL motif, through which it interacts with RXR that prevents co-activator recruitment and inhibits RXR function even in the presence of ligand (25Srivastava J. Robertson C.L. Rajasekaran D. Gredler R. Siddiq A. Emdad L. Mukhopadhyay N.D. Ghosh S. Hylemon P.B. Gil G. Shah K. Bhere D. Subler M.A. Windle J.J. Fisher P.B. Sarkar D.

We now document augmented LXR and PPARα activity in enterocytes of AEG-1KO mice that hinders cholesterol and fatty acid absorption that may be one mechanism that leads to a lean phenotype. By regulating LXR and PPARα function, AEG-1 may significantly modulate the effects of a high fat diet and thus play a role in obesity-associated diseases. The AEG-1KO mouse was generated in a C57BL/6:129/Sv background (25Srivastava J. Robertson C.L. Rajasekaran D. Gredler R. Siddiq A. Emdad L. Mukhopadhyay N.D. Ghosh S. Hylemon P.B. Gil G. Shah K.

We have back-crossed the line to C57BL/6 for 10 generations and obtained similar results, which are described in this paper, for both the WT and AEG-1KO mice on the C57BL/6 background as on the C57BL/6:129/Sv background. The data presented in the figures were obtained from mice on the C57BL/6 background. All animal studies were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at Virginia Commonwealth University and were conducted in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act, the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the United States Government Principles for the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing, Research, and Training. A measured amount of food was given to 4-week-old age-matched WT and AEG-1KO mice (n = 8/group) housed in individual cages. The amount of food consumed per week was determined by measuring the leftover food. Body weight was also measured weekly. The experiment was performed for 12 weeks. Food consumption was calculated by the amount of food (in g) consumed/g of body weight. The mice were fed regular chow. For the high fat diet (HFD) experiment, 8-week-old mice were fed a high fat and cholesterol-containing diet (Harlan; TD.88137) for 5 weeks. This diet contains 0.2% total cholesterol and 21% total fat by weight, which provides 42% kcal (4.5 kcal/g). Male WT and AEG-1KO mice at 12 weeks of age were used (n = 6/group). Using a Bruker-Biospin Biospec console and a 7-tesla, 30-cm free bore magnet (Bruker Biospin), T2 weighted multislice spin echo images with and without fat suppression were acquired, covering the entire body from the base of skull to the tail, with a field of view of 4 × 4 cm and 256 × 256 matrix size. Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane during preparation (4%) and imaging (1%). The imaging parameters used were as follows: repetition time of 6.5 s, time of echo of 56 ms. The resultant two-dimensional images were exported and analyzed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). By subtracting the fat-suppressed images from the non-fat-suppressed images, fat-only images were produced, which were then used for region of interest analysis of the fat depots. Multiplying the area of the region of interest by slice thickness gave the volume. Male WT and AEG-1KO mice at 12 weeks of age were used (n = 6/group). VCO2, VO2, and respiratory quotient were measured using a four-chamber Columbus Instruments Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System CLAMS/Oxymax (Columbus, OH) indirect calorimetry machine, which was calibrated based on the O2 and CO2 levels of the room dedicated for indirect calorimetry only. The mice were acclimated to the indirect calorimetry room for 1 week prior to the experiment. The oxygen consumption is calculated by taking the difference between the input oxygen flow and the output oxygen flow. Similarly, the carbon dioxide production is calculated by taking the difference between the output and input carbon dioxide flows. The calculations were analyzed as VO2 = ViO2i − VoO2o, where Vi and Vo are the input and output ventilation rates (liters/min), and O2i and O2o are oxygen fractions at the input and output, and as VCO2 = VoCO2o − ViCO2i, where Vi and Vo are the input and output ventilation rates (liters/min), and CO2i and CO2o are carbon dioxide fractions at the input and output. The respiratory exchange ratio (RER) is simply the ratio between the carbon dioxide production and the oxygen consumption; thus, the equation is the following, RER = VCO2/VO2. Energy expenditure or heat is calculated before the application of any normalization or correction and, thus, reflects the exact heat of the subject. The calorific value (CV) is based on the observed respiratory exchange ratio. CV is then used with the observed oxygen consumption (VO2) to calculate heat; the equations are as follows, heat = CV × VO2 and CV = 3.815 + 1.232 × RER. The Case Mouse Phenotyping Center measured the triglyceride content and newly synthesized triglyceride levels. In order to enrich the body water with ∼2% 2H, intraperitoneal injection of labeled water (20 μl × g−1 of body weight of 9 g/liter NaCl in 99% atomic percentage excess 2H2O) was administered to adult male mice, and they were returned to their cages and maintained on 5% 2H-labeled drinking water for 5 days. The mice were sacrificed, and blood and tissue samples were collected and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The samples were stored at −80 °C until analysis. Triglyceride concentrations and de novo lipogenesis were determined as described previously (30Bederman I.R. Foy S. Chandramouli V. Alexander J.C. Previs S.F.

Briefly, triglyceride from tissues was isolated, and labeled glycerol and palmitate were analyzed after derivatization by mass spectrometry. The 2H-labeled triglyceride covalently linked to glycerol measures the amount of newly synthesized triglyceride, whereas the 2H-labeled triglyceride covalently attached to palmitate indicates the amount of new palmitate. In mice given 2H2O for 5 days, the contribution of de novo lipogenesis to the pool of triglyceride and palmitate was calculated using the following equation, % newly made palmitate = ((total 2H-labeled palmitate × (2H-labeled body water × n)) − 1) × 100, where n is the number of exchangeable hydrogens, which is assumed to be 22 (31Lee W.N.

The percentage of total newly made triglyceride glycerol is calculated using the following equation, % total newly made triglyceride-glycerol = ((2H-labeled triglyceride-glycerol × (2H-labeled water × n)) − 1) × 100, where 2H-labeled triglyceride-glycerol is the M1 isotopomer, 2H-labeled water is the average amount labeled in a given mouse, and n is the exchange factor (experimentally determined from the M2/M1 ratio of triglyceride glycerol). We calculated the total triglyceride pool size (μmol/g of tissue) in the tissues using the following equation, total pool size of triglyceride = ((2H-labeled triglyceride-glycerol × (2H-labeled water × n)) − 1) × 100.

Mice were fed standard chow diet for 3 days, and the feces were collected daily. The radioactivity of the pooled fecal samples was determined by a scintillation counter. The percentage of cholesterol absorption was calculated as follows, ((14C/3H dosing mixture − 14C/3H feces)/(14C/3H dosing mixture) × 100. WT and AEG-1KO mice were fasted overnight and intravenously injected with 500 mg/kg tyloxapol to block serum lipase activity. After 30 min, mice were gavaged with fat emulsion containing 10 μCi of [3H]triolein. Blood samples were collected from the tail vein at time 0 and hourly for 4 h.

After 48 h, cells were incubated in the presence or absence of the respective ligands (T0901317 (5 μm) and CP775146 (2.5 μm)) for another 24 h. Luciferase assays were measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol, and firefly luciferase activity was normalized by Renilla luciferase activity. Each experiment was performed in triplicates and three times to calculate means and S.D. values. Total RNA was extracted from hepatocytes or mouse tissues using the Qiagen miRNAeasy minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). cDNA preparation was done using the ABI cDNA synthesis kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). RT-PCR was performed using an ABI ViiA7 fast real-time PCR system and Taqman gene expression assays according to the manufacturer's protocol (Applied Biosystems). The expression level of each gene was determined by the ΔΔCT method and was normalized by the level of GAPDH.

The need for an animal model to study the disease process and evaluate potential treatments is imminent as the virus continues its spread into novel geographic locations. Golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) are often used as outbred laboratory animal models for arboviral diseases. Here we demonstrate that hamsters inoculated with chikungunya virus developed viremia and histopathologic lesions in their limbs and joints similar to those seen in human patients. The virus disseminated rapidly and was found in every major organ, including brain, within a few days of infection. Hamsters did not manifest overt clinical signs, and the virus was generally cleared within 4 days, followed by a strong neutralizing antibody response. These results indicate that hamsters are highly susceptible to chikungunya virus infection and develop myositis and tenosynovitis similar to human patients followed by a complete recovery. This animal model may be useful for testing antiviral drugs and vaccines."

Real-time quaking-induced conversion can amplify very small amounts of PrPSc seeds in tissues/body fluids of patients or animals. Using this in vitro PrP-amyloid amplification assay, we quantitated the seeding activity of affected human brains. End-point assay using serially diluted brain homogenates of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease patients demonstrated that 50% seeding dose (SD50) is reached approximately 10(10)/g brain (values varies 10(8.79-10.63)/g). A genetic case (GSS-P102L) yielded a similar level of seeding activity in an autopsy brain sample. The range of PrPSc concentrations in the samples, determined by dot-blot assay, was 0.6-5.4 μg/g brain; therefore, we estimated that 1 SD50 unit was equivalent to 0.06-0.27 fg of PrPSc. The SD50 values of the affected brains dropped more than three orders of magnitude after autoclaving at 121°C. This new method for quantitation of human prion activity provides a new way to reduce the risk of iatrogenic prion transmission."
https://openalex.org/W608311264,"Na+/H+ Exchanger Regulatory Factor-1 (NHERF1) is a scaffolding protein containing 2 PDZ domains that coordinates the assembly and trafficking of transmembrane receptors and ion channels. Most target proteins harboring a C-terminus recognition motif bind more-or-less equivalently to the either PDZ domain, which contain identical core-binding motifs. However some substrates such as the type II sodium-dependent phosphate co-transporter (NPT2A), uniquely bind only one PDZ domain. We sought to define the structural determinants responsible for the specificity of interaction between NHERF1 PDZ domains and NPT2A. By performing all-atom/explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in combination with biological mutagenesis, fluorescent polarization (FP) binding assays, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we found that in addition to canonical interactions of residues at 0 and -2 positions, Arg at the -1 position of NPT2A plays a critical role in association with Glu43 and His27 of PDZ1 that are absent in PDZ2. Experimentally introduced mutation in PDZ1 (Glu43Asp and His27Asn) decreased binding to NPT2A. Conversely, introduction of Asp183Glu and Asn167His mutations in PDZ2 promoted the formation of favorable interactions yielding micromolar KDs. The results describe novel determinants within both the PDZ domain and outside the canonical PDZ-recognition motif that are responsible for discrimination of NPT2A between two PDZ domains. The results challenge general paradigms for PDZ recognition and suggest new targets for drug development."

However, the pathways linking epithelial structure to cessation of the cell proliferation machinery or to unscheduled proliferation in the context of tumorigenesis are not well defined. Here we demonstrate the strong impact of compromised epithelial integrity on normal and oncogenic Myc-driven proliferation in three-dimensional mammary epithelial organoid culture. Systematic silencing of 34 human homologs of Drosophila genes, with previously established functions in control of epithelial integrity, demonstrates a role for human genes of apico-basal polarity, Wnt and Hippo pathways and actin dynamics in regulation of the size, integrity and cell proliferation in organoids. Perturbation of these pathways leads to diverse functional interactions with Myc: manifested as a RhoA-dependent synthetic lethality and Par6-dependent effects on the cell cycle. Furthermore, we show a role for Par6G as a negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1/Akt pathway and epithelial cell proliferation and evidence for frequent inactivation of Par6G gene in epithelial cancers. The findings demonstrate that determinants of epithelial structure regulate the cell proliferation activity via conserved and cancer-relevant regulatory circuitries, which are important for epithelial cell cycle restriction and may provide new targets for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W1540769508,"The pluripotency gene Nanog is not expressed in normal adult tissues but is overexpressed in some human cancers. However, the tumorigenic roles of Nanog remain unclear. The ectopic expression of Nanog is not sufficient to induce spontaneous tumors in mice but can promote metastasis of established tumors by activating the expression of metastatic genes. The expression of Nanog in mouse skin activates tumor suppressor p53, leading to the differentiation of epidermal stem cells. In the absence of p53, Nanog induces spontaneous squamous cell carcinoma, identifying a novel role of Nanog in tumorigenesis. Therefore, the induction of p53 and differentiation in Nanog-expressing skin suppresses the tumorigenic activities of Nanog, which include the induction of DNA double-stranded break damage. Notably, Nanog interacts with the KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP1) and inhibits its sumoylation activity, impairing KAP1-mediated chromatin remodeling, which is important for efficiently activating DNA damage response. In summary, Nanog is an oncogene with multiple roles in promoting tumorigenesis and metastasis."

In addition, we recently reported a non-transcriptional role of GPS2 as an inhibitor of the proinflammatory TNFα pathway in the cytosol. Although this suggests that the control of GPS2 localization may be an important determinant of its molecular functions, a clear understanding of GPS2 differential targeting to specific cellular locations is still lacking. Here we show that a fine balance between protein stabilization and degradation tightly regulates GPS2 nuclear function. Our findings indicate that GPS2 is degraded upon polyubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Siah2.

https://openalex.org/W1603029494,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and secondary small interfering RNAs (principally phased siRNAs or trans-acting siRNAs) are two distinct subfamilies of small RNAs (sRNAs) that are emerging as key regulators of posttranscriptional gene expression in plants. Both miRNAs and secondary-siRNAs (sec-siRNAs) are processed from longer RNA precursors by DICER-LIKE proteins (DCLs). Gossypium arboreum L., also known as tree cotton or Asian cotton, is a diploid, possibly ancestral relative of tetraploid Gossypium hirsutum L., the predominant type of commercially grown cotton worldwide known as upland cotton. To understand the biological significance of these gene regulators in G. arboreum, a bioinformatics analysis was performed on G. arboreum small RNAs produced from G. arboreum leaf, flower, and boll tissues. Consequently, 263 miRNAs derived from 353 precursors, including 155 conserved miRNAs (cs-miRNAs) and 108 novel lineage-specific miRNAs (ls-miRNAs). Along with miRNAs, 2,033 miRNA variants (isomiRNAs) were identified as well. Those isomiRNAs with variation at the 3'-miRNA end were expressed at the highest levels, compared to other types of variants. In addition, 755 pha-siRNAs derived 319 pha-siRNA gene transcripts (PGTs) were identified, and the potential pha-siRNA initiators were predicted. Also, 2,251 non-phased siRNAs were found as well, of which 1,088 appeared to be produced by so-called cis- or trans-cleavage of the PGTs observed at positions differing from pha-siRNAs. Of those sRNAs, 148 miRNAs/isomiRNAs and 274 phased/non-phased siRNAs were differentially expressed in one or more pairs of tissues examined. Target analysis revealed that target genes for both miRNAs and pha-siRNAs are involved a broad range of metabolic and enzymatic activities. We demonstrate that secondary siRNA production could result from initial cleavage of precursors by both miRNAs or isomiRNAs, and that subsequently produced phased and unphased siRNAs could result that also serve as triggers of a second round of both cis- and trans-cleavage of additional siRNAs, leading to the formation of complex sRNA regulatory networks mediating posttranscriptional gene silencing. Results from this study extended our knowledge on G. arboreum sRNAs and their biological importance, which would facilitate future studies on regulatory mechanism of tissue development in cotton and other plant species."
https://openalex.org/W1869753034,"Maintenance of telomere is regulated by active telomerase complex, including telomerase holoenzyme and its associated proteins. The activity of telomerase is precisely controlled in cells, and its dysregulation is one of the hallmarks of cancer. The telomerase catalytic subunit human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) plays a central role for telomerase activity. In this study, we indentified that Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is a novel telomerase-associated protein. Plk1 can interact with hTERT independently of its kinase activity. More importantly, we found that Plk1 is associated with active telomerase complex. In addition, we demonstrated that knockdown of Plk1 caused the reduction of telomerase activity, whereas overexpression of Plk1 increased telomerase activity. Further analysis showed that overexpression of Plk1 led to a significant increase of hTERT protein by prolonging its half-life but did not affect the level of hTERT mRNA. Furthermore, we found that Plk1 enhanced the chromatin loading of hTERT and inhibited its ubiquitination. This implied that Plk1 affected hTERT stability by inhibiting its ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Collectively, these observations suggested that Plk1 is a positive modulator of telomerase by enhancing the stability of hTERT."

However, the mechanism by which pairing facilitates sexual maturation of females is not clear. An increasing body of evidence suggests that ribosomal proteins have regulatory rather than constitutive roles in protein translation.To investigate the effect of ribosome regulation on female sex maturation, Solexa and iTRAQ techniques were used to analyze the relationship between ribosomal gene or protein expression and sexual development of Schistosoma females. In the present study, considerably higher number of ribosomal genes or proteins were found to be differentially expressed in paired 23-day-old females. Moreover, mature female-specific proteins associated with egg production, such as ferritin-1 heavy chain and superoxide dismutase, were selectively highly expressed in paired females, rather than higher level of protein synthesis of all transcripts compared with those in unpaired 23-day-old females. Furthermore, other developmental stages were utilized to investigate different expression pattern of ribosomal proteins in females by analysing 18-day-old female schistosomula from single- or double-sex infections to determine the relationship between ribosomal protein expression pattern and development. Results showed that undeveloped 18-day-old females from single- and double-sex infections, as well as 23-day-old unpaired females, possessed similar ribosomal protein expression patterns, which were distinct from those in 23-day-old paired females.Our findings reveal that the pairing of females and males triggers a specialized ribosomal protein expression profile which further regulates the protein profile for sexual maturation in Schistosoma japonicum, based on its gene expression profile."

Enamel is the hardest tissue in the vertebrate body; however, it starts development as a self-organizing assembly of matrix proteins that control crystallite habit. Here, we examine ameloblastin, a protein that is initially distributed uniformly across the cell boundary but redistributes to the lateral margins of the extracellular matrix following secretion thus producing cell-defined boundaries within the matrix and the mineral phase. The yeast two-hybrid assay identified that proteasome subunit α type 3 (Psma3) interacts with ameloblastin. Confocal microscopy confirmed Psma3 co-distribution with ameloblastin at the ameloblast secretory end piece. Co-immunoprecipitation assay of mouse ameloblast cell lysates with either ameloblastin or Psma3 antibody identified each reciprocal protein partner. Protein engineering demonstrated that only the ameloblastin C terminus interacts with Psma3. We show that 20S proteasome digestion of ameloblastin in vitro generates an N-terminal cleavage fragment consistent with the in vivo pattern of ameloblastin distribution. These findings suggest a novel pathway participating in control of protein distribution within the extracellular space that serves to regulate the protein-mineral interactions essential to biomineralization."

We plate a suspension of hippocampal neurons on an array of extracellular electrodes and record electrical activity in the absence of the drugs several days after treatment. While previous studies have reported on potentiation lasting up to a few hours after treatment, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to characterize the network effects of a potentiating mechanism several days after treatment. Using this reduced, two-dimensional in vitro network of hippocampal neurons, we show that the effects of potentiation are persistent over time but are modulated under a conservation of spike principle. We suggest that this conservation principle might be mediated by the appearance of a resonant inter-spike interval that prevents the network from advancing towards a state of hyperexcitability."

A fast and accurate calibration method for pipelined ADCs is proposed in this research. The proposed calibration method composes histograms through the outputs of each stage and calculates error sources. The digitized outputs of a stage are influenced directly by the operation of the prior stage, so the results of the histogram provide the information of errors in the prior stage. The composed histograms reduce the required samples and thus calibration time being implemented by simple modules. For 14-bit resolution pipelined ADC, the measured maximum integral non-linearity (INL) is improved from 6.78 to 0.52 LSB, and the spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) and signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) are improved from 67.0 to 106.2dB and from 65.6 to 84.8dB, respectively."
