We have previously demonstrated that a 500-base region of the 3′-untranslated region of VEGF mRNA that is critical for stabilization of VEGF mRNA in an in vitro degradation assay forms a RNA-protein complex in a hypoxia-inducible fashion. We report here the identification of three adenylate-uridylate-rich RNA elements within this region that form an identical or closely related hypoxia-inducible RNA-protein complex. This complex is constitutively elevated in a tumor cell line lacking the wild type von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene and in which VEGF mRNA is constitutively stabilized. Furthermore, the glucose transporter-1 mRNA, which is also stabilized by hypoxia, forms a hypoxia-inducible RNA-protein complex with similar sequence and protein binding characteristics to that described for VEGF mRNA. Finally, RNA affinity purification and UV cross-linking were used to identify three proteins of 32, 28, and 17 kDa that are derived from this hypoxia-inducible RNA-protein complex.

INTRODUCTIONThe cell cycle consists of a series of strictly ordered steps, requiring the completion of one event before the next can occur. The protein kinases that control entry into and progression through various stages of the cell cycle are members of the Cdk 1The abbreviations used are: Cdkcyclin-dependent kinaseGSTglutathione S-transferase. (cyclin-dependent kinase) subfamily of protein kinases. Cdk activities fluctuate as a result of post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions. An active Cdk is formed after binding to a cyclin partner and phosphorylation on a key threonine (Thr-161 in human p34cdc2). In vertebrates, Cdk4-cyclin D is necessary for passage through G1, p33cdk2-cyclin E is necessary for the transition from G1 to S phase, p33cdk2-cyclin A is necessary for progression through S, and p34cdc2-cyclin B is necessary for the transition from G2 to M phase (1Pines J. Biochem.

Many of these downstream effects could be caused directly by the Cdk; for example, p34cdc2-cyclin B can phosphorylate lamins thus leading to their disassembly (2Peter M. Nakagawa J. Dorée M.

Other effects could be indirect, the result of a cascade of events initiated by the Cdk; for example, Cdk4-cyclin D phosphorylates Rb, thus releasing E2F to promote the transcription of many genes important for DNA replication (5Kato J.-y.

Obviously the choice of a phosphorylation target site will be influenced strongly by inherent differences in the substrate binding region of a particular Cdk (6Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Eyck L.F.T.

In addition, the cyclin subunit could influence substrate specificity in any of the following ways: by binding a potential substrate and bringing it into contact with the Cdk; by targeting the Cdk to a particular subcellular location where it has access to only a limited number of potential substrates (10Pines J.

Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 697-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Most likely, the substrate is recognized by a combination of the Cdk substrate binding pocket and long range interactions with surface residues of the cyclin subunit (13Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A.

A systematic study of protein kinase substrate specificity was carried out recently by Songyang et al. (9Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica-Worms H. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) using a peptide library containing approximately 2.5 billion unique peptides, with a fixed serine as the phosphate acceptor, as substrates for various kinases including p33cdk2-cyclin A and p34cdc2-cyclin B. This method identified a sequence similar to one of the consensus sites as the optimal substrate for p34cdc2-cyclin B, (K/R)SP(R/P)(R/K/H).We have investigated the substrate specificity of p33cdk2 bound to cyclin A or E and of p34cdc2 bound to cyclin A or B using a systematic series of specifically defined peptide substrates appended to the COOH terminus of glutathione S-transferase, constructed by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate oligonucleotides. These substrates allowed us to determine quantitatively the role of the primary sequence of a target site in substrate utilization. Our panel of altered target sites has allowed us to compare the inherent differences in substrate recognition between p33cdk2 and p34cdc2 as well as to examine the effects of the cyclin regulatory subunits on specificity. In addition, we have found that the data generated from these experiments can be used to predict the potential utilization of novel phosphorylation sites.DISCUSSIONWe have used a panel of GST fusion proteins containing systematic alterations of a canonical p34cdc2 phosphorylation site to determine the fine specificity of p34cdc2 and p33cdk2 bound to various cyclins. Understanding the similarities and differences in the specificities of these enzymes is an essential first step toward evaluating potential substrates that could play important roles in cell cycle progression. Previous studies of p34cdc2 phosphorylation sites have involved compilations of sites found in diverse proteins and examination of modest numbers of synthetic peptide substrate variants. Recently a peptide selection approach has been used to define a p34cdc2 consensus site as (K/R)SP(R/P)(R/K/H). Although this method is extremely useful for rapidly determining optimal phosphorylation sites, it is not as well suited for determining which amino acids are poorly tolerated or excluded, it does not analyze all 20 amino acids, and it systematically overestimates the phosphorylation of suboptimal substrates (9Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica-Worms H. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Our approach benefits from using a comprehensive collection of variant substrates within the same protein context. The fusion proteins are inexpensive and readily purified, and additional mutant phosphorylation sites can be engineered quite easily. We also expect that our panel of substrates will prove useful for determining the substrate specificity of other Cdks, including those involved in cell cycle control as well as those involved in other processes.Overall, we found that Xenopus p34cdc2 was least sensitive to substitutions at the -1 position of the wild type sequence KSPRK (with respect to the phosphorylated Ser), fairly sensitive to substitutions at the +2 position, and most sensitive to substitutions at the +3 position. Although this general pattern is consistent with widely held consensus sites for phosphorylation by p34cdc2, our data significantly alter our view of what sequences can constitute good, fair, or poor phosphorylation targets. Our finding that the -1 position can accommodate any amino acid, but that there is about a 2-fold variation in phosphorylation efficiency, is closer to the consensus that posits no specificity than to those that place a basic residue at this position. At the +2 position, we found that neither consensus view, either specifying a polar residue or tolerating all amino acids, adequately fit the data. There was a strong degree of specificity at this position since some substitution mutants were phosphorylated almost 20-fold more efficiently than others. However, we have been unable to discern any simple pattern to explain this specificity. Clearly, though, both polar and nonpolar amino acid side chains could form excellent substrates, and some polar amino acids yielded quite poor substrates. At the +3 position our data are in agreement with the consensus view that basic residues are best. However, by focusing on the best sites, the consensus view fails to distinguish among the poorer sites. We would divide the substitutions at the +3 position into four classes: basic residues, which form excellent sites (about 100% of wild type phosphorylation efficiency); His and Pro, which can form surprisingly strong sites (about 20% of wild type); most other amino acids, which form weak but significant sites (about 5% of wild type); and acidic groups, which form virtually unphosphorylatable sites. The approximately 20-fold reduction in binding affinity on substitution of Ala and most other amino acids at the +3 position corresponds to a weakening of the interaction by about 1.8 kcal/mol, which is consistent with the loss of a single ionic interaction linking the +3 basic residue to p34cdc2.We observed two classes of modest effects of the cyclin partner on phosphorylation of the substrates. First, we noted that the cyclin A-containing complex of p33cdk2 had a consistently ~2-fold higher Km for our substrates than the cyclin E-containing complex (Table I). The Km was not measured for all substrates, but if phosphorylation efficiencies reflect changes in Km, and not in Vmax, then this difference in Km probably applies to nearly all of the substrates and not just to those shown in Table I. This result may indicate that cyclin E is a “better” cyclin in that it may be able to induce a better geometry of the binding pocket in p33cdk2 for substrates. We saw no comparable effect of cyclin A versus cyclin B in the p34cdc2-containing complexes. We also noted a more sporadic effect of cyclin partner on phosphorylation efficiencies that we are inclined to attribute to weak longer range interactions between the cyclin and individual target sequences.Although the specificities of p34cdc2 and p33cdk2 were generally similar, we were surprised to find a number of instances where p33cdk2 was far more selective. p33cdk2 was much less tolerant of Gly or Pro at the +2 position than was p34cdc2. This effect was approximately 10-fold or more, depending on the cyclin partner. The greatest differences were seen at the +3 position, where p33cdk2 essentially did not phosphorylate (less than 0.4% of wild type efficiency) any substrate not containing Lys or Arg at this site. Even Arg, which yields a very good p34cdc2 substrate, gave only poor substrates (about 5% wild type efficiency) for p33cdk2. The presence of any amino acid other than Lys or Arg at the +3 position of a putative Cdk phosphorylation site can be taken as a strong indication that p34cdc2, rather than p33cdk2, phosphorylates that protein. The presence of Gly or Pro at the +2 position, or of Arg at the +3 position, would also tend to point toward p34cdc2 as the relevant protein kinase.Our data are likely to be useful for the initial evaluation of potential substrates of p34cdc2 and of p33cdk2. We were able to predict the phosphorylation efficiencies of multiple site substitutions fairly accurately since the effects of the single amino acid substitution mutants on phosphorylation efficiency were additive (Table II). We envision that a full prediction of potential phosphorylation sites on novel proteins will help to guide experiments toward the most likely physiological sites. For example, our data predict that an intuitively poor target site, YSPMH, would be phosphorylated almost twice as efficiently by Xenopus p34cdc2-cyclin B as an intuitively excellent site, KSPDR (13.0% versus 7.0% of wild type efficiency). We do not anticipate that our predictive scale will be accurate for all sites in all protein contexts. Clearly, many factors combine to determine the phosphorylation efficiency of a given target. A theoretically excellent site could be buried within a protein or folded rigidly in an unfavorable conformation. Similarly, an otherwise weak site could be folded tightly and presented in a favorable way. Additional interactions between either subunit of the Cdk and a substrate could further influence specificity. Despite these caveats, and in particular because their contributions are difficult to evaluate, we feel that our scale presents an unbiased starting point for examination of Cdk substrates. Tables showing the phosphorylation efficiencies depicted graphically in Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4 are readily available from the authors.

Crucial to our understanding of the cell cycle is the ability to identify for the various Cdk-cyclin complexes the key substrates whose phosphorylation leads to the progression through a particular cellular event. Many of these downstream effects could be caused directly by the Cdk; for example, p34cdc2-cyclin B can phosphorylate lamins thus leading to their disassembly (2Peter M. Nakagawa J. Dorée M. Labbé J.C. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 591-602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 3Dessev G. Iovcheva-Dessev C. Bischoff J.R. Beach D. Goldman R. J.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1535-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), an important event in the initiation of mitosis. Other effects could be indirect, the result of a cascade of events initiated by the Cdk; for example, Cdk4-cyclin D phosphorylates Rb, thus releasing E2F to promote the transcription of many genes important for DNA replication (5Kato J.-y. Matsushime H. Hiebert S.W. Ewen M.E. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). An understanding of the basis of substrate specificities of different Cdk-cyclin complexes is of central importance as specificity can be influenced by many factors. Obviously the choice of a phosphorylation target site will be influenced strongly by inherent differences in the substrate binding region of a particular Cdk (6Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Eyck L.F.T.

Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). In addition, the cyclin subunit could influence substrate specificity in any of the following ways: by binding a potential substrate and bringing it into contact with the Cdk; by targeting the Cdk to a particular subcellular location where it has access to only a limited number of potential substrates (10Pines J. Hunter T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 11Pines J. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3772-3781Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 12Jackman M. Firth M. Pines J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1646-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar); or by restricting Cdk activities to a narrow window within the cell cycle so that the kinase can only affect those substrates present and able to be activated during that stage (1Pines J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 697-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Most likely, the substrate is recognized by a combination of the Cdk substrate binding pocket and long range interactions with surface residues of the cyclin subunit (13Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). The majority of substrates would be recognized by the Cdk in association with any cyclin, but certain subsets might be recognized or preferred by a specific Cdk-cyclin pair (14Minshull J. Golsteyn R. Hill C.S. Hunt T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2865-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Several recent studies have indeed demonstrated that the identity of the cyclin partner can influence substrate specificity significantly (14Minshull J. Golsteyn R. Hill C.S. Hunt T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2865-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 15Thomas L. Clarke P.R. Pagano M. Gruenberg J. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1947-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Several loose consensus substrate sequences have been reported for p34cdc2 based on a limited number of known in vivo and in vitro p34cdc2 substrates (for review, see 18Nigg E.A. Semin. Cell Biol. 1991; 2: 261-270PubMed Google Scholar). These include (K/R)(S/T)PX(K/R), where X is any amino acid (18Nigg E.A. Semin.

Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 296-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). It has generally been assumed that p33cdk2 has a similar specificity. The few studies investigating the substrate specificity of the Cdks have been performed primarily on p34cdc2 (14Minshull J. Golsteyn R. Hill C.S. Hunt T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2865-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 18Nigg E.A. Semin. Cell Biol. 1991; 2: 261-270PubMed Google Scholar, 20Nigg E.A.

A systematic study of protein kinase substrate specificity was carried out recently by Songyang et al. (9Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica-Worms H. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) using a peptide library containing approximately 2.5 billion unique peptides, with a fixed serine as the phosphate acceptor, as substrates for various kinases including p33cdk2-cyclin A and p34cdc2-cyclin B. This method identified a sequence similar to one of the consensus sites as the optimal substrate for p34cdc2-cyclin B, (K/R)SP(R/P)(R/K/H). We have investigated the substrate specificity of p33cdk2 bound to cyclin A or E and of p34cdc2 bound to cyclin A or B using a systematic series of specifically defined peptide substrates appended to the COOH terminus of glutathione S-transferase, constructed by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate oligonucleotides. These substrates allowed us to determine quantitatively the role of the primary sequence of a target site in substrate utilization. Our panel of altered target sites has allowed us to compare the inherent differences in substrate recognition between p33cdk2 and p34cdc2 as well as to examine the effects of the cyclin regulatory subunits on specificity. In addition, we have found that the data generated from these experiments can be used to predict the potential utilization of novel phosphorylation sites. DISCUSSIONWe have used a panel of GST fusion proteins containing systematic alterations of a canonical p34cdc2 phosphorylation site to determine the fine specificity of p34cdc2 and p33cdk2 bound to various cyclins. Understanding the similarities and differences in the specificities of these enzymes is an essential first step toward evaluating potential substrates that could play important roles in cell cycle progression. Previous studies of p34cdc2 phosphorylation sites have involved compilations of sites found in diverse proteins and examination of modest numbers of synthetic peptide substrate variants. Recently a peptide selection approach has been used to define a p34cdc2 consensus site as (K/R)SP(R/P)(R/K/H). Although this method is extremely useful for rapidly determining optimal phosphorylation sites, it is not as well suited for determining which amino acids are poorly tolerated or excluded, it does not analyze all 20 amino acids, and it systematically overestimates the phosphorylation of suboptimal substrates (9Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica-Worms H. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Our approach benefits from using a comprehensive collection of variant substrates within the same protein context. The fusion proteins are inexpensive and readily purified, and additional mutant phosphorylation sites can be engineered quite easily. We also expect that our panel of substrates will prove useful for determining the substrate specificity of other Cdks, including those involved in cell cycle control as well as those involved in other processes.Overall, we found that Xenopus p34cdc2 was least sensitive to substitutions at the -1 position of the wild type sequence KSPRK (with respect to the phosphorylated Ser), fairly sensitive to substitutions at the +2 position, and most sensitive to substitutions at the +3 position. Although this general pattern is consistent with widely held consensus sites for phosphorylation by p34cdc2, our data significantly alter our view of what sequences can constitute good, fair, or poor phosphorylation targets. Our finding that the -1 position can accommodate any amino acid, but that there is about a 2-fold variation in phosphorylation efficiency, is closer to the consensus that posits no specificity than to those that place a basic residue at this position. At the +2 position, we found that neither consensus view, either specifying a polar residue or tolerating all amino acids, adequately fit the data. There was a strong degree of specificity at this position since some substitution mutants were phosphorylated almost 20-fold more efficiently than others. However, we have been unable to discern any simple pattern to explain this specificity. Clearly, though, both polar and nonpolar amino acid side chains could form excellent substrates, and some polar amino acids yielded quite poor substrates. At the +3 position our data are in agreement with the consensus view that basic residues are best. However, by focusing on the best sites, the consensus view fails to distinguish among the poorer sites. We would divide the substitutions at the +3 position into four classes: basic residues, which form excellent sites (about 100% of wild type phosphorylation efficiency); His and Pro, which can form surprisingly strong sites (about 20% of wild type); most other amino acids, which form weak but significant sites (about 5% of wild type); and acidic groups, which form virtually unphosphorylatable sites. The approximately 20-fold reduction in binding affinity on substitution of Ala and most other amino acids at the +3 position corresponds to a weakening of the interaction by about 1.8 kcal/mol, which is consistent with the loss of a single ionic interaction linking the +3 basic residue to p34cdc2.We observed two classes of modest effects of the cyclin partner on phosphorylation of the substrates. First, we noted that the cyclin A-containing complex of p33cdk2 had a consistently ~2-fold higher Km for our substrates than the cyclin E-containing complex (Table I). The Km was not measured for all substrates, but if phosphorylation efficiencies reflect changes in Km, and not in Vmax, then this difference in Km probably applies to nearly all of the substrates and not just to those shown in Table I. This result may indicate that cyclin E is a “better” cyclin in that it may be able to induce a better geometry of the binding pocket in p33cdk2 for substrates. We saw no comparable effect of cyclin A versus cyclin B in the p34cdc2-containing complexes. We also noted a more sporadic effect of cyclin partner on phosphorylation efficiencies that we are inclined to attribute to weak longer range interactions between the cyclin and individual target sequences.Although the specificities of p34cdc2 and p33cdk2 were generally similar, we were surprised to find a number of instances where p33cdk2 was far more selective. p33cdk2 was much less tolerant of Gly or Pro at the +2 position than was p34cdc2. This effect was approximately 10-fold or more, depending on the cyclin partner. The greatest differences were seen at the +3 position, where p33cdk2 essentially did not phosphorylate (less than 0.4% of wild type efficiency) any substrate not containing Lys or Arg at this site. Even Arg, which yields a very good p34cdc2 substrate, gave only poor substrates (about 5% wild type efficiency) for p33cdk2. The presence of any amino acid other than Lys or Arg at the +3 position of a putative Cdk phosphorylation site can be taken as a strong indication that p34cdc2, rather than p33cdk2, phosphorylates that protein. The presence of Gly or Pro at the +2 position, or of Arg at the +3 position, would also tend to point toward p34cdc2 as the relevant protein kinase.Our data are likely to be useful for the initial evaluation of potential substrates of p34cdc2 and of p33cdk2. We were able to predict the phosphorylation efficiencies of multiple site substitutions fairly accurately since the effects of the single amino acid substitution mutants on phosphorylation efficiency were additive (Table II). We envision that a full prediction of potential phosphorylation sites on novel proteins will help to guide experiments toward the most likely physiological sites. For example, our data predict that an intuitively poor target site, YSPMH, would be phosphorylated almost twice as efficiently by Xenopus p34cdc2-cyclin B as an intuitively excellent site, KSPDR (13.0% versus 7.0% of wild type efficiency). We do not anticipate that our predictive scale will be accurate for all sites in all protein contexts. Clearly, many factors combine to determine the phosphorylation efficiency of a given target. A theoretically excellent site could be buried within a protein or folded rigidly in an unfavorable conformation. Similarly, an otherwise weak site could be folded tightly and presented in a favorable way. Additional interactions between either subunit of the Cdk and a substrate could further influence specificity. Despite these caveats, and in particular because their contributions are difficult to evaluate, we feel that our scale presents an unbiased starting point for examination of Cdk substrates.

https://openalex.org/W2126055537,"We have evaluated the effect of ring size of gramicidin S analogs on secondary structure, lipid binding, lipid disruption, antibacterial and hemolytic activity. Cyclic analogs with ring sizes ranging from 4 to 14 residues were designed to maintain the amphipathic character as found in gramicidin S and synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis. The secondary structure of these peptides showed a definite periodicity in β-sheet content, with rings containing 6, 10, and 14 residues exhibiting β-sheet structure, and rings containing 8 or 12 residues being largely disordered. Peptides containing 4 or 6 residues did not bind lipopolysaccharide, whereas longer peptides showed a trend of increasing binding affinity for lipopolysaccharide with increasing length. Destabilization of Escherichia coli outer membranes was only observed in peptides containing 10 or more residues. Peptides containing fewer than 10 residues were completely inactive and exhibited no hemolytic activity. The 10-residue peptide showed an activity profile similar to that of gramicidin S itself, with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms as well as yeast, but also showed high hemolytic activity. Differential activities were obtained by increasing the size of the ring to either 12 or 14 residues. The 14-residue peptide showed no antibiotic activity but exhibited increased hemolytic activity. The 12-residue peptide lost activity against Gram-positive bacteria, retained activity against Gram-negative microorganisms and yeast, but displayed decreased hemolytic activity. Biological activities in the 12-residue peptide were optimized by a series of substitutions in residues comprising both hydrophobic and basic sites resulting in a peptide that exhibited activities comparable with gramicidin S against Gram-negative microorganisms and yeast but with substantially lower hemolytic activity. Compared with gramicidin S, the best analog showed a 10-fold improvement in antibiotic specificity for Gram-negative microorganisms and a 7-fold improvement in specificity for yeast over human erythrocytes as determined by a therapeutic index. These results indicate that it is possible to modulate structure and activities of cyclic gramicidin S analogs by varying ring sizes and further show the potential for developing clinically useful antibiotics based on gramicidin S.

The emergence of many medically relevant resistant strains of bacteria today is a major issue in human health (1Neu H.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1064-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar). It is therefore becoming essential that new therapeutic agents be developed to combat microorganisms resistant to traditional antibiotics. We have chosen the cyclic peptide antibiotic gramicidin S (GS) 1The abbreviations used are: GSgramicidin SHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyLPSlipopolysaccharideMICminimum inhibitory concentrationNPN1-N-phenylnaphthylaminewtwild typeOrnornithineBoct-butyloxycarbonyl. as our model for the basis of designing novel therapeutic agents. GS is a naturally occurring cyclic peptide (cyclo-(Val-Orn-Leu-D-Phe-Pro)2) first isolated from Bacillus brevis by Gause and Brazhnikova (2Gause G.F. Brazhnikova M.G. Nature. 1944; 154: 703Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar) over 50 years ago. The use of GS analogs as antibiotics have many attractive features. These include their broad spectrum antibiotic properties (3Kondejewski L.H. Farmer S.W. Wishart D.S. Hancock R.E.W. Hodges R.S. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1996; 47: 460-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), their small size, and hence ease of generating large amounts synthetically, as well as their simplicity in structure. Development of resistance to GS analogs is also unlikely due to the fact that the target of these analogs is the cell membrane of sensitive microorganisms, although their mechanism of action is still not well understood (4Ovchinnikov Y.A. Ivanov V.T. Tetrahedron. 1975; 31: 2177-2209Crossref Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GS analogs would be predicted to be stable in vivo as only two proteases are known to degrade GS (5Maeda T. Takagi M. Imanaka T. J. Ferment.

Since its isolation in 1944, more than 200 analogs of this 10-residue peptide have been synthesized with the aim of better defining its structure-activity relationships as well as extending the activity of the compound (7Izumiya N.

From these studies, a number of structural requirements believed to be important for GS activity have been determined. These include (i) the requirement for an amphipathic structure containing basic residues on the hydrophilic face of the molecule (4Ovchinnikov Y.A. Ivanov V.T.

We have recently reported that the long held belief that GS is active against Gram-positive and not Gram-negative bacteria is a result of the type of assay used to measure antibacterial activity (3Kondejewski L.H. Farmer S.W. Wishart D.S. Hancock R.E.W. Hodges R.S. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1996; 47: 460-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The vast majority of researchers have employed agar-based assays that severely underestimate antibacterial activity against Gram-negative microorganisms. We have found that GS is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms when tested using liquid-based antibacterial assays. Due to the fact that GS possesses the ability to lyse eukaryotic cells, its use as an antibiotic has been restricted to that of a topical antibiotic (15Lambert H.P. O'Grady F.W. Antibiotic and Chemotherapy. 6th Ed. Churchill Livingstone, Edinburgh, U.K.1992: 232Google Scholar). To be useful as a broad spectrum antibiotic, it would be necessary to dissociate anti-eukaryotic activity from antibacterial activity. Studies with other cationic peptides have suggested this is possible (16Boman H.G. Wade D. Boman I.A. Wahlin B. Merrifield R.B. FEBS Lett. 1989; 259: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 17Tytler E.M. Anantharamaiah G.M. Walker D.E. Mishra V.K. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4393-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In a previous study we found that hemolytic activity of a number of GS analogs closely paralleled antibacterial activity in liquid-based assays (3Kondejewski L.H. Farmer S.W. Wishart D.S. Hancock R.E.W. Hodges R.S. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1996; 47: 460-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, one analog containing a D-His for D-Phe substitution showed increased hemolytic activity while possessing decreased antibacterial activity. It has also been reported that GS analogs containing more than 10 residues exhibit a change in activity profile (i.e. a change from Gram-positive specificity to Gram-negative specificity) when evaluated using agar-based assays (12Ando S. Nishikawa H. Takiguchi H. Lee S. Sugihara G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1147: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18Aoyagi H. Ando S. Lee S. Izumiya N. Tetrahedron. 1988; 44: 877-886Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these extended analogs were reported to possess less hemolytic activity than GS itself (12Ando S. Nishikawa H. Takiguchi H. Lee S. Sugihara G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1147: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A comparison between GS and another basic amphipathic cyclic β-sheet peptide, tachyplesin I, showed that both possessed antibacterial activity; however, tachyplesin I exhibited less hemolytic activity than GS (19Katsu T. Nakao S. Iwanaga S. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1993; 16: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Similar results have been seen with helical peptides such as melittin and magainin 2 (20Matsuzaki K. Sugishita K. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3423-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), where both peptides exhibit similar antibacterial properties but have different hemolytic activities. Together, these findings indicate that it should be possible to develop GS analogs with reduced hemolytic activity while retaining substantial antibacterial activity. To date, no systematic study has been undertaken to reduce hemolytic activity while retaining antibacterial activity in GS analogs. Furthermore, hemolytic activity of GS analogs has only been evaluated in a few cases. Development toward a more clinically useful antibiotic requires a systematic study in order to define the features responsible for both hemolytic and antibacterial activity. Owing to the lack of understanding regarding the features responsible for specific biological properties in GS analogs, we have undertaken to better define the role of ring size in the present study. We show that hemolytic and antibacterial activities can be dissociated by selecting analogs with appropriate ring sizes and that desired activities can be optimized by specific residue replacements. The following bacterial strains were utilized: Escherichia coli UB1005 (wt) and its antibiotic super-susceptible derivative DC2 (21Clark D. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1984; 21: 189-195Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar); E. coli SC9251 and its polymyxin B- resistant mutant pmrA SC9252 (22Peterson A.A. Fesik S.W. McGroarty E.J. Antimicrob.

Nature. 1983; 305: 704-712Crossref Scopus (1016) Google Scholar); S. aureus SAP0017, a methicillin-resistant clinical isolate from Dr. A. Chow (University of British Columbia); Bacillus subtilis, an environmental wt lab strain. Enterobacter faecalis are ATCC 29212 cells, and Staphylococcus epidermidis was a clinical isolate from Dr. D. Speert (University of British Columbia). Antifungal activity was tested using a clinical lab isolate of Candida albicans. All peptides were synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis using precoupled Boc-Pro-phenylacetamidomethyl resin (Novabiochem, San Diego, CA) on an Applied Biosystems model 430A peptide synthesizer (Foster City, CA) using standard t-butyloxycarbonyl chemistry (25Erickson B.W. Merrifield R.W. Neurath H. Hill R.L. The Proteins. Vol 2. Academic Press, New York1976: 255Crossref Google Scholar) as reported previously (26Wishart D.S. Kondejewski L.H. Semchuk P.D. Sykes B.D. Hodges R.S. Lett. Pept. Sci. 1996; 3: 53-60Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Side chain protecting groups were 2-bromobenzyloxycarbonyl for tyrosine and formyl for lysine and ornithine. Side chain formylation was carried out by the procedure of Kitagawa et al. (27Kitagawa T. Arita J. Nagahata A. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1994; 42: 1655-1657Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) using either Nα-Boc-lysine or Nα-Boc-ornithine. Peptides were cleaved from the resin using anhydrous hydrogen fluoride (20 ml/g resin) in the presence of 10% anisole for 1 h at -5°C. Peptides were extracted from the resin with glacial acetic acid and lyophilized. Crude linear peptides were purified by reversed-phase HPLC on a Synchropak RP-4 preparative C8 column (250 x 21.2 mm inner diameter, 6.5-μm particle size, 300-Å pore size) (Synchrom, Lafayette, IN) using a Beckman System Gold HPLC system (San Ramon, CA). The flow rate was 5 ml/min with a linear AB gradient of 0.25% B/min where solvent A was 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid/H2O and solvent B was 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile. Purity of peptides was verified by analytical reversed-phase HPLC on a Zorbax SB-C8 column (250 x 4.6 mm inner diameter, 5-μm particle size, 300-Å pore size) (Rockland Technologies, Wilmington, DE) using a Hewlett-Packard 1090 chromatograph with a linear AB gradient of 2% B/min and a 1 ml/min flow rate. Identity of peptides was confirmed by mass spectrometry on a Fisons VG Quattro triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Manchester, United Kingdom) fitted with an electrospray ionization source operating in positive ion mode. Pure linear formylated peptides were cyclized at a concentration of 2 mg/ml in N,N-dimethylformamide using 3 eq of each of benzotriazolyl N-oxytri-dimethylamino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, and diisopropylethylamine. The progress of the cyclization reaction was monitored by analytical reversed-phase HPLC and was typically complete after 12 h. Cyclic peptides were deformylated (10% HCl in methanol, 37°C for 24 h) and purified by preparative reversed-phase HPLC. Purified cyclic peptides were homogeneous by analytical reversed-phase HPLC and gave correct primary ion molecular weights by mass spectrometry as well as appropriate amino acid analysis ratios. Peptide concentration used for all assays was based on weight and may underestimate the actual amount of peptide. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-500C spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Easton, MD) equipped with a Jasco DP-500N data processor. The instrument was routinely calibrated with an aqueous solution of d-10-(+)-camphorsulfonic acid at 290.5 nm. Ellipticity is reported as mean residue ellipticity ([θ]) in degrees·cm2/dmol calculated from the following equation: [θ] = [θ]obs(mrw)/10lc, where [θ]obs is the ellipticity measured in degrees, mrw is the mean residue weight, c is the peptide concentration in g/ml, and l is the optical path length of the cell in cm. Spectra were recorded in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, and were the average of four scans obtained by collecting data at 0.1-nm intervals between 255 and 190 nm. Models of ring size analogs were built using Insight II (Biosym Technologies Inc., San Diego, CA) on a Silicon Graphics workstation. Models of the 10-, 12-, and 14-residue peptides were constructed by specifying standard antiparallel β-sheet ϕ, ψ values of -139° and 135°, respectively (28Creighton T.E. Proteins. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1984: 171-237Google Scholar). Two type IIʹβ-turns were incorporated into each structure designating D-Tyr and Pro residues as residues i + 1 and i + 2 of the turns. Dihedral angles (ϕ, ψ) used for the turns were 60°, -120°, and -80°, 0° for i + 1 and i + 2 residues, respectively (28Creighton T.E. Proteins. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1984: 171-237Google Scholar). The N termini of the analogs was arbitrarily chosen as a residue contained within the strands for the models only; chemically synthesized peptides used Pro as the C terminus in all cases. MICs were determined using a standard microtiter dilution method in LB no-salt medium (10 g of tryptone and 5 g of yeast extract per liter). Briefly, cells were grown overnight at 37°C in LB and diluted in the same medium. Serial dilutions of antibiotics were added to the microtiter plates in a volume of 100 μl followed by 10 μl of bacteria to give a final inoculum of 5 x 105 colony-forming units/ml. Plates were incubated at 37°C overnight and MICs determined as the lowest antibiotic concentration that inhibited growth. Freshly collected human blood with heparin was centrifuged to remove the buffy coat, and the erythrocytes obtained were washed three times in 0.85% saline and stored at 4°C. Serial dilutions of the peptides in saline were prepared in round bottom microtiter plates using 100-μl volumes. Red blood cells were diluted with saline to 1/25 packed volume of cells and 50 μl added to each well. Plates were incubated with rocking at 37°C, and the concentration required for complete lysis was determined visually after 4 h. Permeabilization studies were carried out as described previously (3Kondejewski L.H. Farmer S.W. Wishart D.S. Hancock R.E.W. Hodges R.S. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1996; 47: 460-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli SC9251 cells were suspended in 5 mM sodium HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, containing 5 mM glucose and 5 mM carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. NPN was added to 1 ml of cells in a quartz cuvette to give a final concentration of 10 mM and the background fluorescence recorded. Aliquots of peptide were added to the cuvette and fluorescence recorded as a function of time until there was no further increase in fluorescence. A fresh cuvette of cells with NPN was used for each concentration for each peptide, and control experiments were performed to demonstrate that enhanced fluorescence was due to uptake of NPN into cells, as described previously (29Hancock R.E.W. Wong P.G.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1984; 26: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 30Loh B. Grant C. Hancock R.E.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1984; 26: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 31Hancock R.E.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1981; 8: 429-445Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Dansyl-polymyxin displacement from P. aeruginosa LPS was measured as described previously (32Moore R.A. Bates N.C. Hancock R.E.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1986; 29: 496-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Briefly, peptides were titrated into cuvettes containing 3 μg of LPS/ml and 2.5 μM dansyl-polymyxin (approximately 90% saturation of LPS binding sites) in 1 ml of 5 mM sodium HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, and the decrease in fluorescence was recorded. A plot of the inverse of the percent inhibition as a function of the inverse of inhibitor concentration gave a value for I50, the inhibitor concentration resulting in 50% displacement of dansyl-polymyxin from LPS (-1/x intercept). We have synthesized cyclic GS analogs ranging in ring size from 4 to 14 residues as shown in Table I. The peptides were designed to incorporate the alternating hydrophobic-hydrophilic residue pattern found in GS, where Val and Leu residues make up the hydrophobic face of the molecule and Orn residues constitute the hydrophilic face. This was accomplished by increasing the length of the ring by successively incorporating either hydrophobic (Val and Leu) or hydrophilic (Lys or Orn) residues. Peptides used for preliminary screening also incorporated additional substitutions, namely the replacement of D-Tyr for D-Phe for increased solubility and Lys for Orn. Previous studies have shown that these homologous substitutions lead to minimal changes in both structure and activity of GS analogs (3Kondejewski L.H. Farmer S.W. Wishart D.S. Hancock R.E.W. Hodges R.S. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1996; 47: 460-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 7Izumiya N. Kato T. Aoyaga H. Waki M. Kondo M. Synthetic Aspects of Biologically Active Cyclic Peptides: Gramicidin S and Tyrocidines. Halsted Press, New York1979: 49Google Scholar). Because of the unusual activity exhibited by the 12-residue peptide, native residues were systematically incorporated into it in order to determine the importance of each in antibiotic and hemolytic activity.Table I.Sequences and biological and physical properties of cyclic GS ring analogsPeptideLinear sequenceaLinear sequences of cyclic peptides.

Open table in a new tab As shown previously (33Wishart D.S. Kondejewski L.H. Semchuk P.D. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. Crabb J.W. Techniques in Protein Chemistry. Vol 4. Academic Press, San Diego1995: 451Google Scholar), the CD spectra of GS and various GS-related 10-residue cyclic peptides do not resemble that of a typical anti-parallel β-sheet spectrum, normally characterized by a negative CD band near 217 nm and a positive band near 195 nm (34Woody R.W. Methods. Enzymol. 1995; 246: 34-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), likely due to the large contribution of two β-turns and aromatic residues present in a small molecule. However, as discussed by Ovchinnikov and Ivanov (4Ovchinnikov Y.A. Ivanov V.T. Tetrahedron. 1975; 31: 2177-2209Crossref Scopus (244) Google Scholar), CD spectra can provide evidence as to the perturbation of a conformational state in a series of related peptides. Hence, a GS-like CD spectrum is likely a good indicator for β-structure in these cyclic peptides. As shown in Fig. 1, cyclic peptides containing 6, 10, or 14 residues exhibit GS-like CD spectra under aqueous conditions and therefore contain β-sheet structure. On the other hand, cyclic peptides containing either 8 or 12 residues exhibit completely different spectra than GS, the most noticeable difference being a substantially reduced ellipticity in the range 210-225 nm, indicating a largely disordered structure. All 12-residue peptides exhibited similar disordered CD spectra (data not shown). This periodicity of β-structure as a function of ring size has been confirmed in our laboratory by 1H NMR spectroscopy using the chemical shift index (35Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2024) Google Scholar) and detailed analysis of coupling constants. Complete NMR assignments and final structure calculations are in progress. 2D. S. Wishart, L. H. Kondejewski, R. S. Hodges, and B. D. Sykes, manuscript in preparation. Models of 10-, 12-, and 14-residue peptides constructed to contain an antiparallel β-sheet structure and two type IIʹβ-turns as found in GS are shown in Fig. 2. From these models it is apparent that the N and C termini of the 10- and 14-residue peptides are in close proximity and will likely maintain the specified β-structure upon cyclization of the termini. The N and C termini of the 12-residue peptide on the other hand are far apart. Although the termini can be chemically linked during cyclization of the peptides, this will lead to severe distortion of the β-sheet structure in the 12-residue peptides. Furthermore, no combination of β-turn types could bring the termini together in the 12-residue peptide. These models show that the basis of the periodicity in β-structure seen by CD spectroscopy lies in the number of residues contained within the strands of these cyclic peptides. There is an absolute requirement for an odd number of residues between residues i + 2 and i + 1 of the two turns to maintain β-strand character in cyclic peptides. Earlier work has shown that agar-based assays severely underestimate antifungal activity as well as activity against Gram-negative microorganisms (3Kondejewski L.H. Farmer S.W. Wishart D.S. Hancock R.E.W. Hodges R.S. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1996; 47: 460-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Consequently, a liquid-broth method was used to measure the antibiotic properties of the peptides reported in this study as shown in Table II and summarized in Table I. GS analogs composed of either 4, 6, or 8 residues (GS4, GS6, and GS8) were found to be completely inactive against all microorganisms tested. The 10-residue peptide containing the D-Phe to D-Tyr and Orn to Lys substitutions (GS10) exhibited slightly weaker antibacterial and antifungal activity compared with GS. Extension of the GS ring to contain two more Lys residues (GS12) resulted in an activity profile slightly weaker than GS10 against Gram-negative microorganisms and yeast and substantially reduced activity against Gram-positive microorganisms. Further extension of the ring to 14 residues (GS14) resulted in a product that was inactive against most microorganisms.Table II.Antibiotic activity of cyclic GS ring analogsPeptidebGS4, GS6, and GS8 showed no antibiotic activity.Antibiotic activityaMinimum inhibitory concentration (μg/ml).Gram-nega"

Adducin contains N-terminal core, neck, and C-terminal tail domains, is a substrate for protein kinases A (PKA) and C (PKC), and binds to Ca2+/calmodulin. Ser-726 and Ser-713 in the C-terminal MARCKS-related domains of α- and β-adducin, respectively, were identified as the major phosphorylation sites common for PKA and PKC. PKA, in addition, phosphorylated α-adducin at Ser-408, -436, and -481 in the neck domain. Phosphorylation by PKA, but not PKC, reduced the affinity of adducin for spectrin-F-actin complexes as well as the activity of adducin in promoting binding of spectrin to F-actin. The myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate-related domain of β-adducin was identified as the dominant Ca2+-dependent calmodulin-binding site. Calmodulin-binding was inhibited by phosphorylation of β-adducin and of a MARCKS-related domain peptide by PKA and PKC. Calmodulin in turn inhibited the rate, but not the extent, of phosphorylation of β-adducin, but not α-adducin, by PKA and that of each subunit by PKC. These findings suggest a complex reciprocal relationship between regulation of adducin function by calmodulin binding and phosphorylation by PKA and PKC.

C termini of all three subunits contain a highly basic stretch of 22 amino acids with sequence similarity to the myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS) (11Joshi R. Gilligan D.M. Otto E. McLaughlin T. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 13Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Erythrocyte adducin in solution is a mixture of heterodimers and tetramers with α and β subunit head domains in contact to form a globular core, and interacting α- and β-adducin tails extended away from the core (14Hughes C.A. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18990-18996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Tail domains of both the α- and β-adducin subunits are responsible for binding to spectrin-actin complexes (14Hughes C.A. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18990-18996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and have been proposed to form lateral contacts involving several actin subunits and the β subunit of spectrin (15Li X. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15695-15702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Ca2+/calmodulin preferentially associates with β-adducin (2Gardner K. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1339-1348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and inhibits the recruitment of additional spectrin molecules to adducin-spectrin-F-actin ternary complexes by adducin (6Gardner K. Bennett V. Nature. 1987; 328: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), as well as the ability of adducin to cap actin filaments (8Kuhlman P.A. Hughes C.A. Bennett V. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7986-7991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). A potential calmodulin-binding site has been localized to residues 425-444 in the neck domain of β-adducin (16Scaramuzzino D.A. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3398-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, the 18-mer peptide corresponding to the MARCKS-related domain of adducin, which includes residues 718-734 of the α tail and residues 705-721 of the β tail, also binds to calmodulin. 2P. J. Blackshear, unpublished data. This study defines the major phosphorylation sites for PKA and PKC in erythrocyte adducin and presents evidence that the dominant site for binding to calmodulin is located in the MARCKS-related domain of adducin. Although adducin is a substrate for PKA and PKC in vitro and in vivo, neither functional consequences nor the site(s) of phosphorylation have been elucidated. Functional consequences of phosphorylation reported here include modulation of adducin interactions with spectrin and actin by PKA and inhibition of calmodulin binding by PKA and PKC. These findings suggest a complex reciprocal relationship between regulation of adducin function by calmodulin binding and phosphorylation by PKA and PKC. Rabbit muscle actin, bovine brain spectrin, bovine brain calmodulin, and erythrocyte adducin were isolated essentially as described (14Hughes C.A. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18990-18996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Prior to phosphorylation, adducin and recombinant adducin constructs were dialyzed against 10 mM HEPES-NaOH, 2 mM Na-EGTA, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.3, overnight at 4°C. The catalytic subunit of PKA was prepared from bovine heart (18Beavo J.A. Bechtel P.J. Krebs E.G. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 38: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), and PKC was prepared from rat brain (19Inagaki M. Watanabe M. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2922-2925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding the full-length human α- and β-adducin genes were cloned into the pGEMEX expression vector, a pET plasmid with a T7 promoter (20Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorf J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). A unique NheI restriction site was generated by polymerase chain reaction. The construct was inserted into the NheI site immediately 3ʹ to the AUG codon so that the expressed polypeptide has the additional amino acid sequence Met-Ala-Ser on the amino terminus (14Hughes C.A. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18990-18996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The α- and β-adducin polypeptides were isolated from inclusion bodies and solubilized in a buffer containing 8 M urea, 10 mM sodium phosphate, 1 M NaBr, 1 mM NaEDTA, 10 mM glycine, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4. Soluble protein (140,000 x g supernatant) was applied to a Superose 12 column equilibrated with 4 M urea, 10 mM sodium phosphate, 1 M NaBr, 1 mM Na-EDTA, 10 mM glycine, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4. Fractions were dialyzed against the 4 M urea column buffer with no salt, applied to a Mono S column, and eluted with a linear gradient of 0-0.5 M NaBr in 4 M urea buffer. Both α- and β-adducin eluted at 0.35-0.4 M NaBr and were renatured over several days by dialysis against a buffer containing 10% sucrose, 10 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl,1 mM Na-EGTA, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM NaN3, pH 7.4. Recombinant human α- (residues 430-737) and β- (residues 409-726) adducin neck/tail constructs were expressed as soluble proteins and purified as described (14Hughes C.A. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18990-18996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). A purified 31-amino acid synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 696-726 of human β-adducin (GSPSKSPSKKKKKFRTPSFLKKSKKKEKVES) was greater than 95% pure as determined by C18 reverse phase column HPLC. The sequence of the peptide was confirmed by amino acid sequence analysis, and the concentration of the peptide was determined by amino acid composition analysis. Erythrocyte adducin (1.25 μM), recombinant α- and β-adducin (2.5 μM), and recombinant α- and β-adducin neck/tails (5.9 μM) were phosphorylated by incubation with 20 μg/ml PKA, 0.1 mM [γ-32P]ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, 25 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.3, at 25°C. For PKC phosphorylation, each polypeptide was incubated with 10 μg/ml PKC, 0.1 mM [γ-32P]ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, 50 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 0.1 μg/ml 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, 25 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.3, at 25°C. The reaction was terminated by adding an equal volume of a stock solution containing 2% SDS, 80 mM DTT, 10% sucrose, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8. The sample was then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel (3.5-17%) electrophoresis (21Fairbanks G. Steck T. Wallach D. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2606-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (6177) Google Scholar). The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, and the band of each polypeptide was excised and counted for 32P in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter. In some experiments, the phosphorylation reaction was carried out under different conditions as indicated. The 31-mer β-adducin peptide (0.1 mM) was phosphorylated by PKA and PKC under the same conditions as above except using 0.5 mM [γ-32P]ATP for 6 h at 15°C. Stoichiometry of the phosphorylation was assessed following 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207523) Google Scholar). PKA- and PKC-phosphorylated adducin (0.5 mg) were isolated by S-Sepharose column chromatography as described above, and were digested with V8 protease (1:50 (w/w), Pierce) for 3 h at 30°C. Samples were applied to a C18 reverse phase column (2.1 x 220 mm, ABI), which was eluted with a linear gradient of 0-50% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 100 min followed by a further linear gradient of 50-100% acetonitrile over 20 min at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. After lyophilization, the 32P-labeled fragments were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 100 mM NH4HCO3, pH 8.4, and digested with α-chymotrypsin (1 μg, Sigma) for 3 h at 30°C. The sample was diluted with 1 volume of 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid, applied to the same column, and chromatographed with the same linear gradient. The purified radioactive fragments (1-3 nmol) were treated with 100 μl of solution consisting of 9.9 μl of ethanethiol, 33.1 μl of water, 33.1 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide, 13.2 μl of ethanol, and 10.7 μl of 5 N NaOH at 50°C for 1 h as described by Meyer et al. (23Meyer H.E. Hoffmann-Posorske E. Korte H. Heilmeyer L.M.G. FEBS Lett. 1986; 204: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In this condition, a phosphoserine residue is specifically converted into S-ethylcysteine and can be detected by amino acid sequence analysis. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as described (24Kusubata M. Matsuoka Y. Tsujimura K. Ito H. Ando S. Kamijo M. Yasuda H. Ohba Y. Okumura E. Kishimoto T. Inagaki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 927-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Sequences of phosphopeptides were determined by automated Edman degradation and confirmed with the amino acid sequences derived from the cDNAs of α- and β-adducin. 5-Dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl-(dansyl)-calmodulin (CaM-DANS) was prepared, and fluorescence studies were conducted as described (25Johnson J.D. Wittenauer L.A. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Microliter additions of recombinant adducin constructs or peptide were made to 2 ml of 10 mM MOPS, 90 mM KCl, 0.3 mM CaCl2, 0.1 mM EGTA, 3 mM MgCl2, pH 7.0, with the indicated concentration of CaM-DANS. The excitation wavelength was 340 nm, and emission was monitored at 480 nm with a spectrofluorophotometer. 125I-Azidocalmodulin binding was determined as described (2Gardner K. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1339-1348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stoichiometries and Km of adducin phosphorylation by the purified kinases were measured in Fig. 1. Time courses of phosphorylation of α- and β-adducin subunits by PKA and PKC are shown in Fig. 1, A and B. PKA phosphorylated the α and β subunits of adducin at a 2:1 ratio, and maximal stoichiometries of 2 mol of Pi/mol of α subunit, 1 mol of Pi/mol of β subunit. Thus, 3 mol of Pi/mol of adducin dimer was observed (Fig. 1A). Protein kinase C incorporated 0.8 mol of phosphate into 1 mol of each subunit at the end of 2 h (Fig. 1B). Using a higher concentration of the kinase, approximately 1 mol of phosphate was incorporated per mol of each subunit. The Km values of PKA and PKC for adducin were determined based on initial rates of phosphorylation as a function of adducin concentration (Fig. 1, C and D). Fig. 1, C and D, shows double-reciprocal plot analysis for adducin phosphorylation by PKA and PKC as a function of adducin concentration; these curves are representative of three separate experiments. The Km and Vmax values of PKA for adducin were 7.0 μM and 333 nmol/min/mg, respectively, compared with 0.8 μM and 3.8 nmol/min/mg for PKC at 25°C. For comparison, PKA utilizes histone H2B as a substrate with a Km of 32 μM (26Bylund D.B. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6355-6361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), troponin with a Km of 21 μM (27Blumenthal D.K. Stull J.T. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 334-336Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), and kemptide (LRRASLG) with a Km of 8 μM (28Kemp B.E. Graves D.J. Benjamini E. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4888-4894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A PKC mixture isolated from rat brain utilizes MARCKS with a Km of 0.4-0.8 μM (29Gandy S. Czernik A. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6218-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Adducin, therefore, is a good substrate for PKA and an excellent substrate for PKC. Ser-726 and Ser-713 in the C-terminal MARCKS-related domains of α- and β-adducin, respectively, were identified as the major phosphorylation sites for PKC. PKC-phosphorylated native adducin (0.8 mol of Pi/mol of adducin subunit) was first digested with V8 protease. One major radioactive peak was obtained in the HPLC procedure (Fig. 2A). This major V8 fragment was further digested by α-chymotrypsin, and chymotryptic fragments were again separated by the same HPLC procedure. One major radioactive peak was separated, and the sequence obtained from this fraction was RTPSFL, corresponding to residues 723-728 and residues 710-715 of the C-terminal tail domains of human α- and β-adducin, respectively. The relative amount of 32P in the second major peak was estimated as 57% of the total radioactivity. Phosphoamino acid analysis of adducin phosphorylated by PKC showed only the presence of phosphoserine as the phosphoamino acid (Fig. 2B). Since the phosphopeptide contained a single serine residue, Ser-726 of α-adducin and Ser-713 of β-adducin were considered to be the major phosphorylation sites for PKC. The amino acid sequences in α- and β-adducin are identical in this region (11Joshi R. Gilligan D.M. Otto E. McLaughlin T. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Ser-703 (β-adducin) and, by inference, Ser-716 (α-adducin) were identified as secondary sites of phosphorylation by analysis of PKC-phosphorylated recombinant β-adducin. A V8 protease/chymotrypsin digest of the phospho-β-adducin yielded two radioactive peaks. Both peptides contained phosphoserine as the only phosphorylated amino acid (data not shown). The major peak contained the sequence 710RTPSFL715, corresponding to the phosphopeptide identified above in native adducin. The second, less abundant peptide had the sequence 696GSPSKSPSKKKKKF709, with four serine residues. Ser-703 of β-adducin was identified as the phosphorylation site, since S-ethylcysteine converted from phosphoserine by ethanethiol treatment was only detected at position 8 in this peptide (data not shown). Since Ser-703 of β-adducin is located in the region where the amino acid sequence is identical to that of α-adducin, Ser-716 of α-adducin is also a probable phosphorylation site for PKC. Ser-726 and Ser-713 in the C-terminal MARCKS-related domains of α and β-adducin, respectively, were identified as the major phosphorylation sites common for protein kinases A and C. Protein kinase A, in addition, phosphorylated α-adducin in the neck domain at Ser-408, -436, and -481. Minor sites for PKA include Ser-59 and Thr-55 in the α and β N-terminal head domains, respectively. Recombinant α- and β-adducin constructs were employed to identify the phosphorylation sites for PKA in each subunit due to difficulty in resolving phosphopeptides derived from the combined α and β subunits of erythrocyte adducin. α-adducin (2.5 mol of Pi/mol of subunit) and β-adducin (1.2 mol of Pi/mol of subunit) phosphorylated by PKA were first digested by V8 protease. Three and two major radioactive peaks were obtained from the α- and β-adducin, respectively, in the HPLC procedure (Figs. 3A and 4A). Each of the isolated fragments was further digested by α-chymotrypsin, and peptides were separated by the same HPLC procedure. The amino acid sequences from major radioactive peaks were as given in Table I., Table II.. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the V8 fragments from PKA-phosphorylated adducin showed the presence of only phosphoserines except fragment β2, in which phosphothreonine was the phosphoamino acid (Figs. 3B and 4B). Since phosphopeptides α1ʹ, α2ʹ-1, and β1ʹ and phosphopeptide β2 contained single serine residues and a single threonine residue, respectively, Ser-726 and Ser-436 of α-adducin and Ser-713 and Thr-55 of β-adducin were identified as the PKA phosphorylation sites (Table I., Table II.).Fig. 4Reverse phase HPLC and phosphoamino acid analysis for PKA-phosphorylated recombinant β-adducin. A, reverse phase HPLC for V8 fragments of PKA-phosphorylated β-adducin was carried out under the same condition as that for α-adducin. No significant amount of radioactivity was detected during the first 20 min. B, phosphoamino acid analysis for the major V8 fragments of β-adducin separated by HPLC. The positions of phosphoserine (P-Ser), phosphothreonine (P-Thr), phosphotyrosine (P-Tyr), and inorganic phosphate (Pi) are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table I.Amino acid sequences of phosphopeptides derived from PKA-phosphorylated α-adducinPeptideaPeptides α1ʹ, 2ʹ, and 4ʹ were derived from chymotryptic digestion of peptides α1, 2, and 4, respectively.Amino acid sequencebResidue numbers correspond to human α-adducin (11).Relative amountcDetermined from radioactivity in the HPLC analysis as shown in Fig. 3.

Total is not 100% because the amount of minor peaks is excluded. Open table in a new tab Since phosphopeptides α2ʹ-2, α3, and α4ʹ had more than two serine residues, the exact phosphorylation sites were defined by treating the phosphopeptides with ethanethiol in an alkaline condition to convert specifically phosphoserine to S-ethylcysteine (30Matsuoka Y. Nishizawa K. Yano T. Shibata M. Ando S. Takahashi T. Inagaki M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2895-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The high release of S-ethylcysteine was observed at the 6th cycles for both peptides α3 and α4ʹ, indicating that the phosphates were located on Ser-59 and Ser-481 of α-adducin (data not shown). S-ethylcysteine was not detected for peptide α2ʹ-2 treated with ethanethiol. It has been reported that if a phosphoserine residue possesses a free amino or carboxyl terminus, no transformation into S-ethylcysteine will occur (23Meyer H.E. Hoffmann-Posorske E. Korte H. Heilmeyer L.M.G. FEBS Lett. 1986; 204: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Since this peptide had a serine residue (Ser-408) at the amino-terminal position, Ser-408 was predicted to be the phosphoserine residue. This was finally confirmed by the release of S-ethylcysteine at the 6th cycle for V8 fragment α2 (403KSKKYSDV-) treated with ethanethiol (data not shown). All of the identified phosphorylation sites of adducin for PKA and PKC conform to the known recognition sequences of both kinases (Arg/Lys-Arg/Lys-X-Ser/Thr or Arg/Lys-X-Ser/Thr for PKA and Arg/Lys-X-X-Ser/Thr-X-Arg/Lys for PKC) (31Woodgett J.R. Protein Kinases. IRL Press, Oxford1994: 30Google Scholar, 32Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 342-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). The lysine residue at the carboxyl-terminal side to the major PKC-phosphorylated serine in adducin (RTPSFLK) is displaced by one residue from the consensus sequence for PKC. However, several other examples that have a basic residue at the same position analogous to the adducin site have been reported (33Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 34House C. Wettenhall R.E.H. Kemp B.E. J. Biol.

An adjacent hydrophobic amino acid (especially Leu and Phe) on the carboxyl-terminal side of the phosphorylation site is very important for a high affinity interaction of PKC with the substrate (33Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 36Graff J.M. Stumpo D.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11912-11919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKA phosphorylation of adducin reduced activity of adducin in association with spectrin-actin complexes and in promoting binding of spectrin to F-actin. PKC phosphorylation, in contrast, had no measurable effect on adducin activities (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). PKA-phosphorylated adducin (3 mol of Pi/mol of dimer) displayed a 3-4-fold lower affinity for spectrin-actin complexes (KD = 570 nM) than that of the unphosphorylated adducin (KD = 150 nM). In contrast, the affinity (KD = 200 nM) of PKC-phosphorylated adducin (2 mol of Pi/mol of dimer) was the same as that of the unphosphorylated adducin. Neither PKA nor PKC phosphorylation affected the capacity of adducin bound to spectrin-actin complexes (Fig. 5B). PKA-phosphorylated adducin also displayed a 3-fold lower activity in promoting binding of spectrin to F-actin (half-maximal stimulation at 240 nM) than the unphosphorylated adducin (half-maximal stimulation at 80 nM). The final amount of spectrin recruited to F-actin was the same in both cases (Fig. 6, A and B). In contrast, the activity of the unphosphorylated and the PKC-phosphorylated adducin were the same (both with half-maximal activation at 100 nM), and equivalent amounts of spectrin were recruited (Fig. 6, C and D). Phosphorylation of adducin by PKA and PKC did not affect binding of adducin to F-actin (data not shown).Fig. 6Promotion of spectrin binding to F-actin by nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated adducin. 125I-labeled bovine brain spectrin (3 nM, 7.41 x 105 cpm/pmol) was incubated with 3 μM F-actin and increasing concentrations of nonphosphorylated adducin (○), PKA-phosphorylated adducin (3 mo"
https://openalex.org/W2081698610,"Insulin stimulates glucose transport in its target cells by recruiting the glucose transporter Glut 4 from an intracellular compartment to the cell surface. Previous studies have indicated that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) is a necessary step in this insulin action. We have investigated whether PI 3-kinase activation is sufficient to promote Glut 4 translocation in transiently transfected adipocytes. Rat adipose cells were cotransfected with expression vectors that allowed transient expression of epitope-tagged Glut 4 and a constitutively active form of PI 3-kinase (p110*). The expression of p110* induced the appearance of epitope-tagged Glut 4 at the cell surface at a level similar to that obtained after insulin treatment, whereas a kinase-dead version of p110* had no effect. The p110* effect was observed over a wide range of the transfected cDNA. When subcellular fractionation of adipocytes was performed, p110* was found, similar to the endogenous PI 3-kinase, enriched in the low density microsomal compartment, which also contains the Glut 4 vesicles. This could suggest that a specific localization of PI 3-kinase in this compartment is required for the action on Glut 4. The observations made with PI 3-kinase are in contrast with those seen with the MAP kinase cascade. Indeed, a constitutively active form of MAP kinase kinase had no effect on Glut 4 translocation in basal conditions. At the highest degree of expression, the constitutively active form of MAP kinase kinase slightly inhibited the insulin stimulation of Glut 4 translocation. Taken together, our results indicate that Glut 4 translocation can be efficiently promoted by an active form of PI 3-kinase but not by the activation of the MAP kinase pathway. Insulin stimulates glucose transport in its target cells by recruiting the glucose transporter Glut 4 from an intracellular compartment to the cell surface. Previous studies have indicated that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) is a necessary step in this insulin action. We have investigated whether PI 3-kinase activation is sufficient to promote Glut 4 translocation in transiently transfected adipocytes. Rat adipose cells were cotransfected with expression vectors that allowed transient expression of epitope-tagged Glut 4 and a constitutively active form of PI 3-kinase (p110*). The expression of p110* induced the appearance of epitope-tagged Glut 4 at the cell surface at a level similar to that obtained after insulin treatment, whereas a kinase-dead version of p110* had no effect. The p110* effect was observed over a wide range of the transfected cDNA. When subcellular fractionation of adipocytes was performed, p110* was found, similar to the endogenous PI 3-kinase, enriched in the low density microsomal compartment, which also contains the Glut 4 vesicles. This could suggest that a specific localization of PI 3-kinase in this compartment is required for the action on Glut 4. The observations made with PI 3-kinase are in contrast with those seen with the MAP kinase cascade. Indeed, a constitutively active form of MAP kinase kinase had no effect on Glut 4 translocation in basal conditions. At the highest degree of expression, the constitutively active form of MAP kinase kinase slightly inhibited the insulin stimulation of Glut 4 translocation. Taken together, our results indicate that Glut 4 translocation can be efficiently promoted by an active form of PI 3-kinase but not by the activation of the MAP kinase pathway."

Expression of Pdr5 and Snq2 is regulated by the two transcription factors Pdr1 and Pdr3, as multidrug-resistant pdr1 and pdr3 gain-of-function mutants overexpress both drug efflux pumps. One such pdr1 mutant allele was previously cloned in a genetic screen by its ability to suppress the squelching toxicity mediated by an estradiol-inducible chimeric VP16-human estrogen receptor (VEO) expressed in yeast (Gilbert, D. M., Heery, D. M., Losson, R., Chambon, P., and Lemoine, Y. (1993) Mol. Cell. Biol. 13, 462-472).In this study, we demonstrate that relief of estradiol toxicity in yeast cells expressing VEO requires functional PDR5 and SNQ2 genes, since a Δpdr5 Δsnq2 double deletion leads to an increased estradiol toxicity. Furthermore, using URA3 as an estradiol-inducible reporter gene, we show that Pdr5 and Snq2, when overexpressed from high-copy plasmids, can reduce the intracellular concentration of estradiol. In contrast, a Δpdr5 Δsnq2 double deletion mutant accumulates almost 30-fold more intracellular estradiol than the isogenic wild type. Indirect immunofluorescence showed that a pdr1-3 mutant massively overexpresses Pdr5 at the plasma membrane, suggesting that estradiol efflux from the cells occurs across the plasma membrane. Our data demonstrate that Pdr5 and Snq2 can transport steroid substrates in vivo and suggest that steroids and/or related membrane lipids could represent physiological substrates for certain yeast ABC transporters, which are otherwise involved in the development of pleiotropic drug resistance.

https://openalex.org/W2089360679,"Proteins in commercial latex products, derived from the rubber tree Hevea brasiliensis, cause anaphylaxis in susceptible individuals, especially health care workers and children with spina bifida. To identify latex allergens, we utilized IgE from the serum of a latex-allergic health care worker to screen a cDNA library from Hevea latex. The identified cDNA clone, cDNA Hev b 5, encodes an open reading frame of 163 peptide residues. Hybridization analysis of cDNA Hev b 5 with RNA extracted from Hevea tissue indicates that the full-length transcript is about 1000 bases. The nucleotide and deduced protein sequences have significant homology to sequences from kiwi and potato, which are known to cause allergic reactions in some latex-allergic patients. Fifty-six percent of spina bifida patients and 92% of health care workers with latex allergy have IgE specific to the protein encoded by cDNA Hev b 5. A monoclonal antibody raised from a mouse immunized with Hev b 5 binds to a protein in Hevea latex with an Mr identical to that of the expressed and cleaved recombinant protein.

Natural rubber latex in medical devices and consumer products has been implicated in over 1100 anaphylactic reactions that resulted in at least 15 deaths between 1988 and 1992 (1Gelb L.

A., (1992) International Latex Conference: Sensitivity to Latex in Medical Devices, Baltimore, p. 23 (abstr.).Google Scholar). These reactions are caused by proteins that elute from the surfaces of certain latex products, especially gloves, barium enema catheters, balloons, and condoms. The proteins bind to antigen-specific IgE on tissue mast cells and trigger an anaphylactic response. While the production of IgE to latex proteins can occur in any individual, some individuals with uniquely high exposure to latex products appear to be at significantly greater risk for the production of these antibodies than the general population. These include health care workers and children with spina bifida (3Slater J.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 4Levy D.A. Charpin D. Pecquet C.

Interestingly, there appears to be significant clinical and immunochemical cross-reactivity between some latex proteins and allergens in certain fruits and vegetables, such as banana, kiwi, avocado, and potato, and patients with fruit and vegetable allergy may be at increased risk for reacting to latex proteins (6M'Raihi L.

Since anaphylactic episodes have occurred following skin testing with crude latex extracts (13Kelly K.J. Kurup V. Zacharisen M. Resnick A. Fink J.N. J. Allergy Clin.

The identification and isolation of pure antigens, and the analysis of the B- and T-cell epitopes of these antigens, will facilitate the design and testing of safer regimens of immunotherapy. The proteins in natural rubber latex are derived from the commercial rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis. Latex is produced in laticifers, which are specialized structures that consist of anastamosed latex-producing cells. Harvested Hevea latex is a complete cytosol with a high protein content (17St. Cyr D.R. Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1992: 468Google Scholar, 18Kekwick R.G.O. d'Auzac J. Jacob J.-L. Chrestin H. Physiology of Rubber Tree Latex. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 145Google Scholar). Hevea latex is typically ammoniated when tapped to prevent premature coagulation and bacterial growth. Ammoniated latex is the source material for most of the products that elicit allergic reactions; thus, it clearly contains immunogenic material. However, immunochemical studies with ammoniated latex have failed to reveal the wealth of IgE-binding proteins found in non-ammoniated latex (NAL) 1The abbreviations used are: NALnon-ammoniated latexcDNA Hev b 5screened DNA sequence from the H. brasiliensis cDNA libraryrHev b 5recombinant Hevea peptide encoded by cDNA Hev b 5MBPmaltose-binding proteinrHev b 5/MBPfusion protein expressed by pMAL c-2/Hev b 5, with rHev b 5 on the COOH terminus, and MBP on the NH2 terminusPVDFpolyvinylene difluoridePCRpolymerase chain reactionRASTradioallergosorbent testPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisCAPS3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acidHCWhealth care workerSBspina bifidabpbase pair(s)RACErapid amplification of cDNA ends.

From the first observations that products made from Hevea latex can elicit catastrophic allergic reactions in susceptible individuals, the component allergens have eluded conclusive identification. In part, this has been due to the complexity and instability of the proteins of Hevea latex. In addition, many investigators have been unable to obtain quantities of fresh material for examination and have been limited to the use of finished products or ammoniated latex (19Slater J.E.

In each of these investigations, protein has been isolated from natural Hevea latex or from finished products (usually gloves) and identified as an allergen by Western blot, radioallergosorbent testing (RAST), or RAST inhibition, using sera from latex-allergic individuals. In our earlier work using NAL, monoclonal antibodies detected peptides of several sizes by Western blot analysis and affinity purification techniques (31Slater J.E. Trybul D.E. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1994; 93: 644-649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), an observation confirmed by other investigators (32Lu L. Kurup V.P. Kelly K.J. Fink J.N. Allergy. 1995; 50: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). One possible explanation of this result is that many of the peptide bands observed in NAL were cleavage products of larger, parent proteins; other explanations are that several proteins contain the epitopes recognized by the monoclonals or that latex proteins aggregate under conditions of standard electrophoretic analysis. This limits the value of Western blot analysis (19Slater J.E. Chhabra S.K. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1992; 89: 673-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 33Alenius H.

We therefore screened a Hevea cDNA library with IgE from a latex-allergic patient, with the intent of isolating and expressing the gene product of the cDNA clone for further study. Sera were obtained from health care workers (n = 38) and children with spina bifida (n = 82), as part of a study approved by the Children's Hospital Institutional Review Board. Except for 14 of the health care workers (nHCW), all of the health care workers (HCW) in the study study had reported symptomatic type I allergic reactions to latex and were tested for evidence of latex-specific IgE by RAST (19Slater J.E. Chhabra S.K. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1992; 89: 673-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Because of their high risk of developing symptomatic latex allergy (5Slater J.E. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1994; 94: 139-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), sera were obtained from consecutive spina bifida (SB) patients without regard to clinical history. The serum of one HCW was selected for use in screening the cDNA library. This patient had experienced recurrent episodes of urticaria, rhinoconjunctivitis, and wheezing following exposure to latex gloves, and had been asymptomatic since following strict latex avoidance measures. The patient had no history of allergy or intolerance to fruits or other foods. The serum was positive for latex-specific IgE by RAST (19Slater J.E. Chhabra S.K. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1992; 89: 673-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The cDNA library, cloned in bacteriophage λ gt11, had been derived from mRNA isolated from the latex of H. brasiliensis clone RRIM 600 (22Attanyaka D.P. Kekwick R.G. Franklin F.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 16: 1079-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli Y1090 cells were infected with recombinant λ phage containing the Hevea cDNA library and plated. After 4 h at 42°C, the cultures were overlaid with nitrocellulose filters that had been impregnated with 10 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactoside, and incubated overnight at 37°C. The filters were lifted, blocked, and incubated in E. coli-adsorbed patient serum (1:5, v/v, in blocking solution) overnight at 4°C. Filters were then washed and incubated in goat anti-human IgE conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (1:500; Kirkegaard & Perry, Gaithersburg, MD). After extensive washing, the filters were developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (Life Technologies, Inc.) (36Arruda L.K. Vailes L.D. Hayden M.L. Benjamin D.C. Chapman M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31196-31201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Positive clones were verified, and the plaques were isolated and expanded. The target sequences of the clones were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using λ forward and reverse primers (Promega), and analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis and partial thermocycle sequencing (CircumVent, New England Biolabs) with the λ primers. One of these PCR-amplified products, designated cDNA Hev b 5 (37King T.P. Hoffman D. Lowenstein H. Marsh D.G. Platts-Mills T.A.E. Thomas W. Allergy. 1995; 50: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), was chosen for further analysis. The sequence cDNA Hev b 5 was inserted into the pMAL-c2 vector according to manufacturer's directions (New England Biolabs). The ligated pMAL-c2/Hev b 5 was inserted into competent XL1 blue E. coli (Stratagene), which were then grown and replica-plated onto an isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactoside/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside plate containing ampicillin. In order to identify those clones containing sense inserts, white colonies were screened by the binding of IgE from the serum used to screen the library (38Helfman D.M. Feramisco J.R. Fiddes J.C. Thomas G.P. Hughes S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). As expected, about half of the white colonies that were screened expressed protein that bound to the IgE of the test patient. RNA was extracted from H. brasiliensis leaf and stem tissue (39Schultz D.J. Craig R. Cox-Foster D.L. Mumma R.O. Medford J.I. Plant Mol. Biol. Reporter. 1994; 12: 310-316Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar), (gift of K. Cornish and D. Siler, Albany, CA) obtained from 4-year-old trees grown from clone PB260. The RNA was separated by electrophoresis in a 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gel and transferred to a GeneScreen Plus membrane (DuPont NEN). The membrane was then probed overnight at 42°C with cDNA Hev b 5 that had been 32P-labeled by the random primer labeling technique, using exo(-) Klenow enzyme and [α-32P]dCTP (Prime-It II, Stratagene). The ends of cDNA Hev b 5 were extended by the 5ʹ- and 3ʹ-RACE techniques (Life Technologies, Inc.). For the 5ʹ end extension, 1 μg of Hevea RNA was incubated with reverse transcriptase (SuperScript, Life Technologies, Inc.) using the primer sequence 5ʹ-AGAGTCAGTCTTTGAGCC-3ʹ. The cDNA was isolated from the primer and RNA, and a poly(C) tail was formed with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase according to manufacturer's directions. The cDNA was amplified by PCR using an anchor primer (5ʹ-CUACUACUACUAGGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACGGGIIGGGIIGGGIIG-3ʹ) and 5ʹ-AGAGTCAGTCTTTGAGCC-3ʹ, and then again with the nested primers 5ʹ-CUACUACUACUAGGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC-3ʹ and 5ʹ-CAUCAUCAUCAUTCCTCTGGAGTCGTTTGATCTGC-3ʹ. The PCR product was separated on a 2% agarose gel (NuSieve GTG, FMC Bioproducts); the largest band (about 400 bp) was excised and the DNA isolated using a centrifugal filtration device (Ultrafree-MC, Millipore). For extension of the 3ʹ end, 1 μg of Hevea RNA was incubated with reverse transcriptase and an adapter primer (5ʹ-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC(T)17-3ʹ). The sequence was then amplified by PCR using 5ʹ-CAUCAUCAUCAUTGGCCAGTGTTGAGGTTGAA-3ʹ and 5ʹ-CUACUACUACUAGGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC-3ʹ. The PCR product was separated on an agarose gel and purified. Both the 3ʹ-RACE and 5ʹ-RACE products were inserted into the pAMP1 plasmid using uracil DNA glycosylase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Both the pAMP1 RACE products and the pMAL c-2/Hev b 5 plasmids were inserted into competent XL1 blue E. coli, and the plasmids were isolated from broth cultures using Qiagen tips according to manufacturer's directions. DNA sequences were determined using T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase 2.0, U. S. Biochemical Corp.) using overlapping forward and reverse primers. Broth cultures of the XL1 blue E. coli containing pMAL-c2/Hev b 5 were grown in the presence of isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactoside. Inserts cloned into the pMAL plasmid are expressed in the open reading frame of the λ EcoRI site, as a fusion protein (rHev b 5/MBP) with the E. coli maltose-binding protein (MBP) on the amino terminus and the expressed insert gene on the carboxyl terminus, with a Factor Xa cleavage site between the two sequences. rHev b 5/MBP was adsorbed to an amylose resin, eluted with 10 mM maltose, and concentrated with a Centriprep 3 device. Cleavage of rHev b 5/MBP was performed by incubation with Factor Xa (1%, w/w) for 4 h at 20°C in the presence of 0.03% SDS. Cleavage products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) after denaturation in electrophoresis sample buffer containing 0.0625 M Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 5%β-mercaptoethanol. Alternatively, samples were electrophoresed in SDS-PAGE gels containing 4 M urea (40Hames B.D. Rickwood D. Gel Electrophoresis of Proteins. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1990Google Scholar) after denaturation in sample buffer containing 6.7 M urea instead of glycerol (41Aubert-Foucher E. Font B. Eichenberger D. Goldschmidt D. Lethias C. van der Rest M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15759-15764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleaved rHev b 5/MBP was separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylene difluoride membrane (PVDF, Millipore) in a CAPS/methanol buffer. After staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, the bands indicated were cut out and subjected to Edman degradation on an automated gas-phase sequencer (42Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). rHev b 5/MBP was bound to polyvinylchloride microtiter plates in coating buffer (0.1 M sodium carbonate/bicarbonate pH 9.6). Optimal binding of IgE in several sera was found to occur at 10 ng/well for rHev b 5/MBP, as compared with 1,000 ng/well for NAL. After overnight coating, the wells were blocked, incubated with patient sera diluted 1:3 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin, and finally with 125I-rabbit anti-human IgE (10 ng or 6,000 cpm total; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Positive binding was >1% of the total and at least 300% of negative control. Base-line counts were <20 cpm. For RAST inhibition, pooled sera were premixed with rHev b 5/MBP or control buffer and incubated overnight at 4°C. The sera were then added to polyvinyl chloride wells coated with rHev b 5/MBP, and developed as above. Hybridoma lines were produced from a BALB/c mouse immunized with rHev b 5/MBP in Freund's adjuvant, as described previously (31Slater J.E. Trybul D.E. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1994; 93: 644-649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cell lines were tested for production of antibody to rHev b 5/MBP, MBP, and NAL. In preliminary studies, hybridomas 7C10 and 17A10 produced detectable antibody to all three antigens by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, but only the antibody from 17A10 detected specific bands on Western analysis of latex proteins. Both cell lines generate antibody of the IgM class. Animal care and protocols were reviewed and approved by the Animal Research Committee of the Children's Research Institute. NAL (E8 extract) was obtained from Dr. Yuan DeVries (FDA/CBER, Bethesda, MD). NAL was prepared for analysis in sample buffer containing 6.7 M urea and electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE in a SDS-PAGE gel containing 4 M urea as described above. The separated peptides were transferred to a PVDF membrane in Towbin's buffer (43Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar), stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, cut into strips, and blocked for 30 min in 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5, containing nonfat dry milk (5%, w/v). After overnight incubation with tissue culture supernatant from either the 7C10 or 17A10 cell lines (10-2, v/v, in Tris/NaCl containing 1% bovine serum albumin), strips were washed and incubated for 2 h with peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgM (Kirkegaard & Perry) (10-5, in 1% bovine serum albumin). Strips were developed with a chemiluminescent peroxidase substrate (Supersignal CL-HRP, Pierce) according to manufacturer's directions. The Hevea latex cDNA library was screened with IgE from a latex-allergic health care worker. Five immunoreactive clones were identified and purified; DNA inserts were amplified by PCR using λ forward and reverse primers. All five clones contained inserts of about 900 bp. Partial sequence analysis confirmed clone homology. The complete DNA sequence of one of these clones, cDNA Hev b 5, was determined after insertion of the sequence into the pMAL-c2 vector. The sequence of clone cDNA Hev b 5 consists of 757 nucleotides, with an open reading frame 492 nucleotides in length that is in-frame with λgt11 fusion protein expression (Fig. 1). We were unable to obtain RNA from Hevea leaf and stem tissue by any of the standard, guanidinium thiocyanate-based techniques (44Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). However, using the method described by Schultz et al. (39Schultz D.J. Craig R. Cox-Foster D.L. Mumma R.O. Medford J.I. Plant Mol. Biol. Reporter. 1994; 12: 310-316Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar), in which contaminating polysaccharides and other secondary products are selectively precipitated, we isolated 0.25 mg/g of high quality Hevea leaf RNA for Northern analysis and extension of the cDNA ends. Hybridization analysis indicated that the full-length transcript of the cDNA Hev b 5 sequence is about 1000 nucleotides (Fig. 2). Using the RACE technique, we were able to identify an additional 50 bp at the 5ʹ end, and 32 bp on the 3ʹ end from first strand DNA, for a total of 839 bp. The 3ʹ-RACE extension contains a putative polyadenylation signal AATAAT 19 bases upstream of the poly(A) sequence (45Joshi C.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9627-9640Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The 5ʹ- and 3ʹ-untranslated regions are 89 and 295 bp long, respectively (Fig. 1). In order to ascertain whether cDNA Hev b 5 is unique, a nucleotide sequence search was performed (46Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). Although cDNA Hev b 5 appears to be unique, three strongly homologous regions with a recently reported cDNA sequence (pKIWI501) from Actinidia deliciosa, the kiwi fruit, were identified (Fig. 3A). The degree of identity is 80% over a region 75 bp long, 64% over a region 54 bp long, and 67% over a region 117 bp long. All three homologous regions lie within the putative open reading frames of both sequences (47Ledger S.E. Gardner R.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequences of Hev b 5 and pKIWI501 were analyzed for maximal alignment by a weighted dynamic programming method (48Sander C. Schneider R. Proteins. 1991; 9: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar). Overall, 46% of the deduced Hev b 5 sequence is identical to the aligned pKIWI501 sequence, with greatest homology at the amino and carboxyl termini (Fig. 3B). Other sequences with which Hev b 5 has significant homology are potato stolon tip protein (38%), pig neurofilament triplet L protein (36%), and rat myristoylated alanine-rich kinase C substrate (35%). In order to examine the immunoreactivity of the encoded protein, cDNA Hev b 5 was expressed as part of the pMAL-c2 fusion protein, rHev b 5/MBP. The yield was between 7 and 10 mg of rHev b 5/MBP/liter of broth, and purity after affinity chromatography on an amylose column was greater than 95% on SDS-PAGE. Under standard SDS-PAGE conditions, the Mr of affinity-purified rHev b 5/MBP was 81,000. Cleavage of rHev b 5/MBP with Factor Xa yielded two prominent bands of Mr 44,000 and 36,000 (Fig. 4). Sequence analysis indicated that the Mr 44,000 peptide is MBP, which is the leader sequence in pMAL fusion products. Edman analysis of the Mr 36,000 fragment yielded a sequence derived from the polylinker site in pMAL, the EcoRI adapters used in the initial library construction (22Attanyaka D.P. Kekwick R.G. Franklin F.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 16: 1079-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and serine, which is the first amino acid residue of the encoded recombinant peptide. Thus, the Mr 36,000 peptide is the recombinant Hevea polypeptide (rHev b 5) encoded by cDNA Hev b 5 (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Amino-terminal sequence analysis of rHev b 5/MBP and rHev b 5. The separated peptides shown in Fig. 4 were subjected to Edman degradation using an automated gas-phase sequenator. The published sequence for MBP is shown at the top. The experimentally determined amino-terminal sequences of the 81- and 45-kDa bands are shown below the MBP sequence in boldface type. The experimentally determined sequence of the 36 kDa band is shown at the bottom in boldface type as well, and is aligned with the predicted amino acid sequences of the expressed pMAL-c2 polylinker, EcoRI adapter (22Attanyaka D.P. Kekwick R.G. Franklin F.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 16: 1079-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and rHev b 5 (Fig. 1), which are underlined and shown above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The deduced amino acid sequence of rHev b 5 has a calculated molecular mass of 17,455 Da and a pI of 3.894, and contains 163 amino acid residues, of which 46 (28%) are glutamic acid, 29 (18%) are alanine, 23 (14%) are proline, and 21 (13%) are threonine. The deduced molecular mass is in contrast to the Mr of rHev b 5 of 36,000 on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4); this disparity has been noted for other proteins with high proline content (49Rasmussen H.B. APMIS Suppl. 1993; 39: 1-28PubMed Google Scholar) and low pI (40Hames B.D. Rickwood D. Gel Electrophoresis of Proteins. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1990Google Scholar). When digested rHev b 5/MBP was analyzed by SDS-PAGE in the presence of 4 M urea, the Mr of the rHev b 5 band decreased by 33% to 24,000; the MBP band remained at 44,000, but the undigested fusion protein migrated at about 66,000 (Fig. 6). This indicates that most of the discrepancy between the deduced molecular mass and the Mr of rHev b 5 (and rHev b 5/MBP) is due to incomplete denaturation resulting in aberrant migration (41Aubert-Foucher E. Font B. Eichenberger D. Goldschmidt D. Lethias C. van der Rest M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15759-15764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antigenicity of the rHev b 5 portion of rHev b 5/MBP was assessed by direct binding to rHev b 5/MBP by IgE of latex-allergic patients. When the sera of NAL RAST-positive patients were examined directly, significant binding to rHev b 5/MBP was noted in 12/13 (92%) of HCW and 32/57 (56%) of SB patients. In contrast, among NAL RAST-negative patients, only 2/10 (20%) of HCW and 3/25 (12%) of SB patients had rHev b 5-specific IgE by this assay (Fig. 7). None of the sera bound to MBP alone (data not shown). In order to demonstrate that the bound IgE in this assay was binding specifically to rHev b 5/MBP, we examined the effect of preincubating the pooled sera with soluble rHev b 5/MBP before adding the sera to the solid phase protein. At inhibiting concentrations of 1 μg/ml rHev b 5/MBP, 98% inhibition of solid phase binding was achieved with both the spina bifida and health care worker serum pools (Fig. 8). In order to confirm that rHev b 5 is a true latex antigen, and not just an antigen to which latex-allergic patients react coincidentally with native latex allergens, we immunized mice with rHev b 5/MBP and measured the anti-latex response. When BALB/c mice were immunized with rHev b 5/MBP, they made a vigorous IgG response to rHev b 5/MBP as well as to non-ammoniated latex (50Slater J.E. Arthur-Smith A. Trybul D.E. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1995; 95 (abstr.): 157Google Scholar). NAL was separated by SDS-PAGE under dissociating conditions and a Western blot was performed using a monoclonal antibody (17A10) from one such mouse. The E8 NAL extract used in this experiment is the reference material prepared by the FDA, and it contains both soluble and particle-bound Hevea proteins (24Akasawa A. Hsieh L.S. Lin Y. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1995; 95: 1196-1205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 51Akasawa A. Hsieh L.S. Lin Y. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1996; 97: 1116-1120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The antibody detected a distinct peptide band at about 23 kDa, as well as several fainter bands from 30-60 kDa; the control monoclonal antibody (7C10) failed to bind to any of the NAL proteins (Fig. 9). The use of the Hevea latex cDNA library has allowed us to examine a single, highly purified latex antigen in great detail. Northern analysis indicated that the full-length transcript of cDNA Hev b 5 is about 1000 nucleotides long; our attempts to extend the ends of the isolated cDNA clone yielded a sequence of 839 bp. It is likely that the remaining difference represents the poly(A) tail, although it is formally possible that cDNA Hev b 5 does not encode the full length of the antigen sequence. Nonetheless, two independent experiments indicate that the expressed protein will be a valuable tool for the analysis of the immune response to latex. First, most patients with latex allergy, and a large majority of HCWs with latex allergy, have IgE specific for Hev b 5 (Fig. 7). Second, a monoclonal antibody raised from a mouse injected with the Hev b 5 fusion protein recognizes protein bands in a natural latex extract, especially a band with an apparent molecular mass of 24,000, identical to that of the cleavage product of the fusion protein itself (Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9). A surprising result is the striking homology between cDNA Hev b 5 and a recently described cDNA clone from the kiwi (Fig. 3). Whether this homology is the reason for the observed clinical cross-reactivity of latex and certain fruit allergies is uncertain. Others have suggested that cross-reactivity among diverse plant species may be due to the widespread appearance of the actin inhibitor profilin (52Valenta R. Duchene M. Ebner C. Valent P. Sillaber C. Deviller P. Ferreira F. Tejkl M. Edelmann H. Kraft D. Scheiner O. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), but we were unable to find any profilin-like sequences in either cDNA Hev b 5 or pKIWI501. The homology with the stolon tip protein of potato is also notable and may account for some reports of potato allergy among latex-allergic individuals (10Beezhold D.H. Sussman G.L. Liss G.M. Chang N.S. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1996; 26: 416-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The mRNA for both the kiwi and potato proteins peak early in plant development, but persist in the mature plant, and the expressed proteins may be present in the ingested products and elicit clinical reactions. The role of Hev b 5 in H. brasiliensis is uncertain. The appearance of this message in at least 5 out of only 1000 plaques screened from a latex cDNA library indicates that the message is abundant in latex cytosol. In addition to its homology to kiwi and potato sequences of unknown function, Hev b 5 is also homologous with neurofilament triplet L protein and the myristoylated alanine-rich kinase C substrate. These observations, along with its resistance to standard denaturation techniques, suggest that Hev b 5 is a cytoplasmic structural protein. Subcellular localization studies, using monoclonal antibodies, will help better define the biological function of Hev b 5. Latex allergy is an increasingly important problem, affecting the lives and careers of thousands of health care providers and their patients. It is notable that, in spite of the large number of Hevea proteins that have been described, Hev b 5 appears to be a newly described protein. While it is unlikely that Hev b 5 represents the only allergen in Hevea latex, a large majority of patients with latex allergy, regardless of risk category, have IgE that recognizes the Hev b 5 sequence. Thus, Hev b 5 is a major antigen in Hevea latex (37King T.P. Hoffman D. Lowenstein H. Marsh D.G. Platts-Mills T.A.E. Thomas W. Allergy. 1995; 50: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Among the unresolved issues in the care of people with latex allergy are the extreme difficulty of complete latex protein avoidance and the absence of effective and safe immunotherapy regimens. The molecular identification of latex protein antigens, and the precise identification of the T- and B-cell epitopes of these antigens, will help address these issues and may serve as a model for the treatment of other life-threatening allergic disorders."

MDA-MB-435 human breast carcinoma cells were transfected with a control expression vector (pCMVBamneo), the vector containing the wild type nm23-H1, or the nm23-H1 vector encoding mutations at the following amino acids: serine 44, a phosphorylation site; proline 96, the k-pn mutation in the Drosophila nm23 homolog that causes developmental defects; histidine 118, involved in Nm23's nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity; and serine 120, a site of mutation in human neuroblastomas and phosphorylation. The wild type nm23-H1 transfectants were 44-98% less motile to serum and 86-99% less motile to autotaxin than control vector transfectants. The proline 96 k-pn, serine 120 to glycine, and to a lesser extent serine 120 to alanine mutant nm23-H1-transfected cell lines exhibited motility levels at or above the control transfectants, indicating that these mutations can abrogate the motility-suppressive phenotype of nm23-H1. No effect was observed on cellular proliferation, nor were the serine 44 to alanine nm23-H1 mutant transfectants motile, demonstrating the specificity of the data.

INTRODUCTIONThe metastatic spread of tumor cells and complications arising from the treatment of established metastases are major contributors to cancer patient mortality. As a result of differential colony hybridization between related high and low metastatic potential murine K-1735 melanoma cell lines, we identified nm23 on the basis of reduced mRNA (1Steeg P.S.

Three human nm23 genes have been identified, nm23-H1, nm23-H2, and nm23-DR (2Rosengard A.M. Krutzsch H.C. Shearn A. Biggs J.R. Barker E. Margulies I.M.K. King C.R. Liotta L.A. Steeg P.S.

NDPK (EC2.7.4.6) catalyzes the transfer of a terminal phosphate of 5ʹ-triphosphate nucleotides to 5ʹ-diphosphate nucleotides via a high energy NDPK-phosphohistidine intermediate (46Krebs H.A. Hems R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1953; 12: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 47Berg P. Joklik W.K. Nature. 1953; 172: 1008-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 48Parks R.E. Agarwal R.P. Nucleoside diphosphokinases. Academic Press, Inc., New York1973Google Scholar). The proposed biological functions of the NDPK activity include modulation of nucleotide pools, G-protein function, microtubule polymerization, etc. and have been subject to debate (reviewed in 36De La Rosa A. Williams R.L. Steeg P.S. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, nm23 transfectants exhibiting suppressed metastatic potential did not have increased total or subcellular NDPK activity (49Golden A. Benedict M. Shearn A. Kimura N. Leone A. Liotta L.A. Steeg P.S. Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinase, nm23 and Tumor Metastasis: Possible Biochemical Mechanisms. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston, MA1993Google Scholar). Additionally, the killer of prune mutation of Drosophila awd (awdk-pn) (50Biggs J. Hersperger E. Dearolf C. Shearn A. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1333-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) retained NDPK activity, yet caused all of the developmental abnormalities associated with null-awd when co-expressed with a prune (pn) mutation (51Lascu I. Chaffotte A. Limbourg-Bouchon B. Veron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12775-12781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Direct evidence indicating the necessity of the conserved histidine residue, but not for elevated NDPK activity, in Drosophila development was provided by transformation studies using nm23-H1, nm23-H2, and both wild type and histidine-mutated awd into the null-awd germ line (52Xu J. Liu L. Deng F. Timmons L. Hersperger E. Steeg P. Veron M. Shearn A. Dev. Biol. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). A second biochemical activity for Nm23 proteins utilizing histidine phosphorylation as a histidine protein kinase was recently reported (53Wagner P. Vu N.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21758-21764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).Lower energy serine phosphorylation of Nm23, not directly involved in the phosphate transfers of the NDPK or histidine protein kinase activity, have also been described (54MacDonald N.J.

In contrast to NDPK activity, serine phosphorylation levels among control- and nm23-transfected melanoma cell lines were directly correlated with metastasis-suppressive activity, suggesting the hypothesis that it may be biologically relevant (54MacDonald N.J.

Nm23-H2 has been identified as a transcription factor for the PuF site found near the c-myc and other promoters (58Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Flint S.J. Ferrone C.A.

Lacombe M. Mesnildrey S. Veron M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3858-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).

Approximately 30 colonies/transfection construct were harvested if available, with the exception of the control (empty vector) construct. Clones were initially screened for the overexpression of a nm23-H1 transcript on Northern blots.

Open table in a new tab A Northern blot showing nm23-H1 mRNA levels in the clones selected from the transfection experiment is shown in Fig. 1A. Two control-transfected clones, K10 and K27, were randomly selected and exhibited uniformly low nm23-H1 mRNA expression. Three wild type nm23-H1-transfected clones (P52, P57, and P62) were selected with varying degrees of mRNA overexpression. At least two clones overexpressing nm23-H1 mRNA on the Northern blots were identified for each mutant construct, with the exception of nm23-H1S120-A, for which only one expressing clone was identifiable. Additionally, levels of nm23-H1 mRNA just above those of the control transfectants were observed in one of the only two expressing nm23-H1H118-F clones. Rehybridization of the Northern blot to a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe demonstrated equivalent loading of RNA (Fig. 1B). Further biochemical and biologic analyses of the transfectants proceeded in parallel after Northern blot hybridization experiments.Fig. 2 presents a Western blot analysis of Nm23 protein levels in each of the transfectants. The wild type (P) transfectants expressed 2.1-4.1-fold greater Nm23-H1 than the mean level of the control (K) transfectants, as determined by densitometry of chemiluminescence exposures. At amino acid 96, two of the Nm23-H1P96-S (S) clones expressed significantly greater Nm23-H1 than the control (K) clones. The S29 clone, which exhibited nm23-H1 RNA overexpression, expressed little additional Nm23-H1 protein when blots were normalized by cell number (Fig. 2) or by micrograms of protein in cell lysates (data not shown). At amino acid 120, two Nm23-H1S120-G (I) clones as well as the single Nm23-H1S120-A (R) clone expressed 1.6-3.1-fold greater Nm23-H1 than the control (K) transfectants. For amino acid 44, the J20 transfectant of the Nm23-H1S44-A construct expressed 3-fold more protein than the control (K) transfectants. Interpretation of the J58 transfectant data at the same amino acid position is difficult. Whereas this clone overexpressed nm23-H1 mRNA, it exhibited little additional Nm23-H1 protein in Western blots normalized by cell number (Fig. 2). When normalized by micrograms of protein in the cell lysate, the J58 clone exhibited 2.1-fold Nm23-H1 overexpression relative to the control (K) transfectants (data not shown). The data suggest that expression of the transfected cDNA was obtained in this clone but was accompanied by additional changes in cell size, protein synthetic rates, etc. For the histidine 118 position, the E6 transfectant of the Nm23-H1H118-F construct expressed 6.7-fold greater Nm23-H1 than control (K) transfectants. The E2 clone, which expressed little additional nm23-H1 mRNA on Northern blots, failed to significantly overexpress Nm23-H1 when Western blots were normalized by either cell number (Fig. 2) or micrograms of protein in lysates (data not shown).Fig. 2Western blot of Nm23-H1 protein levels of control-, wild type nm23-H1-, and site-directed nm23-H1 mutant-transfected clones. MDA-MB-435 human breast carcinoma cells were transfected with each construct, and clones were harvested as indicated in Table I. Lysate from 3 x 106 cells of each transfectant was electrophoresed in a 14% SDS-PAGE, which was processed as a Western blot using affinity-purified anti-Nm23 peptide 11 antibody (2Rosengard A.M.

Serum was selected for two reasons: (a) clones of murine K-1735 TK melanoma transfected with murine nm23-1 or human MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma transfected with human nm23-H1 exhibited reduced motility responses to serum (42Kantor J.D. McCormick B. Steeg P.S. Zetter B.R. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1971-1973PubMed Google Scholar), and (b) serum contains a variety of motility stimulating and inhibiting factors, which may better reflect the milieu to which tumor cells are exposed in vivo. Each cell line was assayed in triplicate with 0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0% (v/v) serum, for which peak responses were typically obtained at 0.5%. Most experiments tested a subset of the total number of transfected cell lines, due to strict culture requirements for reproducible assays, the number of Boyden chambers available, and potential deleterious effects of long times involved in handling and counting multiple cell lines. All experiments included at least one control transfectant (K) and one wild type nm23-H1 transfectant (P). Table II lists data from three successive experiments, showing motility of cells from the various clones to 0.5% serum. For experiment 481, both control-transfected (K) clones migrated toward serum, with 17-23 cells/high power field. Expression of wild type nm23-H1 by the P52, P57, and P62 clones resulted in a 44-98% reduction in migration, calculated on the basis of the mean of the K clones. The migration of P52 exhibited variability between experiments, whereas that of the P57 and P62 clones was uniform. Reduced motility was exhibited by the P57 clone in experiments 482 and 483.Table II.In vitro motility of MDA-MB-435 human breast carcinoma cells transfected with control, wild type, or site-directed mutant constructs toward fetal calf serumTransfection constructMean cells migrating to 0.5% serum ± S.E.aCells were tested in Boyden chambers for in vitro motility to 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.0% (v/v) fetal calf serum, in 8-h assays.

The activation of StSUT1 by H+ and sucrose displayed Michaelis-Menten-type kinetics suggestive of a 1:1 H+:sucrose stoichiometry. This was confirmed by simultaneously measuring inward currents and sucrose flux in voltage-clamped oocytes. The apparent affinities K0.5 for H+ and sucrose were voltage-dependent.

Rev. 1990; 3: 66-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Type A strains produce an exotoxin, termed α-toxin, that exhibits in vivo both lethal and edematizing activity (1Hatheway C.L. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 3: 66-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In tissue culture, α-toxin is cytotoxic, causing cell shape changes that are accompanied by disruption of the microfilament cytoskeleton and by minor effects at the vimentin and tubulin system (2Bette P. Oksche A. Mauler F. Eichel-Streiber C. Popoff M.R. Habermann E. Toxicon. 1991; 29: 877-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 3Müller H. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Habermann E. Infect.

Recently, α-toxin has been cloned and sequenced (5Hofmann F. Herrmann A. Habermann E. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1995; 247: 670-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As deduced from these data, α-toxin has a molecular mass of 250,166 Da and shows 48% homology with Clostridium difficile toxin A (ToxA) 1The abbreviations used are: ToxAC. difficile toxin AToxBC. difficile toxin BGalgalactoseGlcglucoseGlcNAcN-acetyl-galactosaminePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisGTPγSguanosine 5ʹ-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. and toxin B (ToxB). ToxA and ToxB are the major virulence factors of pathogenic C. difficile strains and have been identified as the causative agents of the antibiotic-associated diarrhea and the fatal form, the pseudomembranous colitis (6Lyerly D.M. Krivan H.C. Wilkins T.D. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 1: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 7Kelly C.P. Pothoulakis C. LaMont J.T. N. Engl. J.

Gynecol. 1989; 161: 987-995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These clostridial toxins share common structural features. The C-terminal part of the single-chained toxins covers repetitive peptides that are most likely involved in cell receptor binding, followed by a small hydrophobic intermediate region which probably participates in the translocation of the toxins into the cytoplasm of the target cell (5Hofmann F. Herrmann A. Habermann E. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1995; 247: 670-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 10Eichel-Streiber C. Sauerborn M.

Genetics and Molecular Biology of Anaerobic Bacteria. Springer-Verlag, New York1993: 264Crossref Google Scholar). The common property of these intracellularly acting protein toxins is their cytotoxic activity, which leads to preferential destruction of the microfilament system of cell monolayers.Recently, C. difficile ToxA and ToxB have been identified as monoglucosyltransferases that selectively modify the low molecular mass GTP-binding proteins of the Rho subfamily (12Just I.

Two mechanisms through which PIP3 can be generated have been described in human leukocytes. One pathway involves the coupling of the src-related tyrosine kinase Lyn to the “classical” p85/p110 form of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The second paradigm utilizes a novel form of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase whose activity is directly regulated by G protein βγ subunits. In this paper, we show that formation of PIP3 in chemoattractant-stimulated neutrophils is substantially attenuated by inhibitors that specifically block tyrosine kinase activity. These data suggest that the Lyn activation pathway plays a major role in the formation of this important lipid messenger during chemoattractant stimulation of human neutrophils.

https://openalex.org/W2053356200,"The Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) translocation generates a chimeric tyrosine kinase oncogene, BCR/ABL, which causes chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and a type of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In primary samples from virtually all patients with CML or Ph+ALL, the CRKL adapter protein is tyrosine phosphorylated and physically associated with p210BCR/ABL. CRKL has one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains and is structurally related to c-CRK-II (CRK) and the v-Crk oncoprotein. We have previously shown that CRKL, but not the related adapter protein c-CRK, is tyrosine phosphorylated in cell lines transformed by BCR/ABL, and that CRKL binds to BCR/ABL through the CRKL-SH3 domains. Furthermore, the CRKL-SH2 domain has been shown to bind one or more cellular proteins, one of which is p120CBL. Here we demonstrate that another cellular protein linked to BCR/ABL through the CRKL-SH2 domain is p130CAS. p130CAS was found to be tyrosine phosphorylated and associated with CRKL in BCR/ABL expressing cell lines and in samples obtained from CML and ALL patients, but not in samples from controls. In both normal and BCR/ABL transformed cells, p130CAS was detected in focal adhesion-like structures, as was BCR/ABL. In normal cells, the focal adhesion proteins tensin, p125FAK, and paxillin constitutively associated with p130CAS. However, in BCR/ABL transformed cells, the interaction between p130CAS and tensin was disrupted, while the associations between p130CAS, p125FAK, and paxillin were unaffected. These results suggest that the BCR/ABL oncogene could alter the function of p130CAS in at least three ways: tyrosine phosphorylation, inducing constitutive binding of CRKL to a domain in p130CAS containing Tyr-X-X-Pro motifs (substrate domain), and disrupting the normal interaction of p130CAS with the focal adhesion protein tensin. These alterations in the structure of signaling proteins in focal adhesion like structures could contribute to the known adhesion abnormalities in CML cells.

There are multiple proteins which are tyrosine phosphorylated in response to BCR/ABL transformation (1Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B.F. Langdon W.Y.

We and others have shown that one of the most prominent and consistently tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins is an adapter protein termed CRKL (CRK-like) (5ten Hoeve J. Arlinghaus R.B. Guo J.Q.

The v-crk oncogene was originally cloned from the CT10 virus and can transform fibroblasts and other cells. The v-Crk oncoprotein contains both one SH2 and one SH3 domain, while c-CRK-II and CRKL contain one SH2 and two SH3 domains (10Matsuda M. Tanaka S. Nagata S. Kojima A. Kurata T. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell.

A second product of the c-CRK gene, c-CRK-I, has one SH2 and one SH3 domain, but to date, only one form of CRKL has been observed and no oncogenic forms have been described. v-crk transformation in 3Y1 fibroblasts leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins (12Matsuda M. Reichman C.T. Hanafusa H. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 115-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the v-crk transformed fibroblasts, c-Abl has been shown to bind to v-Crk and is believed to be activated by this interaction (13Ren R. Ye Z.S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar).Another prominent binding protein for the v-Crk oncoprotein has been shown to be p130CAS (Crk associated substrate) (14Sakai R.

The N terminus contains an SH3 domain, followed by a “substrate domain” consisting of 14 Tyr-X-X-Pro (Y-X-X-P) motifs, each of which are potential CRK/CRKL-SH2 binding sites (15Sakai R. Iwamatsu A.

Although the function of p130CAS in either normal or transformed cells is unknown, these observations suggest that p130CAS may be involved in integrin signaling.Since p130CAS apparently plays a prominent role in transformation by the v-crk oncogene, we examined the interaction of p130CAS with c-CRK and CRKL in hematopoietic cells transformed by BCR/ABL and in normal hematopoietic cells. We find that p130CAS is tyrosine phosphorylated in most cell lines transformed by BCR/ABL and associated with the SH2 domain of CRKL, but not with c-CRK. This potentially links p130CAS to BCR/ABL since CRKL is constitutively associated with BCR/ABL through its SH3 domain. This interaction was unique to BCR/ABL transformed cell lines and was not observed in normal cells. Furthermore, in primary cells from patients with CML and Ph+ acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), p130CAS co-immunoprecipitates with CRKL. In both normal and BCR/ABL transfected cells, we found that p130CAS localized in focal adhesion-like structures, as did BCR/ABL. Our results are of interest as they extend the known interactions between BCR/ABL and cellular signal transduction molecules mediated by CRKL.DISCUSSIONChronic myelogenous leukemia was the first disorder identified with a specific abnormal chromosomal translocation, the Philadelphia chromosome, creating a fusion of two genes, BCR and ABL (exons b2a2 or b3a2), and thus generating the oncoprotein p210BCR/ABL (30Chissoe S.L. Bodenteich A. Wang Y.F. Wang Y.P. Burian D. Clifton S.W. Crabtree J. Freeman A. Iyer K. Li J.A. Ma Y.C. Mclaury H.J. Pan H.Q. Sarhan O.H. Toth S. Wang Z.L. Zhang G.Z. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Roe B.A. Genomics. 1995; 27: 67-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In an alternative fusion of BCR and ABL (exons b1a2), there is production of the oncoprotein p190BCR/ABL which can be seen in some acute lymphoblastic leukemias (30Chissoe S.L. Bodenteich A. Wang Y.F. Wang Y.P. Burian D. Clifton S.W. Crabtree J. Freeman A. Iyer K. Li J.A. Ma Y.C. Mclaury H.J. Pan H.Q. Sarhan O.H. Toth S. Wang Z.L. Zhang G.Z. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Roe B.A. Genomics. 1995; 27: 67-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). BCR/ABL is a potent tyrosine kinase which translocates to the cytoskeleton and disrupts the actin cytoskeleton (31McWhirter J. Wang J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1553-1565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32McWhirter J. Wang J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1533-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 33Van Etten R. Jackson P. Baltimore D. Sanders M. Matsudaira P. Janmey P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 325-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). There is growing evidence that CML cells have adhesion defects and that these defects contribute significantly to the clinical phenotype (34Gordon M.Y. Dowding C.R. Riley G.P. Goldman J.M. Greaves M.F. Nature. 1987; 328: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 35Verfaillie C.M. McCarthy J.B. McGlave P.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1232-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). There are multiple proteins which are phosphorylated by BCR/ABL in primary cells from subjects with CML or ALL and in cell lines generated by transfection of BCR/ABL (33Van Etten R. Jackson P. Baltimore D. Sanders M. Matsudaira P. Janmey P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 325-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). We and others have previously shown that a potentially key signaling intermediate is CRKL (5ten Hoeve J. Arlinghaus R.B. Guo J.Q. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Blood. 1994; 84: 1731-1736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Nichols G.L. Raines M.A. Vera J.C. Lacomis L. Tempst P. Golde D.W. Blood. 1994; 84: 2912-2918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Oda T.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22925-22928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).CRKL is a 39-kDa protein with one SH2 and two SH3 domains (9ten Hoeve J. Morris C. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2469-2474PubMed Google Scholar). It has a high homology to c-CRK-II, and belongs to the CRK family of adapter proteins (37Feller S.M. Ren R.B. Hanafusa H. Baltimore D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 453-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The CRK family consists of v-Crk, c-CRK-II, c-CRK-I, and CRKL. CRKL and c-CRK-II contain an NH2-terminal SH2 domain and two tandem SH3 domains at the COOH terminus. c-CRK-I and v-Crk both have a deletion of the most COOH-terminal SH3 (38Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1465-1473PubMed Google Scholar). CRKL has been shown to have similar in vitro binding characteristics as c-CRK (38Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1465-1473PubMed Google Scholar). However, in BCR/ABL containing cells, it is CRKL and not c-CRK which is tyrosine phosphorylated (5ten Hoeve J. Arlinghaus R.B. Guo J.Q. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Blood. 1994; 84: 1731-1736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Nichols G.L. Raines M.A. Vera J.C. Lacomis L. Tempst P. Golde D.W.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22925-22928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to explore the differences between c-CRK and CRKL in hematopoietic cells, we have tried to determine if they have a similar association with the recently cloned Crk-associated substrate p130CAS (14Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 15Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Nishida J. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32740-32746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results indicate that p130CAS is tyrosine phosphorylated, and associates with CRKL, but not c-CRK in BCR/ABL transformed cell lines and samples from patients with CML and Ph+ ALL. The timing of association between p130CAS and BCR/ABL to CRKL has not been shown in this study and further experiments will be needed.It is of interest that p130CAS is not significantly tyrosine phosphorylated in K562 cells and the reasons are quite unclear (2de Jong R. ten Hoeve J. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21468-21471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 29Ribon V. Hubbell S. Herrera R. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). There is a possibility that K562 cells have other abnormalities which prevent p130CAS from becoming phosphorylated. Classically, there is heterogeneity of tyrosine phosphorylation of various proteins in CML primary cells. This heterogeneity could also involve the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130CAS by BCR/ABL. It has also been shown that K562 cells lack β2 integrins and this somehow is related to p130CAS phosphorylation (39Larson R. Springer T. Immunol. Rev. 1990; 114: 181-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Eventually, further experiments will need to be performed to explore the differences and localization of p130CAS.p130CAS was initially identified as a prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated substrate of the oncoproteins v-Src and v-Crk (17Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Wang H.C. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 40Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Mayer B.J. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10588-10595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown that p130CAS is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to adhesion and cross-linking of β1 integrins (17Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Wang H.C. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 18Petch L.A. Bockholt S.M. Bouton A. Parsons J.T. Burridge K. J.

Weisberg E. Chen L.B. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 41Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10678-10682Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). p130CAS may be important in transformation by ornithine decarboxylase (42Auvinen M. Paasinensohns A. Hirai H. Andersson L.C. Holtta E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6513-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It has been shown that c-Abl may phosphorylate p130CAS in vitro. In normal cells, p130CAS is localized to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus; whereas in v-src and v-crk transformed fibroblasts, it is primarily localized to the focal adhesion (14Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 17Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Wang H.C. Vines R.R.

Bioessays. 1994; 16: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).p130CAS was originally cloned from 3Y1 fibroblasts transformed with v-crk (14Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T.

Chem. 1994; 269: 32740-32746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are two major tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in v-crk transformed 3Y1 cells: paxillin and p130CAS (43Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Reichman C. Shoelson S.E. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4648-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Using isolated protein and peptide sequencing, the cDNA encoding p130CAS has been characterized. p130CAS contains an NH2-terminal SH3 domain which has been shown to bind to the proline-rich portion in the COOH terminus of p125FAK. In the middle of the molecule is the “substrate domain” with nine Tyr-Asp-X-Pro motifs optimum for binding the c-CRK-SH2 domain (14Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Mayer et al. (44Mayer B.J. Hirai H. Sakai R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 296-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) have shown that the c-Abl-SH2 domain binds to the substrate domain of p130CAS in vitro. Lo et al. (19Lo S.H. Weisberg E. Chen L.B. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) have shown that the SH2 domain of tensin is also capable of binding p130CAS in v-src transformed cells. We show here that the CRKL-SH2 domain binds directly to the substrate domain of p130CAS.We examined the association of p130CAS with focal adhesion proteins in normal and BCR/ABL transformed hematopoietic cells. There was a constitutive association of p125FAK and paxillin with p130CAS. Interestingly, the focal adhesion protein tensin associated with p130CAS in normal hematopoietic cells, but not in BCR/ABL transformed cells. Tensin is an SH2 containing protein which has three actin-binding domains, and is believed to be involved in linking integrins to the actin cytoskeleton (45Lo S.H. Janmey P.A. Hartwig J.H. Chen L.B. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 125: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Tensin also is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to various mitogenic signals (36Lo S.H. An Q. Bao S. Wong W.-K. Liu Y. Janmey P.A. Hartwig J.H. Chen L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22310-22319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that tensin and p130CAS form a complex in normal cells and that binding is disrupted in BCR/ABL transformed cells. The reason for this possibly could be that tensin and/or p130CAS could be located in different compartments, either of these molecules could be bound to another protein thereby not interacting with each other, or the tyrosine phosphorylation of either of these molecules could potentially inhibit their interactions. The alteration in binding between p130CAS and tensin could be an important step toward BCR/ABL transformation, and this is currently being investigated.In summary, we have shown that p130CAS is expressed in hematopoietic cells, it is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to BCR/ABL, and associates with the unique adapter protein CRKL as shown by coimmunoprecipitation. p130CAS also constitutively associates with focal adhesion proteins such as paxillin and p125FAK. However, p130CAS associates with tensin in normal but not BCR/ABL expressing cells. It is known that CML progenitor cells have abnormalities of adhesion through β1 integrins and potentially p130CAS could be involved in mediating these abnormalities.

There are multiple proteins which are tyrosine phosphorylated in response to BCR/ABL transformation (1Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B.F. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4515-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 2de Jong R. ten Hoeve J. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. J. Biol.

We and others have shown that one of the most prominent and consistently tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins is an adapter protein termed CRKL (CRK-like) (5ten Hoeve J. Arlinghaus R.B. Guo J.Q. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Blood. 1994; 84: 1731-1736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Nichols G.L. Raines M.A. Vera J.C. Lacomis L. Tempst P. Golde D.W.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22925-22928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CRKL has a 60% homology to c-CRK-II (CRK), the human homologue of v-Crk (8Mayer B.J. Hanafusa H. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3581-3589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9ten Hoeve J. Morris C. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2469-2474PubMed Google Scholar). The v-crk oncogene was originally cloned from the CT10 virus and can transform fibroblasts and other cells. The v-Crk oncoprotein contains both one SH2 and one SH3 domain, while c-CRK-II and CRKL contain one SH2 and two SH3 domains (10Matsuda M. Tanaka S. Nagata S. Kojima A. Kurata T. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell.

A second product of the c-CRK gene, c-CRK-I, has one SH2 and one SH3 domain, but to date, only one form of CRKL has been observed and no oncogenic forms have been described. v-crk transformation in 3Y1 fibroblasts leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins (12Matsuda M. Reichman C.T. Hanafusa H. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 115-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the v-crk transformed fibroblasts, c-Abl has been shown to bind to v-Crk and is believed to be activated by this interaction (13Ren R. Ye Z.S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar).Another prominent binding protein for the v-Crk oncoprotein has been shown to be p130CAS (Crk associated substrate) (14Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). p130CAS was originally cloned from the v-crk transformed 3Y1 cell line and shown to be heavily tyrosine phosphorylated in these cells (14Sakai R.

The N terminus contains an SH3 domain, followed by a “substrate domain” consisting of 14 Tyr-X-X-Pro (Y-X-X-P) motifs, each of which are potential CRK/CRKL-SH2 binding sites (15Sakai R. Iwamatsu A.

Although the function of p130CAS in either normal or transformed cells is unknown, these observations suggest that p130CAS may be involved in integrin signaling.Since p130CAS apparently plays a prominent role in transformation by the v-crk oncogene, we examined the interaction of p130CAS with c-CRK and CRKL in hematopoietic cells transformed by BCR/ABL and in normal hematopoietic cells. We find that p130CAS is tyrosine phosphorylated in most cell lines transformed by BCR/ABL and associated with the SH2 domain of CRKL, but not with c-CRK. This potentially links p130CAS to BCR/ABL since CRKL is constitutively associated with BCR/ABL through its SH3 domain. This interaction was unique to BCR/ABL transformed cell lines and was not observed in normal cells. Furthermore, in primary cells from patients with CML and Ph+ acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), p130CAS co-immunoprecipitates with CRKL. In both normal and BCR/ABL transfected cells, we found that p130CAS localized in focal adhesion-like structures, as did BCR/ABL. Our results are of interest as they extend the known interactions between BCR/ABL and cellular signal transduction molecules mediated by CRKL. Chronic myelogen"

While the tertiary structures of several PH domains have been determined, some co-complexed with ligands, the function of this domain remains elusive. In this report, the PH domain located in the N terminus of human phospholipase C-δ1 (PLCδ1) was found to regulate enzyme activity. The hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol (PI) was stimulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 = 1 μM (0.3 mol%), up to 9-fold higher when 5 μM (1.5 mol%) of PIP2 was incorporated into the PI/phosphatidylserine (PS)/phosphatidylcholine (PC) vesicles (30 μM of PI with a molar ratio of PI:PS:PC = 1:5:5). Stimulation was specific for PIP2, since other anionic phospholipids including phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate had no stimulatory effect. PIP2-mediated stimulation was, however, inhibited by inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting a modulatory role for this inositol. When a nested set of PH domain deletions up to 70 amino acids from the N terminus of PLCδ1 were constructed, the deletion mutant enzymes all catalyzed the hydrolysis of the micelle forms of PI and PIP2 with specific activities comparable with those of the wild type enzyme. However, the stimulatory effect of PIP2 was greatly diminished when more than 20 amino acid residues were deleted from the N terminus. To identify the specific residues involved in PIP2-mediated enzyme activation, amino acids with functional side chains between residues 20 and 40 were individually changed to glycine. While all these mutations had little effect on the ability of the enzyme to catalyze the hydrolysis of PI or PIP2 micelles, the catalytic activity of mutants K24G, K30G, K32G, R38G, or W36G was markedly unresponsive to PIP2. Analysis of PIP2-stimulated PI hydrolysis by a dual substrate binding model of catalysis revealed that the micellar dissociation constant (Ks) of PLCδ1 for the PI/PS/PC vesicles was reduced from 558 μM to 53 μM, and the interfacial Michaelis constant (Km) was reduced from 0.21 to 0.06 by PIP2. The maximum rate of PI hydrolysis (Vmax) was not affected by PIP2. These results demonstrate that a major function of the PH domain of PLCδ1 is to modulate enzyme activity. Further, our results identify PIP2 as a functional ligand for a PH domain and suggest a general mechanism for the regulation of other proteins by PIP2.

When a nested set of PH domain deletions up to 70 amino acids from the N terminus of PLCδ1 were constructed, the deletion mutant enzymes all catalyzed the hydrolysis of the micelle forms of PI and PIP2 with specific activities comparable with those of the wild type enzyme. However, the stimulatory effect of PIP2 was greatly diminished when more than 20 amino acid residues were deleted from the N terminus. To identify the specific residues involved in PIP2-mediated enzyme activation, amino acids with functional side chains between residues 20 and 40 were individually changed to glycine. While all these mutations had little effect on the ability of the enzyme to catalyze the hydrolysis of PI or PIP2 micelles, the catalytic activity of mutants K24G, K30G, K32G, R38G, or W36G was markedly unresponsive to PIP2. Analysis of PIP2-stimulated PI hydrolysis by a dual substrate binding model of catalysis revealed that the micellar dissociation constant (Ks) of PLCδ1 for the PI/PS/PC vesicles was reduced from 558 μM to 53 μM, and the interfacial Michaelis constant (Km) was reduced from 0.21 to 0.06 by PIP2. The maximum rate of PI hydrolysis (Vmax) was not affected by PIP2. These results demonstrate that a major function of the PH domain of PLCδ1 is to modulate enzyme activity. Further, our results identify PIP2 as a functional ligand for a PH domain and suggest a general mechanism for the regulation of other proteins by PIP2. PLCδ1 is a member of a family of inositol phospholipid-specific phospholipase C (PLC) 1The abbreviations used are: PLCphosphoinositide-specific phospholipase CPH domainpleckstrin homology domainIP3inositol 1,4,5-triphosphatePIP2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphatePIPphosphatidylinositol 4-phosphatePIphosphatidylinositolPEphosphatidylethanolaminePCphosphatidylcholinePAphosphatidic acidPSphosphatidylserinePGphosphatidyl glycerolBSAbovine serum albuminSUVsmall unilamellar vesicles. isozymes through which a variety of hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors elicit intracellular responses (1Berridge M.J.

All three major PLC isozyme families (β, δ, and γ) are able to recognize phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP), and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and carry out the Ca2+-dependent hydrolysis of these inositol phospholipids (2Rhee S.G.

Comparison of the primary structures of members from each family shows significant amino acid sequence identity with other family members, but little identity exists between members of different families. Three exceptions to this divergence of primary structure among different isoforms are two distinct conserved sequences denoted as the X and Y domains and the newly recognized pleckstrin homology domain. X and Y domains are regions of ∼170 and ∼260 amino acids, respectively, which share 60-40% amino acid identity among all isoforms (2Rhee S.G. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Lee S.Y.

Taken together, these studies suggest that PH domains mediate either protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions and lead to membrane anchorage. Several partially revealing and sometimes conflicting reports have been published concerning the PH domain of PLCδ1. Both IP3 and PIP2 have been demonstrated to bind with high affinity to the PH domain of PLCδ1 when this domain has been studied as an isolated fusion protein (17Ferguson K. Lemmon M. Schlessinger J. Sigler P. Cell. 1995; 83: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 30Garcia P. Gupta R. Shah S. Morris A.J. Rudge S.A. Scarlata S. Petrova V. McLaughlin S. Rebecchi M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16228-16234Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Several groups have reported conflicting functional effects as the result of proteolysis or molecular genetic truncation of the N terminus of PLCδ1 (the PH domain is located in the N terminus of PLCδ1). Biochemical studies utilizing proteolyzed enzyme have indirectly suggested a functional role for the N-terminal PH domain of PLCδ1. Cifuentes et al. (31Cifuentes M.E. Honkanen L. Rebecchi M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11586-11593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the first 60 N-terminal residues of the PLCδ1 sequence (which overlap the putative PH domain) are not essential for Ca2+-dependent catalysis but are required for the enzyme to hydrolyze PIP2 in a processive manner. Conversely, Ellis et al. (4Ellis M.V. Carne A. Katan M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and Yagisawa et al. (8Yagisawa H. Hirata M. Kanematsu T. Watanabe Y. Ozaki S. Sakuma K. Tanaka H. Yabuta N. Kamata H. Hirata H. Nojima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20179-20188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that truncation of the N terminus of PLCδ1 did not affect its catalytic activity. In addition to serving as substrate for PI-PLC to generate second messengers, PIP2 also plays an important role in several other cellular signalings. PIP2 has been shown to regulate the cell filament activity by interacting with profilin, cofilin, and gelsolin (32Janmey P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 169-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 33Lee S.B. Rhee S.G. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1995; 7: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The activity of phospholipase D has been shown to be stimulated by PIP2 directly (34Liscovitch M. Chalifa V. Pertile P. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21403-21406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or through a GTP-bound ADP-ribosylation factor (35Terui T. Kahn R.A. Randazzo P.A. J. Biol.

Science. 1994; 263: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). High affinity binding of PIP2 to the PH domain of dynamin leads to activation of the GTPase of the protein (25Zheng J. Cahill S.M. Lemmon A.M. Fushman D. Schlessinger J. Cowburn D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 38Tuma P.L. Stachniak M.C. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17240-17246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the structural requirement for these interactions and the mechanism underlying the phenomenon would require further investigation. In particular, given the fact that PIP2 can bind with high affinity and specificity to the PH domain of PLCδ1 (8Yagisawa H. Hirata M. Kanematsu T. Watanabe Y. Ozaki S. Sakuma K. Tanaka H. Yabuta N. Kamata H. Hirata H. Nojima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20179-20188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lemmon M. Ferguson K. O'Brien B. Sigler P. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10472-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), it would be of interest to know whether PIP2 might also modulate the activity of PLCδ1. In the present report, we provide the first demonstration that high affinity binding of PIP2 to the PH domain of PLCδ1 leads to enhanced enzyme activity. Additionally, we have established (using site-directed mutagenesis) the structural determinants mediating this activity in the PH domain of PLCδ1. Further, we have demonstrated that this specific protein-phospholipid interaction is crucial for efficient hydrolysis of substrate by PLCδ1, demonstrating an important role for PH domains in regulating enzyme activity. The expression plasmid pRSETA(R) was from Invitrogen. The resulting expression construct (pRSETAplc(R)) was placed under the control of the T7 promoter for expression in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLys (Novagen). Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), PI, phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidyl glycerol (PG), phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylserine (PS) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. PIP2 was obtained from Calbiochem. IP3 and dodecyl maltoside were obtained from Sigma. A nested set of N-terminal deletion mutants (30-base pair increments) were generated in the human PLCδ1 cDNA using the polymerase chain reaction as described previously (39Ogel Z.B. McPherson M.J. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 467-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Replacement of single amino acid residues in PLCδ1 was accomplished by polymerase chain reaction as described previously (7Cheng H.-F. Jiang M.-J. Chen C.-L. Liu S.-M. Wong L.-P. Lomasney J.W. King K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5495-5505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). All mutants were subsequently confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Native and mutant enzyme cDNAs were introduced into the BamHI site of pRSETA(R). The resulting recombinant PLCδ1 contained a 34-amino acid residue module at the N terminus of the protein, which included six consecutive histidine residues. The enzymes were expressed in the E. coli strain BL21, solubilized, and purified by sequential Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose followed by heparin-Sepharose column chromatography as described previously (7Cheng H.-F.

The homogeneity of the purified enzymes was demonstrated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Functional activities of the enzyme preparations were determined by measuring the hydrolysis of [3H]PI in detergent micelles (40Hofmann S.L. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6461-6469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activities were expressed as specific activities (μmol/mg/min). PLCδ1-catalyzed hydrolysis of PIP2 was determined as described previously (41Hepler J.R. Kozasa T. Smrcka A.V. Simon M.I. Rhee S.G. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14367-14375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, purified enzyme (0.1-10 ng) was incubated in an assay volume of 60 μl, which contained 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 3 mM EGTA, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.83 mM MgCl2, 20 mM NaCl, 30 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.16% sodium cholate, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 50 μM [3H]PIP2 (16,000 cpm), and 500 μM PE. The reaction was carried out at 30°C for 2-15 min and terminated by the addition of 0.2 ml of 10% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid and 0.1 ml of bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml). After incubation on ice for 15 min, the unhydrolyzed [3H]PIP2 (pellet) was separated from [3H]IP3 (supernatant) by centrifugation at 2000 x g for 10 min. Radioactivity in the supernatant was measured by liquid scintillation counting. PIP2 hydrolytic activity was expressed as μmol of IP3/min/mg of protein. Determination of PI hydrolytic activity was essentially as described by Hofmann and Majerus (40Hofmann S.L. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6461-6469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assays using dodecyl maltoside/PIP2 or dodecyl maltoside/PI mixed micelles were performed in a manner similar to those described by Cifuentes et al. (31Cifuentes M.E. Honkanen L. Rebecchi M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11586-11593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modification. In brief, the indicated amounts of PIP2/[3H]PIP2 or PI/[3H]PI (4 x 105 cpm) in chloroform/methanol (19:1) were dried under a stream of N2 and then lyophilized for 30 min. Lipids were then solubilized by probe sonication in 0.95 ml of a solution containing 300 μM of dodecyl maltoside, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 2 mM EGTA. Fifty μl of bovine serum albumin in the same buffer was added to yield a final concentration of 500 μg/ml. To assay the PIP2 hydrolytic activity, 50 μl of dodecyl maltoside/PI or PIP2 mixed micelles was preincubated at 30°C for 5 min with 0.1-10 ng of enzyme. The reaction was initiated by adding 2.5 μl of 40 mM of CaCl2 and incubated at 30°C for another 1-15 min. For micelles containing PI, reactions were terminated by the addition of 250 μl of chloroform/methanol/HCl (100:100:0.6), followed by 75 μl of 1 N HCl containing 5 mM EGTA. The aqueous and organic phases were separated by centrifugation, and a 100-μl portion of the upper aqueous phase was counted by liquid scintillation. For micelles containing PIP2, reactions were stopped by adding 0.17 ml of 10% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid and 0.85 μl of bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml). After incubation on ice for 15 min, the unhydrolyzed [3H]PIP2 (pellet) was separated from [3H]IP3 (supernatant) by centrifugation at 2000 x g for 10 min. Hydrolysis of 30 μM PI was carried out in PI/PS/PC (molar ratio of 1:5:5) small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) incorporated with varying amounts of PIP2. Single bilayer vesicles were prepared as described previously (42Hofmann S.L. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14359-14364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modification. In brief, a stock solution of lipids, 30 nmol of 3H-labeled PI (4,000,00 cpm), 150 nmol of PS, 150 nmol of PC, and the indicated amount of PIP2 (0-7.5 nmol) were mixed and dried under a stream of nitrogen. The dried lipids were resuspended in 0.95 ml of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EGTA. The mixture was vortexed and followed by two cycles of ultrasonication for 15 s with a Heat Systems Sonicator (Heat Systems, Farmingdale, NY) with 45-s cooling intervals. Samples were then centrifuged at 120,000 x g for 60 min, and the clear supernatant was carefully removed. Fifty μl of BSA was added to give a final concentration of 200 μg/ml. Greater than 90% of the phospholipid was routinely recovered in the supernatant. Samples were then bubbled with nitrogen and stored at room temperature. The final concentration of PI, PS, and PC was 30, 150, and 150 μM, respectively plus the indicated concentration of PIP2. Lipids were used within 24 h. To assay the PI-PLC activity, 50 μl of SUV containing 30 μM PI (20,000 cpm) was preincubated at 37°C for 5 min with 0.01-10 ng of enzyme. The reaction was initiated by adding 2.5 μl of 60 mM CaCl2 and incubated at 37°C for another 1-15 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 0.2 ml of chloroform/methanol/HCl (100:100:0.6), followed by 0.06 ml of 1 N HCl containing 5 mM EGTA. The aqueous and organic phases were separated by centrifugation, and a 100-μl portion of the upper aqueous phase was counted by liquid scintillation. PI hydrolysis catalyzed by native PLCδ1 and N-terminal deletion mutant PLCδ1 was measured as a function of total substrate concentration under case III conditions previously described for phospholipase A2 and PLCβ (43Hendrickson H.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5734-5739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44James S.R. Paterson A. Harden T.K. Downes C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11872-11881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In case III, the total concentration of diluent detergent (dodecyl maltoside) was fixed, and the PLC activities were measured with increasing concentrations of the substrate. A dual phospholipid binding model of catalysis (Equations 1 and 2) (43Hendrickson H.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5734-5739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to analyze the kinetic data. E+S⇌k−1k+1ES(Eq. 1) ES+S⇌k−2k+2ESS−k3ES+P(Eq. 2) This model takes into account the fact that the reaction catalyzed by PLCδ1 occurs at the water-lipid interface of the phosphoinositide/dodecyl maltoside mixed micelles. Initial binding of the enzyme to the water-lipid interface of the micelles is described by the micellar dissociation constant, Ks = k-1/k+1 (molar unit). This constant is dependent on both the total enzyme concentration and total substrate concentration. Once attached to the surface of mixed micelles, the enzyme searches for and binds to a second lipid molecule via the catalytic site. The binding of the second lipid molecule and the subsequent catalysis by PLCδ1 is described by the interfacial Michaelis constant, Km = (k-2+ k3)/k+2 (molar fraction, unitless). Initial rates of catalysis (v) as a function of total concentration of PI in the vesicles with a fixed concentration of diluent nonsubstrate phospholipids (To) measured under case III conditions were fitted using Equation 3 (43Hendrickson H.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5734-5739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to obtain the values of Vmax, Ks, and Km, v=VmaxSo2KmKsTo+To+KsKmSo+Km+1So2(Eq. 3) where the absolute rate (Vmax) occurs at an infinite substrate concentration and the saturated substrate molar fraction, So is the total substrate concentration. Dose-dependent binding of enzyme to PE/PC/PIP2 vesicles (molar ratio of 4:1:0.25) was demonstrated using ultracentrifugation as described previously (7Cheng H.-F. Jiang M.-J. Chen C.-L. Liu S.-M. Wong L.-P. Lomasney J.W. King K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5495-5505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In brief, 0.5-1 μg of enzyme was incubated with vesicles of defined lipid composition in a 0.2-ml volume for 15 min at 30°C. Ultracentrifugation (400,000 x g) was carried out in a Beckman TL-100 table top ultracentrifuge and TLA-100 rotor for 40 min. Enzyme remaining in the unbound fractions (supernatant) was quantified by measuring catalysis of [3H]PI and/or by immunoblotting using mixed monoclonal antibodies specific for PLCδ1. The bound enzyme fractions (pellets) were quantitated by dissolving the pellet in 0.05 ml of phosphate-buffered saline buffer and performing Western blot analysis. Our laboratory has recently found that certain lipids when used as diluents can have profound effects on the PI-hydrolyzing activity of PLCδ1. PI is hydrolyzed faster in anionic phospholipid vesicles than in zwitterionic phospholipid vesicles. To study the effect of anionic diluent phospholipids on the ability of PLCδ1 to catalyze the hydrolysis of PI, we compared the hydrolysis of [3H]-PI in PI/PC and PI/PC/PE vesicles that do not contain anionic phospholipids other than the substrate with those in which the anionic phospholipid PA, PS, or PG were added. To minimize the effect of substrate phospholipid (PI) on the phase structure of vesicles, we limited the molar fraction of PI to no more than 0.091 of total lipid in the SUV. As shown in Table I, when only PC was used as a diluent phospholipid, the rate of hydrolysis of PI was 0.2 μmol/min/mg of enzyme. Adding the nonanionic phospholipid PE increased hydrolysis moderately to 0.4 μmol/min/mg of enzyme. Activity was greatly enhanced by including the anionic phospholipids such as PA, PG, or PS into the vesicles; the rate of PI hydrolysis was 1.1, 2.3, and 3.4 μmol/min/mg, respectively, which was a 5-15-fold increase over SUV containing PC only. These results demonstrated that the rate of PI hydrolysis catalyzed by PLCδ1 was significantly enhanced in SUV that contain a combination of PC (0.45 molar fraction) and anionic phospholipid (0.45 molar fraction).Table I.Effect of diluent phospholipids on the hydrolysis of PI by human PLCδ1Vesicle compositionaNitrogen-dried phospholipid mixture containing 30 nmol of 3H-labeled inositol phospholipids (4 x 105 cpm) and the indicated molar fraction of diluent phospholipids were dissolved by sonication into 1 ml of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, and 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin.

The cytosol of these cells contain rubber particles and a large number of proteins. Upon wounding, the cytoplasmic content of these cells is expelled in the form of latex. For the manufacturing of rubber goods, the fresh milky latex is collected in strong ammonia solution (20% final concentration) to prevent coagulation. Chemicals such as antioxidants and antidegradant are added, followed by vulcanization at a high temperature. Despite such harsh conditions, many proteins remain on the surface of latex products, even after leaching to remove excess chemicals and proteins (12Harmann C.P. Allergy Proc. 1994; 15: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). When proteins from the glove extracts were analyzed on gel electrophoresis, a smeared pattern, indicative of degraded protein, was observed (10Akasawa A. Hsieh L.-S. Lin Y. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1995; 95: 1196-1205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, strong allergic reactions can be elicited by the proteins/epitopes remaining on the surface of the latex product. When latex is subjected to centrifugation, it can be separated into a floating white rubber particle layer and a clear pale yellow C-serum fraction. We have previously identified an acidic protein (pI = 3.5) in the C-serum fraction of the latex. The protein has an apparent molecular mass of 25 kDa on SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviations used are: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisIEFisoelectric focusingHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyLBLuria-Bertani mediumPIPESpiperazine-N,Nʹ-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid)PCRpolymerase chain reactionMALDImatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization. and was found by IgE immunoblotting to be reactive in 52% of latex-allergic patient sera (10Akasawa A.

It has been shown that allergen recognition patterns differ between adults and children; this acidic protein, however, is recognized by both (10Akasawa A. Hsieh L.-S. Lin Y. J. Allergy Clin.

Patients with latex allergy are often reported to be allergic to fruits (13Kurup V.P. Kelly T. Elms N. Kelly K. Fink J. Allergy Proc. 1994; 15: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), particularly avocado, chestnut, banana, and kiwifruit (14Blanco C. Carrillo T. Castillo R. Quiralte J. Vuevas M. Ann. Allergy. 1994; 73: 309-314PubMed Google Scholar). The cross-reactivity suggests that constituents of these fruits might share common antigenic determinants with some latex allergens, even though these fruits are botanically unrelated to latex. The purpose of this study was to determine the amino acid sequence of the acidic protein and to demonstrate its allergenicity based on its ability to induce histamine release. The sequence of this protein was compared to proteins in the Swiss Protein data bank for possible elucidation of the physiological roles of this protein in latex. Latex was collected from a H. brasiliensis (clone RRIM 600) from Malaysia in a glycerinated buffer solution as described previously (10Akasawa A. Hsieh L.-S. Lin Y. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1995; 95: 1196-1205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The mixture was centrifuged at 50,000 x g at 4°C for 2 h to separate the rubber particles from the C-serum. The floating layer, consisting mostly of rubber particles, was carefully removed. Glycerol was added to the C-serum to a final concentration of 50% (v/v) to prevent degradation and the growth of microorganisms. The mixture was stored at 4°C until use. The C-serum was desalted in a 20 mM citrate buffer, pH 3.0, by passing through a PD-10 column (Sephadex G-25M, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The fraction collected in the void volume was subjected to ion-exchange chromatography on a Pharmacia cation exchange column (HiTrap™ SP) using a FPLC system: buffer A, 20 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 3.8; buffer B, 20 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 3.8, and 1 M NaCl. The fraction that eluted at approximately 5% buffer B contained the pI 3.5 protein. This fraction was further purified by a C-4 reverse phase column (Vydac) with a gradient of 0.12% trifluoroacetic acid in water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. For tryptic digestion, 50 μg of purified pI 3.5 protein was dissolved in 10 ml of 4 M urea in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 2.0 mM CaCl2, pH 8.0, and heated for 15 min at 60°C. Tryptic digestion was performed at room temperature overnight (15Fortes-Dias C.L. Lin Y. Ewell J. Diniz C.R. Liu T-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15646-15651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For endoproteinase Asp-N digestion, 50 μg of purified protein was dissolved in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and digestion was performed at 37°C overnight with a substrate/enzyme ratio of 50/1. The resulting peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC using a C-4 or a C-18 column and eluted with a gradient of 0.12% trifluoroacetic acid, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (15Fortes-Dias C.L. Lin Y. Ewell J. Diniz C.R. Liu T-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15646-15651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid analysis was carried out after hydrolysis in 6 N HCl for 90 min at 150°C by using a Beckman model 6300 amino acid analyzer (16Liu T.-Y. Boykins R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 17Spackman D. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 3-15Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of several peaks from the tryptic digestion were sequenced by automated Edman degradation and analyzed on a model 477A gas-phase microsequencer (Applied Biosystem) connected to an on-line model 120A phenylthiohydantoin analyzer. The endoproteinase Asp-N peptides were sequenced on a model LF 3000 Beckman protein sequencer with on-line phenylthiohydantoin analyzer. Glove extracts were generous gifts from Dr. Robert Hamilton (The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) and Dr. John Yunginger (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). The extracts were prepared and concentrated as described previously (10Akasawa A. Hsieh L.-S. Lin Y. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1995; 95: 1196-1205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Jones R.C. Scheppmann D.L. Heilman A.K. Yunginger J.W. Ann.

Ammoniated latex extract was from Dr. Robert Hamilton. To test the stability of the pI 3.5 protein at high temperature, a condition used in the manufacture of latex gloves, a preparation of the latex extract was heated in an autoclave (250°F, 18 p.s.i.) for 20 min (19Akasawa A. Hsieh L.-S. Lin Y. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1996; 97: 1116-1120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed with a 16% gel under non-reducing conditions and proteins were visualized with silver stain as described previously (10Akasawa A. Hsieh L.-S. Lin Y. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1995; 95: 1196-1205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). IEF gel electrophoresis was performed with Ampholine® PAGplates, pH 3.5-9.5 (Pharmacia), at 500 V for 90 min. After completion of the electrophoresis, immunoblotting was carried out with passive capillary blotting by pressing a nitrocellulose membrane directly against the gel for 45 min. The membrane was reacted with a serum (31 years old, female) that reacts strongly to the pI 3.5 protein followed by peroxidase-labeled anti-human IgE antibody. The IgE-reactive bands were detected by the chemiluminescence horseradish peroxidase system (Amersham Life Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To accurately determine the molecular weight of the pI 3.5 protein, HPLC-purified pI 3.5 protein was analyzed on a Kratos (Shimadzu) MALDI III mass spectrometer using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI). Approximately 5 pmol (0.5 μl) of protein was dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and applied to the target with 0.5 μl of sinapinic acid (Sigma) matrix solution on top. The sample/matrix mixture was dried under vacuum and then analyzed by MALDI. For passive sensitization of human basophils (20MacDonald S.M. Lichtenstein L.M. Proud D. Plaut M. Naclerio R.M. MacGlashan D.W. Kagey-Sobotka A. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 506-512PubMed Google Scholar), venous blood was collected from a volunteer who is not allergic to latex. Twenty ml of heparinized blood was mixed with 25 ml of 154 mM NaCl solution containing 6% dextran for 1 h. After sedimentation of red cells, the polynuclear leukocytes and basophil-containing supernatant was centrifuged at 150 x g for 8 min at 4°C. The cell pellet was washed twice with PAG solution (25 mM PIPES, pH 7.4, 110 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl containing 0.1% dextran and 0.003% human serum albumin) and once with saline. To strip IgE antibody from basophils, 5 ml of 10 mM lactic acid, pH 3.9, 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl was added and incubated for 3.5 min at room temperature. Cells were washed once with PAG solution by centrifugation. To sensitize the cells, the cell pellet was incubated with 100 ml of patient's serum, 300 ml of PAG solution, and 100 ml of 20 mM EDTA containing 0.05% heparin for 60 min at 37°C. Following this incubation, the cells were washed twice with PAG solution. The cell pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of PAG-CM solution (PAG solution with 1 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM CaCl2) and aliquoted into 14 tubes (7 sets in duplicate). Tubes were prewarmed at 37°C for 2 min, and serially diluted pI 3.5 protein (1000, 100, 10, and 1 ng/ml) and 1% perchloric acid (to determine total histamine in cells) were added and incubated for 45 min at 37°C. After incubation, tubes were centrifuged at 150 x g for 8 min at 4°C and supernatants were subjected to histamine measurement by an automatic histamine analyzer (Tosoh Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with sensitivity of 0.1 ng/ml. Spontaneous histamine release was measured by incubating cells with PAG-CM solution and subtracted from each point. Percent histamine was calculated by: % specific release = challenged release/total histamine x 100. The amount of pI 3.5-specific IgE in allergic patient sera was determined by direct ELISA using purified pI 3.5 protein to coat the 96-well plate and incubation with allergic patient sera. The attached IgE was determined by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgE. A cDNA library from latex constructed in λZapII (21Broekaert W. Lee H.-I. Kush A. Chua N.-H. Raikhel N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7633-7637Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. A. Kush of the University of Singapore. In vivo excision of phagemid from the vector was performed using a Stratagene ExAssist/SOLAR System according to a protocol provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, an overnight culture of XL1-Blue MRFʹ was diluted 1:100 with LB and grown at 37°C for 2-3 h to a mid-log phase. Cells were gently spun down and resuspended in 10 mM MgSO4 to an A600 of 5.0. In a 50-ml conical tube, 1 x 108 XL1-Blue MRFʹ cells, 109 ExAssist helper phage, and 107 plaque-forming units of amplified latex cDNA library were combined and incubated at 37°C for 15 min. To this mixture, 25 ml of LB was added and incubated for another 2-2.5 h at 37°C with shaking and cells were spun down for 15 min at 2000 x g. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and heated at 70°C for 15 min, then spun for 15 min at 4000 x g. The supernatant that contained the excised phagemid pBluescript, packaged as filamentous phage particles, was decanted into a sterile tube. To this mixture Me2SO was added to a final concentration of 7% and stored at -80°C. For DNA preparation, the rescued phagemids were plated on LB-ampicillin plates using SOLAR cells and incubated overnight at 37°C. The confluent cells were washed off the plates, and DNA was prepared using Qiagen plasmid DNA extraction kit. Based on the amino acid sequences of a tryptic fragment, (EETKTEEP), a degenerate 23-base oligonucleotide was synthesized. Using the degenerate oligomer, T7 primer, and the phagemid DNA as a template, a 550-base pair DNA fragment was generated by PCR. The fragment was gel-purified and cloned into a Bluescript plasmid for sequence analysis. This was found to be the 3ʹ portion the cDNA coding for the latex pI 3.5 protein. The cDNA that contains the entire coding sequence of the latex pI 3.5 protein was generated by PCR using a T3 primer and a specific 22-base oligomer (GAG ATG AGT TAC TGT GAG GTC T) from the 3ʹ-end of the cDNA sequence. A 800-base pair DNA fragment identified by Southern blot was isolated and cloned into a Bluescript plasmid. Five cDNA clones containing coding sequences for pI 3.5 protein were isolated and sequenced. DNA sequencing was performed using an Amersham/U. S. Biochemical Corp Sequenase™ version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit. The initial sequencing was carried out using M13 (-20) and T3 primers for the C-terminal portion of the cDNA. The complete coding sequence of latex pI 3.5 cDNA was achieved by using specific internal primers 17-c1 (GAG ATG AGT TAC TGT GAG GTC), N5-1R (CAA CAG CAT TGC CAA AG), N5-2 (GCA GAA CCG GAA GCT CCA GCT), and N5-2R (AGC TGG AGC TTC CGG TTC TGC). The FASTA program provided with PCGene was used to search for protein sequence homology of the pI 3.5 protein with other proteins of known sequence in the Swiss Protein sequence bank. Fractions collected from the cation-exchange column were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and IEF immunoblotting. The fraction containing the pI 3.5 protein was purified to homogeneity by HPLC reverse-phase chromatography (Fig. 1). This acidic protein could not be stained by Coomassie Blue and had poor staining using alkaline phosphatase-labeled antibody, but it could easily be detected by silver stain and by chemiluminescence using peroxidase-labeled antibody. The pI 3.5 protein can be readily detected by passive transfer of an IEF gel to a nitrocellulose membrane, and by treating the membrane with latex-allergic patient serum. The IEF immunoblot of extracts from eight brands of commercial latex gloves, heat-treated latex, and ammoniated latex is shown in Fig. 2. Most of the glove extracts contained this protein in varying concentrations. The pI 3.5 protein appeared to be unaffected by autoclaving, while most of other proteins formed aggregates that remained near the origin of the sample loading zone (Fig. 2, lane 3). To demonstrate that the acidic proteins from the glove extracts were the pI 3.5 protein, an inhibition immunoblot experiment was performed. The serum was treated with the purified pI 3.5 protein prior to immunoblotting. Once the IgE specific for this acidic protein was removed, the band at pI 3.5 was no longer detectable (data not shown). The amino acid composition derived from the amino acid analysis of the purified protein is comparable with that from the sequence deduced from the cDNA. The protein contains unusually high amounts of glutamic acid (46 residues), threonine (21 residues), alanine (29 residues), and proline (22 residues) and no aromatic amino acids, methionine or cysteine/cystine. Amino acid sequence analysis indicated that the N terminus of the pI 3.5 protein was blocked. Several amino acid sequences were obtained from HPLC-purified, trypsin-generated, and endopeptidase Asp-N-generated peptides of the purified protein (Fig. 3). The deduced amino acid sequence from the cDNA was nearly identical to that obtained by amino acid sequencing, with the exception of two amino acids at positions 67 and 103 (Fig. 3). At position 81, both Ser and Pro were found in different cDNA clones while amino acid sequence indicated a Pro at this position. The molecular mass of the purified pI 3.5 protein as determined by mass spectroscopy was 16001.2 Da. The molecular mass calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence was 15957.5 Da. The discrepancy of 43 Da is mostly likely from an acetyl group (43 Da) attached to the N-terminal alanine residue. Fig. 3 is the result of DNA sequence analysis of five independent clones of cDNAs coding for the pI 3.5 protein. The DNA sequences for the coding region of all clones were identical with the exception of position 312, which is either a C or a T. This change gave rise to a different amino acid, either proline or serine. The noncoding regions at the 3ʹ-end adjacent to the poly(A) tail were quite variable. Fig. 3 depicts the sequence of a cDNA clone with the shortest sequence at the 3ʹ-end. The computer search identified an acidic protein (pI 3.5) from kiwifruit that has a substantial sequence homology to the latex acidic protein (22Ledger S. Gardner R.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 is the sequence comparison of the latex pI 3.5 protein with a kiwifruit acidic protein, which has a molecular mass of 18.9 kDa with a pI of 3.5. The latex acidic protein has a truncated middle region when the sequences of these proteins are aligned with maximal sequence homology. The homology is most striking in the segments around the N and C termini. To analyze the allergenic properties of the pI 3.5 protein, histamine release was performed using passively sensitized human basophils. Fig. 5 demonstrates that the purified pI 3.5 protein induced a dose-dependent histamine release when cells were first incubated with sera from allergic patients. The amount of histamine release also correlated with the amount of pI 3.5-specific IgE present in the individual serum. (The higher the level of pI 3.5-specific IgE, the better the responses of dosage of pI 3.5 proteins.) Patient 6 was allergic to latex but with a very low level of pI 3.5-specific IgE in the serum. When this serum was used for sensitization of basophils, no detectable histamine was released after incubation with the pI 3.5 protein. Many laboratories have identified IgE-binding latex proteins with different immunoreactivity profiles (6Carrillo T. Cuevas M. Munoz T. Hinojos M. Moneo I.

Immunol. 1995; 96: 635-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The variability may be in part due to differences in the methods of extraction, the diversity of latex sources, and the specificity of allergic patient sera used for immunoblot analysis. We have evaluated the IgE reactivities of extracts of nonammoniated latex, ammoniated latex, and extracts of commercial latex gloves by SDS-PAGE and IEF (19Akasawa A. Hsieh L.-S. Lin Y. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1996; 97: 1116-1120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that some of the antigens may have been denatured during “milking” of latex into ammoniated solutions, later compounding with chemicals, and vulcanization, a number of proteins or protein fragments remained IgE-reactive. One of the proteins that survived these harsh conditions was an acidic protein with a pI of 3.5. In the IEF immunoblot (Fig. 2), almost all gloves shown to produce an allergenic response contained this acidic protein. In some gloves, this is the only band detected by the allergic patient serum. However, the IEF blotting conditions used in this study favor the detection of this acidic protein. Other proteins in the glove extracts reactive to IgE in the serum might not have been detected due to the short transfer time (30-45 min) used with passive contact transfer of proteins to the nitrocellulose. Proteins with different molecular masses were visible as smears when they were assayed by an immunoblot of SDS-PAGE using electroblot (200 V and 1 h) (19Akasawa A. Hsieh L.-S. Lin Y. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1996; 97: 1116-1120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The stability of this protein and its presence in most of the glove extracts tested demonstrate the potential importance of this protein in allergy to latex products. The fact that the purified pI 3.5 protein induced histamine release in IgE sensitized-basophils confirms that it is an allergen, Hev b 5. Histamine release could be detected at an allergen concentration as low as 10 ng when cells were sensitized with serum from patients who had a high IgE titer to this specific protein. In a previous report (23Czuppon A.B. Chen Z. Rennert S. Engelke T. Meyer H.E. Heber M. Baur X. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1993; 92: 690-697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), rubber elongation factor (molecular mass, 14.5 kDa), Hev b 1, was shown to react with sera from all 13 latex-allergic patients in the study. In our experience with 50 latex-allergic patient sera, only 22% reacted to the rubber elongation factor, while 52% of latex-allergic sera reacted with the pI 3.5 protein (10Akasawa A. Hsieh L.-S. Lin Y. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1995; 95: 1196-1205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Due to the large number of allergens in latex, it does not seem feasible to use a single allergen for immunotherapy or for diagnostic purposes. The pI 3.5 protein in latex is composed of only 14 of the 21 naturally occurring amino acids, with unusually high numbers of glutamic acid and proline residues in the repeated motif of XEEX or XEEEX (X can be any amino acid, but most frequently Lys or Ala residues). The molecular mass determined by MALDI mass spectroscopy (16001.2 Da) agrees well with that calculated from the amino acid composition deduced from the cDNA (15957.5 Da). The difference can be explained by the presence of an acetyl group, which blocked the N terminus. There were sequence heterogeneities among the five cDNA clones, suggesting the possible existence of a family of genes coding for the proteins. Recently a high percentage of latex allergy patients have been reported to also have food allergy (13Kurup V.P. Kelly T. Elms N. Kelly K. Fink J. Allergy Proc. 1994; 15: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Fruits frequently have been reported to have cross-reactivities with latex including chestnut, banana, papaya, avocado, and kiwifruit (14Blanco C. Carrillo T. Castillo R. Quiralte J. Vuevas M. Ann. Allergy. 1994; 73: 309-314PubMed Google Scholar). A health care worker who developed allergy to latex gloves after working in the hospital later also developed allergy to avocado and kiwifruit. 2John Murray, personal communication. The most likely explanation for the cross-reactivities is the existence of constituents with common antigenic determinants in latex and various fruits. In our study, the acidic latex protein shares a 47% sequence identity with the kiwifruit pI 3.5 protein. The homology is most striking in the N- and C-terminal segments. The pI 3.5 protein in kiwifruit is one of the proteins that appears in the early stage of fruit development (21Broekaert W. Lee H.-I. Kush A. Chua N.-H. Raikhel N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7633-7637Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), but its biological function is not known. The highest level of mRNA coding for the acidic protein in kiwifruit appears on day 6 after anthesis. The biological role of the pI 3.5 protein in latex is also unknown and needs further investigation. The molecular bases of allergenic cross-reactivity between latex and other fruits are currently under investigation.

https://openalex.org/W1986130304,"We have examined in detail the DNA binding properties of several immunopurified tumor-derived mutant p53 proteins (Val-143 → Ala, Arg-175 → His, Arg-248 → Trp, Arg-249 → Ser, and Arg-273 → His). While all mutants were defective for binding to DNA at 37°C, each bound specifically to several cognate p53 binding sites at sub-physiological temperatures (25-33°C), and several mutants activated transcription from a p53-responsive promoter at 26°C in transfected H1299 cells. Heating mutant p53 proteins at 37°C irreversibly destroyed their ability to subsequently bind at 25°C. However, several different monoclonal antibodies that each share the ability to recognize an epitope encompassing amino acids 46-55 markedly stabilized binding by mutant p53 proteins at 37°C. Both intact antibody and FAb fragments allowed mutant p53 to bind to DNA. By contrast, antibodies that recognize epitopes located elsewhere within p53 stabilized mutant p53 binding significantly less effectively. Our data show that the major hot-spot p53 mutants have the intrinsic ability to bind to DNA and that a unique region within the N terminus of p53 may be critical for rescuing them from loss of binding at physiological temperatures. This suggests the possibility of developing small molecules that can stabilize mutant p53 proteins under physiological conditions.

Induction of the p53 pathway in cells, initiated by damage to DNA, leads to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (Donehower and Bradley, 11Donehower L.A. Bradley A. Biochim. Biophys.

Disruption of this pathway is highly correlated with the development of the tumorigenic phenotype. One function of p53 that is likely to be involved in its role as a tumor suppressor is its ability to activate transcription of genes containing p53 response elements. Such elements contain a repeat of the sequence 5ʹ-RRRC(A/T)(T/A)GYYY-3ʹ (reviewed by Vogelstein and Kinzler, 56Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 523-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). There are a number of genes that contain these binding sites that are activated when cells are induced to express high levels of wild-type p53. Among these are GADD45 (Kastan et al., 29Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. El-Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B. Fornace Jr., A.J.

Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), and IGFBP3 (Buckbinder et al., 6Buckbinder L. Talbott R. Velasco-Miguel S. Takenaka I. Faha B. Seizinger B.R. Kley N. Nature. 1995; 377: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Expression of each of these genes is likely to be relevant in some way to the p53 pathway in cells. Three functional domains of p53 have been identified. At the N terminus is a transcriptional activation region (amino acids 1-43); within the central part is the sequence-specific DNA binding domain (amino acids 100-300), and the C-terminal portion contains an oligomerization region (amino acids 319-360) that forms tetramers (reviewed by Prives, 50Prives C. Cell. 1994; 78: 543-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Additionally, it is clear that sequences and signals outside of the DNA binding domain, especially within the C terminus, regulate the function of the DNA binding domain of wild-type p53 (Hupp et al., 24Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar; Halazonetis and Kandil, 18Halazonetis T. Kandil A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5057-5064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Wang and Prives, 58Wang Y. Prives C. Nature. 1995; 376: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Mutation of the p53 gene occurs in approximately 50% of the tumors derived from the major forms of human cancer (reviewed in Hollstein et al. (22Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C.C. Science. 1991; 253: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (7460) Google Scholar, 23Hollstein M. Rice K. Greenblatt M.S. Soussi T. Fuchs R. Sorlie T. Hovig E. Smith-Sorensen B. Montesano R. Harris C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3551-3555PubMed Google Scholar) and Nigro et al. (1989)). p53 genomic mutation is usually manifested as deletion of one allele coupled to a missense mutation in the other allele. The result of two such mutagenic events is a tumor cell that expresses exclusively mutant p53 protein, frequently at very high levels. Strikingly, nearly all of the >2000 tumor-derived mutations identified to date are located within the central DNA binding domain. While the majority of residues within this region have been mutated, there are six hot-spots that lie within conserved region III (Arg-175), IV (Gly-245, Arg-248, and Arg-249), and V (Arg-273 and Arg-282). Mutation at these codons occurs with unusually high occurrence, i.e. at frequencies ranging between 4 and 10% of the total number of mutations. Thus, together around 40% of the p53 mutations that have been identified involve a hot-spot site. The fact that the tumor-derived mutations are distributed almost exclusively within the DNA binding domain underscores the importance of DNA binding to the normal function of p53. Indeed, a number of studies have characterized the function of tumor-derived p53 mutants with respect to their sequence-specific DNA binding and transactivation activities (Kern et al., 30Kern S.

However, most of these studies have employed assays in which p53 proteins were present in crude cell lysates. A systematic examination of the DNA binding properties of purified tumor-derived mutant p53 proteins has not yet been reported. Since wild-type p53 is a tumor suppressor and mutant forms cannot suppress tumorigenesis (and may even actively contribute to neoplasia) one goal would be to either destroy cells with mutant p53 or identify means to convert a mutant protein to one with normal wild-type function. With respect to the latter objective the ideal result would be to identify a general means to restore normal p53 function to most, if not all, mutants. DNA binding appears to be essential for normal p53 function, and it follows that examination of the ways in which mutant forms of p53 are defective in this regard is of considerable potential importance. We report here that p53 hot-spot mutants are temperature-sensitive for binding to DNA. Additionally we have identified a means by which all mutants tested can bind well to DNA at 37°C. The possibility of a general approach to stabilizing wild-type function in mutant p53 has therapeutic applications. Recombinant baculoviruses expressing wild-type and mutant p53 have been described (Friedman et al., 13Friedman P. Scott S. Vogelstein B. Prives C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9275-9279Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar; Bargonetti et al., 4Bargonetti J. Reynisdottir I. Friedman P.N. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1886-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Extracts of infected sf21 insect cells were prepared, and p53 was purified from lysates by immunoaffinity procedures (Wang et al., 59Wang E.H. Friedman P.N. Prives C. Cell. 1989; 57: 379-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Purified p53 protein was prepared with protein A-Sepharose columns cross-linked with the p53-specific monoclonal antibody PAb 421 (Harlow et al., 20Harlow E. Crawford L.V. Pim D.C. Williamson N.M. J. Virol. 1981; 39: 861-869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins were eluted either with a molar excess of PAb 421 epitope containing peptide (KKGQSTSRHKK-OH) (Wade-Evans and Jenkins, 57Wade-Evans A. Jenkins J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 699-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) or with 50% ethylene glycol. Results were similar when proteins were eluted by either method. The protein was dialyzed into Dialysis Buffer containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol. Our initial experiments were conducted with all but p53(Ser-249) mutant protein, which was not yet available as a recombinant baculovirus. More recently, after successfully constructing this baculovirus, we repeated many of the experiments with the p53(Ser-249) protein and, where possible, have included them as well. To a solution of PAb 1801 (5 mg/ml) in 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.3) was added a 1/20 volume of cysteine from a 1 M stock and a 1/20 volume of EDTA from a 20 mM stock. After addition of 10 μg of papain per mg of antibody, reaction mixtures were incubated for 12 h at 37°C. Iodoacetamide was then added to a final concentration of 75 mM, and mixtures were incubated for 1 h at room temperature prior to dialysis in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). 1The abbreviations used are: PBSphosphate-buffered salineDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumEMSAelectromobility shift assay. phosphate-buffered saline Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium electromobility shift assay.

The synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides used in this study include the following: RGC, 5ʹ TCGAGTTGCCTGGACTTGCCTGGCCTTGCCTTTTC 3ʹ; mutant RGC, 5ʹ TCGAGTTTAATGGACTTTAATGGCCTTTAATTTTC 3ʹ; SCS, 5ʹ TCGAGCCGGGCATGTCCGGGCATGTCCGGGCATGTC 3ʹ; GADD45, 5ʹ AATTCTCGAGCCCAGCATGCTTAGACATGGTTCTGCTCGAG 3ʹ; and mutant GADD45, 5ʹ AATTCTCGAGCCCAGAATTCTTAGAAATTGTTCTGCTCGAG 3. The probes were 32P-labeled using the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase. Binding reaction mixtures contained 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 25 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM spermidine, 10% glycerol, 0.1 ng of bovine serum albumin, double-stranded poly[d(I-C)] (60 ng), and 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (8 ng). p53 protein concentrations are as indicated in figure legends, and in all cases volumes were equalized with Dialysis Buffer. Mixtures were incubated at the indicated temperatures for 30 min unless stated otherwise. In experiments with added antibodies the final reaction volumes remained at 20 μl. In time course of heating experiments, mixtures were incubated without the DNA probe for 0-10 min at 37°C; the probe was added, and reactions were incubated for 30 min at 25°C. In competition experiments unlabeled oligonucleotides were added at indicated concentrations directly to the reaction mixtures, and the binding reaction was continued for 30 min at 25°C. In all cases mixtures were then loaded onto a native 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5 x Tris borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40 and electrophoresed in 0.5 x TBE at 4°C at 180-200 V (not exceeding 40 mA current) for 2 h. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 25 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 μl of 40 mM spermidine, 1 μl of 10 mM dithiothreitol, 1 μl of 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 μl of 60 μg/ml double-stranded poly[d(I-C)], 1 μl of 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4 ng of 32P-labeled wild-type or mutant GADD45, and p53 protein were incubated for 30 min at 25°C. Reaction mixtures were filtered through 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filters presoaked in 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), containing 10 ng/μl double-stranded poly[d(I-C)], washed three times with 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), dried, and counted by liquid scintillation. H1299 cells at a density of 6 x 105 cells/6-cm dish were transfected by the calcium phosphate method with the p53 expressing pCMVneoBam or parental pCMVneoBam vectors (2 μg) containing wild-type or mutant p53s (Kern et al., 32Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1992; 256: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar) along with the mdm2 promoter reporter construct, pGL2-NA(mdm2)-luc (Juven et al., 28Juven T. Barak Y. Zauberman A. George D.L. Oren M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3411-3416PubMed Google Scholar), which contains the NsiI-ApaI fragment of the murine mdm2 gene cloned into the pGL2-Basic vector (Promega). Six hours after incubation with the precipitate at 37°C, cells were glycerol-shocked for 1 min (10% glycerol in DMEM) and then washed twice in DMEM before adding RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After incubation for an additional hour at 37°C, cells were transferred to an incubator maintained at 26°C and kept there for 42 h prior to extraction and determination of luciferase activity. Our studies were performed with wild-type p53 and five tumor-derived mutant p53 proteins that were immunopurified from recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells using a column containing the p53 monoclonal antibody PAb 421 (Wang et al., 59Wang E.H. Friedman P.N. Prives C. Cell. 1989; 57: 379-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We estimate that the proteins produced by this protocol are approximately 80% pure as judged by silver-stained protein gels (Fig. 1a). The slight differences in electrophoretic mobility of the various p53 proteins may be due to altered structure resulting from the mutation and/or possible polymorphism(s) elsewhere in p53, such as that at codon 72, shown to result in altered migration of p53 polypeptide (Matlashewski et al., 38Matlashewski G.J. Tuck S. Lamb P. Schneider J. Crawford L.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 961-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), we examined DNA binding by p53 proteins at 25 or 37°C to labeled oligonucleotides containing versions of the following p53 response elements: GADD45, RGC, and SCS (Fig. 1, b and c). GADD45 (Kastan et al., 29Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. El-Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 587-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2930) Google Scholar) and RGC (Kern et al., 31Kern S.E. Kinzler K.W. Bruskin A. Jarosz D. Friedman P. Prives C. Vogelstein B. Science. 1991; 252: 1708-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar) are sites that have been identified in human genomic DNA while SCS contains an optimized p53 consensus sequence derived from Halazonetis et al. (19Halazonetis T.D. Davis L.J. Kandil A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). At 25°C all mutants bound to the RGC and GADD45 oligonucleotides, albeit with varying efficiencies, while at 37°C binding to these sites was either undetectable or extraordinarily weak. Wild-type p53 binding was also decreased at the higher temperature, consistent with recent findings of Hainaut et al. (17Hainaut P. Butcher S. Milner J. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 71: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) who reported that DNA binding at 37°C by wild-type p53 synthesized in reticulocyte lysates is 30-40% of that observed at 25°C. While binding at 25°C by p53(Ala-143), p53(Trp-248), and p53(His-273) was robust, as quantitated by phosphorimaging, wild-type p53 bound at least 2-fold better than any mutant. DNA binding by either p53(His-175) or p53(Ser-249) mutant p53 proteins at 25°C was significantly less than the abovementioned three, displaying only ∼5 and 10% of wild-type p53 activity, respectively. We frequently observed that fresh preparations of p53(His-175) protein bound very well to DNA but then rapidly lost activity, indicating its conformational instability. By contrast, binding by p53(Ser-249), while initially weak, reproducibly showed no deterioration. Therefore, in many cases further studies were carried out with all mutant proteins except p53(His-175). To exclude the possibility that the loss of mutant p53 DNA binding at 37°C was due to the activation of a contaminating protease, Western blotting using three different p53 monoclonal antibodies was performed on DNA binding reaction mixtures that had been incubated at 25 or 37°C. Equivalent amounts of full-length, immunoreactive wild-type or mutant p53 polypeptides were detected after incubation at the two temperatures, showing that the loss of DNA binding at 37°C did not result from selective degradation of the mutant p53 proteins (data not shown). Although each mutant bound well to one or more sites at 25°C there were some notable differences. In particular, we were surprised to observe that p53(Trp-248) showed no detectable binding to the idealized SCS site at 25°C, even though p53(His-273) and p53(Ala-143) bound comparably well to this site, and wild-type p53 binds better to SCS than any other version of the consensus sequence (Halazonetis et al., 19Halazonetis T.D. Davis L.J. Kandil A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). 2P. Friedlander, Y. Legros, T. Soussi, and C. Prives, unpublished data. p53(His-175) did not bind to SCS either; however, its generally weaker binding to the other sites makes this observation less significant. There are two critical points to be made from these experiments. 1) All mutants tested have the potential to bind to DNA, and 2) the difference between wild-type and mutant forms of p53 at lower and higher temperatures is such that at physiological temperature wild-type p53 retains significant binding, whereas mutant p53 binding is virtually abolished. Although the mutant proteins bind well to several DNA sites at lower temperatures, there were concerns that this binding might reflect interactions with DNA that were essentially nonspecific. A nonspecific DNA binding function has been mapped to the C-terminal portion of p53 (Wang et al., 60Wang Y. Reed M. Wang P. Stenger J.E. Mayr G. Anderson M.E. Schwedes J.F. Tegtmeyer P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2575-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and in the absence of a functional central DNA binding domain, this region alone might be able to bind well to DNA in a sequence-independent manner. Moreover, we previously observed that while the proteolytically excised central “core” domain of wild-type p53 is capable of binding to DNA, the comparable domain released from p53(His-273) protein showed no detectable binding to DNA (Bargonetti et al., 5Bargonetti J. Manfredi J. Chen X. Marshak D.R. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2565-2574Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). To determine the specificity of DNA binding by mutant p53 proteins, we employed competition EMSA and filter binding assays. Using EMSA it was clear that different unlabeled oligonucleotides containing versions of the wild-type p53 binding site competed for binding to a labeled specific site oligonucleotide far better than did unlabeled oligonucleotides containing mutated binding sites (Fig. 2a). Although the amount of unlabeled binding site-containing DNA required for competition varied with the source of p53 and with the competitor, in all cases, at the highest level of competitor tested there were marked differences between the specific and nonspecific sources of DNA (Fig. 2a). Strong additional evidence for specificity of mutant p53 interactions with DNA was derived from filter binding experiments (Fig. 2, b and c) in which efficient binding to wild-type but not mutated p53 binding site oligonucleotides was determined. Since the mutant p53 proteins were temperature-sensitive for DNA binding it was of interest to determine whether they have any transcriptional activation capability in vivo at lower temperature. Numerous studies have shown that many mutant forms of p53 cannot activate transcription from biologically relevant p53-responsive genes in cells maintained at physiological temperatures (Vogelstein and Kinzler, 56Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 523-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar; Ko and Prives, 33Ko L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar). We tested whether mutant constructs are able to activate a reporter containing a segment of the murine mdm2 promoter, pGL2-NA(mdm2)-luc (Juven et al., 28Juven T. Barak Y. Zauberman A. George D.L. Oren M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3411-3416PubMed Google Scholar), following transfection into p53-null H1299 cells at a temperature at which mutant p53 proteins bind in vitro. This construct was chosen because we wished to test a biologically relevant p53-responsive promoter. As expected we confirmed that, in contrast to wild-type p53, these mutants were incapable of activating transcription from this promoter at 37°C (data not shown). In cells transfected at 32°C we observed that only Ala-143 had transactivation capability, while all other mutants tested were inert (data not shown). That Ala-143 is transcriptionally active at 32°C is consistent with experiments published by Zhang et al. (63Zhang W. Guo X. Gui-Ying H. Wen - Biao L. Shay J. Deisseroth A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2535-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). When the wild-type and mutant p53-expressing constructs were transfected into H1299 cells and then cells were shifted to 26°C, significant transactivation by three mutant p53 proteins, Ala-143, Trp-248 and His-273, was observed (Fig. 3). Ser-249 and His-175 mutant p53 constructs, however, did not detectably activate transcription over background levels seen with the empty vector. The failure of these latter two mutants to transactivate in vivo was not due to reduced expression since Western blotting of transfected cell extracts showed that all p53 constructs tested expressed detectable and roughly comparable levels of p53 protein (data not shown). These transient transfections were performed using a range of plasmid concentrations, and the values shown are the maximal plateau levels. Our data show that some mutant forms of p53 have the intrinsic ability to activate transcription from a physiologically relevant promoter. Those that cannot displayed greater impairment in DNA binding in vitro, suggesting a correlation between DNA binding and transactivation. Since wild-type p53 DNA binding was also somewhat temperature-sensitive, we conducted time course of heating experiments in order to examine the relative thermostability of the p53 proteins (Fig. 4). Wild-type or mutant p53 proteins were incubated in DNA binding buffer at 37°C for increasing periods; the RGC oligonucleotide was then added, and the reactions were incubated at 25°C for a further 30 min. While preheating for up to 10 min caused only a 15% loss in DNA binding by wild-type p53, by 7 min of preheating DNA binding by all mutants was reduced to approximately 5% of that seen at 25°C (Fig. 4). Note that the loss of binding by both the wild-type and mutant proteins was irreversible, as binding was not restored upon the shift to 25°C. There were also interesting differences among the mutants in their thermal inactivation properties; p53(Ala-143) and p53(Ser-249) proteins displayed the greatest temperature sensitivity with approximately 80-90% of their binding lost following 2 min of preheating (Fig. 4). By contrast, 2 min of preheating reproducibly actually caused a 2-fold increase in the DNA binding ability of both p53(His-273) and p53(Trp-248) proteins (Fig. 4). This transient stimulation was observed with a wild-type RGC oligonucleotide but not with mtRGC, suggesting that the increased binding is specific (data not shown). To further understand the thermal sensitivity of p53 proteins, DNA binding over a range of temperatures (25-37°C) was examined (data not shown). As expected, with increasing temperatures, all p53 proteins showed decreased ability to bind to an oligonucleotide containing the RGC site, although there was a relatively far sharper decline with the mutants than with wild-type form of p53 with the most drastic relative decrease in mutant p53 binding occurring between 33 and 37°C. Several studies have documented the regulation of p53 sequence-specific DNA binding by sequences and sites within its C terminus. In particular, the monoclonal antibody PAb 421 (Harlow et al., 20Harlow E. Crawford L.V. Pim D.C. Williamson N.M. J. Virol. 1981; 39: 861-869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that interacts with an epitope (amino acids 373-381) within the C terminus of p53 (Wade-Evans and Jenkins, 57Wade-Evans A. Jenkins J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 699-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) can enhance the DNA binding function of wild-type (Hupp et al., 24Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar; Halazonetis et al., 19Halazonetis T.D. Davis L.J. Kandil A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and even certain mutant forms (Hupp et al., 25Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3167-3174Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar; Halazonetis et al., 19Halazonetis T.D. Davis L.J. Kandil A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) of p53. Thus, it was of interest to compare the effect of PAb 421 on mutant p53 binding at lower and physiological temperatures. p53 proteins were incubated with oligonucleotides containing p53 binding sites at 25 or 37°C in the presence or absence of PAb 421. As a control, we used an antibody that recognizes an epitope (amino acids 46-55) within the N terminus of p53, PAb 1801 (Banks et al., 2Banks L. Matlashewski G. Crawford L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 159: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar; Legros et al., 34Legros Y. Lafon C. Soussi T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2071-2076PubMed Google Scholar). PAb 421 increased DNA binding by mutant p53 proteins at 25°C (Fig. 5). However, binding in the presence of PAb 421 was significantly reduced at 37°C. Additionally, DNA binding by wild-type p53 synthesized in vitro in reticulocyte extracts was stimulated by PAb 421 at 25°C but rather poorly at 37°C.2 These experiments therefore show that while PAb 421 increases the DNA binding function of wild-type and mutant p53 proteins at 25°C, this stimulation is reduced at 37°C and is thus temperature-sensitive. It should be noted, however, that at 37°C there was detectable binding in the presence of PAb 421, which was greater than that seen in its absence. Surprisingly, in contrast to the results obtained with PAb 421 at 37°C, the control antibody PAb 1801 showed strong rescue of mutant p53 binding at 37°C (Fig. 5, a and b). Although very little stimulation of p53 binding to DNA by PAb 1801 was observed at 25°C, this monoclonal antibody prevented loss of binding at 37°C by all mutants test"
https://openalex.org/W1999859103,"The functional mapping of the human cytochrome P4502D6 (CYP2D6) promoter in HepG2 cells revealed the presence of both positive and negative regulatory elements. One of these regulatory elements overlapped a sequence that is highly conserved in most members of the CYP2 family. This element, which consists of a degenerate AGGTCA direct repeat spaced by 1 base pair (DR1) and is known to be a target for members of the steroid receptor superfamily, was found to bind in vitro translated hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) in gel retardation analysis. Using HepG2 nuclear extracts, three protein-DNA complexes were formed on the DR1 element, one of which was confirmed to be dependent on the binding of HNF4. The other DR1 complexes were shown to be due to the interaction of the orphan receptor chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor I (COUP-TFI). Experiments in COS-7 cells showed that HNF4 could activate the CYP2D6 promoter 30-fold. Surprisingly, mutation of the DR1 element produced a relatively minor 23% decrease in activity in HepG2 cells. Additionally, COUP-TFI was shown to inhibit HNF4 stimulation of the CYP2D6 promoter in COS-7 cells, suggesting that COUP-TFI could attenuate the effect of HNF4 in HepG2 cells. However, when HNF4 levels were increased in HepG2 cells by co-transfection, it resulted in the enhancement of CYP2D6 promoter activity, indicating that HNF4 could overcome the repressive effect of COUP-TFI. Therefore, the contribution of the DR1 element in controlling the transcription of the CYP2D6 gene depends on the balance between positively and negatively acting transcription factors.

Therefore, the contribution of the DR1 element in controlling the transcription of the CYP2D6 gene depends on the balance between positively and negatively acting transcription factors. The cytochrome P450 superfamily represents a group of enzymes that are involved in the oxidative metabolism of both endogenous and foreign compound (1Nelson D.R. Kamataki T. Waxman D.J. Guengerich F.P. Estabrook R.W. Feyereisen R. Gonzalez F.J. Coon M.J. Gunsalus I.C. Gotoh O. Okuda K. Nebert D.W.

The expression of P450 genes is subject to diverse regulatory controls, which display tissue-specific, sex-specific, and developmental patterns (2Gonzalez F.J. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1990; 45: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Most foreign compound-metabolizing P450s are mainly expressed in the liver; however, some enzymes can also be detected in extrahepatic tissues such as lung, kidney, and intestine and in the brain (2Gonzalez F.J. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1990; 45: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Certain hepatic P450s are constitutively expressed, while others are known to be induced by various foreign chemicals including phenobarbital, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and peroxisome proliferators (3Denison M.S. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18175-18178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The latter two classes of chemicals act through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (4Fujisawa-Sehara A. Yamane M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5859-5863Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (5Issemann I. Green S. Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3059) Google Scholar), respectively, while the exact mechanism(s) responsible for transducing the response to phenobarbital have yet to be elucidated (3Denison M.S. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18175-18178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In addition, the expression of some P450 enzymes can be modulated by endogenous steroid and peptide hormones (3Denison M.S. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18175-18178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 6Mode A. J. Reprod. Fert. Suppl. 1993; 46: 77-86PubMed Google Scholar). In rodents for example, the sexually dimorphic expression of certain P450s is controlled by the sex-specific pattern of growth hormone secretion (6Mode A. J. Reprod. Fert. Suppl. 1993; 46: 77-86PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the regulatory effects on P450 expression are at the transcriptional level. However in some instances, such as the induction of cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1) 1The abbreviations used are: CYPncytochrome P450n (eg.

Within the P450 superfamily, the CYP2 family is the largest and most diverse (1Nelson D.R. Kamataki T. Waxman D.J. Guengerich F.P. Estabrook R.W. Feyereisen R. Gonzalez F.J. Coon M.J. Gunsalus I.C. Gotoh O. Okuda K. Nebert D.W. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). This family, whose members are mainly expressed in the liver, contains many of the drug-metabolizing isoforms and also some of the enzymes involved in the metabolism of endogenous substrates (for review see 8Henderson C.J. Wolf C.R. Gibson G.G. Progress in Drug Metabolism. Vol 13. Taylor & Francis, London1992: 73Google Scholar). In addition to the constitutively expressed CYP2 members, this family also contains isoforms that are regulated by phenobarbital, ethanol, and growth hormone (8Henderson C.J. Wolf C.R. Gibson G.G. Progress in Drug Metabolism. Vol 13. Taylor & Francis, London1992: 73Google Scholar). Regarding the study of CYP2 gene regulatory DNA elements and their corresponding transacting transcription factors, relatively little is known in comparison to members of the CYP1 family or some of the steroid metabolizing P450s (2Gonzalez F.J. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1990; 45: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Research in this area has been hampered by the difficulty in maintaining the expression of, or the ability to induce, P450s in isolated hepatocytes or liver-derived cell lines. As a result, most of the data generated to date comes from studies using transient transfection of promoter constructs into various hepatoma cell lines. Nevertheless, using this approach some information has been obtained about the transcriptional control of the CYP2 genes. The transcription of the CYP2E1 gene was reported to be partly controlled by HNF1α (9Ueno T. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4495-4505Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and that of CYP2C6 by DBP (10Yano M. Falvey E. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 2847-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), both of these transcription factors being hepatocyte-enriched. A phenobarbital-responsive region was identified in the chicken CYP2H1 gene using transient transfection of primary chicken hepatocytes (11Hahn C.N. Hansen A.J. May B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17031-17039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a functional glucocorticoid response element was identified in the rat CYP2B2 gene promoter (12Jaiswal A.K. Haaparanta T. Luc P.V. Schembri J. Adesnik M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4237-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Analysis of the rabbit CYP2C1 and CYP2C2 promoters in HepG2 cells revealed the presence of a regulatory element, which was shown to be a target for HNF4 (13Chen D. Lepar G. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5420-5427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a member of the steroid receptor superfamily (14Sladek F.M. Zhong W. Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Co-expression of HNF4 in COS-1 cells resulted in the induction of the CYP2C2 promoter (13Chen D. Lepar G. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5420-5427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutation of the CYP2C2 HNF4 element resulted in a marked decrease in promoter activity in HepG2 cells (13Chen D. Lepar G. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5420-5427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This HNF4 element has been reported to be conserved in other members of the CYP2 family, and it was proposed to be of importance in the transcriptional control of other CYP2 genes (13Chen D. Lepar G. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5420-5427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional studies have also demonstrated a role for HNF4 in the transcriptional control of the human CYP2C9 gene (15Ibeanu G.C. Goldstein J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8028-8036Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, in contrast, studies of the rat CYP2C genes (CYP2C7, CYP2C11, CYP2C12, and CYP2C13) demonstrated that co-expressed HNF4 gave only a maximal 3-fold induction of promoter activity in COS-7 cells (16Strom A. Westin S. Eguchi H. Gustafsson J.-A. Mode A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11276-11281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutation of the HNF4 binding site in the respective promoters had no effect on the activity of the 2C7 or 2C11 promoters in HepG2 cells, while it caused decreases to 60 and 80% in the activity of CYP2C13 and CYP2C12 promoters, respectively (16Strom A. Westin S. Eguchi H. Gustafsson J.-A. Mode A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11276-11281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Regarding the CYP2D subfamily, using in vitro transcription analysis and transient transfections into HepG2 cells, it was possible to identify basal and sex-specific regulatory elements in the mouse CYP2D genes (17Yoshioka H. Lang M. Wong G. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14612-14617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Yokomori N. Kobayashi R. Moore R. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5355-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Another CYP2D promoter that has been analyzed is that of the rat CYP2D5 gene, where it was reported that C/EBP and Sp1 cooperate in controlling its transcriptional activity (19Lee Y.-L. Yano M. Liu S.-Y. Matsunaga E. Johnson P.F. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1383-1394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There was no evidence presented in support of a role for the HNF4 binding site in the modulation of CYP2D5 expression (19Lee Y.-L. Yano M. Liu S.-Y. Matsunaga E. Johnson P.F. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1383-1394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human CYP2D6 is known to play a major role in the metabolism of a wide range of clinically important drugs (20Daly A.K. Cholerton S. Gregory W. Idle J.R. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1993; 57: 129-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). It is also polymorphic, with 5-10% of the Caucasian population classified as poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates (21Daly A.K. Armstrong M. Monkman S.C. Idle M.E. Idle J.R. Pharmacogenetics. 1991; 1: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This is caused by mutations within the gene resulting in the absence of CYP2D6 protein (22Gough A.C. Miles J.S. Spurr N.K. Moss J.E. Gaedigk A. Eichelbaum M. Wolf C.R. Nature. 1990; 347: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). This polymorphism was subsequently reported to be associated with the incidence of various forms of cancer (23Wolf C.R. Smith C.A.D. Gough A.C. Moss J.E. Vallis K.A. Howard G. Carey F.J. Mills K. McNee W. Carmichael J. Spurr N.K. Carcinogenesis. 1992; 13: 1035-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and the susceptibility to Parkinson's disease (24Smith C.A.D. Gough A.C. Leigh P.N. Summers B.A. Harding A.E. Maranganore D.M. Sturman S.G. Schapira A.H.V. Williams A.C. Spurr N.K. Wolf C.R. Lancet. 1992; 339: 1375-1377Abstract PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The CYP2D6 protein was also reported to be absent until the first week after birth (25Treluyer J.-M. Jacqz-Aigrain E. Alvarez F. Cresteil T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), suggesting that its expression might be repressed by maternal hormones. Given that the levels of CYP2D6 expression may be critical in the responsiveness to certain clinically used drugs and in disease susceptibility, it is important to understand how CYP2D6 expression is controlled at the transcriptional level. Therefore, in this paper, we have performed the functional analysis of the CYP2D6 promoter and investigated what role the HNF4 binding site plays in controlling transcription of the CYP2D6 gene. First, the results indicate that both positive and negative regulatory elements contribute toward promoter activity. Second, although the HNF4 binding site alone appears to play a relatively minor role in HepG2 cells, the findings indicate that the balance between HNF4 and negatively acting transcription factors is an important factor. HepG2 and COS-7 cells were grown in monolayer and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37°C in 5% CO2. DNA transfections were carried out by the calcium phosphate method (26Parker B.A. Stark G.R. J. Virol. 1979; 31: 360-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as described by Gorman (27Gorman C. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. Vol 3. IRL Press, Oxford1986: 143Google Scholar) with the exception that the glycerol step was omitted. Cells were harvested 24-36 h after transfection, extracts were prepared, and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity was assayed as described by Gorman et al. (28Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were assayed for protein content (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217507) Google Scholar). All CAT assays were performed such that the rate of acetylation was in the linear range. In all experiments, the values given represent the mean ± S.E. of at least three experiments. A minimum of two plasmid preparations were used for each construct. Cells were also co-transfected with pSVgal (Promega) to assay for β-galactosidase activity as a control for transfection efficiency. Using this technique, transfection efficiency was found to vary by less than 10%. The expression plasmid pCMVHNF4 was kindly provided by Prof. B. Kemper (13Chen D. Lepar G. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5420-5427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the pMTHNF4 and pMTEAR3 constructs were gifts from Dr. J. Ladias (30Ladias J.A.A. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kardassis D. Cardot P. Cheng J. Zannis V. Cladaras C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15849-15860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the expression of HNF4 and COUP-TFI in COS-7 cells, 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks were transfected with 10 μg of pMTHNF4 or pMTEAR3, respectively, as described above. After 36 h, cells were harvested, and whole cell extracts were prepared by three cycles of freeze-thawing in 0.4 mM KCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 20% (w/v) glycerol. Extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C to remove debris, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to a final concentration of 1 mM. The CYP2D6 promoter was isolated by polymerase chain reaction from human genomic DNA using the upstream oligonucleotide 5ʹ-CAGATAAGCTTGCTGAAGGTCACTCT-3ʹ (with HindIII site) and downstream oligonucleotide 5ʹ-GGGCTCCTCTAGACACACCTCCCACC-3ʹ (with XbaI site). The resulting promoter fragment (-392 to +56) was subcloned between the HindIII and XbaI sites in pCATbasic (Promega) and checked by sequencing. Deletion fragments of the CYP2D6 promoter were generated using the Erase-a-Base system following the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). After confirming the sequence of the various promoter fragments, they were subcloned into the HindIII and XbaI sites of pCATbasic (Promega) after the addition of a HindIII linker at the 5ʹ end. The -69CATMUT construct was prepared by polymerase chain reaction using the 5ʹ-mutated oligonucleotide with HindIII linker 5ʹ-TTGGAAGCTTTTCACTCACAGCAGCTTTACACTTAATCATCAGCTCCC-3ʹ and the 3ʹ oligonucleotide with XbaI linker 5ʹ-AACCTCTAGACACACCTGGCACCCCCACCC-3ʹ. After sequencing, the mutated fragment was subcloned into the HindIII and XbaI sites of pCATbasic (Promega). Nuclear extracts from HepG2 cells were prepared as described by Dignam et al. (31Dignam S.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled probe for DNA-binding reactions was prepared by isolating the promoter fragment spanning -69 to +56 from -69CAT, dephosphorylating the DNA with alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim), and phosphorylating with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Corp.; >5000 Ci/mmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). Binding reactions of 20 μl were carried out in buffer containing 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), 50 mM KCl, 0.1-0.3 ng of radiolabeled probe, and the indicated amount of protein. Reactions were incubated at 20°C for 20 min. Free and protein-bound DNA were separated on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 37.5:1 (v/v)) gels, which were run at 4°C and a constant voltage of 200 V in 0.25 x TBE (22 mM Tris borate, 0.5 mM EDTA). Where indicated, competitor oligonucleotides or specific antiserum was included in the DNA-binding reactions. The CTE oligonucleotide corresponds to the sequence spanning -69 to -28 of the CYP2D6 promoter, which includes the degenerate AGGTCA direct repeat separated by one base pair (DR1) element 5ʹ-TTCACTCACAGCAGAGGGCAAAGGCCATCATCAGCTCCCTTT-3ʹ. The Sp1 oligonucleotide corresponds to the Sp1 consensus sequence 5ʹ-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3ʹ from the SV40 early promoter (32Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (878) Google Scholar). Anti-HNF4 antiserum was kindly provided by Dr. Francis Sladek (14Sladek F.M. Zhong W. Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Anti-COUP antiserum was kindly provided by Dr. Ming-Jer Tsai (33Wang L.H. Tsai S.Y. Cook R.G. Beattie W.G. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Nature. 1989; 340: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Gel retardation analysis with COS-7 whole cell extracts was carried out under the conditions described above. The plasmid pSG5HNF4 (gift from Dr. Francis Sladek (14Sladek F.M. Zhong W. Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar)), was linearized with BglII. T7 RNA polymerase was then used to generate HNF4 transcript, which was then translated using rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Reactions were carried out in a final volume of 25 μl containing 17.5 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega), 20 μM amino acids (including methionine), 20 units of RNasin (Promega), and 0.5 μg of HNF4 transcript. Reactions were incubated for 90 min at 30°C. In order to determine potential regulatory elements in the CYP2D6 promoter, progressive 5ʹ deletions were generated. The various promoter fragments were then fused to the CAT gene in pCATbasic and transiently transfected into HepG2 cells to assay for promoter activity. As can be seen in Fig. 1, the fusion of CYP2D6 promoter sequences from -392 to +56 upstream of the CAT gene resulted in the 30-fold induction of CAT activity when compared with pCATbasic. No activity was observed when the same construct was transfected into HeLa cells (data not shown). The deletion of sequences from -392 to -308 resulted in a 28% drop in activity in HepG2 cells, and further deletion to -242 had no additional effect. However, removal of sequences down to -156 produced an additional 2-fold decrease in activity. The presence of a negative regulatory element between -128 and -90 was indicated by the approximately 2-fold increase in CAT activity. Further deletions to -69 and -18 produced additional 2.5- and 3.5-fold decreases in activity, respectively. Therefore, the deletion analysis revealed the presence of four positively acting regulatory regions (-392/-308, -242/-156, -90/-69, and -69/-18), and one negative element (-128/-90). It is noteworthy that none of the deletions produced a difference in activity in excess of 2-3-fold, despite that fact that overall promoter activity was 20-30-fold higher than pCATbasic. This would suggest that these regulatory elements work together to control the activity of the CYP2D6 promoter. The deletion of sequences between -69 and -18 produced the largest change in CAT activity (Fig. 1). This region contains, in addition to the TATA-box, a sequence that is highly conserved within the CYP2 family (13Chen D. Lepar G. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5420-5427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2A). This element consists of a DR1. In addition to the high degree of conservation, perhaps the most striking feature is the fact that the nucleotide at the fourth position in both half-sites of every element is nonconserved with respect to the consensus DR1. Whether this characteristic has any functional significance is unclear at present. The DR1 elements of other CYP2 genes have been reported to bind HNF4 (13Chen D. Lepar G. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5420-5427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ibeanu G.C. Goldstein J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8028-8036Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 16Strom A. Westin S. Eguchi H. Gustafsson J.-A. Mode A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11276-11281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined if the CYP2D6 DR1 was a target for in vitro translated HNF4 in gel retardation analysis. The addition of in vitro translated HNF4 to the radiolabeled -69/+56 promoter fragment containing the DR1 element resulted in the formation of one major (complex A) and one minor (complex b) protein-DNA complex (Fig. 2B, lane 2). Complex A was shown to be specific, since it was competed out by the addition of an oligonucleotide (CTE) spanning the DR1 site (lane 3) but not by an unrelated oligonucleotide (Sp1) corresponding to the Sp1 consensus sequence from the SV40 early promoter (lane 4). Complex b was observed to be nonspecific, since its formation was not abolished by the addition of the CTE oligonucleotide (lane 3) or the unlabeled -69/+56 fragment (data not shown). Indeed, this complex was observed to be due to the reticulocyte lysate itself, since it was also seen using nonprogrammed lysate (lane 5). The identity of complex A was confirmed as being due to HNF4 by the addition of anti-HNF4 antiserum, which produced a supershift of the protein-DNA complex (lane 7), which was not seen with the nonimmune serum (lane 8). In order to test which nuclear proteins from HepG2 cells could bind to the CYP2D6 DR1 element, gel retardation analysis was performed using nuclear extracts. As shown in Fig. 2C (lane 1), the addition of HepG2 nuclear protein resulted in the formation of three protein-DNA complexes (complexes 1-3) on the -69/+56 promoter fragment. All of these complexes were observed to bind specifically to the DR1 sequence, since their formation was abolished by the addition of CTE oligonucleotide (lane 2) but not by Sp1 oligonucleotide (lane 3). Since HNF4 was previously shown to be capable of binding to this DR1 element Fig. 2B), we examined if any of the complexes were due to the interaction of HNF4. Subsequently, complex 2 was shown to be dependent on the interaction of HNF4 as it was supershifted by the inclusion of anti-HNF4 antiserum in the DNA-binding reaction (Fig. 2C, lane 5). This supershift was observed to be specific, since the antiserum had no effect on the mobility of the other two complexes, and the addition of nonimmune serum to the DNA-binding reactions had no effect (lane 6). It was noted that when HNF4 was effectively removed from the DNA-binding reaction by its antiserum, the intensity of complex 1 increased (lane 5), suggesting that HNF4 and the factor responsible for the formation of complex 1 may bind to the DR1 element in a mutually exclusive manner. It was previously demonstrated that DR1 elements from other genes could be recognized by not only HNF4, but also by other members of the steroid receptor family, including COUP-TFI (EAR3), ARP1 (COUP-TFII), EAR2, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR), (30Ladias J.A.A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 890-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested if any of the unidentified complexes formed by HepG2 nuclear extracts on the CYP2D6 DR1 element were due to the interaction of other members of the steroid receptor superfamily. Based on what was already reported in the literature, the most obvious candidates were COUP-TFI/ARP1. These two proteins are highly homologous members of the steroid receptor family (36Ladias J.A.A. Karathanasis S.K. Science. 1991; 251: 561-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), and ARP1 has also been termed COUP-TFII. As Fig. 2D demonstrates, the addition of HepG2 nuclear extracts to radiolabeled -69/+56 fragment resulted in the formation of the same three complexes (lane 2). The inclusion of anti-COUP antiserum (which recognizes both COUP-TFI and ARP1 (37Mietus-Snyder M. Sladek F.M. Ginsburg G.S. Kuo C.F. Ladias J.A.A. Darnell Jr., J.E. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1708-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar)) in the DNA-binding reactions, resulted in the inhibition of complex 1 and the disappearance of complex 3, with the concomitant appearance of supershifted complexes (lane 3). None of the complexes were affected by the addition of nonimmune serum (lane 4). The identification of COUP-TFI/ARP1 as being responsible for the formation of complex 1 was in agreement with the observed relative mobilities of HNF4 and COUP-TFI/ARP1 reported by other groups (37Mietus-Snyder M. Sladek F.M. Ginsburg G.S. Kuo C.F. Ladias J.A.A. Darnell Jr., J.E. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1708-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The observation that complex 3 was also supershifted by anti-COUP antiserum suggests that its formation was also dependent on COUP-TFI/ARP1. Alternatively, the factor(s) responsible could be antigenically related to COUP-TFs. However, results from gel retardation analysis using whole cell extracts from COS-7 cells transfected with a COUP-TFI expression vector support the former (see Fig. 5A), where the addition of COUP-TFI resulted in the formation of two protein-DNA complexes similar in mobility to complexes 1 and 3. In order to investigate if HNF4 was capable of activating the CYP2D6 promoter, co-transfection experiments were performed in COS-7 cells (see Fig. 3). In contrast to the results obtained from HepG2 cells, the transfection of -392CAT into COS-7 cells did not result in any enhancement of CAT activity above that observed with pCATbasic.

As a step toward understanding how different neurotrophins are sorted and secreted by neurons, we expressed nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and neurotrophin-3 in cell lines used as models for neuronal protein sorting. All three neurotrophins were secreted by a regulated pathway in transfected AtT-20 and PC12 neuroendocrine cells, with a 3-6-fold increase in neurotrophin release in response to 8-bromo-cAMP or depolarization, respectively. To determine if the propeptide directs the intracellular sorting of mature NGF, we examined mutants in which regions spanning the propeptide were deleted. These mutants underwent regulated release in every case in which expression could be detected. Similarly, NGF sorting was not significantly altered by mutations which specifically abolished N-glycosylation or proteolytic processing sites within the NGF precursor. Finally, we found that all three neurotrophins were secreted 65-75% basolaterally by polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells. These findings suggest that the determinants of regulated neurotrophin secretion lie within the mature neurotrophin moiety and that NGF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and neurotrophin-3 are likely to be sorted similarly and released in a regulated manner by neurons.

BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4/5 constitute the neurotrophins, a family of structurally related, dimeric proteins that play a critical role in the survival and differentiation of specific neuronal populations in the developing and adult nervous systems (1Snider W.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 627-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar, 2Davies A.M. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1334-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 3Korsching S. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 248-2739Crossref Google Scholar). Neurotrophins have traditionally been considered in the context of the “neurotrophic hypothesis,” which holds that neurons compete for limiting amounts of factors secreted by the target tissue, with only the successful competitors surviving and establishing functional connections (4Levi-Montalcini R. Science. 1987; 237: 1154-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (2689) Google Scholar). In the periphery, (non-neuronal) target tissues are believed to secrete neurotrophins constitutively and regulate neurotrophin mRNA independent of neuronal input (5Barth E.M. Korsching S. Thoenen H. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 6Shelton D.L. Reichardt L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1940-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recent studies, however, have unveiled additional complexities in how neurotrophins function. For example, neurotrophins have been implicated in a variety of activity-dependent processes in the central nervous system (reviewed in 7Lo D.C. Neuron. 1995; 15: 979-981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar an 8) including ocular dominance column formation (9Cabelli R.J. Hohn A. Shatz C.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1662-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), activity-dependent survival of cortical neurons (10Ghosh A. Carnahan J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1994; 263: 1618-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar), axonal sprouting, and the long term enhancement of synaptic transmission (11Kang H. Schuman E.M. Science. 1995; 267: 1658-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that the expression and/or release of neurotrophins may be regulated by activity. Furthermore, autocrine or paracrine, as opposed to target-derived, interactions appear to promote the survival of some mature neurons (10Ghosh A. Carnahan J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1994; 263: 1618-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, 12Acheson A. Conover J.C. Fandl J.P. DeChiara T.M. Russell M. Thadani A. Squinto S.P. Yancopoulos G.D. Lindsay R.M.

Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1688-1700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and neurotrophins may also be transported in anterograde direction and participate in neuron to target signaling (14von Bartheld C.S. Byers M.R. Williams R. Bothwell M. Nature. 1996; 379: 830-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 15Schecterson L.C. Bothwell M.

Since neurons are polarized cells that can target proteins to at least two distinct domains (the axon and somatodendritic domain) and can secrete proteins in either a regulated or constitutive manner, understanding how neurotrophins function requires an understanding of how the neurotrophins are intracellularly sorted and secreted. nerve growth factor brain-derived neurotrophic factor neurotrophin Madin-Darby canine kidney Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay bovine serum albumin cycloheximide polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis bromo. The neurotrophins are initially synthesized as precursors containing an amino-terminal propeptide that is proteolytically processed to release the mature neurotrophin. In the case of NGF, this propeptide is glycosylated (17Edwards R.H. Selby M.J. Mobley W.C. Weinrich S.L. Hruby D.E. Rutter W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2456-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 18Suter U. Heymach Jr., J. Shooter E.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2395-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), contains multiple potential cleavage sites, and is required for the proper folding of mature NGF (18Suter U. Heymach Jr., J. Shooter E.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2395-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Because neurotrophins are normally expressed at extremely low levels, little is known about how they are sorted and secreted in vivo by neurons and other cell types. When heterologously expressed in AtT-20 neuroendocrine cells, in human insuloma (HIT) cells (17Edwards R.H. Selby M.J. Mobley W.C. Weinrich S.L. Hruby D.E. Rutter W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2456-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), or in hippocampal neurons (19Blochl A. Thoenen H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1220-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), NGF was found to be secreted via a regulated secretory pathway. Despite these advances, however, fundamental questions about neurotrophin sorting and secretion remain unanswered. For example: are all members of the neurotrophin family released via a regulated secretory pathway? Are there sorting differences between members of the neurotrophin family which are functionally significant, as there are in the platlet-derived growth factor and fibroblast growth factor families (20Andersson M. Ostman A. Westermark B. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 926-930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Acland P. Dixon M. Peters G. Dickson C. Nature. 1990; 343: 662-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar)? Finally, what regions or motifs within the neurotrophin precursor play a role in directing the neurotrophins to specific secretory pathways or subcellular domains? To address these questions, we have analyzed neurotrophin secretion in cell lines that are well established model systems for the study of neuronal secretion and targeting. The rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line and the mouse pituitary AtT-20 cell line sort proteins into the regulated secretory pathway (22Chavez R.A. Chen Y.T. Schmidt W.K. Carnell L. Moore H.P. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 263-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and possess dense core granules that are similar to neuronal large dense core vesicles in terms of size, morphology, and composition (reviewed in 23Martin T.F.

PC12 cells, but apparently not AtT-20 cells, also contain synaptic-like microvesicles which resembles neuronal synaptic vesicles (25Clift-o'Grady L. Linstedt A.D. Lowe A.W. Grote E. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Both cell lines share a number of other characteristics with neurons such as electrically excitable membranes and the ability to extend neurites with growth cones (26Surprenant A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27Tooze J. Hollinshead M. Fuller S.D. Tooze S.A. Huttner W.B. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 49: 259-273PubMed Google Scholar). In order to investigate the vectorial targeting of neurotrophins in polarized cells, MDCK cells were used. This is an epithelial cell line which targets surface-bound proteins to one of two distinct domains, the apical and basolateral membranes, by a mechanism which is likely to be, in at least some cases, similar to that used by neurons to sort proteins to axons and dendrites, respectively (28Dotti C.G. Simons K. Cell. 1990; 62: 63-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 29Dotti C.G. Parton R.G. Simons K. Nature. 1991; 349: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In this study we have used transient and stable transfection of NGF, BDNF, and NT-3 to compare the intracellular sorting of the different neurotrophins in AtT-20 and PC12 cells. We have also used site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the role of the NGF propeptide and to determine if mechanisms that are known to influence protein sorting such as N-linked glycosylation (30Scheiffele P. Peranen J. Simons K. Nature. 1995; 378: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), proteolytic processing (31Jung L.J. Scheller R.H.

We show that NGF, BDNF, and NT-3 are all sorted into the regulated pathway in both types of neuroendocrine cells. Furthermore, this targeting does not require N-glycosylation or proteolytic processing of the NGF propeptide and is not affected by deletions scanning most of the propeptide. These findings suggest that different neurotrophins are sorted and secreted similarly, and information required for this sorting is likely to lie within the mature neurotrophin rather than the propeptide. The cDNA for mouse NGF, rat BDNF, and rat NT-3 were all subcloned into pBJ-5, an SRα-based expression plasmid (35Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell.

COS-7 cells and PC12 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 6% horse serum, 6% bovine calf serum (Hyclone). AtT-20-F2 cells (obtained from A. Lowe) and MDCK type II cells (J clone, obtained from W. J. Nelson) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Penicillin and streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) were added to both media. COS cells were transfected and metabolically labeled for 3 h with 100 μCi of [35S]cysteine (Amersham Corp.) as described previously (18Suter U. Heymach Jr., J. Shooter E.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2395-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). AtT-20 were stably transfected as described previously (22Chavez R.A. Chen Y.T. Schmidt W.K. Carnell L. Moore H.P. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 263-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: 80 μg of expression plasmid and 20 μg of SV2-neo were used to transfect 1 x 106 cells by the calcium phosphate method (Specialty Media transfection kit). Neurotrophin-expressing clones were selected using cloning cylinders and screened by ELISA. Transient transfections of AtT-20, PC12, and MDCK cells were performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as indicated in manufacturer's instructions. The following amounts of expression plasmid DNA and LipofectAMINE were used to transfect 2-3 x 106 cells/10-cm plate: for AtT-20 cells, 25 μg of DNA and 100 μl of LipofectAMINE; for PC12 cells, 12 μg of DNA and 75 μl of reagent; for MDCK cells, 5 μg of DNA and 15 μl of LipofectAMINE. COS cells were transiently transfected using the DEAE-dextran/chloroquine method as described previously (18Suter U. Heymach Jr., J. Shooter E.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2395-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). AtT-20 cells were removed from a single 10-cm plate by trypsinization 24 h post-transfection, equally distributed to the wells of a six-well plate, and allowed to grow for an additional 40-48 h in full medium. Cells were then washed twice with DMEM, and three wells were incubated in DMEM, 0.2% BSA (unstimulated controls), while the other three were stimulated by incubation in DMEM, 0.2% BSA with 5 mM 8-Br-cAMP (Sigma) added. Conditioned medium was removed after 6 h and cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation; in some experiments the cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 0.2% BSA, 1 mM EDTA, and protease inhibitors. Neurotrophin content of conditioned medium or lysate was measured by ELISA as described previously (36Heymach Jr., J.V. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12297-12304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and the results from the three stimulated or unstimulated samples were averaged. Control experiments using purified NGF standards indicated that the use of lysis buffer did not appreciably alter the amount of NGF detectable by ELISA. For cycloheximide (CHX) and actinomycin D experiments, the transfected cells were washed and incubated in DMEM, 0.2% BSA containing 100 μg/ml CHX or 10 mM actinomycin D for 1.5 h to inhibit new protein synthesis. Cells were then washed again and incubated for 4 h in the same medium as in the pretreatment. Media and cell lysates were subsequently collected and assayed as described above. Neurotrophin secretion by transiently transfected PC12 cells was analyzed in a similar manner with the following modifications. Since PC12 cells differentiate in the presence of NGF, 10 ng/ml purified mouse 2.5S NGF (Harlan Bioproducts) was added the medium for all cells 8 h post-transfection; this caused mock-transfected or NT-3-expressing cells to extend neurites to a similar extent as NGF-expressing cells. 72 h post-transfection the NGF-containing medium was removed, and the cells were washed three times with DMEM. Depolarization-induced secretion was then stimulated by adding 50 mM KCl to DMEM, 0.2% BSA medium during the 15-min incubation. Similar results were obtained when modified Hanks' buffer (125 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 μm ZnCl2, 10 mM glucose, 25 mM HEPES, 0.2% BSA, pH 7.4) instead of DMEM was used, and depolarization was induced in modified Hanks' buffer containing 50 mM KCl and 80 mM NaCl. 2.5 x 106 MDCK cells were seeded and grown on 24.5-mm collagen-coated Transwell filters (Costar; 0.4-μm pore size) as described previously (37Nelson W.J.

In general, for each neurotrophin-expressing cell line studied, four filters were seeded in parallel. Three days after seeding, one filter was tested for the presence of functional tight junctions by measuring the diffusion of [3H]inulin (DuPont NEN) from the apical to basolateral compartment for 1 h; filters were used only if the monolayer inhibited greater than 99% of the inulin diffusion. Medium from the other three filters was changed, collected after an additional 24-h incubation, and assayed by ELISA. The percent of neurotrophin secreted into the apical and basolateral compartments was determined for each individual filter, and results from the three filters were averaged. Filter-grown cells were metabolically labeled by incubating for 1 h in labeling medium (DMEM lacking cysteine with 1% dialyzed fetal calf serum added), then adding 250 μCi of [35S]cysteine in labeling medium to the basolateral compartment. After 3-h continuous labeling, the conditioned medium was withdrawn, immunoprecipitated with NGF antiserum, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. gp81 (clusterin) (39Kondor-Koch C. Bravo R. Fuller S.D. Cutler D.

Transient transfection experiments were performed as follows: 3 x 106 cells in 1 ml of serum-free DMEM was combined with a 200-μl DNA/LipofectAMINE mixture (see above) and seeded on filters. After 6-8 h, the medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. 48 h after seeding on filters, monolayers were tested for tightness using [3H]inulin and conditioned medium was assayed by ELISA after an additional 24 h. Control experiments indicated that monolayers were polarized by this time as judged by immunostaining using monoclonal antibodies to GP135 (gift of Dr. G. Ojakian, SUNY, Brooklyn), an apical marker, and E-cadherin (DECMA monoclonal, purchased from Sigma), a basolateral marker. Immunoprecipitations and 12.5% or 15% SDS-PAGE were performed as described previously (36Heymach Jr., J.V. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12297-12304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Samples were incubated with rabbit NGF antisera (Sigma) overnight followed by a 2-h incubation with anti-rabbit IgG coupled to Sepharose (Sigma). Conditioned medium from metabolically labeled MDCK cells was analyzed in a similar manner. In order to examine the sorting of NGF, BDNF, and NT-3 into the regulated and constitutive secretory pathways, we expressed these neurotrophins in AtT-20 cells by stable and transient transfection. When the cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids for NGF, BDNF, or NT-3, stimulation with a known secretagogue, 8-Br-cAMP, led to a 3-6-fold increase in the amount of all three neurotrophins detected within the conditioned medium as compared to unstimulated controls (Fig. 1A). Note that mock-transfected cells did not secrete significant levels of NGF, BDNF, or NT-3, indicating that there is little endogenous production of neurotrophins by AtT-20 cells. Similar results were obtained when cell lines that stably expressed either NGF or NT-3 were analyzed (Fig. 1B) Four cell lines that expressed detectable levels of NGF, and three that expressed NT-3 were examined. In each case, stimulation with 8-Br-cAMP led to a 2.5-6-fold increase in the amount of neurotrophin released. There was a somewhat smaller increase in the release of neurotrophin after stimulation in NT-3 expressing lines as compared to those expressing NGF, suggesting that there may be differences in the efficiency with which NGF and NT-3 are sorted to the regulated pathway. This difference, however, was generally not observed in transiently transfected cells. To verify that the 8-Br-cAMP-induced neurotrophin secretion was due to an increase in release from intracellular stores, as opposed to an increase in neurotrophin synthesis, we treated the cells with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide or 10 mM actinomycin D for 1.5 h prior to stimulation with 8-Br-cAMP and continued the treatment throughout the entire period of stimulation. Treatment of AtT-20 cells with this concentration of cycloheximide has been shown to inhibit 97% of new protein synthesis within 30 min (41Brion C. Miller S.G. Moore H.-P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1477-1483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, 8-Br-cAMP induces a 4-fold increase in NGF secretion in the presence of cycloheximide. Similar results were obtained after treatment with actinomycin D, demonstrating that new mRNA or protein synthesis is not required for the secretagogue-induced NGF secretion. Interestingly, cycloheximide or actinomycin D treatment decreased NGF secretion by 8-Br-cAMP-stimulated cells but had little effect on unstimulated controls. This is consistent with the finding that cycloheximide treatment impaired regulated secretion to a greater extent than constitutive secretion in AtT-20 cells (41Brion C. Miller S.G. Moore H.-P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1477-1483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with 8-Br-cAMP also led to significant decrease in the amount of NGF detected within cell lysates (Fig. 2). Together, these results provide evidence that the neurotrophins are released via the regulated secretory pathway by AtT-20 cells. To determine if the neurotrophins were also released via the regulated secretory pathway in PC12 cells, cells were transiently transfected and analyzed as described for AtT-20 cells except that regulated secretion was stimulated by depolarization with 50 mM potassium chloride for 15 min. Similar conditions have previously been used to study the secretion of catecholamines, human growth hormone, and other molecules targeted to the regulated pathway in PC12 cells (42Schweitzer E.S. Paddock S. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 96: 375-381PubMed Google Scholar, 43Wick P.F. Senter R.A. Parsels L.A. Uhler M.D. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10983-10989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 3, depolarization with 50 mM KCl led to a 2.5-4-fold increase in the amount of NGF or NT-3 detected within the conditioned medium. This depolarization-induced release of NGF or NT-3 was not inhibited by cycloheximide or actinomycin D at concentrations that inhibit new protein or mRNA synthesis (44Twiss J.L. Shooter E.M. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), indicating that this release was not due to new protein synthesis and supporting the conclusion that neurotrophin was being released from preexisting intracellular stores. To investigate the mechanism of neurotrophin sorting and how it might be regulated, we used site- directed mutagenesis to examine regions or motifs within the NGF precursor that might be expected to influence the regulated secretion of NGF. Our analysis focused on the NGF propeptide for several reasons. First, this region contains potential sites for proteolytic processing and N-glycosylation, post-translational modifications that have been shown to play a role in the targeting of other proteins to specific secretory pathways (30Scheiffele P. Peranen J. Simons K. Nature. 1995; 378: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 32Journet A.M. Saffaripour S. Cramer E.M. Tenza D. Wagner D.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 60: 31-41PubMed Google Scholar). Second, propeptides have themselves been demonstrated to carry critical sorting information (45Fortenberry S.C. Chirgwin J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9778-9782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 46Cuozzo J.W. Tao K. Wu Q.L. Young W. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15611-15619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Finally, based on our earlier studies, it was observed that mature, biologically active NGF could be produced even after deletion of more than 75% of the propeptide; by contrast, we find that relatively small deletions within the mature NGF moiety can drastically destabilize the protein. 2A. Krüttgen, J. V. Heymach, Jr., P. Kahle, and E. M. Shooter, unpublished observations. Three groups of proNGF mutants were analyzed (Fig. 4). In the first group, the propeptide was divided into five regions and each of these deleted individually. Expression of these mutants in COS cells has already been described (18Suter U. Heymach Jr., J. Shooter E.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2395-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In the second group, three potential processing sites were altered. In the third group, two potential N-glycosylation sites were mutated either alone or in combination. A mutant lacking residues in the amino terminus of mature NGF (NGFΔ3-8) (47Drinkwater C.C. Barker P.A. Suter U. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23202-23207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was also analyzed. When the propeptide deletion mutants were expressed in AtT-20 cells NGF was consistently detected in the conditioned medium of cells transfected with the Δ1, Δ2, Δ4, Δ5, and NGF(Δ3-8) mutants (although the relative expression levels of these mutants varied) but never after transfection with the Δ3 mutant. When regulated secretion was assessed as described above, stimulation with 8-Br-cAMP led to at least a 3-fold increase in NGF secretion for all of the detectable mutants (Fig. 6A). The lower levels of NGF secretion for some mutants was not due to their selective retention within the cell, as NGF levels were lower within the cell lysates of these mutants as well (Fig. 6A). These data suggest that information required for regulated secretion is not contained within regions 1, 2, 4, or 5 of the NGF propeptide or within the amino terminus of mature NGF. Similar results were obtained for a mutant lacking the three carboxyl-terminal residues of mature NGF (data not shown). The lack of expression of the Δ3 mutant is consistent with our earlier demonstration that only region 3 of the propeptide was strictly required for NGF production in COS cells. When this region was deleted, NGF precursor appeared to be rapidly degraded within the endoplasmic reticulum (18Suter U. Heymach Jr., J. Shooter E.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2395-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), 3J. V. Heymach, Jr., A, Krüttgen, U. Suter, and E. M. Shooter, unpublished observations. suggesting that it is involved in the proper folding or dimerization of the nascent NGF precursor. The NGF propeptide contains one tetrabasic and two dibasic sites, each of which appears to be cleaved in vitro (48Jongstra-Bilen J. Coblentz L. Shooter E.M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1989; 5: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furin, and possibly other prohormone convertases, cleave at the third of these sites to liberate mature NGF (49Bresnahan"

INTRODUCTIONThe first step in all vesicular trafficking pathways is the recruitment of coat proteins from the cytosol onto a donor membrane compartment, where they drive the formation of a transport vesicle which can then fuse with an acceptor membrane compartment. A number of different types of coats have now been identified, each of which must be recruited onto a specific membrane. For instance, the AP-1 adaptor complex is recruited onto the TGN, 1The abbreviations used are: TGNtrans-Golgi networkCOPcoat proteinERendoplasmic reticulumMPRmannose 6-phosphate receptorDTSSP3,3ʹ-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylproprionate)ARFADP-ribosylation factorTES2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid. while the AP-2 adaptor complex is recruited onto the plasma membrane. In both cases soluble clathrin then binds to the membrane-associated adaptors, and the two components co-assemble into a coat (1Pearse B.M.F. Robinson M.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 151-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). The coatomer complex, which facilitates the formation of COPI-coated vesicles, is recruited onto the Golgi stack, the intermediate compartment, and (at least in vitro) the ER and endosomes (2Osterman J. Orci L. Tani K. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Elazar Z. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 1015-1025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 3Bednarek S.Y. Ravazzola M. Hosobuchi M. Amherdt M.

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The Sec23p-Sec24p complex and the Sec13p-Sec31p complex are recruited onto the ER, where they facilitate the formation of COPII-coated vesicles (6Barlowe C. Orci L. Yeung T. Hosobuchi M. Hamamoto S. Salama N. Rexach M.F. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Schekman R. Cell. 1994; 77: 895-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). Recently an adaptor-related protein complex has been identified which, like AP-1, is associated with the TGN, but which appears to become incorporated into a novel type of non-clathrin-coated vesicle (7Simpson F. Bright N.A. West M.A. Newman L.S. Darnell R.B. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar).The recruitment of each of these coats onto the appropriate membrane is essential for the formation of transport vesicles bearing the right sort of cargo. For instance, clathrin-coated vesicles budding from the TGN selectively include cation-independent and cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs), which bind newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes on the lumenal side of the membrane. In this way the enzymes are packaged into a unique type of vesicle, which can then deliver its contents to a prelysosomal compartment. There is evidence that the AP-1 adaptor complex can interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the cation-independent MPR, and that this interaction causes the receptor and its bound ligand to be sequestered into the budding coated vesicle (8Glickman J.N. Conibear E. Pearse B.M.F. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 9Le Borgne R. Schmidt A. Mauxion F. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22552-22556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, membrane proteins like the low density lipoprotein receptor have been shown to bind to the AP-2 adaptor complex, which would provide a molecular basis for the selective inclusion of such proteins into the coated vesicles that bud from the plasma membrane (10Pearse B.M.F. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). It seems unlikely, however, that these interactions are sufficient to account for the precision with which each type of coat is recruited onto its target membrane. The two MPRs, for instance, are mainly found in late endosomes in many cells (11Klumperman J. Hille A. Veenendaal T. Oorschot V. Stoorvogel W. von Figura K. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 997-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), yet the AP-1 complex is recruited onto the TGN and, to a lesser extent, onto an early endosomal compartment which may be functionally related to the TGN (12Le Borgne R. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2162-2170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of adaptors to associate with a particular membrane cannot depend simply on binding to membrane proteins like the MPR and the low density lipoprotein receptor, and there must be additional components of the recruitment machinery.One such component, required for AP-1 binding, is the small GTPase ARF1. When cells are treated with the drug brefeldin A, which prevents the nucleotide exchange of ARF proteins and causes them to become cytosolic rather than membrane-associated, AP-1 adaptors also rapidly redistribute to the cytoplasm (13Robinson M.S. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 129-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 14Wong D. Brodsky F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Recruitment of cytosolic AP-1 adaptors onto the TGN in vitro is enhanced by the addition of GTPγS, which activates ARFs and drives them onto the membrane. When ARF is depleted from the cytosol by gel filtration, the adaptors are no longer capable of binding to the TGN membrane, but addition of recombinant myristylated ARF1 restores this ability (15Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 999-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 16Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). However, ARF1 alone also cannot account for the specificity of recruitment of AP-1 adaptors, since it is associated with other membranes in addition to the TGN, including the Golgi stack and intermediate compartment where it is required for coatomer recruitment. Two models have been proposed to explain the role of ARF1 in AP-1 recruitment. The first model predicts that ARF1 and the MPR together constitute an adaptor binding site on the TGN (12Le Borgne R. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2162-2170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The second model postulates that there is a specific AP-1 docking protein which resides in the TGN, which is distinct from the MPR and which is activated by ARF1 (16Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Once on the membrane, the adaptors would then be able to bind to the MPR, but the docking protein would be responsible for their initial recruitment. However, this docking protein has yet to be identified.Thus, it is clear that adaptor recruitment is a relatively complicated event involving several protein-protein interactions. This idea is supported by our recent studies on chimeric adaptor subunits, which reveal that adaptor complexes contain two or more targeting signals, each of which may interact with a different component of the recruitment machinery (17Page L.J. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have begun to dissect the various components of the machinery required for AP-1 recruitment. First, we have investigated the soluble protein requirements to find out whether AP-1 adaptors and ARF1 alone are sufficient for recruitment or whether additional cytosolic factors are needed. Second, we have used a cross-linking approach to identify membrane-associated proteins that interact with each of the AP-1 subunits as a means of finding candidate docking proteins.DISCUSSIONA number of studies have shown that coat protein recruitment is regulated by small GTP-binding proteins. Thus, Sar1p is required for COPII binding (6Barlowe C. Orci L. Yeung T. Hosobuchi M. Hamamoto S. Salama N. Rexach M.F. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Schekman R. Cell. 1994; 77: 895-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar) and ARF1 for COPI and AP-1 adaptor binding (15Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 999-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 16Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), while the relevant GTP-binding proteins that might facilitate the binding of AP-2 adaptors and the adaptor-related complex to membranes have not yet been identified, but are likely to be ARFs because (at least in vitro) both events are sensitive not only to GTPγS but also to brefeldin A (7Simpson F. Bright N.A. West M.A. Newman L.S. Darnell R.B. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 21Seaman M.N.J. Ball C.L. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1093-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the case of COPI and COPII coats, the coat proteins themselves and the small GTP-binding proteins are the only soluble components that are required for recruitment, and here we show that the same is true for AP-1 adaptors. However, this does not rule out the possibility that there might be peripheral membrane proteins derived from the cytosol that play a role in recruitment, as suggested in a recent study on the binding of AP-1 adaptors to immature secretory granules (25Dittie A.S. Hajibagheri N. Tooze S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; : 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The role of such proteins in coat protein recruitment is highlighted by the finding that Sec16p, a peripheral membrane protein associated with the ER, is essential for COPII recruitment, even though it does not need to be added in soluble form (26Espenshade P. Gimeno R.E. Holzmacher E. Teung P. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 311-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).As a first step toward identifying membrane proteins involved in adaptor recruitment, both peripheral and integral, we have made use of the cross-linker DTSSP, followed by denaturation and immunoprecipitation, to bring down proteins associated with membrane-bound AP-1 adaptors. Under the conditions we have used, the adaptor subunits also become cross-linked to each other and to clathrin. It is clear, however, that the cross-linking is incomplete, since although the four subunits of the adaptor complex are known to be stoichiometric with each other, the major band brought down by each antibody was its own antigen. The relative amounts of the other subunits that co-precipitated in the presence of cross-linker provide some clues as to which subunits are likely to be in direct contact with each other. For instance, the AP47 antibody brought down considerably more βʹ-adaptin than γ-adaptin, suggesting that AP47 may be directly associated with βʹ-adaptin and only indirectly associated with γ-adaptin. This possibility is supported by our studies on adaptor subunit interactions using the yeast two-hybrid system, in which βʹ-adaptin was found to interact with γ-adaptin and AP47 but not AP19, and γ-adaptin with βʹ-adaptin and AP19 but not AP47 (17Page L.J. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).In addition to adaptor subunits and clathrin, unknown bands also co-precipitated with the various antibodies. Most striking of these was p75, which appeared as a strong band in immunoprecipitates using antibodies against two different γ-adaptin epitopes and as a weaker band in the immunoprecipitates using antibodies against the other subunits. These observations suggest that p75 interacts specifically with γ-adaptin. Experiments making use of radiolabeled cytosol revealed that p75 only co-precipitates with membrane-bound γ-adaptin and that it is not co-recruited onto the membrane with the AP-1 adaptor complex. Thus, p75 is a strong candidate for a component of the adaptor docking site on the TGN membrane.Two additional proteins were found to co-precipitate with other adaptor subunits in the presence of cross-linker, p60 with AP47 and p80 with βʹ-adaptin; these may be additional components of the adaptor docking site. Studies making use of chimeric α- and γ-adaptins have revealed that the adaptors must contain at least two targeting signals, which presumably act by binding to docking sites on the membrane. One of these targeting signals is in the C-terminal “ear” domains of α and γ, and the other is in in the adaptor “head,” which contains the N-terminal domains of the α/γ and β subunits as well as the medium and small chains (17Page L.J. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 27Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). There is a strong correlation between the presence of a particular medium and small chain and targeting of the complex to a particular membrane, indicating that one or both of these subunits may contain targeting information. Thus, p60 may also play a role in the specificity of adaptor recruitment. In contrast, no correlation was found between the β subunits and targeting; however, p80 could still be involved in adaptor docking as a general component of the recruitment machinery, acting both at the TGN and at the plasma membrane. Interestingly, Mallet and Brodsky have also identified an ∼80-kDa protein that associates with AP-1 adaptors using a different approach. 2W. Mallet and F. Brodsky, personal communication.Attempts to further characterize p75, p60, and p80 have so far proved unsuccessful. There are no strong bands at these positions on gels of purified clathrin-coated vesicles, indicating that the proteins bind adaptor subunits only transiently. Although the bands appear heavily labeled in our immunoprecipitates, the intensity of the signal relative to that of the adaptor subunits is somewhat misleading, since most of the adaptors in the immunoprecipitate are likely to be derived from the unlabeled cytosol. Thus, even in highly scaled-up preparations, we have been unable to obtain sufficient quantities of these proteins for sequence analysis. We are at present making use of alternative methods for identifying proteins that interact with adaptor subunits, in particular the yeast two-hybrid system. Antibodies will then be raised against such proteins to determine whether they can be cross-linked to newly recruited adaptor subunits, and whether they correspond to any of the proteins identified in the present study.Adaptors and other coat proteins are recruited onto their target membranes with extremely high precision, and it is possible that the only way to achieve such accuracy is by multiple interactions involving different membrane proteins and different coat subunits. Some of these interactions may also be important in the regulation of membrane traffic pathways, controlling the extent of coat protein recruitment and thus of vesicle formation. Thus, the AP-1 adaptor docking site may consist of not one protein but several, ARF1 (possibly acting indirectly by stimulating phospholipase D) (28Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 29Cockcroft S. Thomas G.M.H. Fensome A. Geny B. Cunningham E. Gout I. Hiles I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Science. 1994; 263: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), MPRs, and other as yet uncharacterized proteins including p75, p60, and p80. Each of these individual proteins might be present on more than one membrane, but only the TGN membrane would have all of them in sufficiently high concentrations to ensure that the AP-1 adaptor complex is always targeted to the correct location. INTRODUCTIONThe first step in all vesicular trafficking pathways is the recruitment of coat proteins from the cytosol onto a donor membrane compartment, where they drive the formation of a transport vesicle which can then fuse with an acceptor membrane compartment. A number of different types of coats have now been identified, each of which must be recruited onto a specific membrane. For instance, the AP-1 adaptor complex is recruited onto the TGN, 1The abbreviations used are: TGNtrans-Golgi networkCOPcoat proteinERendoplasmic reticulumMPRmannose 6-phosphate receptorDTSSP3,3ʹ-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylproprionate)ARFADP-ribosylation factorTES2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid. while the AP-2 adaptor complex is recruited onto the plasma membrane. In both cases soluble clathrin then binds to the membrane-associated adaptors, and the two components co-assemble into a coat (1Pearse B.M.F. Robinson M.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 151-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). The coatomer complex, which facilitates the formation of COPI-coated vesicles, is recruited onto the Golgi stack, the intermediate compartment, and (at least in vitro) the ER and endosomes (2Osterman J. Orci L. Tani K. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Elazar Z. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 1015-1025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 3Bednarek S.Y. Ravazzola M. Hosobuchi M. Amherdt M.

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The Sec23p-Sec24p complex and the Sec13p-Sec31p complex are recruited onto the ER, where they facilitate the formation of COPII-coated vesicles (6Barlowe C. Orci L. Yeung T. Hosobuchi M. Hamamoto S. Salama N. Rexach M.F. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Schekman R. Cell. 1994; 77: 895-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). Recently an adaptor-related protein complex has been identified which, like AP-1, is associated with the TGN, but which appears to become incorporated into a novel type of non-clathrin-coated vesicle (7Simpson F. Bright N.A. West M.A. Newman L.S. Darnell R.B. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar).The recruitment of each of these coats onto the appropriate membrane is essential for the formation of transport vesicles bearing the right sort of cargo. For instance, clathrin-coated vesicles budding from the TGN selectively include cation-independent and cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs), which bind newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes on the lumenal side of the membrane. In this way the enzymes are packaged into a unique type of vesicle, which can then deliver its contents to a prelysosomal compartment. There is evidence that the AP-1 adaptor complex can interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the cation-independent MPR, and that this interaction causes the receptor and its bound ligand to be sequestered into the budding coated vesicle (8Glickman J.N. Conibear E. Pearse B.M.F. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 9Le Borgne R. Schmidt A. Mauxion F. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22552-22556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, membrane proteins like the low density lipoprotein receptor have been shown to bind to the AP-2 adaptor complex, which would provide a molecular basis for the selective inclusion of such proteins into the coated vesicles that bud from the plasma membrane (10Pearse B.M.F. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). It seems unlikely, however, that these interactions are sufficient to account for the precision with which each type of coat is recruited onto its target membrane. The two MPRs, for instance, are mainly found in late endosomes in many cells (11Klumperman J. Hille A. Veenendaal T. Oorschot V. Stoorvogel W. von Figura K. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 997-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), yet the AP-1 complex is recruited onto the TGN and, to a lesser extent, onto an early endosomal compartment which may be functionally related to the TGN (12Le Borgne R. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2162-2170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of adaptors to associate with a particular membrane cannot depend simply on binding to membrane proteins like the MPR and the low density lipoprotein receptor, and there must be additional components of the recruitment machinery.One such component, required for AP-1 binding, is the small GTPase ARF1. When cells are treated with the drug brefeldin A, which prevents the nucleotide exchange of ARF proteins and causes them to become cytosolic rather than membrane-associated, AP-1 adaptors also rapidly redistribute to the cytoplasm (13Robinson M.S. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 129-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 14Wong D. Brodsky F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Recruitment of cytosolic AP-1 adaptors onto the TGN in vitro is enhanced by the addition of GTPγS, which activates ARFs and drives them onto the membrane. When ARF is depleted from the cytosol by gel filtration, the adaptors are no longer capable of binding to the TGN membrane, but addition of recombinant myristylated ARF1 restores this ability (15Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 999-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 16Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). However, ARF1 alone also cannot account for the specificity of recruitment of AP-1 adaptors, since it is associated with other membranes in addition to the TGN, including the Golgi stack and intermediate compartment where it is required for coatomer recruitment. Two models have been proposed to explain the role of ARF1 in AP-1 recruitment. The first model predicts that ARF1 and the MPR together constitute an adaptor binding site on the TGN (12Le Borgne R. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2162-2170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The second model postulates that there is a specific AP-1 docking protein which resides in the TGN, which is distinct from the MPR and which is activated by ARF1 (16Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Once on the membrane, the adaptors would then be able to bind to the MPR, but the docking protein would be responsible for their initial recruitment. However, this docking protein has yet to be identified.Thus, it is clear that adaptor recruitment is a relatively complicated event involving several protein-protein interactions. This idea is supported by our recent studies on chimeric adaptor subunits, which reveal that adaptor complexes contain two or more targeting signals, each of which may interact with a different component of the recruitment machinery (17Page L.J. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have begun to dissect the various components of the machinery required for AP-1 recruitment.

Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in catecholamine biosynthesis (32Nagatsu T. Levitt M. Udenfriend S. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2910-2917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In adult mammals, TH expression is confined to a small number of neuronal groups in the central nervous system and to the neurons of the sympathetic nervous system and neuroendocrine chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla in the periphery. Levels and activity of the enzyme are finely and differentially regulated in these cells by a large variety of pharmacological and physiological stimuli (33Mueller R.A. Thoenen H. Axelrod J. J.

Modulation of TH activity occurs at the protein level via phosphorylation of the enzyme catalyzed by PKA and possibly other kinases (40Zigmond R.E. Schwarzschild M.A. Rittenhouse A.R. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1989; 12: 415-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), and at the gene expression level via transcriptional changes (14Lewis E.J. Harrington C.A. Chikaraishi D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

In vitro experiments with reporter gene constructs show that very proximal cis-acting elements play important roles in functional regulation of TH gene transcription (1Kim K.-S. Lee M.K. Carroll J.

Although conflicting data exist, probably related to cell line differences, the CRE, located from 38 to 45 bp upstream of the initiation site, appears to be crucial for both basal and cAMP-induced transcription of the TH gene (1Kim K.-S. Lee M.K. Carroll J. Joh T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15689-15695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lazaroff M. Patankar S. Yoon S.O. Chikaraishi D.M. J. Biol.

To identify members of the CREB/CREM/ATF family that regulate TH transcription, gel mobility shift assays were performed using an oligonucleotide representing the TH CRE (identical in sequence to bp -52 through -32 of the rat TH promoter). Nuclear proteins were obtained from TH-expressing cell lines and rat tissues under control conditions and in response to pharmacological manipulations that increase TH mRNA. We found that ICER is strongly induced in the adrenal gland by reserpine and in PC12 cells by forskolin. Cotransfection experiments confirmed that ICER is indeed capable of modulating TH promoter activity in PC12 cells. These results suggest that, in addition to its previously recognized stimulatory effects on TH transcription, the cAMP signaling cascade can also repress TH expression via an ICER-mediated mechanism. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Cornell University Medical College. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-300 g), housed 2-3/cage with free access to food and water, under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle, received subcutaneous injections of reserpine, 10 mg/kg in 20% ascorbic acid, or an equivalent volume of the vehicle, 2-3 h after lights-on. Four hours later, they were decapitated, and the adrenal glands and brains rapidly dissected, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -80°C until extraction of nuclear proteins or RNA. PC12 cells and CATH.a cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium, pH 7.2, supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 25 mg/ml streptomycin. SK-N-BE(2Lazaroff M.

Cells were harvested from 30 min to 8 h after treatment with forskolin (10 μM) and isobutyl methylxanthine (0.5 mM), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored as above. Micropurification of nuclear proteins from either animal tissues or cell line cultures was performed according to Roy et al. (50Roy R.J. Gosselin P. Guerin S.L. Biotechniques. 1991; 11: 770-777PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 4 ml of NE1 (250 mM sucrose, 15 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 140 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.15 mM spermine, 0.5 mM spermidine, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.4 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 mM KCl, and 2 mM MgCl2) were added to tissues (0.2-1.5 mg) or cells (5-10 x 108). Tissues were first homogenized in a Dounce tissue grinder and filtered through cheesecloth. To free nuclei, tissue was further homogenized with added Nonidet P-40® (0.5%), washed twice, and pelleted at 3000 x g. One “packed cell volume” of NE2 (NE1 buffer containing 350 mM KCl) was used to resuspend nuclei and, after a 5-min incubation on ice, 20 strokes in the Dounce tissue grinder were performed. The homogenate was centrifuged for 90 min at 4°C (180,000 x g), and the supernatant was dialyzed for 45 min against 50 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 20 mM K3PO4 (pH 7.4), 1 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, and 20% glycerol. Extract protein concentrations were determined with a colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad). In a 20-μl volume, nuclear proteins (4-15 μg) were incubated at room temperature for 20 min in binding buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol) in the presence of poly(dI-dC) (1 μg) with specific double-strand oligonucleotides end labeled with 32P. The samples were loaded on a 6% acrylamide gel and run at 100 V in a low ionic strength buffer (0.25 x TBE) for 2 h. The gels were dried and autoradiographed at room temperature.

CREB, CREM, p-CREB, ATF1, and ATF2 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Separation of nuclear proteins (50-150 μg) was carried out by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8.5%) for 1 h at 20 watts in Tris-glycine buffer (25 mM Tris, 250 mM glycine, and 0.1% SDS) at 22°C. The proteins were electrotransferred on a supported nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 μm) as described previously (51Kim K.-S. Febbraio M. Han T.-H. Wessel T.C. Park D.H. Joh T.H. Hames B.D. Higgins S.J. Gene Probes 2. IRL Press, New York1995: 151Google Scholar). The membranes were soaked in phosphate-buffered saline solution and 5% nonfat dry milk for 2 h with gentle agitation. For immunological detection, the membrane was incubated with the primary antibodies, CREB (diluted 1:10,000) and anti-mouse CREM (diluted 1:1,000), for 2 h followed by three washes (10 min each in 5% nonfat dry milk, 0.02% Tween 20®, phosphate-buffered saline) under gentle agitation. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) were used as secondary antibodies at a 1:2000 dilution (2 h incubation followed by three wash steps). The mRNA was extracted from either animal tissues or cells with the Poly(A)Ttract® System1000 (Promega, Madison, WI). mRNA (1-5 μg) were electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane (Amersham), and hybridized with specific probes labeled by random priming with [α-32P]dCTP. Blots were exposed to Kodak XAR film for 2 days (51Kim K.-S. Febbraio M. Han T.-H. Wessel T.C. Park D.H. Joh T.H. Hames B.D. Higgins S.J. Gene Probes 2. IRL Press, New York1995: 151Google Scholar). mRNA was reverse-transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase in the presence of oligo(dT) and [α-32P]dCTP as radioactive tracer. The cDNA obtained was amplified with specific oligonucleotides designed to prime some of the different CREM isoforms. Some of the fragments amplified by PCR reaction were purified from agarose gels, labeled, and used as probes in the Northern blot analysis. BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites were introduced in the 5ʹ and 3ʹ primers, respectively, to facilitate the following subcloning. The conditions used for amplification are the same as described by Hoeffler et al. (52Hoeffler J.P. Meyer T.E. Waeber G. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 920-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).

Transfections performed into PC12 cells with the reporter TH2400CAT and the expression PKAc plasmids and the following CAT assay have been already described (1Kim K.-S. Lee M.K. Carroll J. Joh T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15689-15695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression vector CMV-ICER-Ib was obtained by subcloning the PCR-amplified ICER-Ib cDNA in BamHI and EcoRI sites of the polylinker region of the pcDNAI/AMP plasmid (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). As an initial step in defining the role of CRE-binding proteins in TH gene regulation, gel retardation analysis was performed on TH-expressing cell lines and tissues obtained from both peripheral and central nervous system of rats. Gel mobility shift assays, using an oligonucleotide representing the consensus CRE located at -38 to -45 in the rat TH promoter plus some additional flanking sequence, produced distinct retardation patterns that varied among the different extracts (Fig. 1). Nuclear extracts from the adrenal gland and PC12 cells exhibited almost identical binding patterns, which differed from those observed in the extracts from central nervous system or other catecholamine-producing cell lines. Extracts of human neuroblastoma-derived SK-N-BE(2Lazaroff M. Patankar S. Yoon S.O. Chikaraishi D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21579-21589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar)C cells (53Ross R.A. Biedler J.L. Spengler B.A. Reis D.J. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1981; 1: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and rat locus ceruleus-derived CATH.a cells (54Suri C. Fung B.P. Tischler A.S. Chikaraishi D.M. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1280-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed unique binding patterns. Previous studies demonstrated an increase in rat adrenal TH mRNA within 4 h of administration of reserpine (55Icard-Liepkalns C. Faucon Biguet N. Vyas S. Robert J.J. Sassone-Corsi P. Mallet J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 32: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and within 4 h of forskolin treatment of PC12 cells (56Lewis E.J. Tank A.W. Weiner N. Chikaraishi D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14632-14637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined gel retardation patterns at 4 h. Nuclear extracts from both forskolin-treated PC12 cells and adrenal glands from reserpine-treated rats displayed dramatic increases in a fast moving protein-DNA complex (Fig. 1). In contrast, neither treatment substantially altered binding patterns in the CATH.a or locus ceruleus extracts (Fig. 1). To examine the binding specificity of PC12 and adrenal gland extracts, the gel retardation assays were performed in the presence of molar excess of either TH-CRE or TH-AP1 unlabeled nucleotides (Fig. 2, A and B). In extracts from both sources, excess unlabeled CRE prevented the formation of protein-DNA complexes (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, even 100-fold molar excesses of the AP-1 oligonucleotide did not efficiently interfere with the binding between the CRE probe and nuclear proteins derived from either PC12 cells (Fig. 2A) or the adrenal gland (data not shown). Using antibodies against different members of the CREB/CREM/ATF family, supershift assays were performed to make an initial identification of the proteins in the forskolin-induced fast running complex from PC12 cells. The anti-CREM antibody, even at the lowest concentration, supershifted the band in both control (Fig. 3B) and forskolin-treated (Fig. 3, A and B) PC12 preparations. Anti-CREM antibody also supershifted the fast running complex from adrenal gland (Fig. 3B). Western blot analysis further characterized the antigen recognized by the CREM antibody. As shown in Fig. 4A, six distinct bands, representing antigens with molecular masses ranging from 12 to 43 kDa, interacted with the CREM antibody in extracts from both PC12 cells and adrenal gland. Two small proteins of similar molecular mass, 12 and 13 kDa, are strongly induced by forskolin and reserpine (Fig. 4A). The identification of these proteins as ICER is indicated by the fact that no other CRE-binding polypeptides of the appropriate lengths have been reported and is further supported by the Northern and PCR analysis presented below. As the CREM antiserum used cross-reacts with other members of the CREB/CREM/ATF family, it is not possible to state that all the detected polypeptides derive from the CREM gene. CREB antiserum also produced a supershift in the protein-DNA binding pattern but did not affect the fast running complex (Fig. 3A). This finding confirms the already reported (1Kim K.-S. Lee M.K. Carroll J. Joh T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15689-15695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lazaroff M. Patankar S. Yoon S.O. Chikaraishi D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21579-21589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) interaction between CREB and the TH-CRE and rules out the possibility that the protein(s) bound to DNA in the fast running complex are CREB-related. The CREB antibody in Western blot analysis (Fig. 4B) reacted with at least one protein whose molecular mass (43 kDa) matched that previously reported for CREB (21Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar). Note also the increase in the amount of CREB protein following forskolin treatment (Fig. 4B). The inability of phospho-CREB to produce a supershift probably results from phosphatase activity during the nuclear protein extraction, since a supershift occurred with the CREB antibody. Additionally, CREB may already be dephosphorylated at the time analyzed, i.e. 4 h after application of the stimulus. While the ATF-2 antiserum did not affect any protein-DNA binding complex, the anti-ATF-1 antibody supershifted one of the slower moving complexes. This finding was not analyzed further in the present study. Previous reports identified a small protein, ICER, that is generated by alternative intronic promoter usage from the CREM gene and expressed in PC12 cells and adrenal gland (29Stehle J.H. Fulkes N.S. Molina C.A. Simonneaux V. Pevet P. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1993; 365: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 31Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S. Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1993; 1993: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Fig. 5A shows the intron-exon structure of the CREM gene (31Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S. Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1993; 1993: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Four possible transcripts can be generated. All ICER transcripts contain 82 intronically derived bases not found in other CREM mRNAs. The four ICER transcripts are generated by either inclusion or exclusion of exon γ and alternative splicing of the DNA binding domains Ia and Ib (31Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S. Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1993; 1993: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (526) Google Scholar). To confirm the presence of the ICER isoforms, we designed specific primers (Fig. 5A) that amplify from the unique 82-base site (B5ʹ) to either the Ia site (Ia3ʹ) or the Ib site (Ib3ʹ). mRNA isolated from forskolin-treated PC12 cells and vehicle- and reserpine-treated adrenal glands were reverse transcribed and subjected to PCR. Two bands, approximately 300 bp long, were amplified from the B5ʹ and Ib3ʹ primers, corresponding to ICER-Ib and ICER-γ-Ib (Fig. 5C). No bands were amplified with the Ia3ʹ primer, regardless of which 5ʹ primer was used (Fig. 5B). Northern blot analysis confirmed that the pharmacological treatments altered express"

INTRODUCTIONThe majority of eukaryotic secretory proteins are co-translationally translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumPC2prohormone convertase 2POMCproopiomelanocortinTGNtrans-Golgi networkvWFvon Willebrand factorPBSphosphate-buffered salineCPHcarboxypeptidase H (or E)aaamino acid(s)PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisBSAbovine serum albumin. and, upon reaching the TGN, are either targeted to dense-core secretory granules for storage or released constitutively by a default mechanism (Moore and Kelly, 25Moore H.-P. Kelly R.B. Nature. 1986; 321: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Active sorting to the granule is postulated to occur either by a receptor-mediated process (Chung et al., 5Chung K.-N. Walter P. Aponte G.W. Moore H.-P. Science. 1989; 243: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) or be a consequence of aggregation promoted by the lowering of pH and elevation of Ca2+ in the TGN (Kelly, 17Kelly R.B. Science. 1985; 230: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar; Chanat and Huttner, 4Chanat E. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1505-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar).One approach to the identification of sorting sequences or domains in secreted proteins has been to study the effects of deletion or mutation of candidate sequences within granule proteins and investigation of whether transfer of such sequences to constitutively secreted proteins reroutes them to the granules (Moore and Kelly, 25Moore H.-P. Kelly R.B. Nature. 1986; 321: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A major limitation of this approach, particularly the case for gene transfer experiments performed with chimeras of heterologous proteins, is that any perturbation of the three-dimensional structure of the protein is likely to mask the activity of a putative sorting motif. To minimize these effects, we have chosen to perform experiments with the family of mammalian subtilisin-like proprotein processing enzymes (reviewed by Hutton, 16Hutton J.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 1131-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar; Steiner et al., 43Steiner D.F. Smeekens S.P. Ohagi S. Chan S.J. J. Biol.

The seven family members currently documented all exhibit a common domain structure characterized by a short unique amino-terminal signal peptide, a moderately conserved pro-domain usually of 70-90 aa terminating in an endoproteolytic cleavage site comprised of a cluster of basic residues, a highly conserved subtilisin-like catalytic domain of 320-340 aa, and a well conserved “middle” domain of 110-130 aa followed by unique carboxyl-terminal domains varying from 50 to several hundred residues in length. The domain boundaries are readily recognizable on the basis of homology and are amenable to domain-swapping experiments.In this study, we have chosen prohormone convertase PC2 (Seidah et al., 34Seidah N.G.

The 232-aa carboxyl terminus of furin is comprised of a cysteine-rich region, a membrane-spanning segment, and a 58-aa cytoplasmic tail. Previous studies with furin have shown that the catalytic and middle domains are sufficient for catalytic activity (Hatsuzawa et al., 15Hatsuzawa K. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biochem.

The experiments indicated that a targeting motif is located in the carboxyl terminus of PC2, but efficient sorting may also depend upon an extended structure incorporating the middle domain of the protein.DISCUSSIONPrevious transfection studies using a range of different cell lines and vector systems have indicated that newly synthesized pro-furin is rapidly and completely cleaved into furin in the ER by an autocatalytic intramolecular process (Creemers et al., 7Creemers J.W.M. Siezen R.J. Roebroek A.J.M. Ayoubi T.A.Y. Huylebroeck D. Van de Ven W.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21826-21834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Creemers J.W.M. Vey M. Schäfer W.

N-Linked oligosaccharide chains are subsequently modified, and the protein takes up residence in the TGN where it is maintained by a combined retention/retrieval mechanism (Bosshart et al., 3Bosshart H.

In NRK cells, it may eventually be truncated in its carboxyl-terminal region and released into the medium (Vey et al., 51Vey M. Schäfer W. Berghöfer S. Klenk H.-D. Garten W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1829-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In RBL cells, it is reported to be degraded in a population of hybrid organelles with lysosomal characteristics (Bosshart et al., 3Bosshart H. Humphrey J. Deignan E. Davidson J. Drazba J. Yuan L. Oorschot V. Peters P.J. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1157-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In this study conducted in stable transformed AtT-20 cells, immunogold electron microscopy revealed that the steady state localization of furin was principally the TGN. The presence of gold particles on the periphery of a few secretory granules in AtT-20/furin cells, however, raised the question of whether or not the molecule is totally excluded from the granule membrane during granule biogenesis.The maturation of PC2 in the stable transfected AtT-20 cells was consistent with the reported proteolytic cleavage of pro-PC2 at both tetrabasic sites Lys-Arg-Arg-Arg81 or Arg-Lys-Lys-Arg109 to produce the mature secreted forms (Bailyes et al., 1Bailyes E.M. Shennan K.I.J. Usac E.F. Arden S.D. Guest P.C. Docherty K. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The intracellular localization of propeptide cleavage has not been determined unequivocally, although the present consensus favors a late compartment, probably the TGN or immature granule. In our stable transfected AtT-20 cells, the constitutive release of a substantial amount of mature PC2 but little pro-PC2 argues that processing occurs before sorting. The processed form of PC2 was shown to contain both endo H-sensitive and endo H-resistant carbohydrate side chains, whereas pro-PC2 was completely endo H-sensitive, as reported previously (Guest et al., 12Guest P.C. Arden S.D. Bennett D.L. Clark A. Rutherford N.G. Hutton J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22401-22406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Benjannet et al., 2Benjannet S. Rondeau N. Paquet L.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 3-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This superficially suggests that pro-PC2 does not reach the trans-Golgi. Against such a suggestion are previous reports that a component of pro-PC2 is tyrosine sulfated (Benjannet et al., 2Benjannet S. Rondeau N. Paquet L. Boudreault A. Lazure C. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), maturation is not observed at 20°C (Zhou and Mains, 52Zhou A. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17440-17447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and low pH and high calcium concentration is required for pro-PC2 cleavage in vitro (Shennan et al., 37Shennan K.I.J. Taylor N.A. Jermany J.L. Matthews G. Docherty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1402-1407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The major impediment to the exit of PC2 from the ER is probably its folding kinetics. Although the overall kinetics of intracellular pro-PC2 conversion may be slow (Guest et al., 1992; Zhu and Lindberg, 55Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), the rate of endoproteolysis of individual molecules after folding could be extremely rapid. Within this context, the N-glycosylation studies cannot easily discriminate between activation of endoproteolysis occurring in the ER or in a post-medial Golgi compartment. In the former case, the presence of completely endo H-sensitive forms of the mature protein is overshadowed by partially resistant mature forms of the protein. In the latter case, the presence of endo H-resistant forms of pro-PC2 would be obscured by the large ER pool of endo H-sensitive forms.PC2 was sorted into the granules in AtT-20/PC2 cells as evidenced by secretagogue responses and morphological investigations. The co-localization of PC2 with the granule marker protein POMC was also only partial; however, similar discrepancies have also been reported both in cell lines and normal tissue (Tooze et al., 46Tooze S.A. Hollinshead M. Dittié A.S. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar; Malide et al., 22Malide D. Seidah N.G. Chrétien M. Bendayan M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the latter study, immuno-electron microscopy showed that only 60% of the insulin-positive granules in pancreatic β cells contained PC2 and conversely that some insulin-negative dense core granules contained PC2. Similar heterogeneity of granule composition has been reported in other secretory proteins and tissues (Mroz and Lechene, 26Mroz E.A. Lechene C. Science. 1986; 232: 871-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar; Hashimoto et al., 14Hashimoto S. Fumagalli G. Zanini A. Meldolesi J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).The truncation of furin after the middle domain (Thr573) resulted in the production of an active, secreted enzyme that underwent post-translational modification with similar kinetics to the wild-type molecule. The smallest active form of furin described previously was truncated after Glu576 (Hatsuzawa et al., 15Hatsuzawa K. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 296-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), while the largest inactive mutant was truncated after Glu556 (Creemers et al., 7Creemers J.W.M. Siezen R.J. Roebroek A.J.M. Ayoubi T.A.Y. Huylebroeck D. Van de Ven W.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21826-21834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Truncation of yeast kexin at the position equivalent to furin Thr573 also generates an active enzyme (Gluschankof and Fuller, 10Gluschankof P. Fuller R.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2280-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), whereas the removal of one additional carboxyl-terminal amino acid blocks activation and results in ER retention. The implication that the carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues of the middle domain are critically important in folding, autoactivation, and/or intracellular transport has possible bearing on the failure to produce an active truncated form of PC2 (truncated at the position equivalent to F-S), which bores a single conservative amino acid substitution 5 aa from its carboxyl terminus (Met590→ Val). It may also be that additional residues within the carboxyl-terminal domain of PC2 are required for autonomous function of the middle domain of PC2. Further mutagenesis studies could resolve this issue.The addition of the last 50 aa of PC2 to the truncated form of furin did not markedly affect the rate of propeptide cleavage, intracellular transport, or the catalytic activity of the molecule. The other chimera F-N-P also matured normally, showing that the middle domains of furin and PC2 can be exchanged and are functionally equivalent with respect to effects on folding of the proprotein and its transport to the TGN. It is concluded from these results that the strategy of swapping mammalian subtilisin domains to explore the location and function of targeting motifs is informative. Since PC2 is more distantly related to furin than any other member of the mammalian subtilisin-like gene family, it follows that this strategy could be extended to middle domain exchanges with other members of the family. Similarly successful domain-swapping experiments were performed by Zhou et al. (1995) in a study of the role of the propeptides of furin, PC1, and PC2 in routing and endoproteolytic activity. Other studies of this kind (Rehemtulla et al., 30Rehemtulla A. Dorner A.J. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 32: 11586-11590Google Scholar), however, have generated inactive constructs.As shown previously (Bosshart et al., 3Bosshart H. Humphrey J. Deignan E. Davidson J. Drazba J. Yuan L. Oorschot V. Peters P.J. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1157-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar; Molloy et al., 24Molloy S.S. Thomas L. van Slyke J.K. Stenberg P.E. Thomas G.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2424-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), the deletion of the carboxyl-terminal domains in F-S resulted in its constitutive secretion. Intracellular furin immunoreactivity was only associated with the ER, presumably reflecting the transient retention of newly synthesized molecules prior to folding. Within the context of the behavior of the chimeric molecules, these observations suggest that the catalytic and middle domains of the furin do not possess sub-dominant motifs that could target the molecule to granules or other intracellular organelles. Studies of the localization of chimeric proteins, on the other hand, indicated a critical role for the last 50 aa of PC2 in the sorting to the secretory granule compartment. The carboxyl terminus of PC2 is predicted to contain an amphiphatic α-helical segment (Smeekens et al., 41Smeekens S.P. Avruch A.S. LaMendola J. Chan S.J. Steiner D.F. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), and similar structures have been implicated in membrane association and sorting of carboxypeptidase H (CPH) (Mitra et al., 23Mitra A. Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19876-19881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of the CPH tail to albumin results in rerouting of albumin from the constitutive to the regulated pathway in AtT-20 cells. As in our experiments, sorting of the albumin/CPH chimera was less efficient than sorting of CPH, suggesting that although sorting may largely depend on a specific domain, additional components of the protein structure may contribute. Carboxyl-terminal truncation of PC1 (which also has a putative amphiphatic α-helical segment (Smeekens et al., 41Smeekens S.P. Avruch A.S. LaMendola J. Chan S.J. Steiner D.F. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar)) results in the synthesis of a functional enzyme, the majority of which is not sorted into granules (Zhou et al., 53Zhou A. Paquet L. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21509-21516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 54Zhou Y. Rovere C. Kitabgi P. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24702-24706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, some activity of the truncated PC1 within the regulated pathway was detectable, suggesting that additional sorting domains may exist in PC1.On the basis of an alignment of amphiphatic α-helixes of 15 other proteins that are sorted to the granules, Kizer and Tropsha (18Kizer J.S. Tropsha A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 586-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) postulated a degenerate sorting motif consisting of several leucines and a serine or a threonine. None of the carboxyl termini of PC2, PC1, or CPH conform to this motif, and apart from the similar predicted secondary structure there is little common sequence homology in this region of these molecules. One feature, however, that they do possess is a cluster of charged aa immediately preceding the putative amphiphatic α-helical segment. Similar highly charged domains occur in members of the granin family, which are also sorted in the TGN in a wide range of neuroendocrine tissues (Chanat and Huttner, 4Chanat E. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1505-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). It may be that the general physicochemical properties of the carboxyl-terminal region of PC2 rather than its primary structure determines its sorting.In contrast to the present findings, other studies with regulated secretory proteins, particularly somatostatin and POMC, have implicated the pro-region in sorting into the regulated pathway (Stoller and Shields, 44Stoller T.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar; Cool et al., 6Cool D.R. Fenger M. Snell C.R. Loh Y.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8723-8729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). PC2 expressed in micro-injected Xenopus oocytes (Shennan et al., 36Shennan K.I.J. Taylor N.A. Docherty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18646-18650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) shows Ca2+- and pH-dependent aggregation and membrane association, which is dependent on the propeptide but independent of its carboxyl terminus. These results have been interpreted as evidence for a sorting signal in the pro-region; however, this appears unlikely in view of the finding that the pro-sequence of PC2 is cleaved prior to sorting and the fact that these specific sequences were absent in our chimeras. Such aggregation and membrane association of pro-PC2 may impact more on its behavior in the ER than in the TGN, particularly in view of the report by Mains et al. (21Mains R.E. Milgram S.L. Keutmann H.T. Eipper B.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 3-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that modification of the propeptide of PC2 influences its rate of exit from the ER.Our studies point to an important contribution of the middle domain of PC2 in promoting the efficiency of the sorting process. It is conceivable that this domain possesses an independent sorting signal or that the carboxyl-terminal domain sorting motif incorporates components of the structure of the middle domain or even overlaps with it. The middle domain might also provide a scaffold for the correct conformational expression of a sorting domain within the carboxyl-terminal region of the molecule. Examination of the sequence alignment of the middle domains of all the currently documented forms of furin, PC2, and PC1 molecules did not reveal significant differences between furin and the PCs or unique common sequences between PC1 and PC2, which could be responsible for enhancement of the efficiency of sorting of F-N-P as compared to F-S-P.How the sorting elements in the carboxyl terminus and middle domain of PC2 function in a cellular context is not clear from the present studies. Of the current models of receptor-mediated (Chung et al., 5Chung K.-N. Walter P. Aponte G.W. Moore H.-P. Science. 1989; 243: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), aggregation-based (Kelly, 17Kelly R.B. Science. 1985; 230: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar; Chanat and Huttner, 4Chanat E. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1505-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), and passive sorting (Kuliawat and Arvan, 19Kuliawat R. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), only passive sorting is not favored since it would predict that the F-S construct would behave similarly to F-S-P and F-N-P. If sorting of PC2 were to occur by self-association alone, it is difficult to envisage how the enzyme, which is only a small fraction of the granule cargo, would be uniformly distributed within and between secretory granules. Although a purely receptor-based mechanism presents a conceptual difficulty for the sorting of major secretory products, particularly with regard to the receptor-ligand stoichiometry, it could easily operate with minor products such as PC2. The “receptor” moreover need not be membrane associated and could in fact be the pro-form of the major secretory product itself. The prohormone POMC in AtT-20 cells is a substrate for PC2 and furin and is probably present at a concentration several orders of magnitude higher than the Km of the enzyme and the concentration of the enzyme. Efficiency of sorting might be expected to be related to the kinetic properties of the enzyme and in particular its substrate specificity. However, in the present instance, this would not account for why F-S-P and F-N-P but not F-S were sorted to the regulated pathway since these were correctly folded and active. Therefore, it is concluded that the carboxyl terminus of PC2 provides some specific signal, be it a ligand for a sequence-specific receptor or an element promoting self-association, which directs the molecule toward the regulated pathway of secretion. The physicochemical characteristics of the middle domain of PC2 might further enhance such processes by providing a structural context or might possess further elements that independently promote sorting. INTRODUCTIONThe majority of eukaryotic secretory proteins are co-translationally translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumPC2prohormone convertase 2POMCproopiomelanocortinTGNtrans-Golgi networkvWFvon Willebrand factorPBSphosphate-buffered salineCPHcarboxypeptidase H (or E)aaamino acid(s)PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisBSAbovine serum albumin. and, upon reaching the TGN, are either targeted to dense-core secretory granules for storage or released constitutively by a default mechanism (Moore and Kelly, 25Moore H.-P. Kelly R.B. Nature. 1986; 321: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Active sorting to the granule is postulated to occur either by a receptor-mediated process (Chung et al., 5Chung K.-N. Walter P. Aponte G.W. Moore H.-P. Science. 1989; 243: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) or be a consequence of aggregation promoted by the lowering of pH and elevation of Ca2+ in the TGN (Kelly, 17Kelly R.B. Science. 1985; 230: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar; Chanat and Huttner, 4Chanat E. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1505-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar).One approach to the identification of sorting sequences or domains in secreted proteins has been to study the effects of deletion or mutation of candidate sequences within granule proteins and investigation of whether transfer of such sequences to constitutively secreted proteins reroutes them to the granules (Moore and Kelly, 25Moore H.-P. Kelly R.B. Nature. 1986; 321: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A major limitation of this approach, particularly the case for gene transfer experiments performed with chimeras of heterologous proteins, is that any perturbation of the three-dimensional structure of the protein is likely to mask the activity of a putative sorting motif. To minimize these effects, we have chosen to perform experiments with the family of mammalian subtilisin-like proprotein processing enzymes (reviewed by Hutton, 16Hutton J.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 1131-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar; Steiner et al., 43Steiner D.F. Smeekens S.P. Ohagi S. Chan S.J. J. Biol.

Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), which includes proteins, like PC1 and PC2, that are sorted into secretory granules and TGN-resident proteins such as furin. The seven family members currently documented all exhibit a common domain structure characterized by a short unique amino-terminal signal peptide, a moderately conserved pro-domain usually of 70-90 aa terminating in an endoproteolytic cleavage site comprised of a cluster of basic residues, a highly conserved subtilisin-like catalytic domain of 320-340 aa, and a well conserved “middle” domain of 110-130 aa followed by unique carboxyl-terminal domains varying from 50 to several hundred residues in length. The domain boundaries are readily recognizable on the basis of homology and are amenable to domain-swapping experiments.In this study, we have chosen prohormone convertase PC2 (Seidah et al., 34Seidah N.G.

The 232-aa carboxyl terminus of furin is comprised of a cysteine-rich region, a membrane-spanning segment, and a 58-aa cytoplasmic tail.

INTRODUCTIONGrowth inhibitory cytokines exert their antiproliferative effects on cells by interacting with specific cell surface receptors and initiating complementary cascades of intracellular biochemical events that affect the expression or activity of cell cycle controlling genes. Interferons (IFNs) 1The abbreviations used are: IFNinterferonPKRinterferon-induced double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinasedsRNAdouble-stranded RNAIL-6interleukin-6. are among the well known cytokines that function as potent growth inhibitors. A few components from the basic cell cycle machinery have been shown to be the downstream target genes for IFN signaling (1Kimchi A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 50: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The c-myc gene is a key target whose mRNA and protein expression is selectively suppressed by the different members of the IFN family (2Yarden A. Kimchi A. Science. 1986; 234: 1419-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 3Einat M. Resnitzky D. Kimchi A. Nature. 1985; 313: 597-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 4Resnitzky D. Kimchi A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1991; 2: 33-41PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of c-Myc suppression by the ectopic expression of deregulated c-myc caused partial relaxation of the proliferative responses to IFNs (4Resnitzky D. Kimchi A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1991; 2: 33-41PubMed Google Scholar) and further suggested the existence of additional complementary molecular pathways in the system. The pRB protein was then identified as a second independent target for the IFN signaling. Activation of pRB by IFNs through the suppression of its phosphorylation complemented the outcome of c-myc inhibition (5Resnitzky D. Tiefenbrun N. Berissi H. Kimchi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The pRB responses to IFNs were recently found to result from inhibition of the pRB kinases through the suppression of cyclin D and cdc25A phosphatase expression (6Tiefenbrun N. Melamed D. Levy N. Resnitzky D. Hoffmann I. Reed S.I. Kimchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3934-3944Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).A major question is how IFN signaling impinges on the aforementioned components of the cell cycle machinery and which of the transcriptionally activated IFN-responsive genes may couple these events. Among the well known immediate-early genes, the IFN-induced double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase (PKR) (7Meurs E. Chong K. Galabru J. Shaun N. Thomas B. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Hovanessian A.G. Cell. 1990; 62: 379-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar) was chosen in this work as a possible candidate for study because of its unique functional features. PKR is a cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase that is largely ribosomal associated. It is expressed constitutively at low levels in a large variety of mammalian cells and is induced severalfold in response to IFNs (8Hovanessian A.G. Semin. Virol. 1993; 4: 237-245Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). PKR is latent unless activated by dsRNA, single-stranded RNA with double-stranded regions, or some polyanions (e.g. heparin, dextran sulfate) (9Hovanessian A.G. Galabru J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The dsRNA binds to basic regions in the regulatory N-terminal portion of the protein, and this binding leads to the activation of the protein kinase domain located at the C-terminal portion of the protein. Upon activation, PKR is autophosphorylated at multiple sites (7Meurs E. Chong K. Galabru J. Shaun N. Thomas B. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Hovanessian A.G. Cell. 1990; 62: 379-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 10McCormack S.J. Thomis D.C. Samuel C.E.

Biol. 1995; 15: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and then it phosphorylates the α subunit of the eukaryotic peptide chain initiation factor eIF-2. The phosphorylated eIF-2-α sequesters the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF-2B. This in turn prevents the recycling of eIF-2-GDP to eIF-2-GTP and thereby blocks initiation of translation (12Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar).PKR was first identified as an important component of the host antiviral defense mechanism (13Rice A.P. Duncan R. Hershey J.W.B.

Virol. 1992; 66: 5804-5814Crossref Google Scholar). Subsequently it was found that this kinase exhibits features characteristic of a tumor suppressor gene. Overexpression of wild-type PKR was deleterious to the growth of certain mammalian cells (16Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonenberg N. Science. 1992; 257: 1685-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) and slowed the proliferation of yeasts (17Chong K.L. Feng L. Schappert K. Meurs E. Donahue T.F. Friesen J.D. Hovanessian A.G. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Moreover, transfections of NIH 3T3 cells with the catalytically inactive PKR mutants, which functioned in a dominant-negative fashion, induced malignant transformation (16Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonenberg N. Science. 1992; 257: 1685-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 18Meurs E.F. Galabru J. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Hovanessian A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In light of these growth suppressive functions we studied in this work whether PKR couples the IFN signaling to the basic cell cycle machinery. We report here that the ectopic expression of two different catalytically inactive PKR mutants abrogated the IFN-induced suppression of c-Myc. In contrast, cyclin D/pRB responses were not interrupted. Moreover, the introduction of wild-type PKR into cells restricted their proliferation in the absence of IFNs, a process that could be rescued by the ectopic expression of deregulated c-myc. These results functionally place PKR upstream of c-Myc along one of the molecular pathways that mediate the antiproliferative effects of IFNs.DISCUSSIONPKR has been identified as one of the immediate-early genes that are transactivated by IFNs through the ISRE enhancer element (32Tanaka H. Samuel C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7995-7999Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Previous findings indicated that this dsRNA-dependent serine/threonine kinase mediates some of the antiviral effects of IFNs. Yet, the possibility that it may function as a positive mediator of the antiproliferative effects of IFNs has not been addressed directly. This study presents two independent lines of evidence that firmly support an intriguing possibility that PKR may function as a mediator of the inhibitory effects of IFNs on c-myc expression and thereby on cell growth.The first line of experiments which suggested a functional coupling of PKR to c-myc was based on the ectopic expression of two dominant-negative mutants of PKR. These PKR mutants could act in a transdominant mode either by forming heterodimers with the endogenous kinase (33Kostura M. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 86-1576Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 34Thomis D.C. Samuel C.E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7695-7700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by sequestering the putative dsRNA activator of the kinase in the cells (30Sharp T.V. Xiao Q. Jeffrey I. Gewert D.R. Clemens M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 945-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The ectopic expression of the two catalytically inactive mutant versions interfered with the IFN-induced suppression of c-Myc protein. No detectable relaxation in the IL-6-induced c-Myc suppression or cell growth inhibition took place, thus supporting the notion that the mutant kinase interferes with the normal function of the endogenous kinase that is exclusively turned on by IFNs. Other molecular responses to IFNs, such as the conversion of pRB into the underphosphorylated protein and the decline in cyclin D and cyclin A protein levels, were not affected by the mutant PKR. The inhibitory effects of IFNs on pRB phosphorylation, achieved through the suppression of cyclin D and cdc25A expression, constitute another growth inhibitory pathway that functions in parallel to the c-myc path (5Resnitzky D. Tiefenbrun N. Berissi H. Kimchi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 6Tiefenbrun N. Melamed D. Levy N. Resnitzky D. Hoffmann I. Reed S.I. Kimchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3934-3944Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Since this pathway was not interrupted by the mutant PKR, it was not surprising that the outcome of the partial relaxation in the molecular responses was a mild yet consistent reduction in the growth sensitivity to IFNs.The second line of experiments that coupled PKR to c-myc was based on infections of M1 cells with retroviruses carrying the wild-type PKR. It was found that only a very small fraction of the M1 cell population was permissive to the ectopic expression of wild-type PKR. This was consistent with previous studies in which PKR was inhibitory to NIH 3T3 cells (16Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonenberg N. Science. 1992; 257: 1685-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) and in the yeasts (17Chong K.L. Feng L. Schappert K. Meurs E. Donahue T.F. Friesen J.D. Hovanessian A.G. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Very interestingly, the ectopic expression of a deregulated version of c-myc rescued to some extent the antiproliferative effects of the wild-type kinase as deduced by the increased frequency of stable drug-resistant infectants that emerged from myc-transfected cells. PKR therefore functions upstream of c-Myc. Moreover, this line of experiments provided a second independent support for the possibility that PKR functions as a mediator of the IFN inhibitory effects on c-Myc protein expression, since the same deregulated construct was also refractory to the inhibitory effects of IFNs (4Resnitzky D. Kimchi A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1991; 2: 33-41PubMed Google Scholar).The mechanism by which PKR may suppress c-Myc protein expression remains to be determined. PKR could directly inhibit c-myc translation in light of its well established function as an inhibitor of peptide chain initiation by phosphorylating the eIF-2 initiation factor (8Hovanessian A.G. Semin. Virol. 1993; 4: 237-245Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Alternatively, PKR could have indirect effects. The parental M1-S6 subclone that was chosen for the infections displayed reduction of c-Myc protein by IFNs in the absence of any detectable fluctuations in the c-myc mRNA levels. This may be critical if the involvement of PKR is direct, e.g. involvement in the translational suppression of c-Myc (35DeBenedetti A. Baglioni C. Nature. 1984; 311: 79-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In that case specificity could be conferred by the stem-loop secondary structure predicted to be formed in the c-myc mRNA between complementary regions in the first and second exons (36Saito H. Hayday A.C. Wiman K. Hayward W.S. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7476-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the version of deregulated c-myc which was refractory to both IFN and PKR lacked the first non-coding exon. Alternatively, the linkage between PKR and c-myc could be indirect, i.e. the mutant PKR could interfere with upstream IFN-induced afferent activities that are evoked by the wild-type PKR and lead to c-Myc suppression. The latter is consistent with some of the previous reports that showed that in NIH 3T3 cells that were transfected with mutant PKR the extent of eIF-2 phosphorylation upon viral infection was not diminished (15Meurs E.F. Watanabe Y. Kadereit S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Chong K. Williams B.R. Hovanessian A.G. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5804-5814Crossref Google Scholar). Similarly, in the yeast model system, the PKR K296R mutant was found to be recessive, i.e. it did not interfere with the action of the wild-type PKR for the eIF2 phosphorylation (37Romano P.R. Green S.R. Barber G.N. Mathews M.B. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 365-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is conceivable that PKR may phosphorylate additional substrates besides eIF-2 and therefore may be involved in other processes. At least two additional proteins were reported to serve as substrates for PKR, including a 90-kDa reticulocyte protein (38Rice A.P. Kostura M. Mathews M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20632-20637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the IkB inhibitor (39Kumar A. Haque J. Lacoste J. Hiscott J. Williams B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6288-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 40Maran A. Maitra R.K. Kumar A. Dong B. Xiao W. Li G. Williams B.R. Torrence P.F. Silverman R.H. Science. 1994; 265: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar).Taken together, our results link the IFN-induced PKR to the negative control of the nuclear proto-oncogene c-myc and thereby place this well characterized dsRNA-dependent serine/threonine kinase on one of the multiple growth suppressive pathways that are initiated by IFNs.

The dsRNA binds to basic regions in the regulatory N-terminal portion of the protein, and this binding leads to the activation of the protein kinase domain located at the C-terminal portion of the protein. Upon activation, PKR is autophosphorylated at multiple sites (7Meurs E. Chong K. Galabru J. Shaun N. Thomas B. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Hovanessian A.G. Cell. 1990; 62: 379-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 10McCormack S.J. Thomis D.C. Samuel C.E.

Biol. 1995; 15: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and then it phosphorylates the α subunit of the eukaryotic peptide chain initiation factor eIF-2. The phosphorylated eIF-2-α sequesters the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF-2B. This in turn prevents the recycling of eIF-2-GDP to eIF-2-GTP and thereby blocks initiation of translation (12Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). PKR was first identified as an important component of the host antiviral defense mechanism (13Rice A.P. Duncan R. Hershey J.W.B. Kerr I.M. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 894-898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Samuel C.E. Duncan R. Knutson G.S. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol.

Virol. 1992; 66: 5804-5814Crossref Google Scholar). Subsequently it was found that this kinase exhibits features characteristic of a tumor suppressor gene. Overexpression of wild-type PKR was deleterious to the growth of certain mammalian cells (16Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonenberg N. Science. 1992; 257: 1685-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) and slowed the proliferation of yeasts (17Chong K.L. Feng L. Schappert K. Meurs E. Donahue T.F. Friesen J.D. Hovanessian A.G. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Moreover, transfections of NIH 3T3 cells with the catalytically inactive PKR mutants, which functioned in a dominant-negative fashion, induced malignant transformation (16Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonenberg N. Science. 1992; 257: 1685-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 18Meurs E.F. Galabru J. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Hovanessian A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In light of these growth suppressive functions we studied in this work whether PKR couples the IFN signaling to the basic cell cycle machinery. We report here that the ectopic expression of two different catalytically inactive PKR mutants abrogated the IFN-induced suppression of c-Myc. In contrast, cyclin D/pRB responses were not interrupted. Moreover, the introduction of wild-type PKR into cells restricted their proliferation in the absence of IFNs, a process that could be rescued by the ectopic expression of deregulated c-myc. These results functionally place PKR upstream of c-Myc along one of the molecular pathways that mediate the antiproliferative effects of IFNs. DISCUSSIONPKR has been identified as one of the immediate-early genes that are transactivated by IFNs through the ISRE enhancer element (32Tanaka H. Samuel C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7995-7999Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Previous findings indicated that this dsRNA-dependent serine/threonine kinase mediates some of the antiviral effects of IFNs. Yet, the possibility that it may function as a positive mediator of the antiproliferative effects of IFNs has not been addressed directly. This study presents two independent lines of evidence that firmly support an intriguing possibility that PKR may function as a mediator of the inhibitory effects of IFNs on c-myc expression and thereby on cell growth.The first line of experiments which suggested a functional coupling of PKR to c-myc was based on the ectopic expression of two dominant-negative mutants of PKR. These PKR mutants could act in a transdominant mode either by forming heterodimers with the endogenous kinase (33Kostura M. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 86-1576Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 34Thomis D.C. Samuel C.E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7695-7700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by sequestering the putative dsRNA activator of the kinase in the cells (30Sharp T.V. Xiao Q. Jeffrey I. Gewert D.R. Clemens M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 945-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The ectopic expression of the two catalytically inactive mutant versions interfered with the IFN-induced suppression of c-Myc protein. No detectable relaxation in the IL-6-induced c-Myc suppression or cell growth inhibition took place, thus supporting the notion that the mutant kinase interferes with the normal function of the endogenous kinase that is exclusively turned on by IFNs. Other molecular responses to IFNs, such as the conversion of pRB into the underphosphorylated protein and the decline in cyclin D and cyclin A protein levels, were not affected by the mutant PKR. The inhibitory effects of IFNs on pRB phosphorylation, achieved through the suppression of cyclin D and cdc25A expression, constitute another growth inhibitory pathway that functions in parallel to the c-myc path (5Resnitzky D. Tiefenbrun N. Berissi H. Kimchi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 6Tiefenbrun N. Melamed D. Levy N. Resnitzky D. Hoffmann I. Reed S.I. Kimchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3934-3944Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Since this pathway was not interrupted by the mutant PKR, it was not surprising that the outcome of the partial relaxation in the molecular responses was a mild yet consistent reduction in the growth sensitivity to IFNs.The second line of experiments that coupled PKR to c-myc was based on infections of M1 cells with retroviruses carrying the wild-type PKR. It was found that only a very small fraction of the M1 cell population was permissive to the ectopic expression of wild-type PKR. This was consistent with previous studies in which PKR was inhibitory to NIH 3T3 cells (16Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonenberg N. Science. 1992; 257: 1685-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) and in the yeasts (17Chong K.L. Feng L. Schappert K. Meurs E. Donahue T.F. Friesen J.D. Hovanessian A.G. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Very interestingly, the ectopic expression of a deregulated version of c-myc rescued to some extent the antiproliferative effects of the wild-type kinase as deduced by the increased frequency of stable drug-resistant infectants that emerged from myc-transfected cells. PKR therefore functions upstream of c-Myc. Moreover, this line of experiments provided a second independent support for the possibility that PKR functions as a mediator of the IFN inhibitory effects on c-Myc protein expression, since the same deregulated construct was also refractory to the inhibitory effects of IFNs (4Resnitzky D. Kimchi A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1991; 2: 33-41PubMed Google Scholar).The mechanism by which PKR may suppress c-Myc protein expression remains to be determined. PKR could directly inhibit c-myc translation in light of its well established function as an inhibitor of peptide chain initiation by phosphorylating the eIF-2 initiation factor (8Hovanessian A.G. Semin. Virol. 1993; 4: 237-245Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Alternatively, PKR could have indirect effects. The parental M1-S6 subclone that was chosen for the infections displayed reduction of c-Myc protein by IFNs in the absence of any detectable fluctuations in the c-myc mRNA levels. This may be critical if the involvement of PKR is direct, e.g. involvement in the translational suppression of c-Myc (35DeBenedetti A. Baglioni C. Nature. 1984; 311: 79-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In that case specificity could be conferred by the stem-loop secondary structure predicted to be formed in the c-myc mRNA between complementary regions in the first and second exons (36Saito H. Hayday A.C. Wiman K. Hayward W.S. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7476-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the version of deregulated c-myc which was refractory to both IFN and PKR lacked the first non-coding exon. Alternatively, the linkage between PKR and c-myc could be indirect, i.e. the mutant PKR could interfere with upstream IFN-induced afferent activities that are evoked by the wild-type PKR and lead to c-Myc suppression. The latter is consistent with some of the previous reports that showed that in NIH 3T3 cells that were transfected with mutant PKR the extent of eIF-2 phosphorylation upon viral infection was not diminished (15Meurs E.F. Watanabe Y. Kadereit S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Chong K. Williams B.R. Hovanessian A.G. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5804-5814Crossref Google Scholar). Similarly, in the yeast model system, the PKR K296R mutant was found to be recessive, i.e. it did not interfere with the action of the wild-type PKR for the eIF2 phosphorylation (37Romano P.R. Green S.R. Barber G.N. Mathews M.B. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 365-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is conceivable that PKR may phosphorylate additional substrates besides eIF-2 and therefore may be involved in other processes. At least two additional proteins were reported to serve as substrates for PKR, including a 90-kDa reticulocyte protein (38Rice A.P. Kostura M. Mathews M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20632-20637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the IkB inhibitor (39Kumar A. Haque J. Lacoste J. Hiscott J. Williams B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Experiments with trypsin and insect gut juice enzyme digestions of mutant toxins showed that these mutations did not produce any gross structural changes to the toxin molecule. Bioassay data showed that mutant G439A (alanine substitution of residue Gly439) and F440A significantly reduced toxicity toward M. sexta and H. virescens. In contrast, mutants S438A, S441A, N442A, and S443A were similar or only marginally less toxic (2-3 times) to the insects compared to the wild-type toxin. Binding studies with brush border membrane vesicles prepared from M. sexta and H. virescens midgut membranes revealed that the loss of toxicity of mutants G439A and F440A was attributable to substantially reduced initial binding. Consistent with the initial binding, mutants G349A and F440A showed 3.5 times less binding to M. sexta and H. virescens brush border membrane vesicles, although the off-rate of bound toxins was not affected. The role of hydrophobic residue, Phe440, is distinctly different from our previous observation that alanine substitution of Phe371 at loop 2 of CryIAb did not affect initial binding but reduced irreversible association of the toxin to the receptor or membrane toward M. sexta (Rajamohan, F., Alcantara, E., Lee, M. K., Chen, X. J., and Dean, D. H. (1995) J. Bacteriol. 177, 2276-2282). Likewise, deletion of relatively hydrophobic CryIAa loop 3 residues, 440AAGA443 (D3a), resulted in reduced toxicity to Bombyx mori (>62 times less) and M. sexta (28 times less). The loss of toxicity was correlated with reduced initial binding to midgut vesicles prepared from these insects. However, alanine substitution of residues 437LSQ439 (A3a), contiguous to loop 3, altered neither toxicity nor receptor binding toward B. mori or M. sexta.

Increase both of Sp100 and PML mRNA is due to enhanced transcription of the corresponding genes which occurs independently of cellular protein synthesis immediately upon IFN-β addition. Here, we describe the molecular cloning and functional analysis of the Sp100 promoter. DNA sequence analysis revealed potential binding sites for several constitutive and IFN-inducible transcription factors. Consistent with the absence of a TATA box and an initiator element, several transcription initiation sites were found. Transient expression studies identified an imperfect IFN-stimulated response element within the first 100 nucleotides upstream of the major transcription start site. This element rendered a heterologous promoter IFN-β-inducible and bound IFN-stimulated gene factor 2 strongly but IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 only weakly. An IFN-γ activation site approximately 500 base pairs upstream of the IFN-stimulated response element was found to bind three IFN-α/β activation factors upon IFN-β induction and conferred both type I and type II IFN inducibility upon a heterologous promoter.

Gr÷tzinger T. Will H. Scand. J. Immunol. 1995; 42: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and appears to be a transcriptional transactivator (16Kakizuka A. Miller Jr., W.H. Umesono K.

It was discovered originally in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a hematopoietic malignancy in which the normal development of myeloid precursors is blocked at the promyelocytic stage. In APL cells the PML protein is fused to retinoic acid receptor-α sequences (17de Thé H. Chomienne C. Lanotte M. Degos L. Dejean A. Nature. 1990; 347: 558-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar, 18de Thé H. Lavau C. Marchio A. Chomienne C. Degos L. Dejean A. Cell. 1991; 66: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar), and its expression leads to a redistribution of both the PML and Sp100 proteins. Since retinoic acid treatment of APL cells leads to normalization of the ND pattern and releases the differentiation block, it was speculated that disruption of the NDs causes APL (9Koken M.H.M.

NDs and their associated proteins appear to play a role not only in tumorigenesis and autoimmunity but also in virus infection as changes in cellular localization are induced by various viral transcription factors (13Guldner H.H.

The autoimmunogenic character and putatively similar function of Sp100 and PML, the modulation of the NDs in tumorigenesis and virus infection, and the IFN-enhanced expression of all known ND proteins prompted us to investigate in more detail the mechanism of the transcriptional regulation of these genes. For Sp100 and PML, we could recently demonstrate that IFN-enhanced expression is mainly due to an increased transcription rate of the corresponding genes (14Gr÷tzinger T. Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Will H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, from these and other studies (15Lavau C. Marchio A. Fagioli M. Jansen J. Falini B. Lebon P. Grosveld F. Pandolfi P.P. Pelicci P.G. Dejean A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 871-876PubMed Google Scholar), it has not become clear which factors and mechanisms are involved in IFN inducibility. nuclear dot interferon acute promyelocytic leukemia signal transducer and activator of transcription IFN-stimulated response element IFN-stimulated gene factor IFN regulatory factor IFN-γ activation factor IFN-γ activation site IFN-α activation factor herpes simplex virus housekeeping initiator protein 1 polymerase chain reaction chloramphenicol acetyltransferase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay base pair(s). Activation of transcription by IFNs involves binding of the ligands to their receptors followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptors, of specific tyrosine kinases, and of latent cytoplasmic transcription factor subunits called STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription) (reviewed in 27Decker T. Reder A.T. Interferon Therapy of Multiple Sclerosis. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar, 28Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4912) Google Scholar, 29Müller M. Ibelgaufts H. Kerr I.M. J. Viral Hepatitis. 1994; 1: 87-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The STATs are then assembled to form functional transcription factors which are translocated into the nucleus. Within their promoter regions IFN-α/β-inducible genes contain IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) (28Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4912) Google Scholar) that interact specifically with three major complexes, the IFN-stimulated gene factors ISGF1, ISGF2, and ISGF3. ISGF3, the major primary transcriptional activator (30Dale T.C. Imam A.M.A. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1203-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 31Levy D.E. Kessler D.S. Pine R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1362-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), consists of three α-subunits, p91 (STAT1α), p84 (STAT1β), and p113 (STAT2) that assemble in the cytoplasm upon phosphorylation (see above) and, together with the ISGF3γ subunit p48, form transcriptionally active ISGF3. ISGF2, identical to IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) (32Miyamoto M. Fujita T. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Harada H. Sudo Y. Miyata T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1988; 54: 903-913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar, 33Pine R. Decker T. Kessler D.S. Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2448-2457Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) also binds to the ISRE, but more slowly after IFN addition. Unlike ISGF3, ISGF2 binding requires ongoing protein synthesis (34Levy D.E. Kessler D.S. Pine R. Reich N. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Currently, it is believed that ISGF2 functions as a positive transcriptional regulator which maintains IFN-enhanced transcription initiated by ISGF3 (35Imam A.M.A. Ackrill A.M. Dale T.C. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6573-6580Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). ISGF1 is identical or at least contains IFN regulatory factor-2 (IRF-2) (36Harada H. Fujita T. Miyamoto M. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Furia A. Miyata T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1989; 58: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 37Parrington J. Rogers N.C. Gewert D.R. Pine R. Veals S.A. Levy D.E. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and appears to be a constitutive ISRE-binding factor that acts negatively on ISGF2 (36Harada H. Fujita T. Miyamoto M. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Furia A. Miyata T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1989; 58: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). In contrast to ISGF3, both ISGF1 and ISGF2 need only the ISRE core sequence 5ʹ-TTCNNTTT-3ʹ for binding (28Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4912) Google Scholar). In contrast to type I IFNs, receptor-binding of IFN-γ triggers tyrosine phosphorylation only of STAT1, which leads to homodimerization and subsequent translocation of the active transcription factor into the nucleus (reviewed in 27Decker T. Reder A.T. Interferon Therapy of Multiple Sclerosis. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar and 29Müller M. Ibelgaufts H. Kerr I.M. J. Viral Hepatitis. 1994; 1: 87-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This factor, IFN-γ activation factor (GAF), and a cognate IFN-γ activation site (GAS) were discovered originally through studies on the IFN-α/β- and IFN-γ-induced transcription of the GBP gene (38Decker T. Lew D.J. Mirkovitch J. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 39Lew D.J. Decker T. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5404-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 40Lew D.J. Decker T. Strehlow I. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Later on, GAS binding was also observed for an IFN-α-inducible factor which was therefore termed IFN-α activation factor (AAF) (41Decker T. Lew D.J. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5147-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, the discovery of the STAT proteins and the elucidation of the mechanisms of their activation strongly suggested that GAF and AAF are identical (42Pine R. Canova A. Schindler C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) and that a GAS may render a promoter responsible for both types of IFNs. Here we describe the cloning and functional characterization of the Sp100 promoter region and the identification of sequence elements to which IFN-induced transcription factors bind. The results demonstrate that IFN-inducible Sp100 gene transcription is similar but not identical to the very well studied IFN-inducible GBP gene and, therefore, represents a unique example of an IFN-regulated promoter. For isolation of Sp100 promoter DNA fragments, a genomic library of the Burkitt's lymphoma cell line BL64 in λ vector EMBL3A (43Hartl P. Lipp M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2037-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was screened with a full-length 32P-labeled Sp100 cDNA probe (2Szostecki C. Guldner H.H. Netter H.J. Will H. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 4338-4347PubMed Google Scholar). Positive plaques were further screened with 32P-labeled oligonucleotides from the 5ʹ-end of the Sp100 cDNA (Sp32, 5ʹ-ATGGCAGGTGGGGGCGG-3ʹ; Sp347, 5ʹ-CCACTCTCTGTACAGGG-3ʹ) according to standard protocols (44Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The DNA of one of the positive λ clones was double-digested with SalI and XhoI, and all fragments were subcloned into SalI-digested pUC19. A plasmid containing the appropriate Sp100 promoter fragment was then identified by hybridization of the bacterial colonies with a fluorescein-11-dUTP-labeled oligonucleotide from the 5ʹ-end of the Sp100 coding region (Sp61, 5ʹ-GGTGCTCAGGTCGCCGCC-3ʹ) and by enhanced chemiluminescence detection according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Corp.). The nomenclature of the oligonucleotides corresponds to their 5ʹ-positions in the Sp100-cDNA (2Szostecki C. Guldner H.H. Netter H.J. Will H. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 4338-4347PubMed Google Scholar). Double-stranded DNA was sequenced using the Sequenase Version 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and 35S-dATP, or by PCR cycle-sequencing with fluorescence dyes and use of a Li-Cor 4000 DNA sequencer. For PCR amplifications, buffers, reaction mixes, and cycling conditions were chosen as described elsewhere (45Barnes W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2216-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was prepared by the urea/LiCl method (46Auffray C. Rougeon F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (2084) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified from total RNA using Oligotex-dT spin columns (Qiagen). Four micrograms of poly(A)+ RNA per reaction mixed with 500,000 cpm 32P-labeled primer (specific activity, 3 x 106 cpm/pmol) were denatured for 10 min at 90°C in 15 μl of 150 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.3), 1 mM EDTA, and subsequently annealed for 90 min at 60°C. For primer extension 30 μl of reverse transcriptase mix (30 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.3), 15 mM MgCl2, 8 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml actinomycin D, 3 mM dNTPs, 40 units of RNasin, 9.5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase) were added, and the samples were incubated 60 min at 42°C. The reactions were stopped by adding 105 μl of RNase mix (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 20 μg/ml DNase-free RNase A) and incubation for 15 min at 37°C. After phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on 6% acrylamide (29:1), 7 M urea gels. Hela S3, HEp2, and HuH7 (47Nakabayashi H. Taketa K. Miyano K. Yamane T. Sato J. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 3858-3863PubMed Google Scholar) cells were maintained as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Human IFN-β and -γ were used at concentrations of 1000 and 100 units/ml, respectively. Plasmid DNAs were introduced into cells by the calcium phosphate procedure (44Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). One picomole of Sp100 promoter CAT construct and 1 μg of a CMV-lacZ construct, adjusted to 10 μg of DNA with pUC19, were precipitated per 6-cm dish. For transfection of thymidine kinase/ISRE- and thymidine kinase/GAS-CAT constructs, 3 pmol of plasmid were used. Calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitates were left on the cells overnight and removed by exchange of the medium, and cells were then incubated for a further 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with or without IFN. The amount of CAT protein was determined immunologically with a commercially available CAT ELISA kit (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared essentially as described previously (48Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar), except that 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2.5 μg/ml pepstatin A were added to both hypotonic and high salt buffer, and additionally 0.1% Nonidet P-40 to the hypotonic buffer. After cell lysis on ice for 10 min, nuclei were collected by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 1 min at 4°C (13,000 rpm), resuspended in high salt buffer, and incubated on ice for 20 min. After centrifugation for 10 min at 4°C (13,000 rpm) the supernatant containing the soluble nuclear proteins was recovered. For gel mobility shift assays (49Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar, 50Garner M.M. Revzin A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3047-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar) 10 μg of nuclear proteins were preincubated for 5 min at room temperature with 4 μg of poly[d(I-C)] and 100 ng of unrelated single-stranded oligonucleotide in 25 μl of 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol. After addition of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (50,000 cpm, corresponding to about 5 fmol) and incubation for 20 min at room temperature, DNA-protein complexes were analyzed on 6% acrylamide (80:1) gels run in 0.25 x TBE. For competition experiments unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were used in an 100-fold molar excess. Polyclonal rabbit antisera against p84/p91, ISGF2/IRF1, and ISGF3γ/p48 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. In gel supershift experiments, these were added 10 min after addition of the radiolabeled oligonucleotide. A genomic DNA fragment containing promoter sequences of the Sp100 gene was isolated from a genomic phage λ library of the Burkitt's lymphoma cell line BL64 by hybridization with a 32P-labeled full-length Sp100 cDNA (2Szostecki C. Guldner H.H. Netter H.J. Will H. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 4338-4347PubMed Google Scholar). An approximately 10-kilobase pair long restriction fragment of the insert was subcloned into pUC19. The promoter region of this insert, comprising 1114 bp upstream of the translational start codon of the Sp100 gene and 146 bp downstream thereof extending into intron I, was sequenced using synthetic oligonucleotides as primers (Fig. 1). Inspection of the sequence revealed neither a consensus CCAAT or TATA box nor a consensus initiator element that can functionally substitute a TATA box (51Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). However, we found the sequence element ACTTCN18GCCA at the transcription initiation sites (see below and Fig. 1) which diverges by only one nucleotide from the housekeeping initiator protein 1 (HIP1) binding site (ATTTCN1-19GCCA) described for several other TATA-less promoters (52Means A.L. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). As HIP1 was shown to be sufficient for mediating transcription initiation at the ATTTC and/or GCCA site when combined with at least one binding site for transcription factor Sp1 (52Means A.L. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 53Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (875) Google Scholar) and as the Sp100 promoter also has a closely spaced Sp1 binding site (Fig. 1), these sequences are probably important for Sp100 promoter activity and transcription initiation. Similarly, potential binding sites for the transcription factor Ap1 (54Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2146) Google Scholar) and for NF-κB (55Baeuerle P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 63-80PubMed Google Scholar) could also play a role in promoter activity (Fig. 1). Three sequence motifs, two consensus GAS located at positions -655 to -647 and -811 to -803, and one with similarity to an ISRE at position -162 to -149, which may confer IFN inducibility upon the Sp100 gene, were also identified (Fig. 1). Both GAS motifs exactly match the consensus sequence (5ʹ-TTCNNNGAA-3ʹ) (56Horvath C.M. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 984-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), whereas the ISRE diverges from the consensus sequence (5ʹ-AGTTTCNNTTTCNY-3ʹ) (28Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4912) Google Scholar) at three nucleotide positions (-161, -152, and -151), one of them (-161) being highly conserved. Taken together, computer analysis of the Sp100 promoter sequence revealed several features typical for promoters of housekeeping genes and three potential elements which may be relevant for IFN-enhanced transcription of the Sp100 gene. A prerequisite for functional analysis of promoters is the mapping of the start sites of transcription. Therefore, primer extension analysis was carried out by reverse transcription of RNA from IFN-β-treated or untreated HEp2 cells, using a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide specific for Sp100 or, as a control, for β-actin as primers. Two distinct size classes of reverse transcription products were observed with RNA from IFN-treated cells (three separate experiments, one example shown in Fig. 2, lane 2) with the Sp100 oligonucleotide indicating several transcription start sites at the potential ACTTC- and GCCA-HIP1 binding region (Fig. 1). In untreated cells, essentially the same type of signals were seen but only after a much longer exposure (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 1*). Although the sizes of the products were the same in IFN-treated and untreated cells, the major transcription initiation site corresponding to one of the fast migrating fragments was predominant only in IFN-treated cells (Fig. 2, compare lanes 1* and 2). This indicates an IFN-dependent quantitative change in transcription initiation site usage. The correct mapping of the 5ʹ-end of the β-actin mRNA in the control experiment with RNA from IFN-β-treated or untreated HEp2 cells, the lack of reverse transcripts when Escherichia coli tRNA was used as negative control template (Fig. 2, lanes 3, 4, and 5, respectively), and the much stronger Sp100 signals in IFN-treated compared to untreated cells demonstrate that the Sp100 primer extension products reflect true transcription initiation sites. These results were confirmed by RNase protection experiments (data not shown). Mapping of the transcription initiation sites provided the basis for the identification of sequence elements regulating the constitutive and IFN-inducible Sp100 promoter activity by transient transfection experiments. Several Sp100 promoter fragments were generated by PCR (Fig. 3A) and cloned blunt end into SmaI-digested vector pGCAT-C (58Frebourg T. Brison O. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 65: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) upstream of the CAT gene. All constructs, except pGCAT-1091 and -266, contain the authentic Sp100 translation start codon for expression of CAT fusion proteins (Fig. 3A). Three transient transfection experiments with HuH7 cells and two different DNA preparations (Fig. 3B, transfections 1, 2, and 3) of each CAT construct containing promoter fragments in sense orientation (Fig. 3A) resulted in similar, although slightly fluctuating, amounts of CAT enzyme at levels comparable to that achieved with a reference herpes simplex virus (HSV) thymidine kinase promoter construct (pBLCAT2) (59Luckow B. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). Consistent with our previous computer predictions, these experiments indicate that the sequence elements required for constitutive Sp100 promoter activity are located between positions -143 and -14. When the same experiments were performed with cells treated after transfection with IFN-β, all fragments in sense orientation with 5ʹ-ends between positions -1104 and -192 and 3ʹ-ends either at position +12 or -14 exhibited much higher promoter activity than in untreated cells (Fig. 3B). Progressive 5ʹ-deletions up to nucleotide position -193 (constructs pGCAT-1116 to -204) gradually reduced IFN-β inducibility from 13.0- to 7.4-fold but did not completely abolish IFN-β responsiveness. The fragment with the 5ʹ-end at position -143 and the 3ʹ-end at position +12 retained basal promoter activity but lacked IFN inducibility completely. As expected, the promoter fragment tested in reverse orientation (Fig. 3, pGCAT-1116(-)) as well as the vector without insert had neither constitutive nor IFN-inducible promoter activity. These data locate an IFN-β-responsive element within region -192 to -144 of the Sp100 promoter.

To date, two proteins have been implicated as functioning as molecular chaperones in the assembly of nascent TCR proteins: calnexin, a resident ER transmembrane protein, which associates with all TCR components except ζ, and T cell receptor-associated protein, which selectively associates with CD3γϵ pairs. In this study, we examined the association of calreticulin, a soluble protein with significant sequence homology to calnexin, with newly synthesized TCR proteins. Analogous to calnexin, processing of glycan chains by glucosidase enzymes was required for initial association of TCRα and -β proteins with calreticulin; however, several major differences were noted regarding interaction of calnexin and calreticulin chaperones with TCR proteins. First, TCRα and -β proteins showed prolonged association with calnexin molecules compared with calreticulin; interaction of TCRα proteins with calreticulin was particularly transient, with most calreticulin-TCRα protein complexes dissociating within 15 min of their initial assembly. Second, we found that, unlike calnexin, which associated with clonotypic TCRα and -β proteins and invariant CD3δ and -ϵ polypeptides, calreticulin associated specifically with clonotypic TCRα and -β proteins. These studies identify calreticulin as a molecular chaperone for nascent clonotypic TCRα and -β proteins and demonstrate that calreticulin and calnexin differentially associate with newly synthesized TCR proteins within the ER.

We have studied recombinant factor IX mutants which lack Ca2+ binding to the first EGF-like domain, due to a replacement of Asp64 by Glu, Lys, or Val. The purified mutants (factors IX D64E, D64K, and D64V), were compared to plasma-derived and recombinant wild-type factor IX with regard to a number of metal-ion dependent functional parameters. In the presence of Mg2+, the activated mutants were indistinguishable from normal factor IXa in hydrolyzing the synthetic substrate CH3-SO2-Leu-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide. Replacing Mg2+ by Ca2+ further stimulated the activity of normal factor IXa but not of mutant factor IXa. In factor VIII-independent factor X activation, factor IXa D64K and D64E displayed reduced catalytic activity compared to normal factor IXa (apparent kcat/Km≈ 1, 2, and 4 x 103M-1 s-1, respectively). In the presence of factor VIIIa, factor X activation rates by normal and mutant factor IXa were stimulated by factor VIIIa to a different extent (≈700- and 200-fold, respectively), indicating that Asp64 replacements affect the interaction with factor VIIIa. This possibility was addressed in inhibition studies employing synthetic peptides comprising the factor IXa-binding motifs of factor VIII heavy or light chains. Whereas the heavy chain peptide (Ser558-Gln565) inhibited factor VIII-dependent factor X activation by normal and mutant factor IXa with similar efficiency, the light chain peptide (Lys1804-Lys1818) inhibited normal factor IXa 2-3-fold more efficiently than did mutant factor IXa. This indicates that the reduced response to factor VIIIa may be due to impaired binding of mutant factor IXa to the factor VIII light chain. This was further explored in direct binding studies. In the presence of Mg2+, normal and mutant factor IXa were similar in binding to the factor VIII light chain. However, in the presence of Ca2+, factor IXa mutants were less efficient than normal factor IXa, which was illustrated by a 4-5-fold lower affinity than normal factor IXa for factor VIII light chain. Collectively, our data demonstrate that a number of factor IXa functions, including enzymatic activity and assembly into the factor IXa-factor VIIIa complex, are dependent on Ca2+ binding to the first EGF-like domain of factor IX.

Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). The physiological importance of FIX is apparent from the notion that its deficiency or dysfunction is associated with the severe bleeding disorder hemophilia B (2Sadler J.E. Davie E.W. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Nienhuis A. Leder P. Majerus P. The Molecular Basis of Blood Diseases. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1987: 575Google Scholar). In plasma, FIX circulates as a single chain polypeptide (3DiScipio R.G. Hermodson M.A. Yates S.G. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 698-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Activation of the zymogen is achieved by limited proteolysis of the Arg145-Ala146 and Arg180-Val181 bonds by factor XIa (FXIa) or factor VIIa (FVIIa) resulting in the enzyme factor IXaβ (FIXa) (4Lindquist P.A.

Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 4508-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). FIXa activates factor X (FX) in a complex which requires the presence of phospholipids, Ca2+ ions, and a nonenzymatic cofactor, activated factor VIII (FVIIIa) (6Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of FVIIIa in this complex markedly enhances proteolytic activity of the enzyme FIXa (7van Dieijen G.

FIXa consists of a light and heavy chain (Mr 18,000 and 28,000, respectively) which are covalently linked. Furthermore, FIXa comprises a number of discrete domains arranged in a structure which is shared with a number of other vitamin K-dependent serine proteases (13Furie B. Furie B.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). FIXa heavy chain comprises the trypsin-like protease domain with the catalytic center (14DiScipio R.G. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 899-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The light chain consists of an amino-terminal domain containing several γ-carboxylated glutamic acid residues (15Kurachi K. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6461-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), a short hydrophobic stack (16Anson D.S. Choo K.H. Rees D.J. Giannelli F. Gould K. Huddleston J.A. Brownlee G.G. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1053-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and two domains that share considerable homology with the epidermal growth factor (EGF) (17Stenflo J. Blood. 1991; 78: 1637-1651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like other vitamin K-dependent serine proteases, FIX comprises a number of Ca2+ binding sites, with affinities in the micromolar and millimolar range (18Amplett G.W. Kisiel W. Castellino F.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 208: 576-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 19Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4127-4132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One high affinity binding site is located in the FIXa protease domain (20Bajaj S.P. Sabharwal A.K. Gorka J. Birktoft J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), while another is located in the first EGF-like domain (21Handford P.A. Baron M. Mayhew M. Willis A. Beesley T. Brownlee G.G. Campbell I.D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Recent analysis of the crystal structure of the Ca2+-containing EGF-like domain revealed that residues Asp47, Gln50, and Asp64 are crucial for Ca2+ binding (22Rao Z. Handford P. Mayhew M. Knott V. Brownlee G.G. Stuart D. Cell. 1995; 82: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Recombinant as well as natural variants of FIX comprising mutations at these positions have been reported to display impaired FIX activity (23Rees D.J.G. Jones I.M. Handford P.A. Walter S.J. Esnouf M.P. Smith K.J. Brownlee G.G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2053-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 24Roberts H.R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For instance, the FIX mutant with the Asp64 residue replaced by a Lys residue (FIX D64K) lacks Ca2+ binding to its first EGF-like domain (25Handford P.A. Mayhew M. Baron M. Winship P.R. Campbell I.D. Brownlee G.G. Nature. 1991; 351: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and displays less than 5% biological activity compared to normal FIX (23Rees D.J.G. Jones I.M. Handford P.A. Walter S.J. Esnouf M.P. Smith K.J. Brownlee G.G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2053-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This demonstrates that Ca2+ binding to the first EGF-like domain indeed is essential for appropriate FIX function. However, it remains unclear by which mechanism Ca2+ binding to the first EGF-like domain contributes to FIX activity. In the present study, the effect of Ca2+ binding to the first EGF-like domain was investigated employing recombinant FIX mutants, in which the Asp64 had been substituted by Glu, Lys, or Val. These mutants were compared to normal FIX with regard to a number of functional parameters. These included reactivity toward synthetic and natural substrates and the interaction with the cofactor FVIII. This approach revealed that binding of Ca2+ to the first EGF-like domain contributes to enzyme activity and assembly of the FIXa·FVIIIa complex.

Antibodies were purified employing protein A-Sepharose as recommended by the manufacturer. Antibodies were conjugated with horseradish peroxidase as described elsewhere (26Nakane P.K. Kawaoi A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1974; 22: 1084-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). FVIII and FVIII light chain were purified as outlined previously (10Lenting P.J.

Purified antithrombin III and human serum albumin (HSA) were from the Division of Products of our institute. Peptide Lys1804-Lys1818 represents the FIXa binding site on the corresponding FVIII light chain region (i.e. KNFVKPNETKTYFWK) and was prepared as described previously (11Lenting P.J. van de Loo J.-W.H.P. Donath M.-J.S.H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1935-1940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Peptide Ser558-Gln565 comprises the FIXa binding site on the corresponding FVIII heavy chain region (i.e. SVDQRGNQ) (9Fay P.J. Beattie T. Huggins C.F. Regan L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20522-20527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This peptide was synthesized by Eurosequence B.V. (Groningen, the Netherlands). Both peptides were more than 90% pure as determined by high performance liquid chromatography analysis, and their identity was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Stable cell lines expressing wt-FIX or the substitution mutants D64E, D64K, or D64V were obtained by transfecting Madin-Darby canine kidney cells with previously described plasmids (23Rees D.J.G. Jones I.M. Handford P.A. Walter S.J. Esnouf M.P. Smith K.J. Brownlee G.G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2053-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 28Rees, D. J.

Cell lines producing appropriate levels of FIX antigen (120-300 ng/(106 cells·24 h)) were selected for large scale production. Each cell line was analyzed to verify that it contained the appropriate substitution in the cDNA encoding the FIX molecule. Cells were maintained in 1-liter cell factories in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2.5% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.4% (v/v) Fungizone, 5 μg/ml vitamin K1. Culture medium was harvested every 48 h. The medium was subsequently filtered to remove cell debris and concentrated approximately 10-fold employing a hollow fiber cartridge (Hemoflow 5; Fresenius, Bad Homburg, Germany). Benzamidine was added to a final concentration of 10 mM, and the concentrates were stored at -20°C. In order to purify recombinant FIX, the concentrated medium was subjected to immunoaffinity chromatography employing the anti-FIX antibody CLB-FIX 14 (5 mg/ml CNBr-Sepharose). After two extensive washing steps with 0.01 M benzamidine, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05 M HEPES (pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.1 M NaCl and 1 M NaCl, respectively, FIX was eluted with 3 M KSCN in the same buffer. FIX-containing fractions were pooled and stored at -20°C in 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 M NaCl, 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4). The specific antigen of the purified recombinant proteins varied between 160 and 200 units/mg. Like plasma-derived FIX (pd-FIX), recombinant wt-FIX displayed full biological activity, whereas the mutants displayed activities of 5% or less compared to wt-FIX and pd-FIX (not shown). Analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis and silver staining revealed one single band for recombinant wt-FIX or mutants thereof, which migrated with a similar Mr as pd-FIX (not shown). This demonstrates that no propeptide-containing, unprocessed FIX was present. Furthermore, in preliminary experiments recombinant FIX proteins proved indistinguishable from pd-FIX with regard to binding to barium citrate and to the Ca2+-dependent anti-FIX antibody CLB-FIX 2 (not shown). These data are in agreement with previous reports that established normal γ-carboxylation in the FIX expression system employed (23Rees D.J.G. Jones I.M. Handford P.A. Walter S.J. Esnouf M.P.

Protein was quantified by the method of Bradford (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar), using HSA as a standard. FVIII activity was assayed employing bovine coagulation factors and a synthetic substrate for FXa in a spectrophotometric assay (Coatest FVIII, Chromogenix AB, Mölndal, Sweden). The amount of FVIII present in 1 ml of human plasma (1 unit/ml) was assumed to correspond to 0.35 nM. FIX biological activity was assessed employing a one-stage clotting assay as described previously (34Veltkamp J.J. Drion E.F. Loeliger E.A. Thromb. Diath. Haemorrh. 1968; 19: 279-303PubMed Google Scholar). FIX antigen was quantified employing a previously described method (12Lenting P.J. ter Maat H. Clijsters P.P.F.M. Donath M.-J.S.H. van Mourik J.A.

Lenting P.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3648-3655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In experiments using various FVIIIa concentrations (0-5.6 nM), FX (0.2 μM) was incubated in 3 mM CaCl2, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.2 mg/ml HSA, 0.05 M Tris (pH 7.4) at 37°C with FIXa (0.05 or 0.25 nM) in the presence of phospholipids (0.1 mM). FVIII was preactivated in the same buffer for 5 min by thrombin (5 nM) prior to the additions. The effect of FX concentration on FXa formation was assessed by incubating various concentrations of FX (0-1 μM) in the same buffer at 37°C with FIXa (30 nM) in the presence of phospholipids (0.1 mM) but in the absence of FVIIIa. FXa formation was quantified employing the chromogenic substrate S-2222 (Chromogenix AB, Mölndal, Sweden). An active site-titrated FXa preparation was used as a reference to convert absorbance values into molar concentrations. Cleavage of CH3SO2-LGR-pNA was assayed as described previously (12Lenting P.J. ter Maat H. Clijsters P.P.F.M. Donath M.-J.S.H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol.

Briefly, 50 μl of a 6 mM solution of CH3SO2-LGR-pNA was added to a 50-μl sample in a microtiter plate (Costar, flat bottom type). Initial rates of substrate hydrolysis were measured by monitoring absorbance at 405 nm in time. Absorbance values were converted into molar concentrations using a molar extinction coefficient of 9.65 x 103M-1 cm-1 for p-nitroanilide (pNA) and a path length of 0.35 cm for a 100-μl volume. Binding of normal or mutant FIXa to the immobilized FVIII light chain and calculation of binding parameters were performed as described elsewhere (10Lenting P.J. Donath M.-J.S.H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of Ca2+ binding to the first EGF-like domain of FIX was investigated using recombinant FIX mutants with various replacements of Asp64. For comparison, pd-FIX and recombinant wt-FIX were employed. First, the mutant FIXa D64K was tested for its reactivity toward the synthetic substrate CH3-SO2-LGR-pNA in the presence of various concentrations of divalent cations (Fig. 1). While some amidolytic activity was observed in the absence of metal ions, the presence of divalent cations markedly augmented the rate of substrate hydrolysis. Experiments employing pd-FIXa demonstrated that Ca2+ and Mg2+ stimulate amidolytic activity by increasing kcat, whereas Km remains unchanged (not shown). The Ca2+ dependence of wt-FIXa was indistinguishable from that of pd-FIXa (Fig. 1A), which suggests that these proteins are similar in Ca2+ binding to sites involved in substrate hydrolysis. In the presence of Ca2+, the mutant FIXa D64K displayed lower activity than wt-FIXa and pd-FIXa (Fig. 1A). When Ca2+ was replaced by Mg2+ the activity of mutant FIXa D64K remained unchanged. However, pd-FIXa and wt-FIXa exhibited reduced activity, which now was indistinguishable from FIXa D64K (Fig. 1B). This demonstrates that replacement of Asp64 by Lys results in reduced amidolytic activity. The same experiments were performed using mutants with other substitutions at position 64: FIXa D64E and FIXa D64V. For both of these mutants, data were obtained (not shown) that are identical to those for FIXa D64K (Fig. 1). Collectively, these data demonstrate that Asp64 is associated with a Ca2+-specific contribution to amidolytic activity. Because in the presence of Ca2+ the reactivity toward the synthetic substrate CH3-SO2-LGR-pNA of FIXa mutants was dissimilar to that of normal FIXa, also the reactivity toward the physiological substrate FX was addressed. Therefore, the rate of FXa formation by normal and mutant FIXa was assessed in the presence of phospholipids, Ca2+ ions, and various concentrations of FX. FXa formation by wt-FIXa was indistinguishable from that by pd-FIXa, with catalytic efficiencies (apparent kcat/Km) of 4.0 and 4.1 x 103M-1 s-1 (Fig. 2). In contrast, the catalytic efficiency of FIXa D64K was 5-fold lower (Fig. 2). Similar experiments using FIXa D64E (data not shown) revealed a catalytic efficiency of 2.0 x 103M-1 s-1. FIXa D64V showed a further reduced FX activation, the kinetics of which were not studied in detail. These data demonstrate that Asp64 is involved in modulating proteolytic activity of FIXa toward FX. The effect of the Asp64 substitutions was further explored in FX activation studies in the presence of various concentrations of the cofactor FVIIIa. As expected, FXa generation by wt-FIXa and pd-FIXa was enhanced in the presence of FVIIIa to the same extent and in a saturable and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3). In contrast, FX activation by FIXa D64K was considerably less enhanced by FVIIIa (Fig. 3). As is listed in Table I, FVIIIa stimulated FX activation by normal FIXa approximately 700-fold, whereas FIXa D64K was stimulated approximately 200-fold. The mutant FIXa D64E displayed the same suboptimal stimulation by FVIIIa (Table I). Apparently, the Asp64 substitutions result in FIXa molecules that display a reduced response to FVIIIa. This raises the possibility that these FIXa mutants are less efficient than normal FIXa in their interaction with FVIIIa.Table IProteolytic activity and FVIII light chain binding by normal and mutant FIXaFactorRelative rate of FX activationFVIII light chain binding, kd-FVIIIa+FVIIIaStimulation factorx 102nMpd-FIXa16.86.815wt-FIXa0.987.17.214FIXa D64K0.250.62.266FIXa D64E0.591.22.155 Open table in a new tab Because both FVIII heavy and light chain regions are involved in complex assembly with FIXa, we addressed the possibility that binding of FIX to one or both of these regions is affected by the Asp64 substitutions. For this purpose, FX activation studies were performed in the presence of the synthetic peptides Lys1804-Lys1818 and Ser558-Gln565. These peptides encompass the primary structure of FIXa interactive sites in the light and heavy chain of FVIII, respectively, and interfere with FX activation in a noncompetitive manner (9Fay P.J. Beattie T. Huggins C.F. Regan L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20522-20527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lenting P.J. van de Loo J.-W.H.P. Donath M.-J.S.H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1935-1940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Indeed, FXa formation catalyzed by wt-FIXa was inhibited by both peptides (Fig. 4A). Peptide Ser558-Gln565 inhibited FXa formation by FIXa D64K or wt-FIXa to the same extent (Fig. 4, A and B). This shows that FIXa D64K and wt-FIXa are similar in their interaction with peptide Ser558-Gln565, suggesting that the interaction between FIXa D64K and this FVIII heavy chain region is unaffected by the Asp64→ Lys mutation. In contrast, FIXa D64K was inhibited by the FVIII light chain peptide Lys1804-Lys1818 2-3-fold less efficiently than wt-FIXa (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting that the Asp64 mutation is associated with abnormal binding to the FVIII light chain. To investigate the effect of the Asp64 mutation on the interaction with the FVIII light chain, equilibrium binding studies were performed employing the immobilized FVIII light chain. The FVIII light chain bound wt-FIXa and pd-FIXa to the same extent, which was illustrated by similar binding parameters for wt-FIXa and pd-FIXa (Fig. 5) (10Lenting P.J. Donath M.-J.S.H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutants FIXa D64K and FIXa D64E were similar to normal FIXa in their interaction with the FVIII light chain with regard to stoichiometry, whereas affinity was 4-5-fold lower (Fig. 5). Apparently, both Asp64 mutants combine a reduced stimulation of FX activation by FVIIIa with a reduced affinity for the FVIII light chain. As Asp64 is part of the high affinity Ca2+ binding site in the first EGF-like domain (22Rao Z. Handford P. Mayhew M. Knott V. Brownlee G.G. Stuart D.

While some binding of FIXa to the FVIII light chain was observed in the absence of metal ions, the presence of metal ions markedly enhanced binding (Fig. 6). The Ca2+ dependence of wt-FIXa was indistinguishable from that of pd-FIXa (Fig. 6A), which suggests that these proteins are similar in Ca2+ binding to sites that contribute to FVIII light chain binding.

Biol. 1995; 15: 272-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting increase in the catalytic activity of p72syk leads to activation of downstream signaling events and ultimately, degranulation. The objective of this study was to determine the binding properties of the FcϵRIγ ITAM to the p72syk dual SH2 domains. We have done this by examining the affinities and kinetics of the binding of FcϵRIγ ITAM-based peptides to the dual and single SH2 domains of p72syk. Previously, binding of ITAM peptides to a variety of SH2 domains has been assessed by a number of different approaches including ELISA-based assays (15Gilmer T. Rodriguez M. Jordan S. Crosby R.

U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3199-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 25Lemmon M.A. Ladbury J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5070-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The ELISA-based assays are generally formatted with ITAM-based peptides immobilized to ELISA plates and the SH2 domains in solution. Surface plasmon resonance determination involves immobilizing the ITAM peptides on sensor chips. An increase in binding of the SH2 domains to the immobilized peptides and the resulting increase in mass is detected by a change in the refractive index of the sensor chip surface (17Ladbury J. Lemmon M. Zhou M. Green J. Botfield M.C. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3199-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Isothermal titration calorimetry involves determining the extent of binding based on the entropy of the binding reaction (25Lemmon M.A. Ladbury J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5070-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, published studies utilizing these techniques have shown considerable variation in the apparent affinities of binding. This variation is a consequence of experimental limitations associated with the assay parameters (17Ladbury J. Lemmon M. Zhou M. Green J. Botfield M.C. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3199-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). For example, as GST fusion proteins dimerize in solution, unless the ligand density on the solid phase is reduced, avidity effects could result in inaccurate determination of Kd values (17Ladbury J. Lemmon M. Zhou M. Green J. Botfield M.C. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3199-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Avidity effects may also account for the apparently long off-rates described in the literature for certain phosphotyrosine-SH2 domain interactions (8Greenlund A.C. Morales M.O. Viviano B.L. Yan H. Krolewski J. Schreiber R.D. Immunity. 1995; 2: 677-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as competition-based assays utilizing both the ELISA and surface plasmon resonance formats are configured with the ITAM peptides immobilized on solid phase and the competing peptides in solution, a true competition equilibrium may not be achieved. Finally ELISA-based binding assays require several washing steps which may compromise the accuracy of Kd determinations. To, therefore, accurately determine the affinities and the binding kinetics of FcϵRIγ ITAM-based peptides to the dual and single SH2 domains of p72syk, a novel scintillation proximity (SPA) based assay system was developed which circumvents the experimental limitations described above. Human p72syk cDNA was initially cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR from the KU812 human mast cell line. Three oligonucleotide primers were then prepared on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer: A, 5ʹ-TCAGTTCTCGAGGAACCACCTGCCCTTCTTTTTCG-3ʹ; B, 5ʹ-TACGTTCTCGAGGTCCCCTATACTAGGTTATTGGAAA-3ʹ; C, 5ʹ-CAGGTAAGATCTCCTTATTTTTGACATGGGACAGTAAGA-3ʹ. Primers A and C were used to amplify a segment of human p72syk cDNA (47Law C.-L. Sidorenko S.P. Chandran K.A. Draves K.E. Chan A.C. Weiss A. Edelhoff S. Disteche C.M. Clark E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12310-12319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) corresponding to amino acid residues 10-261, using standard PCR methodology (48Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Manianis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The PCR fragment was cleaved with XhoI and BglII, and then ligated with the XhoI/BamHI vector fragment of pDW363 (49Tsao K.L. DeBarberi B. Michel H. Waugh D.S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 149: 59-64Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar) to construct p(bio-dual Syk SH2) (pTC1). p(bio-dual GST-Syk SH2) (pTC2) was constructed by amplifying a portion of a previously constructed dual GST-Syk SH2 fusion vector with primers B and C containing the same SH2 domain amino acid residues as stated above, cleaving the PCR product with XhoI and BglII, and then ligating it with the XhoI/BamHI vector backbone of pDW363 (49Tsao K.L. DeBarberi B. Michel H. Waugh D.S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 149: 59-64Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Standard recombinant DNA techniques were employed (48Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Manianis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and the structures of the recombinant plasmids were confirmed by dideoxy nucleotide sequencing (50Sanger F.S. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52669) Google Scholar). The arginine residues 42 and 45 of the N terminus and arginine residue 195 of the C terminus SH2 domains of p72syk were mutated to alanines by two-step PCR mutagenesis. The following PCR primers were used in the reactions: 1, 5ʹ-TACGTTGGATCCTCATCGAAGGTCGTAACCACCTGCCCTTCTTTTTCG-3ʹ; 2, 5ʹ-GCGGCTCTGGGCCAGCAAAT-3ʹ; 3, 5ʹ-ATTTGCTGGCCCAGAGCCGC-3ʹ; 4, 5ʹ-TACCTGGAATTCCTATTTTTGACATGGGACAGTAAGAAC-3ʹ; 5, 5ʹ-ACCCAGGGATCCTCATCGAAGGTCGTAACCACCTGCCCTTCTTTT-3ʹ; 6, 5ʹ-TCCCCCGAATTCCTATTTTTGACATGGGACAGTAAG-3ʹ; 7, 5ʹ-GAGCGCTAACTACCTGGGTGCCTTCGCCCTG-3ʹ; 8, 5ʹ-CAGGGCGAAGGCACCCAGGTAGTTAGCGCTC-3ʹ; 9, 5ʹ-GATCGCAGCCAGGGACAACAACGGCTCCTAC-3ʹ; 10, 5ʹ-GTAGGAGCCGTTGTTGTCCCTGGCTGCGATC-3ʹ (underlined bases indicate the alanine mutations). For the N-terminal Arg-42 mutation, PCR reactions were performed using the dual SH2 domain of p72syk as the template with primers 1 and 2 (product A) and primers 3 and 4 (product B). Aliquots of products A and B were combined in a second PCR reaction with primers 1 and 4. For the N-terminal Arg-45 mutation, PCR reactions were performed using the dual SH2 domains of p72syk as the template with primers 6 and 7 (product A) and primers 5 and 8 (product B). Aliquots of products A and B were combined in a second PCR reaction with primers 5 and 6. For the C-terminal mutation, PCR reactions were performed with primers 6 and 9 (product C) and primers 5 and 10 (product D) using the p72syk dual SH2 domains as the template. Aliquots of products C and D were combined in a second PCR reaction with primers 5 and 6. The second PCR products (mutated p72syk SH2 domain constructs) were purified (Wizard PCR preps, Promega), cleaved with BamHI and EcoRI, purified using low melt agarose followed by Wizard PCR preps, and subcloned into the pGex-3X vector (Pharmacia). The subclones were sequenced to verify inclusion of the desired mutations. Cultures of MC1061 cells (51Wertman K.F. Wyman A.R. Botstein D. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 49: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) containing pTC1 or pTC2 were grown overnight from single colonies at 37°C in LB (48Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Manianis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) supplemented with 50 μM biotin and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The cultures were diluted 10-fold in the same medium, grown to OD600 = 1.0 at 37°C and, after reducing the temperature to 30°C, expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation and the cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1% Triton X-100) (20 ml/liter of original culture media). Lysozyme (20 μg/ml) was added to the cell suspension and the cells were gently shaken for 1 h at 4°C. MgCl2 (final concentration: 20 mM), DNase, and RNase (final concentration: 20 μg/ml) were then added and the cells were incubated for an additional 1 h at 4°C with shaking. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 45 min at 10,000 x g and the proteins were purified from the supernatant as described below. The bio-dual Syk SH2 and bio-dual GST-Syk SH2 proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using Soft-link monomeric avidin resin (Promega) or glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia), respectively, in accordance with the instructions provided by the manufacturers. After elution from the resin, the proteins were dialyzed exhaustively against Tris buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl) then concentrated by diafiltration using an Amicon membrane with a 10-kDa molecular mass cut off. Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically (A280 reading) or by a BCA protein determination kit (Pierce). Non-biotinylated p72syk SH2 domain protein was expressed in E. coli as a GST fusion protein, with a Factor Xa cleavage site directly preceeding the p72syk SH2 domains. The fusion protein was purified (>90% pure) by affinity chromatography on a glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia) column and a fraction was then digested with Factor Xa to release the SH2 domain fragment. The fragment was purified to homogeneity from the Xa-digest. On SDS gels, this protein appeared as a 29-kDa band. The fusion protein was purified (>90% pure) by affinity chromatography on a glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia) column. N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometric analysis indicated that the protein was >95% pure. For some assays, the purified GST fusion protein was biotinylated chemically using either a 5-fold molar excess of sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)-hexanoate (Immunopure-NHS-Lc-biotin, Pierce) or a 10-fold molar excess of Biotin-xx-NHS (Calbiochem) in the presence of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The excess biotin was removed by extensive dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mM dithiothreitol at 4°C. Samples were removed from the cultures before and after induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside, and the cells were pelleted at 10,000 x g. The pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of sample buffer (52Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; XX: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207218) Google Scholar) and heated at 100°C for 4 min. The proteins in the samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 12% pre-cast mini-gel (Bio-Rad). After electrophoresis, the gel was either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or the proteins were electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane using a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot SD device at 100 volts for 1 h. Following transfer, the membrane was treated overnight at 4°C with blocking buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20 and 5% BSA), washed three times with blocking buffer (without BSA), then incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Boehringer Mannheim; 1/2000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing the membrane three times with blocking buffer (without BSA), the streptavidin-reactive proteins were visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham). A peptide (YKSDGVY64(p)TGLSTRNQETY75(p)ETLKHEK-NH2; bold type denotes critical phosphotyrosine residues) corresponding to amino acid residues 59-82 of the human FcϵRIγ chain, which includes the ITAM region with an additional tyrosine residue, was synthesized on a 131 Applied Biosystems instrument. The side chain protections were as follows: Arg(Pmc), Asn(Trt), Asp(OtBu), Gln(Trt), Glu(OtBu), His(Trt), Lys(Boc), Ser(OtBu), and Thr(OtBu). The synthesis was performed on benzhydrylamine resin functionalized with p-[(R,S)-α-[1-(9H-fluoren-9-yl)-methoxyformidol]-2,4-dimethoxybenzyl]phenoxyacetic acid (53Bernatowicz M.S. Daniels S.B. Koster H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1989; 30: 4645-4648Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar) as starting material and Fmoc protection was used for all amino acids. The α-amino Fmoc protection was removed with 20% piperidine in dimethylformamide and acylations were achieved by a preformed hydroxybenzotriazole active ester. After the amino acid synthesis was complete, the resin was transferred to a reaction vessel on a Glass Col bench top shaker and the tyrosines at positions 64 and 75 were phosphorylated using the procedure described by Ki"

The approximate I50 value for the bicyclomycin inhibition of transcription termination at Rho-dependent sites within a modified trp operon template was 5 μM. At antibiotic concentrations near the I50 value, bicyclomycin inhibition of Rho-dependent transcripts was accompanied by the appearance of a new set of transcripts whose size was midway between the Rho-dependent transcripts and the readthrough transcripts. Bicyclomycin did not inhibit poly(C) binding to Rho. In the presence of poly(dC), bicyclomycin showed a reversible mixed inhibition of the ribo(C)10-stimulated ATPase activity. The extrapolated Ki for bicyclomycin was 2.8 μM without ribo(C)10 and increased to 26 μM in the presence of ribo(C)10. Correspondingly, the Km(app) for ribo(C)10 without bicyclomycin was 0.8 μM and with bicyclomycin was 5 μM at infinite inhibitor concentration. The data suggested that the antibiotic binds to Rho, influencing the secondary RNA binding (tracking) site on Rho and slows the tracking of Rho toward the bound RNA polymerase.

The primary site of action for bicyclomycin was shown to be Rho transcription termination factor in E. coli (4Zwiefka A. Kohn H. Widger W.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3564-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 5Park, H.-G., (1995) Studies on the Mechanism of Action and the Structure-Activity Relationship of the Antibiotic Bicyclomycin. Doctoral dissertation, University of Houston.Google Scholar). DNA coding for Rho protein from antibiotic-resistant mutants was able to confer drug resistance to otherwise sensitive cells (4Zwiefka A. Kohn H. Widger W.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3564-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Bicyclomycin has been shown to inhibit Rho-poly(C)-dependent ATPase activity with simple noncompetitive kinetics with respect to ATP (6Park H.-G. Zhang X. Moon H.-S. Zwiefka A. Cox K. Gaskell S.J. Widger W.R. Kohn H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Rho protein is composed of six identical 46-kDa proteins of 419 amino acids (7Finger L.R.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Rho transcription termination factor is required to stop transcription at several Rho-dependent termination sites, including the proximal region of the lacZ cistron (11Richardson J.P. Ruteshouser E.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the λtRI terminator (12Chen C.-Y.A. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11292-11299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the trp tʹ at the end of the tryptophan operon in E. coli (13Wu A.M. Christie G.E. Platt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2913-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).ATPase and helicase activities associated with Rho are essential for transcription termination (14Richardson J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1048: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15Platt T. Richardson J.P. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation.

The ATPase activity is latent until RNA binds to Rho. RNA binding to both a primary and a secondary site is required to stimulate ATPase activity. Reports have proposed a tethered tracking mechanism in which, initially, Rho binds tightly to RNA at a rut site and tracks toward the stalled RNA polymerase using the secondary RNA-binding site (for reviews, see 15Platt T. Richardson J.P. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1992: 365Google Scholar and 16Platt T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). According to this mechanism, RNA binds tightly to the primary site in Rho and remains bound during the Rho transcription termination process, but this binding is not sufficient to stimulate ATPase activity (17Galluppi G.R. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 513-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 18Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5760-5766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNA binding to the secondary or tracking site causes further change in the structure of Rho, which stimulates an ATPase activity (17Galluppi G.R. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 513-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 19Wang Y. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13940-13946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Chem. 1991; 266: 17296-17305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ATP binding domain extends from residues 160 to 340 and contains sequence similarity to E. coli F1 ATPase α and β subunits and adenylate kinase (23Dombroski A.J. Platt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2538-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Mutations at residues 181, 184, and 265 affected ATP hydrolysis without changing RNA binding to the primary site (21Dombroski A.J. Brennan C.A. Spear P. Platt T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18802-18809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At present, little is known about the secondary RNA binding site. The Rho mutant suA1 has been identified as a secondary site mutant with a single amino acid change at residue 352. This finding suggests that this region of the sequence is involved in Rho tracking (29Zheng C. Friedman D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1995; 251: 30-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).A working model of the mechanism of Rho transcription termination relies on the coupling of RNA binding, at both primary and secondary binding sites, to ATP hydrolysis, promoting RNA tracking, helicase activity and eventual transcription termination (14Richardson J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1048: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 31Geiselmann J. Wang Y. Seifried S.E. von Hippel P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Widger W.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3564-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar); however, kinetic studies demonstrated that bicyclomycin was a reversible, simple, noncompetitive inhibitor of Rho with respect to ATP (6Park H.-G. Zhang X. Moon H.-S. Zwiefka A. Cox K. Gaskell S.J. Widger W.R. Kohn H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of bicyclomycin on Rho activities further, in vitro transcription termination assay, poly(C) binding, and poly(dC)-ribo(C)10-stimulated ATPase assays were carried out. We report, herein, that bicyclomycin inhibits in vitro Rho transcription termination processes. Evidence is presented that the antibiotic affects the RNA binding to the secondary site in Rho and modifies the rate of RNA tracking.DISCUSSIONIn vitro Rho-dependent transcription termination reactions were inhibited by bicyclomycin with an I50 value of ∼5 μM (Fig. l). At these concentrations, intermediate-size transcripts midway in length between the Rho-terminated and the read-through transcripts were seen. This observation suggested bicyclomycin interfered with the tracking rate at which Rho binds to RNA at the secondary site and translocates down the mRNA from 5ʹ to 3ʹ toward the stalled RNA polymerase. A slower tracking rate would permit the polymerase to move through the stall site before transcription termination. The continued synthesis of RNA would lead to transcripts of intermediate length provided Rho could catch the polymerase before the end of the template. This kinetic coupling mechanism has been used to explain mutations in the β subunit of RNA polymerase that complement Rho mutations (39Jin D.J. Burgess R. Richardson J. Gross C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1453-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Kinetic complementation was suggested over a direct contact between Rho and the RNA polymerase. The mutation in the β subunit of RNA polymerase slowed down the polymerase rate so that a slowly tracking mutant of Rho could catch up and effectively terminate transcription (39Jin D.J. Burgess R. Richardson J. Gross C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1453-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).The hypothesis that bicyclomycin affects the secondary RNA binding (tracking) site is supported by several additional observations. We found that the percent of poly(C) bound to Rho was not influenced by bicyclomycin. Bicyclomycin (400 μM) sufficient to inhibit 95% of the ATPase activity did not detectably decrease the amount of poly(C) bound to Rho compared with a similar experiment done without bicyclomycin (Fig. 2). A similar result was observed when ATP was included in the reaction. Comparable findings were found for dihydrobicyclomycin. These results suggest that bicyclomycin and dihydrobicyclomycin did not affect RNA binding to the primary RNA binding site. Ligand binding (poly(C), ATP) to Rho has been shown to change the degradation pattern of Rho affecting the rates and appearance of partial digestion bands (24Dolan J.W. Marshall N.F. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5747-5754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Bear D.G. Andrews C.L. Singer J.D. Morgan W.D. Grant R.A. von Hippel P.H. Platt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1911-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The addition of either poly(C) or poly(dC) to the trypsin digestions of Rho led to conformational changes that rendered the protein more susceptible to trypsin, whereas the addition of ATP provided partial protection. We did not observe pronounced changes in the digestion pattern when bicyclomycin was added (Fig. 3) with or without other ligands, signifying that its addition did not affect the primary RNA and ATP binding sites in Rho.Further information concerning the effect of bicyclomycin on Rho function was obtained from kinetic studies. Poly(dC) has been shown to bind only at the primary RNA binding site in Rho, and this binding is not sufficient to stimulate Rho-dependent ATPase activity (17Galluppi G.R. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 513-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 18Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5760-5766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ATPase activity can be restored in Rho-poly(dC) mixtures by the addition of ribo(C) (e.g. 10-mers). These findings indicated that the stimulated ATPase activity resulted from oligoribonucleotide binding to the secondary RNA binding site. The activation of ATPase activity by small oligoribonucleotides provided a direct measure of RNA binding to the tracking site in Rho. Since bicyclomycin or dihydrobicyclomycin inhibition of Rho-dependent transcription termination intimated that the antibiotic affected the tracking rate of Rho toward the polymerase, we determined whether bicyclomycin or dihydrobicyclomycin inhibited ATP hydrolysis in the presence of poly(dC) and ribo(C)10. The kinetics were measured with near saturating amounts of ATP (0.2 mM). We have reported that bicyclomycin or dihydrobicyclomycin inhibits ATP hydrolysis by a simple noncompetitive inhibition pathway with respect to ATP in the presence of poly(C) (6Park H.-G. Zhang X. Moon H.-S. Zwiefka A. Cox K. Gaskell S.J. Widger W.R. Kohn H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This finding allows us to assume that differing ATP concentrations did not affect bicyclomycin binding. We observed that bicyclomycin changed both the Vmax and Km(app) for ribo(C)10, and a mixed inhibition model with respect to ribo(C)10 was used to fit the data. The Km(app) for ribo(C)10 changed from 0.8 to 5 μM as the bicyclomycin concentration was extrapolated from 0 to infinite concentrations. Analysis of the slopes and the intercepts from the double-reciprocal plot (Fig. 4A) indicated that the extrapolated Ki value, the dissociation equilibrium constant for the interaction of bicyclomycin with the free enzyme (Rho plus poly(dC) without ribo(C)10), was 2.8 μM, and the αKi value in the presence of ribo(C)10 was 26 μM.Since bicyclomycin inhibition of ribo(C)10-stimulated ATPase activity followed a mixed inhibition model with respect to ribo(C)10, the affinity of ribo(C)10 binding to the Rho-poly(dC) complex decreased in the presence of bicyclomycin, and the affinity of bicyclomycin to the Rho-poly(dC) complex in turn decreased in the presence of ribo(C)10. This result leads to the conclusion that bicyclomycin affects the RNA tracking rate at the secondary RNA binding site by binding to a probable non-overlapping site, which nonetheless is capable of reciprocal interactions depending on substrate binding. This is consistent with the results of the transcription termination and poly(C) binding experiments.Our findings showed that dihydrobicyclomycin displayed properties similar to bicyclomycin in the transcription termination, Rho-poly(C) binding, and poly(dC)-ribo(C)10-stimulated ATPase assays. These results indicated that bicyclomycin expressed its inhibitory activity in in vitro Rho-mediated processes principally by a noncovalent binding process. This observation is important since bicyclomycin readily reacts with nucleophiles at the C(5Park, H.-G., (1995) Studies on the Mechanism of Action and the Structure-Activity Relationship of the Antibiotic Bicyclomycin. Doctoral dissertation, University of Houston.Google Scholar)-C(5a) exomethylene group to give covalent adducts (40Abuzar S. Kohn H. J. Am. Chem.

Reduction of this structural unit in bicyclomycin to give dihydrobicyclomycin eliminates this pathway. Significantly, our findings do not exclude the possibility that covalent modification plays a role in the in vivo action of bicyclomycin.Recently, several laboratories have demonstrated that Rho-mediated processes were sensitive to bicyclomycin. Transcription termination reactions catalyzed by a Rho isolated from a Gram-positive bacterium Micrococcus luteus were sensitive to bicyclomycin (42Nowatzke W.L. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 742-747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Also, bicyclomycin-resistant mutants were localized to rho and rpoB (4Zwiefka A. Kohn H. Widger W.R.

These findings are consistent with the notion that bicyclomycin slows the tracking rate of Rho from the rut (binding) site toward the stalled RNA polymerase because a reduction in the transcription rates would allow a more slowly moving Rho to catch up to the polymerase and terminate transcription. Our results, however, do not rule out that additional factors (e.g. NusG) (43Yanofsky C. Horn V. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4451-4456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Sullivan S.L. Gottesman M.E.

The primary site of action for bicyclomycin was shown to be Rho transcription termination factor in E. coli (4Zwiefka A. Kohn H. Widger W.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3564-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 5Park, H.-G., (1995) Studies on the Mechanism of Action and the Structure-Activity Relationship of the Antibiotic Bicyclomycin.

Kohn H. Widger W.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3564-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Bicyclomycin has been shown to inhibit Rho-poly(C)-dependent ATPase activity with simple noncompetitive kinetics with respect to ATP (6Park H.-G. Zhang X. Moon H.-S. Zwiefka A. Cox K. Gaskell S.J.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Rho transcription termination factor is required to stop transcription at several Rho-dependent termination sites, including the proximal region of the lacZ cistron (11Richardson J.P. Ruteshouser E.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the λtRI terminator (12Chen C.-Y.A. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11292-11299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the trp tʹ at the end of the tryptophan operon in E. coli (13Wu A.M. Christie G.E. Platt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2913-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).ATPase and helicase activities associated with Rho are essential for transcription termination (14Richardson J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1048: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15Platt T. Richardson J.P. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1992: 365Google Scholar, 16Platt T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity is latent until RNA binds to Rho. RNA binding to both a primary and a secondary site is required to stimulate ATPase activity. Reports have proposed a tethered tracking mechanism in which, initially, Rho binds tightly to RNA at a rut site and tracks toward the stalled RNA polymerase using the secondary RNA-binding site (for reviews, see 15Platt T. Richardson J.P. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1992: 365Google Scholar and 16Platt T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). According to this mechanism, RNA binds tightly to the primary site in Rho and remains bound during the Rho transcription termination process, but this binding is not sufficient to stimulate ATPase activity (17Galluppi G.R.

RNA binding to the secondary or tracking site causes further change in the structure of Rho, which stimulates an ATPase activity (17Galluppi G.R. Richardson J.P. J. Mol.

The Rho mutant suA1 has been identified as a secondary site mutant with a single amino acid change at residue 352. This finding suggests that this region of the sequence is involved in Rho tracking (29Zheng C. Friedman D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W1999511092,"Abstract The capacity of neutrophils to generate superoxide (O2) can be enhanced by prior exposure to “priming” agents such as interleukin-8 (IL-8), melanoma growth-stimulatory activity (MGSA), and neutrophil-activating peptide (ENA-78). The biological effects of these chemokines are mediated by at least two distinct receptors: type A (IL-8-RA) and type B (IL-8-RB). Using neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to IL-8-RA and IL-8-RB, we have investigated the contribution each receptor makes to the priming response. Preincubation with IL-8, MGSA, or ENA-78 enhanced the ability of neutrophils to generate O2 following stimulation with the bacterial peptide formyl-Met-Leu-Phe. The priming effect of IL-8 was eliminated by an anti-IL-8 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that is known to bind IL-8 with high affinity and prevent receptor occupancy. Incubation of neutrophils with a neutralizing mAb specific for IL-8-RA blocked IL-8-induced priming but had no effect on priming by MGSA or ENA-78. In contrast, treatment with a neutralizing mAb specific for IL-8-RB failed to inhibit the priming effect of IL-8 but blocked both MGSA and ENA-78-induced priming. These observations indicate that the priming effect of IL-8 on the neutrophil respiratory burst is predominantly mediated via IL-8-RA, whereas priming by MGSA and ENA-78 is mediated by IL-8-RB."

https://openalex.org/W2027875344,"Pleckstrin, the prototypic protein containing two copies of the pleckstrin homology domain, is a prominent substrate of protein kinase C in platelets and neutrophils. Both cell types have p85 subunit-containing phosphoinositide 3-kinase (p85/PI3K) and non-p85-containing PI3K (PI3Kgamma) that is activated by betagamma subunits of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins. We have shown that a PI3K product, phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3,4,5-trisphosphate, promotes pleckstrin phosphorylation in platelets. Since pleckstrin homology domains are thought to interact with Gbetagamma heterodimers and/or PI(4,5)P2, we have examined the effects of recombinant pleckstrins on platelet PI3Kgamma and p85/PI3K activities. Depending upon its phosphorylation/charged state, pleckstrin inhibits PI3Kgamma, but not p85/PI3K. Pleckstrin-mediated inhibition of PI3Kgamma is overcome by excess Gbetagamma and is restricted to PI(4,5)P2 as substrate, i.e. pleckstrin does not inhibit phosphorylation of PI()P or PI. Consistent with this, activation of protein kinase C by exposure of platelets to beta-phorbol diester (to increase endogenous pleckstrin phosphorylation) prior to platelet lysis causes inhibition of Gbetagamma-stimulatable PI3K activity only with respect to PI(4,5)P2 substrate. This phosphopleckstrin-mediated inhibition is overcome by increasing concentrations of Gbetagamma. We propose that phosphorylation of pleckstrin may constitute an important inhibitory mechanism for PI3Kgamma-mediated cell signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2027307912,"α,ω-Dicarboxylates have antibacterial properties, have been used in the treatment of hyperpigmentary disorders, are active against various melanoma cell lines, and can also undergo β-oxidation. Little, however, is known about their transport. In this paper, we examine the mitochondrial transport of α,ω-dicarboxylates ranging from oxalate (DC2) to sebacate (DC10). DC2-DC10 are transported by the inner membrane anion channel (IMAC). DC6-DC10 are also transported by an electroneutral mechanism that appears to reflect transport of the acid through the lipid bilayer. At 37°C and pH 7.0, DC10 is transported very rapidly at 3 μmol/min·mg, and respiring mitochondria swell in the K+ salts of these acids. This transport mechanism is probably the major pathway by which the longer dicarboxylates enter cells, bacteria, and mitochondria. We also demonstrate that DC5-DC10 can also be transported by an electroneutral mechanism mediated by tributyltin, a potent inhibitor of IMAC. The mechanism appears to involve electroneutral exchange of a TBT-dicarboxylate-H complex for TBT-OH.

At 37°C and pH 7.0, DC10 is transported very rapidly at 3 μmol/min·mg, and respiring mitochondria swell in the K+ salts of these acids. This transport mechanism is probably the major pathway by which the longer dicarboxylates enter cells, bacteria, and mitochondria. We also demonstrate that DC5-DC10 can also be transported by an electroneutral mechanism mediated by tributyltin, a potent inhibitor of IMAC. The mechanism appears to involve electroneutral exchange of a TBT-dicarboxylate-H complex for TBT-OH. Finally, we present evidence that of all the dicarboxylates tested only DC2-DC4 can be transported by the classical dicarboxylate carrier."
https://openalex.org/W2073276199,"To understand how the lipid composition of high density lipoprotein mediates the efflux of cellular cholesterol, we have characterized the effects of variations in the lipid composition of well defined model sonicated apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I)-containing lipoprotein (LpA-I) particle on cholesterol efflux from cultured human skin fibroblasts. LpA-I particles with varying content of phosphatidylcholine (POPC), phosphatidylinositol, sphingomyelin, cholesterol ester, and triolein were prepared by co-sonication. Association of as little as 5 mol of phosphatidylcholine with apoA-I is sufficient to transform lipid-free apoA-I into a distinct lipoprotein-like particle that is a significantly better acceptor of cellular cholesterol. Increasing the ratio of POPC/apoA-I from 5/1 to 35.5/1 in the sonicated LpA-I is associated with a significant increase in the release of cellular cholesterol. At low POPC/apoA-I ratios, native gradient gel electrophoresis of the LpA-I shows these lipoproteins to be small complexes (around 5-6 nm), with only 1 molecule of apoA-I (Lp1A-I). At a POPC/apoA-I ratio above 11/1, LpA-I form well defined complexes that contain 2 molecules of apoA-I (Lp2A-I) and range in size from 7.6 to 7.7 nm. Inclusion of sphingomyelin into an Lp1A-I further stimulates cholesterol efflux significantly. In contrast, inclusion of either sphingomyelin or phosphatidylinositol into a sonicated Lp2A-I has no effect on cholesterol efflux. Incorporation of cholesterol ester and/or triolein into an Lp2A-I particle is associated with a small reduction in cholesterol efflux to these lipoproteins. Therefore, cholesterol efflux from human fibroblasts is directly proportional to the amount and type of phospholipid in a sonicated LpA-I particle. Changes in the conformation and charge of apoA-I that result from changes in the lipid composition of a sonicated LpA-I particle appear to directly affect the ability of the lipoprotein to bind and retain cholesterol molecules. These data therefore suggest that the adsorption/desorption of cholesterol molecules to/from a sonicated LpA-I complex may be less sensitive to interfacial lipid-lipid interactions, but may depend on a conformation-dependent ability of apoA-I to bind cholesterol.

Recent studies have suggested that HDL may also be generated by the stepwise lipidation of apoA-I by acquisition of lipids from other lipoproteins (Hussain et al., 23Hussain M.M. Zanni E.E. Kelly M. Zannis V.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1001: 90-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or from extrahepatic cells (Hara and Yokoyama, 20Hara H. Yokoyama S. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 317-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that HDL may be assembled extracellularly. First, apoA-I, the predominant apolipoprotein of HDL, appears to be secreted by the liver and the intestine mainly in the lipid free form; however, only about 3% of this apolipoprotein is present in plasma as lipid-free form (Neary and Gowland, 38Neary R.H. Gowland E. Clin. Chem. 1987; 33: 1163-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Additionally, lipid-free apoA-I is able to release both phospholipid and cholesterol from extrahepatic cells (Bielicki et al., 7Bielicki J.K. Johnson W.J. Weinberg R.B. Glick J.M. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1699-1709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Hara and Yokoyama, 20Hara H. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3080-3086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the incubation of lipid-free apoA-I with Chinese hamster ovary cells in serum-free medium generates LpA-I with a gradual size increment (Forte et al., 16Forte T.M. Goth-Goldstein R. Nordhausen R.W. McCall M.R. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 317-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A subspecies of small particles (7.3 nm) composed of 94% apoA-I and 6% phospholipids has also been identified in these studies, which appears analogous both in composition and size to the human plasma pre-β-HDL reported earlier (Kunitake et al., 29Kunitake S.T. Lasala K.L. Kane J.P. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 549-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and may be analogous to the particles reported to be highly active in cellular cholesterol efflux (Castro and Fielding, 10Castro G.R. Fielding C.J.

When lipid-free apoA-I is incubated with extrahepatic cells, the incorporation of phospholipids into apoA-I does not seem to parallel that of cholesterol as evidenced by the following. (i) The acquisition of phospholipid and cholesterol by human apoA-I from isolated microsomal membrane (Nunez and Swaney, 40Nunez J.F. Swaney J.B. J. Biol.

Bielicki J.K. Johnson W.J. Lund-Katz S. Palgunachari M.N. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7955-7965Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar); (iii) association of phospholipids with apoHDL greatly increases its ability to release cellular cholesterol compared to the delipidated apoHDL (Stein and Stein, 49Stein O. Stein Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 326: 232-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), while treatment of HDL with either phospholipase A2 or heparin-releasable rat hepatic lipase reduced cholesterol efflux (Johnson et al., 24Johnson W.J. Bamberger M.J. Latta R.A. Rapp P.E. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5766-5776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that the formation of apoA-I-phospholipid complexes is an important preliminary step before apoA-I can significantly promote the efflux of cellular cholesterol. However, there is up to now no direct evidence for a relationship between the progressive lipidation of apoA-I and the ability of the corresponding complexes to release cellular cholesterol in short term incubations, and the corresponding changes in certain physical parameters assumed by the apoA-I-lipid complexes during their progressive lipidation. We have attempted to answer these questions by preparation of model complexes generated in vitro by co-sonication of phospholipid and apolipoprotein as described previously (Hirz and Scanu, 22Hirz R. Scanu A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 207: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar; Sparks et al., 47Sparks D.L. Davidson S.W. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26910-26917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We first prepared a series of reconstituted sonicated LpA-I complexes with varying 1-palmitoyl 2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC)/apoA-I ratios in order to answer the above questions. In addition, two other series of POPC·apoA-I complexes have also been prepared to investigate the contribution of HDL lipid composition, specifically surface phospholipid components, sphingomyelin (SM) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), or core neutral lipids, cholesterol ester (CE) and triolein (TG), to cellular cholesterol efflux. These studies were carried out using reconstituted LpA-I designed to mimic the high affinity acceptor, pre-β1-LpA-I, which has been identified in whole plasma and lymph (Fielding and Fielding, 14Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and to investigate the effect of progressive incorporation of different lipids into apoA-I on its function in cellular cholesterol efflux. POPC, bovine brain SM, and bovine liver PI were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Birmingham, AL). TG, CE, free cholesterol (UC), and essentially fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin were obtained from Sigma. 1-2n-[3H]Cholesterol, L-α[myo-inositol-2-3H]phosphatidylinositol ([3H]PI) and choline-[methyl-14C]sphingomyelin ([14C]SM) with specific activities of 52, 11, and 50 mCi/mmol, respectively, were obtained from Du Pont Canada Inc. (Mississauga, Canada). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum, L-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin used for cell culture were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. All other reagents were analytical grade. HDL was isolated by standard sequential ultracentrifugation from fresh plasma obtained from normolipidemic blood donors (Schumaker and Puppione, 42Schumaker V.N. Puppione D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 155-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). The delipidation of HDL and purification of apoA-I was performed as described previously (Brewer et al., 8Brewer Jr., H.B. Ronan R. Meng M. Bishop C. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A series of POPC·apoA-I complexes were prepared by a method described previously (Sparks et al., 48Sparks D.L. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5151-5157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, POPC in chloroform was dried under nitrogen in glass tubes. 900 μl of reconstitution buffer containing 10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.01% EDTA, 1 mM NaN3 (pH 8.0) was then added to the tubes and vortexed vigorously for 3 min to resuspend the POPC. The mixture was sonicated for 1 min at 100% duty cycle using a Branson 450 sonicator with a one-eighth-inch tapered microtip probe and an output control setting at 3 (manufacturer rated output of 40 watts), then incubated in a water bath at 37°C for 30 min, followed by sonication at 95% duty cycle for 5 min. All sonications were performed in 12 x 75-mm test tubes in a 15°C water bath and under nitrogen. ApoA-I at a concentration of 1.4 mg/ml was added to the tubes, and sonicated again for 4 x 1 min at 90% duty cycle. The resulting mixtures were passed through a 0.22-μm filter, and then reisolated by size exclusion chromatography on a Superose-6 column. For the preparation of sonicated spherical LpA-I with UC, SM, PI, CE, and/or TG, these components were mixed (at appropriate concentrations) with POPC and then processed as described for the POPC·apoA-I complexes. As control and for comparison with other model lipoproteins, reconstituted discoidal LpA-I were prepared in the presence of cholate as described previously by Sparks et al. (44Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25830-25838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from an initial mixture of POPC·apoA-I at a molar ratio of 40/1. Non-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (NDGGE) was carried out on precast gel (8-25%) using the Phast system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to assess the homogeneity of LpA-I, and to estimate their Stoke's diameters calculated from a quadratic equation, derived from polynomial regression of the Stoke's diameters versus the migration distances of five standard proteins (high Mr standard, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) (Nichols et al., 39Nichols A.V. Krauss R.M. Musliner T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 417-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The electrophoretic mobilities and surface potentials of LpA-I were determined by electrophoresis on 0.6% agarose gels (Beckman, Paragon Lipo kit) and calculated as described previously (Sparks and Phillips, 45Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 123-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α-helix content of apoA-I in LpA-I was determined by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy at 222 nm (Sparks et al., 43Sparks D.L. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25839-25847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoA-I number in each reconstituted LpA-I particle was estimated by cross-linking of apolipoproteins with dimethyl suberimidate (Swaney, 52Swaney J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 613-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method (Lowry et al., 32Lowry O.H. Rosebrough M.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and free cholesterol, total cholesterol, and phospholipid concentrations were measured using commercial enzymatic test kits (Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). The PI and SM contents of LpA-I were determined by inclusion in representative preparations of [3H]PI or [14C]SM. Normal human skin fibroblasts were purchased from Clonetics Inc. at the 9th passage, and maintained in a standard condition and used for efflux studies between the 16th and 22th passages. The conditions for seeding and labeling of the cells and for the study of cellular cholesterol efflux were described previously (Zhao and Marcel, 56Zhao Y. Marcel Y.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7174-7180Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Co-sonication of POPC and apoA-I results in well defined POPC·apoA-I complexes, wherein the POPC content can be changed by varying the POPC/apoA-I ratio in the initial mixture. POPC·apoA-I complexes are separated from the lipid-free apoA-I and from the non-incorporated lipid by size exclusion chromatography. As shown in Fig. 1, when the initial molar ratio of POPC/apoA-I is below 20/1, the purified POPC·apoA-I complexes appear as well defined particles on gradient acrylamide gels with sizes at about 5-6 nm. In contrast, large homogeneous LpA-I can be generated with initial POPC/apoA-I molar ratios at and above 20/1. These sonicated LpA-I particles prepared from the initial molar ratios of 20/1, 30/1, and 60/1 have estimated Stoke's diameters on NDGGE of 7.6, 7.6, and 7.7 nm, respectively. The slow migration of the lipid-free apoA-I is an artifact, which is a function of its concentration-dependent aggregation. Chemical cross-linking of the POPC· apoA-I complexes prepared from an initial POPC/apoA-I ratio below 20/1 indicates that only 1 molecule of apoA-I/complex is present, while those formed at 20/1 and above contain 2 molecules of apoA-I/particle. The composition of these sonicated POPC·apoA-I complexes re-isolated by gel filtration is summarized in Table I. The co-sonication of POPC and apoA-I allows the production of POPC·apoA-I complexes with as little as 2.4 mol of POPC/molecule of apoA-I. The lipid/protein ratio of these lipid-poor LpA-I complexes is analogous to that of the pre-β-HDL found in normolipidemic human plasma and the size of the complexes generated at the low ratios of POPC/apoA-I is analogous to that of pre-β-LpA-I (Kunitake et al., 29Kunitake S.T.

Open table in a new tab The molar range of POPC/apoA-I allowing the formation of sonicated LpA-I complexes varies from a few molecules to a maximum of about 36 mol, while 30-133 mol of POPC are needed to form the homogeneous discoidal LpA-I prepared in the presence of cholate (Bergeron et al., 5Bergeron J.

Although the increase in the POPC/apoA-I ratios alters only slightly the sizes of the sonicated POPC·apoA-I complexes as estimated on NDGGE, the secondary structure of apoA-I does change with the progressive increase of POPC in the sonicated complexes, as demonstrated by the modification in α-helical contents and electrophoretic mobilities. This also provides indirect evidence of the association of the phospholipids with apoA-I. The α-helical content increases slightly with addition of 2.4 mol of POPC into apoA-I and continues to increase as more POPC associates with apoA-I (Table I). Upon electrophoresis, POPC·apoA-I complexes prepared by sonication migrate to intermediate positions between pre-β- and α-HDL, which tend to decrease with an increase of POPC/apoA-I ratio (Fig. 2A). The change in the surface charge of these complexes is summarized in Table I. Next to PC, SM and PI are the two major phospholipids associated with HDL. SM is also one of the major phospholipids of nascent LpA-I, including those described as high affinity acceptors for cellular cholesterol (Castro and Fielding, 10Castro G.R. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar; Hara and Yokoyama, 20Hara H. Yokoyama S. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have tested a large range of ratios of SM or PI/POPC in order to mimic the different phospholipid to apoA-I molar ratios found in typical plasma LpA-I. We have observed that SM competes effectively with POPC for association with apoA-I. Typically, starting from a molar ratio of 40:1:4:20 (POPC:apoA-I:UC:SM), we obtained purified Lp2A-I particles with ratios of 14:1:2.1:11.2, as shown in Table II. The presence of SM does not significantly change the particle size (Table II) or electrophoretic mobility of sonicated LpA-I complexes (Fig. 2B). As should be expected, the inclusion of PI in the sonicated complexes significantly increases the electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 2B), which can slightly affects the determination of particle size (Table II). We have also generated a species of SM-containing complexes with a low phospholipid/apoA-I ratio (S9, Table II), which are Lp1A-I particles with a size similar to its POPC/apoA-I counterpart (less than 6 nm, S3, Table I) and an electrophoretic mobility within the pre-β range (Fig. 2B).Table IICharacterization of sonicated LpA-I complexes with sphingomyelin, phosphatidylinositol, or HDL core neutral lipidsLpA-IComposition molar ratioApoA-ISizeSurface Potential(InitialFinal)mol/LpA-Inm-mVVariation in sphingomyelin and phosphatidylinositol (POPC/ApoA-I/UC/SM/PI)S660:1:4:0:029:1:1.8:0:027.79.6S740:1:4:20:014:1:2.1:11.2:027.89.1S850:1:4:0:1024:1:1.5:0:6.127.512.9S910:1:0:10:047:1:0:5.4:018.3Variation in neutral core lipids (POPC/ApoA-I/UC/CE/TG)S1060:1:3:6:046:1:1.2:2.9:027.89.3S1160:1:3:0:638:1:1.3:0:6.427.710.1S1260:1:3:6:643:1:1.2:2.6:6.527.6510.2 Open table in a new tab Four subspecies of sonicated LpA-I containing CE and/or TG were made as indicated in Table II. Three moles of UC, 6 mol of CE, and/or 6 mol of TG were added to POPC·apoA-I mixtures with an initial molar ratio of 60/1, a ratio that we have shown to generate homogeneous LpA-I particles. Compared to the LpA-I particles containing only POPC and apoA-I, the presence of UC, CE, and/or TG did not affect the homogeneity of these sonicated LpA-I particles as demonstrated by NDGGE. The presence of UC slightly reduced the level of POPC that could be incorporated into apoA-I; however, at the molar ratios used here, the presence of TG and especially that of CE appeared to increase POPC incorporation into LpA-I. TG and CE alone could be very efficiently incorporated into LpA-I, with TG having an incorporation efficiency close to 100%. In addition, the presence of CE did not modify either the size of LpA-I particles (Table II), or their electrophoretic mobility on agarose gel (Fig. 2B). The presence of TG alone or TG and CE together did not alter the size of these particles (Table II); however, their electrophoretic mobility was slightly increased with both CE and TG (Fig. 2B). In contrast to Lp2A-I prepared in the presence of cholate (discoidal LpA-I), where variations in POPC content have no effect on the ability of these lipoproteins to accept cholesterol, 2Y. Zhao, D. L. Sparks, and Y. L. Marcel, unpublished data. an increase in the POPC content of sonicated POPC·apoA-I complexes significantly enhanced their ability to promote the efflux of cellular cholesterol (Fig. 3). Within the first 90 min of incubation, the efflux followed the biphasic pattern usually observed with fibroblasts (Zhao and Marcel, 56Zhao Y. Marcel Y.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7174-7180Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The stimulating effect of the phospholipid content of the LpA-I complexes could also be observed in both phases. The second phase of cellular cholesterol efflux to these sonicated LpA-I complexes was linear and positively related to the phospholipid levels incorporated into LpA-I. No saturation was observed up to 90 min of incubation. Cellular cholesterol efflux is very sensitive to the association of phospholipid with apoA-I, as demonstrated by the significant increase in efflux observed with as few as 2.4 mol of POPC/mol of apoA-I compared to lipid free apoA-I (results not shown). The efflux of cholesterol from fibroblasts to S2 or S4 was concentration-dependent up to 100 μg of apoA-I/ml, where both particles were close to saturation (Fig. 4). Again, the LpA-I complex containing more POPC showed higher ability to accept cell-derived cholesterol at all concentrations tested. The calculated Vmax values are 16.9 and 12.6 μg/ml, respectively, for S2 and S4. At all concentrations tested, lipid free apoA-I was not efficient in promoting cholesterol efflux compared to the lipidated apoA-I.Fig. 4Effect of POPC content on concentration-dependent cellular cholesterol efflux to POPC·apoA-I complexes. Human skin fibroblasts were seeded and labeled as described in Fig. 3. For the efflux study, the washed cells were incubated with DMEM containing increasing protein concentration of sonicated lipid-free apoA-I, or POPC·apoA-I complexes at the final POPC/apoA-I molar ratio of 5/1 or 16.2/1 (S2 and S4, respectively). Aliquots of medium were taken at 90 min of incubation for radioactivity determination. Efflux is expressed as medium radioactivity/μg of cell protein (n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To compare the abilities of sonicated LpA-I and discoidal LpA-I (prepared by cholate dispersion) to accept cellular cholesterol from cultured human skin fibroblasts, discoidal Lp2"
https://openalex.org/W2007421035,"The human D1A dopamine receptor gene has a GC-rich, TATA-less promoter located upstream of a small, noncoding exon 1, which is separated from the coding exon 2 by a 116-base pair (bp)-long intron. Serial 3ʹ-deletions of the 5ʹ-noncoding region of this gene, including the intron and 5ʹ-end of exon 2, resulted in 80 and 40% decrease in transcriptional activity of the upstream promoter in two D1A-expressing neuroblastoma cell lines, SK-N-MC and NS20Y, respectively. To investigate the function of this region, the intron and 245 bp at the 5ʹ-end of exon 2 were investigated. Transient expression analyses using various chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs showed that the transcriptional activity of the intron is higher than that of the upstream promoter by 12-fold in SK-N-MC cells and by 5.5-fold in NS20Y cells in an orientation-dependent manner, indicating that the D1A intron is a strong promoter. Primer extension and ribonuclease protection assays revealed that transcription driven by the intron promoter is initiated at the junction of intron and exon 2 and at a cluster of nucleotides located 50 bp downstream from this junction. The same transcription start sites are utilized by the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs employed in transfections as well as by the D1A gene expressed within the human caudate. The relative abundance of D1A transcripts originating from the upstream promoter compared with those transcribed from the intron promoter is 1.5-2.9 times in SK-N-MC cells and 2 times in the human caudate. Transcript stability studies in SK-N-MC cells revealed that longer D1A mRNA molecules containing exon 1 are degraded 1.8 times faster than shorter transcripts lacking exon 1. Although gel mobility shift assay could not detect DNA-protein interaction at the D1A intron, competitive co-transfection using the intron as competitor confirmed the presence of trans-acting factors at the intron. These data taken together indicate that the human D1A gene has two functional TATA-less promoters, both in D1A expressing cultured neuroblastoma cells and in the human striatum.

Dopamine mediates important brain functions including the generation of coordinated motor output, neuroendocrine modulation, behavior, memory, and cognition (1Creese, I., Fraser, C.

Science. 1991; 251: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). The receptors subserving the dopamine signaling pathways belong to the large family of seven-transmembrane, G-protein-coupled receptors (3Kebabian J.W. Calne D.B. Nature. 1979; 277: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (3149) Google Scholar). Five of these dopamine receptor genes have thus far been identified and classified into two main subfamilies: the D1 class, which includes the D1A and D1B (D5) receptors, and the D2 class, which includes D2, D3, and D4 receptors.

Nature. 1990; 347: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Based largely on clinical pharmacologic observations in Parkinsonian and schizophrenic patients, the D2 dopamine receptor has traditionally been thought to be the main mediator of the motor and behavioral effects of dopamine (12Lee T. Seeman P. Rajput A. Farly I.J. Hornykiewicz O. Nature. 1978; 273: 59-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 13Seeman P. Ulpian C. Bergeron C. Riederer P. Jellinger K. Gabriel E. Reynolds G.P. Tourtellotte W.W. Science. 1984; 225: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). More recent molecular and neurophysiologic advances in addition to the availability of receptor-selective pharmacologic agents have clarified the importance of the D1 class of dopamine receptors as well (14Chipkin R.E.

Life Sci. 1991; 49: 1505-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The D1A receptor is one of two dopamine receptors abundantly expressed in the striatum (16Boyson S.J. McGonigle P. Molinoff P.B. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 3177-3188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that it has a critical role in transmitting the nigrostriatal dopaminergic signal resulting in normal motor function. In the prefrontal cortex, the D1A receptor is more abundantly expressed than the D2 receptor (17Lidow M.S. Goldman-Rakic P.S. Gallager D.W. Rakic P. Neuroscience. 1991; 40: 657-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) and has recently been shown to modulate memory (18Williams G.V. Goldman-Rakic P.S. Nature. 1995; 376: 572-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). Information about the molecular regulation of this receptor would help us understand how it could be modified by disease states and by pharmacologic manipulations. To study transcription control of the human D1A dopamine receptor gene, we had previously cloned and characterized its 5ʹ-flanking region and analyzed its main activator (19Minowa M.T. Minowa T. Monsma Jr., F.J. Sibley D.R. Mouradian M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3045-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20Minowa M.T. Minowa T. Mouradian M.M. J. Biol.

We found that this gene has a short noncoding exon 1 of about 450 bp, 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)CATchloramphenicol acetyltransferase; RPA: ribonuclease protection assayPCRpolymerase chain reactionPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. a 116-bp intron, and a long coding exon 2 (see Fig. 1). Thus, the 5ʹ-noncoding region of the D1A gene is about 920 bp long. In the present investigation, we discovered that in addition to its original TATA-less promoter upstream of exon 1, this gene is also transcribed from a second strong promoter located in its intron, generating shorter transcripts lacking exon 1. base pair(s) chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; RPA: ribonuclease protection assay polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Plasmids pCAT-D1-1102/-525 and pCAT-D1-1102/-708 were constructed from pCAT-D1-1102 (20Minowa M.T. Minowa T. Mouradian M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23544-23551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by deleting the respective fragments using appropriate restriction enzymes and religation (Fig. 2). The human D1A upstream promoter region (D1Pro, bases -1102 to -963 relative to the first ATG) was generated by PCR using pCAT-D1-1102 as template with sense primer PP-1, 5ʹ-CCCCAdIII site underlined), and antisense primer PP-2, 5ʹ-AAAGGCTCTCGGGCGGCCTTCAGCCCT-3ʹ (inserted PstI site underlined). The resultant fragment was digested with HindIII and PstI and inserted into the corresponding sites of pCAT-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI) (yielding pCAT-D1Pro) and of pCAT-Enhancer (Promega) (yielding pCAT-SVEnh-D1Pro). A similar strategy was employed to subclone the intron (nucleotides -599 to -484) between the PstI-XbaI sites of the same two vectors generating pCAT-D1Int(+) and pCAT-SVEnh-D1Int(+). Blunt end ligation of the intron at the same restriction sites in the opposite orientation yielded pCAT-D1Int(-) and pCAT-SVEnh-D1Int(-), respectively. The 5ʹ-end of exon 2 (termed Ex, -484 to -239) as well as the intron combined with this segment of exon 2 (termed All, -599 to -239) were subcloned 3ʹ to the D1A upstream promoter in pCAT-D1Pro to yield pCAT-D1Pro-Ex and pCAT-D1Pro-All, respectively. To construct pCAT-D1Int-D1Pro, which has the reverse order of the intron and the D1A upstream promoter both in the 5ʹ→ 3ʹ orientation, we blunt end-ligated the HindIII-PstI fragment from pCAT-D1Pro into the XbaI site of pCAT-D1Int(+). To generate a riboprobe that excludes intron 1 (Fig. 1), plasmid pGEM-E1E2 was constructed. Reverse transcription-PCR was performed using total RNA from the human neuroblastoma SK-N-MC cells. The cDNA was synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus RNase H- reverse transcriptase (Superscript II RNase H- RT; Life Technologies, Inc.) and primer RT1-0 (-348 to -329, 5ʹ-TCCTGGGCCTCTGCTCTGCT-3ʹ). The RT reaction product was amplified using Taq DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) with sense primer RT1-1 (-647 to -628 in exon 1, 5ʹ-AAYGTCCACATTCCAAGCTCCAG-3ʹ, inserted PstI site underlined) and antisense primer RT1-2 (-353 to -334 in exon 2, 5ʹ-GCAGGCCTCTGCTCTGCTAGTCA-3ʹ, inserted XbaI site underlined). The PCR product was digested with PstI and XbaI and inserted into the corresponding sites of pGEM-3Zf(-) (Promega). To determine transcription start sites driven by the D1A gene intron in the CAT constructs, pCAT-D1IntE was generated and used in transfection experiments. This was constructed by inserting the 130-bp PstI-BsoFI fragment (bases -599 to -470) from pCAT-D1Pro-All into the PstI-SalI sites of pCAT-Basic. To generate a riboprobe for RPA with CAT RNA from transfected cells, pGEM-D1IntE was constructed by inserting the 390-bp PstI-EcoRI fragment from pCAT-D1IntE into the corresponding sites of pGEM-3Zf(-). For competitive co-transfection assays, pZero-D1Int was constructed by deleting the CAT gene from pCAT-D1Int(+) using EcoRI digestion and religation. The negative control competitor plasmid pZero was constructed similarly by deleting the CAT gene from pCAT-Basic. Oligonucleotides for the trans-activation region (termed AR1, nucleotides -1154 to -1136) (20Minowa M.T. Minowa T. Mouradian M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23544-23551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems model 394 DNA synthesizer. After annealing, the double-stranded oligonucleotide was subcloned 5ʹ to the D1A upstream promoter in pCAT-D1Pro to yield pCAT-D1Pro-AR1 and 5ʹ of the intron promoter in pCAT-D1Int(+) to give pCAT-D1Int-AR1. The integrity of all CAT constructs was verified by restriction analysis and partial sequencing performed by the Sanger dideoxynucleotide chain termination method with Sequenase (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) using 7-deaza-dGTP (21Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar). The human neuroblastoma SK-N-MC and human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cell lines were obtained from ATCC, and the murine neuroblastoma cell line NS20Y was a kind gift from Dr. Marshall Nirenberg (NHLBI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). SK-N-MC cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (CELLect GOLD, ICN Flow, Irvine, CA), 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 1 x minimal essential medium nonessential amino acids (both from Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2. NS20Y and HepG2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (CELLect GOLD, ICN Flow). Transfections were carried out using the CaPO4 co-precipitation method (22Graham F.L. Van Der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar) using equal amounts of the test pCAT plasmid and pRASβ-GAL (23Umesono K. Evans R.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 1139-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar): 5 μg each for NS20Y and SK-N-MC cells and 10 μg each for HepG2 cells per 100-mm culture dish. For competitive co-transfections, SK-N-MC cells were co-transfected with 3 μg of pCAT-D1Int(+), 2 μg of pCMVβ-GAL (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA), and 8 or 16 μg of the competitor plasmid pZero-D1Int (molar ratio to the test pCAT plasmid 1:4 and 1:8, respectively) supplemented with pZero to make up a total of 21 μg of DNA/plate. All plasmids used in transfections were purified by Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, CA). Lysates were prepared by four cycles of freezing and thawing of the harvested cells followed by centrifugation. CAT assays were carried out using the CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Boehringer Mannheim). All CAT assay results were normalized to β-galactosidase activity (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from SK-N-MC cells using RNAzol B (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX), and primer extension was carried out using the Primer Extension System (Promega). An oligodeoxynucleotide complementary to nucleotides -413 to -384 in exon 2 (5ʹ-TCTGGTGGTGACAGGAGATTCTCCCCTTCT-3ʹ) (Fig. 1) was 5ʹ-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Thirty-one μg of total RNA from SK-N-MC cells and 0.1 pmol of labeled primer were mixed in the presence of 2 x primer extension buffer and annealed at 85°C for 10 min followed by cooling to room temperature for 10 min. The annealed primer was extended with avian myeloblastoma virus reverse transcriptase at 42°C for 30 min and ethanol-precipitated. The sample was resuspended in 5 μl of gel loading dye, separated in a denaturing 8 M urea, 6% polyacrylamide gel. RPA was performed with the RPA II ribonuclease protection assay kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Constructs pGEM-E1E2 and pGEM-D1IntE were linearized at the 5ʹ-end of the insert with HindIII and transcribed in vitro from the T7 promoter to generate [α-32P]CTP-labeled antisense RNA probes. Approximately 80 μg of total RNA from nontransfected SK-N-MC cells and from pCAT-D1IntE-transfected SK-N-MC and NS20Y cells were precipitated with about 1 x 105 cpm of the appropriate probe and resuspended in 20 μl of hybridization buffer. Samples were denatured at 90°C for 4 min and incubated at 42°C for 20 h. Following hybridization, 200 μl of RNA digestion buffer containing RNase A and RNase T1 were added, and the samples were incubated at 37°C for 30 min. RNA was subsequently precipitated, resuspended in 5 μl of gel-loading buffer, and separated in a denaturing 8 M urea, 6% polyacrylamide gel. The relative densities of the protected bands were measured using a PhosphorImager model 445SI (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA), or the autoradiogram was subjected to densitometric analysis using a CCD Video Camera (model XC-77, Sony) and NIH Image. Nuclear extracts from SK-N-MC and NS20Y cells were prepared using a modification of Dignam's procedure (25Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar, 26Hennighausen L. Lubon H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 721-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). DNA probes, D1Int, Ex, and All (Fig. 1) were generated by PCR using 32P-labeled primers for one end and cold primers for the other end using pCATD1-1102 as template. All probes were purified by PAGE. DNA-protein binding reactions for gel mobility shift assays were carried out with 5 μg of nuclear extract from SK-N-MC cells or 3 μg from NS20Y cells and about 5 fmol (>50,000 cpm) of probe in the presence of 12% glycerol, 12 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.9), 60 mM KCl, 120 μM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Boehringer Mannheim) in 25 μl. Products of the binding reactions were resolved in 1 x Tris/glycine buffer, 4% polyacrylamide (30:1) nondenaturing gel (27Ausubel F.M. Bernt R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1989: 12.2.1Google Scholar). SK-N-MC cells were treated with actinomycin D (10 μg/ml; Sigma) in fresh medium for various durations. At the end of each treatment period, cells were harvested, and total RNA was extracted and processed for RPA as described above. The relative densities of the protected bands were measured using a PhosphorImager model 445SI (Molecular Dynamics). Serial 3ʹ deletions of the 5ʹ-noncoding region of the human D1A dopamine receptor gene, including the intron and 5ʹ-end of exon 2, resulted in a dramatic decrease in transcriptional activity of the reporter gene in two D1A-expressing neuroblastoma cell lines, SK-N-MC and NS20Y (Fig. 2). Approximately 80% of CAT activity was lost by removing the region between nucleotides -525 and -239 in SK-N-MC cells and about 40% in NS20Y cells. In the negative control cell line HepG2, where the D1A gene is transcriptionally silent, a modest increase was seen, which remained functionally insignificant. To investigate the role of this important regulatory region of the D1A gene, the intron (D1Int) and 245 bp at the 5ʹ-end of exon 2 (Ex) were analyzed in detail. The possibility that this transcriptionally active fragment within the 5ʹ-noncoding region of the D1A gene functions as an activator of the core promoter located upstream of exon 1 was addressed first. D1Int, Ex, and these two regions combined were subcloned 3ʹ to the D1A upstream promoter in pCAT-Basic in the absence of exon 1 (Fig. 2). Compared with pCAT-D1Pro, which includes the upstream promoter alone, pCAT-D1Pro-D1Int was 7- and 5.3-fold more active in SK-N-MC and NS20Y cells, respectively. On the other hand, pCAT-D1Pro-Ex was only 2.8 times more active in SK-N-MC cells and not different than pCAT-D1Pro in NS20Y cells. However, the combination of the intron and 5ʹ-end of exon 2 (pCAT-D1Pro-All) was 18.5- and 5.6-fold stronger than the D1A upstream promoter alone in the same respective cells. Thus, these experiments localized strong transcriptional activity within the D1A intron in both D1A-expressing cell lines (Fig. 2). We also tested if the intron and 5ʹ-end of exon 2 could enhance a viral promoter by subcloning them downstream of the SV40 promoter in both orientations in pCAT promoter. However, no biologically relevant increase in CAT activity was observed in NS20Y cells (data not shown), suggesting that this region of the D1A gene could not activate a heterologous promoter. Analysis of pCAT-D1Pro in the three cell types showed that the D1A upstream promoter alone loses its cell type specificity in the absence of downstream sequences (Fig. 2). The distinct localization of a transcription stimulator in the D1A intron raised the possibility that this region could function as an independent promoter. To confirm this hypothesis, additional CAT constructs were made by inserting the D1A intron in both orientations into pCAT-Basic and pCAT-Enhancer both lacking any promoter sequences (Fig. 2). A marked increase in CAT activity with constructs having the intron in the original orientation was detected in all three cell types tested, indicating that the intron harbors strong promoter activity. Compared with the D1A upstream promoter (pCAT-D1Pro), the intron (pCAT-D1Int(+)) was 12- and 5.5-fold more active in SK-N-MC and NS20Y cells, respectively. On the other hand, subcloning the intron in the 3ʹ→ 5ʹ orientation resulted in dramatic loss of most its transcriptional activity in all three cell types. Evaluation of constructs that included both the intron and the upstream promoter simultaneously in different orders showed that the transcriptional activity of pCAT-D1Pro-D1Int was weaker than that of pCAT-D1Int-D1Pro (Fig. 2). Transcription start sites driven by the intron promoter were determined by primer extension analysis and by RPA. For primer extension, an oligonucleotide primer located in exon 2 was 5ʹ-end-labeled, hybridized with total RNA from SK-N-MC cells, and extended by avian myeloblastoma virus reverse transcriptase. Multiple transcription initiation sites were identified using this method, a prominent one being at the junction of intron and exon 2 (Fig. 3). Another small cluster of transcription start sites located about 50 bp downstream into exon 2 was also seen on the autoradiogram (data not shown). To verify the data obtained from primer extension, RPA was performed. 32P-Labeled antisense RNA, transcribed from pGEM-E1E2 lacking the intron sequence, was hybridized with total RNA from SK-N-MC, HepG2, and yeast cells and digested with RNase A and T1. A fragment protected by SK-N-MC mRNA was detected at the junction of exon 1 and exon 2 (Fig. 4). Three additional bands clustered approximately 50 bp downstream of the junction of exon 1 and exon 2 in the riboprobe were protected by mRNA from this D1A-expressing cell line (Fig. 4). The positions of these bands were identical to those obtained with primer extension. Transcription initiation by the upstream D1A promoter was also detected by RPA (Fig. 4). No protected band was seen by either HepG2 or yeast RNA (Fig. 4A). The relative abundance of transcripts originating from the two D1A promoters was estimated by quantitating the densities of bands indicated by arrows in Fig. 4, A and B, using a PhosphorImager as well as densitometric analysis of autoradiograms. In SK-N-MC cells, the ratio between transcripts starting from the upstream promoter and those originating from the intron promoter was between 2.9 ± 0.3 (Fig. 4A) and 1.5 ± 0.3 (Fig. 4B). To prove that transcription initiation from the intron promoter of the D1A gene is also utilized in vivo, RPA was carried out with RNA isolated from the human brain (Fig. 5). 32P-Labeled antisense RNA probe, transcribed from pGEM-E1E2, was hybridized with total RNA from a human caudate tissue and digested with RNase A and T1. A parallel experiment using RNA from SK-N-MC cells was carried out as control. Both lanes showed a protected fragment of 150 bp corresponding to the junction of exon 1 and exon 2 and another protected band at approximately 50 bp downstream (Fig. 5). Similar to the analysis in SK-N-MC cells (Fig. 4), quantitation of the relative abundance of D1A messages in the human caudate revealed that long transcripts containing exon 1 are 2.0 ± 0.2 times more prevalent than shorter transcripts lacking exon 1. Thus, steady-state levels of D1A messages transcribed from the two promoters appear to be equivalent in a cultured neuroblastoma cell line and in vivo. Accurate initiation of transcription from the intron promoter was also confirmed in CAT construct-transfected cells. For transient transfection of SK-N-MC and NS20Y cells (Fig. 6), the 131-bp PstI-BsoFI fragment (from pCAT-D1Pro-All) that includes the entire intron and 15 bases from exon 2 was inserted upstream of the CAT gene in pCAT-Basic to yield pCAT-D1IntE. To generate antisense RNA probe, the 390-bp PstI-EcoRI fragments from pCAT-D1IntE, which includes the D1A intron, 15 bases of exon 2, and 259 bases from the CAT gene, was inserted into the corresponding sites of pGEM-3Zf(-) to yield pGEM-D1IntE. After transfecting SK-N-MC and NS20Y cells with pCAT-D1IntE, RNA was isolated and hybridized with 32P-labeled antisense RNA probe, transcribed from pGEM-D1IntE, and digested with RNase A and T1. These experiments indicated that the positions of transcription initiation sites utilized by the fusion construct corresponded to the same major start sites identified in RNA extracted from nontransfected SK-N-MC cells, namely the junction of D1A exons 1 and 2 in the riboprobe as well as a cluster located 50 bp downstream (Fig. 6). The presence of trans-acting factors interacting with the intron promoter was first addressed by gel mobility shift assays using nuclear extracts from SK-N-MC and NS20Y cells with PCR-generated DNA probes, D1Int, Ex, and All (Fig. 7). However, no detectable retarded band could be seen with a probe spanning the D1A intron using this method. On the other hand, using probes having the 5ʹ-end of exon 2, probes Ex and All, two major retarded bands were seen with nuclear extracts from both cell lines, and the respective unlabeled DNA fragments could effectively compete away all these retarded bands. The difference in the gel shift pattern between the two cell lines points to their different molecular profiles, although both have an adequate transcription machinery to express the D1A gene. Other differences between these two cell lines were also noted in transient transfection assays (Fig. 2). To further investigate the presence of trans-acting factors at the intron promoter, competitive co-transfection assay was employed as an indirect evidence for functional DNA-protein interaction. SK-N-MC cells were co-transfected with pCAT-D1Int(+) and the competitor plasmid pZero-D1Int, harboring the intron in an otherwise null vector. Only a 4-fold excess of the competitor plasmid compared with the test pCAT plasmid reduced transcriptional activity of the intron promoter by about 30%, and an 8-fold excess competitor reduced this activity by about 60% (p < 0.006) (Fig. 8). We had previously found that the sequence between -1154 and -1136 (termed AR1) functions as a transcriptional activator for the human D1A dopamine receptor gene (20Minowa M.T. Minowa T. Mouradian M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23544-23551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether AR1 activates the upstream D1A promoter or the downstream intron promoter, pCAT-D1Pro-AR1 and pCAT-D1Int-AR1 were constructed (Fig. 9A). Compared with the D1A upstream promoter alone, pCAT-D1Pro-AR1 was 2.9- and 2.5-fold more active in NS20Y and SK-N-MC cells, respectively (Fig. 9B). On the other hand, pCAT-D1Int-AR1 was less active in both cell types compared with the intron promoter alone (Fig. 9C). Thus, AR1 activates the upstream promoter and tends to repress the intron promoter of the human D1A dopamine receptor gene. The half-lives of mRNA transcribed from each promoter of the human D1A dopamine receptor gene were measured by RPA using RNA from SK-N-MC cells treated with the RNA polymerase inhibitor actinomycin D for various time points (Fig. 10). Transcripts originating from the upstream D1A promoter decayed with a half-life of 1 h, whereas mRNA starting from the intron promoter degraded with a half-life of 1.8 h. The D1A dopamine receptor gene consists of two exons, an upstream noncoding exon 1 of about 450 bp and a longer exon 2 where the entire receptor protein is encoded (Fig. 1). These two exons are separated by a small intron of 116 bp in humans (19Minowa M.T. Minowa T. Monsma Jr., F.J. Sibley D.R. Mouradian M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2035881249,"Abstract Since secretagogues have been shown to increase the internalization of surfactant phospholipid and protein by lung cells, we postulated that their action occurred through a mechanism involving increased surfactant protein A (SP-A) receptor density. Therefore, we evaluated the influence of secretagogues on the binding of iodinated SP-A to alveolar type II cells. Type II cells were isolated from rat lung and maintained in primary culture for 18 h on Transwell membranes. Upon exposure to 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (cAMP, 0.1 mM), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 10 nM), terbutaline (0.1 mM), or ATP (1 mM), the binding of SP-A increased 1.5-2-fold. This stimulation was cell substrate-dependent since type II cells plated on plastic dishes did not show this effect. A time course of the stimulation of SP-A binding due to secretagogues showed that both cAMP and PMA increased SP-A binding by 2-fold after 20 min. With cAMP, binding remained elevated for 2 h, while binding in the presence of PMA had returned to control values. The effects of submaximal concentrations of cAMP and PMA on binding were additive. Inhibition of cellular protein synthesis with cycloheximide did not alter the increase of SP-A binding stimulated by the secretagogues. Type II cells pretreated with PMA responded to subsequent treatment with cAMP by increasing SP-A binding, while these cells were refractory to subsequent treatment with PMA. Both constitutive and regulated binding of SP-A to type II cells were sensitive to trypsin. The binding of SP-A to type II cells showed saturation at a concentration of 1 μg/ml SP-A under control and secretagogue-stimulated conditions, with both total and calcium-dependent binding showing a 2-fold increase upon secretagogue exposure. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that secretagogues stimulate surfactant uptake, at least in part, through recruitment of SP-A receptors to the type II cell surface, resulting in an increase in the number of SP-A binding sites."

Most viable mutants showed growth characteristics that were comparable to wild type.

However, both mutant enzymes displayed near-normal kinetics for ATP hydrolysis in vitro. Localized random mutagenesis was also performed at sites Glu195, Val196, and Ile210, which all showed lethal phenotypes upon conversion to alanine. Amino acids with polar side groups could substitute for Glu195, while Val196 could not tolerate polar side group moieties.

The plasma membrane H+-ATPase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an electrogenic proton pump that couples ATP hydrolysis to proton transport. It plays important roles in both intracellular pH regulation and the maintenance of a large electrochemical proton gradient necessary for nutrient uptake. The H+-ATPase is a member of the P-type family of ion translocating enzymes, and it belongs to the P2-subclass (P2-ATPase) of enzymes that are involved in the transport of non-heavy metals (1Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The H+-ATPase is comprised of a membrane transport domain, which is believed to consist of 10 transmembrane segments, and a large catalytic ATP hydrolysis and transduction domain. Typical of P-type ATPases, the H+-ATPase couples energy from the cytoplasmic ATP hydrolysis domain to the membrane-embedded proton transport domain. The structural basis for this coupling is poorly defined, but it is believed that long range interactions are essential to this process (2Inesi G. Kirtley M.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 271-283PubMed Google Scholar). Clues to the nature of long range conformational interactions underlying coupling have come from a variety of experimental approaches, including drug interaction (3Lingrel J.B Kuntzweiler T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 11792-11797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these studies, a consensus structural model for coupling has not yet been elucidated. There is emerging evidence that transmembrane segments 5 and 6, and perhaps 4 and 8, may participate in the transport of ions across the bilayer (1Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 3Lingrel J.B Kuntzweiler T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 15931-15936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). How these segments are organized with the remaining transmembrane segments to participate in ion transport is not known. It is also not clear whether coupling involves a direct interaction of protein structure elements extending from transmembrane segments 5 and 6 into the central catalytic region or whether indirect interactions, involving other cytoplasmic and membrane-associated protein structure elements, are important. In the yeast H+-ATPase, mutations in the first two transmembrane segments (M1 and M2) and the central catalytic region appear to alter the electrogenic character of the enzyme (11Seto-Young D.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23988-23995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic evidence suggesting an indirect interaction between M1 and M2 and the central catalytic domain was obtained from suppressor studies, in which the phenotype produced by a primary site mutation in one sector was overcome by a secondary site mutation in the other (8Harris S.L. Perlin D.S. Seto-Young D. Haber J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24439-24445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Na S. Perlin D.S. Seto-Young D. Wang G. Haber J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11792-11797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies suggest that interactions between M1 and M2 and the catalytic region are important for normal ATP-linked electrogenic proton transport. A likely candidate to mediate these long range interactions is the cytoplasmic loop domain (LOOP1) linking M2 and M3. The LOOP1 region was originally postulated to act as a transduction domain (14MacLennan D.H. Brandl C.J. Korczak B. Green N.M. Nature. 1985; 316: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar), based largely on the observation that Ca2+ transport appeared uncoupled from ATP hydrolysis in the Ca2+-ATPase following tryptic hydrolysis of Arg198 (15Scott T.L.

While the role of this region in coupling is uncertain, it has been shown to undergo distinct conformational changes during catalysis that are linked to cation binding in the Na+,K+-ATPase and Ca2+-ATPase (6Lutsenko S.

Chem. 1990; 265: 1111-1123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, mutations S234A and D226N in the LOOP1 region of the yeast H+-ATPase were suggested to reduce the normal stoichiometry of protons transported to ATP (23Portillo F. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and a recent report showed that a H285Q mutation caused partial uncoupling (19Wach A. Supply P. Dufour J.-P. Goffeau A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 883-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These latter results suggest that perturbations in the LOOP1 region of the H+-ATPase may affect coupling. In this study, we systematically probed by mutagenesis-conserved regions of LOOP1 to investigate the potential role of this segment in energy coupling by the yeast H+-ATPase.

All mutations generated in this work were transformed into yeast strain SH122 (HO ade6-1 trp5-1 leu2-1 lys1-1 ura3-1 pma1: LEU2/PMA1) (8Harris S.L. Perlin D.S. Seto-Young D. Haber J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24439-24445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For expression of pma1 in secretory vesicles, yeast strain NY17 sec6-4 (MATa, ura3-52, sec6-4) was used (25Potenza M. Bowser R. Müller H. Novick P. Yeast. 1992; 8: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 26Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All yeast cultures were grown in 1-liter batches of YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone and 2% dextrose, pH 5.7) at 22°C to mid-log phase (A590∼ 5.0). Overnight cultures (18 h) of pma1 mutants (0.4 ml) were inoculated into 30 ml of YPD medium and grown with shaking at both 24 and 37°C. Aliquots (0.2 ml) were removed hourly from each culture to determine optical density at 590 nm. A microplate-based assay was used to examine the pH sensitivity and hygromycin B resistance of mutants by evaluating cell growth in YDP media with pH ranging from 2.25 to 5.5 or in YDP media containing 0-200 μg/ml hygromycin B, as described previously (13Seto-Young D. Na S. Monk B.C. Haber J.E. Perlin D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23988-23995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed pma1 mutants were constructed as described previously (9Na S. Perlin D.S. Seto-Young D. Wang G. Haber J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11792-11797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All mutants were prepared in phagemid vector pGW201, which consists of vector pGEM-3zf subcloned with a 6.1-kilobase HindIII fragment containing PMA1 marked with URA3 at the 3ʹ non-coding end (8Harris S.L. Perlin D.S. Seto-Young D. Haber J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24439-24445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PMA1 gene was modified by a C → T change in the coding sequence at nucleotide position 1344 (residue Phe448), which did not alter the codon for Phe448 but resulted in loss of an EcoRI site at this position. A second silent amino acid change was made at L294 to introduce an unique SpeI site by converting T → C at coding position 892 and G → A at position 894. The entire 6.1-kilobase region from pGW201 was excised and transplaced into yeast strain SH122 by the lithium acetate transformation procedure (27Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All vectors containing reconstituted pma1 genes were sequenced prior to transplacement into yeast to confirm the primary site mutation and to eliminate potential secondary mutations in the target region. Isogenic pma1 mutants were prepared as described previously (8Harris S.L. Perlin D.S. Seto-Young D. Haber J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24439-24445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two basic tetrad growth patterns were observed: 4:0 (4 spores viable) and 2:2 (2 viable, 2 dead spores). A 2:2 pattern indicated a recessive lethal mutation, while a 4:0 pattern suggested either a fully functional PMA1 or a gene conversion due to lethality of the mutation in question (28Harris S. Rudnicki K.S. Haber J.E. Genetics. 1993; 135: 5-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To distinguish between these possibilities, the genomic DNA of these mutants was sequenced. In all cases, pma1 mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified chromosomal DNA from the meiotic segregants (13Seto-Young D. Na S. Monk B.C. Haber J.E. Perlin D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23988-23995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vector pGW201 was double digested at unique sites with restriction enzymes SpeI and EcoRI, which removed a 0.4-kilobase fragment encoding amino acids Glu162 to Leu298. A double-stranded oligonucleotide linker consisting of the sequence GGAATTCTTAAGCAGACTAGTC (and its compliment) was digested with SpeI and EcoRI, and then ligated to equivalent sites in the deleted region in pGW201 to form vector pMP401. The linker region carried a new AflII restriction site that aided in the cloning process. The newly constructed vector, which was deleted for the LOOP1 region, contained a short polar linker consisting of Glu162, Phe163, Leu164, Ser165, and Arg166. The next residue, Leu167, is equivalent to Leu298 in the wild type sequence. A 5.7-kilobase HindIII fragment from pMP401 was used to replace the wild type PMA1 gene by homologous recombination (8Harris S.L. Perlin D.S. Seto-Young D. Haber J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24439-24445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cellular phenotype associated with this deletion was assessed by evaluating growth of meiotic segregants on YPD plates. Cells grown to mid-log phase (A590 nm∼ 5) were resuspended at 3 g/ml in homogenization buffer consisting of 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were passed through a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. at 4°C. The lysate was rapidly adjusted to pH 7.0 with 1 M Tris base, and centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 30 min, and the pellet was resuspended at 2 mg/ml in extraction buffer consisting of 10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.45% (w/v) glycerol. Deoxycholate (10% (w/v) stock, pH 7.5) was added dropwise to the suspension, which was stirred gently on ice, to a final concentration of 0.5% (w/v). The deoxycholate-extracted suspension was centrifuged at 150,000 x g for 1 h. The pellet was washed by resuspension in extraction buffer (5 ml/mg protein) and centrifuged, as above. The final pellet was resuspended at 2.5 mg/ml in extraction buffer. ATPase assays were conducted in 96-well microplates, essentially as described by Monk et al. (29Monk B.C. Kurtz M.B. Marrinan Perlin D.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6826-6836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 125-μl assay mixture contained 10 mM MES 1The abbreviation used is: MES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.-Tris, pH 6.5, 5 mM MgSO4, 25 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM ATP, and 0.5-1 μg membrane protein. Samples were incubated at 30°C and inorganic phosphate released from ATP was determined by the addition of 125 μl of phosphate developing reagent (29Monk B.C. Kurtz M.B. Marrinan Perlin D.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6826-6836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The absorbance at 600 nm (A600) was determined after a 15-min incubation at 22°C. All Km and Vmax values were obtained by determining ATP hydrolysis as a function of substrate concentration (0-10 mM for both ATP and MgSO4), and the data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Vanadate sensitivity was determined by measuring ATP hydrolysis in standard ATPase buffer containing sodium vanadate at 0-100 μM. 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. Deoxycholate-enriched H+-ATPase was reconstituted into asolectin-containing liposomes, as described previously (11Seto-Young D. Hall M.J. Na S. Haber J.E. Perlin D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 581-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). ATP-induced proton transport in reconstituted vesicles was monitored by the acridine orange fluorescence-quenching assay (30Perlin D.S. Kasamo K. Brooker R.J. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7884-7892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Liposomes containing 50 μg of reconstituted enzyme were suspended in 1.0 ml of assay buffer containing 10 mM MES-Tris, pH 7.0, 50 mM KCl and 5 mM ATP in a 2.7-ml stirred cuvette. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 mM MgSO4. The quenching of acridine orange fluorescence was monitored with a LS5-B spectrofluorometer (Perkin-Elmer Corp.) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 420 and 550 nm, respectively. pma1 mutants that yield distinct hygromycin B resistant phenotypes were introduced into yeast strain NY17 sec6-4, which produces secretory vesicles at elevated temperature (25Potenza M. Bowser R. Müller H. Novick P. Yeast. 1992; 8: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 26Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by a one-step gene replacement procedure. A 6.1-kilobase HindIII fragment from pGW201 containing pma1 marked with URA3 was transplaced into yeast, as described previously (9Na S. Perlin D.S. Seto-Young D. Wang G. Haber J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11792-11797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants growing in the absence of uracil (Ura+ colonies) were further selected for growth resistance on YPD plates containing 50-250 μg/ml hygromycin B. Hygromycin B-resistant colonies were isolated, and the PMA1 region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. DNA sequence analysis was used to confirm that the mutations were integrated into the genome. Secretory vesicles were prepared by a modified version of the procedure described by Rao and Slayman (31Rao R. Slayman C.W. Biophys. J. 1992; 62: 228-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Parental strain NY17 and isogenic pma1 mutant strains were grown in YPD at 22°C until mid-log phase (A590∼ 5). The temperature was increased to 37°C for 2 h, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 x g for 20 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.4 M sorbitol, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2.5 μg/ml chymostatin. The cells were broken in a French press at 20,000 p.s.i., and the lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 min. Secretory vesicles in the supernatant were centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 60 min. The pellet was resuspended at 5 mg/ml in 10 mM MES-Tris, pH 7.0, containing 0.8 M sorbitol (31Rao R. Slayman C.W. Biophys. J. 1992; 62: 228-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and used directly for evaluation ATP-induced pH gradient formation. Proton-transport in secretory vesicles was determined by the same procedure used with reconstituted vesicles. In some experiments, proton-transport and ATP hydrolysis were monitored simultaneously. To monitor ATP hydrolysis under these conditions, a 40-μl aliquot was removed at 30-s intervals from the assay mixture, and mixed with 200 μl of phosphate colorimetric reagent (32Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-118Crossref Scopus (3000) Google Scholar) to measure phosphate released. Coupling efficiency was assessed by comparing the initial rate of proton pumping (percent fluorescence quenching per min) with the rate of ATP hydrolyzed per min. Protein concentrations were determined by modification of the Lowry method (33Markwell M.A.K. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5279) Google Scholar). SDS-gel eletrophoresis of plasma membrane proteins in 10% precast minigels (Bio-Rad) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA sequencing was performed with the Sequenase DNA sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The LOOP 1 region appears similar in all the P-type ATPases (34Zvaritch E. James P. Vorherr T. Falchetto R. Modyanov N. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8070-8076Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As a first step toward understanding the role of LOOP1 in H+-ATPase function, the region extending from the putative bilayer/cytoplasm boundary of transmembrane segment 2 to the same boundary point in transmembrane segment 3, Glu162-Leu298, was deleted. However, because LOOP1 demarcates the bilayer boundaries for transmembrane segments 2 and 3, it was rationalized that linking the transmembrane segments directly would be too destabilizing to the enzyme. Therefore, the LOOP1 domain was replaced with a short polar linker region consisting of Glu162, Phe163, Leu164, Ser165, Arg166, and Leu167. (Leu167 corresponds to Leu298 in the wild type enzyme.) The deletion construct was introduced into yeast and found to produce a recessive lethal growth phenotype indicative of a defective H+-ATPase. The fact that the deletion construct produced a recessive lethal phenotype, rather than a dominant lethal phenotype resulting in gene conversion, may suggest that the mutant enzyme structure was not grossly perturbed. Nonetheless, these results demonstrate that deletion of the LOOP1 region results in a defective enzyme. Several highly conserved stretches of amino acids have been identified in the LOOP1 region among the various P-type ATPases (35Wach A. Schlesser A. Goffeau A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 309-317PubMed Google Scholar). These stretches in yeast PMA1 include Val182-Gln188, Glu195-Ile201, Gly207-Asp213, Ile225-Leu235, and Met258-Gly270. Scanning alanine mutagenesis was used to probe residues, in four of the five conserved regions found in LOOP1, by converting all amino acids to alanine. The Met258-Gly270 region was not examined because this region contains the lowest relative percentage of conserved residues (35Wach A. Schlesser A. Goffeau A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 309-317PubMed Google Scholar), and specific residues have been examined in other studies (8Harris S.L. Perlin D.S. Seto-Young D. Haber J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24439-24445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Ghislain M. Schlesser A. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17549-17555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Goffeau A. de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15503-15505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conserved amino acid clusters or regions are usually considered to be functionally important, and by probing these regions, it is more likely that interesting mutations would be isolated. Alanine substitution was used because it generally causes fewer structural perturbations, and subtly perturbed mutant enzymes were desirable due to the lethality of more severe pma1 mutations in yeast. (In one case, the naturally occurring alanine at position 229 was converted to serine.) The effects of each mutation on enzyme function, as reflected in cell viability, are shown in Table I. It was found that 54% (14/26) of the residues, when modified to alanine, resulted in sufficient enzyme perturbation to prevent cell growth (lethality). The lethal mutations were widely distributed, although clusters did appear such as Glu195-Pro198 and Thr231-Glu233. Lethal mutations were frequently observed with prominent changes in side group character, such as Glu or Arg to Ala. However, they were also observed with more subtle changes, such as Val or Gly to Ala.Table I.Growth phenotypes of scanning alanine pma1 mutants at 24 and 37°CMutantsViabilityaViability was determined from the growth of dissected spores on YPD medium.

Open table in a new tab Viable pma1 mutants from the scanning alanine mutagenesis were characterized for cell growth at 24 and 37°C. All of the pma1 mutants at 24°C showed growth properties that were comparable to that of wild type (Table I). In contrast, two mutants, I183A and D185A, showed significantly reduced growth rates at the elevated temperature of 37°C (Fig. 1). Viable mutants were screened for growth resistance to hygromycin B, which has been correlated with the ability of the H+-ATPase to sustain a hyperpolarized membrane potential (39Perlin D.S. Brown C.L. Haber J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18118-18122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As previously observed, wild type yeast are highly sensitive to hygromycin B (24McCusker J.H. Perlin D.S. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4082-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), while pma1 mutants show a wide range of sensitivities. Differential sensitivity was also observed for the LOOP1 mutants, as indicated by the amount of hygromycin B required to produce 50% growth inhibition in rich medium (IC50) (Table I). A majority of the pma1 mutants were found to retain strong sensitivity to hygromycin B, while five mutants I183A, G207A, V209A, S228A, and I230A were three to five times more resistant to the antibiotic. (This shift in sensitivity correlates exactly with plate assays (24McCusker J.H. Perlin D.S. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4082-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) previously used to score hygromycin B resistance. 2D. Seto-Young, unpublished results.) Hygromycin B resistance was also observed at 37°C, and in the case of I183A, was somewhat amplified (Table I). The pma1 mutants were also grown as a function of acidic medium pH, which provides a relative measure of the ability of the H+-ATPase to regulate intracellular pH. Fig. 2 shows that the growth of wild type cells was relatively insensitive to acidic medium above pH 2.3. In contrast to wild type, pma1 mutants, I183A and D185A, showed prominent growth sensitivities below pH 2.9 at both 24°C (not shown) and 37°C. pma1 mutant S228A also showed acid sensitivity but only at elevated temperature. These data indicate that several LOOP1 mutants show typical phenotypic growth abnormalities that are associated with defects in the H+-ATPase (24McCusker J.H. Perlin D.S. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell.

Rod cGMP PDE is generally viewed as a heterotrimeric protein composed of catalytic α and β subunits (∼90 kDa each) and two copies of the inhibitory subunit γ (∼10 kDa). However, the possibility that rod PDE could exist as distinct isoforms, such as ααγ2 and ββγ2 has not been ruled out. We have studied this question using cross-linking of PDE subunits with maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester and para-phenyldimaleimide. The cross-linking resulted in major products with molecular mass of 100 and 150 kDa, a doublet at ∼180-190 kDa, and a doublet at ∼210-220 kDa. Cross-linked products were analyzed using polyclonal-specific anti-PDEαβ, anti-PDEα, anti-PDEβ, or anti-PDEγ antibodies. The anti-PDEα and anti-PDEαβ antibodies recognized all the cross-linked products, whereas anti-PDEβ and anti-PDEγ antibodies did not interact with the 150-kDa band, indicating that the composition of this band is most likely αα. Similar analysis of cross-linked products of trypsin-treated PDE preparations revealed bands that are likely formed by PDEβ subunit. The molecular size of holo-PDE and trypsin-activated PDE were studied using analytical ultracentrifugation in order to determine if oligomerization of PDE could account for the cross-linking of identical PDE subunits. The sedimentation analysis of both holo-PDE and ta-PDE revealed homogeneous samples with molecular masses of ∼220 and ∼150 kDa, respectively. These results indicate that PDE is likely a mixture of the major species αβγ2, minor species ααγ2, and possibly ββγ2.

Other members in this group are cGMP-stimulated PDE (PDE2 family), which hydrolyzes both cAMP and cGMP, and cGMP-binding, cGMP-specific PDE (PDE5 family) (Beavo, 5Beavo J.A. Physiol.

The PDEα/β catalytic domain contains the consensus sequence -NKXD- that specifies the guanine ring binding, a Mg2+ binding element DXXG, and a glycine-rich loop similar to the cAMP-binding site in the catabolite activator protein (Charbonneau et al., 12Charbonneau H. Prusti R.K. LeTrong H. Sonnenburg W.K. Mullaney P.J. Walsh K.A. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar; Li et al., 24Li T. Volpp K.

Two noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites (Kd values 0.2-2.0 μM) were originally identified in frog rod PDE (Yamazaki et al., 42Yamazaki A. Sen I. Bitensky M.W. Casnelli J. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11619-11624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later, noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites were also shown to be present in bovine PDE, however, with an affinity for cGMP much greater than that for frog PDE (Gillespie and Beavo, 18Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4311-4315Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Analysis of the PDEα and PDEβ sequences has shown that these sites are located in the respective N-terminal regions. The N-terminal half of PDEα and PDEβ, as well as other members of cGMP-binding PDEs, contain two internally homologous regions (repeats) (Charbonneau et al., 12Charbonneau H. Prusti R.K. LeTrong H. Sonnenburg W.K. Mullaney P.J. Walsh K.A. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar; Li et al., 24Li T. Volpp K. Applebury M.L. Proc.

Johnston J.P. Volpp K.J. Applebury M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12955-12959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These regions (I, amino acids 89-251 and II, amino acids 295-464 for PDEβ) are likely noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites (Charbonneau et al., 12Charbonneau H. Prusti R.K. LeTrong H. Sonnenburg W.K. Mullaney P.J. Walsh K.A. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Both regions have structural elements for cGMP binding. In addition, region II of the repeat has a weak degree of homology with cAMP/cGMP-binding sites on cAMP/cGMP-dependent protein kinases (Li et al., 24Li T. Volpp K. Applebury M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar; Lipkin et al., 25Lipkin V.M. Khramtsov N.V. Vasilevskaya I.A. Atabekova N.V. Muradov K.G. Gubanov V.V. Li T. Johnston J.P. Volpp K.J. Applebury M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12955-12959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It appears, however, that the cGMP-binding domains of PDEs are unrelated to those of the catabolite gene activator protein and the cGMP or cAMP-dependent protein kinases (Shabb and Corbin, 37Shabb J.B. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5723-5726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C termini of both catalytic subunits contain the recognition site CXXX for post-translational prenylation and carboxymethylation. The C terminus of PDEα is farnesylated, whereas the C terminus of PDEβ is geranyl-geranylated (Ong et al., 30Ong O.C. Ota I.M. Clarke S. Fung B.K.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9238-9242Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar; Anant et al., 1Anant J.S. Ong O.C. Xie H. Clarke S. O'Brien P.J. Fung B.K.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 687-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These modifications are responsible for PDE membrane attachment (Ong et al., 30Ong O.C. Ota I.M. Clarke S. Fung B.K.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9238-9242Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar; Catty and Deterre, 9Catty P. Deterre P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 263-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).It is commonly believed that the PDE catalytic core is a heterodimer PDEαβ (Fung et al., 16Fung B.K.-K. Young J.M. Yamane H.K. Griswold-Prenner I. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2657-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, recent findings indicate that homodimer isoenzymes PDEαα and PDEββ may also be present (Lipkin et al., 25Lipkin V.M. Khramtsov N.V. Vasilevskaya I.A. Atabekova N.V. Muradov K.G. Gubanov V.V.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9340-9344Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, evidence suggests that cone PDE is a homodimer composed of two identical PDEαʹ subunits (∼90 kDa) (Gillespie and Beavo, 17Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8133-8141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that share >60% homology with PDEα and PDEβ (Lipkin et al., 25Lipkin V.M. Khramtsov N.V. Vasilevskaya I.A. Atabekova N.V.

Likewise, both cGMP-binding PDE from bovine lung and cGMP-stimulated PDE from bovine heart appear to be homodimeric proteins (Thomas et al., 39Thomas M.K. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14964-14970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Martins et al., 26Martins T.J. Mumby M.C. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1973-1979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we study the subunit structure of rod cGMP-phosphodiesterase using cross-linking of PDE combined with analysis of cross-linked products with the subunit-specific antibodies and determination of PDE molecular size using analytical ultracentrifugation.RESULTSChemical cross-linking had been already used to study PDE structure and function. In an earlier report Hingorani et al. (19Hingorani V.N. Tobias D.T. Henderson J.T. Ho Y.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6916-6926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used the bifunctional cross-linker MBS, which reacts with amino and sulfhydryl groups, and the sulfhydryl linker PDM to cross-link PDE subunits. Hingorani et al. (19Hingorani V.N. Tobias D.T. Henderson J.T. Ho Y.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6916-6926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that these cross-linkers are most effective in PDE cross-linking, whereas amino-reactive homobifunctional cross-linkers, such as dimethyl suberimidate, cross-link PDE subunits poorly. Therefore, we selected MBS and PDM as cross-linkers for our experiments. However, lack of PDEα, -β, and -γ subunit-specific antibodies did not allow Hingorani et al. to identify the subunit composition of observed cross-linked products. The only study where cross-linked products between PDE catalytic subunits were analyzed with subunit-specific antibodies came to the conclusion that PDE catalytic subunits interact with identical subunits and PDEγ but do not interact with each other (Muradov et al., 29Muradov K.G. Natochin M.Y. Bondarenko V.A. Skiba N.P. Lipkin V.M. Biol. Membr. (Russia). 1990; 7: 565-572Google Scholar). We have utilized chemical cross-linkers MBS and PDM with a panel of PDE subunit-specific antibodies to further study this question.Analysis of Cross-linked Products of Holo-PDEChemical cross-linking of holo-PDE with either MBS or PDM resulted in the formation of products with similar molecular masses (Fig. 2). However, the relative amount of each product generated with the cross-linkers was different, and the efficiency of the cross-linking with PDM was much lower than with MBS. The molecular masses of cross-linked products observed after SDS-PAGE in 5% gel are as follows: 100 kDa, 140 kDa, a doublet at ∼180-190 kDa, and a doublet at ∼210-220 kDa. There are additional minor bands in the 225-230-kDa range (Fig. 2). These results are in agreement with the data of Hingorani et al. (19Hingorani V.N. Tobias D.T. Henderson J.T. Ho Y.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6916-6926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Increasing the time of cross-linking typically led to a larger proportion of the higher molecular mass products, whereas the cross-linking pattern did not appear to depend significantly on the concentration of PDE (0.5-2.5 μM) (data not shown). Such results suggest that the cross-linking reflects the formation of relatively stable PDE complexes in solution.The composition of the cross-linked products was tested using anti-PDEαβ, anti-PDEα, or anti-PDEβ antibodies. Anti-PDEαβ and anti-PDEα recognized all of the cross-linked products (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). The antibody recognition of the bands at ∼180-190 kDa and at ∼210-220 kDa is not well seen in Fig. 2 and is apparent when the films were overexposed as in Fig. 3. Anti-PDEβ antibodies, on the other hand, interacted with all but the 140-kDa band, suggesting that this band contains only PDEα catalytic subunit.Fig. 3Analysis of PDE cross-linked products after separation using 8% SDS-PAGE. Holo-PDE (1 μM) was cross-linked with MBS (50 μM), separated on 8% SDS-gel, transferred to nitrocellulose paper, and analyzed with anti-PDEα or anti-PDEβ antibodies. The cross-linked product, recognized only by anti-PDEα antibody, migrates as a 160-kDa band (indicated with arrow).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mobility of cross-linked proteins often depends on the acrylamide concentration of the gels. In order to determine whether the patterns recognized by both the anti-PDEα and the anti-PDEβ antibodies are cross-linked products of the α and β subunits, or unresolved cross-linking of identical PDE catalytic subunits, similar analysis was performed after SDS-PAGE in 8% gel (Fig. 3). The band that reacted only with anti-PDEα antibodies now migrated as a ∼160-kDa protein. An additional minor band at ∼115 kDa was resolved using an 8% gel. This band also appears to react only with anti-PDEα antibodies. All other bands again were recognized with anti-PDEα and anti-PDEβ antibodies (Fig. 3). Western blotting with anti-PDEγ antibodies indicate that all PDE cross-linked products except the 160-kDa band contain the PDEγ subunit (Fig. 4). The composition of this band is most likely αα, while the 115-kDa band appears to be a αγ2 cross-linked product. Low level of cross-linking of two PDEγ subunits to one catalytic subunit was also seen previously (Fung et al., 16Fung B.K.-K. Young J.M. Yamane H.K. Griswold-Prenner I. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2657-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and may indicate the close proximity of the PDEγ subunits in the PDE holo-enzyme.Fig. 4Immunoblotting of PDE cross-linked products with anti-PDEα and anti-PDEγ-specific antibodies. Holo-PDE (1 μM) was cross-linked with MBS (50 μM), separated on 8% SDS-gel, transferred to nitrocellulose paper, and analyzed with anti-PDEα or anti-PDEγ antibodies. 1, PDE; 2, PDE cross-linked with MBS for 15 min.

That the αα cross-linked product does not contain the γ subunit may indicate that its formation occurs even faster than the cross-linking between PDE catalytic subunits and PDEγ. Thus, it appears that PDEα subunits interact with each other in solution.Cross-linking of ta-PDE and t-PDEta-PDE was obtained using limited trypsin digestion of holo-PDE in order to strip PDEγ subunits from the catalytic subunits. Cross-linking of ta-PDE (Fig. 5, lane 1) with MBS resulted in the formation of major products migrating at molecular masses of ∼175 kDa and a doublet at ∼200 and 205 kDa as well as minor cross-linked products at ∼120 and ∼150 kDa (Fig. 5, lane 2). The minor products are not well seen on a Coomassie-stained gel; however, they are visualized with anti-PDEαβ and anti-PDEα antibodies. Anti-PDEαβ antibody recognized all the ta-PDE cross-linked products (Fig. 5). Anti-PDEα antibodies reacted with all bands, except probably the 200-kDa polypeptide. Anti-PDEβ antibody did not recognize the cross-linked product at ∼150 kDa (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, the yield of the 150-kDa αα product is low after cross-linking of ta-PDE. A very weak signal of anti-PDEβ antibody at ∼110-120 kDa might be nonspecific.Fig. 5Analysis of ta-PDE and t-PDE cross-linked products. A, ta-PDE (lane 1) or t-PDE (lane 3) (1 μM each) were cross-linked with MBS (50 μM) for 5 min (lanes 2 and 4, respectively), separated on a 6% SDS gel, transferred to nitrocellulose paper, and analyzed with anti-PDEαβ, anti-PDEα, or anti-PDEβ antibodies.

Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11094-11099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Catty and Deterre, 9Catty P. Deterre P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 263-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated that trypsin cleaves after Lys-146 and Lys-147 of PDEβ subunit producing N-terminally truncated PDEβ polypeptide (Artemyev et al., 3Artemyev N.O. Natochin M. Busman M. Schey K.L. Hamm H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5407-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Results of cross-linking of tPDE containing equimolar amounts of 88 and 70-kDa polypeptides are shown in Fig. 5A (lanes 3 and 4). This cross-linking produced products with molecular masses of ∼75, 95, 120, 125, 170, 180, and 205 kDa. Anti-PDEαβ antibodies recognized all of the cross-linked bands. Anti-PDEα antibody reacted with the 95-, 120-, 125-, 170-, and 205-kDa bands (Fig. 5A). t-PDE was not recognized by anti-PDEβ antibodies since it lacks N-terminal region of PDEβ subunit. N-terminal tryptic fragment(s) of PDEβ appear to remain at least partially bound to the catalytic core of PDE (Artemyev et al., 3Artemyev N.O. Natochin M. Busman M. Schey K.L. Hamm H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5407-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ∼75- and ∼95-kDa products most likely are cross-links of N-terminal fragment of PDEβ with the 70-kDa PDEβ polypeptide and 88-kDa PDEα, respectively. This cross-linked fragment (∼5 kDa) is smaller than the full-length tryptic fragment of PDEβ (∼16 kDa), and it lacks the anti-PDEβ antibodies recognition site because the antibody did not recognize the ∼75- and ∼95-kDa bands. The formation of two cross-linked products at ∼120 and 125 kDa correlated with the presence of the 70-kDa PDEβ polypeptide in tPDE preparations. The ∼120-kDa band appear to be a cross-link between PDEα and the 70-kDa PDEβ. This band is also detected as a very minor product after cross-linking of ta-PDE which reflects very low levels of 70-kDa band in ta-PDE (Fig. 5). The 125-kDa band could represent a product of cross-linking between PDEα, 70-kDa PDEβ, and the N-terminal polypeptide of PDEβ attached to PDEα or 70-kDa PDEβ.Analysis of higher molecular weight cross-linked products of tPDE indicates that the 180-kDa band might contain only PDEβ subunit. This band is readily recognized by anti-PDEαβ, but seemingly it does not react with anti-PDEα antibody (Fig. 5). The 170-kDa product could be either a cross-link of only PDEα subunits or a cross-link between PDEα and PDEβ subunits.

Open table in a new tab Analytical Ultracentrifugation of PDE and ta-PDEOne potential scenario of how identical PDE subunits can be cross-linked is oligomerization of PDE. Therefore, in the next set of experiments we examined the molecular size of PDE using analytical ultracentrifugation. This procedure was performed on holo-PDE as well as on ta-PDE. Limited proteolysis of PDE removes PDEγ subunits, the farnesylated C-terminal fragment of PDEα, and the geranyl-geranylated C terminus of PDEβ (Catty and Deterre, 9Catty P. Deterre P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 263-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The molecular size analysis of ta-PDE was performed in order to determine if prenylation of the PDE catalytic subunits and/or the presence of PDEγ subunits could contribute to potential oligomerization (specific or nonspecific) of PDE.Fig. 6 shows that the data sets for holo-PDE and ta-PDE are consistent with nonassociating solutions in both samples. The goodness of fit is indicated by the random distribution of residuals, as shown in the insets. In A and B, the data are consistent with a homogeneous molecular mass of 2.2 (1.1, 3.3) x 105 Da and 1.5 (1.3, 1.6) x 105 Da for holo-PDE and ta-PDE, respectively. The values in parentheses represent the limits within a 67% confidence level. The greater uncertainty in the holo-PDE data is mainly due to the lower concentration of protein loaded in the cell. Fitting of the data to models of associating species led to an increase in the sum of the squares of deviations, i.e. the models were not as appropriate. Thus, it can be concluded that under the experimental conditions and within the concentration range investigated, there is no detectable oligomerization of either holo-PDE or ta-PDE. This supports the idea that cross-linking between identical PDE subunits reflects the formation of a PDEαα and potentially -ββ species rather than oligomerization of PDE.Fig. 6Analytical ultracentrifugation of PDE and ta-PDE. Equilibrium sedimentation analysis of PDE and ta-PDE was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, holo-PDE sample; B, ta-PDE sample. The lines show the best fit of the data sets to the nonassociating model.

Early studies demonstrated that PDE is composed of two large catalytic α and β subunits and a small inhibitory γ subunit (Baehr et al., 4Baehr W. Devlin M.J. Applebury M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11669-11677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Hurley and Stryer, 20Hurley J.B. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11094-11099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later, it was conclusively demonstrated that holo-PDE contains two copies of PDEγ subunit per PDE molecule and that both PDEα and PDEβ subunits bind PDEγ (Deterre et al., 13Deterre P. Bigay J. Forquet F. Robert M. Chabre M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar; Whalen and Bitensky, 41Whalen M.M. Bitensky M.B. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2657-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). PDEα and PDEβ subunits share a high degree of homology and have similar molecular masses and physicochemical properties. They can be separated by low cross-linked 15% SDS-PAGE (Baehr et al., 4Baehr W. Devlin M.J. Applebury M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11669-11677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where they appear as equally stained bands. Therefore, it was assumed that PDE is a complex αβγ2. Alternatively, PDE could be an equimolar mixture of the isoenzymes ααγ2 and ββγ2 or a mixture of all three potential isoforms with unknown proportions of αβγ2 to ααγ2 and ββγ2 species. Fung et al. (16Fung B.K.-K. Young J.M. Yamane H.K. Griswold-Prenner I. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2657-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) have tested this possibility using PDEα-specific antibodies. Anti-PDEα antibodies immunoprecipitated PDE containing equivalent amounts of PDEα and -β subunits, indicating that the composition of PDE is αβγ2. In contrast, Muradov et al. (29Muradov K.G. Natochin M.Y. Bondarenko V.A. Skiba N.P. Lipkin V.M. Biol. Membr. (Russia). 1990; 7: 565-572Google Scholar) reported the formation of ααγ, ββ, and ββγ but not αβ or αβγ complexes on rod outer segment membranes. Thus, we began our studies on rod PDE subunit composition using cross-linking of holo-PDE, ta-PDE, and t-PDE with MBS and analysis of the cross-linked products with subunit-specific antibodies.The results of cross-linking of holo-PDE indicate that both anti-PDEα and anti-PDEβ antibodies recognize the majority of cross-linked products. Additionally, we noted the formation of a ∼150-kDa product (migrates as 140- and 160-kDa polypeptide on 5 and 8% PAGE, respectively), which contains only the PDEα catalytic subunit. This cross-linked product was not detected with anti-PDEγ antibodies. Thus, the composition of this band appears to be αα. The molecular mass of this product is slightly different than what might be expected (180 kDa), however; quite often products of chemical cross-linking migrate anomalously on SDS-PAGE. We estimate that the yield of the αα cross-linked product may account for approximately 10-15% of PDE complexes.Cross-linking of ta-PDE and t-PDE have demonstrated that most of the cross-linked products are formed by both α and β subunits of PDE. However, these data also support the likelihood of the minor ββ isoform of P"

We have shown previously that CS 2 cells produce a heparin-binding growth factor that stimulates the growth of SC 115 cells as well as the growth of themselves. In this study, a growth factor was purified from serum-free conditioned media of CS 2 cells cultured without testosterone. A heparin-binding fraction showed growth- promoting activity on SC 115 cells and BALB/3T3 cells. The amino acid sequence analysis revealed that the components were identical to histones H2A.1 and H2A.X. Since histone H2A purified from bovine thymus had almost no growth-promoting activity on SC115 cells, histone H2A.X was assumed to be a growth factor. cDNA of histone H2A.X was cloned from a library of CS 2 cells, and its sequence was confirmed. The expressed product of histone H2A.X cDNA in Escherichia coli showed remarkable stimulatory effects on growth of SC 115 cells cultured in the absence of testosterone. These results indicate that histone H2A.X is secreted from CS 2 cells cultured without testosterone and plays a role as a growth factor.

INTRODUCTIONIt has been reported that the growth of some hormone-responsive tumors is controlled by hormone-induced growth factors in the autocrine manner (1Dickson R.B. Thompson E.W. Lippman M.E. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 37: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For example, on MCF-7 cells, an estrogen-responsive human breast cancer cell line, transforming α-like and insulin-like growth factors are thought to mediate the estrogen-responsive growth of cancer cells (2Dickson R.B. Huff K.K. Spencer E.M. Lippman M.E. Endocrinology. 1985; 118: 138-142Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 3Huff K.K. Knabbe C. Lindsey R. Kaufman D. Bronzert D. Dickson R.B. Mol.

LNCaP, an androgen-responsive human prostate cancer cell line, is thought to secrete a fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 1The abbreviations used are: FGFfibroblast growth factorSC 115Shionogi carcinoma 115CS 2Chiba subline 2AIGFandrogen-induced growth factorCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonateRP-HPLCreverse-phase high performance liquid chromatographyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisGSTglutathione S-transferase.-like peptide in response to androgen stimuli (4Zuck B.

It is generally accepted that hormone-responsive tumors gradually progress to hormone-unresponsive ones; however, the mechanism regulating the growth of the latter seems to be obscure.Shionogi carcinoma 115 (SC 115) is an androgen-responsive mouse mammary tumor (5Minesita T. Yamaguchi K. Cancer Res. 1965; 25: 1168-1175PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, an androgen-induced growth factor (AIGF) secreted from SC 115 cells in the presence of testosterone was purified, and its cDNA was cloned (6Tanaka A. Miyamoto K. Minamino N. Takeda M. Sato B. Matsuo H. Matsumoto K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8928-8932Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The structural analysis revealed that AIGF was a novel FGF-like growth factor, which was established as the 8th one in the FGF family. An androgen-independent subline, Chiba subline 2 (CS 2), was derived from SC 115 in our laboratory (7Fuse H. Akimoto S. Sato R. Miyauchi T. Wakisaka M. Hosoya T. Shimazaki J. Endocrinol. Jpn. 1983; 30: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 8Suzuki N. Urata M. Miyauchi T. Wakisaka M. Shimazaki J. Hosoya T. Endocrinol.

Jpn. 1987; 34: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and a clone from CS 2 cells has subsequently been maintained. We have shown previously that CS 2 cells also produce a heparin binding growth factor that stimulates the growth of SC 115 cells and CS 2 cells without testosterone (10Furuya Y. Sato N. Akakura K. Ichikawa T. Suzuki N. Sato R. Shimazaki J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 4979-4983PubMed Google Scholar). This factor was thought to be different from AIGF, because AIGF mRNA was not expressed in CS 2 cells (11Sato N. Watabe Y. Suzuki H. Shimazaki J. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1993; 84: 1300-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To shed light on growth-regulatory mechanisms of hormone-unresponsive tumor cells, the present study was undertaken on purification of the heparin-binding growth factor produced by CS 2 cells and on analysis of amino acid sequence.DISCUSSIONThe growth of SC 115 cells is stimulated by AIGF (6Tanaka A. Miyamoto K. Minamino N. Takeda M. Sato B. Matsuo H. Matsumoto K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8928-8932Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), acidic and basic FGFs (10Furuya Y. Sato N. Akakura K. Ichikawa T. Suzuki N. Sato R. Shimazaki J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 4979-4983PubMed Google Scholar, 11Sato N. Watabe Y. Suzuki H. Shimazaki J. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1993; 84: 1300-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and schwannoma-derived growth factor (21Sonoda H. Yamaguchi T. Watanabe S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This study showed that, in addition to these growth factors, histone H2A.X secreted from CS 2 cells also had growth-promoting activity on SC 115 cells (Figs. 1A and 5). Moreover, histone H2A.X stimulated the growth of BALB/3T3 cells (Fig. 2).First, the growth factor secreted from CS 2 cells was purified with a heparin-Ultrogel column, and then the 1.0 M NaCl fractions which exhibited the greatest stimulating activity were applied to an RP-HPLC column (Fig. 1A). Approximately 200 μl of each fraction that showed great growth-promoting activity in RP-HPLC was applied to SDS-PAGE analysis, and a single major band was obtained (Fig. 1B). Although the molecular weights of H2A.1 and H2A.X are different and the migrations of these histones on SDS-PAGE seemed to be slightly different, it was thought that the staining band of H2A.X was covered over with that of H2A.1 on the SDS-PAGE analysis because the amount of H2A.1 in the purified fraction was much larger than that of H2A.X, and the gel of SDS-PAGE was strongly developed after silver staining to confirm that the other minor proteins were not contained in this fraction. Subsequent sequence analysis after lysyl endopeptidase digestion showed that no proteins other than H2A.1 and H2A.X were present in the fraction (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). Because histone H2A.1 did not show any growth-promoting activity on SC 115 cells (Fig. 5), histone H2A.X was assumed to be a growth factor secreted from CS 2 cells. The expression experiment confirmed that histone H2A.X is one of the heparin-binding growth factors secreted from CS 2 cells (Fig. 5, Fig. 6).Histones are small, highly basic proteins that associate with the DNA to form nucleosomes and play a fundamental role in organizing chromatin architecture by compacting DNAs. As for histone H2A, one of the core histones, at least four species of isoproteins are detected, H2A.1, H2A.2, H2A.X, and H2A.Z (20West M.H. Bonner W.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1983; 76: 455-464Google Scholar, 22West M.H. Bonner W.M. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3238-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). There have been some reports that H2A plays a role as a gonadotropin-releasing hormone-binding inhibitor (23Aten R.F. Behrman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11065-11071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or as a homeostatic thymus hormone with histone H2B (24Reichhart R. Zeppezauer M. J÷rnvall H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4871-4875Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, the histone H2 group might show some biological functions in addition to its main function in organizing chromatin architecture by compacting DNA.As for human H2A.X (25Mannironi C. Bonner W.M. Hatch C.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9113-9126Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), the carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequence (Ser-Gln-Glu) of H2A.X is homologous with those of several species of lower eukaryotes, e.g. Saccharomyces cerevisiae H2A.1 and H2A.2 (26Choe J. Kolodrubetz D. Grunstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and Aspergillus nidulans H2A (27May G.S. Morris N.R. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 58: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In lower eukaryotes, this type of histone is estimated to compose a large fraction of the H2A proteins, and their chromatin largely consists of a transcriptionally active region (28Weisbrod S. Nature. 1982; 297: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). These facts suggest that the carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequence (Ser-Gln-Glu) of H2A.X plays some role in active chromatin and might influence regulation of proliferation.It has been reported that H2A.X has two mRNAs of 0.5 and 1.4 kilobases, which are transcribed from a single gene and have different stabilities throughout the cell cycle (19Nagata T. Kato T. Morita T. Nozaki M. Kubota H. Yagi H. Matsushiro A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2441-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 29Bonner W.M. Mannironi C. Orr A. Pilch D.R. Hatch C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 984-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The amount of the shorter mRNA is coupled to DNA synthesis. It is synthesized just after the beginning of S-phase and degraded just after the end of S-phase. On the other hand, the longer mRNA is very stable through the cell cycle. The two mRNAs are present in spleen, thymus and testes of mice and several tissue culture cell lines. The 1.4-kilobase transcript is detected strongly in embryonic cells such as undifferentiated F9 teratocarcinoma cells. These results imply that H2A.X plays a role of not only organizing chromatin architecture during S-phase but also growth regulator through the cell cycle in these tissues and embryonic cells.There have been some reports about the heparin-binding growth factors that do not belong to the FGF family. As one of these heparin-binding growth factors, a hepatoma-derived growth factor was purified from the conditioned medium of human hepatoma-derived cell line, HuH-7 (30Nakamura H. Izumoto Y. Kambe H. Kuroda T. Mori T. Kawamura K. Yamamoto H. Kishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25143-25149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its primary sequence shares homology with high mobility group-1 protein. It was also reported that brain heparin-binding protein (amphotericin), which enhances neurite outgrowth in cerebral neurons, was identical to high mobility group-1 and was found at relatively high levels in transformed cells (31Merenmies J. Pihlaskari R. Laitinen J. Wartiovaara J. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16722-16729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Parkkinen J. Raulo E. Merenmies J. Nolo R. Kajander E.O. Baumann M. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19726-19738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These growth factors do not have any homology with the FGF family and with histones. Histone H2A.X, shown as one of the heparin-binding growth factors in the present study, is not in the FGF family. These results indicate that some of these chromosomal heparin binding proteins have a role to regulate cell cycle.Since H2A.X has no signal sequence for secretion, it is not yet clear how H2A.X is secreted from the cells. However, hydrophobic amino acids are abundant from the middle of the molecule to the carboxyl terminus of H2A.X, and it is considered that this region is an internal signal sequence (33Ye R.D. Wun T.-C. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4869-4875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is now important to clarify the mechanism by which H2A.X acts on cell growth.

https://openalex.org/W2151285771,"As part of a comprehensive effort to map the most important regions of sickle hemoglobin that are involved in polymerization, we have determined whether two sites previously shown to be involved, Leu-88(β) and Lys-95(β), had additive effects when substituted. The former site is part of the hydrophobic pocket that binds Val-6(β), the natural mutation of HbS, and the latter site is a prominent part of the hemoglobin exterior. A sickle hemoglobin triple mutant with three amino acid substitutions on the β-chain, E6V/L88A/K95I, has been expressed in yeast and characterized extensively. Its oxygen binding curve, cooperativity, response to allosteric effectors, and the alkaline Bohr effect showed that it was completely functional. The polymer solubility of the deoxy triple mutant, measured by a new micromethod requiring reduced amounts of hemoglobin, was identical to that of the E6V(β)/K95I(β) mutant, i.e. when the K95I(β) substitution was present on the same tetramer together with the naturally occurring E6V(β) substitution, the L88A(β) replacement had no additive effect on polymer inhibition.

INTRODUCTIONSickle cell anemia results from a single point mutation in the gene encoding β-globin, whereby the Glu-6(β) residue in hemoglobin A (HbA) is substituted by Val in sickle hemoglobin (HbS) (1Pauling L. Itano H. Singer S.J. Wells J.C. Science. 1949; 110: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar, 2Ingram V.M. Nature. 1956; 178: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). This hydrophobic side chain initiates a process by which the densely packed deoxyhemoglobin tetramers inside the red blood cells interact through other sites to form long polymer fibers that distort the cells into a characteristic sickle shape. Although the identity of many of these amino acid sites involved in polymer formation and the extent to which they participate is known (3Nagel R.L. Bookchin R.M. Caughey W.S.

Academic Press, New York1974: 51Google Scholar), the quantitative contributions to polymerization of many other sites are unknown. A goal of this study was to provide such information for selected polymerization contact sites for which natural mutants either do not exist or have not been reported. Recombinant sickle double and triple mutants are used for this purpose.Studies describing the hydrophobicity and stereochemistry of deoxy HbS have shown that Val-6(β) binds tightly between Phe-85 and Leu-88 in the acceptor pocket on an adjacent β-chain. According to computer-generated models, the three-dimensional fit of the side chain of Val into the acceptor pocket is much better than that of Ala (7Dickerson R.E. Geis I. Hemoglobin: Structure, Function, Evolution and Pathology. Benjamin Cummings, Reading, MA1983: 133Google Scholar), explaining the inability of Hb Makassar with Ala-6(β) to polymerize (8Nagel R.L. Bookchin R.M. Levere R.D. Sickle Cell Anemia and Other Hemoglobinopathies. Academic Press, New York1974: 51Google Scholar), even though the hydrophobicity of Ala and Val do not differ drastically. Other studies have suggested that substitutions by larger hydrophobic residues at the position 6, readily promote polymerization (9Baudin-Chich V. Pagnier J. Marden M. Cohn B. Loraze N. Kister J. Schaad O. Edelstein S.J. Poyart C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1845-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These findings point out the complexity of the polymerization process, which cannot be explained simply by the hydrophobicity and stereochemistry of the β-6 site and its corresponding acceptor pocket. Indeed, it has been established that other contact sites in the gelation process reinforce the initial contact (3Nagel R.L. Bookchin R.M. Caughey W.S.

In addition, since yeast incorporates its own heme group into globin, there are no time-consuming manipulations, such as reconstituting hemoglobin with exogenous heme. Thus, it is feasible to study the involvement of any site on the hemoglobin molecule in the gelation process and to judge the significance of any differences between the crystal structure (5Padlan E.A.

Chem. 1985; 260: 8280-8291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was significantly involved in the gelation process (12Himanen J.-P. Schneider K. Chait B. Manning J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13885-13891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Indeed, its substitution by Ile inhibits gelation twice as much as a mutation at a site in the acceptor pocket, L88A(β) (6Martin de Llano J.J. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1206-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The diverse locations of these two sites prompted us to design a recombinant Hb having both K95I(β) and L88A(β) in addition to the Val-6(β) mutation in order to measure whether the influence of the two substitutions on gelation is additive. Such a study may reveal important details of the gelation process and could influence efforts for developing well targeted clinically effective inhibitors. For these studies, we employ a new method based on the drastic decrease in the solubility of hemoglobin S upon addition of dextran (20Bookchin R.M. Balazs T. Lew V.L. Blood. 1994; 86: 473aGoogle Scholar).DISCUSSIONIn this study the recombinant triple mutant E6V(β)/L88A(β)/K95I(β) produced in yeast was shown to have the predicted amino acid composition, molecular mass, isoelectric point, and trypsin cleavage sites. Its oxygen affinity, cooperativity, response to negatively charged effectors, alkaline Bohr effect, and the tetramer/dimer dissociation constant were the same as those for HbS. These results, together with extensive characterization of recombinant hemoglobins by a variety of biochemical criteria (15Martin de Llano J.J. Jones W. Schneider K. Chait B.T. Manning J.M.

Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), are consistent with the expression by the yeast system of a native hemoglobin molecule with the correct N-terminal processing. Thus, we have no evidence for any misfolding of the triple mutant as reported for other recombinant hemoglobins made using E. coli as a production host (30Hernan R.A. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26257-26264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Hence, the gelation of the native HbS and the recombinant double and triple mutants by the procedure described here can be taken as reliable measurements of the gelation concentrations.We reported previously that Lys-95(β), which is distant from the hydrophobic pocket in the region of Phe-85(β)-Leu-88(β) comprising the acceptor site for Val-6(β), inhibits gelation much more than the substitution of a residue in the pocket itself (6Martin de Llano J.J. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1206-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 12Himanen J.-P. Schneider K. Chait B. Manning J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13885-13891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Our results agreed with some previous reports implicating Lys-95(β) in the gelation process (33Bookchin R.M. Nagel R.L. Balazs T. Harris J.W. Clin. Res. 1974; 22: 384AGoogle Scholar) and as an intermolecular contact site in the polymer (3Nagel R.L. Bookchin R.M. Caughey W.S. Biochemical and Clinical Aspects of Hemoglobin Abnormalities. Academic Press, New York1978: 195Crossref Google Scholar, 4Watowich S.J. Gross L.J. Josephs R. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), although this site was not involved in the Wishner-Love double strand crystal of deoxy-HbS (5Padlan E.A. Love W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8280-8291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The strong influence of the β-95 site, which is located on the exterior of the tetramer at the lateral contact site of the HbS tetramer, on gelation strongly suggests that the K95I(β) mutant of HbS has different protein self-assembly properties than HbS itself (32Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Embury S.H. Hebbel R.P. Mohandas N. Steinberg M.H. Sickle Cell Disease: Basic Principles and Clinical Practice. Raven Press, New York1994: 53Google Scholar). The role of the Val-6(β) and its hydrophobic acceptor pocket may be to provide a molecular switch to turn the gelation either on or off. If this position is mutated to Ala (Hb Makassar), no gelation occurs because Ala prevents sufficient stabilization of the primary nuclei. Our results on the gelation of E6V(β)/L88A(β) mutant (6Martin de Llano J.J. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1206-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 34Liao D. Martin de Llano J.J. Himanen J.P. Manning J.M. Ferrone F.A. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2442-2447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) also suggest that the Leu to Ala substitution in the acceptor pocket mainly affects the initial nucleation process, but once nucleation has taken place other residues stabilize the polymer. These findings also further emphasize the importance of certain ionizable surface amino acids. Their potential importance as well as that of their complementary sites on adjacent tetramers lies in the possible development of clinical intervention against sickle cell disease. The results presented here demonstrate that two sites on the HbS tetramer exert significantly different and independent effects on the inhibition of polymerization.Since the polymer solubility of the triple mutant was the same as that of the double mutant without the L88A(β) substitution, i.e. E6V(β)/K95I(β), the present results demonstrate that the inhibitory effects of the two β-chain substitutions (L88A and K95I) on HbS, are not additive. Although the L88A(β) mutant, in which the substitution is in the hydrophobic acceptor pocket, has a gelation concentration about midway between the K95I(β) mutant and HbS itself, it does not appear to influence the overall behavior of the triple mutant.The results of recent studies on recombinant mutants are consistent with the notion that once the initial contact site is established by the Glu-6 → Val substitution in the sickle Hb tetramer, then additional substitutions may strengthen or weaken the polymerization tendency. The only previous study involving two β-chain mutations of HbS was by Trudel et al. (13Trudel M. Saadane N. Garel M.-C. Bardakdjian-Michau J. Blouquit Y. Guerquin-Kern J.-L. Rouyer-Fessard P. Vidaud D. Pachnis A. Romeo P.-H. Beuzard Y. Costantini F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3157-3165Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) using a transgenic mouse system, with the purpose of promoting polymerization to obtain a better transgenic mouse model of sickle cell anemia. In that study, there was no quantitation of the individual effects of the substitutions on polymer solubility. The present study was aimed at furthering our understanding of the mechanism of gel formation by inhibiting polymerization and to identify the most important sites that influence the polymerization process significantly. The results indicate that amino acid replacements at Leu-88(β) and Lys-95(β) act independently in inhibiting polymerization, i.e. certain sites can influence the overall prevention of polymerization to a greater extent than others. Such sites might be potentially accessible to anti-sickling agents that could be designed to fit their particular environment as well as that of their complementary binding site on adjacent tetramers. The Lys-95(β) site and the site to which it binds appear to fulfill such criteria. INTRODUCTIONSickle cell anemia results from a single point mutation in the gene encoding β-globin, whereby the Glu-6(β) residue in hemoglobin A (HbA) is substituted by Val in sickle hemoglobin (HbS) (1Pauling L. Itano H. Singer S.J. Wells J.C. Science. 1949; 110: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar, 2Ingram V.M. Nature. 1956; 178: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). This hydrophobic side chain initiates a process by which the densely packed deoxyhemoglobin tetramers inside the red blood cells interact through other sites to form long polymer fibers that distort the cells into a characteristic sickle shape. Although the identity of many of these amino acid sites involved in polymer formation and the extent to which they participate is known (3Nagel R.L. Bookchin R.M. Caughey W.S. Biochemical and Clinical Aspects of Hemoglobin Abnormalities. Academic Press, New York1978: 195Crossref Google Scholar, 4Watowich S.J. Gross L.J. Josephs R. J. Mol.

A goal of this study was to provide such information for selected polymerization contact sites for which natural mutants either do not exist or have not been reported. Recombinant sickle double and triple mutants are used for this purpose.Studies describing the hydrophobicity and stereochemistry of deoxy HbS have shown that Val-6(β) binds tightly between Phe-85 and Leu-88 in the acceptor pocket on an adjacent β-chain. According to computer-generated models, the three-dimensional fit of the side chain of Val into the acceptor pocket is much better than that of Ala (7Dickerson R.E. Geis I. Hemoglobin: Structure, Function, Evolution and Pathology. Benjamin Cummings, Reading, MA1983: 133Google Scholar), explaining the inability of Hb Makassar with Ala-6(β) to polymerize (8Nagel R.L. Bookchin R.M. Levere R.D. Sickle Cell Anemia and Other Hemoglobinopathies. Academic Press, New York1974: 51Google Scholar), even though the hydrophobicity of Ala and Val do not differ drastically. Other studies have suggested that substitutions by larger hydrophobic residues at the position 6, readily promote polymerization (9Baudin-Chich V. Pagnier J. Marden M. Cohn B. Loraze N. Kister J.

These findings point out the complexity of the polymerization process, which cannot be explained simply by the hydrophobicity and stereochemistry of the β-6 site and its corresponding acceptor pocket. Indeed, it has been established that other contact sites in the gelation process reinforce the initial contact (3Nagel R.L. Bookchin R.M. Caughey W.S.

Hence, the gelation of the native HbS and the recombinant double and triple mutants by the procedure described here can be taken as reliable measurements of the gelation concentrations.We reported previously that Lys-95(β), which is distant from the hydrophobic pocket in the region of Phe-85(β)-Leu-88(β) comprising the acceptor site for Val-6(β), inhibits gelation much more than the substitution of a residue in the pocket itself (6Martin de Llano J.J.

The strong influence of the β-95 site, which is located on the exterior of the tetramer at the lateral contact site of the HbS tetramer, on gelation strongly suggests that the K95I(β) mutant of HbS has different protein self-assembly properties than HbS itself (32Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Embury S.H. Hebbel R.P. Mohandas N. Steinberg M.H. Sickle Cell Disease: Basic Principles and Clinical Practice. Raven Press, New York1994: 53Google Scholar). The role of the Val-6(β) and its hydrophobic acceptor pocket may be to provide a molecular switch to turn the gelation either on or off. If this position is mutated to Ala (Hb Makassar), no gelation occurs because Ala prevents sufficient stabilization of the primary nuclei. Our results on the gelation of E6V(β)/L88A(β) mutant (6Martin de Llano J.J. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1206-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 34Liao D. Martin de Llano J.J.

These findings also further emphasize the importance of certain ionizable surface amino acids. Their potential importance as well as that of their complementary sites on adjacent tetramers lies in the possible development of clinical intervention against sickle cell disease. The results presented here demonstrate that two sites on the HbS tetramer exert significantly different and independent effects on the inhibition of polymerization.Since the polymer solubility of the triple mutant was the same as that of the double mutant without the L88A(β) substitution, i.e. E6V(β)/K95I(β), the present results demonstrate that the inhibitory effects of the two β-chain substitutions (L88A and K95I) on HbS, are not additive. Although the L88A(β) mutant, in which the substitution is in the hydrophobic acceptor pocket, has a gelation concentration about midway between the K95I(β) mutant and HbS itself, it does not appear to influence the overall behavior of the triple mutant.The results of recent studies on recombinant mutants are consistent with the notion that once the initial contact site is established by the Glu-6 → Val substitution in the sickle Hb tetramer, then additional substitutions may strengthen or weaken the polymerization tendency. The only previous study involving two β-chain mutations of HbS was by Trudel et al. (13Trudel M. Saadane N. Garel M.-C. Bardakdjian-Michau J. Blouquit Y. Guerquin-Kern J.-L. Rouyer-Fessard P.

In that study, there was no quantitation of the individual effects of the substitutions on polymer solubility. The present study was aimed at furthering our understanding of the mechanism of gel formation by inhibiting polymerization and to identify the most important sites that influence the polymerization process significantly. The results indicate that amino acid replacements at Leu-88(β) and Lys-95(β) act independently in inhibiting polymerization, i.e. certain sites can influence the overall prevention of polymerization to a greater extent than others. Such sites might be potentially accessible to anti-sickling agents that could be designed to fit their particular environment as well as that of their complementary binding site on adjacent tetramers. The Lys-95(β) site and the site to which it binds appear to fulfill such criteria. In this study the recombinant triple mutant E6V(β)/L88A(β)/K95I(β) produced in yeast was shown to have the predicted amino acid composition, molecular mass, isoelectric point, and trypsin cleavage sites. Its oxygen affinity, cooperativity, response to negatively charged effectors, alkaline Bohr effect, and the tetramer/dimer dissociation constant were the same as those for HbS. These results, together with extensive characterization of recombinant hemoglobins by a variety of biochemical criteria (15Martin de Llano J.J. Jones W. Schneider K. Chait B.T. Manning J.M.

Use of the internal start site results in replacement of exons 1 and 2 with a previously undescribed exon and a change in the translational reading frame; thus, the alternative transcript cannot encode α2(I) collagen. We have demonstrated that production of the alternative transcript is due to activation of an internal promoter in chondrocytes and have identified a 179-base pair domain that is required for its activity. Furthermore, we have shown that the alternative transcript resulting from activation of the internal promoter turns over relatively rapidly; thus, the steady-state level of this transcript is less than predicted based on the transcription rate. The upstream promoter is only partially repressed in chondrocytes, suggesting that the lack of authentic α2(I) collagen mRNA may also be due in part to decreased mRNA stability. Thus, repression of α2(I) collagen synthesis in cartilage involves both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. In contrast, repression of α1(I) collagen synthesis appears to be mediated primarily at the level of transcription.

Thus, repression of α2(I) collagen synthesis in cartilage involves both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. In contrast, repression of α1(I) collagen synthesis appears to be mediated primarily at the level of transcription. Normal skeletal development requires precisely regulated expression of the genes encoding type I collagen, the major collagen produced by both prechondrogenic mesenchymal cells and osteoblasts. As mesenchymal cells differentiate into cartilage-producing chondrocytes, they stop producing type I collagen and initiate synthesis of several cartilage-specific collagens (reviewed in 1von der Mark K. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1980; 14: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar and 2von der Mark K. Rheumatology. 1986; 10: 272-315Google Scholar). Type I collagen is a heterotrimer containing two α1(I) and one α2(I) subunits. In cells and tissues that produce type I collagen, the genes encoding these subunits are coordinately regulated (3Hamalainen L. Oikarinen J. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 720-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Olsen A.S. Prockop D.J. Matrix. 1989; 9: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 5de Wet W.J. Chu M.-L. Prockop D.J. J.

We previously identified an unusual molecular mechanism that mediates the cessation of α2(I) collagen production in cartilage. Embryonic chick chondrocytes contain transcripts derived from the α2(I) collagen gene (7Focht R.J. Adams S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1843-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), despite the fact that these cells do not synthesize type I collagen. These transcripts initiate at an internal start site within intron 2 (8Bennett V.D. Weiss I.M. Adams S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8402-8409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bennett V.D. Adams S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2223-2230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rather than at the previously identified site at the beginning of exon 1 (10Vogeli G. Ohkubo H. Sobel M.E. Yamada Y. Pastan I. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5334-5338Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Use of this internal start site results in replacement of exons 1 and 2 with a previously undescribed exon (exon A) and a change in the translational reading frame; this unusual RNA cannot encode α2(I) collagen, since the potential open reading frames are out of frame with the collagen coding sequence. Hereafter we will refer to the transcript initiating at the internal start site as the alternative transcript, in contrast to the authentic α2(I) collagen mRNA, which initiates at the beginning of exon 1 and encodes the α2 subunit of type I collagen. We initially predicted (9Bennett V.D. Adams S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2223-2230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that a developmentally programmed change from the upstream promoter to the presumptive internal promoter for transcription of the α2(I) collagen gene may be responsible for preventing synthesis of α2(I) collagen in chondrocytes. However, in the experiments described below, we demonstrate that repression of α2(I) collagen synthesis in chondrocytes is a complex process involving both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Specifically, we have shown that the appearance of the alternative transcript in chondrocytes is due to activation of an internal promoter in these cells. In contrast, the absence of the authentic α2(I) collagen mRNA in chondrocytes appears to be due only in part to repression of the upstream promoter and may also be due in part to decreased stability of the authentic α2(I) collagen mRNA in these cells. Finally, we have demonstrated that transcription of the α1(I) collagen gene is repressed in chondrocytes; thus, the mechanisms that prevent synthesis of α1(I) and α2(I) collagen in these cells appear to be different. Chondrocytes isolated from lower (caudal) sternal cartilage of 18-day-old chick embryos or from vertebral cartilage of 12-day-old embryos were grown for 5-7 days in suspension culture as described previously (11Adams S.L.

The activity of each construct is expressed as percent acetylation/0.1 A420 unit of β-galactosidase activity and represents the average of three to five independent experiments with cells isolated from different batches of embryos; each construct was assayed in duplicate in each experiment. The activities of various constructs were compared pairwise using an unpaired t test. In control transfections with pCh110, similar transfection efficiencies were observed in chondrocytes and fibroblasts, as determined by in situ staining (26Lim K. Chae C.-B. Biotechniques. 1989; 7: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Furthermore, extracts from equal numbers of chondrocytes and fibroblasts provided similar amounts of β-galactosidase activity, indicating that the SV40 early promoter displays comparable activity in the two cell types. Nuclei were isolated from cultured vertebral chondrocytes and skin fibroblasts, and transcription reactions were performed as described previously (22Adams S.L. Pallante K.M. Niu Z. Leboy P.S.

RNA polymerase II transcription was inhibited by treatment of primary chondrocytes and skin fibroblasts with 1 or 5 μg/ml actinomycin D for varying lengths of time; treatments were initiated at different times, so all cultures were harvested simultaneously and all were in culture for the same length of time. Total cellular RNAs were prepared, and the relative amounts of α2(I) collagen RNA were determined by RNase protection as described above using the probe prepared from pG.α2alt (14Nah H.-D.

Chem. 1990; 265: 2223-2230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that embryonic chick chondrocytes, which do not synthesize type I collagen, contain an alternative transcript of the α2(I) collagen gene in which exons 1 and 2 are replaced by exon A, a previously undescribed exon located within intron 2 (Fig. 1A). In contrast, cells of mesenchymal origin that synthesize type I collagen (including osteoblasts, tendon and skin fibroblasts, skeletal and smooth muscle myoblasts, and prechondrogenic mesenchymal cells) contain the authentic α2(I) collagen mRNA, which initiates at the beginning of exon 1 and encodes the α2(I) subunit of type I collagen. Exon A is spliced out of this mRNA. The cell type-specific nature of these transcripts is illustrated by the RNase protection assay in Fig. 1C, in which a single-stranded RNA probe complementary to a portion of the alternative transcript (diagrammed in Fig. 1B) (14Nah H.-D. Bennett V.D. Niu Z. Adams S.L. Dev. Dynamics. 1996; 206: 146-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) was used to discriminate between the alternative transcript and the authentic α2(I) collagen mRNA. RNA from cultured chondrocytes protects a 216-nucleotide RNA fragment, which includes the exon A sequences, indicating that these cells contain predominantly the alternative transcript. In contrast, RNA from skin fibroblasts protects a 202-nucleotide fragment, excluding the exon A sequences, indicating that these cells contain almost exclusively the authentic α2(I) collagen mRNA. Analysis of many RNA preparations has indicated that the amount of the alternative transcript in chondrocytes is 10-25% of the amount of the authentic α2(I) collagen mRNA in skin fibroblasts (7Focht R.J. Adams S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1843-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 8Bennett V.D. Weiss I.M. Adams S.L. J. Biol.

The presence in chondrocytes of an alternative transcript that appeared to initiate within intron 2 (9Bennett V.D. Adams S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2223-2230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested the presence of an internal promoter in the α2(I) collagen gene that is used preferentially in chondrocytes. The major transcription initiation site in chondrocytes (at +2353) is preceded by an imperfect TATA box (TGTAAA) and a CCAAT box, located 25 and 73 nucleotides, respectively, upstream from the major start site (9Bennett V.D. Adams S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2223-2230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which could comprise elements of such a chondrocyte-specific internal promoter (Fig. 2). To determine whether this is a functional promoter in chondrocytes, a 2266-bp DNA fragment extending from +130 in exon 1 through +2397 in exon A was introduced into the multiple cloning site of the reporter plasmid p0CAT to create the plasmid C1. This plasmid directed a significant level of CAT activity in cultured chondrocytes (Fig. 2), 5.2 times higher than a construct containing the same DNA fragment in the reverse orientation (C1R) (p < 0.001). These results indicate that this DNA fragment constitutes a functional promoter and appears to contain most or all of the sequences that are necessary for expression in these cells. We used convenient restriction sites to construct a series of 5ʹ-end deletion mutants of the internal promoter (Fig. 2, constructs C2-C5), to begin to identify the regions that are important for transcriptional activity in chondrocytes. The promoter domains removed by the successive 5ʹ-end deletions have been designated A-D; domain E, which contains only 65 bp of DNA preceding exon A, including the TATA-like element, is present in all constructs. Deletion of domain A in construct C2 resulted in a statistically significant 2.4-fold increase in CAT activity (p < 0.005), suggesting the presence of a negative element in this region. The additional removal of domain B did not have a significant effect on CAT activity (compare C3 with C2). However, the further removal of domain C (in construct C4) resulted in a 63% decrease in activity relative to C3 (p < 0.05), suggesting the presence of a weak positive element in this domain. When domain D was also removed, a dramatic 95% decrease in activity was observed (p < 0.05; compare C5 with C4), suggesting that this domain contains one or more strong positive elements. Thus, domain D appears to be very important for the function of the internal promoter. We subsequently constructed a series of internal deletions, to examine more precisely the role of domain D in transcriptional activity of the internal promoter. Deletion of domain D alone from the full-length promoter decreased CAT activity by 93% (p < 0.001; compare C6 with C1). The importance of this domain was confirmed by analysis of additional constructs containing various portions of the full-length promoter (C7 and C8); the constructs missing domain D were inactive regardless of which other domains were present. Furthermore, construct C4, which contains only domains D and E, displayed a relatively high level of CAT activity in chondrocytes (comparable to the full-length promoter C1), indicating that domains D and E alone (587 bp) constitute a functional promoter in these cells; the sequence of these domains is shown in Fig. 3. Thus, domain D is not only essential for activity of the internal promoter in chondrocytes, in combination with domain E, it appears to be sufficient for activity in these cells. Since deletion of domain D abolished promoter function in all contexts we examined, and since a promoter containing only domains D and E retained a relatively high level of activity in chondrocytes, we used available restriction sites to construct additional 5ʹ-end deletions of C4, sequentially deleting subdomains D1-D4 (Fig. 4, constructs C9-C11). Deletion of D1 resulted in a decrease in CAT activity (compare construct C9 with C4), suggesting the presence of a positive element in this region; however, the decrease was not statistically significant. Deletion of D2 (compare construct C10 with C9) had no additional effect on CAT activity. However, removal of an additional 179 bp in D3 rendered the promotor inactive, resulting in a 91% decrease in activity (p < 0.02; compare C11 with C10), indicating that subdomain D3 contains one or more elements that are essential for promoter activity in chondrocytes. Construct C11, which contains the CCAAT box (in subdomain D4) and the TATA-like element (in domain E), is inactive, indicating that, while these elements may be important for transcriptional activity, they are clearly not sufficient without additional upstream elements. To determine whether the internal promoter is chondrocyte-specific, we compared the ability of construct C4 to direct CAT activity in chondrocytes with that in skin fibroblasts. The activity of C4 in skin fibroblasts was 4.5 ± 2.6% (n = 4), only 33% of its activity in chondrocytes (shown in Fig. 2), a statistically significant decrease (p < 0.05). Thus, we have demonstrated that the presumptive internal promoter of the α2(I) collagen gene is not only functional, but is also more active in chondrocytes than in fibroblasts, suggesting that its function is cell type-specific. In addition, we have identified a region of 179 bp that is essential for function of the internal promoter in chondrocytes. The RNase protection assay in Fig. 1C demonstrates that the amount of the alternative transcript in chondrocytes is significantly less than the amount of the authentic α2(I) collagen mRNA in skin fibroblasts. This reduced steady-state RNA level could be due to relatively low transcriptional activity of the α2(I) collagen gene in chondrocytes or to reduced stability of the alternative transcript. We used nuclear runoff transcription assays to determine whether the transcriptional activity of the gene was lower in chondrocytes than in skin fibroblasts. Chondrocyte and fibroblast nuclei were pulse-labeled, and equal amounts of radioactive RNA were hybridized to identical slot blots containing genomic clones representing different regions of the α2(I) collagen gene (Table II). The transcription rate of each region of the gene in chondrocytes is expressed relative to the rate in skin fibroblasts, in which the gene is actively transcribed from the upstream promoter to form the authentic α2(I) collagen mRNA. The clones containing exons 5-8, 9-24, 25-31, and 52 provide an estimate of the relative transcription rate throughout the gene, since these exons are present in both the alternative transcript and the authentic α2(I) collagen mRNA. The relative transcription rate in chondrocytes in this experiment ranged from 82 to 112% of the rate in skin fibroblasts, indicating that the overall transcription rate of the α2(I) collagen gene in chondrocytes is similar to that in skin fibroblasts and is much higher than would be predicted based on the steady-state RNA levels shown in Fig. 1C and previously published experiments (7Focht R.J.

Open table in a new tab The relatively high transcription rate of the α2(I) collagen gene in chondrocytes observed in the nuclear runoff transcription assays (Table II) appeared to be inconsistent with the low steady-state level of the alternative transcript in these cells (Fig. 1C), suggesting that transcripts of the α2(I) collagen gene may be less stable in chondrocytes than in fibroblasts. To determine whether decreased RNA stability is in fact responsible for the low level of transcripts derived from the α2(I) collagen gene in chondrocytes, we inhibited RNA polymerase II transcription with actinomycin D and initially used Northern hybridization analysis to determine the amount of RNA remaining at various times after the initiation of drug treatment. In two independent experiments, one of which is shown in Fig. 5A, the half-life of the authentic α2(I) collagen mRNA in skin fibroblasts was about 9 h, similar to the previously reported half-life of this RNA in human skin fibroblasts (3Hamalainen L.

To understand the determinants of the enhancer-promoter interaction in stage-specific regulation, the functional elements of the embryonic chicken ϵ-globin promoter were characterized. In vitro assays demonstrated that: (a) the TATA motif at -30 bound GATA-1, (b) Sp1 bound to an element centered at -54, and (c) both Sp1 and another factor, designated CACCC (which appears related to erythroid Krüppel-like factor, EKLF) bound in the -120 to -128 region. The functions of these motifs were tested using transient expression in embryonic erythroid cells. In the absence of the enhancer, promoter point mutants showed that the TATA, Sp1, and CCAAT motifs (but not the CACCC motif) contributed to promoter activity. In contrast, in the presence of the enhancer, all four motifs (including the CACCC motif) contributed to transcription. Developmental regulation of the enhancer activity was observed, with enhancement decreasing sharply from 185-fold at 4 days (cells expressing ϵ-globin) to 16-fold at 10 days (when ϵ-globin is no longer expressed). Taken together, the data suggest that multiple transcription factors contribute to promoter-enhancer interaction and the developmental regulation of ϵ-globin expression, with EKLF-like factors having an especially important role.

Regulation of stage specificity occurs at the level of enhancer/ϵ-promoter interaction, even in the absence of competition, and is not simply a property of the enhancer or promoter in isolation. Vertebrates express different β-like globin genes at different stages of their development, a process termed gene switching (1Stamatoyannopoulos G. Nienhuis A.W. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Nienhuis A.W.

Biochem. 1995; 231: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). As a result of gene switching, organisms express hemoglobins whose physicochemical properties are adapted to the physiologic requirements of each developmental stage. In the chicken, the embryonic ϵ- and ρ-globin genes are expressed in primitive lineage erythroid cells at days 2-5 of development, while the adult βA- and βH-globins are produced in definitive lineage cells, beginning on embryonic day 5 (3Bruns G.A.P.

The mechanisms responsible for developmental stage-specific expression of globin genes are beginning to be understood. Interaction between the individual globin genes and distant regulatory elements is important for this process.

These hypersensitive sites are important for opening the globin cluster chromatin (5Forrester W.C. Epner E. Driscoll M.C. Enver T. Brice M. Papayannopoulou T. Groudine M.

The LCR is also needed for developmental regulation of the individual globin genes, whose promoters are thought to compete for interaction with the LCR (8Choi O.-R. Engel J.D.

The strength of a distant element's interaction with a particular promoter is determined by the distance between the element and the promoter (12Peterson K.R. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4836-4843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the order of the promoters within the cluster (13Hanscombe O. Whyatt D. Fraser P. Yannoutsos N. Greaves D. Dillon N. Grosveld F.

One mechanistic model of LCR action is that the individual hypersensitive sites form simultaneous binary interactions with different globin promoters (16Engel J.D. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 304-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Elegant evidence that the LCR functionally interacts with only one gene at a time is consistent with a model in which the LCR sites together form a single active complex (17Wijgerde M. Grosveld F.

Comparison of the chicken and human β-like globin clusters should yield important insights into gene cluster regulation. Unlike the human genes, the chicken β-globin genes (5ʹ-ρ-βH-βA-ϵ-3ʹ) are not arranged in order of developmental expression. Also unlike the human cluster, a strong enhancer (the β/ϵ enhancer), with LCR-like properties, is located inside the cluster, between the βA- and ϵ-globin genes (18Choi O.-R. Engel J.D. Nature. 1986; 323: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 19Hesse J.E. Nickol J.M. Lieber M.R. Felsenfeld G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Both the upstream sites and the β/ϵ enhancer contribute to the expression of all the genes in the cluster (21Mason M.M. Lee E. Westphal H. Reitman M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 407-414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, developmental regulation of the β-globin cluster probably evolved independently in the two species (22Czelusniak J. Goodman M. Hewett-Emmett D. Weiss M.L. Venta P.J. Tashian R.E. Nature. 1982; 298: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 23Reitman M. Grasso J.A. Blumenthal R. Lewit P. Genomics. 1993; 18: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although the chicken ρ- and ϵ-globins are expressed simultaneously at similar levels and their proximal promoters are similar, the proposed mechanisms for their regulation are different. Transcription of ρ-globin is largely dependent on a promoter cis-element that binds the GATA-1 transcription factor (24Minie M. Kimura T. Felsenfeld G. Development. 1992; 115: 1149-1164PubMed Google Scholar). The ϵ promoter lacks this GATA site, and ϵ-globin expression is dependent on the β/ϵ enhancer located 2.4 kilobase pairs upstream. To understand more about stage-specific regulation, we have undertaken a detailed characterization of the ϵ-globin promoter and its interaction with the β/ϵ enhancer at different developmental stages. Standard cloning methods were used (25Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J.

Cell. 1989; 58: 877-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) from embryonic chicken erythroid cells were prepared at 4°C with protease inhibitors (0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.5 μg/ml chymostatin) in all solutions. Washed cells were swollen (10 min, 0.67% phosphate-buffered saline), centrifuged, resuspended (109 cells/ml in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT, and protease inhibitors), and homogenized with 12 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer (type B pestle). After centrifugation (25,000 x g, 4°C, 20 min), the pellet was resuspended (1.67 x 109 cells/ml in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, and protease inhibitors). The suspension was homogenized as above, gently stirred for 30 min, centrifuged as above, and the supernatant was dialyzed (6 h, 4°C against 50 volumes of 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, and protease inhibitors). Aliquots (200-500 μl) were frozen on dry ice and stored at -70°C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. DNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dGTP and [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol) using Klenow fragment and gel-purified. Binding reactions (50 μl) containing extract, probe (1-5 ng, ∼50,000 cpm), 1.5 μg of poly(dI·dC), 100 ng of salmon sperm DNA, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4, 5 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors were incubated for 20 min at 23°C. DNase I digestion (2 min, 23°C) was performed with added CaCl2 (3 μl of 1 M) and stopped with 200 μl of 200 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, and 250 μg/ml yeast tRNA. Following phenol:chloroform extraction, the DNA was electrophoresed on an 8% denaturing acrylamide gel. Gel-purified single-strand oligonucleotides were kinased with [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) and annealed with a 50% molar excess of unlabeled complementary strand. Binding reactions (20 μl) containing extract (5-30 μg of protein), probe (10-20 fmol), 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.0125% Triton X-100, 4% Ficoll 400, 0.005% bromphenol blue, 0.005% xylene cyanole FF, and 0.8 μg of poly(dI·dC) were incubated on ice for 15 min and electrophoresed in an 8% acrylamide gel using 10 mM Tris base, 10 mM HEPES, and 1 mM EDTA as running buffer. Competitor oligonucleotides were added prior to addition of extract; antiserum (0.1 μl/reaction) was preincubated with extract (10 min, 4°C) before the binding reaction. Polyclonal anti-Sp1 antiserum was provided by R. Tjian via M. Minie. Methylation interference analysis was performed essentially as described (25Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D.

Construction of pρ726-luciferase, containing the chicken ρ-globin promoter driving luciferase has been described. 2O. Gavrilova, M. M. Mason, and M. Reitman, submitted for publication. The 5ʹ UTR of the chicken ϵ-globin gene was marked by insertion of 40-bp (5ʹ-CGAGTAGATTCGAGCTCGGTGACCGGGGATCCTCTAGAGT) between bases 20332 and 20333. The insert did not alter luciferase expression (Fig. 1). Mutations were introduced into the ϵ promoter by site-directed mutagenesis (29Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) (Transformer kit, Clontech), and all mutated regions were sequenced. The ϵ promoter DNA was from pϵ2cat (30Nickol J.M.

The wild type and mutated NcoI fragments (19795-20347; from 510 bp upstream of the ϵ cap site to the initiator codon) were individually inserted into the promoterless, enhancerless pGL2-Basic plasmid (Promega), fusing the ϵ and luciferase initiator codons (this involved prior conversion of the luciferase initiation codon to a NcoI site). The unmutated version is designated ϵ510 (p1291). The mutated plasmids are named using the base number of the 3ʹ-most base in the mutation. Our laboratory designations for these plasmids are: m25, p1292; m31, p1293; m33, p1294; m52, p1295; m74, p1296; m89, p1297; m111, p1537; m111c, p1298; m120, p1299; m123, p1300; m124, p1536; m124c, p1301; and m143, p1302. Deletion plasmids are named for the most upstream base of the ϵ promoter that is still present. ϵ73 (p1307) was produced by BglII digestion of m74 followed by ligation. ϵ142 (p1309) was produced from m143 by HindIII digestion, Klenow fill-in, StuI digestion, and ligation. To produce ϵ51 (p1306) and ϵ88 (p1308), the ϵ promoter HpaI/NcoI fragments (from m52 and m89, respectively) were inserted into the modified pGL2-Basic between the SmaI and NcoI (initiation codon) sites. The β/ϵ enhancer was added to the promoter mutants by including contiguous upstream DNA to -3.2 kilobase pairs (to the HindIII site at 17074 in L17432, which is in intron 2 of the βA gene). In the cloning process, 41 bases of vector DNA were introduced at the -510 NcoI site. The deletion mutants with the enhancer are internal deletions; they contain from -3229 to -510 linked to the indicated base of the ϵ promoter. Our laboratory designations for these plasmids are: ϵ3229, p1353; m25Enh, p1354; m31Enh, p1384; m33Enh, p1385; m52Enh, p1386; m74Enh, p1387; m89Enh, p1388; m111Enh, p1541; m111cEnh, p1389; m120Enh, p1390; m123Enh, p1391; m124Enh, p1542; m124cEnh, p1392; m143Enh, p1393; ϵ73Enh, p1405; and ϵ142Enh, p1394. Plasmids ϵ51Enh (p1306) and ϵ88Enh (p1308) were generated by HindIII digestion of p1353 (wild type with enhancer), Klenow fill-in, EcoRI digestion and insertion of the 730-bp HpaI-EcoRI fragment of p1295 (m52) or the 765-bp HpaI-EcoRI fragment of p1297 (m89). Transient transfection in erythroid cells from 4-, 5-, and 6-day chicken embryos was performed essentially as described previously (19Hesse J.E. Nickol J.M. Lieber M.R. Felsenfeld G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4312-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 32Lieber M.R. Hesse J.E. Nickol J.M. Felsenfeld G. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1055-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Typically, 125 ng of luciferase reporter plasmid and 125 ng of RSV-cat control plasmid were transfected into 3 A412 units of cells using osmotic shock. Transient expression in 10-day erythroid cells was performed by electroporation. Cells (108 in 0.5 ml of L-15 medium) were mixed with 2.5 μg of RSV-cat and 10 μg of test plasmid. After 5 min at room temperature, the cells were electroporated (0.4-cm cuvette, 500 microfarads, 450 V, giving a τ of ∼9 ms) using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser. The cells were cultured with 1.4 ml of complete medium at 37°C for 40-48 h, as described for the cells transfected by osmotic shock. Luciferase activity was measured (Luciferase Assay System, Promega), normalized to the activity from the RSV-cat (33Neuman J.R. Morency C.A. Russion K.O. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 444-449Google Scholar) internal control, and expressed as a percent of the wild type promoter activity in the same assay. The assay background was determined from transfections with pBluescriptIISK- and was ≤1% of the ϵ510 level. Plasmids were assayed in duplicate in at least three independent experiments. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. In embryos, ϵ- and ρ-globin are strongly expressed and at similar levels (see 21Mason M.M. Lee E. Westphal H. Reitman M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 407-414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). To compare the promoter strength of these genes independent of distant elements, we transfected plasmids carrying a luciferase reporter driven by the ρ or ϵ promoter into 4-day erythroid cells. We expected that ϵ expression in the absence of the β/ϵ enhancer would be much lower than ρ expression. However, the enhancerless constructs were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 1). Inclusion of the β/ϵ enhancer in the ϵ construct greatly stimulated ϵ expression (Fig. 1). To identify potential regulatory elements in the ϵ-globin promoter, in vitro DNase I footprinting was performed using nuclear extracts from embryonic blood cells. Protected regions included the non-canonical TATA box located at bases -24 to -33, a GC-rich, Sp1-like motif (bases -51 to -66), and a distal region (-115 to -142) that contained CACCC/Sp1-like motifs (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Footprints were also detected in two regions of the promoter (bases -86 and -105 and -155 to -183), which contained no readily identified consensus sites. No footprint was evident in the region of the CCAAT box (-77 to -73). There were no apparent differences between the footprints obtained with primitive versus definitive extracts.Fig. 3The chicken ϵ-globin promoter. The ϵ promoter is shown in uppercase letters, numbered relative to the transcription start site. Footprinted regions are indicated by double underlines of the appropriate strand, and hypersensitive sites are depicted by arrows.

Like many other globins, the ϵ promoter contains a GATA motif in place of a canonical TATA box. When this region was used as a probe (oligonucleotide A), a specific complex with the mobility of cGATA-1 bound to DNA was formed (Fig. 4, lanes 1-6). Mutation of the TATA element (G → T at -33, oligonucleotide Am33) destroyed the GATA motif and prevented formation of the GATA-1·DNA complex (Fig. 4, lanes 7-10). These results indicate that the cGATA-1 protein binds to the GATA/TATA motif of the ϵ promoter. Oligonucleotide B, spanning the GC-rich, Sp1-like region immediately upstream of the TATA box (Fig. 3), yielded a band with the mobility and binding specificity of an Sp1·DNA complex (Fig. 4, lanes 11-19). Antibody to Sp1 inhibited formation of this complex (Fig. 4, lanes 20-22). These data demonstrate that this region of the ϵ promoter can bind Sp1 (or an antigenically related protein). Oligonucleotide E corresponds to the protected region of the promoter containing EKLF/CACCC-like (34Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 35Hartzog G.A. Myers R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 44-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Sp1-like sequence motifs and yielded two distinct complexes in mobility shift assays (Fig. 5A). The slower migrating complex had the mobility of Sp1 bound to probe; its formation was competed by an authentic Sp1 oligonucleotide, by oligonucleotide B (shown above to contain an Sp1 site), and by antibodies to Sp1. In contrast, the faster migrating complex was not competed by Sp1 oligonucleotides or antibodies to Sp1. These results demonstrate that this region binds two distinct factors in the erythroid nuclear extracts; the slower complex is due to Sp1 (or a related factor that is indistinguishable by antibody reactivity and binding site specificity), while the faster migrating band is not due to Sp1 and is here designated CACCC. Methylation interference analysis was used to analyze the Sp1- and CACCC-binding region further (Fig. 5B). Methylation of guanosine residues at positions -124, -125, -126, -128, -130, and -131 inhibited binding of the CACCC factor. Methylation of these same residues inhibited Sp1 binding, as did methylation of an additional guanosine at -120. Substitution of bases -123 to -126 (CCCT → GTAC; Eʹm124c) prevented binding of CACCC with little effect on Sp1 (Fig. 5C, lanes 6, 7, and 10-15). Mutation at -120 (C → A; Eʹm120) reduced Sp1 binding but had little effect on CACCC binding (Fig. 5C, lanes 8, 9, and 16-21). These data demonstrate that Sp1 binds to a motif that overlaps, but is distinct from, that bound by CACCC. The CACCC motif centered at -128 of the chicken ϵ-globin promoter is a perfect match (CCACACCCT) to the EKLF-binding sequence of certain mammalian globin promoters (34Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 35Hartzog G.A. Myers R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 44-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the methylation interference pattern of CACCC is identical to that reported for murine EKLF (36Feng W.C. Southwood C.M. Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1493-1500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we examined binding of recombinant murine EKLF to this region (Fig. 5D). EKLF formed a complex with oligonucleotide Eʹ (the wild type chicken sequence) that comigrated with EKLF bound to the classical murine βmaj-globin promoter site. The point mutation, which inhibited Sp1 binding but not CACCC complex formation (Eʹm120), did not significantly affect EKLF binding. Conversely, the mutation that abolished CACCC binding with little effect on Sp1 (Eʹm124c) did abolish EKLF binding. These data suggest that the faster migrating complex (designated CACCC) in chicken erythroid extracts may be due to a chicken homologue of EKLF or to a closely related protein. Despite the presence of footprints in at -86 to -105 and -155 to -183, no mobility shifts were observed with oligonucleotides comprising these regions of the ϵ-globin promoter (data not shown). Under the conditions used, the CCAAT box probe (oligonucleotide C) did not produce a protein-DNA complex (Fig. 4, lanes 23-28), a result consistent with our failure to detect a footprint at this site. In summary, the protein binding studies have identified cGATA-1 binding to the TATA box centered at -30 and an Sp1 binding site at -54. The region at -120 to -131 has overlapping binding sites for Sp1 and CACCC, an EKLF-like factor. Under the assay conditions used, no protein binding was observed to the CCAAT box at -75. To examine the functionally important regions of the ϵ-globin promoter, a series of deletion mutants were tested with and without the β/ϵ enhancer. In reporter plasmids lacking the enhancer (Fig. 6, solid bars), deletion upstream of -142 did not reduce expression. Deletion to -88, removing the CACCC/Sp1 element, reduced activity 2- to 5-fold in the primitive cells but to a lesser extent in definitive cells. Deletion to -73, destroying the CCAAT motif, and to -51, ablating the Sp1 site, each reduced expression further. These data suggest that full promoter activity resides in the proximal 142 bp of promoter. To examine the effect of the enhancer on ϵ-globin expression, plasmids containing the enhancer (as a 2.7-kilobase pair fragment, from -3229 to -510) was cloned upstream of the various promoter deletions. Constructs containing at least 73 bp of promoter showed strong enhancement (Fig. 6, open bars; note the different scales), suggesting that the proximal 73 bp of the ϵ-globin promoter is sufficient for productive interaction with the enhancer. The decrease in ϵ-globin transcription that occurs with development could be due to diminished enhancer activity or to diminished promoter activity. Promoter activity, in the absence of the enhancer, was comparable in erythroid cells from days 4-6 (Fig. 6). (Because different methods were used to transfect the 10-day cells, the data from that stage cannot be compared directly with the results from primitive cells.) To examine the role of the enhancer, enhancer activity (defined as the ratio of activity of constructs containing the promoter and enhancer to those with the promoter only) for each of the promoter deletions was plotted as a function of the age of the cells used for transfection (Fig. 7). In the four promoter constructs containing at least 73 bp of promoter, the average enhancement was 185-, 66-, 18-, and 16-fold for expression in 4-, 5-, 6-, and 10-day cells, respectively. These data suggest that the decrease in ϵ-globin expression with development is due to a decrease in the effect of the enhancer on the ϵ promoter, and not to a decrease in intrinsic ϵ promoter activity. We next studied the effect of clustered point mutations on transcription from the ϵ-globin promoter in chicken erythroid cells (Fig. 8). Sequencing of the mutated constructs revealed a T at -123 in our parent construct, rather than the reported C (31Dodgson J.B. Stadt S.J. Choi O.-R. Dolan M. Fischer H.D. Engel J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12685-12692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, introduction of the C into several constructs showed no difference in expression in the absence of the enhancer (compare m123c versus ϵ510, m111c versus m111, and m124c versus m124). When not otherwise noted, the sequence is a T at this position. In the absence of the enhancer, mutation of the TATA site (m25, m31), of the Sp1 motif (m52), or the CCAAT box (m74) reduced promoter activity. Interestingly, mutation of sites farther upstream than the CCAAT box did not affect expression levels. In addition, conversion of the TATA site from a GATA to a canonical TATA (m33) had no significant effect on ϵ expression. In plasmids containing the enhancer, like those without the enhancer, point mutations in the TAT"

Brandsch R. Biofactors. 1991; 3: 69-81PubMed Google Scholar). Formation of the histidyl(N3)-(8α)FAD bond proceeds autocatalytically and depends on a flavinylation-competent conformation of the protein (2Brandsch R. Bichler V. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 8016-8022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The autocatalytic nature of the process opens the possibility to bind FAD derivatives to the active site His71 of the enzyme in a spontaneous reaction. One aim of the present work was to test this assumption with in vitro synthesized apoenzyme, N6-(2-aminoethyl)-FAD, and N6-(6-carboxyhexyl)-FAD (4Bückmann A.F. Erdmann H. Pietzsch M. Hall J.M. Bannister J.V. Yagi K. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1993: 597Google Scholar) and to establish how these substitutions affect folding and enzyme activity of the protein. A second aim was to use the protein-bound flavin derivatives as probes in an attempt to determine whether the increase in size and charge of the FAD moiety affects mitochondrial import of 6-HDNO supplied with a mitochondrial targeting sequence. Incorporation of FAD into the flavin-binding domain of 6-HDNO induces a conformational change in the trypsin-sensitive apoenzyme that renders the holoenzyme trypsin-resistant (5Brandsch R. Bichler V. Krauss B. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). 2M. Stoltz and R. Brandsch, unpublished observations. Based on this observation, we used 6-HDNO as a model flavoenzyme to approach a third aspect in this work, namely whether the FAD-stabilized trypsin-resistant conformation of holo-6-HDNO requires functionally active mtHsp70 for its unfolding during mitochondrial import. To address this question, we took advantage of the recently described Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial mutants ssc1-2 with a defect in the unfoldase activity of mtHsp70 and ssc1-3 deficient in both mtHsp70 unfoldase and translocase activity (6Gambill D. Voos W. Kang P.J. Miao B. Langer T. Craig E.A. Pfanner N. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 3288-3296Google Scholar, 7Voos W. von Ahsen O. Müller H. Guiard B. Rassow J. Pfanner N.

We have shown previously that an N-terminal fusion of 6-HDNO with the mitochondrial targeting sequence of dimethylglycine dehydrogenase is efficiently imported into rat liver mitochondria (3Stoltz M. Rysavy P. Kalousek F. Brandsch R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8016-8022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, the rat mitochondrial targeting sequence did not support import of 6-HDNO into yeast mitochondria.2 Therefore, an N-terminal fusion of 6-HDNO to the mitochondrial presequence of Neurospora crassa F0-ATPase subunit 9 (8Pfanner N.

Here we show that the fusion protein Su9-6-HDNO, when translated in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RL), spontaneously incorporated N6-(2-aminoethyl)-FAD and N6-(6-carboxyhexyl)-FAD and folded into a trypsin-resistant, enzymatically active conformation. The fusion protein with attached flavins was imported into yeast mitochondria where it was refolded in the matrix into the trypsin-resistant form; however, when imported as apoenzyme, that is without bound FAD, it was unable to adopt in the mitochondrial matrix the trypsin-resistant conformation characteristic of the holoenzyme. The trypsin-resistant, flavin-stabilized fusion protein was imported into ssc1-2 mutant yeast mitochondria deficient in mtHsp70 unfoldase activity but was trapped as translocation intermediate in ssc1-3 mitochondria deficient in mtHsp70 unfoldase and translocase activity. The protein blocked in transit through the translocation channel became trypsin sensitive indicating that it was unfolded. Our results demonstrate that unfolding of the flavin domain of 6-HDNO did not require the activity of mtHsp70. All chemicals were of the highest quality available. Restriction endonucleases, DNA ligase, Taq DNA polymerase, and SP6 RNA-polymerase were from Boehringer (Mannheim, Germany). The rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro transcription-translation kit was from Promega (Madison, WI). The synthesis of N6-(2-aminoethyl)-FAD and N6-(6-carboxyhexyl)-FAD was performed as described in 4Bückmann A.F. Erdmann H. Pietzsch M. Hall J.M. Bannister J.V. Yagi K. Flavins and Flavoproteins.

The amplified DNA was restricted with HindIII, the DNA fragment inserted into pSPT20-6-HDNO (3Stoltz M. Rysavy P. Kalousek F. Brandsch R. J. Biol.

Transcription was coupled to translation in the rabbit RL system in the presence of [35S]Met at 30°C for 2 h. Holoenzyme formation with covalent incorporation of flavins was performed in RL supplemented with either 10 μM FAD, N6-(2-aminoethyl)-FAD, or N6-(6-carboxyhexyl)-FAD; following translation, the assays were incubated in the presence of 10 mM glycerol-3-P for an additional 60 min. The addition of glycerol-3-P to the transcription-translation assays stopped any further translation of the fusion protein during the 60-min incubation period. Folding of the 6-HDNO partner of the fusion protein into the protease-resistant conformation of the holoenzyme was tested by trypsin treatment (200 μg/ml) of the transcription-translation assay for 15 min at 0°C. 6-HDNO activity of the Su9-6-HDNO fusion protein translated in the RL was determined according to M÷hler et al. (9M÷hler H. Brühmüller M. Decker K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 29: 152-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Isolation of S. cerevisiae mitochondria was performed as described previously (10Daum G. B÷hni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol.

Protein import into isolated mitochondria was performed in bovine serum albumin-containing buffer (250 mM sucrose, 3% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 80 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MOPS/KOH, pH 7.2) including 2 mM ATP, 2 mM NADH, and 70 μg of mitochondrial protein/0.2 ml. Import reactions were performed at 25°C for 20 min. Mitochondria were reisolated by centrifugation at 15,000 x g for 10 min at 4°C. Samples were treated with trypsin (200 μg/ml) for 15 min at 0°C where indicated. Trypsin was inactivated by the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor (4 mg/ml). After a washing step with buffer SEM (250 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM MOPS/KOH, pH 7.2), the pelleted mitochondria were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Subfractionation of mitochondria was done by sonication at 100 watts for 3 x 30 s at 0°C. The purity of the submitochondrial fractions was tested by Western blot with the aid of antibodies specific for a marker protein of the mitochondrial inner membrane. 6-HDNO Expressed in the Rabbit RL—Fusion of the 66-amino acid long Su9 presequence to the N terminus of 6-HDNO resulted in a protein with an Mr of 56,000. In vitro expression of the fusion protein in the rabbit RL gave rise to a main translation product and a slightly smaller molecular species which may arise from translation of a prematurely terminated RNA transcript (Fig. 1A, lane 1). Both 6-HDNO species were trypsin-sensitive (Fig. 1A, lane 2) indicating that they represented apoenzyme (5Brandsch R. Bichler V. Krauss B. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). When transcription-translation was performed in RL supplemented with 10 μM FAD and incubation continued in the presence of glycerol-3-P, an allosteric effector that stimulates flavinylation of 6-HDNO in vitro (2Brandsch R. Bichler V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19056-19062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) trypsin digestion resulted in a protease-resistant species of the size of the native enzyme (Fig. 1A lanes 3 and 4). Apparently trypsin removed the mitochondrial presequence from the fusion protein. The protease-resistant 6-HDNO molecule exhibited enzyme activity demonstrating that it represented holoenzyme (Fig. 1B). 6-HDNO into Yeast Mitochondria—Incubation of the [35S]Met-labeled fusion protein translated as apoenzyme in the absence of FAD with isolated yeast mitochondria resulted in import and processing of the precursor by the mitochondrial processing peptidase, as demonstrated by the protection of the intramitochondrially located protein from externally added trypsin (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). Dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential δΨ prevented, as expected, import and thus protection of the Su9-6-HDNO apoform from trypsin digestion (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4). The conformation of the imported protein inside the mitochondrial matrix was tested by separating the mitochondria into membranes and soluble fraction. Treatment of the soluble fraction with trypsin revealed that the imported and processed Su9-6-HDNO apoenzyme did not fold into the protease-resistant conformation of the holoenzyme in the mitochondrial matrix (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 5 and 6). Incubation of Su9-6-HDNO holoenzyme with isolated yeast mitochondria resulted in the import of the covalently flavinylated protein (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2). Dissipation of the membrane potential blocked protein import (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4). However, although different from what was observed with the apoenzyme, trypsin treatment cleaved the presequence and released the 6-HDNO fusion partner from its nonspecific association with the mitochondrion. The released 6-HDNO domain maintained its trypsin-resistant conformation and was released into the supernatant (not shown). Fractionation of mitochondria following import of the Su9-6-HDNO holoenzyme revealed that the imported, flavinylated protein adopted a protease-resistant conformation inside the matrix. Recovery of nonspecifically bound preprotein was excluded by protease treatment of the mitochondria prior to fractionation (compare Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 4). Apparently, the holoenzyme with covalently attached FAD was refolded inside the mitochondrial matrix into its native conformation (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 6). 6-HDNO—Two FAD derivatives were tested for the feasibility of their autocatalytic incorporation into Su9-6-HDNO, namely N6-(2-aminoethyl)-FAD and N6-(6-carboxyhexyl)-FAD (Fig. 3). To this end [35S]Met-labeled Su9-6-HDNO was translated in the RL in the presence of the FAD derivatives followed by incubation with glycerol-3-P. Trypsin digestion of the translation assays revealed that similar to control assays performed with FAD, a protease-resistant 6-HDNO molecular species was formed (Fig. 4A). This processed trypsin-resistant protein corresponded to the 6-HDNO holoenzyme form and indicated that the flavin derivatives did not prevent folding of the enzyme into its native conformation. This assumption was confirmed by 6-HDNO activity measurements as shown in Fig. 4B. Both FAD derivatives supported enzyme activity levels 50-60% of that of the 6-HDNO holoenzyme generated with FAD. Enzyme activity was due to covalently attached FAD and FAD derivatives since noncovalently bound FAD results in enzyme activity with altered kinetic parameters (12Mauch L. Bichler V. Brandsch R. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 86-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).Fig. 4Trypsin resistance and enzyme activity of Su9-6-HDNO with attached FAD derivatives. A, coupled transcription-translation was performed in RL supplemented with FAD (lane 1), N6-(2-aminoethyl)-FAD (AE-FAD) (lane 3), or N6-(6-carboxyhexyl)-FAD (C6-FAD) (lane 5), followed by incubation with glycerol-3-P and digestion with trypsin (lanes 2, 4, and 6); shown is the autoradiography of the [35S]Met-labeled translation products separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% polyacrylamide gel.

[35S]Met-labeled Su9-6-HDNO with bound FAD derivatives was incubated with mitochondria and tested for import by trypsin digestion. As can be seen in Fig. 5A, both modified forms of the fusion protein were protected from digestion indicating they were intramitochondrially located. As in the case of holoenzyme and although different from apoenzyme, the imported and processed fusion proteins with bound FAD derivatives refolded in the mitochondrial matrix into a trypsin-resistant conformation (Fig. 5B). However, protease treatment resulted in a protein double band (Fig. 5B, lanes 2 and 4). The conformation of the refolded 6-HDNO carrying the attached N6-modified FAD derivatives apparently exposes in some of the protein molecules a trypsin recognition site that is shielded in the FAD-containing holoenzyme. At this site, a short peptide may have been removed from the protein. 6-HDNO Carrying FAD and FAD Derivatives into Yeast Mutant Mitochondria with Impaired mtHsp70 Functions—Two temperature-sensitive mtHsp70 mutants were employed. For ssc1-2, which is deficient in unfolding activity of mtHsp70, mitochondria import only completely unfolded precursor proteins; and for ssc1-3, impaired in both the unfolding as well as the translocating function of mtHsp70, mitochondria do not import precursor proteins into the mitochondrial matrix (6Gambill D. Voos W. Kang P.J. Miao B. Langer T. Craig E.A. Pfanner N. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 3288-3296Google Scholar, 13Kang P.J. Ostermann J. Shilling J. Neupert W. Craig E.A. Pfanner N. Nature. 1990; 348: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). With the aid of these mutants, it should be possible to answer the following questions. 1) Is the FAD-binding domain of the 6-HDNO holoenzyme unfolded during import, or does it prevent translocation. Is unfolding of the domain dependent on a functional mtHsp70? 2) Does the increase in size and charge of the FAD moiety affect the efficiency of holoenzyme import with attached FAD derivatives into mitochondria with impaired mtHsp70 function? The experimental results presented in Fig. 6A, demonstrate that holo-Su9-6-HDNO formed with FAD and N6-substituted FAD derivatives was imported into ssc1-2 mutant mitochondria (compare Fig. 6A, lanes 2, 4, and 6). Apparently translocation did not require the unfolding activity of mtHsp70. The increase in size and charge of the cofactor molecule did not seem to significantly influence the import of the flavinylated molecules. ssc1-3 mitochondria processed the precursor (Fig. 6B, lanes 1, 3, and 5) but were unable to import the Su9-6-HDNO fusion proteins into the mitochondrial matrix as indicated by the accessibility of the protein to trypsin (Fig. 6B, lanes 2, 4, and 6). Processing of the precursor implies that the presequence was passed through the import pore and was accessible to the mitochondrial processing peptidase. The remaining polypeptide was sequestered as a membrane-spanning translocation intermediate in the import pore (14Rassow J. Hartl F.-U. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Neupert W. FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Since it was sensitive to trypsin digestion, the protease-resistant native conformation of the holoenzyme must have been unfolded during the insertion of the fusion protein into the translocation pore. A quantification of the processing efficiency of the different Su9-6-HDNO forms is presented in Table I. The data reveal that there was no significant difference in processing efficiency of apo-Su9-6-HDNO and Su9-6-HDNO stabilized by FAD, and N6-substituted FAD derivatives into wild type and ssc1-2 mutant mitochondria. ssc1-3 mitochondria showed a somewhat reduced efficiency in processing when compared with wild type and ssc1-2 mitochondria. The strongest reduction in processing efficiency of about 50% of wild type and ssc1-2 mitochondria was observed with ssc1-3 mitochondria and Su9-6-HDNO with bound FAD. Processing of Su9-6-HDNO with bound N6-(2-aminoethyl)-FAD and N6-(6-carboxyhexyl)-FAD into ssc1-3 mitochondria proceeded with an efficiency similar to that of the apoenzyme.Table IEfficiency of Su9-6HDNO processing by S. cerevisiae wild-type, ssc1-2, and ssc1-3 mitochondriaWild typessc1-2ssc1-3%%%-FAD495245+FAD586330+AE-FAD505040+C6-FAD505042 Open table in a new tab The autocatalytic nature of the flavinylation reaction of 6-HDNO opens the possibility to bind flavin derivatives covalently to the active site of the enzyme. The results presented in this study demonstrate that N6-substituted FAD derivatives may indeed be covalently attached to the protein. Since covalent attachment of FAD seems to proceed in other enzymes by autoflavinylation too (15Kim J. Fuller J.H. Cecchini G. McIntire W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6349-6361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Scrutton N.S. Packman L.C. Mathews F.S. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9526-9531Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), this approach of modifying proteins of this flavoenzyme group may have general applicability. The crystal structure of 6-HDNO has not yet been solved. Therefore the position of the N6 amino group in the protein structure is not known. From the observations that folding of the enzyme into the trypsin-resistant conformation characteristic for the holoenzyme is not prevented in the presence of the N6-(2-aminoethyl)-FAD and N6-(6-carboxyhexyl)-FAD and that the FAD derivatives support 6-HDNO activity, we conclude that the extension at the N6 position and the additional positive or negative charge at this site do not interact with essential functional groups of the enzyme. As with other flavoproteins (18Karplus P.A. Daniels M.J. Herriott J.R. Science. 1991; 251: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 19Kim J.J.P. Wang M. Paschke R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7523-7527Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), the adenine moiety of FAD may be exposed at the surface of 6-HDNO making this site suitable for the attachment of fluorescent groups or cross-linkers as molecular markers in the cellular interactions of the enzyme during compartmentation, folding by chaperones, and degrading by proteases (4Bückmann A.F. Erdmann H. Pietzsch M. Hall J.M. Bannister J.V. Yagi K. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1993: 597Google Scholar). The reduced 6-HDNO activity with N6-substituted FAD derivatives as compared with the FAD-containing enzyme is in line with the results of reconstitution experiments performed with apo-NADH oxidase and N6-(2-aminoethyl)-FAD (4Bückmann A.F. Erdmann H. Pietzsch M. Hall J.M. Bannister J.V. Yagi K. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1993: 597Google Scholar). This enzyme contains loosely bound FAD, which makes the preparation of apoenzyme convenient. The N6-(2-aminoethyl)-FAD-reconstituted enzyme showed an increased Km value, which may indicate a sterically somewhat hindered alignment of the N6-(2-aminoethyl) moiety in the adenine part of the FAD-binding site of the protein (4Bückmann A.F. Erdmann H. Pietzsch M. Hall J.M. Bannister J.V. Yagi K. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1993: 597Google Scholar). Mitochondrial precursor proteins seem to be maintained in the cytosol in an import-competent loosely folded conformation by cellular chaperones. There have been specialized presequence-binding proteins described that inhibit folding of the precursor protein and participate in its targeting to the mitochondrial compartment (20Hartl F.-U. Neupert W. Science. 1990; 247: 930-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The 6-HDNO partner of the Su9-6-HDNO fusion, however, was folded and flavinylated in the RL. This observation confirms the finding that the mitochondrial presequence does not prevent the folding of 6-HDNO made previously with a fusion of the mitochondrial presequence of dimethylglycine dehydrogenase and 6-HDNO (3Stoltz M. Rysavy P. Kalousek F. Brandsch R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8016-8022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A similar observation has been made with a fusion of the Su9 presequence and dihydrofolate reductase (21Voos W. Gambill B.D. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Craig E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence joining the presequence and 6-HDNO may be flexible and allow folding of 6-HDNO. This may be different with some authentic mitochondrial precursor proteins. Why the rat mitochondrial presequence of dimethylglycine dehydrogenase did not support the import of the fusion protein into yeast mitochondria is unknown, but such a functional incompatibility between mammalian and yeast presequences has been observed before (22Zara V. Palmieri F. Mahlke K. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12077-12081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Import of mitochondrial precursor proteins requires an unfolded conformation although the extent of secondary structural elements preserved by various precursors during their passage into the organelle is not well established. There is indirect evidence suggesting an extended conformation of the polypeptides in transit (14Rassow J. Hartl F.-U. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Neupert W. FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Unfolding as a prerequisite for import is supported by experimental data showing that stabilization of the native protein conformation prevents its translocation across the mitochondrial membrane (for a review, see 20Hartl F.-U. Neupert W. Science. 1990; 247: 930-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The driving force responsible for the translocation of the polypeptide through the import pore was associated with mtHsp70 to which an unfoldase and a translocase function have been ascribed (6Gambill D. Voos W. Kang P.J. Miao B. Langer T. Craig E.A. Pfanner N. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 3288-3296Google Scholar). It was shown that a fusion protein consisting of cytochrome b2 with assembled heme-binding domain fused to dihydrofolate reductase is imported into wild type yeast mitochondria but not into mitochondria of the ssc1-2 mutant deficient in mtHsp70 unfoldase activity (21Voos W. Gambill B.D. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Craig E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). ssc1-2 mitochondria, however, import the urea-unfolded fusion protein (21Voos W. Gambill B.D. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Craig E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Although different from what was shown for the heme-binding domain, the import of Su9-6-HDNO that had been previously folded into the enzymatically active 6-HDNO conformation with an assembled FAD domain did not require the unfoldase activity of mtHsp70. The FAD domain of 6-HDNO may be less stable than the heme domain of cytochrome b2 or the methotrexate-stabilized dihydrofolate-binding domain of dihydrofolate reductase (6Gambill D. Voos W. Kang P.J. Miao B. Langer T. Craig E.A. Pfanner N. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 3288-3296Google Scholar, 21Voos W. Gambill B.D. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Craig E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Depending on the conformational stability of a protein, the mechanisms responsible for its unfolding during translocation into the mitochondrion may differ. Interestingly, only imported 6-HDNO with attached FAD or N6-substituted FAD derivatives was able to refold in the matrix into the protease-resistant conformation but not imported apoenzyme. Thus folding of 6-HDNO into the native, protease-resistant conformation requires the presence of the cofactor. Apparently, incorporation of FAD is accompanied by a conformational change in the protein and stabilizes the native conformation; glycerol-3-P instead seems to be required for the formation of the covalent His-FAD bond. The inability of the imported apoenzyme to fold into the protease-resistant conformation may be explained by the absence of the allosteric effector molecule glycerol-3-P required for FAD binding from the matrix (3Stoltz M. Rysavy P. Kalousek F. Brandsch R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8016-8022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The two protease-resistant species obtained by trypsin digestion of the matrix-imported and refolded 6-HDNO carrying the N6-FAD derivatives may indicate that they exhibit a slightly different conformation from that of the FAD-containing enzyme. This observation may be seen in relation to the lower activity of the enzyme reconstituted with the FAD derivatives as compared with the enzyme reconstituted with FAD. The import experiments performed with mitochondria unable to import precursor proteins due to unfoldase and translocase deficient mtHsp70 demonstrate that unfolding of the protease-resistant 6-HDNO holoenzyme portion of the fusion protein takes place following insertion of the precursor into the import pore. This seems sufficient to induce the unfolding of the 6-HDNO fusion partner located outside the translocation channel. Recently it was shown with the aid of a purified outer mitochondrial membrane vesicle system that unfolding of the mature dihydrofolate reductase fused to the presequence of Su9 or cytochrome b2 is accomplished by components of the outer membrane translocation pore (23Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. Cell. 1995; 80: 127-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Binding to the trans site of the translocation pore was accompanied by the unfolding of parts of the mature protein immediately following the presequence. Such a mechanism may also account for the observed unfolding of the FAD-stabilized Su9-6-HDNO by mitochondria of the ssc1-3 mutant.
