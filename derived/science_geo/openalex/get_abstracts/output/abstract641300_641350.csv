https://openalex.org/W2980995354,"The human brain has undergone substantial change since humans diverged from chimpanzees and the other great apes1,2. However, the genetic and developmental programs that underlie this divergence are not fully understood. Here we have analysed stem cell-derived cerebral organoids using single-cell transcriptomics and accessible chromatin profiling to investigate gene-regulatory changes that are specific to humans. We first analysed cell composition and reconstructed differentiation trajectories over the entire course of human cerebral organoid development from pluripotency, through neuroectoderm and neuroepithelial stages, followed by divergence into neuronal fates within the dorsal and ventral forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain regions. Brain-region composition varied in organoids from different iPSC lines, but regional gene-expression patterns remained largely reproducible across individuals. We analysed chimpanzee and macaque cerebral organoids and found that human neuronal development occurs at a slower pace relative to the other two primates. Using pseudotemporal alignment of differentiation paths, we found that human-specific gene expression resolved to distinct cell states along progenitor-to-neuron lineages in the cortex. Chromatin accessibility was dynamic during cortex development, and we identified divergence in accessibility between human and chimpanzee that correlated with human-specific gene expression and genetic change. Finally, we mapped human-specific expression in adult prefrontal cortex using single-nucleus RNA sequencing analysis and identified developmental differences that persist into adulthood, as well as cell-state-specific changes that occur exclusively in the adult brain. Our data provide a temporal cell atlas of great ape forebrain development, and illuminate dynamic gene-regulatory features that are unique to humans."
https://openalex.org/W2980597982,"Heterochromatin affects genome function at many levels. It enables heritable gene repression, maintains chromosome integrity and provides mechanical rigidity to the nucleus1,2. These diverse functions are proposed to arise in part from compaction of the underlying chromatin2. A major type of heterochromatin contains at its core the complex formed between HP1 proteins and chromatin that is methylated on histone H3, lysine 9 (H3K9me). HP1 is proposed to use oligomerization to compact chromatin into phase-separated condensates3-6. Yet, how HP1-mediated phase separation relates to chromatin compaction remains unclear. Here we show that chromatin compaction by the Schizosaccharomyces pombe HP1 protein Swi6 results in phase-separated liquid condensates. Unexpectedly, we find that Swi6 substantially increases the accessibility and dynamics of buried histone residues within a nucleosome. Restraining these dynamics impairs compaction of chromatin into liquid droplets by Swi6. Our results indicate that Swi6 couples its oligomerization to the phase separation of chromatin by a counterintuitive mechanism, namely the dynamic exposure of buried nucleosomal regions. We propose that such reshaping of the octamer core by Swi6 increases opportunities for multivalent interactions between nucleosomes, thereby promoting phase separation. This mechanism may more generally drive chromatin organization beyond heterochromatin."

To inform efforts towards United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3.2-to end preventable child deaths by 2030-we need consistently estimated data at the subnational level regarding child mortality rates and trends. Here we quantified, for the period 2000-2017, the subnational variation in mortality rates and number of deaths of neonates, infants and children under 5 years of age within 99 low- and middle-income countries using a geostatistical survival model. We estimated that 32% of children under 5 in these countries lived in districts that had attained rates of 25 or fewer child deaths per 1,000 live births by 2017, and that 58% of child deaths between 2000 and 2017 in these countries could have been averted in the absence of geographical inequality. This study enables the identification of high-mortality clusters, patterns of progress and geographical inequalities to inform appropriate investments and implementations that will help to improve the health of all populations."

https://openalex.org/W2980489405,"Mitochondrial homeostasis depends on mitophagy, the programmed degradation of mitochondria. Only a few proteins are known to participate in mitophagy. Here we develop a multidimensional CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screen, using multiple mitophagy reporter systems and pro-mitophagy triggers, and identify numerous components of parkin-dependent mitophagy1. Unexpectedly, we find that the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) complex is required for mitophagy in several cell types. Whereas pharmacological inhibition of ANT-mediated ADP/ATP exchange promotes mitophagy, genetic ablation of ANT paradoxically suppresses mitophagy. Notably, ANT promotes mitophagy independently of its nucleotide translocase catalytic activity. Instead, the ANT complex is required for inhibition of the presequence translocase TIM23, which leads to stabilization of PINK1, in response to bioenergetic collapse. ANT modulates TIM23 indirectly via interaction with TIM44, which regulates peptide import through TIM232. Mice that lack ANT1 show blunted mitophagy and consequent profound accumulation of aberrant mitochondria. Disease-causing human mutations in ANT1 abrogate binding to TIM44 and TIM23 and inhibit mitophagy. Together, our findings show that ANT is an essential and fundamental mediator of mitophagy in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2980498570,"The mechanisms that extend lifespan in humans are poorly understood. Here we show that extended longevity in humans is associated with a distinct transcriptome signature in the cerebral cortex that is characterized by downregulation of genes related to neural excitation and synaptic function. In Caenorhabditis elegans, neural excitation increases with age and inhibition of excitation globally, or in glutamatergic or cholinergic neurons, increases longevity. Furthermore, longevity is dynamically regulated by the excitatory-inhibitory balance of neural circuits. The transcription factor REST is upregulated in humans with extended longevity and represses excitation-related genes. Notably, REST-deficient mice exhibit increased cortical activity and neuronal excitability during ageing. Similarly, loss-of-function mutations in the C. elegans REST orthologue genes spr-3 and spr-4 elevate neural excitation and reduce the lifespan of long-lived daf-2 mutants. In wild-type worms, overexpression of spr-4 suppresses excitation and extends lifespan. REST, SPR-3, SPR-4 and reduced excitation activate the longevity-associated transcription factors FOXO1 and DAF-16 in mammals and worms, respectively. These findings reveal a conserved mechanism of ageing that is mediated by neural circuit activity and regulated by REST."
https://openalex.org/W2980795582,"Protoplanetary disks are known to posses a stunning variety of substructure in the distribution of their mm~sized grains, predominantly seen as rings and gaps (Andrews et al. 2018), which are frequently interpreted as due to the shepherding of large grains by either hidden, still-forming planets within the disk (Zhang et al. 2018) or (magneto-)hydrodynamic instabilities (Flock et al. 2015). The velocity structure of the gas offers a unique probe of both the underlying mechanisms driving the evolution of the disk, the presence of embedded planets and characterising the transportation of material within the disk, such as following planet-building material from volatile-rich regions to the chemically-inert midplane, or detailing the required removal of angular momentum. Here we present the radial profiles of the three velocity components of gas in upper disk layers in the disk of HD 163296 as traced by 12CO molecular emission. These velocities reveal significant flows from the disk surface towards the midplane of disk at the radial locations of gaps argued to be opened by embedded planets (Isella et al. 2016, 2018, Teague et al. 2018, Pinte et al. 2018), bearing striking resemblance to meridional flows, long predicted to occur during the early stages of planet formation (Szulagyi et al. 2014, Morbidelli et al. 2014, Fung & Chiang 2016, Dong et al. 2019). In addition, a persistent radial outflow is seen at the outer edge of the disk, potentially the base of a wind associated with previously detected extended emission (Klaassen et al. 2013)."

https://openalex.org/W2980685606,"Diabetes is far more prevalent in smokers than non-smokers, but the underlying mechanisms of vulnerability are unknown. Here we show that the diabetes-associated gene Tcf7l2 is densely expressed in the medial habenula (mHb) region of the rodent brain, where it regulates the function of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Inhibition of TCF7L2 signalling in the mHb increases nicotine intake in mice and rats. Nicotine increases levels of blood glucose by TCF7L2-dependent stimulation of the mHb. Virus-tracing experiments identify a polysynaptic connection from the mHb to the pancreas, and wild-type rats with a history of nicotine consumption show increased circulating levels of glucagon and insulin, and diabetes-like dysregulation of blood glucose homeostasis. By contrast, mutant Tcf7l2 rats are resistant to these actions of nicotine. Our findings suggest that TCF7L2 regulates the stimulatory actions of nicotine on a habenula-pancreas axis that links the addictive properties of nicotine to its diabetes-promoting actions."
https://openalex.org/W2980447845,"The Ginkgo biloba metabolite bilobalide is widely ingested by humans but its effect on the mammalian central nervous system is not fully understood1–4. Antagonism of γ-aminobutyric acid A receptors (GABAARs) by bilobalide has been linked to the rescue of cognitive deficits in mouse models of Down syndrome5. A lack of convulsant activity coupled with neuroprotective effects have led some to postulate an alternative, unidentified target4; however, steric congestion and the instability of bilobalide1,2,6 have prevented pull-down of biological targets other than the GABAΑRs. A concise and flexible synthesis of bilobalide would facilitate the development of probes for the identification of potential new targets, analogues with differential selectivity between insect and human GABAΑRs, and stabilized analogues with an enhanced serum half-life7. Here we exploit the unusual reactivity of bilobalide to enable a late-stage deep oxidation that symmetrizes the molecular core and enables oxidation states to be embedded in the starting materials. The same overall strategy may be applicable to G. biloba congeners, including the ginkgolides—some of which are glycine-receptor-selective antagonists8. A chemical synthesis of bilobalide should facilitate the investigation of its biological effects and its therapeutic potential. A synthetic route to the Ginkgo biloba metabolite (−)-bilobalide is described."
https://openalex.org/W2981113243,"Many retinal diseases are associated with pathological cell swelling, but the underlying etiology remains to be established. A key component of the volume-sensitive machinery, the transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) ion channel, may represent a sensor and transducer of cell swelling, but the molecular link between the swelling and TRPV4 activation is unresolved. Here, our results from experiments using electrophysiology, cell volumetric measurements, and fluorescence imaging conducted in murine retinal cells and Xenopus oocytes indicated that cell swelling in the physiological range activated TRPV4 in Müller glia and Xenopus oocytes, but required phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity exclusively in Müller cells. Volume-dependent TRPV4 gating was independent of cytoskeletal rearrangements and phosphorylation. Our findings also revealed that TRPV4-mediated transduction of volume changes is dependent by its N terminus, more specifically by its distal-most part. We conclude that the volume sensitivity and function of TRPV4 in situ depend critically on its functional and cell type–specific interactions.

The extent of TRPV4-mediated activation and gating upon small physiologically relevant volume changes remains unexplored.

We therefore employed the Xenopus laevis oocyte heterologous expression system based on TRPV4 expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes that were exposed to hyposmotic stimuli in the presence of PLA2 activators and blockers. As an additional control, we co-expressed AQP4 in a subset of oocytes, which we previously showed facilitates TRPV4 activation through a robust increase in water permeability and rate of swelling (32Fenton R.A. Moeller H.B. Zelenina M. Snaebjornsson M.T. Holen T. MacAulay N. Differential water permeability and regulation of three aquaporin 4 isoforms.Cell. Mol.

TRPV4 and AQP4 expression in the plasma membrane was verified in immunofluorescent micrographs after microinjection of cRNA encoding the two proteins, whereas no expression was detected in control (uninjected) oocytes (Fig. 1A). Oocytes were challenged with a hyposmotic gradient of −100 mosm (obtained by removal of 100 mm mannitol from the control solution to decrease the osmolarity while keeping the ionic strength constant, leading to 5–10% cell swelling in the tested time frame) with continuous monitoring of their volume and current activity with conventional two-electrode voltage clamp (see representative volume and current traces in Fig. 1Ai). This osmotic challenge led to robust cell swelling of oocytes co-expressing AQP4 and TRPV4, which was virtually absent in TRPV4-expressing oocytes or uninjected oocytes (Fig. 1Ai). Activation of PLA2 by sc-3034 (3 μm) added to the test solution failed to affect TRPV4-mediated current activity, whether or not the oocyte was exposed to an osmotic challenge during the exposure (n = 10, Fig. 1 B and C). Despite earlier reports of PLA2 activity in oocytes (33Almilaji A. Szteyn K. Fein E. Pakladok T. Munoz C. Elvira B. Towhid S.T. Alesutan I. Shumilina E. Bock C.T. Kandolf R. Lang F.

The TRPV4-expressing oocytes were exposed to the downstream metabolites of the PLA2 signaling pathway, a mixture of the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) AA (10 μm), oleic acid (10 μm), anandamide (10 μm), and 5′,6′-epoxy-eicosatrienoic acids (EETs) (5 μm) to the extracellular side by inclusion in the test solution (n = 10; Fig. 1D). As these metabolites are released intracellularly upon PLA2 activity, we, in addition, microinjected the PUFAs directly into the oocyte during the electrophysiological recordings (n = 10; Fig. 1, E and F). Exposure of this mixture of PUFAs did not affect the TRPV4-mediated current, whether AQP4 was co-expressed or not and whether or not the cells were exposed to a hyposmotic challenge. Combined, these data illustrate that the canonical PLA2 signaling pathway and/or its associated downstream metabolites do not lead to activation of TRPV4 expressed in Xenopus oocytes. To determine whether PLA2 was required for the volume-induced TRPV4 activation, two different PLA2 inhibitors (ONO-RS-82 (1 μm) or pBPB (1 μm)) were applied prior to introduction of the osmotic challenge; PLA2 inhibition did not affect the TRPV4-mediated current activity or prevent swelling-induced TRPV4 activation (n = 9, Fig. 1 G and H). None of the tested agonists/antagonists affected the membrane currents of uninjected oocytes or oocytes expressing only AQP4 (data not shown). These results demonstrate that swelling-induced TRPV4 activation can indeed occur independently of PLA2 activation. Given that intermediary PLA2 activation is not required for swelling-induced gating of heterologously expressed TRPV4, we determined the involvement of other factors that have previously been implicated in TRPV4 function. To resolve the requirement for protein phosphorylation in swelling-induced activation of TRPV4, TRPV4 + AQP4–expressing oocytes were challenged with a hyposmotic solution (−100 mosm) in the absence and presence of activators or inhibitors of protein kinase G (PKG), A (PKA), or C (PKC) (Fig. 2). These kinase modulators all efficiently target and activate their respective kinases in Xenopus oocytes (37Assentoft M. Kaptan S. Fenton R.A. Hua S.Z. de Groot B.L. MacAulay N.

To determine the effect of PKA-, PKC-, or PKG-dependent phosphorylation during swelling-induced activation of TRPV4, 200 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (PKC activator) or 10 μm chelerythrine (PKC inhibitor), 300 μm 8-Br-cAMP (PKA activator) or 50 μm H89 (PKA inhibitor), or 100 μm 8-pCPT-cGMP (PKG activator) or 1 μm K252a (PKG inhibitor) (n = 9–12, Fig. 2, A–F, right panels) were added to the test solution, and the TRPV4-mediated current activity was measured (see Fig. 2H for a schematic of the experimental paradigm). Summarized data obtained for all six kinase modulators at −85 mV are shown in Fig. 2G (n = 9–12). Inhibition or activation of PKC, PKA, and PKG did not significantly affect the swelling-induced activation of TRPV4. To determine whether swelling-induced TRPV4 activation relies on cytoskeletal dynamics, we monitored swelling-induced activation of TRPV4 in the presence of two inhibitors of cytoskeletal rearrangements, taxol (microtubules) and latrunculin A (actin) (39Herman B. Langevin M.A. Albertini D.F. The effects of taxol on the organization of the cytoskeleton in cultured ovarian granulosa cells.Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 31 (6137363): 34-45PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure of TRPV4 + AQP4–expressing oocytes to these inhibitors did not affect the TRPV4-mediated current activity or the swelling-induced TRPV4 response (Fig. 3, A and B, n = 12). These results illustrate that swelling-induced TRPV4 activation occurs independently of cytoskeletal rearrangements. To resolve the structural identity of the TRPV4 volume sensor, we included the phylogenetically related TRPV1 in its full-length version as well as the heavily truncated splice variant thereof (VR.5′sv), the latter of which has been reported to open upon cell shrinkage (21Schumacher M.A. Eilers H.

The experiments were designed for each oocyte to act as its own control, and the effects of osmotic challenges and agonists are presented relative to the basal control current (see histograms in Fig. 4). In this manner, the expression levels of the different constructs need not be identical. Oocytes expressing AQP4 and each of the TRPV constructs (TRPV4 + AQP4 (Fig. 4A), TRPV1 + AQP4 (Fig. 4B), and VR.5′sv + AQP4 (Fig. 4C)) were initially challenged with a hyposmotic (−100 mosm) gradient during current recordings. TRPV4 + AQP4-expressing oocytes presented with increased current activity upon cell swelling (n = 9; Fig. 4Ai), which was in contrast to both TRPV1 and VR.5′sv, neither of which responded to cell swelling (n = 9; Fig. 4, Bi and Ci). Exposure to a hyperosmotic gradient (+100 mosm) led to cell shrinkage-induced current reduction in TRPV4 + AQP4–expressing oocytes (n = 9; Fig. 4Aii) but had no effect on TRPV1 + AQP4–expressing oocytes (which, nonetheless, responded robustly to the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin (10 μm) (n = 9; Fig. 4Bii)). Oocytes expressing the truncated version of TRPV1, VR.5′sv + AQP4, in contrast, displayed robust current activation upon cell shrinkage (n = 9; Fig. 4Cii) but were insensitive to capsaicin (Fig. 4Cii). AQP4-expressing oocytes (Fig. 4 (Ai and Aii)) and oocytes expressing the TRPV constructs in the absence of AQP4 failed to display increased current activity upon cellular volume changes. These related, but differentially gated, ion channels (TRPV1 with its insensitivity to volume changes, VR.5′sv with its shrinkage sensitivity, and TRPV4 with its swelling sensitivity) thus serve as tools to resolve the structural determinant of TRPV4 volume sensitivity. To identify the N-terminal determination of the volume response, we constructed a set of chimeric TRPV4 channels composed of the N terminus from the phylogenetically related TRPV1 ("
https://openalex.org/W2981141368,"Hyaluronan is a critical component of articular cartilage and partially helps retain aggrecan within the extracellular matrix of this tissue. During osteoarthritis, hyaluronan and aggrecan loss are an early sign of tissue damage. However, our recent attempts to mimic hyaluronan loss with the hyaluronan inhibitor 4-methylumbelliferone (4MU) did not exacerbate arthritis-like features of in vitro models of arthritis, but surprisingly, caused the reverse (i.e. provided potent chondroprotection). Moreover, the protective effects of 4MU did not depend on its role as a hyaluronan inhibitor. To understand the molecular mechanism in 4MU-mediated chondroprotection, we considered recent studies suggesting that shifts in intracellular UDP-hexose pools promote changes in metabolism. To determine whether such metabolic shifts are associated with the mechanism of 4MU-mediated pro-catabolic inhibition, using molecular and metabolomics approaches, we examined whether bovine and human chondrocytes exhibit changes in the contribution of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration to ATP production rates as well as in other factors that respond to or might drive these changes. Overexpression of either HA synthase-2 or 4MU effectively reduced dependence on glycolysis in chondrocytes, especially enhancing glycolysis use by interleukin-1ββ (IL1ββ)-activated chondrocytes. The reduction in glycolysis secondarily enhanced mitochondrial respiration in chondrocytes, which, in turn, rescued phospho-AMP–activated protein kinase (AMPK) levels in the activated chondrocytes. Other glycolysis inhibitors, unrelated to hyaluronan biosynthesis, namely 2-deoxyglucose and dichloroacetate, caused metabolic changes in chondrocytes equivalent to those elicited by 4MU and similarly protected both chondrocytes and cartilage explants. These results suggest that fluxes in UDP-hexoses alter metabolic energy pathways in cartilage."
https://openalex.org/W2980930064,"Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency (PKD) is a rare erythroid metabolic disease caused by mutations in the PKLR gene, which encodes the erythroid specific Pyruvate Kinase enzyme. Erythrocytes from PKD patients show an energetic imbalance and are susceptible to hemolysis. Gene editing of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) would provide a therapeutic benefit and improve safety of gene therapy approaches to treat PKD patients. In previous studies, we established a gene editing protocol that corrected the PKD phenotype of PKD-iPSC lines through a TALEN mediated homologous recombination strategy. With the goal of moving toward more clinically relevant stem cells, we aim at editing the PKLR gene in primary human hematopoietic progenitors and hematopoietic stem cells (HPSCs). After nucleofection of the gene editing tools and selection with puromycin, up to 96% colony forming units showed precise integration. However, a low yield of gene edited HPSCs was associated to the procedure. To reduce toxicity while increasing efficacy, we worked on i) optimizing gene editing tools and ii) defining optimal expansion and selection times. Different versions of specific nucleases (TALEN and CRISPR-Cas9) were compared. TALEN mRNAs with 5' and 3' added motifs to increase RNA stability were the most efficient nucleases to obtain high gene editing frequency and low toxicity. Shortening ex vivo manipulation did not reduce the efficiency of homologous recombination and preserved the hematopoietic progenitor potential of the nucleofected HPSCs. Lastly, a very low level of gene edited HPSCs were detected after engraftment in immunodeficient (NSG) mice. Overall, we showed that gene editing of the PKLR gene in HPSCs is feasible, although further improvements must to be done before the clinical use of the gene editing to correct PKD."

Herein, we describe the use of a tandem MS-based approach to identify such protein-binding partners for miR-34a. To identify proteins in the miR-34a interactome, we first established a method for miR-binding protein discovery in mammalian cells (Fig. 1A). In brief, a 5′ biotinylated pre-miR is used as bait and incubated with cell lysate, enabling subsequent pulldown of the RNA and its bound proteins on streptavidin-coated resin. After stringent washing, the resin is analyzed by Western blotting or LC-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) to identify protein interactors. We optimized experimental conditions using the pre-let-7–Lin28 interaction as proof-of-concept, and our method led to the identification of Lin28 as a specific binding partner for pre-let-7d relative to pre-miR-21 in HEK293T and NTERA-2 cell lines by MS and Western blotting (Fig. S1). Next, we used our pulldown strategy to identify RBPs for pre-miR-34a. With the aim of uncovering a p53-independent interaction, we opted to conduct experiments in two NSCLC cell lines: A549, which bears WT p53, and H1299, which carries mutant p53. Pre-let-7d was chosen as our negative control such that Lin28 enrichment could serve as an internal control for proteomics experiments. Pulldowns were performed in freshly lysed A549, H1299, and HEK293T cell lines for analysis by LC-MS/MS. 754 proteins were identified and quantified across all three cell lines (Fig. 1B). These proteins were visualized based on reproducibility and -fold change enrichment for pre-miR-34a (Fig. 1C). Only two proteins exhibited >2 log2 -fold change for pre-miR-34a/pre-let-7: SART3 and the DExH-box protein DHX30 (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, the interaction between SART3 and DHX30 has been observed in several cell lines (62Huttlin E.L. Bruckner R.J. Paulo J.A. Cannon J.R. Ting L. Baltier K. Colby G. Gebreab F. Gygi M.P.

https://openalex.org/W2980686444,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are important mediators of osteoclast differentiation. Although accumulating evidence has implicated BMPs in osteoblastogenesis, the mechanisms by which BMPs regulate osteoclastogenesis remain unclear. Activin A receptor type 1 (ACVR1) is a BMP type 1 receptor essential for skeletal development. Here, we observed that BMP-7, which preferentially binds to ACVR1, promotes osteoclast differentiation, suggesting ACVR1 is involved in osteoclastogenesis. To investigate this further, we isolated osteoclasts from either Acvr1-floxed mice or mice with constitutively-activated Acvr1 (caAcvr1) carrying tamoxifen-inducible Cre driven by a ubiquitin promotor and induced Cre activity in culture. Osteoclasts from the Acvr1-floxed mice had reduced osteoclast numbers and demineralization activity, whereas those from the caAcvr1-mutant mice formed large osteoclasts and demineralized pits, suggesting that BMP signaling through ACVR1 regulates osteoclast fusion and activity. It is reported that BMP-2 binds to BMPR1A, another BMP type 1 receptor, whereas BMP-7 binds to ACVR1 to activate SMAD1/5/9 signaling. Here, Bmpr1a-disrupted osteoclasts displayed reduced phospho-SMAD1/5/9 (pSMAD1/5/9) levels when induced by BMP-2, whereas no impacts on pSMAD1/5/9 were observed when induced by BMP-7. In contract, Acvr1-disrupted osteoclasts displayed reduced pSMAD1/5/9 levels when induced either by BMP-2 or BMP-7, suggesting that ACVR1 is the major receptor for transducing BMP-7 signals in osteoclasts. Indeed, LDN-193189 and LDN-212854, which specifically block SMAD1/5/9 phosphorylation, inhibited osteoclastogenesis of caAcvr1-mutant cells. Moreover, increased BMP signaling promoted nuclear translocation of nuclear factor–activated T-cells 1 (NFATc1), which was inhibited by LDN treatments. Taken together, ACVR1-mediated BMP–SMAD signaling activates NFATc1, a regulatory protein crucial for receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)–induced osteoclastogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2980867407,"Immune changes occur in experimental and clinical epilepsy. Here, we tested the hypothesis that during epileptogenesis and spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) an impairment of the endogenous anti‐inflammatory pathway glucocorticoid receptor (GR)‐annexin A1 (ANXA1) occurs. By administrating exogenous ANXA1, we studied whether pharmacological potentiation of the anti‐inflammatory response modifies seizure activity and pathophysiology. We used an in vivo model of temporal lobe epilepsy based on intrahippocampal kainic acid (KA) injection. Video‐electroencephalography, molecular biology analyses on brain and peripheral blood samples, and pharmacological investigations were performed in this model. Human epileptic cortices presenting type II focal cortical dysplasia (IIa and b), hippocampi with or without hippocampal sclerosis (HS), and available controls were used to study ANXA1 expression. A decrease of phosphorylated (phospho‐) GR and phospho‐GR/tot‐GR protein expression occurred in the hippocampus during epileptogenesis. Downstream to GR, the anti‐inflammatory protein ANXA1 remained at baseline levels while inflammation installed and endured. In peripheral blood, ANXA1 and corticosterone levels showed no significant modifications during disease progression except for an early and transient increase poststatus epilepticus. These results indicate inadequate ANXA1 engagement over time and in these experimental conditions. By analyzing human brain specimens, we found that where significant inflammation exists, the pattern of ANXA1 immunoreactivity was abnormal because the typical perivascular ANXA1 immunoreactivity was reduced. We next asked whether potentiation of the endogenous anti‐inflammatory mechanism by ANXA1 administration modifies the disease pathophysiology. Although with varying efficacy, administration of exogenous ANXA1 somewhat reduced the time spent in seizure activity as compared to saline. These results indicate that the anti‐inflammatory GR‐ANXA1 pathway is defective during experimental seizure progression. The prospect of pharmacologically restoring or potentiating this endogenous anti‐inflammatory mechanism as an add‐on therapeutic strategy for specific forms of epilepsy is proposed.—Zub, E., Canet, G., Garbelli, R., Blaquiere, M., Rossini, L., Pastori, C., Sheikh, M., Reutelingsperger, C., Klement, W., de Bock, F., Audinat, E., Givalois, L., Solito, E., Marchi, N.

https://openalex.org/W2980765607,"Prunus mume, a traditional Chinese flower, is the only species of Prunus known to produce a strong floral fragrance, of which eugenol is one of the principal components. To explore the molecular mechanism of eugenol biosynthesis in P. mume, patterns of dynamic, spatial and temporal variation in eugenol were analysed using GC-MS. Coniferyl alcohol acetyltransferase (CFAT), a member of the BAHD acyltransferase family, catalyses the substrate of coniferyl alcohol to coniferyl acetate, which is an important substrate for synthesizing eugenol. In a genome-wide analysis, we found 90 PmBAHD genes that were phylogenetically clustered into five major groups with motif compositions relatively conserved in each cluster. The phylogenetic tree showed that the PmBAHD67-70 proteins were close to the functional CFATs identified in other species, indicating that these four proteins might function as CFATs. In this work, 2 PmCFAT genes, named PmCFAT1 and PmCFAT2, were cloned from P. mume ‘Sanlunyudie’, which has a strong fragrance. Multiple sequences indicated that PmCFAT1 contained two conserved domains, HxxxD and DFGWG, whereas DFGWG in PmCFAT2 was changed to DFGFG. The expression levels of PmCFAT1 and PmCFAT2 were examined in different flower organs and during the flowering stages of P. mume ‘Sanlunyudie’. The results showed that PmCFAT1 was highly expressed in petals and stamens, and this expression increased from the budding stage to the full bloom stage and decreased in the withering stage, consistent with the patterns of eugenol synthesis and emission. However, the peak of gene expression appeared earlier than those of eugenol synthesis and emission. In addition, the expression level of PmCFAT2 was higher in pistils and sepals than in other organs and decreased from the budding stage to the blooming stage and then increased in the withering stage, which was not consistent with eugenol synthesis. Subcellular localization analysis indicated that PmCFAT1 and PmCFAT2 were located in the cytoplasm and nucleus, while enzyme activity assays showed that PmCFAT1 is involved in eugenol biosynthesis in vitro. Overall, the results suggested that PmCFAT1, but not PmCFAT2, contributed to eugenol synthesis in P. mume."
https://openalex.org/W2980859565,"Occurrence of Candida nivariensis and Candida bracarensis, two species phenotypically similar to Candida glabrata sensu stricto, in human clinical samples from different geographical settings remains unknown. This study developed a low-cost multiplex PCR (mPCR) and three species-specific singleplex PCR assays. Reference strains of common Candida species were used during development and the performance of mPCR and singleplex PCR assays was evaluated with 440 clinical C. glabrata sensu lato isolates. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA was also sequenced from 85 selected isolates and rDNA sequence variations were used for determining genetic relatedness among the isolates by using MEGA X software. Species-specific amplicons for C. glabrata (~360 bp), C. nivariensis (~250 bp) and C. bracarensis (~180 bp) were obtained in mPCR while no amplicon was obtained from other Candida species. The three singleplex PCR assays also yielded expected results with reference strains of Candida species. The mPCR amplified ~360 bp amplicon from all 440 C. glabrata sensu lato isolates thus identifying all clinical isolates in Kuwait as C. glabrata sensu stricto. The results of mPCR were confirmed for all 440 isolates as they yielded an amplicon only in C. glabrata sensu stricto-specific singleplex PCR assay. The rDNA sequence data identified 28 ITS haplotypes among 85 isolates with 18 isolates belonging to unique haplotypes and 67 isolates belonging to 10 cluster haplotypes. In conclusion, we have developed a simple, low-cost mPCR assay for rapid differentiation of C. glabrata sensu stricto from C. nivariensis and C. bracarensis. Our data obtained from a large collection of clinical C. glabrata sensu lato isolates show that C. nivariensis and C. bracarensis are rare pathogens in Kuwait. Considerable genetic diversity among C. glabrata sensu stricto isolates was also indicated by rDNA sequence analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2980958893,"Over the last years, individualization of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) parameters has been a focus of attention in the field of non-invasive stimulation. It has been proposed that in stress-related disorders personality characteristics may influence the clinical outcome of rTMS. However, the underlying physiological mechanisms as to how personality may affect the rTMS response to stress remains to be clarified. In this sham-controlled crossover study, after being stressed by the Trier Social Stress Test, 38 healthy females received two sessions of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. To take possible personality influences into account, they also completed the Temperament and Character Inventory. Mood and salivary cortisol were assessed throughout the experimental protocol. Overall, two iTBS sessions did not significantly alter mood or influenced cortisol secretion. When taking into account personality features, higher scores on the character dimension Cooperativeness was related to decreased cortisol output, only when active iTBS was administered after the social stressor. In line with other studies, personality features such as the character dimension Cooperativeness may be of particular interest to explain individual neurobiological responses to neurostimulation."

Spinocerebellar ataxia autosomal recessive 16 (SCAR16) is caused by coding mutations in STUB1, a gene that encodes the multifunctional enzyme CHIP (C terminus of HSC70-interacting protein). The disease spectrum of SCAR16 includes a varying age of disease onset, cognitive dysfunction, increased tendon reflex, and hypogonadism. Although SCAR16 mutations span the multiple functional domains of CHIP, it is unclear whether the location of the mutation and the change in the biochemical properties of CHIP contributes to the clinical spectrum of SCAR16. In this study, we examined relationships between the clinical phenotypes of SCAR16 patients and the changes in biophysical, biochemical, and functional properties of the corresponding mutated protein. We found that the severity of ataxia did not correlate with age of onset; however, cognitive dysfunction, increased tendon reflex, and ancestry were able to predict 54% of the variation in ataxia severity. We further identified domain-specific relationships between biochemical changes in CHIP and clinical phenotypes and specific biochemical activities that associate selectively with either increased tendon reflex or cognitive dysfunction, suggesting that specific changes to CHIP–HSC70 dynamics contribute to the clinical spectrum of SCAR16. Finally, linear models of SCAR16 as a function of the biochemical properties of CHIP support the concept that further inhibiting mutant CHIP activity lessens disease severity and may be useful in the design of patient-specific targeted approaches to treat SCAR16.

Methods Apply the Transcreation Framework, a community-engaged translational model, to develop the adapted program (Nuevo Amanecer or NA-II), design a randomized controlled trial for community settings, identify recruiters and interventionists, and recruit participants into the trial. Results Adaptations included expanding the program from eight to ten weeks, simplifying materials, and increasing skills practice. We added stress management videos, healthy lifestyles information, and survivorship information. Interventionists were trained Latina breast cancer survivors. All core components of NA were retained in NA-II including managing the impact of cancer, information on breast cancer and its treatment, finding cancer information, getting support, managing thoughts, stress management techniques, and setting goals. Participants receive a program manual. Each session includes a review of that week’s content using the manual, practicing a stress-management skill, setting a specific goal, and reviewing videos. Spanish-speaking Latinas with non-metastatic breast cancer were recruited by community recruiters. Of 231 women approached, 24% refused, 10% were ineligible, and 153 (66%) were randomized to the intervention or a wait-list control group. The sample was vulnerable: 69% had < high school education, more than half had only Medicaid or no insurance, 91% was foreign born, and 48% reported financial hardship in the past year. Conclusions Applying the Transcreation Framework to engage stakeholders in designing community-based RCTs enhanced congruence with community contexts and recruitment of this vulnerable population."
https://openalex.org/W2981163294,"The host-defense peptide (HDP) piscidin 1 (P1), isolated from the mast cells of striped bass, has potent activities against bacteria, viruses, fungi, and cancer cells and can also modulate the activity of membrane receptors. Given its broad pharmacological potential, here we used several approaches to better understand its interactions with multicomponent bilayers representing models of bacterial (phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)/phosphatidylglycerol) and mammalian (phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol (PC/Chol)) membranes. Using solid-state NMR, we solved the structure of P1 bound to PC/Chol and compared it with that of P3, a less potent homolog. The comparison disclosed that although both peptides are interfacially bound and α-helical, they differ in bilayer orientations and depths of insertion, and these differences depend on bilayer composition. Although Chol is thought to make mammalian membranes less susceptible to HDP-mediated destabilization, we found that Chol does not affect the permeabilization effects of P1. X-ray diffraction experiments revealed that both piscidins produce a demixing effect in PC/Chol membranes by increasing the fraction of the Chol-depleted phase. Furthermore, P1 increased the temperature required for the lamellar-to-hexagonal phase transition in PE bilayers, suggesting that it imposes positive membrane curvature. Patch-clamp measurements on the inner Escherichia coli membrane showed that P1 and P3, at concentrations sufficient for antimicrobial activity, substantially decrease the activating tension for bacterial mechanosensitive channels. This indicated that piscidins can cause lipid redistribution and restructuring in the microenvironment near proteins. We conclude that the mechanism of piscidin's antimicrobial activity extends beyond simple membrane destabilization, helping to rationalize its broader spectrum of pharmacological effects."

In this study by using an array of approaches, including enzyme, chemotaxis, cytokine assays, quantitative RT-PCR, and CD spectroscopy, we found that the cysteine protease ApdS from S. suis cleaves LL-37 and thereby plays a key role in the interaction between S. suis and human neutrophils. S. suis infection stimulated LL-37 production in human neutrophils, and S. suis exposure to LL-37 up-regulated ApdS protease expression in the bacterium. We observed that ApdS targets and rapidly cleaves LL-37, impairing its bactericidal activity against S. suis. We attributed this effect to the decreased helical content of the secondary structure in the truncated peptide. Moreover, ApdS rescued S. suis from killing by human neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps because LL-37 truncation attenuated neutrophil chemotaxis and inhibited the formation of extracellular traps and the production of reactive oxygen species.

The objectives of this study were to suggest and define parameters for the quantification of acetabular bone defects, to analyze 50 bone defects and to present the results and correlations between the defined parameters.The analysis was based on CT-data of pelvises with acetabular bone defects and their reconstruction via a statistical shape model. Based on this data, bone volume loss and new bone formation were analyzed in four sectors (cranial roof, anterior column, posterior column, and medial wall). In addition, ovality of the acetabulum, lateral center-edge angle, implant migration, and presence of wall defects were analyzed and correlations between the different parameters were assessed.Bone volume loss was found in all sectors and was multidirectional in most cases. Highest relative bone volume loss was found in the medial wall with median and [25, 75]-percentile values of 72.8 [50.6, 95.0] %. Ovality, given as the length to width ratio of the acetabulum, was 1.3 [1.1, 1.4] with a maximum of 2.0, which indicated an oval shape of the defect acetabulum. Lateral center-edge angle was 30.4° [21.5°, 40.4°], which indicated a wide range of roof coverage in the defect acetabulum. Total implant migration was 25.3 [14.8, 32.7] mm, whereby cranial was the most common direction. 49/50 cases showed a wall defect in at least one sector. It was observed that implant migration in cranial direction was associated with relative bone volume loss in cranial roof (R = 0.74) and ovality (R = 0.67).Within this study, 50 pelvises with acetabular bone defects were successfully analyzed using six parameters. This could provide the basis for a novel classification concept which would represent a quantitative, objective, unambiguous, and reproducible classification approach for acetabular bone defects."
https://openalex.org/W2981133508,"The purpose of this study was to quantitatively assess gait characteristics and weight-bearing forces during ambulation in goats free of lameness using a pressure-sensing walkway as a biometric tool for stride, gait, and force analysis. Forty-six non-lame adult goats ranging in age from 5 to 6 years, mixed-breeds, and with a mean body weight of 52 ± 7.1 kgs were used. Goats were trained to walk over a pressure-sensing walkway. Data for analysis was collected on 2 different days, 3 days apart. On each day, 2 to 5 walking passes, in the same direction, were captured for each goat. Data from 2 valid passes meeting the criteria for consistent walking gait on each day were averaged then used for analysis. Analysis was performed, including the day-effect, for stride, gait, and force characteristics. Of the 46 goats enrolled in the study, complete data sets were achieved in 33 (72%) goats. Gait biometrics were similar among the assessment days; therefore, all data was pooled for the purpose of characterizing data for individual limb and biometric parameter comparisons at the individual goat level. Statistical analysis revealed that no difference within the paired limbs, and that there were significant differences between the front limbs and hind limbs. Maximum force and maximum peak pressure were significantly greater for the front limbs as compared with the hind limbs (p < 0.001). Based on the results, gait and force characteristics can be consistently measured in goats using a pressure-sensing walkway during a consistent walking gait. Goats apply greater force to the forelimbs during the weight-bearing phase of stride as compared with the hind limbs. The use of objective assessment tools is expected to improve the ability of researchers and clinicians to monitor changes in weight bearing and gait and will contribute to improved animal welfare."

Observations performed in a Prep1 hypomorphic mouse model, expressing 3-5% of the protein, show an increase of embryonic lethality due, in part, to defects in angiogenesis. In this study, we provide evidence that overexpression of Prep1 in mouse aortic endothelial cells (MAECs) stimulates migration, proliferation, and tube formation. These effects are paralleled by an increase of several proangiogenic factors and by a decrease of the antiangiogenic gene neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 1 (Notch1). Prep1-mediated angiogenesis involves the activation of the p160 Myb-binding protein (p160)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) pathway. Indeed, Prep1 overexpression increases its binding with p160 and induces a 4-fold increase of p160 and 70% reduction of PGC-1α compared with control cells. Incubation of MAECs with a synthetic Prep1(54-72) peptide, mimicking the Prep1 region involved in the interaction with p160, reverts the proangiogenic effects mediated by Prep1. In addition, Prep1 levels increase by 3.2-fold during the fibroblast growth factor β (bFGF)-mediated endothelial colony-forming cells' activation, whereas Prep1(54-72) peptide reduces the capability of these cells to generate tubular-like structures in response to bFGF, suggesting a possible role of Prep1 both in angiogenesis from preexisting vessels and in postnatal vasculogenesis. Finally, Prep1 hypomorphic heterozygous mice, expressing low levels of Prep1, show attenuated placental angiogenesis and vessel formation within Matrigel plugs. All of these observations indicate that Prep1, complexing with p160, decreases PGC-1α and stimulates angiogenesis.-Cimmino, I., Margheri, F., Prisco, F., Perruolo, G., D'Esposito, V., Laurenzana, A., Fibbi, G., Paciello, O., Doti, N., Ruvo, M., Miele, C., Beguinot, F., Formisano, P., Oriente, F.

https://openalex.org/W2980538260,"Multiple tumors in patients are frequently diagnosed, either synchronous or metachronous. The distinction between a second primary and a metastasis is important for treatment. Chromosomal DNA copy number aberrations (CNA) patterns are highly unique to specific tumors. The aim of this study was to assess genome-wide CNA-patterns as method to identify clonally related tumors in a prospective cohort of patients with synchronous or metachronous tumors, with at least one intrapulmonary tumor. In total, 139 tumor pairs from 90 patients were examined: 35 synchronous and 104 metachronous pairs. Results of CNA were compared to histological type, clinicopathological methods (Martini-Melamed-classification (MM) and ACCP-2013-criteria), and, if available, EGFR- and KRAS-mutation analysis. CNA-results were clonal in 74 pairs (53%), non-clonal in 33 pairs (24%), and inconclusive in 32 pairs (23%). Histological similarity was found in 130 pairs (94%). Concordance between histology and conclusive CNA-results was 69% (74 of 107 pairs: 72 clonal and two non-clonal). In 31 of 103 pairs with similar histology, genetics revealed non-clonality. In two out of four pairs with non-matching histology, genetics revealed clonality. The subgroups of synchronous and metachronous pairs showed similar outcome for the comparison of histological versus CNA-results. MM-classification and ACCP-2013-criteria, applicable on 34 pairs, and CNA-results were concordant in 50% and 62% respectively. Concordance between mutation matching and conclusive CNA-results was 89% (8 of 9 pairs: six clonal and two non-clonal). Interestingly, in one patient both tumors had the same KRAS mutation, but the CNA result was non-clonal. In conclusion, although some concordance between histological comparison and CNA profiling is present, arguments exist to prefer extensive molecular testing to determine whether a second tumor is a metastasis or a second primary."
https://openalex.org/W2980764159,"Many medical education journals use Twitter to garner attention for their articles. The purpose of this study was to test the effects of tweeting on article page views and downloads.The authors conducted a randomized trial using Academic Medicine articles published in 2015. Beginning in February through May 2018, one article per day was randomly assigned to a Twitter (case) or control group. Daily, an individual tweet was generated for each article in the Twitter group that included the title, #MedEd, and a link to the article. The link delivered users to the article's landing page, which included immediate access to the HTML full text and a PDF link. The authors extracted HTML page views and PDF downloads from the publisher. To assess differences in page views and downloads between cases and controls, a time-centered approach was used, with outcomes measured at 1, 7, and 30 days.In total, 189 articles (94 cases, 95 controls) were analyzed. After days 1 and 7, there were no statistically significant differences between cases and controls on any metric. On day 30, HTML page views exhibited a 63% increase for cases (M = 14.72, SD = 63.68) when compared to controls (M = 9.01, SD = 14.34; incident rate ratio = 1.63, p = 0.01). There were no differences between cases and controls for PDF downloads on day 30.Contrary to the authors' hypothesis, only one statistically significant difference in page views between the Twitter and control groups was found. These findings provide preliminary evidence that after 30 days a tweet can have a small positive effect on article page views."
https://openalex.org/W2805797511,"Advances in community detection reveal new insights into multiplex and multilayer networks. Less work, however, investigates the relationship between these communities and outcomes in social systems. We leverage these advances to shed light on the relationship between the cooperative mesostructure of the international system and the onset of interstate conflict. We detect communities based upon weaker signals of affinity expressed in United Nations votes and speeches, as well as stronger signals observed across multiple layers of bilateral cooperation. Communities of diplomatic affinity display an expected negative relationship with conflict onset. Ties in communities based upon observed cooperation, however, display no effect under a standard model specification and a positive relationship with conflict under an alternative specification. These results align with some extant hypotheses but also point to a paucity in our understanding of the relationship between community structure and behavioral outcomes in networks."

https://openalex.org/W2980407827,"Recent transitions in the governance of urban stormwater, specifically developments that leverage the environmental and social benefits of green infrastructure (GI) including infiltration and neighborhood stabilization, often require capacities beyond those of any single municipal- or regional-scale organization. In many cities, transitions toward green stormwater infrastructure have been shepherded by networks of individuals spanning a diversity of organizations from governments to NGOs. These networks are often informal, that is, not established by legal mandate, governing authority, or formal agreement, and are often striking for their lack of formal hierarchy or formal leadership. Previous scholarship has revealed the importance of leadership in the development and efficacy of these multiorganizational, cross-sector environmental governance networks, but research has yet to empirically investigate and characterize informal network leaders within the context of GI for stormwater mitigation. To address this gap, we designed and administered a social network analysis (SNA) survey to individuals in a regional network of GI stormwater management professionals in and around Cleveland, Ohio USA. We collected network data on individual relationships, including collaboration and trust, and tested the impact of these relationships on peer-recognition of leaders in the GI network. Our findings suggest that network size, frequency of collaboration, and individual position within the network—specifically, betweenness centrality and openness—defined and likely supported leaders in the stormwater governance network. Leaders in this non-hierarchical, multi-institution context were more likely to be women and brokerage roles within the network benefitted women, not men, which contrasts with previous findings from research on single-organization and corporate networks. The implications of this research suggest that informal environmental governance networks, such as the GI network investigated, differ substantially from the generally more hierarchical networks of organizations. This finding is useful for municipalities and regional authorities grappling with complex environmental challenges, including transitions in strategies to manage excess stormwater for the protection of municipal drinking water sources and urban freshwater ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2980451819,"To assess the availability and affordability of oral anti-diabetic medicines in Shaanxi Province, Western China.In 2015, the prices and availability of 8 anti-diabetic medicines covering 31 different dosage forms and strengths were collected in six cities of Shaanxi Province. A total of 72 public hospitals and 72 private pharmacies were sampled, using a modified methodology developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Health Action International (HAI). Medicine prices were compared with international reference prices to obtain a median price ratio. For urban residents, affordability was assessed as the lowest-paid unskilled government workers to purchase cost of standard treatment in days' wages; for rural residents, days' net income was used.The mean availabilities of originator brands (OBs) and generics were 34.3% and 28.7% in public hospitals, and 44.1% and 64.4% in the private pharmacies. OBs and the lowest priced generics (LPGs) were procured at 12.38 and 4.52 times the international reference price in public hospitals, and 10.26 and 2.81 times the international reference prices in private pharmacies. Treatments with OBs were unaffordable even for urban residents. The affordability of the LPGs was good, except for acarbose, repaglinide and pioglitazone.Most anti-diabetic medicines cannot met the WHO's availability target (80% availability) in Shaanxi Province. The high prices of OBs had severely influenced the affordability of medicines, especially for the rural residents. Effective policies should be initiated to ensure the Chinese people a better access to more affordable anti-diabetic medicines."
https://openalex.org/W2980814637,"Loss of biological diversity through population extinctions is a global phenomenon that threatens many ecosystems. Managers often rely on databases of rare species locations to plan land use actions and conserve at-risk taxa, so it is crucial that the information they contain is accurate and dependable. However, small population sizes, long gaps between surveys, and climate change may be leading to undetected extinctions of many populations. We used repeated survey records for a rare but widespread orchid, Cypripedium fasciculatum (clustered lady's slipper), to model population extinction risk based on elevation, population size, and time between observations. Population size and elevation were negatively associated with extinction, while extinction probability increased with time between observations. We interpret population losses at low elevations as a potential signal of climate change impacts. We used this model to estimate the probability of persistence of populations across California and Oregon, and found that 39%-52% of the 2415 populations reported in databases from this region are likely extinct. Managers should be aware that the number of populations of rare species in their databases is potentially an overestimate, and consider resurveying these populations to document their presence and condition, with priority given to older reports of small populations, especially those at low elevations or in other areas with high vulnerability to climate or land cover change."
https://openalex.org/W2980892070,"Objective Focusing on people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders living in the community, the present study aims to examine the characteristics of and gender differences in self-disclosure to first acquaintances, and to clarify the relationship between self-disclosure and subjective well-being. Methods Participants (32 men and 30 women with schizophrenia spectrum disorders) were examined using the subjective well-being inventory, an original self-disclosure scale for people with mental illness, as well as the Rosenberg self-esteem scale, the Link devaluation-discrimination scale, and the affiliation scale. Results The self-disclosure content domains in descending order were as follows: “living conditions,” “own strengths,” “experiences of distress,” and “mental illness and psychiatric disability.” There were no significant gender differences in self-disclosure in the total and domain scores. Multiple regression analyses by gender revealed that: (1) in men, decreasing feelings of ill-being were significantly predicted by self-disclosure about “living conditions,” self-esteem, and perceived stigma; (2) in women, increasing feelings of well-being were significantly predicted by self-disclosure about “own strengths,” self-esteem, and sensitivity to rejection. Conclusions Self-disclosure to first acquaintances was related to subjective well-being in people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders living in the community. This result supports the recovery model and the strengths model. It suggests the importance of interventions targeting self-disclosure to first acquaintances about experiences as human beings, such as “living conditions” and “own strengths,” as it relates to subjective well-being in community-based mental health rehabilitation."

The role of the PFRs during antigen recognition is not fully understood; however, recent studies have indicated that these regions can influence T-cell receptor (TCR) affinity and pHLA-II stability. Here, using various biochemical approaches including peptide sensitivity ELISA and ELISpot assays, peptide-binding assays and HLA-II tetramer staining, we focused on CD4+ T-cell responses against a tumor antigen, 5T4 oncofetal trophoblast glycoprotein (5T4), which have been associated with improved control of colorectal cancer. Despite their weak TCR-binding affinity, we found that anti-5T4 CD4+ T-cells are polyfunctional and that their PFRs are essential for TCR recognition of the core bound nonamer. The high-resolution (1.95 Å) crystal structure of HLA-DR1 presenting the immunodominant 20-mer peptide 5T4111–130, combined with molecular dynamic simulations, revealed how PFRs explore the HLA-proximal space to contribute to antigen reactivity. These findings advance our understanding of what constitutes an HLA-II epitope and indicate that PFRs can tune weak affinity TCR–pHLA-II interactions.

https://openalex.org/W2981111841,"The endophytic insect pathogenic fungi (EIPF) Metarhizium promotes plant growth through symbiotic association and the transfer of insect-derived nitrogen. However, little is known about the genes involved in this association and the transfer of nitrogen. In this study, we assessed the involvement of six Metarhizium robertsii genes in endophytic, rhizoplane and rhizospheric colonization with barley roots. Two ammonium permeases (MepC and Mep2) and a urease, were selected since homologous genes in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were reported to play a pivotal role in nitrogen mobilization during plant root colonization. Three other genes were selected on the basis on RNA-Seq data that showed high expression levels on bean roots, and these encoded a hydrophobin (Hyd3), a subtilisin-like serine protease (Pr1A) and a hypothetical protein. The root colonization assays revealed that the deletion of urease, hydrophobin, subtilisin-like serine protease and hypothetical protein genes had no impact on endophytic, rhizoplane and rhizospheric colonization at 10 or 20 days. However, the deletion of MepC resulted in significantly increased rhizoplane colonization at 10 days whereas ΔMep2 showed increased rhizoplane colonization at 20 days. In addition, the nitrogen transporter mutants also showed significantly higher 15N incorporation of insect derived nitrogen in barley leaves in the presence of nutrients. Insect pathogenesis assay revealed that disruption of MepC, Mep2, urease did not reduce virulence toward insects. The enhanced rhizoplane colonization of ΔMep2 and ΔMepC and insect derived nitrogen transfer to plant hosts suggests the role of MepC and Mep2 in Metarhizium-plant symbiosis."

We use dual numbers to construct tangent linear and adjoint model code for a biogeochemical ocean model and apply it to a variational (4D-Var) data assimilation system when coupled to a realistic physical ocean circulation model with existing data assimilation capabilities. The resulting data assimilation system takes modestly longer to run than its hand-coded equivalent but is considerably easier to implement and updates automatically when modifications are made to the biogeochemical model, thus making its maintenance with code changes trivial."
https://openalex.org/W2980927883,"We investigated the perception of affordances for walking along a narrow path. We asked whether participants could perceive changes in affordances brought about by manipulation of properties of the body, or of the environment, without direct practice of the to-be-perceived affordance, and without external feedback about the accuracy of perception. In Experiment 1, participants made a series of 8 judgments of how far they could walk along a narrow path either, 1) without added weight, 2) while wearing a weighted vest, or 3) while wearing weights on their ankles. Before walking, mean judgments were lower when wearing weights than in the no-weight condition. In addition, in both weight conditions judgments changed across the series of 8 judgments, in the direction of greater accuracy. Control of the body in walking also can be influenced by motion of the ground surface, as commonly happens in vehicles. In Experiment 2, on a ship at sea, we evaluated the effects of walking with or without weight added to the body at the ankles. We again asked participants (experienced maritime crewmembers) to judge how far they could walk along a narrow path, with versus without ankle weights. As in Experiment 1, judgments made before walking mirrored the observed differences in walking performance. In addition, we again found evidence that judgment improved (without walking practice, or feedback) over the series of judgments. We conclude that participants were sensitive to (and spontaneously learned about) how affordances for walking were influenced by changes in the dynamics of body and the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2981142738,"Trypanosoma cruzi is a flagellate protozoan pathogen that causes Chagas disease. Currently there is no preventive treatment and the efficiency of the two drugs available is limited to the acute phase. Therefore, there is an unmet need for innovative tools to block transmission in endemic areas. In this study, we engineered a novel recombinant molecule able to adhere to the T. cruzi surface, termed scFv-10D8, that consists of a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) derived from mAb-10D8 that targets gp35/50. The synthetic gene encoding scFv-10D8 was cloned and fused to a 6×His tag and expressed in a prokaryotic expression system. Total periplasmic or 6xHis tag affinity-purified fractions of scFv-10D8 retained the capacity to bind to gp35/50, as shown by Western blot analyses. Pre-incubation of metacyclic trypomastigotes with scFv-10D8 showed a remarkable reduction in cell invasion capacity. Our results suggest that scFv-10D8 can be used in a paratransgenic approach to target parasites in insect vectors, avoiding dissemination of infective forms. Such advances in the development of this functional molecule will surely prompt the improvement of alternative strategies to control Chagas disease by targeting mammalian host stages."

To optimize phytoseiid mites' use in biocontrol, an efficient method for oral delivery of test compounds is required to assess their sensitivities to pesticides, RNAi for gene functional analysis and artificial diets. Here we developed four methods for oral delivery of a solution of xenobiotics to different life stages of the commercially available generalist predatory mite Neoseiulus californicus: (i) soaking mites in the solution, or allowing them to feed on (ii) spider mites soaked in the solution, (iii) a solution droplet, or (iv) solution-saturated filter paper. As measured by ingestion of a tracer dye, the droplet-based feeding system was most efficient; the dye was observed in the alimentary canal of >90% test mites of all life stages, with no mortality. The droplet-based feeding system was also effective for the commercially available specialist predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis, with >80% delivery efficiency. This study paves the way for development of methods for high-throughput RNAi and for toxicological or nutritional assays in phytoseiid mites."

Investigative efforts in low- and middle-income countries have suffered from a lack of reporting standardization required to draw comparisons across countries of varying economic strata. In this study we aimed to evaluate the impact of socioeconomic status on emergency department outcomes in a low-income African country using international data classification systems.This was a retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary care center in northern Madagascar. Data were abstracted from paper charts into an electronic registry using Integrated Public Use Microdata Series codes for occupation, Nam-Powers-Boyd (NPB) scores for socioeconomic status, and Clinical Classifications Software ICD-9 equivalents for diagnosis. Outcome was dichotomized to the combined disposition of death or transfer directly to operating theater (OT) versus discharge. We used t-tests to compare baseline characteristics between these groups. We used chi-square analysis to test the association between occupational class and diagnosis. Finally, multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed examining the impact of NPB score on death/OT outcome, adjusting for age, gender, diagnosis and occupation.5271 patients were seen during the 21-month study period with a death/OT rate of 9.7%. Older age and male gender were more common in death/OT patients (both p<0.001), and were shown to have positive odds ratios for this outcome in multivariate modeling (p<0.006 and <0.001). Occupational class was found to influence diagnosis for all classes (p<0.001) except Sales and Office. Adjusting for these 3 factors, we found a strong independent association between NPB quartile and death/OT outcome. Relative to the 1st quartile, the odds ratio in the 4th quartile was 2.9 (p = 0.004), the 3rd quartile 1.8 (p = 0.094), and the 2nd quartile 3.1 (p<0.001).To our knowledge, this is the first Malagasy study describing the relationship between socioeconomic status on emergency care outcomes. We found a stronger effect on health in this setting than in high-income countries, highlighting an important healthcare disparity. By using standardized classification systems we hope this study will serve as a model to facilitate future comparative efforts."

This study seeks to assess the suitability of recent survey data for Afghanistan (the 2010 Afghanistan Mortality Survey (AMS)and the 2015 Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey (ADHS)) for estimating levels and trends in fertility. As several fertility measures rely on the quality of age data, we first apply demographic tools for the identification of age misreporting, finding evidence that it is severe. We then explore the consistency of fertility reporting across the two surveys, finding that the 2015 ADHS reports higher fertility among older women than the 2010 AMS although the seasonal pattern of fertility is consistent across the two surveys. We then estimate total fertility rates in 2008–2010 and 2012–2015 and measures of Bongaarts’s key proximate determinants of fertility for Afghanistan and its provinces for urban and rural areas separately. The results show that fertility is similar in urban and rural Afghanistan. Although most of the provincial data on the proximate determinants is reasonably consistent with the fertility rates, there are anomalies in some provinces which indicate the possible under-reporting of births. Overall, we conclude that the fertility data in the two surveys can be used with care to give an indication of broad regional fertility patterns and trends in the country."
