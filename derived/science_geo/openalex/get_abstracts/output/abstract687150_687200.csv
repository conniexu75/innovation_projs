https://openalex.org/W4205746422,"HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is dominated by clinical therapeutic antiretroviral (ARV) drugs. Griffithsin (GRFT) is a non-ARV lectin with potent anti-HIV activity. GRFT’s preclinical safety, lack of systemic absorption after vaginal administration in animal studies, and lack of cross-resistance with existing ARV drugs prompted its development for topical HIV PrEP. We investigated safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and immunogenicity of PC-6500 (0.1% GRFT in a carrageenan (CG) gel) in healthy women after vaginal administration. This randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, double-blind first-in-human phase 1 study enrolled healthy, HIV-negative, non-pregnant women aged 24–45 years. In the open label period, all participants (n = 7) received single dose of PC-6500. In the randomized period, participants (n = 13) were instructed to self-administer 14 doses of PC-6500 or its matching CG placebo (PC-535) once daily for 14 days. The primary outcomes were safety and PK after single dose, and then after 14 days of dosing. Exploratory outcomes were GRFT concentrations in cervicovaginal fluids, PD, inflammatory mediators and gene expression in ectocervical biopsies. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02875119. No significant adverse events were recorded in clinical or laboratory results or histopathological evaluations in cervicovaginal mucosa, and no anti-drug (GRFT) antibodies were detected in serum. No cervicovaginal proinflammatory responses and no changes in the ectocervical transcriptome were evident. Decreased levels of proinflammatory chemokines (CXCL8, CCL5 and CCL20) were observed. GRFT was not detected in plasma. GRFT and GRFT/CG in cervicovaginal lavage samples inhibited HIV and HPV, respectively, in vitro in a dose-dependent fashion. These data suggest GRFT formulated in a CG gel is a safe and promising on-demand multipurpose prevention technology product that warrants further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W4206521293,"Since chlorpyrifos (CPF), a major organophosphorus pesticide, is widely used for agricultural and domestic purposes, thus, humans may be exposed to these toxic compounds through multiple sources. In recent years, significant concerns have been raised regarding the deleterious effects of exposure to CPF on human health, especially growing fetus. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the health risks of exposure to CPF among pregnant women living in Isfahan province, Iran, using deterministic and probabilistic approaches. The urinary concentration of 3, 5, 6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP), the most common metabolite of CPF, was measured as the biomarker of current exposure to CPF. For this purpose, spot urine samples were taken from 110 pregnant women and the urinary concentrations of TCP were quantified. The estimated daily intake and hazard quotient (HQ) for CPF exposure were measured according to the reference values set by World Health Organization (WHO) and United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) for acute and chronic exposure to CPF. Based on the results, TCP was detected in more than 70% of samples (3.8 ± 2.72 μg/L). The estimated daily intake for some participants was found to be higher than the suggested reference dose by USEPA for chronic exposure to CPF. Furthermore, the HQ>1 was obtained for 20% of the study population in Monte-Carlo analysis using USEPA chronic reference dose, indicating that chronic toxic effects are expected at least for a part of the target population. Based on the findings, proper measures should be taken to reduce the exposure of Iranian pregnant women to CPF and resultant health risks."
https://openalex.org/W4205998321,"The SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the ongoing COVID pandemic reveals particular evolutionary dynamics and an extensive polymorphism, mainly in Spike gene. Monitoring the S gene mutations is crucial for successful controlling measures and detecting variants that can evade vaccine immunity. Even after the costs reduction resulting from the pandemic, the new generation sequencing methodologies remain unavailable to a large number of scientific groups. Therefore, to support the urgent surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 S gene, this work describes a new feasible protocol for complete nucleotide sequencing of the S gene using the Sanger technique. Such a methodology could be easily adopted by any laboratory with experience in sequencing, adding to effective surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 spreading and evolution."
https://openalex.org/W4206403595,"For long-term treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, switching from tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate (TDF) to tenofovir-alafenamide (TAF) may prevent renal dysfunction and bone loss. However, the precise effects of this switch on the blood lipid profile remain to be clarified. This is an important issue as TDF is known to have effects on both low- and high-density lipids. Therefore, our retrospective multi-center study aimed to evaluate the effects of switching from TDF to TAF on the lipid profile of patients with HBV infection. Samples were obtained prior to the switch from TDF to TAF and at 6-12 months after TAF initiation. In some cases, additional samples obtained pre- and post-TDF administration were available for analysis. Serum cholesterol levels, including oxidized-low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c), and the rate of dyslipidemia, according to the NCEP-ATP III lipid risk classification, were analyzed. The data from 69 patients were analyzed, including 33 patients with pre- and post-TDF-initiation serum samples. Total cholesterol (T-chol), HDL-c, LDL-c, non-HDL-c, and oxidized LDL levels increased significantly after switching to TAF. With regard to sequential changes pre- to post-TAF, TDF was associated with significantly lower serum T-chol, HDL-c, and oxidized LDL-c levels, with T-chol, HDL-c, LDL-c, and oxidized LDL-c levels increasing significantly after the switch. The switch from TDF to TAF was also associated with an increase in the rate of dyslipidemia, from 33% to 39%, with an increase in the rate of severe dyslipidemia of 1.4% and 5.8%, based on T-chol and LDL-c levels. Of note, no cases of severe dyslipidemia were detected pre-TAF treatment. As oxidized LDL-c and non-HDL-c are strongly associated with atherosclerosis development, careful monitoring of lipid is needed after switching from TDF to TAF in this clinical population."
https://openalex.org/W3165343618,"In quantum computing, the variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are well suited for finding optimal combinations of things in specific applications ranging from chemistry all the way to finance. The training of VQAs with gradient descent optimization algorithm has shown a good convergence. At an early stage, the simulation of variational quantum circuits on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices suffers from noisy outputs. Just like classical deep learning, it also suffers from vanishing gradient problems. It is a realistic goal to study the topology of loss landscape, to visualize the curvature information and trainability of these circuits in the existence of vanishing gradients. In this paper, we calculate the Hessian and visualize the loss landscape of variational quantum classifiers at different points in parameter space. The curvature information of variational quantum classifiers (VQC) is interpreted and the loss function's convergence is shown. It helps us better understand the behavior of variational quantum circuits to tackle optimization problems efficiently. We investigated the variational quantum classifiers via Hessian on quantum computers, starting with a simple 4-bit parity problem to gain insight into the practical behavior of Hessian, then thoroughly analyzed the behavior of Hessian's eigenvalues on training the variational quantum classifier for the Diabetes dataset. Finally, we show how the adaptive Hessian learning rate can influence the convergence while training the variational circuits."
https://openalex.org/W4205224574,"The increasing energy demand and the target to reduce environmental pollution make it essential to use efficient and environment-friendly renewable energy systems. One of these systems is the Photovoltaic (PV) system which generates energy subject to variation in environmental conditions such as temperature and solar radiations. In the presence of these variations, it is necessary to extract the maximum power via the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controller. This paper presents a nonlinear generalized global sliding mode controller (GGSMC) to harvest maximum power from a PV array using a DC-DC buck-boost converter. A feed-forward neural network (FFNN) is used to provide a reference voltage. A GGSMC is designed to track the FFNN generated reference subject to varying temperature and sunlight. The proposed control strategy, along with a modified sliding mode control, eliminates the reaching phase so that the sliding mode exists throughout the time. The system response observes no chattering and harmonic distortions. Finally, the simulation results using MATLAB/Simulink environment demonstrate the effectiveness, accuracy, and rapid tracking of the proposed control strategy. The results are compared with standard results of the nonlinear backstepping controller under abrupt changes in environmental conditions for further validation."
https://openalex.org/W4206216653,"Objective This study aimed to demonstrate the importance of active carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) surveillance and evaluate the prevalence of invasive infections, risk factors, and mortality risk in CRE-colonized patients. Methods Retrospective cohort study analyzing 1,920 patients identified using an active CRE surveillance protocol, admitted to an adult intensive care unit in southeastern Brazil from January 2014 to December 2018. Results There were 297 (15.47%) CRE colonized patients, with one colonized for every six control patients. CRE-colonized patients demonstrated an increased chance of infection (odds ratio [OR] 7.967, p &lt; 0.001). Overall, 20.54% of the colonized patients presented invasive infection (81.96% due to Klebsiella pneumoniae). The colonization and infection ratio demonstrated the important role of the active CRE surveillance protocol. There were identified multiple risk factors for CRE colonization, including long-term mechanical ventilation (OR 1.624, p = 0.019) and previous exposure to aminopenicillins (OR 5.204, p &lt; 0.001), carbapenems (OR 3.703, p = 0.017), cephalosporins (OR 12.036, p &lt; 0.001), and fluoroquinolones (OR 5.238, p = 0.012). The mortality risk was significantly higher among colonized (OR 2.356, p &lt; 0.001) and colonized-infected (OR 2.000, p = 0.009) patients and in those with Enterobacter cloacae colonization (OR 5.173, p &lt; 0,001) and previous aminopenicillins exposure (OR 3.452, p = 0.007). Conclusions Early detection of CRE colonization through screening testing proved to be an important tool to control CRE spread. However, observation over the years has shown no effective control of colonization and infection. The prevalence rates of CRE colonization and colonization-infection were high, as were the mortality rates. In conclusion, an active CRE surveillance protocol is essential, but its impact depends on the effective implementation of preventive measures and feedback between team members."
https://openalex.org/W4205292313,"Sugarcane bacilliform virus (SCBV) is considered one of the most economically damaging pathogens for sugarcane production worldwide. Three open reading frames (ORFs) are characterized in the circular, ds-DNA genome of the SCBV; these encode for a hypothetical protein (ORF1), a DNA binding protein (ORF2), and a polyprotein (ORF3). A comprehensive evaluation of sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) miRNAs for the silencing of the SCBV genome using in silico algorithms were carried out in the present study using mature sugarcane miRNAs. miRNAs of sugarcane are retrieved from the miRBase database and assessed in terms of hybridization with the SCBV genome. A total of 14 potential candidate miRNAs from sugarcane were screened out by all used algorithms used for the silencing of SCBV. The consensus of three algorithms predicted the hybridization site of sof-miR159e at common locus 5534. miRNA-mRNA interactions were estimated by computing the free-energy of the miRNA-mRNA duplex using the RNAcofold algorithm. A regulatory network of predicted candidate miRNAs of sugarcane with SCBV-ORFs, generated using Circos-is used to identify novel targets. The predicted data provide useful information for the development of SCBV-resistant sugarcane plants."
https://openalex.org/W4205750980,"Oxygen is a low-cost and life-saving therapy for patients with COVID-19. Yet, it is a limited resource in many hospitals in low income countries and in the 2020 pandemic even hospitals in richer countries reported oxygen shortages. An accurate understanding of oxygen requirements is needed for capacity planning. The World Health Organization estimates the average flow-rate of oxygen to severe COVID-19-patients to be 10 l/min. However, there is a lack of empirical data about the oxygen provision to patients. This study aimed to estimate the oxygen provision to COVID-19 patients with severe disease in a Swedish district hospital. A retrospective, medical records-based cohort study was conducted in March to May 2020 in a Swedish district hospital. All adult patients with severe COVID-19 –those who received oxygen in the ward and had no ICU-admission during their hospital stay–were included. Data were collected on the oxygen flow-rates provided to the patients throughout their hospital stay, and summary measures of oxygen provision calculated. One-hundred and twenty-six patients were included, median age was 70 years and 43% were female. On admission, 27% had a peripheral oxygen saturation of ≤91% and 54% had a respiratory rate of ≥25/min. The mean oxygen flow-rate to patients while receiving oxygen therapy was 3.0 l/min (SD 2.9) and the mean total volume of oxygen provided per patient admission was 16,000 l (SD 23,000). In conclusion, the provision of oxygen to severely ill COVID-19-patients was lower than previously estimated. Further research is required before global estimates are adjusted."

Deaths associated with a positive ante-mortem SARS-CoV-2 PCR test and/or respiratory disease symptoms at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital in Soweto, South Africa from 15th April to 2nd November 2020, during the first wave of the South African COVID-19 epidemic, were investigated. Deceased adult patients had post-mortem minimally-invasive tissue sampling (MITS) performed to investigate for SARS-CoV-2 infection and molecular detection of putative pathogens on blood and lung samples, and histopathology examination of lung, liver and heart tissue. During the study period MITS were done in patients displaying symptoms of respiratory disease including 75 COVID-19-related deaths (COVID+) and 42 non-COVID-19-related deaths (COVID-). The prevalence of HIV-infection was lower in COVID+ (27%) than in the COVID- (64%), MTB detection was also less common among COVID+ (3% vs 13%). Lung histopathology findings showed differences between COVID+ and COVID- in the severity of the morphological appearance of Type-II pneumocytes, alveolar injury and repair initiated by SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the liver necrotising granulomatous inflammation was more common among COVID+. No differences were found in heart analyses. The prevalence of bacterial co-infections was higher in COVID+. Most indicators of respiratory distress syndrome were undifferentiated between COVID+ and COVID- except for Type-II pneumocytes. HIV or MTB infection does not appear in these data to have a meaningful correspondence with COVID-related deaths."
https://openalex.org/W4205562237,"Growing evidence highlighted the primary role of the immune system in the disease course of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The study aim was to investigate the expression of PD-1 and CD39 on CD4+ and CD8+ cells infiltrating tumor tissue compared to their counterparts in peripheral blood and explore its association with tumor characteristics, disease progression, and prognosis in females with TNBC.The study included 30 TNBC patients and 20 healthy controls. Cancer and normal breast tissue and peripheral blood samples were collected for evaluation of the expression of PD-1 and CD39 on CD4+ and CD8+T cells by flow cytometry.A marked reduction in the percentage of CD8+ T lymphocytes and a significant increase in the frequencies of CD4+ T lymphocytes and CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes expressing PD1 and CD39 were evident in tumor tissue in comparison with the normal breast tissue. The DFS was inversely related to the cancer tissue PD1+CD8+ and CD39+CD8+ T lymphocytes. Almost all studied cells were significantly increased in the tumor tissue than in peripheral blood. Positive correlations were detected among peripheral PD1+CD4+T lymphocytes and each of cancer tissue PD1+CD4+, PD1+CD8+and CD39+CD8+T cells, and among peripheral and cancer tissue CD39+CD4+and CD39+CD8+ T cells.The CD39 and PD1 inhibitory pathways are synergistically utilized by TNBC cells to evade host immune response causing poor survival. Hence, combinational immunotherapy blocking these pathways might be a promising treatment strategy in this type of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4206653882,"The primary role of muscles is to move, and control joints. It is therefore important to understand how degenerative joint disease changes this role with the resulting effect on mechanical joint loading. Muscular control strategies can vary depending on strength and coordination which in turn influences joint control and loading. The purpose of this study was to investigate the variation in neuromuscular control mechanisms and joint biomechanics for three subject groups including those with: uni-compartmental knee osteoarthritis (OA), listed for high tibial osteotomy surgery (pre-HTO, n = 10); multi-compartmental knee OA listed for total knee replacement (pre-TKR, n = 9), and non-pathological knees (NP, n = 11). Lower limb kinematics and electromyography (EMG) data for subjects walking at self-selected speed, were input to an EMG-driven musculoskeletal knee model which was scaled and calibrated to each individual to estimate muscle forces. Compared to NP, the peak gastrocnemius muscle force reduced by 30% and 18% for pre-HTO and pre-TKR respectively, and the peak force estimated for hamstring muscle increased by 25% for pre-HTO. Higher quadriceps and hamstring forces suggest that co-contraction with the gastrocnemius could lead to higher joint contact forces. Combined with the excessive loading due to a high external knee adduction moment this may exacerbate joint destruction. An increased lateral muscle co-contraction reflects the progression from NP to uni-compartmental OA (pre-HTO). Pre-TKR patients adopt a different gait pattern to pre-HTO patients. Increased medial muscle co-activation could potentially differentiate between uni- or multi-compartmental OA."
https://openalex.org/W4206786772,"Annual vaccination for influenza is recommended for high-risk populations for its high morbidity and mortality. South Korea provides free influenza vaccination to some target groups under the National Immunization Program (NIP), and discrepantly high vaccination rates are observed in such populations. In this study, we analyzed the trends in influenza vaccination rates and evaluated the impact of the recent expansion of financial coverage to children ≤12 years and pregnant women.We conducted a cross-sectional study with nationwide survey data from Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). From 2010 to 2019, we evaluated the trends in influenza vaccination rates of the following four target groups: children ≤12 years, adults ≥65 years, pregnant women, and people with chronic diseases.In total, 80,861 individuals were analyzed. From 2017 to 2019, the vaccination coverage of children ≤12 years increased from 66.2% to 83.1%; pregnant women from 44.1% to 68.5% (comparing the mean of 2010-2017 and 2018-2019, P <0.001 for both). The elderly ≥65 years showed the highest rates (85.8% in 2019), while people with chronic diseases marked the lowest (41.9% in 2019). People with liver diseases showed the lowest vaccination rate of 27.8%, while that of other common diseases ranged between 31.7-44.1%.The discrepancy between target groups corresponds to their financial coverage under NIP. The recent expansion of financial aids to children ≤12 years and pregnant women was followed by significant increases in vaccination rates in both groups. We suggest that free vaccination policy is one of the most effective strategies to enhance vaccination coverage, and we call for its expansion to other under-vaccinated target groups, especially people with chronic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4205871753,"The mouse has dichromatic color vision based on two different types of opsins: short (S)- and middle (M)-wavelength-sensitive opsins with peak sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV; 360 nm) and green light (508 nm), respectively. In the mouse retina, cone photoreceptors that predominantly express the S-opsin are more sensitive to contrasts and denser towards the ventral retina, preferentially sampling the upper part of the visual field. In contrast, the expression of the M-opsin gradually increases towards the dorsal retina that encodes the lower visual field. Such a distinctive retinal organization is assumed to arise from a selective pressure in evolution to efficiently encode the natural scenes. However, natural image statistics of UV light remain largely unexplored. Here we developed a multi-spectral camera to acquire high-quality UV and green images of the same natural scenes, and examined the optimality of the mouse retina to the image statistics. We found that the local contrast and the spatial correlation were both higher in UV than in green for images above the horizon, but lower in UV than in green for those below the horizon. This suggests that the dorsoventral functional division of the mouse retina is not optimal for maximizing the bandwidth of information transmission. Factors besides the coding efficiency, such as visual behavioral requirements, will thus need to be considered to fully explain the characteristic organization of the mouse retina."
https://openalex.org/W4205822425,"Torquetenovirus (TTV) is a nonpathogenic endogenous virus whose abundance varies with the extent of immune system activation. We determined if the TTV titer in the vagina of pregnant women was associated with vaginal microbiota composition and levels of compounds in vaginal secretions. Vaginal TTV and microbiota composition in 494 second trimester pregnant women were identified by gene amplification and analysis. Vaginal matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), tissue inhibitors of MMP (TIMP) and lactic acid isomers were measured by ELISA. Dominance was defined as the relative abundance of a specific bacterium or species at >50% of the total number of bacteria identified. Clinical data were obtained by chart review. The median log10 TTV titer was lowest when Lactobacillus species other than L. iners were dominant (<1.0) as compared to when L. iners (4.1, p = 0.0001), bacteria other than lactobacilli (4.5, p = 0.0016) or no bacterium (4.7, p = 0.0009) dominated. The TTV titer was inversely proportional to L. crispatus abundance (p<0.0001) and directly proportional to levels of G. vaginalis (p = 0.0008) and L. iners (p = 0.0010). The TTV titer was proportional to TIMP-1, TIMP-2, MMP-8 and MMP-9 abundance (p≤0.0002) and inversely proportional to the level of D-lactic acid (p = 0.0024). We conclude that the association between variations in the TTV titer and the relative abundance of specific bacterial species and vaginal compounds indicates that local changes in immune status likely influence vaginal fluid composition."
https://openalex.org/W4206079608,"In India, the HIV epidemic is concentrated among Key Populations (KPs), such as men who have sex with men (MSM), who bear a disproportionate burden of HIV disease. Conventional targeted interventions (TI) mitigate HIV transmission among MSM by focusing on physical hotspots. As increasingly, there is a shift within India's MSM community to connect with sex partners online, novel approaches are needed to map virtual platforms where sexual networks are formed. The objective of this study was to estimate the number of MSM in Delhi using virtual platforms to connect for sex and to describe patterns of their use.The study was conducted in the state of Delhi among MSM over 18 years of age who used virtual platforms to look for sexual partners. Virtual platforms were identified through community consultations. Size estimation was carried out by enumerating the number of online users, accounting for duplication across sites and time and based on interviews with 565 MSM.28,058 MSM (95% CI: range 26,455-29,817) use virtual sites to find sexual partners. We listed 14 MSM specific virtual sites, 14 general virtual sites, 19 social networking pages and 112 messenger groups, all used by MSM. Five virtual sites met feasibility criteria to be included in the virtual mapping. Of the MSM on these sites, 81% used them at night and 94% used them on Sundays, making these the peak time and day of use. Only 16% of users were aware of organizations providing HIV services and 7% were contacted by peer educators in the preceding three months. Two-fifths (42%) also visited a physical location to connect with sexual partners in the month prior to the study.TI programs that focus on physical hotspots do not reach the majority of MSM who use virtual sites. MSM active on virtual sites have a low awareness of HIV services. Virtual mapping and programmatic interventions to include them must be incorporated into current public health interventions to reach MSM at risk of HIV."
https://openalex.org/W4206118098,"Psycholinguistic approaches that study the effects of language on mental representations have ignored a potential role of the grammaticalization of the future (i.e., how the future manifests linguistically). We argue that the grammaticalization of the future may be an important aspect, as thinking about the future is omnipresent in our everyday life. The aim of this study was to experimentally manipulate the degree of future time references (i.e., present and future verb tense and temporal adverbials) to address their impact on the perceived location of future events. Across four experiments, two in French and two in German, no effect was found, irrespective of our verb and adverbial manipulations, and contrary to our hypotheses. Bayes factors confirmed that our null effects were not due to a lack of power. We present one of the first empirical accounts investigating the role of the grammaticalization of the future on effects of mental representations. We discuss possible reasons for these null results and illustrate further avenues for future research."

Nonparametric receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses were performed to predict the prognostic power of the FMF Stillbirth risk score and to generate a cut-off value to discriminate best between the event of IUFD versus live birth.Women in the IUFD cohort born a significantly higher overall risk with a median FMF risk score of 0.45% (IQR 0.23-0.99) compared to controls [0.23% (IQR 0.21-0.29); p<0.001]. Demographic factors contributing to an increased risk of IUFD in our cohort were maternal obesity (p = 0.002), smoking (p<0.001), chronic hypertension (p = 0.015), antiphospholipid syndrome (p = 0.017), type 2 diabetes (p<0.001), and insulin requirement (p<0.001). ROC analyses showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.72 (95% CI 0.67-0.78; p<0.001) for predicting overall IUFD and an AUC of 0.72 (95% CI 0.64-0.80; p<0.001), respectively, for predicting IUFD excluding congenital malformations. The FMF risk score at a cut-off of 0.34% (OR 6.22; 95% CI 3.91-9.89; p<0.001) yielded an 82% specificity and 58% sensitivity in predicting IUFD with a positive and negative predictive value of 0.94% and 99.84%, respectively.The FMF Stillbirth Risk Calculator based upon maternal demographic and obstetric characteristics only may help identify women at low risk of antepartum stillbirth."
https://openalex.org/W4206674165,"Alternaria porri (Ellis) Clf. causes purple blotch disease on Allium plants which results in the reduction of crop yields and quality. In this study, to efficiently find natural antifungal compounds against A. porri, we optimized the culture condition for the spore production of A. porri and the disease development condition for an in vivo antifungal assay. From tested plant materials, the methanol extracts derived from ten plant species belonging to the families Cupressaceae, Fabaceae, Dipterocarpaceae, Apocynaceae, Lauraceae, and Melastomataceae were selected as potent antifungal agents against A. porri. In particular, the methanol extract of Caryodaphnopsis baviensis (Lec.) A.-Shaw completely inhibited the growth of A. porri at a concentration of 111 μg/ml. Based on chromatographic and spectroscopic analyses, a neolignan compound magnolol was identified as the antifungal compound of the C. baviensis methanol extract. Magnolol showed a significant inhibitory activity against the spore germination and mycelial growth of A. porri with IC50 values of 4.5 and 5.4 μg/ml, respectively. Furthermore, when magnolol was sprayed onto onion plants at a concentration of 500 μg/ml, it showed more than an 80% disease control efficacy for the purple blotch diseases. In terms of the antifungal mechanism of magnolol, we explored the in vitro inhibitory activity on individual oxidative phosphorylation complexes I-V, and the results showed that magnolol acts as multiple inhibitors of complexes I-V. Taken together, our results provide new insight into the potential of magnolol as an active ingredient with antifungal inhibitory action to control purple blotch on onions."

In this paper, a multi-classifier framework is designed to address the challenges of credit card fraud detections. An ensemble model with multiple machine learning classification algorithms is designed, in which the Behavior-Knowledge Space (BKS) is leveraged to combine the predictions from multiple classifiers. To ascertain the effectiveness of the developed ensemble model, publicly available data sets as well as real financial records are employed for performance evaluations. Through statistical tests, the results positively indicate the effectiveness of the developed model as compared with the commonly used majority voting method for combination of predictions from multiple classifiers in tackling noisy data classification as well as credit card fraud detection problems."
https://openalex.org/W4207057956,"Background Pneumonia and sepsis are among the most common causes of hospitalization in the United States and often result in discharges to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) for rehabilitation. We described the timing and most common causes of 30-day unplanned hospital readmission following an index hospitalization for pneumonia or sepsis. Methods and findings This national retrospective cohort study included adults ≥65 years who were hospitalized for pneumonia or sepsis and were discharged to a SNF between July 1, 2012 and July 4, 2015. We quantified the ten most common 30-day unplanned readmission diagnoses and estimated the daily risk of first unplanned rehospitalization for four causes of readmission (circulatory, infectious, respiratory, and genitourinary). The index hospitalization was pneumonia for 92,153 SNF stays and sepsis for 452,254 SNF stays. Of these SNF stays, 20.9% and 25.9%, respectively, resulted in a 30-day unplanned readmission. Overall, septicemia was the single most common readmission diagnosis for residents with an index hospitalization for pneumonia (16.7% of 30-day readmissions) and sepsis (22.4% of 30-day readmissions). The mean time to unplanned readmission was approximately 14 days overall. Respiratory causes displayed the highest daily risk of rehospitalization following index hospitalizations for pneumonia, while circulatory and infectious causes had the highest daily risk of rehospitalization following index hospitalizations for sepsis. The day of highest risk for readmission occurred within two weeks of the index hospitalization discharge, but the readmission risk persisted across the 30-day follow-up. Conclusion Among older adults discharged to SNFs following a hospitalization for pneumonia or sepsis, hospital readmissions for infectious, circulatory, respiratory, and genitourinary causes occurred frequently throughout the 30-day post-discharge period. Our data suggests further study is needed, perhaps on the value of closer monitoring in SNFs post-hospital discharge and improved communication between hospitals and SNFs, to reduce the risk of potentially preventable hospital readmissions."

One repetition maximal (1RM), vertical jump, Y balance test and 30-meter sprinting performance were tested before and after intervention.No between groups differences were detected for any tests before intervention. Significant group by time (before or after intervention) interaction effects were observed in 1RM, vertical jump, bilateral lower limb reaching distance at posteromedial and posterolateral directions, and right leg at the anterior direction for the Y balance test (all p < 0.05), but not for the left leg at the anterior direction or the 30-meter sprinting performance (both p > 0.05). Post-hoc analysis for measurements with significant interactions revealed that all significant changes were at the ING group (all p < 0.05), while no changes for the CON group were observed (all p > 0.05).Eight weeks INT significantly improved strength, power and balance in Chinese elite female table tennis players. Adopting INT in table tennis players may improve their physical performance and lead to better sports performance."
https://openalex.org/W4206572182,"Gear modifications in fisheries are usually implemented to obtain catch patterns that meet management objectives. In the Basque bottom trawl fishery, gear regulations include the use of a square mesh panel (SMP) placed at the top panel of the extension piece of the trawl to supplement diamond mesh codend selectivity. However, the catch patterns obtained with this combination have raised concern among scientists and authorities. This study combines new data on different SMP and codend designs with existing data from the literature to produce new results that are applied to predict the size selectivity and catch patterns of different gear combinations for a variety of fishing scenarios. A systematic approach based on the concept of treatment trees was outlined and applied to depict the effect of individual and combined gear design changes on size selectivity and catch patterns for hake (Merluccius merluccius) and blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou). This approach led to identification of the gear combination with the most appropriate exploitation pattern for these two species and improved the readability and interpretation of selectivity results. The results demonstrated that changes both in SMP and, especially, codend designs have a significant effect on hake and blue whiting size selectivity and catch patterns. Therefore, we believe that further research should prioritize codend size selectivity, and additional selection devices may be added once codend designs with good selective properties are achieved."
https://openalex.org/W4207046871,"Using transient climate forcing based on simulations from the Alfred Wegener Institute Earth System Model (AWI-ESM), we simulate the evolution of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) from the last interglacial (125 ka, kiloyear before present) to 2100 AD with the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM). The impact of paleoclimate, especially Holocene climate, on the present and future evolution of the GrIS is explored. Our simulations of the past show close agreement with reconstructions with respect to the recent timing of the peaks in ice volume and the climate of Greenland. The maximum and minimum ice volume at around 18-17 ka and 6-5 ka lag the respective extremes in climate by several thousand years, implying that the ice volume response of the GrIS strongly lags climatic changes. Given that Greenland's climate was getting colder from the Holocene Thermal Maximum (i.e., 8 ka) to the Pre-Industrial era, our simulation implies that the GrIS experienced growth from the mid-Holocene to the industrial era. Due to this background trend, the GrIS still gains mass until the second half of the 20th century, even though anthropogenic warming begins around 1850 AD. This is also in agreement with observational evidence showing mass loss of the GrIS does not begin earlier than the late 20th century. Our results highlight that the present evolution of the GrIS is not only controlled by the recent climate changes, but is also affected by paleoclimate, especially the relatively warm Holocene climate. We propose that the GrIS was not in equilibrium throughout the entire Holocene and that the slow response to Holocene climate needs to be represented in ice sheet simulations in order to predict ice mass loss, and therefore sea level rise, accurately."
https://openalex.org/W4205418666,"Listeria monocytogenes has been implicated in several ready-to-eat (RTE) foodborne outbreaks, due in part to its ability to survive under refrigerated conditions. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of sodium bisulfate (SBS), sodium lactate (SL), and their combination as short-duration antimicrobial dips (10-s) on L . monocytogenes and the microbiome of inoculated organic frankfurters (8 Log 10 CFU/g). Frankfurters were treated with tap water (TW), SBS0.39%, SBS0.78%, SL0.78%, SL1.56%, SBS+SL0.39%, SBS+SL0.78%. In addition, frankfurters were treated with frankfurter solution water (HDW)+SBS0.78%, HDW+SL1.56%, and HDW+SBS+SL0.78%. After treatment, frankfurters were vacuum packaged and stored at 4°C. Bacterial enumeration and 16S rDNA sequencing occurred on d 0, 7, 14, 21. Counts were Log 10 transformed and calculated as growth potential from d 0 to d 7, 14, and 21. Data were analyzed in R using mixed-effects model and One-Way ANOVA (by day) with differences separated using Tukey’s HSD at P ≤ 0.05. The 16S rDNA was sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq and analyzed in Qiime2-2018.8 with significance at P ≤ 0.05 and Q ≤ 0.05 for main and pairwise effects. An interaction of treatment and time was observed among the microbiological plate data with all experimental treatments reducing the growth potential of Listeria across time (P &lt; 0.0001). Efficacy of treatments was inconsistent across time; however, on d 21, SBS0.39% treated franks had the lowest growth potential compared to the control. Among diversity metrics, time had no effect on the microbiota (P &gt; 0.05), but treatment did (P &lt; 0.05). Thus, the treatments potentially promoted a stable microbiota across time. Using ANCOM, Listeria was the only significantly different taxa at the genus level (P &lt; 0.05, W = 52). Therefore, the results suggest incorporating SBS over SL as an alternative antimicrobial for the control of L . monocytogenes in organic frankfurters without negatively impacting the microbiota. However, further research using multiple L . monocytogenes strains will need to be utilized in order to determine the scope of SBS use in the production of RTE meat."
https://openalex.org/W4205512973,"We previously revealed the origin of mammalian simple-type glycogen synthase kinase interaction protein (GSKIP), which served as a scavenger and a competitor in the Wnt signaling pathway during evolution. In this study, we investigated the conserved and nonconserved regions of the composite-type GSKIP by utilizing bioinformatics tools, site-directed mutagenesis, and yeast two-hybrid methods. The regions were denoted as the pre-GSK3β binding site, which is located at the front of GSK3β-binding sites. Our data demonstrated that clustered mitochondria protein 1 (CLU1), a type of composite-type GSKIP that exists in the mitochondria of all eukaryotic organisms, possesses the protein known as domain of unknown function 727 (DUF727), with a pre-GSK3β-binding site and a mutant GSK3β-binding flanking region. Another type of composite-type GSKIP, armadillo repeat containing 4 (ARMC4), which is known for cilium movement in vertebrates, contains an unintegrated DUF727 flanking region with a pre-GSK3β-binding site (115SPxF118) only. In addition, the sequence of the GSK3β-binding site in CLU1 revealed that Q126L and V130L were not conserved, differing from the ideal GSK3β-binding sequence of simple-type GSKIP. We further illustrated two exceptions, namely 70 kilodalton heat shock proteins (Hsp70/DnaK) and Mitofilin in nematodes, that presented an unexpected ideal GSK3β-binding region with a pre-GSK3β sequence; this composite-type GSKIP could only occur in vertebrate species. Furthermore, we revealed the importance of the pre-GSK3β-binding site (118F or 118Y) and various mutant GSK3β-binding sites of composite-type GSKIP. Collectively, our data suggest that the new composite-type GSKIP starts with a DUF727 domain followed by a pre-GSK3β-binding site, with the subsequent addition of the GSK3β-binding site, which plays vital roles for CLU1, Mitofilin, and ARMC4 in mitochondria and Wnt signaling pathways during evolution."
https://openalex.org/W4205527097,"Pathogens exert a profound and pervasive cost on various aspects of primate sociality and reproduction. In olive baboons (Papio anubis) at Lake Manyara National Park, Tanzania, genital skin ulcers, caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue, are associated with increased female mating avoidance and altered male mating patterns at a pre-copulatory and copulatory level. Beyond this, mating is also comprised of post-copulatory interactions among sexual partners (i.e., copulation calls, darting [post-copulatory sprint away from the male], and post-copulatory grooming). In baboons, female post-copulatory behavior is hypothesized to incite male-male competition, promote subsequent copulations, and/or strengthen the bonds between the mating pairs. Due to a higher reproductive burden (i.e. pregnancy, lactation, infant rearing), females should avoid proceptive behavior after mating to decrease further exposure to potential pathogens. To investigate whether the presence of genital skin ulcers has an impact at the post-copulatory level, we analyzed 517 copulation events of 33 cycling females and 29 males with and without genital skin ulcers. The occurrence of female post-copulatory behaviors was not altered by genital skin ulcerations in males. Similar to other baboon populations, females in our study group were more likely to utter copulation calls after an ejaculatory copulation. The likelihood of darting was higher after ejaculatory copulations and with the presence of copulation calls. Post-copulatory grooming (i.e., occurring within 15 seconds after a copulation) was not frequently observed. Our results indicate that despite the presence of conspicuous signs of disease, female post-copulatory behavior was not affected by the genital health status of the males. This indicates that in our study group, infection cues caused by T. pallidum subsp. pertenue play a major role before and during mating, but not after mating. The post-copulatory behavior of females is most likely affected by physiological or evolutionary constraints other than sexually transmitted infections."
https://openalex.org/W4205870931,"Background In resource-limited settings, underlying causes of death (UCOD) often are not ascertained systematically, leading to unreliable mortality statistics. We reviewed medical charts to establish UCOD for decedents at two high volume mortuaries in Kisumu County, Kenya, and compared ascertained UCOD to those notified to the civil registry. Methods Medical experts trained in COD certification examined medical charts and ascertained causes of death for 456 decedents admitted to the mortuaries from April 16 through July 12, 2019. Decedents with unknown HIV status or who had tested HIV-negative &gt;90 days before the date of death were tested for HIV. We calculated annualized all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates grouped according to global burden of disease (GBD) categories and separately for deaths due to HIV/AIDS and expressed estimated deaths per 100,000 population. We compared notified to ascertained UCOD using Cohen’s Kappa (κ) and assessed for the independence of proportions using Pearson’s chi-squared test. Findings The four leading UCOD were HIV/AIDS (102/442 [23.1%]), hypertensive disease (41/442 [9.3%]), other cardiovascular diseases (23/442 [5.2%]), and cancer (20/442 [4.5%]). The all-cause mortality rate was 1,086/100,000 population. The highest cause-specific mortality was in GBD category II (noncommunicable diseases; 516/100,000), followed by GBD I (communicable, perinatal, maternal, and nutritional; 513/100,000), and III (injuries; 56/100,000). The HIV/AIDS mortality rate was 251/100,000 population. The proportion of deaths due to GBD II causes was higher among females (51.9%) than male decedents (42.1%; p = 0.039). Conversely, more men/boys (8.6%) than women/girls (2.1%) died of GBD III causes (p = 0.002). Most of the records with available recorded and ascertained UCOD (n = 236), 167 (70.8%) had incorrectly recorded UCOD, and agreement between notified and ascertained UCOD was poor (29.2%; κ = 0.26). Conclusions Mortality from infectious diseases, especially HIV/AIDS, is high in Kisumu County, but there is a shift toward higher mortality from noncommunicable diseases, possibly reflecting an epidemiologic transition and improving HIV outcomes. The epidemiologic transition suggests the need for increased focus on controlling noncommunicable conditions despite the high communicable disease burden. The weak agreement between notified and ascertained UCOD could lead to substantial inaccuracies in mortality statistics, which wholly depend on death notifications."

This study aimed to evaluate HPV seroprevalence, cervical HPV prevalence, genotype distribution, and frequency of HPV-related cervical lesions in SOT recipients in comparison to immunocompetent women.Cross-sectional study including SOT and immunocompetent women aged 18 to 45 years who denied previous HPV-related lesions. Cervical samples were screened for HPV-DNA by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based DNA microarray system (PapilloCheck®) and squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) by liquid-based cytology. A multiplexed pseudovirion-based serology assay (PsV-Luminex) was used to measure HPV serum antibodies.125 SOT and 132 immunocompetent women were enrolled. Cervical samples were collected from 113 SOT and 127 immunocompetent women who had initiated sexual activity. HPV-DNA prevalence was higher in SOT than in immunocompetent women (29.6% vs. 20.2%, p = 0.112), but this difference was not statistically significant. High-risk (HR)-HPV was significantly more frequent in SOT than in immunocompetent women (19.4% vs. 7.9%, p = 0.014). Simultaneous infection with ≥2 HR-HPV types was found in 3.1% of SOT and 0.9% of immunocompetent women. HPV seropositivity for at least one HPV type was high in both groups: 63.8% of 105 SOT and 69.7% of 119 immunocompetent women (p = 0.524). Low-grade (LSIL) and high-grade SIL (HSIL) were significantly more frequent in SOT (9.7% and 5.3%, respectively) than in immunocompetent women (1.6% and 0.8%, respectively) (p = 0.001).These results may reflect the increased risk of HPV persistent infection and disease progression in SOT women due to chronic immunosuppression."

Kinesio taping (KT) can improve the circulation of blood and provide elastic supports, which is a reliable method to treat low back pain. At present, although many studies have been published on the effects of KT on PLBP, the results are inconsistent, and some studies even report that KT does not affect PLBP. there is still a lack of high-level clinical evidence for the treatment of PLBP with KT. Therefore, this study proposes a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis of published Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of KT for PLBP.This protocol is guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols. We will search the following database sources of the RCTs: PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure Database (CNKI), Chinese Science, and the Wanfang Database. From the establishment of the database to April 2021. The retrieval word adopts the combination of theme words and free words. Take ""Kinesiotape, Tape Athletic, Orthotic Tape, Athletic Tape, Pregnancy, Pregnancies, Gestation, low back pain"" as a term for retrieval. Two independent investigators will conduct an electronic literature search, study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment to summarize and evaluate the efficacy of KT in the treatment of PLBP. Retrospective trials are not included, and the risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane bias risk tool. All data analysis will be conducted using Revman5.3 software.Quality outcomes in systematic review studies depend on inclusion and search criteria to obtain high-quality data, as well as how the data are processed and interpreted. Among the results, this study will objectively and comprehensively evaluate the efficacy and safety of the randomized controlled trial of KT in the treatment of PLBP, and make a detailed analysis of the effect of KT in the treatment of PLBP. The results will be analyzed by the Visual Analogue Scale of Pain and the Roland Morris Dysfunction Questionnaire. If applicable, a subgroup analysis will also be performed, which will be grouped according to the duration of pregnancy, grade of pain, etc. Finally, the results are submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication.Based on the results, this study will analyze and summarize the effect of KT on improving PLBP. It includes whether KT can improve the pain and lumbar function of PLBP, or it has adverse effects and reactions on pregnant women, then analysis and interpretation of other related issues. It is expected that the results of this study will provide a reference to the method and time of taping for clinical staff, as well as high-quality evidence to resolve the effect of KT on low back pain and provide corresponding guidance for pregnant women with low back pain.

https://openalex.org/W4206299707,"Background and purpose The complex anatomy of the temporal bone is difficult to understand and constitutes a challenge in the daily diagnostic routine even for experienced neuroradiologists. In the context of otoneurological (oVEMP) and preoperative diagnostics, the diagnosis of superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD) is of great importance for Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) specialists. The gold standard for this diagnosis is a high-resolution CT (HRCT) of the temporal bone. In order to correctly diagnose SSCD, special oblique reconstructions are necessary in addition to standard (axial, coronal, sagittal) reconstructions. We evaluated the frequency of diagnosis and its location in HRCT in correlation with otoneurological examination. From this analysis, we present a new SSCD classification. This classification yields the potential of a differentiated analysis of the patient’s clinical symptoms with correlation to the cross-sectional anatomy and may lead to a differentiated therapy approach. Study design and setting We evaluated 1370 temporal bone scans of patients with residual hearing and verified 343 superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD). We conducted a subgroup analysis of these 343 HRCT scans displaying a SSCD and used them as a basis to create a classification. Results Three location types of SSCD were identified. These were anterior type 1, superior type 2 and posterior type 3. Type 2 were significantly more frequent in both sexes. SSCD at this location can be overlooked if diagnosis is performed only in the standard axial plane, since it can only be visualized by means of double oblique reconstruction. We present a standardized reconstruction algorithm. Conclusion In total, three types of SSCD with differing incidences can be extrapolated from the locations. Superior type 2 is the most frequent one. Both sexes are affected with roughly equal incidence. The use of standardized double oblique reconstruction algorithm ensures that all three types are diagnosed in the HRCT."
https://openalex.org/W4206351835,"A crude comparison of medical costs between people with disabilities (PWD) and without disabilities (PWoD) shows a much higher expenditure among PWD and such results have been a cause for further stigmatization. This study aims to empirically analyze whether the medical costs for PWD are actually high when characteristics related to medical costs are adjusted. Ten percent of the total population was randomly selected from the Korean National Health Insurance (NHI) Database in 2016. A crude comparative analysis was performed to calculate the medical cost of PWD and PWoD. A subsequent multiple regression analysis was conducted to adjust factors affecting the medical costs such as socioeconomic status, disease, and health behavior-related characteristics. The medical cost for PWD was 3.6 times higher than that for PWoD by crude comparison. However, after multiple regression analysis, margin of difference decreased to 1.5 times although the cost for PWD remained higher. Substantial decrease in higher medical costs for PWD after multiple analyses compared to crude analysis implies that additional adjustment using variables such as disease severity, not available in the NHI database, may predict a further reduction in differences. Thus, it is difficult to determine that the medical expenditure for PWD is excessive."

Thyroid tissue from human donors was transplanted subcutaneously into the pre-implanted CP device or into the subcutaneous (SC) space alone as a control in a nude Mus musculus model. Transplanted M . musculus were monitored for human serum thyroglobulin (TG) levels for 3 months until the transplants were removed for histological assessment. Human thyroid tissue survived and continued to produce TG in transplanted nude M . musculus in the CP, with no adverse events. CP transplants exhibited more persistent and robust production of human TG than tissue placed in the SC space alone from 3 to 13 weeks post transplantation. Fresh thyroid transplants had better survival and function compared to cryopreserved transplants. Thyroid transplant viability correlated with TG levels at 3 months post-transplant (p = 0.03). Immunofluorescence staining of transplants for TG and TPO localized in thyroid follicles. Human thyroid tissue transplanted into the subcutaneously implanted pre-vascularized CP in nude M . musculus survived and continued to produce robust and persistent human TG and warrants further investigation as a treatment for postoperative hypothyroidism."
https://openalex.org/W4206447085,"Cocoa swollen shoot virus disease (CSSVD) is a major disease of cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) in Ghana and other West African countries that grow the crop. Attempts to develop resistant varieties since the discovery of the disease in 1936 have yielded little success. Recently, planting materials that are tolerant to the disease have been recommended for planting in areas with high CSSVD prevalence. However, the effect of CSSVD on yield component traits of most cacao clones including the tolerant varieties has not been well studied. To investigate the impact of CSSVD on these traits, reduction in bean weight (BW), number of beans per pod (NoBP) and dry bean yield (DBY) between symptomless and symptomatic trees, and disease incidence (DI) among 210 different cacao clones were evaluated. The clones were transplanted in June 2010 following a randomised complete block design with four replications consisting of three trees per clone per block. Response of the clones to CSSVD incidence had 180 of the genotypes having < 50% symptoms. Clones of Contanama, Iquitos, Marañon, Nanay and unknown derived from Upper Amazon parentage had less DI at the end of the study. The CSSVD effect (symptomless vs. symptomatic) was significant (p < 0.05) for DBY and NoBP, and the symptomless trees surpassed on average their symptomatic trees by 21.17% for DBY. Some of the best-performing clones identified under natural CSSVD infection were; COCA 3348/52 and GU 219/V among the underrepresented clones, B 36, ICS 40, NA 33 x IMC 67, T30/628, T60/887, T63/971, T 81/1879 and T 82/503 among those that combine high DBY with low yield reduction, and NA 124, T17/358, T35/78, T57/305, T63/971 x SCA 6, T65/239, T76/1835 and T82/2294 among those that combine high DBY with no disease incidence. Their inclusion in breeding programs that seek to develop resistant CSSVD varieties or deployment as planting materials in endemic areas to improve yield production in Ghana is recommended on the basis of the present observations."

The broad interaction of variables does not appear to be completely considered, nor has a dose-response function been determined. This registered (doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/EH94V) systematic review with meta-analysis aims to determine if the interaction of individual training variables to derive RT dose, dosing, and dosage can influence muscle strength and determine if an optimal prescription range exists for developing muscle strength. To derive RT dose, the following calculation will be implemented: number of sets × number of repetitions × number of exercises × exercise intensity, while RT dosing factors in frequency and RT dosage considers program duration. A keyword search strategy utilising interchangeable terms for population (adult), intervention (resistance training), and outcomes (strength) will be conducted across three databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, and SPORTDiscus). Novel to the field of exercise prescription, an analytical approach to determine the dose-response function for continuous outcomes will be used. The pooled standardised mean differences for muscle strength will be estimated using DerSimonian and Laird random effects method. Linear and non-linear dose-response relationships will be estimated by fitting fixed effects and random effects models using the one-stage approach to evaluate if there is a relationship between exercise dose, dosing and dosage and the effect on muscle strength. Maximised log-likelihood and the Akaike Information Criteria will be used to compare alternative best fitting models. Meta regressions will investigate between-study variances and a funnel plot and Egger's test will assess publication bias. The results from this study will identify if an optimal prescription range for dose, dosing and dosage exists to develop muscle strength."

To evaluate the impact of the edge design of intraocular lenses (IOL) on the location, shape and relative intensity of photic effects at the retina caused by photopsia in pseudophakic eyes, photopsia was simulated using ZEMAX software. The structural parameters of the pseudophakic eye model are based on the Liou-Brennan eye model parameters with a pupil diameter of 4.5 mm. The IOLs implanted in the eye model have a power of 21 diopter (D) with optical diameter of 6 mm and 7 mm. From the ray-tracing analysis, covering variations of incident ray angle of 50° to 90° from temporally, a photic image is detected at the fovea at specific ray angles of 77.5° (6 mm IOL) and 78.2° (7 mm IOL). This photic image disappears when a thin IOL with an edge thickness of 0 mm or a thick IOL with absorbing edges is replaced in the eye model. With an anti-reflective edge, this photic image remains, but with a fully reflecting edge it disappears at the critical angles and appears with different shapes at other angles. The intensity of this photic image can be reduced by changing the edge design to a frosted surface. Most of the photic patterns in IOLs are not observed with absorbing and thin edge designs. IOLs with anti-reflecting and fully reflecting edges generate disturbing photic effects at different angles on the fovea. IOLs with frosted edges reduce the contrast of the photic effects and make them less disturbing for patients."

This study aims to identify patterns of the motivators and barriers influencing heart health behaviors among multi-ethnic Asian adults with behavior-modifiable risk factors for heart disease, namely obesity, physical inactivity and smoking. Methods A population-based survey of 1,000 participants was conducted in Singapore. Participants were assessed for behavior-modifiable risk factors and asked about motivators and barriers to heart health behaviors. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to identify factors underlying motivator and barrier question items. Logistic regression was conducted to examine the associations of motivator and barrier factors with sociodemographic characteristics. Results The twenty-five motivator and barrier items were classified into three (outcome expectations, external cues and significant others including family and friends) and four (external circumstances, limited self-efficacy and competence, lack of perceived susceptibility, benefits and intentions and perceived lack of physical capability) factors respectively. Among participants with behavior-modifiable risk factors, those with lower education were more likely to be low in motivation factor of “outcome expectations” and “external cues”. The well-educated were more likely to be high in the barrier factor of “lack of perceived susceptibility, benefits and intention” and were less likely to have the motivation factor of “significant others (family or friends)”. Those aged 60–75 years had low motivations and high barriers compared to their younger counterparts. Older age was more likely to be low in motivation factor of “outcome expectations” and “external cues” and high in barrier factor of “limited self-efficacy and competence” and “perceived lack of physical capability”. Conclusions Findings underscore the importance of a targeted intervention and communication strategy addressing specific motivation and barrier factors in different population segments with modifiable risk factors."

Five themes identified including determinants and prevention of overweight and obesity, education and health system factors, stigma, and being fat comes with high risk. These themes collectively elaborate on the essentials of overweight and obesity that are obtained from perspectives of students.A strong cultural belief and practice has caused misperception of overweight and obesity among students with knowledge-behavior gap recognized as the main reason behind the failure in lifestyle changes among adolescents. Strengthen healthy behavioral lifestyle, improve awareness, and support feasible preventative strategies is recommended to all students."
https://openalex.org/W4206609622,"Containers have emerged as a more portable and efficient solution than virtual machines for cloud infrastructure providing both a flexible way to build and deploy applications. The quality of service, security, performance, energy consumption, among others, are essential aspects of their deployment, management, and orchestration. Inappropriate resource allocation can lead to resource contention, entailing reduced performance, poor energy efficiency, and other potentially damaging effects. In this paper, we present a set of online job allocation strategies to optimize quality of service, energy savings, and completion time, considering contention for shared on-chip resources. We consider the job allocation as the multilevel dynamic bin-packing problem that provides a lightweight runtime solution that minimizes contention and energy consumption while maximizing utilization. The proposed strategies are based on two and three levels of scheduling policies with container selection, capacity distribution, and contention-aware allocation. The energy model considers joint execution of applications of different types on shared resources generalized by the job concentration paradigm. We provide an experimental analysis of eighty-six scheduling heuristics with scientific workloads of memory and CPU-intensive jobs. The proposed techniques outperform classical solutions in terms of quality of service, energy savings, and completion time by 21.73-43.44%, 44.06-92.11%, and 16.38-24.17%, respectively, leading to a cost-efficient resource allocation for cloud infrastructures."

These scenarios involved presence and absence of obstacle vehicle in overtaking lane alongside leading vehicle in driving lane. In addition, the enhanced performance of modified RG algorithm is established over conventional RG algorithm by comparative analysis. The results indicate that overtaking maneuvering period could be decreased by 10% using a modified RG algorithm and vehicle will cover less distance to complete overtaking. The efficacy of proposed method is justified by performing experiments using mobile robots. The experimental results and simulation results of modified RG algorithm are compared, and their plots are almost identical."
https://openalex.org/W4206963534,"Introduction Because of different therapeutic regimens for superficial and non-superficial basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), accurate histopathological examination of a punch biopsy to determine its subtype is essential. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the additional yield of a more extensive step-section method to that of a standard histologic examination at 4 levels. Material and methods Data for this prospective study was obtained from the Pathology department of a Dutch tertiary hospital. Biopsy specimens of subsequent patients from March 2019 to June 2020 were sectioned to 8-levels instead of the regular 4-levels. Only patients with a superficial BCC subtype in the first 4-levels of sectioning were included (n = 100). After 8-level sectioning, it was recorded in which level (5–8) a more aggressive BCC component was found (i.e. nodular, infiltrative, or micronodular). Patients were followed-up to evaluate further treatment, and in case of excision, the excision specimen was reviewed to determine the BCC subtype. A logistic regression was performed to assess characteristics associated with a more aggressive BCC component in levels 5–8. Results In 14 patients (14%) a more aggressive component was found in levels 5–8, all with a nodular component. Thirteen of these patients underwent excision, confirming a more aggressive BCC subtype. Of the 86 patients that had no deeper BCC component in levels 5–8, 26 (30.2%) underwent excision; In 4 patients no residual BCC was found, in 15 patients superficial BCC, and in 7 a more aggressive BCC subtype (1 nodular and 6 a combination of superficial/nodular/infiltrative). In multivariable analysis, head&amp;neck localization was associated with finding a more aggressive BCC subtype in levels 5–8 (OR 6.41 (95%CI 1.56–26.30), p = 0.01)). Conclusions More extensive sectioning of superficial BCC biopsy specimens, especially in the head&amp;neck area, leads to a more accurate BCC subtype diagnosis requiring different clinical management strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4205250130,"Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is the most common genetic cause of kidney failure in humans. Among the various PKD-related molecules, PKD2L1 forms cation channels, but its physiological importance is obscure. In the present study, we established a transgenic mouse line by overexpressing the dominant-negative form of the mouse PKD2L1 gene (i.e., lacking the pore-forming domain). The resulting PKD2L1del-Tg mice exhibited supraventricular premature contraction, as well as enhanced sensitivity to β-adrenergic stimulation and unstable R-R intervals in electrocardiography. During spontaneous atrial contraction, PKD2L1del-Tg atria showed enhanced sensitivity to isoproterenol, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Action potential recording revealed a shortened action potential duration in PKD2L1del-Tg atria in response to isoproterenol. These findings indicated increased adrenergic sensitivity in PKD2L1del-Tg mice, suggesting that PKD2L1 is involved in sympathetic regulation."
https://openalex.org/W4205273477,"Landscape is an ecological category represented by a complex system formed by interactions between society and nature. Spatial patterns of different land uses present in a landscape reveal past and present processes responsible for its dynamics and organisation. Measuring the complexity of these patterns (in the sense of their spatial heterogeneity) allows us to evaluate the integrity and resilience of these complex environmental systems. Here, we show how landscape metrics based on information entropy can be applied to evaluate the complexity (in the sense of spatial heterogeneity) of patches patterns, as well as their transition zones, present in a Cerrado conservation area and its surroundings, located in south-eastern Brazil. The analysis in this study aimed to elucidate how changes in land use and the consequent fragmentation affect the complexity of the landscape. The scripts CompPlex HeROI and CompPlex Janus were created to allow calculation of information entropy (He), variability (He/Hmax), and López-Ruiz, Mancini, and Calbet (LMC) and Shiner, Davison, and Landsberg (SDL) measures. CompPlex HeROI enabled the calculation of these measures for different regions of interest (ROIs) selected in a satellite image of the study area, followed by comparison of the complexity of their patterns, in addition to enabling the generation of complexity signatures for each ROI. CompPlex Janus made it possible to spatialise the results for these four measures in landscape complexity maps. As expected, both for the complexity patterns evaluated by CompPlex HeROI and the complexity maps generated by CompPlex Janus, the areas with vegetation located in a region of intermediate spatial heterogeneity had lower values for the He and He/Hmax measures and higher values for the LMC and SDL measurements. So, these landscape metrics were able to capture the behaviour of the patterns of different types of land use present in the study area, bringing together uses linked to vegetation with increased canopy coverage and differentiating them from urban areas and transition areas that mix different uses. Thus, the algorithms implemented in these scripts were demonstrated to be robust and capable of measuring the variability in information levels from the landscape, not only in terms of spatial datasets but also spectrally. The automation of measurement calculations, owing to informational entropy provided by these scripts, allows a quick assessment of the complexity of patterns present in a landscape, and thus, generates indicators of landscape integrity and resilience."

With this follow-up article, I replicate these findings with a greatly expanded dataset, and I explore whether country-years where presidents have been elected using a majoritarian system are more likely to be associated with high government respect for human rights, in comparison to country-years where presidents have been elected using a non-majoritarian system. Ultimately, I find that not only are presidents elected with a plurality associated with comparatively lower levels of human rights respect, but so are presidents elected via a non-majoritarian system. These findings suggest that policymakers seeking to improve human rights practices may want to consider directing their efforts towards promoting electoral reform with an emphasis on mandating a minimum of a majority in order to win an election."
https://openalex.org/W4205591436,"Published cerebrovascular injection techniques have mostly used decapitated, fresh cadavers or heads embalmed with 10% formaldehyde. There have been no reports using vascular-injected cadavers for head and neck surgical training models or using vascular injections in saturated salt method-embalmed cadavers. Thus, we performed vascular labeling of five saturated salt method-embalmed cadavers without decapitation. Latex mixed with red ink was injected into the common carotid artery via a 3D-printed vascular adapter. The injection force was provided by a peristaltic pump. Thyroidectomy, submandibular gland excision, neck dissection, parotidectomy, and mandibulotomy were performed on both sides of each cadaver (n = 10). The consistency of the cadavers was softer than fresh ones. Subcutaneous tissues were well preserved, and muscles were moist and elastic. Five physicians graded the resemblance of the heads and necks of the latex-injected, saturated salt method-embalmed, non-decapitated of five cadavers compared to living humans using a Likert scale from 0 (no resemblance) to 5 (maximum resemblance). Fifty-two percent of the head and neck region resemblance scale ratings were four or five. Although the cadavers were practical for head and neck surgical simulations, the brain parenchyma was only partially preserved and unsuitable for use. The most distal arterial branches reached by the injected latex were measured. The external caliber of the smallest vessels reached were lacrimal arteries (mean caliber ± SD, 0.04 ± 0.04 mm; 95% CI [0, 0.09]). There were no significant differences in the mean caliber of the smallest vessels reached between the left- and right-sided arterial branches (all p < 0.05)."
https://openalex.org/W4206171167,"The Modern Western Diet has been associated with the rise in metabolic and inflammatory diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. This has been attributed, in part, to the increase in dietary omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) consumption, specifically linoleic acid (LA), arachidonic acid (ARA), and their subsequent metabolism to pro-inflammatory metabolites which may be driving human disease. Conversion of dietary LA to ARA is regulated by genetic variants near and within the fatty acid desaturase (FADS) haplotype block, most notably single nucleotide polymorphism rs174537 is strongly associated with FADS1 activity and expression. This variant and others within high linkage disequilibrium may potentially explain the diversity in both diet and inflammatory mediators that drive chronic inflammatory disease in human populations. Mechanistic exploration into this phenomenon using human hepatocytes is limited by current two-dimensional culture models that poorly replicate in vivo functionality. Therefore, we aimed to develop and characterize a three-dimensional hepatic construct for the study of human PUFA metabolism. Primary human hepatocytes cultured in 3D hydrogels were characterized for their capacity to represent basic lipid processing functions, including lipid esterification, de novo lipogenesis, and cholesterol efflux. They were then exposed to control and LA-enriched media and reproducibly displayed allele-specific metabolic activity of FADS1, based on genotype at rs174537. Hepatocytes derived from individuals homozygous with the minor allele at rs174537 (i.e., TT) displayed the slowest metabolic conversion of LA to ARA and significantly reduced FADS1 and FADS2 expression. These results support the feasibility of using 3D human hepatic cultures for the study of human PUFA and lipid metabolism and relevant gene-diet interactions, thereby enabling future nutrition targets in humans."
https://openalex.org/W4206283727,"The housefly, Musca domestica (Diptera: Muscidae), is capable of transmitting many pathogens that cause severe diseases in humans and animals. Mostly the management tactics rely on synthetic chemicals, but these chemicals creates lethal effects on biological ecosystem. For natural and safe options, bio-control strategy is one of the choice. The present study was a part of such effort to use this strategy and validate the biological performance of the potential pupal parasitoid Dirhinus giffardii (Silvestri) against house fly and provide alternative and safe control of filthy flies. This is the first report on parasitism potential and preference of D. giffardii against house fly. The D. giffardii, early reported as an effective pupal parasitoid of tephritid flies, here in the case presented, showed overall 70% reduction in the house fly population by parasitizing pupae. The parasitism efficiency and longevity of hymenopteran parasitoid was remarkably noted two-fold higher and one-fold more female production on house fly pupae as compared to primary hosts (Tephritids). Furthermore, sex ratio of the resultant progeny was also confirmed the dominancy of female by 74% as compared to males. Based on the novel findings we therefore conclude that D. giffardii is the best bio-control agent for controlling house flies."
https://openalex.org/W4206618659,"We compared the clinicopathological characteristics and survival outcomes of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) cases with those of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) cases in various hormone receptor expression subgroups.We compared clinicopathological characteristics, overall survival (OS), and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) between patients with IDC (n = 95,486) and ILC (n = 3,023). In addition, we analyzed the effects of different hormone receptor expression subgroups on survival.The ILC group had more instances of advanced stage and hormonal receptor positivity than did the IDC group (p < 0.001), but the IDC group had higher histological grade and nuclear grade, as well as higher frequency of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and Ki67 expression than did the ILC group (p < 0.001). The OS and BCSS were not significantly different between the IDC and ILC groups. The 5-year OS of the IDC group was 88.8%, while that of the ILC group was 90.6% (p = 0.113). The 5-year BCSS of the IDC group was 94.8%, while that of the ILC group was 95.0% (p = 0.552). When analyzing each hormone receptor expression subgroup, there were no significant differences in survival between the IDC and ILC groups. However, the estrogen receptor (ER) negative/progesterone receptor (PR) negative subgroup showed differences in survival between the IDC and ILC groups. Moreover, the hazard ratio of ILC in the ER negative/PR negative subgroup was 1.345 (95% confidence interval: 1.012-1.788; p = 0.041).Hormone receptor expression should be considered when determining prognosis and treatment regimen for IDC and ILC. Researchers should further study the ER negative/PR negative population to identify treatment and prognostic models that will facilitate the development of individualized therapy for these patients, which is needed for good outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4206911122,"Mental health is a major public health issue that affects social development. This study aims to explore the psychological state of residents of Hainan Island and its influencing factors during the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide a scientific basis for the formulation of psychological counseling measures to be used after the pandemic. We used the nonprobability snowball sampling method to conduct an online survey from February 21 to February 28, 2020, and collected a sample of 533 respondents. Using a binary logistic regression model and network analysis, the psychological state of residents and the main factors were analyzed during the concentrated outbreak of COVID-19 (from January 20 to February 16, 2020). The study found that during the pandemic, 92.7% of the respondents were in a poor state of mind, and 54.2% experienced severe psychological stress. The mental state is spatially expressed as a pattern of “high in the middle and low in the surroundings.” Second, within the four-week sample, the overall psychological tension showed an inverted U-shaped trend. Respondents feeling stressed were most common in the second week, when they accounted for 87.99% of the total. Third, individual characteristics such as gender, age, fixed expenditure, and family size significantly affect the mental state. Women, the elderly, residents with fixed expenditures, and residents with large families are at greater risk of psychological stress. Finally, external factors such as the distance between residents and the location of cases and the node degree of the pandemic transmission network have a significant impact on the psychological state. However, residents in the least developed areas of Hainan Island, which are far away from active cases and have a low node degree, are more prone to psychological pressure. The government needs to pay special attention to these groups when constructing a long-term mechanism of psychological crisis intervention and increase public health resource investment in underdeveloped areas."
https://openalex.org/W4226077436,"There is a rising interest in biotechnology for the compartmentalization of biochemical reactions in water droplets. Several applications, such as the widely used digital PCR, seek to encapsulate a single molecule in a droplet to be amplified. Directed evolution, another technology with growing popularity, seeks to replicate what happens in nature by encapsulating a single gene and the protein encoded by this gene, linking genotype with phenotype. Compartmentalizing reactions in droplets also allows the experimentalist to run millions of different reactions in parallel. Compartmentalization requires a fluid that is immiscible with water and a surfactant to stabilize the droplets. While there are fluids and surfactants on the market that have been used to accomplish encapsulation, there are reported concerns with these. Span® 80, for example, a commonly used surfactant, has contaminants that interfere with various biochemical reactions. Similarly, synthetic fluids distributed by the cosmetic industry allow some researchers to produce experimental results that can be published, but then other researchers fail to reproduce some of these protocols due to the unreliable nature of these products, which are not manufactured with the intent of being used in biotechnology. The most reliable fluids, immiscible with water and suitable for biochemical reactions, are fluorinated fluids. Fluorinated compounds have the peculiar characteristic of being immiscible with water while at the same time not mixing with hydrophobic molecules. This peculiar characteristic has made fluorinated fluids attractive because it seems to be the basis of their being biologically inert. However, commercially available fluorinated fluids have densities between 1.4 to 1.6 g/mL. The higher-than-water density of fluorinated oils complicates handling of the droplets since these would float on the fluid since the water droplets would be less dense. This can cause aggregation and coalescence of the droplets. Here, we report the synthesis, characterization, and use of fluorinated polysiloxane oils that have densities similar to the one of water at room temperature, and when mixed with non-ionic fluorinated surfactants, can produce droplets encapsulating biochemical reactions. We show how droplets in these emulsions can host many biological processes, including PCR, DNA origami, rolling circle amplification (RCA), and Taqman® assays. Some of these use unnatural DNA built from an Artificially Expanded Genetic Information System (AEGIS) with six nucleotide ""letters""."
