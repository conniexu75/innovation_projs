Both genes encode a putative prohormone sequence incorporating the classic two-chain, three cysteine-bonded structure of the relaxin/insulin family and, importantly, contain the RXXXRXX(I/V) motif in the B-chain that is essential for relaxin receptor binding. A peptide derived from the likely proteolytic processing of the H3 relaxin prohormone sequence was synthesized and found to possess relaxin activity in bioassays utilizing the human monocytic cell line, THP-1, that expresses the relaxin receptor. The expression of this novel relaxin gene was studied in mouse tissues using RT-PCR, where transcripts were identified with a pattern of expression distinct from that of the previously characterized mouse relaxin. The highest levels of expression were found in the brain, whereas significant expression was also observed in the spleen, thymus, lung, and ovary. Northern blotting demonstrated an ∼1.2-kb transcript present in mouse brain poly(A) RNA but not in other tissues. These data, together with the localization of transcripts in the pars ventromedialis of the dorsal tegmental nucleus of C57BLK6J mouse brain by in situhybridization histochemistry, suggest a new role for relaxin in neuropeptide signaling processes. Together, these studies describe a third member of the human relaxin family and its equivalent in the mouse.

Knobil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 861-1009Google Scholar). To date, only one relaxin gene has been characterized in most mammalian species, with the exception of the human where two separate genes have been described, designated H1 (2Hudson P. Haley M. Cronk M. Crawford R. Haralambidis J. Tregear G. Shine J. Niall H. Nature. 1983; 301: 628-631Google Scholar) and H2 (3Hudson P. John M. Crawford R. Haralambidis J. Scanlon D. Gorman J. Tregear G. Shine J. Niall H. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2333-2339Google Scholar) relaxin. The peptide encoded by the H2 gene is the major stored and circulating form in the human (4Winslow J.W. Shih A. Bourell J.H. Weiss G. Reed B. Stults J.T. Goldsmith L.T. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2660-2668Google Scholar). H1 relaxin expression is restricted to the decidua, placenta, and prostate (5Hansell D.J. Bryant-Greenwood G.D. Greenwood F.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1991; 72: 899-904Google Scholar); however, the H1 peptide has similar biological activity to that of H2 relaxin in a rat atrial bioassay (6Tan Y.Y. Wade J.D. Tregear G.W. Summers R.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 123: 762-770Google Scholar). The actions of relaxin include an ability to inhibit myometrial contractions, to stimulate remodeling of the connective tissue, and to induce softening of the tissues of the birth canal. Additionally, relaxin increases growth and differentiation of the mammary gland and nipple and induces the breakdown of collagen, one of the main components of connective tissue. Relaxin decreases collagen synthesis and increases the release of collagenases (7Unemori E.N. Amento E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10681-10685Google Scholar). These findings were recently confirmed by the establishment of the relaxin gene-knockout mouse (8Zhao L. Roche P.J. Gunnersen J.M. Hammond V.E. Tregear G.W. Wintour E.M. Beck F. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 445-453Google Scholar), which exhibited a number of phenotypic properties associated with pregnancy. Female mice lacking a functionally active relaxin gene failed to relax and elongate the interpubic ligament of the pubic symphysis and could not suckle their pups, who in turn died within 24 h unless cross-fostered to relaxin wild type or relaxin heterozygous foster mothers. Evidence has accumulated to suggest that relaxin is more than a hormone of pregnancy and acts on cells and tissues other than those of the female reproductive system. Relaxin causes a widening of blood vessels (vasodilatation) in the kidney, mesocecum, lung, and peripheral vasculature, which leads to increased blood flow or perfusion rates in these tissues (9Bani D. Gen. Pharmacol. 1997; 28: 13-22Google Scholar). It also stimulates an increase in heart rate and coronary blood flow and increases both glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow (9Bani D. Gen. Pharmacol. 1997; 28: 13-22Google Scholar). The brain is another target tissue for relaxin, where the peptide has been shown to bind to receptors (10Osheroff P.L. Phillips H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6413-6417Google Scholar, 11Tan Y.Y. Wade J.D. Tregear G.W. Summers R.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 91-98Google Scholar) in the circumventricular organs to affect blood pressure and drinking (12Parry L.J. Poterski A.J.S. Jones S.A. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1990; 2: 53-58Google Scholar, 13Summerlee A.J. Hornsby D.J. Ramsey D.G. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2322-2328Google Scholar, 14Sinnayah P. Burns P. Wade J.D. Weisinger R.S. McKinley M.J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5082-5086Google Scholar). Finally, binding sites have been identified in the prostate gland, implicating increased relaxin production with increased prostatic hyperplasia in older mammals (15Hornsby D.J. Poterski R.S. Summerlee A.J.S. Tregear G.W. Ivell R. Bathgate R.A. Wade J.D. Relaxin 2000: Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Relaxin and Related Peptides. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands2001Google Scholar). Although the progressively increasing actions of relaxin appear to now affect many tissues and cells outside the female reproductive tract, to date only limited sources of relaxin production have been reported. Within the female reproductive tract, relaxin is primarily produced by the corpus luteum (CL)1 in both pregnant and nonpregnant mammalian species, although it attains the highest plasma levels during pregnancy (1Sherwood O.D. Knobil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 861-1009Google Scholar). Depending on the species, relaxin is also produced by the decidua, placenta, and endometrium and in thecal and granulosa cells (16Stewart D.R. VandeVoort C.A. Hum. Reprod. 1999; 14: 338-344Google Scholar) of the ovarian follicle (1Sherwood O.D. Knobil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 861-1009Google Scholar). Another minor source of relaxin production in the female guinea pig is the mammary gland (17Peaker M. Taylor E. Tashima L. Redman T.L. Greenwood F.C. Bryant-Greenwood G.D. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 693-698Google Scholar), whereas the prostate appears to be the major source of relaxin in the male (18Ivell R. Hunt N. Khan-Dawood F. Dawood M.Y. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1989; 66: 251-255Google Scholar, 19Gunnersen J.M. Fu P. Roche P.J. Tregear G.W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 118: 85-94Google Scholar). Immunoreactive relaxin levels and binding sites for relaxin have also been detected in many organs and cells, such as in the heart and brain (1Sherwood O.D. Knobil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 861-1009Google Scholar). Even though relaxin is clearly a paracrine factor, the known sources of relaxin production do not correlate with all the sites of expression. Hence, it is quite possible that other relaxin-like molecules exist, which may contribute to the functions of relaxin described to date and possible additional new functions. Relaxin sequences from many species have been characterized, and it is now well established that relaxin is structurally related to the insulin/IGF family of peptide hormones (1Sherwood O.D. Knobil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 861-1009Google Scholar). All relaxins have a two-chain structure comprising an A- and B-peptide chain linked by disulfide bonds with an intra-chain disulfide bond in the A-chain, analogous to that of insulin. Recently, two new insulin-like members of this peptide family have been identified in the expressed sequence tag (EST) data base (20Conklin D. Lofton-Day C.E. Haldeman B.A. Ching A. Whitmore T.E. Lok S. Jaspers S. Genomics. 1999; 60: 50-56Google Scholar, 21Hsu S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2163-2174Google Scholar). The availability of the human genome sequence provides a unique opportunity to discover other novel relaxin and relaxin-related genes. This study describes the use of the Celera Discovery System and Celera Genomics associated data bases to identify a new human and mouse relaxin gene. The Celera Discovery System and Celera Genomics associated data bases were searched for novel relaxin homologues. Six sequences classified by computational annotation were identified in the biomolecular library, designated as protein subfamily of signaling molecules, protein/peptide hormone, relaxin-related. Two of these sequences corresponded to the previously characterized H1 and H2 relaxins, and three others corresponded to human insulin 4 (INSL4), insulin 5 (INSL5), and insulin 6 (INSL6). The final sequence encoded a peptide with relatively low homology to H1 and H2 relaxin but containing the key structural elements of relaxin peptides. This sequence (Celera accession number CSN002; www.celera.com/publicationlibrary) did not correspond to any sequences in the public data base but had significant homology to a rat EST clone. A subsequent BlastN search of the incomplete mouse genome data base in Celera, using the human sequence, identified genomic fragments with high homology to the human gene. A complete coding sequence was assembled from multiple genome fragments that displayed a similar genomic structure to the human gene. Subsequently, the availability of the complete mouse genome enabled confirmation of this coding sequence and assembly of the entire gene locus. Like the human gene, this sequence (Celera accession number CSN003) did not correspond to any sequence in the public data base but aligned with the same rat EST clone. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted on the human and mouse sequences compared with mouse relaxin and human members of the relaxin/insulin/IGF family using the Megalign program in Lasergene (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI). The peptides and their appropriate GenBankTM accession numbers are as follows: mouse relaxin (Z27088), human insulin (XM 028180), INSL3 (XM 009297), INSL4 (L 34838), INSL5 (XM 001861), INSL6 (NM 007179), IGF1 (NM 000618), and IGF2 (NM 000612). A putative peptide sequence encoded by the H3 gene was assembled by solid phase synthesis procedures based on the predicted signal peptide and proteolytic enzyme cleavage sites between the signal peptide and the B-chain, and the B/C- and C/A-chain junctions of the H3 relaxin prohormone (see “Results” for details). For ease of synthesis we chose to prepare the A- and B-peptides as their C-terminal-amide derivatives. Selectively S-protected A- and B-chains were synthesized on a 0.1 mmol scale by the continuous flow Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid phase method as described previously (22Dawson N.F. Tan Y.Y. Macris M. Otvos Jr., L. Summers R.J. Tregear G.W. Wade J.D. J. Pept. Res. 1999; 53: 542-547Google Scholar). Selective S-protection was afforded for the following cysteine residues: trityl (Trt) for A10,15 and B22, tert-butyl for A24, and acetamidomethyl for A11 and B10 (see Fig.2A for numbering of amino acid residues). On completion of the syntheses, the S-protected A- and B-chains were cleaved from the solid supports and simultaneously side chain-deprotected by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid in the presence of scavengers. Selective disulfide bond formation was achieved essentially as described for the synthesis of bombyxin (23Maruyama K. Nagata K. Tanaka M. Nagasawa H. Isogai A. Ishizaki H. Suzuki A. J. Protein Chem. 1992; 11: 1-12Google Scholar). Peptides were quantitated by duplicate amino acid analysis of 24-h acid hydrolysates on a GBC automatic analyzer (Melbourne, Australia). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) was performed in the linear mode at 19.5 kV on a Bruker Biflex instrument (Bremen, Germany) equipped with delayed ion extraction. Human INSL3 was synthesized using the same methodology used for ovine INSL3 (22Dawson N.F. Tan Y.Y. Macris M. Otvos Jr., L. Summers R.J. Tregear G.W. Wade J.D. J. Pept. Res. 1999; 53: 542-547Google Scholar) and was characterized by MS and amino acid analysis as outlined above. H1 relaxin was synthesized previously (24Wade J.D. Lin F. Salvatore D. Otvos Jr., L. Tregear G.W. Biomed. Pept. Protein Nucleic Acids. 1996; 2: 27-32Google Scholar); recombinant H2 relaxin was a gift from the Connetics Corp. (Palo Alto, CA), and bovine insulin was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The ability of H3 relaxin to induce cAMP production in the human monocytic cell line (THP-1) was compared with H1 and H2 relaxin following the procedure of Parsell and colleagues (25Parsell D.A. Mak J.Y. Amento E.P. Unemori E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27936-27941Google Scholar), with the following modifications: THP-1 cells that had been viability tested using trypan blue were resuspended in media and transferred to a 96-well plate at a density of 60,000 cells/well. Peptides (H1, H2, H3 relaxin, human INSL3, and bovine insulin) were added to the wells together with 1 μm forskolin and 50 μm isobutylmethylxanthine in RPMI media and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The plate was then briefly centrifuged; the media were removed and the cells resuspended in lysis buffer. cAMP levels were measured in the lysates using the cAMP Biotrak EIA system (Amersham Biosciences). The results are expressed as the maximum relaxin response (percent) in comparison to the maximum stimulation of cAMP achieved with H2 relaxin. Data represent the mean ± S.E. of three experiments performed in quadruplicate and are plotted using PRISM (Graphpad Inc., San Diego, CA). THP-1 cells were spun down and resuspended in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mg/ml lysine, 0.01% NaN4, pH 7.5) (25Parsell D.A. Mak J.Y. Amento E.P. Unemori E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27936-27941Google Scholar) to give 2 × 106 cells/well in a 96-well plate. The cells were incubated in binding buffer with 33P-labeled H2 (B33) relaxin (100 pm), labeled as previously described (11Tan Y.Y. Wade J.D. Tregear G.W. Summers R.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 91-98Google Scholar) at 25 °C for 90 min in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled H1, H2 and H3 relaxin (100 pmto 30 nm)). Nonspecific binding was defined with H2 relaxin (1 μm). Cells were harvested using a Packard 96-well plate cell harvester, and Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters were treated with 0.5% polyethyleneimine. The filters were washed three times with modified binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, 50 mmNaCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2), dried in a 37 °C oven, and the radioactivity counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry (TopCountTM, Packard Instrument Co.). The ability of well characterized human relaxin antibodies to recognize H3 relaxin was tested in comparison to H1 and H2 relaxins by radioimmunoassay. Briefly, goat anti-H2 relaxin (26Lucas C. Bald L.N. Martin M.C. Jaffe R.B. Drolet D.W. Mora-Worms M. Bennett G. Chen A.B. Johnston P.D. J. Endocrinol. 1989; 120: 449-457Google Scholar) was coated onto 96-well ELISA plates (Disposable Products, Adelaide, Australia) at a dilution of 1:1000 with 0.05m sodium carbonate buffer at 4 °C overnight. After washing twice with PBS-T (phosphate buffered saline; 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4), dilutions of human relaxin peptides dissolved in 50 μl of assay buffer (1% bovine serum albumin in PBS-T) were added together with 50,000 cpm 125I-labeled relaxin in 50 μl of assay buffer. H2 relaxin was 125I-labeled and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography (27Palejwala S. Stein D. Wojtczuk A. Weiss G. Goldsmith L.T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1208-1212Google Scholar). After an overnight incubation at 4 °C, the plates were washed twice with PBS-T. The antibody-bound125I-labeled H2 relaxin was collected by the addition of 1m NaOH and decanted into tubes for counting on a Packard 5010 gamma counter (Packard Instrument Co.). Experiments were performed at least twice and similar results obtained. Data were plotted as the mean ± S.E. from one representative experiment performed in triplicate and plotted using PRISM. All male and female mice used in these studies were age-matched and had the same background (C57BLK6J). Animals were housed in a controlled environment and maintained on a 14-h light, 10-h dark schedule with access to rodent lab chow (Barastock Stockfeeds, Melbourne, Australia) and water. Female mice (3.5 months old) were mated, and pregnancy was timed from the identification of the vaginal plug. At day 7.5, 10.5, and 18.5 of pregnancy, mice were sacrificed for tissue collection. Tissues were also collected from nonpregnant female and male mice (4 months old). These experiments were approved by the Howard Florey Institute's Animal Experimental Ethics Committee, which adheres to the Australian Code of Practice for the care and use of laboratory animals for scientific purposes. Animals were killed with an overdose of Isofluorane (Abbott Australasia Pty. Ltd., Sydney, Australia). The brain, heart, thymus, spleen, lung, liver, kidneys, skin, and gut were collected along with the reproductive organs from female (ovary, endometrium, myometrium, cervix, vagina; n = 2 for each pregnancy stage) and male (testes, epididymis, prostate;n = 3) mice. From additional animals, male brains (n = 3) were dissected into specific regions including the hypothalamus, cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, medulla, and cerebellum and immediately placed in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until used for RNA preparation. Female brains (n = 3) were collected and immediately frozen over dry ice for in situ hybridization histochemistry (28Burazin T.C.D. Larm J.A. Gundlach A.L. J. Neuroendocrinol. 2001; 13: 358-370Google Scholar). Human CL from women in early pregnancy undergoing surgery for ectopic pregnancies were utilized with the approval of the Howard Florey Institute Human Ethics Committee and the written consent of the patients. Human genomic DNA was extracted from human CL using standard protocols (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Human CL and mouse tissues were finely diced in the presence of liquid nitrogen and immediately homogenized with RNAWiz reagent (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX), and the RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (5 μg) from each sample was used for the reverse transcription (RT) reaction, which was performed using the Superscript II RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) in a 20-μl volume according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 50-μl reaction containing 100 ng of primers and 150 ng of the cDNA template was used for all PCRs. Mouse tissues were screened for M3 relaxin expression using specific forward (5′-TGCGGAGGCTCACGATGGCGC-3′) and reverse (5′-GACAGCAGCTTGCAGGCACGG-3′) primers, which generated a 319-bp product. Mouse relaxin (M1) expression was determined using a specific forward (5′-GTGAATATGCCCGTGAATTGATC-3′) and reverse (5′-AGCGTCGTATCGAAAGGCTCT-3′) primer based on the published sequence (30Evans B.A. John M. Fowler K.J. Summers R.J. Cronk M. Shine J. Tregear G.W. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 10: 15-23Google Scholar), generating a 150-bp product. Human CL cDNA was used in RT-PCRs with specific primers for H3 relaxin, forward 1 (5′-ACGTTCAAAGCGTCTCCGTCC-3′), forward 2 (5′-CGGTGGAGACGATCAGACATC-3′), and reverse (5′ ATGGCAGGACTGGGGCATTGG-3′), generating products of 504- and 310-bp for forward 1/reverse and forward 2/reverse, respectively. All primer combinations crossed the single introns in the mouse and human relaxin sequences, respectively, so as to control for genomic DNA contamination. In all experiments GAPDH forward (5′-TGATGACATCAAGAAGGTGG-3′) and reverse (5′-TTTCTTACTCCTTGGAGGCC-3′) primers generating a product of 246 bp were used in separate PCRs to control for quality and equivalent loading of the cDNA. M3 relaxin expression by RT-PCR was performed on cDNA samples extracted from at least two animals, although the results from only one representative experiment are shown. The mouse PCRs were completed in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Gene Amplifier using the following (touch down) annealing temperatures: 64 (2 cycles), 63 (2 cycles), 62 (2 cycles), 61 (2 cycles), and 60 °C (32 cycles). H3 relaxin expression in human CL cDNA was performed by RT-PCR at the following annealing temperatures: 60 (2 cycles), 59 (2 cycles), 58 (2 cycles), 57 (2 cycles), and 56 °C (32 cycles). Aliquots of the PCR products were electrophoresed on 2% (w/v) agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide and photographed. Mouse tissue samples were transferred to Hybond NX membranes (Amersham Biosciences) for Southern blot analysis. An additional PCR was performed using mouse brain and ovarian cDNA using the reverse M3 primer (above) and a forward primer from in front of the ATG start codon (5′-GGGTCGCAGGCATCTCAACTG-3′). The resulting product contained the full coding sequence and therefore confirmed the Celera-based sequence. PCR was performed as above but with the following annealing temperatures: 60 (2 cycles), 59 (2 cycles), 58 (2 cycles), 57 (2 cycles), and 56 °C (32 cycles). To generate a specific H3 relaxin cDNA probe for 32P labeling and to utilize it for subsequent probing of a human multitissue array, RT-PCR was performed on human genomic DNA (50 ng). Specific forward (5′-CGGATGCAGATGCTGATGAAG-3′) and reverse (5′-GTGCCTGAGCCCACAGTGCCT-3′) primers from the exon II sequence of the H3 relaxin gene were used at the following annealing temperatures: 60 (2 cycles), 59 (2 cycles), 58 °C (2 cycles), 56 (2 cycles), and 54 °C (32 cycles). These products as well as the mouse PCR products described above were separated on 2% agarose gels. Bands were detected of the expected size under UV light (mouse 319 and 478 bp; human 374 bp), excised, and eluted from the gel using the Ultraclean TM 15 DNA purification kit (Geneworks Pty. Ltd., Adelaide, Australia). The bands were subsequently subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and multiple subclones were then sequenced on both strands using the ABI PRISM 377 automatic DNA sequencer, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems, Melbourne, Australia). PCR products on membranes were hybridized against specific internal oligonucleotide primers for the M1 relaxin (5′-CAAGCAGAGCTGGCTCCTCCTGGCTCAAAGCCAATCTTC-3′) and M3 relaxin (5′-AATTTGGCTCTTGCTACAGCCCCACTCGCAGCAACTGCT-3′) cDNA sequences, which had been labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Hybridization was performed at 55 °C overnight in 5× SSC (1× SSC: 0.15 m NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7), 5× Denhardt's, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml sonicated herring sperm. Membranes were washed three times for 5 min in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature followed by a 30-min wash at 55 °C in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, before being exposed to BioMAX MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 24 h at room temperature. To examine further the expression of M3 relaxin compared with M1 relaxin mRNA, total RNA (5–25 μg) from the heart, brain, lung, thymus, and spleen of male mice and ovary, endometrium, myometrium, cervix, and vagina of female mice pooled from day 7.5, 10.5, and 18.5 of pregnancy were run on standard MOPS/formaldehyde gels. RNA was then transferred to optimized Hybond-NX membranes and probed for M3 and M1 relaxin and GAPDH mRNA with32P-labeled probes corresponding to the PCR products generated by specific primers (see above). These products were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the specific reverse primers (above) and T7 polymerase as described previously (31Bathgate R. Moniac N. Bartlick B. Schumacher M. Fields M. Ivell R. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 1090-1098Google Scholar). The membrane was hybridized at 65 °C overnight in 0.25 mNaH2PO4, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 20% SDS, followed by three washes for 5 min in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature, and finally a 30-min wash at 65 °C in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Membranes were first exposed to a PhosphorImager plate for 48 h at room temperature before being analyzed in a FujiX 2000 PhosphorImager (Fuji Photo Co., Japan) and then exposed to BioMAX MS film (Integrated Sciences, Melbourne, Australia) together with a Hyperscreen (Amersham Biosciences) at −80 °C. In a separate experiment, total RNA (200 μg) from the male brain was purified to poly(A) RNA using an mRNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences), and Northern blotting together with total RNA from day 18.5 ovary (5 μg) was performed as described above. A human multiple tissue expression array (CLONTECH laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) was hybridized with a 32P-labeled H3 relaxin-specific probe according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The 374-bp fragment of the H3 relaxin sequence isolated from genomic DNA was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the H3 relaxin-specific reverse primer (described above) and T7 polymerase (31Bathgate R.

Coronal sections (14 μm) were cut on a cryostat at −16 °C and mounted on silane-coated slides. Sections were delipidated in chloroform for 10 min, rinsed, and stored in 100% ethanol at 4 °C.

Probes were labeled with [α-35S]dATP (1200 Ci/mmol; Amrad, Melbourne, Australia) to a specific activity of 1 × 109 dpm/μg using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals (32Wisden W. Morris B.J. Wisden W. Morris B.J. In Situ Hybridization Protocols for the Brain. Academic Press, London1994: 9-34Google Scholar)). Screening of the sequences used against gene sequence data bases (Celera, EMBL. and GenBankTM; NCBI/National Institutes of Health Blast Service) revealed homology only with the appropriate M1 and M3 relaxin mRNAs. Sections were incubated overnight at 42 °C with multiple35S-labeled probes (30 fmol each probe/slide) in hybridization buffer containing 50% formamide, 4× SSC, 10% dextran sulfate, and 0.2 m dithiothreitol. Slides were washed in 1× SSC at 55 °C for 1 h, rinsed in 0.1× SSC, and then dehydrated before being apposed to Kodak BioMAX MR for 10 days. The authenticity of the hybridization was confirmed by the demonstration that the signal could be successfully blocked in all areas by the addition of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled probes to the hybridization buffer, except those that corresponded to nonspecific or background hybridization (data not shown). In addition, three oligonucleotide probes were used that were complementary to different, nonoverlapping regions of the M3 relaxin gene sequence. Searches of the Celera Discovery System and Celera Genomics associated data bases resulted in the identification of a novel human relaxin gene.

Indeed, ZO-1, -2, and -3, each of which contains three PDZ domains, were shown to directly bind to claudins. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified ZO-1 and MUPP1 (multi-PDZ domain protein 1) as binding partners for the COOH terminus of claudin-1. MUPP1 has been identified as a protein that contains 13 PDZ domains, but it has not been well characterized. In vitro binding assays with recombinant MUPP1 confirmed the interaction between MUPP1 and claudin-1 and identified PDZ10 as the responsible domain for this interaction. A polyclonal antibody specific for MUPP1 was then generated. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy as well as immunoelectron microscopy with this antibody revealed that in polarized epithelial cells MUPP1 was exclusively concentrated at TJs. Furthermore, in vitro binding and transfection experiments showed that junctional adhesion molecule, another TJ adhesion molecule, also bound to the PDZ9 domain of MUPP1. These findings suggested that MUPP1 is concentrated at TJs in epithelial cells through its binding to claudin and junctional adhesion molecule and that it may function as a multivalent scaffold protein that recruits various proteins to TJs.

They create the primary barrier to the diffusion of solutes through the paracellular pathway and maintain cell polarity as a boundary between the apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains (1Farquhar M.G.

On ultrathin section electron microscopy, TJs appear as a series of discrete sites of apparent fusion, involving the outer leaflet of the plasma membranes of adjacent cells (1Farquhar M.G. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 375-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (2078) Google Scholar). On freeze-fracture electron microscopy, TJs appear as a set of continuous, anastomosing intramembranous particle strands (TJ strands) (6Staehelin L.A. J.

The molecular architecture of TJs has been unraveled rapidly in recent years. Two distinct types of integral membrane proteins, occludin and claudins, have been identified as constituents of TJ strands (8Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita Sa.

Both occludin and claudins bear four transmembrane domains but do not show any sequence similarity with each other. Claudins and occludin are thought to constitute the backbone of TJ strands and to modulate some functions of TJs, respectively (5Tsukita Sh. Furuse M. Itoh M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Al-Sabban E. et al.Science. 1999; 285: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). It was recently shown that heterogeneous claudin species (and also occludin) are co-polymerized to form individual TJ strands as heteropolymers and that between adjacent cells claudin molecules adhere with each other in both homotypic and heterotypic manners except in some combinations (20Furuse M. Sasaki H. Tsukita Sh. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 891-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 21Tsukita Sh. Furuse M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). In addition to claudins and occludin, another type of integral membrane protein, JAM (junctional adhesion molecule) belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, was also reported to be concentrated at TJs (22Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L. Romano M. Fruscella P. Panzeri C. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Villa A. Simmons D. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar), but this molecule did not appear to constitute TJ strands per se but to laterally associate with strands (23Itoh M. Sasaki H. Furuse M. Ozaki H. Kita T. Tsukita Sh. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Interestingly most claudin species (and also JAM) end in valine at their COOH termini (5Tsukita Sh. Furuse M. Itoh M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1979) Google Scholar). This suggests that these COOH termini bind directly to PDZ domains (24Ponting C.P. Phillips C. Davies K.E. Blake D.J. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 25Ranganathan R. Ross E.M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R770-R773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As the cytoplasmic surface of individual TJ strands is expected to appear as a toothbrush consisting of numerous densely packed short COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tails of claudins, TJ strands including laterally associated JAM molecules may strongly attract and recruit many PDZ domain-containing proteins (5Tsukita Sh. Furuse M. Itoh M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1979) Google Scholar,23Itoh M. Sasaki H. Furuse M. Ozaki H. Kita T. Tsukita Sh. J.

Recently PDZ domains of PAR-3 were shown to be associated with JAM (and not with claudins) (23Itoh M. Sasaki H. Furuse M. Ozaki H. Kita T. Tsukita Sh. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 43Ebnet K. Suzuki A. Horikoshi Y. Hirose T. zu Brickwedde M.-K.M. Ohno S. Vestweber D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3738-3748Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), but it remains unknown how the other PDZ domain-containing proteins are recruited to TJs. In this study, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to screen for PDZ domain-containing molecules that interact with the COOH terminus of claudin-1 and identified MUPP1 (multi-PDZ domain protein 1), which contains 13 PDZ domains in tandem (44Ullmer C. Schmuck K. Figge A. Lubbert H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 45Simpson E.H. Suffolk R. Jackson I.J. Genomics. 1999; 59: 102-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This molecule was concentrated at TJs in polarized epithelial cells. Interestingly, MUPP1 bound not only to claudin-1 but also to JAM at its PDZ10 and 9, respectively. These findings provide new insight into the molecular architecture of TJs. A GST fusion protein with part of MUPP1 (aa 1570–1699) containing PDZ10 was produced inEscherichia coli, purified, and used as an antigen to raise polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) in rabbits. One of these pAbs (B4) was used after affinity purification with the GST fusion protein. Mouse anti-ZO-1 mAb (T8-754) and rabbit anti-JAM pAb (C4) were generated and characterized previously (23Itoh M. Sasaki H. Furuse M. Ozaki H. Kita T. Tsukita Sh. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 31Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Kitani-Yasuda T. Tsukita Sa. Tsukita Sh. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Rat anti-E-cadherin mAb (ECCD2) was a generous gift from Dr. M. Takeichi (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). Rabbit anti-ZO-1 pAb, mouse anti-Myc tag mAb, and rabbit anti-maltose-binding protein (MBP) pAb were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA), MBL (Nagoya, Japan), and New England BioLabs Inc. (Beverly, MA), respectively. MDCK cells, F9 cells, Eph4 cells, L cells, and JL cells (23Itoh M. Sasaki H. Furuse M. Ozaki H. Kita T. Tsukita Sh. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. To construct the bait vector, the cDNA fragment encoding the COOH-terminal region (aa 188–211) of mouse claudin-1 was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pBTM116 containing the LexA DNA-binding domain and a tryptophan marker (pBTM116-Cld1). This vector was introduced into yeast cells (strain L40) followed by selection on medium lacking tryptophan. Then, the yeast cells harboring bait plasmids were transformed with a mouse embryo cDNA library that had been cloned into pVP16 containing the VP16 transactivating domain and a leucine marker. This library was a generous gift from Dr. J. Behrens (Max-Delbruck Center for Molecular Biology, Berlin). About 2 × 107 yeast transformants were plated on synthetic complete medium lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan, and ∼500 colonies were picked up after 48–96 h of incubation. After the assay for β-galactosidase activity on filters, seven positive clones were obtained. Prey plasmids were recovered from these positive clones (Prey #1–#7), and the sequences of their inserts were determined. To confirm their interactions, the prey plasmids or a control plasmid (pVP16) were retransformed into L40 with pBTM116-Cld1 or pBTM116. Their interactions were quantified in liquid culture by monitoring the conversion ofo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG) too-nitrophenol and d-galactose due to the β-galactosidase enzyme encoded by the reporter plasmid. To isolate a full-length cDNA encoding mouse MUPP1, a mouse F9 λ ZAP cDNA library was screened by plaque hybridization using the digoxigenin-labeled NotI fragment of prey #4 as a probe. This screening yielded several positive clones, and the longest clone contained a complete open reading frame (ORF) of MUPP1 (pSK-MUPP1). To construct a vector for Myc-tagged MUPP1 transfection, the cDNA fragment encoding the entire open reading frame of mouse MUPP1 was amplified by PCR using pSK-MUPP1 as a template and subcloned into pSK-7myc (46Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Moroi S. Tsukita Sh. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The Myc-tagged MUPP1 fragment was isolated from pSK-7myc and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pME18S or pCAGGSneodelEcoRI (47Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4524) Google Scholar) to produce pME18S-MUPP1–7myc or pCAGGSneodelEcoRI-MUPP1–7myc, respectively. L cells and JL cells were co-transfected with 3 μg of pME18S-MUPP1–7myc and 0.3 μg of pSV2bsr. Eph4 cells were transfected with 3 μg of pCAGGSneodelEcoRI-MUPP1–7myc. After 43 h in culture, cells were replated onto four 9-cm dishes in the presence of 8 μg/ml puromycin, 1.5 μg/ml blasticidin, or 500 μg/ml neomycin, respectively, to select stable transfectants. Drug-resistant cells were isolated and screened by immunoblotting and/or immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-c-Myc tag mAb. Cells plated on glass coverslips were fixed with 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min, and then washed three times with PBS. After soaking in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, samples were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h in a moist chamber. They were then washed three times with PBS followed by incubation for 30 min with secondary antibodies. Samples were washed with PBS three times, embedded in 95% glycerol-PBS containing 0.1%para-phenylenediamine and 1% n-propyl gallate, and then examined with a Zeiss Axiophoto photomicroscope (Carl Zeiss) or MRC1024 confocal fluorescence microscope (Bio-Rad) equipped with a Zeiss Axiophoto II photomicroscope. Immunoelectron microscopy using ultrathin cryosections was performed essentially according to the method developed by Tokuyasu (48Tokuyasu K.T. Histochem. J. 1980; 12: 381-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Small pieces of small intestine were dissected out from adult mice and fixed in 1.2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 30 min at 4 °C. After being infused with 2 m sucrose containing 20% polyvinylpyrrolidone at 4 °C overnight, samples were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and then cut into ultrathin cryosections at −90 °C using a glass knife with an FC-S low temperature sectioning system (Reichert-Jung, Vienna, Austria). Cryosections ∼0.5 μm thick were processed for immunofluorescence microscopy as described above. Cryosections ∼70 nm thick were collected on carbon-coated Formvar-filmed grids and then put on a 2% gelatin bed in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C. Grids were washed six times with PBS containing 10 mm glycine (PBS-G) and incubated with PBS-G containing 1% BlockAce (Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) for 10 min. Samples were again washed with PBS-G four times and then incubated with rabbit anti-MUPP1 pAb for 1 h. After washing with PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin seven times, sections were incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to 10-nm gold colloid (British BioCell International Ltd.) for 1 h. Sections were washed with PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin seven times and with PBS six times. Sections were then fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 10 min and then washed with distilled water six times followed by staining with 2% methylcellulose containing 0.5% uranyl acetate for 10 min. Samples were air-dried and examined with a 1200EX electron microscope (JEOL) at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. The cDNA fragments encoding the cytoplasmic domain of claudin-1, the cytoplasmic domain of JAM, and the cytoplasmic domain of claudin-1 lacking its COOH-terminal YV were amplified using specific primers and subcloned into pGEX vector as described previously (16Morita K.

For production of MBP fusion proteins with individual PDZ domains of MUPP1, the following cDNAs were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pMAL-CRI (New England Biolabs Inc.): PDZ1 (aa 124–235), PDZ2 (aa 244–347), PDZ3 (aa 363–472), PDZ4 (aa 531–637), PDZ5 (aa 678–779), PDZ6 (aa 992–1027), PDZ7 (aa 1124–1241), PDZ8 (aa 1323–1430), PDZ9 (aa 1456–1551), PDZ10 (aa 1600–1700), PDZ11 (aa 1695–1801), PDZ12 (aa 1832–1942), PDZ13 (aa 1957–2055), PDZ1–5 (aa 134–779), PDZ6–9 (aa 992–1551), and PDZ10–13 (aa 1610–2055). These recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli (DH5α). GST fusion proteins expressed in E. coli were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). After washing with PBS, the beads were incubated with lysate ofE. coli expressing MBP fusion proteins followed by washing with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. Bound proteins were then eluted with 300 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 20 mm glutathione. Each eluate was processed for SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-MBP pAb. One-dimensional SDS-PAGE (10–12.5% gel) was performed based on the method of Laemmli (49Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), and proteins were electrophoretically transferred from gels onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were soaked in 5% skimmed milk and incubated with the primary antibodies. After washing with PBS, the membranes were incubated with biotinylated second antibodies for rabbit, rat, or mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). They were then washed with PBS followed by incubation with streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The enzyme reaction was visualized using nitroblue tetrazolium and bromochloroindolyl phosphate. We generated a LexA-binding domain fusion protein containing the COOH-terminal 24 amino acids of mouse claudin-1. This fusion protein was expressed in yeast and did not activate the His or β-galactosidase reporter genes when expressed alone or in combination with control constructs. Approximately 2 × 107 clones from a mouse embryo cDNA library were screened with the claudin-1-LexA construct. Screening under selective conditions (His−, Leu−, and Trp−) yielded seven positive clones. To determine the identity of each of the seven clones, sequencing was carried out. As shown in Fig. 1A, three of the clones were found to contain plasmids encoding the PDZ1 domain of ZO-1. Considering that the COOH terminus of claudins interacts directly with the PDZ1 domain of ZO-1 (33Itoh M. Furuse M. Morita K. Kubota K. Saitou M. Tsukita Sh. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1351-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar), the isolation of a ZO-1-PDZ1-encoding plasmid confirmed that the library screening had worked. Two other plasmids were found to encode the PDZ10-containing region of MUPP1 (Fig. 1A). This molecule was initially identified as a binding protein for the 5-HT2C receptor (44Ullmer C. Schmuck K. Figge A. Lubbert H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and sequencing of its cDNA showed that unusually it contains 13 PDZ domains. As shown in Fig. 1B, the β-galactosidase assay confirmed the specific interaction of the COOH-terminal region of claudin-1 with MUPP1 as well as ZO-1. The results obtained from yeast two-hybrid screening suggested that PDZ10 of MUPP1 binds to the COOH terminus of claudin-1. Then we performed in vitrobinding assays to examine whether claudin-1 binds to MUPP1 and if so, which PDZ domain(s) of MUPP1 is responsible for this binding. First, MUPP1 was divided into three pieces from PDZ1 to 5 (PDZ1–5), from PDZ6 to 9 (PDZ6–9), and from PDZ10 to 13 (PDZ10–13). We then produced MBP fusion protein with these three segments of MUPP1 in E. coli, and their crude lysates containing recombinant MBP-PDZ1–5, MPB-PDZ6–9, or MBP-PDZ10–13 were mixed with beads conjugated with the GST fusion protein with the cytoplasmic domain of claudin-1 (GST-Cld-1). Bound proteins were then eluted from beads, and each eluate was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-MBP pAb. As shown in Fig.2A, PDZ10–13, but not MBP-PDZ1–5 or MPB-PDZ6–9, was specifically associated with GST-Cld-1. This binding was abolished when the COOH-terminal YV was deleted from GST-Cld-1. Then to narrow down the domain responsible for the interaction between PDZ10–13 and GST-Cld-1, MBP fusion proteins with PDZ10, 11, 12, and 13 were produced separately in E. coli. As shown in Fig. 2B, only PDZ10 bound to GST-Cld-1, and again this interaction required the COOH-terminal YV of GST-Cld-1. These findings indicated that among 13 PDZ domains of MUPP1 PDZ10 showed strong affinity to the COOH terminus of claudin-1. To examine whether MUPP1 is localized at TJs, we raised a pAb against the GST fusion protein with a part of mouse MUPP1 (aa 1570–1699) containing PDZ10 (GST-PDZ10/MUPP1). As shown by immunoblotting, the affinity-purified pAb specifically recognized GST-PDZ10/MUPP1 inE. coli lysates (but not recombinant full-length ZO-1) as well as a single band around 250 kDa in lysates of cultured epithelial cells (Fig. 3A). Judging from the calculated molecular mass of mouse MUPP1 (∼250 kDa), we concluded that this pAb specifically recognized the band of MUPP1. As shown in Fig. 3A, the molecular mass of MUPP1 appeared to be slightly different between mouse cells and dog MDCK cells, but it was not clear whether this difference was attributable to species-related differences or to alternative splicing as reported previously (50Mancini A. Koch A. Stefan M. Niemann H. Tamura T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Next we evaluated this pAb as a tool for immunofluorescence microscopy. For this purpose, we cloned full-length cDNA encoding MUPP1 from the mouse F9 cell cDNA library, constructed an expression vector for Myc-tagged MUPP1, and then introduced it into cultured mouse epithelial Eph4 cells. Stable transfectants were mixed and co-cultured with parental nontransfected cells followed by double staining with anti-Myc mAb and anti-ZO-1 pAb (Fig. 3B, a andb). Exogenously overexpressed MUPP1 was distributed in the cytoplasm as well as the nucleus but was significantly concentrated at cell-cell borders, and its distribution appeared to coincide with that of ZO-1. When these co-cultured cells were double stained with anti-Myc mAb and anti-MUPP1 pAb, anti-MUPP1 pAb stained the cell-cell borders of Myc-positive transfectants more intensely than those of nontransfected cells (Fig. 3B, c and d). These findings indicated that this anti-MUPP1 pAb specifically recognized exogenous as well as endogenous MUPP1 in Eph4 cells. We then examined the subcellular distribution of endogenous MUPP1 in fully polarized MDCK cells by confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 4, when cells were double stained with anti-MUPP1 pAb and anti-ZO-1 mAb, the MUPP1 signal precisely coincided with the ZO-1 signal at the most apical region of lateral membranes both in on-face and vertical sectional images. In contrast, E-cadherin was distributed along lateral membranes with some concentration at the junctional region, and vertical sectional images showed that MUPP1 was concentrated more apically. Although the degree of concentration of MUPP1 varied depending on epithelial cell type (data not shown), these findings suggested that MUPP1 is concentrated at TJs. As shown in Fig. 4, d–f, however, the MUPP1/E-cadherin co-staining showed a significant overlap by confocal microscopy. Therefore, to clarify this point, we next examined the subcellular localization of MUPP1 in mouse intestinal epithelial cells. When cryosections ∼0.5 μm thick were double stained with anti-MUPP1 pAb/anti-ZO-1 mAb or anti-MUPP1 pAb/anti-E-cadherin mAb, MUPP1 was concentrated at the ZO-1-positive dots that were located more apically than E-cadherin (Fig. 5,a–f). Then cryosections ∼70 nm thick were labeled with anti-MUPP1 pAb followed by colloidal gold-conjugated secondary antibodies and examined by electron microscopy. As shown in Fig. 5,g and h, MUPP1 was exclusively localized at TJs. In addition to claudins, in TJs another adhesion molecule called JAM was also reported to interact with PDZ domain-containing proteins such as ZO-1 and PAR-3 (23Itoh M. Sasaki H. Furuse M. Ozaki H. Kita T. Tsukita Sh. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 43Ebnet K. Suzuki A. Horikoshi Y. Hirose T. zu Brickwedde M.-K.M. Ohno S. Vestweber D.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20520-20526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Therefore, to examine the interaction of MUPP1 with JAM, we performedin vitro binding experiments using GST fusion proteins with the cytoplasmic domain of JAM (GST-JAM) and recombinant PDZ1–13 of MUPP1. As shown in Fig. 6A, among the 13 PDZ domains only PDZ9 of MUPP1 appeared to bind to JAM specifically. Next to confirm this PDZ-mediated interaction of MUPP1 with JAM within cells, we transfected Myc-tagged MUPP1 into L cells exogenously expressing JAM (JL cells) as well as parental L cells, and stable transfectants were obtained followed by double staining with anti-JAM pAb and anti-Myc mAb. As shown in Fig. 6B, a andb in JL cells expressing myc-MUPP1, JAM was concentrated at cell-cell borders, which recruited myc-MUPP1 to the cell-cell adhesion sites. Considering that in parental L cells expressing myc-MUPP1 no concentration of MUPP1 at cell-cell borders was detected (Fig.6B, c and d), we concluded that JAM binds to PDZ9 of MUPP1 (Fig. 7). TJ strands are regarded as heteropolymers of claudins (5Tsukita Sh. Furuse M. Itoh M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1979) Google Scholar, 21Tsukita Sh. Furuse M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Thus, numerous short COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domains of claudins with valine at their ends are expected to originate from the cytoplasmic surface of TJ strands, which led us to speculate that this surface strongly attracts various PDZ domain-containing proteins. Therefore, we searched for PDZ domain-containing proteins that specifically bind to claudin-1 by yeast two-hybrid screening. As a result, in addition to ZO-1 that was previously reported to bind directly to claudin-1, a very unusual PDZ domain-containing molecule, MUPP1, was picked up as a claudin-1-binding protein: this molecule contained 13 PDZ domains. The claudin-1/MUPP1 interaction was confirmed by the in vitrobinding assay. MUPP1 was initially identified as a protein that interacts with the COOH terminus of the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2C receptor (44Ullmer C. Schmuck K. Figge A. Lubbert H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 45Simpson E.H. Suffolk R. Jackson I.J. Genomics. 1999; 59: 102-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 52Becamel C.

This protein was also reported to be associated with c-Kit (50Mancini A. Koch A. Stefan M. Niemann H. Tamura T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the membrane-spanning proteoglycan NG2 (53Barritt D.S. Pearn M.T. Zisch A.H. Lee S.S. Javier R.T. Pasquale E.B. Stallcup W.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and adenovirus E4-ORF1 and high-risk papillomavirus type 18 E6 oncoproteins (54Lee S.S. Glaunsinger B. Mantovani F. Banks L. Javier R.T. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9680-9693Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) but has not been well characterized, especially in terms of its subcellular localization. In this study, we generated a pAb specific for MUPP1, and by immunofluorescence as well as immunoelectron microscopy we concluded that in simple epithelial cells MUPP1 is concentrated at TJs, favoring the in vivointeraction between MUPP1 and claudins. JAM is another integral membrane protein that is concentrated at TJs in epithelial cells (22Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L. Romano M. Fruscella P. Panzeri C. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Villa A. Simmons D. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). Recently the spatial relationship between JAM and claudin-based TJ strands have been examined in detail, leading to the following molecular architectural model for TJs (23Itoh M. Sasaki H. Furuse M. Ozaki H. Kita T. Tsukita Sh. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar): the cytoplasmic tails of claudins, which originated from the surface of TJ strands, directly bind to the PDZ1 domain of ZO-1 (and also ZO-2/ZO-3) (33Itoh M. Furuse M. Morita K. Kubota K. Saitou M. Tsukita Sh. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1351-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the COOH terminus of JAM showed affinity to the PDZ3 domain of ZO-1 (and probably also ZO-2/ZO-3) (23Itoh M. Sasaki H. Furuse M. Ozaki H. Kita T. Tsukita Sh. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 51Bazzoni G. Martinez-Estrada O.M. Orsenigo F. Cordenonsi M. Citi S. Dejana E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20520-20526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Through these interactions, JAM might be recruited and tethered to TJ strands through ZO-1/ZO-2/ZO-3. Furthermore, JAM molecules laterally aggregate to form oligomers (55Bazzoni G. Martinez-Estrada O.M. Mueller F. Nelboeck P. Schmid G. Bartfai T. Dejana E. Brockhaus M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30970-30976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), which would allow the recruitment of additional JAM molecules around TJ strands. As these JAM molecules might be free of ZO-1/ZO-2/ZO-3, they could recruit other PDZ domain-containing proteins such as PAR-3 and then also its binding proteins such as atypical protein kinase C, PAR-6, and Cdc42 to TJs (39Joberty G. Petersen C. Gao L. Macara I.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 40Lin D. Edwards A.S. Fawcett J.P. Mbamalu G. Scott J.D. Pawson T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 41Qiu R.G. Abo A. Martin G.S. Curr.

Cell Biol. 2001; 19: 1183-1196Crossref Scopus (380) Google Scholar). This study showed that MUPP1 is similar to ZO-1 in several points. Both MUPP1 and ZO-1 are concentrated at TJs but not at cadherin-based adherens junctions in polarized epithelial cells. Furthermore, both bind to claudins and JAM at nearly located PDZ domains within individual molecules (see Fig. 7). Thus, in a manner similar to ZO-1, MUPP1 might also function as a cross-linker between claudin-based TJ strands and JAM oligomers in TJs. However, the most characteristic feature of MUPP1, i.e. the most characteristic difference of MUPP1 from ZO-1, is the occurrence of 13 PDZ domains in tandem within single MUPP1 molecules. This would indicate that many integral membrane proteins other than claudins and JAM can be tethered to the claudin-based TJ strands through MUPP1 molecules. Indeed, as mentioned above, a serotonin receptor (44Ullmer C. Schmuck K. Figge A. Lubbert H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 45Simpson E.H. Suffolk R.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and the membrane-spanning proteoglycan NG2 (53Barritt D.S. Pearn M.T. Zisch A.H. Lee S.S. Javier R.T. Pasquale E.B. Stallcup W.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) were reported to bind to MUPP1, although it remained unclear whether these membrane proteins are concentrated at TJs in epithelial cells. In addition to membrane proteins, MUPP1 would also recruit various cytoplasmic proteins to TJs. For example, as mentioned above, MUPP1 was reported to bind to viral oncogene products (54Lee S.S. Glaunsinger B. Mantovani F. Banks L. Javier R.T. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9680-9693Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that MUPP1 is involved in the formation of macromolecular complexes just beneath the plasma membranes at TJs, which might play an important role in the regulation of the growth and/or differentiation of epithelial cells. It is premature to further discuss the physiological functions of MUPP1 at junctions. One way to clarify the physiological functions of MUPP1 would be to search for the binding partners of the individual PDZ domains of MUPP1.

Takeichi (Kyoto University) for the kind gift of anti-E-cadherin mAb."

The abbreviated designations of glycolipids are according to IUPAC-IUC nomenclature Many pathogenic bacteria have variable cell-surface glycoconjugates such as capsules in Streptococcus spp. andNeisseria meningitidis (1Roberts I.S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 285-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), lipopolysaccharides in Gram-negative bacteria (2Preston A. Mandrell R.E. Gibson B.W. Apicella M.A. Crit. Rev.

Chem. 2001; 276: 26479-26485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In mucosal pathogens, the variability of cell-surface polysaccharides has been shown to play a major role in virulence (4Moxon E.R. Kroll J.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 150: 65-85PubMed Google Scholar). This variation is caused by the diversity of monosaccharide components and the linkages between them, derivatization with noncarbohydrate moieties, and in some cases, by the length and sequence of the repeating units. The variation of these glycan structures can sometimes be correlated with a specific gene complement, but it is probable that other genetic mechanisms are also employed to create variable cell-surface glycoconjugates. The DNA sequencing of the relevant genetic loci from multiple strains of a pathogen can provide insights into the genetic origins of important strain variable traits such as cell-surface glycoconjugates. The mucosal pathogen Campylobacter jejuni has been recognized as an important cause of acute gastroenteritis in humans (5Allos B.M. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2001; 32: 1201-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar) and has been shown to have variable cell-surface carbohydrates that are associated with virulence (6Bacon D.J. Szymanski C.M.

Moran A.P. Infect. Immun. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). Epidemiological studies have shown that Campylobacter infections are more common thanSalmonella infections in developed countries, and they are also an important cause of diarrheal diseases in developing countries.C. jejuni is also considered the most frequent antecedent infection to the development of Guillain-Barré syndrome, a form of neuropathy that is the most common cause of generalized paralysis since the eradication of poliomyelitis in developed countries (8Jacobs B.C. Rothbarth P.H. van der Meché F.G.A. Herbrink P. Schmitz P.I.M. de Klerk M.A. van Doorn P.A. Neurology. 1998; 51: 1110-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). The core oligosaccharides of low molecular weight lipo-oligosaccharides (LOS)1 of many C. jejuni strains have been shown to exhibit molecular mimicry of the carbohydrate moieties of gangliosides (Fig. 1). Terminal oligosaccharides identical to those of GM1a, GM2, GM3, GD1a, GD1c, GD3, and GT1a gangliosides have all been found in various C. jejuni strains (see Table I for references). Molecular mimicry of host structures by the saccharide portion of LOS is considered to be a virulence factor of various mucosal pathogens, which may use this strategy to evade the immune response (9Moran A.P. Prendergast M.M. Appelmelk B.J. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1996; 16: 105-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mimicry between C. jejuni LOS outer core structures and gangliosides has also been suggested to act as a trigger for autoimmune mechanisms in the development of Guillain-Barré syndrome (10Yuki N.

The Penner serotyping system of C. jejuni is based on heat-stable antigens, and it was proposed that the specificity is due to LOS and/or lipopolysaccharide-type molecules (16Penner J.L.

However, recent biochemical and genetic studies suggest that capsular polysaccharides account for Penner serotype specificity (6Bacon D.J. Szymanski C.M. Burr D.H. Silver R.P. Alm R.A. Guerry P. Mol.

Consequently, we decided to associate the published LOS outer core structures (Fig. 1) with the specific strain identification numbers (ATCC, NCTC, etc.) rather than with the Penner types, although the latter are also provided for convenient reference (Table I). The identification of the genes involved in LOS synthesis and the study of their regulation are of considerable interest for a better understanding of the pathogenesis mechanisms used by these bacteria. The availability of the complete genome sequence of C. jejuni NCTC 11168 (19Parkhill J. Wren B.W. Mungall K. Ketley J.M. Churcher C. Basham D. Chillingworth T. Davies R.M. Feltwell T. Holroyd S.

The genome sequence was also used to clone the corresponding LOS biosynthesis locus in other C. jejunistrains (24Gilbert M. Brisson J.-R. Karwaski M.-F. Michniewicz J. Cunningham A.-M. Wu Y.

Because cell-surface structures such as the LOS are recognized as antigens by the host, it is therefore not surprising that microorganisms will modulate these structures to increase the chances of evading the immune system. The C. jejuni strains used in this study were shown to express a total of 8 different sialylated LOS outer cores (Fig. 1 and see Table I for references). The LOS biosynthesis loci of C. jejuni OH4384 and C. jejuni NCTC 11168 were found to have common genes as well genes unique to each strain (24Gilbert M. Brisson J.-R. Karwaski M.-F. Michniewicz J.

However, mechanisms other than differences in gene complement are involved in generating a variety of LOS outer cores. In the strain C. jejuni OH4382, the gene involved in the transfer of the GalNAc residue of the LOS outer core was shown to be inactive (a missing A nucleotide causes a premature translation stop). This results in the expression of a truncated LOS outer core when compared with strain OH4384 (13Aspinall G.O. McDonald A.G. Pang H. Kurjanczyk L.A. Penner J.L.

We reported previously that the cst-II gene occurs as a mono-functional α-2,3-sialyltransferase in C. jejuni ATCC 43446 (O:19 serostrain) and as a bi-functional α-2,3-/α-2,8-sialyltransferase in C. jejuni OH4384 that results in the expression of either a GD1a or GT1a mimic, respectively (24Gilbert M. Brisson J.-R. Karwaski M.-F. Michniewicz J. Cunningham A.-M. Wu Y. Young N.M. Wakachuk W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3896-3906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In this work we describe the mechanisms used by C. jejuni to generate various sialylated outer core structures. In addition to reporting other examples of on/off expression of genes due to variable homopolymeric tracts, we use enzymatic assays to show that amino acid substitutions are responsible for the expression of glycosyltransferases with different substrate specificities, a “strategy” that further expands the ability of C. jejunito express various LOS outer cores. The C. jejuni strains used in this study are listed in Table I. The Penner type strains were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. C. jejuni OH4382, OH4384 and NCTC 11168 were obtained from the Laboratory Center for Disease Control (Health Canada, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada). C. jejuni strains were grown on Mueller-Hinton medium under microaerobic conditions. Escherichia coli AD202 (CGSG 7297) was used to express the different cloned glycosyltransferases and was grown using 2YT agar or broth. The recombinant E. colistrains were incubated at 25 °C for a total of 24 h, with induction with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside after 6 h forcgtA constructs and with 0.3 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside after 4.5 h for cst-II constructs. Genomic DNA isolation from theC. jejuni strains was performed using the DNeasy Tissue kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Plasmid DNA isolation, restriction enzyme digestions, purification of DNA fragments for cloning, ligations, and transformations were performed as recommended by the enzyme supplier or the manufacturer of the kit used for the particular procedure. Long PCRs (>2 kb) were performed using the ExpandTM long template PCR system as described by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). PCRs to amplify specific ORFs were performed using thePwo DNA polymerase as described by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Restriction and DNA modification enzymes were purchased from MBI Fermentas Inc. (Hanover, MD). Site-directed mutagenesis of cst-II was performed using a two stage PCR mutagenesis protocol. Two separate PCR reactions were performed to generate two overlapping gene fragments that both contained the mutation due to either the 5′ or the 3′ primers. The two PCR products were used with the cst-II 5′ and 3′ primers to amplify the full-length mutated version of cst-II. The DNA sequences of the LOS biosynthesis loci of C. jejuni NCTC 11168 (GenBankTM accession number AL139077) and OH4384 (GenBankTM accession number AF130984) were used to design primers to amplify the LOS biosynthesis loci of the other strains described in this work. The primers were designed to obtain overlapping PCR products of 2–5 kb that covered completely each of the LOS locus. The PCR products were sequenced by “primer walking,” and new primers were synthesized to amplify and sequence the regions that diverge significantly from the NCTC 11168 and OH4384 sequences. DNA sequencing was performed using an Applied Biosystems (Montreal) model 373 automated DNA sequencer and the manufacturer's cycle sequencing kit. Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). FCHASE-labeled oligosaccharides were prepared as described previously (26Wakarchuk W.W. Martin A. Jennings M.P. Moxon E.R. Richards J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19166-19173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Extracts were made by sonication, and the enzymatic reactions were performed at 37 °C for 5 min to 2 h. The β-1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase was assayed using 0.5 mm Neu5Acα-2,3-Galβ-1,4-Glc-FCHASE, 1 mm UDP-GalNAc, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7, and 10 mm MnCl2. The α-2,3-sialyltransferase was assayed using 0.5 mm Gal-β-1,4-Glc-FCHASE, 0.2 mm CMP-Neu5Ac, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 10 mm MgCl2. The α-2,8-sialyltransferase was assayed using 0.5 mm Neu5Acα-2,3-Galβ-1,4-Glc-FCHASE, 0.2 mm CMP-Neu5Ac, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 10 mm MgCl2. The CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase was assayed using CTP, Neu5Ac, Gal-β1,4-GlcNAc-FCHASE, and a purified fusion of the N. meningitidis α-2,3-sialyltransferase (MalE-NST) 2M. Gilbert, M.-F. Karwaski, S.

The reaction mix included 0.5 mm Gal-β-1,4-GlcNAc-FCHASE, 3 mm CTP, 3 mm Neu5Ac, 4 milliunits of α-2,3-sialyltransferase (MalE-NST), 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol. All the reactions were stopped by the addition of acetonitrile (25% final concentration) and were diluted with H2O to get 10–15 μm final concentration of the FCHASE-labeled compounds. The samples were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis performed using the separation and detection conditions as described previously (27Gilbert M. Watson D.C. Cunningham A.-M. Jennings M.P.

The peaks from the electropherograms were analyzed using manual peak integration with the P/ACE Station software. We have compared the LOS biosynthesis loci of 11C. jejuni strains (TableI) that include 7 previously unpublished loci and extend our previous limited comparison of 4C. jejuni strains that included 3 closely related O:19 strains (OH4382, OH4384, and ATCC 43446, the O:19 serostrain) and the genome strain NCTC 11168 (24Gilbert M.

The LOS outer core structures were published for 10 of the 11 strains included in this study (Fig.1 and Table I). The general organization of the LOS biosynthesis genes allows us to group these C. jejuni strains into three classes “A,” “B,” and “C” (see Fig. 2). The LOS biosynthesis loci of the six class A strains have 13 ORFs, whereas the LOS biosynthesis loci of the two class B strains and of the three class C strains have 14 ORFs. One gene (orf11) is found only in classes A and B, whereas three genes are unique to class C (orf14, orf15, and orf16).

Open table in a new tab The 11.5-kb DNA sequences of the LOS loci from the six class A strains can be aligned with only minor gaps, the longest being 6 bp. The overall DNA sequence identity is 91% between the six A strains. However, the level of conservation observed in pairwise alignments varies considerably. As reported previously (24Gilbert M. Brisson J.-R. Karwaski M.-F. Michniewicz J. Cunningham A.-M. Wu Y. Young N.M. Wakachuk W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3896-3906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) the three O:19 strains (ATCC 43446, OH4382, and OH4384) are closely related. There is only one base difference (a missing A at position 71 oforf5) between the LOS locus of OH4382 and OH4384. There are 68 base differences (20 amino acid differences) between ATCC 43446 (O:19 serostrain) and OH4384. The LOS locus from C. jejuniATCC 43438 (O:10 serostrain) is primarily responsible for decreasing the overall degree of conservation among the A class strains. When the ATCC 43438 strain is excluded from the class A alignment, the overall DNA sequence identity increases to 96.5%. The highest level of divergence between the LOS locus of ATCC 43438 and the other class A strains is found between nt 4500 and 5700 (66% DNA sequence identity), a region that spans both the orf5 and orf6 which encode a β-1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase and a β-1,3-galactosyltransferase, respectively. The 12.4-kb LOS biosynthesis locus of the two class B strains (ATCC 43449, the O:23 serostrain, and ATCC 43456, the O:36 serostrain) shows 95.2% DNA sequence identity in a full-length pairwise alignment. However, the sequence identity is only 65.3% in the region from nt 4500 to 5700, whereas it is above 98% in the rest of the locus. It is noticeable that this region corresponds to the same region that was found to diverge considerably between ATCC 43438 and the other class A strains. In fact, ATCC 43438 and ATCC 43449 share 98% DNA sequence identity in the nt 4500–5700 region, whereas the other class A strains and ATCC 43456 share 99% DNA identity in that region. Class B appears to be an evolutionary intermediate between classes A and C because it has two copies of orf5, with one of them (orf5-I) more similar to orf5 from class A (96% DNA sequence identity) and the second copy (orf5-II) more similar to orf5 from class C (85% DNA sequence identity). The orf5-I in the class B is inactive because of premature translational termination after 28 codons in ATCC 43449 and after 86 codons in ATCC 43456. Transcription reinitiation of orf5-Iwould theoretically be possible, but a similar frameshift mutation was described in orf5 of OH4382 and resulted in the expression of a truncated LOS, consistent with the absence of active β-1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (24Gilbert M.

We report the novel finding that, in contrast to other MMPs expressed at the front of the advancing epithelial sheet in wounds of cornea, skin, or trachea, gelB acts to inhibit the rate of wound closure. We determined this to be due to control of cell replication, a novel capacity for MMPs not previously described. We also found that gelB delays the inflammatory response. Acceleration of these processes in gelB-deficient mice is correlated with a delay in signal transduction through Smad2, a transcription factor that inhibits cell proliferation, and in accumulation of epithelial-associated interleukin-1α, a cytokine that inhibits Smad2 signaling and promotes the inflammatory response. GelB-deficient mice also reveal defects in remodeling of extracellular matrix at the epithelial basement membrane zone, in particular, failure to effectively remove the fibrin(ogen) provisional matrix.

We conclude that gelB coordinates and effects multiple events involved in the process of epithelial regeneration. matrix metalloproteinase bromodeoxyuridine gelatinase A gelatinase B interleukin 1 photorefractive keratectomy transforming growth factor-β Epithelial tissues surface all organs of the body exposed to the external environment, acting as a protective barrier. Unlike most organ stromal tissues, epithelia can regenerate completely following injury. Epithelial regeneration involves multiple distinct processes, including the concerted migration of cells as a sheet to resurface the wound bed, mitosis to replace cell numbers, re-stratification of the sheet into a multilayered structure, and restoration of stable adhesive interaction with the underlying tissue stroma (1Woodley D.T.

These processes must be temporally coordinated with one another, and with the protective inflammatory response, which also occurs in response to injury. This is thought to involve an orderly progression and synergism of cytokines and growth factors within the wound environment (7Schultz G. Khaw P.T. Oxford K. MaCauley S. Van Setten G. Chegini N.

Skin Wound Care. 2000; 13: 6-11PubMed Google Scholar). Despite many recent advances, mechanisms for integrating and orchestrating the multiple processes involved in epithelial regeneration are still poorly understood. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)1are a family of zinc endopeptidases that act as key effectors and regulators of tissue remodeling in vertebrates (16Woessner J.F. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 1-14Crossref Google Scholar). Molecular substrates for the MMPs include all classes of extracellular matrix proteins and molecules that organize tissues such as the cadherins (17Lochter A. Galosy S. Muschler J. Freedman N. Werb Z. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1861-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 18Vu T.H. Werb Z. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2123-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). MMPs are also reactive against signaling molecules such as cytokines and growth factors, controlling their activity and bioavailability (18Vu T.H. Werb Z. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2123-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). While MMP activity is regulated at multiple levels, gene expression constitutes the major control mechanism (19Fini M.E. Cook J.R. Mohan R. Brinckerhoff C.E. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 299-356Crossref Google Scholar). Induced expression of an array of MMPs occurs as part of the tissue response to injury (20Fini M.E. Cook J.R. Mohan R. Arch. Dermatol.

Inappropriate expression or overexpression of MMPs contributes to the pathophysiology of diverse disorders occurring across all organ systems (22Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases.

Wound Repair Regen. 1999; 7: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Gelatinase B (gelB; MMP-9) is an MMP that catalyzes cleavage of denatured collagens of all types and native basement membrane components (26Vu T.H. Werb Z. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 163-176PubMed Google Scholar). GelB is not expressed in the normal cornea, skin, or trachea; however, expression is induced (along with a number of other MMPs) in cells at the front of the migrating epithelial sheet as it begins to resurface the wound bed following injury (22Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, San Diego1998Google Scholar,31Matsubara M. Zieske J.D. Fini M.E. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Inflammatory cells infiltrating the wound bed also produce gelB (34Leppert D. Waubant E. Galardy R. Bunnett N.W. Hauser S.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4379-4389PubMed Google Scholar, 35Okada S. Kita H. George T.J. Gleich G.J. Leiferman K.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). GelB expression in the epithelium spreads progressively distal to the migrating front once wound resurfacing is complete and persists for several weeks thereafter (32Matsubara M. Girard M.T. Kublin C.L. Cintron C. Fini M.E. Dev. Biol. 1991; 147: 425-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 36Azar D.T. Pluznik D. Jain S. Khoury J.M. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1998; 116: 1206-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The timing correlates with the period during which provisional wound matrix is resorbed and new structures for epithelial/stromal adhesion are assembled in the epithelial basement membrane zone (37Gipson I.K. Spurr-Michaud S.J. Tisdale A.S. Dev. Biol. 1988; 126: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Overexpression of gelB is associated with defective re-epithelialization and a reduction in adhesion complex integrity (23Fini M.E. Parks W.C. Rinehart W.B. Girard M.T. Matsubara M. Cook J.R. West-Mays J.A. Sadow P.M. Burgeson R.E. Jeffrey J.J. Raizman M.B. Krueger R.R. Zieske J.D. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 1287-1302PubMed Google Scholar, 31Matsubara M. Zieske J.D. Fini M.E. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1991; 32: 3221-3237PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that gelB plays a key role in the process of epithelial regeneration. The corneal epithelium can be considered a prototype for a stratified epithelium similar to that surfacing skin, lung, and other organs. Moreover, the cornea offers an ideal model for evaluating mechanisms of tissue repair and regeneration because the avascularity of this organ reduces the number of interacting tissues. In this study we have investigated specific roles for gelB in regeneration of the corneal epithelium, utilizing a strain of mice made genetically deficient for gelB. GelB-deficient mice (GelB−/−) were on the 129SvEv/CD-1 mixed background. A matched littermate control line (GelB+/+) was on the same background (38Vu T.H. Shipley J.M. Bergers G. Berger J.E. Helms J.A. Hanahan D. Shapiro S.D. Senior R.M. Werb Z. Cell. 1998; 93: 411-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). At intervals throughout this study, genotypes were verified by Southern blotting. Mice were used for experiments between 6 and 12 weeks of age; gelB-deficient mice were age-matched with littermate controls. Surgical procedures were performed on anesthetized mice according to approved institutional protocols. For corneal debridement surgery, the epithelium within an area demarcated by a 1.5-mm diameter trephine was removed to the basement membrane with the aid of an algebrush (Storz Ophthalmic). Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) was performed on corneas using a Summit Apex Excimer Laser (Summit, Waltham, MA) on phototherapeutic settings. Tissue was ablated to a depth of 40–44 μm within a 2.0-mm diameter spot size using 160 pulses. To create a full thickness skin wound, hair was removed with a depilitory agent. Then the back skin was pulled up to form skin-to-skin double layers and a 6-mm punch biopsy sterilely used to create two identical full thickness wounds. The wounds were covered with transparent Op-Site dressing. Eyes were enucleated between 10 and 20 h after surgery and tethered to paraffin by pinning through the extraocular muscles. The remaining epithelial defects were delineated by application of Richardson's stain to the ocular surface. Images were projected at a fixed distance and the circumference of the area stained by blue dye was traced in pencil. The area was then quantified using NIH image software by an observer unaware of the mouse genotype. To quantify healing in skin wounds, animals were anesthetized and then the outside perimeter was traced with a fine point marker onto a sterile slide directly applied to the wound site, after removing the old dressing and before applying a new one. The wound shape was traced immediately after surgery and every 2 days from the third day afterward. The image of the slide with the wound tracing was captured through a computerized video camera with Pax-it! Software (version 1.83, Imaging Systems for Science and Industry). The area of wound tracing on slide was quantified using computer image analysis software (Optimus). Eyes were enucleated immediately following surgery, tethered to paraffin beds in the individual wells of 24-well plates, and cultured in serum-free medium as described (32Matsubara M. Girard M.T. Kublin C.L. Cintron C. Fini M.E. Dev. Biol. 1991; 147: 425-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). For “rescue” experiments, purified recombinant human gelB proenzyme (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) was added to culture medium at the beginning of an experiment. In other experiments, organ cultures were treated with Ilomastat, a synthetic peptide hydroxamic acid analogue of the transition state of zinc metalloproteinases (39Grobelny D. Poncz L. Galardy R.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7152-7154Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). A peptide analogue lacking the active hydroxamic acid group was used as a control (both agents from AMS Scientific, Pleasant Hill, CA). Epithelium from the repairing areas of corneas was debrided with a surgical scalpel, placed in 200 μl of ice-cold 200 Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and pulverized with a Pellet Pestle (Kimble-Knotes, NJ). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The soluble proteins were precipitated using cold acetone and protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad reagent. Gelatin zymography was performed according to our standard methods (31Matsubara M. Zieske J.D. Fini M.E. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1991; 32: 3221-3237PubMed Google Scholar, 32Matsubara M. Girard M.T. Kublin C.L. Cintron C. Fini M.E. Dev. Biol. 1991; 147: 425-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Methacrylate cross-sections (6 μm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Relative thickness of the corneal epithelial and stromal layers in gelB-deficient mice and normal mice was compared by examining 10 sections taken through the center of each cornea from 10 different mice of each strain. Measurements were made using a micrometer viewed in the light microscope field alongside the tissue section. Significance of differences between strains was assessed using the Student's t test. Cryostat sections (6 μm) were processed for indirect immunofluorescent localization as described previously (31Matsubara M. Zieske J.D. Fini M.E. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1991; 32: 3221-3237PubMed Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used were a rat polyclonal antibody against the inflammatory cell marker, mouse Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18 or αMβ2 integrin) (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against human laminin-5 (40Rousselle P. Lunstrum G.P. Keene D.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), a sheep polyclonal antiserum raised against human fibronectin (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), and a rabbit polyclonal antibody against mouse fibrin(ogen), which binds both the fibrinogen precursor and the proteolytically cleaved fibrin (41Drew A.F. Schiman H.L. Kombrinck K.W. Bugge T.H. Degen J.L. Kaufman A.H. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 67-72PubMed Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy was performed on mouse corneas fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Whole corneas were then stained en bloc with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to identify actin filaments. Corneas were mounted epithelial side down onto 25-μm thick, 60-mm diameter mylar Petri dishes (Bachofer, Hamburg, Germany) and scanned using a confocal microscope (Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy, Leica, Deerfield, IL) equipped with a Leica Fluorovert microscope, argon/krypton laser and 568/590 excitation/detection filters. Three-dimensional data sets were collected and transferred to a Silicon Graphics work station (Personal Iris 4D-35G), and maximum intensity volume renderings were made using the ANALYZE software program (Mayo Medical Adventure Inc., Rochester, MN). Central corneal debridement (1.5-mm) wounds were made in the right eyes of the mice and allowed to heal for 16 h in vivo. Two hours before the mice were sacrificed, BrdU (Sigma) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline was injected subcutaneously in the dorsal subscapular region at 100 μg/g body weight. Mice were sacrificed and the eyes removed immediately and frozen for cryostat sectioning. Cross-sections were immunohistochemically stained with a monoclonal antibody against BrdU (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). The primary antibody was detected by avidin-biotin complex immunoperoxidase technique using an ABC Elite Kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) following the manufacturer's directions. Color was developed with 3′,3′-diaminobenzidine peroxidase substrate (Sigma). Eyes were frozen immediately after the mice were sacrificed by immersion in liquid nitrogen to prevent Smad activation during sample preparations. The entire corneal epithelium was then removed by gentle scraping with a scalpel. The pooled tissues from 10 eyes were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, 1 mm Na3 VO4, 10 mm NaF. Equal amounts of protein (10 μg/sample) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with specific primary antibody reagents. Immunodetection of primary antibody binding was accomplished by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody followed by chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposure to x-ray film. Rabbit anti-Smad3 and anti-phospho-Smad2 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), and monoclonal anti-Smad2 (clone 18) was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA). A goat polyclonal antibody raised against recombinant mouse IL-1α (catalog number AF-400-NA) was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Information in the company catalogue states that this antibody was selected for its ability to neutralize the biological activity of recombinant mouse IL-1α. Based on direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot results, this antibody showed less than 10% cross-reactivity with recombinant human IL-1α. Additionally, indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays this antibody showed no cross-reactivity with other cytokines tested. Mice homozygous for a targeted mutation that inactivates the gene for gelB show delayed growth of long bones due to impaired vascularization of the growth plate, but ultimately they attain normal adulthood (38Vu T.H. Shipley J.M. Bergers G. Berger J.E. Helms J.A. Hanahan D. Shapiro S.D. Senior R.M. Werb Z. Cell. 1998; 93: 411-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). Routine gross examination of adult eyes revealed no obvious anatomical differences between gelB-deficient homozygotes and their normal counterparts. Eyes of the gelB-deficient mice were of normal size and lenses were clear. Corneas were clear and avascular, with no evidence of malformation or inflammation by gross or histological analysis (data not shown). No statistically significant difference was observed between strains in stromal or epithelial layer thickness, or in number of epithelial layers (data not shown). These observations indicate that a deficiency of gelB does not affect the formation and maintenance of normal corneal structure. To investigate the effects of gelB deficiency on regeneration of the corneal epithelium following injury, we used an epithelial debridement model (42Gipson I.K. Kiorpes T.C. Dev. Biol. 1982; 92: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 32Matsubara M. Girard M.T. Kublin C.L. Cintron C. Fini M.E. Dev. Biol. 1991; 147: 425-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) adapted for the mouse in which the epithelium is surgically removed to the level of the basement membrane within a circular region of 1.5-mm diameter. We collected epithelial tissue from the repairing portions of normal and gelB-deficient corneas at a time when wounds were partially closed, and analyzed tissue extracts by gelatin zymography (Fig.1A). A gelatinase of a size appropriate to be the gelB proenzyme was detectable in extracts derived from littermate control mice, but was absent from extracts derived from gelB-deficient mice. In contrast, a gelatinase of the size appropriate to be the gelatinase A (gelA; MMP-2) proenzyme was detectable in extracts from both gelB-deficient mice and their normal counterparts. The intensity of the gelA band was essentially the same in both mouse lines, indicating that gelB deficiency does not result in compensatory up-regulation of this related enzyme. A time course experiment was performed over the period of wound closure, and the rate of re-epithelialization was compared between gelB-deficient mice and normal littermate controls. Fig. 1Bshows representative images of the remaining epithelial defects at a time when wounds were partially closed. No difference was observed in the quality of re-epithelialization between mouse strains. Corneas from both gelB KO mice and their normal counterparts re-epithelialized without incident, with no gross evidence of inflammation. In contrast, the rate of re-epithelialization was faster in the gelB-deficient mice. This difference was apparent as early as 10 h after surgery, and was highly significant by 20 h (Fig. 1C). All corneas from both mouse strains remained avascular throughout this experiment, indicating that cytokines or other factors contributed by the vasculature could not cause the differing re-epithelialization rates. The substrate on which the epithelium migrates could influence the rate of wound resurfacing. Therefore, we repeated the experiment described above using a PRK model in which a laser is used to ablate superficial corneal tissue removing the epithelium, the basement membrane, and a portion of the anterior stroma. To resurface this type of wound, the epithelial sheet migrates across stromal collagen fibrils. Again, no difference in the quality of healing was observed between gelB-deficient mice and their normal counterparts; however, re-epithelialization was still significantly faster in the gelB-deficient mice (Fig. 1D). To learn whether faster wound closure generalizes to other organs, we examined the rate of healing of an excisional wound in the skin (Fig.1E). As in cornea, wound closure in skin was found to occur significantly more rapidly in gelB-deficient mice than in their normal control counterparts. These results indicate that the findings in cornea are not tissue-specific. To differentiate between systemic and local factors in the gelB-deficient phenotype, we repeated the surgical debridement experiment, but eyes were enucleated following surgery and placed in organ culture for healing. The difference in the re-epithelialization rate between normal and gelB-deficient mice was less than when re-epithelialization occurred in the mouse in situ, but was still significant at 15 h (p < 0.002; n = 10; data not shown) and 20 h after surgery (Fig.2A). These data indicate that at least some of the effects of gelB deficiency are attributable to local factors. To provide evidence that the corneal re-epithelialization phenotype in the gelB-deficient mice is due to a direct loss-of-function, we attempted a rescue experiment by adding purified gelB protein to the corneas of gelB-deficient mice undergoing re-epithelialization in organ culture. GelB was added in the latent proenzyme form, because this is the form that predominates in re-epithelializing debridement wounds (see Fig. 1A). Our expectation was that the exogenously added proenzyme would be converted to an active form through the same extracellular mechanisms utilized for activation of endogenously produced enzyme during wound repair. At 1 μg/ml of exogenously added gelB proenzyme, the retardation of re-epithelialization rate was significant (Fig. 2B). In other words, exogenous addition of gelB returned the rate of wound re-epithelialization in the gelB-deficient mouse back toward normal, consistent with rescue of the deficiency phenotype. These data support the conclusion that the gelB-deficient re-epithelialization phenotype results from a direct loss-of-function due to inactivation of the gene for gelB. Inhibition of broad-spectrum or specific MMP activity has been reported to inhibit epithelial cell migration in culture (21Pilcher B.K. Dumin J.A. Sudbeck B.D. Krane S.M. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J.

Dano K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4645-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). To learn whether this is also true in our corneal model, we examined the effects of Ilomastat, a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor (39Grobelny D. Poncz L. Galardy R.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7152-7154Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 45Fini M.E. Cui T.Y. Mouldovan A. Grobelny D. Galardy R.E. Fisher S.J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1991; 32: 2997-3001PubMed Google Scholar) on re-epithelialization in normal mice. While the Ki for gelatinases determined in test tube assay is 0.4 nm, inhibition of MMPs in tissues requires much higher concentrations; we used the dose range determined to be effective by Chin and Werb (46Chin J.R. Werb Z. Development. 1997; 124: 1519-1530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in their studies with a mandibular organ culture system. At an ilomastat dose of 1 μm, the rate of corneal re-epithelialization was significantly retarded in comparison to controls treated with the same dose of an inactive analogue lacking the hydroxamic acid group (Fig. 2C). These data are consistent with a requirement for MMP activity in corneal re-epithelialization, and suggest that gelB must be playing a different role than other MMPs in this process. Tangential optical sectioning by confocal microscopy on corneal whole mounts stained with rhodamine-phalloidin revealed no differences between gelB-deficient mice and their normal counterparts in the overall appearance, or in organization of the actin filaments, in cells at the advancing epithelial front (Fig.3, Confocal, arrows). However, in the course of these experiments we observed the presence of inflammatory cells in the wound bed of gelB-deficient mice (Fig. 3, Confocal, −/−, arrowhead), that were not seen in their normal counterparts (Fig. 3, Confocal, +/+, arrowhead). Absence of gelB does not appear to alter the capacity of inflammatory cells to respond to a chemotactic stimulus, extravasate from blood vessels, or accumulate in tissues (47Betsuyaku T. Shipley J.M.

We investigated the role of the mitogen-activated protein kinase subtypes, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK)-1/2, and p38 kinase in NO-induced apoptosis of rabbit articular chondrocytes and their involvement in dedifferentiation. Generation of NO with sodium nitroprusside (SNP) caused dedifferentiation, as indicated by the inhibition of type II collagen expression and proteoglycan synthesis. NO additionally caused apoptosis, accompanied by p53 accumulation and caspase-3 activation. SNP treatment stimulated activation of ERK-1/2 and p38 kinase. Inhibition of ERK-1/2 with PD98059 rescued SNP-induced dedifferentiation but enhanced apoptosis up to 2-fold, whereas inhibition of p38 kinase with SB203580 enhanced dedifferentiation, with significant blockage of apoptosis. The stimulation of apoptosis by ERK inhibition was accompanied by increased p53 accumulation and caspase-3 activity, whereas the inhibitory effect of p38 kinase blockade was associated with reduced p53 accumulation and caspase-3 activity. Our results indicate that NO-induced p38 kinase functions as an induction signal for apoptosis and in the maintenance of chondrocyte phenotype, whereas ERK activity causes dedifferentiation and operates as an anti-apoptotic signal. NO generation is less proapoptotic in chondrocytes that are dedifferentiated by serial monolayer culture or phorbol ester treatment. NO-induced p38 kinase activity is low in dedifferentiated cells compared with that in differentiated chondrocytes, with lower levels of p53 accumulation and caspase-3 activity. Our findings collectively suggest that ERK-1/2 and p38 kinase oppositely regulate NO-induced apoptosis of chondrocytes, in association with p53 accumulation, caspase-3 activation, and differentiation status."

Down-regulation of c-Myc is a critical event for growth inhibition induced by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and is frequently impaired in cancer cells. We determined a Smad-responsive element in the c-mycpromoter. This element is a complex of the TGF-β1 inhibitory element (TIE) originally identified in the transin/stromelysin promoter and an E2F site responsible for transcriptional activation of the c-myc promoter. Smad3 and E2F-4 directly bound to the element (TIE/E2F), and substitution of two nucleotides in TIE/E2F impaired binding of both Smad3 and E2F-4 as well as serum-induced activation and TGF-β-induced suppression of the c-mycpromoter activity. Smads bound TIE/E2F within 1 h after stimulation with TGF-β, before the suppression of c-myc transcription, whereas binding of p130 to TIE/E2F became augmented later than 12 h. TGF-β signaling did not compete with E2F-4 for binding to TIE/E2F, but reduced p300 co-immunoprecipitating with E2F-4. Therefore, TGF-β signaling may suppress c-myc promoter activity by dissociating p300 from E2F-4. c-Myc is one of the most potent regulators of cell cycle progression in higher eukaryotes.

It consists of more than 40 family members including TGF-βs, activins, and bone morphogenetic proteins. TGF-β transduces signals via heteromeric complex formation of cognate type II and type I serine/threonine kinase receptors. TGF-β type II receptor kinase phosphorylates serine and threonine residues in the GS domain of TGF-β type I receptor, which results in activation of the type I receptor kinase. Then, activated type I receptor transduces signals into cytoplasm through phosphorylation of receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smad). Smad2 and Smad3 are the R-Smads activated by the TGF-β type I receptor. Activated R-Smads bind to Smad4, which is a common partner Smad and translocate into the nucleus, and this complex serves as a transcriptional regulator (1Massagué J. Wotton D.

However, such alterations cannot account for many cancers in which TGF-β responsiveness is lost. Identification of more components essential for the TGF-β signaling pathway leading to growth arrest might therefore be required to identify genetic alterations responsible for TGF-β resistance in cancer cells. c-myc was discovered as the cellular homologue of the retroviral v-myc oncogene, and the c-mycproto-oncogene was subsequently found to be activated in various animal and human tumors. Amplification of the c-myc gene has been described in ∼15% of all human tumors (13Henriksson M. Luscher B. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 68: 109-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

However, dephosphorylation of Rb family proteins requires more than several hours, whereas TGF-β rapidly down-regulates levels of c-myc mRNA beginning within 1 h of its administration (28Zentella A. Weis F.M. Ralph D.A. Laiho M. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4952-4958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Myc down-regulation was shown to be required for activation of p15ink4b (29Warner B.J. Blain S.W. Seoane J. Massagué J. Mol. Cell.

There thus must be a pathway through which TGF-β down-regulates c-myc early after TGF-β-stimulation other than that mediated by Rb family proteins. To identify this pathway, we analyzed TGF-β-responsive elements in the human c-myc promoter and found that Smad proteins directly bound to an element in the c-myc promoter and suppressed c-myc promoter activity. HaCaT cells and the R mutant of Mv1Lu cells (clone 4-2) were provided by N. E. Fusenig (DKFZ, Heidelberg) and J. Massagué (Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York), respectively. Mv1Lu cells and COS-7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. These cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 μg/ml gentamicin. Subclones of HaCaT cells were maintained in MCDB153 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 0.1 mm calcium chloride, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 10 μg/ml gentamicin, and 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. These subclones were used for experiments including DNA transfection. HaCaT cells stably expressing FLAG-Smad3D407E were previously described (31Goto D. Yagi K. Inoue H. Iwamoto I. Kawabata M.

Deletion constructs (−367/+16, −142/+16, −40/+16) of the c-myc promoter were amplified using PCR and subcloned intoBglII/HindIII sites of pGL3-basic (Promega). Mutants (m-GTCT, ΔGC, m-CAGA, m-TIE, and m-E2F) of the c-myc promoter (−367/+16) were amplified by PCR using mutant primers. Upper strand sequences of the mutant primers are as follows: m-GTCT, TGCGAGGaTtTGGACGG; ΔGC, TGTGCTGCTCGCGG:GGGCCCCGGCCGT; m-CAGA, GGCTTCTtAaAGGCTTGG; m-TIE, CAGAGGCcTaGCGGGAA; m-E2F, CTTGGCGttAAAAAGAACG.

Total cellular RNA was extracted using Isogen (Nippongene, Tokyo, Japan) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Twenty-μg aliquots were electrophoresed on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred to nylon membrane (Biodyne A; Pall BioSupport Co.). The membranes were hybridized at 42 °C overnight with random primed DNA probes labeled with [α-32P]dCTP in a hybridization buffer containing 5× SSC, 25% formamide, 1% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 0.2 mg/ml denatured salmon testis DNA. The membranes were washed to a final stringency of 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C, and analyzed using a Fuji BAS 2500 Bio-Image Analyzer (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan) and autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as previously described (34Yagi K. Goto D. Hamamoto T. Takenoshita S. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol.

Cells were solubilized in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1.5% aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After clearing with centrifugation, total cell lysates or immunoprecipitates obtained using anti-HA (12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or anti-p300 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (ProBlott; Applied Biosystems) and subjected to immunoblotting. Anti-Myc (9E10; Calbiochem), anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma), anti-Smad2/3 (clone 18; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), anti-E2F-1 (KH95; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-E2F-4 (C-20, Santa Cruz), anti-p130 (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p107 (SD9; BD PharMingen), anti-Rb (G3–245; BD PharMingen), anti-HA (3F10; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and anti-p300 (Upstate Biotechnology) antibodies were used as first antibodies for immunoblotting. Reacted antibodies were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For reblotting, the membranes were stripped following the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well and cultured for 24 h in the growth medium for each cell line. Then the culture fluids were changed to growth medium containing various concentrations of human TGF-β. After 16–20 h of incubation, 0.25 μCi/well of [3H]thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 1 h. The cells were fixed in 5% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid for 1 h and solubilized in 1 m NaOH. After neutralization with 1 m HCl,3H radioactivity was measured with a Beckman LS 6500 liquid scintillation counter. Cells were transfected using FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Stable HaCaT clones transfected with pcDNA3-c-myc were selected and maintained in the presence of 300 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Luciferase activity in the cell lysates was determined by a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) using a luminometer (AutoLumat LB953; EG & G Berthold). Luciferase activities were normalized to either sea pansy luciferase activity of cotransfected pRL-TK (Promega) or β-galactosidase activity of cotransfected pcDNA3.1/Hygro/lacZ (Invitrogen). EMSA was performed as described previously (34Yagi K. Goto D. Hamamoto T. Takenoshita S. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol.

Protein-DNA complexes were then resolved in 5% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA electrophoresis buffer. Specificity of binding was demonstrated by a competition assay using 2× TRE or 3× TIE/E2F oligonucleotides as a cold probe; the upper strand sequence of 2× TRE was as follows: GATATGAGTC AGACACCTCT GGCTTTCTGG AAGGGATGAG TCAGACACCT CTGGCTTTCT GGAAGGGAGC TTG. For supershift analysis, anti-Smad2/3 (clone 18; Transduction Laboratories), anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma), or anti-E2F-4 (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the whole cell extracts or GST-fused proteins. GST-Smad3ΔMH2 was preincubated for 10 min on ice in 50 μl of 20 mmHEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 20% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), followed by a 30-min incubation in the presence of 20,000 cpm of asymmetrically 32P-labeled DNA probe. After the addition of 50 μl of 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, each reaction was treated with 2.5 or 5.0 μg/ml of DNase I (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) for 5 min on ice and then stopped by adding 100 μl of stop solution (1% SDS, 20 mm EDTA, 250 μg/ml yeast tRNA). The DNA was then precipitated and subjected to electrophoresis. Cell lysates prepared in 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.5% aprotinin, 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) were precleared with streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma) and then incubated with 200 ng of biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotides in the presence of 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) at 4 °C for 1 h. DNA-bound proteins were mixed with streptavidin-agarose (Sigma) for 1 h with end-over-end rotation, washed extensively with cell lysis buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The sequences of the upper strands of oligonucleotides were three repeats of the following sequences: TIE/E2F, CAGAGGCTTGGCGGGAAAAA; m-TIE/E2F, CAGAGGCcTaGCGGGAAAAA; m-CAGA, tAaAGGCTTGGCGGGAAAAA; TIE/m-E2F, CAGAGGCTTGGCGttAAAAA. Levels ofc-myc mRNA in exponentially growing HaCaT cells were suppressed rapidly after TGF-β-stimulation. c-myc mRNA began to decrease within 1 h and reached less than 30% of the control level within 6 h. The decrease was not affected by the presence of cycloheximide, indicating that this response did not require new protein synthesis (Fig.1A). To elucidate whether the c-myc is suppressed through the Smad pathway, we used HaCaT cells stably expressing a dominant negative mutant of Smad3 (31Goto D. Yagi K. Inoue H. Iwamoto I. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Kato M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, Smad3D407E blocked down-regulation of c-Myc in HaCaT cells both in mRNA and protein levels, suggesting that c-myc is a downstream target of the Smad pathway. In addition to dysregulation of c-myc, these cell lines lost growth-inhibitory response to TGF-β as previously reported (31Goto D. Yagi K. Inoue H. Iwamoto I. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Kato M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we established HaCaT cells stably expressing exogenous c-myc. Levels of c-Myc in these transfectants were not suppressed by TGF-β (Fig.2A). Growth of these transfectants was not affected by TGF-β (Fig. 2B), as previously shown for Balb/MK (18Alexandrow M.G.

Within the −2329/+510 human c-myc promoter, the proximal 150 bp (−142/+16) was sufficient for serum-induced activation and TGF-β-dependent suppression of c-myc promoter activity. The −367/+16 promoter stronger serum-induced activation and repression by TGF-β much stronger than the −2329/+510 reporter, suggesting the presence of negative regulatory element(s) in −2329/−367 or +16/+510. We further examined whether Smad3 directly bound the c-myc promoter. As shown in Fig. 3B, purified GST-Smad3ΔMH2 (Smad3 lacking the MH2 domain) (35Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar) directly bound the c-myc promoter including −142/+16. The shift band was diminished by the presence of an excess amount of a cold probe. Smad binding elements in this DNA fragment were then identified by DNase I footprinting analyses. There were three Smad3 binding elements in this region: a GTCT element upstream of the P1 promoter, a GC-rich element, and TIE overlapping with the E2F element (Fig. 3C,a, b, and c, respectively). We next mutated or deleted each Smad3-binding element in the −367/+16 c-myc promoter as shown in Fig.4A. Loss of Smad binding to these mutated elements was confirmed by DNase I footprinting analyses (data not shown). Mutations in the GTCT element and deletion of the GC-rich element affected neither control promoter activity nor TGF-β-responsiveness in growing Mv1Lu cells. Concerning the TIE/E2F element, we created a TIE mutant (m-TIE) that did not change the original E2F element (36Hiebert S.W. Lipp M. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3594-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and a mutant in the E2F element (m-E2F) that kept the intact TIE sequence (37Roussel M.F. Davis J.N. Cleveland J.L. Ghysdael J. Hiebert S.W. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 405-415PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). Both of these mutants considerably reduced serum-induced activation of the c-myc promoter and completely abrogated TGF-β-dependent repression (Fig. 4, B andC). TIE/E2F was indispensable for TGF-β-induced suppression of the c-myc promoter activity, whereas serum-responsive elements should exist besides TIE/E2F because m-TIE still responded to serum (Fig. 4C). We next constructed a reporter consisting of three tandem repeats of the TIE/E2F (3× TIE/E2F) connected to the core P2 promoter (−40/+16) of c-myc. Serum stimulation clearly enhanced transcriptional activity from the element, and this enhancement was totally blocked by TGF-β. These responses were completely lost with a TIE mutation (Fig.4C). Therefore, the TIE/E2F element is involved in both positive and negative regulation of c-myc promoter activity. To examine whether Smad3 bound TIE/E2F in a TGF-β-dependent manner, COS-7 cells were transfected with FLAG-Smad3 in the absence or presence of constitutively active form of TGF-β type I receptor. Total cellular lysates were subjected to DNAP analyses using a biotinylated TIE/E2F oligonucleotide as a probe. Smad3 but not a dominant-negative mutant of Smad3 bound TIE/E2F oligonucleotides in a TGF-β signaling-dependent manner (Fig.5A). This binding was specific to the sequence, since two-nucleotide substitution in the TIE element (m-TIE/E2F) totally abrogated Smad binding to the DNA. E2F-1 and E2F-4 were also highly expressed in COS-7 cells upon transient DNA transfection. In this condition, E2F-4, but not E2F-1, bound TIE/E2F (Fig. 5B). Binding of endogenous Smad proteins and E2F in HaCaT cells was further examined. Both of the TGF-β receptor-regulated Smads, Smad2 and Smad3, bound the TIE/E2F element at 1 h after TGF-β stimulation (Fig. 5C). Since Smad2 does not bind DNA directly, it may bind through Smad3 or Smad4. Mutations either in the TIE element or in the E2F element impaired Smad binding to this DNA fragment (Fig.5C), while a CAGA mutation did not affect the binding, corresponding to the results of functional assay shown in Fig. 4. Endogenous E2F-4 bound TIE/E2F regardless of the presence of TGF-β signaling. In addition, the E2F-4 binding and the Smad binding were impaired by either the TIE mutation or the E2F mutation (Fig.5C). Since TGF-β-regulated Smads and E2F-4 bound the same TIE/E2F element, we further examined whether binding of these two was mutually exclusive. However, binding of Smad did not affect E2F-4 binding to TIE/E2F, as shown in Fig. 5C (see also Fig.6A). TGF-β signaling thus is not likely to repress c-myc promoter activity by competing with E2F-4 for DNA binding. Since E2F mutation as well as TIE mutation abrogated Smad binding to TIE/E2F, we confirmed whether GST-Smad3ΔMH2 directly bound TIE/E2F in EMSA. GST-Smad3ΔMH2 directly bound TIE/E2F in the absence of E2F-4 in a sequence-specific manner (Fig. 5D). Complexes of FLAG-Smad3 and TIE/E2F in COS-7 cells were also analyzed by EMSA. E2F-4 made detectable complexes with TIE/E2F only in the presence of DP-1. Anti-E2F-4 supershifted complexes of E2F-4 and TIE/E2F. In contrast, shift bands containing FLAG-Smad3 were not affected so much by the presence of anti-E2F-4 both in the absence and in the presence of anti-FLAG antibody. These results suggest that Smad3 and E2F-4 independently bind TIE/E2F and that only a part of TIE/E2F binds both Smad3 and E2F-4 (Fig. 5E). We next examined the time course of binding of E2F-4, Smads, and Rb family proteins to TIE/E2F after administration of TGF-β (Fig. 6A). HaCaT cells were stimulated with TGF-β for the indicated times, and total cell lysates were subjected to DNAP analyses using 3× TIE/E2F as a probe. Binding of E2F-4 and pRb was not affected by TGF-β. Smad2/3 was induced to bind TIE/E2F within 2 h and kept binding up to 24 h (Fig. 6A). Binding of p130 became detectable at 6 h and clearly enhanced after 12 h. Binding of p107 decreased after 6 h, inversely proportional to p130 (Fig. 6A). We tried to detect endogenous p300 in the precipitates after DNAP with 3× TIE/E2F, but it was under detectable levels. Therefore, the effect of TGF-β signaling on the complex formation between E2F-4 and p300 was analyzed using overexpressed proteins in COS-7 cells. Fig. 6B clearly shows that TGF-β blocked coprecipitation of p300 with E2F-4. Complexes of E2F-4 and p300 decreased inverse proportionally with the increase of p300-bound Smad3 in the presence of TGF-β signaling (Fig.6C). The effects of TGF-β on the cooperation between E2F-4 and p300 were analyzed also by luciferase reporter assay. E2F-4 increased transcriptional activity via TIE/E2F elements, and p300 cooperatively enhanced the promoter activity. This cooperative effect of p300 with E2F-4 was again blocked by TGF-β signaling (Fig.6C). c-Myc is an essential regulator of cell cycle progression that is required for activation of cyclin-dependent kinase complexes (19Claassen G.F.

Reelin is also expressed in the adult brain, notably in the cerebral cortex, where it might play a role in synaptic plasticity. The mechanism of action of reelin at the molecular level has been the subject of several hypotheses. Here we show that reelin is a serine protease and that proteolytic activity is relevant to its function, since (i) Reelin expression in HEK 293T cells impairs their ability to adhere to fibronectin-coated surfaces, and adhesion to fibronectin is restored by micromolar concentrations of diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate, a serine hydrolase inhibitor; (ii) purified Reelin binds FP-Peg-biotin, a trap probe which irreversibly binds to serine residues located in active catalytic sites of serine hydrolases; (iii) purified Reelin rapidly degrades fibronectin and laminin, while collagen IV is degraded at a much slower rate; fibronectin degradation is inhibited by inhibitors of serine proteases, and by monoclonal antibody CR-50, an antibody known to block the function of Reelin bothin vitro and in vivo. The proteolytic activity of Reelin on adhesion molecules of the extracellular matrix and/or receptors on neurons may explain how Reelin regulates neuronal migration and synaptic plasticity.

Green E.D. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) is an extracellular matrix protein that plays a pivotal role in neuronal migration during development of laminar structures of the mammalian brain including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and several brainstem nuclei, as shown by spontaneous Reelin null mutations (i.e. thereeler mouse) (3Goffinet A.M. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 1984; 7: 261-296Crossref Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 4Alcantara S. Ruiz M. D'Arcangelo G. Ezan F. de Lecea L. Curran T. Stelo C. Soriano E. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7779-7799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the developing cerebral cortex, Reelin is secreted by Cajal-Retzius cells, located in the marginal zone. Reelin must be secreted into the extracellular matrix to exert its biological effect (5D'Arcangelo G. Nakajima K. Miyata T. Ogawa M. Mikoshiba K. Curran T. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 23-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the reeler mouse, migrating neurons fail to pass through earlier-generated neurons, possibly because they are unable to penetrate the subplate, or because they maintain extensive contacts with the radial glial fibers (6Pinto-Lord M.C. Evrard P. Caviness V.S. Brain Res. 1982; 256: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Several hypotheses have been suggested regarding the function of Reelin: (i) Reelin may act as an attractant molecule for migrating neurons; (ii) it may act as a repulsive molecule; or (iii) Reelin may interrupt the association between migrating neurons and radial glia (7Hoffarth R.M.

Furthermore, Reelin has been recently shown to be expressed in several adult neuronal cells, including glutamatergic cerebellar granule neurons and specific GABAergic interneurons of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (10Pesold C.

The cellular function of Reelin in the adult organism is unknown. Evidence is accumulating for involvement of Reelin in human diseases such as autosomal recessive lissencephaly (13Hong S.E.

Nature. 1995; 374: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar) encompasses 3461 amino acids and possesses a signal peptide followed by a domain with 28% sequence identity with F-spondin (as assessed by Ψ-Blast software),a protein secreted by floor plate cells and promoting cell adhesion and neurite growth (16Klar A. Baldassare M. Jessell T.M. Cell. 1992; 69: 95-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). This region is followed by a unique region with no sequence homology, and then by eight internal repeats of 350–390 amino acids, each repeat containing two related subdomains flanking a cystein-rich sequence similar to the epidermal growth factor-like motif. The carboxyl terminus region contains many positively charged amino acids required for secretion (5D'Arcangelo G. Nakajima K. Miyata T. Ogawa M. Mikoshiba K. Curran T. J.

Recent findings suggest that the Reelin signal transduction involves binding to the very low density lipoprotein receptor and to apoE receptor 2 followed by intracellular activation of the adapter protein disabled-1 (17Hiesberger T.

We have analyzed the primary amino acid sequence of human Reelin, and found several hints that Reelin might be a serine protease, since: (i) Reelin contains the sequence GKSDG (amino acids 1280–1284 of human Reelin) (2De Silva U. D'Arcangelo G. Braden V.V. Chen J. Miao G.G. Curran T. Green E.D. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), corresponding to the serine hydrolase consensus sequence GXSXG; this sequence is 100% conserved among mouse, chicken, and human Reelin; (ii) Reelin shows significant structural similarities with serine hydrolases, such as the extracellular serine protease precursor (EC 3.4.21) of Serratia marcescens, and the probable ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolases FAM and FAF-Y (EC 3.1.2.15); (iii) Reelin contains eight epidermal growth factor-like repeats; epidermal growth factor-like repeats are observed in serine proteases, for example, coagulation factors VII, IX, and X, and protein C, Z (21Kalafatis M.

In this study we present converging evidence that purified Reelin acts as a serine protease, and that this enzymatic activity may be relevant for its cellular function. Cell culture media, antibiotics, and media supplements were purchased from Invitrogen (Gaithersburg, MD). All other chemicals were from Sigma, unless otherwise specified. All sequence analyses are based on human Reelin (accession number: NP005036) (2De Silva U. D'Arcangelo G. Braden V.V. Chen J. Miao G.G. Curran T. Green E.D. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Homologies were evaluated by using Ψ-Blast 2 sequences software (www.ncbi.nih.gov/blast). Also, PropSearch software (EMBL, Heidelberg) was used to find homologies with other serine hydrolases. PattinProt software (PBIL, NPSA, Lyon) was used to identify putative consensus sequences for serine proteases. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells (ATCC, Q401) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin (100 international units/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively), and 10 mm l-glutamine. All cells were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 97% relative humidity. Passaging was routinely performed with trypsin-EDTA. Cells were stably transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA pCrl (5D'Arcangelo G. Nakajima K. Miyata T. Ogawa M. Mikoshiba K. Curran T. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 23-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which contains the entire mouse Reelin open reading frame (accession number NP_035391), or with 2 μg of pCDNA3 empty vector in 10 μl of LipofectAMINE in 4 ml of Opti-MEM serum-free medium, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were transfected in 60-mm plates at a density of 5 × 105/dish and transferred to selection medium (0.6 mg/ml G418) 48 h after transfection. For Reelin purification, a stable cell line (CER) was generated by stable transfection of 293-EBNA cells (Invitrogen) with pCER followed by selection in medium containing 0.25 mg/ml G418 and 0.4 mg/ml hygromycin B. The pCER episomal plasmid contains a reelin insert identical to that of pCrl, cloned into the pCEP4 vector (Invitrogen). Cultures were harvested for RNA preparation (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63184) Google Scholar). Total RNA (3 μg) was incubated in reaction buffer containing 5 μm random hexamer (Amersham Bioscience, Inc.), Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, reaction buffer, and RNase inhibitor, according to the manufacturer's specifications (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed for 1 h at 37 °C, and stopped by incubating the samples for 10 min at 95 °C. Expression of Reelin was checked by PCR amplification with specific primers: forward 5′-GGAAAGTCAGATGGAGAC-3′, reverse 5′-CATCTAAGCCAAACG-3′ corresponding to nucleotides 4123–4498 of mouse Reelin mRNA (Ref. (1D'Arcangelo G. Miao G.G. Chen S. Soares H.D. Morgan J.I. Curran T. Nature. 1995; 374: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar), accession number U24703). PCR amplification was carried out in a total volume of 50 μl, with 10 μl of reverse transcription reaction and 1.25 units of Taq polymerase (M-Medical Genenco-Life Science). Amplification was performed for 35 cycles (1 min denaturing at 94 °C, 1 min annealing at 58 °C, and 1 min extension at 72 °C) in a thermal cycler (Oracle BioSystems, Delphi 1500). The 376-bp amplified product was analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized under UV illumination after staining with ethidium bromide. Reelin secretion into supernatants was analyzed by plating 1 × 106 cells onto 90-mm dishes. After 24 h conditioned media were removed, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added. Forty-eight hours later, the supernatants were collected, cleared by a brief centrifugation (10 min, 1000 rpm) at 4 °C, concentrated by Microcon YM-100 (Millipore Corp. Bedford, MA) and stored at −80 °C for analysis by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Reelin secretion into the cell culture medium was assessed by Western blots using mAb 142, an antibody that recognizes the NH2-terminal sequence of Reelin (27de Bergeyck V. Naerhuyzen B. Goffinet A.M. Lambert de Rouvroit C. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1998; 82: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Cell adhesion assay was performed according to published protocols (28Abraham D.G. Nutt E.M. Bednar R.A. Bednar B. Gould R.J. Duong Le T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Ninety-six-well plates were coated overnight with fibronectin (2.5 μg/ml) in carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.7. Cells were harvested, washed three times with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and then resuspended in sterile attachment solution (calcium- and magnesium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mg/ml heat-inactivated bovine serum albumin, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2. Mock- and pCrl-transfected 293T cells (1 × 104 in 200 μl/well) were allowed to attach for 2 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Unattached cells were removed with Hanks' balanced salt solution. Attached cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, and counted manually using an inverted microscope by two different observers. The counting area was defined by a grid (12 mm2 area) placed under the wells. Attached cells were defined as cells that had spread and grown at least 1 process. All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Differences between groups were tested by one-way ANOVA followed by the LSD post-hoc test, using the SPSS statistics package (SPSS, Chicago, IL, version 9.0). Samples were mixed with 2 × sample buffer and heated at 100 °C for 2 min. Six percent resolving gel, pH 8.8, and 5% stacking gel, pH 6.8, were prepared and run in a MiniProtean II assembly (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) according to standard protocols (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filter (Schleicher & Schuell, GmbH, Dassel, Germany) by a semi-dry blotting apparatus (Hoefer Scientific, Amersham Bioscience, Inc., San Francisco, CA) for 90 min at constant current of 70 mA. After blotting, the nitrocellulose filter was blocked for 30 min in tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Reelin was revealed with 1:2000 mAb 142, overnight, followed by 1:5000 alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Promega Italia, Milan, Italy). Filters were developed with nitro blue tetrazolium-5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, containing 5 mm MgCl2. The reaction was stopped with PBS containing 2 mm EDTA. Alternatively, Reelin bands were revealed using a chemiluminescence method: filters were incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:25.000 in TBST) for 1 h. Then, after three washes, 1:500 peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (CHEMICON Int., Temecula, CA) was added for 15 min. Finally filters was washed, incubated in a freshly made solution containing 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 250 mm 3-aminophthalhydrazide, 40 mmp-coumaric acid, and 0.0005% H2O2, dried, and exposed to Kodak X-OMAT film. Filters or films were scanned with a SCANJET ADF digital scanner using Twain-32 software (Hewlett-Packard). The specificity of staining was checked by preincubating mAb 142 with protein SP, the Reelin fragment recognized by mAb 142 (27de Bergeyck V. Naerhuyzen B. Goffinet A.M. Lambert de Rouvroit C. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1998; 82: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Fluorophosphate biotin (FP-Peg-biotin) (a gift of Dr. Benjamin Cravatt) (30Liu Y. Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14694-14699Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), stored as a 100 mm stock solution in Me2SO at −20 °C, was added directly to protein samples to a final concentration of 2–4 μm. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and stopped by adding an equal volume of 2 × reducing sample buffer. As a control for the specificity of FP-Peg-biotin labeling, replica samples were incubated for 1 h with 11.4 μm diisopropylphosphofluoridate (DFP),1 a potent and specific serine-hydrolase inhibitor, before incubation with FP-Peg-biotin. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred by electroblotting to nitrocellulose membranes; the membranes were blocked in TBST with 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 25 °C or overnight at 4 °C, and then incubated for 15 min with an avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pierce) diluted 1:300 in blocking solution. The labeled bands were revealed by chemiluminescence (see above). For gel filtration chromatography purification, 50 μl of supernatant from Reelin secreting CER cells were concentrated first by osmotic dyalisis with AQUACIDE I (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). A 5-ml concentrated sample was loaded on a FPLC system ÄKTAprime and passed through a HiLoad Superdex 200 26/60 column (Amersham Bioscience, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). The run was performed at a constant flow rate of 3 ml/min and maximal pressure limit of 0.5 Pa. The eluate was collected in 1.5-ml fractions. After dot immunoblot screening and Western blot, positive fractions for Reelin were pooled and concentrated again as described above. For purification by SDS-PAGE, Reelin-containing supernatant from transfected 293T cells was concentrated as above and separated on a 5% gel. The gel was run for 3 h 30 min at 125 V to achieve a good separation in the >250 kDa range. Thereafter a thin vertical slice of gel was cut and stained with silver to reveal the 400-kDa Reelin band. A 5-mm wide horizontal slice was cut from the remaining gel, using the stained slice as a reference, and 400-kDa Reelin was electroeluted at 60 V into 25 mm Tris, 250 mm glycine, 0,1% SDS buffer. Electroelution was carried out overnight at 4 °C. Purified Reelin was, then, transferred to PBS, pH 7.2, by overnight dialysis in a Slide-A-Lyzer cassette (Pierce). Finally the protein was concentrated. The final protein concentration was estimated to be 0.2 μg/ml (Bradford Reagent, Sigma). Purified Reelin was re-electrophoresed on a SDS gel to check the purity of the protein. Reelin aliquots (10 ng) were incubated with 1 μg of fibronectin from human plasma (Sigma), or with laminin or collagen type IV from basement membrane of Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcoma (Sigma) for 0, 10, 30, or 120 min at 37 °C, in PBS, pH 7.9. The reaction was stopped by adding sample buffer and heating the samples at 100 °C for 2 min. Samples were separated in a 8% SDS gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was fixed, and silver-stained. Human Reelin contains the sequence GKSDG (amino acids 1280–1284), homologous to the consensus sequence GXSXG of serine proteases (Fig.1). Furthermore, searches of the Reelin sequence for consensus patterns (PROSITE www.ich/ucl.ac.uk/cmgs/serpro.htm) around hypothetical amino acids of the catalytic triad (Ser, His, and Asp) using PattinProt (PBIL, NPSA, Lyon), yielded several sequences sharing >60% homology with serine proteases (Fig. 1). To obtain recombinant Reelin protein, HEK 293T cells were transfected with pCrl plasmid, and Reelin mRNA expression was assessed by RT-PCR, using primers complementary to exon 27 sequences. RT-PCR of pCrl-transfected cells revealed the expected 376-bp band (Fig.2A, lane 3), while the band was absent in mock-transfected cells (lane 2). Reelin secretion into the supernatant was confirmed by Western blotting. The supernatant of pCrl-transfected cells showed a major Reelin band at approximately 400 kDa, and minor bands at 350 and 140 kDa (Fig. 2B, lane 2). The supernatant of mock-transfected cells did not show any stained bands (lane 1). HEK 293T cells endogenously express α5β1integrin which specifically mediates adhesion to fibronectin (28Abraham D.G. Nutt E.M. Bednar R.A. Bednar B. Gould R.J. Duong Le T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Titration experiments showed dose-dependent adhesion to fibronectin, with maximal adhesion occurring at 2.5–5 μg/ml fibronectin (data not shown). Reelin-transfected HEK 293T showed significantly less adhesion as compared with mock-transfected HEK 293T cells. After a 2-h incubation, 44.7 ± 6.3 (mean ± S.E.) pCrl-transfected cells were attached to the substrate, as compared with 96.3 ± 10.8 mock-transfected cells (Fig.3A, p < 0.001). Furthermore, cell morphology was markedly different: Reelin-secreting cells appeared unable to spread on fibronectin and their processes were diminished in number and length, as compared with mock-transfected cells (Fig. 3B). To assess the biological significance of the enzymatic activity of Reelin, the effect of DFP, a potent and specific inhibitor of serine hydrolases, on cell adhesion was studied. Micromolar concentrations of DFP partially restored adhesion of Reelin-expressing cells on fibronectin, without affecting mock-transfected cells (Fig. 3, A and B). The effect of DFP was dose-dependent, starting at concentrations ≥0.54 μm; maximal increase in adhesion of Reelin-expressing cells was seen at 5.4 μm DFP, while 5.4 mm was equally toxic for pCrl- and mock-transfected cells, inhibiting adhesion of >99% of the cells (Fig. 3C). FP-Peg-biotin is described to behave as a specific and irreversible probe for serine hydrolases, showing properties similar to those of common FP inhibitors, such as DFP (30Liu Y. Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14694-14699Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). To explore Reelin labeling with FP-Peg-biotin, aliquots of transfected 293T cell culture supernatants incubated with 5 μm FP-Peg-biotin were separated on standard SDS-PAGE gels, blotted, and probed with avidin peroxidase; replica samples were stained with the monoclonal antibody 142. The supernatant of Reelin-expressing cells showed distinct Reelin bands at approximately 400, 300, and 140 kDa (Fig.4A, lane 2). The 400- and 300-kDa band showed faint labeling with FP-Peg-biotin, while the 140-kDa band showed strong labeling with FP-Peg-biotin (Fig.4B, lane 1; arrows indicate corresponding bands in the two blots). Labeling of these three bands was inhibited by DFP (Fig. 4B, lane 2). The supernatant of mock-transfected cells showed a completely different labeling pattern with FP-Peg-biotin: the most evidently labeled band was a 150-kDa band, while no labeled bands were visible at 400 and 140 kDa (Fig. 4B, lane 3). Given the complex pattern of labeling with FP-Peg-biotin in supernatants, we decided to perform FP-Peg-biotin labeling on partially purified Reelin. The supernatant of the stable cell line CER, expressing high levels of Reelin, was concentrated and partially purified by gel filtration chromatography. The Reelin-positive eluate from the Superdex 200 gel filtration column was concentrated and then incubated in the absence or presence of the serine protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 4–12% gradient gel, blotted, and incubated with the monoclonal antibody E4 to reveal Reelin (Fig.5A, lanes 1 and2). The blot was then stripped and incubated with streptavidin to reveal the binding to FP-Peg-biotin (Fig.5A, lanes 3 and 4). As with the crude supernatant (Figs. 2 and 4), the immunoblot showed two major Reelin-positive bands, one higher than the 250-kDa marker, corresponding to the 400- and 300-kDa isoforms, and a smaller band at about 140 kDa (Fig. 5A, lanes 1 and2). FP-Peg-biotin binds to both major Reelin bands in the absence, but not in the presence of PMSF (Fig. 5A,lanes 3 and 4). The smaller band appeared to bind FP-Peg-biotin with a higher affinity than the higher molecular weight isoform (Fig. 5A, lane 3).Figure 5Purification of Reelin by fast protein liquid chromatography and SDS-PAGE electroelution, and labeling of purified Reelin with FP-Peg-biotin.A, the concentrated supernatant from CER cells was purified on a Sephadex-200 gel filtration column; the Reelin-positive eluate from the column was separated on a 4–12% gradient SDS-PAGE. Lanes 1 and2, immunoblot (mAb E4) of the sample incubated with FP-Peg-biotin after pretreatment without and with PMSF, respectively.Lanes 3 and 4, the blot was stripped and developed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin to reveal bound FP-Peg-biotin. The 250-kDa calibration marker shown next tolane 1 is valid for all 4 lanes. B, supernatants of mock-transfected (lane 1) and pCrl-transfected cells (lane 2) were separated with SDS-PAGE (5% gel) for 3 h 30 min and the gel was stained with silver nitrate. Thearrow next to lane 2 indicates the 400-kDa Reelin band. Lanes 3 and 4, blot corresponding tolanes 1 and 2, respectively, stained with anti-Reelin mAb 142. The arrow next to lane 4points to 400-kDa Reelin. The 250-kDa calibration marker next tolane 1 is valid for lanes 2–4 as well.Lane 5, the 400-kDa Reelin band shown in lane 2was electroeluted, electrophoresed in a second gel, blotted, and stained with mAb 142. The asterisks mark degradation products of Reelin at approximately 180 and 140 kDa. The 400-kDa band has practically disappeared.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the catalytic activity of Reelin, we first further purified the high molecular weight isoforms by SDS-PAGE and electroelution. As shown in Fig. 5B, separation of the concentrated cell culture supernatant using a 5% SDS gel resulted in a good separation of the Reelin isoforms. Silver nitrate staining indicated that only the supernatant of Reelin expressing cells contains a band at approximately 400 kDa corresponding to the Reelin isoforms of 400 (and 300) kDa (Fig. 5B, lanes 2 and4).

Characterization of the mutant protein in S. cerevisiae and Xenopus laevisoocytes revealed that the mutant had less than one-tenth the sensitivity to dilazep and dipyridamole than wild type hENT1, with no change in nitrobenzylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside (NBMPR) sensitivity or apparent uridine affinity. To determine whether the reciprocal mutation in hENT2 (Ile33 to Met) also altered sensitivity to dilazep and dipyridamole, hENT2-I33M was created by site-directed mutagenesis.

Mammalian ENTs are responsible for facilitated diffusion of nucleosides across cell membranes and have a broad tissue distribution.

Adenosine interacts with G protein-coupled cell surface receptors of endothelial and smooth muscle cells to induce vasodilation.

In a previous study, chimeric recombinant proteins were created between hENT1 and rENT1 to identify the structural domains of hENT1 that are responsible for interaction with dilazep and dipyridamole (21Sundaram M.

The inhibitor sensitivities of the chimeras suggested that TM segments 3–6 contain the major site(s) of interaction with secondary contributions from TM segments 1–2, providing the first insight into the regions of hENT1 that are important for interaction with dilazep and dipyridamole. The individual amino acid residues responsible for interaction with dilazep and dipyridamole have not yet been identified.The goal of the current study was to identify amino acid residues involved in dilazep and dipyridamole interaction by using a phenotypic complementation assay to screen a library of randomly mutated yeast expression plasmids containing the hENT1 cDNA (pYPhENT1) for functional thymidine transport-competent mutants with reduced sensitivity to dilazep. The complementation assay is based on the ability of recombinant hENT1 produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to import thymidine under conditions of dTMP starvation, thereby allowing growth, which is inhibited by the addition of dilazep to the assay medium (22Hogue D.L.

When mutant and wild type recombinant hENT1 were produced in S. cerevisiae and Xenopus laevis oocytes to quantitate dilazep and dipyridamole sensitivity, a significant decrease in sensitivity was observed for the mutated protein. The corresponding residue in hENT2 (Ile33) was therefore converted to a Met by site-directed mutagenesis, and the sensitivity of the resulting mutant to dilazep and dipyridamole was assessed. The results suggested that residue 33 in the first TM segment (Met versus Ile) contributes importantly to the ability of dilazep and dipyridamole to interact with hENT1 and hENT2.DISCUSSIONThe results of molecular cloning and functional expression studies on recombinant ENTs are consistent with the findings of studies ones- and ei-type transport processes in cultured cell lines and erythrocytes. The human and mouse es-type transporters, which correspond to the hENT1 and mENT1 proteins, are highly sensitive to dilazep and dipyridamole (3Griffith D.A. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys.

The basis for this discrepancy is uncertain but may have been due to the human protein being inserted into the yeast plasma membrane environment and/or an altered state of glycosylation, resulting in subtle changes in the conformation of the uridine-binding pocket.Previous work in which chimeric recombinant proteins were created by substituting domains between inhibitor-sensitive hENT1 and inhibitor-insensitive rENT1 suggested that the region including residues 100–231 (which includes TM segments 3–6) is the major site of interaction with dilazep and dipyridamole and that residues 1–99 (TM segments 1–2) play a secondary role (21Sundaram M.

TM segments 3–6 were also implicated in the interaction of rENT1 with NBMPR (46Sundaram M. Yao S.Y. Ng A.M. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D.

In this work, when recombinant hENT1-M33I was characterized in the same expression system (X. laevis oocytes) as was utilized in the chimera study, the relative effect of the mutation on dipyridamole sensitivity was comparable with that observed in yeast. These oocyte results confirmed participation of Met33, which is predicted to be the last residue in TM segment 1, in binding of dilazep and dipyridamole. That the M33I mutation reduced but did not abolish inhibitor sensitivity in hENT1 (compared with rENT1 and rENT2, which are totally resistant to inhibition) suggests that binding of dipyridamole and dilazep is likely to be complex, involving contributions from several amino acid residues from different regions of hENT1.The results of equilibrium binding studies in cells with thees transport process, for which ENT1 proteins are believed to be responsible, have led to the conclusion that dilazep and dipyridamole are competitive inhibitors for a single or overlapping exofacial NBMPR and permeant binding site (17Jarvis S.M.

However, results from other studies have suggested that dilazep and dipyridamole display characteristics of allosteric ligands when present at high concentrations (33Gati W.P. Paterson A.R.P. Mol.

A unifying model that has been suggested for permeant and inhibitor binding to hENT1 describes two binding sites in which permeants, NBMPR, and other inhibitors such as dilazep and dipyridamole compete for a single high affinity site, which is subject to allosteric modulation by a distinct broad specificity low affinity site that binds nucleosides, nucleobases, and inhibitors when present at very high concentrations (3Griffith D.A. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 153-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The contribution of the potential allosteric binding site of hENT1 was likely to be negligible in the experiments of the current study because the Hill coefficients indicated the presence of a single class of binding sites. These results suggested that mutation of residue 33 affected dilazep and dipyridamole binding to the competitive binding site.The current study established that residue 33 of hENT1 and hENT2 is important for dilazep and dipyridamole interaction. It is not clear whether residue 33 of hENT1 and hENT2 is directly involved in permeant or inhibitor binding or whether the effects observed when it was mutated were due to changes in the tertiary structure of these proteins. The alternatives are difficult to resolve in the absence of detailed structural data. Future studies include using different random mutagenesis and screening approaches to identify other residues that may be important for interaction with nucleoside transport inhibitors. Cellular uptake and release of nucleosides and nucleoside analog drugs is mediated by integral membrane nucleoside transporter proteins (1Vickers M.F. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Cass C.E.

These proteins are involved in salvage of extracellular nucleosides for nucleotide biosynthesis in mammalian cells, especially those that lack de novo synthesis pathways such as enterocytes and hemopoietic cells. They are critical for the cellular uptake of cytotoxic nucleoside analogs used in the treatment of human hematologic malignancies, solid tumors, and viral diseases (5Cass C.E. Georgopapadakou N.H.

Nucleoside transporters also affect the cell surface concentration of adenosine, which is a signaling molecule that binds to G protein-coupled cell surface adenosine receptors, affecting physiological processes such as coronary vasodilation, renal vasoconstriction, neuromodulation, platelet aggregation, and lipolysis (7Jennings L.L.

Mammalian nucleoside transporters are classified into two structurally and functionally distinct families: the concentrative nucleoside transporters (CNTs)1 and the equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs). CNTs mediate Na+-dependent transport against the nucleoside concentration gradient and are found primarily in specialized cells such as intestinal and renal epithelia. Three CNT isoforms, a pyrimidine-nucleoside preferring (CNT1), a purine-nucleoside and uridine preferring (CNT2), and a broadly selective (CNT3) protein, have been identified by molecular cloning from mammalian tissues (9Ritzel M.W.

Mammalian ENTs are responsible for facilitated diffusion of nucleosides across cell membranes and have a broad tissue distribution. Two ENT isoforms have been identified by molecular cloning and functional expression from mammalian tissues and mediate nucleoside transport processes that are functionally distinguished by their differential sensitivity to inhibition by NBMPR (1Vickers M.F.

NBMPR-sensitive nucleoside transport processes that bind NBMPR with high affinity, (Kd = 0.1–1 nm), have been assigned the functional designation es (equilibrativesensitive) and are mediated by ENT1 proteins. NBMPR-insensitive nucleoside transport processes are resistant to inhibition by micromolar concentrations of NBMPR, are functionally designated as ei (equilibrativeinsensitive), and are mediated by ENT2 proteins. ENTs are pharmacological targets for the coronary vasodilators dilazep, dipyridamole, and draflazine, which have been shown to inhibit transport and NBMPR binding (3Griffith D.A. Jarvis S.M. Biochim.

Adenosine interacts with G protein-coupled cell surface receptors of endothelial and smooth muscle cells to induce vasodilation. Transporter-mediated adenosine uptake is the major means by which this interaction is terminated, a mechanism that is blocked by coronary vasodilator binding to the human ENT isoforms hENT1 and hENT2 (7Jennings L.L.

Human and rat ENT1 and ENT2 proteins share a common membrane architecture, recently confirmed by hydropathy analysis and glycosylation-scanning mutagenesis (20Sundaram M. Yao S.Y.M. Ingram J.C.

In a previous study, chimeric recombinant proteins were created between hENT1 and rENT1 to identify the structural domains of hENT1 that are responsible for interaction with dilazep and dipyridamole (21Sundaram M.

The inhibitor sensitivities of the chimeras suggested that TM segments 3–6 contain the major site(s) of interaction with secondary contributions from TM segments 1–2, providing the first insight into the regions of hENT1 that are important for interaction with dilazep and dipyridamole. The individual amino acid residues responsible for interaction with dilazep and dipyridamole have not yet been identified. The goal of the current study was to identify amino acid residues involved in dilazep and dipyridamole interaction by using a phenotypic complementation assay to screen a library of randomly mutated yeast expression plasmids containing the hENT1 cDNA (pYPhENT1) for functional thymidine transport-competent mutants with reduced sensitivity to dilazep. The complementation assay is based on the ability of recombinant hENT1 produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to import thymidine under conditions of dTMP starvation, thereby allowing growth, which is inhibited by the addition of dilazep to the assay medium (22Hogue D.L.

Commun. 1997; 238: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). hENT1 cDNAs were isolated from the resulting mutant clones and sequenced, revealing a mutation in codon 33 that converted Met33 to Ile (M33I). When mutant and wild type recombinant hENT1 were produced in S. cerevisiae and Xenopus laevis oocytes to quantitate dilazep and dipyridamole sensitivity, a significant decrease in sensitivity was observed for the mutated protein. The corresponding residue in hENT2 (Ile33) was therefore converted to a Met by site-directed mutagenesis, and the sensitivity of the resulting mutant to dilazep and dipyridamole was assessed. The results suggested that residue 33 in the first TM segment (Met versus Ile) contributes importantly to the ability of dilazep and dipyridamole to interact with hENT1 and hENT2. DISCUSSIONThe results of molecular cloning and functional expression studies on recombinant ENTs are consistent with the findings of studies ones- and ei-type transport processes in cultured cell lines and erythrocytes. The human and mouse es-type transporters, which correspond to the hENT1 and mENT1 proteins, are highly sensitive to dilazep and dipyridamole (3Griffith D.A. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys.

In contrast, rat es and human, mouse, and rat eitransporters are relatively insensitive to transport inhibition by dilazep and dipyridamole, and these observed effects have been correlated with the transport-inhibition phenotypes of recombinant rENT1, hENT2, mENT2, and rENT2 (3Griffith D.A.

Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 134-141PubMed Google Scholar, 35Jarvis S.M. Janmohamed S.N. Young J.D. Biochem. J. 1983; 216: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 39Koren R. Cass C.E.

A unifying model that has been suggested for permeant and inhibitor binding to hENT1 describes two binding sites in which permeants, NBMPR, and other inhibitors such as dilazep and dipyridamole compete for a single high affinity site, which is subject to allosteric modulation by a distinct broad specificity low affinity site that binds nucleosides, nucleobases, and inhibitors when present at very high concentrations (3Griffith D.A. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 153-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The contribution of the potential allosteric binding site of hENT1 was likely to be negligible in the experiments of the current study because the Hill coefficients indicated the presence of a single class of binding sites. These results suggested that mutation of residue 33 affected dilazep and dipyridamole binding to the competitive binding site.The current study established that residue 33 of hENT1 and hENT2 is important for dilazep and dipyridamole interaction. It is not clear whether residue 33 of hENT1 and hENT2 is directly involved in permeant or inhibitor binding or whether the effects observed when it was mutated were due to changes in the tertiary structure of these proteins. The alternatives are difficult to resolve in the absence of detailed structural data. Future studies include using different random mutagenesis and screening approaches to identify other residues that may be important for interaction with nucleoside transport inhibitors. The results of molecular cloning and functional expression studies on recombinant ENTs are consistent with the findings of studies ones- and ei-type transport processes in cultured cell lines and erythrocytes. The human and mouse es-type transporters, which correspond to the hENT1 and mENT1 proteins, are highly sensitive to dilazep and dipyridamole (3Griffith D.A. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys.

In contrast, rat es and human, mouse, and rat eitransporters are relatively insensitive to transport inhibition by dilazep and dipyridamole, and these observed effects have been correlated with the transport-inhibition phenotypes of recombinant rENT1, hENT2, mENT2, and rENT2 (3Griffith D.A.

The current study provides evidence that mutation of residue 33 of the hENT1 and hENT2 proteins affects interaction with dilazep and dipyridamole significantly. The identity of this residue (Met versus Ile) corresponds with the relative dilazep and dipyridamole sensitivities of the known mammalian ENTs, being a Met in human and mouse ENT1 and an Ile in rat ENT1 and human, mouse, and rat ENT2 proteins (Fig. 2) (18Yao S.Y.

Mutation of Met33 to Ile in hENT1 decreased the sensitivity of uridine transport to inhibition by dilazep and dipyridamole (as seen by the >10-fold increase in Ki values) but did not alter the affinity for uridine (similar Km values) or the sensitivity to inhibition of uridine transport by NBMPR (similarKi values). In contrast, the sensitivity of hENT2 to dilazep and dipyridamole was increased >10-fold when Ile33was converted to Met, the affinity for uridine was increased 8.4-fold, and NBMPR sensitivity was not affected. These results, which implicated residue 33 in uridine interaction with hENT2 but not hENT1, suggested a difference in the permeant binding pockets of the two proteins. hENT1 and hENT2 are known to have different permeant binding properties because hENT2 is capable of transporting nucleobases and antiviral dideoxynucleoside analogs, whereas hENT1 is not (43Osses N.

The apparent Km value for uridine transport obtained for recombinant hENT1 in yeast (Table I) was 110 ± 12 μm, whereas values of 200–260 μm have been obtained for recombinant hENT1 in other expression systems (cultured cells, X. laevis oocytes) and for the native protein in human erythrocytes (19Ward J.L.

The basis for this discrepancy is uncertain but may have been due to the human protein being inserted into the yeast plasma membrane environment and/or an altered state of glycosylation, resulting in subtle changes in the conformation of the uridine-binding pocket. Previous work in which chimeric recombinant proteins were created by substituting domains between inhibitor-sensitive hENT1 and inhibitor-insensitive rENT1 suggested that the region including residues 100–231 (which includes TM segments 3–6) is the major site of interaction with dilazep and dipyridamole and that residues 1–99 (TM segments 1–2) play a secondary role (21Sundaram M.

TM segments 3–6 were also implicated in the interaction of rENT1 with NBMPR (46Sundaram M. Yao S.Y. Ng A.M. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8146-8151Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The chimera studies demonstrated that the N-terminal half of hENT1 is critical for interaction with the inhibitors. In this work, when recombinant hENT1-M33I was characterized in the same expression system (X. laevis oocytes) as was utilized in the chimera study, the relative effect of the mutation on dipyridamole sensitivity was comparable with that observed in yeast. These oocyte results confirmed participation of Met33, which is predicted to be the last residue in TM segment 1, in binding of dilazep and dipyridamole. That the M33I mutation reduced but did not abolish inhibitor sensitivity in hENT1 (compared with rENT1 and rENT2, which are totally resistant to inhibition) suggests that binding of dipyridamole and dilazep is likely to be complex, involving contributions from several amino acid residues from different regions of hENT1. The results of equilibrium binding studies in cells with thees transport process, for which ENT1 proteins are believed to be responsible, have led to the conclusion that dilazep and dipyridamole are competitive inhibitors for a single or overlapping exofacial NBMPR and permeant binding site (17Jarvis S.M.

Here, we show that phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase is constitutively active and controls cell motility of highly invasive breast cancer cells by the activation of transcription factor, NF-κB. The urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) promoter contains an NF-κB binding site, and uPA expression in MDA-MB-231 cells is induced by the constitutively active NF-κB. Thus, motility was inhibited by overexpression of a dominant negative p85α regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase (p85DN), as well as by pretreatment of cells with specific inhibitors of the p110 catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase, wortmannin and LY294002. The involvement of gene transcription in cell motility was suggested because treatment with actinomycin D and cycloheximide, which inhibit transcription and new protein synthesis, respectively, abolished endogenous migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. Although wortmannin, Ly294002, or overexpression of p85DN did not significantly reduce DNA binding activity of NF-κB in nuclear extracts, wortmannin, Ly294002, and the overexpression of p85DN or IκBα inhibited constitutive activation of NF-κB in a reporter gene assay. Highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells constitutively secreted uPA in amounts significantly higher than poorly invasive MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, inhibition of NF-κB markedly attenuated endogenous migration, and inhibition of PI 3-kinase and NF-κB reduced secretion of uPA.

Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2910) Google Scholar). The activity of NF-κB is controlled by NF-κB inhibitors, IκBs, a family of proteins, which bind to NF-κB dimers, hiding their nuclear localization sequence resulting in cytoplasmic retention of NF-κB (15Baldwin A.S.

NF-κB also forms complexes with IκBα, which contains a nuclear export sequence, and the whole NF-κB-IκBα complex can be removed from the nucleus by exportin-mediated transport to the cytoplasm (17Arenzana-Seisdedos F.

A direct link between activation of NF-κB and PI 3-kinase by the association of the tyrosine phosphorylated IκBα and the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase, p85α, has recently been demonstrated (23Beraud C. Henzel W.J. Baeuerle P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In addition, another mechanism of NF-κB activation involving the catalytic (p110) subunit has been recently suggested (23Beraud C. Henzel W.J. Baeuerle P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Interestingly, IL-1 stimulated the PI 3-kinase-dependent phosphorylation and transactivation of NF-κB without nuclear translocation of NF-κB, suggesting the alternative NF-κB activation pathway not involving IκBα (24Sizemore N. Leung S. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) is a serine protease that cleaves the extracellular matrix and stimulates the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin (25Besser D. Verde P. Nagamine Y.

Plasmin can directly mediate invasion by degrading matrix proteins such as collagen IV, fibronectin, and laminin or indirectly by activating matrix metalloproteinases 2, 3, and 9 and uPA (26Sheela S.

It is well documented that uPA plays a crucial role in tumor metastasis, and overexpression of uPA in breast cancers is a strong indicator of poor prognosis (32Danø K. Behrendt N. Brunner N. Ellis V.

Therefore, elucidation of signaling pathways responsible for the increased migratory potential of cancer cells will help to find new targets for the reduction of uPA secretion. The present study was undertaken to characterize the role of the constitutively active PI 3-kinase, NF-κB, and uPA in the motility of human breast cancer cells. We demonstrate that the highly invasive human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 expresses increased levels of PI 3-kinase activity and NF-κB DNA binding activity, as compared with levels expressed by poorly invasive MCF-7 cells. The motility of MDA-MB-231 cells is inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors as well as by overexpression of a dominant negative PI 3-kinase regulatory subunit, p85DN. Here we also show that treatment with wortmannin and Ly294002 and overexpression of p85DN inhibit the constitutive transactivation of NF-κB, as assessed using a reporter gene assay. The motility of MDA-MB-231 cells was also reduced by the inhibition of NF-κB, and the secretion of uPA was decreased by the inhibition of PI 3-kinase and NF-κB. Taken together, our data suggest that secretion of uPA is tightly regulated by constitutively activated PI 3-kinase and NF-κB and is responsible for increased motility of highly invasive breast cancer cells. MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with penicillin (50 units/ml), streptomycin (50 units/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum.

Biol. 1997; 17: 3629-3639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MDA-MB-231 cells were harvested and preincubated with specific inhibitors, as indicated in the text. Chemokinesis was assessed in Transwell chambers (6.5-mm diameter polycarbonate filters; 8-μm pore size) in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum after 3 h of incubation, as previously described (34Sliva D. Mason R. Xiao H. English D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the cells were transfected with p85DN or IκBα plasmids, respectively, and harvested after 48 h. Migration assays were performed after 4 h of incubation, as described above. After fixing and staining, the number of migrating cells was determined microscopically by enumeration at 20× magnification from at least four random fields (34Sliva D. Mason R. Xiao H. English D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The data points represent the averages ± S.D. of four individual filters within one representative experiment repeated at least twice. MDA-MB-231 (1 × 106cells/100-mm dish) were split the day prior to transfection in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. Transient transfections were performed with the Effectene reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions with various plasmid combinations as indicated (transfection efficiency was usually about 70–80%, as assessed by the standard procedure with β-galactosidase staining). MDA-MB-231 or MCF-7 cells (5 × 106) were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm NaF and 1 mm Na3VO4. The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mmEDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) and kept on ice for 15 min. The cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm to remove detergent-insoluble material. The protein concentration was determined by using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. In some experiments, MDA-MB-231 cells were pretreated with PI 3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, as indicated in the text. PI 3-kinase assays were performed as described with slight modifications (35Gold M.R. Duronio V. Saxena S.P. Schrader J.W. Aebersold R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5403-5412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell lysates (1 mg/ml) were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal p85α antibody (2 μg) followed by overnight incubation with protein G-plus/protein A-agarose. Immunocomplexes were recovered by centrifugation and washed twice with lysis buffer, twice with 10 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, and twice with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. PI 3-kinase activity was assayed in a total volume of 0.05 ml of assay buffer (25 mm Hepes, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA) containing 0.25 mg/ml of phosphatidylinositol, 100 mm ATP, and 15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were carried out for 10 min at 30 °C and terminated by the addition of acidified chloroform-methanol (2:1). The lipids were extracted as previously described (36Rizzo M.T. Weber G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2611-2614PubMed Google Scholar) and separated on oxalate-treated plastic TLC plates using a solvent system consisting of chloroform, methanol, 20% methylamine (65:35:10 v/v/v). Spots corresponding to the positions of radioactive phosphatidylinositol phosphate were visualized by autoradiography, excised, and quantified by scintillation counting. MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with control plasmid pCMV6 or dominant negative Myc-tagged p85α (pCMV6-Myc-p85αDN), as described above. After 48 h, the cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated, and Western blot analysis with anti-c-Myc (9E10) antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) was carried out as described (37Sliva D. Zhu Y.-X. Tsai S. Kamine J. Yang Y.-C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The expression of IκBα in MDA-MB-231 was determined in the whole cell extracts (25 μg) subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with anti-IκBα antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). The homogeneity of expression was confirmed by reprobing blots with anti-actin antibody (Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA). Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (38Sliva D. Wood T.J.J. Schindler C. Lobie P.E. Norstedt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26208-26214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GEMSA was performed with 32P-labeled NF-κB according to the manufacturer's instruction (Promega, Madison, WI). Oligonucleotide probes containing consensus sequences for NF-κB and AP-1 binding sites, and recombinant human NF-κB protein (p50) were purchased from Promega. MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with 1 μg of NF-κB-CAT reporter construct, 3 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector pCH110 (for the normalization of transfection efficiency), and different amounts of p85DN or IκBα plasmids, as indicated in the text. In some experiments, cells transfected with the NF-κB-CAT reporter construct and the β-galactosidase expression vector pCH110 were treated with specific inhibitors as described below. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, the cell extracts were prepared, and β-galactosidase activity was measured as described elsewhere (39Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990: 9.7.1-9.7.1.1Google Scholar). Normalized amounts (equal numbers of β-galactosidase units) of cell extracts were used in liquid CAT assay with [14C]chloramphenicol as described (39Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990: 9.7.1-9.7.1.1Google Scholar). The data points represent the averages ± S.D. of three to six independent transfection experiments. DMEM from MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells untreated or treated with specific inhibitors were collected after 48 h. The medium was concentrated 10-fold by using a Microcon YM-10 filter (Amicon, Cambridge, MA). Secretion of uPA was detected by Western blot analysis of conditioned medium with anti-uPA antibody (Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA). We have previously shown that, in addition to agonist-dependent receptor-mediated migration, constitutive activation of specific signaling pathways is responsible for the enhanced migration of invasive MDA-MB-231 cells, pathways that are not active in poorly invasive MCF-7 cells (34Sliva D. Mason R. Xiao H. English D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To assess the involvement of PI 3-kinase in the metastatic motility of breast cancer cells, we compared basal PI 3-kinase activity in nonmetastatic MCF-7 cells with that of highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells. Cell extracts were prepared, and p85α immunoprecipitates were assayed for PI 3-kinase activity. As seen in Fig. 1A, MDA-MB-231 cells displayed a 3.6-fold increase in the level of endogenous PI 3-kinase activity over that observed in MCF-7 cells. We next examined the effect of PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 on the endogenous activation of PI 3-kinase in MDA-MB-231 cells. The cells were pretreated for 1 h with wortmannin (100 nm) or Ly294002 (10 μm), the cell extracts were prepared, and p85α immunoprecipitates were assayed for PI 3-kinase activity as described above. As seen in Fig. 1C, both wortmannin and LY294002 significantly inhibited constitutive activation of PI 3-kinase in MDA-MB-231 cells. Thus, PI 3-kinase is constitutively active in highly invasive breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, consistent with the hypothesis that PI 3-kinase is involved in increased metastatic potential of these cells. To determine which of the PI 3-kinase subunits was responsible for enhanced cell motility, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with specific inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, wortmannin and LY294002. Wortmannin has previously been shown to form a complex with the p110 subunit and therefore inhibits the catalytic activity of p110 (40Wymann M.P. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Zvelebil M.J. Pirola B. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1722-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Another PI 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, does not covalently react with p110 but instead targets the ATP-binding site of p110, resulting in catalytic inactivation (41Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pretreatment of cells with wortmannin (1 h, 10–100 nm) and LY294002 (1 h, 1–10 μm) significantly reduced constitutive migration of MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.2A). Thus, the catalytic subunit (p110) of PI 3-kinase is necessary for enhanced endogenous cell motility. Next, we investigated the role of the regulatory subunit (p85α) of PI 3-kinase in enhanced constitutive migration. MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with a dominant negative construct of PI 3-kinase, Myc-p85αDN, and migration was measured 48 h after transfection. The expression of Myc-tagged p85DN in MDA-MB-231 cells was verified by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis with Myc antibody (Fig.2B). As seen in Fig. 2C, increased concentrations of transfected p85DN (0.5–5.0 μg DNA) significantly inhibited constitutive migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. These results suggest that in addition to the catalytic p110 subunit, regulatory p85α subunits also play an important role in constitutive migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. Thus, enhanced migration of these cancer cells can be abolished either by the inhibition of the catalytic or regulatory subunits of PI 3-kinase. As demonstrated above, constitutively active PI 3-kinase is responsible for the enhanced motility of MDA-MB-231 cells. Recently, it has been shown that both regulatory (p85α) and catalytic (p110) subunits of PI 3-kinase are involved in the activation of NF-κB by a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent pathway (23Beraud C. Henzel W.J. Baeuerle P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In addition, constitutive DNA binding activity and transactivation of NF-κB has been reported in MDA-MB-231 cells (21Nakshatri H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Martin D.A. Goulet Jr., R.J. Sledge Jr., G.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3629-3639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To compare the DNA binding activity of NF-κB with the migratory potential of breast cancer cells, we prepared nuclear extracts from highly and poorly invasive MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, respectively. Gel shift analysis confirmed constitutive NF-κB DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts from MDA-MB-231 cells, the specificity of which was determined by competitive and supershift assays with recombinant human p50 subunit of NF-κB (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–4). NF-κB DNA binding activity was significantly increased in MDA-MB-231 cells as compared with the activity in MCF-cells (Fig.3A, lanes 1 and 5). Therefore, we postulated that inhibition of constitutively active PI 3-kinase would decrease endogenous transactivation of NF-κB and also constitutive DNA binding activity of NF-κB. MDA-MB-231 cells were transiently transfected with a reporter CAT plasmid containing multiple NF-κB binding sites (NF-κB-CAT) and increased concentrations of p85DN (0.25–5.0 μg of DNA). As seen in Fig. 3B, overexpression of p85DN repressed constitutive transactivation of NF-κB, suggesting that p85α directly controls the transactivation of NF-κB in MDA-MB-231 cells. To test whether the catalytic p110 subunit of PI 3-kinase is also involved in the constitutive transactivation of NF-κB, MDA-MB-231 cells were transiently transfected with a reporter NF-κB-CAT plasmid and treated with wortmannin or LY294002. Exposure of MDA-MB-231 cells to 1–100 nm wortmannin or 1–10 μm LY294002 for 24 h inhibited constitutive transactivation of NF-κB, as assessed by the CAT reporter gene assay (Fig. 3C). To compare constitutive transactivation of NF-κB with the NF-κB DNA binding activity, the cells were transfected with p85DN or treated with wortmannin and LY294002, and nuclear extracts were subjected to gel shift analysis. Surprisingly, neither transfection with p85DN (Fig. 3D) nor treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with wortmannin or LY294002 affected the DNA binding activity of NF-κB (Fig. 3E). These results suggest that both regulatory (p85α) and catalytic (p110) subunits of PI 3-kinase control the activity of NF-κB at the transactivation level because the constitutive NF-κB DNA binding activity was not affected by the inhibition of PI 3-kinase. To confirm the role of protein synthesis in cell migration in this system, MDA-MB-231 cells were pretreated with actinomycin D and cycloheximide for 1 h, and migration was determined as described above. As seen in Fig.4A, both actinomycin D (1 and 10 μg/ml) and cycloheximide (1 and 10 μg/ml) significantly inhibited endogenous migration of MDA-MB-231 cells in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that cell motility is, in fact, dependent on the transcription and de novo protein synthesis. We further investigated whether the inhibition of NF-κB suppresses migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with specific NF-κB inhibitor PPM-18 (42Yu S.M. Wu J.F. Lin T.L. Kuo S.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cell migration assays revealed that 1 h of pretreatment with PPM-18 (0.01–1 μm) markedly suppressed cell motility in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). These results are consistent with our hypothesis that constitutive transactivation of NF-κB is responsible for the enhanced motility of invasive breast cancer cells. To identify whether NF-κB-dependent motility is regulated by the natural NF-κB inhibitor IκBα, MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with pCMV-IκBα expression vector and control pCMV vector. After 48 h, cell migration was determined as described above. Increased concentration of overexpressed IκBα (0.25–5 μg of DNA) significantly inhibited migration of MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.5A). To confirm that the inhibition of migration caused by the overexpression of IκBα is directly linked to the transactivation of NF-κB, MDA-MB-231, the cells were transfected with pCMV-IκBα and pCMV expression vectors and reporter NF-κB-CAT construct. As seen in Fig. 5B, overexpression of IκBα (0.25–5 μg DNA) extensively repressed the NF-κB-CAT activity. These results show that NF-κB regulates the motility of MDA-MB-231 cells. As demonstrated above, overexpression of IκBα abolishes cell motility and NF-κB transactivation in MDA-MB-231 cells. Therefore, we investigated whether the inhibition of PI 3-kinase would directly increase the levels of IκBα and, by sequestering NF-κB in cytoplasm, would repress cell migration. MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with a control vector or dominant negative p85DN, and the cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with IκBα antibody. Regardless of the dramatic decrease in cell motility and constitutive NF-κB transactivation, overexpression of p85DN did not increase the levels of IκBα (Fig. 6A). Additionally, treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with wortmannin (1, 10, and 100 nm) or LY294002 (1, 5, and 10 μm) had no significant effect on IκBα levels (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that PI 3-kinase inhibits the transactivation of NF-κB and cell motility by altering or participating in a distinct signaling pathway, which is independent of IκBα. In addition to proteolytic activity of uPA necessary for cell invasion, uPA is also responsible for cell migration (30Blasi F. Immunol.

We previously solved the structure of recombinant human gastric lipase (HGL) at 3.0-Å resolution in its closed form; this was the first structure to be described within the mammalian acid lipase family. Here we report on the open structure of the recombinant dog gastric lipase (r-DGL) at 2.7-Å resolution in complex with the undecyl-butyl (C11Y4) phosphonate inhibitor. HGL and r-DGL show 85.7% amino acid sequence identity, which makes it relevant to compare the forms from two different species. The open r-DGL structure confirms the previous description of the HGL catalytic triad (Ser153, His353, and Asp324) with the catalytic serine buried and an oxyanion hole (NH groups of Gln154 and Leu67). In r-DGL, the binding of the C11Y4 phosphonate inhibitor induces part of the cap domain, the lid, to roll over the enzyme surface and to expose a catalytic crevice measuring ∼20 × 20 × 7 Å3. The C11Y4 phosphonate fits into this crevice, and a molecule of β-octyl glucoside fills up the crevice. The C11Y4 phosphonate inhibitor and the detergent molecule suggest a possible binding mode for the natural substrates, the triglyceride molecules.

However, with a view to therapeutic applications, r-DGL production by a safe eukaryotic system of expression such as transgenic plants provides an attractive alternative. Transgenic plants offer considerable advantages, such as large production yields and the fact that they entail no risk of contamination by pathogens infectious to humans, whereas they contain the cell machinery mediating eukaryotic protein modifications. The first transgenic plants producing r-DGL were constructed in tobacco (9Gruber V. Berna P. Arnaud T. Bournat P. Clément C. Mison D. Olagnier B. Philippe L. Theisen M. Baudino S. Bénicourt C.

Lipids. 1999; 100: 3-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) by replacing the carbonyl of the hydrolyzable ester bonds by a phosphonate group with a suitable leaving group and were investigated as potential HPL and human gastric lipase (HGL) inhibitors. The crystal structure of the pancreatic lipase-colipase complex inhibited by C11-carboxymethyl phosphonate was determined at a resolution of 2.46 Å (19Egloff M.-P. Marguet F. Buono G. Verger R. Cambillau C. van Tilbeurgh H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2751-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). It has been confirmed that the covalently inhibited lipases are in the so-called open conformation, i.e. that the lid has moved away, giving free access to the active-site serine (22van Tilbeurgh H. Egloff M.-P. Martinez C. Rugani N. Verger R. Cambillau C. Nature. 1993; 362: 814-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). After suitable crystals of r-HGL were obtained, Roussel et al. (23Roussel A. Canaan S. Egloff M.P. Rivière M. Dupuis L. Verger R. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16995-17002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) solved its three-dimensional structure at 3.0-Å resolution. This was the first structure of a mammalian acid lipase to be elucidated. Both the connectivity and the structure of HGL are similar to those of the serine carboxypeptidases: the protein is globular and composed of three superimposed structural elements, namely a core domain, a cap domain, which was assumed to be the lipid binding site, and a putative lid covering the catalytic serine. Thus Rousselet al. (23Roussel A. Canaan S. Egloff M.P. Rivière M. Dupuis L. Verger R. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16995-17002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) concluded that the HGL was crystallized in its closed conformation and that the lid-opening mechanism might be more complex than a simple rigid body movement. Because HGL and DGL show 85.7% amino acid sequence identity, the crystal structure at 2.7-Å resolution of r-DGL inhibited by a C11Y4 phosphonate was determined in the present study. The DGL cDNA used was obtained from plasmid pDGL5.303 (24Blanchard, C., Bénicourt, C., and Junien, J. L. (June 23, 1994) Patent Cooperation Treaty Patent WO94/13816Google Scholar) on a 1-kb BglII–XbaI fragment. The DGL coding sequence was fused by performing restriction enzyme-based cloning to the polymerase chain reaction-amplified N-terminal signal sequence of the rabbit gastric lipase precursor composed of its first 22 amino acids (6Moreau H. Gargouri Y. Lecat D. Junien J.-L. Verger R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 960: 286-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 25Junien, J. L., Verger, R., Lecat, D., and Moreau, H. (March 10, 1993) U. S. Patent 5075231 (December 24, 1991), EP Patent 0261016Google Scholar). The resulting sequence was placed under the control of the γ-zein promoter of maize (26Reina M. Ponte I. Guillen P. Boronat A. Palau J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 186426Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), which confers a seed expression, and the nopaline synthase terminator of Agrobacterium tumefaciens (27Depicker C. Stachel S. Dhaese P. Zambryski P. Goodman H.M. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 561-573PubMed Google Scholar) in the pUC18 plasmid (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid is called pDGLm. The plasmid pbar carries the Streptomyces hygroscopicus bar gene (28Thompson C.J. Novva N.R. Tizard R. Crameri R. Davies J.E. Lauwereys M. Botterman J. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2519-2523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) used to select the transformed plants. The bar gene is under the control of the rice actin 1 promoter (29McElroy D. Blowers A.D. Jenes B. Wu R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 231: 150-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and the nopaline synthase terminator ofA. tumefaciens in the pSP72 plasmid (Promega). An established callus line derived from a single immature embryo of the Hi-II maize germplasm (30Armstrong C.L. Green C.E. Phillips R.L. Maize Genet. Coop. Newsl. 1991; 65: 92-93Google Scholar) was transformed using particle bombardment-mediated transformation procedures with a helium-powered particle acceleration device, PDS 1000 (Bio-Rad). Tissue showing friable type II embryogenic morphology was sieved and cotransformed with the two plasmids, pDGLm and pbar, as described by Tomes et al. (31Tomes D.T. Ross M.C. Songstad D.D. Gamborg O.L. Philpis C.G. Plant Cell Tissue and Organ Culture: Fundamental Methods. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1995: 197-213Google Scholar). Transformants expressing thebar gene were selected. Multiple callus-derived plants were generated, transferred to the greenhouse, and crossed with an untransformed elite inbred to produce T1 seeds. The T1 seeds were assayed to determine the lipase expression levels, and the highest expressors were selected. Several T1 plants derived from a selected event were self-pollinated; the resulting T2 seeds and their progeny were subjected to analysis; and the r-DGL was extracted and purified. Dried maize seeds were ground, giving a yellowish white powder, which was subsequently washed twice with 5 volumes of hexane. The dried filtration cake was then extracted (10 liters of buffer/kg of flour) by 50 mmglycine-HCl, pH 3, containing 250 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, and 1 mm Triton X-100 under stirring at room temperature for 16 h. The macerate was filtered through 25- and 5-μm filters and diluted with 50 mm glycine-HCl, pH 3, until the conductivity was <20 mS at 20 °C. This solution was then loaded onto an S Ceramic Hyper D column (cationic exchanger; Biosepra) using a linear flow rate of 300 cm/h. The r-DGL was eluted using a 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 4, containing 500 mmNaCl. To perform immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography, the eluate was loaded onto a Cu2+-Fractogel EMD chelate 650M (Merck). The purified r-DGL was then eluted with a 10 mmglycine buffer, pH 3, containing 500 mm AcNH4. The eluate was diafiltered through a 30-kDa polyethersulfone membrane using a 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5. The enzyme was freeze-dried in the presence of mannitol and kept at a low temperature (−20 °C). Under these conditions, no loss of enzyme activity occurs for up to 6 months. The lyophilized powder used in this study contained 70% (w/w) protein, 20% (w/w) mannitol, used as a stabilizer, and 10% various salts and buffer. At this stage, the rDGL was ∼97% pure. For crystallization purposes, further purification was needed, and 2 mg of r-DGL were dissolved in 500 μl of water and applied to a MonoQ fast protein liquid chromatography column equilibrated with 10 mm 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid, pH 7. The active fractions were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–500 mm) and concentrated using a Speed Vacuum apparatus. The SDS gels displayed a single protein band (Fig.1A) and its isoelectric point, as analyzed with isoelectric focusing gels, was ∼6.7 (Fig.1B). Proteins were quantified using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay method (32Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermansong G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18647) Google Scholar).The r-DGL activity was measured potentiometrically using a pH-stat set. The substrates used were either a defined mixture of long-chain triacylglycerols (Intralipid 30%; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) or a short-chain triacylglycerol (tributyrin). With both substrates, the lipolytic activity was measured at 37 °C under the conditions described by Gargouri et al. (5Gargouri Y. Piéroni G. Rivière C. Saunière J.-F. Lowe P.A. Sarda L. Verger R. Gastroenterology. 1986; 91: 919-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of r-DGL activity corresponds to the release of 1 μmol of fatty acid/min. Inhibition of r-DGL was carried out in the presence of β-octyl glucoside (β-OG; 30 mm final concentration) and a molar excess of C11Y4 phosphonate to r-DGL of 50-fold. After the evaporation of the chloroform, which dissolves the C11Y4 phosphonate, the inhibitor was dissolved in isopropyl alcohol (4% w/w final concentration). After adding β-OG to the inhibitor, r-DGL was also added (final volume, 50 μl). The residual activity measured after 1 h of incubation was 10%. Spectra were recorded with a Kontron spectrofluorimeter using a front face fluorescence accessory. The spectra were computed with Hyperterminal software program. All fluorescence experiments were carried out in 10 mm sodium acetate and 0.1 m NaCl, pH 5, at 20 °C (excitation 297, nm; emission, 400–575 nm). A slit width of 1 nm was used for the fluorescence emission recordings. The fluorescence of 1-amino-anthracene (AMA) was measured by adding to the lipase samples (0.5 μm, final concentration) aliquots of a stock solution of AMA (5 mm) solubilized in 100% isopropyl alcohol. The final concentration of AMA was 10 μm. The fluorescence emission was recorded after the spectroscopic signal had been left to stabilize for 5 min. Control experiments were performed in the absence of lipase. Crystallization experiments were performed using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals of the inhibited r-DGL were obtained by mixing 1 μl of a well solution (30% polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 2000, 0.1 m sodium acetate, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, pH 4.6) with 1 μl of protein solution at 5 mg/ml. X-ray diffraction data were collected to 2.7-Å resolution on a Mar Research CDD camera with λ = 0.979 Å on beam line BM14 at ESRF (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France). The data were processed using the DENZO software package (33Otwinovsky Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). r-DGL·C11Y4 phosphonate inhibitor complex crystallized in the space group C2221 with cell dimensionsa = 61.2 Å, b = 164.5 Å, andc = 177 Å. Specific volume calculations yielded two molecules per asymmetric unit, with a solvent content of 40%.

Open table in a new tab The structure of the r-DGL·C11Y4 phosphonate inhibitor complex was solved with the molecular replacement method using the AMoRe program (34Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. 1994; A50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar). The HGL structure (Protein Data Bank code 1HLG) was used as the search model. A zone containing the putative lid (residues 208–264) was removed from the model. The rotation function gave a single solution, leading to two positions in the translation function. Before the fitting procedure, the correlation coefficient and R-factor were 38.7 and 47.5%, respectively, which refined to 45.0 and 44.2%, respectively. The lid in the open form and the C11Y4 phosphonate inhibitor were built unambiguously in the Fourier difference map with the Turbo-Frodo software program (35Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991: 86Google Scholar). Refinement with CNS (36Brunger A.T. X-plor Version 3.843 Manual. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1996Google Scholar) was carried out between 20- and 2.7-Å resolution. The final model has a satisfactory geometry, with anR-free factor of 25.8% and an R-factor of 19.2%. The refinement statistics are given in Table I. The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession number1K8Q. A program of large-scale r-DGL production has been carried out by the Institut de Recherche Jouveinal/Parke-Davis in view of using it as a treatment for patients suffering from exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Production of enzymes by transgenic plants makes it possible to obtain large production yields without risk of contamination by pathogens infectious to humans but containing the cell machinery mediating eukaryotic protein modifications, such as glycosylation. Indeed, the initial investment is considerable, and this procedure is limited to industrial projects. This kind of production in plants, although very efficient, is not likely to be used on the laboratory scale. However, we took advantage of the availability of gram quantities of DGL for setting up crystallization trials after further purification (see “Experimental Procedures”). The glycosylation pattern in plants, an essential point for the heavily glycosylated gastric lipases, is close to that of eukaryotic systems and does not present the hyperglycosylation features found in yeast. The influence of pH on r-DGL specific activity was tested using an emulsion of short-chain (tributylglycerol) and long-chain (30% Intralipid, purified soybean oil emulsified with egg phosphatidylcholine) triglycerides as substrates. The maximal specific activity on long-chain triglycerides was 1000 units/mg at pH 4.0. With tributylglycerol, the activity follows a Gaussian curve centered at pH 5.4, with a maximum value of 420 units/mg and an S.D. of 1.4 pH units. After numerous unsuccessful attempts at obtaining crystals of gastric lipase from human and other species in its open form, we obtained dog gastric lipase crystals in complex with the C11Y4 phosphonate inhibitor. The high level of amino acid sequence identity between human and dog lipases (85.7%) made it possible to solve the structure using molecular replacement procedures with the core of the protein. The root mean square deviation between closed HGL and open r-DGL, using a cutoff of 1.3 Å, is 0.56 Å for 308 Cα atoms, which accounts for most of the residues outside the lid (308 on 310; see below). A positive elongated difference electron density map emerged at a different place from that corresponding to the closed lid, making it possible to build the open lid easily between residues 212 and 251. Another electron density map was located close to the lid, at the bottom of the putative active site crevice, in contact with the patch of protein density at the level of the catalytic serine 153. A molecule of the C11Y4 phosphonate inhibitor was fitted satisfactorily into this difference electron density map. Another difference electron density region was also present, however, close to the inhibitor. It was modeled satisfactorily with a detergent molecule, β-OG (Fig. 2). The final structure was refined to 2.7-Å resolution with standard procedures using CNS. The crystallographic R-factor based on all the data between 20.0 and 2.7 Å is 19.2%, and the corresponding R-free is 25.8%. The model contains two r-DGL molecules from residues 1 to 377, 8 GlcNAC sugar residues located on the four potentialN-glycolysation sites, 2 molecules of β-OG, 2 molecules of C11Y4 phosphonate inhibitor, and 420 water molecules. The Ramachandran plot shows that 84% of the non-glycine residues are located in the most favorable regions, 15.4% in the additional allowed regions. The remaining 0.6% lies within the generously allowed regions. The active serine is in the ε region of the plot as expected. r-DGL, like HGL, consists of one globular domain and belongs to the α/β hydrolase fold family (Ref. 37Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar and Fig. 3A). In the previously published HGL structure, the N terminus (residues 4–9) and a loop between residues 54 and 56 were not visible in the electron density map (23Roussel A. Canaan S. Egloff M.P. Rivière M. Dupuis L. Verger R. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16995-17002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In the open r-DGL, the polypeptidic chain is visible in the electron density map from the N terminus to residue 377, which is located 2 residues before the C terminus (Fig. 3A). Its N terminus segment is stabilized by contacts with the open lid (Fig.3A), whereas loop 54–56 is stabilized by packing contacts, making for an ordered arrangement, which was clearly visible in the electron density map. The core domain is located between residues 1–183 and 309–377 and contains a central β sheet composed of eight strands, seven of which are parallel and one anti-parallel (strand 2), with 1(−2)435678 connectivity and six helices, 3 on each side of the β sheet (Fig.3A). The lid, the conformation of which differs between the closed (HGL) and open (r-DGL) forms (Fig. 3, B–D), starts abruptly at residue 212 and finishes at residue 251 and is formed of two helices, two elongated structures, and one turn (Fig.3B). The movement of the lid cannot be described as a simple rigid body rotation. Two events occur during the lid opening: a conformational reorganization and a large movement. Although both closed and open lid conformations are mostly helical, their numbers of helices are different. The closed lid is made of three short helices (named αe3, αe4, and αe5; Ref. 23Roussel A. Canaan S. Egloff M.P. Rivière M. Dupuis L. Verger R. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16995-17002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) instead of two helices in the open form (Table II and Fig.3B). Helix H1 (residues 217–228) of the open form is an extension of helix αe3, and helix H2 (residues 231–244) originates from helices αe4 and αe5. The two helices, H1 and H2, are linked together by a disulfide bridge (Cys227-Cys236) in a similar way as helices αe3 and αe4 were in the closed form (23Roussel A. Canaan S. Egloff M.P. Rivière M. Dupuis L. Verger R. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16995-17002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The reorganization of the secondary structural elements leads to a structure that looks more compact and rigid. The opening of the lid is achieved by a 180° rotation of helices H1 and H2 around the axis of helix H2. As a result, the polar face of the two helices becomes buried, whereas the hydrophobic part becomes exposed, as previously described for other lipases. Whereas helix H2 rotates around itself, cysteine 244, at its terminal end, remains in the vicinity of the active site residues, which explains the inhibitory eff"
https://openalex.org/W1974754953,"T lymphocytes can be activated via the T cell receptor (TCR) or by triggering through a number of other cell surface structures, including the CD38 co-receptor molecule. Here, we show that in TCR+ T cells that express a CD3-zeta lacking the cytoplasmic domain, cross-linking with CD38- or CD3-specific monoclonal antibodies induces tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3-epsilon, zeta-associated protein-70, linker for activation of T cells, and Shc. Moreover, in these cells, anti-CD38 or anti-CD3 stimulation leads to protein kinase B/Akt and Erk activation, suggesting that the CD3-zeta-immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs are not required for CD38 signaling in T cells. Interestingly, in unstimulated T cells, lipid rafts are highly enriched in CD38, including the T cells lacking the cytoplasmic tail of CD3-zeta. Moreover, CD38 clustering by extensive cross-linking with an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody and a secondary antibody leads to an increased resistance of CD38 to detergent solubilization, suggesting that CD38 is constitutively associated with membrane rafts. Consistent with this, cholesterol depletion with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin substantially reduces CD38-mediated Akt activation while enhancing CD38-mediated Erk activation. CD38/raft association may improve the signaling capabilities of CD38 via formation of protein/lipid domains to which signaling-competent molecules, such as immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif-bearing CD3 molecules and protein-tyrosine kinases, are recruited."

These inhibitors are now shown to block dimerization of purified human iNOS monomers.

Inhibitors also bound with high affinity to both murine full-length and murine oxygenase domain iNOS monomers.

Inhibitor affinity in the binding assay (apparent Kd values from 330 pm to 27 nm) correlated with potency in a cell-based iNOS assay (IC50 values from 290 pm to 270 nm). Inhibitor potency in cells was not prevented by medium supplementation with l-arginine or sepiapterin, but inhibition decreased with time of addition after cytokine stimulation. The results are consistent with a mechanism whereby inhibitors bind to a heme-containing iNOS monomer species to form an inactive iNOS monomer-heme-inhibitor complex in a pterin- andl-arginine-independent manner. The selectivity for inhibiting dimerization of iNOS versus endothelial and neuronal NOS suggests that the energetics and kinetics of monomer-dimer equilibria are substantially different for the mammalian NOS isoforms.

Adler M. Auld D.S. Baldwin J.J. Blasko E. Browne L.J. Chelsky D. Davey D. Dolle R.E. Eagen K.A. Erickson S. Feldman R.I. Glaser C.B. Mallari C. Morrissey M.M. Ohlmeyer M.H.J. Pan C.H. Parkinson J.F.

Crystallographic studies showed that the inhibitors coordinate the heme in the iNOS monomer, disrupt helix 7a, and displace the critical arginine-binding Glu-371 residue from the active site. In addition helix 8, which is part of the dimer interface, is partially disordered by inhibitor binding. These results suggest that inhibitor binding to iNOS monomer prevents formation of both arginine- and H4B-binding sites and leads to the formation of a “dead-end” inhibitor-monomer complex.Interestingly, although the inhibitors led to accumulation of iNOS monomers in cells, they did not inhibit the catalytic activity of isolated dimeric iNOS. In the present study, biochemical characterization of these inhibitors with isolated human and murine iNOS monomers is presented. In addition, the binding kinetics of these inhibitors to iNOS monomers was determined using a high affinity radiolabeled inhibitor in a rapid filtration binding assay. Binding affinity in this assay correlated with inhibitory potency in cell culture. The results provide further insights into the mechanism of action of these novel inhibitors and introduce new reagents to study iNOS monomer-dimer equilibria.DISCUSSIONNovel pyrimidineimidazole-based iNOS inhibitors previously identified using a cell-based assay (30McMillan K. Adler M. Auld D.S. Baldwin J.J. Blasko E. Browne L.J. Chelsky D. Davey D. Dolle R.E. Eagen K.A. Erickson S. Feldman R.I. Glaser C.B. Mallari C. Morrissey M.M. Ohlmeyer M.H.J. Pan C.H. Parkinson J.F.

A. 2000; 97: 1506-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) are shown here to inhibit dimerization of purified iNOS monomers. In addition, a high affinity radiolabeled inhibitor was used to develop a rapid filtration binding assay using purified human and murine iNOS monomers. This binding assay had a broad dynamic range, allowing for inhibitor affinities to be measured in the pm to μm range and also exhibited good correlation with inhibitor potency in the cell-based assay. The biochemical results are consistent with the pyrimidineimidazoles forming a high affinity complex with iNOS monomers via heme ligation, as evidenced by spectral perturbations and competition with the known iNOS heme ligands imidazole, clotrimazole, and miconazole.Although human iNOS monomer/dimer ratios have been studied in cell lysates (38Tzeng E. Billiar T.R. Robbins P.D. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11771-11775Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 39Eissa N.T. Yuan J.W. Haggerty C.M. Choo E.K. Palmer C.D. Moss J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7625-7630Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the present work is the first to describe human iNOS dimer formation from purified iNOS monomers. The results are thus discussed relative to published studies with murine iNOS monomers. During purification, the mammalian cell-expressed human iNOS monomers were separated from dimeric iNOS using gel filtration chromatography, in the presence of 4 μm H4B at 4 °C, and were stored frozen immediately after elution from the column. Despite the presence of 4 μm H4B, the iNOS monomer preparation contained little dimeric iNOS at the start of the in vitro dimerization assay, and little active iNOS dimer was formed in the presence of H4B alone. Thus, the substratel-arginine rather than H4B appeared to promote human iNOS dimerization under the conditions used. As shown in Fig.2B, not all of the human iNOS monomers could be dimerized even in the presence of excess arginine, H4B, heme, and calmodulin. The data are consistent with the human iNOS monomer preparations containing a mixture of heme-bound (∼10%) and heme-free (∼90%) species and that only the heme-bound species is capable of dimerizing. An implication of these findings is that a large proportion of the recombinant human iNOS monomers isolated from cells have no bound heme and cannot bind exogenously added heme. These are likely to be denatured species that cannot dimerize. The murine iNOS monomer used in the present studies, which was prepared by dissociation of dimeric iNOS with urea, does not require added heme to dimerize, in contrast to results published previously (18Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using monomers isolated directly from mouse macrophage cells. As the murine iNOS monomer preparation is already 95% heme-containing (see “Experimental Procedures”), a requirement for added heme to promote dimerization would not be expected.In relation to time course, arginine- and H4B-dependence, the results with human iNOS are comparable with previous studies using full-length murine iNOS monomer (18Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and murine iNOS oxygenase domain monomer (24Ghosh D.K. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1444-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In these studies, dimerization was minimal with the addition of H4B alone as compared with the addition of both H4B and arginine. However, in other studies using murine iNOS oxygenase domain (28Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Pitters E. Moloney M. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10609-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 41Presta A. Siddhanta U. Wu C. Sennequier N. Huang L. Abu-Soud H.M. Erzurum S. Stuehr D.J.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 298-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), the extent of dimerization observed with H4B alone was about 50% (28Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Pitters E. Moloney M. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10609-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) to over 80% (41Presta A. Siddhanta U. Wu C. Sennequier N. Huang L. Abu-Soud H.M. Erzurum S. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 298-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) that seen with both H4B and arginine. These disparate results may reflect differences in the procedures for monomer isolation.The affinity and reactivity of pyrimidineimidazoles with human and murine iNOS are distinct from imidazole-containing iNOS reported previously. The novel compounds used in this study (see Fig. 1) are derivatized pyrimidineimidazoles with a bulky side chain that interacts with the iNOS monomer at a separate site from the imidazole-heme interaction (30McMillan K. Adler M. Auld D.S. Baldwin J.J. Blasko E. Browne L.J. Chelsky D. Davey D. Dolle R.E. Eagen K.A. Erickson S. Feldman R.I. Glaser C.B. Mallari C. Morrissey M.M. Ohlmeyer M.H.J. Pan C.H. Parkinson J.F. Phillips G.B. Polokoff M.A. Sigal N.H. Vergona R. Whitlow M. Young T.A. Devlin J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1506-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Smaller compounds, such as imidazole, 1-phenylimidazole, and 7-nitroindazole, actually promote dimerization (40Sennequier N. Wolan D. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 930-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Unlike the pyrimidineimidazoles described here, all of these smaller compounds inhibit the activity of dimeric iNOS (14Wolff D.J. Datto Ga.A. Samatovicz R.A. Tempsick R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9425-9429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The heme iron of iNOS monomers can bind large 1-substituted imidazoles with affinity in the micromolar range, consistent with the observation that iNOS monomers contain a relatively open distal heme pocket. The antifungal imidazoles clotrimazole and miconazole prevent iNOS dimerization (40Sennequier N. Wolan D. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 930-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), presumably due to steric hindrance from the aromatic side chains (Fig. 1). The 1000-fold higher affinity of the pyrimidineimidazoles for iNOS monomers over clotrimazole and miconazole is presumably due to specific interactions with residues in the iNOS monomer. The crystal structure of Compound 2 bound to monomeric Δ114-iNOS-ox (30McMillan K. Adler M. Auld D.S. Baldwin J.J. Blasko E. Browne L.J. Chelsky D. Davey D. Dolle R.E. Eagen K.A. Erickson S. Feldman R.I. Glaser C.B. Mallari C. Morrissey M.M. Ohlmeyer M.H.J. Pan C.H. Parkinson J.F. Phillips G.B. Polokoff M.A. Sigal N.H. Vergona R. Whitlow M. Young T.A. Devlin J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1506-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) reveals that the free imidazole nitrogen coordinates directly to the heme, and the benzodioxolane group makes specific contacts with the iNOS monomer, thereby disrupting the arginine-binding site. Compound 2 also disrupts helix 7a and helix 8, which are part of the iNOS dimer interface. These findings predict the formation of a dead-end inhibitor complex that should not be prevented by excess arginine or H4B in cell culture medium. IC50 determinations for Compound 2 in the cell-based assays confirm this hypothesis.A general model for iNOS dimer assembly and its inhibition by these compounds is shown in Fig. 9 and is similar to that proposed for the effects of antifungal imidazoles on murine iNOS (40Sennequier N. Wolan D. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 930-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Heme insertion is the first step in dimerization (18Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,19Klatt P. Pfeiffer S. List B.M. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bachinger H.P. Werner E.R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 26018-26023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Binding of heme leads to the formation of a loosely formed dimer (Fig. 9, DIMER-Fe) which then binds H4B and arginine to form a stable, compact enzymatically active dimer (Fig.9, DIMER-Fe-H4B-Arg). The pyrimidineimidazoles do not inhibit the activity of dimeric iNOS even after prolonged incubation (IC50 >100 μm).3 In addition, spectral binding experiments with purified iNOS confirm high affinity binding to iNOS monomers (Ks < =50 nm) but low affinity binding to iNOS dimers (Ks > 10 μm).2 The correlation between human monomer heme content and inhibitor binding sites from Scatchard analysis indicates that inhibitors do not bind to heme-free, but rather to heme-containing, iNOS monomers. Thus, in cells, these inhibitors act by binding to a transient species that, in the absence of compound, would rapidly dimerize. In the presence of compound, monomeric iNOS is trapped in a nonfunctional monomer-heme-inhibitor complex. An implication of our findings is that in cell culture systems the equilibrium between the heme-containing monomer species and the dimer is in favor of the dimer and that once stable iNOS dimers are formed there is little dissociation back to monomers. This is supported by the finding that iNOS monomer isolated from murine macrophages is heme-free, whereas all heme-containing iNOS is dimeric (18Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of the pyrimidineimidazoles to bind and destabilize the proposed “loose” iNOS dimer that is H4B- and arginine-free, remains to be determined.Previously the pyrimidineimidazoles were shown to exhibit high selectivity (>1000-fold) for inhibiting iNOS versus eNOS dimerization, whereas the selectivity ratio for nNOS was only ∼5-fold for Compound 2 (30McMillan K. Adler M. Auld D.S. Baldwin J.J. Blasko E. Browne L.J. Chelsky D. Davey D. Dolle R.E. Eagen K.A. Erickson S. Feldman R.I. Glaser C.B. Mallari C. Morrissey M.M. Ohlmeyer M.H.J. Pan C.H. Parkinson J.F. Phillips G.B. Polokoff M.A. Sigal N.H. Vergona R. Whitlow M. Young T.A. Devlin J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1506-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). High eNOS selectivity is retained for all of the pyrimidineimidazoles shown in Fig. 1, whereas nNOS selectivity ranges from 5- to 100-fold and is altered by changing the substituents on the pyrimidineimidazole core.3 These results indicate that the compounds exhibit specific affinity for the iNOS and nNOS monomers but may not have appreciable affinity for eNOS monomers. The molecular basis for this isoform selectivity is not readily apparent from analysis of the crystal structures of the active sites of the NOS isoforms.It is also noted that there is an inverse relationship between the stability of the iNOS, nNOS, and eNOS dimers and the isoform selectivity of these pyrimidineimidazoles. It is reported that eNOS dimers are the most stable, nNOS next, and iNOS dimers the least stable, as measured by dimer resistance to chaotropes such as urea or SDS (42Bender A.T. Nakatsuka M. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26018-26023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 43Panda K. Ghosh S. Adak S. Meade A. Stuehr D.J. Nitric Oxide. 2000; 4: 222Google Scholar, 44Klatt P. Schmidt K. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bachinger H.P. Mayer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3687-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to binding specificity, the NOS isoform selectivity may be partially explained by considering the energetics that drive NOS monomer-dimer equilibria. With the other isoforms relative to iNOS, the free energy difference between heme-containing monomer and dimer is larger, and thus the steady state monomer-dimer equilibrium progresses in favor of dimer formation in the order eNOS ≫ nNOS > iNOS. In a competition between the formation of dimer and the formation of a monomer-inhibitor complex, the amount of inhibitor required to effectively compete is dependent upon this equilibrium and therefore is much greater for eNOS than nNOS or iNOS. It is thus formally possible that the inhibitors have appreciable affinity for eNOS monomers, but inhibition is not observed due to the eNOS monomer-dimer equilibrium. The model also predicts that the set point for the eNOS monomer ↔ dimer equilibrium is very heavily in favor of eNOS dimer and that the transient eNOS monomer species with bound heme will be very difficult to isolate. This is consistent with repeated unsuccessful attempts to isolate native heme-containing eNOS monomers using chaotropes that readily provide iNOS and nNOS monomers. 4D. J. Stuehr, unpublished observations.Regarding the general pharmacological selectivity of the pyrimidineimidazoles, extensive receptor and enzyme selectivity tests have been performed with compounds from the series. Compound4 has broad pharmacological selectivity in such assays with IC50 > 10–100 μm and is not cytotoxic.3 Imidazole-containing compounds are known to bind and inhibit cytochromes P450, and interaction with the major metabolizing enzyme CYP-3A4 is potentially problematic. For the pyrimidineimidazoles, cross-reactivity with CYP-3A4, but not other drug-metabolizing P450s, was observed, with a range of potencies depending on chemical substituents.3 The IC50of Compound 4 for CYP-3A4 is ∼150 nm in a microsomal benzyloxyresorufin assay and ∼1 μm in a cell-based testosterone hydroxylase assay. Compound 4 is thus ∼300–2000-fold selective for inhibiting iNOS dimerization in cells versus CYP-3A4. As reported previously (30McMillan K. Adler M. Auld D.S. Baldwin J.J. Blasko E. Browne L.J. Chelsky D. Davey D. Dolle R.E. Eagen K.A. Erickson S. Feldman R.I. Glaser C.B. Mallari C. Morrissey M.M. Ohlmeyer M.H.J. Pan C.H. Parkinson J.F. Phillips G.B. Polokoff M.A. Sigal N.H. Vergona R. Whitlow M. Young T.A. Devlin J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1506-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), Compound4 is more potent in cell culture systems than any other currently known substrate- or pterin-based iNOS inhibitor. In summary, Compound 4 is a highly selective, potent, and cell-permeable research tool that can be used to inhibit specifically iNOS and study its cellular function.The availability of high affinity inhibitors as reported here may be useful in further understanding iNOS dimerization, in both protein-based and cellular systems. [3H]Compound3 accumulates in cells induced to express iNOS by cytokines, presumably by binding to iNOS monomers synthesized within the cell. 5E. Blasko, unpublished observations. Pulse-chase experiments could thus explore the relationship between heme incorporation into iNOS, which may occur co-translationally, and radiolabel incorporation. In addition, dimerization inhibitors could be used to examine the fate of iNOS monomers within cells. It has been shown recently that nNOS monomers are preferentially ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome pathway (45Bender A.T. Demady D.R. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17407-17411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 expression in HT29 and DLD-1 cells targets iNOS for proteasomal degradation (46Felley-Bosco E. Bender F.C. Courjault-Gautier F. Bron C. Quest A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14334-14339Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and the proteasome pathway degrades both human iNOS dimers and monomers when expressed in 293 cells (47Musial A. Eissa N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24268-24273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The effect of iNOS dimerization inhibitors on these processes should be examined because inhibitor-induced proteasomal degradation of iNOS monomers may be a desirable property and contribute to the therapeutic potential of this class of inhibitors. Because of their mode of action and high potency, these novel compounds can be useful tools for new studies elucidating the cellular synthesis and degradation of the iNOS enzyme. The mammalian nitric-oxide synthase (NOS)1 family consists of three isoforms as follows: cytokine-inducible (iNOS), neuronal (nNOS), and endothelial NOS (eNOS). NOS isoforms are homodimers that catalyze NADPH-dependent oxidation of l-arginine to nitric oxide (NO) and l-citrulline (1Marletta M.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 927-930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 2Griffith O.W.

Each monomer subunit of the dimer consists of a C-terminal reductase domain that contains binding sites for NADPH, FAD, FMN, and calmodulin, and an N-terminal oxygenase domain that contains binding sites for heme, tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B), and l-arginine (3Masters B.S.S.

https://openalex.org/W2021701967,"Ha-Ras and Ki-Ras have different distributions across plasma membrane microdomains. The Ras C-terminal anchors are primarily responsible for membrane micro-localization, but recent work has shown that the interaction of Ha-Ras with lipid rafts is modulated by GTP loading via a mechanism that requires the hypervariable region (HVR). We have now identified two regions in the HVR linker domain that regulate Ha-Ras raft association. Release of activated Ha-Ras from lipid rafts is blocked by deleting amino acids 173–179 or 166–172. Alanine replacement of amino acids 173–179 but not 166–172 restores wild type micro-localization, indicating that specific N-terminal sequences of the linker domain operate in concert with a more C-terminal spacer domain to regulate Ha-Ras raft association. Mutations in the linker domain that confine activated Ha-RasG12V to lipid rafts abrogate Raf-1, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and Akt activation and inhibit PC12 cell differentiation. N-Myristoylation also prevents the release of activated Ha-Ras from lipid rafts and inhibits Raf-1 activation. These results demonstrate that the correct modulation of Ha-Ras lateral segregation is critical for downstream signaling. Mutations in the linker domain also suppress the dominant negative phenotype of Ha-RasS17N, indicating that HVR sequences are essential for efficient interaction of Ha-Ras with exchange factors in intact cells. Ha-Ras and Ki-Ras have different distributions across plasma membrane microdomains. The Ras C-terminal anchors are primarily responsible for membrane micro-localization, but recent work has shown that the interaction of Ha-Ras with lipid rafts is modulated by GTP loading via a mechanism that requires the hypervariable region (HVR).

The guanine nucleotide-binding protein Ras acts as a molecular switch connecting extracellular signals with a complex network of intracellular signal transduction pathways that mediate a variety of cellular responses including proliferation and differentiation (1Campbell S.L.

Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The three mammalian ras genes encode for four proteins of 188 and 189 amino acids (Ha-Ras, N-Ras, Ki-RasA, Ki-RasB) that are identical over the N-terminal 85 amino acids and 90% homologous over the next 80 residues. These N-terminal 165 residues are sufficient for binding guanine nucleotides and interacting with effector and exchange factor proteins in vitro. The divergence between the Ras isoforms is largely confined to the final 23 and 24 C-terminal amino acids, the so-called hypervariable region (HVR)1 in which less than 10–15% of residues are identical between any pair of Ras proteins. The localization of Ras to the inner surface of the plasma membrane is essential for its biological activity (3Willumsen B.M. Christensen A. Hubbert N.L. Papageorge A.G. Lowy D. Nature. 1984; 310: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The two signals responsible for the correct plasma membrane localization of Ras are contained in the Ras HVR. The first signal sequence, common to all Ras proteins, is the C-terminal CAAX box (in which A = aliphatic amino acid and X = serine or methionine) that is sequentially farnesylated, -AAXproteolyzed, and carboxyl-methylated (3Willumsen B.M.

This series of posttranslational modifications is completed on the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum. The second signal comprises palmitoylation of two upstream cysteines (Cys181 and Cys184) in Ha-Ras, one cysteine (Cys181) in N-Ras, and a polybasic sequence of multiple lysines (Lys175–180) in Ki-Ras 2The major expressed Ki-Ras protein is Ki-RasB, referred to as Ki-Ras hereafter.2The major expressed Ki-Ras protein is Ki-RasB, referred to as Ki-Ras hereafter.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4033-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). These targeting signals direct the trafficking of Ras to the cell surface via alternative routes. After palmitoylation, probably also in the endoplasmic reticulum, Ha- and N-Ras traffic through the classical exocytic pathway via the Golgi to the plasma membrane (9Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J.

Ki-Ras in contrast bypasses the Golgi and reaches the plasma membrane by an unknown mechanism that may involve transport or simple diffusion (9Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J. Feoktisitov M. Morimoto T.

For convenience we refer to the sequences of the Ras HVR that are involved in trafficking and plasma membrane attachment as the membrane-targeting domain and the remainder of the Ras HVR as the linker domain. A number of studies have shown that the membrane-targeting domains localize Ha-Ras and Ki-Ras to different microdomains of the plasma membrane. A dominant negative mutant of caveolin, CavDGV, which blocks delivery of cholesterol to the plasma membrane (14Pol A. Luetterforst R. Lindsay M. Heino S. Ikonen E. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1057-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), completely blocks Ha-Ras-dependent Raf activation but does not affect Ki-Ras signaling (15Roy S. Luetterforst R. Harding A. Apolloni A. Etheridge M. Stang E. Rolls B. Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. Nature Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The inhibition is reversed by repleting plasma membranes with cholesterol. In addition, chemically depleting plasma membrane cholesterol with cyclodextrin selectively inhibits Ha-Ras but not Ki-Ras function (15Roy S. Luetterforst R. Harding A. Apolloni A. Etheridge M. Stang E. Rolls B. Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. Nature Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that Ha-Ras but not Ki-Ras function is dependent on the integrity of lipid rafts in the plasma membrane. More recently we used electron and fluorescent microscopy coupled with biochemical fractionation to examine the plasma membrane microdomain distributions of Ha- and Ki-Ras (16Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The results were unexpected but clear. The C-terminal minimal membrane-targeting sequences of Ha-Ras localize GFP to caveolae and lipid rafts, whereas the equivalent targeting signals for Ki-Ras do not. Wild type GDP-bound Ha-Ras is distributed equally between lipid raft and non-raft membrane, but constitutively activated GTP-bound Ha-Ras is almost completely excluded from lipid rafts and caveolae. In contrast, GDP- and GTP-loaded Ki-Ras are both absent from caveolae and co-fractionate with markers of disordered plasma membrane. The data suggest that Ha-Ras is in a GTP-regulated equilibrium between lipid rafts and non-raft plasma membrane (16Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 17Prior I.A. Hancock J.F. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1603-1608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Ha-Ras linker domain is necessary for the GTP-dependent release of Ha-Ras from lipid rafts and for biological activity (16Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Other studies have also shown that manipulation of the C-terminal membrane anchor of Ha-Ras decreases Ras biological activity in NIH3T3 and PC12 cells by changing effector pathway utilization (18Booden M.A. Sakaguchi D.S. Buss J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23559-23568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 19Coats S.G. Booden M.A. Buss J.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12926-12934Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Together these observations demonstrate that the integrity of the HVR is essential for normal Ha-Ras signaling. The aim of the present study was to investigate in more detail the role of the HVR linker domain in Ha-Ras function. In particular we wanted to establish what structural features and/or specific sequences in the linker domain contribute to the modulation of Ha-Ras raft association and to examine whether raft association alone determines the efficiency with which Ha-Ras interacts with specific effectors and activators. These are important questions because differential distribution of Ras isoforms, exchange factors, effectors, and effector co-activators across plasma membrane microdomains is the simplest mechanism that can account for the increasing number of biological and in vivobiochemical differences that are being identified between Ha-, Ki-, and N-Ras. Ha-RasG12V cDNA sequences encoding His166 though Asn172 or Pro173though Pro179 were deleted or replaced with polyalanine using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to generate HΔ1-G12V, HΔ1ala-G12V, HΔ2-G12V, and HΔ2ala-G12V, respectively. Mutated cDNAs were fully sequenced and cloned into the expression vector pEXV3, Gly12, and Asn17 versions of the HVR mutants were constructed by recombination with pEXV-Ha-Ras and pEXV-Ha-RasS17N, respectively. EXV-HΔhvr-G12V and EXV-Mys-Ha-Ras have been described previously (16Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F.

Cells were plated onto 10-cm plates at 60% confluence and transfected with 5–10 μg of expression plasmid using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 5 h of incubation with the transfection mix, medium containing 20% calf serum was added for an overnight incubation. Next day, the cells were incubated for 6 h in serum-free medium and then processed. PC12 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% horse serum, 10% calf serum, and 2 mm l-glutamine and were transfected using LipofectAMINE. 16 h after lipofection, the cells were returned to standard PC12 maintenance medium and were incubated a further 48 h prior to processing for confocal microscopy. COS cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum at 37 °C. The cells were electroporated with expression plasmids, and after 48 h, they were serum-starved for 16 h before being harvested for the GTP-loading assays. Transfected BHK and COS cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped on ice into 0.3 ml of Buffer A (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μm NaVO4, 25 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin), and homogenized through a 23-gauge needle. Post-nuclear supernatants obtained by low speed centrifugation were spun at 100,000 ×g at 4 °C for 30 min, and the soluble fraction (S100), which contains cytosolic proteins, was collected. The sedimented fraction (P100), which contains cellular membranes, was rinsed and resuspended in 100 μl of Buffer A. Protein content was measured by the Bradford reaction. 20 μg each of S100 and P100 fraction was separated in 10 and 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Western blotting was performed using the following antibodies: Ras (Y13–259), Phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser217/221) (No. 9121 Cell Signaling), Phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (Thr202/Tyr204) (No. 9106S, Cell Signaling), or Phospho-Akt (Ser473) (No. 9271S, Cell Signaling). Western blots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL (SuperSignal; Pierce) and quantified by phosphorimaging with a CH-screen (Bio-Rad). Transfected PC12 or BHK cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Indirect anti-Ras immunofluorescence using Y13–238 and FITC-coupled anti-rat secondary antisera was performed as described previously (10Apolloni A. Prior I.A. Lindsay M. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2475-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Coverslips were mounted in mowiol for confocal microscopy. Raf activity was measured in a coupled MEK/ERK assay with myelin basic protein phosphorylation as readout exactly as described (21Roy S. Lane A. Yan J. McPherson R. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cell membranes were resolved in bottom-loaded continuous sucrose gradients exactly as described (16Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar,22Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Transfected BHK cells were serum-starved for 6 h, harvested, and fractionated into S100 and P100 fractions. 400 μg of each P100 fraction was collected by centrifuging at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The membrane pellets were resuspended by sonication in 100 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm NaVO4), and after a 15-min incubation on ice, they were recentrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatants were discarded, and the new pellets were resuspended by sonication in 25 μl of 2× kinase buffer (40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 20 mm MgCl2). 25 μl of kinase mix (phosphatidylinositol, 200 μg/ml sonicated in 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 20 μm ATP, 200 μm adenosine, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol)) was added, and kinase reactions were carried out for 20 min at 25 °C in a vortexing heating block. Reactions were stopped with 100 μl of 1n HCl, and phospholipids were extracted once with 200 μl of CHCl3:MeOH (1:1) and once with 160 μl of 1n HCl:MeOH (1:1). Phosphorylated lipid products were resolved on oxalate-impregnated Silica60 plates (Merck) using CHCl3:MeOH:4 m NH4OH (9:7:2) as solvent and visualized and quantified by phosphorimaging with a BI screen (Bio-Rad). Cells were transfected, harvested, and fractionated as described above. Aliquots of P100 fraction were added to a dilution range of Triton X-100 in Buffer Q (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 25 mm KCl) to obtain a final concentration of 0, 0.05, 0.25, and 0.5% Triton X-100. The samples were then sonicated for 15 s, incubated on ice for 15 min, sonicated again for 10 s, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants were discarded, and the pellets were dissolved in sample buffer, resolved on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and immunoblotted for Ras. S100 and P100 fractions were prepared from COS cells transfected as described above. The P100 fractions were resuspended in 400 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), sonicated, and then spun at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min, and soluble supernatants were moved to new tubes. Protein content was measured by the Bradford reaction, and 120 μg of the sample was incubated with 1 ml of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm NaCl) and 20 μl of GST·RBD K85A fusion protein (50% suspension = 20 μg) for 90 min at 4 °C. For details, see Ref. 23Clyde-Smith J. Silins G. Gartside M. Grimmond S. Etheridge M. Apolloni A. Hayward N. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32260-32267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar. After washing three times with binding buffer, the final pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of 2× sample buffer, boiled, and loaded in 15% gels for Western blotting analysis using anti-Ras antibodies. 10 μg of the solubilized P100 fraction was also immunoblotted to normalize for total Ras content. After quantifying the immunoblots in a phosphorimaging device, GTP loading was estimated by calculating (RBD-bound Ras)/(total Ras present in 10 μg of solubilized P100 fraction). The phosphorimaging device units are arbitrary, but our previous comparisons of estimating GTP loading using the RBD pull-down assay with GTP loading measured by 32P labeling, Ras immunoprecipitation, and TLC have shown that 10 arbitrary units = ∼2% GTP-bound Ras. BHK cells were transfected with 10 μg of S17N-substituted plasmid plus 0.8 μg of pC1 (which carries a G418-selectable marker). After 5 h, medium containing 20% calf serum was added for 24 h, and then the transfected cells were split between eight 10-cm plates into medium containing 10% calf serum and 500 μg/ml G418. Cells were maintained for 16 days and then fixed with cold methanol and stained with 10% Geimsa's stain, and the colonies were counted. Our previous results showed that deletion of the entire linker domain of Ha-Ras (166) totally confines activated HΔhvrG12V to lipid rafts and partially abrogates the ability of HΔhvrG12V to activate Raf-1 (16Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). To further characterize the HVR linker domain, we constructed four additional mutants of this region. We deleted amino acids 166–172 or 173–179 from activated Ha-RasG12V, i.e. the N-terminal or C-terminal amino acids of the linker domain, to create the mutants HΔ1 and HΔ2, respectively (Fig. 1). In addition, we generated two alanine replacement mutants by substituting the amino acids 166–172 or 173–179 with an equivalent number of alanine residues to generate HΔ1ala and HΔ2ala (Fig. 1). The membrane-targeting domain of the HVR is left intact in all these constructs, and Fig. 1B shows that as expected, all of the Ha-Ras HVR-mutated proteins localized normally to the plasma membrane when expressed in BHK cells. We next examined the distribution of the Ha-Ras linker domain mutants between raft and non-raft membranes. Detergent-free lysates prepared from transiently transfected BHK cells were fractionated over sucrose gradients. 10 fractions were collected from the top to the bottom of each gradient, and the membranes contained in each fraction isolated by centrifugation. Membrane pellets were then analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-Ras antibodies. We have previously extensively characterized this gradient protocol and shown that lipid raft-enriched membranes are readily resolved from non-raft membranes (16Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 22Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Specifically, lipid raft markers are found in the top 5 fractions of the gradients, which contain light membranes, and non-raft markers are confined to the denser bottom 5 fractions (16Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 22Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In accordance with our previous results, more than 80% of activated Ha-RasG12V was present in the high density fractions (6Gutierrez L. Magee A.I. Marshall C.J. Hancock J.F. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1093-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 7Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J.

In contrast, the truncated proteins HΔ1-G12V and HΔ2-G12V and the alanine-substituted protein HΔ1ala-G12V fractionated almost exclusively to the lipid raft-enriched fractions (2Reuther G.W. Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 3Willumsen B.M. Christensen A. Hubbert N.L. Papageorge A.G. Lowy D.

A. 1989; 86: 8323-8327Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar) as seen previously for HΔhvrG12V (see Fig. 2 and Ref. 16Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, the distribution of the alanine-substituted protein HΔ2ala-G12V more closely resembled that of full-length Ha-RasG12V with a small peak in lipid raft fractions 2 and 3 and a more major peak in fractions 7–10. One interpretation of these results is that the whole Ha-Ras linker domain is required for correct lateral segregation, but although the specific amino acid sequence of 166–172 is critical, residues 173–179 may just operate as an essential spacer element, the specific sequence of which is not important. To characterize the potential biological implications of defective membrane micro-localization, we examined the ability of the HVR mutants to activate downstream effectors. Membrane (P100) fractions from BHK cells transiently transfected with full-length Ha-RasG12V or the HVR linker domain mutants were normalized for Ras content and assayed for Raf-1 activity using a coupled MEK-ERK assay. Fig.3, A and B, shows that the ability of HΔ1-G12V and HΔ2-G12V to activate Raf-1 was severely compromised compared with that of full-length Ha-RasG12V. The abrogation of activity was similar to that seen with HΔhvrG12V. The ability of HΔ1ala-G12V to activate Raf-1 was also compromised but not to the same extent as HΔ1-G12V, HΔ2-G12V, or HΔhvrG12V (Fig. 3,A and B). In contrast, the alanine replacement mutant HΔ2ala-G12V activated Raf-1 as efficiently as full-length Ha-RasG12V (Fig. 3, A and B). We next examined the levels of activated MEK and ERK in the S100 fractions of the same lysates by immunoblotting with phospho-specific antisera. Fig.3A shows that MEK phosphorylation was significantly compromised only in cells expressing HΔhvrG12V. Moreover, levels of phosphorylated ERK were essentially equivalent in all of the mutant-expressing cells. Thus recruitment of Raf to lipid rafts by mislocalized Ha-Ras compromises activation but also apparently interferes with the communication between Raf, MEK, and MAPK, perhaps by preventing appropriate negative feedback within the kinase cascade. Membrane fractions were then assayed for endogenous PI3K activity in anin vitro lipid kinase assay using phosphatidylinositol as substrate. Expression of HΔhvrG12V, HΔ1-G12V, and HΔ2-G12V failed to activate PI3K, whereas expression of HΔ2ala-G12V or full-length Ha-RasG12V generated substantial membrane-associated PI3K activity (Fig. 3, C and D). Expression of HΔ1ala-G12V generated low PI3K activity in the majority of our experiments (as shown in Fig. 3C), but in some experiments, higher levels of PI3K activity were detected. The reasons for this variability are unclear. To verify the results of the in vitro lipid kinase data, we therefore assessed the activation status of Akt in the same cell lysates by quantitative immunoblotting using phospho-specific antisera. Cells expressing HΔhvrG12V, HΔ1-G12V, HΔ2-G12V, or HΔ1ala-G12V had low levels of phosphorylated Akt both in cell membranes and in cytosol consistent with the profile of PI3K activation (Fig. 3E). HΔ2ala-G12V was the only mutant protein capable of activating Akt to the same extent as full-length Ha-RasG12V (Fig. 3E). To assess the biological activity of the Ha-RasG12V HVR linker domain mutants, the constructs were tagged with N-terminal GFP and transfected into PC12 cells. After 48 h, the cell cultures were fixed. The morphology of the cells was compared with cells expressing full-length Ha-RasG12V that undergo extensive neurite outgrowth and differentiation and cells expressing membrane-targeted GFP-tH that do not differentiate (GFP-tH consists of the C-terminal 10 amino acids of Ha-Ras cloned onto the C terminus of GFP) (Fig.4). To quantify the extent of differentiation, mean neurite length was calculated from a random sample of ∼50 cells expressing each Ha-Ras protein (Fig. 4). Cells expressing HΔhvrG12V, HΔ1-G12V, or HΔ2-G12V showed some enlargement of the cell body and in some cases the formation of very short neurite-like structures, but the extent of these changes and the complexity of the differentiation was markedly reduced compared with full-length Ha-RasG12V (Fig. 4). The alanine-substituted mutant HΔ1ala-G12V induced slightly more neurite outgrowth than the cognate-deletion mutant. However, only the differentiation induced by HΔ2ala-G12V resembled that observed with full-length Ha-RasG12V. It is clear that the profiles of PC12 differentiation observed in these experiments correlate closely with the biochemical and raft micro-localization data shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The simplest conclusion to be drawn from the preceding experiments is that preventing the access of activated Ha-Ras to the disordered plasma membrane blocks biological activity. An alternative interpretation is that the linker domain modulates raft association but also directly interacts with plasma membrane-localized Raf-1 and PI3K. We therefore used another mechanism to confine activated Ha-Ras to lipid rafts that did not involve mutating the HVR linker domain. We have previously shown that the addition of an N-myristoylation signal to Ha-RasG12V does not interfere with plasma membrane localization. However, sucrose gradient analysis showed that Mys-Ha-RasG12V is extensively localized to lipid rafts (Fig. 5A; compare with Fig. 2). Consistent with this observation, assays of raft association based on detergent insolubility showed that membrane-associated Mys-Ha-RasG12V was resistant to extraction in 0.05% Triton X-100, whereas 75% of Ha-RasG12V was solubilized (Fig.5B). Similar to the results obtained with the HVR mutants, raft-associated Mys-Ha-RasG12V was a weaker activator of Raf-1 than Ha-RasG12V (Fig. 5C). The S17N mutation results in a Ras protein that forms an irreversible complex with RasGEFs and renders RasS17N dominant negative for cell growth (24Feig L.A.

To elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of aceruloplasminemia, the biosynthesis of a missense mutant ceruloplasmin (P177R) occurring in an affected patient was examined. Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with cDNAs encoding secreted and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked wild-type or P177R human ceruloplasmin were examined by pulse-chase metabolic labeling. These experiments, as well as immunofluorescent analysis andN-linked glycosylation studies, indicate that both the secreted and GPI-linked forms of the P177R mutant are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The P177R mutation resides within a novel motif, which is repeated six times in human ceruloplasmin and is conserved in the homologous proteins hephaestin and factor VIII. Analysis of additional mutations in these motifs suggests a critical role for this region in ceruloplasmin trafficking and indicates that substitution of the arginine residue is critical to the ER retention of the P177R mutant. Metabolic labeling of transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells with 64Cu indicates that the P177R mutant is retained in the ER as an apoprotein and that copper is incorporated into both secreted and GPI-linked ceruloplasmin as a late event in the secretory pathway. Taken together, these studies reveal new insights into the determinants of holoceruloplasmin biosynthesis and indicate that aceruloplasminemia can result from retention of mutant ceruloplasmin within the early secretory pathway.

Pediatr. Res. 1998; 44: 271-276Google Scholar). This protein is synthesized in hepatocytes and secreted into the plasma as a holoprotein with six atoms of copper incorporated during biosynthesis. Although copper does not affect the rate of apoceruloplasmin synthesis or secretion, impairment of copper incorporation results in the secretion of an apoprotein that is devoid of enzymatic activity and rapidly degraded in the plasma (2Holtzman N.A. Gaumnitz B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 2350-2353Google Scholar, 3Gitlin J.D. Schroeder J.J. Lee-Ambrose L.M. Cousins R.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 835-839Google Scholar). Consistent with this concept, in patients with Wilson disease, the absence or dysfunction of a copper-transporting ATPase abrogates copper transfer into the secretory pathway, resulting in marked diminution in the serum concentration of ceruloplasmin (4Scheinberg I.H. Gitlin D. Science. 1952; 116: 484-485Google Scholar). Extrahepatic synthesis of human ceruloplasmin has been detected in several tissues, including the retina and brain (5Mollgard K. Dziegielewska K.M. Saunders N.R. Zakut H. Soreq H. Dev. Biol. 1988; 128: 207-221Google Scholar, 6Klomp L.W.J. Gitlin J.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1989-1996Google Scholar), and recent studies in rodents suggest that in brain and testis ceruloplasmin is synthesized as a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)1-anchored form via alternative RNA splicing (7Patel B.N. David S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20185-20190Google Scholar, 8Salzer J.L. Lovejoy L. Linder M.C. Rosen C. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 54: 147-157Google Scholar, 9Fortna R.R. Watson H.A. Nyquist S.E.

Ceruloplasmin is a member of the multicopper oxidase family of enzymes, which use the facile electron chemistry of the bound copper atoms to couple substrate oxidation to the four-electron reduction of dioxygen to water (11Messerschmidt A. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 341-352Google Scholar). Although ceruloplasmin can oxidize multiple substratesin vitro, recognition of an essential role for this protein as a ferroxidase came with the identification of patients with aceruloplasminemia (12Yoshida K. Furihata K. Takeda S. Nakamura A. Yamamoto K. Morita H. Hiyamuta S. Ikeda S. Shimizu N. Yanagisawa N. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 267-272Google Scholar, 13Harris Z.L. Takahashi Y. Miyajima H. Serizawa M.

In this disorder, affected individuals present with diabetes and neurodegeneration in association with parenchymal iron accumulation and absent serum ceruloplasmin attributable to inherited loss-of-function mutations in the ceruloplasmin gene. Studies in a murine model of aceruloplasminemia reveal an essential physiologic role for ceruloplasmin in determining the rate of iron efflux from cells with mobilizable iron stores (14Harris Z.L. Durley A.P. Man T.K. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10812-10817Google Scholar). The homologous multicopper oxidase hephaestin appears to play an analogous role in iron efflux from enterocytes (15Vulpe C.D. Kuo Y.M. Murphy T.L. Cowley L. Askwith C. Libina N. Gitschier J. Anderson G.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 195-199Google Scholar). Despite the critical importance of copper for ceruloplasmin function, little is known about the mechanisms of copper incorporation into this protein. Furthermore, although a GPI-linked form of ceruloplasmin has been identified in the rat, no information is available on the mechanisms of synthesis or copper incorporation into this isoform. Recent studies have revealed that the delivery of copper to specific proteins within the cell is mediated by a family of proteins termed copper chaperones (16O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25057-25060Google Scholar). Although it is clear that the atox1 chaperone plays a critical role in copper delivery to the secretory pathway of mammalian cells (17Hamza I. Faisst A. Prohaska J. Chen J. Gruss P. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6848-6852Google Scholar), the specific mechanisms of copper incorporation into any of the known copper proteins in the secretory pathway including ceruloplasmin remain unknown. In this current study, the identification of a missense mutation resulting in aceruloplasminemia provided the opportunity to investigate the molecular basis for ceruloplasmin deficiency in this disease and to use this mutation to elucidate the mechanisms of holoceruloplasmin biosynthesis. General chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma. DNA restriction and modifying enzymes were purchased from Promega and used according to the manufacturer's specifications. Hybridization membranes and ECL reagents were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Polyclonal rabbit antisera to human ceruloplasmin was purchased from Dako and has previously been shown to recognize ceruloplasmin from most mammalian species, including hamsters (18Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2681-2687Google Scholar). Monoclonal antisera to human protein disulfide isomerase was from StressGen. [35S]Methionine and [35S]Cysteine Translabel were purchased from ICN Radiochemicals. 64Cu (750 Ci/mmol) was obtained by fast neutron bombardment of a natural zinc target as described previously (19Connett J.M. Anderson C.J. Guo L.W. Schwarz S.W. Zinn K.R. Rogers B.E. Siegels B.A. Philpott G.W. Welch M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6814-6818Google Scholar). Molecular modeling of the P177R mutation was accomplished using the software program InSight (Accelrys) using the published x-ray crystallographic structure of human ceruloplasmin (20Zaitseva I. Zaitseva V. Card G. Moshkov K. Bax B. Ralph A. Lindley P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 15-23Google Scholar). Nucleotide and amino acid sequence alignments were accomplished using Vector NTI. The P177R mutation was identified by sequencing of genomic DNA from an affected patient with aceruloplasminemia. 2S. Kohno, H. Miyajima, and J. D. Gitlin, unpublished observations. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed in a pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) containing the entire human ceruloplasmin open reading frame (pcDNA3Cp) using Klentaq polymerase (CLONTECH), oligonucleotide primer pairs corresponding to the P177R, P177A, and P432R mutations, and 5′ sense and 3′ antisense oligonucleotides (21Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.T. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Google Scholar). The presence of specific mutations and the fidelity of the entire cDNA sequence were verified in each case by automated fluorescent sequencing (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A BLAST search of the human expressed sequence tag data base using the DNA sequence of exons 16–18 of human ceruloplasmin identified a candidate GPI-linked isoform (accession number BE065575) with considerable homology to the published sequence of rat GPI-linked ceruloplasmin (10Patel B.N. Dunn R.J. David S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4305-4310Google Scholar). The predicted coding sequence was amplified from a human brain cDNA library by polymerase chain reaction using 5′ (CACAGGGGAGTTTATAGTTCTGATGTCTTTGACA) and 3′ antisense (ACGTCTCGAGTCATTCCTTGGTAGATATTTGGAATAAAATAATC) oligonucleotides containing an added XhoI site (underlined). This polymerase chain reaction product was digested withPmlI and XhoI and subcloned into pcDNA3Cp, generating a full-length cDNA of the GPI-linked isoform. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and HepG2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in either Ham's F-12 (CHO) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (HepG2), each containing 10% fetal bovine serum and supplemented with glutamine and penicillin-streptomycin. Transient transfections were performed with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For indirect immunofluorescence, transfected CHO cells were plated on coverslips, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and quenched with 1 m ethanolamine. Cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 and analyzed with a 1:2000 dilution of anti-ceruloplasmin or a 1:200 dilution of anti-protein disulfide isomerase antisera as described previously (22Payne A. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10854-10859Google Scholar). In some experiments, cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 600 milliunits/ml phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a volume of 4 ml and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C to release GPI-anchored proteins. Forty-eight hours after transfection, CHO cells were pulse-labeled for 20 min with 60 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine and chased with serum-free Ham's F-12 medium for the indicated time points, followed by collection of media and lysate for immunoprecipitation as described previously (22Payne A. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10854-10859Google Scholar). In some experiments, the immunoprecipitate was eluted by boiling in the presence of 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.2% SDS, split into two aliquots, and incubated at 37 °C overnight in the presence or absence of 0.1 milliunits/μl endoglycosidase H (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Samples were subjected to 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and analyzed by PhosphorImager or exposure to Eastman Kodak Co. MR film. For64Cu metabolic labeling, 48 h after transfection cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, pulsed for 2 h with 300 μCi/ml 64Cu in serum-free Ham's F-12 medium, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and chased for 2 h with fresh serum-free Ham's F-12 medium containing 100-fold excess cold copper. Media were collected and concentrated using Centricon-30 columns (Millipore). Analysis of cell lysate and media for64Cu-labeled ceruloplasmin (holoceruloplasmin) was carried out as described previously (23Sato M. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5128-5134Google Scholar). Samples were electrophoresed in 4–20% Tris-HCl gradient gels without denaturation before loading and then analyzed by PhosphorImager. 35S and 64Cu pulse-chase analyses of HepG2 cells were carried out in an identical fashion with the exception that the pulse period for each was only 5 min. A cDNA encoding human ceruloplasmin was transfected into a series of mammalian cell lines followed by metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation. In transfected CHO cells, the kinetics of ceruloplasmin synthesis and secretion (Fig.1A) was found to be identical to that observed for endogenous ceruloplasmin in the hepatoma cell line HepG2 (23Sato M. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5128-5134Google Scholar). Using a polyclonal antisera known to recognize hamster ceruloplasmin, no endogenous ceruloplasmin synthesis was detected in these CHO cells (data not shown). Furthermore, incubation of transfected CHO cells with 64Cu revealed copper incorporation into ceruloplasmin equivalent to that observed in HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes (see Fig. 6). Taken together, these results suggested that transfected CHO cells could be used to investigate the mechanisms of serum ceruloplasmin deficiency resulting from the P177R missense mutation identified in an affected patient. Accordingly, a ceruloplasmin cDNA encoding this mutant was transfected into CHO cells, followed by pulse-chase analysis. These studies revealed marked intracellular accumulation of newly synthesized P177R ceruloplasmin with no apparent degradation or secretion of this mutant protein throughout the time course of the experiment (Fig.1A). Because ceruloplasmin is a secreted glycoprotein, the data in Fig. 1A suggest that the P177R mutant protein may be improperly trafficked within the secretory pathway of the cell.Figure 6Holoceruloplasmin biosynthesis in transfectedCHO cells.A, HepG2 cells (lanes 1 and7) or CHO cells transfected with vector (lanes 2and 8), the secreted (sec) form of wild-type ceruloplasmin (lanes 3 and 9), the secreted form of P177R ceruloplasmin (lanes 4 and 10), GPI-linked wild-type ceruloplasmin (lanes 5 and11), and GPI-linked P177R ceruloplasmin (lanes 6and 12) were incubated with media containing 300 μCi/ml64Cu for 2 h and chased for 2 h in fresh serum-free Ham's F-12 medium containing a 100-fold excess of cold copper. Lysate (IC; lanes 1–6) and media (EC; lanes 7–12) samples were then analyzed on 4–20% Tris-HCl gradient gels as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, CHO cells transfected with vector (lanes 1 and 6), the secreted form of wild-type ceruloplasmin (lanes 2 and 7), GPI-linked wild-type ceruloplasmin (lane 3), the secreted form of P177A ceruloplasmin (lanes 4 and 7), and GPI-linked P177A ceruloplasmin (lane 5) were incubated with media containing 300 μCi/ml 64Cu for 2 h and chased for 2 h, after which lysate (IC; lanes 1–5) and media (EC; lanes 6–8) were analyzed on 4–20% Tris-HCl gradient gels as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Recent studies in the rat have revealed that alternative splicing can result in the synthesis of ceruloplasmin as a plasma membrane-anchored GPI-linked isoform (10Patel B.N. Dunn R.J. David S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4305-4310Google Scholar). If a similar situation occurs in humans, the presence of a GPI-linked isoform would have important implications for our understanding of the biosynthesis and trafficking of ceruloplasmin as well as the effects of any patient mutations. To determine whether there is a GPI-linked isoform of human ceruloplasmin, a BLAST search of the human expressed sequence tag data base was performed. This approach identified a ceruloplasmin cDNA with a carboxyl terminus highly homologous to rat GPI-linked ceruloplasmin, and subsequent analysis of human genomic DNA revealed the presence of a separate downstream exon encoding this putative GPI-linked sequence (Fig. 1B). Analysis of RNA using a specific probe derived from this exon revealed that a transcript encoding this putative GPI-linked ceruloplasmin is expressed in a variety of human tissues in vivo (data not shown). To characterize this isoform of ceruloplasmin, a full-length cDNA was generated by polymerase chain reaction of a human brain library and transfected into CHO cells. Immunofluorescent analysis of transfected cells with and without prior permeabilization using anti-ceruloplasmin antisera revealed cell surface expression (Fig. 1C). Treatment of transfected cells with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C abrogated this staining, suggesting that the expressed ceruloplasmin was anchored to the plasma membrane via a GPI linkage. Pulse-chase analysis in transfected CHO cells revealed that the GPI-linked form of wild-type ceruloplasmin remained in the cellular fraction for the duration of the experiment, with the gradual appearance of a second higher molecular weight band corresponding to the mature, fully glycosylated membrane-anchored protein (Fig.1D). As anticipated, expression of the GPI-linked isoform of P177R ceruloplasmin revealed no secretion of this mutant into the media. However, the pattern of intracellular synthesis was distinct from that of the wild-type GPI-linked ceruloplasmin in that no higher molecular weight band was detected during the later part of the chase period (Fig. 1D). The biosynthetic data shown above suggest that the P177R mutation results in impaired trafficking of both the secreted and GPI-linked isoforms of ceruloplasmin. Previous studies have revealed that the secreted form of ceruloplasmin is modified by N-linked glycosylation during biosynthesis (23Sato M. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5128-5134Google Scholar). To determine whether GPI-linked ceruloplasmin is also modified in this fashion and to further examine the possibility of aberrant trafficking of the P177R mutant,N-linked glycosylation of ceruloplasmin was analyzed in CHO cells transfected with the GPI-linked form of either wild-type or P177R ceruloplasmin. Although in both cases an endoglycosidase H-sensitive form of ceruloplasmin was detected throughout the chase period, maturation to a higher molecular weight, endoglycosidase H-resistant form was observed only in the lysates from cells transfected with wild-type ceruloplasmin (Fig. 2). These data indicate that the GPI-linked form is modified byN-linked glycosylation, a modification that accounts at least in part for the higher molecular weight band observed in Fig.1D. Similar results with endoglycosidase H were obtained when these experiments were repeated using the wild-type and P177R-secreted isoforms of ceruloplasmin (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that trafficking of the P177R mutant is blocked before the modification of N-linked oligosaccharides in the cis- or medial-Golgi. To more directly assess the intracellular location of the P177R mutant, indirect immunofluorescence was performed in CHO cells transfected with the wild-type and P177R GPI-linked constructs. As noted previously, GPI-linked ceruloplasmin displays a staining pattern consistent with cell surface localization when transfected into CHO cells (Fig.3A). In contrast, the GPI-linked form of P177R ceruloplasmin is detected in an intracellular compartment, which colocalizes with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident protein disulfide isomerase (Fig. 3, B andC). Using these same methods, ER retention of P177R ceruloplasmin was also observed with the secreted isoform of this mutant, and this location was not altered for either mutant isoform after growth of transfected cells at 31 °C or pretreatment with the chemical chaperone glycerol (data not shown), conditions previously shown to rescue trafficking defects of other proteins within the secretory pathway (24Aridor M. Balch W.E. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 745-751Google Scholar). Further inspection of the amino acid sequence of human ceruloplasmin (25Takahashi N. Ortel T.L. Putnam F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 390-394Google Scholar) revealed that the P177R mutation resides within a five-amino acid motif G(FLI)(LI)GP, which is repeated six times throughout the protein (Fig. 4A). This motif is also present and repeated in the homologous multicopper oxidase hephaestin as well as coagulation factor VIII (Fig. 4B). Of interest, an analogous proline to arginine mutation in this motif has been identified in the factor VIII gene in a patient with hemophilia A and undetectable serum factor VIII (26Antonarakis S.E. Kazazian H.H. Tuddenham E.G.D. Hum. Mutat. 1995; 5: 1-22Google Scholar), suggesting a possible role for this motif in protein structure (Fig. 4B). Consistent with this possibility, structural modeling reveals that in wild-type ceruloplasmin, proline 177 projects into a tightly packed hydrophobic pocket, closely surrounded by the nonpolar residues Leu74, Ile77, Ile159, Val199, and Phe267 (Fig. 4C). These data suggest that the repeat G(FLI)(LI)GP motif may be critical for proper folding and subsequent trafficking of human ceruloplasmin. To further examine this hypothesis, site-directed mutagenesis was used to create an analogous proline to arginine mutation in the third motif, resulting in a P432R mutant ceruloplasmin (Fig. 4A). Pulse-chase analysis of CHO cells transfected with the secreted isoform of P432R ceruloplasmin revealed a pattern of synthesis nearly identical to that seen for the P177R mutation, with little or no intracellular degradation or secretion during the chase period (Fig.5). Similar results were obtained using the GPI-linked isoform, and additional experiments with both isoforms revealed that the P432R mutant is also retained in the ER (data not shown). The aberrant trafficking observed with the P177R and P432R mutations could result either from loss of the conserved proline residue or from insertion of the arginine residue. To distinguish between these possibilities, a P177A ceruloplasmin was generated and expressed in CHO cells. As can be observed in Fig. 5, the P177A mutation does not impair the biosynthesis or secretion of ceruloplasmin under these conditions, suggesting that the ER retention of the arginine-substituted mutants may primarily result from introducing a polar, basic guanidino moiety into a highly hydrophobic environment, leading to protein misfolding. The retention of the P177R mutant in the ER provides the opportunity to examine the effect of this mislocalization on copper incorporation into ceruloplasmin. To accomplish this, transfected CHO cells were metabolically labeled with 64Cu followed by detection of copper-labeled ceruloplasmin in the cell lysate and media. Using this method, an 85-kDa band corresponding to holoceruloplasmin was detected in cell lysate and media of 64Cu labeled HepG2 cells (Fig.6A, lanes 1 and7). The apparent size difference of ceruloplasmin observed here (85 versus 132 kDa) is consistent with previous data and reflects increased mobility of the holoprotein under these gel conditions (23Sato M. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5128-5134Google Scholar). Under these same conditions, no copper-labeled bands were observed in lysate or media from CHO cells transfected with vector alone (Fig. 6A, lanes 2 and 8). Both secreted and GPI-linked holoceruloplasmin were detected in the cellular lysates of transfected CHO cells (Fig. 6A, lanes 3 and 5), and the secreted form was also detectable in the media (Fig. 6A, lane 9). The apparent slight increase in molecular weight of GPI-linked holoceruloplasmin compared with secreted holoceruloplasmin is consistent with previous observations on rat GPI-linked ceruloplasmin (10Patel B.N. Dunn R.J. David S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4305-4310Google Scholar) and presumably reflects the addition of the GPI anchor to this isoform. In each case, the copper-labeled ceruloplasmin observed in CHO cells transfected with wild-type ceruloplasmin was similar to that observed for endogenous ceruloplasmin in HepG2 cells. In contrast, during this same period of64Cu labeling, neither secreted nor GPI-linked holoceruloplasmin was detected in cell lysate or media from CHO cells transfected with the P177R mutant (Fig. 6A, lanes 4, 6, 10, and 12). Examination of the P177A mutation using these same methods revealed copper incorporation into ceruloplasmin comparable with that observed with wild-type ceruloplasmin, a finding consistent with the normal kinetics of synthesis and secretion of this mutant observed in the pulse-chase studies (Fig. 6B). Taken together, the results of the copper-labeling experiments suggest that copper is incorporated into both the secreted and GPI-linked isoforms of ceruloplasmin and that this occurs either in the secretory pathway beyond the ER or within the ER after protein folding. To distinguish between these two possibilities, endogenous ceruloplasmin biosynthesis and secretion were examined in HepG2 cells metabolically labeled with either [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine or 64Cu. This analysis revealed that although newly synthesized 35S-labeled ceruloplasmin appears in the media within ∼30 min, 64Cu-labeled ceruloplasmin is detectable under these same conditions within the first 5 min of the experiment, indicating that copper incorporation into ceruloplasmin occurs as a late event within the secretory pathway. Although more than a dozen unique mutations have been identified in the ceruloplasmin gene in patients with aceruloplasminemia, the majority of these are insertions or deletions predicted to result in a frameshift or termination (1Gitlin J.D. Pediatr. Res. 1998; 44: 271-276Google Scholar). This current study reports the first functional analysis of a missense mutation in aceruloplasminemia. The kinetics of synthesis, secretion, and copper incorporation into ceruloplasmin in transfected CHO cells (Figs. 1 and 6) are similar to those observed for endogenous ceruloplasmin in hepatocytes and glia (23Sato M. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5128-5134Google Scholar, 27Klomp L.W. Farhangrazi Z.S. Dugan L.L. Gitlin J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 207-215Google Scholar), a finding that supports the validity of this experimental system. In this regard, the finding that both secreted and GPI-linked P177R ceruloplasmin are retained in the ER of transfected CHO cells (Figs. 2 and 3) is consistent with the clinical observation of absent serum ceruloplasmin and ferroxidase activity in an affected individual with this mutation.2 Although in vivo the Wilson ATPase is required for copper incorporation into ceruloplasmin in hepatocytes, previous studies have revealed that CHO cells express the Menkes ATPase (28Camakaris J. Petris M.J. Bailey L. Shen P. Lockhart P. Glover T.W. Barcroft C. Patton J. Mercer J.F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2117-2123Google Scholar). Because copper is incorporated into ceruloplasmin in transfected CHO cells (Figs. 6 and 7), these data support the concept that these ATPases use common biochemical mechanisms to effect cellular copper homeostasis (22Payne A. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10854-10859Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of the rat ceruloplasmin gene results in a GPI-linked ceruloplasmin isoform abundantly expressed in the central nervous system (10Patel B.N. Dunn R.J. David S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4305-4310Google Scholar). The data in this current study reveal that a human GPI-linked ceruloplasmin isoform arises from splicing of a previously unidentified downstream exon (Fig. 1). This finding is of importance for mutation screening of affected patients and raises the possibility that if the GPI-linked isoform is critical for iron homeostasis in the human brain, individuals may be identified with the phenotype of aceruloplasminemia and normal serum ceruloplasmin. Although no GPI-linked ceruloplasmin was detected in the media of transfected CHO cells (Fig. 1), cleavage of the plasma membrane GPI anchor can result in secretion of GPI-linked proteins (29Muniz M. Riezman H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 10-15Google Scholar), raising the possibility that ceruloplasmin secretion observed previously in glial cells (27Klomp L.W. Farhangrazi Z.S. Dugan L.L. Gitlin J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 207-215Google Scholar) may result from GPI cleavage. Because these data clearly reveal ER retention of both the secreted and GPI-linked P177R ceruloplasmin in transfected CHO cells (Figs. 1 and 2), further studies will be warranted to identify the sites of expression of human GPI-linked ceruloplasmin and to define the precise role of this isoform in iron homeostasis. Although the copper transport ATPases required for copper delivery to the secretory pathway are localized to the trans-Golgi network, the precise location within this pathway of copper incorporation into ceruloplasmin is unknown (1Gitlin J.D. Pediatr. Res. 1998; 44: 271-276Google Scholar). Because the P177R mutation does not involve any of the six copper binding sites in ceruloplasmin, the lack of copper incorporation into this ER-retained mutant (Fig. 6) suggests that retrograde transport of copper to the ER does not occur. Such a finding is consistent with observations that retention of tyrosinase in the ER of melanoma cells abrogates copper incorporation into this protein (30Petrescu S.M. Petrescu A.J. Titu H.N. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15796-15803Google Scholar) and that copper incorporation into Fet3, the yeast homologue of ceruloplasmin, occurs in a late compartment of the secretory pathway (31Yuan D.S. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25787-25793Google Scholar). An important caveat to this conclusion is that the P177R mutant may be incapable of binding copper regardless of cellular location as a result of misfolding. Although this possibility could not be directly tested in these studies, further kinetic analysis of copper incorporation into newly synthesized ceruloplasmin in HepG2 cells also suggests that this process occurs only at a point very late in the secretory pathway, immediately before secretion or membrane anchoring (Fig. 7). These metabolic studies accurately reflect newly synthesized holoceruloplasmin, because previous studies have shown that no copper is incorporated into previously synthesized apoceruloplasmin (23Sato M. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5128-5134Google Scholar). The observation that GPI-linked ceruloplasmin also incorporates copper is consistent with studies demonstrating oxidase activity of this isoform in the rat (7Patel B.N. David S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20185-20190Google Scholar,9Fortna R.R. Watson H.A. Nyquist S.E. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 1042-1049Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent studies revealed that GPI-anchored proteins are sorted from other proteins within the ER early in the secretory pathway (32Muniz M. Morsomme P. Riezman H. Cell. 2001; 104: 313-320Google Scholar). Because copper incorporation into both the secreted and GPI-linked isoforms occurs at a point late in the secretory pathway, these data suggest that each isoform may be trafficked to a common compartment for copper incorporation. The ER plays an essential role in the folding and maturation of newly synthesized proteins in the secretory pathway through the activity of numerous soluble and membrane-bound enzymes and chaperones (33Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 431-437Google Scholar). The G(FLI)(LI)GP motif identified in this study may play a role in packing of hydrophobic side chains and protein folding and assembly in the ER, perhaps via direct interactions with chaperones. Such a role is supported by the finding of ER retention of the P432R mutant (Fig. 5) as well as identification of this same mutation in a nonsecretory mutant of factor VIII. Regardless of the mechanisms, the data in this study indicate that aceruloplasminemia should be added to the list of human diseases that can result from the retention of a mutant protein within the ER (24Aridor M. Balch W.E. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 745-751Google Scholar). Neither decreased temperature nor chemical chaperones stimulated movement of P177R ceruloplasmin from the ER, and no appreciable degradation of this mutant protein was observed during the chase periods examined (Fig. 1). These data raise the possibility that ER accumulation of mutant ceruloplasmin may contribute to neuronal cytotoxicity in aceruloplasminemia either through activation of ER stress pathways, as observed in Perlizaues-Merzbacher disease (34Gow A. Lazzarini R.A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 422-428Google Scholar) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (35De Jonghe P. Timmerman V. Nelis E. Martin J. Van Broeckhoven C. J. Peripher. Nerv. Syst. 1997; 2: 370-387Google Scholar), or via protein aggregation, as seen in a number of sporadic and inherited neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion-mediated encephalopathies (36Kopito R.R. Ron D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 207-209Google Scholar). Further neuropathological studies in aceruloplasminemic patients with specific genotypes will be useful in addressing this issue and may provide for novel therapeutic approaches to modulating ER protein export or degradation in this disease.

Considering the preferential partitioning of⋅NO in apolar milieu (6–8 for n-octanol:water) and therefore a larger ⋅NO concentration in LDL with respect to the aqueous phase, a corrected kNO value of ∼0.2 × 1010m−1s−1 can be determined, which still is sufficiently large and consistent with a facile diffusion of ⋅NO through LDL. Applying the Einstein-Smoluchowsky treatment, the apparent diffusion coefficient (D′NO) of⋅NO in native LDL is on average 2 × 10−5cm2 s−1, six times larger than that previously reported for erythrocyte plasma membrane.

Low density lipoprotein (LDL)1 is the major vehicle for cholesterol transport in human plasma and, in a modified-oxidized form, serves as the major source of cholesteryl ester deposited in atheroma (3Goldstein J.L.

Indeed, oxidized LDL becomes suitable for uptake by macrophages through the scavenger-receptor pathway, promoting the formation of cholesteryl ester-containing foam cells, one of the initial events in atheroma formation (5Goldstein J.L.

Prassl R. Nigon F. Chapman M.J. Laggner P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2509-2513Google Scholar, 11Orlova E.V. Sherman M.B. Chiu W. Mowri H. Smith L.C. Gotto Jr., A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8420-8425Google Scholar). LDL is ∼22 nm in diameter and contains 42% cholesteryl ester, 6% triglyceride, 8% cholesterol, 22% phospholipid, and 22% apoB-100 by weight. Thus, each LDL particle would contain about 1600 molecules of cholesteryl ester, 170 of triglyceride, 700 of phospholipid, and 600 molecules of free cholesterol (12Esterbauer H. Gebicki J. Puhl H. Jurgens G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1992; 13: 341-390Google Scholar). About 50% of esterified fatty acids in the different lipid classes of LDL are polyunsaturated (12Esterbauer H. Gebicki J. Puhl H. Jurgens G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1992; 13: 341-390Google Scholar), an important attribute considering the sensitivity of these species to oxidative reactions in the lipoprotein particle. Cholesteryl esters are the most abundant lipid class in LDL, with cholesteryl linoleate being the principal oxidizable lipid in the hydrophobic core of LDL (12Esterbauer H. Gebicki J. Puhl H. Jurgens G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1992; 13: 341-390Google Scholar).Human LDL contains a number of antioxidants that inhibit lipid oxidation, with α-tocopherol the most abundant (∼6 α-tocopherol molecules per LDL particle), and other antioxidants (e.g.carotenoids, ubiquinol-10) present in much lower abundance (12Esterbauer H. Gebicki J. Puhl H. Jurgens G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1992; 13: 341-390Google Scholar). α-Tocopherol, localized at the surface of the LDL particle, provides minimal protection to lipid components in the hydrophobic core of LDL. Indeed, the principal oxidizable lipid, cholesteryl linoleate, is localized in the core of the lipoprotein, away from the more polar tocopherols (13Fielding C.J. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 1624-1628Google Scholar, 14Thomas J.P. Kalyanaraman B. Girotti A.W. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 244-254Google Scholar, 15Kenar J.A. Havrilla C.M. Porter N.A. Guyton J.R.

Nitric oxide has multiple physicochemical qualities that make it a potentially more effective lipid antioxidant than α-tocopherol. Nitric oxide (a) readily crosses cell membranes and concentrates in lipophilic milieu by virtue of its uncharged character, low molecular mass, and relatively high lipid/water partition coefficient (n-octanol:water partition coefficient of 6–8:1) (22Malinski T. Taha Z. Grunfeld S. Patton S. Kapturczak M. Tomboulian P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 1076-1082Google Scholar, 23Denicola A. Souza J.M. Radi R. Lissi E. Arch. Biochem.

Thus, by virtue of its high reactivity with lipid radical species, ⋅NO can spare lipophilic antioxidants (e.g. α-tocopherol) from oxidation (27Rubbo H. Radi R. Anselmi D. Kirk M. Barnes S. Butler J.

Nature. 1980; 288: 373-376Google Scholar) and its diffusion into LDL can represent a key antioxidant mechanism, by acting in the hydrophobic core of LDL where the ratio of oxidizable lipids to endogenous antioxidants is much greater than at the LDL particle surface. The present work supports these concepts by revealing the diffusion of ⋅NO into the surface and the core of LDL via fluorescence quenching of pyrene derivatives incorporated at different depths of the lipoprotein.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe structures of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic pyrene derivatives are shown in Fig. 1. The characteristic fine structure of the emission spectra of these pyrene derivatives in solution (Fig.2A) is less defined once they are incorporated into the lipid environment of the LDL and an increase in the emission at 396 nm is observed (Fig. 2B). The fluorescence spectra of PMTMA and PMChO in oxidized LDL were the same as in native LDL (not shown). The selected pyrene probes were chosen so that they could be incorporated at different depths of the LDL particle, with the pyrene moiety responsible for fluorescence emission being effectively quenched by ⋅NO. Pyrene is readily solubilized by membranes and located in the hydrocarbon core of the lipid bilayer (32Sepulveda P. Gallardo S. Lissi E.A. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1992; 152: 104-113Google Scholar). A strongly cationic derivative like PMTMA is expected to be adsorbed only at the surface of LDL, a microenvironment rich in negatively charged phospholipids. The PMChO derivative is expected to penetrate to the hydrophobic core of LDL due to a structure analogous to esterified cholesterol. The degree of penetration of different pyrene derivatives into membranes has been characterized by proton and carbon NMR (35Gratzel M. Kalyanasundaram K. Thomas J.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1974; 967869Google Scholar) and susceptibility to quenching by highly hydrophilic quenchers (36Lissi E.A. Caceres T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1989; 21: 375-385Google Scholar). Herein we observed that both probes incorporated into LDL were significantly protected from deactivation by iodide and tryptophan (water soluble quenchers), and that the resistance of PMChO to quenching by water-soluble species is at least 10-fold greater than for PMTMA (Table I, n-LDL column). If theKSV values of Table I are converted tokNO (Equation 3) using τo reported in Table II, the relative tendencies of hydrophilic and hydrophobic pyrene probe deactivation have even greater differences. These results indicate a differential distribution of the two probes in LDL and confirm that PMChO is located deeper into the LDL structure.Figure 2Emission spectra of PMTMA.

Open table in a new tab The half-lives obtained from the exponential fluorescence decay of the excited pyrene derivatives in different environments including native (n-LDL) and oxidized LDL (ox-LDL), are summarized on Table II. The fluorescence lifetime of PMChO in both native and oxidized LDL was greater than for the corresponding τ0 for PMTMA (2.5-fold). This agrees with previous results showing that the undecyl derivative analog (PUTMA) had a 2-fold greater half-time than PMTMA in biomembranes (23Denicola A. Souza J.M. Radi R. Lissi E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 208-212Google Scholar). Since the lifetime of the probe is sensitive to the polarity changes of its surroundings, this result also supports a differential location of the two pyrene derivatives, with PMChO being situated in a more hydrophobic environment than PMTMA.Fig. 3 shows Stern-Volmer plots for PMTMA and PMChO fluorescence quenching by ⋅NO following probe incorporation into native and oxidized LDL. From the slope of these lines (KSV) the kNOvalues were calculated and are collected in Table II. Also, data taken from our previous work using PMTMA incorporated into erythrocyte plasma membranes is included for comparative purposes (23Denicola A. Souza J.M. Radi R. Lissi E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 208-212Google Scholar).Figure 3Stern-Volmer plots for the fluorescence quenching of pyrene derivatives by ⋅NO.

The slopes of these plots are summarized in Table II asKSV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)These results (Table II, Fig. 3) reveal critical features of the interaction of ⋅NO with the LDL particle. First, ⋅NO is capable of quenching fluorescence of pyrene derivatives located both at the hydrophilic surface and the hydrophobic core of LDL, indicating that ⋅NO can diffuse through and into the LDL particle. Second, we found that ⋅NO diffusion readily occurs in both native and oxidized LDL.To further investigate the diffusion of ⋅NO into LDL, PMChO-containing LDL was exposed to a ⋅NO flux generated from the decomposition of the NOC-7 (t½∼30 min under our experimental conditions). There was a concentration and time-dependent quenching of PMChO fluorescence from NOC-7 (Fig. 4), in agreement with the access of increasing concentrations of ⋅NO into the hydrophobic core of LDL.Figure 4Time course of pyrene fluorescence quenching in LDL exposed to a flux of ⋅NO. PMChO-containing LDL (0.03 mg/ml) was exposed to 1.9 or 3.8 mm NOC-7 (corresponding to a ⋅NO flux of 1.5 and 2.9 μm/s, respectively) under anaerobic conditions in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Fluorescence intensity (λex = 337 nm, λem = 396 nm) was recorded over time and expressed as a percentage of control fluorescence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Considering LDL a more viscous environment than that of aqueous solutions, one would expect a slower diffusion of ⋅NO through the particle; however, the apparent quenching rate constants (kNO) obtained in LDL are large (1.2–2.5 × 1010m−1 s−1), with values approximating those for quenching in solution. However, an important consideration is that the x axis values in Fig. 3refer to the ⋅NO concentration in the aqueous phase and it should be noted that ⋅NO will partition into the lipid phase (37Liu X. Miller M.J. Joshi M.S. Thomas D.D. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2175-2179Google Scholar), resulting in an increased concentration of quencher in the region surrounding the fluorophore. While the partition coefficient of⋅NO in LDL is not known, a good estimate can be adapted from knowledge of ⋅NO partitioning into non-polar solvents, being 6–8 in n-octanol:water (38Malinski T. Radomski M.W. Taha Z. Moncada S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 960-965Google Scholar). Importantly, even when considering a ⋅NO concentration in LDL six times greater than in the aqueous phase, corrected kNO values would be as high as 0.2–0.4 × 1010m−1 s−1, indicating that LDL offers no significant barrier to the diffusion of ⋅NO. In addition, similar kNO values for PMTMA and PMChO were obtained for LDL, confirming that ⋅NO can easily diffuse to the hydrophobic core of LDL as well.The determination of the exact diffusion coefficients of ⋅NO in the surface and core of LDL is precluded by the lack of knowledge of the actual concentration of ⋅NO in the lipophilic environments where the bimolecular quenching process occurs. However, apparent diffusion coefficients (D′NO) can be estimated using the Einstein-Smoluchowsky equation according to previously (23Denicola A. Souza J.M. Radi R. Lissi E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 208-212Google Scholar),DNO′=kNO×1034πRNEquation 4 where R is the sum of the molecular radii of the probe plus ⋅NO (i.e. 6.9 × 10−8 cm and 9.1 × 10−8 cm for PMTMA and PMChO plus ⋅NO, respectively) and N Avogadro's number. The apparent diffusion coefficients of ⋅NO in native LDL from this approach were 2.3 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 in the surface and 1.7 × 10−5 cm2s−1 in the hydrophobic core of LDL, i.e.2.0 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 on average, half of the value obtained for ⋅NO in aqueous buffers (23Denicola A. Souza J.M. Radi R. Lissi E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 208-212Google Scholar), whereas the D′NO in erythrocyte plasma membrane is six times less (Table II). This result indicates that diffusibility of ⋅NO in LDL exceeds that of biomembranes.Nitric oxide induced ∼2-fold greater pyrene derivative quenching for oxidized LDL, compared with native LDL (Fig. 3 and Table II), possibly due to oxidative modification of the lipoprotein rendering a more open structure that exposes the fluorescent probe to the solvent. This hypothesis is supported by the much larger quenching of pyrene fluorescence in oxidized LDL by the water-soluble quenchers iodide and tryptophan in oxidized LDL (Table I).The concentrations of ⋅NO in the subendothelium of small arterioles have been estimated in the range of 250–500 nm(reviewed in Ref. 39Buerk D.G. Annu. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 2001; 3: 109-143Google Scholar), and these concentrations seem to be more than sufficient to exert antioxidant actions in LDL (17Rubbo H. Parthasarathy S. Barnes S. Kirk M. Kalyanaraman B. Freeman B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 324: 15-25Google Scholar, 40Trostchansky A. Batthyány C. Botti H. Radi R. Denicola A. Rubbo H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 395: 225-232Google Scholar). The fact that⋅NO can readily diffuse to native, as well as oxidized LDL (Fig.3) makes, at a first glance, less likely the possibility that LDL oxidation may be promoted by a poor diffusion of ⋅NO toward sites of ongoing lipid oxidation. Indeed, an impairment of⋅NO-mediated antioxidant actions within LDL may be primarily related to a deficit of ⋅NO bioavailability, which may in turn be due to decreased production or alternative reactions with radical species (e.g. superoxide (O⨪2), lipid, and protein radicals) (17Rubbo H.

Enhanced O⨪2 production by vascular cells has been observed under pathophysiologically-relevant stimuli (e.g. angiotensin II, altered hemodynamic forces) (44Wattanapitayakul S.K. Weinstein D.M.

In the latter case, not only ⋅NO would be less capable of diffusing into LDL by virtue of its accelerated consumption, but it may be transformed into peroxynitrite (ONOO−), an oxidant capable of initiating LDL oxidation (8Guy R.A. Maguire G.F. Crandall I. Connelly P.W. Kain K.C. Atherosclerosis. 2001; 155: 19-28Google Scholar, 44Wattanapitayakul S.K. Weinstein D.M. Holycross B.J. Bauer J.A.

However, it is important to recognize that there is heterogeneity in the size and fatty acid composition of LDL among individuals and there may be scenarios under which small decreases in ⋅NO diffusion maintained over long periods of time might facilitate the initiation of oxidation processes. In this context, the diffusion of ⋅NO to the small (<25 nm diameter) and dense LDL particles versusthat of the more common, large and buoyant ones that may have different proatherogenic potential (50Mykkanen L.

Assoc. 2001; 286: 1468-1474Google Scholar) should be studied. Additionally, the influence of fatty acids that diminish atherogenic risk (i.e. fatty acids contained in oil fish) (52Lancet. 1999; 354: 447-455Google Scholar, 53Lopez D. Caballero C. Sanchez J. Puig-Parellada P. Mitjavila M.T. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2001; 280: H2929-2935Google Scholar) on⋅NO diffusion in LDL needs to be addressed. These considerations may help to better define the role of LDL structure and composition and its interactions with ⋅NO in the inhibition/promotion of atherogenesis.In summary, our work reveals that ⋅NO readily diffuses to the hydrophilic surface and hydrophobic core of LDL, supporting the concept that ⋅NO can serve as an antioxidant in the vascular compartment, thus protecting LDL from oxidation and accounting for one component of the anti-atherogenic actions of ⋅NO. Lipid accumulation in the vascular wall is a characteristic feature of the early pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, with associated lipoprotein oxidation representing a critical component of endothelial dysfunction and foam cell formation (1Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.C. Witztum J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 915-924Google Scholar, 2Chisolm G.M. Steinberg D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1815-1826Google Scholar). Low density lipoprotein (LDL)1 is the major vehicle for cholesterol transport in human plasma and, in a modified-oxidized form, serves as the major source of cholesteryl ester deposited in atheroma (3Goldstein J.L. Hazzard W.R. Schrott H.G. Bierman E.L. Motulsky A.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 1533-1543Google Scholar, 4Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20963-20966Google Scholar). Indeed, oxidized LDL becomes suitable for uptake by macrophages through the scavenger-receptor pathway, promoting the formation of cholesteryl ester-containing foam cells, one of the initial events in atheroma formation (5Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1839-1848Google Scholar, 6Brown M.S. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 9163-9169Google Scholar). The LDL particle (∼2.5 MDa) consists of an apolar core of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides, surrounded by a monolayer of phospholipids, unesterified cholesterol, and one molecule of apolipoprotein B-100 (4,536 amino acids, 550 kDa) (10Schuster B. Prassl R. Nigon F. Chapman M.J. Laggner P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2509-2513Google Scholar, 11Orlova E.V. Sherman M.B. Chiu W. Mowri H. Smith L.C. Gotto Jr., A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8420-8425Google Scholar). LDL is ∼22 nm in diameter and contains 42% cholesteryl ester, 6% triglyceride, 8% cholesterol, 22% phospholipid, and 22% apoB-100 by weight. Thus, each LDL particle would contain about 1600 molecules of cholesteryl ester, 170 of triglyceride, 700 of phospholipid, and 600 molecules of free cholesterol (12Esterbauer H. Gebicki J. Puhl H. Jurgens G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1992; 13: 341-390Google Scholar). About 50% of esterified fatty acids in the different lipid classes of LDL are polyunsaturated (12Esterbauer H. Gebicki J. Puhl H. Jurgens G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1992; 13: 341-390Google Scholar), an important attribute considering the sensitivity of these species to oxidative reactions in the lipoprotein particle. Cholesteryl esters are the most abundant lipid class in LDL, with cholesteryl linoleate being the principal oxidizable lipid in the hydrophobic core of LDL (12Esterbauer H. Gebicki J. Puhl H. Jurgens G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1992; 13: 341-390Google Scholar). Human LDL contains a number of antioxidants that inhibit lipid oxidation, with α-tocopherol the most abundant (∼6 α-tocopherol molecules per LDL particle), and other antioxidants (e.g.carotenoids, ubiquinol-10) present in much lower abundance (12Esterbauer H. Gebicki J. Puhl H. Jurgens G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1992; 13: 341-390Google Scholar). α-Tocopherol, localized at the surface of the LDL particle, provides minimal protection to lipid components in the hydrophobic core of LDL. Indeed, the principal oxidizable lipid, cholesteryl linoleate, is localized in the core of the lipoprotein, away from the more polar tocopherols (13Fielding C.J. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 1624-1628Google Scholar, 14Thomas J.P. Kalyanaraman B. Girotti A.W. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 244-254Google Scholar, 15Kenar J.A. Havrilla C.M. Porter N.A. Guyton J.R.

Low density lipoprotein oxidation is inhibited by both chemically and cell-derived nitric oxide (⋅NO) (17Rubbo H. Parthasarathy S. Barnes S. Kirk M. Kalyanaraman B. Freeman B.A. Arch. Biochem.

We have investigated the comparative role of these two glycosaminoglycans in the activation of Met by hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor. Using glycosaminoglycan-deficient CHOpgsA-745 cells we have shown that growth factor activity is critically dependent upon glycosaminoglycans, and that heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate are equally potent as co-receptors. Cross-linked 1:1 conjugates of growth factor and either heparan or dermatan sulfate do not dimerize under physiological conditions and are biologically active. This implies that a ternary signaling complex with Met formsin vivo. Native Met isolated from CHO pgsA-745 cells shows only very weak intrinsic affinity for heparin in vitro. Also, a heparin-derived hexasaccharide, which is the minimal size for high affinity binding to the growth factor alone, is sufficient to induce biological activity. Together these observations imply that the role of these glycosaminoglycan may be primarily to effect a conformational change in hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor, rather than to induce a necessary growth factor dimerization, or to stabilize a ternary complex by additionally interacting with Met.

Goode J.A. Plasminogen-related Growth Factors: Ciba Foundation Symposium 212. John Wiley, Chichester, UK1997Google Scholar). Some stromal cells are also now known to be responsive to HGF/SF (2Delehedde M. Sergeant N. Lyon M. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 269: 4423-4429Google Scholar). Activation of its specific tyrosine kinase receptor, Met, elicits a diverse range of cellular activities, including proliferation, motility, morphogenesis, and protection from apoptosis (for review, see Ref. 1Bock G.R. Goode J.A. Plasminogen-related Growth Factors: Ciba Foundation Symposium 212. John Wiley, Chichester, UK1997Google Scholar). HGF/SF is considered to be an important mediator of mesenchymal-epithelial interactions during organogenesis, as well as in any subsequent organ repair. Developmental studies have identified the essential role of the HGF/SF-Met system in the formation of the liver (3Schmidt C. Bladt F. Goedecke S. Brinkmann V. Zschiesche W. Sharpe M. Gherardi E. Birchmeier C. Nature. 1995; 373: 699-702Google Scholar) and placenta (4Uehara Y. Minowa O. Mori C. Shiota K. Kuno J. Noda T. Kitamura N. Nature. 1995; 373: 702-705Google Scholar), as well as in the migration of both motor neurons (5Ebens A. Brose K. Leonardo E.D. Hanson Jr., M.G. Bladt F. Birchmeier C. Barres B.A. Tessier-Lavigne M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1157-1172Google Scholar) and myogenic precursors (6Bladt F. Riethmacher D. Isenmann S. Aguzzi A. Birchmeier C. Nature. 1995; 376: 768-771Google Scholar). There is also increasing evidence of an involvement of HGF/SF-Met in the growth, invasiveness, and metastasis of both carcinomas and sarcomas (for review, see Ref. 7Jeffers M. Rong S. Vande Woude G.F. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 505-513Google Scholar). Overexpression of wild-type Met and/or HGF/SF, sometimes involving the induction of an autocrine stimulatory loop, is common in cancer tissues. In a minority of cases there is evidence for mutations of Met leading to a dysregulated activity, although these often still remain ligand-dependent (8Michieli P. Basilico C. Pennacchietti S. Maffe A. Tamagnone L. Giordano S. Bardelli A. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5221-5231Google Scholar). Inhibition of Met activity may thus be beneficial in cancer treatment (9Trusolino L. Pugliese L. Comoglio P.M. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1267-1280Google Scholar). Moreover, HGF/SF is itself considered to have considerable therapeutic potential in wound healing and specific organ regeneration after disease, damage, or surgery (10Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Kidney Int. 2001; 59: 2023-2038Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence of a role for glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)/proteoglycans in HGF/SF activity, as suggested to varying degrees for a number of growth factors/cytokines (for review, see Ref.11Gallagher J.T. Lyon M. Iozzo R.V. Proteoglycans: Structure, Biology and Molecular Interactions. Marcel Dekker, New York2000: 27-60Google Scholar). In vitro, HGF/SF interacts with heparan sulfate (HS) (12Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Mizuno K. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11216-11223Google Scholar, 13Ashikari S. Habuchi H. Kimata K. J. Biol.

Rahmoune H. Fernig D.G. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 271-278Google Scholar) with sufficiently high affinities (KD values of 0.2–20 nm (14Rahmoune H. Rudland P.S. Gallagher J.T. Fernig D.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6003-6008Google Scholar,15Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Rahmoune H. Fernig D.G. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 271-278Google Scholar)) to support a physiological interaction. The apparently similar affinities of HGF/SF for these two structurally distinctive GAGs is rather unusual, as most HS-binding proteins display relatively weak affinities for DS. It is partly explained by the lack of requirement for either N-sulfate or 2-O-sulfate groups as major binding determinants (12Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Mizuno K. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11216-11223Google Scholar, 15Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Rahmoune H. Fernig D.G. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 271-278Google Scholar, 16Merry C.L.R. Bullock S.L. Swan D.C. Backen A. Lyon M. Beddington R.S.P. Wilson V.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35429-35434Google Scholar). This raises the question as to whether the binding of HS or DS has the same functional consequences for HGF/SF activity? Indeed, the degree of involvement, and putative role, of GAGs in HGF/SF activity has been somewhat confused. We have previously reported that Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells become completely unresponsive to HGF/SF when treated with chlorate, which metabolically inhibits the sulfation of endogenous GAGs (17Deakin J.A. Lyon M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1999-2009Google Scholar). Responsiveness to HGF/SF can be restored by exogenous HS, although it has to be presented in the form of an immobilized heparan sulfate proteoglycan substratum, and, interestingly, HS does not work as a soluble ligand in MDCK cells (17Deakin J.A. Lyon M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1999-2009Google Scholar). This suggests an obligate requirement for GAGs/proteoglycans for HGF/SF activity. An identical pattern of behavior was subsequently demonstrated with human mammary myoepithelial-like cells (18Sergeant N. Lyon M. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. Delehedde M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17094-17099Google Scholar). Namalwa Burkitt's lymphoma cells co-transfected with Met and a HS-bearing form of CD44 respond to HGF/SF, but not when a HS-lacking CD44 isoform is used (19Van der Voort R. Taher T.E.I. Wielenga V.J.M. Spaargaren M. Prevo R. Smit L. David G. Hartmann G. Gherardi E. Pals S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6499-6506Google Scholar). In contrast, Met-transfected BaF3 lymphoblastoid cells, which are reputedly completely deficient in HS, are reported to still respond to HGF/SF, although activity is significantly enhanced by the addition of exogenous heparin (20Schwall R.H. Chang L.Y. Godowski P.J. Kahn D.W. Hillan K.J. Bauer K.D. Zioncheck T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 709-718Google Scholar), a commonly used GAG analogue of the sulfated domains of HS. These same cells are completely refractory to the truncated NK1 and NK2 isoforms of HGF/SF (which are partial agonists of Met) unless exogenous heparin is present. The xylosyl transferase-deficient CHO pgsA-745 mutant cells are similarly unresponsive to NK1 in the absence of heparin (21Sakata H. Stahl S.J. Taylor W.G. Rosenberg J.M. Sakaguchi K. Wingfield P.T. Rubin J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9457-9463Google Scholar). It has also been reported that a double arginine reverse charge HGF/SF mutant with a consequent 50-fold reduction in heparin affinity had unimpaired biological activity (22Hartmann G. Prospero T. Brinkmann V. Ozcelik O. Winter G. Hepple J. Batley S. Bladt F. Sachs M. Birchmeier C. Birchmeier W. Gherardi E. Curr. Biology. 1997; 8: 125-134Google Scholar), although it was without activity in the Met/CD44 co-transfected lymphoma cells (19Van der Voort R. Taher T.E.I. Wielenga V.J.M. Spaargaren M. Prevo R. Smit L. David G. Hartmann G. Gherardi E. Pals S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6499-6506Google Scholar). It is thus unclear as to the true role of GAGs, and whether some of these conflicting observations primarily reflect differences between the properties of full-length HGF/SF and its truncated variants. Indeed, it has been suggested that the various forms of HGF/SF may engage the Met receptor in different ways (23Chirgadze D.Y. Hepple J. Byrd R.A. Sowdhamini R. Blundell T.L. Gherardi E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 126-129Google Scholar, 24Matsumoto K. Kataoka H. Date K. Nakamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22913-22920Google Scholar, 25Miller M. Leonard E.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 1-3Google Scholar). The putative mechanism(s) by which GAGs can modulate HGF/SF activity is also unclear. HGF/SF can apparently bind with high affinity to a purified Met-IgG fusion protein in vitro, in the absence of GAG (22Hartmann G. Prospero T. Brinkmann V. Ozcelik O. Winter G. Hepple J. Batley S. Bladt F. Sachs M. Birchmeier C. Birchmeier W. Gherardi E. Curr. Biology. 1997; 8: 125-134Google Scholar, 26Mark M.R. Lokker N.A. Zioncheck T.F. Luis E.A. Godowski P.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16871-16878Google Scholar). This suggests that GAGs are not required for at least the initial binding of HGF/SF to Met (although in the fusion protein constructs the Met is already dimerized). GAGs may, however, still be needed for a subsequent Met activation step. However, the predominant view, mostly based on experiments with the NK1 variant, is that the role of GAGs may be primarily to induce dimerization of the protein ligand (20Schwall R.H. Chang L.Y. Godowski P.J. Kahn D.W. Hillan K.J. Bauer K.D. Zioncheck T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 709-718Google Scholar, 21Sakata H. Stahl S.J. Taylor W.G. Rosenberg J.M. Sakaguchi K. Wingfield P.T. Rubin J.S.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14793-14802Google Scholar), thereby facilitating the subsequent dimerization and activation of Met. To try and further clarify these issues we have specifically investigated the GAG dependence of HGF/SF activity in the CHOpgsA-745 mutant cells. We wished to address experimentally the following: (i) is the activity of full-length HGF/SF essentially dependent upon, or enhanced by, the presence of appropriate GAGs; (ii) do HS and DS differ in their functional properties; (iii) is GAG-induced HGF/SF dimerization essential for activity; and (iv) is there evidence for an additional interaction between Met and HGF/SF-binding GAGs? CHO pgsA-745 cells were provided by Dr. J. Esko (University of California at San Diego, CA), and were routinely cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. MDCK cells were provided by Dr. E. Gherardi (MRC Center, Cambridge, UK), and were routinely cultured in Eagle's modified minimal essential medium with Earle's salts containing 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated donor calf serum. All cell cultures were supplemented with 1% (w/v) glutamine, 100 IU/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. All cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen (Paisley, UK). Recombinant human HGF/SF was obtained from R&D Systems (Abingdon, UK). Heparinase I (Flavobacterium heparinum; EC 4.2.2.7), chondroitinase ABC (Proteus vulgaris; EC 4.2.2.4), and chondroitinase ACI (F. heparinum; EC number 4.2.2.5) were from Seikagaku Kogyo Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Heparinase II (F. heparinum; no EC number assigned) and heparinase III (F. heparinum; EC4.2.2.8) were from Grampian Enzymes (Orkney, UK). Porcine mucosal heparin, heparin-agarose, wheat germ agglutinin-agarose, and azure A were from Sigma (Poole, UK). Sized heparin oligosaccharides were donated by Iduron (Manchester, UK). Porcine mucosal HS was a gift of NV Organon (Oss, Netherlands), and murine skin DS was a gift of Dr. David Lane (Imperial College, University of London). 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (Sulfo-NHS) were from Pierce & Warriner (Chester, UK). Bio-Gel P10 was from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hemel Hempstead, UK). Sephadex G-50 and PD-10 desalting columns were from Amersham Bioscience Inc. (St. Albans, UK). Porcine mucosal HS (10 mg) was dissolved in 1 ml of 50 mm sodium acetate, 0.5 mm calcium acetate, pH 7.0. Heparinase III was added to a final concentration of 50 mIU/ml and the mixture incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, before the addition of a second fresh batch of enzyme and digestion for a further 18 h. The resulting oligosaccharide mixture was resolved by gel filtration on a Bio-Gel P10 column (1.5 × 163 cm) eluted with NH4HCO3at a flow rate of 12 ml/h. Fractions (1.4 ml) were collected and monitored on a spectrophotometer at 232 nm. Individual size populations of oligosaccharides were pooled, desalted on a PD-10 column eluted with distilled water, and then dried on a centrifugal evaporator. Murine skin DS (10 mg) was dissolved in 1 ml of 50 mmsodium acetate, pH 6.5. Chondroitinase ACI was added to a final concentration of 50 mIU/ml and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, before the addition of a second fresh batch of enzyme and digestion for a further 18 h. The resulting oligosaccharide mixture was resolved on a ProPac PA-1 strong anion-exchange HPLC column (0.4 × 25 cm; Dionex) using a 0–1.5 m NaCl, pH 3.5, gradient at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and collection of 1-ml fractions. Elution was monitored by on-line UV absorbance at 232 nm, and fractions were pooled and processed as described above. Freshly trypsinized CHOpgsA-745 cells were seeded at high density in 1 ml of RPMI, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in a 24-well plate and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Medium was removed and replaced with serum-free RPMI for 2 h, before addition of fresh serum-free RPMI containing known concentrations of HGF/SF, cross-linked HGF/SF-GAG conjugates, or GAGs. After 20 min at 20 °C, the supernatants were removed and cells were solubilized in 70 μl/well of boiling, nonreducing Laemmli SDS sample buffer. Equivalent loadings of each sample were electrophoresed on a nonreducing 15% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel with a 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide stacking gel, and then electroblotted to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell GmbH, Dassel, Germany). Blots were blocked for 1 h in PBS, 10% (w/v) nonfat dried milk powder before probing for 1 h with a 1:1000 dilution (in PBS, 3% (w/v) nonfat dried milk powder, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) of a mouse monoclonal antibody to dually-phosphorylated (Thr183/202/Tyr185/204) ERK-1/2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). After thorough washing with PBS, a 1:5000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was added for 30 min. Bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Bioscience Inc.). Freshly trypsinized CHOpgsA-745 or MDCK cells in 1 ml of culture medium were seeded at high density into the top chamber of a 24-well Transwell plate with 12-μm pore polycarbonate membranes (Costar, High Wycombe, UK). Bottom chambers received 1 ml of medium containing known concentrations of HGF/SF, cross-linked HGF/SF-GAG conjugates, or GAG alone. After 4–5 h incubation at 37 °C, wells were emptied and cells were fixed with cold (−20 °C) methanol, air dried, and then stained with 1% (w/v) aqueous crystal violet. Cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed using a cotton bud. Membranes were excised using a scalpel blade, and the number of migrated cells on the underside of the membrane were counted under light microscopy. At least three representative fields were counted for each replicate membrane. The motility of MDCK cells was also assayed by the colony scatter assay, performed as described in Ref. 17Deakin J.A. Lyon M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1999-2009Google Scholar. Zero-length cross-linking of HGF/SF to intact GAGs or oligosaccharides was performed essentially as originally described for protein-protein cross-linking by Grabarek and Gergely (29Grabarek Z. Gergely J. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 185: 131-135Google Scholar). HS or DS chains (50–400 μg), or defined oligosaccharide size fractions (10 μg), were dissolved in 0.1 ml of 0.1 m MES, 0.1m NaCl, pH 6.0. Sufficient EDC and sulfo-NHS were added to give 6 and 15 mm concentrations, respectively, and the mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 15 min. Excess reagents were rapidly removed by passage through a 1.5-ml Sephadex G-50 column eluted with 0.1 m MES, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 6.0. Recovered activated GAGs/oligosaccharides were combined with 1 μg of HGF/SF and incubated at 25 °C for at least 2 h. Free HGF/SF was removed by adsorption to 50 μl of heparin-agarose beads for 1 h at room temperature. Cross-linked conjugates were stored at 4 °C until further use. Aliquots of cross-linked conjugates were made up to 0.1 ml with water and 25 μg of bovine serum albumin was added. Proteins were precipitated with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C for 15 min. Precipitates were pelleted by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold acetone, and then re-centrifuged. The final pellet was re-dissolved in either: (i) water (for subsequent degradation with pH 1.5 nitrous acid, according to the method of Shively and Conrad (30Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3943-3950Google Scholar)); (ii) 50 mm sodium acetate, 0.5 mm calcium acetate, pH 7.0 (for digestion with heparinase III); (iii) 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0 (for digestion with chondroitinase ABC). Samples of HGF/SF, or cross-linked HGF/SF-GAG conjugates, were electrophoresed on a nonreducing 7.5% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel with a 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide stacking gel. Western blots were probed for 1 h with a goat polyclonal antiserum (4 μg/ml) against human HGF (R & D Systems), followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (1:5000 dilution) and enhanced chemiluminescent detection. A TSK G4000PW XL (300 × 7.8 mm; Tosoh Corp., Tokyo, Japan) size exclusion chromatography HPLC column was equilibrated in 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The void (Vo) and total (Vt) volumes were determined with dextran blue and sodium dichromate, respectively. The column was calibrated for molecular mass using ovalbumin (45 kDa), hemoglobin (64.5 kDa), transferrin (80 kDa), and collagenase type 3 (110 kDa), which were monitored by on-line UV absorption at 280 nm. A plot of Kavversus Mr (on a log scale) was constructed. The elution positions of HGF/SF (500 ng) and a purified cross-linked HGF/SF-heparin conjugate (400 ng), applied in a 0.05-ml volume were determined by collecting fractions of 0.3 ml, followed by dot-blotting to nitrocellulose and probing with an antiserum against HGF/SF as described earlier. The elution position of free heparin was determined by dot blotting of 0.3-ml fractions to a cellulose acetate membrane followed by staining with 0.08% (w/v) aqueous azure A and subsequent destaining in water. CHO pgsA-745 cell monolayers were washed with PBS and then scraped into 100 μl of extraction solution, comprising 0.15 m NaCl, 25 mm HEPES, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.05% (w/v) SDS, 0.2% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.05% (w/v) sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm ammonium molybdate, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, pH 8.0. Cell extracts were mixed end-over-end for 1 h at 4 °C and then centrifuged (12,000 rpm for 10 min) to remove insoluble residues. Met receptor was partially purified by adsorption of the soluble cell extracts onto a suspension (packed bed volume of 300 μl) of wheat germ agglutinin-agarose. After washing with extraction solution, the bound glycoproteins (including Met) were eluted with either nonreducing Laemmli SDS-sample buffer (for SDS-PAGE), or 0.15 m NaCl, pH 2.0, followed by neutralization to pH 7.0 (for heparin affinity chromatography). Partially purified Met was analyzed on a nonreducing 7.5% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel with a 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide stacking gel. Western blots were probed with either a 1:1000 dilution of the DQ-13 murine monoclonal antibody against the intracellular C terminus of the Met β-chain (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY), or a 1 μg/ml dilution of a goat antiserum against the ectodomain of murine Met (R & D Systems). These were followed by 1:5000 dilutions of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or rabbit anti-goat IgG, respectively, and enhanced chemiluminescent detection. Partially purified Met was applied to a heparin-agarose affinity column (0.5 ml volume) equilibrated with PBS, and re-circulated three times. After extensive washing with 0.5 mm CHAPS in PBS, pH 7.4, any bound material was eluted using 1-ml stepwise additions of 0.15–1m NaCl in 20 mm phosphate, 0.5 mmCHAPS, pH 7.4. The agarose-based Sepharose CL-4B was used as a parallel control column. Met was recovered and concentrated from the collected fractions by re-adsorption to wheat germ agglutinin-agarose (30 μl of gel suspension), and then released by treatment with nonreducing SDS sample buffer at 100 °C. Samples were electrophoresed on a 7.5% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel with a 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide stacking gel. Western blots were probed with the anti-Met ectodomain antiserum as described above. The CHO pgsA-745 mutant cells are functionally mutated in the xylosyltransferase gene, resulting in a failure to transfer xylose to targeted serine resides and thus to initiate the synthesis of the sulfated GAGs. Consequently these cells are deficient in both HS and DS (31Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Google Scholar), although they do possess Met (21Sakata H. Stahl S.J. Taylor W.G. Rosenberg J.M. Sakaguchi K. Wingfield P.T. Rubin J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9457-9463Google Scholar). However, they fail to respond to HGF/SF by either ERK activation (dual phosphorylation) (Fig.1A) or by cell migration across a porous Transwell membrane (Fig. 1B). Even elevated HGF/SF concentrations of up to 50 ng/ml failed to have an effect (responsive cells usually respond optimally to 1–10 ng/ml). However, upon the simultaneous addition of soluble exogenous heparin together with HGF/SF, these mutant cells then signal through ERK (Fig.1A) and also acquire a migratory phenotype (Fig.1B), although they do not incorporate [3H]thymidine (data not shown). Heparin alone, in the absence of HGF/SF, had no effect (Fig. 1, A andB). Both HS and DS are known to bind HGF/SF with similar high affinities (14Rahmoune H. Rudland P.S. Gallagher J.T. Fernig D.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6003-6008Google Scholar, 15Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Rahmoune H. Fernig D.G. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 271-278Google Scholar), even though there are significant structural differences between these two GAGs. Both HS and DS, as soluble exogenous ligands, promote HGF/SF-mediated motility of CHO pgsA-745 cells in a Transwell migration assay, and they appear to act with similar potencies over a 103-fold range of concentrations (Fig.2). The crucial role of GAGs in the activation of Met by HGF/SF, as demonstrated in the CHO pgsA-745 cells, could result from a number of possible mechanisms. We have utilized a zero-length cross-linking technique which, by covalently linking HGF/SF to a bound GAG partner, can allow us to probe some of these putative mechanisms. Application of the zero-length cross-linking procedure gives rise to the efficient formation of covalent complexes between HGF/SF and all three GAG species that bind to it, i.e. HS (Fig.3A), DS (Fig. 3B), and heparin (not shown). These complexes display a larger and more heterogeneous molecular size on SDS-PAGE than native HGF/SF, reflecting a stable conjugation of the protein with a heterogeneous GAG population. Treatment of HGF/SF-HS complexes with either low pH nitrous acid or a mixture of heparinase enzymes, to specifically degrade the HS component, leads to a reduction in molecular size of the complex toward that of the initial HGF/SF monomer (Fig. 3A). Heparinase enzymes are less effective than nitrous acid, probably because of the larger steric exclusion they encounter in accessing the protein-conjugated HS. Similarly, HGF/SF-DS conjugates can be reduced in size by digestion with chondroitinase ABC (Fig. 3B). Covalent HGF/SF-GAG conjugates are unable to bind heparin-agarose, unlike native HGF/SF (see Fig. 3C for HGF/SF-HS conjugates; HGF/SF-DS conjugates behave the same (not shown)). This proves that the GAG is correctly positioned and cross-linked into the putative GAG-binding site in HGF/SF, thereby blocking any additional GAG interactions. Importantly, this means that when the conjugates are introduced into cell cultures, there can be no subsequent interaction with any endogenous GAGs. HGF/SF can also be effectively cross-linked to high affinity oligosaccharides such as HS- and DS-derived dp12–14s. However, there is only a very slight molecular weight shift on SDS-PAGE (not shown), and with smaller oligosaccharides it becomes imperceptible, because of the contrasting large size of HGF/SF (90 kDa). The formation of conjugates in these cases can only be confirmed by the proportionate loss of heparin affinity. As oligosaccharide size decreases the efficiency of cross-linking similarly decreases, and with dp8s only a small proportion of conjugate is formed, as assessed by binding to heparin-agarose (not shown). Importantly, the small size shifts upon SDS-PAGE after cross-linking with oligosaccharides of various sizes are only sufficient to indicate the formation of a 1:1 complex of HGF/SF and oligosaccharide, and there is no evidence of higher molecular weight oligomers. Even with intact GAGs the size of the great majority of the conjugate product would appear to be consistent with the presence of only one HGF/SF monomer per GAG chain (Fig. 3, Aand B). Cross-linked conjugates of HGF/SF with HS or DS are biologically active, in that they stimulate the activation of ERK (Fig.4) and the consequent motility of CHOpgsA-745 cells in the Transwell assay (Fig. 4). They also stimulate the motility of MDCK cells in both the scatter and Transwell assays (data not shown). Again, HS and DS display comparable levels of activity when conjugated to HGF/SF, as they do when noncovalently mixed with HGF/SF (compare Figs. 1 and 4). However, in absolute terms, the HGF/SF-GAG conjugates, with either HS or DS, display about 40–55% of the activity of HGF/SF mixed with an identical concentration of free GAG in the CHO pgsA-745 cells(Fig. 4), and about 35–40% of the activity elicited by HGF/SF alone in t"

Using agarose-electrophoretic mobility shift assay we found that NF-Y increases the affinity of holo-TFIID for Ea in a CCAAT- and Inr-dependent manner. We began to dissect the interplay between NF-Y- and TBP-associated factors PO1II (TAFIIs)-containing histone fold domains in protein-protein interactions and transfections. hTAFII20, hTAFII28, and hTAFII18-hTAFII28 bind to the NF-Y B-NF-YC histone fold dimer; hTAFII80 and hTAFII31-hTAFII80 interact with the trimer but not with the NF-YB-NF-YC dimer. The histone fold α2 helix of hTAFII80 is not required for NF-Y association, as determined by interactions with the naturally occurring splice variant hTAFII80δ. Expression of hTAFII28 and hTAFII18 in mouse cells significantly and specifically reduced NF-Y activation in GAL4-based experiments, whereas hTAFII20 and hTAFII135 increased it. These results indicate that NF-Y (i) recruits purified holo-TFIID in vitro and (ii) can associate multiple TAFIIs, potentially accommodating different core promoter architectures.

At a higher level, it is controlled by chromatin structures, whose fundamental unit is the nucleosome, a complex formed by core histones H2A, H2B, H3, H4, which wrap around them 146 base pairs of DNA (2Wolffe A.P.

Interestingly, gene inactivation of HFM-containing TAFIIs in yeast implicates them in a rather broad, if not universal, role in transcriptional activation (34Apone L.M. Virbasius C.A. Holstege F.C.

Another protein containing HFMs is NF-Y, also termed CBF, the ubiquitous trimeric protein binding to the widespread CCAAT-box promoter element; it is composed of NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC, all necessary for subunit association and DNA binding (reviewed in refs. 19Maity S. de Crombrugghe B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 174-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholarand 21Mantovani R. Gene. 1999; 239: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). The H2B-H2A-like NF-YB-NF-YC subunits dimerize tightly via their HFMs, forming a complex surface necessary for NF-YA association. The resulting trimer has a high affinity and sequence specificity for the CCAAT sequence. Several types of indications link TFIID to NF-Y. First, their binding sites are either ubiquitous, in the case of TFIID, or quite frequent, because 25% of the promoters have NF-Y sites; both are found at highly conserved positions within a prototypical promoter (20Mantovani R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Second, biochemical evidence of direct interactions has emerged: (i) NF-YB and NF-YC bind to TBP through short subdomains within the larger yeast/human conserved parts and short basic residues in the HS2 of TBP (41Bellorini M. Lee D.-K. Dantonel J.-C. Zemzoumi K. Roeder R.G. Tora L. Mantovani R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2174-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar); (ii) NF-YB is immunoprecipitated with an anti-TAFII100 antibody from crude nuclear extracts and is present in immunopurified TFIID fractions and in high molecular weight complexes in glycerol gradient experiments, indeed suggesting association with additional proteins; (iii) the Q-rich regions of NF-YA and NF-YC interact with dTAFII110 in vitro (42Coustry F. Sinha S. Maity S.N. deCrombrugghe B. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), a result consistent with the idea that Q-rich activators such as SP1 and cAMP-response element-binding protein function by binding to dTAFII110-hTAFII135 (43Hoey T.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11672-11678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Third, the lack of NF-Y binding has been associated with a closed chromatin configuration of the Xenopus HSP70 TATA-box region (49Landsberger N. Wollfe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6013-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and, very recently, with the inability to recruit TBP-TFIIB on the γ-globin promoter in vivo (50Duan Z. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Li Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3083-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar): These results clearly imply that NF-Y binding is essential for TFIID recruitment. To study the NF-Y-TFIID connections, we employed the mouse MHC class II Ea promoter system (51Viville S. Jongeneel V. Koch W. Mantovani R. Benoist C. Mathis D. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3211-3217PubMed Google Scholar, 52Bellorini M. Dantonel J.C. Yoon J.-B. Roeder R.G. Tora L. Mantovani R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Ea is a tissue-specific promoter active in B lymphocytes and other professional antigen-presenting cells (53Mach B. Steimle V. Martinez-Soria E. Reith W. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 301-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Like all other MHC class II promoters, it also requires the ubiquitous trimer RFX and lacks a functional TATA-box. We showed that TFIID binding to the Ea Inr is necessary for function in an in vitro transcription system. In this study, we began to dissect NF-Y-TFIID interplay with purified holo-TFIID, recombinant NF-Y, and isolated TAFIIs. Production and purification of recombinant NF-Y trimer were as described before, using wt NF-YA, wt NF-YB, and a TRX-His-NF-YC fusion protein (54Caretti G. Motta M.C. Mantovani R. Mol. Cell.

Holo-TFIID was immunopurified from HeLa cells with an anti-TBP antibody as previously detailed (9Mengus G. May M. Jacq X. Staub A. Tora L. Chambon P. Davidson I.

EMSAs of TFIID in agarose gels were as described in Ref. 52Bellorini M. Dantonel J.C. Yoon J.-B. Roeder R.G. Tora L. Mantovani R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar: holo-TFIID fractions were incubated in NF-Y buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol) together with 10,000 cpm of32P-labeled Ea fragments; the total volume was 10 μl. After incubation for 45 min at 30 °C, we added 2 μl of 1× buffer containing bromphenol blue, and samples were loaded on a 1.5% agarose gel (Bio-Rad Ultrapure) in 0.5× TBE. Gels were run at 140 V for 90 min at 4 °C, transferred onto DE81 paper, vacuum-dried, and exposed. Three independent preparations of purified TFIID were used in EMSAs. The Ea fragments used in EMSA analysis were obtained by PCR and contained sequences from −115 to +60 of the Ea promoter, either wt, mutated in the Y box (Ls17 (51Viville S. Jongeneel V. Koch W. Mantovani R. Benoist C. Mathis D. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3211-3217PubMed Google Scholar)), or in the Inr (Ls21 (52Bellorini M. Dantonel J.C. Yoon J.-B. Roeder R.G. Tora L. Mantovani R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)). For supershift experiments, anti-NF-YA and -NF-YB antibodies were purified on antigen columns (55Mantovani R. Pessara U. Tronche F., Li, X.Y. Knapp A.M. Pasquali J.L. Benoist C. Mathis D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3315-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against TAFIIs were as follows: 24TA and 26TA, anti-hTAFII80; 22TA, anti-hTAFII20; 15TA, anti-hTAFII28; and 16TA, anti-hTAFII18 (9Mengus G. May M. Jacq X. Staub A. Tora L.

Cell. 1994; 79: 107-117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies were purified by caprylic acid precipitation of ascites fluid followed by precipitation with 50% ammonium sulfate, resuspension in phosphate-buffered saline, and dialysis against NDB100 (100 mm KCl, 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA). The hTAFII31 rabbit polyclonal was a kind gift of Dr. A. Levine. Supershift experiments were performed by preincubating TFIID, with or without NF-Y, with the indicated antibodies (200 ng of purified monoclonal antibodies, 0.3 μl of the anti-hTAFII31 polyclonal, 200 ng of purified anti-NF-YA and anti-YB) for 2 h on ice, before addition of the labeled DNA and further incubation at 30 °C for 45 min. Interactions with NTA-agarose columns were performed by incubating either crude bacterial extracts or purified His-tagged proteins (1 or 2 μg) in BC100 (100 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 5 mm imidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) with NTA-agarose (100–200 μl); the column was washed with BC300 and BC1000, containing 300 mm and 1 m KCl, respectively; proteins were eluted in BC100 buffer containing 300 mm imidazole, dialyzed against BC100, and assayed in Western blots. Immunoprecipitations were performed as follows: The NF-Y trimer (500 ng) and an equivalent amount of the indicated TAFIIs were added to 25 μl of Protein G-Sepharose to which 7.5 μg of the purified anti-NF-YA7 monoclonal antibody had been previously bound. Incubation was pursued for 2 h on ice, unbound material was recovered after centrifugation, and the beads were washed with NDB100 with the addition of 0.1% Nonidet P-40. SDS buffer was added, and the samples were boiled at 90 °C for 5 min and loaded onto SDS gels. Western blots were performed according to standard procedures with the indicated primary antibody and a Pierce peroxidase secondary antibody. For multiple interactions, the filter was stripped, blocked with nonfat dry milk, and re-hybridized. The eukaryotic expression vectors for NF-Y, hTAFII28, hTAFII18, hTAFII20, hTAFII135, and hTAFII80 were described before (9Mengus G. May M. Jacq X. Staub A. Tora L. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1520-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 12Mengus G. May M. Carré L. Chambon P. Davidson I.

From PCR-hTAFII31 (kindly donated by Dr. Levine) an EcoRI insert was cloned into pGAL4poly in-frame with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain, and the latter was excised by cutting with XhoI and a partial EcoRI digest. Mouse NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were co-transfected with 1–3 μg of activating plasmids, 2 μg of the plasmids containing the Luciferase reporter gene, and 3 μg of pNβGal plasmid for control of transfection efficiency. The total amount of DNA was kept constant (at 15 μg) with Bluescript. All plasmids were purified by centrifugation using cesium chloride gradients. Cells were transfected with the standard calcium-phosphate method, recovered 48 h after transfection, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4), and resuspended in the Reporter assay reagent (Promega). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were measured according standard procedures. A minimum of three independent transfections in duplicate was done; most of the values are based on 8–12 transfections. We have previously shown that the MHC class II Ea promoter is crucially dependent on a binding of holo-TFIID to a TdT-like initiator (52Bellorini M. Dantonel J.C. Yoon J.-B. Roeder R.G. Tora L. Mantovani R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We investigated the interactions between NF-Y and holo-TFIID in such a system using recombinant NF-Y and immunopurified holo-TFIID in agarose-EMSA. Fig. 1 (A andB) shows a dose response of TFIID either alone (lanes 5–7), or with a fixed amount of NF-Y (lanes 2–4): in Fig. 1 A the NF-Y dose saturated the labeled fragment (lane 1), whereas in Fig. 1 B lower doses of NF-Y were used. Two major complexes of different mobility, termed IIDa and IIDb, were generated by TFIID; when incubated with NF-Y, both complexes generated dissimilar electrophoretic mobilities, clearly arising as a result of co-incubation of NF-Y and TFIID (Fig. 1 A, comparelanes 2–4 with 5–7; Fig. 1 B, comparelanes 1–3 with 5–7): One complex migrated slightly more slowly than the NF-Y band, and another was further retarded and visible at higher TFIID concentrations. Note that the upper Y/IID complexes were visible at lower TFIID concentrations (Fig.1 A, compare lanes 3 and 6). As a control for the specificity of the interactions, we used an identical Ea fragment carrying a 10-bp mutation in the Y-box, known to abolish NF-Y binding, as well as in vivo and in vitrotranscriptional activity of the promoter (51Viville S. Jongeneel V. Koch W. Mantovani R. Benoist C. Mathis D. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3211-3217PubMed Google Scholar): As expected, binding of NF-Y, but not TFIID, was abolished, and the upper bands resulting from simultaneous interactions were not detected (Fig. 1 C). To verify the effect of TFIID on NF-Y binding, a reciprocal experiment was also performed, namely a dose-response analysis of NF-Y alone, or with two TFIID concentrations (Fig. 1, D and E,lanes 2–7). The TFIID pattern at high concentrations was clearly modified in a dose-dependent manner by NF-Y (Fig.1 D, compare lanes 1 with 2–4). Interestingly, the lowest amount of NF-Y employed (0.1 ng), which was barely sufficient to generate a visible band, modified the pattern of the TFIIDa and -b bands. When incubated with low amounts of TFIID, insufficient to shift Ea DNA, the NF-Y band was evident at lower concentrations (Fig. 1 E, compare lanes 2 and3 with 6 and 7). In experiments conceptually similar to those of Fig. 1 C, we employed a fragment containing a 10-bp mutation in the Ea Inr region, known to cripple TFIID binding and Ea promoter function in vitro(52Bellorini M. Dantonel J.C. Yoon J.-B. Roeder R.G. Tora L. Mantovani R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar): The NF-Y complex, but not the TFIID or the Y/IID complexes, was generated by co-incubation of the two proteins (Fig. 1 F), indicating that an intact Inr is required for the formation of the NF-Y-TFIID complexes. Next, we wished to determine whether the Y/IID complexes observed in our EMSAs truly contain TAFIIs. To this aim, we used antibodies specific for different TAFIIs in supershift experiments. Fig. 1 G indicates that anti-hTAFII31, anti-hTAFII30, anti-hTAFII20, and two different anti-hTAFII80 antibodies all modify the Y/IID complexes, whereas an irrelevant anti-GATA1 antibody had no effect (Fig. 1 G, upper panel, compare lanes 1 and 2 with3–7). In parallel, when challenged with the IIDa complex, these antibodies all showed interactions (Fig. 1 G,middle panel), whereas none recognized the NF-Y complex (Fig. 1 G, lower panel). Note that the anti-hTAFII31 antibody, rather than supershifting the IIDa or Y/IID complexes, apparently inhibited binding of TFIID to DNA. Finally, we verified whether the Y/IID complexes also contain NF-Y, by challenging them with anti-NF-YA and anti-NF-YB antibodies. Indeed, both antibodies modified the mobilities of the complexes (Fig.1 H). The experiments shown in Fig. 1 (A–E) also suggest that the presence of NF-Y improves the binding capacity of holo-TFIID. We verified whether NF-Y can facilitate binding of TFIID by performing on-rate experiments: Binding of TFIID to DNA, in fact, is known to be a slow process, and the on-rates even on high affinity TATA-Inr elements are on the order of 20–40 min (Ref. 57Liebermann P.M. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 995-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, and references therein). On the contrary, NF-Y binding under our experimental conditions is extremely rapid, being completed after 1–2 min (Fig. 2 A; see also Ref.58Mantovani R., Li, X.-Y. Pessara U. Hoof van Huijsduijnen R. Benoist C. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20340-20346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We incubated suboptimal amounts of TFIID (see Fig. 1 E) with and without saturating amounts of NF-Y: A weak IID band was seen only after 30 min of incubation in the absence of NF-Y (Fig.2 B, lanes 6–9), whereas the upper Y/IID complexes were evident already after 2 min of incubation at 30 °C, and maximal after 5 min (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2 and3), strongly suggesting that NF-Y-CCAAT complexes recruit TFIID onto the Ea initiator. From this set of in vitro experiments with purified holo-TFIID and recombinant NF-Y, we conclude that: (i) complexes of different mobilities are formed upon simultaneous binding of TFIID and NF-Y to the Ea promoter; (ii) these complexes contain both TAFIIs and NF-Y; (iii) binding of NF-Y to the CCAAT box and of TFIID to the initiator is required; and (iv) TFIID binding is remarkably facilitated when NF-Y is bound to DNA. A large number of subunits are present in holo-TFIID, and full reconstitution of the holo-TFIID complex with recombinant proteins has not been achieved yet. We therefore decided to dissect NF-Y-TFIID interactions by taking a reductionist approach, investigating the interactions between isolated HFM subunits of the two complexes. Recombinant proteins were produced in E. coli orBaculovirus and purified (Fig.3). Note that the GST-hTAFII135Δ1–372 protein used hereafter is a mutant containing the C-terminal region with the HFM (16Gangloff Y.-G. Werten S. Romier C. Carré L. Poch O. Moras D. Davidson I. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2065752107,"The regulation and function of chimaerins, a family of non-protein kinase C (PKC) phorbol ester/diacylglycerol receptors with Rac-GAP activity, is largely unknown. In a search for chimaerin-interacting proteins, we isolated Tmp21-I (p23), a protein localized at the perinuclear Golgi area. Remarkably, phorbol esters translocate β2-chimaerin to the perinuclear region and promote its association with Tmp21-I in a PKC-independent manner. A deletional analysis revealed that the C1 domain in chimaerins is required for the interaction with Tmp21-I, thereby implying a novel function for this domain in protein-protein associations in addition to its role in lipid and phorbol ester binding. Our results support the emerging concept that multiple pathways transduce signaling by phorbol esters and revealed that, like PKC isozymes, chimaerins are subject to a positional regulation. In this setting, Tmp21-I serves as an anchoring protein that determines the intracellular localization of these novel phorbol ester receptors."

https://openalex.org/W2059433184,"Vps34p is a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase that is part of a membrane-associated complex with the Vps15p protein kinase. This kinase complex is required for the delivery of soluble proteins to the lysosomal/vacuolar compartment of eukaryotic cells. This study examined the Vps34p-Vps15p association and identified the domains within each protein that were important for this interaction. Using several different approaches, the interaction domain within Vps34p was mapped to a 28-amino acid element near its C terminus. This Vps34p motif was both necessary and sufficient for the interaction with Vps15p. Two-hybrid mapping experiments indicated that two separate regions of Vps15p were required for the association with Vps34p; they are the N-terminal protein kinase domain and a set of three tandem repeats of about 39 amino acids each. Neither domain alone was sufficient for the interaction. These Vps15p repeat elements are similar in sequence to the HEAT motifs that have been implicated in protein interactions in other proteins, including the Huntingtin protein. Finally, these studies identified a novel motif at the very C terminus of Vps34p that was required for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. This domain is highly conserved specifically in all Vps34p-like phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases but is not required for the interaction with Vps15p. This study thus represents a first step toward a better understanding of how this Vps15p.Vps34p kinase complex is assembled and regulated in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2038395512,"DNA binding of the transcription factor Ets-1 is negatively regulated by three inhibitory helices that lie near the ETS domain. The current model suggests that this negative regulation, termed autoinhibition, is caused by the energetic expense of a DNA-induced structural transition that includes the unfolding of one inhibitory helix. This report investigates the role of helix H1 of the ETS domain in the autoinhibition mechanism. Previous structural studies modeled the inhibitory helices packing together and connecting with helix H1, suggesting a role of this helix in the configuration of an inhibitory module. Recently, high-resolution structures of the ETS domain-DNA interface indicate that the N terminus of helix H1 directly contacts DNA. The contact, which is augmented by the macrodipole of helix H1, consists of a hydrogen bond between the amide NH of leucine 337 in helix H1 and the oxygen of a corresponding phosphate. We propose that this hydrogen bond positions helix H1 to be a link between autoinhibition and DNA binding. Four independent approaches tested this hypothesis. First, the hydrogen bond was disrupted by removal of the phosphate in a missing phosphate analysis. Second, base pairs that surround the helix H1-contacting phosphate and appear to dictate DNA backbone conformation were mutated. Next, a hydrophobic residue in helix H1 that is expected to position the N terminus of the helix was altered. Finally, a residue on the surface of helix H1 that may contact the inhibitory elements was changed. In each case DNA binding and autoinhibition was affected. Taken together, the results demonstrate the role of the dipole-facilitated phosphate contact in DNA binding. Furthermore, the findings support a model in which helix H1 links the inhibitory elements to the ETS domain. We speculate that this helix, which is conserved in all Ets proteins, provides a common route to regulation. DNA binding of the transcription factor Ets-1 is negatively regulated by three inhibitory helices that lie near the ETS domain. The current model suggests that this negative regulation, termed autoinhibition, is caused by the energetic expense of a DNA-induced structural transition that includes the unfolding of one inhibitory helix. This report investigates the role of helix H1 of the ETS domain in the autoinhibition mechanism. Previous structural studies modeled the inhibitory helices packing together and connecting with helix H1, suggesting a role of this helix in the configuration of an inhibitory module. Recently, high-resolution structures of the ETS domain-DNA interface indicate that the N terminus of helix H1 directly contacts DNA. The contact, which is augmented by the macrodipole of helix H1, consists of a hydrogen bond between the amide NH of leucine 337 in helix H1 and the oxygen of a corresponding phosphate. We propose that this hydrogen bond positions helix H1 to be a link between autoinhibition and DNA binding. Four independent approaches tested this hypothesis. First, the hydrogen bond was disrupted by removal of the phosphate in a missing phosphate analysis. Second, base pairs that surround the helix H1-contacting phosphate and appear to dictate DNA backbone conformation were mutated. Next, a hydrophobic residue in helix H1 that is expected to position the N terminus of the helix was altered. Finally, a residue on the surface of helix H1 that may contact the inhibitory elements was changed. In each case DNA binding and autoinhibition was affected. Taken together, the results demonstrate the role of the dipole-facilitated phosphate contact in DNA binding. Furthermore, the findings support a model in which helix H1 links the inhibitory elements to the ETS domain. We speculate that this helix, which is conserved in all Ets proteins, provides a common route to regulation. In eukaryotes, conserved families of DNA-binding proteins regulate unique biological target genes despite binding to similar DNA sequences. The ets family of transcription factors is one such example in that all Ets proteins bind a core 5′-GGAA/T-3′ sequence through the conserved ETS domain (1Sharrocks A. Brown A. Ling Y. Yates P. Int.

Academic Press, San Diego1998: 1-55Google Scholar). The ETS domain displays a winged helix-turn-helix motif (Fig. 1), consisting of three α helices and four β strands (termed the wing). High-resolution crystal structures of four ETS domains (PU.1, GABPα, SAP-1, and Elk-1) in complex with DNA reveal that most of the conserved residues in the ETS domain make similar base-specific and phosphate contacts (3Kodandapani R.

Despite this common mode of DNA binding, each Ets protein is expected to regulate transcription of distinct genes. Multiple mechanisms lend specificity to ETS domain DNA binding (1Sharrocks A.

In the case of Ets-1, autoinhibition negatively regulates DNA binding and provides a route to specificity (reviewed in Ref. 9Graves B.J. Cowley D.O. Goetz T.L. Petersen J.M.

Biol. 1998; LXIII: 621-629Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Autoinhibition is characterized by the observation that deletion or mutation of a region outside of a specific domain can modulate the activity of that domain. For example, in Ets-1, inhibitory elements that lie both N- and C-terminal to the ETS domain form a structural module that cooperatively represses the DNA binding activity of the ETS domain (10Lim F. Kraut N. Frampton J. Graf T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 11Nye J.A. Petersen J.M. Gunther C.V. Jonsen M.D. Graves B.J.

Secondary structural studies by NMR spectroscopy demonstrate that the inhibitory module is composed of three helices: HI-1, HI-2, and H4 (Fig. 1, A and B) (14Skalicky J.J. Donaldson L.W. Petersen J.M. Graves B.J. McIntosh L.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 296-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the inhibitory module undergoes a conformational change upon binding to DNA. Our current model of autoinhibition hypothesizes that the energetic expense of this conformational change accounts for the relatively low DNA binding activity of the ETS domain in the presence of the inhibitory helices. The most dramatic feature of this conformational change is the unfolding of helix HI-1, which is detected by both protease sensitivity and circular dichroism (Fig.1B) (13Jonsen M.D. Petersen J.M. Xu Q.P. Graves B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2065-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 15Petersen J.M. Skalicky J.J. Donaldson L.W. McIntosh L.P. Alber T. Graves B.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1866-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Although the unfolding of this helix is central to the autoinhibition mechanism, the existing experimental data do not provide a cause for this conformation change. For example, the inhibitory mechanism is not likely to work by steric interference because the inhibitory module, as modeled, does not directly occlude the contacts of the ETS domain with DNA.Structural studies of the ETS domain-DNA interface and the inhibitory module provide molecular details that suggest helix H1 is the keystone of the autoinhibition mechanism. Comparing crystallographically determined models of the ETS domain-DNA complex (3Kodandapani R. Pio F. Ni C.-Z. Piccialli G. Klemsz M. McKercher S. Maki R.A. Ely K.R.

Biol. 2000; 7: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we observed that in addition to the helix-turn-helix motif the highly conserved helix H1 of the ETS domain also plays a role in DNA binding. Specifically, the amide NH of leucine 337 at the N terminus of helix H1 is within hydrogen bonding distance of an oxygen atom of a specific phosphate (Fig. 1B), yielding an interaction that is facilitated electrostatically by the macrodipole of helix H1 (16Hol W.G. van Duijnen P.T. Berendsen H.J. Nature. 1978; 273: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). This highly directional and distance dependent interaction is expected to be sensitive to the precise conformation of DNA and the orientation of the N terminus of helix H1 with respect to DNA. In addition, NMR studies of inhibited and activated forms of Ets-1 in the absence of DNA suggest that the inhibitory module packs against helix H1 (14Skalicky J.J. Donaldson L.W. Petersen J.M. Graves B.J. McIntosh L.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 296-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Donaldson L.W. Petersen J.M. Graves B.J. McIntosh L.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Based on this collection of structural information, we speculated that helix H1 could structurally and functionally couple the ETS domain to the inhibitory module (9Graves B.J. Cowley D.O. Goetz T.L. Petersen J.M. Jonsen M.D. Gillespie M.E. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; LXIII: 621-629Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In our model, helix H1 in the unbound state contributes to the stability of the inhibitory module by direct interactions with both the inhibitory helices and the helix-turn-helix of the ETS domain. In the bound state, the N terminus of helix H1 directly contacts the phosphate backbone. We suggest that these two roles require alternative conformations of helix H1 with different packing interactions. Thus, DNA binding is accompanied by a change in helix H1 that destabilizes the inhibitory module. This potentially subtle change could involve an alteration in helix H1 structure and/or an adjustment in the orientation of the helix relative to other components.To test this model we investigated the role of helix H1 in DNA binding and autoinhibition using two well characterized N-terminal deleted versions of murine Ets-1: ΔN280, which spans the intact inhibitory module as well as the ETS domain and displays full autoinhibition; and the further truncated ΔN331, which lacks the two N-terminal inhibitory helices and is fully de-repressed (Fig. 1A) (15Petersen J.M. Skalicky J.J. Donaldson L.W. McIntosh L.P. Alber T. Graves B.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1866-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To probe the role of helix H1-DNA contact, we disrupted the hydrogen bond between helix H1 and phosphate oxygen directly by removing the phosphate or indirectly by changing the DNA sequence to alter its backbone conformation. In a complementary manner, we mutated amino acids in helix H1 that either pack against the helix-turn-helix of the ETS domain or connect the helix to the inhibitory module. Both classes of mutants affected autoinhibition. These findings support the hypothesis that the helix H1-phosphate contact contributes significantly to the ETS domain-DNA interaction. Furthermore, helix H1 connects to a network of intramolecular and intermolecular interactions that is essential for autoinhibition. This model suggests that helix H1 can serve as an allosteric control switch for both positive and negative regulation of ETS domain-DNA binding.

HepG2 cells expressing CYP2E1 (E47 cells) or control cells not expressing CYP2E1 (C34 cells) were preloaded with arachidonic acid (AA, up to 10 μm) and, after washing, incubated with iron-nitrilotriacetic acid (up to 100 μm) for variable periods (up to 12 h). Toxicity was greater in E47 cells than in C34 cells at all times and combinations of iron/AA tested. Cytosolic calcium increased with incubation time in both cell lines, but the increase was higher in E47 cells than in C34 cells. The rise in calcium was an early event and preceded the developing toxicity. Toxicity in E47 cells and the increase in Ca2+ were inhibited by omission of Ca2+ from the extracellular medium, and toxicity was restored by reincorporation of Ca2+. An inhibitor of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores did not prevent the toxicity or the increase in Ca2+, reflecting a role for the influx of extracellular Ca2+ in the toxicity. Reactive oxygen production was similar in media with or without calcium, indicating that calcium was not modulating CYP2E1-dependent oxidative stress. Toxicity, lipid peroxidation, and the increase of Ca2+ in E47 cells exposed to iron-AA were inhibited by α-tocopherol. E47 cells (but not C34 cells) exposed to iron-AA showed increased calpain activityin situ (40-fold). The toxicity in E47 cells mirrorred calpain activation and was inhibited by calpeptin, suggesting that calpain activation plays a causal role in toxicity. These results suggest that CYP2E1-dependent toxicity in this model depends on the activation of lipid peroxidation, followed by an increased influx of extracellular Ca2+ and activation of Ca2+-dependent proteases.

Increases of [Ca2+]i can result from an influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular medium, redistribution of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, or both influx and redistribution. Increases in [Ca2+]i from any source often lead to changes in other fluxes because of activation of phospholipases and proteases (3Trump B.F. Berezesky I.K.

Calcium influx in nonexcitable cells occurs through Ca2+-selective channels activated secondarily to store depletion and/or through receptor- or second messenger- operated channels, along a decreasing electrochemical gradient (4Lenz T. Kleineke J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1526-C1532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other Ca2+ transport systems that can be activated by oxidative stress, include nonselective cation channels and the reverse mode of operation of the Na+/Ca2+exchanger (5Barros L.F. Stutzin A.

Although intracellular calcium has been suggested to play a role in the oxidative damage of hepatocytes, the effects and source of the oxidative stress-induced intracellular Ca2+ increase are currently debatable (6Kim J.

Treatment of liver cells with several oxidative stress inducer drugs increases [Ca2+]iand produces cell toxicity through necrosis and/or apoptosis, depending on the degree of exposure (dose and duration) (2Kass G.E.N.

The initial source of Ca2+ depends on the specific oxidant and cell type employed, since certain toxins cause calcium release from intracellular stores (5Barros L.F. Stutzin A. Calixto A. Catalan M.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of calcium-dependent proteases and phospholipases can preserve cell viability in anoxic and hypoxic injury in hepatocytes (12Rosser B.G. Gores G.J. Gastroenterology. 1995; 108: 252-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In contrast to the above, increases of [Ca2+]imay not be essential in all forms of hepatocyte injury (e.g.toxicity by the redox cycling drug naphthazarin was mediated through lysosomal damage and prevented by inhibition of lipid peroxidation and chelation of intralysosomal iron (13Öllinger K. Brunk U.T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 19: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar)). Hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death in rat hepatocytes was not dependent upon an increase in calcium but was blocked by deferoxamine (14Starke P.E. Hoek J.B. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3006-3012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A Ca2+-independent, iron-mediated mechanism of prooxidant-induced cytotoxicity has been proposed (14Starke P.E. Hoek J.B. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3006-3012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some reports suggest that both calcium-dependent and calcium-independent events contribute to the cell toxicity (15Farber J.L. Environ. Health Perspect. 1990; 84: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar); an influx of extracellular Ca2+ions may aggravate the mechanism of iron-mediated cell injury (16Sakaida I. Thomas A.P. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 717-722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). H2O2 toxicity in L929 cells could be switched from a calcium-mediated process (in the absence of glucose) to an iron-mediated process (in the presence of glucose) (17Lomonosova E.E. Kirsch M. de Groot H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species (ROS)1 are involved in mechanisms of early alcohol-induced liver injury. CYP2E1 is induced in hepatocytes by ethanol and is one source of ROS leading to liver injury (18Tsukamoto H. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 154-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The role of [Ca2+]i in ethanol-induced liver cell injury remains to be defined. Ethanol administrationin vivo increases the calcium content in the liver of rats and mice, and this effect was enhanced by glutathione depletion or co-administration of iron, suggesting a synergism between ethanol and these agents (19Strubelt O. Younes M. Pentz R. Toxicology. 1987; 45: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20Anghileri L.J. Esposito M. Fulcheri E. Zicca A. Cadoni A. Thouvenot P. In Vivo. 1999; 13: 13-20PubMed Google Scholar). The rise in liver cell calcium content may contribute to the cell injury process associated with toxic agents, or it may be a relatively late consequence of cell injury (21Landon E.J. Naukam R.J. Rama Sastry B.V. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To evaluate biochemical and toxicological properties of CYP2E1, HepG2 cell lines overexpressing human CYP2E1 were previously established (22Dai Y. Rashba-Step J. Cederbaum A.I. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6928-6937Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar,23Chen Q. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Ethanol, iron, or polyunsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic acid were toxic to the cells expressing CYP2E1 but not to control HepG2 cells (24Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23914-23919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 25Chen Q. Galleano M. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1024-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We recently described a synergistic toxicity in CYP2E1-expressing cells caused by the combined addition of iron plus arachidonic acid (27Caro A.A. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 742-752PubMed Google Scholar). The potential role, if any, of calcium and/or Ca2+-activated hydrolases in these models of CYP2E1-dependent toxicity has not been determined. The objectives of this work were (i) to evaluate if CYP2E1-dependent toxicity in HepG2 cells is dependent on the alteration of Ca2+ homeostasis and (ii) to study the activation of calcium-dependent processes during CYP2E1-dependent toxicity. Ionomycin, TMB-8, and calpeptin were from Calbiochem. PBS was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. G418 was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Ethanol (95%) was from Pharmaco Products (Brookfield, CT). Fluo3-AM and pluronic acid were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. Most other chemicals used were from Sigma. The iron-nitrilotriacetic acid complex (Fe-NTA; 1:3 iron/NTA) was prepared as previously described (26Sakurai K. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1024-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Two human hepatoma HepG2 cell lines described by Chen and Cederbaum (23Chen Q. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) were used as models in this study: E47 cells, which constitutively express human CYP2E1, and C34 cells, which are HepG2 cells transfected with the empty pCI vector. All cell lines were grown in MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.5 mg/ml G418 supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were subcultured at a 1:5 ratio once a week. For the experiments, cells were plated at a density of 30,000 cells/ml and incubated for 12 h in MEM supplemented with 5% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (MEMexps). After this period, the medium was replaced with MEMexps supplemented with arachidonic acid (from 0 to 10 μm). After 12 h of incubation at 37 °C, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with PBS to remove unincorporated arachidonic acid. The cells were incubated for an additional 12-h period with MEMexps. Then the cells were washed once with PBS, and the medium was replaced with MEMexps without FBS or with S-MEM supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (S-MEMexps). S-MEM medium is identical to MEM medium except for the omission of calcium chloride. The medium was supplemented with any additions (e.g. antioxidants, channel blockers, inhibitors) for 1 h, prior to the addition of Fe-NTA (from 0 to 100 μm), which was considered as the initiation of the cellular toxicity phase (time = 0 h). The cells were incubated for variable periods (up to 12 h) before the biochemical analyses. This basic protocol (i.e. preloading with arachidonic acid, washing, adding MEMexps without FBS or S-MEMexps, and initiating the toxicity phase by the addition of Fe-NTA) was used for all experiments. 3 × 104 cells were plated onto 24-well plates, and after the corresponding treatment, the medium was removed, and cell viability was evaluated by the MTT test as previously described (27Caro A.A. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 742-752PubMed Google Scholar). The absorbance of the formazan produced was measured at a wavelength of 570 nm with background substraction at 630 nm (28Denizot F. Lang R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 89: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (4357) Google Scholar). Viability was expressed as follows: 100 × (ΔA570–630sample/ΔA570–630 control). Control refers to incubations in the absence of arachidonic acid and Fe-NTA and was considered as the 100% viability value. Another index of cytotoxicity used was the leakage of lactate dehydrogenase. At the end of the treatment, 1 ml of the medium was collected to measure LDH activity released into the medium (LDH out) using the Sigma LDH-20 diagnostic kit. Cells were washed with PBS, harvested by scraping in 1.0 ml of PBS, and sonicated (20 s, duty cycle 40%, output control 50%). The cellular suspension was centrifuged, and the supernatant was assayed for LDH activity (LDH in). Cytotoxicity was expressed as percentage of LDH release: 100 × (LDH out/LDH out + LDH in). Cell morphology was also assessed under the light microscope (×20) as a third index of viability. The intracellular calcium levels were determined with the fluorescent calcium indicator fluo3-AM by flow cytometry. 3 × 105 cells were plated in 10-mm Petri dishes, and at the end of the various treatments the medium was replaced with 3 ml of MEMexps without FBS plus 2.5 μm fluo3-AM and 0.02% pluronic acid (stock solution × 1000 in Me2SO). Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After loading, the cells were washed in PBS (to remove any dye nonspecifically associated with the cell surface), trypsinized, and resuspended in 1 ml of MEMexps without FBS plus 5 μg of propidium iodide (PI). PI was used to assay for the viable cell population, since these cells exclude PI, whereas nonviable cells take up this dye. The measurement of [Ca2+]i was performed by flow cytometry analysis of 10,000 cells using Cell Quest software. The increase in calcium level was expressed using the percentage of fluo3 fluorescence intensity in Fe-NTA plus AA-treated cells (F) over that of AA-loaded cells not exposed to Fe-NTA (F0) (100 × F/F0) (29Yang C.F. Shen H.M. Ong C.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 380: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). 10 μm ionomycin was applied to one sample before each experiment to check for correct loading of the cells and thus served as a positive control. The inhibitors tested did not interfere with the quantification of the fluorescence (488/525 nm excitation/emission) of a standard fluo3-Ca2+ solution. The production of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) was assayed as previously described (27Caro A.A. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 742-752PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration of the cell suspension was determined using a protein assay kit based on the Lowry assay (Bio-Rad DC kit). The concentration of malondialdehyde was calculated from a standard curve prepared using malonaldehyde bisdimethylacetal (30Esterbauer H. Cheeseman K.H. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 407-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (2892) Google Scholar). Intracellular ROS were monitored with 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) as the probe. 3 × 105 cells were plated in 10-mm Petri dishes, and after the corresponding treatment, the medium was replaced with FBS-free MEMexps supplemented with 5 μmDCFH-DA (31Bai J. Rodriguez A.M. Melendez J.A. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26217-26224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and after this incubation, they were washed with PBS, trypsinized, and resuspended in 1 ml of FBS-free MEMexps plus 5 μg of PI. 10,000 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using Cell Quest software. The possible antioxidant activity of flufenamic acid or calpeptin was evaluated following the protocol described in Ref. 32Mak I.T. Weglicki W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 234: 620-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar. Microsomal membranes from control rat liver (250 μg of protein/0.10 ml) were mixed with 0.5 μl of each drug (stock solutions × 200 in ethanol) and preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C in a reaction buffer consisting of 120 mmKCl, 50 mm sucrose, and 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2. Lipid peroxidation reactions were initiated by the addition of 0.025 mm FeCl3 chelated by 0.25 mm ADP and 0.83 mm dihydroxyfumaric acid. At various times of incubation, the levels of TBARS were determined as described above. The compounds tested did not interfere with the quantification of malondialdehyde in the standard curve at the concentrations employed. CYP2E1 activity was measured in microsomes derived from E47 cells and in liver microsomes from acetone-treated rats (1% acetone (v/v) in the drinking water for 7–10 days) by the spectrophotometric analysis of p-nitrophenol hydroxylation as described in Ref. 22Dai Y. Rashba-Step J. Cederbaum A.I. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6928-6937Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar. Microsomes from rat liver were employed in anin vitro test for the possible inhibitory activity of flufenamic acid or calpeptin on CYP2E1 catalytic activity. In this case, the drugs were preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C with the microsomal suspension, prior to initiating the reaction by the addition of 0.4 mmp-nitrophenol and 1 mmNADPH. The compounds tested did not interfere with the quantification of 4-nitrocatechol in the standard curve at the concentrations employed. The activity of calpain in intact cells was assessed with the use of the cell-permeable fluorogenic substrate SUCC-LLVY-AMC (33Guttman R.P. Johnson G.V.W. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 144: 143-150PubMed Google Scholar). Specific proteolysis of the substrate by calpain liberates the fluorescent AMC group, leading to an increase of its fluorescence that is proportional to the proteolytic activity of calpain. 7.5 × 104 cells were plated in 6-well plates, exposed to AA (0–5 μm) for 12 h, washed with PBS, and further incubated for 12 h in MEMexps as described above. After this, cells were washed with serum-free MEMexps without phenol red, and 3 ml of this medium plus 25 μm SUCC-LLVY-AMC was added to the cells in each well. After an equilibration period of 5 min, Fe-NTA (0–25 μm) was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for up to 6 h. Fluorescence readings at 360/430-nm excitation/emission were performed at intervals. Controls with calpeptin, a specific calpain inhibitor, were performed by preincubating the cells with the inhibitor for 1 h prior to the addition of the fluorogenic substrate. Blank fluorescence readings (incubation medium without cells, incubated in the same conditions) were subtracted from each data point. α-Tocopherol, calpeptin, and TMB-8 at the concentrations used did not interfere with the quantification of AMC fluorescence. 100 μm flufenamic acid slightly quenched the fluorescence of AMC in the medium of E47 cells treated with iron/AA/SUCC-LLVY-AMC (22% of inhibition of fluorescence); this factor was considered in the quantification of calpain activity in the presence of flufenamic acid. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. of the mean from 3–5 independent experiments. One-way analysis of variance with subsequent post hoc comparisons by Scheffe was performed. p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Fig.1A shows that the combination of 25 μm Fe-NTA and 5 μm arachidonic acid was highly toxic in HepG2 cells overexpressing CYP2E1 (E47 cells, 31% viability at 12 h) with respect to cells not expressing detectable activity of CYP2E1 (C34 cells, 75% viability at 12 h). The toxicity in E47 cells was evident starting from early incubation times (i.e. 3 h, 62% viability), while no significant toxicity could be detected in C34 cells exposed to iron plus arachidonic acid at early times (Fig. 1A). Arachidonic acid (up to 10 μm) or Fe-NTA (up to 100 μm) by itself (at 6 h) was not significantly toxic in C34 or E47 cells (Fig. 1, B and C), but the combination of iron and arachidonic acid showed enhanced toxicity in both cell types. The toxicity was greater in cells overexpressing CYP2E1 at all combinations tested. This enhanced toxicity of arachidonic acid and iron was evident at relatively low concentrations of arachidonic acid (1 μm, with 12.5 μm Fe-NTA; Fig.1B), and Fe-NTA (5 μm, with 5 μmarachidonic acid; Fig. 1C). E47 cells exposed to 5 μm arachidonic acid and subsequently to 25 μm Fe-NTA for 3 h showed an increased intracellular calcium content (Fig. 2A,curve ii) with respect to control cells incubated only with arachidonic acid (Fig. 2A, curve i). When 10 μm ionomycin was added to the iron plus arachidonic acid-treated cellular suspension, an additional increase in the fluo3 fluorescence was detected (Fig. 2A,curve iii), suggesting that the intracellular indicator was not saturated under these loading conditions. No significant differences in fluo3 fluorescence were detected between control (not treated with AA plus Fe-NTA) C34 and E47 cells (not shown). Intracellular calcium increased both in arachidonic acid-loaded C34 and E47 cells after exposure to Fe-NTA, starting from early incubation times (i.e. 30 min), although the increase was greater in the cells that overexpressed CYP2E1 at all time points evaluated (Fig. 2B). Permeabilization of the cell membrane with digitonin led to an increase in PI staining but to a loss of the fluo3 fluorescence, so that the quantification of fluo3 fluorescence in our experiments was restricted to PI-negative (i.e. viable) cells. Therefore, the increase in intracellular calcium by exposure to iron plus arachidonic acid occurred prior to the loss of membrane integrity, since only PI negative cells were considered for the quantification of fluo3 fluorescence. This suggests that elevation in calcium levels is an early event in the developing toxicity. The omission of extracellular calcium in the last incubation step was accomplished by working with S-MEM medium lacking fetal bovine serum. The omission of extracellular calcium was not toxic by itself in nontreated E47 cells (Fig.3A, MTT assay; Fig.3B, LDH release, open circles). The omission of extracellular calcium, however, significantly decreased the toxicity of iron plus arachidonic acid in E47 cells (Fig. 3,A and B, open squares versus closed squares). For example, AA plus Fe-NTA produced strong toxicity after 6 h of incubation in MEMexps medium but not in Ca2+-free medium for up to 6 h of incubation with Fe-NTA. Toxicity in Ca2+-free medium was found after 12 h of incubation with iron, although this remained considerably lower than the toxicity in MEM at that same time point (Fig. 3). E47 cells exposed for 6 h to 5 μm arachidonic acid and 25 μm Fe-NTA in MEMexps showed substantial morphological changes with respect to control cells; cells were swollen and dispersed with accumulation of intracellular vesicles, and many cells were detached and floated to the top of the culture dish (data not shown). However, morphology in E47 cells exposed to iron plus arachidonic acid for 6 h remained normal in S-MEMexps in contrast to the changes observed in MEMexps (data not shown). The greater toxicity by AA plus Fe-NTA in MEM than S-MEM media presumably reflects a requirement for Ca2+ in the overall toxicity pathway. To validate that these differences were indeed due to the absence of Ca2+ in S-MEM, Ca2+ was added back to S-MEM, and the toxicity of AA plus Fe-NTA was determined. The addition of up to 0.4 mm Ca2+ had no effect on the viability of E47 cells in S-MEM in the absence of AA plus Fe-NTA. However, Ca2+ in a concentration-dependent manner restored the toxicity of AA plus Fe-NTA (Fig.4). The toxicity when 0.4 mmCa2+ was added to the S-MEM began to approach the toxicity found in MEM medium, which contains 1.8 mm Ca2+(Fig. 4). Adding Ca2+ to S-MEM at concentrations greater than 0.4 mm could not be evaluated because of precipitation of the medium. The toxicity of iron and arachidonic acid in E47 cells was previously related to increased ROS generation and lipid peroxidation (27Caro A.A. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 742-752PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were designed to test whether the omission of Ca2+ in the extracellular medium inhibited the generation of ROS and lipid peroxidation caused by AA plus Fe-NTA in the E47 cells. ROS generation was tested by measuring the fluorescence of DCFH by flow cytometry. Control E47 cells (Fig. 5i) showed a relatively low fluorescence of DCFH in viable (i.e. PI-negative) cells (lower right quadrant), reflecting the basal generation of ROS. About 31% of the cells lost membrane integrity and accumulated PI (Fig. 5i,upper left quadrant). Permeabilization of the cell membrane with digitonin triggered the loss of DCFH from the intracellular space; thus, only PI-negative (i.e.viable) cells were considered for the quantification of DCFH fluorescence. Arachidonic acid-loaded cells exposed to Fe-NTA for 3 h in MEM had increased PI staining, indicating loss of plasma membrane integrity (58% of cells with high PI staining) (Fig.5ii). In contrast, cells exposed to iron plus arachidonic acid in S-MEM showed a smaller percentage of cells in the PI-positive quadrant (31% of cells with high PI staining) (Fig. 5iv). However, despite differences in viability in MEM compared with S-MEM, the mean DCFH fluorescence values were the same in MEM and S-MEM in the absence of AA plus Fe-NTA (572 ± 123 and 615 ± 116 AU, Fig. 5, i and iii, respectively) as well as in the presence of AA plus Fe-NTA (1786 ± 217 and 1592 ± 175 AU; Fig. 5, ii and iv, respectively). The addition of AA plus Fe-NTA increased the mean DCFH fluorescence about 3-fold in both MEM and S-MEM. Lipid peroxidation in E47 cells exposed to Fe plus arachidonic acid for 3 h in MEM increased about 3-fold with respect to control cells; this increase was similar to that in E47 cells exposed to iron plus arachidonic acid in S-MEM (Table I). Preincubation of arachidonic acid-loaded E47 cells with α-tocopherol prior to the 3-h incubation with Fe-NTA decreased the TBARS content of the cells to basal levels (Table I). Taken as a whole, these results indicate that the lower toxicity of Fe plus arachidonic acid in E47 cells in S-MEM medium was not related to an inhibition of ROS generation and lipid peroxidation (i.e. the requirement for Ca2+ in the toxicity process was not related to altered ROS production but to some other Ca2+-dependent effect).Table ITBARS generation in E47 cellsTreatmentTBARSnmol/mg protein−Fe/AA, MEM0.072 ± 0.004−Fe/"
https://openalex.org/W1481731879,"The tumour-suppressor protein BRCA1 mediates its biological functions by interacting with cellular factors1,2 such as the CtIP polypeptide3,4, a substrate for the ATM (for 'ataxia telangiectasia mutated') protein kinase5. Li et al.6 report that the BRCA1–CtIP interaction is disrupted by ionizing radiation and by other genotoxic stresses that induce phosphorylation of CtIP by ATM kinase, and that this dissociation of the BRCA1–CtIP complex in turn modulates the transcription of DNA-damage-response genes6. We have shown that the BRCA1-binding domain of CtIP (amino-acid residues 133–369) is distal to the sites that are phosphorylated by ATM kinase (residues S664 and S745)7. We now show that the BRCA1–CtIP complex is stable in irradiated cells, and that the phosphorylated isoforms of CtIP that are induced by ionizing radiation still interact in vivo with BRCA1. We conclude that disruption of the BRCA1–CtIP complex cannot account for induction of DNA-damage-response genes in the way proposed by Li et al.6."

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 321-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The formation of a covalent 3′-phosphotyrosyl intermediate with the conserved active site tyrosine (Tyr-274) is nature's elegant solution to two problems, preserving the energy of the phosphodiester linkage so that the DNA can be religated and providing a swivel point for relaxation of DNA supercoils (2Stivers J.T. Harris T.K. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5212-5222Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although one of the most fascinating aspects of type I DNA topoisomerase action is the dynamic motion of the enzyme and DNA, little is known about the conformational fluctuations that occur before and after the cleavage step or the role these changes may play in site-specific binding and in controlling the rate of DNA relaxation. Because of their essential role in maintaining the superhelical density of DNA in the cell, topoisomerases have attracted much attention as targets for antiviral, antibacterial, and anticancer drugs. Importantly, many of these drugs act to trap the enzyme in nonproductive conformations that are incapable of religating after the initial cleavage step. Accordingly, an understanding of topoisomerase conformational dynamics is of great interest. Structural and biochemical studies on the 314-residue vaccinia topoisomerase have revealed that the enzyme consists of two domains with two flexible loop regions that become protease resistance upon DNA binding, suggesting an induced fit conformational change in the enzyme (3Cheng C.

Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11636-11645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain consists of residues 1–80 and contributes to site-specific DNA binding (6Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11636-11645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal or catalytic domain (residues 81–314) contains the active site tyrosine and a constellation of basic groups that form direct interactions with the scissile phosphodiester that have been shown to be essential for efficient catalysis (Arg-130, Lys-167, Arg-223, and His-265) (7Wittschieben J. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3001-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 8Stivers J.T. Jagadeesh G.J. Nawrot B. Stec W.J. Shuman S.

The crystal structure of the free catalytic domain has also provided strong evidence for a precleavage conformational step, because the essential residues Tyr-274, Arg-130, and Lys-167 were not in positions that would allow direct interaction of these groups with the scissile phosphodiester. Although a conformational step is strongly implicated, there have been differing viewpoints as to whether this step is faster or slower than the chemical step of DNA cleavage (Fig.1) (1Shuman S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 321-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 8Stivers J.T. Jagadeesh G.J. Nawrot B. Stec W.J. Shuman S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5561-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In principle, if one could develop approaches in which the conformational steps could be directly monitored, the overall rate-limiting step could be ascertained. In this study we report the first continuous fluorescence kinetic measurements of a type IB DNA topoisomerase. Incorporation of the fluorescent adenine analogue, 2-aminopurine, 3′ to the DNA cleavage site afforded a strong increase in fluorescence intensity of the DNA upon noncovalent binding by the Y274F mutant and during site-specific cleavage by the wild-type enzyme. This signal from the DNA was used to measure the association rate, dissociation rate, equilibrium constant for noncovalent DNA binding, and the DNA cleavage rate. In addition, the tryptophan fluorescence intensity of the topoisomerase was found to decrease about 50% upon noncovalent DNA binding, providing an independent probe of the conformational changes in the enzyme. 1The nature of the exact conformational change in the DNA and enzyme that is observed through the 2-AP and tryptophan fluorescence changes cannot be known with absolute certainty. However, these changes occur with identical rapid kinetics and provide two independent spectroscopic signals to monitor the time frame for formation of the noncovalent complex. If other spectroscopically transparent conformational events occur before the observed changes, to be kinetically competent they must be even more rapid than the observed fluorescence change. Slower conformational eventsafter the rapid step are inconsistent with the kinetic and thermodynamic measurements that indicate a two-state equilibrium for cleavage and religation (see text). Combining these fluorescence results with detailed kinetic measurements of DNA cleavage and religation now provides a consistent and unambiguous assessment of the kinetic barriers that are present after DNA association and before DNA cleavage. The results support a mechanism in which enzyme clamp closing is at least 14-fold faster than the DNA cleavage step (Fig.1B). In the accompanying article (28Kwon K. Jiang Y.L. Song F. Stivers J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 353-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we present19F NMR studies that reveal a dynamic flipping motion of the +1 base of the consensus cleavage sequence in the enzyme DNA complex (inset, Fig. 1B). The cloning and purification of wild-type topoisomerase and the Y274F mutant have been described previously (10Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar,11Stivers J.T. Jagadeesh G.J. Nawrot B. Stec W.J. Shuman S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5561-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The enzyme concentrations were determined by UV absorbance using an extinction coefficient of 28,140 m−1cm−1 in a buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, and 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride (11Stivers J.T. Jagadeesh G.J. Nawrot B. Stec W.J. Shuman S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5561-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The sequences of DNA substrates used in these studies are shown in Fig. 2. The oligonucleotides were synthesized using an ABI 380B synthesizer. The phosphoramidite reagent of the fluorescence base, 2-aminopurine (2-AP),2 was obtained from Glen Research, and all other nucleotide phosphoramidites were obtained from Applied Biosystems, Inc. The oligonucleotides were purified using anion exchange high pressure liquid chromatography and desalted using disposable gel filtration columns (PD-10, Amersham Biosciences). The purity of oligonucleotides was confirmed using electrophoresis through a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight. The DNA duplexes were prepared by hybridization in Buffer A (20 mmTris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, at 25 °C). The 18-mer DNA strand containing the CCCTT motif was 3′ end-labeled with [α-32P]ATP using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Amersham Biosciences), and the labeled 18*-mer was hybridized with a 1.1-fold molar excess of 24-mer (Fig. 2). The labeled 18*/24-mer duplex DNA was then purified using Bio-Gel P-6 spin column (Bio-Rad). The cleavage experiments were performed using Buffer A. The final concentration of DNA was 2.3 nm, and wild-type topoisomerase was varied in the range 50–1000 nm. One μl of the quenched reactions was spotted on polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates (EM Science) and developed with a mobile phase containing 0.15 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, for 15 min to separate the labeled 6*-mer product (Rf = 0.6) from the substrate (Rf = 0). The TLC plates were imaged using a Storm 640 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and the fractional extent of reaction at a given time (frac Pt = cpm 6*-mer/total cpm), normalized to the observed end point (frac P∞), was quantified using the ImageQuant software (i.e. frac Pnorm = frac Pt/frac P∞). The measured pseudo-first-order rate constants for cleavage at each concentration of topoisomerase (kobs) were plotted as a function of enzyme concentration to obtain the maximal cleavage rate (kcl) and K Dapp from a fit to Equation 1, which applies to the minimal cleavage mechanisms shown in Scheme 1 or 2 under “Discussion.”kobs=kcl[E]KDapp+[E]Equation 1 The maximal cleavage rate (kcl) will be equal to the intrinsic rate constant for cleavage (kchem, Fig. 1) when there are no internal equilibrium steps (Kint) before cleavage, otherwisekcl = Kinkchem, assuming the equilibrium steps are rapid compared with kchem. The cleavage kinetics for the 18AP/24-mer substrate (Fig. 2) were determined using stopped-flow fluorescence measurements by following the changes in 2-AP fluorescence using an Applied Photophysics instrument in the two-syringe mode. The excitation wavelength was 315 nm, and emission was monitored using a 360 nm cut-off filter. The cleavage rate measurements were made using pseudo-first-order conditions, where the concentration of the 18AP/24-mer was 10-fold less than the enzyme. For these measurements, the labeled DNA concentration was 10 or 25 nm, and the concentration of topoisomerase was varied in the range 0.1 to 1.2 μm. The data were fitted to a single exponential rate equation to obtain the observed rate constants, which were then plotted against the topoisomerase concentration and fitted to Equation 1 to obtain kcl and K Dapp. Religation experiments were performed by rapidly mixing the preformed covalent complex with an excess of the 12-mer ligation strand. The covalent complex was first formed by incubating topoisomerase (330 nm) with 5′-32P-labeled 18/24-mer (300 nm) for 30 min to quantitatively form the E-12/24-mer covalent complex. The religation reactions were initiated by rapid mixing of equal volumes of the covalent complex with the complementary 12-mer (Fig. 2), and the reactions were quenched by the addition of 10% SDS. The final concentrations of the covalent complex and 12-mer were 20 nm and 2 μm, respectively. The E-12/24-mer covalent complex and the 24/24-mer religation product were separated by electrophoresis using a 15% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel containing SDS. Under these dilute conditions we would expect that ∼90% of the covalently bound DNA would religate. However, only 70 ± 10% of the DNA in the covalent complex was rapidly converted to full-length ligation product, possibly due to some nonproductive binding of the 12-mer strand. The fractional extent of covalent complex remaining at a given time (frac complex = cpm complex/total cpm) was quantified using the ImageReader version 1.75 software and then normalized to the observed end point (frac complex∞). Thus in Equation 2, Frac complexnorm = Frac complex/Frac complex∞, where kr is the religation rate constant. Frac complexnorm=exp−krtEquation 2 The equilibrium cleavage measurements were performed using Buffer A by titrating 5′-32P-labeled 40/40-mer or 24/24-mer (10–100 nm) with increasing concentrations of wild-type topoisomerase (10–1500 nm). In these titrations it was found that high concentrations of covalent complex (>0.6 μm) inhibited the further formation of covalent complex. Thus the end points (Kcl) were determined by small extrapolation using concentrations of topoisomerase less than 0.6 μm. These extrapolations were typically quite small, and do not appreciably influence the certainty in the reportedKcl values. The covalent complex was trapped by the rapid addition of 1 volume of 10% SDS, and the free and covalently bound DNA were separated by electrophoresis using an 18% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.2% SDS. The fraction covalent complex (Frac complex = counts covalent complex/(counts covalent complex + counts free DNA)) was plotted against the total topoisomerase concentration and fitted to Equation 3, which describes the reversible two step binding and cleavage mechanism shown in Equation 4. Frac complex=b−b2−4a2[E][S]2a2[S]Equation 3 E+S⇌KDES⇌KclE*−PEquation 4 In this analysis, the counts that migrate as free DNA represent the sum of the counts for DNA that was bound noncovalently to the enzyme and the DNA that was free. In Equation 3, a = 1 + 1/Kcl, and b = a[E] +a[S] +KD/Kcl, where [E] and [S] are the total enzyme and substrate concentrations. Equilibrium titrations of the Y274F mutant with the 18/24-mer or 40/40-mer were performed by monitoring the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the enzyme using a Fluoromax-2 fluorimeter (Instruments S. A. Inc.). All titrations were performed in Buffer A at 25 °C. The measurements were performed by the sequential addition of small portions of a concentrated 18/24-mer or 40/40-mer stock solution into 150 μl of Buffer A containing Y274F (0.4–1.4 μm). The excitation wavelength was 295 nm, and the emission was monitored from 315 to 450 nm. Corrections for the inner filter effect of substrate DNA were performed using Equations 5 and6, A295=ɛ295lcDNAEquation 5 Fco=Fobs×1012A295Equation 6 where A295, ε295,l, cDNA, and F are the absorbance of the DNA, the extinction coefficient at 295 nm, the DNA concentration, and fluorescence intensity, respectively. The corrected fluorescence spectra were used to determine KD using Equation 7, where b = KD + [E]tot + [S]tot, andF0 and Ff are the initial and final corrected fluorescence intensities at 335 nm.F=F0−(F0−Ff)/2[DNA]totb−b2−4([E]tot[DNA]tot)Equation 7 The 2-AP-labeled DNA substrates were used to measure the noncovalent DNA binding affinity of the Y274F mutant. These measurements were performed using the same conditions as described above for the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence measurements except that the DNA concentration was constant, and the Y274F concentration was varied. Spectra were collected from 335 to 450 nm using excitation at 315 nm. Prior to data fitting, the spectra were corrected for the tryptophan fluorescence contribution of the enzyme by subtracting the Y274F spectra obtained in the absence of DNA. The dissociation constant was determined from a fit of the corrected fluorescence intensity at 370 nm against [Y274F] using Equation 7. The association and dissociation rates of the 18/24-mer, 18AP/24-mer, and 40AP/40-mer with the Y274F mutant were determined using stopped-flow fluorescence measurements. The changes in 2-AP or tryptophan fluorescence were followed using an Applied Photophysics instrument in the two-syringe mode. For monitoring the 2-AP changes, the excitation wavelength was 315 nm, and emission was monitored using a 360 nm cut-off filter. For the tryptophan fluorescence changes, the fluorescence was monitored using a 320 nm cut-off filter with excitation at 295 nm. The association rate measurements were made using pseudo-first-order conditions, where the concentration of the limiting species was at least 4-fold less than the varied component. For the 2-AP measurements, the labeled DNA concentration was 100 nm and [Y274F] was varied in the range 0.4 to 1.6 μm. When monitoring the tryptophan fluorescence, the Y274F concentration was fixed at 200 nm,and the DNA was varied in the range 0.8 to 1.6 μm. All kinetic traces from the stopped-flow fluorescence measurements were fitted to a single exponential equation (Equation 8), whereF is the fluorescence intensity, andF0 and kobs are the amplitude and observed rate constant for the fluorescence change. F=Foexp(−kobst)+CEquation 8 The concentration dependences of the observed binding rates were fitted to Equation 9, from which the rate constantskon and koff were obtained from the slope and intercept, respectively. Although a minimal three-state binding mechanism is likely (Fig. 1B), the kinetics will reduce to apparent two-state kinetic behavior when the second conformational step is fast compared with the achievable binding rates, allowing the use of Equation 9 (12Johnson K.A. Enzymes. 1992; 20: 1-61Crossref Scopus (379) Google Scholar).kobs=kon[E]+koffEquation 9 In addition to the estimate of koffobtained from the above analysis, the dissociation rates (koff) were also measured using a trapping protocol. Preformed complexes of Y274F and the 18AP/24-mer or 40AP/40-mer DNA were rapidly mixed in a 1:1 ratio with a large molar excess of competing unlabeled DNA (10 μm), and the time-dependent decrease in 2-AP fluorescence was monitored. The observed off-rate was obtained directly from a fit of the observed fluorescence change to a first-order decay equation (Equation 8). The concentration of the competing trapping DNA was sufficiently high such that the rate-limiting step was dissociation of the complex (not shown). Previous studies of the vaccinia topoisomerase have always been performed using low salt concentrations (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5 or pH 8.0). Under these nonphysiological conditions, the enzyme-DNA complex is extremely stable (KD <5 nm) making it difficult to study DNA binding and the concentration dependence of the kinetic parameters. Therefore, to enable the use of fluorescence methods, we investigated the kinetic activity of topoisomerase using higher salt concentrations with the goal of increasing the KD value by ionic screening. By using substrates such as the 18/24-mer allows the cleavage reaction to be studied using irreversible conditions because the 6*-mer product spontaneously dissociates making religation extremely inefficient (10Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar,11Stivers J.T. Jagadeesh G.J. Nawrot B. Stec W.J. Shuman S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5561-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Under the new high salt conditions (20 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl at pH 8.0 at 25 °C), the maximal single turnover cleavage rate for the 18/24-mer was identical to that measured at low salt concentrations (Fig. 3,kcl = 0.62 s−1) (11Stivers J.T. Jagadeesh G.J. Nawrot B. Stec W.J. Shuman S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5561-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, the presence of 200 mm NaCl was found to increase the apparentKD for single turnover DNA cleavage by over 50-fold (Fig. 4A, K Dapp = 220 ± 60 nm). As shown in Fig. 4B, the observed rate of religation (kr = 0.61 s−1) was somewhat smaller than that measured previously using the low salt buffer (kr = 0.90 s−1). Assuming that cleavage and religation may be approximated by a simple two-state equilibrium as observed previously at low salt concentrations (11Stivers J.T. Jagadeesh G.J. Nawrot B. Stec W.J. Shuman S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5561-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the ratio ofkcl/kr gives the cleavage equilibrium constant K clcalc = 1.02 ± 0.26. This calculated value is within error of theKK clcalc value determined from equilibrium quench experiments (see below), indicating that the two-state approximation applies at high salt concentration as well. The complete kinetic parameters for cleavage and religation of the 18/24-mer using these high salt conditions are listed in TableI.Figure 4Single turnover cleavage, religation, and cleavage equilibrium measurements using high salt conditions.A, concentration dependence of kobsfor cleavage of the 18*/24-mer by wild-type topoisomerase (wt topo).

Open table in a new tab The parameters were determined at 25 °C in Buffer A containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, at 25 °C. To confirm the calculated value for Kcl obtained from the kinetic measurements, we also performed equilibrium quench experiments using the 40/40-mer and 24/24-mer substrates. These substrates show reversible cleavage and religation because the leaving strands are a 20-mer or 12-mer, respectively, and thus do not dissociate from the covalent complex (11Stivers J.T. Jagadeesh G.J. Nawrot B. Stec W.J. Shuman S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5561-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this experiment, a fixed concentration of DNA is titrated with increasing concentrations of enzyme, and the binding and cleavage reactions are allowed to reach equilibrium. The reactions are then rapidly quenched with the addition of an equal volume solution containing 10% SDS. The free DNA and covalent complex are separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the fraction covalent complex (Frac complex) is determined by quantification of the phosphorimage of the gel (Fig. 4C). As shown under “Experimental Procedures,” we have derived the analytical solution for the coupled equilibria for DNA binding and cleavage (Equations 3 and 4) and can calculate the KD for noncovalent binding and the internal equilibrium constant for cleavage (Kcl) from the concentration dependence of covalent complex formation (Fig.4C). From these data, the Kcl values for the 40/40-mer and 24/24-mer were found to be very similar (Kcl = 0.9–1.0, see Table II) and were in good agreement with the calculated Kcl obtained from the ratio of rate constants kcl/kr. The KD value for noncovalent DNA binding as obtained from a fit of the data to Equation 3 was 190 and 160 nm for the 40/40-mer and 24/24-mer, respectively. These KDvalues for the wild-type enzyme are in good agreement with K Dapp for single turnover cleavage and the KD values for noncovalent DNA binding by Y274F (see below).Table IICleavage equilibrium constants and equilibrium dissociation constants for wild-type topoisomerase determined from equilibrium quench experiments2-aThe measurements were performed at 25 °C in Buffer A.

Open table in a new tab To determine the noncovalent binding affinity of Y274F for the DNA, we performed titrations in which the changes in 2-AP or tryptophan fluorescence of the DNA or enzyme were followed. Titration of the 40AP/40-mer or 18AP/24-mer with increasing concentrations of Y274F results in a 2- and 1.8-fold increase in fluorescence intensity at 370 nm (Fig. 5, A andB), which could be fit to Equation 4 to obtainKD values of 240 and 200 nm, respectively. A similar KD = 250 ± 60 nm was measured for the 18/24-mer when quenching of the tryptophan fluorescence signal was being followed (Fig.6 and TableIII). The increase in 2-AP fluorescence intensity suggests that the 2-AP base becomes less stacked upon noncovalent binding, because 2-AP fluorescence increases greatly when its stacking interactions with other bases are diminished (see Refs.13Stivers J.T.

To establish that no gross enzyme aggregation was occurring during these titrations, dynamic light scattering experiments were performed on the free Y274F and its complex with the 18/24-mer in the concentration range 1–10 μm. These data were analyzed with respect to the hydrodynamic radius and polydispersity of the solute. In this concentration range the results were consistent with a monomeric enzyme, or a 1:1 complex of enzyme and DNA (data not shown).Figure 6Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence measurements of noncovalent DNA binding by Y274F.A, changes in the tryptophan fluorescence spectrum of 0.4 μmY274F upon sequential addition of 0–3 μm 18/24-mer.B, the corrected fluorescence intensity at 335 nm is plotted as a function of the substrate DNA concentration.

https://openalex.org/W2115150920,A steady-state kinetic mechanism describing the interaction of M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and the guanine nucleotide-binding protein Giα2β1γ3are presented. Data are consistent with two parallel pathways of agonist-promoted GTPase activity arising from receptor coupled to a single or multiple guanine nucleotide-binding proteins. An aspartate 103 to asparagine receptor mutation resulted in a receptor lacking the ability to catalyze the binding of guanosine-5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) or guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis by the G protein. An aspartate 69 to asparagine receptor mutant was able to catalyze agonist-specific guanine nucleotide exchange and GTPase activity. A threonine 187 to alanine receptor mutation resulted in a receptor that catalyzed guanine nucleotide exchange comparable with wild-type receptors but had reduced ability to stimulate GTP hydrolysis. A tyrosine 403 to phenylalanine receptor mutation resulted in an increase in agonist-promoted GTPAse activity compared with wild type. The observation that the threonine 187 and tyrosine 403 mutants promote guanine nucleotide exchange similarly to wild type but alter GTPase activity compared with wild type suggests that the effects of the mutations arise downstream from guanine nucleotide exchange and may result from changes in receptor-G protein dissociation.
