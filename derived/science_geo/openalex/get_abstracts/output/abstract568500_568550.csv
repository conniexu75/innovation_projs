https://openalex.org/W2520969273,"Thermoregulation is one of the most vital functions of the brain, but how temperature information is converted into homeostatic responses remains unknown. Here, we use an unbiased approach for activity-dependent RNA sequencing to identify warm-sensitive neurons (WSNs) within the preoptic hypothalamus that orchestrate the homeostatic response to heat. We show that these WSNs are molecularly defined by co-expression of the neuropeptides BDNF and PACAP. Optical recordings in awake, behaving mice reveal that these neurons are selectively activated by environmental warmth. Optogenetic excitation of WSNs triggers rapid hypothermia, mediated by reciprocal changes in heat production and loss, as well as dramatic cold-seeking behavior. Projection-specific manipulations demonstrate that these distinct effectors are controlled by anatomically segregated pathways. These findings reveal a molecularly defined cell type that coordinates the diverse behavioral and autonomic responses to heat. Identification of these warm-sensitive cells provides genetic access to the core neural circuit regulating the body temperature of mammals.PaperClip/cms/asset/355b85c9-1440-46fd-b75d-f17e284a3a0f/mmc2.mp3Loading ...(mp3, 2.63 MB) Download audio"

https://openalex.org/W2520191692,"Bacterial type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a nanomachine that works similarly to a speargun. Rapid contraction of a sling (sheath) drives a long shaft (Hcp) with a sharp tip and associated effectors through the target cell membrane. We show that the amount and composition of the tip regulates initiation of full-length sheath assembly and low amount of available Hcp decreases sheath length. Importantly, we show that both tip and Hcp are exchanged by T6SS among by-standing cells within minutes of initial cell-cell contact. The translocated proteins are reused for new T6SS assemblies suggesting that tip and Hcp reach the cytosol of target cells. The efficiency of protein translocation depends on precise aiming of T6SS at the target cells. This interbacterial protein complementation can support T6SS activity in sister cells with blocked protein synthesis and also allows cooperation between strains to increase their potential to kill competition.

https://openalex.org/W2519895466,"Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is regarded as a crucial contributing factor to cancer progression. Diverse factors have been identified as potent EMT inducers in ovarian cancer. However, molecular mechanism sustaining EMT of ovarian cancer cells remains elusive. Here we show that the presence of SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 complex is critical for sustained EMT traits of ovarian cancer cells. Consistent with the role of SOS1/EPS8/ABI1 complex as a Rac1-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, depleting Rac1 results in the loss of most of mesenchymal traits in mesenchymal-like ovarian cancer cells, whereas expressing constitutively active Rac1 leads to EMT in epithelial-like ovarian cancer cells. With the aid of clinically tested inhibitors targeting various EMT-associated signaling pathways, we show that only combined treatment of mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) and Src inhibitors can abolish constitutively active Rac1-led EMT and mesenchymal traits displayed by mesenchymal-like ovarian cancer cells. Further experiments also reveal that EMT can be induced in epithelial-like ovarian cancer cells by co-expressing constitutively active MEK1 and Src rather than either alone. As the activities of Erk and Src are higher in ovarian cancer cells with constitutively active Rac1, we conclude that Rac1 sustains ovarian cancer cell EMT through simultaneous activation of MEK1/2 and Src signaling pathways. Importantly, we demonstrate that combined use of MEK1/2 and Src inhibitors effectively suppresses development of intraperitoneal xenografts and prolongs the survival of ovarian cancer-bearing mice. This study suggests that cocktail of MEK1/2 and Src inhibitors represents an effective therapeutic strategy against ovarian cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2520792892,"Blood pressure regulation is known to be maintained by a neuro-endocrine circuit, but whether immune cells contribute to blood pressure homeostasis has not been determined. We previously showed that CD4+ T lymphocytes that express choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), which catalyzes the synthesis of the vasorelaxant acetylcholine, relay neural signals. Here we show that these CD4+CD44hiCD62Llo T helper cells by gene expression are a distinct T-cell population defined by ChAT (CD4 TChAT). Mice lacking ChAT expression in CD4+ cells have elevated arterial blood pressure, compared to littermate controls. Jurkat T cells overexpressing ChAT (JTChAT) decreased blood pressure when infused into mice. Co-incubation of JTChAT and endothelial cells increased endothelial cell levels of phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and of nitrates and nitrites in conditioned media, indicating increased release of the potent vasorelaxant nitric oxide. The isolation and characterization of CD4 TChAT cells will enable analysis of the role of these cells in hypotension and hypertension, and may suggest novel therapeutic strategies by targeting cell-mediated vasorelaxation."

As the transcription activity of the oocyte is silenced at the fully grown stage and the global genome is reactivated only by the mid-blastula embryo stage, the translation of maternal mRNAs accumulated during oocyte growth should be accurately regulated. Previous evidence has illustrated that the poly(A) tail length and RNA binding elements mediate RNA translation regulation in the oocyte. Recently, RNA methylation has been found to exist in various systems. In this study, we sequenced the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modified mRNAs in fully grown germinal vesicle-stage and metaphase II-stage oocytes. As a result, we identified 4207 mRNAs with m6A peaks in germinal vesicle-stage or metaphase II-stage oocytes. When we integrated the mRNA methylation data with transcriptome and proteome data, we found that the highly methylated mRNAs showed significantly lower protein levels than those of the hypomethylated mRNAs, although the RNA levels showed no significant difference. We also found that the hypomethylated mRNAs were mainly enriched in the cell cycle and translation pathways, whereas the highly methylated mRNAs were mainly associated with protein phosphorylation.

After that, the fully grown GV oocytes resume meiosis and develop to metaphase of the second meiosis (MII) stage. Then the oocyte is fertilized by sperm to form a zygote. The zygote starts mitosis, and embryo development is initiated. As embryo genomic transcription is not reactivated until embryo development to the mid-blastula stage for X. laevis (3.Lee M.T.

Biol. 2016; 23: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), oocytes or embryos need the maternal RNAs accumulated during oocyte growth to support new protein synthesis. As the synthesis of new proteins such as cyclins is of importance for the meiotic and mitotic events, the translation of maternal mRNAs during oocyte meiotic maturation and early embryo development should be precisely controlled. Previous data have shown that there are mainly two methods for cells to control the maternal mRNA translation in oocyte or early embryo protein binding to the cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPEs) in maternal mRNAs and controlling the polyadenylation of the mRNA poly(A) tails (8.Radford H.E. Meijer H.A. de Moor C.H. Translational control by cytoplasmic polyadenylation in Xenopus oocytes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1779: 217-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In most cases, shortened poly(A) tails of mRNAs repress their translation, whereas elongated poly(A) tails activate translation (9.Stebbins-Boaz B. Hake L.E. Richter J.D. CPEB controls the cytoplasmic polyadenylation of cyclin, Cdk2 and c-mos mRNAs and is necessary for oocyte maturation in Xenopus.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2582-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The poly(A) tail length of oocyte mRNA is mainly associated with cytoplasmic polyadenylation, which is controlled by RNA binding proteins and associated proteins. The maternal mRNAs, whose 3′ UTR contains a cis-element CPE, could be bonded by CPE binding protein (CPEB) (10.Hake L.E. Richter J.D. CPEB is a specificity factor that mediates cytoplasmic polyadenylation during Xenopus oocyte maturation.Cell. 1994; 79: 617-627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). When CPEB is phosphorylated under stimulation of progesterone, it recruits and binds to the cleavage and polyadenylation-specific factor. The cleavage and polyadenylation-specific factor then recruits poly(A) polymerase to the mRNA end and mediates poly(A) tail elongation and promotes mRNA translation (11.Mendez R. Murthy K.G. Ryan K.

In addition to the poly(A) tail and CPE-mediated mRNA translation regulation, recent evidence revealed a correlation between RNA translation and an RNA-specific modification called N6-methyladenosine (m6A) (12.Zhou J. Wan J. Gao X. Zhang X. Jaffrey S.R. Qian S.B.

Gene expression regulation mediated through reversible m6A RNA methylation.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2014; 15: 293-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). It has been shown that m6A modifications have different effects on mRNA translation when the m6A modifications occur at different regions of the mRNAs (14.Lee M. Kim B. Kim V.N.

RNA methylation at the 5′ UTR could promote mRNA translation, whereas RNA methylation at the last exons participated in the 3′ UTR regulation of mRNAs (15.Ke S. Alemu E.A. Mertens C. Gantman E.C.

By knocking out the m6Awriter Mettl3, mRNA methylation was also found to play important roles in other cellular events such as cell differentiation and RNA degradation (17.Geula S. Moshitch-Moshkovitz S. Dominissini D. Mansour A.A. Kol N. Salmon-Divon M. Hershkovitz V. Peer E. Mor N. Manor Y.S. Ben-Haim M.S. Eyal E. Yunger S. Pinto Y. Jaitin D.A. Viukov S. et al.Stem cells. m6A mRNA methylation facilitates resolution of naive pluripotency toward differentiation.Science. 2015; 347: 1002-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). As transcription is silenced in fully grown oocytes and early embryos, mRNA translation regulation is essential for biological events during this period. To investigate whether m6Amodification takes part in RNA translation regulation in the X. laevis oocyte and its potential roles in oocyte maturation and embryo development, we sequenced m6A-modified mRNAs in fully grown GV-stage and MII-stage X. laevis oocytes and compared the m6A-seq data with the transcriptome and proteome data. m6A-modified mRNAs of GV- and MII-stage oocytes from X. laevis (supplemental Fig. S1) were isolated and analyzed according to the methods described by Dominissini et al. (18.Dominissini D. Moshitch-Moshkovitz S. Salmon-Divon M. Amariglio N. Rechavi G. Transcriptome-wide mapping of N6-methyladenosine by m6A-seq based on immunocapturing and massively parallel sequencing.Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8: 176-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). After mapping the methylated RNA fragments to the transcriptome of X. laevis (X. laevis v7.1 from Xenbase) (19.Karpinka J.B. Fortriede J.D. Burns K.A. James-Zorn C. Ponferrada V.G. Lee J. Karimi K. Zorn A.M. Vize P.D. Xenbase, the Xenopus model organism database: new virtualized system, data types and genomes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: D756-D763Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we found that 4207 mRNAs (4128 in GV oocytes and 3820 in MII oocytes) were methylated in GV- or MII-stage oocytes (supplemental Dataset S1). According to the height of the m6Apeaks, we divided these mRNAs into three classes: m6A high mRNAs, m6A medium mRNAs, and m6A low mRNAs. From these results we found that the m6A modification was maintained in 1674 mRNAs during oocyte maturation from GV to MII stage, but in 2400 mRNAs the m6A levels were decreased, and in 133 mRNAs the m6A levels were increased (Fig. 1A). Using the m6A peak-corresponding mRNA sequences, we predicted the conservative m6Amotifs in X. laevis oocytes. As described for human and mouse cells, mRNA methylation in X. laevis oocytes also occurred at the GGACU motifs (Fig. 1B). By analyzing the m6A peak positions along the mRNAs, we found that the m6A peaks were mainly distributed downstream of the coding DNA sequence (CDS) start sites and around the CDS end sites (Fig. 1C). To analyze the association between m6A peak height and mRNA level in oocytes, we integrated the m6A-seq data with the transcriptome data published by Charlier et al. (20.Charlier C. Montfort J. Chabrol O. Brisard D. Nguyen T. Le Cam A. Richard-Parpaillon L. Moreews F. Pontarotti P. Uzbekova S. Chesnel F. Bobe J. Oocyte-somatic cells interactions, lessons from evolution.BMC Genomics. 2012; 13: 560Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). From the transcriptome data, we found 1030 genes with detected m6A modifications. The m6A levels of these genes decreased from GV stage to MII stage (p < 0.01, supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). In addition, we also found that there was no obvious relativity between the m6A peak heights and the mRNA levels (supplemental Fig. S2, C and D). Next we compared the ratios of m6A peak height/mRNA level in GV and MII oocytes and found that most ratios of m6A peak height/mRNA level were decreased from GV stage to MII stage (supplemental Fig. S2, E–H). To know whether RNA methylation participates in oocyte maturation and embryo development, we analyzed the m6A -modified, mRNA-enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways through the DAVID tools (21.Huang da W Sherman B.T. Lempicki R.A. Systematic and integrative analysis of large gene lists using DAVID bioinformatics resources.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (25477) Google Scholar). From the results (supplemental Dataset S2), we could see that the highly or moderately methylated mRNAs mainly enriched in pathways like ErbB signaling, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, and cell cycle. However, the hypomethylated mRNAs mainly enriched in pathways like RNA degradation, DNA replication, ribosome, spliceosome, pentose phosphate pathway, and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. To further assess the biological functions of these m6A-modified mRNAs in Xenopus oocytes, we annotated the Xenopus mRNAs using BLAST on the Biocloud platform. From the gene ontology annotation results, we could find that the oocyte m6A-modified mRNAs were mainly associated with biological processes like transcription, protein phosphorylation, and cell division. Interestingly, in the m6A-modified mRNAs, there were 443 whose proteins had ATP binding functions, and 354 had zinc ion binding functions (supplemental Dataset S3). To investigate whether mRNA methylation is related to mRNA translation, we integrated our mRNA methylation data and the transcriptome and proteome data from Smits et al. (22.Smits A.H. Lindeboom R.G. Perino M. van Heeringen S.J. Veenstra G.J. Vermeulen M. Global absolute quantification reveals tight regulation of protein expression in single Xenopus eggs.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 9880-9891Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the transcriptome and proteome data, Smits et al. (22.Smits A.H. Lindeboom R.G. Perino M. van Heeringen S.J. Veenstra G.J. Vermeulen M. Global absolute quantification reveals tight regulation of protein expression in single Xenopus eggs.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 9880-9891Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) revealed the RNA and protein levels in the egg and embryo (supplemental Fig. S1) of X. laevis. Through BLAST, the information of 723 m6A-modified mRNAs were identified in the RNA/protein profile data. From the profile data, we found that the RNA levels (log10 RNA RPKM values) of high m6A peak mRNAs, detected in GV or MII stage oocytes, were higher than the levels of the total RNAs (in eggs or embryos); however, the protein levels (log10 protein amount/femtomole) were lower than the levels of total proteins (Fig. 2). Compared with the highly methylated mRNAs, the hypomethylated RNAs showed significantly higher protein levels (Fig. 3; p values shown in supplemental Dataset S4). These results suggest that m6A modification may be associated with mRNA translation in oocytes or even in early embryos.FIGURE 3.Boxplot of the RNA levels and protein levels of m6A-modified mRNAs. A and B, the RNA (A) and protein (B) levels of mRNAs with different m6A modification levels. m6A high, medium, and low represent mRNAs that were methylated with high, medium, or low rates. The p values are listed in supplemental Dataset S4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To analyze whether the mRNA positions (5′ UTR, CDS, and 3′ UTR) of RNA methylation are associated with translation, we extracted mRNAs whose m6A modification only occurred at the 5′ UTR, 5′-terminal CDS, 3′-terminal CDS, or 3′ UTR from the highly methylated RNAs in GV oocytes (Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. S3). In Fig. 4 we can see that the mRNAs whose 5′-terminal CDSs or 3′-terminal CDSs were methylated showed lower protein levels compared with the other sets. In addition, mRNAs whose m6A modification occurred at the 3′ UTR, in contrast, showed higher median protein levels (p values are shown in supplemental Dataset S4). These results suggest that CDS region RNA methylation may suppress mRNA translation. In addition, we also integrated our data with the X. laevis embryo (supplemental Fig. S1) proteome data published by Peshkin et al. (23.Peshkin L. Wühr M. Pearl E. Haas W. Freeman Jr., R.M. Gerhart J.C. Klein A.M. Horb M. Gygi S.P. Kirschner M.W. On the relationship of protein and mRNA dynamics in vertebrate embryonic development.Dev. Cell. 2015; 35: 383-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). As a result, we also found that the hypermethylated RNAs in eggs have a lower protein concentration distribution. As for the hypermethylated RNAs, these RNAs, whose m6A modification mainly occurred in CDS regions, showed a lower protein level distribution (supplemental Fig. S4). From the protein profile data calculated by Peshkin et al. (23.Peshkin L. Wühr M. Pearl E. Haas W. Freeman Jr., R.M. Gerhart J.C. Klein A.M. Horb M. Gygi S.P. Kirschner M.W. On the relationship of protein and mRNA dynamics in vertebrate embryonic development.Dev. Cell. 2015; 35: 383-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we found that hypermethylated RNAs showed a lower protein synthesis rate (supplemental Fig. S5). When X. laevis oocytes develop to the fully grown GV stage, their transcription activity is silenced. After maturation (about 6 h), MII-stage oocytes are fertilized by spermatozoa, and the oocytes are transformed into fertilized eggs. The fertilized eggs then develop to mid-blastula stage embryos (50–90 min), at which stage the embryonic genome is reactivated, and global transcription is initiated. From the fully grown GV oocytes to the mid-blastula embryos, oocyte maturation and embryo development mainly rely on the maternal factors accumulated in oocytes (24.Heasman J. Patterning the early Xenopus embryo.Development. 2006; 133: 1205-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). For oocyte mRNAs, their translation is controlled strictly to satisfy the development requirements. Previous evidence showed that oocyte mRNA translation is controlled by two mechanisms: poly(A) tail length-correlated translation efficiency and 3′ UTR element-mediated mRNA translation activation. Recently, evidence suggested a possible association of translation with RNA methylation (12.Zhou J. Wan J. Gao X. Zhang X. Jaffrey S.R. Qian S.B.

Gregory R.I. The m(6)A methyltransferase METTL3 promotes translation in human cancer cells.Mol. Cell. 2016; 62: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar), indicating that the 5′ UTR m6A modification could initiate the translation of non-capped mRNAs. Through integrating the m6A-seq data and transcriptome/proteome data in X. laevis, we investigated m6A modification and possible roles of oocyte mRNAs. We found that mRNAs in which the CDS region was m6A-modified showed low protein levels, but mRNA with an m6A-modified 3′ UTR showed high protein levels. Our results suggest that RNA methylation is involved in RNA translation regulation in X. laevis oocyte maturation and further embryo development. Thus, we reveal a mechanism regulating maternal mRNA dormancy or translation in early development. Our data also suggest that m6A may play different roles according to their positions. The correlation of CDS region m6A modification and low protein level may suggest that m6A modification represses the translation elongation of mRNAs. Our results also showed a decrease in RNA methylation during oocyte development from the GV stage to MII stage. As there was no transcription activity in these oocytes, we inferred that there were two events that may induce this RNA methylation decrease: active RNA demethylation and RNA degradation in the MII stage. The RNA methylation pattern changes during oocyte meiosis may also be a mechanism for the oocyte to control mRNA translation. Recent evidence has shown that, in addition to Mettl3, there were other enzymes, like Mettl14 (26.Liu J. Yue Y. Han D. Wang X. Fu Y. Zhang L. Jia G. Yu M. Lu Z. Deng X. Dai Q. Chen W. He C.

These findings suggest that the regulation of RNA methylation in eukaryotic cells is finely regulated through these m6A modification-associated factors. Microarray data about mouse oocyte development (32.Pan H. O'Brien M.J. Wigglesworth K. Eppig J.J. Schultz R.M. Transcript profiling during mouse oocyte development and the effect of gonadotropin priming and development in vitro.Dev.

In any case, the functions of these m6A-associated enzymes and cofactors should be further analyzed to reveal the regulation of RNA methylation in oocytes and their biological functions. In our study, we found numerous oocyte meiosis- and early embryo development-associated genes whose mRNAs are methylated. For example, cyclin B2 (ccnb2) is required for X. laevis oocyte bipolar spindle formation, and evidence showed that its protein levels increased in MII-stage oocytes (33.Yoshitome S. Furuno N.

Our data showed that the m6A modification in ccnb2 and mos mRNAs decreased in the 3′ terminal of the CDS region but showed no obvious change at the 5′ UTR (supplemental Fig. S6). cdt1, whose m6A modification decreased at the CDS region, has been proven to play roles in DNA replication in embryos (37.Narasimhachar Y.

Feeding and handling of X. laevis were conducted in accordance with the Animal Research Committee policies of the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Sexually mature X. laevis females were injected with 50 IU of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin 5 days before collection of GV-stage oocytes. Before the surgery, the X. laevis was buried under ice for about 30 min until it reached complete anesthesia. After making a small incision off the middle line of the belly, a part of the ovary was removed with forceps and scissors and placed in M199-HEPES medium. We then sutured the incision and let the X. laevis recover under a moist tissue until fully awake, and then individuals were submerged in water supplemented with penicillin. The excised ovary was cut into small pieces and transferred to a 50-ml tube containing 40 ml of M199-HEPES with 0.2% collagenase type I 4These oocytes were washed with fresh M199-HEPES and aliquoted in 1.5-ml tubes. After snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen, these oocytes were stored at −80 °C until use. For the ovulation of MII eggs, the X. laevis was injected with 500 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin. After ovulation, we collected the healthy MII oocytes and aliquoted the oocytes in 1.5-ml tubes. After snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen, these oocytes were stored at −80 °C until use. Total RNAs of GV- or MII-stage oocytes were extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies). To avoid DNA contamination, all samples were treated with Turbo DNase (Life Technologies). RNA samples were chemically fragmented into about 100-nt fragments by incubating in fragmentation buffer (10 mm ZnCl2 and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7)) for 15 min at 94 °C. The fragmentation reaction was stopped by adding 0.05 m EDTA, and the RNAs were collected by standard ethanol precipitation. m6A sequencing was performed as described previously Dominissini et al.

Briefly, 200 μl of protein A bead slurry (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was blocked by incubating at room temperature for 1 h with 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Igepal CA-630, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)) supplemented with 50 mg/ml BSA and 200 units of RNasin (Promega). Then the fragmented RNAs (3 mg) were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with 50 μl of blocked protein A beads to reduce nonspecific binding. After centrifugation at 4 °C, 2500 × g for 3 min, we collected the RNA supernatant and incubated it at 4 °C for 2 h with 12.5 μg of purified rabbit anti-m6A polyclonal antibody (Synaptic Systems). The RNA/antibody mixture was incubated with 50 μl of blocked protein A beads for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing, the bound RNAs were eluted by competition with 0.5 mg/ml N6-methyladenosine (Sigma-Aldrich). The eluted RNAs were precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in nuclease-free water. Finally, the RNA library was generated with an mRNA sequencing kit (Illumina) and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. The raw data of the sequencing reads were uploaded to the sequence read archive (accession no. SRR3667693).

Prebiotics and probiotics can modulate microbiome changes induced by aging; however, their effects have not been directly compared. The aim of this study was to use anaerobic batch culture fermenters to assess the impact of various fermentable carbohydrates and microorganisms on the gut microbiota and selected immune markers. Elderly volunteers were used as donors for these experiments to enable relevance to an aging population. The impact of fermentation supernatants on immune markers relevant to the elderly were assessed in vitro. Levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-α in peripheral blood mononuclear cell culture supernatants were measured using flow cytometry. Trans-galactooligosaccharides (B-GOS) and inulin both stimulated bifidobacteria compared to other treatments (p<0.05). Fermentation supernatants taken from faecal batch cultures supplemented with B-GOS, inulin, B. bifidum, L. acidophilus and Ba. coagulans inhibited LPS induced TNF-α (p<0.05). IL-10 production, induced by LPS, was enhanced by fermentation supernatants from faecal batch cultures supplemented with B-GOS, inulin, B. bifidum, L. acidophilus, Ba. coagulans and Bac. thetaiotaomicron (p<0.05). To conclude, prebiotics and probiotics could lead to potentially beneficial effects to host health by targeting specific bacterial groups, increasing saccharolytic fermentation and decreasing inflammation associated with aging. Compared to probiotics, prebiotics led to greater microbiota modulation at the genus level within the fermenters."
https://openalex.org/W2520268531,"Galectin-3 (Gal-3) has been implicated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and its candidacy as a therapeutic target has been evaluated. Gal-3 is widely upregulated in tumors, and its expression is associated with the development and malignancy of PDAC. In the present study, we demonstrate that a polysaccharide, RN1, purified from the flower of Panax notoginseng binds to Gal-3 and suppresses its expression. In addition, RN1 markedly inhibits PDAC cells growth in vitro, in vivo and in patient-derived xenografts. Mechanistically, RN1 binds to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Gal-3, thereby disrupting the interaction between Gal-3 and EGFR and downregulating extracellular-related kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and the transcription factor of Gal-3, Runx1 expression. Inhibiting the expression of Runx1 by RN1, suppresses Gal-3 expression and inactivates Gal-3-associated signaling pathways, including the EGFR/ERK/Runx1, BMP/smad/Id-3 and integrin/FAK/JNK signaling pathways. In addition, RN1 can also bind to bone morphogenetic protein receptors (BMPR1A and BMPR2) and block the interaction between Gal-3 and the BMPRs. Thus, our results suggest that a novel Gal-3 inhibitor RN1 may be a potential candidate for human PDAC treatment via multiple targets and multiple signaling pathways."

Protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2) is an emerging new target expressed on liver stellate cells and hepatocytes that regulates the response to liver injury and inflammation. Here, we identified a pepducin to block the deleterious actions of PAR2 in promoting liver fibrosis. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and early fibrosis were induced by the methionine-choline-deficient diet in mice. Fibrotic liver disease was induced by administering carbon tetrachloride for 8 weeks. Mice were treated with the pepducin PZ-235 either from onset of the experiment or after fibrosis was established. Hepatic fibrosis, collagen content, inflammatory cytokines, steatosis, triglycerides, and NAFLD activity score were assessed as primary outcome parameters depending on the model. The activity of the PAR2 pepducin on cultured stellate cell activation and hepatocyte reactive oxygen species production was evaluated. PZ-235 significantly suppressed liver fibrosis, collagen deposition, inflammatory cytokines, NAFLD activity score, steatosis, triglycerides, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and stellate cell proliferation by up to 50–100%. The PAR2 inhibitor afforded significant protective effects against hepatocellular necrosis and attenuated PAR2-mediated reactive oxygen species production in hepatocytes. PZ-235 was distributed to liver and other mouse tissues and was found to form a well structured α-helix that closely resembles the juxtamembrane helical region of the analogous TM6 and third intracellular region of the intact receptor that is critical for coupling to internal G proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2509810353,"Protein translocation across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane is an essential process catalyzed predominantly by the Sec translocase. This system consists of the membrane-embedded protein-conducting channel SecYEG, the motor ATPase SecA, and the heterotrimeric SecDFyajC membrane protein complex. Previous studies suggest that anionic lipids are essential for SecA activity and that the N terminus of SecA is capable of penetrating the lipid bilayer. The role of lipid binding, however, has remained elusive. By employing differently sized nanodiscs reconstituted with single SecYEG complexes and comprising varying amounts of lipids, we establish that SecA gains access to the SecYEG complex via a lipid-bound intermediate state, whereas acidic phospholipids allosterically activate SecA for ATP-dependent protein translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2518757722,"Human-carnivore conflict is challenging to quantify because it is shaped by both the realities and people's perceptions of carnivore threats. Whether perceptions align with realities can have implications for conflict mitigation: misalignments can lead to heightened and indiscriminant persecution of carnivores whereas alignments can offer deeper insights into human-carnivore interactions. We applied a landscape-scale spatial analysis of livestock killed by tigers and leopards in India to model and map observed attack risk, and surveyed owners of livestock killed by tigers and leopards for their rankings of threats across habitats to map perceived attack risk. Observed tiger risk to livestock was greatest near dense forests and at moderate distances from human activity while leopard risk was greatest near open vegetation. People accurately perceived spatial differences between tiger and leopard hunting patterns, expected greater threat in areas with high values of observed risk for both carnivores. Owners' perception of threats largely did not depend on environmental conditions surrounding their village (spatial location, dominant land-use or observed carnivore risk). Surveys revealed that owners who previously lost livestock to carnivores used more livestock protection methods than those who had no prior losses, and that owners who had recently lost livestock for the first time expressed greater interest in changing their protection methods than those who experienced prior losses. Our findings suggest that in systems where realities and perceptions of carnivore risk align, conservation programs and policies can optimize conservation outcomes by (1) improving the effectiveness of livestock protection methods and (2) working with owners who have recently lost livestock and are most willing to invest effort in adapting protection strategies to mitigate human-carnivore conflict."

In this study, we aim to investigate the hypocholesterolemic effect of tanshinone IIA in hepatic cells. We demonstrated that tanshinone IIA significantly increased the amount of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and LDL uptake activity in HepG2 cells at the post-transcriptional regulation. We further demonstrated that tanshinone IIA inhibited the expression of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) mRNA and mature protein, which may lead to an increase the cell-surface LDLR in hepatic cells. We further identified a regulatory DNA element involved in the tanshinone IIA-mediated PCSK9 down-regulation, which is located between the -411 and -336 positions of the PCSK9 promoter. Moreover, we found that tanshinone IIA markedly increased the nuclear forkhead box O3a (FoxO3a) level, enhanced FoxO3a/PCSK9 promoter complexes formation and decreased the PCSK9 promoter binding capacity of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF-1α), resulting in suppression of PCSK9 gene expression. Finally, we found that the statin-induced PCSK9 overexpression was attenuated and the LDLR activity was elevated in a synergic manner by combination of tanshinone IIA treatment in HepG2 cells. Overall, our results reveal that the tanshinone IIA modulates LDLR level and activity via down-regulation of PCSK9 expression in hepatic cells. Our current findings provide a molecular basis of tanshinone IIA to develop PCSK9 inhibitors for cholesterol management."

https://openalex.org/W2520077896,"Inactivation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor is frequently found in colorectal cancer. Loss of APC function results in deregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway causing overexpression of the c-MYC oncogene. In lymphoma, both p19ARF and ribosomal proteins RPL11 and RPL5 respond to c-MYC activation to induce p53. Their role in c-MYC-driven colorectal carcinogenesis is unclear, as p19ARF deletion does not accelerate APC loss-triggered intestinal tumorigenesis. To determine the contribution of the ribosomal protein (RP)-murine double minute 2 (MDM2)-p53 pathway to APC loss-induced tumorigenesis, we crossed mice bearing MDM2C305F mutation, which disrupts RPL11- and RPL5-MDM2 binding, with Apcmin/+ mice, which are prone to intestinal tumor formation. Interestingly, loss of RP-MDM2 binding significantly accelerated colorectal tumor formation while having no discernable effect on small intestinal tumor formation. Mechanistically, APC loss leads to overexpression of c-MYC, RPL11 and RPL5 in mouse colonic tumor cells irrespective of MDM2C305F mutation. However, notable p53 stabilization and activation were observed only in Apcmin/+;Mdm2+/+ but not Apcmin/+;Mdm2C305F/C305F colon tumors. These data establish that the RP-MDM2-p53 pathway, in contrast to the p19ARF-MDM2-p53 pathway, is a critical mediator of colorectal tumorigenesis following APC loss."
https://openalex.org/W2515424430,"Antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) in clinical development for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) aim to induce skipping of a specific exon of the dystrophin transcript during pre-mRNA splicing. This results in restoration of the open reading frame and consequently synthesis of a dystrophin protein with a shorter yet functional central rod domain. To monitor the molecular therapeutic effect of exon skip-inducing AONs in clinical studies, accurate quantification of pre- and post-treatment exon skip levels is required. With the recent introduction of 3rd generation digital droplet PCR (ddPCR), a state-of-the-art technology became available which allows absolute quantification of transcript copy numbers with and without specific exon skip with high precision, sensitivity and reproducibility. Using Taqman assays with probes targeting specific exon-exon junctions, we here demonstrate that ddPCR reproducibly quantified cDNA fragments with and without exon 51 of the DMD gene over a 4-log dynamic range. In a comparison of conventional nested PCR, qPCR and ddPCR using cDNA constructs with and without exon 51 mixed in different molar ratios using, ddPCR quantification came closest to the expected outcome over the full range of ratios (0-100%), while qPCR and in particular nested PCR overestimated the relative percentage of the construct lacking exon 51. Highest accuracy was similarly obtained with ddPCR in DMD patient-derived muscle cells treated with an AON inducing exon 51 skipping. We therefore recommend implementation of ddPCR for quantification of exon skip efficiencies of AONs in (pre)clinical development for DMD."
https://openalex.org/W2520232853,"Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) causes major outbreaks of hand, foot and mouth disease, and is occasionally associated with neurological complications and death in children. Reverse genetics is widely used in the field of virology for functional study of viral genes. For EV-A71, such tools are limited to clones that are transcriptionally controlled by T7/SP6 bacteriophage promoter. This is often time-consuming and expensive. Here, we describe the development of infectious plasmid DNA-based EV-A71 clones, for which EV-A71 genome expression is under transcriptional control by the CMV-intermediate early promoter and SV40 transcriptional-termination signal. Transfection of this EV-A71 infectious DNA produces good virus yield similar to in vitro-transcribed EV-A71 infectious RNA, 6.4 and 5.8 log10PFU/ml, respectively. Infectious plasmid with enhanced green fluorescence protein and Nano luciferase reporter genes also produced good virus titers, with 4.3 and 5.0 log10 PFU/ml, respectively. Another infectious plasmid with both CMV and T7 promoters was also developed for easy manipulation of in vitro transcription or direct plasmid transfection. Transfection with either dual-promoter infectious plasmid DNA or infectious RNA derived from this dual-promoter clone produced infectious viral particles. Incorporation of hepatitis delta virus ribozyme, which yields precise 3' ends of the DNA-launched EV-A71 genomic transcripts, increased infectious viral production. In contrast, the incorporation of hammerhead ribozyme in the DNA-launched EV-A71 resulted in lower virus yield, but improved the virus titers for T7 promoter-derived infectious RNA. This study describes rapid and robust reverse genetic tools for EV-A71."

In this study, we tried to find the most effective dose of dexmedetomidine to reduce the incidence of emergence agitation in children undergoing strabismus surgery without the complications like oculocardiac reflex (OCR) or postoperative vomiting.We randomized 103 pediatric patients aged 2-6 years and undergoing elective strabismus surgery into four groups. Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane and maintained with desflurane. At the start of induction, dexmedetomidine, delivered at 0.25, 0.5, or 1 μg/kg, or saline was infused intravenously in the D0.25, D0.5, D1 groups, respectively. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of emergence agitation and the secondary outcome measure was the incidence of intraoperative OCR, postoperative vomiting, and desaturation events.The incidence of emergence agitation was 60, 48, 44, and 21% (P = 0.005) and the incidence of intraoperative OCR was 36, 36, 36, and 37% (P = 0.988) in the control, D0.25, D0.5, and D1 groups, respectively. And, postoperative vomiting rate and desaturation events were low in the all groups.Dexmedetomidine decreased the incidence of emergence agitation without increasing intraoperative oculocardiac reflex.

https://openalex.org/W2519111958,"The FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP12) is a cytoplasmic protein and has been reported to possess multiple functions in signaling transduction based on its interaction with different cellular targets. Here, we report that FKBP12 interacts with oncoprotein MDM2 and induces MDM2 degradation. We demonstrate that FKBP12 degrades MDM2 through binding to MDM2 protein, disrupting MDM2/MDM4 interaction and inducing MDM2 self-ubiquitination. The FKBP12-mediated MDM2 degradation was significantly enhanced when the transfected MDM2 was localized in the cytoplasm. The endogenous MDM2, when it was induced by p53 subjecting to DNA-damaging stimuli such as treatment with doxorubicin, was also significantly inhibited by FKBP12. This is due to translocation of p53-induced MDM2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, which facilitates interaction with cytoplasmic FKBP12. Furthermore, the enhanced level of MDM2 following p53 activation in nutlin-3 treated cells was also inhibited by FKBP12. The FKBP12-mediated downregulation of MDM2 in response to doxorubicin or nutlin-3 results in continuing and constitutive activation of p53, inhibition of XIAP and sensitization of cancer cells to apoptosis. These results identify a novel function for FKBP12 in downregulating MDM2, which directly enhances sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy and nutlin-3 treatment."

In the present study we investigated the effect of glucose on CaSR in HEK293 cells stably expressing human CaSR (HEK-CaSR cells). When glucose concentration in the buffer was raised from 3 to 25 mm, a rapid elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) was observed. This elevation was immediate and transient and was followed by a sustained decrease in [Ca2+]c. The effect of glucose was detected at a concentration of 4 mm and reached its maximum at 5 mm. 3-O-Methylglucose, a non-metabolizable analogue of glucose, reproduced the effect of glucose. Sucrose also induced an elevation of [Ca2+]c in HEK-CaSR cells. Similarly, sucralose was nearly as effective as glucose in inducing elevation of [Ca2+]c. Glucose was not able to increase [Ca2+]c in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. The effect of glucose on [Ca2+]c was inhibited by NPS-2143, an allosteric inhibitor of CaSR. In addition, NPS-2143 also inhibited the [Ca2+]c responses to sucralose and sucrose. Glucose as well as sucralose decreased cytoplasmic cAMP concentration in HEK-CaSR cells. The reduction of cAMP induced by glucose was blocked by pertussis toxin. Likewise, sucralose reduced [cAMP]c. Finally, glucose increased [Ca2+]c in PT-r parathyroid cells and in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, both of which express endogenous CaSR.

Sucrose also induced an elevation of [Ca2+]c in HEK-CaSR cells. Similarly, sucralose was nearly as effective as glucose in inducing elevation of [Ca2+]c. Glucose was not able to increase [Ca2+]c in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. The effect of glucose on [Ca2+]c was inhibited by NPS-2143, an allosteric inhibitor of CaSR. In addition, NPS-2143 also inhibited the [Ca2+]c responses to sucralose and sucrose. Glucose as well as sucralose decreased cytoplasmic cAMP concentration in HEK-CaSR cells. The reduction of cAMP induced by glucose was blocked by pertussis toxin. Likewise, sucralose reduced [cAMP]c. Finally, glucose increased [Ca2+]c in PT-r parathyroid cells and in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, both of which express endogenous CaSR. These results indicate that glucose acts as a positive allosteric modulator of CaSR."
https://openalex.org/W2518881225,"Background This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a lay health worker (LHW) telephone intervention on completing a series of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccinations among foreign-born Asian Americans in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan area. Methods During the period of April 2013 and March 2014, we recruited Asian Americans who were 18 years of age and older in the community-based organizations. Of the 645 eligible participants, 600 (201 Chinese, 198 Korean, 201 Vietnamese) completed a pretest survey and received hepatitis B screening. Based on the screening results, we conducted a randomized controlled trial among those unprotected (HBsAg-/HBsAB-) by assigning them either to an intervention group (n = 124) or control group (n = 108). The intervention group received a list of resources by mails for where to get free vaccinations as well as reminder calls for vaccinations from trained LHWs, while the control group received only list of resources by mail. Seven months after mailing the HBV screening results, trained LHWs followed up with all participants by phone to ask how many of the recommended series of 3 vaccinations they had received: none, 1 or 2, or all 3 (complete). Their self-reported vaccinations were verified with the medical records. Multinomial logistic regressions were used to examine the effect of the LHW intervention. Process evaluation was conducted by asking study participants in the intervention group to evaluate the performance of the LHWs. Results After seven months, those in the intervention group were more likely to have 1 or more vaccines than the control group, compared to the no vaccination group (OR = 3.04, 95% CI, 1.16, 8.00). Also, those in the intervention group were more likely to complete a series of vaccinations than the control group, compared to the no vaccination group (OR = 7.29, 95% CI 3.39, 15.67). The most important barrier preventing them from seeking hepatitis B vaccinations was lack of time to get the vaccination. The most important promoters to getting vaccinations, among those who had vaccinations (n = 89), were our intervention program (70.8%) and self-motivation (49.4%). The majority of participants in the intervention group received the phone calls from LHWs (93%) and almost all of them got the reminder to receive vaccines (98%). Conclusion The LHW intervention was successful at increasing HBV vaccinations rates among foreign-born Asian Americans. This study suggests that this culturally integrated intervention program may be useful for reducing liver cancer disparities from chronic HBV infection in high risk Asian Americans.

https://openalex.org/W2520431553,"Multi-species microbial communities play a critical role in human health, industry, and waste remediation. Recently, the evolution of synthetic consortia in the laboratory has enabled adaptation to be addressed in the context of interacting species. Using an engineered bacterial consortium, we repeatedly evolved cooperative genotypes and examined both the predictability of evolution and the phenotypes that determine community dynamics. Eight Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains evolved methionine excretion sufficient to support growth of an Escherichia coli methionine auxotroph, from whom they required excreted growth substrates. Non-synonymous mutations in metA, encoding homoserine trans-succinylase (HTS), were detected in each evolved S. enterica methionine cooperator and were shown to be necessary for cooperative consortia growth. Molecular modeling was used to predict that most of the non-synonymous mutations slightly increase the binding affinity for HTS homodimer formation. Despite this genetic parallelism and trend of increasing protein binding stability, these metA alleles gave rise to a wide range of phenotypic diversity in terms of individual versus group benefit. The cooperators with the highest methionine excretion permitted nearly two-fold faster consortia growth and supported the highest fraction of E. coli, yet also had the slowest individual growth rates compared to less cooperative strains. Thus, although the genetic basis of adaptation was quite similar across independent origins of cooperative phenotypes, quantitative measurements of metabolite production were required to predict either the individual-level growth consequences or how these propagate to community-level behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2518222589,"Recent studies have revealed that social experience affects myelination. These findings have important implications for disorders that feature abnormal myelination, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), as previous studies have shown that psychosocial stress exacerbates the pathobiology of MS. However, most studies have focused on psychosocial stress during the demyelination phase of MSand have not investigated the effects of social experience on remyelination. Thus, the current study sought to determine whether social experience can alter remyelination aftermyelindepletion. Myelininthemousemedialprefrontal cortexwasdepletedwithcuprizone, andthe effects of subsequent social isolation on remyelination were evaluated. Remyelination was severely impaired in socially isolatedmice. Social isolation also increased IL-6 levels in themedialprefrontal cortex, and administrationof an IL-6 inhibitor (ND50 = 0.01–0.03 μg for 0.25 ng/ml IL-6) ameliorated remyelination impairments. Consistent with this result, IL-6 administration (ED50 = 0.02–0.06 ng/ml) disturbed remyelination. In addition, neuron-oligodendrocyte coculture experiments showed that IL-6 treatment (ED50 ≤ 0.02 ng/ml) markedly impeded myelination, which was recoveredwith IL-6 inhibitor administration (ND50 = 0.01–0.03 μg for 0.25 ng/ml IL-6). This study provides the first direct evidence, to our knowledge, that social experience influences remyelination via modulation of IL-6 expression. These findings indicate that psychosocial stress may disturb remyelination through regulation of IL-6 expression in patients with such demyelinating diseases that involve remyelination asMS.—Makinodan, M., Ikawa, D., Miyamoto, Y., Yamauchi, J., Yamamuro, K., Yamashita, Y., Toritsuka, M., Kimoto, S., Okumura, K., Yamauchi, T., Fukami, S., Yoshino, H., Wanaka, A., Kishimoto, T.

The most common mutation in PRCD linked with severe RP phenotype is substitution of the only cysteine to tyrosine (C2Y). In this study, we find that PRCD is post-translationally modified by a palmitoyl lipid group at the cysteine residue linked with RP. Disrupting PRCD palmitoylation either chemically or by genetically eliminating the modified cysteine dramatically affects the stability of PRCD. Furthermore, in vivo electroporation of PRCD C2Y mutant in the mouse retina demonstrates that the palmitoylation of PRCD is important for its proper localization in the photoreceptor OS. Mutant PRCD C2Y was found in the inner segment in contrast to normal localization of WT PRCD in the OS. Our results also suggest that zDHHC3, a palmitoyl acyltransferase (PAT), catalyzes the palmitoylation of PRCD in the Golgi compartment. In conclusion, we find that the palmitoylation of PRCD is crucial for its trafficking to the photoreceptor OS and mislocalization of this protein likely leads to RP-related phenotypes.

RX-3117 has promising antitumor activity in various human tumor xenografts including gemcitabine resistant tumors. RX-3117 is activated by uridine-cytidine kinase (UCK). Since UCK exists in two forms, UCK1 and UCK2, we investigated which form is responsible for RX-3117 phosphorylation. For that purpose we transfected A549 and SW1573 cell lines with UCK-siRNAs. Transfection of UCK1-siRNA efficiently downregulated UCK1-mRNA, but not UCK2-mRNA expression, and did not affect sensitivity to RX-3117. However, transfection of UCK2-siRNA completely downregulated UCK2-mRNA and protein and protected both A549 and SW1573 against RX-3117. UCK enzyme activity in two panels of tumor cell lines and xenograft cells correlated only with UCK2-mRNA expression (r = 0.803 and 0.915, respectively), but not with UCK1-mRNA. Moreover, accumulation of RX-3117 nucleotides correlated with UCK2 expression. In conclusion, RX-3117 is activated by UCK2 which may be used to select patients potentially sensitive to RX-3117."
https://openalex.org/W2514616554,"Excess adipose tissue represents a major risk factor for the development of colon cancer with inflammation and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling being proposed as plausible mechanisms. The aim of this study was to investigate whether obesity can influence circulating levels of inflammation-related extracellular matrix proteins in patients with colon cancer (CC), promoting a microenvironment favorable for tumor growth.Serum samples obtained from 79 subjects [26 lean (LN) and 53 obese (OB)] were used in the study. Enrolled subjects were further subclassified according to the established diagnostic protocol for CC (44 without CC and 35 with CC). Anthropometric measurements as well as circulating metabolites and hormones were determined. Circulating concentrations of the ECM proteins osteopontin (OPN), chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40), tenascin C (TNC) and lipocalin-2 (LCN-2) were determined by ELISA.Significant differences in circulating OPN, YKL-40 and TNC concentrations between the experimental groups were observed, being significantly increased due to obesity (P<0.01) and colon cancer (P<0.05). LCN-2 levels were affected by obesity (P<0.05), but no differences were detected regarding the presence or not of CC. A positive association (P<0.05) with different inflammatory markers was also detected.To our knowledge, we herein show for the first time that obese patients with CC exhibit increased circulating levels of OPN, YKL-40 and TNC providing further evidence for the influence of obesity on CC development via ECM proteins, representing promising diagnostic biomarkers or target molecules for therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2520321386,"The effects of alcoholism on cognitive and motor functioning are heterogeneous. While the role of some factors (patterns of alcohol consumption, eating habits or associated liver disease) has been hypothesized, the origins of this heterogeneity remain difficult to establish. The goals of the present study were thus to identify the clinical and biological risk factors for alcohol-related neuropsychological impairments and to determine the threshold beyond which these risk factors can be considered significant. Thirty alcoholic patients and 15 healthy controls had a blood test and underwent a neuropsychological examination. Alcohol severity measures, and liver, thiamine and malnutrition variables, were included in logistic regression models to determine the risk factors for cognitive and motor impairments (executive functions, visuospatial abilities, verbal episodic memory, ataxia), as well as those related to the severity of patients’ overall neuropsychological profile (moderate or severe impairments). Liver fibrosis was found to be a risk factor for executive impairments and also for ataxia, when it was associated with long-term alcohol misuse and symptoms of withdrawal. Altered thiamine metabolism was solely predictive of verbal episodic memory impairments. This combination of biological abnormalities was associated with a profile of moderate neuropsychological impairments. Malnutrition was associated with a profile of more severe impairments. Malnutrition, altered liver function and thiamine metabolism explain, at least partially, the heterogeneity of alcohol-related neuropsychological impairments. Our findings could allow clinicians to identify patients at particular risk of severe neuropsychological impairments before the onset of irreversible and debilitating neurological complications."

One example of an affected chromosomal region is the gene coding for Nup214, a nucleoporin that localizes to the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). We investigated two such fusion proteins, SET-Nup214 and SQSTM1 (sequestosome)-Nup214, both containing C-terminal portions of Nup214. SET-Nup214 nuclear bodies containing the nuclear export receptor CRM1 were observed in the leukemia cell lines LOUCY and MEGAL. Overexpression of SET-Nup214 in HeLa cells leads to the formation of similar nuclear bodies that recruit CRM1, export cargo proteins, and certain nucleoporins and concomitantly affect nuclear protein and poly(A)+ RNA export. SQSTM1-Nup214, although mostly cytoplasmic, also forms nuclear bodies and inhibits nuclear protein but not poly(A)+ RNA export. The interaction of the fusion proteins with CRM1 is RanGTP-dependent, as shown in co-immunoprecipitation experiments and binding assays. Further analysis revealed that the Nup214 parts mediate the inhibition of nuclear export, whereas the SET or SQSTM1 part determines the localization of the fusion protein and therefore the extent of the effect. SET-Nup214 nuclear bodies are highly mobile structures, which are in equilibrium with the nucleoplasm in interphase and disassemble during mitosis or upon treatment of cells with the CRM1-inhibitor leptomycin B. Strikingly, we found that nucleoporins can be released from nuclear bodies and reintegrated into existing NPC.

https://openalex.org/W2513926687,"Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder that is characterized by a failure of the unfolded protein response in islet β cells with subsequent endoplasmic reticulum stress and cellular death. Thiazolidinediones are insulin sensitizers that activate the nuclear receptor PPAR-γ and have been shown to partially ameliorate autoimmune type 1 diabetes in humans and non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. We hypothesized that thiazolidinediones reduce β cell stress and death independently of insulin sensitivity. To test this hypothesis, female NOD mice were administered pioglitazone during the pre-diabetic phase and assessed for insulin sensitivity and β cell function relative to controls. Pioglitazone-treated mice showed identical weight gain, body fat distribution, and insulin sensitivity compared with controls. However, treated mice showed significantly improved glucose tolerance with enhanced serum insulin levels, reduced β cell death, and increased β cell mass. The effect of pioglitazone was independent of actions on T cells, as pancreatic lymph node T cell populations were unaltered and T cell proliferation was unaffected by pioglitazone. Isolated islets of treated mice showed a more robust unfolded protein response, with increases in Bip and ATF4 and reductions in spliced Xbp1 mRNA. The effect of pioglitazone appears to be a direct action on β cells, as islets from mice treated with pioglitazone showed reductions in PPAR-γ (Ser-273) phosphorylation. Our results demonstrate that PPAR-γ activation directly improves β cell function and survival in NOD mice by enhancing the unfolded protein response and suggest that blockade of PPAR-γ (Ser-273) phosphorylation may prevent type 1 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2516995641,"Vascular endothelial cells can survive under hypoxic and inflammatory conditions by alterations of the cellular energy metabolism. In addition to high rates of glycolysis, glutaminolysis is another important way of providing the required energy to support cellular sprouting in such situations. However, the exact mechanism in which endothelial cells upregulate glutaminolysis remains unclear. Here we demonstrated that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-mediated Raf-MEK-ERK signaling was involved in glutaminolysis in endothelial cells. Using models of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), we observed a dramatic induction in cellular glutamate levels accompanied by Raf-MEK-ERK activation. By addition of U0126, the specific inhibitor of MEK1/2, the expression of kidney-type glutaminase (KGA, a critical glutaminase in glutaminolysis) was significantly decreased. Moreover, inhibition of PP2A by okadaic acid (OA), a specific inhibitor of PP2A phosphatase activity or by depletion of its catalytic subunit (PP2Ac), led to a significant inactivation of Raf-MEK-ERK signaling and reduced glutaminolysis in endothelial cells. Taken together, these results indicated that PP2A-dependent Raf-MEK-ERK activation was involved in glutaminolysis and inhibition of PP2A signals was sufficient to block Raf-MEK-ERK pathway and reduced glutamine metabolism in endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2519177776,"In insects, pheromones function as triggers to elicit complex behavior programs, such as courtship and mating behavior. In most species, the neurons tuned to pheromones are localized in a specific subset of olfactory sensilla located on the antenna called trichoid sensilla. In Drosophila there are two classes of trichoid sensilla, at1 sensilla that contain the dendrites of a single neuron that is specifically tuned to the male-specific pheromone 11-cis vaccenyl acetate (cVA), and at4 sensilla that contain three neurons with relatively poorly defined chemical specificity and function. Using a combination of odorant receptor mutant analysis, single sensillum electrophysiology and optogenetics, we have examined the chemical tuning and behavioral consequences of the three at4 olfactory neuron classes. Our results indicate that one class, Or65abc neurons, are unresponsive to cVA pheromone, and function to inhibit courtship behaviors in response to an unknown ligand, while the other two neuron classes, Or88a and Or47b neurons, are sensitive to a diverse array of fly and non-fly odors, and activation of these neurons has little direct impact on courtship behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2519435175,"The decomposition of plant material in arid ecosystems is considered to be substantially controlled by water and N availability. The responses of litter decomposition to external N and water, however, remain controversial, and the interactive effects of supplementary N and water also have been largely unexamined.A 3.5-year field experiment with supplementary nitrogen and water was conducted to assess the effects of N and water addition on mass loss and nitrogen release in leaves and fine roots of three dominant plant species (i.e., Artemisia halondendron, Setaria viridis, and Phragmites australis) with contrasting substrate chemistry (e.g. N concentration, lignin content in this study) in a desertified dune grassland of Inner Mongolia, China. The treatments included N addition, water addition, combination of N and water, and an untreated control. The decomposition rate in both leaves and roots was related to the initial litter N and lignin concentrations of the three species. However, litter quality did not explain the slower mass loss in roots than in leaves in the present study, and thus warrant further research. Nitrogen addition, either alone or in combination with water, significantly inhibited dry mass loss and N release in the leaves and roots of the three species, whereas water input had little effect on the decomposition of leaf litter and fine roots, suggesting that there was no interactive effect of supplementary N and water on litter decomposition in this system. Furthermore, our results clearly indicate that the inhibitory effects of external N on dry mass loss and nitrogen release are relatively strong in high-lignin litter compared with low-lignin litter.These findings suggest that increasing precipitation hardly facilitates ecosystem carbon turnover but atmospheric N deposition can enhance carbon sequestration and nitrogen retention in desertified dune grasslands of northern China. Additionally, litter quality of plant species should be considered when modelling the carbon cycle and nutrient dynamics of this system."

BMI1-nullmice showseveredefects ingrowth, development, and survival. Although BMI1 is known to exert its effect in the nucleus via repression of 2 potent cellcycle regulators that are encoded by the Ink4a/Arf locus, deletion of this locus only partially rescues BMI1-null phenotypes, which is indicative of alternatemechanisms of action of BMI1. Here, we showthat an extranuclearpool of BMI1 localizes to inner mitochondrial membrane and directly regulates mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) homeostasis andbioenergetics. Thesemitochondrial functions of BMI1 are independent of itspreviouslydescribednuclear functions because a nuclear localization-defective mutant BMI1 rescued several bioenergetic defects that we observed in BMI1-depleted cells, for example, mitochondrial respiration, cytochrome c oxidase activity, and ATP production. Mechanistically, BMI1 coprecipitated with polynucleotide phosphorylase, a ribonuclease that is responsible for decay of mtRNA transcripts. Loss of BMI1 enhanced ribonuclease activity of polynucleotide phosphorylase and reduced mtRNA stability. These findings not only establish a novel extranuclear role of BMI1 in the regulation of mitochondrial bioenergetics, but also provide new mechanistic insights into the role of this protooncogene instemcell differentiation, neuronal aging, and cancer.—Banerjee Mustafi, S., Aznar, N., Dwivedi, S.

https://openalex.org/W2519582051,"Members of the Inhibitor of APoptosis (IAP) protein family suppress apoptosis within tumor cells, particularly in the context of immune cell-mediated killing by the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily cytokines. Most IAPs are opposed endogenously by the second mitochondrial activator of caspases (SMAC), which binds to selected baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domains of IAPs to displace interacting proteins. The development of SMAC mimetics as novel anticancer drugs has gained impetus, with several agents now in human clinical trials. To further understand the cellular mechanisms of SMAC mimetics, we focused on IAP family members cIAP1 and cIAP2, which are recruited to TNF receptor complexes where they support cell survival through NF-κB activation while suppressing apoptosis by preventing caspase activation. We established fluorescence polarization (FP) assays for the BIR2 and BIR3 domains of human cIAP1 and cIAP2 using fluorochrome-conjugated SMAC peptides as ligands. A library of SMAC mimetics was profiled using the FP assays to provide a unique structure activity relationship (SAR) analysis compared to previous assessments of binding to XIAP. Potent compounds displayed mean inhibitory binding constants (Ki) of 9 to 27 nM against the BIR3 domains of cIAP1 and cIAP2, respectively. Selected compounds were then characterized using cytotoxicity assays in which a cytokine-resistant human tumor cell line was sensitized to either TNF or lymphotoxin-α (LT-α). Cytotoxicity correlated closely with cIAP1 and cIAP2 BIR3 binding activity with the most potent compounds able to reduce cell viability by 50%. Further testing demonstrated that active compounds also inhibit RIP1 binding to BIR3 of cIAP1 and cIAP2 in vitro and reduce steady-state cIAP1 protein levels in cells. Altogether, these data inform the SAR for our SMAC mimetics with respect to cIAP1 and cIAP2, suggesting that these IAP family members play an important role in tumor cell resistance to cytotoxicity mediated by TNF and LT-α."
https://openalex.org/W2521031600,"In diabetic individuals, macular edema is a major cause of vision loss. This condition is refractory to insulin therapy and has been attributed to metabolic memory. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is central to maintaining fluid balance in the retina, and this function is compromised by the activation of advanced glycation end-product receptors (RAGE). Here we provide evidence that acute administration of the RAGE agonist, glycated-albumin (gAlb) or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), increased histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity in RPE cells. The administration of the class I/II HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin-A (TSA), suppressed gAlb-induced reductions in RPE transepithelial resistance (in vitro) and fluid transport (in vivo). Systemic TSA also restored normal RPE fluid transport in rats with subchronic hyperglycemia. Both gAlb and VEGF increased HDAC activity and reduced acetyl-α-tubulin levels. Tubastatin-A, a relatively specific antagonist of HDAC6, inhibited gAlb-induced changes in RPE cell resistance. These data are consistent with the idea that RPE dysfunction following exposure to gAlb, VEGF, or hyperglycemia is associated with increased HDAC6 activity and decreased acetyl-α-tubulin. Therefore, we propose inhibiting HDAC6 in the RPE as a potential therapy for preserving normal fluid homeostasis in the hyperglycemic retina."
https://openalex.org/W2512894040,"Disease progression in retinal neurodegeneration is strongly correlated to immune cell activation, which may have either a neuroprotective or neurotoxic effect. Increased knowledge about the immune response profile and retinal neurodegeneration may lead to candidate targets for treatments. Therefore, we have used the explanted retina as a model to explore the immune response and expression of the immune modulator galectin-3 (Gal-3), induced by the cultivation per se and after additional immune stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and how this correlates with retinal neurotoxicity.Post-natal mouse retinas were cultured in a defined medium. One group was stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml, 24 h). Retinal architecture, apoptotic cell death, and micro- and macroglial activity were studied at the time of cultivation (0 days in vitro (DIV)) and at 3, 4 and 7 DIV using morphological staining, biochemical- and immunohistochemical techniques.Our results show that sustained activation of macro- and microglia, characterized by no detectable cytokine release and limited expression of Gal-3, is not further inducing apoptosis additional to the axotomy-induced apoptosis in innermost nuclear layer. An elevated immune response was detected after LPS stimulation, as demonstrated primarily by release of immune mediators (i.e. interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-6, KC/GRO (also known as CLCX1) and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)), increased numbers of microglia displaying morphologies of late activation stages as well as Gal-3 expression. This was accompanied with increased apoptosis in the two additional nuclear layers, and damage to retinal gross architecture.We demonstrate that an immune response characterized by sustained and increased release of cytokines, along with an increase in Gal-3 expression, is accompanied by significant increased neurotoxicity in the explanted retina. Further investigations using the current setting may lead to increased understanding on the mechanisms involved in neuronal loss in retinal neurodegenerations."

Appendicular muscle mass was measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Appendicular muscle mass index was calculated as appendicular muscle mass divided by height squared (kg/m2). The homeostatic model assessment of β-cell function was used to assess β-cell function. The homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance was used as a measure of insulin resistance. The association between appendicular muscle mass index and clinical parameters of β-cell function and insulin resistance was examined.Log-transformed homeostatic model assessment of β-cell function and Log-transformed homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance showed a normal distribution. In both men and women, there was a significant positive correlation between appendicular muscle mass index and clinical parameters of β-cell function and insulin resistance. Tertile analysis, following stratification according to appendicular muscle mass index, found that low appendicular muscle mass index was significantly associated with the Log homeostatic model assessment of β-cell function and Log-transformed homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance.This study shows that decreased β cell function is associated with reduced skeletal muscle mass in Japanese subjects without diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2512723692,"The current reference test for the detection of respiratory abnormalities in asbestos-exposed workers is spirometry. However, spirometry has several shortcomings that greatly affect the efficacy of current asbestos control programs. The forced oscillation technique (FOT) represents the current state-of-the-art technique in the assessment of lung function. This method provides a detailed analysis of respiratory resistance and reactance at different oscillatory frequencies during tidal breathing. Here, we evaluate the FOT as an alternative method to standard spirometry for the early detection and quantification of respiratory abnormalities in asbestos-exposed workers.Seventy-two subjects were analyzed. The control group was composed of 33 subjects with a normal spirometric exam who had no history of smoking or pulmonary disease. Thirty-nine subjects exposed to asbestos were also studied, including 32 volunteers in radiological category 0/0 and 7 volunteers with radiological categories of 0/1 or 1/1. FOT data were interpreted using classical parameters as well as integer (InOr) and fractional-order (FrOr) modeling. The diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by investigating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Exposed workers presented increased obstruction (resistance p<0.001) and a reduced compliance (p<0.001), with a predominance of obstructive changes. The FOT parameter changes were correlated with the standard pulmonary function analysis methods (R = -0.52, p<0.001). Early respiratory abnormalities were identified with a high diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.987) using parameters obtained from the FrOr modeling. This accuracy was significantly better than those obtained with classical (p<0.001) and InOr (p<0.001) model parameters.The FOT improved our knowledge about the biomechanical abnormalities in workers exposed to asbestos. Additionally, a high diagnostic accuracy in the diagnosis of early respiratory abnormalities in asbestos-exposed workers was obtained.

https://openalex.org/W2513555323,"The activity of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) is triggered by calmodulin (CaM) binding and is often further regulated by phosphorylation at several positions in the enzyme. Phosphorylation at Ser1179 occurs in response to diverse physiologic stimuli and increases the NO synthesis and cytochrome c reductase activities of eNOS, thereby enhancing its participation in biological signal cascades. Despite its importance, the mechanism by which Ser1179 phosphorylation increases eNOS activity is not understood. To address this, we used stopped-flow spectroscopy and computer modeling approaches to determine how the phosphomimetic mutation (S1179D) may impact electron flux through eNOS and the conformational behaviors of its reductase domain, both in the absence and presence of bound CaM. We found that S1179D substitution in CaM-free eNOS had multiple effects; it increased the rate of flavin reduction, altered the conformational equilibrium of the reductase domain, and increased the rate of its conformational transitions. We found these changes were equivalent in degree to those caused by CaM binding to wild-type eNOS, and the S1179D substitution together with CaM binding caused even greater changes in these parameters. The modeling indicated that the changes caused by the S1179D substitution, despite being restricted to the reductase domain, are sufficient to explain the stimulation of both the cytochrome c reductase and NO synthase activities of eNOS. This helps clarify how Ser1179 phosphorylation regulates eNOS and provides a foundation to compare its regulation by other phosphorylation events."
https://openalex.org/W2519751749,"Interleukin-25 (IL-25) is a potent activator of type-2 immune responses, and is responsible for airway inflammation in asthma. Previous reports have shown that IL-25 expressed hyper-reactivity in an experimental mouse-model of asthma. In addition, the production of IL-13/IL-5 promoted by nuocytes induced airway inflammation. Thus, it has been questioned whether blocking IL-25 against its receptor IL-17BR could inhibit the expression of IL-13 and IL-5 via nuocytes, and further protect against inflammation in ovalbumin (OVA) induced mouse-model of asthma.In this study, in order to investigate the correlation among IL-25, IL-5, IL-13 and nuocyte activities, we used OVA-sensitization and -challenging to induce the mouse model of asthma. The murine asthmatic model was validated by histology. The expressions of IL-5, IL-13 and IL-25 were detected by ELISA, quantitative real-time PCR, and western blotting of the lung tissue. Nuocyte activation was identified by the levels of ICOS (clone C398.4A) and T1/ST2 (cloneDJ8) (acting as nuocytes surface markers) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). This, in turn, was done by means of flow cytometry. The expressions of IL-25, IL-5 and IL-13 in our murine model were detected in the BALF.The mice sensitized and challenged with OVA showed a high expression of IL-25 in both the mRNA and protein levels in lungs. The expressions of ICOS and T1/ST2 in BALF were increased. A significant correlation between IL-25 mRNA, protein, and other Th2-cell producing cytokines (such as IL-5 and IL-13) moreover were identified. Furthermore, when the asthmatic mice were treated with anti-IL-25, both the inflammatory cells' infiltration and the inflammatory cytokines' secretion were significantly decreased. The present findings indicate that IL-25 might be involved in a series of asthmatic immune responses, playing an important role in the increase of nuocytes, and that its activation is necessary in maintaining Th2 central memory and sustaining asthmatic inflammation.This study showed that IL-25 promoted the accumulation of ICOS and T1/ST2 on nuocytes, further induced the pro-inflammatory Th2 cells, and promoted Th2 cytokine responses in OVA-induced airway inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2520871879,"HOXA9, MEIS1 and FLT3 are genes frequently upregulated in human acute myeloid leukemia. Hoxa9 and Meis1 also cooperate to induce aggressive AML with high Flt3 expression in mice, suggesting an important role for Flt3 in Hoxa9/Meis1-induced leukemogenesis. To define the role of Flt3 in AML with high Hoxa9/Meis1, we treated mice with Hoxa9/Meis1-induced AML with the Flt3 inhibitor AC220, used an Flt3-ligand (FL-/-) knockout model, and investigated whether overexpression of Flt3 could induce leukemia together with overexpression of Hoxa9. Flt3 inhibition by AC220 did not delay AML development in mice transplanted with bone marrow cells overexpressing Hoxa9 and Meis1. In addition, Hoxa9/Meis1 cells induced AML in FL-/- mice as rapid as in wild-type mice. However, FL-/- mice had reduced organ infiltration compared with wild-type mice, suggesting some Flt3-dependent effect on leukemic invasiveness. Interestingly, leukemic Hoxa9/Meis1 cells from sick mice expressed high levels of Flt3 regardless of presence of its ligand, showing that Flt3 is a passive marker on these cells. In line with this, combined engineered overexpression of Flt3 and Hoxa9 did not accelerate the progression to AML. We conclude that the Hoxa9- and Meis1-associated upregulation of Flt3 is not a requirement for leukemic progression induced by Hoxa9 and Meis1."
https://openalex.org/W2516178404,"T follicular helper cells (Tfh) provide help to B cells to support their activation, expansion and differentiation. However, the role of Tfh cells in chronic HBV infection is poorly defined. The aim of this research was to examine the function of Tfh cells and whether they are involved in HBV related disease. Blood CXCR5+CD4+T cells and B cells in 85 patients with chronic HBV infection (HBV patients) and health controls (HC) were examined by flow cytometry. The molecule expression in blood CXCR5+CD4+ T cells was detected by real-time PCR. Blood CXCR5+CD4+ T cells and B cells were co-cultured and the production of Ig and cytokines was detected by ELISA. Autoantibodies were detected by indirect immunofluorescence and immunospot assay. We found that blood CXCR5+CD4+ T cells in patients with chronic HBV infection (HBV patients) expressed higher level of activation related molecules and cytokines than that from health controls (HC).In HBV patients, the frequency of blood CXCR5+CD4+ T cells was significantly correlated with serum ALT and AST. We also found that blood CXCR5+CD4+ T cells from HBV patients could induce B cells to secret higher level of immunoglobulin than that from HC. Several autoantibodies, including ANA, ss-A, ss-B, Scl-70, Jo-1, ect, were indeed positive in 65% HBV patients. Among HBV patients, expression of function related molecules was significantly higher in blood CXCR5+CD4+ T cells from patients with autoantibodies than that without autoantibodies. Our research indicated that blood CXCR5+CD4+ T cells from HBV patients were over activated and show augmented capacity to help B cells for antibody secreting, which might correlated with liver inflammation and the production of autoantibodies in extrahepatic manifestations."
https://openalex.org/W2519759550,"Study Objective To investigate potential quantitative and qualitative differences in brain serotonergic activity between women with Premenstrual Dysphoria (PMD) and asymptomatic controls. Background Serotonin-augmenting drugs alleviate premenstrual mood symptoms in the majority of women with PMD while serotonin-depleting diets worsen PMD symptoms, both indicating intrinsic differences in brain serotonergic activity in women with PMD compared to asymptomatic women. Methods Positron-emission tomography with the immediate precursor of serotonin, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), radiolabelled by 11C in the beta-3 position, was performed in the follicular and luteal phases for 12 women with PMD and 8 control women. Brain radioactivity–a proxy for serotonin precursor uptake and synthesis–was measured in 9 regions of interest (ROIs): the right and left sides of the medial prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, putamen and caudate nucleus, and the single “whole brain”. Results There were no significant quantitative differences in brain 5-HTP-derived activity between the groups in either of the menstrual phases for any of the 9 ROIs. However, multivariate analysis revealed a significant quantitative and qualitative difference between the groups. Asymptomatic control women showed a premenstrual right sided relative increase in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 5-HTP derived activity, whereas PMD women displayed the opposite (p = 0.0001). Menstrual phase changes in this asymmetry (premenstrual—follicular) correlated with changes in self ratings of ‘irritability’ for the entire group (rs = -0.595, p = 0.006). The PMD group showed a strong inverse correlation between phase changes (premenstrual—follicular) in plasma levels of estradiol and phase changes in the laterality (dx/sin) of radiotracer activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal ROI (rs = -0.635; 0.027). The control group showed no such correlation. Conclusion Absence of increased premenstrual right-sided relative 5-HTP-derived activity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortices was found to strongly correlate to premenstrual irritability. A causal relationship here seems plausible, and the findings give further support to an underlying frontal brain disturbance in hormonally influenced serotonergic activity in women with PMD. Because of the small number of subjects in the study, these results should be considered preliminary, requiring verification in larger studies."
https://openalex.org/W2520532873,"Aims Changes in the islet vasculature have been implicated in the regulation of β-cell survival and function during the progression to type 2 diabetes (T2D). Failure of the β-cell to compensate for the increased insulin demand in obesity eventually leads to diabetes; as a result of the complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors (e.g. ongoing inflammation within the islets) and impaired vascular function. The Angiopoietin/Tie (Ang/Tie) angiogenic system maintains vasculature and is closely related to organ inflammation and angiogenesis. In this study we aimed to identify whether the vessel area within the islets changes in diabetes and whether such changes would be triggered by the Tie-antagonist Ang-2. Methods Immunohistochemical and qPCR analyses to follow islet vascularization and Ang/Tie levels were performed in human pancreatic autopsies and isolated human and mouse islets. The effect of Ang-2 was assessed in β-cell-specific Ang-2 overexpressing mice during high fat diet (HFD) feeding. Results Islet vessel area was increased in autopsy pancreases from patients with T2D. The vessel markers Tie-1, Tie-2 and CD31 were upregulated in mouse islets upon HFD feeding from 8 to 24 weeks. Ang-2 was transiently upregulated in mouse islets at 8 weeks of HFD and under glucolipotoxic conditions (22.2 mM glucose/ 0.5 mM palmitate) in vitro in human and mouse islets, in contrast to its downregulation by cytokines (IL-1β, IFN-ɣ and TNF-α). Ang-1 on the other hand was oppositely regulated, with a significant loss under glucolipotoxic condition, a trend to reduce in islets from patients with T2D and an upregulation by cytokines. Modulation of such changes in Ang-2 by its overexpression or the inhibition of its receptor Tie-2 impaired β-cell function at basal conditions but protected islets from cytokine induced apoptosis. In vivo, β-cell-specific Ang-2 overexpression in mice induced hypervascularization under normal diet but contrastingly led to hypovascularized islets in response to HFD together with increased apoptosis and reduced β-cell mass. Conclusions Islet hypervascularization occurs in T2D. A balanced expression of the Ang1/Ang2 system is important for islet physiology. Ang-2 prevents β-cell mass and islet vascular adaptation in response to HFD feeding with no major influence on glucose homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2514907620,"Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a persistent, progressive, and fatal degenerative disease resulting from persistent measles virus (MV) infection of the central nervous system. Most drugs used to treat SSPE have been reported to have limited effects. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies are urgently required. The SSPE virus, a variant MV strain, differs virologically from wild-type MV strain. One characteristic of the SSPE virus is its defective production of cell-free virus, which leaves cell-to-cell infection as the major mechanism of viral dissemination. The fusion protein plays an essential role in this cell-to-cell spread. It contains two critical heptad repeat regions that form a six-helix bundle in the trimer similar to most viral fusion proteins. In the case of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), a synthetic peptide derived from the heptad repeat region of the fusion protein enfuvirtide inhibits viral replication and is clinically approved as an anti-HIV-1 agent. The heptad repeat regions of HIV-1 are structurally and functionally similar to those of the MV fusion protein. We therefore designed novel peptides derived from the fusion protein heptad repeat region of the MV and examined their effects on the measles and SSPE virus replication in vitro and in vivo. Some of these synthetic novel peptides demonstrated high antiviral activity against both the measles (Edmonston strain) and SSPE (Yamagata-1 strain) viruses at nanomolar concentrations with no cytotoxicity in vitro. In particular, intracranial administration of one of the synthetic peptides increased the survival rate from 0% to 67% in an SSPE virus-infected nude mouse model."
https://openalex.org/W2517274198,"The cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is an intracellular ion channel that regulates Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) during excitation–contraction coupling in the heart. The glutathione transferases (GSTs) are a family of phase II detoxification enzymes with additional functions including the selective inhibition of RyR2, with therapeutic implications. The C-terminal half of GSTM2 (GSTM2C) is essential for RyR2 inhibition, and mutations F157A and Y160A within GSTM2C prevent the inhibitory action. Our objective in this investigation was to determine whether GSTM2C can enter cultured rat neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes and influence contractility. We show that oregon green-tagged GSTM2C (at 1 μM) is internalized into the myocytes and it reduces spontaneous contraction frequency and myocyte shortening. Field stimulation of myocytes evoked contraction in the same percentage of myocytes treated either with media alone or media plus 15 μM GSTM2C. Myocyte shortening during contraction was significantly reduced by exposure to 15 μM GSTM2C, but not 5 and 10 μM GSTM2C and was unaffected by exposure to 15 μM of the mutants Y160A or F157A. The amplitude of the Ca2+ transient in the 15 μM GSTM2C - treated myocytes was significantly decreased, the rise time was significantly longer and the decay time was significantly shorter than in control myocytes. The Ca2+ transient was not altered by exposure to Y160A or F157A. The results are consistent with GSTM2C entering the myocytes and inhibiting RyR2, in a manner that indicates a possible therapeutic potential for treatment of arrhythmia in the neonatal heart."

Exocytosis is a fundamental process used by eukaryotic cells to release biological compounds and to insert lipids and proteins in the plasma membrane. To release all or part of their contents to the extracellular space, secretory vesicles must be transported to the cell periphery, dock to the plasma membrane, and undergo a priming reaction that enables them to fuse upon calcium elevation (1.Wu L.G.

Later on, Rab3 must be inactivated (hydrolyze GTP) to accomplish vesiculation of the acrosomal and plasma membranes (26.Bustos M.A. Roggero C.M. De la Iglesia P.X. Mayorga L.S. Tomes C.N.

Recombinant, persistently active Rab3A is a molecule with dual properties evidenced at different times and within different molecular contexts during the secretory cascade. Rab3A's positive function is evidenced when introduced into SLO-permeabilized cells at the beginning of the incubation: the protein triggers exocytosis. Its negative role is manifested when added after docking of the acrosome to the plasma membrane: Rab3A blocks the AR (26.Bustos M.A. Roggero C.M. De la Iglesia P.X. Mayorga L.S. Tomes C.N.

The different effects of recombinant Rab3A in the AR correlate with the activation and inactivation of endogenous Rab3. The positive and negative attributes of recombinant Rab3A are segregated to different domains of the protein. A chimeric protein consisting of the amino-terminal portion of Rab3A fused to the carboxyl-terminal portion of Rab22A bears the repressing capacity of Rab3A. Recombinant, full-length Rab22A has no measurable influence on the calcium-triggered AR, which suggests that the effects elicited by the chimera are attributable to the Rab3A portion of the molecule (26.Bustos M.A. Roggero C.M.

Rab3A-22A halts exocytosis after swelling, intra-acrosomal calcium mobilization and the opening of fusion pores but prior to the vesiculation of membranes and release of acrosomal contents. In other words, Rab3A-22A stabilizes fusion pores and prevents their expansion. The acrosomal region of the sperm head contains the acrosomal granule plus the portions of cytosol and plasma membrane that overlie it. Endogenous Rab3 is detected in the acrosomal region in human sperm by indirect immunofluorescence (26.Bustos M.A. Roggero C.M. De la Iglesia P.X. Mayorga L.S. Tomes C.N.

Because the head is so small, more refined localization analyses within this region, such as whether the protein is soluble or bound to membranes, and if so, to which membranes, are not appreciated by conventional fluorescence microscopy. We investigated whether delivery of the chimera into sperm affected the compartment that contains endogenous Rab3. Sperm untreated (control), incubated with calcium alone (calcium), or incubated with the chimera followed by calcium (Rab3A-22A→calcium) were tripled stained for Rab3 (indirect immunofluorescence with anti-Rab3 antibodies, red), presence of the acrosome (FITC-PSA, green), and nucleus (Hoechst 33342, blue). In unreacted cells, the acrosomes were stained green by FITC-PSA (Fig. 1, cells a′, b′, d′, e′, f′) whereas cells that lost their acrosomes did not display bright acrosomal fluorescence (see for instance cell c′). In these series of experiments, basal AR was 10%. Twenty-four percent of the cells underwent exocytosis when stimulated with calcium. This percentage decreased to 12% in cells pretreated with Rab3A-22A before calcium (Fig. 1, table), confirming previous observations that the chimera inhibits the AR. Endogenous Rab3 localized to the acrosomal region in ≈50% of human sperm in the control and Rab3A-22A → calcium conditions (Fig. 1, see acrosomal staining in cells a, b, and f and quantifications in the table); the remaining cells did not exhibit specific immunofluorescence. The neck that connects the head to the tail of the sperm is a highly reactive region decorated by many antibodies and even non-immune serum (see Fig. 1A in Ref. 28.Michaut M. De Blas G. Tomes C.N. Yunes R. Fukuda M. Mayorga L.S. Synaptotagmin VI participates in the acrosome reaction of human spermatozoa.Dev.

Mayorga L.S. α-SNAP and NSF are required in a priming step during the human sperm acrosome reaction.Mol Hum. Reprod. 2005; 11: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) for examples); thus, staining in this domain was considered unspecific and excluded from the quantifications. The percentage of Rab3-positive cells decreased to 38% upon treatment with calcium (Fig. 1, table). Only cells that did not undergo the AR showed Rab3 immunofluorescence in the acrosomal region (cells a, b, d, and f). Cells that underwent exocytosis upon challenging with calcium (exemplified by cell c′; arrowhead points to the tip of its head, where the acrosome would have been), were not decorated by the anti-Rab3A antibodies in the acrosomal domain (cell c). These results indicate that Rab3 localizes to a compartment shed during the AR and that introduction of Rab3A-22A does not alter the acrosomal localization of sperm Rab3 assessed by fluorescence microscopy. To gain insights on the mechanism that drives the inhibition caused by Rab3A-22A, we first determined its effect on acrosomal swelling. Fig. 2A, panel A′ shows the typical aspect of the head of a resting cell, where the acrosome is flat and even. Panel B′ illustrates a cell that underwent acrosomal swelling/deformation in response to the exocytotic stimulus (external calcium), but stopped at the docking stage because BAPTA-AM prevented intra-acrosomal calcium release (see below). The cell photographed in panel C′ was treated with Rab3A-22A before initiating the AR with calcium. Its acrosome looks like that of the cell in panel B′. Quantification of the three visually distinguishable states, intact (A′), swollen/deformed (B′, C′) and reacted (not shown but see examples in Refs. 26.Bustos M.A. Roggero C.M. De la Iglesia P.X.

Very few acrosomes were swollen or lost in the control condition. In contrast, external calcium elicited swelling in 30–40% of the cells preincubated with either BAPTA-AM or Rab3A-22A. There were few reacted sperm because both reagents prevent the AR. These data show that the chimeric protein does not interfere with swelling, an early stage of the exocytotic cascade. Endogenous Rab3A exchanges GDP for GTP concomitantly with swelling. In other words, Rab3A plays a positive role and the chimaera does not express its negative function during this window of time (26.Bustos M.A. Roggero C.M. De la Iglesia P.X. Mayorga L.S. Tomes C.N. GTP-bound Rab3A exhibits consecutive positive and negative roles during human sperm dense-core granule exocytosis.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 6: 286-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The acrosome is an internal store of releasable calcium; efflux from this reservoir through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-sensitive channels is required for the AR triggered by all inducers (reviewed in Ref. 13.Tomes C.N. The proteins of exocytosis: lessons from the sperm model.Biochem. J. 2015; 465: 359-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Can the blocking effect of Rab3A-22A be attributed to interference with the mobilization of intracellular calcium? We used single-cell confocal microscopy in real time to answer this question. In the control condition (without any treatment), acrosomal calcium remained invariant for the length of the recording (data not shown, but see Refs. 23.Ruete M.C. Lucchesi O. Bustos M.A. Tomes C.N. Epac, Rap and Rab3 act in concert to mobilize calcium from sperm inverted question marks acrosome during exocytosis.Cell Commun. Signal. 2014; 12: 43PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Lucchesi O. Ruete M.C. Bustos M.A. Quevedo M.F. Tomes C.N. The signaling module cAMP/Epac/Rap1/PLCϵ/IP3 mobilizes acrosomal calcium during sperm exocytosis.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1863: 544-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The AR inducer CaCl2 depleted the acrosomal store, visualized with the calcium indicator Fluo3, whether or not sperm had been preincubated with Rab3A-22A (Fig. 2, C–D, ac, red lines/bars). Accordingly, adenophostin A, an IP3 receptor agonist that promotes intravesicular calcium release (23.Ruete M.C. Lucchesi O. Bustos M.A. Tomes C.N. Epac, Rap and Rab3 act in concert to mobilize calcium from sperm inverted question marks acrosome during exocytosis.Cell Commun. Signal. 2014; 12: 43PubMed Google Scholar) failed to rescue exocytosis halted by the chimera (Fig. 3A). Taken together, these results indicate that Rab3A-22A does not interfere with intra-acrosomal calcium mobilization, a relatively late stage of the exocytotic cascade. Rab3A-22A halted the AR at a stage downstream swelling and intra-acrosomal calcium mobilization. Membrane fusion happens shortly after these events. We serendipitously found that recombinant α-SNAP reversed the exocytotic block imposed by Rab3A-22A regardless of whether it was added before or after initiating the AR with calcium (Figs. 3B and 4A). When added after docking in sperm loaded with the photosensitive intra-acrosomal calcium chelator NP-EGTA-AM (see Ref. 26.Bustos M.A. Roggero C.M. De la Iglesia P.X. Mayorga L.S. Tomes C.N. GTP-bound Rab3A exhibits consecutive positive and negative roles during human sperm dense-core granule exocytosis.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 6: 286-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar for a description of the experimental strategy), full-length, persistently active Rab3A behaves as the chimaera, presumably affecting exocytosis through the same mechanism. Hence, α-SNAP also reversed the exocytotic block imposed by Rab3A; and so did NSF (Fig. 3C). The best established role for α-SNAP in membrane fusion is to bridge NSF to cis SNARE complexes to disentangle them (Refs. 4.Sorensen J.B. Conflicting views on the membrane fusion machinery and the fusion pore.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2009; 25: 513-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 5.Vardjan N. Jorgacevski J. Zorec R.

Biophys. 2015; 44: 339-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar and references therein). In several exocytotic models, these complexes are viewed as by-products of the membrane fusion reaction. Thus, we formulated the hypothesis that the inhibition caused by Rab3A and Rab3A-22A was somehow related to cis SNARE complexes formed after fusion pore opening. Their disassembly by α-SNAP/NSF would be required for pore dilation. As shown above, α-SNAP/NSF rescued the exocytosis block imposed by Rab3A-22A and our hypothesis was that they did so by disassembling cis SNARE complexes. But the existence of post-fusion cis SNARE complexes has never been suspected in sperm: do they form after fusion pore opening during the AR? Neurotoxins (botulinum, BoNTs, and tetanus) are potent inhibitors of secretory vesicle release due to their highly specific, zinc-dependent, proteolytic cleavage of the synaptic isoforms of all SNARE proteins. SNAREs are sensitive to cleavage by neurotoxins only when not packed in tight heterotrimeric complexes (33.Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. Synaptic vesicle membrane fusion complex: action of clostridial neurotoxins on assembly.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Whatever the steady state configuration of SNAREs might be, exocytosis in neuroendocrine cells is blocked by neurotoxins, suggesting that SNAREs go through toxin-sensitive stages (34.Xu T. Binz T. Niemann H. Neher E. Multiple kinetic components of exocytosis distinguished by neurotoxin sensitivity.Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 35.Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H. SNARE complex formation is triggered by Ca2+ and drives membrane fusion.Cell. 1999; 97: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In unstimulated sperm, on the contrary, SNAREs are stably protected from toxin cleavage; acquisition of toxin-sensitivity is coupled to the initiation of exocytosis. When the AR begins, cis, toxin-resistant, SNARE complexes on the plasma and acrosomal membranes disassemble and become toxin-sensitive. SNAREs subsequently reassemble in fusion-competent trans complexes (13.Tomes C.N. The proteins of exocytosis: lessons from the sperm model.Biochem. J. 2015; 465: 359-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 36.De Blas G.A. Roggero C.M. Tomes C.N. Mayorga L.S. Dynamics of SNARE assembly and disassembly during sperm acrosomal exocytosis.PLoS. Biol. 2005; 3: e323Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We used BoNT/B to test the hypothesis that α-SNAP/NSF rescued the Rab3A-22A block on the AR because they disassembled post-fusion cis SNARE complexes. This toxin is specific for synaptobrevin (37.Pellizzari R. Rossetto O. Schiavo G. Montecucco C. Tetanus and botulinum neurotoxins: mechanism of action and therapeutic uses.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) both monomeric and engaged in partially assembled trans complexes (36.De Blas G.A. Roggero C.M. Tomes C.N.

Rothman J.E. A clamping mechanism involved in SNARE-dependent exocytosis.Science. 2006; 313: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar); its catalytic activity is abolished by the zinc chelator TPEN. We loaded SLO-permeabilized sperm sequentially with Rab3A-22A, calcium to initiate the AR, and BoNT/B, and incubated the mixture for enough time to allow the toxin to cleave synaptobrevin; subsequently, we added TPEN to inactivate BoNT/B and α-SNAP to relieve the chimera's exocytotic block. The AR proceeded normally despite the presence of BoNT/B (Fig. 4A, black bar). Insensitivity was a consequence of introducing Rab3A-22A into sperm; otherwise, synaptobrevin was cleaved by BoNT/B and the AR, inhibited (Fig. 4A). In other words, when calcium stimulates the AR in the presence of Rab3A-22A, the exocytotic cascade advances up to a stage in which synaptobrevin is protected from BoNT/B. We conducted the next series of experiments to test directly the configuration of synaptobrevin in sperm treated with Rab3A-22A. Monitoring SNARE proteins integrity in the presence of neurotoxins by indirect immunofluorescence is a suitable assay to determine the configuration of SNAREs in human sperm: while intact SNAREs are detected with specific antibodies, those cleaved by neurotoxins are no longer recognized (36.De Blas G.A.

An anti-synaptobrevin-2 antibody decorated the acrosomal region in ∼70% permeabilized human sperm despite pretreatment with the light chain of BoNT/B, in agreement with the notion that synaptobrevin is protected from toxin cleavage in unstimulated sperm. When the toxin was added in combination with calcium, the number of cells exhibiting synaptobrevin-2 labeling dropped significantly, indicating that the initiation of the AR had promoted the disassembly of SNARE complexes and sensitized synaptobrevin to BoNT/B (Fig. 4B, top, gray bars). In contrast, this SNARE remained toxin-insensitive when Rab3A-22A was also included in the assay. The only synaptobrevin-2 configuration known to be refractory to BoNT/B cleavage is the cis SNARE complex. If this were the case, recombinant α-SNAP (in combination with endogenous NSF) should sensitize synaptobrevin-2 to BoNT/B. This was exactly what we found (Fig. 4B, black bars). It is important to mention that SNAREs are not trapped by Rab3A-22A in the cis configuration typical of unstimulated sperm because the chimera inhibits the AR at a late, post-docking (26.Bustos M.A. Roggero C.M. De la Iglesia P.X. Mayorga L.S. Tomes C.N. GTP-bound Rab3A exhibits consecutive positive and negative roles during human sperm dense-core granule exocytosis.J. Mol.

Thus, there is a second, later point during the exocytotic cascade, when SNAREs go through a BoNT/B-resistant c"

It had a slightly better average radiochemical yield of 35.3 ± 3.6% (decay-corrected to end of synthesis (EOS)) than did 9-(+)-11C-DTBZ (30.5 ± 2.3%). MicroPET studies showed that 10-(+)-11C-DTBZ had a striatum-to-cerebellum ratio of 3.74 ± 0.21 at 40 min post-injection, while the ratio of 9-(+)-11C-DTBZ was 2.50 ± 0.33. This indicated that 10-(+)-11C-DTBZ has a higher specific uptake in VMAT2-rich brain regions, and 10-(+)-11C-DTBZ may be a potential VMAT2 radioligand.

Here we present a targeted photocatalytic system based on the fusion protein StrepMiniSOG that uses light within the visible spectrum to produce reactive oxygen species at a greater efficiency than current photosensitizers, allowing for shorter irradiation times from a fully biodegradable photocatalyst. The StrepMiniSOG photodisinfection system is unable to cross cell membranes and like other consumed proteins, can be degraded by endogenous digestive enzymes in the human gut, thereby reducing the consumption risks typically associated with other disinfection agents. We demonstrate specific, multi-log removal of Listeria monocytogenes from a mixed population of bacteria, establishing the StrepMiniSOG disinfection system as a valuable tool for targeted pathogen removal, while maintaining existing microbial biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W2520451757,"Frogs of the genus Thoropa comprise six endemic Brazilian species on the Eastern side of the country. Little is known about their natural history, especially about their acoustic communication. Therefore, aiming to provide an overview of their vocalizations, we analyzed and redescribed male advertisement calls of three living and two possibly extinct species. The smaller species, T. petropolitana and T. lutzi, produce simple calls (one single note) with a higher frequency range than the remaining larger ones. On the other hand, the larger species present complex calls, with more than one note: T. megatympanum calls have three notes, T. taophora calls have four notes, and T. miliaris calls varies from three to six notes. Population snout-vent length negatively correlated with peak of dominant frequency as expected. However, highlighted differences between two populations of T. lutzi, which could indicate need of further taxonomic evaluation of those lineages. Peculiar morphology, such as the absence of vocal sacs and slits, may have contributed to their call variation and highly banded frequency structure. If the observed population differences reflect species-level differences, T. lutzi may be classified as a critically endangered species, as T. petropolitana. Furthermore, we provided a suggestion to an unusual behavior in frogs: calling with the mouth open in the smaller species of the genus."
