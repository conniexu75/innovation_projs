https://openalex.org/W4301179097,"Sleep apnea is a common disorder that represents a global public health burden. KCNK3 encodes TASK-1, a K+ channel implicated in the control of breathing, but its link with sleep apnea remains poorly understood. Here we describe a new developmental disorder with associated sleep apnea (developmental delay with sleep apnea, or DDSA) caused by rare de novo gain-of-function mutations in KCNK3. The mutations cluster around the 'X-gate', a gating motif that controls channel opening, and produce overactive channels that no longer respond to inhibition by G-protein-coupled receptor pathways. However, despite their defective X-gating, these mutant channels can still be inhibited by a range of known TASK channel inhibitors. These results not only highlight an important new role for TASK-1 K+ channels and their link with sleep apnea but also identify possible therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4301374150,"While lactate shuttle theory states that glial cells metabolize glucose into lactate to shuttle it to neurons, how glial cells support axonal metabolism and function remains unclear. Lactate production is a common occurrence following anaerobic glycolysis in muscles. However, several other cell types, including some stem cells, activated macrophages and tumor cells, can produce lactate in presence of oxygen and cellular respiration, using Pyruvate Kinase 2 (PKM2) to divert pyruvate to lactate dehydrogenase. We show here that PKM2 is also upregulated in myelinating Schwann cells (mSC) of mature mouse sciatic nerve versus postnatal immature nerve. Deletion of this isoform in PLP-expressing cells in mice leads to a deficit of lactate in mSC and in peripheral nerves. While the structure of myelin sheath was preserved, mutant mice developed a peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral nerve axons of mutant mice failed to maintain lactate homeostasis upon activity, resulting in an impaired production of mitochondrial ATP. Action potential propagation was not altered but axonal mitochondria transport was slowed down, muscle axon terminals retracted and motor neurons displayed cellular stress. Additional reduction of lactate availability through dichloroacetate treatment, which diverts pyruvate to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, further aggravated motor dysfunction in mutant mice. Thus, lactate production through PKM2 enzyme and aerobic glycolysis is essential in mSC for the long-term maintenance of peripheral nerve axon physiology and function."
https://openalex.org/W4301181153,"To study the difference between the fungal community compositional and fragrance components in medium- and high-Temperature Taorong-type Baijiu Daqu. The microbial communities and fragrance components of Taorong-type Baijiu Daqu were analyzed using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and headspace-solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS). With an abundance at the phylum and genus levels ≥0.01% as the threshold, 3 phyla, Mucoromycota, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota, were found in both medium- and high-temperature Daqu, but their abundances differed. At the genus level, 15 and 13 genera were recognized. Rhizopus (72.40%) and Thermomyces (53.32%) accounted for the most significant proportions in medium-temperature and high-temperature Daqu, respectively. Medium-temperature Daqu and high-temperature Daqu were found to have 40 and 29 fragrance components, respectively and contained the highest proportions of pyrazines (53.12%) and acids (32.68%). Correlation analyses between microbes and fragrance components showed that Aspergillus, Hyphopichia, Trichosporon, Alternaria were all highly and positively correlated with pyrazines, but the dominant fungal communities were highly correlated with only a few individual acid compounds but not with acid compounds overall. The unique Daqu -making process and environment lead to these differences."
https://openalex.org/W4301181160,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a multifactorial progressive airflow obstruction in the lungs, accounting for high morbidity and mortality across the world. This study aims to identify potential COPD blood-based biomarkers by analyzing the dysregulated gene expression patterns in blood and lung tissues with the help of robust computational approaches. The microarray gene expression datasets from blood (136 COPD and 6 controls) and lung tissues (16 COPD and 19 controls) were analyzed to detect shared differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Then these DEGs were used to construct COPD protein network-clusters and functionally enrich them against gene ontology annotation terms. The hub genes in the COPD network clusters were then queried in GWAS catalog and in several cancer expression databases to explore their pathogenic roles in lung cancers. The comparison of blood and lung tissue datasets revealed 63 shared DEGs. Of these DEGs, 12 COPD hub gene-network clusters (SREK1, TMEM67, IRAK2, MECOM, ASB4, C1QTNF2, CDC42BPA, DPF3, DET1, CCDC74B, KHK, and DDX3Y) connected to dysregulations of protein degradation, inflammatory cytokine production, airway remodeling, and immune cell activity were prioritized with the help of protein interactome and functional enrichment analysis. Interestingly, IRAK2 and MECOM hub genes from these COPD network clusters are known for their involvement in different pulmonary diseases. Additional COPD hub genes like SREK1, TMEM67, CDC42BPA, DPF3, and ASB4 were identified as prognostic markers in lung cancer, which is reported in 1% of COPD patients. This study identified 12 gene network- clusters as potential blood based genetic biomarkers for COPD diagnosis and prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W4301181163,"Background The increasing number of physicians leaving practice, especially hospitalists, has been well-documented. The most commonly examined factor associated with this exodus has been burnout. The COVID-19 pandemic has put a unique and unprecedented stress on hospitalists who have been at the front lines of patient care. Therefore, the investigation of burnout and its related factors in hospitalists is essential to preventing future physician shortages. Objective This study examined the relationship between burnout, second victim, and moral injury experiences before and during the COVID-19 pandemic among hospitalists. Methods Two anonymous cross-sectional surveys of hospitalists from a community hospital in the metropolitan Washington, DC area were conducted. One was conducted pre-COVID-19 (September-November 2019) and one was conducted during COVID-19 (July-August 2020). The surveys were sent to all full-time hospitalists via an online survey platform. A variety of areas were assessed including demographic (e.g., age, gender), work information (e.g., hours per week, years of experience), burnout, second victim experiences, well-being, and moral injury. Results Burnout rates among providers during these two time periods were similar. Second victim experiences remained prevalent in those who experienced burnout both pre and during COVID-19, but interestingly the prevalence increased in those without burnout during COVID-19. Moral injury was predictive of burnout during COVID-19. Conclusion While there were some factors that predicted burnout that were similar both pre- and during-pandemic, moral injury was unique to predicting burnout during COVID-19. With burnout as a contributing factor to future physician shortages, it is imperative that predictive factors in a variety of different environments are well understood to prevent future shortages. Hospitalists may be an excellent barometer of these factors given their presence on the front line during the pandemic, and their experiences need to be further explored so that targeted interventions aimed at addressing those factors may be created."
https://openalex.org/W4301181066,"Life-time prevalence of low back pain (LBP) in children and adolescents varies from 7% to 72%. Disc changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been reported in up to 44% of children with earliest observations around pre-puberty. In this longitudinal cohort study, our objective was to determine the natural history of disc changes from childhood to early adulthood, and the possible association of these changes to LBP. Healthy 8-year-old schoolchildren were recruited for this longitudinal study consisting of a semi-structured interview, a clinical examination, and an MRI investigation at the age of 8-9 (Y8), 11-12 (Y12) and 18-19 (Y19) years. The interview inquired about LBP without trauma. T2-weighted sagittal MRI of the lumbar spine was acquired. Life-long prevalence of LBP was determined, and the disc signal intensity (SI) at the three lowest lumbar levels was assessed both visually using the Schneiderman classification (Bright-Speckled-Dark), and digitally using the disc to cerebrospinal fluid -SI ratio. Possible associations between SI changes and LBP were analyzed. Ninety-four of 208 eligible children were included at Y8 in 1994, 13 and 23 participants were lost to follow-up at Y12 and Y19, respectively. Prevalence of LBP increased after the pubertal growth spurt reaching 54% at Y19. On MRI, 18%, 10% and 38% of participants had disc SI changes at Y8, Y12 and Y19, respectively. No significant associations between self-reported LBP and either qualitative or quantitative disc SI changes were observed at any age. Life-time prevalence of LBP reached 54% by early adulthood. Disc SI changes on MRI traditionally labeled as degenerative were seen earlier than previously reported. Changes in disc SI were not associated with the presence of LBP in childhood, adolescence or early adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W4301181068,"To investigate the prevalence and risk factors of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in a Chinese population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in a suburb (Qingpu) of Shanghai, China.A population-based cross-sectional study. A total of 7462 residents with T2DM in Qingpu were enrolled according to the resident health archives from January 2020 to December 2020. Blood and urine samples of the subjects were collected. Disc- and macula-centred retinal images were taken to assess DR. SPSS was used to analyse and investigate the prevalence and risk factors of DR.The fundus images of 6380 (85.5%) subjects were of sufficiently good quality for grading. The average (range) age of 6380 subjects was 63.46±7.77 (28-92) years. Six hundred forty-four subjects were diagnosed with DR. The prevalence of DR was 10.1% (95% CI 9.4%-10.8%), with mild, moderate, and severe non-proliferative retinopathy and proliferative retinopathy being 2.1%, 6.3%, 1.3% and 0.4%, respectively. The prevalence of bilateral DR was 6.5%. Higher T2DM duration (OR, 1.057), fasting plasma glucose (OR, 1.063), glycated hemoglobinA1c (OR, 1.269), urea nitrogen (OR, 1.059), and urinary albumin (OR, 1.001) were associated with the higher DR prevalence.The prevalence of DR among Chinese adults with T2DM in Qingpu was 10.1%, in which non-proliferative DR was more common. Higher fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobinA1c are well-known risk factors of DR, consistent with the findings in our study. Our study didn't find the risk between lipid indicators and DR. However, several renal function indicators, like higher urea nitrogen and urinary albumin, were risk factors for DR in this study. Appropriate diagnosis and intervention should be taken in time to prevent and control DR development."
https://openalex.org/W4301374074,"Owing to the development of computerized vision technology, object detection based on convolutional neural networks is being widely used in the field of bridge crack detection. However, these networks have limited utility in bridge crack detection because of low precision and poor real-time performance. In this study, an improved single-shot multi-box detector (SSD) called ISSD is proposed, which seamlessly combines the depth separable deformation convolution module (DSDCM), inception module (IM), and feature recalibration module (FRM) in a tightly coupled manner to tackle the challenges of bridge crack detection. Specifically, DSDCM was utilized for extracting the characteristic information of irregularly shaped bridge cracks. IM was designed to expand the width of the network, reduce network calculations, and improve network computing speed. The FRM was employed to determine the importance of each feature channel through learning, enhance the useful features according to their importance, and suppress the features that are insignificant for bridge crack detection. The experimental results demonstrated that ISSD is effective in bridge crack detection tasks and offers competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art networks."
https://openalex.org/W4301374213,"The income gap between urban and rural residents has long been a predicament for China. The differences between returns to education in urban and rural China are one of the important factors affecting the income gap. Using a combination of data from CHNS, CHIP, CGSS, CFPS, CHFS, and CSS, the differences in returns to education and its evolution in China from 1989 to 2019 were estimated. Results show that returns to education in urban China have been consistently higher than that in rural China. Returns to education in urban China show a trend of progressive increase, then a rapid rise, before turning into a slow decline and gradually leveling off; returns to education in rural China exhibit a slowly increasing trend before gradually leveling off; the differences between returns to education in urban and rural China show an evolution of first growing larger, then smaller, before gradually leveling off. The spouse's education was considered the instrumental variable of individuals' education. The robustness test was done with an estimation through a two-stage least squares (2SLS) method. Results indicate that the empirical conclusion has good robustness. The evolution of returns to education in China was explained in terms of the marketization of labor forces, the relative supply and demand of labor forces, the reform of the household registration system, and the evolution of the quality of education."
https://openalex.org/W4301603124,"Water homeostasis is tightly regulated by the kidneys via the process of urine concentration. During reduced water intake, the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) binds to the vasopressin receptor type II (V2R) in the kidney to enhance countercurrent multiplication and medullary osmolality, and increase water reabsorption via aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channels. The importance of this AVP, V2R, and AQP2 axis is highlighted by low urine osmolality and polyuria in people with various water balance disorders, including nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). ELF5 and nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5) are two transcription factors proposed to regulate Aqp2 expression, but their role is poorly defined. Here we generated two novel mouse lines with principal cell (PC)-specific deletion of ELF5 or NFAT5 and phenotyped them in respect to renal water handling. ELF5-deficient mice (ELF5PC-KO ) had a very mild phenotype, with no clear differences in AQP2 abundance, and mild differences in renal water handling and maximal urinary concentrating capacity. In contrast, NFAT5 (NFAT5PC-KO ) mice had significantly higher water intake and their 24 h urine volume was almost 10-fold greater than controls. After challenging with dDAVP or 8 h water restriction, NFAT5PC-KO mice were unable to concentrate their urine, demonstrating that they suffer from NDI. The abundance of AQP2, other AQPs, and the urea transporter UT-A1 were greatly decreased in NFAT5PC-KO mice. In conclusion, NFAT5 is a major regulator of not only Aqp2 gene transcription, but also other genes important for water homeostasis and its absence leads to the development of NDI."
https://openalex.org/W4301181116,"COVID-19 had affected the health-care-seeking behavior of people with chronic medical conditions. The impact is even worse in resource-limited settings like Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess the extent and correlates of missed appointments among adults with chronic disease conditions before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Northwest Ethiopia.A retrospective chart review and cross-sectional survey were conducted from December 2020 to February 2021. A total of 1833 patients with common chronic disease were included by using a stratified systematic random sampling technique. Web-based data collection was done using Kobo collect. The data were explored using descriptive statistical techniques, the rate of missed appointments s before and during the COVID-19 pandemic was determined. A negative binomial regression model was fitted to identify the factors of missed appointment. An incidence rate ratio with its 95% confidence interval (CI) and p-value of the final model were reported.The rate of missed appointments was 12.5% (95% CI: 11.13%, 14.20%) before the pandemic, increased to 26.8% (95% CI: 24.73%, 28.82%) during the pandemic (p-value < 0.001). Fear of COVID-19 infection and lack of transport was the most common reasons for missing appointments. Older patients (Adjusted Incidence Rate Ratio (AIRR) = 1.01, 95% CI: 1.001; 1.015), having treatment follow up more than 5 years (AIRR = 1.36, 95%CI: 1.103; 1.69), shorter frequency of follow-up (AIRR = 2.22, 95% CI: 1.63; 2.49), covering expense out of pocket (AIRR = 2.26, 95%CI: 1.41; 2.95), having a sedentary lifestyle (AIRR = 1.36, 95%CI: 1.12; 1.71), and history of missed appointments before COVID-19 pandemic (AIRR = 4.27, 95%CI: 3.35; 5.43) were positively associated with the incidence of missed appointments.The rate of missed appointment increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older age, longer duration of follow up, more frequent follow-up, out-of-pocket expenditure for health service, history of poor follow-up, and sedentary lifestyle had positive relationship with missed appointments during the pandemic. Therefore, it is important to give special emphasis to individuals with these risk factors while designing and implementing policies and strategies for peoples with chronic diseases to ensure the continuity of care and to avoid the long-term impact on their health."
https://openalex.org/W4301181125,"HIV/AIDS is now a chronic disease, as adherence to anti-retrovirals impacts positively on the quality as well as expectancy of life. However, there exist multifaceted barriers to treatments for which children are most disadvantaged. Since Ghana subscribed to the ""treat all"" policy less percentage (25.5%) of children (2-14 years) living with HIV/AIDS have been enrolled on the antiretroviral program compared to other categories of the population by 2019. At present no study has explored these barriers to children living with HIV/AIDS enrollment and adherence. This study aims to explore the perceived barriers of caregivers of children living with HIV/AIDS in the Tamale Metropolis.We used descriptive phenomenology to explore the phenomena. Caregivers were purposively selected and interviewed till information became repetitive at the ninth (9th) caregiver. A semi-structured interview guide was used to collect data through face-to-face in-depth interviews which were audio recorded. The interviews lasted an average of 47 minutes. Audio interviews were transcribed verbatim (English) and translated back-to-back (Daghani) before analysis was done manually according to Collaizi's seven-step approach. We used the Guba and Lincoln guidelines to ensure the rigour of the study and its findings. Results are presented in themes and supported with quotes.Six themes emerged from the analysis of the caregivers' transcripts; (1) denial of HIV/AID diagnosis, (2) stock-outs and privacy at the clinic, (3) busy schedule and poor support, (4) ignorance and alternative herbal cure, (5) stigma and discrimination, (6) transportation and distance.Perceived barriers are multi-dimensional and encountered by all PLWHA, especially children. These barriers could derail the gains of HIV/AIDS interventions among children. Adherence counselling among caregivers alongside campaigns among faith and herbal healers are of grave concern to reduce myths of cure."
https://openalex.org/W4301374077,"Background The Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert-Ultra) assay provides timely results with good sensitivity and acceptable specificity with stool specimens in children for bacteriological confirmation of tuberculosis (TB). This study aims to optimize the Simple One-Step (SOS) stool processing method for testing stool specimens using the Xpert-Ultra in children and adults in selected health facilities in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The study is designed to assess the robustness of the SOS stool method, to help fine-tune the practical aspects of performing the test and to provide insights in stool storage conditions and sampling strategies before the method can be implemented and scaled in routine settings in Ethiopia as well as globally. Methods and design The project “painless optimized diagnosis of TB in Ethiopian children” (PODTEC) will be a cross sectional study where three key experiments will be carried out focusing on 1) sampling strategy to investigate if the Xpert-Ultra M . tuberculosis (MTB) -positivity rate depends on stool consistency, and if sensitivity can be increased by taking more than one stool specimen from the same participant, or doing multiple tests from the same stool specimen, 2) storage conditions to determine how long and at what temperature stool can be stored without losing sensitivity, and 3) optimization of sensitivity and robustness of the SOS stool processing method by varying stool processing steps, stool volume, and storage time and conditions of the stool-sample reagent mixture. Stool specimens will be collected from participants (children and adults) who are either sputum or naso-gastric aspiration (NGA) and/or stool Xpert-Ultra MTB positive depending on the experiment. Stool specimens from these participants, recruited from 22 sites for an ongoing related study, will be utilized for the PODTEC experiments. The sample size is estimated to be 50 participants. We will use EpiData for data entry and Stata for data analysis purposes. The main analyses will include computing the loss or gain in the Xpert-Ultra MTB positivity rate and rates of non-determinate Xpert-Ultra test results per experiment compared to the Xpert-Ultra MTB result of stool processed according to the published standard operating procedures for SOS stool processing. The differences in the MTB positivity rate by regarding testing more than one sample per child, and using different storage, and processing conditions, will be also compared to the baseline (on-site) Xpert-Ultra result."
https://openalex.org/W4301374201,"Understanding the transition from quiescent primordial follicles to activated primary follicles is vital for characterizing ovarian folliculogenesis and improving assisted reproductive techniques. To date, no study has investigated preantral follicle crowding in the ovaries of livestock or characterized these crowds according to follicular morphology and ovarian location (portions and regions) in any species. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the crowding (clustering and neighborhood) patterns of preantral follicles in the equine ovary according to mare age, follicular morphology and developmental stage, and spatial location in the ovary. Ovaries from mares (n = 8) were collected at an abattoir and processed histologically for evaluation of follicular clustering using the Morisita Index and follicular neighborhoods in ovarian sections. Young mares were found to have a large number of preantral follicles with neighbors (n = 2,626), while old mares had a small number (n = 305). Moreover, young mares had a higher number of neighbors per follicle (2.6 ± 0.0) than old mares (1.2 ± 0.1). Follicle clustering was shown to be present in all areas of the ovary, with young mares having more clustering overall than old mares and a tendency for higher clustering in the ventral region when ages were combined. Furthermore, follicles with neighbors were more likely to be morphologically normal (76.5 ± 6.5%) than abnormal (23.5 ± 6.5%). Additionally, morphologically normal activated follicles had increased odds of having neighbors than normal resting follicles, and these normal activated follicles had more neighbors (2.6 ± 0.1) than normal resting follicles (2.3 ± 0.1 neighbors). In the present study, it was demonstrated that preantral follicles do crowd in the mare ovary and that clustering/neighborhood patterns are dynamic and differ depending on mare age, follicular morphology, and follicular developmental stage."

https://openalex.org/W4301603231,"Despite the high prevalence of hypospadias and cryptorchidism, the genetic basis for these conditions is only beginning to be understood. Using array-comparative-genomic-hybridization (aCGH), potassium-channel-tetramerization-domain-containing-13 (KCTD13) encoded at 16p11.2 was identified as a candidate gene involved in hypospadias, cryptorchidism and other genitourinary (GU) tract anomalies. Copy number variants (CNVs) at 16p11.2 are among the most common syndromic genomic variants identified to date. Many patients with CNVs at this locus exhibit GU and/or neurodevelopmental phenotypes. KCTD13 encodes a substrate-specific adapter of a BCR (BTB-CUL3-RBX1) E3-ubiquitin-protein-ligase complex (BCR (BTB-CUL3-RBX1) E3-ubiquitin-protein-ligase complex (B-cell receptor (BCR) [BTB (the BTB domain is a conserved motif involved in protein-protein interactions) Cullin3 complex RING protein Rbx1] E3-ubiqutin-protein-ligase complex), which has essential roles in the regulation of cellular cytoskeleton, migration, proliferation, and neurodevelopment; yet its role in GU development is unknown. The prevalence of KCTD13 CNVs in patients with GU anomalies (2.58%) is significantly elevated when compared with patients without GU anomalies or in the general population (0.10%). KCTD13 is robustly expressed in the developing GU tract. Loss of KCTD13 in cell lines results in significantly decreased levels of nuclear androgen receptor (AR), suggesting that loss of KCTD13 affects AR sub-cellular localization. Kctd13 haploinsufficiency and homozygous deletion in mice cause a significant increase in the incidence of cryptorchidism and micropenis. KCTD13-deficient mice exhibit testicular and penile abnormalities together with significantly reduced levels of nuclear AR and SOX9. In conclusion, gene-dosage changes of murine Kctd13 diminish nuclear AR sub-cellular localization, as well as decrease SOX9 expression levels which likely contribute in part to the abnormal GU tract development in Kctd13 mouse models and in patients with CNVs in KCTD13."

https://openalex.org/W4301181081,"Participation in sports groups has health benefits for older adults, such as preventing functional limitations and social isolation. Encouraging participation in sports groups may be an important means of health promotion in older adults. However, there is insufficient research on the determinants of new participation in sports groups to consider effective interventions to promote participation in these groups. We investigated this using data from a 1-year prospective study. Data were obtained from “The Otassha Study” that assessed a cohort of community-dwelling older adults living in an urban area of Japan. Of 769 older adults who participated in a baseline health survey in 2018, 557 participated in a follow-up survey in 2019. We excluded 184 individuals who already participated in sports groups at baseline and 36 with missing data. Participation in sports groups was defined as that occurring more than once a week. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the determinants of new participation in sports groups, with sociodemographic factors, lifestyle habits, physical functions, cognitive functions, psychological factors, and social factors as independent variables. Forty-one (12.2%) individuals participated in sports groups at follow-up. In the multiple adjusted logistic regression model, new participation in sports groups was significantly associated with female sex (odds ratio [OR] = 5.57, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.61‒19.26), engagement in regular exercise (OR = 2.23, 95%CI: 1.03‒4.84), and having a large social network (OR = 1.12, 95%CI: 1.04‒1.20). Physical functions were not associated with new participation. Determinants of new participation were lifestyle habits and social factors, rather than physical functions. Intervention through social networks may be effective in encouraging new participation in sports groups, which, in turn, may facilitate healthy aging."
https://openalex.org/W4301181114,"Objective This study investigated how peripheral axonal excitability changes in ischemic stroke patients with hemiparesis or hemiplegia, reflecting the plasticity of motor axons due to corticospinal tract alterations along the poststroke stage. Methods Each subject received a clinical evaluation, nerve conduction study, and nerve excitability test. Nerve excitability tests were performed on motor median nerves in paretic and non-paretic limbs in the acute stage of stroke. Control nerve excitability test data were obtained from age-matched control subjects. Some patients underwent excitability examinations several times in subacute or chronic stages. Results A total of thirty patients with acute ischemic stroke were enrolled. Eight patients were excluded due to severe entrapment neuropathy in the median nerve. The threshold current for 50% compound muscle action potential (CMAP) was higher in paretic limbs than in control subjects. Furthermore, in the cohort with severe patients (muscle power ≤ 3/5 in affected hands), increased threshold current for 50% CMAP and reduced subexcitability were noted in affected limbs than in unaffected limbs. In addition, in the subsequent study of those severe patients, threshold electrotonus increased in the hyperpolarization direction: TEh (100–109 ms), and the minimum I/V slope decreased. The above findings suggest the less excitable and less accommodation in lower motor axons in the paretic limb caused by ischemic stroke. Conclusion Upper motor neuron injury after stroke can alter nerve excitability in lower motor neurons, and the changes are more obvious in severely paretic limbs. The accommodative changes of axons progress from the subacute to the chronic stage after stroke. Further investigation is necessary to explore the downstream effects of an upper motor neuron insult in the peripheral nerve system."

The aim of this work was to study the accumulation of iodine and the physiochemical changes in bean ( Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and pea ( Pisum sativum L.) irrigated with iodine-containing water. Applying iodine at concentration of 0.5 mg L -1 resulted 51, 18, and 35% decrement in biomass of bean fruit, while in pea fruit, a 13% reduction and a 3 and 2% increment were observed when the plants were cultivated in sand, sandy silt, and silt, respectively. The highest iodine concentrations in the bean and pea fruits were detected in plants cultivated in silt soil with concentration of 0.5 mg I - L -1 and amounted to 1.6 and 0.4 mg kg -1 , respectively. In presence of iodine at concentration of 0.5 mg L -1 , the concentration of magnesium, phosphorous, manganese and iron increased in the bean fruit, while in the case of pea, at iodine concentration above 0.1 mg L -1 the uptake of these nutrients were hampered. Based on these facts, the iodized bean can be recommended as a possible food source to enhance the iodine intake."

Pregnancy rate of 2982 heifers and primiparous cows was studied as a function of animal category, average daily gain during the breeding season, stocking rate, pasture type and body weight at the beginning of the breeding season. Data were obtained from 43 experiments conducted in commercial ranches and research stations in the Pampas region between 1976 and 2015. Stocking rate ranged from 200 to 464 kg live weight ha -1 , which brackets values for most of the grazinglands in similar regions. Age at breeding was 14–36 months (24.6±7.5 months); initial breeding weights were 129–506 kg and 194–570 kg for heifers and primiparous cows. Pregnancy rate was modeled with an apriori set of explanatory variables where proximate variables (breed, body weight at start of breeding, weight gain during breeding and category) were included first and subsequently modeled as functions of other variables (pasture type, supplementation and stocking rate). This modeling approach allowed detection of direct and indirect effects (through nutrition and body weight) of factors that affect pregnancy rate. Bos taurus breeds (N = 1058) had higher pregnancy rate than B . Taurus x B . indicus crossbreed (N = 1924) females. Pregnancy rate of heifers and primiparous cows grazing in natural grasslands decreased with increasing stocking rate, but no effect of stocking rate was detected in cultivated and improved pastures. Pregnancy rate increased with increasing average daily gain during the breeding season. Use of cultivated or improved natural pastures promotes higher pregnancy rate, as well as allows an increase in stocking rate at the regional level. Body weight at the start of the breeding season is the primary determinant of pregnancy rates in heifer and primiparous cows."
https://openalex.org/W4301374107,"Good menstrual hygiene practice is critical to the health of adolescent girls and women. In Ghanaian public schools, the School Health Education Program which includes menstrual health education has been instituted to equip adolescents with knowledge on menstruation and its related good hygiene practices. However, in most communities, menstruation is scarcely discussed openly due to mostly negative social and religious beliefs about menstruation. In this study, we examined socio-cultural factors associated with knowledge, attitudes and menstrual hygiene practices among Junior High School adolescent girls in the Kpando Municipality of Ghana.A mixed method approach was employed with 480 respondents. A survey was conducted among 390 adolescent girls using interviewer-administered questionnaires to collect data on knowledge of menstruation and menstrual hygiene practices. Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) using a discussion guide were conducted among 90 respondents in groups of 9 members. The FGD was used to collect data on socio-cultural beliefs and practices regarding menstruation. Descriptive and inferential statistics and content analysis were used to analyze the quantitative and qualitative data respectively.Most (80%) of the study participants had good knowledge of menstruation. Also, most (82%) of the participants practiced good menstrual hygiene. Attending a public (AOR = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.12-0.48, p<0.001) and rural (AOR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.21-0.75, p<0.01) school was significantly associated with reduced odds of practicing good menstrual hygiene. Good knowledge of menstruation was associated with increased odds of good hygiene practices (AOR = 4.31, 95% CI = 2.39-7.90, p<0.001). Qualitative results showed that teachers provided adolescents with more detailed biological information on menstruation than key informants (family members) did at menarche. However, both teachers and family members spoke positively of menstruation to adolescent girls. Social and religious beliefs indicate that menstruation is evil and unclean. Such beliefs influenced community members' attitudes towards adolescent girls and led to practices such as isolating menstruating girls and limiting their ability to interact and participate in certain community and religious activities.Despite the prominence of negative social and religious beliefs about menstruation, good menstrual hygiene practice was high among study participants. Knowledge of menstruation; place of residents; and type of school were the major factors associated with good menstrual hygiene practice. It is therefore, necessary to intensify the School Health Education Program in both rural and urban public and intensively involve private schools as well to ensure equal access to accurate information on menstruation and good menstrual hygiene practices among adolescent girls."
https://openalex.org/W4301374127,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, the relevance of evaluating the effectiveness of face masks–especially those made at home using a variety of materials–has become obvious. However, quantifying mask protection often requires sophisticated equipment. Using a frugal stain technique, here we quantify the “ballistic” droplets reaching a receptor from a jet-emitting source which mimics a coughing, sneezing or talking human–in real life, such droplets may host active SARS-CoV-2 virus able to replicate in the nasopharynx. We demonstrate that materials often used in home-made face masks block most of the droplets. Mimicking situations eventually found in daily life, we also show quantitatively that less liquid carried by ballistic droplets reaches a receptor when a blocking material is deployed near the source than when located near the receptor, which supports the paradigm that your face mask does protect you, but protects others even better than you. Finally, the blocking behavior can be quantitatively explained by a simple mechanical model."
https://openalex.org/W4301374144,"In Europe, there is a dearth of studies on abortion-related mobilities within countries where abortion is legal. In France, 18% of women seek abortion care outside their department of residence care. Most of these flows take place within Île-de-France region. This paper aims at providing novel insights into the motives and experiences of women traveling within France and particularly within the Île-de-France region for abortion care. It draws upon official abortion statistics as well as quantitative and qualitative data collected in three Parisian hospitals during a five-year European research project on barriers to legal abortion and abortion travel. Despite governmental efforts to facilitate access to abortions over the past decades, our findings show that various barriers exist for why women do not find services in their department of residence (lack of services or access to preferred methods, quality of care, long waiting times). However, most of our study participants report coming to Paris as a convenience and use commuting as a strategy to overcome obstacles in receiving abortion care."
https://openalex.org/W4301374156,"In opinion dynamics, as in general usage, polarisation is subjective. To understand polarisation, we need to develop more precise methods to measure the agreement in society. This paper presents four mathematical measures of polarisation derived from graph and network representations of societies and information-theoretic divergences or distance metrics. Two of the methods, min-max flow and spectral radius, rely on graph theory and define polarisation in terms of the structural characteristics of networks. The other two methods represent opinions as probability density functions and use the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Hellinger distance as polarisation measures. We present a series of opinion dynamics simulations from two common models to test the effectiveness of the methods. Results show that the four measures provide insight into the different aspects of polarisation and allow real-time monitoring of social networks for indicators of polarisation. The three measures, the spectral radius, Kullback-Leibler divergence and Hellinger distance, smoothly delineated between different amounts of polarisation, i.e. how many cluster there were in the simulation, while also measuring with more granularity how close simulations were to consensus. Min-max flow failed to accomplish such nuance."
https://openalex.org/W4301374174,"Objectives Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) are high priority targets of global antimicrobial surveillance. Herein, we determined the colonization rate of CPE on admission to intensive care units in Vientiane, Lao PDR in August-September 2019. Methods Data regarding clinical conditions, infection control, and antibiotic usage were collected during admission. Rectal swab samples (n = 137) collected during admission were inoculated to selective chromogenic agars, followed by confirmatory tests for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and carbapenemases. All CPE isolates were sequenced on Illumina (HiSeq2500), reads assembled using SPAdes 3.13, and the draft genomes used to query a database ( https://www.genomicepidemiology.org ) for resistome, plasmid replicons, and sequence types (ST). Optical DNA mapping (ODM) was used to characterize plasmids and to determine location of resistance genes. Minimum spanning tree was generated using the Bacterial Isolate Genome Sequence database (BIGSdb) and annotated using iTOL. Result From 47 Enterobacterales isolated on selective agars, K . pneumoniae (25/47) and E . coli (12/47) were the most prevalent species, followed by K aerogenes (2/47), K . variicola (1/47), and K . oxytoca (1/47). The overall prevalence of ESBLs was 51.0%; E . coli 83.3% (10/12) and Klebsiella spp. 41.3% (12/29). Twenty percent of the K . pneumoniae (5/25) isolates were carbapenem-resistant, and 4/5 contained the bla NDM-1 gene. All bla NDM-1 isolates belonged to ST147 and were indistinguishable with cgMLST. ODM showed that the bla NDM-1 gene was located on identical plasmids in all isolates. Conclusion The prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacterales was high, while carbapenemases were less common. However, the detection of clonal dissemination of bla NDM-1 -producing K . pneumoniae isolates in one of the intensive care units calls for vigilance. Stringent infection prevention and antimicrobial stewardship strategies are highly important measures."
https://openalex.org/W4301374175,"In the current study, we separately tested whether coordinated decision-making increases altruism and whether it increases trust. To this end, we implemented a paradigm in which participants repeatedly perform a coordinated decision-making task either with the same partner on every trial, or with a different partner on each trial. When both players coordinate on the same option, both are rewarded. In Experiment 1 ( N = 52), participants were sometimes presented with tempting opportunities to defect. In Experiment 2 ( N = 97), participants sometimes had to decide whether or not to trust that their partners had resisted such tempting opportunities. The results show that repeatedly coordinating with the same partner increased participants’ resistance to temptation (Experiment 1) but did not increase trust (Experiment 2). These findings support the hypothesis that coordinating with a partner increases altruistic motivation towards that partner; they do not support the hypothesis that coordinating boosts trust."
https://openalex.org/W4301374177,"3D object detection is vital in the environment perception of autonomous driving. The current monocular 3D object detection technology mainly uses RGB images and pseudo radar point clouds as input. The methods of taking RGB images as input need to learn with geometric constraints and ignore the depth information in the picture, leading to the method being too complicated and inefficient. Although some image-based methods use depth map information for post-calibration and correction, such methods usually require a high-precision depth estimation network. The methods of using the pseudo radar point cloud as input easily introduce noise in the conversion process of depth information to the pseudo radar point cloud, which cause a large deviation in the detection process and ignores semantic information simultaneously. We introduce dynamic convolution guided by the depth map into the feature extraction network, the convolution kernel of dynamic convolution automatically learns from the depth map of the image. It solves the problem that depth information and semantic information cannot be used simultaneously and improves the accuracy of monocular 3D object detection. MonoDCN is able to significantly improve the performance of both monocular 3D object detection and Bird's Eye View tasks within the KITTI urban autonomous driving dataset."
https://openalex.org/W4301374193,"Researchers continue to explore ways to understand and promote pro-environmental behavior (PEB) amongst various populations. Despite this shared goal, much debate exists on the operationalization and the dimensionality of PEB and how it is measured. This piecemeal approach to measurement has limited the ability to draw conclusions across studies. We address limitations associated with previous measures of PEB by developing a multi-dimensional scale that is validated across both a general population of individuals residing in the United States as well as a group of individuals associated with a pro-environmental organization. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and reliability estimation were conducted for the developed measure across these two populations. Measurement invariance testing was also utilized to assess the psychometric stability of the scale across the two groups. Results indicated an 11 item scale was best fitting with two sub-scales: private and public behaviors. Implications for research and practice are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4301390461,"Background The mRNA expression of protein Up-Frameshift Suppressor 3 Homolog B (UPF3B) differ in different tumors. However, the clinical relevance of UPF3B in cancer patients, such as with prognosis, tumor stage, and levels of tumor-infiltrating immune cells remain unclear. Methods We performed bioinformatics analysis of UPF3B with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database ( https://xenabrowser.net ) and TIMER2.0 (Tumor Immune Estimation Resource 2.0, http://timer.comp-genomics.org/ ). UPF3B expression in 33 cancers versus counterpart normal tissues was analyzed using TCGA pan-cancer data. The influence of UPF3B in long-term prognosis was evaluated using Kaplan–Meier method, and the associations between UPF3B transcription levels and immune-related gene expression, immune cell infiltration, tumor microenvironment (TME) score are analyzed by spearman correlation analysis. Enrichment analysis of UPF3B was conducted using the R package “clusterProfiler.” Results The transcriptional level of UPF3B was dysregulated in the human pan-cancer dataset. A significant correlation was found between the expression of UPF3B and the pathological stage of Esophageal Carcinoma (ESCA), Kidney Chromophobe (KIHC), Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (LIHC), and Skin Cutaneous Melanoma (SKCM). Multiple cancer types with high transcriptional levels of UPF3B were associated with a significantly worse prognosis. The functions of expressed UPF3B gene are primarily related to ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, cell cycle, and mRNA surveillance pathway. Our results also show that immune cells infiltration and immunosuppressive markers such as CTLA-4, PD-1 and PD-L1 significantly correlate with UPF3B expression. Conclusions In the present study, we synthetically explored the expression status and prognostic significance of UPF3B, and the relationship with clinic characters and immune microenvironment across cancers. Our results may provide novel insights for UPF3B as an immunotherapeutic target and valuable prognostic biomarker in various malignant tumor."

Such reduction introduces new challenges, such as the loss of wrist articulation or the impossibility of overcoming obstacles. A possible approach is using multi-steerable cable-driven instruments fully mechanical actuated, which allow great maneuverability while keeping the wound small. In this work, we compared the usability of the two most promising cable configurations in 3D printed multi-steerable instruments: a parallel configuration with all cables running straight from the steerable shaft to the handle; and a multi configuration with straight cables in combination with helical cables. Twelve participants were divided into two groups and asked to orient the instrument shaft and randomly hit six targets following the instructions in a laparoscopic simulator. Each participant carried out four trials (two trials for each instrument) with 12 runs per trial. The average task performance time showed a significant decrease over the first trial for both configurations. The decrease was 48% for the parallel and 41% for the multi configuration. Improvement of task performance times reached a plateau in the second trial with both instruments. The participants filled out a TLX questionnaire after each trial. The questionnaire showed a lower burden score for the parallel compared to multi configuration (23% VS 30%). Even though the task performance time for both configurations was comparable, a final questionnaire showed that 10 out of 12 participants preferred the parallel configuration due to a more intuitive hand movement and the possibility of individually orienting the distal end of the steerable shaft."
https://openalex.org/W4301181115,"Participation restriction has detrimental effects for older adults but it is unknown how participation differs for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) compared to older adults of the same age without respiratory conditions. We compared scores on the Late Life Disability Instrument (LLDI) between people with COPD (study group) and a random sample of older adults (control group).Participants with COPD (study group) were recruited from two hospitals in Ontario and age- and sex-matched with a ratio of 1:2 with participants from a random sample of community-dwelling older adults who did not report having respiratory conditions (control group). The study group completed the LLDI prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and the control group completed the LLDI at the end of the first wave of the pandemic. LLDI frequency and limitation scores were compared between groups using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.Forty-six study group participants (mean age 74.2 (SD 5.5) years) and 92 control group participants (mean age 74.4 (SD 5.4) years) were included. Fifty-four percent of the participants were female. The majority of the study group had severe COPD (median forced expiratory volume in one second of 34.5 (25th-75th percentile 27.0-56.0) % predicted). LLDI sores were lower for the study group compared to the control group for both the frequency (median difference -5.4 points, p<0.001) and limitation (median difference -7.6 points, p<0.001) domains. The personal subscale demonstrated the largest magnitude of difference between groups (median difference -13.4 points) and the social subscale demonstrated the smallest magnitude of difference (-5.2 points).People with COPD had greater participation restrictions than a random sample of older adults without ongoing respiratory conditions. The differences seen in participation between the two groups may have been reduced due to temporal confounding from the COVID-19 pandemic. While participation is relevant to all older adults, our results suggest that it is especially important that it be assessed in those with COPD."
https://openalex.org/W4301181117,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a disease of lymphoid progenitor cells with an often aggressive course and is commonly caused by the BCR-ABL fusion gene t(9;22) in adults. This fusion gene encodes a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that can be effectively inhibited by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), with imatinib being the paradigmatic agent of this class. However, BCR-ABL+ ALL cells rapidly develop mutations against many of the available TKIs, and consecutive disease relapse still results in an overall unfavorable prognosis for patients with this disease. To date, allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only known curative therapeutic option for the mostly elderly patients with BCR-ABL+ ALL. The discrepancy between the limited therapeutic armamentarium and the growing therapeutic need in an aging population is therefore a reason to test drug combinations against BCR-ABL+ ALL. In this study, we demonstrate that the combination of TKIs with proteasome inhibitors efficiently and under certain conditions synergistically exerts cytotoxic effects in BCR-ABL+ ALL cells in vitro with respect to the induction of apoptosis. Both sole and combined treatment of BCR-ABL+ ALL with the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and ixazomib, respectively, and TKI causes a significantly greater reduction in cell viability than TKI treatment alone in both BCR-ABL+ cell lines TOM-1 and BV-173. In BV-173 cells, we observed a significant reduction in cell viability to only 1.26%±0.46% with bortezomib treatment and 1.57±0.7% with combination treatment, whereas cells treated with dasatinib alone still had a viable percentage of 40.58±2.6%. Similar results were obtained when ixazomib was applied to both cell lines, and apoptosis was induced in both cases (93.36%±2.7% apoptotic BV-173 cells when treated with ixazomib and TKI). The combination of TKI and proteasome inhibitor is efficient in vitro, potentially expanding the spectrum of therapeutic options for patients with BCR-ABL+ ALL."
https://openalex.org/W4301181161,"Background Patient experience when transitioning home from hospital is an important quality metric linked to improved patient outcomes. We evaluated the impact of a hospital-based care transition intervention, patient-oriented discharge summary (PODS), on patient experience across Ontario acute care hospitals. Methods We used a repeated cross-sectional study design to compare yearly positive (top-box) responses to four questions centered on discharge communication from the Canadian Patient Experience Survey (2016–2020) among three hospital cohorts with various levels of PODS implementation. Generalized Estimating Equations using a binomial likelihood accounting for site level clustering was used to assess continuous linear time trends among cohorts and cohort differences during the post-implementation period. This research had oversight from a public advisory group of patient and caregiver partners from across the province. Results 512,288 individual responses were included. Compared to non-implementation hospitals, hospitals with full implementation (&gt;50% discharges) reported higher odds for having discussed the help needed when leaving hospital (OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.02–1.37) and having received information in writing about what symptoms to look out for (OR = 1.44, 95% = 1.17–1.78) post-implementation. The linear time trend was also significant when comparing hospitals with full versus no implementation for having received information in writing about what symptoms to look out for (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.01–1.09). Interpretation PODS implementation was associated with higher odds of positive patient experience, particularly for questions focused on discharge planning. Further efforts should center on discharge management, specifically: understanding of medications and what to do if worried once home."
https://openalex.org/W4301374026,"Developing dendritic cells (DCs) from monocytes is a sensitively regulated process. One possible way for cancers to avoid immune recognition and antitumor response is the modulation of DC differentiation. Although several studies are available on the examination of tumor-associated macrophages, a comprehensive analysis focusing on the effects of tumor-formed DCs is not known to date. We provide a comparative analysis of the tumor-edited-monocyte derived DCs differentiated in the presence of adenocarcinomas (MDA, HT29, HeLa)- and primary (WM278, WM983A) or metastatic (WM1617, WM983B) melanomas. The immunomodulatory effect of tumors is mediated at least partly by secreted mediators. We investigated the impact of tumor cell-derived conditioned media on the differentiation of DCs from CD14+ monocytes, sequentially determining the phenotype, cytokine production, phagocytic, and the T cell polarizing capacity of moDCs. We completed our observations by analyzing our data with bioinformatic tools to provide objective correlations between phenotypical and functional properties of different tumor-educated moDCs. The correlation analysis revealed significant differences in the characteristics of adenocarcinomas- or melanomas-edited moDCs. We highlight the functional differences in the properties of moDCs differentiated in the presence of various cancer cell lines. We offer new information and options for the in vitro differentiation protocols of various tumor-conditioned moDCs. Our results confirm that various immunomodulatory properties of different tumor cell lines result in multiple manipulations of DC differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W4301374051,"Aim To explore informal caregivers’ experiences and perspectives concerning assistive technology (AT) in two nursing homes, through the conceptual lens of person-centredness. Background The integration and use of AT and a person-centred approach to care are political intentions within healthcare services, both internationally and in Norway. In nursing homes, informal caregivers are often collaborators with the staff, and can be important partners concerning the implementation of AT in a person-centred way. However, there is little knowledge about the informal caregivers’ perspectives on the use of AT in nursing homes, or of whether or how they are included in the integration and use of AT. Methods The study had a qualitative design and comprised eleven informal caregivers of residents in two nursing homes in Norway. In-depth interviews were used for data collection. The data were analysed using content analysis. COREQ reporting guidelines were applied to ensure comprehensive reporting. Results Emerging themes highlighted the slow-going transition from old to new technology, and how the informal caregivers experienced that AT both promoted and degraded the dignity of their family members. Informal caregivers were positive to the use of technology, but have sparse knowledge and information about ATs in the nursing homes. They express a desire for AT to increase activity and safety, which promotes dignity, quality of life, and quality of the care for their family member. The informal caregivers want their family member to be seen, heard, and to get assistance on their own terms, even with regard to technology. Conclusion Before AT can be implemented, informal caregivers need to be informed and listened to and included in the processes. Through their stories, one can form an idea of how important a person-centred approach is to contributing to individually tailored and introduced AT in collaboration with the informal caregivers."
https://openalex.org/W4301374058,"Since the initial reported discovery of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019, genomic surveillance has been an important tool to understand its transmission and evolution. Here, we sought to describe the underlying regional phylodynamics before and during a rapid spreading event that was documented by surveillance protocols of the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) in late October-November of 2020. We used replicate long-read sequencing on Colorado SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected July through November 2020 at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical campus in Aurora and the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs. Replicate sequencing allowed rigorous validation of variation and placement in a phylogenetic relatedness network. We focus on describing the phylodynamics of a lineage that likely originated in the local Colorado Springs community and expanded rapidly over the course of two months in an outbreak within the well-controlled environment of the United States Air Force Academy. Divergence estimates from sampling dates indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 lineage associated with this rapid expansion event originated in late October 2020. These results are in agreement with transmission pathways inferred by the United States Air Force Academy, and provide a window into the evolutionary process and transmission dynamics of a potentially dangerous but ultimately contained variant."

No prognostic markers have been reported after resection of CRLM. In this study, we investigated the association between inflammation-based score and prognosis after R0 resection in patients with CRLM.We retrospectively investigated 90 patients who underwent R0 resection for CRLM between 2008 and 2018. We calculated colon inflammatory index (CII) (CII0, low risk; CII1, intermediate risk; and CII2, high risk), modified Glasgow prognostic score, prognostic nutritional index, and CRP-to-albumin ratio; and retrospectively assessed the relationship between these scores, the clinicopathological features, and prognosis.The median follow-up period was 44 months (range, 2-101 months). Five-year relapse-free survival (RFS) (CII2; 12.5%, CII1; 14.5%, CII0; 42.9%) and 5-year overall survival (OS) (CII2; 32.4%, CII1; 25.4%, CII0; 57.7%) were significantly lower in the high CII groups (CII1-2) compared with the low CII group (CII0) (p = 0.021 and p = 0.006, respectively). CEA level was significantly higher in the high CII group than the low CII group (12.4 vs 7.3, p = 0.004). Multivariate analysis showed CII score as an independent predictor of RFS (hazard ratio 2.128, 95%CI 1.147-3.430, p = 0.015) and OS (hazard ratio 2.639, 95%CI 1.331-5.323, p = 0.005).CII shows promise as a prognostic marker after R0 liver resection in patients with CRLM."

This study aimed to investigate the repercussions of non-prescription anthelmintics for cancer treatment and evaluate their perceived effectiveness and adverse effects. This survey included 86 cancer patients, aged 19 years and older, who underwent anthelmintic therapy for cancer. They were recruited from two online communities in South Korea through a structured questionnaire that was provided online. Cancer patients under non-prescription anthelmintic therapy for cancer in South Korea were mostly in their advanced stages and had started the treatment in 2019. About half of the cancer patients had taken non-prescription anthelmintics during their chemotherapy, and 96.5% of them did not inform the clinicians. These participants had a positive perception (79.1%) toward the effectiveness of anthelmintics, as they felt it improved their physical condition. Data on the adverse effects of anthelmintics showed that more than two-third of the participants did not report experiencing any adverse effects. Communication between the clinicians and cancer patients regarding the use of non-prescription anthelmintics should be enhanced to prevent adverse effects."

We prospectively studied 133 patients undergoing image-guided procedures. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was applied for psychometry. Significantly higher anxiety scores were observed in female patients ( p = .001), those who believed they had received inadequate information from their referring physician ( p = .006), and in patients who considered online information unreliable or difficult to access ( p = .007 and p = .001, respectively).

https://openalex.org/W4301374171,"Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences have caused fear and anxiety worldwide and imposed a significant physical and psychological burden on people, especially women living with HIV (WLHIV). However, WLHIV were not studied as well as others during the pandemic. Hence, this study aimed to determine the relationships between COVID-19 phobia, health anxiety, and social relations in WLHIV. Materials and methods This cross-sectional study enrolled 300 WLHIV who had records at the Iranian Research Center for HIV/AIDS of Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Data were collected using sociodemographic questionnaire, the fear of COVID-19 scale, the social relations questionnaire, the socioeconomic status scale and the health anxiety inventory. Path-analysis was used to assess the direct and indirct associations between variables. Results Based on the path analysis, among variables that had significant causal relationships with social relations, socioeconomic status (β = -0.14) showed the greatest negative relationship, and health anxiety (β = 0.11) had the strongest positive relationship on the direct path. On the indirect path, fear of COVID-19 (β = 0.049) displayed the greatest positive relationship. The level of education (β = 0.29) was the only variable showing a significant positive relationship with social relations on both direct and indirect paths. Conclusion Our result showed that increased fear and health anxiety related to a higher social relations score in WLHIV. Hence, due to their vulnerability, these people require more support and education to adhere to health protocols in future pandemics and similar situations."

To identify the transcriptional complexes of EWS-ETS fusion transcription factors, we applied a proximal labeling system called BioID in Ewing's sarcoma cells. We identified AHDC1 as a proximal protein of EWS-ETS fusion proteins. AHDC1 knockdown showed a reduced cell growth and transcriptional activity of EWS-FLI1. AHDC1 knockdown also reduced BRD4 and BRG1 protein levels, both known as interacting proteins of EWS-FLI1. Our results suggest that AHDC1 supports cell growth through EWS-FLI1."

It is a comprehensive measure of health outcome after trauma. Childhood maltreatment is a determinant of poor mental health and quality of life. Resilience, however, is supposed to be protective. Our aim is to examine childhood trauma and resilience in patients visiting psychiatry outpatient and investigate their relations with quality of life. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted with a hundred patients with trauma and visiting psychiatry outpatient. Standardized tools were applied to explore childhood trauma, resilience, quality of life and clinical diagnoses and trauma categorization. Sociodemographic and relevant clinical information were obtained with a structured proforma. Bivariate followed by multivariate logistic regressions were conducted to explore the relation between childhood trauma, resilience, and quality of life. Poor quality of life was reported in almost one third of the patients. Upper socioeconomic status, emotional neglect during childhood, current depression and low resilience were the determinants of poor quality of life in bivariate analysis. Final models revealed that emotional neglect during childhood and low resilience had independent associations with poor quality of life. Efforts should be made to minimize childhood maltreatment in general; and explore strategies to build resilience suited to the cultural context to improve quality of life."

A structured online survey was administered to 1,243 participants quota-sampled by age and population from each administrative district. Based on the socio-ecological model, interpersonal factors (general characteristics, prior disaster experience, anxiety, dispositional optimism, perceived disaster risk, and disaster preparedness knowledge), institutional factor (front-line preparedness), community factor (community resilience), public policy factor (governmental preparedness), and household disaster preparedness were measured. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Bonferroni test, Pearson's correlation coefficients, and multiple regression. The predictors of household disaster preparedness were occupation, economic status, prior disaster experience, anxiety, disaster preparedness knowledge, front-line preparedness, and community resilience. The most potent predictor of household disaster preparedness was community resilience. Our finding that community resilience, a community factor, has a greater impact on household disaster preparedness than personal factors calls for programs that promote such resilience. Further, continuous public education and campaigns are needed to increase public awareness of household disaster preparedness and to improve the public's competency to prepare for potential disasters. This study raises the need for community programs for residents to increase household disaster preparedness knowledge and improve their competencies related to disaster response. This study is significant in highlighting the importance of community factors in improving household disaster preparedness amid the need to prepare for various types of disasters."
https://openalex.org/W4301374214,"Effects of intense and/or prolonged exercise have been studied extensively in male athletes. Nevertheless, data are scare on the effect of long duration events on cardiac function in female athletes. Our aim was to investigate the effect of a long-lasting moderate-intensity stage cycling event on cardiac function of young female athletes.Seven well-trained female cyclists were included. They completed a cycling event of 3529 km on 23 days. All underwent an echocardiography on 6 time-points (baseline and at the arrival of day (D) 3, 7, 12, 13 and 23). Cardiac function was assessed by conventional echocardiography, tissue Doppler imaging and speckle tracking techniques. Daily exercise load was determined by heart rate (HR), power output and rate of perceived exertion data (RPE, Borg scale).All stages were mainly done at moderate intensity (average HR: 65% of maximal, average aerobic power output: 36% of maximal, average RPE: 4). Resting HR measured at the time of echocardiography did not vary during the event. Resting cardiac dimensions did not significantly change during the 23 days of cycling. No significant modification of cardiac function, whatever the studied cavity, were observed all along the event.The results suggest that, in the context of our case study, the long-lasting moderate-intensity stage cycling event was not associated with cardiac function alteration. Nevertheless, we must be careful in interpreting them due to the limits of an underpowered study."
