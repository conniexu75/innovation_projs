https://openalex.org/W1981687780,"The induction of senescence-like growth arrest has emerged as a putative contributor to the anticancer effects of chemotherapeutic agents. Clinical trials are underway to evaluate the efficacy of inhibitors for class I and II histone deacetylases to treat malignancies. However, a potential antiproliferative effect of inhibitor for Sirt1, which is an NAD+-dependent deacetylase and belongs to class III histone deacetylases, has not yet been explored. Here, we show that Sirt1 inhibitor, Sirtinol, induced senescence-like growth arrest characterized by induction of senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity and increased expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells and lung cancer H1299 cells. Sirtinol-induced senescence-like growth arrest was accompanied by impaired activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, namely, extracellular-regulated protein kinase, c-jun N-terminal kinase and p38 MAPK, in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). Active Ras was reduced in Sirtinol-treated senescent cells compared with untreated cells. However, tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptors for EGF and IGF-I and Akt/PKB activation were unaltered by Sirtinol treatment. These results suggest that inhibitors for Sirt1 may have anticancer potential, and that impaired activation of Ras–MAPK pathway might take part in a senescence-like growth arrest program induced by Sirtinol."

EGFR has been identified as a rational target for anticancer therapy. Curcumin, the yellow pigment of turmeric in curry, has received attention as a promising dietary supplement for cancer prevention and treatment. We recently reported that curcumin inhibited the growth of human colon cancer-derived Moser cells by suppressing gene expression of cyclinD1 and EGFR. The aim of the present study was to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying curcumin inhibition of gene expression of EGFR in colon cancer cells. The generality of the inhibitory effect of curcumin on gene expression of EGFR was verified in other human colon cancer-derived cell lines, including Caco-2 and HT-29 cells. Promoter deletion assays and site-directed mutageneses identified a binding site for the transcription factor early growth response-1 (Egr-1) in egfr promoter as a putative curcumin response element in regulating the promoter activity of the gene in Moser cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that curcumin significantly reduced the DNA-binding activity of the transcription factor Egr-1 to the curcumin response element. In addition, curcumin reduced the trans-activation activity of Egr-1 by suppressing egr-1 gene expression, which required interruption of the ERK signal pathway and reduction of the level of phosphorylation of Elk-1 and its activity. Taken together, our results demonstrated that curcumin inhibited human colon cancer cell growth by suppressing gene expression of EGFR through reducing the trans-activation activity of Egr-1. These results provided novel insights into the mechanisms of curcumin inhibition of colon cancer cell growth and potential therapeutic strategies for treatment of colon cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2153863351,"The regulation of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel activity is complex and a multitude of factors determine their open probability. Physiologically and pathophysiologically, the most important of these are intracellular nucleotides, with a long-recognized role for glycolytically derived ATP in regulating channel activity. To identify novel regulatory subunits of the KATP channel complex, we performed a two-hybrid protein-protein interaction screen, using as bait the mouse Kir6.2 C terminus. Screening a rat heart cDNA library, we identified two potential interacting proteins to be the glycolytic enzymes, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and triose-phosphate isomerase. The veracity of interaction was verified by co-immunoprecipitation techniques in transfected mammalian cells. We additionally demonstrated that pyruvate kinase also interacts with Kir6.2 subunits. The physiological relevance of these interactions is illustrated by the demonstration that native Kir6.2 protein similarly interact with GAPDH and pyruvate kinase in rat heart membrane fractions and that Kir6.2 protein co-localize with these glycolytic enzymes in rat ventricular myocytes. The functional relevance of our findings is demonstrated by the ability of GAPDH or pyruvate kinase substrates to directly block the KATP channel under patch clamp recording conditions. Taken together, our data provide direct evidence for the concept that key enzymes involved in glycolytic ATP production are part of a multisubunit KATP channel protein complex. Our data are consistent with the concept that the activity of these enzymes (possibly by ATP formation in the immediate intracellular microenvironment of this macromolecular KATP channel complex) causes channel closure.

Our data are consistent with the concept that the activity of these enzymes (possibly by ATP formation in the immediate intracellular microenvironment of this macromolecular KATP channel complex) causes channel closure. KATP channels act as metabolic sensors of a large diversity of cell types by directly coupling their energy metabolism to cellular excitability. This function serves as a crucial regulatory mechanism in the responses of various cell types to their metabolic demand. For example, KATP channels mediate insulin release from pancreatic β cells, control the firing rate of glucose-responsive neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus, and protect neurons during hypoxia. KATP channels also have unique roles in the cardiovascular system. In the coronary vasculature, they participate in the maintenance of the coronary vascular tone, whereas in cardiac myocytes, KATP channel modulation causes alterations in action potential duration and induction of arrhythmias during cardiac ischemia (1.Seino S. Miki T. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2003; 81: 133-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The minimum requirement for the formation of a heterologously expressed KATP channel appears to be the presence of two types of subunits, namely a pore-forming subunit (Kir6.x) belonging to the family of inward rectifying K+ channel subunits and a sulfonylurea receptor regulatory subunit, which is a member of the family of ABC-cassette proteins (2.Inagaki N. Seino S. Jpn. J. Physiol. 1998; 48: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, ion channels are increasingly realized to be multisubunit macromolecular complexes (3.Leonoudakis D.

Recent evidence suggest that the KATP channel protein complex may include other metabolically active protein subunits, including adenylate kinase, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase (6.Carrasco A.J.

The aim of this study was to further refine the molecular nature of the KATP channel macromolecular protein complex to gain better understanding of the composition and regulation of the KATP channel. In these studies, we identified three glycolytic enzymes, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 2The abbreviations used are: GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; TPI, triose-phosphate isomerase; PK, pyruvate kinase; KATP channel, ATP-sensitive potassium channel; COS7L cells, Cercopithecus aethiops (monkey, African green) kidney cells; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate. triose-phosphate isomerase (TPI), and pyruvate kinase (PK), as functionally relevant accessory subunits of the KATP channel protein complex. We provide evidence that the activity of these enzymes regulate channel activity, presumably by altering the ATP levels in the microenvironment of the KATP channel protein complex. Generation of Constructs Used for the Two-hybrid Screening—A DNA fragment encoding the truncated COOH terminus of Kir6.2 (Kir6.2CΔ36; amino acids 169–354 of mouse Kir6.2; NP_034732) was generated by PCR using as template the mouse Kir6.2 cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. Susumu Seino, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan). The PCR primers were 5′-GGTTCGAATTCAATGAAAACGGCCCAGGCCCATCGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAGGGTCAGGGCCTCGAGTCAACTGCGGTCCTCATC-3′ (antisense). The primers contained restriction sites (EcoRI at the 5′ and XhoI at the 3′ end) for in-frame cloning with λC1 into the pBT bait vector (Stratagene) and a stop codon was engineered at the 3′ position. The subcloned DNA fragment was verified by sequencing. Bacterial Two-hybrid Assay—A bacterial two-hybrid assay (Bacteriomatch, Stratagene) was used to identify proteins that interact with Kir6.2CΔ36 (9.Tottey S. Rondet S.A. Borrelly G.P. Robinson P.J. Rich P.R. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5490-5497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Identification of positive clones, recovery of library plasmids, and identification of prey sequences were performed according to the manufacturer's guidelines. In brief, the pBT-Kir6.2CΔ36 bait plasmid was co-transformed with a rat cDNA library cloned in the target vector, pTRG (Stratagene) into a reporter strain Escherichia coli (Stratagene) that harbors the genetic elements needed to initiate and indicate interaction between partner proteins (λ-operator, ampicillin, and β-galactosidase resistance genes). Protein-protein interaction was detected by growth of carbenicillin-resistant colonies. Positives were further verified using the second marker, β-galactosidase. The nucleotide sequence of positives was determined by sequencing, and the identity of the encoded putative interacting protein was determined by data base searches (Blastx). Cell Culture, Molecular Biology, and Transfection—COS7L cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells were transfected at 60–70% confluency using FuGENE 6 (Roche) with the following cDNAs: mouse Kir6.2-HA (10.Pountney D.J. Sun Z.Q. Porter L.M. Nitabach M.N. Nakamura T.Y. Holmes D. Rosner E.

Full-length rat TPI, amino acids 1–249 of NM_022922, was cloned in-frame into pEGFPN1 to generate TPI-GFP. Co-immunoprecipitation—Co-immunoprecipitation assays were used to analyze the putative protein-protein interactions (11.Nakamura T.Y. Pountney D.J. Ozaita A. Nandi S. Ueda S. Rudy B. Coetzee W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12808-12813Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) in both transfected COS7L cells and with native proteins in membrane fractions obtained from rat heart (12.Pond A.L. Scheve B.K.

Forty eight h post-transfection, COS7L cells were washed in PBS and lysed in ice-cold buffer (containing in mm), 25 Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 NaCl, 5 EDTA containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm; Sigma), and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (1:100). Cardiac membrane fractions were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 for 2 h at 4 °C prior to incubation with Kir6.2 antibody (W62 antibody). Protein samples (∼600–1000 μg) were precleared with 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. After removing the beads by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 s, the samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with appropriate antibodies, ∼10 μg of anti-Kir6.2 (W62), NAF-1 (anti-Kir6.1) (13.Yoshida H. Feig J.E. Morrissey A. Ghiu I.A. Artman M. Coetzee W.A. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2004; 37: 857-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), anti-GAPDH (Chemicon), monoclonal anti-GFP (Clone IL-8, Clontech), or anti-PK (Biogenesis). The W62 antibody has been well characterized and used both in Western blotting and immunoprecipitation as described previously (13.Yoshida H. Feig J.E. Morrissey A. Ghiu I.A. Artman M. Coetzee W.A. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2004; 37: 857-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The antibody-protein complexes were captured by incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads for 2–3 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 s and washed three times with ice-cold wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100). Lysates and washed immunoprecipitates were then diluted in SDS-gel loading buffer and separated on 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad), which were immunoblotted with anti-GAPDH (1:500), monoclonal anti-GFP (1:5000), anti-PK (1:500), polyclonal anti-HA (Covance, 1:300), or monoclonal anti-HA (Covance, 1:300) antibodies. The secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences), donkey anti-goat IgG (Sigma), and donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences). Detection was performed using chemiluminescence (Pierce). Untransfected COS7L cells and co-immunoprecipitation assays performed with IgG antibodies were used as negative controls. Enzymatic Isolation of Ventricular Myocytes—The care and use of animals were according to institutional guidelines. Ventricular myocytes were isolated from adult Sprague-Dawley rats following a previously published protocol (14.Nakamura T.Y. Coetzee W.A. Vega-Saenz D.M. Artman M. Rudy B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1775-H1786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using collagenase (type I, Sigma) and protease (Sigma, type XXIV). The procedure resulted in an 80–90% yield of rod-shaped myocytes. Myocytes exhibiting a brick-like shape and clear cross-striations were used for electrophysiology and immunocytochemistry experiments. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Isolated cardiomyocytes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma; 15 min at room temperature), followed by permeabilization with methanol incubation (100% methanol for 5 min at -20 °C). The cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After two washes with PBS the cells were blocked in 5% donkey PBS/serum and incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After the coverslips were washed three times in PBS/serum, they were incubated with secondary antibodies for 45 min. Following wash steps (4 × 10 min in PBS) coverslips were mounted and analyzed by laser confocal microscopy (Leica Microsystems). The primary antibodies used were mouse anti-GAPDH (1:300), goat anti-PK (1:500), and rabbit anti-Kir6.2 (76A; 1:100; a kind gift from Dr. A. Tinker, The Rayne Institute, University College, London) (15.Cui Y. Giblin J.P. Clapp L.H. Tinker A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The secondary antibodies used were Cy2-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG, Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG, or Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Control groups included incubation with the peptide against which the antibody was raised (when possible) and staining with secondary antibody alone (data not shown). Electrophysiology—KATP channel currents were recorded from either excised inside-out patches or cell-attached patches (16.Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15174) Google Scholar, 17.Kakei M. Noma A. Shibasaki T. J. Physiol. 1985; 363: 441-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 18.Weiss J.N. Lamp S.T. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 94: 911-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In the latter configuration, cells were permeabilized locally at one end using 0.1% saponin to obtain the open-cell configuration (19.Horie M. Irisawa H. Noma A. J. Physiol. 1987; 387: 251-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Pipettes (2–4 MΩ) were filled with (in mm) gluconic acid, 110; KCl, 30; CaCl2, 2; MgCl2, 1; HEPES, 10; ouabain, 0.02; pH 7.4, with KOH. The bath solution contained (in mm): gluconic acid, 110; KCl, 30; EGTA, 1; MgCl2, 1.2; HEPES, 10; pH 7.2, with KOH. Mixtures of glycolytic substrates were prepared in bath solution that additionally contained (in mm): Mg-ATP, 0.09 or 0.1; K-ADP, 0.5; KH2PO4, 0.5. Mixture 1 additionally contained (in mm): glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (5 mm) and NADP (1 mm), whereas mixture 2 also contained phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP, 5 mm). The Mg2+ activity was calculated by allowing for the stability constants of the various ligands and it was kept constant at 1 mm by addition of MgCl2 as needed. Experiments were also carried with each component of the mixtures individually to test the effect of each substrate on KATP channel activity. Data were analyzed using the pClamp suite of software (Axon Instruments) and Microcal Origin (Northampton, MA). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis (SigmaStat, SyStat Inc., Point Richmond, CA) was performed using the one-way analysis of variance for repeated measures followed by Dunnet's t test. Groups were compared with 100 μm ATP and values of p < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Identification of Glycolytic Enzymes as Kir6.2 Interacting Proteins—In a search for novel regulatory subunits of the KATP channel macromolecular protein complex, we conducted a two-hybrid protein-protein interaction screen against a rat cardiac cDNA library, using the Kir6.2 subunit as bait. We used only the cytosolic Kir6.2 C-terminal portion (169–354 amino acids) because many protein-protein interactions occur at intracellular regions. Furthermore, we omitted the last 36 amino acids of the C-terminal to exclude known endoplasmic reticulum retention sequences (20.Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar), because the inclusion of these residues would have increased the likelihood of identifying endoplasmic reticulum-resident proteins. Screening of 5 million clones revealed two putative interacting proteins to be the glycolytic enzymes GAPDH and TPI, which catalyze two consecutive steps of the glycolytic pathway. Association of GAPDH, TPI with Kir6.2 in Cultured Cells—Co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed to verify that the interactions between Kir6.2 and these glycolytic enzymes occur in mammalian cells. COS7L cells were transfected with full-length Kir6.2-HA, SUR2A, and GFP cDNAs. GAPDH is endogenously expressed in COS7L cells, and is detected at an apparent molecular size of ∼37 kDa (Fig. 1A). Cells were solubilized, and immunoprecipitation was performed with the anti-Kir6.2 (W62) antibody. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting was performed using anti-GAPDH antibodies. The band observed at ∼37 kDa (Fig. 1A) demonstrates that GAPDH co-immunoprecipitated with Kir6.2 subunits. The reciprocal interaction was also demonstrated. When immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-GAPDH antibodies, we could detect Kir6.2-HA subunits using polyclonal anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 1B). We constructed a TPI-GFP fusion protein and used anti-GFP antibodies to detect its interaction with Kir6.2 (Fig. 1, C and D). We followed this approach because of lack of suitable anti-TPI antibodies. COS7L cells were transfected as indicated and the TPI-GFP protein was detected as a band migrating with an apparent molecular size of ∼57 kDa using a monoclonal GFP antibody. This was observed both in the lysate lane as well as in the immunoprecipitate obtained with an anti-Kir6.2 antibody (Fig. 1C). Reciprocally, immunoprecipitation of TPI-GFP with an anti-GFP antibody enabled the detection of Kir6.2-HA by immunoblotting with a polyclonal anti-HA antibody (Fig. 1D). Co-immunoprecipitation assays when performed in untransfected COS7L cells as a negative control failed to immunoprecipitate GAPDH, or TPI. Co-immunoprecipitation assays carried out with IgG antibodies also did not immunoprecipitate either GAPDH or TPI-GFP. Thus, these data demonstrate that GAPDH and TPI both interact with the Kir6.2 subunit. Pyruvate Kinase Associates with Kir6.2—Whereas GAPDH and TPI catalyze glycolytic reactions immediately preceding the first ATP-generating step, PK catalyzes the second ATP-generating step of glycolysis. We postulated that PK may also associate with KATP channel subunits because phosphoenolpyruvate, the substrate of PK, inhibits KATP channel activity (18.Weiss J.N. Lamp S.T. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 94: 911-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed in cells transfected with Kir6.2-HA and SUR2A (we relied on endogenous expression of PK in COS7L cells, which is observed as a ∼57-kDa protein in cell lysates; Fig. 1E). Interaction of PK and Kir6.2 is demonstrated by the finding that PK was detected in the Kir6.2-HA immunoprecipitates. Reciprocally, Kir6.2-HA was detected in the PK immunoprecipitate (Fig. 1F). No interaction was detected in untransfected COS7L cells and in co-immunoprecipitation assays with IgG antibodies. Native Kir6.2 Subunits Interact with GAPDH and PK—We next set out to determine whether interaction of Kir6.2 and these glycolytic enzymes also occurs natively in membrane proteins extracted from rat heart (Fig. 2). Indeed, we were able to detect both GAPDH and PK in an immunoprecipitate obtained using an anti-Kir6.2 antibody (their respective sizes were 37 and 57 kDa). We were not able to demonstrate the reciprocal interaction, presumably because of the relative abundance of GAPDH or PK proteins in cells and the possibility that not all of these glycolytic enzymes interact with KATP channels. Nevertheless, these data support the concept that key glycolytic enzymes (including GAPDH, PK, and presumably TPI) form part of the native multisubunit KATP channel macromolecular protein complex. Interaction does not appear to be limited to the KATP channels containing Kir6.2 subunits, because we also observed robust interaction between native Kir6.1 subunits and both GAPDH and PK. Kir6.2 Subunits Colocalize with GAPDH and PK in Rat Ventricular Myocytes—We performed dual labeling immunocytochemistry experiments to determine whether Kir6.2 and glycolytic enzymes (GAPDH or PK) colocalize in rat ventricular myocytes, as would be predicted if the interactions reported here are of physiological significance. There was extensive overlap in subcellular localization of these proteins (Fig. 3, A and B), demonstrating that glycolytic enzymes largely have a similar subcellular distribution as the Kir6.2 channel subunit. No staining was observed in negative control experiments (peptide incubation or with secondary antibody alone), indicating that the staining was antibody specific (Data not shown). As a further control, we observed identical staining with two separate secondary antibodies. Functional Consequences of the Interaction between Glycolytic Enzymes and Kir6.2 Subunits—We used the patch clamp technique to investigate the physiological relevance of the interaction between Kir6.2 subunits with glycolytic enzymes. Initially, KATP channel activity was recorded using the open-cell configuration, which allowed the interior of the rat ventricular myocyte to be dialyzed with different solutions, while keeping the intracellular microenvironment of the channel relatively intact (17.Kakei M. Noma A. Shibasaki T. J. Physiol. 1985; 363: 441-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 18.Weiss J.N. Lamp S.T. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 94: 911-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Permeabilizing one end of the cell with saponin led to activation of the channels, which was measured in cell-attached patches after a short delay. These channels were identified as KATP channels as they were reversibly blocked when perfusing the cell interior with 2 mm ATP (Fig. 4A). Switching to a solution containing (in mm) 0.1 ATP, 0.5 ADP, and 0.5 KH2PO4 led to partial channel block. Further addition of GAPDH substrates (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and the cofactor, NADP) led to prompt and significant inhibition of KATP channels. Similarly, addition of the PK substrate (PEP) also caused a prompt and reversible inhibition of KATP channel activity, consistent with previous reports of KATP channel regulation by PK substrates (18.Weiss J.N. Lamp S.T. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 94: 911-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 21.Xu K.Y. Zweier J.L. Becker L.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 88-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 22.Dubinsky W.P. Mayorga-Wark O. Schultz S.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1653-C1659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The degree of channel inhibition by the various interventions, normalized to current in the presence of 100 μm ATP, is shown in Fig. 4B. Experiments were also performed with excised patches using the inside-out patch clamp configuration (16.Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15174) Google Scholar). KATP channels opened spontaneously following patch excision and their activity was reversibly inhibited by 2 mm ATP (Fig. 5). Application of a “cytosolic” solution containing (in mm) 0.09 ATP, 0.5 ADP, and 0.5 KH2PO4 caused partial inhibition of channel activity. Under these conditions, substrates of GAPDH effectively and reversibly decreased channel activity (in 5 of 8 patches studied). The mean reduction in mean patch current was 99.2 ± 0.8% as compared with the 58.4 ± 14.4% reduction observed in the presence of 90 μm ATP alone. PK substrates also inhibited the channel (in 3 of 4 patches; Fig. 5B). In the presence of PK substrates, KATP channel activity was inhibited by 91.4 ± 8.6% compared with 49.6 ± 12.1% inhibition with 90 μm ATP alone. Application of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate or PEP in the absence of ADP and KH2PO4 had no effect on KATP channel activity. KATP channels were not blocked by individual application of 5 mm glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, 5 mm PEP, 1 mm NADP, 0.5 mm MgCl2, or the combination of these components in the absence of ADP and inorganic phosphate (data not shown). Furthermore, iodoacetic acid (1 mm), which is often used to inhibit glycolysis (21.Xu K.Y. Zweier J.L. Becker L.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 88-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), prevented the KATP channel inhibition by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (data not shown). Collectively, these patch clamp data demonstrate that the activity of the glycolytic enzymes GAPDH and PK effectively inhibit KATP channels. Our data demonstrate key glycolytic enzymes to be functionally relevant subunits of the KATP channel multisubunit protein complex. Evidence supporting this concept include (i) data from the two-hybrid screen that identified GAPDH and TPI as proteins interacting with the truncated Kir6.2 C terminus; (ii) co-immunoprecipitation of GAPDH, TPI, or PK with Kir6.2 subunits both in heterologous systems and in native tissue; (iii) immunolocalization of Kir6.2 protein with GAPDH and PK in rat ventricular myocytes; and (iv) inhibition of KATP channel activity by substrates of GAPDH or PK in the open-cell configuration and in excised membrane patches. The KATP Channel as a Macromolecular Protein Complex—Ion channels are increasingly thought to be composed of multisubunit macromolecular complexes that, in addition to their pore-forming subunits, also include structural and functional accessory subunits (23.Coetzee W.A. Amarillo Y. Chiu J. Chow A. Lau D. McCormack T. Moreno H. Nadal M.S. Ozaita A. Pountney D. Saganich M. Vega-Saenz D.M. Rudy B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 233-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). Some KATP channel complexes, for example, have been shown to include metabolically active enzymes that regulate their function, including, adenylate kinase, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase (6.Carrasco A.J. Dzeja P.P. Alekseev A.E. Pucar D. Zingman L.V. Abraham M.R. Hodgson D. Bienengraeber M. Puceat M. Janssen E. Wieringa B. Terzic A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3936-3948Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Interestingly, KATP channels involved in secretory events directly associate with other subunits that regulate various steps in exocytosis. For example, KATP channels involved in insulin release from the pancreatic β-cell associate with Rim, Piccolo, Epacs, and Ca2+ channel subunits (24.Shibasaki T. Sunaga Y. Fujimoto K. Kashima Y. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7956-7961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), which confers a trimodal regulation of insulin release by cytosolic ATP, Ca2+, and cAMP. There are also reports of their interaction with the vesicle docking protein, syntaxin-1 (25.Pasyk, E. A., Kang, Y., Huang, X., Cui, N., Sheu, L., and Gaisano, H. Y. (2003) J. Biol. Chem.Google Scholar), which may coordinate the sequence of ionic and exocytosis events leading to secretion. Our new data demonstrate that key glycolytic enzymes (GAPDH, TPI, and PK) can associate with Kir6.2 subunits. Given the well described interaction between GAPDH and phosphoglycerate kinase (26.Ashmarina L.I. Muronetz V.I. Nagradova N.K. Biochem. Int. 1984; 9: 511-521PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Sukhodolets M.V.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 297: 247-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that the enzymes involved in each of the two glycolytic ATP generating steps are components of the KATP channel protein complex and that their activity regulates KATP channel opening. Glycolytically Derived ATP Regulates Membrane Ion Transporters— Although the predominant source of ATP derived from glucose is via oxidative phosphorylation, glycolytically derived ATP may be functionally compartmentalized to preferentially fuel membrane-related processes. This membrane-delimited role of glycolytic enzymes is consistent with their known subcellular localization. There are several reports describing glycolytic enzymes, including GAPDH, PK, and phosphoglycerate kinase to be membrane bound in cell types ranging from glioma cells, intact Ehrlich tumor cells, and red blood cells (30.Daum G. Keller K. Lange K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 939: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 31.Wernstedt C.O. Agren G.K. Ronquist G.

This is also true for cardiac myocytes, where GAPDH and phosphoglycerate kinase bind to sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic reticular membranes (33.Xu K.Y. Becker L.C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 34.Pierce G.N. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6862-6870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data are fully consistent with our finding of a membrane-bound localization of GAPDH and PK in rat cardiac ventricular myocytes where they co-localize and physically associate with a KATP channel subunit, Kir6.2 as, respectively, shown by our immunocytochemistry and co-immunoprecipitation data. There are many examples of membrane-bound ion transporters that are preferentially regulated by glycolytically derived ATP. These include the Na+/K+ pump (35.Glitsch H.G. Tappe A. Pflugers Arch. 1993; 422: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 36.Mercer R.W. Dunham P.B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1981; 78: 547-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 37.Dizon J.

Casteels R. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2298-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and the H+-ATPase (39.Lu M. Sautin Y.Y. Holliday L.S. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8732-8739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). There is also evidence of a preferential role for glycolysis in some Ca2+ homeostatic pathways by regulating Ca2+ channel activity (40.Lorenz J.N. Paul R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H987-H994PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Losito V.A. Tsushima R.G. Diaz R.J. Wilson G.J. Backx P.H. J. Physiol. 1998; 511: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ transport (21.Xu K.Y. Zweier J.L. Becker L.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 88-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). KATP channels have also been described to be preferentially regulated by glycolytically derived ATP (18.Weiss J.N. Lamp S.T. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 94: 911-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 22.Dubinsky W.P. Mayorga-Wark O. Schultz S.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1653-C1659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We do not have direct evidence that glycolytically derived ATP directly block KATP channel activity. However, none of the glycolytic intermediates by themselves or application of the co-factors led to KATP channel block. Furthermore, when combined in the absence of ADP and inorganic phosphate, they also did not cause KATP channel block. Thus, the presence of ADP and Pi are required for channel block. Because ADP and inorganic phosphate, at the concentrations used, do not directly block KATP channels (17.Kakei M. Noma A. Shibasaki T. J. Physiol. 1985; 363: 441-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 42.Lederer W.J. Nichols C.G. J. Physiol. 1989; 419: 193-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), the reasonable conclusions are that glycolytic enzyme activity is necessary for channel block. This activity could somehow transmit a conformational signal to KATP channels causing them to close or it could be that the KATP channel is directly blocked by glycolytically produced ATP. We are leaning toward the latter explanation given the nature of this channel to be powerfully blocked by ATP and prior suggestions in the literature for glycolytic ATP to preferentially regulate KATP channel activity (18.Weiss J.N. Lamp S.T. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 94: 911-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). If so, our data would provide a molecular basis for this mode of regulation by demonstrating that some of the enzymes involved in the ATP-generating steps of glycolysis physically interact with KATP channel complex. Physiological and Pathophysiological Relevance of Regulation of KATP Channels by Glycolytically Derived ATP—We found glycolytic enzyme activity to inhibit KATP channels. This may provide a partial explanation for the oscillatory behavior of insulin secretion from glucose-stimulated pancreatic β-cells (43.Deeney J.T. Kohler M. Kubik K. Brown G. Schultz V. Tornheim K. Corkey B.E. Berggren P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36946-36950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In other tissues such as the heart, the physiological relevance of this finding is not entirely clear. There is evidence to suggest that functional compartmentalization of ATP may be involved in receptor signaling, for example, the angiotensin II-mediated closure of cardiac KATP channels (44.Tsuchiya K. Horie M. Watanuki M. Albrecht C.A. Obayashi K. Fujiwara H. Sasayama S. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3129-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). There is also a curious functional interaction between KATP channels and the Na+/K+ pump, whereby the activity of one determines the activity of the other, most likely by competition for the same glycolytically derived ATP (45.Hurst A.M. Beck J.S. Laprade R. Lapointe J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F760-F764PubMed Google Scholar, 46.Kabakov A.Y. Biophys.

KATP channels in vascular smooth muscle and glial cells have Kir6.1 as the pore forming subunit (1.Seino S. Miki T. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2003; 81: 133-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), which also interacts with GAPDH and PK. Thus, the possibility is raised that these KATP/NDP channels may also be under the control of glycolytic derived ATP. Under energy-delimited pathophysiological conditions, such as hypoxia and ischemia, KATP channels open and the action potential duration shortens (50.Vleugels A. Vereecke J. Carmeliet E. Circ. Res. 1980; 47: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 51.Kantor P.F. Coetzee W.A. Carmeliet E.E. Dennis S.C. Opie L.H. Circ. Res. 1990; 66: 478-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The protective effects of extracellular glucose and the sensitivity to glycolytic flux of these processes (52.Shigematsu S. Arita M. Cardiovasc. Res. 1997; 35: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 53.Nakamura S. Kiyosue T. Arita M. Cardiovasc. Res. 1989; 23: 286-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) can be reconciled with our finding that enhanced glycolytic flux may block KATP channels and blunt action potential shortening. Regulation of KATP channel activity by glycolytically derived ATP may very well also be important during other pathophysiological states, such as hypertrophy, which decreases the responsiveness of the cardiac KATP channel to glycolytic ATP (54.Yuan F. Brandt N.R. Pinto J.M. Wasserlauf B.J. Myerburg R.J. Bassett A.L. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2837-2848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).

Selenoproteins and low molecular weight Se compounds were implicated in the chemopreventive effect, but specific mechanisms are not clear. We examined the role of Se and selenoproteins in liver tumor formation in TGFα/c-Myc transgenic mice, which are characterized by disrupted redox homeostasis and develop liver cancer by 6 months of age. In these mice, both Se deficiency and high levels of Se compounds suppressed hepatocarcinogenesis. In addition, both treatments induced expression of detoxification genes, increased apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation. Within low-to-optimal levels of dietary Se, tumor formation correlated with expression of most selenoproteins. These data suggest that changes in selenoprotein expression may either suppress or promote tumorigenesis depending on cell type and genotype. Since dietary Se may have opposing effects on cancer, it is important to identify the subjects who will benefit from Se supplementation as well as those who will not."

https://openalex.org/W2044905105,"The impact of the 3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin on human small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell growth and survival was investigated. Simvastatin profoundly impaired basal and growth factor-stimulated SCLC cell growth in vitro and induced apoptosis. SCLC cells treated with simvastatin were sensitized to the effects of the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide. Moreover, SCLC tumour growth in vivo was inhibited by simvastatin. These responses correlated with the inhibition of stem cell factor (SCF)-stimulated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk), protein kinase B (PKB) and ribosomal S6 kinase by simvastatin. Constitutive activation of the Erk pathway was sufficient to rescue SCLC cell from the effects of simvastatin. The drug did not directly affect activation of c-Kit or its localization to lipid rafts, but in addition to its ability to block Ras membrane localization, it selectively downregulated H-Ras protein levels at the post-translational level. Downregulation of either H- or K-Ras by RNA interference (RNAi) did not impair Erk activation by growth factors, whereas an RNAi specific for N-Ras inhibited activation of Erk, PKB and SCLC cell growth. Together our data demonstrate that inhibiting Ras signalling with simvastatin potently disrupts growth and survival in human SCLC cells."
https://openalex.org/W1989375763,"Basal telomerase activity is dependent on expression of the hTERT and hTR genes and upregulation of telomerase gene expression is associated with tumour development. It is therefore possible that signal transduction pathways involved in tumour development and features of the tumour environment itself may influence telomerase gene regulation. The majority of solid tumours contain regions of hypoxia and it has recently been demonstrated that hypoxia can increase telomerase activity by mechanisms that are still poorly defined. Here, we show that hypoxia induces the transcriptional activity of both hTR and hTERT gene promoters. While endogenous hTR expression is regulated at the transcriptional level, hTERT is subject to regulation by alternative splicing under hypoxic conditions, which involves a switch in the splice pattern in favour of the active variant. Furthermore, analysis of the chromatin landscape of the telomerase promoters reveals dynamic recruitment of a transcriptional complex involving the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 transcription factor, p300, RNA polymerase II and TFIIB, to both promoters during hypoxia, which traffics along and remains associated with the hTERT gene as transcription proceeds. These studies show that hTERT and hTR are subject to similar controls under hypoxia and highlight the rapid and dynamic regulation of the telomerase genes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1985035975,"Two most common properties of malignant cells are the presence of aberrant actin cytoskeleton and resistance to anoikis. Suppression of several key cytoskeletal proteins, including tropomyosin-1 (TM1), during neoplastic transformation is hypothesized to contribute to the altered cytoskeleton and neoplastic phenotype. Using TM1 as a paradigm, we have shown that cytoskeletal proteins induce anoikis in breast cancer (MCF-7 and MDA MB 231) cells. Here, we have tested the hypothesis that TM1-mediated cytoskeletal changes regulate integrin activity and the sensitivity to anoikis. TM1 expression in MDA MB 231 cells promotes the assembly of stress fibers, induces rapid anoikis via caspase-dependent pathways involving the release of cytochrome c. Further, TM1 inhibits binding of MDA MB 231 cells to collagen I, but promotes adhesion to laminin. Inhibition of Rho kinase disrupts TM1-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization and adhesion to the extracellular matrix components, whereas the parental cells attach to collagen I, spread and form extensive actin meshwork in the presence of Rho kinase inhibitor, underscoring the differences in parental and TM1-transduced breast cancer cells. Further, treatment with the cytoskeletal disrupting drugs rescues the cells from TM1-induced anoikis. These new findings demonstrate that the aberrant cytoskeleton contributes to neoplastic transformation by conferring resistance to anoikis. Restoration of stress fiber network through enhanced expression of key cytoskeletal proteins may modulate the activity of focal adhesions and sensitize the neoplastic cells to anoikis."

In this study, we found that quindoline derivatives interacted preferentially with intramolecular G-quadruplex structures and were novel potent telomerase inhibitors. Treatment with quindoline derivatives reproducibly inhibited telomerase activity in human leukemia K562 cells and colon cancer SW620 cells. N′-(10H-Indolo [3,2-b] quinolin-11-yl)-N, N-dimethyl-propane-1,3-diamine (SYUIQ-5), (one of quindoline derivatives), when added to K562 and SW620 cell culture at nonacute cytotoxic concentrations, increased time of population doublings of K562 and SW620 cells, induced a marked cessation in cell growth and cellular senescence phenotype after 35 and 18 days, respectively. Growth cessation was accompanied by a shortening of telomere length, and induction of p16, p21 and p27 protein expression. However, another compound SYUIQ-7 with greater IC50 for telomerase had no obvious cellular effect in nonacute cytotoxic concentrations. These results indicate that quindoline derivatives as novel potent G-quadruplex interactive agents induce senescence and telomere shortening in cancer cells and therefore are promising agents for cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2095397788,"Cadherin first forms homo-cis-dimers on the cell surface of the same cells, followed by formation of homo-trans-dimers (trans-interactions) in a Ca2+-dependent manner, eventually causing adherens junctions. In addition, trans-interacting cadherin induces activation of Rac small G protein, which stabilizes non-trans-interacting cadherin on the plasma membrane by inhibiting its endocytosis through the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. However, it has not fully been understood how cadherin induces the activation of Rac. We examined here the molecular mechanism of the activation of Rac by trans-interacting cadherin in fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Trans-interacting cadherin induced activation of c-Src locally at the cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion sites. c-Src then tyrosine-phosphorylated Vav2, one of the Rac-GDP/GTP exchange factors (GEFs), and induced activation of C3G, one of the Rap1-GEFs, through Crk adaptor protein, resulting in the activation of Rap1 locally at the cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion sites. The c-Src-catalysed tyrosine phosphorylation was not sufficient for the activation of Vav2 and the c-Src-induced activation of Rap1 was additionally necessary for it, although activated Rap1 alone was not sufficient for the activation of non-tyrosine-phosphorylated Vav2. This effect of Rap1 on Vav2 was mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. We describe here the signaling pathway from trans-interacting cadherin to the activation of Rac."

While BRCA1 plays an active role in DNA repair, this function alone may not be sufficient to explain why BRCA1-associated tumors predominantly occur in estrogen-responsive tissues. Aromatase is the rate-limiting enzyme in estrogen biosynthesis and a key target in breast cancer treatment. Aromatase expression in ovarian granulosa cells dictates levels of circulating estrogen in premenopausal women, and its aberrant overexpression in breast adipose tissues promotes breast cancer growth. Here, we show that BRCA1 modulates aromatase expression in ovarian granulosa cells and primary preadipocytes. The cyclic AMP-dependent expression of aromatase in ovarian granulosa cells is inversely correlated with the protein level of BRCA1. Importantly, transient knockdown of BRCA1 enhances aromatase expression in both ovarian granulosa cells and primary preadipocytes. We propose that BRCA1 deficiency in epithelial and certain nonepithelial cells may result in combined effects of aberrant estrogen biosynthesis and compromised DNA repair capability, which in turn may lead to specific cancers in the breast and ovary."
https://openalex.org/W2169315867,"Neurofibromin is a neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene product with a domain that acts as a GTPase-activating protein and functions, in part, as a negative regulator of Ras. Loss of neurofibromin expression in NF1 patients is associated with elevated Ras activity and increased cell proliferation, predisposing to a variety of tumors of the peripheral and central nervous systems. We show here, using the small interfering RNA (siRNA) technique, that neurofibromin dynamically regulates actin cytoskeletal reorganization, followed by enhanced cell motility and gross cell aggregation in Matrigel matrix. NF1 siRNA induces characteristic morphological changes, such as excessive actin stress fiber formation, with elevated negative phosphorylation levels of cofilin, which regulates actin cytoskeletal reorganization by depolymerizing and severing actin filaments. We found that the elevated phosphorylation of cofilin in neurofibromin-depleted cells is promoted by activation of a Rho-ROCK-LIMK2 pathway, which requires Ras activation but is not transduced through three major Ras-mediated downstream pathways via Raf, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and RalGEF. In addition, the exogenous expression of the NF1-GTPase-activating protein-related domain suppressed the NF1 siRNA-induced phenotypes.

The phenotype of NF1 is highly variable, with several organ systems being affected, including bones, skin, irises, and central and peripheral nervous systems. The disease commonly manifests with “café au lait” macules in the skin, iris Lisch nodules, and learning disability (2Cichowski K. Jacks T. Cell. 2001; 104: 593-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 3Bernards A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1242: 43-59PubMed Google Scholar). The hallmark of NF1 is benign tumors that develop in the peripheral nervous system accompanied by an increased risk of malignancies.The NF1 gene lies on chromosome 17q11.2 and encodes a large 2818- amino acid protein, termed neurofibromin. Sequence analysis of neurofibromin revealed that a region centered around the 360 amino acids encoded by the NF1 gene shows significant homology to the known catalytic domains of mammalian Ras GTPase-activating protein (p120GAP), which interacts with Ras and promotes hydrolysis of Rasbound GTP (active form) to GDP (inactive form), resulting in inactivation of the Ras protein. Accordingly, loss and/or mutations of neurofibromin elevate Ras activity and are followed by activation of various Ras effectors. Ras activation has been considered to be the causative event for tumor formation and other clinical manifestations in NF1 patients (2Cichowski K. Jacks T. Cell. 2001; 104: 593-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 3Bernards A. Biochim. Biophys.

For instance, mast cells in Nf+/- mice exhibited increased motility through hyperactivation of the Ras-PI3K-Rac2 pathway in response to KitL, which is secreted by homozygous Nf1 mutant (Nf1-/-) Schwann cells, leading to formation of cell aggregations, which become neurofibromas (4Yang F.C.

In PC12 cells, time-dependent increases in the GAP activity of cellular neurofibromin (NF1-GAP) were detected after nerve growth factor stimulation and were correlated with the down-regulation of Ras activity during neurite extension (6Yunoue S.

Although cell migration and neurite extension are known to be regulated by cytoskeletal reorganization in cells, the molecular mechanisms by which neurofibromin is involved in these cytoskeletal dynamics are understood poorly.Coordinated regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics is required for several fundamental cellular events such as cell movement, cell adhesion, and cytokinesis. Actin reorganization is often initiated by extracellular stimuli and is regulated by diverse actin-binding proteins. Among these, the actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin family proteins play an essential role in promoting actin depolymerization at pointed ends and severing long actin filaments, which leads to rapid turnover of actin filaments (7Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3234) Google Scholar). In mammals, the activity of ADF/cofilin is repressed by phosphorylation at Ser3, leading to actin cytoskeletal reorganization. Four kinases responsible for this phosphorylation have been identified: LIM-kinase 1 and 2 (LIMK1/2) and TES-kinase 1 and 2. LIMK1/2 are serine/threonine/tyrosine kinases characterized structurally by two NH2-terminal LIM domains and a PDZ domain. Recent studies have revealed that activities of LIMK are regulated by the downstream effectors of Rho family GTPases. LIMK1 is phosphorylated specifically and activated by p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) that is downstream of the Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPases. On the other hand, LIMK2 is specifically phosphorylated and activated by Rho-associated, coiled-coil-forming protein kinase (ROCK) downstream of RhoA. In addition, both LIMK are also activated by myotonic dystrophy kinase-related Cdc42-binding kinase α, which is downstream of Cdc42. Taken together, the Rho family-associated signal transduction pathways, such as Cdc42/Rac-PAK1-LIMK1, Rho-ROCK-LIMK2, and Cdc42-myotonic dystrophy kinaserelated Cdc42-binding kinase α-LIMK, play distinct roles in the regulation of cofilin-mediated actin dynamics (8Sumi T.

Our results demonstrated that the acute knockdown of neurofibromin stimulates phosphorylation of cofilin by LIMK2 and induces characteristic morphological changes with abnormal actin stress fiber reorganization and formation of gross cell aggregates in matrix. We propose that neurofibromin plays a significant role in cell motility by regulating the dynamics and reorganization of actin filaments via the Rho-ROCK-LIMK2-cofilin pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfections—HeLa and HT1080 cells were cultured under 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 Ham (Sigma) with 10% fetal bovine serum.

Annealing of the component strands of each siRNA and transfection were performed as described (16Elbashir S.M. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T.

First strand cDNA, which served as the PCR template, was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA purified using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen). The reverse transcription (RT) reaction was performed using an oligo(dT) primer and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR was performed with 1 μl of the RT reaction, 1.25 units of rTaq DNA polymerase (Takara), 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.8 mm dNTP mixture in a final volume of 50 μl. PCR conditions were 94 °C, involving a 2-min initial denaturation step followed by 25 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel with ethidium bromide.Small G-protein Pull-down Assays—Ras activity was measured by detecting Ras protein bound to the Ras-binding domain of Raf-1 immobilized to agarose with a Ras activation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) used according to the manufacturer's instructions and as described previously (18de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The activity of Ral was also measured by a method similar to the Ras activity assay. In place of the Raf-1 Ras-binding domain, the Ral binding domain of Ral-BP1 (Ral-BP1 Ral-binding domain) was used to measure Ral activity (Upstate Biotechnology).Immunofluorescence—HeLa or HT1080 cells grown on a 35-mm culture dish were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. After being washed with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, followed by a secondary antibody conjugated with a fluorescent dye for 60 min at room temperature, respectively. Analysis was performed by confocal microscopy (Fluoview, FV300; Olympus).Matrigel Assays—HeLa or HT1080 cells were transfected with siRNA and/or plasmids. At 24 h after transfection, ∼5000 cells were placed on a layer of Matrigel (3.5 mg/ml in culture medium; BD Biosciences) in a 35-mm culture dish. The thickness of the Matrigel layer was usually ∼1000 μm. Cells on the Matrigel were observed by phase-contrast microscopy.For time lapse video analysis, cells were placed on Matrigel in ΔT 0.15-mm dishes (Biopteches). Before observation, the culture medium was replaced with dye-free L-15 medium, pH 7.2 (Sigma), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and overlaid with mineral oil. Dishes were maintained at 37 °C using the ΔT Culture Dish System (Biopteches) and imaged on an Olympus IX 70 microscope equipped with a sensitive SenSys-1401E CCD camera (Roper Scientific). Images were obtained using a ×20 UPlan Apo objective (Olympus). The camera, shutters, and filter wheel were controlled by MetaMorph imaging software (Universal Imaging), and the images were collected every 5 min with exposure times of 100 ms.RESULTSSuppression of NF1 Expression Leads to Changes in Cell Shape and Cytoskeletal Organization—To examine the roles of neurofibromin in cell growth and morphology, we attempted to reduce the expression of neurofibromin in HeLa cells by an RNA interference strategy. The levels of both NF1 mRNA and protein were suppressed beginning at 9 h after siRNA transfection and were reduced up to 95% at 72 h. Three siRNA oligonucleotides against NF1 showed similar effects in reducing expression of neurofibromin (Fig. 1, A and B). In addition, immunocytochemical analysis also confirmed the reduction of neurofibromin expression in cytoplasm by NF1 siRNA transfection, whereas siRNA controls showed no effects (Fig. 1C).Immunocytochemical analysis showed that NF1 siRNA induced dynamic morphological changes according to the level of neurofibromin suppression with time. Neurofibromin-depleted HeLa cells tended to display the flattened shapes having excessive actin stress fiber formation from 12 h after transfection, and these changes were enhanced from 24 to 48 h (Fig. 2, J-O). Control siRNA induced no discernible alterations in cell morphology and cytoskeletal structure during the observation period (Fig. 2, D-I). Similar morphological changes and actin stress fiber formation were observed when other siRNA oligonucleotides against NF1 were used (supplemental Fig. S1).FIGURE 2Morphological changes and excessive actin stress fiber formation in neurofibromin-depleted cells. HeLa and HT1080 cells were transfected with control or NF1 (827) siRNA and stained with Alexa 488 phalloidin and anti-paxillin antibody at 24 h (D-F, d-f, J-L, j-l) or 48 h (G-I, g-i, M-O, m-o) after treatment. Cells without siRNA treatment are also shown in A-C and a-c, respectively. The white arrows indicate excessive actin stress fiber formation in neurofibromin-depleted cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The formation of actin stress fibers is usually accompanied by assembly of focal adhesions at cell margins. Immunostaining of paxillin, a major component of focal adhesions, revealed that NF1 siRNA promotes formation of focal adhesions at 24 and 48 h after transfection, when excess actin stress fibers were formed (Fig. 2, K and N). In contrast, control siRNA had no effect on formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions (Fig. 2, E and H).We examined the effects of neurofibromin depletion on another NF1-relevant tumor cell, HT1080 human fibrosarcoma. HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells exhibit similar characteristics to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) frequently found in NF1 patients. As observed in HeLa cells, siRNA treatment effectively reduced the expression of neurofibromin (supplemental Fig. S2) and induced dynamic morphological changes with the robust stress fiber formation and focal adhesion assembly in HT1080 cells (Fig. 2, j-o). These observations suggest that neurofibromin plays a role in regulation of cytoskeletal organization.Effect of NF1 siRNA on Cell Migration in Extracellular Matrix—Migration of cells in the extracellular matrix requires morphological changes with dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. Therefore, we performed a Matrigel assay to assess the growth and motility of neurofibromin-depleted cells in the extracellular matrix. The growth of neurofibromin-depleted HeLa cells was about 1.5-2.0 times faster than that of control cells after contact with Matrigel for 3 days (data not shown). However, the number of colonies formed in the Matrigel was obviously fewer in neurofibromin-depleted cells compared with control cells (Fig. 3A), because neurofibromin-depleted cells tended to generate cell aggregation. After culturing for 24 h, the control cells became rounded shape and migrated into the Matrigel (Fig. 3B, a and e) and then formed a small spherical mass in Matrigel at 96 h in culture (Fig. 3B, i and m). In contrast, ∼30% of the neurofibromin-depleted cells showed an elongated morphology (Fig. 3B, b-d and f-h). The neurofibromin-depleted cells migrated into the Matrigel and formed gross irregular and insular spherical masses around 96 h in culture (Fig. 3B, j-i and n-p). Time lapse, real time recording analysis revealed that neurofibromin-depleted cells actively move and rapidly invade in the Matrigel and aggregate to form gross spherical masses (Fig. 3C, lower panels, and supplemental Movie 2), whereas control cells move slowly and experience less aggregation (Fig. 3C, upper panels, and supplemental Movie 1). HT1080 cells treated with NF1 siRNA also tended to form cell aggregation in the Matrigel matrix (Supplemental Fig. S3). These results indicate that the reduction of neurofibromin by siRNA promotes peculiar cell migration and cell-cell adhesion, forming cell aggregates in the Matrigel matrix.FIGURE 3Depletion of neurofibromin promotes the formation of gross spherical cell aggregates in Matrigel matrix.A, the number of colonies that formed on Matrigel matrix. HeLa cells were transfected with either control or three NF1 siRNA on normal culture dish. After 24 h, 5000 cells were seeded onto a Matrigel-precoated dish. The number of colonies formed at 96 h after the replating was counted under the phase-contrast microscope. Each datum represents the average of three independent experiments. The error bars represent S.D. B, neurofibromin-depleted cells formed gross irregular spherical masses. Transfected cells replated on the Matrigel matrix were examined by the phase-contrast microscope at × 100 and × 200 magnifications at 24 h (a-h) and 96 h (i-p) after replating. C, the process of aggregation of neurofibromin-depleted cells on the Matrigel matrix was observed by time lapse DIC video microscopy (supplemental Movies 1 and 2). Cells were transfected with control siRNA (upper panels; Movie 1) and NF1 (609) siRNA (lower panels; Movie 2) on culture dishes and then were seeded onto Matrigel-precoated dishes. Time lapse movie recording was started 12 h after the replating, and images were collected every 5 min for a period of 2 days.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Morphological Changes Induced by Reduction of NF1 Expression Are Due to Cofilin Phosphorylation—The morphological changes and active motility of neurofibromin-depleted cells suggested that neurofibromin is involved in regulation of actin cytoskeletal reorganization. Thus, we investigated various signal molecules that regulate actin cytoskeletal reorganization in the neurofibromin-depleted cells and found that phosphorylation of ADF/cofilin is significantly elevated with time in the cells, whereas their levels in control siRNA transfectants had no changes (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. S4). The activity of ADF/cofilin is negatively regulated by phosphorylation at Ser3 through a RhoGTPase-ROCK-LIMK pathway that is activated in response to extracellular stimuli, such as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), and followed by stabilization and accumulation of actin filaments (11Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Narumiya S. Science. 1999; 285: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that the excessive actin stress fiber formation in neurofibromin-depleted cells was due to the enhancement of ADF/cofilin phosphorylation through Rho activation. It was shown that components of serum, such as LPA, activate Rho-GTPase, leading to the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesion, and subsequently Rho become inactivated in adherent cells (19Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar, 20Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether LPA and serum stimulation affect the level of phosphocofilin (Fig. 4B) and the formation of actin stress fibers in neurofibromin-depleted cells (Fig. 4C). Control cells after serum stimulation exhibited prompt cofilin dephosphorylation after transient phosphorylation with the enhancement of cortical actin (Fig. 4, B (upper panels) and C (b and c)), followed by attenuation to be consistent with the dephosphorylation of cofilin. In contrast, after serum stimulation, neurofibromin-depleted cells exhibited sustained levels of phosphorylated cofilin with the enhancement of actin stress fibers in the cell body (Fig. 4, B (upper panels) and C (g and h)). The induced actin stress fibers persisted, consistent with the sustained phosphorylation of cofilin. In addition, when cells were stimulated by LPA, control cells exhibited biphasic cofilin phosphorylation (dephosphorylation at 10 min and rephosphorylation at 60 min after the LPA treatment) with enhancement of cortical actin and fine stress fibers formed in the cell body (Fig. 4, B (lower panels) and C (d and e)), followed by the attenuation consistent with the dephosphorylation of cofilin. In contrast, neurofibromin-depleted cells exhibited a high level of phosphorylated cofilin with enhancement of actin stress fiber polymerization in the center of the cell body (Fig. 4, B (lower panels) and C (i and j)). These results supported our hypothesis that the sustained cofilin phosphorylation by serum and LPA stimulation induces the formation of stable actin stress fibers in cells where neurofibromin was down-regulated.FIGURE 4Promotion of cofilin phosphorylation in neurofibromin-depleted cells.A, effect of neurofibromin depletion on the levels of phosphocofilin. Either control or NF1 siRNA were transfected into HeLa cells. After 24 and 48 h, cells were harvested and examined for the levels of Ser(P)3-cofilin by immunoblotting analysis. B, neurofibromin-depleted cells exhibited a high level of phosphorylated cofilin. After 24 h of siRNA transfection in a serum-free condition, HeLa cells were stimulated with 10% serum or 10 μm LPA for the indicated periods and then examined for levels of Ser(P)3-cofilin by immunoblot analysis. C, enhancement of actin stress fiber formation in neurofibromin-depleted cells. After 24 h of siRNA transfection under a serum-free condition, HeLa cells were stimulated with serum or LPA at the indicated times and then stained with rhodamin phalloidin to visualize the actin cytoskeleton. D, the nonphosphorylatable cofilin S3A mutant suppresses excessive stress fiber formation in neurofibromin-depleted cells. HeLa cells co-transfected with FLAG-cofilin S3A and either control or NF1 siRNA were stained with Alexa 488 phalloidin and anti-FLAG antibody at 24 h after transfection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Nonphosphorylatable Cofilin-S3A Mutant Rescues the Phenotypes of Neurofibromin-depleted Cells—To confirm whether NF1 siRNA-induced morphological effects are attributable to inactivation of cofilin, we co-transfected NF1 siRNA with a cofilin-S3A mutant that functions as a constitutively active form of cofilin.

https://openalex.org/W2014740187,"Glioblastoma multifome is the most common and most aggressive primary brain tumor with no current curative therapy. We found expression of the bZip transcription factor ATF5 in all 29 human glioblastomas and eight human and rat glioma cell lines assessed. ATF5 is not detectably expressed by mature brain neurons and astrocytes, but is expressed by reactive astrocytes. Interference with ATF5 function or expression in all glioma cell lines tested causes marked apoptotic cell death. In contrast, such manipulations do not affect survival of ATF5-expressing cultured astrocytes or of several other cell types that express this protein. In a proof-of-principle experiment, retroviral delivery of a function-blocking mutant form of ATF5 into a rat glioma model evokes death of the infected tumor cells, but not of infected brain cells outside the tumors. The widespread expression of ATF5 in glioblastomas and the selective effect of interference with ATF5 function/expression on their survival suggest that ATF5 may be an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in such tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2030453256,"The Rho activator ECT2 functions as a key regulator in cytokinesis. ECT2 is phosphorylated during G2/M phase, but the physiological significance of this event is not well known. In this study, we show that phosphorylation of ECT2 at threonine-341 (T341) affects the autoregulatory mechanism of ECT2. In G2/M phase, ECT2 was phosphorylated at T341 most likely by Cyclin B/Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1), and then dephosphorylated before cytokinesis. Depletion of ECT2 by RNA interference (RNAi) efficiently induced multinucleate cells. Expression of the phospho-deficient mutant of ECT2 at T341 suppressed the multinucleation induced by RNAi to ECT2, indicating that ECT2 is biologically active even when it is not phosphorylated at T341. However, the phospho-mimic mutation at T341 weakly stimulates the catalytic activity of ECT2 as detected by serum response element reporter gene assays. As T341 is located at the hinge region of the N-terminal regulatory domain and C-terminal catalytic domain, phosphorylation of T341 may help accessing downstream signaling molecules to further activate ECT2. We found that the phospho-mimic mutation T341D increases binding with itself or the N-terminal half of ECT2. These results suggest a conformational change of ECT2 upon phosphorylation at T341. Therefore, ECT2 activity might be regulated by the phosphorylation status of T341. We propose that T341 phosphorylation by Cyclin B/Cdk1 could be a trigger for further activation of ECT2."
https://openalex.org/W1981290840,"Ing1 belongs to the family of evolutionary conserved genes encoding nuclear PHD finger-containing proteins implicated in a variety of processes, including tumorigenesis, replicative senescence, excision repair and response to genotoxic stress. We have generated mice deficient in all the isoforms of Ing1 by targeted disruption of the exon that is common for all ing1 transcripts. Embryonic fibroblasts from ing1-knockout mice were similar to the wild-type cells in their growth characteristics, replicative lifespan in culture, p53 induction and sensitivity to various cytotoxic treatments with minor alterations in cell cycle distribution in response to genotoxic stress. ing1-deficient animals are characterized by reduced size with no obvious morphological, physiological or behavioral abnormalities, indicating that ing1 function is dispensable for the viability of mice under normal physiological conditions. Loss of ing1 was associated with earlier onset and higher incidence of lymphomas. Consistent with the possible involvement of Ing1 in DNA repair, ing1-deficient mice were more sensitive to total body gamma radiation. Our observations are well in line with the suggested role of ing1 as a candidate tumor suppressor gene involved in control of DNA damage response."
https://openalex.org/W2029462907,"Benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE, a carcinogen present in tobacco smoke and environmental pollution) has been shown to suppress retinoic acid receptor-beta2 (RAR-β2) and induce cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. Restoration of RAR-β2 inhibited growth and colony formation of esophageal cancer cells, which was correlated with COX-2 suppression. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms for RAR-β2-mediated suppression of COX-2 expression using BPDE as a tool. We found that BPDE-induced COX-2 expression was through inhibition of RAR-β2 and consequently, induction of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1/2 (Erk1/2) phosphorylation, and c-Jun expression. Esophageal cancer cells that do not express RAR-β2 did not respond to BPDE for induction of COX-2. BPDE was also unable to induce COX-2 expression after RAR-β2 expression was manipulated in these esophageal cancer cells. Furthermore, BPDE induced time-dependent methylation of RAR-β2 gene promoter in esophageal cancer cells. Transfection of RAR-β2 expression vector into esophageal cancer cells suppressed expression of EGFR, Erk1/2 phosphorylation, c-Jun, and COX-2. In addition, co-treatment of RAR-β2-positive cells with BPDE and the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 caused little change in c-Jun and COX-2 expression. This study demonstrated that BPDE-suppressed expression of RAR-β2 results in COX-2 induction and restoration of RAR-β2 expression reduces COX-2 protein in esophageal cancer cells, thereby further supporting our previous finding that RAR-β2 plays an important role in suppressing esophageal carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2088833547,"Keratocytes normally express high levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase and keratocan. They proliferate and lose their keratocyte markers when they become fibroblastic during corneal wound healing. Keratocytes cultured in fetal bovine serum also become fibroblastic, proliferate, and lose these markers. In this report, we studied the effects of three serum growth factors, fibroblast growth factor-2, insulin, and platelet-derived growth factor-BB, on keratocyte proliferation and the maintenance of the keratocyte markers in 7-day cultures in cells plated at low (5,000 cells/cm2) and high (20,000 cells/cm2) density in serum-free medium. Keratocyte proliferation was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation and by DNA content of the cultures. Cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase and keratocan accumulated in the medium were quantified by Western blot. The results showed that all the growth factors stimulated proliferation, but insulin stimulated proliferation more consistently. The keratocyte markers aldehyde dehydrogenase and keratocan were maintained after 7 days in culture in all growth factors, but keratocyte cell morphology was only maintained in medium containing insulin. Most of the proteoglycans were degraded in cultures of keratocytes plated at low density and cultured in the absence of growth factors. This degradation was prevented when keratocytes were cultured in the presence of the growth factors or when keratocytes were plated at high density.

Lumican and keratocan are members of the small leucine-rich protein family and are the most abundant keratan sulfate proteoglycans in the corneal stroma (3Kao W.W. Liu C.Y. Glycoconj. J. 2002; 19: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Lumican is also present in many tissues (1Corpuz L.M. Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Bottomley G.S. Prakash S. Conrad G.W. J.

Mutations in the human keratocan gene have been identified as a cause of cornea plana (10Liu C.Y. Birk D.E. Hassell J.R. Kane B. Kao W.W. J. Biol.

This suggests that keratocan plays a fundamental role in maintenance of the corneal structure and that its function cannot be rescued by other members of the small leucine-rich protein family (13Chakravarti S. Exp. Eye Res. 2001; 73: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Keratocytes normally exhibit a dendritic morphology but become fibroblastic in appearance during wound healing. Both keratan sulfate synthesis and the expression of keratocan substantially decrease during the fibroblast/myofibroblast transformation that occurs during wound healing (14Hassell J.R. Cintron C.

Keratocytes isolated from the stroma and cultured in medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum exhibit fibroblastic or myofibroblastic phenotypes (17Beales M.P. Funderburgh J.L. Jester J.V.

This indicates that keratocan can be considered a marker for the native keratocyte phenotype (18Funderburgh J.L. Mann M.M. Funderburgh M.L. J. Biol.

Keratocytes contain unusually large amounts of corneal crystallins such as aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) 2The abbreviations used are: ALDH, aldehyde dehydrogenase; FGF-2, fibroblast growth factor-2; PDGF-BB, platelet-derived growth factor-BB; DMEM/F12, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 Medium, 1:1; ITS, insulin, transferrin, and selenium medium supplement, used at 1× from 100× concentrate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; bis-tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 613-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been speculated that crystallins may play a role in matching the refractive index of the intracellular space to the refractive index of the stroma (21Jester J.V. Moller-Pedersen T. Huang J. Sax C.M. Kays W.T. Cavangh H.D. Petroll W.M. Piatigorsky J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 613-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or they may help organize the intracellular space and thus reduce keratocyte reflectivity (22Moller-Pedersen T. Exp. Eye Res. 2004; 78: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). ALDH may also protect the cornea from UV light irradiation (23Abedinia M. Pain T. Algar E.M. Holmes R.S. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 51: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Corneal crystallin levels decrease markedly in wound-healing keratocytes in vivo, and this would partially explain the increased haziness observed during the healing of corneal wounds (18Funderburgh J.L.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 613-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ALDH is a 52-kDa protein and is lost from the cytoplasm during culture in serum (20Berryhill B.L. Kader R. Kane B. Birk D.E. Feng J. Hassell J.R. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 3416-3421PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that a high level of cytosolic ALDH is also a marker of the native keratocyte phenotype. Keratocytes isolated from the stroma and cultured in serum-free medium retain a dendritic morphology and maintain the expression of ALDH and keratocan (15Fini M.E. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 1999; 18: 529-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 18Funderburgh J.L. Mann M.M. Funderburgh M.L. J. Biol.

The loss of keratocan and ALDH expression by culture in fetal bovine serum is likely because of factors in serum that change the keratocyte phenotype. Serum is a complex mixture of salts, proteins, lipids, growth factors, and hormones. One of the growth factors in serum is PDGF-BB (25Ross R. Bowen-Pope D.F. Raines E.W. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1990; 327: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), which is released from the platelets during the clotting process (26Heldin C.H. Westermark B. Wasteson A. Biochem. J. 1981; 193: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Removal of the platelets from blood prior to the clotting process produces serum with substantially less growth-promoting properties (27Westermark B. Wasteson A. Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 98: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In keratocyte cultures, the inclusion of PDGF-BB in culture medium causes cell migration and proliferation, as well as collagen gel contraction and fibroblastic differentiation (24Jester J.V. Ho-Chang J. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 77: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Insulin is also present in serum (28Pedersen W.A. Flynn E.R. Neurobiol. Dis. 2004; 17: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Insulin interacts with its receptor and modulates metabolic processes but also acts as a mitogen for some cell types (29Desbois-Mouthon C. Cadoret A. Blivet-Van Eggelpoel M.J. Bertrand F. Caron M. Atfi A. Cherqui G. Capeau J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 922-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 30Conejo R. Lorenzo M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that insulin receptors are present in the anterior segment of the eye (31Rocha E.M. Cunha D.A. Carneiro E.M. Boschero A.C. Saad M.J. Velloso L.A. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2002; 506: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and insulin has been identified as a component of tear film (32Rocha E.M. Cunha D.A. Carneiro E.M. Boschero A.C. Saad M.J. Velloso L.A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 963-967PubMed Google Scholar).

Art to Science. 2001; 20: 1-4Google Scholar, 38Larsson A. Skoldenberg E. Ericson H. Angiogenesis. 2002; 5: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and FGF-2 has been shown to promote keratocyte proliferation as well as keratan sulfate proteoglycan secretion into the medium when cells were cultured in 0.1% platelet-poor horse serum (39Long C.J. Roth M.R. Tasheva E.S. Funderburgh M. Smit R. Conrad G.W. Funderburgh J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13918-13923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Here we characterize the effects of FGF-2, insulin, and PDGF-BB in defined cell culture medium on keratocyte proliferation and morphology as well as on proteoglycan synthesis and ALDH expression, two known markers of the native keratocyte phenotype. We found that all growth factors caused cell proliferation and maintained keratocan and ALDH expression, but only insulin maintained the dendritic morphology of keratocytes. The results of this study suggest that insulin may play a role in the maintenance of the corneal stroma after wounding. Chemicals—Chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise indicated. Cell Culture—Bovine keratocytes were isolated using two sequential collagenase digestions as described previously (40Musselmann K. Kane B.P. Hassell J.R. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 77: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 41Berryhill B.L. Beales M.P. Hassell J.R. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 1201-1207PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, corneas were obtained from freshly harvested, 12–18-month-old calf eyes (Pel-Freez, Rogers, AR). The central portion of the cornea was minced and digested with 3.3 mg/ml Sigmablend Collagenase Type L at 37 °C under shaking for 45 min to remove the epithelium and the endothelium. The remaining stromal fragments were further digested with fresh collagenase for an additional 150 min to disrupt the matrix and release the keratocytes. The cells were pelleted by low speed centrifugation (400 × g for 10 min) and resuspended in DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen). Cell viability and number were determined using trypan blue exclusion. The cells were then plated in serum-free DMEM/F12 into 6-well plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) at low density (5,000 cells/cm2) or high density (20,000 cells/cm2) and allowed to attach overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The medium was changed the next day and every third day afterward with fresh DMEM/F12 or DMEM/F12 supplemented with FGF-2 (10 ng/ml), insulin (10 μg/ml), PDGF-BB (50 ng/ml), or ITS (contains insulin (10 μg/ml), transferrin (5.5 μg/ml), and selenium (0.67 μg/ml) (Invitrogen)). FGF-2 and PDGF-BB were used at concentrations previously shown to stimulate maximum or near maximum proliferation of keratocytes (24Jester J.V. Ho-Chang J. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 77: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The FGF-2 and PDGF-BB were dissolved in 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin as per the manufacturer's instructions that resulted in a final concentration 400 and 1,000 ng of bovine serum albumin/ml medium, respectively. The presence of these low levels of bovine serum albumin in the medium did not 35 result in an increase in DNA content, ALDH, keratocan levels, or 35SO4 incorporation into proteoglycans(data not shown). 35SO4 Incorporation into Proteoglycans—Cultures were supplemented with 50 μCi/ml 35SO4 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on day 1 for 72 h, and the medium was collected, frozen, and lyophilized. The dry medium was then reconstituted in 4 m GuHCl and unincorporated 35SO4 was removed using PD10 columns (Amersham Biosciences). The fractions containing incorporated 35SO4 were combined, concentrated using Amicon Ultra spin-concentrators (Millipore Corp., Millford, MA), fractionated using a Superose 6 12/30 HR column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated, and eluted with 4 m GuHCl containing 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 6.5, at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Fractions (0.6 ml) were collected, and incorporation was measured by liquid scintillation counting. DNA Quantitation and [3H]Thymidine Incorporation—Cell cultures were labeled with 20 μCi/ml of [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 72-h periods on days 1 and 4. The cell layers were harvested on days 1, 4, and 7 to measure DNA content and [3H]thymidine incorporation. Briefly, the cell layers were rinsed with PBS, frozen, thawed, and then solubilized in a lysis buffer supplemented with a DNA-binding dye (Cyquant, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). Three aliquots from each well were used to determine the DNA content/well using fluorimetry at 480/535 nm. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was determined by precipitating an aliquot of the solubilized cells overnight at 4 °C in 10% trichloroacetic acid using bovine serum albumin as a carrier protein. The precipitated DNA was collected onto glass fiber prefilters (Millipore catalog number APFC02500) by vacuum filtration. The filters were washed three times with 5 ml of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and placed into vials, and incorporation was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Immunoblotting—Cell layers were solubilized in 2% SDS and examined for ALDH levels by SDS-PAGE Western blot. The amount of cell layer extract loaded on the gel from different culture conditions was adjusted to give a similar level of signal. The keratocan content in the medium was also measured by Western blot. The medium was collected, dialyzed, and lyophilized. The powder was reconstituted in water at either 1/150th of the original volume for medium from keratocytes plated at low density or in 1/50th of the original volume for medium from keratocytes plated at high density. Medium equivalent to 3 wells for keratocytes at low density and medium equivalent to half a well for keratocytes at high density were digested with endo-β-galactosidase (Seikagaku, Associates of Cape Cod, E. Falmouth, MA), and keratocan core protein levels were determined by SDS-PAGE Western blot. The proteins were loaded and separated in 4–10% bis-tris gels (Novex, Invitrogen). The separated proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) at room temperature, blocked with 0.2% I-Block and 0.3% Tween 20 in PBS (0.2% I-PBS-T), and incubated overnight at 4 °C with either 1:5,000 anti-ALDH antibody or 1:1,000 rabbit anti-bovine keratocan antibody. Rabbit polyclonal antiserum to bovine ALDH was a generous gift of Dr. R. Lindahl (University of South Dakota), and the rabbit antiserum to bovine keratocan was previously described (41Berryhill B.L. Beales M.P. Hassell J.R. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 1201-1207PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were rinsed in 0.1% I-PBS-T, incubated at room temperature for 1 h in 1:10,000 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences), and rinsed four times with 0.1% I-PBS-T. Protein bands were visualized using chemiluminescence (ECL Western blotting analysis system, Amersham Biosciences) on Kodak Bio-Max XAR x-ray film. Films were scanned, and the band density for ALDH and keratocan core protein was measured using a Bio-Rad GS-710 Calibrated Imaging Densitometer. The resulting pixel density was divided by the DNA content of the culture and expressed in pixel density/μg of DNA. Cell Morphology—Cell morphology was studied with a Nikon Diaphot phase contrast microscope and recorded using a Nikon D100 digital camera. Images were resized using Adobe Photoshop, and image levels and contrast were adjusted after the images were converted to grayscale. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using Statview (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Samples were analyzed using a paired t test. S.E. was used when n > 3, and S.D. used when n = 3. Keratocytes plated at low density were radiolabeled with [3H]thymidine from days 1 to 4 and days 4 to 7 to determine the effect of growth factors on DNA. Keratocytes cultured in all tested growth factors showed a significant increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation during both labeling periods (Fig. 1) when compared with control. FGF-2 and PDGF-BB, however, stimulated significantly more incorporation during the second time period than during the first time period. The DNA content of the cultures was measured on days 4 and 7 to determine whether the number of cells in the culture increased. By day 7, the DNA content/well of cells cultured in ITS and insulin increased 3.1-fold (to 330 and 323 ng/well), and cells in PDGF-BB increased 2.3-fold (to 241 ng/well), whereas culture in FGF-2 resulted in a 36% increase (to 142 ng/well), and the control cultures had a 20% increase (to 125 ng/well) (Fig. 2A). The DNA content of cultures plated at high density (Fig. 2B) also increased over the 7-day study period, but the maximum increase in DNA content was 59% for cells cultured in insulin, followed by ITS, FGF-2,and PDGF-BB (52, 47, and 27% respectively), but the DNA levels of the control cultures declined by 31%. The lower growth rate of the cells plated at high density is likely because of contact inhibition. ALDH is a 52-kDa cytoplasmic protein detected in Western blots of cell layer extracts (Fig. 3, lane 1). The pixel densities of this protein in each culture condition were determined and expressed per μgofDNA of the cultures. Keratocytes plated at high density and cultured for 7 days contained 1.8× more ALDH/μg of DNA than keratocytes seeded at low density (Fig. 4). The levels of ALDH in keratocytes plated at low density and cultured in the presence of growth factors was not significantly different from the levels in the control cultures (Fig. 4A, open bars) but was slightly reduced at high density (filled bars). Keratocytes plated at high density and cultured in the presence of FGF-2 contained significantly lower ALDH levels than the control keratocytes.FIGURE 4Pixel densities of ALDH content of the cell layers (A) and keratocan in the medium (B).A, the Western blots using antibodies against ALDH were scanned, and the pixel density of each band was determined. The pixel density value was divided by the micrograms of DNA in the culture. Keratocytes plated at low (open bars) and high (filled bars) density and cultured for 7 days. Keratocytes plated at high density cultured in FGF-2 showed a significant decrease in cytosolic ALDH (p < 0.02). n for all samples was 3. B, cell media for keratocytes at low and high density were collected, concentrated 150- or 50-fold (low and high density, respectively), the medium equivalent to 3 wells (low density) or half a well (high density) was digested with endo-β-galactosidase, separated by SDS-PAGE, and plotted against keratocan core protein. The bands were scanned, and their pixel density was determined. The pixel density was then divided by the DNA content of each culture. At low density (open bars) FGF-2, insulin, ITS, and PDGF-BB stimulate keratocan secretion, whereas at high density (filled bars) keratocan accumulated in the medium of all culture conditions. Bars represents mean of three determinations plus S.D. (for both A and B). At low density, only insulin significantly stimulated keratocan accumulation in the medium (p < 0.03). Keratocytes plated in the absence of growth factors accumulated significantly more keratocan in the medium than keratocytes plated at low density (p < 0.02). n for all samples was 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Keratocytes in culture normally do not accumulate an extracellular matrix associated with the cells but secrete proteoglycans into the medium instead (17Beales M.P. Funderburgh J.L. Jester J.V. Hassell J.R. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 1658-1663PubMed Google Scholar, 18Funderburgh J.L. Mann M.M. Funderburgh M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45629-45637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The keratocan in the medium appears in a Western blot as a smear of ∼80–160 kDa (Fig. 3, lane 2). Digestion of the medium with endo-β-galactosidase degrades the keratan sulfate chains and shifts the smear to a single band at 51 kDa (Fig. 3, lane 3). The pixel densities of the 51-kDa core protein for each culture condition were determined and expressed per μg of DNA (Fig. 4B). Keratocytes at low density and cultured in FGF-2, insulin, ITS, and PDGF-BB had higher (4-, 8-, 4-, and 2-fold, respectively) keratocan levels in the medium by day 7 (Fig. 4B, open bars). However, only stimulation by insulin resulted in a significant increase in keratocan secretion (p < 0.03). Keratocytes at high density accumulated 60-fold more keratocan in the medium than keratocytes plated at low density (p < 0.02). Furthermore, in contrast to low density cultures, the growth factors did not significantly change keratocan levels in the medium (Fig. 4B, filled bars). The 35SO4-radiolabeled proteoglycans collected on day 4 were fractionated according to size on a Superose 6 column. The incorporated 35SO4 from keratocytes plated at low density and cultured in FGF-2, insulin, ITS, and PDGF-BB eluted between fractions 16 and 23 (Fig. 5A), close to the elution positions for keratocan and decorin (fractions 17–21) as determined by immunodot blot (data not shown). Most of the incorporated 35SO4 from keratocytes cultured at low density in DMEM alone, however, eluted between fractions 26 and 32. This is similar to the elution position of corneal keratan sulfate chains of 14-kDa size released by papain digestion from intact human and rabbit keratocan (14Hassell J.R. Cintron C. Kublin C. Newsome D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 222: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 42Hassell J.R. Newsome D.A. Krachmer J.H. Rodrigues M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3705-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Proteolysis of the intact proteoglycan in cell culture would result in the GAG chain containing a residual peptide being released into the medium. Papain digestion did not alter the elution position of the incorporated 35SO4 eluting between fractions 26 and 32 (not shown) suggesting that the incorporated 35SO4 from the keratocytes cultured in DMEM/F12 were not bound to a large core protein. When keratocytes were plated at high density, however, most of their 35SO4 incorporated products eluted between fractions 17 and 22 (Fig. 5B) whether or not the cells were cultured in growth factors. Phase-contrast microscopy was used to examine the morphology of the cultured cells prior to harvesting on day 7 (Fig. 6). Cells in DMEM/F12 retain the characteristic dendritic morphology of in situ keratocytes (Fig. 6A). Cells cultured in FGF-2, however, appear fibroblastic, with flattened, spindle-shaped cell bodies and lack the dendritic processes (Fig. 6B) characteristic of keratocytes. Cells cultured in insulin and ITS appear flattened but still retain their dendritic processes (Fig. 6, C and D, respectively), yet the dendrites of cells cultured in ITS appear longer and join with other cells. Cells cultured in PDGF-BB appear fibroblastic, have flat cell bodies, and are spindle-shaped (Fig. 6E). The results of this study show that all the growth factors tested stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation and increased the DNA content of the cultures over the 6-day culture period. Comparing the response to each of the different growth factors, however, shows that only insulin stimulated thymidine incorporation similarly during the first 3-day and the second 3-day time period. Furthermore, only the cultures in insulin consistently increased in DNA content during the 6-day culture period and attained the highest DNA content at the end of the 6-day culture period for both low and high initial plating densities. Even with this extensive proliferation over the 6-day time period, keratocytes in insulin maintained ALDH content and keratocan production, the two markers of the keratocyte phenotype, as well as their dendritic morphology. These results suggest that insulin may be useful in expanding a population of keratocytes in culture without changing their phenotype. Keratocytes cultured in FGF-2 and PDGF-BB also showed increased incorporation of [3H]thymidine in keratocytes plated at low density. The rate of incorporation, however, was significantly higher during the second 3-day time period than during the first time period, but the DNA content of the cultures did not increase from day 4 to day 7. This suggests that in addition to increased cell proliferation, FGF-2 and PDGF-BB may also be causing cell death. Like the culture in insulin, ALDH and keratocan production were maintained by culture in FGF-2 and PDGF-BB. Unlike insulin, however, culture in FGF-2 and PDGF-BB caused the keratocytes to become spindle-shaped or fibroblastic. This suggests that cell morphology and ALDH/keratocan production are not linked. Overall, these results would suggest that the loss of ALDH and keratocan by keratocytes cultured in medium containing fetal bovine serum (17Beales M.P. Funderburgh J.L. Jester J.V. Hassell J.R.

The results of this study also show that plating keratocytes at low density and in the absence of growth factors results in the degradation of the proteoglycans secreted into the medium. The incorporated 35SO4 from keratocytes at low density and in the absence of growth factors eluted between fractions 27 and 32, close to the elution position of the keratan sulfate chains released by protease digestion from human and rabbit corneas (14Hassell J.R. Cintron C. Kublin C. Newsome D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 222: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 42Hassell J.R. Newsome D.A. Krachmer J.H. Rodrigues M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3705-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In contrast, the 35SO4 incorporated by keratocytes cultured with growth factors eluted in one major peak between fractions 17 and 21, in the elution position of keratocan (fractions 18–20) and decorin (fractions 17–21). Keratocan and decorin are members of the leucine-rich proteoglycan gene family (3Kao W.W. Liu C.Y. Glycoconj. J. 2002; 19: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These proteoglycans have a core protein of ∼40 kDa and contain multiple leucine-rich repeats. Keratocan has five N-linked glycosylation sites, but only three contain keratan sulfate chains (43Dunlevy J.R. Neame P.J. Vergnes J.P. Hassell J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9615-9621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Decorin has one O-linked glycosylation site that contains the single chondroitin sulfate chain (44Krusius T. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7683-7687Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). At high density, most of the 35SO4 incorporated by keratocytes cultured in DMEM/F12 alone eluted between fractions 16 and 21, with only some of the incorporated 35SO4 eluting between fractions 26–31. This suggests that the presence of growth factors in the medium for cells plated at low density or plating cells at high density is necessary to prevent the degradation of proteoglycans. This may explain why the keratocan signal was lower in low density control-plated keratocytes than keratocytes plated at high density. The core proteins of the proteoglycans may be degraded and not detected by Western blot, but the 35SO4 incorporated in the residual GAG chains is detectable. The growth factors may be playing a role in protecting the secreted proteoglycans from proteolysis or stimulating the production of a cell product that inhibits proteolysis. The proteoglycans produced by keratocytes plated at high density are not degraded in the absence of growth factors. This suggests that plating density may play an important role in proteoglycan stability and accumulation. It is possible that keratocytes secrete other extracellular matrix components that interact with the proteoglycans in the medium and that at low density the unstimulated keratocytes do not secrete enough extracellular matrix components to prevent the degradation. Insulin acts through its transmembrane receptor and modulates several metabolic processes with respect to glucose, lipids, and proteins (29Desbois-Mouthon C. Cadoret A. Blivet-Van Eggelpoel M.J. Bertrand F. Caron M. Atfi A. Cherqui G. Capeau J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 922-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The interaction of insulin with its receptor also activates members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family and results in cell proliferation as well (29Desbois-Mouthon C. Cadoret A. Blivet-Van Eggelpoel M.J. Bertrand F. Caron M. Atfi A. Cherqui G. Capeau J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 922-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 30Conejo R. Lorenzo M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We have shown that insulin stimulates keratocytes to proliferate in culture. This suggests that keratocytes in culture express the insulin receptor. Keratocytes cultured in insulin maintain their dendritic morphology and the expression of keratocan and ALDH. Insulin is also required for the maintenance of the adipocyte phenotype (45Serrero G. Lepak N. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 1999; 35: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and the addition of insulin to the medium of activated hepatic stellate cells results in the up-regulation of putative adipogenic transcription factors resulting in the cells returning to their quiescent, premyofibroblastic state (46She H. Xiong S. Hazra S. Tsukamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4959-4967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Insulin may be an important growth factor needed to maintain the proliferation and the phenotype of a number of different cell types."

Unique to the ErbB family, ErbB-4 is then proteolytically cleaved by α- and γ-secretase to produce an 80 kDa intracellular domain (s80 ICD) fragment. This fragment is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of many normal and cancer cells and can interact with transcription factors in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Since the s80 ICD lacks ectodomain sequences known to play a major role in dimerization of ErbB family members, we asked whether the s80 ICD is an active tyrosine kinase. Here, we demonstrate that the s80 ICD is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase and can form homodimers. The s80 ICD is autophosphorylated in cells and can phosphorylate an exogenous substrate in vitro. Also, the s80 ICD can coassociate and dimers are detected by chemical crosslinking. This is the first example of constitutive kinase activation and dimerization totally within the cytoplasmic domain of an ErbB receptor and suggests that the s80 ICD may function to phosphorylate substrates in the cytoplasm or nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2001249546,"BRCA2 (BReast CAncer susceptibility gene 2) germline mutation carriers are at increased risk for breast and ovarian cancers. Mutations occurring in the ovarian cancer cluster region (OCCR) are linked to higher ovarian cancer and/or lower breast cancer risk(s) than mutations occurring elsewhere in BRCA2. Most BRCA2 germline mutations introduce premature termination codons (PTCs), making their mRNAs likely targets of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a mechanism that eliminates PTC-bearing transcripts to prevent expression of truncated proteins. Contradictory evidence exists regarding whether NMD can be triggered by PTCs located far upstream of the nearest exon-exon junction (EEJ). Since the OCCR comprises a major portion of the 4.9 kb exon 11 of BRCA2, we investigated if transcripts bearing PTCs in this large exon are unable to trigger NMD, and if this might contribute to the phenotypic difference associated with the OCCR. We examined cDNA from 18 carriers of PTC-introducing germline mutations located throughout BRCA2, and found that PTC-bearing transcripts were 1.4-3.3-fold less prevalent than their nonmutated counterparts irregardless of PTC position. We conclude that NMD can recognize PTCs up to 4.5 kb upstream of the nearest EEJ, demonstrating that a general inability of NMD to recognize PTCs in exon 11 is unlikely to explain the genotype-phenotype correlation associated with the OCCR."

https://openalex.org/W2019375321,"Tumor-associated mutant forms of p53 can exert an antiapoptotic gain of function activity, which confers a selective advantage upon tumor cells harboring such mutations. We report that mutant p53 suppresses the expression of the MSP (MST-1/HGFL) gene, encoding the ligand of the receptor tyrosine kinase RON, implicated in a variety of cellular responses. Mutant p53 associates with the MSP gene promoter and represses its transcriptional activity, leading to a decrease in mRNA levels and a subsequent decrease in the levels of secreted MSP protein. Forced downregulation of MSP expression in H1299 cells, derived from a large-cell lung carcinoma, confers increased resistance against etoposide-induced cell death. These antiapoptotic consequences of MSP downregulation seemingly conflict with the well-documented ability of the RON receptor to promote cell survival and tumor progression when aberrantly hyperactive. Yet, they are consistent with the fact that reduced MSP expression was observed in many types of human cancer, including large-cell lung carcinoma. Thus, repression of MSP gene expression by mutant p53 may contribute to oncogenesis in a cell type-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W2061283560,"The Irs2 branch of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling cascade activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase → Akt → Foxo1 cascade in many tissues, including hepatocytes and pancreatic β-cells. The 3′-lipid phosphatase Pten ordinarily attenuates this cascade; however, its influence on β-cell growth or function is unknown. To determine whether decreased Pten expression could restore β-cell function and prevent diabetes in Irs2-/- mice, we generated wild type or Irs2 knock-out mice that were haploinsufficient for Pten (Irs2-/-::Pten+/-). Irs2-/- mice develop diabetes by 3 months of age as β-cell mass declined progressively until insulin production was lost. Pten insufficiency increased peripheral insulin sensitivity in wild type and Irs2-/- mice and increased Akt and Foxo1 phosphorylation in the islets. Glucose tolerance improved in the Pten+/- mice, although β-cell mass and circulating insulin levels decreased. Compared with Irs2-/- mice, the Irs2-/-::Pten+/- mice displayed nearly normal glucose tolerance and survived without diabetes, because normal but small islets produced sufficient insulin until the mice died of lymphoproliferative disease at 12 months age.

The failure of these signaling pathways causes insulin resistance and metabolic disease, such as glucose intolerance, obesity, and dyslipidemia, that progress to diabetes when the β-cells fail to secrete sufficient insulin quickly enough to compensate for insulin resistance (1O'Rahilly S. Barroso I. Wareham N.J. Science. 2005; 307: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The insulin receptor substrates Irs1 and Irs2 are especially important because they integrate signals from the insulin and IGF receptors with heterologous cytokines and metabolites to coordinate systemic nutrient homeostasis (2White M.F. Science. 2003; 302: 1710-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Irs2 is especially important for the regulation of glucose homeostasis because it promotes β-cell function, liver metabolism, and hypothalamic nutrient sensing (3Rhodes C.J. Science. 2005; 307: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Thus, global dysregulation of Irs2 signaling causes peripheral insulin resistance that is exacerbated by concomitant pancreatic β-cell failure (4Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J.

The products of the PI 3-kinase, PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5) P3, create platforms to recruit Pdk1 and Akt to the inner face of the plasma membrane, where they interact to generate downstream signals (7Brazil D.P. Yang Z.Z. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Akt plays a central role during the insulin response because it phosphorylates cellular substrates that control glucose metabolism, cell survival, and gene transcription (7Brazil D.P. Yang Z.Z. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Pten is a potent negative regulator of insulin action and cellular proliferation and is one of the most frequently mutated genes in many forms of human cancer (8Li J. Yen C. Liaw D. Podsypanina K.

Pten attenuates downstream signaling by dephosphorylating the 3-phosphate on PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3, which reduces the recruitment of Pdk1 and Akt to the membrane (9Parsons R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, PTEN re-expression in a PTEN null human breast cell line causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, along with increased expression of IRS2 (10Simpson L. Li J. Liaw D. Hennessy I. Oliner J. Christians F. Parsons R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3947-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that Pten and Irs2 might coordinately regulate the PI 3-kinase → Akt cascade to influence both glucose homeostasis and cell growth. Consistent with the role of Pten to attenuate PI 3-kinase signaling, short term antisense Pten knock-down causes a reversal of hyperglycemia in both db/db and ob/ob mice and at least partial amelioration of peripheral insulin resistance in db/db mice (11Butler M. McKay R.A. Popoff I.J. Gaarde W.A. Witchell D. Murray S.F. Dean N.M. Bhanot S. Monia B.P. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1028-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Moreover, liver-specific Pten knock-out mice display enhanced insulin sensitivity and hepatic steatosis and glycogenosis (12Stiles B. Wang Y. Stahl A. Bassilian S. Lee W.P. Kim Y.J. Sherwin R.

Random-fed glucose and insulin measurements were performed as described previously (21Kushner J.A. Ye J. Schubert M. Burks D.J. Dow M.A. Flint C.L. Dutta S. Wright C.V. Montminy M.R. White M.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1193-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests were performed on mice fasted for 15-16 h with 2 g of d-glucose per kg of body weight as described previously (21Kushner J.A. Ye J. Schubert M. Burks D.J. Dow M.A. Flint C.L. Dutta S. Wright C.V. Montminy M.R. White M.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1193-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Intraperitoneal insulin tolerance tests were performed on fed mice with 1.5 units/kg, similar to methods described previously (21Kushner J.A. Ye J. Schubert M. Burks D.J. Dow M.A. Flint C.L. Dutta S. Wright C.V. Montminy M.R. White M.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1193-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Area under curve analysis was calculated with trapezoid rule algorithms for individual glucose tolerance tests and reported as min·mg/dl. Area above curve analysis was performed in a similar manner. Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemical localization of antigens and double-label immunohistochemistry were performed similarly to methods described previously (21Kushner J.A. Ye J. Schubert M. Burks D.J. Dow M.A. Flint C.L. Dutta S. Wright C.V. Montminy M.R. White M.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1193-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Pancreas samples were dissected from fed mice and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline solution overnight. Five-micrometer longitudinal sections of paraffin blocks were rehydrated with xylene followed by decreasing concentrations of ethanol, microwaved in 0.01 m sodium citrate (pH 6.0) for 20 min, and permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline prior to primary antisera incubation. Guinea pig anti-insulin, rabbit antiglucagon antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and rat anti-BrdUrd (BU1/75, Accurate Chemical, Westbury, NY) were used as primary antibodies. Secondary antibodies were labeled with Cy2 or Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Nuclear staining was performed with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Islet Morphometry—Adult β-cell area was measured by acquiring at least 20 adjacent nonoverlapping images with a ×10 objective of insulin-stained sections from 3- or 6-8-month-old male mice, at least five animals per genotype, with a Zeiss Axiovert microscope or a Zeiss Axioskop 2 plus mot microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Thornwood, NY) and captured with a Hamamatsu Orca or Orca ER digital camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, K.K., Hamamatsu City, Japan). Images were analyzed for area with Improvision Open Lab software (Improvision Scientific Imaging, Lexington, MA) similar to studies published previously (21Kushner J.A. Ye J. Schubert M. Burks D.J. Dow M.A. Flint C.L. Dutta S. Wright C.V. Montminy M.R. White M.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1193-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Results of β-cell quantification are expressed as the percentage of the total surveyed area containing cells positive for insulin. Islet density and size were calculated from captured insulin-stained images. Results were compared with independent t tests (unpaired two-tailed) and are reported as p values. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Mice were anesthetized, and the pancreas was removed, and islets were isolated as described previously (16Lin X. Taguchi A. Park S. Kushner J.A. Li F. Li Y. White M.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 908-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Islets were homogenized, and clarified supernatants containing 15 μg of total protein were immunoblotted with antibodies (Cell Signaling) against Akt, phospho-Akt, Foxo1, or phospho-Foxo1. The total amount of Akt and Foxo1 and the phosphorylated forms were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Calbiochem) and quantified using ImageQuant TL (16Lin X. Taguchi A. Park S. Kushner J.A. Li F. Li Y. White M.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 908-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). β-Cell Proliferation Studies—Three-month-old mice were injected with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd, Roche Applied Science; 100 μg/g body weight) 6 h prior to sacrifice (21Kushner J.A. Ye J. Schubert M. Burks D.J. Dow M.A. Flint C.L. Dutta S. Wright C.V. Montminy M.R. White M.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1193-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). 4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole/insulin/BrdUrd-stained pancreatic sections were examined to determine the total number of islets per section as well as the number of BrdUrd-positive β-cells per islet. BrdUrd-positive β-cells per islet were calculated by examining 5-6 sections per animal, 5-12 animals per genotype. Statistics—All results are reported as means ± S.E. of the mean for equivalent groups. Results were compared with independent t tests (unpaired and two-tailed) reported as p values. Creation of Irs2 Knock-out Pten Haploinsufficient Mice—To examine the role of PTEN in glucose homeostasis, we intercrossed Irs2+/- mice with Pten+/- mice for several generations. Male Irs2+/-::Pten+/- mice crossed with female Irs2+/- mice produced most of the genotypes at an expected frequency; however, this cross consistently failed to produce pups without Pten, Pten-/-, Irs2+/-::Pten-/-, or Irs2-/-::Pten-/- mice. These results indicated that a loss of Irs2 function did not rescue the embryonic lethal phenotype of Pten-/- mice that was reported previously (19Podsypanina K. Ellenson L.H. Nemes A. Gu J. Tamura M. Yamada K.M. Cordon-Cardo C. Catoretti G. Fisher P.E. Parsons R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1563-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 22Di Cristofano A. Pesce B. Cordon-Cardo C. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Irs2-/- mice ordinarily die with severe hyperglycemia between 10 and 15 weeks of age (4Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). By contrast, Irs2-/-::Pten+/- mice survived up to 1 year of age. At 3 months, Irs2-/-::Pten+/- mice weighed significantly more than Irs2-/- mice (p < 0.01), suggesting that decreased Pten prevented the pre-morbid weight loss characteristic of diabetic Irs2-/- mice (Fig. 1). Even by 6-8 months of age (when all the Irs2-/- mice were dead), the Irs2-/-::Pten+/- mice displayed a nearly normal body weight (Fig. 1). However, Irs2-/-::Pten+/- mice, like their Pten+/- littermates, succumbed to lymphoproliferative disease and renal failure around 12 months of age, which was attributed previously to the reduced levels of Pten (19Podsypanina K. Ellenson L.H. Nemes A. Gu J. Tamura M. Yamada K.M. Cordon-Cardo C. Catoretti G. Fisher P.E. Parsons R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1563-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 22Di Cristofano A. Pesce B. Cordon-Cardo C. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Glucose Homeostasis in Irs2-/-::Pten+/- Mice—Before Pten+/- or Irs2-/-::Pten+/- mice manifested evidence of lymphoproliferative disease and renal failure, we investigated the effect of reduced Pten expression on glucose homeostasis. At 3 months, Irs2-/- mice were hyperglycemic during fasting and random-fed conditions (Fig. 2, a and b). As expected, most of these mice died at 3 months of age, and none survived beyond 4 months. Consistent with previous reports, young and old Pten+/- mice displayed normal fasting and random-fed blood glucose values (Fig. 2, a and b). Remarkably, fasting and random-fed glucose levels were largely normalized in the vast majority of Irs2-/-::Pten+/- mice at 3 and 6-8 months of age (Fig. 2, a and b); only 3 of more than 30 Irs2-/-::Pten+/- mice generated for this study developed diabetes at 3 months. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests confirmed the significant improvement in the Irs2-/-::Pten+/- mice at 3 and 6-8 months of age (Fig. 2, c and d); however, the return to normal fasting glucose levels after 2 h was slightly retarded (Fig. 2, c and d). Thus, Pten haploinsufficiency cannot completely compensate for the absence of Irs2 in young and old mice, because the Pten+/- mice displayed normal glucose tolerance at both ages. Insulin Sensitivity in Irs2-/-::Pten+/- Mice—Insulin tolerance tests confirmed that Pten haploinsufficiency normalized the insulin sensitivity of Irs2-/- mice (Fig. 3a). Integration of the insulin response curves revealed a 2-fold increased hypoglycemic response in the Irs2-/-::Pten+/- mice compared with Irs2-/- mice (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3b). By comparison, wild type mice and Pten+/- mice displayed identical hypoglycemic responses to exogenous insulin (Fig. 3, a and b). Thus, Pten haploinsufficiency per se was insufficient to cause gross alterations in glucose homeostasis, although it restored the systemic insulin response in the Irs2-/- mice. Less insulin is required to maintain glucose homeostasis in Pten+/- mice. Consistent with this expectation, fasting and random-fed serum insulin levels were lower in the normal glycemic Pten+/- mice at 3 and 6-8 months of age (Fig. 3, c and d). Compared with the hypoinsulinemic Irs2-/- mice, circulating insulin was elevated in the young Irs2-/-::Pten+/- mice (Fig. 3, c and d). By 6-8 months of age, circulating insulin was about equal in Pten+/- and Irs2-/-::Pten+/- mice (Fig. 3, c and d). Thus, heterozygous Pten disruption prevented diabetes in Irs2-/- mice by reducing the insulin requirement while promoting insulin production needed to maintain normal glucose tolerance. β-Cell Signaling and Replication of Irs2-/-::Pten+/- Mice—The loss of functional β-cells is an important component in the progression of Irs2-/- mice to diabetes (23Hennige A.M. Burks D.J. Ozcan U. Kulkarni R.N. Ye J. Park S. Schubert M. Fisher T.L. Dow M.A. Leshan R. Zakaria M. Mossa-Basha M. White M.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1521-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Increased insulin sensitivity in the Irs2-/-::Pten+/- mice could not restore glucose homeostasis without also restoring β-cell function (21Kushner J.A. Ye J. Schubert M. Burks D.J. Dow M.A. Flint C.L. Dutta S. Wright C.V. Montminy M.R. White M.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1193-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 23Hennige A.M. Burks D.J. Ozcan U. Kulkarni R.N. Ye J. Park S. Schubert M. Fisher T.L. Dow M.A. Leshan R. Zakaria M. Mossa-Basha M. White M.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1521-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Previous results show that β-cell mass can be restored in Irs2-/- islets by reducing the activity of nuclear Foxo1, which is associated with enhanced Pdx1 expression (24Kitamura T. Nakae J. Kitamura Y. Kido Y. Biggs III, W.H. Wright C.V. White M.F. Arden K.C. Accili D. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). These results suggest that activating the Akt → Foxo1 cascade might restore β-cell function in the Irs2-/- islets. To determine whether Pten insufficiency promotes Akt and Foxo1 phosphorylation, we isolated islets from wild type, Irs2-/-, Pten+/-, or Irs2-/-::Pten+/- mice and analyzed the tissue extracts by immunoblotting (Fig. 4a). Akt phosphorylation (Ser473) increased about 3-fold in both Pten+/- and Irs2-/-::Pten+/- islets (Fig. 4b). Similarly, Foxo1 phosphorylation (Ser253) normalized against its protein level increased in these mice compared with the wild type and Irs2-/- mice (Fig. 4c). Moreover, compared with the wild type, Foxo1 protein level normalized against Akt protein level decreased in both Pten+/- and Irs2-/-::Pten+/- islets (Fig. 4d). This decrease is consistent with previous reports that Akt-mediated phosphorylation promotes degradation of Foxo1 (25Aoki M. Jiang H. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13613-13617Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 26Huang H. Regan K.M. Wang F. Wang D. Smith D.I. van Deursen J.M. Tindall D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1649-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). By this analysis, Pten insufficiency promotes the Akt3Foxo1 signaling and reduces Foxo1 activity in wild type and Irs2-/- islets. Because haploinsufficiency for Foxo1 promotes β-cell growth and function in Irs2-/- mice, we analyzed β-cell proliferation by measuring BrdUrd incorporation in the pancreas of 3-month-old mice (24Kitamura T. Nakae J. Kitamura Y. Kido Y. Biggs III, W.H. Wright C.V. White M.F. Arden K.C. Accili D. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Compared with the wild type mice, BrdUrd incorporation was decreased in Pten+/- mice (Fig. 4e). This result was consistent with reduced insulin requirements because of increased peripheral insulin sensitivity of the Pten+/- mice. By contrast, BrdUrd incorporation was barely detected in the severely insulin-resistant Irs2-/- mice, which was consistent with the progressive loss of β-cell function during the progression to diabetes (Fig. 4e). However, analysis of the Irs2-/-::Pten+/- mice revealed increased BrdUrd incorporation that was significantly greater than Irs2-/- islets and equal to that in Pten+/- islets; however, the BrdUrd incorporation was substantially less than that measured in wild type mice (Fig. 4e). Thus, Pten haploinsufficiency (and increased activity of the Akt → Foxo1 cascade) facilitated Irs2-/- islet growth without disrupting the regulation of β-cell expansion because of systemic insulin requirements. Islet Histology and β-Cell Growth—To confirm that Pten haploinsufficiency rescued islet function and growth, we compared pancreas histology in relevant Irs2+/-::Pten+/- intercross mice. Pten haploinsufficiency alone resulted in small but otherwise normal appearing islets (Fig. 5). Consistent with reduced insulin requirements, morphometric analysis confirmed that the total β-cell mass was decreased in Pten+/- mice by ∼50% at both → and 6-8 months of age (Fig. 6a). This decrease arose mainly from smaller islets of normal density (Fig. 6, b and c). Thus, increased Akt → Foxo1 signaling in the Pten+/- islets did not have a dominant effect on β-cell expansion in Pten+/- mice.FIGURE 6Islet morphometric analysis of Irs2+/-::Pten+/-intercross mice.a, mean cross-sectional β-cell area, reported as % of total pancreas area. b, islet size calculated by mean cross-sectional area of multicelled islets reported as microns ×103/islet. c, islet density calculated reported as islets per mm2.

By contrast, islets in Irs2-/-::Pten+/- mice were small but had a normal β-cell and α-cell organization and strong insulin immunostaining characteristic of wild type mice (Fig. 5). Except for the Irs2-/- mice that died, the β-cell area and islet size increased in all experimental groups between 3 and 6-8 months of age; the increase was greatest in the wild type mice, reduced by 50% in the Pten+/- mice, and the least in Irs2-/-::Pten+/- mice (Fig. 6, a and b). Although Pten haploinsufficiency alone did not reduce islet density, it failed to restore islet density to normal in the Irs2-/-::Pten+/- mice at 6-8 months (Fig. 6c). Regardless, sufficient β-cell function was obtained to prevent severe diabetes in most of the Irs2-/-::Pten+/- mice. We attribute the infrequent (<10% incidence) diabetes in Irs2-/-::Pten+/- mice to this compensatory β-cell expansion because of the increased Akt3Foxo1 signaling. We show that Pten haploinsufficiency in Irs2-/- mice (Irs2-/-::Pten+/-) restores sufficient β-cell growth and function to normalize glucose homeostasis and prevent diabetes. Despite many studies illustrating the importance of Irs2 → PI 3-kinase → Akt signaling for adult islet growth, little is known about the negative regulation of this pathway. Our results reveal that the Pten lipid phosphatase, which acts as a negative regulator of PI 3-kinase signals, inhibits the compensatory growth and function of β-cells in Irs2-/- mice. Although Pten haploinsufficiency is well known to reduce the life span of mice by 50% because of lymphoproliferative disease, it prolongs the life span of Irs2-/- mice by enhancing peripheral insulin sensitivity and promoting β-cell growth and function required for glucose tolerance (19Podsypanina K.

Science. 1999; 285: 2122-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Our results highlight the balance that needs to be achieved between cell growth and metabolism that is essential throughout life. In the wrong context, reduced PTEN function can facilitate the dysregulated growth of transformed cells to the detriment of the organism; Pten is one of the most frequently mutated genes in many forms of human cancer. However, the converse is not necessarily beneficial because Pten attenuates peripheral insulin action in normal mice and prevents compensatory β-cell expansion in Irs2-/- mice. Although these results highlight Pten as an interesting target for diabetes treatment, the side effects loom large, and whether safe PTEN inhibitors can ever be developed and targeted to the tissues of interest, i.e. liver, muscle, adipose, and β-cells, is an important question that deserves attention. Increased peripheral insulin sensitivity resulting from Pten haploinsufficiency was far greater in the absence of Irs2 than in wild type mice, suggesting that Pten potently antagonizes Irs2-related signals to promote peripheral insulin action. Previous work shows that Pten is a negative regulator of peripheral insulin action in liver, adipocytes, and muscle (12Stiles B. Wang Y. Stahl A. Bassilian S. Lee W.P. Kim Y.J. Sherwin R. Devaskar S.

Given that these same tissues are effected by disruption of Irs2, it seems likely that diminished hydrolysis of PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3, produced largely through Irs1 signaling in the Irs2-/- mice, plays an important role in the enhanced insulin sensitivity in Irs2-/-::Pten+/- mice. β-Cell dysfunction is a central component in the pathogenesis of human type 2 diabetes, with abnormal islet growth that is inadequate for the degree of peripheral insulin resistance (3Rhodes C.J. Science. 2005; 307: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 28Butler A.E. Janson J. Bonner-Weir S. Ritzel R. Rizza R.A. Butler P.C.

Lee I.K. Bonner-Weir S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 2300-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Indeed, our previous studies show that islet function is rate-limiting in the development of diabetes in Irs2-/- mice (16Lin X. Taguchi A. Park S. Kushner J.A. Li F. Li Y. White M.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 908-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 21Kushner J.A. Ye J. Schubert M. Burks D.J. Dow M.A. Flint C.L. Dutta S. Wright C.V. Montminy M.R. White M.F. J. Clin.

Diabetes. 2004; 53: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although mean β-cell area and islet size was equivalent in Irs2-/-::Pten+/- mice and Irs2-/- mice at 3 months, it was significantly increased in Irs2-/-::Pten+/- mice by 6-8 months. Rescue of β-cell area and islet size was associated with a significant increase in β-cell proliferation in Irs2-/-::Pten+/- mice compared with Irs2-/- mice at 3 months. Thus, our findings of improved peripheral insulin sensitivity, rescued islet growth, and sustained islet function in Irs2-/- mice with Pten haploinsufficiency reinforces the importance of PTEN in glucose homeostasis. Moreover, our results suggest that pharmaceutical strategies to selectively increase Irs2-related signaling in human diabetes could be beneficial. Whereas Pten haploinsufficiency promotes glucose homeostasis, negative regulation of PTEN might not be a viable strategy as a therapy for human type 2 diabetes. PTEN is a powerful negative regulator of cellular proliferation and one of the most frequently mutated genes in many forms of human cancer (8Li J. Yen C. Liaw D. Podsypanina K. Bose S. Wang S.I.

Although homozygous Pten disruption is embryonic lethal in mice, Pten+/- mice survive into adulthood but develop tumors of breast, prostate, lymphoid system, and other soft tissues, upon loss of heterozygosity of the remaining Pten allele in the cancerous tissue (19Podsypanina K. Ellenson L.H. Nemes A. Gu J. Tamura M. Yamada K.M. Cordon-Cardo C. Catoretti G. Fisher P.E. Parsons R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1999; 285: 2122-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Whereas our studies of Irs2-/-::Pten+/- mice illustrate that Pten is an important negative regulator of peripheral insulin sensitivity and islet growth and function, loss of Irs2 did not rescue the lethal lymphoproliferative disease that occurs with Pten haploinsufficiency (19Podsypanina K. Ellenson L.H. Nemes A. Gu J. Tamura M. Yamada K.M. Cordon-Cardo C. Catoretti G. Fisher P.E. Parsons R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1999; 285: 2122-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The tumor phenotypes observed in Irs2-/-::Pten+/- mice are complex, and careful analysis is required to determine whether Irs2 slows the progression of disease. This could be the case for mammary tumors, where Irs2 signaling was shown to play a role in metastasis (31Nagle J.A. Ma Z. Byrne M.A. White M.F. Shaw L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9726-9735Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The mechanisms governing replication of terminally differentiated β-cells and neogenesis from progenitor cells are unclear. Understanding these pathways is important because peripheral insulin resistance can be compensated by β-cell mass expansion to sustain glucose homeostasis. However, this normal response fails in systemic Irs2-/- mice suggesting that Irs2 signaling is important for β-cell replication. One way that insulin and IGF1 regulate gene expression is through Aktmediated phosphorylation of Foxo1 transcription factors (32Rena G. Guo S. Cichy S.C. Unterman T.G. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17179-17183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Reduced levels of Foxo1 (obtained genetically in Foxo1+/- mice) partially restores β-cell function in the Irs2-/- mice, which retards the progression to diabetes (24Kitamura T. Nakae J. Kitamura Y. Kido Y. Biggs III, W.H. Wright C.V. White M.F. Arden K.C. Accili D. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Pten haploinsufficiency increases the phosphorylation of Akt and Foxo1, which can reduce the accumulation of Foxo1 in the nucleus. It is important to understand how decreased nuclear Foxo1 signaling during Pten haploinsufficiency promotes β-cell function. Because Foxo1 and Pdx1 exhibit a mutually exclusive pattern of nuclear localization in β-cells, nuclear Pdx1 might be elevated in the Irs2-/-::Pten+/- islets (24Kitamura T. Nakae J. Kitamura Y. Kido Y. Biggs III, W.H. Wright C.V. White M.F. Arden K.C. Accili D. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In summary, we confirm that PTEN is a potent inhibitor of peripheral insulin sensitivity, and we show that it prevents compensatory β-cell growth needed to maintain glucose homeostasis in the Irs2-/- mice. Our results highlight the intimate molecular link between dysregulated cancerous growth that diminishes life span and β-cell growth that is essential for life-long glucose tolerance and longevity. Future studies that delineate the tumor forming properties of PTEN signaling from Irs2-related signals needed to regulate glucose homeostasis might reveal new strategies to prevent or cure diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2067035650,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), also known as vascular permeability factor (VPF), is a key mediator of angiogenesis for both physiological and pathological conditions. It is well established that the hypoxic induction of VPF/VEGF is in large part an increase in the stability of its mRNA. A Hu family ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein HuR has recently been shown to be important for VPF/VEGF mRNA stabilization. In renal cancer cells, the inactivation of the tumor suppressor protein von Hippel Lindau (VHL) leads to an increase in VPF/VEGF expression. VHL not only inhibits the transcription of VPF/VEGF but also plays a significant role in decreasing its mRNA stability. Here we delineate a possible mechanism by which VHL can control the function of HuR in order to regulate the stability of VPF/VEGF mRNA. The experiments presented here suggest that the association of the elongin-binding domain of VHL with a specific RNA-binding domain of HuR (RRM1) is important for the destabilizing function of VHL on VPF/VEGF mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2003429634,"After analysing gene-expression profiles of colon cancers on a cDNA microarray containing cDNAs corresponding to 23 040 human genes, we focused on a gene annotated as C10orf3 (chromosome 10 open reading frame 3), whose expression was elevated in colorectal cancers (CRC) as well as in tumors arising in the stomach, lung, pancreas, and breast. The gene encodes a putative 464-amino-acid protein containing a domain known as AAA (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities). Western blot analysis using an antibody to the gene product confirmed that the protein was overexpressed in nine of the 15 clinical cancer tissues examined, compared to corresponding noncancerous epithelial cells. A subsequent proteomics analysis revealed that C10orf3 product associated with the product of tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101), and that C10orf3 downregulated TSG101 in a post-transcriptional manner. Expression of short interfering RNA in cells derived from CRC caused significant decreases in C10orf3 expression and inhibited growth of the transfected cells, which was associated with increased apoptotic cells. These data suggest that elevated C10orf3 expression might play an essential role in the growth of cancer cells, and that suppression of C10orf3-mediated signal transduction may be a novel therapeutic strategy to a wide range of human tumors."

https://openalex.org/W1991853201,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) core has a pleiotropic effect on various promoters. In this study, we found that the expression of nucleolar phosphoprotein B23 was enhanced in HCV core-expressing cells and, moreover, HCV core interacts directly with the C-terminal end of B23. Using sucrose gradient centrifugation analysis and immunoprecipitation assays, HCV core was found in a large complex containing B23 and its interacting partner transcription factor YY1. Both B23 and HCV core associated with YY1 in the central GA/GK-rich and C-terminal zinc finger domain. These physical interactions between core, B23, and YY1 led to ternary complex formation that was bound to the YY1 response element. In a transient cotransfection experiment, relief of the trans-suppression activity of YY1 on the YY1-response element-driven reporter by core and B23 was found. This is also true when examining the effects of these three constructs on the B23 promoter-driven reporter. Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that a transcriptional activation complex consisting of core, together with B23, p300, and YY1, was recruited to the YY1 response element of B23 promoter, and this probably occurred through complex formation between core and these three cellular transcription regulators. This is different from the situation in the absence of core, where YY1 and histone deacetylase 1, but not B23 and p300, were associated on the YY1 element as the transcription repression complex. Together, our results indicate that HCV core can recruit B23 and p300 to relieve the repression effect of YY1 on B23 promoter activity, a property that requires the intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity of p300. Thus, because these three core-associated cellular transcription regulators have a multitude of cellular interacting proteins and are involved in a versatility of cellular processes, the complex formation described here may partially account for the pleiotropic effects of core protein on gene expression and cellular function in HCV-infected cells."

https://openalex.org/W1979693404,"The MSSE gene predisposes to multiple invasive but self-healing skin tumours (multiple self-healing epitheliomata). MSSE was previously mapped to chromosome 9q22-q31 and a shared haplotype in affected families suggested a founder mutation. We have refined the MSSE critical region (<1 cM, <1 Mb) between the zinc-finger gene ZNF169 and the Fanconi anaemia gene FANCC. By genetic mapping we have excluded ZNF169 and FANCC as well as PTCH (PATCHED) and TGFBR1 (transforming growth factor beta receptor type-1) genes. The CDC14B cell cycle phosphatase gene also lies in the region but screening of the complete coding region revealed no mutation in MSSE patients. Somatic cell hybrids created by haploid conversion of an MSSE patient's cells enabled screening of the MSSE chromosome 9 and showed no CDC14B deletion or mutation that abrogates CDC14B mRNA expression. Thus, CDC14B is unlikely to be the MSSE gene. We also report the first molecular analysis of MSSE tumours showing loss of heterozygosity of the MSSE region, with loss of the normal allele, providing the first evidence that MSSE is a tumour suppressor gene."
https://openalex.org/W2014398182,"The proto-oncogene c-myc is a central regulator of cellular proliferation and cell growth, which executes its multiple activities mostly through transcriptional regulation of its target genes. Although the role of c-myc in the activation of transcription is clearly established, the mechanisms of transcriptional repression by c-myc are not well understood. It has been proposed that c-myc represses gene transcription by at least two distinct mechanisms (Gartel and Shchors, 2003). One mechanism is limited to the binding of c-myc to the DNA-binding protein Miz-1, via its C-terminal domain, resulting in inhibition of Miz-1 transcriptional activity (Staller et al., 2001). The other mechanism is dependent on c-myc binding to the Sp1 transcription factor through its central region leading to inhibition of Sp1 transcriptional activity (Gartel et al., 2001). Interestingly, both Sp1 and Miz-1 bind to the proximal promoter of the p21 gene (Gartel et al., 2001; Seoane et al., 2002), which is a major target of Myc repression (Coller et al., 2000)."
https://openalex.org/W2046663022,"The activity of retinoid receptors activity can be regulated by various extracellular stimuli. In an effort to understand the molecular basis for this phenomenon, the role of beta-arrestins was investigated. Beta-Arrestins constitute a class of proteins involved in the internalization of agonist-activated receptors. They have also been linked to MAPK activation suggesting a direct involvement in signaling cascades. Here, we report that beta-arrestin 2 stimulates the transcriptional activation of the retinoid RAR and RXR receptors. Of all the retinoid receptors, the RAR beta2 subtype showed the strongest sensitivity to beta-arrestin 2 action. Interestingly, this event requires the presence of the MAP kinase ERK2, but not that of JNK or P38. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that Ser 22 and Leu 217 are critical residues of the RAR beta2 receptor through which beta-arrestin 2 effects are mediated. More importantly, we demonstrate that the induction of PC12 growth inhibition by Nerve Growth Factor is indeed dependent upon RAR beta2 transcriptional activation in a beta-arrestin 2- and ERK2-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2140782739,"Although it is known that growth factor signaling cascades are active during epithelial wound healing, signals that regulate reepithelialization after wounding are not very well characterized. The small GTP binding protein Ras is a molecular switch involved in the regulation of signals originating from different growth factor receptors. We have investigated consequences of its activation in primary human keratinocytes. We provide evidence that activation of Ras can lead to shape changes of keratinocytes caused by rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton that result in membrane protrusion and ruffling. Similar shape changes were found in the migrating tip of newly formed epithelium in mouse wounds. These cytoskeletal changes occur independently of keratinocyte terminal differentiation, and they can determine the speed of wound epithelialization in vitro. Using various mutant constructs and specific pharmacological inhibitors, we found that the effects of activated Ras on the cytoskeleton of keratinocytes are mediated by a phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase-independent activation of Rac. Our results suggest that growth factor-induced, Ras-mediated changes of keratinocyte shape may be an important mechanism that determines the speed of wound epithelialization."
https://openalex.org/W2082187698,"NKG2D is an important activating/co-stimulatory receptor harnessed by NK and T cells in immune surveillance. In contrast to NK cells, T cells fail to express the activation-signaling molecule DAP12 even when activated and, therefore, ligation of NKG2D alone is insufficient to induce T cell cytolytic function. To test whether we could endow T cells with NK cell-like effector function, we have engineered DAP12 into T cells by retroviral transduction (T-DAP12). T-DAP12 cells were demonstrated to specifically secrete interferon-γ following receptor ligation and to mediate potent and specific lysis of the NKG2D ligand (NKG2D-L) (Rae-1β) expressing MHC class I-deficient and class I-sufficient tumors. To circumvent the inability of T-DAP12 cells to proliferate following NKG2D ligation by Rae-1β expressing tumors, DAP12 was engineered into OT-1 cells with an endogenous T cell receptor specific for chicken ovalbumin peptide (amino acids 257–264). Importantly, following a period of proliferation through endogenous T cell receptor ligation, OT-1-DAP12 cells retained specificity against NKG2D-L expressing major histocompatibility complex class I-deficient tumor. In adoptive transfer experiments, T-DAP12 cells enhanced the survival of NK cell-depleted RAG-1-deficient mice inoculated with RMA-S-Rae-1β but not parental RMA-S tumors.

Overall, this study demonstrated the significant potential of suppressing tumors and other cellular targets expressing NKG2D-L by endowing T cells with innate NK cell-like function. NKG2D is an activating cell surface receptor expressed on a wide range of effector cells including NK, NKT, γδT, and CD8+ αβ T cells (1.Vivier E. Tomasello E. Paul P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 2.Diefenbach A. Tomasello E. Lucas M. Jamieson A.M. Hsia J.K. Vivier E. Raulet D.H. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). NKG2D recognizes several families of ligands expressed on interacting stressed, transformed, or pathogen-infected cells. These NKG2D ligands (NKG2D-Ls) 6The abbreviations used are: NKG2D-L, NKG2D ligand; IFN-γ, interferon γ; IL, interleukin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; OT-1-DAP12, OT-1 cells expressing DAP12; OT-1-α-MOV, OT-1 cells expressing scFv-anti-MOV-γ; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; pfp, perforin; scFv, single chain fragment of variable regions; TCR, T cell receptor; T-DAP12, T lymphocytes transduced with DAP12; T-α-erbB2, T lymphocytes transduced with scFv-anti-erbB2-CD28-ζ; WT, wild-type. are distantly related to MHC class I molecules, including the MHC class I chain-related proteins A and B (MICA and MICB) encoded in the human MHC, and a diverse family of proteins present in both mice and humans, including mouse Rae1 (retinoic acid early transcript 1), H60, Mult1 (murine UL16-binding protein-like transcript 1, and the human UL16-binding proteins or RAET1 proteins. The NKG2D ligands are generally expressed poorly by normal adult cells but are abundant in transformed epithelial cells and thus represent a potentially effective tumor-associated antigen (3.Raulet D.H. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar, 4.Diefenbach A. Jensen E.R. Jamieson A.M. Raulet D.H. Nature. 2001; 413: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Like many leukocyte activating receptors, NKG2D only signals when co-expressed and associated non-covalently with membrane-bound signaling adaptor proteins. Two adaptor proteins known to associate with NKG2D are DAP10 and DAP12 (5.Wu J. Cherwinski H. Spies T. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 6.Wilson M.J. Lindquist J.A. Trowsdale J. Immunol. Res. 2000; 22: 21-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 7.Wu J. Song Y. Bakker A.B. Bauer S. Spies T. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. Science. 1999; 285: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). NKG2D is known to confer either co-stimulatory or activatory signals in different lymphocyte subsets depending upon the expression of two NKG2D protein species encoded by distinct mRNA splice isoforms and the differential expression of the DAP10 and DAP12 adaptor proteins (2.Diefenbach A. Tomasello E. Lucas M. Jamieson A.M. Hsia J.K. Vivier E. Raulet D.H. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The long isoform of NKG2D, NKG2D-L, associates only with DAP10, and ligation of this receptor complex is thought to provide co-stimulatory function because of the presence of an YXXM motif, which delivers signals by activation of a lipid kinase pathway (5.Wu J. Cherwinski H. Spies T. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 8.Billadeau D.D. Upshaw J.L. Schoon R.A. Dick C.J. Leibson P.J. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 557-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). By contrast, the short isoform of NKG2D, NKG2D-S, may associate with either DAP10 or DAP12. Ligation of the NKG2D-S/DAP12 complex directly activates cytokine production and cytotoxicity, because DAP12 contains intracytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs that activate the Syk-family protein tyrosine kinases (5.Wu J. Cherwinski H. Spies T. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Both isoforms of NKG2D are present in activated NK cells and CD8+ T cells, but T cells do not express DAP12 (2.Diefenbach A. Tomasello E. Lucas M. Jamieson A.M. Hsia J.K. Vivier E. Raulet D.H. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Hence, in conventional TCRαβ CD8+ T cells NKG2D-DAP10 provides a co-stimulatory signal in combination with TCR triggering, whereas NKG2D ligation may result in the direct activation of NK cells. Notably, NKG2D only provides a costimulatory signal to CD8+ T cells under restricted conditions (9.Ehrlich L.I. Ogasawara K. Hamerman J.A. Takaki R. Zingoni A. Allison J.P. Lanier L.L. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1922-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). CD8+αβ T cells are activated and proliferate through interaction of their endogenously rearranged TCR with the variety of MHC I-peptide complexes displayed on target cells (host, infected, or tumor cells). T cells possess a powerful ability to proliferate strongly in response to antigens when compared with NK cells whose proliferation is mostly cytokine-driven (10.Smyth M.J. Cretney E. Kershaw M.H. Hayakawa Y. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 202: 275-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). T cells are optimally activated by the provision of signal 1 from the TCR and signal 2 from co-stimulatory molecules (11.Greenfield E.A. Nguyen K.A. Kuchroo V.K. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 18: 389-418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tumors rarely express co-stimulatory molecules such as CD80/CD86, and few conventional T cells specific for tumor antigen can generally be found infiltrating the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, although tumors may often express NKG2D ligands, most T cells even when engaged fail to express DAP12 and, therefore, ligation of NKG2D alone is insufficient to stimulate T cell proliferation or effector function in response to tumor. We rationalized that such activated T cells might be able to respond directly to tumors by NKG2D ligation if they additionally expressed the DAP12 adaptor protein. Herein, we have demonstrated that genetic engineering of T cells with DAP12 enabled NKG2D-dependent recognition and effector function against tumor cells independently of the TCR or tumor MHC class I expression. The bi-potential of such DAP12 engineered T cells was evidenced by their ability to retain NKG2D ligand specificity following TCR-mediated expansion. Furthermore, these DAP12-expressing T cells mediated significant enhanced survival of mice inoculated with MHC class I-deficient tumors expressing NKG2D-L. Mice—Inbred wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 (B6) and B6 OT-I mice were purchased from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research (Melbourne, Australia). B6 RAG-1–/– mice were purchased from the Animal Resources Centre (Perth, Australia). B6 perforin-deficient (B6 pfp–/–) and B6 gld (FasL mutant) mice were bred at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (East Melbourne, Australia). Mice that were 8–12 weeks of age were used in all experiments, which were performed according to Animal Experimental Ethics Committee guidelines.

Transduction of mouse splenic T lymphocytes was performed using GP+E86 clones producing ∼107 colony-forming units/ml of retrovirus. Prior to transduction, spleen cells from B6 mice were depleted of red blood cells by hypotonic lysis with NH4Cl and enriched using a nylon wool syringe as described (14.Haynes N.M. Trapani J.A.

Enriched mouse T cells (107) were then co-cultivated with 6 × 105 virus-producing packaging cells in supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 72 h together with 4 μg ml Polybrene, 5 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin (Sigma), and 100 units/ml rat IL-2 (Chiron, Emeryville, CA). After co-cultivation, transduction efficiency of mouse T cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. Flow Cytometry—Mouse T lymphocytes were stained for DAP12 or scFv chimeric receptor expression with a primary anti-c-Myc tag antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) or isotype control (BD Biosciences) followed by staining with a PE-labeled goat anti-mouse Ig monoclonal antibody (mAb) (BD Biosciences). NKG2D expression on transduced T cells was analyzed by staining with a PE anti-mouse NKG2D mAb (clone CX5) (eBiosciences, San Diego, CA). Expansion of OT-1 T Cells Expressing DAP12—Following red blood cell depletion, 1.2 × 107 C57BL/6 splenocytes were resuspended in 1 ml of RPMI medium with the added SIINFEKL peptide (1 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min and then washed and irradiated (3000 rads). Following irradiation, peptide-pulsed splenocytes (2 × 106/well) were co-cultured with engineered mouse T lymphocytes (5 × 105/well) in a 24-well plate in complete RPMI 1640 media. Cells were supplemented every other day with IL-2 (50 units/ml) and were subsequently used in in vitro assays 6–8 days after peptide stimulation. Cytotoxicity and Cytokine Production Assays—The cytolytic capacity of transduced T cells was assessed in either a 4- or 16-h 51Cr release assay as described previously (17.Darcy P.K. Kershaw M.H.

The ability of DAP12-modified mouse T cells to secrete cytokine was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (BD-Pharmingen). Briefly, gene-modified mouse T lymphocytes (4 × 105) transduced with DAP12 (T-DAP12) or scFv-anti-erbB2-CD28-ζ chimeric receptor (T-α-erbB2) were co-cultured with RMA-S or RMA-S-Rae1β (2 × 105) tumor cells or plate-bound anti-c-Myc mAb (1 μg/ml) in 48-well plates for 20 h. No exogenous IL-2 was added. Following incubation, supernatants were harvested, and T cell-secreted IFN-γ was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (BD-Pharmingen) according to the supplier's specifications. Cytokine production through stimulation of endogenous CD3 and CD28 receptors was assessed for each T cell effector population using plate-bound CD3 (1 μg/ml) (145.2C11; BD Pharmingen) and CD28 (1 μg/ml) (37.51; BD Pharmingen) mAbs. Proliferation Assays—Gene-engineered mouse T lymphocytes (105 cells/well) were cultured in 96-well flat bottom plates with irradiated RMA-S-Rae1β, media alone, plate-bound anti-c-Myc mAb (1 μg/ml), or plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAb (1 μg/ml) for 3 days. No exogenous IL-2 was added. The cultures were pulsed with 0.5 μCi/well (0.0185 MBq) of [3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) for the final 16 h of the culture period, and the incorporation of radioactivity was measured in a TRI-CARD 2100 TR liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Adoptive Transfer Models—Groups of B6 RAG-1–/– mice were injected intraperitoneally with 2 × 105 RMA-S-Rae1β or RMA-S tumor cells. Three hours following tumor inoculation, B6-RAG-1–/– mice were injected intraperitoneally with 2 × 106 B6 T-DAP12 or T-α-erbB2 cells. In some groups of mice, NK cells were depleted by injection with anti-NK1.1 mAb (100 μg, intraperitoneally) (20.Smyth M.J. Johnstone R.W. Cretney E. Haynes N.M. Sedgwick J.D. Korner H. Poulton L.D.

Statistical Analysis—Fisher's exact test was used for statistical analysis of data. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. The expression of DAP12 in primary mouse T cells was achieved by retroviral transduction. Using a mAb specific for the c-Myc tag that was incorporated into the transgene, high level expression of both DAP12 (T-DAP12) (Fig. 1A) and the control scFv receptor T-α-erbB2 (Fig. 1B) were reproducibly detected in T cells. The transduced T cell populations consisted of a high proportion of CD8+ T cells (80–85%) and a low number of CD4+ T cells (10–15%) as reported previously (14.Haynes N.M. Trapani J.A. Teng M.W.

Importantly, equivalent expression of the NKG2D receptor was detected on both T-DAP12 (Fig. 1C) and T-α-erbB2 cells (Fig. 1D) following retroviral transduction. It has been previously reported (13.Diefenbach A. Jamieson A.M. Liu S.D. Shastri N. Raulet D.H. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 22.Gilfillan S. Ho E.L.

To determine whether ligation of NKG2D-DAP12 conferred a similar cytotoxic function on our retrovirus-transduced T cells, we assessed the ability of T-DAP12 cells to specifically kill an MHC class I-sufficient RMA-Rae1β tumor (Fig. 2A) and a MHC class I-deficient RMA-S-Rae1β tumor (Fig. 2B) targets in a 16 h 51Cr assay. T-DAP12 cells demonstrated significant and specific cytotoxicity of both RMA-Rae-1β and RMA-S-Rae-1β tumor cells, but not parental NKG2D-L negative RMA or RMA-S tumor cells (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, similarly activated and transduced control T-α-erbB2 cells mediated only background cytotoxicity of all tumor targets (Fig. 2, A and B). Specificity was maintained even at much higher effector/target ratios (e.g. 40:1). Similar experiments using a 4-h assay yielded weaker levels of specific cytotoxicity by T-DAP-12 cells (data not shown). Because T-DAP12 effector cells required a long incubation period to mediate optimal cytotoxicity, we first pre-activated these cells using plate-bound c-Myc tag mAb in an overnight culture before examining their cytotoxic function in a 4-h 51Cr assay. Under these conditions, pre-activated T-DAP12 cells mediated even greater and more rapid cytotoxicity of both RMA-Rae-1β and RMA-S-Rae-1β tumors, but not RMA or RMA-S parental tumors (Fig. 2, C and D). As demonstrated previously, pre-activated T-α-erbB2 cells exhibited no cytotoxicity of Rae-1β expressing tumor targets (data not shown). T-DAP12 cells were also demonstrated to specifically kill the highly metastatic B16-Rae-1β tumor, but not B16 parental tumor cells (data not shown). To investigate whether the mechanism of cytotoxicity employed by our engineered T-DAP12 cells was mediated via perforin, cytotoxicity assays were carried out using either perforin-deficient pfp–/– T-DAP12 effector cells or WT T-DAP12 cells in the presence of EGTA. The use of pfp–/– T-DAP12 effector cells or the blockade of Ca2+ by EGTA resulted in complete abrogation of RMA-Rae-1β and RMA-S-Rae-1β tumor cell cytotoxicity, suggesting that T-DAP12 cells were rapidly killing targets in a perforin-dependent manner (Fig. 2, C and D). To investigate whether the FasL/Fas pathway was also playing a role, we performed another 16-h cytotoxicity assay using FasL-sensitive, MHC class I-sufficient Lewis lung carcinoma 3LL cells as a tumor target. Wild-type T-DAP12 cells specifically killed 3LL tumor cells, but this tumor target was insensitive to death mediated by pfp–/– T-DAP12 cells, suggesting that the FasL/Fas pathway was not involved (Fig. 2E). These data were further supported by the WT levels of cytotoxicity of FasL mutant gld-derived T-DAP-12 cells against 3LL tumor targets (data not shown). As an additional control for NKG2D specificity, an anti-NKG2D blocking antibody (C7), but not a control hamster Ig (data not shown), abolished T-DAP12-specific killing of RMA-Rae-1β and RMA-S-Rae-1β tumor targets (Fig. 2, C–E). Collectively these results demonstrated that primary mouse T cells genetically engineered with DAP12 were able to mediate specific perforin-dependent killing of tumor cells through an NKG2D-NKG2D-L interaction. The complete absence of cytotoxicity in the absence of the NKG2D-NKG2D-L pathway suggested that DAP12 association with any other receptors (e.g. Ig-like) was of no functional consequence in this assay. Given that T-DAP12 cells mediated specific lysis of NKG2D-L-expressing tumor cells, we were further interested in determining what other effector functions DAP12 might trigger in mouse T cells after NKG2D ligation alone. NK cells are reported to secrete IFN-γ after NKG2D ligation (13.Diefenbach A. Jamieson A.M. Liu S.D. Shastri N. Raulet D.H. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Hence, we examined the ability of T-DAP12 cells to secrete cytokines upon NKG2D-L interaction or cross-linking with a plate-bound c-Myc tag mAb. T-DAP12 cells demonstrated a specific low level production of IFN-γ following co-culture with RMA-S-Rae-1β tumor cells, but not parental RMA-S cells (Fig. 3A). By contrast, control T-α-erbB2 cells did not produce IFN-γ when incubated with RMA-S-Rae-1β tumor cells. Interestingly, cross-linking by plate-bound c-Myc tag mAb triggered optimal T cell IFN-γ production from both T-α-erbB2 and T-DAP12 cells that expressed surface receptors containing c-Myc tag epitope (Fig. 3A). This result is consistent with other reports that have demonstrated greater cytokine release by gene-engineered T cells following stimulation with an immobilized antibody as compared with antigen-specific activation by tumor cells (25.Hombach A. Wieczarkowiecz A. Marquardt T. Heuser C. Usai L. Pohl C. Seliger B. Abken H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6123-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The ability of T-DAP12 cells to proliferate was examined in a 3-day [3H]thymidine assay following stimulation with immobilized c-Myc tag mAb or irradiated RMA-S-Rae-1β tumor cells. T-DAP12 cells demonstrated strong proliferation following cross-linking by plate-bound c-Myc tag mAb but, interestingly, not against RMA-S-Rae-1β or RMA-S parental tumor cells (Fig. 3B). Similarly, T-α-erbB2 control T cells demonstrated comparatively strong proliferation following stimulation through plate-bound c-Myc tag mAb, but not following co-culture with RMA-S-Rae-1β or RMA-S parental cells. The effect of c-Myc tag ligation in stimulating CD8+ T cell IFN-γ production and proliferation was in concert with an earlier report of DAP12 transgenic mouse CD8+ T cells producing IFN-γ and proliferating in response to ligation with plate-bound anti-NKG2D mAb (2.Diefenbach A. Tomasello E. Lucas M. Jamieson A.M. Hsia J.K. Vivier E. Raulet D.H. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Thus DAP12 can endow CD8+ T cells with the ability to kill, produce IFN-γ, and proliferate directly in response to NKG2D ligation. However our data extend these findings by illustrating that when the NKG2D-L is expressed in the context of a tumor cell, IFN-γ production and, even more strikingly, the proliferation mediated via NKG2D are abrogated. We have observed that RMA/RMA-S and other tumor cell lines secrete factors that inhibit T cell proliferation, and, indeed, supernatants from RMA-S-Rae-1β cells were capable of inhibiting proliferation following direct DAP12 activation via a c-Myc tag (data not shown). Collectively, it appeared that Rae-1β expressed by MHC class I-deficient tumor cells was more effective in triggering cytotoxicity than either IFN-γ production or proliferation. Because T-DAP12 cells did not proliferate effectively against RMA-S-Rae-1β tumor cells, it was important to establish whether such tumor-specific effector cells could be expanded via conventional TCR ligation and, perhaps, distant from the tumor site. To test this approach, we engineered T cells from OT-1 TCR (reactive with the ovalbumin peptide, amino acids 257–264) transgenic mice with DAP12 using the same transduction procedure demonstrated earlier for T cells from B6 mice. Importantly, the expression of both DAP12 and NKG2D in OT-I T cells was comparable with that in similarly engineered WT B6 T cells (data not shown). Following retroviral transduction, the cytotoxic function of OT-1 cells expressing DAP12 (OT-1-DAP12) or control scFv-α-MOV-γ chimeric receptor (OT-1-α-MOV) was tested in a 16-h 51Cr assay. Similar to B6 WT T-DAP12 cells, OT-I-DAP12 cells specifically killed RMA-S-Rae-1β, but not RMA-S, tumor cells (Fig. 4A). Only background cytotoxicity was observed with control OT-1-α-MOV cells against RMA-S or RMA-S-Rae-1β tumor targets (Fig. 4A). We next assessed whether OT-1-DAP12 cells could maintain DAP12 expression (through the detection of c-Myc tag epitope) as well as the specific killing of NKG2D-L expressing tumor cells following a 6-day expansion period with irradiated ovalbumin (257SIINFEKL264)-pulsed splenocytes. Transduced OT-1-DAP12 or OT-1-α-MOV cells labeled with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester were found to have undergone at least five rounds of cell division (data not shown). After a period of expansion, stimulated OT-1-DAP12 cells retained their ability to specifically kill RMA-S-Rae-1β targets and SIINFEKL-pulsed RMA-S targets, but not unpulsed RMA-S target cells (Fig. 4B). However, stimulated OT-1-α-MOV cells demonstrated only specific lysis of SIINFEKL-pulsed RMA-S targets, but not RMA-S or RMA-S-Rae-1β tumor cells (Fig. 4C). These results demonstrated that DAP12-engineered OT-1-T cells maintained DAP12 expression and specific lysis of NKG2D-L-expressing tumor cells even following expansion via their specific TCR. The strong effector function exhibited by T-DAP12 cells against NKG2D-L-expressing tumors in vitro encouraged us to examine their anti-tumor potential in vivo. We have previously shown that RMA-S-Rae-1β tumor cells are exclusively rejected by NK cells and that growth of this tumor is equivalent between B6 WT and B6 RAG-1–/– mice (26.Hayakawa Y. Kelly J.M. Westwood J.A. Darcy P.K. Diefenbach A. Raulet D. Smyth M.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5377-5381Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Therefore we examined the intraperitoneal ascites growth of RMA-S and RMA-S-Rae-1β tumors in B6-RAG-1–/– mice that were additionally depleted of NK cells. Mice were given a lethal dose of RMA-S-Rae-1β tumor (2 × 105 cells) and then received either T-DAP12 or T-α-erbB2 effector cells (2 × 106 cells) intraperitoneally 3 h later. Mice treated with T-DAP12 cells had a greatly enhanced survival rate (10 of 21) as compared with a similar group of untreated (0 of 15) or T-α-erbB2-treated (0 of 15) mice additionally receiving anti-NK1.1 mAb (p = 0.0018). This level of survival compared favorably with the intact host NK cell response observed in RAG-1–/– mice that were not depleted of NK1.1+ cells (8 of 15 survived) (Fig. 5). Mice that were treated with control T-α-erbB2 cells survived no longer than untreated mice. This anti-tumor response of T-DAP12 cells was specific, because NK cell-depleted RAG-1–/– mice injected with parental RMA-S tumors and treated with T-DAP12 succumbed to RMA-S in a similar manner to that of control mice. An additional group of mice receiving T-DAP12 cells 3 days after the RMA-S-Rae-1β tumor challenge displayed virtually no improvement in survival (Fig. 5). Future experiments will be required to accurately determine the strength of T-DAP12-mediated tumor rejection in comparison with the host response and to evaluate whether therapy can be improved by expanding and mobilizing T-DAP12 cells. Nevertheless, the bispecificity (TCR-MHC and NKG2D-NKG2D-L) and potency of this T-DAP12 effector cell shows early promise in vivo. NKG2D ligands (NKG2D-L) are generally expressed only on stressed or transformed cells, which makes them a new and attractive tumor-associated antigen. Although, T cells have potent effector functions, they cannot be directly activated by interaction with NKG2D ligand alone because of their lack of the activatory signaling protein DAP12. In this study, we have retrovirally gene-engineered DAP12 into primary mouse T cells and have shown that such T-DAP12 effector cells specifically kill tumor targets in an NKG2D-L- and perforin-dependent manner. Whereas proliferation of such T-DAP12 cells was restricted in response to the NKG2D-L presented by tumor cells, TCR transgenic T-DAP12 effectors could be expanded through their specific TCR without loss of DAP12 expression or NKG2D-L specificity. Furthermore, T cell- and NK cell-deficient mice challenged with NKG2D-L-expressing tumors demonstrated enhanced survival following adoptive transfer of T-DAP12 cells. Collectively, these experiments demonstrate the principle that DAP12-engineered T cells, like naturally occurring NK cells, can respond to a single signal mediated by NKG2D ligation. Their tight specificity of action and ability to respond concomitantly via their TCR offer the possibility of expanding T cells capable of innate anti-tumor activity in vivo. Our data are in concert with a previous report (2.Diefenbach A. Tomasello E. Lucas M. Jamieson A.M. Hsia J.K. Vivier E. Raulet D.H. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) that demonstrated that DAP12 transgenic CD8+ T cells could respond directly via NKG2D to produce IFN-γ production and proliferate. However, we also demonstrated that tumors expressing NKG2D-L could suppress the proliferation, but not cytotoxicity, of responding T-DAP12 cells. The lack of proliferation of T-DAP12 cells following NKG2D-L interaction could explain the failure of T-DAP12 cells to cure all mice (Fig. 5) and the only minor prolongation in survival when T-DAP12 effector cells were administered 3 days after tumor inoculation. However, T-DAP12 cells were able to significantly enhance the survival of RAG1–/– mice challenged with RMA-S-Rae-1β tumors as compared with mice treated with control T cells or those that had received no T cell transfer. We consider this effect impressive, given that it was as protective as the natural host NK cell response and considering that the host contains many more than 2 million NK cells that can potentially respond to the tumor. To improve the anti-tumor efficacy of T-DAP12 cells and circumvent the inability of these cells to proliferate following interaction with NKG2D-L on tumor cells, we tested the idea of engineering DAP12 into T cells with a known TCR specificity. Encouragingly, DAP12 expression could still be detected (using c-Myc mAb) on transgenic OT-1-DAP12 T cells expanded for 6 days via their endogenous TCR (data not shown) while being able to specifically kill NKG2D-L-expressing tumor targets. An analogous situation in humans might be the genetic engineering and expansion of allo-specific, Epstein-Barr virus-specific, or human cytomegalovirus-specific T cells by immunization. Thus, dual specific T-DAP12 cells could potentially prove to be efficient in the eradication of NKG2D-L tumors if they can be expanded in vivo by immunization that triggers their TCR at a distance from the tumor sites. Future experiments will now involve extensively testing the anti-tumor efficacy of OT-1-DAP12 T cells in RMA-S-Rae-1β-challenged mice following immunization with the ovalbumin peptide. It will also be important to test this approach in mice with an intact immune system where the natural host response to tumors expressing NKG2D-L is ineffective. Although we and others have genetically engineered DAP12 in mouse T cells, it is quite possible that some subsets of mouse T cells with “innate” activity may naturally exist or that DAP12 may under certain microenvironmental conditions be induced in T cell subpopulations. Good examples are two recent reports by Dhanji et al. (27.Dhanji S. Teh H.-S. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3442-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 28.Dhanji S. Teh S.-J. Oble D. Priatel J.J. Teh H.-S. Blood. 2004; 104: 2116-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) describing the existence of a subset of CD8+ T cells that are characterized by high expression levels of CD44 in normal C57BL/6 mice (27.Dhanji S. Teh H.-S. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3442-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 28.Dhanji S. Teh S.-J. Oble D. Priatel J.J. Teh H.-S. Blood. 2004; 104: 2116-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These CD8+CD44hi cells could be directly activated following a period of culture in high dose IL-2 compared with conventional CD8+CD44lo T cells. Activated CD8+CD44hi cells demonstrated a preference in the killing of syngeneic tumor cells, and this killing of syngeneic tumor cells was greatly enhanced by the expression of NKG2D ligands on the target cell. Interestingly, the authors found that activated CD8+CD44hi cells expressed both DAP12 and DAP10 mRNA transcripts unlike the activated CD8+CD44lo T cells that only expressed DAP10, making CD8+CD44hi cells similar to NK cells in this regard. In concert, we showed that the DAP12 gene-transduced CD8+TCRαβ+ T cells were able to mediate specific killing of NKG2D-L-expressing tumors and respond additively to signals via the TCR and NKG2D in IFN-γ production assays (data not shown). However, our experiments illustrate that conventional CD8+ T cells can also acquire similar functions as those of NK cells when transduced with DAP12, further suggesting that DAP12 was the critical adaptor molecule for conferring innate effector function. The existence of CD8+CD44hi cells in normal mice has also been documented by others (29.Yamada H. Matsuzaki G. Chen Q. Iwamoto Y. Nomoto K. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1917-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and these cells may be an early source of IFN-γ in innate immune responses (30.Kambayashi T. Assarsson E. Lukacher A.E. Ljunggren H.G. Jensen P.E. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 2399-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The potential role of DAP12 in γδ+T cells and additional populations of T cells with non-MHC related activities deserves further attention. A recent elegant report (31.Rosen D.B. Araki M. Hamerman J.A. Chen T. Yamamura T. Lanier L.L. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 2470-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) described the inability of human DAP12 to interact with human NKG2D and showed that human DAP10 was sufficient for human NKG2D signal transduction. Structural differences in the transmembrane of mouse and human NKG2D account for the species-specific difference for this immune receptor. Nevertheless, genetic engineering strategies that enable human NKG2D to associate with a chimeric form of human DAP12 should allow our approach of endowing human T cells with NK cell-like function. For example, the chimeric human DAP12 may consist of the extracellular and transmembrane domain of human DAP10 linked to the cytoplasmic domain of human DAP12. CD4+CD28null T cells express the killer inhibitory receptor KIR2DS2 that may associate with DAP12, and the expression of DAP12 is sufficient to convert a co-stimulatory KIR into a stimulatory molecule (32.Snyder M.R. Muegge L.O. Offord C. O'Fallon W.M. Bajzer Z. Weyand C.M. Goronzy J.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3839-3846Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, a model where DAP12 endows T cells with innate activities may also be a common mode of action for specialized T cell subsets in humans. In summary, our ability to confer NK cell function in T cells by expression of the activation adaptor molecule DAP12 may potentially broaden the applicability of gene-engineered T cells as an immunotherapy for cancer and infectious diseases where transformed or stressed cells express NKG2D ligands.
