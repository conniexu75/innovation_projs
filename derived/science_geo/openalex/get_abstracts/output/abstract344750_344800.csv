Three-fourths of the variation in percentage of enlisted military personnel who take the foods at the serving table is predictable from knowledge of food preferences, the subjective satiety or ""fillingness"" of the food, and the amount of two major nutrients, fat and protein, the food contains."

This method is rapid and does not impair viability. Individual kernels from a selfed single-cross ear ranged from 2.7 to 5.4 percent oil and were significantly correlated (r = +0.75) with the oil content of their progeny ears. This indicates that the single-kernel differences in oil content were heritable, and this method may greatly increase selection efficiency in breeding for higher oil content in corn."

https://openalex.org/W2014440247,A 0.39-g sample of xenon tetrafluoride dissolved in 1.5 ml of distilled water reacted vigorously and left a white solid. The solid detonated when warmed under vacuum above 30 or 40 deg C and completely shattered the enclosing vessel. (P.C.H.)

https://openalex.org/W2064858543,"Crystalline aggregates of strain MM virus occur in polymorphonuclear leukocytes in association with osmiophilic granular structures which are occasionally membrane-bound. This suggests either a phagocytosis and segregation of virus by leukocytes, analogous to the disposition of bacteria by leukocytes, or a utilization of the leukocyte by the virus as a host cell for virus replication."

https://openalex.org/W2008128850,"IN a recent letter (NATURE, April 18), I ventured to counsel chemists to go back to the land—to study Faraday. Since then, in the Times (May 16), I have urged that Faraday's great discovery of benzene, one hundred years ago, should henceforth be commemorated on June 16, the day on which it was communicated to the Royal Society of London. Surely we should make this a saint's day in our chemical calendar. The public has its Saint Lubbock's days, for the mere purpose of resting from its labours—in days when labour is beginning to be regarded as a work of supererogation. Why not a chemists' rest-day for the purpose of contemplation: to give emphasis to our recognition of the importance of Faraday's discovery and its astounding consequences: more particularly, as an outward and visible sign of our belief in the method we wield in our search for truth?"
