https://openalex.org/W1676701054,"A simple enzymatic method for the quantitation of the mass of sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) present in crude lipid extracts was developed to assess the function of DAGs as intracellular second messengers of extracellular agents and of oncogene products. The assay employed Escherichia coli DAG kinase which constituted approximately 15% of the membrane protein of a plasmid-bearing strain and defined mixed micellar conditions to solubilize the DAG present and allow its quantitative conversion to [32P]phosphatidic acid. The assay was proportional with the amount of DAG added over the range of 25 pmol to 25 nmol. The rapid rise of DAG in platelets stimulated with thrombin (210% over basal) and in hepatocytes stimulated with vasopressin (230% over basal) was quantitated and the values agreed with previous measurements. The amounts of DAG in normal rat kidney (NRK) cells grown at 34 and 38 degrees C, respectively, were 0.47 and 0.61 nmol/100 nmol of phospholipid. In K-ras-transformed NRK cells grown at 34 or 38 degrees C, DAG levels were elevated 168 or 138%, respectively. When a temperature-sensitive K-ras NRK cell line was investigated, the amount of DAG present was elevated at the permissive but not at the restrictive temperature. These data are consistent with the K-ras protein functioning in transmembrane signalling by activating phospholipase C. Protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) activation by DAG may play an important role in cellular transformation."

https://openalex.org/W1502690419,"Insulin stimulates the accumulation of iron by isolated fat cells by increasing the uptake of diferric transferrin. Analysis of the cell-surface binding of diferric 125I-transferrin indicated that insulin caused a 3-fold increase in the cell surface number of transferrin receptors. This result was confirmed by the demonstration that insulin increases the binding of an anti-rat transferrin receptor monoclonal antibody (OX-26) to the surface of fat cells. The basis of this effect of insulin was examined by investigating the number of transferrin receptors in membrane fractions isolated from disrupted fat cells. Two methods were employed. First the binding isotherm of diferric 125I-transferrin to the isolated membranes was studied. Second, the membranes were solubilized with detergent, and the number of transferrin receptors was measured by immunoblotting using the monoclonal antibody OX-26. It was observed that insulin treatment of intact fat cells resulted in an increase in the number of transferrin receptors located in the isolated plasma membrane fraction of the disrupted fat cells. Furthermore, the increase in the number of plasma membrane transferrin receptors was associated with a concomitant decrease in the transferrin receptor number in a low density microsome fraction previously shown to consist of intracellular membranes. This redistribution of transferrin receptors between cellular membrane fractions in response to insulin is remarkably similar to the regulation by insulin of glucose transporters and type II insulin-like growth factor receptors. We conclude that insulin stimulates fat cell iron uptake by a mechanism that may involve the redistribution of transferrin receptors from an internal membrane compartment (low density microsomes) to the cell surface (plasma membrane)."
https://openalex.org/W1586919088,"Hemolytic viruses, bacterial and animal toxins, the components of activated complement, cationic proteins, and detergents induce a sequence of permeability changes at the plasma membrane that are in every case sensitive to changes in ionic strength and to divalent cations. Individually, each agent exhibits positive cooperativity; when two agents are present together, they show synergy. It is concluded that such cytotoxic agents damage membranes by a common mechanism. Hence permeability changes are unlikely to depend on the formation of specific, protein-lined channels, as previously envisaged in the case of activated complement or certain bacterial toxins."

https://openalex.org/W2161011069,"Recent studies suggest that the major pathway for exit of HCO3- across the basolateral membrane of the proximal tubule cell is electrogenic Na+/HCO3- co-transport. We therefore evaluated the possible presence of Na+/HCO3- co-transport in basolateral membrane vesicles isolated from the rabbit renal cortex. Imposing an inward HCO3- gradient induced the transient uphill accumulation of Na+, and imposing an outward Na+ gradient caused HCO3- -dependent generation of an inside-acid pH gradient as monitored by quenching of acridine orange fluorescence, findings consistent with the presence of Na+/HCO3- co-transport. In the absence of other driving forces, generating an inside-positive membrane potential by imposing an inward K+ gradient in the presence of valinomycin caused net Na+ uptake via a HCO3- -dependent pathway, indicating that Na+/HCO3- co-transport is electrogenic and associated with a flow of negative charge. Imposing transmembrane Cl- gradients did not appreciably affect HCO3- gradient-stimulated Na+ influx, suggesting that Na+/HCO3- co-transport is not Cl- -dependent. The rate of HCO3- gradient-stimulated Na+ influx was a simple, saturable function of the Na+ concentration (Km = 9.7 mM, Vmax = 160 nmol/min/mg of protein), was inhibited by 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (I50 = 100 microM), but was inhibited less than 10% by up to 1 mM amiloride. We could not demonstrate a HCO3- -dependent or 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid-sensitive component of Na+ influx in microvillus membrane vesicles. This study thus indicates the presence of a transport system mediating electrogenic Na+/HCO3- co-transport in basolateral, but not luminal, membrane vesicles isolated from the rabbit renal cortex. Analogous to the use of renal microvillus membrane vesicles to study Na+/H+ exchange, renal basolateral membrane vesicles may be a useful model system for examining the kinetics and possible regulation of Na+/HCO3- co-transport."
https://openalex.org/W1529689640,"Data in the previous paper suggest that epinephrine can mobilize a small pool of arachidonic acid via an enzymatic pathway distinct from phospholipase C and that this pathway is blocked by perturbations that block Na+/H+ exchange. The present studies demonstrate that epinephrine and ADP stimulate a phosphatidylinositol-hydrolyzing phospholipase A2 activity in human platelets. This occurs even when measurable phospholipase C activation, platelet secretion, and secondary aggregation are blocked with the thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist SQ29548. Furthermore, perturbants of Na+/H+ exchange diminish lysophosphatidylinositol production in response to epinephrine, ADP, and thrombin, but not to the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. Artificial alkalinization of the platelet interior with methylamine reverses the effect of the Na+/H+ antiporter inhibitor, ethylisopropylamiloride, on thrombin-stimulated lysolipid production, suggesting that the alkalinization of the platelet interior which would occur secondary to activation of Na+/H+ exchange might play an important role in phospholipase A2 activation. In addition, treatment of platelets with methylamine increases the sensitivity of phospholipase A2 to activation by the Ca2+ ionophore A23187, suggesting that changes in pH and Ca2+ may regulate phospholipase A2 activity synergistically. Finally, epinephrine causes a prompt decrease in platelet-chlortetracyclin fluorescence even in the presence of cyclooxygenase inhibitors, suggesting that epinephrine is able to mobilize membrane-bound Ca2+ independent of phospholipase C activation. Taken together, the data suggest that epinephrine-provoked stimulation of phospholipase A2 activity may occur as a result of Ca2+ mobilization and a concomitant intraplatelet alkalinization resulting from accelerated Na+/H+ exchange."
https://openalex.org/W189101662,"Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an apolipoprotein produced by the liver in response to inflammation; the levels of SAA mRNA and SAA protein increase at least 500-fold within 24 h. We have obtained clones of all three genes and pseudogene that make up the murine SAA gene family. Two of the genes have 96% sequence homology over their entire length, including introns and flanking sequences 288 base pairs (bp) 5' and 443 bp 3' to the genes: an overall length of 3215 bp. The sharp boundaries between homologous and nonhomologous sequences and the absence of interspersed repeated sequences there suggest that conversion has occurred between these two genes. The homologous regions are bounded by short inverted repeats containing alternating purine and pyrimidine residues, as described for other gene conversion units. The third SAA gene has evolved separately, although all are closely linked on chromosome 7. Comparison of the upstream regions of the SAA genes with those of the rat fibrinogen genes, whose expression is also induced by inflammation, reveals sequences common to all six genes which are very improbable on a random basis."
https://openalex.org/W1536463027,"The lysosomal beta-hexosaminidases (N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, EC 3.2.1.30) occur as two major isozymes, hexosaminidase A (alpha beta a beta b) and hexosaminidase B (2(beta a beta b)). To facilitate the investigations of the biosynthesis and structure of the enzymes and the nature of mutation in Tay-Sachs disease, we have isolated cDNA clones coding for the alpha-subunit. The polypeptide chains of hexosaminidase A (30 mg) were digested with trypsin, and peptides were isolated by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography and their amino acid sequences determined. One of alpha-chain peptides contained a string of seven amino acids from which two sets of oligonucleotides were specified. They were used to screen the SV40-transformed human fibroblast cDNA library of Okayama and Berg. Three cDNA clones, designated pHexA, identified from among 5 X 10(5) clones screened, contained the deduced amino-acid sequences of five alpha-chain peptides. Genomic DNA homologous to pHexA cDNA mapped to human chromosome 15 in somatic cell hybrids, as expected for the pre-alpha-polypeptide. Two of the clones contained identical polyadenylation sites, while the third was polyadenylated about 450 base pairs downstream. The two types of clones were found to correspond to a major 2.0-kilobase pair and a minor 2.3-kilobase pair mRNA species. Blot hybridizations of mRNA and DNA from Tay-Sachs variant fibroblasts revealed absence or reduction of levels of both mRNA species among infantile and juvenile variants, but no observable DNA alterations. Alignment of the pre-alpha- and pre-beta-polypeptides revealed 55% nucleotide and 57% amino acid homology. These data suggest a common origin of the HEXA and HEXB genes and account for the similar substrate specificities of the alpha-dimer subunit, hexosaminidase S, and hexosaminidase B."
https://openalex.org/W1520609171,"Type VII collagen, in the form of an antiparallel dimer, is a major protein component of anchoring fibrils. The ultrastructural appearance of these fibrils suggests that they may serve to anchor the basement membrane zone to the underlying connective tissue matrix. We report here the identification and initial characterization of Type VII procollagen, recovered from the media of epidermoid carcinoma cell cultures. Immunoblotting using monospecific antibodies to Type VII procollagen identifies a single, homogeneous band of at least Mr 320,000 following disulfide bond reduction. This chain contains 170 kDa of collagen triple helix and 150 kDa of non-helical domain at the carboxyl terminus. Pepsin digestion of this material yields Type VII collagen identical to that isolated from whole tissue and a series of quasi-stable peptides derived from the carboxyl-terminal region. Cell extracts contain procollagen chains identical in size to those secreted into the media. There is no evidence for processing of this material in cell culture. Partial purification by velocity sedimentation and transmission electron microscopic observation following rotary shadowing reveals both monomers (426 nm) and dimers (785 nm). Dimers are antiparallel and interact through 60-nm overlap, with amino-terminal globular domains present at the ends of the overlap. The multi-domain carboxyl-terminal region appears as three similar arms originating from a centralized globular region adjacent to the collagen helix. The carboxyl globular domain is present in whole tissue and may participate in the unique fibril form of this collagen. The amino-terminal globule may function in the antiparallel assembly of dimers."
https://openalex.org/W1577019207,"The ability of epinephrine or ADP to cause an increase in the production of phospholipase C products (diacylglycerol and inositol phosphates) in human platelets is blocked by perturbants of Na+/H+ exchange, i.e. ethylisopropylamiloride, decreased extraplatelet pH, or removal of extraplatelet Na+. These perturbants do not, however, block inositol phosphate production in response to 0.2 unit/ml thrombin, indicating that inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange does not inhibit the phospholipase C enzyme directly. Since the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin and the endoperoxide/thromboxane antagonist SQ29548 block epinephrine- and ADP-induced inositol phosphate production, it can be concluded that these agonists activate phospholipase C secondary to mobilization of arachidonic acid and production of cyclooxygenase products. This conclusion is consistent with the observation that the endoperoxide analogue U46619 causes inositol phosphate production. Furthermore, the effect of U46619 is not blocked by inhibitors of Na+/H+ exchange. The initial pool of arachidonic acid mobilized by epinephrine can be measured using negative ion gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and is sensitive to inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange. The present data suggest that epinephrine and ADP cause mobilization of a small pool of arachidonic acid by a pathway involving Na+/H+ exchange. The cyclooxygenase products derived from this pool subsequently activate phospholipase C. Since the same treatments that block epinephrine- and ADP-induced diacylglycerol and inositol phosphate production also block epinephrine- and ADP-induced dense granule secretion, it appears that activation of phospholipase C, albeit indirectly via cyclooxygenase products, may be required for epinephrine and ADP to evoke platelet secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1634188943,"Actin filaments of different lengths were prepared by polymerizing actin in the presence of various concentrations of gelsolin, a protein which accelerates actin polymerization by stabilizing nuclei from which filaments grow and which binds to their fast growing ends. The lengths of the actin filaments following polymerization were measured by electron microscopy and showed that the number-average filament length agreed with the predicted length if each gelsolin molecule acted as a seed for the growth of an actin filament. The distribution of lengths was independent of the actin:gelsolin ratio and was similar to that of actin filaments polymerized in the absence of gelsolin (Lw/Ln = 1.8). The mobility of these filaments in solution was studied by quasielastic light scattering and by viscometry. The translational diffusion constant determined by quasielastic light scattering was in agreement with the infinite dilution values calculated from the dimensions and the distribution of lengths determined by electron microscopy for relatively short filament lengths. Under conditions where overlap of the rotational domains of the filaments would be expected to occur, the measured diffusion rates deviated from their predicted dilute solution values and the solution viscosity increased abruptly. The dependence of the diffusion constant and the solution viscosity on the length of the actin filaments can be explained in terms of a theory that describes the restraints on diffusion of independent rigid rods in semi-dilute solution. The results suggest that the rheology of actin filaments can be accounted for by steric restraints. The length of cytoplasmic actin filaments in some cell types is such that these steric constraints are significant and could produce large changes in physical properties with small changes in filament length."

https://openalex.org/W1516085090,"Low concentrations of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) elicit a specific response in human neutrophils, characterized by the production of oxygen radicals and the release into the medium of a membrane-bound serine proteinase (Pontremoli, S., Melloni, E., Michetti, M., Sacco, O., Sparatore, B., Salamino, F., Damiani, G. and Horecker, B. L. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 83, 1685-1689). The following evidence indicates that this response is mediated by membrane-bound protein kinase C: 1) it is blocked by inhibitors of protein kinase C; and 2) it is enhanced in cells preloaded with leupeptin which prevents proteolysis of protein kinase C and its subsequent dissociation from the cell membrane. This response is not accompanied by significant exocytosis of granule enzymes. With higher concentrations of PMA, and more particularly on stimulation with formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) plus cytochalasin B, a substantial exocytosis of constituents of both specific and azurophil granules is observed. With fMLP, exocytosis of granule enzymes is the predominant event, with little production of H2O2 and negligible release of membrane-bound serine proteinase. Exocytosis promoted either by a high concentration of PMA or by fMLP is inhibited by leupeptin, indicating that it is due to the action of an intracellular Ca2+-dependent thiol proteinase (calpain), either directly or by conversion by calpain of membrane-bound protein kinase C to the soluble Ca2+/phospholipid-independent form. Intracellular mobilization of Ca2+ is also observed following stimulation with either PMA or fMLP, but only the latter results in a net increase in the intracellular concentration of free Ca2+; under these conditions maximum exocytosis of granule contents is observed."
https://openalex.org/W1589880964,"When grown on methanol or methylamine, Paracoccus denitrificans synthesized three periplasmic soluble c-type cytochromes, cytochrome c550 and two additional cytochromes which were not present during growth on succinate and have not previously been characterized. These cytochromes have been separated from each other and their physical properties have been determined. The inducible cytochromes, c551i and c553i, exhibit Mr and pI values of 22,000 and 3.5, and 30,000 and 3.8, respectively. Cytochrome c553i binds CO. None of these cytochromes accepted electrons directly from methylamine dehydrogenase, but each accepted electrons from amicyanin, the electron acceptor for methylamine dehydrogenase. Cytochrome c551i was the most efficient electron acceptor for amicyanin, exhibiting a half-time of reaction at least 6 and 15 times faster than those observed for cytochromes c553i and c550, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1495442004,"Both epidermal growth factor (EGF) and vanadate can activate 45Ca2+ influx into A431 epidermal carcinoma cells, without a detectable lag period possibly via a voltage-independent calcium channel. 22Na+/H+ exchange and 45Ca2+ uptake are mutually independent. Neither EGF nor vanadate induce any significant change in the steady-state levels of [1,3-3H]glycerol-labeled diacylglycerol, myo-[2-3H]inositol-labeled inositol trisphosphate or in 32P-labeled polyphosphoinositides or phosphatidic acid over the first 10 min of treatment, suggesting that the EGF receptor is not directly coupled to phosphatidylinositol turnover and that the two ion fluxes are not induced via a kinase C-dependent pathway. An increase in turnover of polyphosphoinositides can be detected in EGF-stimulated cells by nonequilibrium labeling with [32P]phosphate, but the increase shows a lag of about 1 min under the conditions used to detect 45Ca2+ influx. Chelation of free Ca2+ decreases but does not abolish the EGF-stimulated turnover. Preincubation with tetradecanoylphorbol acetate or 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol inhibits the increase in 45Ca2+ uptake by both EGF and vanadate. Tetradecanoylphorbol acetate alone does not alter the basal rate of influx when added together with 45Ca2+. Surprisingly, the activation by vanadate and its inhibition by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate are unaffected by down-regulation of the EGF receptors through prior incubation with growth factor. Therefore, in A431 cells the activation of Na+/H+ exchange and Ca2+ influx appear to be independent of phosphatidylinositol turnover, and the EGF receptor does not itself function as a Ca2+ channel. Vanadate apparently activates influx through a mechanism distinct from or distal to the EGF receptor."
https://openalex.org/W196265265,"Bumetanide is a potent inhibitor of cation-chloride co-transport systems in many cell types, including duck red cells. We studied equilibrium binding of [3H]bumetanide to intact duck red cells under a number of conditions known to affect (Na + K + 2Cl) co-transport in these cells. Saturable [3H]bumetanide binding to duck red cells is markedly stimulated by addition of norepinephrine or cell shrinkage, conditions which similarly stimulate co-transport. In the presence of norepinephrine and saturating concentrations of extracellular sodium, potassium, and chloride for the co-transporter, we found approximately 1000 [3H]bumetanide-binding sites/red cell, and measurement of 24Na+ influx on the same cells yielded a turnover number of approximately 4000/s for the co-transporter. 24Na+ influx was negatively correlated with the amount of bound [3H]bumetanide, and both saturable binding and inhibition of influx were half-maximal at approximately 10(-7) M [3H]bumetanide. Binding of [3H]bumetanide to duck red cells is stimulated in a saturable manner by increasing extracellular sodium and potassium. Chloride has a biphasic effect on [3H]bumetanide binding; increasing [Cl-]o (by replacement of methylsulfate) from 0 to 32 mM markedly enhances binding, whereas further increasing [Cl-]o to 160 mM inhibits binding. This behavior is similar to that reported for bumetanide inhibition of duck red cell (Na + K + 2Cl) co-transport (Haas, M., and McManus, T. J. (1983) Am. J. Physiol. 245, C235-C240; Haas, M., and McManus, T. J. (1982) Biophys. J. 37, 214a) and [3H]bumetanide binding to membranes from dog kidney outer medulla (Forbush, B. III, and Palfrey, H. C. (1983) J.

https://openalex.org/W1651085429,"An N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive ATPase was purified 100-fold from chromaffin granule membranes. The purification procedure included solubilization with polyoxyethylene 9 lauryl ether, chromatography on hydroxylapatite and DEAE-cellulose columns, and glycerol gradient centrifugations. Inclusion of phosphatidylserine and a mixture of protease inhibitors during the purification procedure was necessary to maintain the activity of the preparation. The purified preparation contained four major polypeptides with molecular masses of about 115, 72, 57, and 39 kDa, which were copurified with the ATPase activity. The 115-kDa subunit binds [14C]dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and the subunits of 115 and 39 kDa bind [14C]N-ethylmaleimide. The ATP-dependent proton uptake activity of chromaffin granule membranes is inhibited 50% with about 20 microM N-ethylmaleimide, while over 5 mM concentrations of the inhibitor were required to block the ATPase activity of the membranes. The ATPase activity of the purified enzyme was inhibited via two different affinities: a high affinity site with a Ki in the microM range and a low affinity site in the mM range, each contributing to about 50% inhibition of the enzyme. It is concluded that the proton-ATPase of chromaffin granule membranes contains at least four subunits with the 115-kDa polypeptide being the main subunit having the active site for the ATPase activity of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1606670757,"Plasma membrane fractions of stimulated and resting cells were isolated from pig blood neutrophils. The midpoint redox potential (Em) of the membrane-bound flavin was determined potentiometrically by analysis of the flavin free-radical signal by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. In both stimulated and resting cells, a peak position of the titration curve gave an Em value of -280 mV at pH 7.0 (Em7). The flavin free radical showed an ESR spectrum at g = 2.004 with a peak to peak width of 19 G, which indicates that the redox intermediate is a neutral semiquinone. Redox titrations were anaerobically examined at 25 degrees C with NADPH in place of dithionite. Addition of NADPH to plasma membranes of stimulated cells resulted in a rapid change in potential, accompanied by the formation of the ESR signal of flavin free radical. Computer simulation of the titration points gave an ambient midpoint potential of -280 mV (Em7). In contrast, those of resting cells showed a very slow change in potential and no g = 2.00 signal formation. Power saturation behavior of the ESR signal showed a marked difference between those of stimulated and resting cells. ESR characteristics of the flavin are discussed in relation to the membrane-bound NADPH oxidase."

https://openalex.org/W1573718340,"Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulated a rapid rise in inositol trisphosphate (IP3) formation and prolactin release from 7315c tumor cells. The potencies (half-maximal) of TRH in stimulating IP3 formation and prolactin release were 100 +/- 30 and 140 +/- 30 mM, respectively. Pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin (for up to 24 h) had no effect on either process. Pretreatment of the cells with cholera toxin (30 nM for 24 h) also failed to affect basal or TRH-stimulated IP3 formation. TRH was also able to stimulate IP3 formation with a half-maximal potency of 118 +/- 10 nM in a lysed cell preparation of 7315c cells; the TRH-stimulated formation of IP3 was enhanced by GTP. 5'-Guanosine gamma-thiotriphosphate (GTP gamma S) and 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p), nonhydrolyzable analogs of GTP, stimulated IP3 formation in the absence of TRH with half-maximal potencies of 162 +/- 50 and 7500 +/- 4300 nM, respectively. In contrast to the lack of effect of pertussis toxin on the TRH receptor system, treatment of 7315c cells with pertussis toxin for 3 h or longer completely abolished the ability of morphine, an opiate agonist, to inhibit either adenylate cyclase activity or prolactin release. During this 3-h treatment, pertussis toxin was estimated to induce the endogenous ADP ribosylation of more than 70% of Ni, the inhibitory GTP-binding protein. GTP gamma S and Gpp(NH)p inhibited cholera toxin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity (presumably by acting at Ni) with half-maximal potencies of 25 +/- 9 and 240 +/- 87 nM, respectively. Finally, Gpp(NH)p was also able to inhibit the [32P]ADP ribosylation of Ni with a half-maximal potency of 300 nM. These results suggest that a novel GTP-binding protein, distinct from Ni, couples the TRH receptor to the formation of IP3."
https://openalex.org/W1526581153,"Recent studies have demonstrated that ligand-bound insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-II receptors on the adipocyte cell surface are rapidly internalized into an intracellular membrane fraction prior to recycling to the plasma membrane (Oka, Y., Rozek, L. M., and Czech, M. P. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 9435-9442). In order to evaluate whether these subcellular movements of IGF-II receptors in fat cells require their binding to ligand, cell surface IGF-II receptors of insulin-treated fat cells were iodinated with Na125I and lactoperoxidase at 15 degrees C. IGF-II receptors were then localized by immunoadsorption from solubilized cell surface plasma membranes and intracellular low density microsomes derived from labeled cells. When fat cells were homogenized immediately after iodination, most of the labeled IGF-II receptors were associated with the plasma membrane fraction. However, when iodinated fat cells were incubated at 37 degrees C for various times before homogenization, labeled IGF-II receptors progressively decreased in the plasma membrane fraction and concomitantly increased in the low density microsome fraction with a half-time of about 5 min. The rate of increase of radiolabeled IGF-II receptors appearing in the low density microsomes of labeled fat cells incubated with insulin was not changed by the addition of a saturating concentration of IGF-II. These results indicate that cell surface IGF-II receptors are rapidly internalized and recycled even in the absence of ligand binding in insulin-treated adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2148460806,"Erythropoietin (EP) responsive Friend virus-infected erythroid cells had 200,000 steady-state binding sites for transferrin at 37 degrees C when isolated from the spleens of Friend virus-infected mice. Upon culture of these cells with EP, the synthesis of transferrin receptors increased 4- to 7-fold and the number of transferrin-binding sites per cell doubled after 24 h. However, the rate of uptake of 59Fe from transferrin remained constant at approximately 35,000 atoms of 59Fe per minute per cell during this period in culture. The amount of 125I-transferrin internalized during the steady-state binding did not change during this culture period while the transferrin bound to the surface increased 3-fold. At all stages of erythroid maturation, the maximum rate of endocytosis was determined to be 18,000 molecules of transferrin per minute per cell, and the interval that 125I-transferrin remains in the interior of the cell was calculated to be 6.9 min. After 48 h of culture with EP, the number of steady-state transferrin-binding sites was reduced in part due to the sequestration of surface receptors within the cell. The uptake of iron from transferrin was limited by the level of endocytosis of transferrin during the initial phase of culture and the number of transferrin receptors at the cell surface during the latter stages of erythroid maturation of these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1490716750,"Addition of tumor-promoting phorbol diesters to [32P]phosphate-labeled A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells caused an increase in the phosphorylation state of the transferrin receptor. The A431 cell transferrin receptor was also found to be a substrate for protein kinase C in vitro. Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of the transferrin receptor resolved the same two phosphopeptides (X and Y) after either protein kinase C phosphorylation in vitro or treatment of labeled A431 cells with phorbol diesters. [32P]Phosphoserine was the only labeled phosphoamino acid detected. Phosphopeptide X was shown to be an incomplete tryptic digestion product which could be further digested with trypsin to generate the limit tryptic phosphopeptide (Y). Radiosequence analysis of [32P]phosphopeptide Y demonstrated that the [32P]phosphoserine was the second residue from amino terminus of the peptide. This receptor phosphopeptide was found to co-migrate with the synthetic peptide Phe-Ser(P)-Leu-Ala-Arg (where Ser(P) is phosphoserine) during reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and two-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis and chromatography. The peptide Phe-Ser(P)-Leu-Ala-Arg is an expected tryptic fragment of the cytoplasmic domain of the transferrin receptor corresponding to residues 23-27. We conclude that the major site of protein kinase C phosphorylation of the transferrin receptor in vivo and in vitro is serine 24. This phosphorylation site is located within the intracellular domain of the transferrin receptor, 38 residues away from the predicted transmembrane domain."

An eighth intron was found in the mRNA 5' untranslated region. The 5' flanking sequences contain elements which are conserved in other chicken muscle actin genes. Additional sequences at the 5' end of the gene may be conserved in at least one human actin gene. We have identified at least four messenger RNAs ranging in size from approximately 1370 to 2700 nucleotides (excluding poly(A) tails) which are transcribed from the alpha-smooth muscle actin gene. These RNAs differ in the length of their 3' untranslated regions, probably as a result of the utilization of alternative polyadenylation signals. This is the first report of an actin gene with multiple mRNA transcripts."
https://openalex.org/W2140482139,"Mitochondria were prepared by a method including a Percoll purification step after the rapid homogenization of livers of fed rats which had been perfused either under unstimulated conditions or in the presence of vasopressin and/or glucagon. The two hormones separately or together increased the total calcium content of the mitochondria. This enhancement was accompanied by parallel increases in activities of the Ca2+-sensitive intramitochondrial enzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase. The effects of the two hormones on total mitochondrial calcium and on the activities of the oxidative enzymes were additive. The persistent enhancements of mitochondrial calcium content and enzyme activities were partially reversed by the addition of Na+ ions to the mitochondrial incubations; these effects of Na+ were blocked by diltiazem, a selective inhibitor of Na+-induced Ca2+ release. Mitochondria from control livers were incubated in vitro with CaCl2 to achieve various calcium content, and mitochondrial enzyme activities and calcium content were measured. A good correlation was obtained between the total calcium content and the activities of pyruvate dehydrogenase and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase. The results obtained are consistent with the hypothesis that vasopressin and glucagon additively cause increases in intramitochondrial [Ca2+] and so bring about the activations of these key enzymes of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1484678965,"Skeletal muscle rapidly develops severe insulin resistance following denervation, although insulin binding is unimpaired. Insulin-stimulated receptor tyrosyl kinase activity was studied in intact and 24-h denervated rat hind limb muscles using three preparations: (a) solubilized insulin receptors incubated +/- insulin with gamma-[32P]ATP and histone H2b; (b) soleus muscles prelabeled in vitro with [32P]phosphate with subsequent insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the receptor in situ; (c) assessment of in vivo activation of muscle receptor tyrosyl kinase by insulin. The latter was achieved by solubilizing muscle insulin receptors in the presence of phosphoprotein phosphatase and kinase inhibitors and measuring receptor-catalyzed histone H2b phosphorylation in the presence of limiting (5 microM) gamma-[32P]ATP. Receptors isolated 5 and 30 min after intravenous insulin injection catalyzed 32P incorporation into histone H2b twice as fast as those from saline-treated controls; insulin stimulated histone H2b labeling exclusively on tyrosine. In vivo activation was demonstrated using solubilized and insulin-agarose-bound receptors. Autophosphorylation of the beta-subunit and receptor tyrosyl kinase activity toward histone H2b was stimulated by insulin in denervated muscles as in controls, although the biological response to insulin, in vitro and in vivo, was markedly impaired after denervation, suggesting a postreceptor defect. The method developed to assess insulin-stimulated receptor activation in vivo seems useful in characterizing mechanisms of insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1499540675,"A hybrid gene consisting of the ompF promoter, the coding regions for the signal peptide, and the Ala-Glu residue of the OmpF NH2 terminus and the coding region for the major outer membrane lipoprotein devoid of the NH2-terminal cysteine residue was constructed. Escherichia coli carrying the cloned gene produced the predicted hybrid protein that is the same as the major lipoprotein except that the diacyl glycerylcysteine residue at the NH2 terminus is replaced by the Ala-Glu residue. The hybrid protein was localized in the periplasmic space as a trimer with a noncovalent interaction in addition to the previously known covalent interaction with the peptidoglycan. These results strongly indicate that the major lipoprotein exists as a trimer in the periplasmic space with covalent and noncovalent interactions with the peptidoglycan layer through the protein domain on one side and with the hydrophobic interaction with the outer membrane through the lipid domain on the other side. The trimeric structure of the lipoprotein was directly demonstrated by the chemical cross-linking of the native lipoprotein with both cleavable and uncleavable reagents. The cross-linking study also revealed interaction between the lipoprotein and the OmpA protein, a major outer membrane protein."
https://openalex.org/W1509164711,"The retinal nucleotide regulatory protein, transducin, can substitute for the inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (Ni) in inhibiting adenylate cyclase activity in phospholipid vesicle systems. In the present work we have assessed the roles of the alpha (alpha T) and beta gamma (beta gamma T) subunit components in mediating this inhibition. The inclusion of either a preactivated alpha T . GTP gamma S (where GTP gamma S is guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate)) complex, or the beta gamma complex, in phospholipid vesicles containing the pure human erythrocyte stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (Ns) and the resolved catalytic moiety of bovine caudate adenylate cyclase (C) resulted in inhibition of the GppNHp-stimulated (where GppNHp is guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate) activity (by approximately 30-60 and 90%, respectively, at 2 mM MgCl2). The inhibitions by both of these subunit species are specific for the Ns-stimulated activity with neither alpha T . GTP gamma S nor beta gamma T having any direct effect on the intrinsic activity of the catalytic moiety. Increasing the MgCl2 concentration in the assay incubations significantly decreases the inhibitions by both alpha T . GTP gamma S and beta gamma T. Similarly, when the pure hamster lung beta-adrenergic receptor is included in the lipid vesicles with Ns and C, the levels of inhibition of the GppNHp-stimulated activity by both alpha T . GTP gamma S and beta gamma T are reduced compared to those obtained in vesicles containing just Ns and C (but not stimulatory receptor). These inhibitions are reduced still further under conditions where the agonist stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity is maximal, i.e. when stimulating with isoproterenol plus GTP. In these cases the alpha T . GTP gamma S inhibitory effects are completely eliminated and the inhibitions observed with holotransducin can be fully accounted for by the beta gamma T complex. The ability of the beta-adrenergic receptor to relieve these inhibitions suggests that the receptor may remain coupled to Ns (or alpha s) during the activation of the regulatory protein and the stimulation of adenylate cyclase. These results also suggest that under physiological conditions the beta gamma subunit complex is primarily responsible for mediating the inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity."

https://openalex.org/W154859477,"Myeloperoxidase is a major component of specialized lysosomes known as azurophil granules in polymorphonuclear leukocytes or neutrophils. The processing of myeloperoxidase in human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells was studied by pulse-labeling cells in culture with [35S]methionine followed by immunoprecipitation and identification of myeloperoxidase polypeptides from cell fractions after various chase intervals. These studies revealed the presence of a previously unidentified intermediate with Mr 74,000 which kinetically followed the appearance of a larger Mr 81,000 intermediate. Using an in vitro lysosomal preparation the newly identified Mr 74,000 intermediate was directly converted within protected granules to mature forms of myeloperoxidase (Mr 63,000 and 60,000). This conversion occurred optimally at pH 7.5 and was not inhibited by lysosomotropic agents (chloroquine, NH4Cl) or protonophores (monensin, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone). Furthermore, the uptake of radiolabeled amines indicated a neutral intragranular environment (pH 7.35-7.67) which remained unchanged in the presence and absence of 1 mM ATP or 2.5 microM carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. We conclude that, in contrast to other lysosomal pathways, the final proteolytic cleavage of myeloperoxidase does not require an acidic environment."
https://openalex.org/W153647119,"The sites of transcription initiation for Xenopus laevis mtDNA have been mapped using in vitro capping and primer extension analysis of RNA isolated from oocytes. Transcription of the heavy strand initiates predominantly at a site 33 nucleotides upstream of the tRNAPhe gene. This promoter is bidirectional, with transcription of the light strand initiating only one base pair away. A second, more predominant light strand promoter is located 70 nucleotides away from the major heavy strand promoter. The overall organization of the transcription initiation sites with respect to the tRNAPhe gene and the 5' termini of major stable D-loop DNA strands resembles that of the human mtDNA genome. Analysis of the sequences surrounding the Xenopus start sites suggests that the occurrence of a conserved sequence element, ACPuTTATA, around the start sites may be important for promoter recognition and transcription initiation. This sequence is not found in human mtDNA promoters."
https://openalex.org/W1555073503,"In rabbit reticulocytes, the hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1)-specific activity is 4-5 times that of corresponding mature red cells. Immunoprecipitation of hexokinase by a polyclonal antibody made in vitro shows that this maturation-dependent hexokinase decay is not due to accumulation of inactive enzyme molecules but to degradation of hexokinase. A cell-free system derived from rabbit reticulocytes, but not mature erythrocytes, was found to catalyze the decay of hexokinae activity and the degradation of 125I-labeled enzyme. This degradation is ATP-dependent and requires both ubiquitin and a proteolytic fraction retained by DEAE-cellulose. Maximum ATP-dependent degradation was obtained at pH 7.5 in the presence of MgATP. MgGTP could replace MgATP with a relative stimulation of 0.90. 125I-Hexokinase incubated with reticulocyte extract in the presence of ATP forms high molecular weight aggregates that reach a steady-state concentration in 1 h, whereas the degradation of the enzyme is linear up to 8 h, suggesting that the formation of protein aggregates precedes enzyme catabolism. These aggregates are stable upon boiling in 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 3% mercaptoethanol and probably represent an intermediate step in the enzyme degradation with hexokinase and other proteins covalently conjugate to ubiquitin. That hexokinase could be conjugated to ubiquitin was shown by the formation of 125I-ubiquitin-hexokinase complexes in the presence of ATP and the enzymes of the ubiquitin-protein ligase system. Thus, the decay of hexokinase during reticulocyte maturation is ATP- and ubiquitin-dependent and suggests a new physiological role for the energy-dependent degradation system of reticulocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1548164567,"A domain exhibiting major sequence divergences among three cloned repeat units of a complex satellite DNA of the Bermuda land crab contains a repetitive polypyrimidine.polypurine segment consisting of a long C.G tract embedded between runs of CCT.AGG and CGCAC.GTGCG and their variations. The domain adopts at least two types of altered conformations that are markedly affected by pH and negative superhelical density; only one is sensitive to ionic strength. Supercoil-dependent distortions in helical structure are most pronounced at points of interruption in compositional bias in this domain and a similar although less extensive, divergent domain nearby. Since the domain is the site of major sequence divergences among individual satellite repeat units, the altered conformations may be involved in site-specific recombination between repeat units, either those arranged in tandem or those scattered throughout the genome."
https://openalex.org/W1487466685,"The beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol inhibited the glycogenolytic response of platelet-activating factor (AGEPC, 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) in perfused livers derived from fed rats. AGEPC-stimulated hepatic vasoconstriction, measured by increases in portal vein pressure, also was inhibited by prior isoproterenol infusion. Isoproterenol-mediated inhibition of these hepatic responses to AGEPC was not apparent when isoproterenol (10 microM) was coinfused with the beta-receptor antagonist propranolol (75 microM) or when isoproterenol was replaced with the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (10 microM). alpha-Agonist-induced glycogenolysis and vasoconstriction in the perfused liver was unaffected by isoproterenol infusion. Glucagon (2.3 nM) had no effect on the glycogenolytic or vasoconstrictive responses of the liver to AGEPC despite the fact that glucagon increased hepatic cAMP levels to a far greater extent than isoproterenol. Additionally, inhibition of the hepatic responses to AGEPC by isoproterenol occurred in perfused livers from mature rats (i.e. greater than 300 g) in which liver parenchymal cells lack functional beta-adrenergic receptors. The data presented in this study illustrate a specific inhibition of AGEPC-induced hepatic glycogenolysis and vasoconstriction by beta-adrenergic stimulation of the perfused liver. This inhibition appears to be mediated by interaction of isoproterenol with nonparenchymal cells within the liver. These findings are consistent with the concept that AGEPC stimulates hepatic glycogenolysis by an indirect mechanism involving hepatic vasoconstriction."
https://openalex.org/W1491484569,"The minimal beta-replicon of plasmid R6K contains an open reading frame for a 151-amino acid protein in addition to the seven 22-base pair direct nucleotide sequence repeats, the structural gene (pir) for the pi initiation protein, and the beta-origin sequence that have been shown to be required for replication activity. In this work, a site-specific mutation by linker insertion in this putative coding sequence, designated bis, resulted in a nonfunctional beta-replicon. The nonfunctional beta-replicon was complementable in trans and the protein coded by the bis sequence was detected in an immunoblot assay as a hybrid product from a bis-lac z fused gene. The bis gene is not required for a functional alpha or gamma origin replication origin of R6K. A site-specific mutation in the upstream pir gene was shown to lead to a loss of synthesis of the bis product and inactivation of the beta-replicon. Trans-complementation of this mutation for beta-replicon activity required the wild-type sequence of the pir gene joined to the intact bis sequence. These results indicate that the bis product is required for activity specifically of the beta-origin, and its synthesis is coupled in cis to the expression of pi protein from an unaltered pir gene."
https://openalex.org/W1530878541,"Abstract A cDNA clone specific for a chicken phenobarbital-inducible cytochrome P-450 was used to screen a chicken genomic library. Twenty-nine clones were isolated, restriction mapped, and divided into two non-overlapping groups. The cDNA clone hybridized to 12 kilobases of DNA from both groups. Both groups contained restriction fragments which hybridized to both 5' and 3' fragments of the cDNA clone, and it was concluded that the two groups were derived from two separate genes. Southern transfer analysis of individual chicken DNAs and quantitative hybridization analysis indicated that these two genes are independent and are present as single copies/haploid genome. Comparison of restriction digests of the cloned DNAs and total genomic DNA discounted the possibility that other closely related P-450 genes are present in the chicken genome."
https://openalex.org/W1570420082,"When incubated with isolated intact rat liver mitochondria, novobiocin and nalidixic acid act as uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation; they stimulate oxygen uptake and inhibit ATP synthesis. Novobiocin is about as powerful an uncoupler as is 2,4-dinitrophenol, nalidixic acid is somewhat less powerful, and oxolinic acid exerts no inhibition whatsoever at the concentrations used. The three inhibitors are without effect on oxidative phosphorylation in Escherichia coli nor does novobiocin affect this process in a novobiocin-permeable mutant of yeast. While it would appear that oxolinic acid may be a relatively specific tool for the manipulation of the superhelicity of DNA in complex systems such as mammalian mitochondria and intact mammalian cells, the specificity of each of these inhibitors may depend upon the particular conditions and species used and such experiments require adequate controls on oxidative phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1508903801,"The bisphosphatase reaction sequence of rat liver 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase involves a phosphoenzyme intermediate. Catalysis is activated in vitro by cAMP-dependent protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation. We investigated the mechanism of this activation by studying the effect of protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation on the formation and breakdown of the phosphoenzyme intermediate. The significant findings were as follows. 1) Phosphorylation decreased the rate of phosphoenzyme formation. 2) More importantly, phosphorylation increased the much slower rate of phosphoenzyme breakdown both in the absence and presence of the regulatory ligands, inorganic phosphate and alpha-glycerol phosphate. The increase in the rate of phosphoenzyme breakdown correlated with the degree of activation of the bisphosphatase; both were increased about 2-fold. 3) The potent inhibition of phosphoenzyme breakdown by fructose 6-phosphate indicates that, in the catalytic sequence, the release of nascent fructose 6-phosphate from the active site precedes phosphoenzyme breakdown and Pi release. 4) Phosphorylation reduced the fructose 6-phosphate inhibition of phosphoenzyme breakdown both in the absence and presence of phosphate and alpha-glycerol phosphate. 5) Phosphorylation decreased the potent substrate inhibition which occurs at physiological substrate concentrations. It appears that protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation activates fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase by promoting the dissociation of fructose 6-phosphate and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate from the same phosphoenzyme intermediate, hastening its exposure to water and thereby relieving both product and substrate inhibitions."

https://openalex.org/W1530032672,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor protein kinase activity, estimated by the use of peptide substrates, was reduced by as much as 70% after the treatment of intact A431 human carcinoma cells with EGF. The apparent decrease in protein kinase activity was observed after immunoprecipitation of the receptor or after purification of the receptor by lectin chromatography. By the use of [35S]methionine, it was determined that the total amount of receptor obtained was the same whether or not cells were treated with EGF. EGF stimulated the purified receptor protein kinase activity in vitro; however, the EGF-stimulated activity of receptor from EGF-treated cells continued to be reduced by as much at 70% compared to the EGF-stimulated activity from untreated cells. The reduction in receptor protein kinase activity induced by EGF may represent a feedback mechanism by which responsiveness to the growth factor is regulated."
https://openalex.org/W1520643403,"A high molecular weight phosphoprotein phosphatase was purified approximately 11,000-fold from the glycogen-protein complex of rabbit skeletal muscle. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the preparation in the absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate showed a major protein band which contained the activity of the enzyme. Gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate also showed a major protein band migrating at 38,000 daltons. The sedimentation coefficient, Stokes radius, and frictional ratio of the enzyme were determined to be 4.4 S, 4.4 nm, and 1.53, respectively. Based on these values the molecular weight of the enzyme was calculated to be 83,000. The high molecular weight phosphatase was dissociated upon chromatography on a reactive red-120 agarose column. The sedimentation coefficient, Stokes radius, and frictional ratio of the dissociated enzyme (termed monomer) were determined to be 4.1 S, 2.4 nm, and 1.05, respectively. The molecular weight of the monomer enzyme was determined to be 38,000 by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Incubation of the high molecular weight phosphatase with a cleavable cross-linking reagent, 3,3'-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate), showed the formation of a cross-linked complex. The molecular weight of the cross-linked complex was determined to be 85,000 and a second dimension gel electrophoresis of the cleaved cross-linked complex showed that the latter contained only 38,000-dalton bands. Limited trypsinization of the enzyme released a approximately 4,000-dalton peptide from the monomers and dissociated the high molecular weight phosphatase into 34,000-dalton monomers. It is proposed that the catalytic activity of the native glycogen-bound phosphatase resides in a dimer of 38,000-dalton subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1532839568,"A temperature-sensitive mutant (ts gamma 1) of the Cocal serotype of vesicular stomatitis virus synthesizes at the permissive temperature (32 degrees C) a glycoprotein G whose size is smaller (Mr 68,000) than the wild-type (Mr 71,000) and that renders the virion thermolabile. At the nonpermissive temperature (39 degrees C), reduced amounts of noninfectious virus-like particles deficient in G protein were produced. The size of the intracellular G protein was further decreased (Mr 64,000) at the nonpermissive temperature. Biochemical studies including sugar labeling, tryptic peptide analysis, and NH2-terminal sequence analysis of the various glycoproteins suggest that at 32 degrees C a G protein containing a single glycosidic moiety is synthesized. The G protein containing only 1 oligosaccharide residue is transported to the cell surface and is incorporated in infectious virus particles. In contrast, the G protein synthesized at 39 degrees C is nonglycosylated and fails to reach the cell surface. These results suggest that glycosylation of G protein is essential for its transport to the cell surface, and the presence of a single carbohydrate chain is sufficient for this purpose."
https://openalex.org/W1570601718,"ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport was studied in basolateral membrane vesicles prepared from rat parotid gland slices incubated without or with agents which increase cyclic AMP. Isoproterenol (10(-5) M), forskolin (2 X 10(-6) M) and 8-bromocyclic AMP (2 X 10(-3) M) all increased ATP-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake 1.5- to 3-fold. The effect of isoproterenol was concentration-dependent and blocked by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. Enhanced uptake did not appear an artifact of vesicle preparation as apparent vesicle sidedness, 45Ca2+ efflux rates, specific activity of marker enzymes and equilibrium Ca2+ content were identical in vesicle preparations from control and 8-bromocyclic AMP-treated slices. Kinetic studies showed the ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport system in vesicles from 8-bromocyclic AMP-treated slices displayed a approximately 50% increase in Vmax and in Km Ca2+, compared to controls. The data suggest that physiological secretory stimuli to rat parotid acinar cells, which involve cyclic AMP, result in a readjustment of the basolateral membrane ATP-dependent Ca2+ pump."
https://openalex.org/W1575892927,"ompC expression in Escherichia coli K-12 is known to be regulated by the ompB locus, comprising the ompR and envZ genes, and the OmpR protein is believed to act as a positive transcriptional factor. We examined the transcriptional capability of the ompC gene in vitro and found that RNA polymerase could transcribe ompC without a requirement for other transcriptional factors. Furthermore, transcripts from three tandem promoters in ompC were identified in vitro. We employed oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis to dissect the promoter region of the gene and assayed the promoters separately for transcriptional ability using fusions to the lacZ gene. The levels of beta-galactosidase indicate that ompC expression in vivo is dependent on the function of at least one of the upstream promoters. The function of OmpR appears to be the enhancement of a basal level of ompC expression. From the results of our experiments, the site of action of OmpR was deduced to be in the vicinity of the upstream promoters of ompC."

The results indicated, however, that both agents acted to 1) retard the internalization of transferrin bound to transferrin receptors on the plasma membrane of reticulocytes, 2) retard the externalization of internalized transferrin, and 3) block the transport into the cytosol of iron released from transferrin."
https://openalex.org/W1528073927,"Abstract Purified porcine luteinizing hormone/human chorionic gonadotropin receptors were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis following reduction and thermal denaturation and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. A major protein of Mr = 77 +/- 4 X 10(3) and a minor protein of Mr = 66 +/- 4 X 10(3) were observed. Iodoreceptor proteins were resolved into a major component of Mr = 77 +/- 3 X 10(3) and a minor component of Mr = 62 +/- 5 X 10(3) after reduction and thermal denaturation. In the absence of reduction, the iodoreceptor had a major component of Mr 63 +/- 3 X 10(3). Purified human chorionic gonadotropin specifically transferred part of the iodoreceptor from the Mr = 63 X 10(3) species to an Mr = 110-120 X 10(3) species. Purified receptors were analyzed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and identified by specific binding of iodo-human chorionic gonadotropin. Three binding species with approximate Mr = 60 X 10(3), 130 X 10(3), and 260 X 10(3) were identified. Iodoreceptors co-migrated with the Mr = 60 X 10(3) species under the same conditions. Similar results were obtained following renaturation of receptors separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis without reduction and thermal denaturation. These results suggest for the first time that the porcine corpus luteum luteinizing hormone/human chorionic gonadotropin receptor may be a hormone binding monomer of Mr = 60-65 X 10(3), and that the monomer may associate to form hormone binding polymeric receptor complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1585227608,"Proteins conjugated with lactose residues exhibit enhanced hepatic uptake mediated by the galactose receptor. In this study, we demonstrate that lactosaminated Fab fragments (lac-Fab) of IgG can induce hepatic catabolism of specific antigens, especially low density lipoproteins (LDL). lac-Fab and human LDL-lac-Fab complex exhibited specific uptake in isolated rat hepatocytes. In vivo in the rat, lactosamination enhanced plasma clearance of Fab fragments 2-fold and hepatic localization 20-fold. Fab fragments retained their affinity after lactosamination. Hepatic uptake of rat 125I-IgG complexed in vitro with anti-rat lac-Fab was increased almost 5-fold, compared to rat 125I-IgG alone. Injection of rats with anti-LDL lac-Fab induced plasma clearance and hepatic uptake of tracer amounts of previously injected human 125I-LDL, which decreased 50% 10 min after injection of lac-Fab, with 30% present in the liver. Asialofetuin completely inhibited these processes. After a bolus of 6 mg of human LDL, administration of anti-LDL lac-Fab reduced the serum cholesterol of rats to basal values within 2.5 h. These findings suggest that lactosaminated Fab fragments of specific IgGs are effective reagents for inducing hepatic uptake of macromolecules through the galactose receptor. lac-Fab specific for LDL may be an effective hypocholesterolemic agent in vivo."
