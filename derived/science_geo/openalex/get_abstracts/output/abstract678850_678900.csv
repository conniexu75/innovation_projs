https://openalex.org/W3189665086,"Background Obesity is the cause of cardiovascular diseases and other diseases, leading to increased medical costs, and causing a great burden to individuals, families and society. The prevalence of obesity is increasing and has become a global health problem. There is growing evidence that gut microbiota plays an important role in obesity. In this article, we revealed the differences in the gut microbiota between 21 people with obesity and 21 control subjects, and predicted the functional potential changes by 16S rRNA sequencing of the fecal bacteria of the subjects. Methods The raw sequencing data of 21 healthy Beijing volunteers was downloaded from Microbial Genome Database System. Microbial 16S rRNA genes of 21 adults with obesity were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument and analyzed by using bioinformatics and statistical methods. Results The diversity of gut microbiota in people with obesity decreased significantly. There were significant differences in gut microbiota between the Obesity and Control group at different levels. At the phylum level, Firmicutes , Bacteroidetes , Actinobacteria and Fusobacteria are significantly different between the Obesity and Control group. In people with obesity, the ratio of Firmicutes / Bacteroidetes decreased significantly. At the genus level, there were significant differences among the 16 major genera, of which four genera Prevotella , Megamonas , Fusobacterium and Blautia increased significantly in people with obesity, while the remaining 12 genera, Faecalibacterium , Lachnospiracea_incertae_sedis , Gemmiger and Clostridium XlVa , etc. decreased significantly. At the species level, nine species including Bacteroides uniformis and Prevotella copri had significant differences. Compared with the control group, subjects with obesity were abnormalities in 57 pathways, mainly in Carbohydrate metabolism and Lipid metabolism. Conclusions Overall, our study revealed differences in the gut microbiota between people with obesity and control subjects, providing novel target for the treatment of individuals with obesity."

Here, we generate two high-quality genomes of Gossypium hirsutum cv. NDM8 and Gossypium barbadense acc. Pima90, and identify large-scale structural variations in the two species and 1,081 G. hirsutum accessions. The density of structural variations is higher in the D-subgenome than in the A-subgenome, indicating that the D-subgenome undergoes stronger selection during species formation and variety development. Many structural variations in genes and/or regulatory regions potentially influencing agronomic traits were discovered. Of 446 significantly associated structural variations, those for fiber quality and Verticillium wilt resistance are located mainly in the D-subgenome and those for yield mainly in the A-subgenome. Our research provides insight into the role of structural variations in genotype-to-phenotype relationships and their potential utility in crop improvement."
https://openalex.org/W3191524981,"Pain decreases the activity of many ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons, yet the underlying neural circuitry connecting nociception and the DA system is not understood. Here we show that a subpopulation of lateral parabrachial (LPB) neurons is critical for relaying nociceptive signals from the spinal cord to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR). SNR-projecting LPB neurons are activated by noxious stimuli and silencing them blocks pain responses in two different models of pain. LPB-targeted and nociception-recipient SNR neurons regulate VTA DA activity directly through feed-forward inhibition and indirectly by inhibiting a distinct subpopulation of VTA-projecting LPB neurons thereby reducing excitatory drive onto VTA DA neurons. Correspondingly, ablation of SNR-projecting LPB neurons is sufficient to reduce pain-mediated inhibition of DA release in vivo. The identification of a neural circuit conveying nociceptive input to DA neurons is critical to our understanding of how pain influences learning and behavior. The authors identify a spinal–parabrachial–mesencephalic circuit that regulates the activity of dopamine neurons during pain."

https://openalex.org/W3188543765,"Like other disease outbreaks, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the rapid generation and dissemination of misinformation and fake news. We investigated whether subscribers to a fact checking newsletter (n = 1397) were willing to share possible misinformation, and whether predictors of possible misinformation sharing are the same as for general samples. We also investigated predictors of willingness to have a COVID-19 vaccine and found that although vaccine acceptance was high on average, it decreased as a function of lower belief in science and higher conspiracy mentality. We found that 24% of participants had shared possible misinformation and that this was predicted by a lower belief in science. Like general samples, our participants were typically motivated to share possible misinformation due to interest in the information, or to seek a second opinion about claim veracity. However, even if information is shared in good faith and not for the purpose of deceiving or misleading others, the spread of misinformation is nevertheless highly problematic. Exposure to misinformation engenders faulty beliefs in others and undermines efforts to curtail the spread of COVID-19 by reducing adherence to social distancing measures and increasing vaccine hesitancy."
https://openalex.org/W3192941690,"Background COVID-19 was declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) in January 2020. Various physical distancing interventions were introduced to flatten the epidemic curve and reduce the disease burden. We evaluated the impacts of policy stringency and residents’ compliance on time-varying reproduction number in 17 countries. Methods Data were from WHO reports of local transmission (February 28 to April 8, 2020) in Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, the UK, US and Vietnam. Earlier local transmission data where available from press releases were added for Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan starting January 28, 2020. COVID-19 policy responses were from the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker with 17 indicators. Changes in people’s behaviors were from Google’s COVID-19 community mobility reports and Apple Maps’ mobility trends reports. We estimated the daily time-varying reproduction number (Rt) by country. 0-, 7- and 14-day lagged effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions and changes in human mobility on Rt were estimated by linear mixed-effects models. Results Rt initially surged rapidly, then declined gradually depending on policy stringency. The highest mean policy stringency scores were for Italy (69.97) and South Korea (61.00). Variations in stringency scores were higher in Europe, the US and Australia than in Asia. The human mobility reduction was greater in countries with strict policies (median stringency score &gt; = 50). In terms of immediate (0-day lag) effects, Rt reductions were found for workplace-closure, limited-gathering, and stay-at-home policies. At a 7-day lag, Rt reductions were found for workplace closure, restrictions on gatherings, stay-at-home requirements, international travel controls, contact tracing and reducing walking around. At a 14-day lag, Rt reductions were found for restrictions on gatherings, less visiting and staying in parks, and reduced walking around. Conclusion The findings show physical distancing policies and residents’ compliance can slow transmission, with the lag-to-effect time varying by policy."
https://openalex.org/W3193123183,"Humans typically create and maintain social bonds through interactions that occur at close social distances. The interpersonal distance of at least 1 m recommended as a relevant measure for COVID-19 contagion containment requires a significant change in everyday behavior. In a web-based experimental study conducted during the first pandemic wave (mid-April 2020), we asked 242 participants to regulate their preferred distance towards confederates who did or did not wear protective masks and gloves and whose COVID-19 test results were positive, negative, or unknown. Information concerning dispositional factors (perceived vulnerability to disease, moral attitudes, and prosocial tendencies) and situational factors (perceived severity of the situation in the country, frequency of physical and virtual social contacts, and attitudes toward quarantine) that may modulate compliance with safety prescriptions was also acquired. A Bayesian analysis approach was adopted. Individual differences did not modulate interpersonal distance. We found strong evidence in favor of a reduction of interpersonal distance towards individuals wearing protective equipment and who tested negative to COVID-19. Importantly, shorter interpersonal distances were maintained towards confederates wearing protective gear, even when their COVID-19 test result was unknown or positive. This protective equipment-related regulation of interpersonal distance may reflect an underestimation of perceived vulnerability to infection; this perception must be discouraged when pursuing individual and collective health-safety measures."
https://openalex.org/W3190791035,"Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) capsid proteins efficiently recruit and surround the viral RNA at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane to yield nascent viral particles. However, little is known either about the molecular mechanisms by which multiple copies of capsid proteins assemble into nucleocapsids (NCs) or how the NC is recruited and wrapped by the ER membrane during particle morphogenesis. Here, we measured relevant interactions concerning this viral process using purified DENV and ZIKV capsid proteins, membranes mimicking the ER lipid composition, and nucleic acids in in vitro conditions to understand the biophysical properties of the RNA genome encapsidation process. We found that both ZIKV and DENV capsid proteins bound to liposomes at liquid-disordered phase regions, docked exogenous membranes, and RNA molecules. Liquid-liquid phase separation is prone to occur when positively charged proteins interact with nucleic acids, which is indeed the case for the studied capsids. We characterized these liquid condensates by measuring nucleic acid partition constants and the extent of water dipolar relaxation, observing a cooperative process for the formation of the new phase that involves a distinct water organization. Our data support a new model in which capsid-RNA complexes directly bind the ER membrane, seeding the process of RNA recruitment for viral particle assembly. These results contribute to our understanding of the viral NC formation as a stable liquid-liquid phase transition, which could be relevant for dengue and Zika gemmation, opening new avenues for antiviral intervention."
https://openalex.org/W3193231125,"Recent advances in microalgae biotechnology have proven that these microorganisms contain a number of bioactive molecules, that can be used as food additives that help prevent disease. The green microalga Chlorella vulgaris presents several biomolecules, such as lutein and astaxanthin, with antioxidant capacity, which can play a protective role in tissues. In this study, we produced and analyzed a C . vulgaris functional alcoholic beverage (produced using a traditional Brazilian alcoholic beverage, cachaça , and C . vulgaris biomass). Assays were conducted in vitro by radical scavenging tests, and in vivo , by modeling cortical spreading depression in rat brains. Scavenging radical assays showed that consumption of the C . vulgaris alcoholic beverage had a DPPH inhibition of 77.2%. This functional alcoholic beverage at a concentration of 12.5 g L -1 significantly improved cortical spreading depression velocity in the rat brains (2.89 mm min -1 ), when compared with cachaça alone (3.68 mm min -1 ) and control (distilled water; 3.25 mm min -1 ). Moreover, animals that consumed the functional beverage gained less weight than those that consumed just alcohol and the control groups. These findings suggest that the C . vulgaris functional alcoholic beverage plays a protective physiologic role in protecting brain cells from the effects of drinking ethanol."
https://openalex.org/W3187142408,"Background Increasing HIV treatment coverage is crucial to reducing population-level HIV incidence. Methods The Botswana Combination Prevention Project (BCPP) was a community randomized trial examining the impact of multiple prevention interventions on population-level HIV incidence and was conducted from October 2013 through June 2017. Home and mobile campaigns offered HIV testing to all individuals ≥ age 16. All identified HIV-positive persons who were not on antiretroviral therapy (ART) were referred to treatment and tracked to determine linkage to care, ART status, retention in treatment, and viral suppression Results Of an estimated total of 14,270 people living with HIV (PLHIV) residing in the 15 intervention communities, BCPP identified 13,328 HIV-positive persons (93%). At study start, 10,703 (80%) of estimated PLHIV knew their status; 2,625 (20%) learned their status during BCPP, a 25% increase with the greatest increases occurring among men (37%) and youth (77%). At study start, 9,258 (65%) of estimated PLHIV were on ART. An additional 3,001 persons started ART through the study. By study end, 12,259 had initiated and were retained on ART, increasing coverage to 93%. A greater increase in ART coverage was achieved among men (40%) compared to women (29%). Of the 11,954 persons who had viral load (VL) test results, 11,687 (98%) were virally suppressed (HIV-1 RNA ≤400 copies/mL). Overall, 82% had documented VL suppression by study end. Conclusions Knowledge of HIV-positive status and ART coverage increased towards 95–95 targets with universal testing, linkage interventions, and ART. The increases in HIV testing and ART use among men and youth were essential to reaching these targets. Clinical trial number NCT01965470 ."
https://openalex.org/W3189266116,"Although CAR-T cells are widely used to treat cancer, efficiency of CAR-T cell cytolytic responses has not been carefully examined. We engineered CAR specific for HMW-MAA (high-molecular-weight melanoma-associated antigen) and evaluated potency of CD8+ CAR-T cells to release cytolytic granules and to kill tissue-derived melanoma cells, which express different levels of HMW-MAA. CAR-T cells efficiently killed melanoma cells expressing high level of HMW-MAA, but not melanoma cells with lower levels of HMW-MAA. The same melanoma cells presenting significantly lower level of stimulatory peptide-MHC ligand were readily lysed by T cells transduced with genes encoding α,β-TCR specific for the peptide-MHC ligand. The data suggest that higher level of targeted molecules is required to engage a larger number of CARs than TCRs to induce efficient cytolytic granule release and destruction of melanoma cells. Understanding the difference in molecular mechanisms controlling activation thresholds of CAR- versus TCR-mediated responses will contribute to improving efficiency of CAR T cells required to eliminate solid tumors presenting low levels of targeted molecules."
https://openalex.org/W3189502858,"In the current study, based on the national fire statistics from 2003 to 2017, we analyzed the 24-hour occurrence regularity of fire in China to study the occurrence regularity and influencing factors of fire and provide a reference for scientific and effective fire prevention. The results show that the frequency of fire is low from 0 to 6 at night, accounting for about 13.48%, but the death toll due to fire is relatively high, accounting for about 39.90%. Considering the strong seasonal characteristics of the time series of monthly fire frequency, the SARIMA model predicts the fire frequency. According to the characteristics of time series data and prediction results, an optimized Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model (SARIMA) model based on Quantile outlier detection method and similar mean interpolation method is proposed, and finally, the optimal model is constructed as SARIMA (1,1,1) (1,1,1) 12 for prediction. The results show that: according to the optimized SARIMA model to predict the number of fires in 2018 and 2019, the root mean square error of the fitting results is 2826.93, which is less than that of the SARIMA model, indicating that the improved SARIMA model has a better fitting effect. The accuracy of the results is increased by 11.5%. These findings verified that the optimized SARIMA model is an effective improvement for the series with quantile outliers, and it is more suitable for the data prediction with seasonal characteristics. The research results can better mine the law of fire aggregation and provide theoretical support for fire prevention and control work of the fire department."
https://openalex.org/W3191179087,"Water and nutrient are two critical factors that limit plant growth to spatial-temporal extents. Tree root foraging behavior has not received adequate attention in heterogeneous soil environments in temperate forest under drought pressure. In this study, birch ( Betula platyphylla ) and larch ( Larix olgensis ) seedlings were raised in pots in a split-root system with artificially heterogeneous soil environments to study the root foraging response to drought. Potted space was split into two halves where substrates were mixed with fertilizers in 67.5 mg nitrogen (N) plant -1 (N-P 2 O 5 -K 2 O, 14-13-13) to both halves as to create a homogeneous condition. Otherwise, a rate of 135 mg N plant -1 of fertilizers was delivered to a random half to create a heterogeneous condition. Half of seedlings were fully sub-irrigated every three days with the other half received the drought treatment by being watered every six days. Both birch and larch seedlings showed greater net shoot growth and biomass increment in well-watered condition, while root morphology was promoted by drought. Both species placed more fine roots with higher root N concentration in nutrient-enriched patches. In the heterogeneous pattern, birch showed a higher foraging precision assessed by biomass and greater foraging plasticity assessed in morphology and physiology. In contrast, larch seedlings had higher root N concentration in the well-watered condition. Neither species showed a significant response of N utilization to the heterogeneous pattern, but both used more N when water supply was improved. Overall, birch is better at acclimating to heterogeneous soil conditions, but its ability to seize N was lower than larch when drought was alleviated."
https://openalex.org/W3187335414,"The involvement of the phytohormone ethylene as the main trigger of climacteric fruit ripening is well documented. However, our knowledge regarding the role of ethylene response factor (ERF) transcription factor in the transcriptional regulation of ethylene biosynthesis during fruit ripening remains limited. Here, comprehensive transcriptome analysis and expression profiling revealed 63 ERF s in durian pulps, termed DzERF1 – DzERF63 , of which 34 exhibited ripening-associated expression patterns at three stages (unripe, midripe, and ripe) during fruit ripening. Hierarchical clustering analysis classified 34 ripening-associated DzERF s into three distinct clades, among which, clade I consisted of downregulated DzERF s and clade III included those upregulated during ripening. Phylogenetic analysis predicted the functions of some DzERFs based on orthologs of previously characterized ERFs. Among downregulated DzERF s, DzERF6 functional prediction revealed its role as a negative regulator of ripening via ethylene biosynthetic gene repression, whereas among upregulated genes, DzERF9 was predicted to positively regulate ethylene biosynthesis. Correlation network analysis of 34 ripening-associated DzERFs with potential target genes revealed a strong negative correlation between DzERF6 and ethylene biosynthetic genes and a strong positive correlation between DzERF9 and ethylene biosynthesis. DzERF6 and DzERF9 showed differential expression patterns in association with different ripening treatments (natural, ethylene-induced, and 1-methylcyclopropene-delayed ripening). DzERF6 was downregulated, whereas DzERF9 was upregulated, during ripening and after ethylene treatment. The auxin-repressed and auxin-induced expression of DzERF6 and DzERF9 , respectively, confirmed its dose-dependent responsiveness to exogenous auxin. We suggest ethylene- and auxin-mediated roles of DzERF6 and DzERF9 during fruit ripening, possibly through transcriptional regulation of ethylene biosynthetic genes."
https://openalex.org/W3187641517,"Quetiapine fumarate (QF) is an atypical antipsychotic used off-label for the treatment of delirium in critically-ill infants and children. For the treatment of pediatric populations or patient populations with trouble swallowing tablets, an oral suspension would be an ideal dosage formulation. However, there are no liquid formulations of QF commercially available. Therefore, a compounded oral suspension prepared from the commercial QF tablets is widely used in clinical settings. The extemporaneous preparation of QF compounded oral suspension changes the formulation from a solid form to a liquid form. Thus, the stability of QF compounded oral suspension should be critically evaluated to guide pharmacists for administration and storage of QF compounded oral suspensions. However, the stability of the nonaqueous oral QF suspension was not measured. The objective of this study was to develop QF compounded oral suspensions at 10 mg/mL by using commercial QF tablets in two readily available aqueous vehicles (Ora-Sweet and Ora-Blend) and measure their stability at both room temperature and under refrigeration. Physical stability of the QF compounded suspensions were evaluated by appearance and odor. Chemical stability of the QF compounded suspensions were evaluated based on pH, degradation, drug content and the amount of the drug dissolved in the vehicles. An HPLC method was validated and used to evaluate QF compounded suspensions over 60 days. In addition to the total drug in the suspensions, the dissolved drug in the vehicles was also measured during the stability testing and evaluated as a stability parameter. Overall, QF suspension prepared in Ora-Blend was preferable, demonstrating a superior 60-day stability at both room temperature and refrigerated storage."
https://openalex.org/W3187800251,"Apart from the classical (experimental) methods, biologically active peptides can be studied via bioinformatics approach, also known as in silico analysis. This study aimed to verify the following research hypothesis: ACE inhibitors and antioxidant peptides can be released from salmon and carp proteins during simulated in silico human-like gastrointestinal digestion. The potential to release biopeptides was evaluated using the BIOPEP-UWM quantitative criteria including the profile of biological activity, frequency of the occurrence (A)/release (A E ) of fragments with an ACE inhibitory or antioxidant activity by selected enzymes, and relative frequency of release of bioactive fragments with a given activity by selected enzymes (W). Salmon collagen and myofibrillar proteins of carp turned out to be the best potential source of the searched peptides–ACE inhibitors and antioxidant peptides. Nonetheless, after digestion, the highest numbers of ACE inhibitors and antioxidant peptides were potentially released from the myofibrillar proteins of salmon and carp. Peptide Ranker Score, Pepsite2, and ADMETlab platform were applied to evaluate peptides’ bioactivity potential, their safety and drug-like properties. Among the 63 sequences obtained after the simulated digestion of salmon and carp proteins, 30 were considered potential biopeptides. The amino acid sequences of ACE-inhibiting and antioxidant peptides were predominated by P, G, F, W, R, and L. The predicted high probability of absorption of most analyzed peptides and their low toxicity should be considered as their advantage."
https://openalex.org/W3192152348,"Background Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with a dismal prognosis in Transcatheter Aortic Valve replacement (TAVR). Acute kidney recovery (AKR), a phenomenon reverse to AKI has recently been associated with better outcomes. Methods Between November 2012 to May 2018, we explored consecutive patients referred to our Heart Valve Center for TAVR. AKI was defined according to the VARC-2 definition. Mirroring the VARC-2 definition of AKI, AKR was defined as a decrease in serum creatinine (≥50%) or ≥25% improvement in GFR up to 72 hours after TAVR. Results AKI and AKR were respectively observed in 8.3 and 15.7% of the 574 patients included. AKI and AKR patients were associated to more advanced kidney disease at baseline. At a median follow-up of 608 days (range 355–893), AKI and AKR patients experienced an increased cardiovascular mortality compared to unchanged renal function patients (14.6% and 17.8% respectively, vs. 8.1%, CI 95%, p&lt;0.022). Chronic kidney disease, (HR: 3.9; 95% CI 1.7–9.2; p &lt; 0.001) was the strongest independent factor associated with AKI similarly to baseline creatinine level (HR: 1; 95% CI 1 to 1.1 p &lt; 0.001) for AKR. 72-hours post procedural AKR (HR: 2.26; 95% CI 1.14 to 4.88; p = 0.021) was the strongest independent predictor of CV mortality. Conclusions Both AKR and AKI negatively impact long term clinical outcomes of patients undergoing TAVR."
https://openalex.org/W3187137679,"With the decline in public budgets for agricultural extension support, ties between members of farmer groups are becoming more important to facilitate information transfer about agroforestry. This paper examines the role of social network ties in predicting organizational leadership in an agroforestry-based farmer group. Using social network data derived from interviews with members of farming groups based in the Ayeyarwady Delta of Myanmar, we established a positive relationship between advice-seeking ties and organizational leadership. In other words, farmers who were highly sought for agroforestry advice were more likely to be elected as leaders of the farmer group. Results show the frequency of interactions through advice-seeking ties also had a positive influence on the probability of farmers holding leadership positions. We found a core–periphery structure for the advice networks, whereby farmer leaders were overrepresented at the network core. Interestingly, general members of the farmer group were also in the core of the core-periphery structure, suggesting that engaging with farmers without leadership roles can also effectively disseminate agroforestry information to peripheral farmers. We conclude that farmer groups are valuable in agroforestry adoption and persistence and further analyses of formal leadership structures are needed to support more transparent and accountable governance."
https://openalex.org/W3192615430,"Abstract The activity of Rho family GTPase protein, RAC1, which plays important normal physiological functions, is dysregulated in multiple cancers. RAC1 is expressed in both estrogen receptor alpha (ER)-positive and ER-negative breast cancer (BC) cells. However, ER-positive BC is more sensitive to RAC1 inhibition. We have determined that reducing RAC1 activity, using siRNA or EHT 1864 (a small molecule Rac inhibitor), leads to rapid ER protein degradation. RAC1 interacts with ER within the ER complex and RAC1 localizes to chromatin binding sites for ER upon estrogen treatment. RAC1 activity is important for RNA Pol II function at both promoters and enhancers of ER target genes and ER-regulated gene transcription is blocked by EHT 1864, in a dose-dependent manner. Having identified that RAC1 is an essential ER cofactor for ER protein stability and ER transcriptional activity, we report that RAC1 inhibition could be an effective therapeutic approach for ER-positive BC."
https://openalex.org/W3187430414,"Widespread use of antibiotics in U.S. livestock operations has been identified as a potential contributor to the rising rates of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. In response, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued new rules in January 2017. GFI (Guide for Industry) #213 banned use of antibiotics for growth promotion and required veterinarian permission, via a revised Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD), to deliver antibiotics through feed. Many stakeholders expressed pre-implementation concerns regarding the rules’ potential adverse effects on production and profitability. Our study employed qualitative and quantitative methods to investigate how implementation of GFI #213/VFD impacted Ohio cattle operations. We interviewed over fifty cattle farmers and eight large animal veterinarians to document changes in farm antibiotic use, management practices, and profitability. We also examined published government data for possible effects on overall meat production at the state and national levels. We found that the great majority of Ohio farmers reported little difficulty in complying with the VFD with minimal adverse impacts. Farm responses to the feed directive varied with operation size, type (beef or dairy), and whether producers had previously used fed antibiotics. The most commonly reported changes, by both producers and veterinarians, were more veterinary-client interactions, more paperwork/record-keeping, and decreased use of fed antibiotics. All veterinarians, many beef operators, but no dairy operators reported perceiving the VFD as beneficial; however, dairy operations reported less difficulty with compliance due to established working relationships with veterinarians. We found no evidence that the rules impacted the trajectory of state or national livestock output. In conclusion, GFI #213 was reported as not burdensome enough to prevent compliance, but inconvenient enough to incentivize reduced use of fed antibiotics (when previously used) without significant adverse effects, consistent with its goal of promoting judicious use of medically important antibiotics in order to preserve their effectiveness."

https://openalex.org/W3188437399,"Patients with diabetes are more vulnerable to the detrimental respiratory effects of combustible cigarette smoke (CS) when compared to the general population. Electronic cigarettes (ECIG) and heated tobacco products (HTP) are marketed as less harmful alternatives to CS. In this study, we compared the effects of acute ECIG, HTP and CS exposure on the lungs of type II diabetes versus non-diabetic mice in an animal model.Type II Diabetic (Diab) and Non-Diabetic (Non-Diab) mice were divided into Control, ECIG, HTP and CS groups. Animals were exposed for 6 hrs./day to either air, ECIG, HTP or CS for seven days. Lung injury was determined by a) histopathology, b) wet to dry ratio, c) albumin concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, d) expression of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1 β, e) reactive oxygen species production (ROS), and f) assessment of cellular apoptosis.Lung histology revealed increased edema and inflammatory cells in diabetic mice exposed to ECIG, HTP and CS. The expression of Inflammatory mediators was, in general, more significant in the Diabetic groups as well. TNF-α expression, for example, was upregulated in Diab + ECIG but not in Non-Diab + ECIG. ROS was significantly increased in Diab + CS, less in Non-Diab + CS and weakly noted in ECIG + Diab. Significant albumin leak was observed in Diab and Non-Diab HTP-exposed animals. CS exposure worsened lung injury in Diab when compared to Non-Diab mice.Comorbid medical conditions like diabetes may amplify ill effects of CS, ECIG or HTP exposure."
https://openalex.org/W3189671670,"The Australian finger lime is a unique citrus species that has gained importance due to its unique fruit characteristics and perceived tolerance to Huanglongbing (HLB), an often-fatal disease of citrus trees. In this study, we developed allotetraploid finger lime hybrids and cybrids by utilizing somatic cell fusion techniques to fuse diploid 'OLL8' sweet orange or 'Page' tangelo callus-derived protoplasts with finger lime (FL) mesophyll-derived protoplasts. Six somatic fusions were regenerated from the 'OLL8' + FL fusion, while three putative cybrids were regenerated from the 'Page' + FL fusion. Ploidy levels and nuclear-expressed sequence tag derived simple sequence repeat (EST-SSR) markers confirmed the somatic hybrid production, and mitochondrial DNA primer sets confirmed the cybrid nature. Several trees produced by the somatic fusion remained HLB negative even after 6 years of growth in an HLB-endemic environment. Pathogenesis related (PR) and other genes that are often upregulated in HLB-tolerant trees were also upregulated in our somatic fusions. These newly developed somatic fusions and cybrids could potentially be used as breeding parents to develop the next generation of improved HLB-tolerant rootstocks and scions."
https://openalex.org/W3191199632,"Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is important in evaluating average 24-hour blood pressure (BP) levels, circadian rhythm, sleeping BP and BP variability but many patients are reluctant to use standard ABPM devices.We compared two validated ABPM devices, the BPro tonometric wrist monitor and the A&D TM-2430 oscillometric upper arm monitor, for agreement of recordings and acceptability in 37 hypertensive patients (aged 55±9 years).Successful BP measurements were less frequent with the wrist-type than the arm-type device during the sleeping (66.3% vs. 92.9%, P <0.01) and awake periods (56.2% vs. 86.5%, P <0.01). Comparable paired readings showed no significant difference in systolic BP but diastolic BP (DBP) values were higher with the wrist compared to the arm monitor (24-hour 89±13 vs. 85±14 mmHg, P <0.01) with similar differences awake and sleeping. Bland-Altman analysis showed some large discrepancies between individual arm and wrist monitor measurements. More patients found the wrist monitor more comfortable to use than the arm monitor.Despite the difference in individual BP measurements and the systematic overestimation of DBP values with the BPro device, wrist monitors with good patient acceptability may be useful to facilitate ABPM in some patients to provide additional information about cardiovascular risk and response to antihypertensive therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3192715026,"The aim of the study was to use a previously proposed mask region–based convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) for automatic abnormal liver density detection and segmentation based on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) computed tomography (CT) datasets from a radiological perspective. Training and testing datasets were acquired retrospectively from two hospitals of Taiwan. The training dataset contained 10,130 images of liver tumor densities of 11,258 regions of interest (ROIs). The positive testing dataset contained 1,833 images of liver tumor densities with 1,874 ROIs, and negative testing data comprised 20,283 images without abnormal densities in liver parenchyma. The Mask R-CNN was used to generate a medical model, and areas under the curve, true positive rates, false positive rates, and Dice coefficients were evaluated. For abnormal liver CT density detection, in each image, we identified the mean area under the curve, true positive rate, and false positive rate, which were 0.9490, 91.99%, and 13.68%, respectively. For segmentation ability, the highest mean Dice coefficient obtained was 0.8041. This study trained a Mask R-CNN on various HCC images to construct a medical model that serves as an auxiliary tool for alerting radiologists to abnormal CT density in liver scans; this model can simultaneously detect liver lesions and perform automatic instance segmentation."

To explore value potential of immature fruits from pomegranate 'Wonderful' cultivars, the compositional landscapes and antitumorigenic activities of pomegranate extracts from two different stages of maturation were assessed. Cancer cell proliferation and cytotoxicity was quantified in human lung H1299 and colon HCT116 adenocarcinomas by crystal violet staining, MTS assay and caspase-3 activity. High performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC/DAD) and high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS) analyses indicate that immature fruits are rich sources of gallotannins and ellagitannins, with the highest amounts contained in immature fruit peels. Biological investigations reveal a robust anticancer activity by those immature P. granatum fruit extracts, which reflected induction of tumor cytotoxicity and cell death mechanisms. Together, present observations suggest P. granatum byproducts from the thinning process may provide unexplored values for virtuous circular economy."

This observational study comprised of 92 subjects age-sex matched and divided into two groups: clinical degenerative joint disease (c-DJD, n = 46) and asymptomatic control group (n = 46). Clinical assessment of the DJD and high-resolution CBCT images (isotropic voxel size of 0.08mm) of the temporomandibular joints were performed for each participant. An American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology certified radiologist and a maxillofacial radiologist used the DC/TMD imaging criteria to evaluate the radiographic findings, followed by a consensus of the radiographic evaluation. The two radiologists presented a high agreement (Cohen’s Kappa ranging from 0.80 to 0.87) for all radiographic findings (osteophyte, erosion, cysts, flattening, and sclerosis). Five patients from the c- DJD group did not present radiographic findings, being then classified as arthralgia. In the asymptomatic control group, 82.6% of the patients presented radiographic findings determinant of DJD and were then classified as osteoarthrosis or overdiagnosis. In conclusion, our results showed a high number of radiographic findings in the asymptomatic control group, and for this reason, we suggest that there is a need for additional imaging criteria to classify DJD properly in hr-CBCT images."
https://openalex.org/W3191838517,"The objective of this study was the production of innovative functional cookies enriched with two different sizes (100 and 28 mesh) xiquexique flour by substitution ratio 50% of wheat flour and monitoring the impact of these enrichments on the nutritional, physicochemical, texture characteristics and consumer acceptance. The physicochemical characteristics and sensorial properties of the xiquexique cookies were evaluated in a pursuit to identify an innovative bakery ingredient with high nutritional value and potential function that could be exploited by the food industry. The water activity and moisture values were low, which can provide greater stability during storage of food matrices, such as cookies. The xiquexique cookies had greater ash (2.47–2.74%), protein (0.94–1.36%), fiber (4.41–8.10%), and resistant starch (3.65–2.10%) contents than their respective controls with 100% wheat flour. The functional cookies were rich in minerals: mainly calcium, iron, potassium, magnesium and manganese and can be consumed by all individuals to help meet daily needs, especially those of people who have increased needs for these essential nutrients. In addition to the darker color of the xiquexique cookies, the hardness of these was higher than that of the control cookies, while the expansion index was smaller. The data from the Check All That Apply sensory method, which consists of a test used mainly for recipe adjustments and the development of ideal food products, confirmed that xiquexique flour have the potential for the development of bakery products such as cookies."
https://openalex.org/W3192839163,"The sensitivity of cotton to salt stress depends on the genotypes and salt types. Understanding the mechanism of ion homeostasis under different salt stresses is necessary to improve cotton performance under saline conditions. A pot experiment using three salt stresses saline stress (NaCl+Na2SO4), alkaline stress (Na2CO3+NaHCO3), and saline-alkaline stress (NaCl+Na2SO4+Na2CO3+NaHCO3) and two cotton varieties (salt-tolerant variety L24 and salt-sensitive variety G1) was conducted. The growth, ion concentrations, and Na+ transport-related gene expression in the cotton varieties were determined. The inhibitory effects of saline-alkaline stress on cotton growth were greater than that of either saline stress or alkaline stress alone. The root/shoot ratio under alkaline stress was significantly lower than that under saline stress. The salt-tolerant cotton variety had lower Na and higher K concentrations in the leaves, stems and roots than the salt-sensitive variety under different salt stresses. For the salt-sensitive cotton variety, saline stress significantly inhibited the absorption of P and the transport of P, K, and Mg, while alkaline stress and saline-alkaline stress significantly inhibited the uptake and transport of P, K, Ca, Mg, and Zn. Most of the elements in the salt-tolerant variety accumulated in the leaves and stems under different salt stresses. This indicated that the salt-tolerant variety had a stronger ion transport capacity than the salt-sensitive variety under saline conditions. Under alkaline stress and salt-alkaline stress, the relative expression levels of the genes GhSOS1, GhNHX1 and GhAKT1 in the salt-tolerant variety were significantly higher than that in the salt-sensitive variety. These results suggest that this salt-tolerant variety of cotton has an internal mechanism to maintain ionic homeostasis."

The present study aimed to develop a German version of the DAAPGQ and evaluate its psychometric properties and validity within a representative sample of the German general population (N = 2531). The German-language DAAPGQ was developed using a forward-backward translation procedure. Then, a subsample of individuals who reported having lost a significant other (N = 1371) of a representative sample was assessed with the German DAAPGQ, along with information on sociodemographic characteristics, prolonged grief symptom severity (PG-13), general anxiety (GAD-2) and depression (PHQ-2). The factor structure of the DAAPGQ was evaluated using confirmatory factor analyses, reliability by calculating internal consistency on subscale level and convergent validity by correlations between DAAPQG subscale sores with PG-13, GAD-2 and PHQ-2 sum scores. As expected, a two-factor model with correlated latent variables showed good fit to the data, replicating findings from the original version. Internal consistency was high for both subscales (Cronbach’s α .86 and .95, respectively). Convergent validity was established by theoretically expected and statistically significant positive correlations of DAAPGQ subscales with symptom severity of prolonged grief, depression, and anxiety and negative correlations with time since loss. Furthermore, the addition of depressive and anxious avoidance significantly improved the prediction of prolonged grief symptom severity over sociodemographic and loss-related information. In sum, our results suggest that the German-language DAAPGQ is a reliable and valid measure of depressive and anxious avoidance and a useful tool to improve our knowledge on the role of avoidance in prolonged grief. We also provide descriptive data to improve the applicability of the DAAPGQ for individual diagnostics."

Human antibodies that target the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-binding domain of the viral spike protein are a target for serodiagnosis and therapeutics. This study aimed to characterize the classes and subclasses of antibody responses to a recombinant receptor-binding protein (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients and investigated the reactivity of these antibodies in patients with other tropical infections and healthy individuals in Thailand. ELISAs for IgM, IgA, IgG and IgG subclasses based on RBD antigen were developed and tested with time series of 27 serum samples from 15 patients with COVID-19 and 60 samples from pre-COVID-19 outbreaks including acute dengue fever, murine typhus, influenza, leptospirosis and healthy individuals. Both RBD-specific IgA and IgG were detected in only 21% of the COVID-19 patients in the acute phase. The median IgA and IgG levels were significantly higher in the convalescent serum sample compared to the acute serum sample ( P &lt; 0.05). We observed the highest correlation between levels of IgG and IgA (rho = 0. 92). IgG1 and IgG3 were the major IgG subclasses detected in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Only acute IgG3 level was negatively associated with viral detection based on RT-PCR of ORF1ab gene (rho = -0.57). The median IgA and IgG levels in convalescence sera of COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than healthy individuals and convalescent sera of other febrile infectious patients. The analyses of antibody classes and subclasses provide insights into human immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 during natural infection and interpretation of antibody assays."
https://openalex.org/W3187804398,"The life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLWH) remains shorter than that of the general population, despite significant improvement in the recent years. Mortality in HIV-infected individuals may be associated with a higher viral load at of diagnosis, a lower CD4 count, or clinical variables such as sex or route of transmission. This article investigated the role of the HLA-B*5701 varian on mortality among PLWH.Material for the analysis consist of the data of 2,393 patients for whom the HLA-B*57 variant was known. Those patients were followed under the care of the Infectious Diseases Hospital in Warsaw (n = 1555) and the Clinic of Acquired Immunodeficiency of the Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin (n = 838). Factors such as age, gender, date of HIV diagnosis, route of transmission, date of death, baseline HIV viral load and baseline CD4 counts, were collected, and end-point cross-sectional analyses were marked at 60, 120, 180 and 240 month of observation.HLA-B*5701 allele was found in 133 (5.5%) analyzed cases. Median age was notably higher for HLA-B*5701 positive patients [32.7 (28.3-41.3) vs. 31.6 (26.8-38.3)years p = 0.02]. HLA-B*5701 was associated with lower baseline viral load [4.21 (3.5-4.8) vs. 4.79 (4.2-5.3)log copies/ml p<0.001] and higher CD4count [448 (294.5-662) vs. 352 (176-514) cells/μl p<0.001]. There were no association between HLA-B*5701 and survival for any given end-point. Higher mortality was associated to male gender, intravenous drug users, lower CD4 count at baseline and higher baseline viral load.In our study, the presence of HLA-B*5701 allel was not associated with mortality rate of HIV infected patients, irrespective of being associated with both higher baseline CD4 + cell count and lower baseline HIV viral load."
https://openalex.org/W3187968099,"Background Fetal growth restriction (FGR), defined as a fetus failing to reach its genetic growth potential, remains poorly diagnosed antenatally. This study aimed to assess the ability of continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound of the umbilical artery (CWD-UmA) to detect FGR in healthy women with low-risk pregnancies. Methods and findings This prospective longitudinal descriptive cohort study enrolled infants born to low-risk mothers who were screened with CWD-UmA between 28–34 weeks’ gestation; the resistance index (RI) was classified as normal or abnormal. Infants were assessed at 6, 10, 14 weeks, and 6 months postnatally for anthropometric indicators and body composition using the deuterium dilution method to assess fat-free mass (FFM). Neonates in the abnormal RI group were compared with those in the normal RI group, and neonates classified as small-for-gestational age (SGA) were compared with appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) neonates. Eighty-one term infants were included. Only 6 of 26 infants (23.1%) with an abnormal RI value would have been classified as SGA. The abnormal RI group had significantly reduced mean FFM and FFM-for-age Z-scores at 6, 10, 14 weeks, and 6 months compared with the normal RI group (P&lt;0.015). The SGA group’s FFM did not show this consistent trend when compared to AGA FFM, being significantly different only at 6 months (P = 0.039). The main limitation of the study was the small sample size of the infant follow-up. Conclusions Abnormal RI obtained from CWD-UmA is able to detect FGR and is considered a useful addition to classifying the neonate only by SGA or AGA at birth."

https://openalex.org/W3192154006,"Selective fetal restriction growth (sFGR) is one of the common diseases of monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancies, resulting in many adverse outcomes. At present, second trimester ultrasonography is widely used in the prenatal diagnosis of sFGR, but the diagnostic effectiveness is still uncertain. The aim of this study is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of second trimester Doppler ultrasound measurements for sFGR.A retrospective study included 280 pregnant women (118 with and 162 without sFGR) with MCDA pregnancies was conducted in the fetal medicine center from Leiden University Medical Center from January 2008 to December 2013. The women participating had already undergone an ultrasound examination in the second trimester. The postnatal criteria of sFGR was a single birth weight (BW) < 3 rd percentile in a twin, or birth weight discordance (BWD)≥25% between two twins, while the BW of the smaller twin < 10th percentile. Early prenatal diagnosis of sFGR was defined as a single EFW < 3 rd percentile in a twin, or at least 2 of the following 4 parameters must be met (fetal weight of one fetus < 10th percentile, AC of one fetus <10th percentile, EFW discordance≥25%, UA pulsatility index (PI) of the smaller fetus > 95th percentile). According to the diagnosis of sFGR after birth, we evaluate diagnostic effectiveness of Doppler ultrasound in the second trimester for sFGR.Of these 280 participants, the mean age was 32.06 ± 4.76 years. About 43.9% of pregnant women were primiparas. The ability of second trimester Doppler ultrasound to accurately diagnosed sFGR is 75.4%, missed diagnosis rate and the misdiagnosis rate were 24.6% and 10.5% respectively. The ROC curve indicated that the combination of AC discordance, EFW discordance, and small fetal UA blood flow was the best diagnostic indicator of sFGR in MCDA pregnancy with the AUC was 0.882 (95%CI, 0.839-0.926).Second trimester Doppler and ultrasound measurements is an effective method for early prenatal diagnosis of sFGR. The combined indicator of AC discordance, EFW discordance, and the small fetal UA blood flow reaches highest diagnostic value."

Sixteen of the 25 species of native South African figs were sampled for nematode associates using molecular barcoding with three loci (SSU, LSU D2-D3 and mtCOI) and fourteen (93%) were positive for at least one nematode species. Thirty-three putative species of nematodes were identified and classified according to the loci that were amplified and successfully sequenced. Fourteen putative nematode species were classified as Aphelenchoididae, of which nine were identified as Ficophagus from four species of Ficus from the section Galoglychia (i.e., five ex F . burkei including one shared with F . natalensis , one ex F . glumosa , one ex F . lutea , and one ex F . stuhlmannii ) and one species ex F . sur from the section Sycomorus .

It is unknown if iECs can be generated from fibroblasts collected from PAD patients and whether these cells are pro-angiogenic. In this study fibroblasts were collected from four PAD patients undergoing carotid endarterectomies. These cells, and neonatal fibroblasts, were transdifferentiated into iECs using modified mRNA. Endothelial phenotype and pro-angiogenic cytokine secretion were investigated. NOD-SCID mice underwent surgery to induce hindlimb ischaemia in a murine model of PAD. Mice received intramuscular injections with either control vehicle, or 1 × 10 6 neonatal-derived or 1 × 10 6 patient-derived iECs. Recovery in perfusion to the affected limb was measured using laser Doppler scanning. Perfusion recovery was enhanced in mice treated with neonatal-derived iECs and in two of the three patient-derived iEC lines investigated in vivo . Patient-derived iECs can be successfully generated from PAD patients and for specific patients display comparable pro-angiogenic properties to neonatal-derived iECs."
https://openalex.org/W3187570073,"Expressing emotions through various modalities is a crucial function not only for humans but also for robots. The mapping method from facial expressions to the basic emotions is widely used in research on robot emotional expressions. This method claims that there are specific facial muscle activation patterns for each emotional expression and people can perceive these emotions by reading these patterns. However, recent research on human behavior reveals that some emotional expressions, such as the emotion “intense”, are difficult to judge as positive or negative by just looking at the facial expression alone. Nevertheless, it has not been investigated whether robots can also express ambiguous facial expressions with no clear valence and whether the addition of body expressions can make the facial valence clearer to humans. This paper shows that an ambiguous facial expression of an android can be perceived more clearly by viewers when body postures and movements are added. We conducted three experiments and online surveys among North American residents with 94, 114 and 114 participants, respectively. In Experiment 1, by calculating the entropy, we found that the facial expression “intense” was difficult to judge as positive or negative when they were only shown the facial expression. In Experiments 2 and 3, by analyzing ANOVA, we confirmed that participants were better at judging the facial valence when they were shown the whole body of the android, even though the facial expression was the same as in Experiment 1. These results suggest that facial and body expressions by robots should be designed jointly to achieve better communication with humans. In order to achieve smoother cooperative human-robot interaction, such as education by robots, emotion expressions conveyed through a combination of both the face and the body of the robot is necessary to convey the robot’s intentions or desires to humans."
https://openalex.org/W3189153302,"Torque Teno Virus (TTV) is a small, non-enveloped, single-stranded and circular DNA virus that infects the majority of the population worldwide. Increased levels of plasma TTV viral load have been observed in various situations of immune deficiency or dysregulation, and several studies have suggested that TTV levels may be inversely correlated with immune competence. The measurement of TTV viremia by qPCR has been proposed as a potential biomarker for the follow-up of functional immune competence in immunosuppressed individuals, particularly hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. We hypothesized that TTV viral load could be used as a prognostic marker of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) efficacy, and therefore investigated the TTV viral load in melanoma patients treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab before and after 6 months of treatment. In the present study, TTV viral load was not different in melanoma patients before anti-PD-1 introduction compared to healthy volunteers, was not modified by ICI treatment and did not allowed to distinguish patients with treatment-sensitive tumor from patients with treatment-resistant tumor."

https://openalex.org/W3191092064,"The study aimed to model and quantify the health burden induced by four non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Egypt, the first to be conducted in the context of a less developing county. The study used the State-Space model and adopted two Bayesian methods: Particle Filter and Particle Independent Metropolis-Hastings to model and estimate the NCDs’ health burden trajectories. We drew on time-series data of the International Health Metric Evaluation, the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS) Annual Bulletin of Health Services Statistics, the World Bank, and WHO data. Both Bayesian methods showed that the burden trajectories are on the rise. Most of the findings agreed with our assumptions and are in line with the literature. Previous year burden strongly predicts the burden of the current year. High prevalence of the risk factors, disease prevalence, and the disease’s severity level all increase illness burden. Years of life lost due to death has high loadings in most of the diseases. Contrary to the study assumption, results found a negative relationship between disease burden and health services utilization which can be attributed to the lack of full health insurance coverage and the pattern of health care seeking behavior in Egypt. Our study highlights that Particle Independent Metropolis-Hastings is sufficient in estimating the parameters of the study model, in the case of time-constant parameters. The study recommends using state Space models with Bayesian estimation approaches with time-series data in public health and epidemiology research."

This study was aimed at exploring the associations between the risk of presenting a clinically relevant condition involving non-substance-related addictive or dysregulated behaviors (as measured by the MultiCAGE CAD-4 screening), and cannabis abuse/dependence (CAST/SDS) scores, and the role of gender therein. Participants were recruited using stratified probabilistic sampling at the University of Granada. Mann-Whitney's U tests were used to compare male and female students in SDS and CAST scores. Associations between gender and MultiCAGE scores were estimated using the γ ordinal correlation index, and tested with χ2. For each MultiCAGE dimension, a Poisson-family mixed-effects model was built with either SDS or CAST as the main input variable, while controlling for nicotine and alcohol dependence, and relevant sociodemographic variables. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) were computed for SDS/CAST effects, and the significance threshold was family-wise Bonferroni-corrected. Gender differences were significant for cannabis dependence/abuse and all MultiCAGE scores for non-substance-related conditions, with males showing higher risk scores for excessive gambling, excessive internet use, excessive video gaming, and hypersexuality, and females presenting higher scores in dysregulated eating and compulsive buying. Cannabis dependence and abuse were significantly associated with a higher risk of problematic video gaming. These associations were mostly driven by males. Importantly, although risk of problematic video gaming was specifically associated with cannabis abuse/dependence, there was only a weak non-significant association between problematic video gaming and alcohol use scores. Risk of alcohol use problems, in turn, was strongly associated with all other non-substance-related problems (problematic gambling, excessive Internet use, dysregulated eating, compulsive buying, and hypersexuality). These differential associations can cast light on the etiological similarities and dissimilarities between problematic substance use and putative addictive behaviors not involving drugs."
https://openalex.org/W3188326596,"Captive cheetahs often demonstrate a high incidence of diseases in which vitamin A imbalances are implicated. These can occur even under controlled and optimised feeding regimens, which is why surveillance of vitamin A status is mandatory in the successful health management of cheetahs. Serum levels of the vitamin do not reflect the true vitamin A status and liver tissue analysis is rather impractical for routine application in large felids. A biomarker for evaluating overt and subclinical vitamin A deficiency in cheetahs is needed. This study evaluates whether increased calvarial bone thickness can be detected on routine skull radiographs of vitamin A deficient cheetahs compared to unaffected animals, and secondly, evaluates whether there is increased bone thickness in clinically sound captive cheetahs in general compared to wild-living controls. Bone thickness in the neuro- and splanchnocranium was measured in 138 skull radiographs. Significant thickening of the parietal bones was found in latero-lateral radiographs of immature cheetahs (< 12 months) with vitamin A deficiency. This finding may allow a presumptive diagnosis of hypovitaminosis A in immature cheetahs. A general difference in skull thickness between free-living and captive cheetahs was not found."

Here, our approach is designed for a classroom environment; we begin with a warm-up exercise introducing counter-intuitive aspects of rotational motion before proceeding to a set of model collision problems that are applied to martial arts movements. Finally, we develop a deformable solid-body mechanics model of a martial arts practitioner suitable for an intermediate mechanics course. We provide evidence for our improved model based on calculations from biomechanical data obtained from prior reports as well as time-lapse images of several different kicks. In addition to incorporating angular motion, our model explicitly makes reference to friction between foot and ground as an action-reaction pair, showing that this interaction provides the motive force/torque for nearly all martial arts movements. Moment-of-inertia tensors are developed to describe kicking movements and show that kicks aimed high, towards the head, transfer more momentum to the target than kicks aimed lower, e.g. towards the body."
https://openalex.org/W3192106113,"The number of elderly patients undergoing major surgery is rapidly increasing. They are particularly at risk of developing postoperative neurocognitive disorders (NCD). Earlier studies suggested that processed electroencephalographic (EEG) monitors may reduce the incidence of postoperative NCD. However, none of these studies controlled for intraoperative nociception levels or personalized blood pressure targets. Their results remain unclear if the reduction in the incidence of postoperative NCD relates to avoidance of any electroencephalographic pattern suggesting excessive anesthesia depth.The objective of this trial is to investigate-in patients ≥ 70 years old undergoing major non-cardiac surgery-the effect of EEG-guided anesthesia on postoperative NCD while controlling for intraoperative nociception, personalized blood pressure targets, and using detailed information provided by the EEG monitor (including burst suppression ratio, density spectral array, and raw EEG waveform).This prospective, randomized, controlled trial will be conducted in a single Canadian university hospital. Patients ≥ 70 years old undergoing elective major non-cardiac surgery will be included in the trial. The administration of sevoflurane will be adjusted to maintain a BIS index value between 40 and 60, to keep a Suppression Ratio (SR) at 0%, to keep a direct EEG display without any suppression time and a spectrogram with most of the EEG wave frequency within the alpha, theta, and delta frequencies in the EEG-guided group. In the control group, sevoflurane will be administered to achieve an age-adjusted minimum alveolar concentration of [0.8-1.2]. In both groups, a nociception monitor will guide intraoperative opioid administration, individual blood pressure targets will be used, and cerebral oximetry used to tailor intraoperative hemodynamic management. The primary endpoint will be the incidence of NCD at postoperative day 1, as evaluated by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Secondary endpoints will include the incidence of postoperative NCD at different time points and the evaluation of cognitive trajectories up to 90 days after surgery among EEG-guided and control groups.NCT04825847 on ClinicalTrials.gov."
