https://openalex.org/W1649220013,"Benzidine and related compounds are well known substrates for horseradish peroxidase/H2O2 oxidation. Typically, two different colored products are formed. In this paper, we study the oxidation of 3,5,3',5'-tetramethylbenzidine. The first colored product is a blue charge-transfer complex of the parent diamine and the diimine oxidation product. This species exists in rapid equilibrium with the radical cation. The radical was observed by ESR spectroscopy, and hyperfine splitting constants were determined. Addition of equimolar hydrogen peroxide yields the yellow diimine, which is stable at acid pH. At less than equimolar peroxide, all four species (diamine, radical cation, charge-transfer complex, and diimine) exist in equilibrium. A theoretical analysis of this redox system is presented, including a determination of the extinction coefficients and equilibrium constant for the nonradical species."

https://openalex.org/W1547662205,"An extensive series of ligand complexes of ferric cytochrome P-450-CAM has been examined by UV-visible absorption, magnetic circular dichroism, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy in an attempt to identify the ligand trans to cysteinate in the six-coordinate resting state of the enzyme. Thus, the ligands used have been chosen to serve as models for coordination by potential endogenous amino acids and include alcohol, amide and carboxylate oxygen donors, amine, imidazole and indole nitrogen donors and disulfide, thioether, thiol, and thiolate sulfur donors. As this investigation has been by nature an empirical one, the conclusions are strengthened by the concurrent use of three different spectroscopic techniques. All of the complexes formed except those resulting from thiolate addition display spectroscopic properties that are broadly similar to those of low spin, six-coordinate P-450. Of the sulfur donor adducts, disulfide and thioether-bound P-450 have properties that are different enough in detail to distinguish them from native P-450. While the spectral features of the thiol-bound species and of low spin ferric P-450 are alike, the former are pH dependent due to interconversion to bound thiolate, whereas the latter display essentially no spectral changes with pH. Of the oxygen donor complexes, all but carboxylate have spectra that very closely match those of the resting enzyme. Adducts formed with most nitrogenous ligands, including several imidazole derivatives, exhibit spectra that are sufficiently different from native P-450 to exclude them as candidates for the sixth ligand. Interestingly, the spectral properties of a complex formed with an imidazole derivative having a bulky electron-withdrawing substituent in the alpha position are comparable to those native P-450 except for the line shape of the EPR spectrum. Previously published theoretical work suggests that the spectral differences seen between this imidazole derivative and the other examined are electronic and not steric in origin. As no similar electronic mechanism exists for the protein to reduce the electron-donating ability or histidine, it is felt that coordination of histidine in the sixth position of P-450 can be ruled out. In conclusion, close examination of all spectral data reveals that amino acid analog adducts of P-450-CAM with amides and, in particular, alcohols, produce spectra that almost exactly duplicate those of native P-450 and suggests that the ligand trans to cysteinate in the six-coordinate ferric enzyme has an oxygen donor atom."

https://openalex.org/W1544086249,"The cAMP content of intact cells as well as adenylate cyclase of the membrane-rich particulate fractions was studied with C6 glioma cells that had been exposed to the culture medium supplemented with islet-activating protein (IAP), one of the pertussis toxins. Both the increase in the cellular cAMP content in response to a beta-adrenergic agonist and the stimulation of membrane adenylate cyclase by the beta-agonist and/or GTP were markedly enhanced by the IAP treatment of C6 cells, but no change was induced in affinities of the agonist (or an antagonist) or GTP for their respective sites of action (or binding). The concentration of IAP required for the half-maximal enhancement was as low as 1 pg/ml, when the time of cell exposure to the toxin was prolonged to 18 h. No enhancement was observed for the basal cAMP content or basal enzyme activity, nor was activation of adenylate cyclase by Gpp(NH)p (or NaF) affected by IAP treatment. The Vmax value of a specific and low Km GTPase was significantly smaller in the membranes of IAP-treated cells than in those of control cells. Cholera toxin treatment of cells activated adenylate cyclase without exerting any influence on these IAP actions. Thus, IAP would appear to enhance beta-receptor-coupled stimulation of adenylate cyclase, in a manner distinct from cholera toxin, by rendering more GTP available to the GTP sites on the regulatory subunit of the receptor-enzyme system."

https://openalex.org/W1579921798,"The major type I DNA topoisomerase (topo I) has been purified from HeLa cell nuclei to a homogeneous, monomeric protein (Mr = 100,000). Similar to the nicking-closing enzyme (Mr = 67,000) from rat liver (Been, M. D., and Champoux, J. J. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 78, 2883-2887), HeLa topo I has the following properties: (a) HeLa topo I breaks down single-stranded DNA to smaller fragments, each with an enzyme-linked 3'-phosphoryl end and a free 5'-OH end. This cleavage is not dependent upon protein denaturant or protease treatment. (b) HeLa topo I produces single-stranded DNA circles from linear single-stranded DNA. Such DNA circles are believed to be produced by the intramolecular cyclization of topo I-linked, single-stranded DNA fragments. (c) HeLa topo I-linked, single-stranded fragments (donors) can join covalently to double-stranded DNA possessing a 5'-OH group (acceptors). The donor is transferred to the 5'-OH end of the acceptor, independent of the position of the end (internal nick or end of linear DNA) or the configuration of the end (flush, 5'-protruding, or 5'-recessed end) of the acceptor. (d) HeLa topo I cleavage of single-stranded DNA is site-specific, but no special sequence at the ends of the acceptor molecule is apparently required for a successful heterologous strand transfer. These results suggest that HeLa topo I may be involved in DNA sequence rearrangements in addition to its possible role as a swivelase for transcription and replication."

https://openalex.org/W1527324425,"The Escherichia coli gene purF, coding for 5-phosphoribosylamine:glutamine pyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase (amidophosphoribosyltransferase) was subcloned from a ColE1-purF plasmid into pBR322. Amidophosphoribosyltransferase levels were elevated more than 5-fold in the ColE1-purF plasmid-bearing strain compared to the wild type control, and a further 10- to 13-fold elevation was observed in several pBR322 derivatives. The nucleotide sequence of a 2478-base pair PvuI-HinfI fragment encoding purF was determined. The purF45 structural gene codes for a 56,395 Mr protein chain having 504 amino acid residues. Methionine-1 is removed by processing in vivo leaving cysteine as the NH2-terminal residue. The deduced amino acid sequence was confirmed by comparisons with the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence determined by automated Edman degradation (Tso, J. Y., Hermodson, M. A., and Zalkin, H. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 3532-3536) and amino acid analyses of CNBr peptides including a 4-residue peptide from the CO2H terminus of the enzyme. Nucleotide sequences characteristic of bacterial promoter-operator regions were identified in the 5' flanking region. The coding region appears to be preceded by a 277-297 nucleotide mRNA leader. A deletion removing the putative promoter-operator region results in defective purF expression."

https://openalex.org/W1547460400,"The detergent-insoluble matrix of cultured human fibroblasts contains cytoskeletal and nuclear components, as well as two major, noncollagenous glycoproteins, fibronectin and GP140. These glycoproteins are stabilized by extensive intermolecular disulfide bonding. GP140, in contrast to fibronectin, is resistant to digestion with trypsin and is not cross-reactive with antisera prepared against fibronectin (Carter, W. G., and Hakomori, S. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 6953-6960). GP140 was partially purified, under nonreducing conditions, by differential extraction of trypsinized cells with sodium trichloroacetate. Alternatively, a higher yield of GP140 could be obtained under reducing conditions by extraction with urea-dithiothreitol followed by molecular sieve chromatography in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and dithiothreitol. The purified GP140 contained mannose, galactose, and N-acetylglucosamine residues, totaling 2.7% of the molecule. In addition, mild periodate oxidation of GP140 followed by reduction with NaB3H4 under conditions designed to label sialic acid also labeled the peptide portion of the molecule. Amino acid analysis of GP140 detected periodate-sensitive hydroxylysine residues, as well as hydroxylproline, accounting for the periodate/NaB3H4-induced label in the peptide. These hydroxylated amino acids are major components of collagens and collagen-like proteins. The GP140 isolated under nonreducing conditions was found to induce stable cell attachment and cell spreading when coated on plastic surfaces. The cell attachment could not be inhibited with affinity purified anti-fibronectin antibodies. However, trypsinization of cells under conditions that removed surface fibronectin reduced the ability of the cells to bind to the GP140-coated surface. Metabolic labeling of cells with radioactive glucosamine during 1-h cell attachment experiments incorporated label into both fibronectin and GP140, as well as four other carbohydrate-containing components as part of a stable detergent-insoluble matrix, indicating that the cells rapidly glycosylate both fibronectin and GP140 and incorporate them into the matrix. Long term labeling and chase experiments indicated that fibronectin and GP140 in the matrix are subject to very slow turnover. Neither fibronectin nor GP140 were detectable in the detergent-insoluble matrix of SV40-transformed human fibroblasts by either metabolic or cell surface labeling. These results are consistent with the conclusion that fibronectin and GP140 may function in a cooperative manner in cell adhesion and spreading."
https://openalex.org/W1507678188,"Rabbits fed a wheat starch-casein diet develop a marked hypercholesterolemia with a lipoprotein distribution similar to that of humans. Approximately 76% of the total cholesterol is carried in the low density lipoprotein (LDL) fraction (1.006 less than d less than 1.063 g/ml). Inclusion of 1% cholestyramine in the diet prevents the increase in plasma cholesterol. The cholestyramine effect is mediated through an increased fractional catabolic rate of 125I-LDL. In order to determine the potential role of hepatic LDL receptors in the removal of LDL from the plasma, binding of 125I-LDL and 125I-beta-VLDL (beta-migrating very low density lipoproteins) to hepatic membranes prepared from livers of rabbits fed the wheat starch-casein diet with or without cholestyramine supplementation was investigated. Membranes from livers of the cholestyramine-supplemented animals exhibit high levels of specific EDTA-sensitive binding of either of the 125I-labeled lipoproteins. Very little EDTA-sensitive binding occurs on liver membranes from wheat starch-casein-fed rabbits that have not been treated with cholestyramine. These results indicate that the hypercholesterolemia in rabbits associated with the wheat starch-casein diet is wholly or partially the result of a decreased number of specific hepatic LDL receptors and thus a decreased catabolism of plasma cholesterol. The response of the liver to the inclusion in the diet of the bile acid sequestrant, cholestyramine, is to maintain or increase the number of specific LDL binding sites, thus promoting catabolism of plasma cholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W1525062255,"Fibroblast-derived growth factor (FDGF), a basic, heat- and acid-stable polypeptide partially purified from the serum-free conditioned medium of BHK cells transformed by simian virus 40, is a potent mitogen for Swiss 3T3 cells and causes a marked reduction in 125I-labeled epidermal growth factor (125I-EGF) binding to these cells. The activity which inhibits EGF binding coelutes with the growth-stimulating activity after gel filtration, ion exchange chromatography, and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Both cellular responses are elicited by the same range of FDGF concentration in several murine cell types. The inhibition of EGF binding is rapid and results from a decrease in the apparent affinity of cellular receptors for 125I-EGF. FDGF does not affect the rate of cell-mediated 125I-EGF degradation. Several lines of evidence suggest that FDGF does not bind directly to EGF receptor. First, the effect of FDGF is dependent on the temperature of the assay; furthermore, treatment of cells with EGF results in loss of EGF receptors while exposure to FDGF for up to 24 h does not induce down-regulation of EGF receptors. Further, in A431 cells which display a large number of specific EGF receptors, 125I-EGF binding is not sensitive to FDGF. Finally, the effect of FDGF on 125I-EGF binding is not observed with isolated plasma membranes. Taken together, these findings suggest that FDGF binds to sites which are separate from EGF receptors. The results show a novel mechanism whereby a growth-promoting factor produced by a tumor cell line can rapidly modulate the affinity of the cellular receptors for EGF in an indirect manner."
https://openalex.org/W1604652736,"Isoproterenol incubated with turkey erythrocyte membranes causes exposure of a specific --SH in a component associated with the beta-adrenergic receptor, presumably in the guanyl nucleotide binding protein. Addition of a reagent which interacts with that specific --SH results in trapping of the hormone in the receptor. As a consequence, the number of hormone binding sites and the function of the receptor are both drastically reduced. Extended incubation at alkaline pH or addition of GDP or GTP at high concentration reactivate the beta-adrenergic receptor. Labeled antagonist binding as well as function of the receptor in activating an adenylate cyclase system are restored. The findings suggest that the normal interaction of the hormone-receptor complex with the guanyl nucleotide binding protein involves a conformational change which transiently locks the hormone in the receptor. GTP releases the tight interaction while addition of an --SH reagent traps the ternary complex of hormone-receptor-guanyl nucleotide binding protein in the locked conformation. Since the components of different hormone-activated adenylate cyclase systems were shown to be interchangeable, it seems likely that the hormone-receptor interaction with the guanyl nucleotide binding protein, as revealed in the present study, is not limited to beta-adrenergic receptor systems."
https://openalex.org/W1593259671,"Cyclic AMP-independent casein kinase-2 from rabbit skeletal muscle has been extensively purified by procedures including phosphocellulose, Bio-Gel A-1.5m, casein-Sepharose, and DEAE-cellulose column chromatographies. The casein kinase and glycogen synthase kinase activities are co-purified throughout the purification. The casein kinase-2 has Mr approximately equal to 135,000 as determined by glycerol density gradient centrifugation and by gel filtration. Analysis of the purified kinase by gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate reveals the presence of two major protein bands having Mr = 42,000 and 27,000 in a ratio of 0.85:1. The kinase phosphorylates glycogen synthase, casein, and phosvitin either in the presence of ATP or GTP; however, the Km values for GTP are slightly higher than those of ATP. The activity of this kinase is inhibited by heparin but is not affected by the addition of cyclic AMP, heat-stable inhibitor of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, Ca2+, ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, or the combination of Ca2+ and calmodulin. The phosphorylation of the synthase by the kinase results in the incorporation of approximately 0.8 mol of PO4/subunit and a reduction in the synthase activity ratio from 0.82 to 0.6. The extent of phosphorylation of the synthase catalyzed by casein kinase-2 is similar to that by phosphorylase kinase; however, the sites phosphorylated by these two kinases are different. The relationships of casein kinase-2 to the cyclic AMP-independent synthase kinases that have been described by other laboratories and to the casein kinases isolated from other tissues are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1551598512,"ATP diphosphohydrolase (EC 3.6.1.5) catalyzes the hydrolysis of diphospho- and triphosphonucleosides and is sensitive to divalent cations. In this paper, we investigated the dependence of ATP hydrolysis on the concentration of free Mg2+ and Ca2+ and the cation ATP complexes. The enzyme was isolated from porcine zymogen granule membranes, solubilized in Triton X-100, and purified on a 5'-AMP-Sepharose 4B affinity column resulting in a 1500-fold purification. Free unprotonated ATP4- was hydrolyzed in the presence of ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid. When hydrolysis rate was measured at different concentrations of the cation-ATP complex at constant free cation concentrations, normal hyperbolic curves were obtained. In CaCl2, both Kapp and Vapp increased as free Ca2+ increased from 25 to 1000 microM. In MgCl2, Kapp increased and Vapp decreased as free Mg2+ increased from 25 to 500 microM. From the rapid equilibrium rate equation, Ks and Vmax values of the substrates were calculated. We found that free ATP4-, Ca-ATP2-, and Mg-ATP2- are substrates and free cations do not bind the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1585733340,"The 6 S leader RNA transcript from the Escherichia coli threonine operon controlling region was synthesized in vitro using purified RNA polymerase and restriction fragment DNA templates. The terminated leader transcript was analyzed by RNase T1 digestion followed by electrophoresis on 20% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gels. Oligonucleotides of 7, 8, 13, 15, and 35 bases in length were detected and correlated with the known DNA sequence. The kinetics of RNase T1 digestion indicated that the RNA forms extensive secondary structure, especially at the 3'-terminus of the transcript. The sites of transcription initiation were determined by labeling the 5'-end of the transcript with [gamma-32P]ATP or -GTP followed by direct RNA sequencing. The DNA sequence preceding the initiation site shows homology with the equivalent regions of other bacterial and bacteriophage promoters. The transcription termination sites were determined by mapping of the RNase T1 oligonucleotides arising from the 3'-terminus of the transcript. Comparison of the mobilities of the 3'-oligonucleotides with the mobilities of standards on 20% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gels indicated that the RNA contains a heterogeneous 3'-terminus. The two predominant oligonucleotides were CU7 and CU8. The 3'-terminus of the transcript also contains a region of dyad symmetry immediately preceding a stretch of uridine residues, characteristic of other rho-independent transcripts. In addition, kinetic studies indicated that RNA polymerase pauses approximately 50 base pairs upstream from the site of termination. The pause site appears to be immediately distal to another region of dyad symmetry."

Two recombinant plasmids, pPG14, containing Eco G and the vector pMB9, and pEZC23, containing the chloroplast DNA fragment HindIII B cloned in pBR322 were employed for the study. The tRNA locus was mapped to an 0.8-kbp region of Eco G also present in HindIII B. The DNA sequence of a 1.6 kbp from HindIII B, containing the entire tRNA gene locus was determined. Four tRNA genes were identified from the DNA sequence. The gene organization is tRNAVal-16 bp spacer-tRNAAsn-3 bp spacer-tRNAArg-45 bp spacer-tRNALeu. The tRNALeu gene is of the opposite polarity as the other three genes. This is the first evidence of such a tRNA cluster for a chloroplast genome.

The enzyme is a single polypeptide chain with a native Mr = 64,000 with a Km of 1.66 microM and Vmax of 1.25 mumol/min. AMP, ADP, Ap4, GTP, Gp4, Ap3A, Ap5A, Gp3G, and Gp5G are noncompetitive inhibitors of the Ap4A hydrolase activity, whereas Gp4G inhibits Ap4A hydrolysis competitively with a Ki of 6 microM. Theophylline, caffeine, and isobutylmethylxanthine do not or only slightly inhibit Ap4A hydrolysis. Mitogenic factors have no effect on the enzymatic activity of Ap4A hydrolase, excluding that a direct influence of internalized mitogens on Ap4A degradation could be responsible for mitogen-dependent fluctuation of intracellular Ap4A pool sizes."
https://openalex.org/W1532323675,"Among the protein kinases associated with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), one was identified by immunoprecipitation to be pp60src, the transformation-specific product coded for by avian sarcoma virus, or its endogenous cellular homolog. This activity phosphorylated only tyrosine. pp60src was enriched in the membranes, whereas the serine- and threonine-specific kinases were concentrated with viral cores. The content of pp60src in VSV can be manipulated by growing VSV in different host cells. Monolayer baby hamster kidney cells transformed by an avian sarcoma virus produced VSV progeny which contained 7-fold greater pp60src activity than progeny produced by control untransformed or revertant cells. In contrast, suspension cultures of baby hamster kidney cells which produced VSV with increased tyrosine-specific kinase activity did not affect the content of pp60src. When pp60src was specifically increased in cells, the endogenous phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the VSV matrix M protein was also enhanced, to as much as 20-fold. The phosphorylation of serine or threonine in this protein or in the other VSV phosphoprotein NS was not affected. Cellular tyrosine-specific kinases other than pp60scr did not change the overall phosphorylation pattern of any VSV phosphoproteins. Experiments designed to test the effects of endogenous phosphorylation on the various functions of the M protein failed to detect any significant alterations."
https://openalex.org/W1511102807,"Resolution and reconstitution has been used to examine the involvement of the iron-sulfur protein of the cytochrome b-c1 segment in electron transfer reactions in this region of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The iron-sulfur protein is required for electron transfer from succinate and from ubiquinol to cytochrome c1. It is not required for reduction of cytochrome b under these conditions, but it is required for oxidation of cytochrome b by cytochrome c plus cytochrome c oxidase. Removal of the iron-sulfur protein from the b-c1 complex prevents reduction of both cytochromes b and c1 by succinate or ubiquinol if antimycin is added to the depleted complex. As increasing amounts of iron-sulfur protein are reconstituted to the depleted complex, the amounts of cytochromes b and c1 reduced by succinate in the presence of antimycin increase and closely parallel the amounts of ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity restored to the reconstituted complex, measured before addition of antimycin. The function of the iron-sulfur protein in these oxidation-reduction reactions is consistent with a cyclic pathway of electron transfer through the cytochrome b-c1 complex, in which the iron-sulfur protein functions as a ubiquinol-cytochrome c1/ubisemiquinone-cytochrome b oxidoreductase."
https://openalex.org/W1563853646,"A synthetic pentadecapeptide, Pro-Leu-Ser-Arg-Thr-Leu-Ser-Val-Ser-Ser-Leu-Pro-Gly-Leu-Glu, corresponding to the phosphorylatable site at the NH2 terminus of glycogen synthase, could be phosphorylated stoichiometrically at seryl residue 7 by both phosphorylase kinase and cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Phosphorylation of seryl residue 3 also occurred after prolonged incubation with cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Kinetic studies show that the pentadecapeptide is a better substrate for phosphorylase kinase. A peptide consisting of residues 1-11 was not as good a substrate and substitution of Arg-4 by Lys and Ser-9 by ARg in the unidecapeptide decreased and increased phosphorylase kinase reaction rates, respectively. Higher rates of phosphorylation were obtained with peptides of the phosphorylatable site of phosphorylase. A peptide with the sequence, Leu-Ser-Tyr-Arg-Arg-Tyr-Ser-Leu was phosphorylated initially by phosphorylase kinase and cAMP-dependent protein kinase at Ser-2 and Ser-7, respectively. Upon longer incubation, second site phosphorylation occurred with both kinases. A peptide of the same sequence with D-amino acids could not be phosphorylated but was a competitive inhibitor of both enzymes. The results suggest that optimal interaction of the two kinases depends on various factors including the orientation of arginyl groups with respect to the phosphorylatable serine."

The concentration of [3H]H2DIDS that inhibits transport activity by 50% is 35 microM. Glucose-6-P protected against the inhibition of transport activity caused by [3H]H2DIDS; mannose-6-P, 2-deoxyglucose-6-P, galactose-6-P, fructose-6-P, or glycerol-2-P did not. [3H]H2DIDS-treated microsomes were solubilized in sodium dodecyl sulfate and the microsomal polypeptides were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Labeled polypeptides were identified by autoradiography. Treatment of microsomes with concentrations of [3H]H2DIDS (50-100 microM) that resulted in maximal inhibition of transport activity allowed the identification of two microsomal polypeptides that contained most of the incorporated radioactivity. Their molecular weights were 54,000 and 59,000. The labeling of the former, but not the latter polypeptide was saturable and correlated linearly with the level of inhibition of transport activity. Concomitantly with its protective effect on translocase activity, the presence of glucose-6-P during the reaction with [3H]H2DIDS resulted in a significant increase in the amount of label incorporated into this peptide. This stimulation of labeling was specific for glucose-6-P. These results implicate the 54,000-dalton polypeptide as an obligatory component of the rat liver microsomal glucose-6-P translocase."

An analog of the bovine parathyroid hormone(1-34) sequence was derivatized at the 23-tryptophan position with the photoreactive reagent 2-nitro-5-azidophenylsulfenyl chloride. 2-Nitro-5-azidophenylsulfenyl-bovine parathyroid hormone (NAPS-bPTH) analog retained full biological activity with respect to receptor binding and activation of adenylate cyclase in canine renal cortical plasma membranes. 125I-bPTH(1-34) analog was also derivatized without loss of receptor-binding activity. When 125I-NAPS-bPTH(1-34) analog was incubated with canine renal plasma membranes and then photolyzed, at least two 125I-labeled membrane components were identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The incorporation of 125I radioactivity into one of these components (Mr congruent to 60,000) was inhibited when incubation and photolysis were performed in the presence of excess, unlabeled bPTH(1-34). Furthermore, photolysis of membranes in the presence of NAPS-bPTH(1-34) analog led to activation of adenylate cyclase which persisted following washing to remove noncovalently bound peptide, suggesting a functional, covalent hormone-receptor complex had been formed. We conclude that the M r congruent to 60,000 membrane component may be a part of the renal receptor for parathyroid hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1595816209,"A 93,000 molecular weight protein (HBP.93) which binds hemin and protoporphyrin IX with high affinity has been isolated from rabbit serum using affinity chromatography on hemin-conjugated agarose. The amino acid composition of this protein is unique in that the proline and histidine contents are remarkably high (16.6 and 9.9 mol %, respectively). A large increase in the absorbance of the Soret region arises from the heme-protein interaction. The spectrophotometric titration showed that the protein can bind 25-35 mol of hemin/mol of protein. The apparent dissociation constant was estimated to be 1-4 X 10(-7) M for hemin at pH 7.4 and approximately 10(-6) M for protoporphyrin IX at pH 9.2. The similarity of the difference spectrum of heme-HBP.93 complex to that of heme-hemopexin complex suggests that a bisimidazol-type coordination of heme iron is involved in the binding. The extremely high capacity of HBP.93 to bind heme is also demonstrated by a large increase in the sedimentation velocity of the protein upon heme binding. The native heme-protein complex migrates faster than the heme-free protein in a polyacrylamide gel at pH 8.8; the increased mobility appears to be due to the charge on the carboxyl groups of the bound heme. Although the use of a hemin-agarose column has failed to reveal a protein of similar size and heme affinity in the sera of a number of other species, including man, the heme-binding properties and high histidine level of the human alpha 2-histidine-rich glycoprotein raise the possibility that the two proteins are related."

The Co--O--O bond angle was determined to be 125 degrees +/- 5 degrees for oxyprotocobalt myoglobin, and 153 degrees +/- 5 degrees for oxymesocobalt myoglobin at ambient temperature. This result suggests that differences in stereochemical interactions of the modified 2,4-side chains of porphyrin with protein contribute to the ligand orientations as well as the altered ligand-binding behavior in these hemoproteins. Upon freezing, two unequivalent orientations of the O--O axis (species I and II) were found in both oxycobalt myoglobin single crystals. Shifts of the resonance spectra of these species were observed below the freezing point of the crystals. The signal intensities of two paramagnetic species in oxyprotocobalt myoglobin were approximately equivalent (I congruent to II), whereas those in oxymesocobalt myoglobin were quite different (I greater than II) at 77 K. The present electron paramagnetic resonance studies demonstrate that changes in the bonding structure of Co--O2 are induced upon freezing the biological macromolecule, including the movement of the residues of the heme environment."
https://openalex.org/W1572171314,"A cyclic AMP-binding protein with a native molecular weight calculated to be 82,000 was purified 2,000-fold from Neurospora crassa. The apparent subunit molecular weight was 47,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, suggesting that the native protein exists as a dimer of identically sized subunits. The 8-N3-cyclic [32P]AMP-labeled protein appeared as a doublet upon two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, with pI = 5.4 and 5.5. Binding studies with both noncyclic and cyclic nucleotides showed cyclic AMP to have the highest binding affinity. The KD for cyclic AMP was 300 nM at 23 degrees C. The cyclic AMP-binding protein has two distinct cyclic AMP binding sites, a slowly dissociating site and a rapidly dissociating site. The cyclic AMP analog, 8-bromo cyclic AMP, was found to bind preferentially the slowly dissociating cyclic AMP binding site. The cyclic AMP-binding protein is thought to be the regulatory subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase based upon the findings that it co-purifies with this protein kinase activity upon DEAE-cellulose chromatography, isoelectric focusing, and cyclic AMP affinity resin chromatography. On purification by the latter two procedures, no other cyclic AMP-binding activity was detected. A number of similarities between the Neurospora cyclic AMP-binding protein and the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory subunits from yeast and mammalian tissue are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1505334499,"Abstract In yeast, the mitochondrial genes for subunit I of cytochrome oxidase (oxi3) and for apocytochrome b (cob) are known to be split. In some strains, the latter contains five intervening sequences, three of which coincide with clusters of mutational sites referred to in their order of transcription as the loci box3, 10, and 7, respectively. Mutations at the first of these result in the accumulation of novel, large polypeptides (apparent Mr congruent to 43,000) believed to originate from a fusion of sequences found in the NH2-terminal segment of apocytochrome b to others encoded in the intervening sequence itself. We now provide evidence for close similarities of at least a part of translated intron sequences between (a) mutants in box7 in long form and short form strains (which lack the first three introns including the one for the box3 locus); (b) mutants in a subset of box7 mutants and those in box3, and (c) between intron sequences in box7 and a sequence presumably encoded in oxi3. These structural homologies have been analyzed and shown to be referable to sequence homologies in two proteins, one derived from the second intron (box3) in cob and the other from oxi3. The accumulation in certain cob mutants of proteins and of a transcript containing a sequence specified by oxi3 provides additional strong evidence for the previously suggested regulation of oxi3 by the penultimate, box7-containing intron of cob."
https://openalex.org/W1565697690,"Dolichyl phosphate is an intermediate in the glycosylation of N-glycosamidic linked glycoproteins in mammalian systems, and its availability may be a limiting factor in glycoprotein biosynthesis. The basic kinetics and subcellular distribution of enzymes which may influence the concentration of dolichyl phosphate in rat liver have therefore been investigated. These include dolichyl phosphate phosphatase, dolichol phosphokinase, dolichyl fatty acyl ester synthetase, GDP-mannose dolichyl phosphate mannosyl transferase, and UDP-glucose dolichyl phosphate glucosyl transferase. The specific activity of the enzymes was highest in the microsomes, except for dolichyl phosphate phosphatase and dolichyl fatty acyl ester synthetase, which were most concentrated in the plasma membrane and the cytosol fraction, respectively. The nuclei contained all of the enzyme activities while the mitochondria and cytoplasm were generally less active. The presence of both dolichol phosphokinase and dolichyl phosphate phosphatase in microsomes and nuclei, which contain the highest glycosyl transferase activities, may provide a means for direct enzymatic control of levels of dolichyl phosphate."

https://openalex.org/W1503516357,"The locations of transfer RNA genes with respect to the restriction endonuclease cleavage map of Euglena gracilis Klebs, strain Z Pringsheim chloroplast DNA have been determined. Purified chloroplast tRNAs were treated with snake venom phosphodiesterase to remove the 3'-CCA terminus, and radioactively labeled by the action of Escherichia coli tRNA nucleotidyltransferase in the presence of [alpha-32P]CTP. Chloroplast DNA was treated individually and with combinations of the enzymes Bal I, Bam HI, Eco RI, Pst I, Pvu II, Sal I, and Xho I. The location of tRNA genes with respect to the cleavage sites for these enzymes was determined by hybridization of the 32P-labeled tRNAs to membrane filter blots of the chloroplast DNA restriction nuclease fragments following gel electrophoresis. The 145-kilobase pair genome was resolved into nine areas of strong tRNA hybridization, separated by areas of weak or no tRNA hybridization. The loci of tRNA genes are within the Eco RI fragments Eco A, B, G, H, I, J', P, Q, and V."
https://openalex.org/W1525173832,"Ligands in the first coordination sphere of Mn(II) in the complex of MnADP with myosin subfragment 1 from rabbit skeletal muscle have been investigated. EPR spectroscopy was used to detect superhyperfine coupling between unpaired electrons of the metal ion and the nuclei of oxygen atoms specifically labeled with oxygen 17. The results show that ADP is a beta-monodentate ligand for Mn(II) and that there are probably two water oxygens directly bound to Mn(II). The inhibitory complex of vanadate with subfragment 1 . MnADP was also investigated. Vanadate-dependent changes in the EPR spectra for enzyme-bound Mn(II) indicate that the coordination sphere of MN(II) changes upon binding of vanadate. ADP remains a beta-monodenate ligand in the complex and experiments with 17O-labeled water indicate that two oxygen atoms originally in water are ligands in the complex. However, the oxygens of vanadate equilibrate with those of water during sample preparation so that one of these ligands may be a vanadate oxygen. Three additional ligands, probably from the protein, are required to complete the sextet of ligands to Mn(II) in both complexes studied."

The crystals, all of which are grown from polyethylene glycol 4000 at low ionic strength, diffract to high resolution and would seem to provide another opportunity for the direct visualization of a protein-nucleic acid interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1525716142,"The heme iron of horse heart cytochrome c was selectively removed using anhydrous HF. The product, porphyrin c, exhibits the viscosity, far ultraviolet circular dichroic, and fluorescence properties characteristic for native cytochrome c. However, porphyrin c is more susceptible to denaturation by guanidine hydrochloride and by heat than is the parent cytochrome. All of the conformational parameters of porphyrin c exhibit a common reversible transition centered at 0.95 m guanidine hydrochloride at 23 degrees C and pH 7.0. Guanidine denatured porphyrin c refolds in two kinetic phases having time constants of 20 and 200 ms as detected by stopped flow absorbance or fluorescence measurement, with about 80% of the observed change in the faster phase. The kinetics of porphyrin c refolding are not significantly altered by increasing the viscosity of the refolding solvent 15-fold by addition of sucrose. We suggest that the folding of guanidine denatured cytochrome c is not a diffusion-limited process and that the requirement for protein axial ligation elicits the slow (s) kinetic phase observed in the refolding of cytochrome c."
