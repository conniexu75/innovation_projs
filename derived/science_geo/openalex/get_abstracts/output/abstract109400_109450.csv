https://openalex.org/W1590376803,"To demonstrate the presence of de novo synthesis in central mammalian neurons, we cloned and sequenced a rabbit insulin cDNA from pancreas and used it to define sequences encoding insulin mRNA from postnatal rabbit brain. We observed transcription/elongation of nascent insulin transcripts, characterized the size of these transcripts, and localized them to specific neurons in certain catecholaminergic-rich areas of the central nervous system. RNase protection assays using a rabbit probe spanning a region from 14 bases 5' to the translation start site through all but 18 bases of the sequence encoding the A-chain of insulin showed two bands in rabbit brain RNA and only one band in pancreas. The larger band in brain was the same size as that in pancreatic RNA; the other was approximately 10 bases shorter. Because the sequence of a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction product from brain RNA was identical to pancreatic RNA sequence in the region corresponding to the 3' region of the probe, the smaller band in brain is most consistent with a sequence mismatch in some brain mRNA in the region corresponding to the 5'-end of the probe. In situ hybridization localized insulin mRNA to anatomical regions involved with olfaction and higher association of the limbic system. High performance liquid chromatography, radioimmunoassay, and [35S]cysteine metabolic labeling of cultured neuronal and glial cells indicated extracellular secretion of immunoprecipitable insulin by neurons only. Presence of insulin transcripts within specific neurons with extracellular secretion of the peptide suggests a specialized biological role."
https://openalex.org/W1641382920,"The geminivirus, tomato golden mosaic virus (TGMV), encodes one protein, AL1, that is absolutely required for viral DNA replication. AL1 interacts with the TGMV DNA genome by binding specifically to the viral origin of replication. We have investigated the nature and significance of AL1/origin interactions in vitro and in vivo by using competitive DNA binding and transient replication assays. Competition assays established that a 13-base pair (bp) element (5'-GGTAGTAAGGTAG) containing two 5-bp direct repeat motifs separated by a 3-bp central core constitutes a high affinity AL1 binding site. DNAs containing intact 3' repeat sequences plus core (TAAGGTAG and ccTAGTAAGGTAG) were stronger competitors for AL1 binding than DNAs containing intact 5' repeat sequences plus core (GGTAGTAA and GGTAGTA-AccTAG), thereby demonstrating that AL1 interacts differently with the repeat motifs. Replication in tobacco protoplasts established that the AL1 binding site is an essential cis-acting element for viral replication. No replication was detected for DNAs containing mutations in either of the repeat motifs of the AL1 recognition sequence when AL1 was provided in trans from a plant gene expression vector. In contrast, a DNA with a mutation in the 5' repeat motif (ccTAGTAAGGTAG) replicated when both AL1 and AL3, a TGMV protein involved in viral DNA accumulation, were provided in trans. No replication was detected for a DNA containing a mutation in the 3' repeat motif (GGTAGTAAccTAG) in the presence of AL1 and AL3. The in vitro and in vivo results suggest that binding of AL1 to the 3' repeat element is an essential step in DNA replication, while binding to the 5' repeat element may serve to enhance viral replication."
https://openalex.org/W1520395487,"Cyclic GMP (cGMP) inhibits intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) mobilization in vascular smooth muscle cells by a mechanism that is not well understood. Because several studies suggest that cGMP inhibits inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) action, we examined the effects of cGMP-dependent protein kinase on IP3 receptor phosphorylation. The purified IP3 receptor was phosphorylated using either the cGMP- or cAMP-dependent protein kinase in vitro. Phosphorylation was time-dependent and stoichiometric using both kinases. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping, high performance liquid chromatography analysis, and amino acid analysis showed that identical sites were phosphorylated using either kinase, and identified serine 1755 as the site of phosphorylation. The synthetic peptide corresponding to serine 1755 (GRRESLTSFG) was phosphorylated with aKm in the range of 30-40 microM by both kinases. The kinetic analysis revealed that this peptide substrate is the best substrate described for cGMP kinase to date. Vascular smooth muscle cells prelabeled with [32P]orthophosphate and treated with atrial natriuretic peptide or sodium nitroprusside to elevate cGMP also resulted in increased labeling of the IP3 receptor. Phosphorylation of IP3 receptor by cGMP kinase may regulate the function of IP3 receptor in vascular smooth muscle cells and contribute to the effect of cGMP to regulate intracellular calcium levels."
https://openalex.org/W1496975176,"p55 is a palmitoylated peripheral membrane phosphoprotein of human erythrocytes. Primary structure of p55 includes a single copy of the SH3 motif, a COOH-terminal guanylate kinase domain, and an NH2-terminal domain of unknown function. Although the function of p55 is not known, interest in this component has been heightened by its similarity to the Drosophila tumor suppressor discs-large (dlg). In this report we provide evidence for the direct association of p55 with the NH2-terminal 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1, a key component of the erythroid membrane skeleton. In addition, p55 also binds to the cytoplasmic domain of glycophorin C, a transmembrane protein of red blood cells. We also provide evidence demonstrating the direct association of the 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1 with the cytoplasmic domain of glycophorin C. Taken together, these results suggest the existence of a novel ternary complex at the erythroid plasma membrane involving protein 4.1, p55, and glycophorin C. Since isoforms of protein 4.1, p55, and glycophorin C are present in many non-erythroid cells, the binding interactions may be prototypical of similar associations that modulate cytoskeletal-membrane linkage of broad significance."
https://openalex.org/W1506596865,"Pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone photoproduct is the second most abundant UV photoproduct in DNA. Recently, it was reported that Drosophila melanogaster cell-free extracts restored the biological activity of (6-4) photo-product-containing DNA in a light-dependent reaction (Todo, T., Takemori, H., Ryo, H., Ihara, M., Matsunaga, T., Nikaido, O., Sato, K., and Nomura, T. (1993) Nature 361, 372-374) concomitant with the loss of (6-4) photoproduct antigenic sites and (6-4) photoproduct-caused alkali-labile sites. In the present study we show that the (6-4) photoproduct but not its Dewar isomer is the substrate for the enzyme, that the enzyme has an action spectrum peak at 400 nm, and that the efficiency of repair per incident photon is very low compared with cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photolyases. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the (6-4) photoproduct photolyase converts the photoproduct to unmodified bases probably through an oxetane intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1587059515,"Prostaglandins are synthesized from arachidonic acid by the rate-limiting enzyme cyclooxygenase (prostaglandin G/H synthase). Active cyclooxygenase is encoded by two distinct and independently regulated genes, termed cyclooxygenase-1 (cox1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (cox2). In this investigation, we examined the expression of cox1 and cox2 mRNA in rat aorta following balloon deendothelialization (BDE) in vivo and in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC) after serum stimulation in vitro. Two h after BDE, rat aortic cox2 mRNA levels increased greater than 50-fold relative to the lowest detectable levels on days 2 and 14. No message was detectable in non-BDE control rat aortas. Similar to the results found in vivo, cultured SMC exhibited a greater than 45-fold increase in cox2 mRNA levels after a 2-h exposure to serum. This increase was transient because cox2 levels declined at 4 and 8 h. In contrast, minimal changes in cox1 mRNA levels were observed after BDE or serum treatments. Increased levels of cox2 mRNA and corresponding protein synthesis led to an accumulation of total cyclooxygenase protein, which remained elevated 24 h after serum stimulation. Serum-treated SMC also generated greater amounts of cyclooxygenase-dependent metabolites than quiescent SMC as evidenced by marked increases in prostaglandin E2 content in conditioned media. This increase is associated with a 2.5-3.0-fold increased rate of arachidonic acid conversion to prostaglandin E2. Our data indicate that injury and serum stimulation differentially regulate mRNA and protein expression of two distinct cox genes in vascular SMC in vivo and in vitro. The findings suggest that the prostanoid responses after vascular injury are, in part, mediated by acute increases in cox2 mRNA and cyclooxygenase-2 protein."
https://openalex.org/W1575497848,"Phycobiliproteins carry linear tetrapyrrole chromophores (bilins) thioether-linked to specific cysteine residues. The process of bilin attachment to apoprotein in vivo has been characterized for only one bilin attachment site on one phycobiliprotein, that on the alpha subunit of phycocyanin (alpha PC). In the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, the addition of phycocyanobilin to apo-alpha PC is catalyzed by the protein products of the cpcE and cpcF genes. We have purified and further characterized the recombinant CpcE and CpcF proteins. CpcE and CpcF form an enzymatically active 1:1 complex (CpcEF), stable to size exclusion chromatography. CpcEF causes a reduction in alpha PC fluorescence and strongly affects its absorption spectrum but has no effect on the beta subunit. The CpcEF bilin addition activity exhibits simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to the apo-alpha PC and to bilin. CpcEF also catalyzes the addition of phycoerythrobilin to apo-alpha PC; phycoerythrobilin is thought to be on the biosynthetic pathway of phycocyanobilin. CpcEF shows a preference for phycocyanobilin relative to phycoerythrobilin, both in binding affinity and in the rate of catalysis, sufficient to account for selective attachment of phycocyanobilin to apo-alpha PC."
https://openalex.org/W1576310345,"nm23 genes encode proteins that participate in tumor metastasis regulation and in various fundamental cellular processes, although the mechanisms remain undefined. All Nm23 proteins contain nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) activity whose significance to these regulatory effects is not yet evident. The protein product of the human nm23-H2 gene functions in vitro both as a nucleoside diphosphate kinase enzyme (NDPK-B; Gilles, A.-M., Presecan, E., Vonica, A. and Lascu, I. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 8784-8789) and as a transcription factor (PuF; Postel, E. H., Berberich, S. J., Flint, S. J. and Ferrone, C. A. (1993) Science 261, 478-480). To understand the significance of these two biochemical activities to NM23-H2 function, we have investigated the relationship between the DNA binding and transcriptional activity of NM23-H2 and its NDPK function. Using site-directed mutagenesis of the cDNA encoding NM23-H2, we have created a mutant substituting for the amino acid histidine 118, the presumed site of phosphorylation in the formation of the phosphoenzyme intermediate, the nonphosphorylatable amino acid phenylalanine. The H118F mutant protein is shown to be catalytically inactive as measured both in a radioisotopic assay that detects formation of the phosphorylated enzyme intermediate and in a coupled enzyme assay that indicates nucleoside diphosphate formation. These results confirm that histidine 118 is the critical residue for NDPK-B activity. In addition, the H118F mutant protein lacking enzymatic activity displayed normal DNA binding affinity for the c-myc promoter in electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and retained full transcriptional activity using the c-myc gene in vitro. These results indicate a lack of correlation between nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity of nm23-H2 on the one hand, and its DNA binding and transcriptional activity on the other, suggesting that the nm23-H2 gene encodes a bifunctional protein molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1521066181,"gp49 was originally defined as a 49-kDa surface glycoprotein preferentially expressed on mouse interleukin-3-dependent, bone marrow-derived mast cells, which are immature progenitor cells. A previously cloned cDNA (gp49A) indicated that gp49 was a member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily, and genomic DNA analysis indicated that two genes might encode a gp49 family. We have now characterized a 5.6-kilobase pair gene, gp49B, that encodes two novel gp49 cDNAs, gp49B1 and gp49B2. The two cDNAs are identical except that gp49B2 is missing exon 6, which encodes a predicted transmembrane domain. In contrast to gp49A, gp49B1 and gp49B2 have 32 additional amino acids at their C termini containing 4 of the 6 consensus amino acids of the antigen receptor homology 1 motif found on several signal-transducing members of the Ig superfamily. When COS-7 cells were transfected with either the gp49B1 or gp49B2 cDNA, only the gp49B1 transfectants bound the B23.1 monoclonal antibody that originally defined gp49. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of the transfectants established that both transcripts were expressed, suggesting that the product of the gp49B2 transcript was not inserted in the plasma membrane. Thus, cloning of the gp49B gene has established the organization of one of the gp49 genes and provided evidence of alternate splicing of transcripts from that gene."
https://openalex.org/W1593219641,"The structure of the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase 1 component of the erythromycin-producing polyketide synthase from Saccharopolyspora erythraea has been investigated using limited proteolysis and active-site labeling. Trypsin, elastase, endoproteinase Glu-C, and endoproteinase Arg-C were used to cleave the multienzyme, and the sizes of the resulting fragments were assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The location of fragments within the primary structure was established by N-terminal sequence analysis. The cleavage pattern followed boundaries previously predicted on the basis of sequence alignments, but many predicted interdomain regions were not cleaved, even under the harshest conditions used. Initial proteolysis generated three large fragments: an N-terminal fragment (about 60 kDa) housing an acyltransferase-acyl carrier protein di-domain; a central fragment (about 90 kDa) containing a ketosynthase-acyltransferase di-domain; and a C-terminal fragment (about 220 kDa) containing the remaining six domains of the multienzyme, including the third acyltransferase. The intact multienzyme behaves as a dimer of molecular mass 660 kDa on gel filtration; and the C-terminal fragment remains dimeric. However, the N-terminal and central fragments appear to be monomeric species. After proteolysis of the multienzyme, the N-terminal di-domain was found to be specifically labeled after incubation with [14C]propionyl-CoA, providing the first evidence for its proposed role as a loading domain for the propionate starter unit. In contrast, the other two fragments were specifically acylated by [14C]methylmalonyl-CoA, indicating that both the other two acyltransferases remain enzymatically active after proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1507400603,"We describe a method for the purification of Tn10/IS10 transposase that relies on the aggregation of the protein after overexpression in Escherichia coli. Aggregated transposase was solubilized before the final purification step, a gel-filtration column, using a combination of salt and detergent. This procedure is the first reported for the preparation of concentrated and active transposase from any IS element. The yield is 11 mg of purified protein at a concentration of 1 mg/ml from 2.5 g of cells. The procedure can be scaled up with ease. We also describe a treatment that activates transposase in either a crude or purified state. This involves dilution into a solution of salt plus organic solvent. In transposition reactions using supercoiled substrate plasmid, the activity was directly proportional to the amount of transposase added over a wide range of transposase/DNA ratios (0.2-2.0 molecules/DNA substrate molecule). In this range 8 transposase molecules were added per transposition event. Maximum conversion of substrate to product (40%) was with 18 transposase molecules/transposition event. At higher levels of transposase with a constant amount of substrate, activity was reduced but could be restored by addition of nonspecific DNA. Both the specific activity of transposase and the type of products generated can be altered by changing in vitro assay conditions. The effects of salts, solvents, and pH value on the reaction are described."
https://openalex.org/W1508049002,"Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved predominantly within the beta amyloid peptide (BAP) domain to release a non-amyloidogenic amino-terminal PN2 fragment. Treatment of cells with phorbol dibutyrate, an agent which activates protein kinase C, has been shown to increase the release of an amino-terminal fragment. A panel of mutant APP reporter constructs was expressed in which each of the potential phosphorylation sites located within the cytoplasmic domain of APP was replaced with alanine residues. Phorbol response patterns were unchanged for each of these mutants, suggesting that induced cleavage occurs independently of APP substrate phosphorylation. We find that phorbol (a) increases the release of a PN2 fragment that is consistent with the normal secretase activity, (b) decreases the release of a shorter amino-terminal APP fragment that is cleaved near the amino terminus of BAP, and (c) decreases the release of BAP which was identified based on electrophoretic mobility, epitope mapping, and radio-sequencing. These data demonstrate that pharmacological treatment can reduce the formation of BAP and suggests that protein kinase C activators could be developed as therapeutic agents to block BAP formation."
https://openalex.org/W1598528158,"Abstract The Xy1R protein positively controls expression from the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid sigma 54-dependent Pu and Ps promoters, in response to the presence of aromatic effectors such as m-xylene, m-methylbenzyl alcohol, and p-chlorobenzaldehyde in the culture medium. Xy1R also autoregulates its own synthesis. A mutant Xy1R regulator called Xy1R7 was isolated after nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis of the wild-type gene and phenotypic selection for mutants that had acquired the ability to recognize m-nitrotoluene, a nitroarene that is not an effector for the wild-type regulator. The mutant regulator exhibited a single point mutation that resulted in a change in codon 172 (GAA-->AAA), which should result in a Glu-->Lys change in the polypeptide chain. The effector profile of the mutant regulator was determined by measuring beta-galactosidase from a fusion of the Pu promoter to a promoterless lacZ gene. The results showed that the mutant regulator had acquired the ability to recognize m-nitrotoluene, and retained the wild-type regulator's ability to recognize most of the wild-type effectors. Full transcriptional activation of the Pu promoter by Xy1R7, as with the wild-type Xy1R protein, requires its full modular structure, namely the sigma 54 recognition site, the integration host factor binding site, and the upstream activation sequences. The Xy1R7 regulator did not stimulate transcription from the Ps promoter in response to the presence of its effectors, and autoregulated its own synthesis at low levels."
https://openalex.org/W1493051074,"The specific involvement of G proteins in thrombin receptor-mediated Ca2+ mobilization and DNA synthesis has been studied in single Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (CCL39 cells) activated by the hexapeptide SFLLRN. Immunoblots performed with antibodies directed against the COOH terminus of G protein alpha subunits revealed that alpha q, alpha i, and alpha o were each present in CCL39 cells. The Ca2+ response to SFLLRN was measured after microinjection of anti-alpha q or anti-alpha o antibodies, which produced a total blockade in 71 and 46% of cells, respectively. A partial inhibition of the SFLLRN-induced Ca2+ response was observed in the remaining cells. The lag time between exposure of the cells to SFLLRN and the onset of Ca2+ mobilization was significantly longer (20-24 s) in cells microinjected with anti-alpha q- or anti-alpha o-antibodies than in control cells microinjected with preimmune serum (9 +/- 1 s). Moreover, the peak height of the Ca2+ response to SFLLRN was decreased by 36 and 73%, respectively in cells microinjected with anti-alpha q or anti-alpha o antibodies. SFLLRN-induced DNA synthesis in growth-arrested CCL39 cells was also inhibited (44-78%) by prior microinjection of anti-alpha q or anti-alpha o antibodies. Anti-alpha 1 antibodies had no effect on the SFLLRN-induced Ca2+ response or on DNA synthesis. These results provide direct evidence that the thrombin receptor in CCL39 cells is coupled to two different types of G proteins, Gq and Go, both causing Ca2+ mobilization and mitogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1652679897,"Fragment A of diphtheria toxin is translocated to the cytosol when the toxin is presented to receptor-positive cells. The toxin binds to cell surface receptors through its B-fragment, and after endocytotic uptake, the low endosomal pH triggers translocation of the A-fragment across the membrane. Translocation can also be induced at the level of the plasma membrane by exposure to low pH medium. Based on the diphtheria toxin crystal structure, we made five double cysteine mutants of the A-fragment, each expected to form an intramolecular disulfide bond. Four of the double cysteine mutants efficiently formed an intramolecular disulfide bridge, and these same mutants showed a strong reduction in their translocating ability. The inhibition of translocation was observed both when the toxin was endocytosed and when translocation was induced by exposing surface-bound toxin to low pH. The data indicate that extensive unfolding of the A-fragment is required for translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1555535097,"Kinesin, an ATP-dependent microtubule motor, can be studied in vitro in motility assays where the kinesin is nonspecifically adsorbed to a surface. However, adsorption can inactivate kinesin and may alter its reaction kinetics. We therefore prepared a biotinated kinesin derivative, K612-BIO, and characterized its activity in solution and when bound to streptavidin-coated surfaces. K612-BIO consists of the N-terminal 612 amino acids of the Drosophila kinesin alpha subunit linked to the 87-amino acid C-terminal domain of the biotin carboxyl carrier protein subunit of Escherichia coli acetyl-CoA carboxylase. The C-terminal domain directs the efficient post-translational biotination of the protein. We expressed K612-BIO at high levels using the baculovirus expression vector system and purified it to near-homogeneity. The expressed protein is completely soluble, and > 90% is bound by streptavidin. K612-BIO steady-state ATPase kinetics (KM,ATP = 24 microM, K0.5, microtubule = 0.61 mg ml-1, Vmax = approximately 25 s-1 head-1, 25 degrees C) are similar to those reported for intact kinesin. ATPase kinetics are not affected by the addition of streptavidin. Enzyme bound to a surface coated with streptavidin drove microtubule gliding in the presence of 2 mM ATP at 750 +/- 130 nm s-1 (26 degrees C). Activity was abolished by pretreatment of the surface with biotin, indicating that the microtubule movements are due to specifically bound enzyme. Motility assays based on specific attachment of biotinated enzyme to streptavidin-coated surfaces will be useful for quantitative analysis of kinesin motility and may provide a way to detect activity in kinesin derivatives or kinesin-like proteins that have not yet been shown to move microtubules."
https://openalex.org/W1572190405,"Recently, we described a low frequency platelet alloantigen on human platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) IIIa, termed Sra, that was involved in neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia. To identify the molecular nature of the Sra alloantigen, we analyzed the nucleotide sequence of polymerase chain reaction-amplified GPIIIa mRNA, and found a C2004-->T substitution in seven Sra positive individuals which results in an Arg636-->Cys polymorphism within the cysteine-rich region of GPIIIa. Analysis of allele-specific recombinant forms of GPIIIa that differed only at amino acid residue 636 showed that anti-Sra alloantibodies reacted with the Cys636, but not the Arg636, recombinant form of GPIIIa. Interestingly, under reducing conditions, the Cys636 form of GPIIIa migrated with a slightly increased apparent molecular weight compared with the Arg636 form. Following treatment with Endoglycosidase H, both allelic forms of GPIIIa exhibited the same mobility, however the Sra epitope was lost. Sra positive platelets express the same number of GPIIb-IIIa complexes on their surface as wild-type Sra negative platelets, and also aggregate normally in response to a variety of platelet agonists. Based upon these results, we conclude that 1) GPIIIa residue 636 specifically controls the formation and expression of the Sra alloantigenic determinant, and 2) an unpaired cysteine residue alters the N-linked glycosylation pattern of the extracellular domain of GPIIIa, but affects neither the degree of surface expression nor the adhesive function of the GPIIb-IIIa complex."
https://openalex.org/W1539083823,"The participation of cell ceramide in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-stimulated NF-kappa B activation in Jurkat T cells and HL-60 cells was studied. TNF-alpha readily stimulated NF-kappa B activity in both cell lines as assayed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and the use of a human immunodeficiency virus-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct. However, TNF-alpha stimulation did not increase cell ceramide levels in either cell line. The exogenous addition of a short chain ceramide, N-acetylsphingosine, to Jurkat cells had no effect on NF-kappa B activity. When Jurkat T cells were exposed to the glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, 1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol, endogenous ceramide levels increased 4-fold. The increase in ceramide, however, did not result in NF-kappa B activation nor did it potentiate TNF-alpha or phorbol ester-stimulated activity. We conclude that TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappa B activation occurs in Jurkat and HL-60 cell lines that do not demonstrate an increase in TNF-alpha-induced ceramide. Increasing ceramide levels by the addition of short chain ceramides or the use of a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor can be dissociated from activation of NF-kappa B by TNF-alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1572528536,"Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) adherent to fibrinogen exhibit a delay in the onset of the respiratory burst in response to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). Previously, we demonstrated that H2O2 release in adherent PMNs coincides with the exocytosis of lactoferrin-containing specific granules. Since diradylglycerol (DRG) has been implicated in PMN secretion and oxidant release, we measured DRG formation during PMN adhesion to fibrinogen. PMNs were added to fibrinogen-coated plastic in the presence of fMLP, and H2O2 release, lactoferrin release, and DRG formation measured over a time course of 120 min. H2O2 and lactoferrin release were not apparent until 45-60 min, reaching maximal levels by 120 min. In contrast, DRG concentration increased by 15-30 min, from 275 +/- 27 pmol/mg of protein in resting cells to 600 +/- 173 pmol/mg protein in cells exposed to fMLP. DRG levels returned to base line by 30-45 min (383 +/- 32 pmol/mg of protein) before increasing again between 60 and 120 min (944 +/- 230 pmol/mg of protein and 1632 +/- 351 pmol/mg of protein, respectively). Propranolol, an inhibitor of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, caused a dose-dependent inhibition of both H2O2 and lactoferrin release, with maximal inhibition at 50-100 microM. Propranolol also inhibited the second, but not the first phase of DRG formation. Similarly, ethanol treatment completely blocked H2O2 and lactoferrin release, and the second phase of DRG formation. In the presence of ethanol, phospholipase D (PLD)-mediated formation of [3H]phosphatidylethanol from 3H-O-alkyl-phosphatidylcholine corresponded to the second, but not the first, phase of DRG formation (23,169 +/- 2,017 cpm/mg protein, ethanol versus 2,696 +/- 261 cpm/mg protein, control). These data indicate that DRG, generated through the activation of PLD, plays an important role in degranulation and oxidant release in adherent PMNs."
https://openalex.org/W1539688857,"Binding of aromatic substrate molecules to myeloperoxidase has been investigated by EPR spectroscopy and model building. Binding of aromatic substrate molecules, such as phenol, p-cresol, resorcinol, and 4-amino salicylate, replaces the original rhombic high spin EPR spectrum of the ferric enzyme (g = 6.74, 5.18, and 1.97) by another high spin signal (g = 7.04, 4.87, and 1.93) indicating that these substrate molecules bind near the heme center of the enzyme. Salicylhydroxamic acid and benzohydroxamic acid complexes of myeloperoxidase showed EPR spectra composed of high spin (g = 6.99, 4.93, and 1.95) and low spin (2.66, 2.22, and 1.81) signals. The hydroxamic side chains of these two substrates seem to interact with the heme iron. Model building based on the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme (Zeng, J., and Fenna, R. E. (1992) J. Mol. Biol. 226, 185-207) revealed the presence of a hydrophobic pocket at the entrance of the distal heme cavity where the aromatic ring of these substrates can bind. Moreover, the six-membered ring portion of salicylhydroxamic acid and benzohydroxamic acid could bind to this hydrophobic pocket with the hydroxamic side chain placed between the imidazole of the distal His and the heme iron. The EPR results on lactoperoxidase and intestinal peroxidase also suggest the presence of an aromatic substrate binding site similar to that of myeloperoxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1521561951,"Human immunodeficiency viruses HIV-1 and HIV-2 encode a Tat protein that specifically activates transcription from the viral long terminal repeat. To characterize the properties of the Tat proteins, we have expressed them in Escherichia coli. The purified Tat protein was biochemically analyzed and tested for activity upon electroporation into human cell lines. This protein electroporation was used for the intracellular analysis of in vitro modified Tat protein. Our results indicate that the transcriptionally active form of the Tat protein is a monomer. Furthermore, we found that Tat activity is dramatically inhibited by preincubation of the protein with strongly reducing agents. In contrast, no inhibitory effect was measured upon incubation with metal-chelating reagents. These results suggest that the cysteine residues of Tat are involved in the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds."
https://openalex.org/W1559014191,"Myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) is a major substrate of protein kinase C, whose interaction with the plasma membrane is dependent on its phosphorylation by protein kinase C and on its N-terminal myristoylation. We describe a hitherto undescribed demyristoylation activity of the protein in cytoplasmic fraction of synaptosomes from bovine brain. The activity is dependent on ATP but independent from calcium. The formation of the demyristoylated form, characterized by an increased mobility on SDS gel (70 kDa instead of 85 kDa), was confirmed by mass spectrometry and amino acid sequencing. The molecular mass of the demyristoylated protein as well as the incorporation of radioactive phosphate from [gamma-32P]ATP indicated that one phosphoryl group was incorporated during the demyristoylation process. Calmodulin, which binds to the protein kinase C phosphorylation domain of MARCKS, inhibited the reaction in a calcium-dependent manner. These data suggest that the demyristoylation is regulated by the signal transduction pathways and that the two conserved domains of the protein, namely the N-terminal myristoylated region and the phosphorylation site domain, are functionally interdependent. The localization of MARCKS in the cells may be regulated not only by its phosphorylation with protein kinase C but also by a reversible myristoylation of the protein in situ."
https://openalex.org/W1566059026,"We measured Ca(2+)-calmodulin binding to expressed human caldesmon fragments by three techniques: tryptophan fluorescence enhancement, change in fluorescence of TA-calmodulin, and cosedimentation with calmodulin-Sepharose. Ca(2+)-calmodulin bound with similar affinity to peptide M73 (C714SMWEKGNVFSSPGF727, N terminus of domain 4b), to all the fragments of caldesmon containing this peptide, and also to H9 (Thr726-Val793), which did not contain this peptide (Kd = 0.2-0.8 microM). We conclude that Ca(2+)-calmodulin binds at two sites on caldesmon; site A is the sequence 715MWEKGNVFS723 previously identified by Zhan et al. (Zhan, Q., Wong, S. S., and Wang, C.-L.A. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 21810-21814), and site B is located nearer the C terminus of caldesmon. Ca(2+)-calmodulin binding at site B is coupled to reversal of caldesmon inhibition of actin-tropomyosin activated myosin MgATPase, while calmodulin binding at site A has no detectable function. H9 did not displace M73 from Ca(2+)-calmodulin, while the other fragments did. High concentrations of M73 (> 1000 x Kd) could not displace H9 bound to Ca(2+)-calmodulin-Sepharose. Thus sites A and B in calmodulin are functionally separate. Analysis of overlapping expressed fragments indicates that site B is located in the sequence Thr726-Leu767, which includes Trp749. The minimal Ca(2+)-calmodulin binding sequence could be 744SRINEWLTK752."
https://openalex.org/W1598449412,"In an effort to understand the relationship between a 72-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp72) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), we have characterized their interaction using clofibric acid-Sepharose chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation with antisera raised against either rat PPAR (rPPAR) or Hsp72. First, we observed that both rPPAR and Hsp72 elute in a clofibrate-dependent manner from the clofibric acid-Sepharose matrix. Second, we found that immunoprecipitation of either protein from solution resulted in the precipitation of the other. This result was obtained from rat liver cytosol, from Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells expressing rPPAR, and from reticulocyte lysate rPPAR expression systems. These results suggest that Hsp72 and rPPAR form a complex in vivo and that Hsp72 may play a role in the folding, subcellular localization, and/or signaling pathway of PPARs."
https://openalex.org/W1507703169,"Although tetanus and botulinum A neurotoxins are ineffective in cultured chromaffin cells, they will inhibit carbachol-induced release of noradrenaline provided they gain access to the cytosol either through artificial pores generated in the plasma membrane or by binding to incorporated exogenous gangliosides. The block of exocytosis persists for weeks followed by a slow recovery of cell function. When specific anti-botulinum A toxin antibodies are introduced into cells through pores after manifestation of the block by botulinum A neurotoxin, restoration of exocytotic function is accelerated and fully reestablished within 4 days. The same time course of restoration is seen with anti-tetanus toxin antibodies in cells poisoned by tetanus toxin. Since the light chains of the toxins are enzymatically active, we have introduced polyclonal and monoclonal anti-light chain antibodies into the cytosol. Of all light chain antibodies tested, only those directed against the peptide homologous to the zinc-binding sequence, which is present in both neurotoxins, restored exocytosis regardless of which toxin caused the block. These results indicate that the zinc-binding domain is directly involved in the interaction of the light chains with their substrates and that the toxins have to be present continuously to maintain the block."
https://openalex.org/W1528508261,"The gastric H,K-ATPase consists of an alpha, beta heterodimer. To determine which part of the alpha subunit is associated with the beta subunit, hog gastric vesicles were trypsinized, which left most of the beta subunit undigested. The vesicles were solubilized with either C12E8 (polyoxyethylene 8 lauryl ester) or Nonidet P-40 and then passed over a wheat germ agglutinin column, which retained the beta subunit. Among the fragments of membrane spanning segments obtained by digestion in the absence of K+, only one peptide fragment of the alpha subunit coeluted with the beta subunit, representing only the M7 and M8 membrane spanning segments of the alpha subunit along with their extracytoplasmic connecting loop. With K+ present during digestion, the fragments at 19-21 kDa and at 9.4 kDa were retained on the column, representing the M7 to C-terminal end and the M5/loop/M6 sector of the enzyme. These results provide biochemical evidence that a region of the alpha subunit containing the M7/loop/M8 sector is bound to the beta subunit under both digestion conditions; but when the C-terminal 180-amino acid sector of the alpha subunit remains intact, as found in the presence of K+, there is an additional retention of the M5/loop/M6 sector of the alpha subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1484232403,"1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) rapidly stimulates the biphasic formation of diacylglycerol (DAG) in chick myoblasts. Neomycin (0.5 mM), an inhibitor of phosphoinositide hydrolysis, abolished the first phase (1 min) but had no effect on the second 1,25(OH)2D3-induced DAG peak (5 min). In myoblasts prelabeled with [3H]choline, 1,25(OH)2D3 increased the release of [3H]choline (maximally at 5 min), with a concomitant decrease in phosphatidylcholine and the absence of significant changes in phosphocholine. 1,25(OH)2D3 caused a significant increase in phosphatidylethanol (PEt) formation in myoblasts in the presence of 1.5% ethanol. The effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 were time- and dose-dependent (10(-11) to 10(-8) M) and specific as 25OHD3 and 24,25(OH)2D3 failed to accumulate PEt. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate failed to accumulate PEt. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate also stimulated PEt formation. The combination of 1,25(OH)2D3 and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate was more effective than either compound alone. Neither the PKC inhibitor H7 nor PKC down-regulation blocked the hormone-induced increase in PEt. The effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 were, however, inhibited in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (+EGTA) and by nifedipine and verapamil, whereas the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 also increased PEt generation. The data support the notion that 1,25(OH)2D3 triggers the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine in myoblasts through a Ca(2+)-dependent, PKC-independent, phospholipase D-catalyzed mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1560517371,"Genomic DNA clones containing the T-cell-specific human MAL gene were isolated. Restriction and sequence analysis revealed four exons and three introns. Each hydrophobic segment of MAL together with its adjacent hydrophilic sequence correlates closely with one exon of the gene. RNase protection analysis revealed that the previously described MAL mRNA, which contains the sequences present in the four exons, is the mRNA species predominant in T-cells. A remarkable similarity was found between the hydrophobicity pattern of MAL and those of the peripheral membrane protein 22 (PMP-22) and the 16-kDa proteolipid of vacuolar H(+)-ATPase. Direct evidence supporting that MAL is a proteolipid was obtained by extracting bacterial lysates expressing recombinant MAL protein with lipophilic solvents used to extract lipids. The use of two different antibodies raised against distinct peptides from the MAL molecule has allowed the localization of MAL in the endoplasmic reticulum of T-cells. This subcellular localization is in agreement with the presence of a RWKSS motif in the COOH-terminal tail of MAL, next to its last putative transmembrane domain, that fits with one of the consensus sequences (RXKXX) for residency in the endoplasmic reticulum for transmembrane proteins. A possible function for MAL protein in T-cells is discussed based on its subcellular localization and the unique lipid-like properties of the proteolipid proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1562598133,"Stimulation of neuropeptide Y (NPY) Y2 receptors induced an intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) increase in a human neuroblastoma cell line, CHP-234. When NPY in a Ca(2+)-free solution was applied, this increase was abolished. Depolarization with high KCl evoked no response, suggesting that the responses were not mediated by voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. There was no evidence that the NPY response consisted of a capacitative Ca2+ entry sensitive to internal Ca2+ store levels. The [Ca2+]i elevation was diminished by Ni2+, a blocker of Ca2+ entry. Mn2+ induced a quench of the fura-2 fluorescence, which ceased promptly upon the removal of NPY, indicating that Ca2+ entry was linked tightly to receptor activation. Although thapsigargin- and ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ stores were present, NPY-induced responses were not impaired by pretreatment with either drug. Furthermore, NPY had no effect on the thapsigargin-sensitive store. Pertussis toxin did not affect the NPY-stimulated [Ca2+]i increase, although it abolished the NPY-dependent inhibition of cAMP production. It is concluded that the Y2 receptors couple directly to receptor-operated Ca2+ channels without the involvement of intracellular Ca2+ stores. The results also indicate that Y2 receptors can activate both pertussis toxin-sensitive and -insensitive mechanisms in the same cell."
https://openalex.org/W1596780846,"Gastrin-releasing peptide is an important growth-modulating factor in developing lung epithelium. It is known to be produced by small cell carcinomas of the lung, and an autocrine loop involving gastrin-releasing peptide and its receptor has been demonstrated in many small cell lung tumors. We investigated whether such an autocrine loop could also be demonstrated in non-small cell lung carcinoma, since gastrin-releasing peptide is known to stimulate human bronchial epithelial cells, from which non-small cell tumors should emerge. We report here that gastrin-releasing peptide is produced by a bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma cell line (A549) adapted to serum-free and growth factor-free conditions. A549 cells adapted to these conditions, termed A549-R0 cells, display extensive membrane interdigitations, Golgi apparatus, and secretory-like granules, and grow as a mixture of attached colonies and floating cells. Gastrin-releasing peptide is present in the conditioned medium produced by A549-R0 cells. Colony formation of cells derived from a squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, 239T, was stimulated 9-fold by A549-R0 conditioned medium or by authentic gastrin-releasing peptide, measured in serum-free conditions. The growth stimulatory activity was inhibited by a monoclonal antibody to gastrin-releasing peptide. Transcripts for receptors for the bombesin family of peptides were also demonstrated in A549-R0 cells and 239T cells. These results demonstrate that non-small cell lung carcinomas can secrete gastrin-releasing peptide and can also respond to the peptide."

We have previously shown that one of its subunits is a 21.4-kDa integral membrane protein encoded by the nuclear IMP1 gene. We have now purified the active protease approximately 300-fold from yeast mitochondria. It has an apparent molecular weight of 35,000 and contains not only Imp1p but also a previously unrecognized 19-kDa subunit. Partial amino acid sequencing identifies this subunit as the product of the recently described IMP2 gene (Nunnari, J., Fox, T., and Walter, P. (1993) Science 262, 1997-2004)."
https://openalex.org/W1559506496,"The type C receptor (ANP-C or NPR-C) for the natriuretic peptides was demonstrated, by site-directed mutagenesis, to have an immunoglobulin-like disulfide bonding pattern that is very similar to that of the cytokine receptor superfamily. The mature form of ANP-C has a disulfide-linked homodimeric structure and contains 5 conserved cysteine residues per subunit, all in the extracellular domain. To identify the cysteine residue involved in the dimerization and further to determine the intramolecular disulfide bridges and their functional roles, cysteine to serine mutations of the 5 cysteine residues were constructed. An analysis of the mutant receptors expressed in COS-1 cells by 125I-ANP binding assay and by measuring difference in their electrophoretic mobilities on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels indicated that 1) the first 4 cysteine residues are joined sequentially, forming the Cys104-Cys132 and Cys209-Cys257 loops of 29 and 49 residues, respectively; 2) the two disulfide-linked loops are essential for the ligand binding activity; 3) the 5th cysteine residue Cys469 is used in the formation of covalently linked dimers; and 4) the covalent association of the subunit through the disulfide bond involving Cys469 has no apparent influence on ligand-receptor interactions. The intramolecular disulfide bond Cys104-Cys132 was also confirmed by direct protein sequencing of tryptic fragments of purified ANP-C receptor. The secondary structural features revealed here will be useful in understanding the structure and function relationships of not only the dimeric ANP-C receptor, which has only a short cytoplasmic tail, but also the ANP-A (GC-A) and ANP-B (GC-B) receptor subtypes, which have a guanylate cyclase domain in their long cytoplasmic tail and have recently been shown to possess an oligomeric structure, since they have similarly spaced cysteine residues in their extracellular domains."
https://openalex.org/W1593285154,"A post 30,000 x g particulate fraction was isolated from rat heart. This mixed membrane fraction is enriched in a carnitine palmitoyltransferase which is sensitive to both malonyl-CoA and etomoxiryl-CoA at concentrations that inhibit the malonyl-CoA-sensitive carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPTo/CPT-I) of intact mitochondria. Tritiated etomoxiryl-CoA labels two proteins with the same molecular weight as the labeled proteins from rat heart mitochondria. Malonyl-CoA-sensitive carnitine palmitoyltransferase in the particulate fraction is stable to freeze-thawing, and the activity is not latent. These data show that the carnitine palmitoyltransferase associated with this particle is CPTo/CPT-I. Positive Western blots were obtained, with the particle using anti-CPTi/CPT-II at a molecular weight identical with the CPT1/CPT-II purified from rat heart mitochondria. Catalytic activity was purified to near homogeneity in approximately 40% yield. The purified protein has a molecular weight identical with CPTi/CPT-II, it cross-reacts with antibody against CPTi/CPT-II, it is not inhibited by malonyl-CoA or etomoxiryl-CoA, and mass spectral analyses of the tryptic peptides give the same molecular masses as CPTi/CPT-II, and, when mixed with equal amounts of CPTi/CPT-II, one uniform spot is found by two-dimensional electrophoresis. These data indicate that the catalytic subunit of CPTo/CPT-I is the same as CPTi/CPT-II. The average inhibition of the CPT of frozen-thawed particles is 71% by 50 nM etomoxiryl-CoA and 62% by 50 nM malonyl-CoA. The inhibitor sensitivity, but not the catalytic activity, is lost by solubilization in 1% Triton X-114; removal of Triton X-114 using Extracti-Gel D restores etomoxiryl-CoA and malonyl-CoA sensitivity (both 50 nM) of CPT to an average of 77 and 48%, respectively. Consistent with previous reports, these results show that CPTo/CPT-I is NOT inactivated by detergents, rather detergents both desensitize it to malonyl-CoA and alter its Vmax. These data show the assumption that CPTo/CPT-I is inactivated by detergents is untenable."
https://openalex.org/W1551513553,"The mitochondrial DNA in Crithidia fasciculata, a trypanosomatid parasite, is known as kinetoplast DNA. Kinetoplast DNA has a very unusual structure, consisting of several thousand minicircles and a few dozen maxicircles, all topologically interlocked into a giant network. There is one network within each cell's single mitochondrion. We previously purified a 43-kDa DNA polymerase from C. fasciculata mitochondria (Torri, A. F., and Englund, P. T. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 4786-4792). This enzyme has properties very different from those of a DNA polymerase gamma, the conventional mitochondrial polymerase. In addition to its small size, it is nonprocessive, has no detectable exonuclease activity, and has very low fidelity. In all of these respects, the polymerase resembles a DNA polymerase beta, a gap-filling enzyme thought to function in DNA repair in the nucleus of other eukaryotes. We speculate that this enzyme may have been specially imported into the C. fasciculata mitochondrion to repair the many gaps found in minicircles following their replication. This is the first example of a beta-like polymerase from the mitochondrion of any eukaryote."
https://openalex.org/W1499926203,"Differential screening of expression libraries with nonimmune and day 4-6 immune serum from naive rats infected with the protozoan Trypanosoma lewisi was used to identify potential cell surface protein coding genes. Several T. lewisi cDNAs that resulted were partially characterized and used to clone the homologues from Trypanosoma brucei. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNAs encoding the Tb-29 genes of the parasitic protozoan T. brucei obtained by this method (3557 nucleotides for Tb-291 and 8729 nucleotides for Tb-292) encoded predicted open reading frames of 1070 and 2550 amino acids, respectively. The Tb-29 proteins encoded a large domain with an octapeptide (EARLRAEE) repeat (79 repeats in Tb-291 and 60 in Tb-292), which shared significant similarity with the octapeptide repeat of the S-antigen of isolate NF7 of Plasmodium falciparum. The predicted amino acid sequence of the Tb-292 protein encoded potential transmembrane domains (eight in total). Indirect immunofluorescence using confocal image analysis and immunoelectron microscopy located the EARLRAEE proteins to a membranous network. The Tb-29 proteins were most abundantly distributed to the area surrounding the nucleus, the region between the nucleus and the flagellar pocket, and the region immediately underneath the flagellar pocket membrane. The subcellular distribution of Tb-29 proteins suggests that these proteins may provide a constituent associated with the cell's vesicular transport system."
https://openalex.org/W1536685080,"The RAD3 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is required for excision repair of UV-damaged DNA and is essential for cell viability. Remarkable homology exists between RAD3 and the human excision repair gene XPD, whose mutational inactivation underlies the cancer-prone disorder in xeroderma pigmentosum group D patients. Our previous work demonstrated that RAD3-encoded protein contains a DNA helicase activity. Here, we show that RAD3 binds preferentially to UV-damaged DNA over nondamaged DNA. Removal of pyrimidine dimers from damaged DNA by enzymatic photoreactivation does not affect binding, suggesting an affinity of RAD3 for pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone photoproducts. Damage-specific binding by RAD3 is strongly dependent on ATP and on the degree of negative superhelicity in DNA. The requirement of superhelicity in damage binding may target RAD3 to regions of DNA undergoing transcription, resulting in the preferential repair of these regions. The rad3 Arg-48 mutant protein, which lacks the DNA helicase activity, also binds UV-damaged DNA preferentially, indicating that DNA helicase and damage binding are two distinct and separable functional entities in RAD3."
https://openalex.org/W1601777246,"We have investigated the transcriptional response of the IFP53/tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase gene to interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha). A single gamma-interferon activation site (GAS) in proximity to the transcription start sites was found to mediate the response of the IFP53 gene to IFN-alpha. This DNA element bound two distinct protein factors, alpha-interferon activation factor 1 (AAF1) and AAF2, which were rapidly activated in the cytoplasm of IFN-alpha-treated HeLa cells. AAF1, like the gamma-interferon activation factor, bound to the GAS from different IFN-responsive promoters and contained the 91-kDa ISGF3 protein (p91). However, in complexes with the IFP53 or Ly6A/E GAS, p91 was the only ISGF3 protein, whereas in the case of the GBP GAS, the 48-kDa protein (p48) was also present. AAF2 was found to preferentially bind to the IFP53 GAS, but not at all to the GBP GAS, and contained no ISGF3 protein. Therefore, GAS-binding regulatory factors in the IFN-alpha response can either consist of proteins found in ISGF3 or be formed by distinct proteins that are similarly linked to IFN-alpha-induced signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1511184731,"Sulfation of proteins on tyrosines is a late Golgi modification that can be used to label proteins with [35S]sulfate for the analysis of post-Golgi transport. To extend the use of this modification to proteins not naturally sulfated, we fused a tyrosine sulfation site, the carboxyl-terminal nonapeptide of cholecystokinin precursor, to the carboxyl terminus of two normally unsulfated proteins: alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor, a secretory protein, and subunit H1 of the asialoglycoprotein receptor; a type II membrane protein. The tagged proteins were efficiently sulfated in transfected COS-7 and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Specifically in COS-7 cells, the proteins were sulfated before they were galactosylated and sialylated and were converted to the mature forms with a half-time of approximately 2-3 min. This is in contrast to other cell types in which tyrosine sulfation was found to be virtually the last modification of the Golgi apparatus. Our results suggest that tyrosine sulfation occurs before the trans-Golgi in transfected COS-7 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1526550461,"Previous studies have suggested that cleavage of vaccinia virus core protein precursors occurs within the consensus tripeptide motif -A-G decreases X-. As an approach to delineate the sequence and structural features of the precursor polypeptides that are responsible for directing site-specific scission within this element, site-directed mutagenesis procedures were employed in concert with an in vivo trans-processing assay of the P25K: FLAG reporter plasmid. The results obtained suggest that residue occupancy at the P1' site (following the nomenclature of Schechter and Berger (Schechter, I., and Berger, A. (1976) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 27, 157-162), the positions at the amino- and carboxyl-proximal residues are indicated as P1, P2, etc., and P1', P2', etc., respectively) was extremely permissive, with only a proline substitution blocking cleavage. In contrast, the permissible occupancy of the P1 (serine or alanine) and P2 (cysteine, serine, or asparagine) sites was extremely restricted. Analysis of P1/P2 double mutants supported this conclusion and suggested additional levels of combinatorial stringency. Insertion or deletion of sequences immediately adjacent (amino- or carboxyl-terminal) to the -A-G-X- motif completely abrogated cleavage, suggesting the presence of additional important structural determinants. Mutation of the conserved proline or basic amino acid residues in these regions had no effect on cleavage, whereas it appeared that the presence of a hydrophobic residue in the P4 site was required."
https://openalex.org/W1569306076,"Escherichia coli RecA protein plays a central role both in DNA repair and in recombination. We report biochemical properties of three new RecA proteins mutated at positions 199 (RecA694), 207 (RecA659), and 211 (RecA611) in the putative DNA binding site. RecA694 had a wild-type phenotype, whereas RecA611 and RecA659 were deficient in promoting both the self-cleavage of LexA repressor and the DNA-strand exchange reaction. In order to determine the origin of this inhibition, we examined the capacity of wild-type and mutant proteins to bind to single-stranded DNA (with and without single-stranded binding protein, SSB), double-stranded DNA, and ATP. DNA strand exchange defects were correlated with the inability of mutant proteins to displace SSB from DNA. For the recA659 mutation this inhibition was reversed by equimolar wild-type protein. In contrast, mixtures of either wild-type/RecA659 or wild-type/RecA611 proteins remained deficient in LexA cleavage, suggesting that the dominant negative phenotype of the mutant proteins may be a consequence of the formation heterologous RecA complexes. Various mutations in the putative DNA binding site of RecA protein altered ATP binding, ATPase activity, displacement of SSB from single-stranded DNA, and protein-protein interactions. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that DNA binding to this site of RecA relays allosteric effects to several functional domains throughout the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1581175305,"Activation of human T lymphocytes by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and leukoagglutinin from Phaseolus vulgaris (L-PHA) results in important changes in N-glycosylation. The most important event is the increase, in both T4 and T8 cells (especially the latter), of L-PHA+ structures characterized by beta 1-6-branching of complex-type oligosaccharides. Moreover, the existence of a CD4-mediated increase of these beta 1-6-branched structures on positively selected T4 cells, as compared with the negatively selected ones, suggests that the presence of these structures, not detectable on T8 resting cells, could be related to stimulation events triggered by both selection methods. This beta 1-6-branching on N-glycans, strongly associated with a metastatic phenotype in human and rodent tumors, is exhibited by numerous glycoproteins on stimulated cells, as shown by blot analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1540210071,"The influence of 8-bromo-cAMP on N-glycosylation in JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells was investigated using the octanoyl-tripeptide (OTP; N-octanoyl-asparagyl-125I-tyrosyl-threonine amide) as glycosyl acceptor. In cells pretreated with 8-bromo-cAMP (2.5 nM to 1 mM), the amount of glycosylated OTP released into the culture medium was increased up to 35-fold. Under the same conditions, a 23-fold higher quantity of the glycoprotein hormone human chorionic gonadotropin was secreted. Preincubation of 10-90 min with 250 microM 8-bromo-cAMP caused only a 2-fold increase of the total amount of glycosylated OTP, whereas it was approximately 20-fold higher when the pretreatment was extended to 40 h. This strongly suggests involvement of gene activation rather than cAMP-mediated phosphorylation. The specific activity of the oligosaccharyltransferase, as well as the mRNA levels of ribophorin I and II (presumptive subunits of the enzyme), remained unchanged. In pulse-chase experiments, [3H]mannose incorporation into dolichol-linked Glc3Man9(GlcNAc)2 was up to 20-fold higher in cells pretreated with 8-bromo-cAMP (250 microM, 40 h). The radioactivity was chased from the lipid-linked oligosaccharide pool and shifted to the glycoprotein fraction 10 times more rapidly in the pretreated cells. The flux of [3H]mannose through the dolichol phosphate mannose pool was only slightly affected by the 8-bromo-cAMP pretreatment. Our investigations show that the oligosaccharyltransferase activity in JEG-3 cells is not rate-limiting. N-Glycosylation seems to be controlled by the amount of lipid-linked core oligosaccharide. The size of the lipid-linked core oligosaccharide pool, as well as the flux through, is markedly increased by pretreatment with 8-bromo-cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W1635583803,"Pyridoxal-specific phosphatase purified from human erythrocytes was inactivated by a variety of thiol-specific reagents in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The presence of pyridoxal phosphate, a substrate, or inorganic phosphate, a competitive inhibitor, protected the enzyme from inactivation. Phosphatase inactivated by disulfide reagents was reactivated by the addition of excess dithiothreitol, indicating that the inactivation was due to formation of a mixed disulfide between the reagent and a free cysteinyl residue at or near the active site of the enzyme. Incorporation of either 1 mol of 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), 0.6 mol of iodo[3H]acetate, or 0.6 mol of N-[3H]ethylmaleimide per mol of subunit led to complete inactivation of the enzyme. High concentration of phosphate prevented the incorporation of DTNB and iodo[3H]acetate. Amino acid analysis of carboxymethylated enzyme and DTNB titration of the denatured phosphatase indicated that there may be only 1 cysteinyl residue per subunit. Modification by iodoacetate did not affect the quaternary structure of the enzyme. The phosphatase modified by iodo[3H]acetate was subjected to trypsin digestion, and the resulting peptides were separated on a reverse phase C18 column. Two radioactive peaks were obtained and contained a peptide with the N-terminal sequence of Ala-Gln-Gly-Val-Leu-Phe-Asp-Cys(Cm)-Asp-Gly-Val-Leu-X-Asn-Gly. Most of the radioactivity was released with Cys(Cm). These results indicate that the cysteinyl residue in this sequence is at or near the active site and is essential for activity. Residues 5-12 and 15 of this peptide are identical with a sequence of a yeast alkaline p-nitrophenylphosphatase, and the peptide has little homology with other mammalian phosphatases."
https://openalex.org/W1672278453,"CYP19, the human aromatase cytochrome P-450 (P450arom) gene, encodes an enzyme which converts androgens to estrogens by three successive hydroxylation reactions by coupling with NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase. In the present study, we have characterized two cis-acting transcriptional regulatory elements of CYP19, termed as hATRE-1 (human aromatase cytochrome P-450 gene transcriptional regulatory element-1) ([sequence: see text]) and hATRE-2 ([sequence: see text]). These sequences are located between -2238 and -2214, and between -2141 and -2098 relative to the major cap site of the gene, respectively. Transient expression analysis in human BeWo choriocarcinoma cells, in which CYP19 is expressed, shows that hATRE-1 represses the expression of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene driven by the promoter of CYP19, whereas hATRE-2 enhances the reporter gene expression in response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis indicates that nuclear binding factors specific to hATRE-1 are present in BeWo cells, but not in HeLa cells nor in TYK-nu cells that lack the expression of CYP19. In contrast, nuclear binding factors to hATRE-2 are present not only in BeWo cells but also in the latter two types of cells. Nevertheless, hATRE-2 does not affect the reporter gene expression in HeLa cells and TYK-nu cells. These results indicate that hATRE-1 and hATRE-2 are cis-acting transcriptional regulatory elements involving in the regulation of the cell type-specific expression of CYP19."

Previous studies have suggested the existence of a multienzyme complex that is responsible for DNA precursor synthesis and is associated with sites of replication within the nucleus. Contrasting this, other studies have proposed that DNA precursor synthesis occurs outside the nucleus. To further these studies, we have addressed the location where thymidylate synthase resides in yeast. Subcellular fractionation experiments indicate thymidylate synthase is associated with purified nuclei. Consistent with this, immunofluorescence analysis suggests that thymidylate synthase is situated at the nuclear periphery."

The single mutants D140A and D141A displayed small increases in Km (6-12-fold) and moderate decreases in kcat (17-78-fold). Kinetic analysis with the slowly reacting substrate system MgATP and dAMP suggested that the decrease in kcat is not caused by a decrease in the conformational step(s) relative to the chemical step. Most of the kinetic constants of the double mutants R138M,D140A and R132M,D141A are similar to those of the single mutants R138M and R132M, respectively. Detailed analysis by two-dimensional NMR indicated no appreciable changes in the conformations of the free enzyme or the complex with MgAP5A (where AP5A is P1,P5-bis(5'-adenosyl)pentaphosphate), for both single and double mutants. These results taken together suggest that Asp-140 and Asp-141 are unimportant for substrate-induced conformational changes in AK; their roles are mainly to assist Arg-138 and Arg-132 in stabilizing the transition state. The structural results also suggest that AK is a flexible enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1515871965,"In hepatocytes, different receptors that share an ability to stimulate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation by activating guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) evoke Ca2+ signals that are characteristic of the receptor that evoked them. High affinity, guanine nucleotide-sensitive binding of agonists to their receptors provides a convenient means of assessing receptor-G protein interactions. We used these methods to examine the extent to which different Ca(2+)-mobilizing receptors share G protein pools. Although our earlier results (Dasso, L. L. T., and Taylor, C.W. (1992) Mol. Pharmacol. 42, 453-457) showed that activated V1-vasopressin receptors prevented alpha 1-adrenoreceptors from associating with G proteins, our present results show that neither alpha 1-adrenergic agonists nor angiotensin II influences the interaction between V1 receptors and their G proteins. This asymmetric scavenging of G proteins by alpha 1-adrenoreceptors and V1 receptors is not a consequence of there being more of the latter and may result either from V1 receptors binding more tightly to G proteins or from their ability to interact with a second G protein pool. We speculate that the different interactions among V1 receptors, alpha 1-adrenoreceptors, and their G proteins contribute to the differently shaped Ca2+ spikes evoked by these receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1559390580,"Hydrostatic pressure was used to promote dissociation of fluorescein (Fl) from single-chain antibody 4-4-20 (SCA 4-4-20). Fl fluorescence intensity was quenched by 97% upon binding to SCA 4-4-20. Increasing pressure to 2.4 kbar enhanced Fl fluorescence from the remaining 3% to 14-17%. The capacity of anti-metatype antibodies (anti-Met), which specifically recognize liganded anti-Fl antibodies, to protect against pressure-induced Fl dissociation was tested. Both polyclonal and monoclonal anti-Met antibodies protected against Fl dissociation, reducing the fluorescence intensity at 2.4 kbar from 14-17% to 6-8%. Additive effects of anti-Met antibodies in protection against pressure-induced Fl dissociation were suggested by the fact that a 2-fold molar excess polyclonal anti-Met reagent promoted additional protection relative to an equimolar amount. On the other hand, combination of different monoclonal anti-Met antibodies did not promote additive protection, suggesting recognition of overlapping metatopes by these monoclonals. The complex formed by SCA 4-4-20 and the Fl analog HPF was more sensitive to pressure than the Fl-SCA 4-4-20 complex. Addition of both polyclonal and monoclonal anti-Met antibodies reduced the Fl fluorescence recovery at 2.4 kbar from 75% to 40-55%. In order to directly study binding of anti-Met antibodies to mAb 4-4-20, monoclonal anti-Met antibody 3A5-1 was labeled with 2-dimethylaminonaphthalene-5-sulfonyl chloride (2,5-Dns-Cl) and Dns fluorescence anisotropy measured. Unliganded mAb 4-4-20 did not bind to 2,5-Dns-3A5-1 as indicated by the absence of measurable changes in Dns fluorescence anisotropy upon increasing mAb concentration. Addition of mAb 4-4-20 bound to Fl produced a sigmoidal increase in Dns anisotropy, compatible with association of the primary immune complex and 3A5-1. An affinity constant, K0.5, of 1.5 x 10(-7) M and a cooperativity coefficient (n) of 3.1 were calculated for formation of the Fl-mAb 4-4-20 complex. The HPF-mAb 4-4-20 complex was also recognized by 2,5-Dns-3A5-1 but with lower affinity, indicating that the monoclonal anti-Met 3A5-1 distinguished between mAb 4-4-20 liganded to different haptens."
https://openalex.org/W1560237567,"Four hamster monoclonal anti-metatype antibodies were characterized in terms of their binding properties with liganded murine monoclonal single-chain antifluorescein antibody 4-4-20. Based on induced delays in the rate of ligand (fluorescein) dissociation upon the binding of each monoclonal anti-Met antibody, apparent Kd values were determined for monoclonal antibodies 3A5-1, P1E11, 4A6, and 2C3 (3.6 x 10(-8), 3.6 x 10(-8), 5.0 x 10(-8), and 2.6 x 10(-7) M, respectively). The interaction of hamster monoclonal antibody 3A5-1 with liganded SCA 4-4-20 and IgG 4-4-20 was also evaluated on the basis of deuterium oxide exchange to assess the relative ability of each antibody to stabilize the intrinsic dynamics of the variable domains of the single-chain molecule. The results indicated a correlation between the apparent Kd of the monoclonal anti-Met antibody and the degree of delay in the rate of ligand dissociation from the primary antibody."
https://openalex.org/W1529981732,"We have previously shown that protein kinase C (PKC) depletion is associated with an increase in the proliferation of interleukin 3 (IL-3)-induced mast cells. Here we show that the AP-1 components c-Jun and c-Fos are induced by IL-3. While c-Jun's induction by IL-3 is totally dependent on PKC, c-Fos induction by IL-3 is only attenuated by PKC depletion. AP-1 binding activity was also induced by IL-3 but this induction was PKC independent. These results indicated a possible involvement of c-Jun in the inhibition of IL-3-induced growth regulation. A support for this assumption came from experiments in which an increase in thymidine incorporation into mast cells was noted when c-jun antisense oligomers were administered to IL-3-treated cells. Since the only known effect of direct inhibition of c-Jun on proliferation rates in several cellular systems was a reduction of proliferation, we verified that our c-jun antisense oligomer could also inhibit proliferation rates in fibroblasts where such a repression was previously reported. Thus c-Jun has an inhibitory effect on IL-3 induction of mast cells proliferation that is distinct from its role in several other cellular environments. These observations reveal the involvement of AP-1 and its components in IL-3-induced signal transduction and the importance of the mast cell environment in determining their specific cellular function."
