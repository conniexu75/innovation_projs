We used the Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman and Luminescence for Organics and Chemicals (SHERLOC) instrument to perform deep-ultraviolet Raman and fluorescence spectroscopy of three rocks within the crater. We identify evidence for two distinct ancient aqueous environments at different times. Reactions with liquid water formed carbonates in an olivine-rich igneous rock. A sulfate-perchlorate mixture is present in the rocks, which probably formed by later modifications of the rocks by brine. Fluorescence signatures consistent with aromatic organic compounds occur throughout these rocks and are preserved in minerals related to both aqueous environments."

Despite its importance, the essential regulators of ZGA remain largely unknown in mammals. On the basis of de novo motif searches, we identified the orphan nuclear receptor Nr5a2 as a key activator of major ZGA in mouse two-cell embryos. Nr5a2 is required for progression beyond the two-cell stage. It binds to its motif within SINE B1/Alu retrotransposable elements found in cis-regulatory regions of ZGA genes. Chemical inhibition suggests that 72% of ZGA genes are regulated by Nr5a2 and potentially other orphan nuclear receptors. Nr5a2 promotes chromatin accessibility during ZGA and binds nucleosomal DNA in vitro. We conclude that Nr5a2 is an essential pioneer factor that regulates ZGA."
https://openalex.org/W4309873868,"Quantum sensors are used for precision timekeeping, field sensing, and quantum communication. Comparisons among a distributed network of these sensors are capable of, for example, synchronizing clocks at different locations. The performance of a sensor network is limited by technical challenges as well as the inherent noise associated with the quantum states used to realize the network. For networks with only local entanglement at each node, the noise performance of the network improves at best with square root of the number of nodes. Here, we demonstrate that nonlocal entanglement between network nodes offers better scaling with network size. A shared quantum nondemolition measurement entangles a clock network with up to four nodes. This network provides up to 4.5 dB better precision than one without nonlocal entanglement, and 11.6 dB improvement as compared to a network of sensors operating at the quantum projection noise limit. We demonstrate the generality of the approach with atomic clock and atomic interferometer protocols, in scientific and technologically relevant configurations optimized for intrinsically differential comparisons of sensor outputs."
https://openalex.org/W4309873897,"The cerebellum is thought to help detect and correct errors between intended and executed commands1,2 and is critical for social behaviours, cognition and emotion3–6. Computations for motor control must be performed quickly to correct errors in real time and should be sensitive to small differences between patterns for fine error correction while being resilient to noise7. Influential theories of cerebellar information processing have largely assumed random network connectivity, which increases the encoding capacity of the network’s first layer8–13. However, maximizing encoding capacity reduces the resilience to noise7. To understand how neuronal circuits address this fundamental trade-off, we mapped the feedforward connectivity in the mouse cerebellar cortex using automated large-scale transmission electron microscopy and convolutional neural network-based image segmentation. We found that both the input and output layers of the circuit exhibit redundant and selective connectivity motifs, which contrast with prevailing models. Numerical simulations suggest that these redundant, non-random connectivity motifs increase the resilience to noise at a negligible cost to the overall encoding capacity. This work reveals how neuronal network structure can support a trade-off between encoding capacity and redundancy, unveiling principles of biological network architecture with implications for the design of artificial neural networks. Mapping of the mouse cerebellar cortex using 3D reconstruction from electron microscopy, as well as numerical simulation of neuronal activity, shows non-random redundancy of connectivity that may favour resilient learning over encoding capacity."
https://openalex.org/W4309905423,"Abstract Most of the light from blazars, active galactic nuclei with jets of magnetized plasma that point nearly along the line of sight, is produced by high-energy particles, up to around 1 TeV. Although the jets are known to be ultimately powered by a supermassive black hole, how the particles are accelerated to such high energies has been an unanswered question. The process must be related to the magnetic field, which can be probed by observations of the polarization of light from the jets. Measurements of the radio to optical polarization—the only range available until now—probe extended regions of the jet containing particles that left the acceleration site days to years earlier 1–3 , and hence do not directly explore the acceleration mechanism, as could X-ray measurements. Here we report the detection of X-ray polarization from the blazar Markarian 501 (Mrk 501). We measure an X-ray linear polarization degree Π X of around 10%, which is a factor of around 2 higher than the value at optical wavelengths, with a polarization angle parallel to the radio jet. This points to a shock front as the source of particle acceleration and also implies that the plasma becomes increasingly turbulent with distance from the shock."

https://openalex.org/W4309873870,"In most naturally occurring superconductors, electrons with opposite spins form Cooper pairs. This includes both conventional s-wave superconductors such as aluminium, as well as high-transition-temperature, d-wave superconductors. Materials with intrinsic p-wave superconductivity, hosting Cooper pairs made of equal-spin electrons, have not been conclusively identified, nor synthesized, despite promising progress1–3. Instead, engineered platforms where s-wave superconductors are brought into contact with magnetic materials have shown convincing signatures of equal-spin pairing4–6. Here we directly measure equal-spin pairing between spin-polarized quantum dots. This pairing is proximity-induced from an s-wave superconductor into a semiconducting nanowire with strong spin–orbit interaction. We demonstrate such pairing by showing that breaking a Cooper pair can result in two electrons with equal spin polarization. Our results demonstrate controllable detection of singlet and triplet pairing between the quantum dots. Achieving such triplet pairing in a sequence of quantum dots will be required for realizing an artificial Kitaev chain7–9. Controllable detection of singlet and triplet Cooper pair splitting via crossed Andreev reflection is demonstrated in spin-polarized quantum dots on a superconducting nanowire platform with strong spin–orbit coupling."
https://openalex.org/W4309700628,"Abstract The heterogeneity of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) might be ascribed to differences in origin. CD10 and GPR77 have been reported to identify a chemoresistance-inducing CAF subset in breast cancer. However, the precise mechanism for the formation of the CD10 + GPR77 + CAFs remains unknown. In this study, we found that CCL18 expression was positively correlated with the density of CD10 + GPR77 + CAFs in breast cancer and associated with a poor response to chemotherapy. Moreover, CCL18 secreted by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) activated a CD10 + GPR77 + CAF phenotype in normal breast-resident fibroblasts (NBFs), which could then enrich cancer stem cells (CSCs) and induce chemoresistance in breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, CCL18 activated NF-κB signaling via PITPNM3 and thus enhanced the production of IL-6 and IL-8. Furthermore, intratumoral CCL18 injection significantly induced the activation of NBFs and the chemoresistance of xenografts in vivo. In addition, targeting CCL18 by anti-CCL18 antibody could inhibit the formation of CD10 + GPR77 + CAFs and recover the chemosensitivity in vivo, leading to effective tumor control. Collectively, these findings reveal that inflammatory signaling crosstalk between TAMs and fibroblasts is responsible for the formation of the CD10 + GPR77 + CAFs, suggesting CCL18–PITPNM3 signaling is a potential therapeutic target to block the activation of this specific CAF subtype and tumor chemoresistance."
https://openalex.org/W4309905329,"Abstract The somatosensory system decodes a range of tactile stimuli to generate a coherent sense of touch. Discriminative touch of the body depends on signals conveyed from peripheral mechanoreceptors to the brain through the spinal cord dorsal column and its brainstem target, the dorsal column nuclei (DCN) 1,2 . Models of somatosensation emphasize that fast-conducting low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) innervating the skin drive the DCN 3,4 . However, postsynaptic dorsal column (PSDC) neurons within the spinal cord dorsal horn also collect mechanoreceptor signals and form a second major input to the DCN 5–7 . The significance of PSDC neurons and their contributions to the coding of touch have remained unclear since their discovery. Here we show that direct LTMR input to the DCN conveys vibrotactile stimuli with high temporal precision. Conversely, PSDC neurons primarily encode touch onset and the intensity of sustained contact into the high-force range. LTMR and PSDC signals topographically realign in the DCN to preserve precise spatial detail. Different DCN neuron subtypes have specialized responses that are generated by distinct combinations of LTMR and PSDC inputs. Thus, LTMR and PSDC subdivisions of the dorsal column encode different tactile features and differentially converge in the DCN to generate specific ascending sensory processing streams."
https://openalex.org/W4309873855,"The poly-ADP-ribosyltransferase tankyrase (TNKS, TNKS2) controls a wide range of disease-relevant cellular processes, including WNT-β-catenin signalling, telomere length maintenance, Hippo signalling, DNA damage repair and glucose homeostasis1,2. This has incentivized the development of tankyrase inhibitors. Notwithstanding, our knowledge of the mechanisms that control tankyrase activity has remained limited. Both catalytic and non-catalytic functions of tankyrase depend on its filamentous polymerization3-5. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of a filament formed by a minimal active unit of tankyrase, comprising the polymerizing sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain and its adjacent catalytic domain. The SAM domain forms a novel antiparallel double helix, positioning the protruding catalytic domains for recurring head-to-head and tail-to-tail interactions. The head interactions are highly conserved among tankyrases and induce an allosteric switch in the active site within the catalytic domain to promote catalysis. Although the tail interactions have a limited effect on catalysis, they are essential to tankyrase function in WNT-β-catenin signalling. This work reveals a novel SAM domain polymerization mode, illustrates how supramolecular assembly controls catalytic and non-catalytic functions, provides important structural insights into the regulation of a non-DNA-dependent poly-ADP-ribosyltransferase and will guide future efforts to modulate tankyrase and decipher its contribution to disease mechanisms."

Reasons for underuse and inequity may include community member lack of awareness or healthcare access barriers, among others. This study assessed mAbs community awareness and opportunities for improving equitable mAb access.A concurrent mixed methods study including surveys and focus groups with adults with high-risk conditions or their proxy decision-makers. Surveys and focus group guides addressed diffusion of innovation theory factors. Descriptive statistics and Fisher's exact method was used to report and compare survey findings by race and ethnicity. Rapid qualitative methods were used for focus group analysis.Surveys from 515 individuals (460 English, 54 Spanish, 1 Amharic), and 8 focus groups (6 English, 2 Spanish) with 69 participants, completed June 2021 to January 2022. Most survey respondents (75%) had heard little or nothing about mAbs, but 95% would consider getting mAb treatment. Hispanic/Latino and Non-Hispanic People of Color (POC) reported less awareness, greater concern about intravenous infusions, and less trust in mAb safety and effectiveness than White, Non-Hispanic respondents. Focus group themes included little awareness but high interest in mAb treatment and concerns about cost and access barriers such as lacking established sources of care and travel from rural communities. Focus groups revealed preferences for broad-reaching but tailored messaging strategies using multiple media and trusted community leaders.Despite unfamiliarity with mAb treatment, most respondents were open to receiving mAbs or recommending mAbs to others. While mAb messaging should have broad reach ""to everyone everywhere,"" racial and geographic disparities in awareness and trust about mAbs underscore need for tailored messaging to promote equitable access. Care processes should address patient-level barriers like transportation, insurance, or primary care access. COVID-19 treatment dissemination strategies should promote health equity."
https://openalex.org/W4309866200,"Objective Depression is positively correlated with the high incidence and low survival rate of cancers, while more cancer patients suffer depression. However, the interaction between depression and cancer, and possible underline mechanisms are unclear. Methods Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) was used to induce depression, and smoke to induce lung cancer in lung cancer vulnerable AJ mice. After 8 weeks, sucrose preference and forced swimming behaviors were tested. Blood corticosterone concentration, and levels of cytokines, lung cancer-related factors, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and apoptosis-related factors in the lung, amygdala and hippocampus were measured. Results Compared to control group, CUMS or smoke decreased sucrose consumption and increased immobility time, which were deteriorated by stress+smoke. CUMS, smoke or both combination decreased mononuclear viability and lung TNF-α concentration, increased serum corticosterone and lung interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 and HSP-90α concentrations. Furthermore, stress+smoke caused more increase in corticosterone and IL-10, but decreased TNF-α. In parallel, in the lung, Bcl-2/Bax and lung cancer-related factors CDK1, CDC20, P38α etc were significantly increased in stress+smoke group. Moreover, CUMS decreased BDNF, while CUMS or smoke increased TrkB and P75 concentrations, which were exacerbated by stress+smoke. In the amygdala, except for CUMS largely increased Bax/Bcl-2 and decreased TrkB, each single factor decreased BDNF and IL-10, but increased P75, IL-1β, IL-12, TNF-α concentrations. Changes in Bax/Bcl-2, IL-10 and TNF-α were further aggravated by the combination. In the hippocampus, except for CUMS largely increased P75 concentration, each single factor significantly increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, IL-1β and TNF-α, but decreased BDNF, TrkB and IL-10 concentrations. Changes in Bax, Bax/Bcl-2, IL-10 and TNF-α were further aggravated by the combination. Conclusion These results suggest that a synergy between CUMS and smoke exposure could promote the development of depression and lung cancer, through CUMS increased the risk of cancer occurrence, and conversely lung cancer inducer smoke exposure deteriorated depressive symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W4309874202,"Peatlands account for 15 to 30% of the world's soil carbon (C) stock and are important controls over global nitrogen (N) cycles. However, C and N concentrations are known to vary among peatlands contributing to the uncertainty of global C inventories, but there are few global studies that relate peatland classification to peat chemistry. We analyzed 436 peat cores sampled in 24 countries across six continents and measured C, N, and organic matter (OM) content at three depths down to 70 cm. Sites were distinguished between northern (387) and tropical (49) peatlands and assigned to one of six distinct broadly recognized peatland categories that vary primarily along a pH gradient. Peat C and N concentrations, OM content, and C:N ratios differed significantly among peatland categories, but few differences in chemistry with depth were found within each category. Across all peatlands C and N concentrations in the 10-20 cm layer, were 440 ± 85.1 g kg-1 and 13.9 ± 7.4 g kg-1, with an average C:N ratio of 30.1 ± 20.8. Among peatland categories, median C concentrations were highest in bogs, poor fens and tropical swamps (446-532 g kg-1) and lowest in intermediate and extremely rich fens (375-414 g kg-1). The C:OM ratio in peat was similar across most peatland categories, except in deeper samples from ombrotrophic tropical peat swamps that were higher than other peatlands categories. Peat N concentrations and C:N ratios varied approximately two-fold among peatland categories and N concentrations tended to be higher (and C:N lower) in intermediate fens compared with other peatland types. This study reports on a unique data set and demonstrates that differences in peat C and OM concentrations among broadly classified peatland categories are predictable, which can aid future studies that use land cover assessments to refine global peatland C and N stocks."
https://openalex.org/W4309914123,"Preeclampsia is a multi-system disease that can have severe, even fatal implications for the mother and fetus. Abnormal placentation can lead to ischaemic tissue injury and placental inflammation. In turn, the placenta releases anti-angiogenic factors into the maternal circulation. These systemically act to neutralise angiogenic factors causing endothelial dysfunction causing preeclampsia. Hydroxychloroquine is an immune modulating drug that is considered safe in pregnancy. There is epidemiological evidence suggesting it may reduce the risk of preeclampsia. Here, we examined the effects hydroxychloroquine on the production and secretion of sFlt-1, soluble endoglin (sENG), placental growth factor (PlGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in primary human placenta, cytotrophoblasts and umbilical vein endothelial cells (endothelial cell model). Hydroxychloroquine treatment decreased mRNA expression of two sFlt-1 isoforms and its protein secretion. sENG was not reduced. Hydroxychloroquine treatment increased secretion of pro-angiogenic factor PIGF from endothelial cells. It did not significantly reduce the expression of the endothelial cell inflammation marker, ET-1, and inflammation induced expression of the adhesion molecule, VCAM. Hydroxychloroquine could not overcome leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. Hydroxychloroquine mitigates features of preeclampsia, but it does not reduce key markers of endothelial dysfunction."

We estimated household and healthcare economic burdens of typhoid in Blantyre, Malawi.In a prospective cohort of culture-confirmed typhoid cases at two primary- and a referral-level health facility, we collected direct medical, non-medical costs (2020 U.S. dollars) to healthcare provider, plus indirect costs to households.From July 2019-March 2020, of 109 cases, 63 (58%) were <15 years old, 44 (40%) were inpatients. Mean hospitalization length was 7.7 days (SD 4.1). For inpatients, mean total household and provider costs were $93.85 (95%CI: 68.87-118.84) and $296.52 (95%CI: 225.79-367.25), respectively. For outpatients, these costs were $19.05 (95%CI: 4.38-33.71) and $39.65 (95%CI: 33.93-45.39), respectively. Household costs were due mainly to direct non-medical and indirect costs, medical care was free. Catastrophic illness cost, defined as cost >40% of non-food monthly household expenditure, occurred in 48 (44%) households.Typhoid can be economically catastrophic for families, despite accessible free medical care. Typhoid is costly for government healthcare provision. These data make an economic case for TCV introduction in Malawi and the region and will be used to derive vaccine cost-effectiveness."
https://openalex.org/W4309922096,"Regardless of the improvements in diagnostic and therapeutic methods, the clinical outcomes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients remain poor. Although accumulating evidence indicates that lncRNAs (long noncoding RNAs) are essential within the control of tumorigenesis and the metastasis of cancer, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. This work explored the pattern of expression and functional significance of a newly found lncRNA, Ewing sarcoma-associated transcript 1 (EWSAT1), in HCC metastasis. The results indicated that EWSAT1 was upregulated significantly in HCC relative to that in normal tissues and was correlated with an aggressive phenotype and low patient survival. Functional experiments demonstrated that EWSAT1 could promote proliferation and HCC cell metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, EWSAT1 binds directly to Yes-associated protein (YAP), promotes Sarcoma gene (Src)-induced phosphorylation of YAP, facilitates nuclear translocation of YAP, and consequently, activates the transcription of Hippo-YAP signaling target genes involved in cancer evolution. This study found that EWSAT1 plays a crucial role in HCC metastasis and that it has the potential to be a prognosis biomarker and a target for therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W4309694247,"During development, regulatory factors appear in a precise order to determine cell fates over time. Consequently, to investigate complex tissue development, it is necessary to visualize and manipulate cell lineages with temporal control. Current strategies for tracing vertebrate cell lineages lack genetic access to sequentially produced cells. Here, we present TEMPO (Temporal Encoding and Manipulation in a Predefined Order), an imaging-readable genetic tool allowing differential labeling and manipulation of consecutive cell generations in vertebrates. TEMPO is based on CRISPR and powered by a cascade of gRNAs that drive orderly activation and inactivation of reporters and/or effectors. Using TEMPO to visualize zebrafish and mouse neurogenesis, we recapitulated birth-order-dependent neuronal fates. Temporally manipulating cell-cycle regulators in mouse cortex progenitors altered the proportion and distribution of neurons and glia, revealing the effects of temporal gene perturbation on serial cell fates. Thus, TEMPO enables sequential manipulation of molecular factors, crucial to study cell-type specification."

The mechanisms of interaction of aminosterols with cells are, however, still largely uncharacterized. Here, by using fluorescently labeled trodusquemine (TRO-A594 and TRO-ATTO565), we show that trodusquemine binds initially to the plasma membrane of living cells, that the binding affinity is dependent on cholesterol, and that trodusquemine is then internalized and mainly targeted to lysosomes after internalization. We also found that TRO-A594 is able to strongly and selectively bind to myelinated fibers in fixed mouse brain slices, and that it is a marker compatible with tissue clearing and light-sheet fluorescence microscopy or expansion microscopy. In conclusion, this work contributes to further characterize the biology of aminosterols and provides a new tool for nerve labeling suitable for the most advanced microscopy techniques."
https://openalex.org/W4309896468,"The therapeutic toxicity and resistance to currently available treatment options are major clinical challenges for the management of lung cancer. As a novel strategy, we synthesized analogues of a known flavonol, fisetin, which has shown anti-tumorigenic potential against cancer in cell culture with no adverse effects in animal models. We studied the synthetic analogues of fisetin for their anti-cancer potential against lung cancer cells, toxicity in mice and efficacy in a xenograft model. Brominated fisetin analogues were screened for their effects on the viability of A549 and H1299 lung cancer cells, and three analogues (3a, 3b, 3c), showed improved activity compared to fisetin. These analogues were more effective in restricting lung cancer cell proliferation, inducing G2 M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The fisetin analogues also downregulated EGFR/ERK1/2/STAT3 pathways. Fisetin analogue-induced apoptosis was accompanied by a higher Bax to Bcl-2 expression ratio. Based on the in vitro studies, the most effective fisetin analogue 3b was evaluated for in vivo toxicity, wherein it did not show any hepatotoxicity or adverse health effects in mice. Furthermore, analogue 3b showed greater antitumor efficacy (p < .001) as compared to its parent compound fisetin in a human lung cancer cell xenograft study in athymic mice. Together, our data suggest that the novel fisetin analogue 3b is more effective in restricting lung cancer cell growth, both in vitro as well as in vivo, without any apparent toxicity, supporting its further development as a novel anti-lung cancer agent."
https://openalex.org/W4309921693,"Diabetes shortens the life expectancy by more than a decade, and the excess mortality in diabetes is correlated with the incidence of kidney disease. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease. Macrophage accumulation predicts the severity of kidney injury in human biopsies and experimental models of DKD. However, the mechanism underlying macrophage recruitment in diabetes glomeruli is unclear. Elevated plasma growth hormone (GH) levels in type I diabetes and acromegalic individuals impaired glomerular biology. In this study, we examined whether GH-stimulated podocytes contribute to macrophage accumulation. RNA-seq analysis revealed elevated TNF-α signaling in GH-treated human podocytes. Conditioned media from GH-treated podocytes (GH-CM) induced differentiation of monocytes to macrophages. On the other hand, neutralization of GH-CM with the TNF-α antibody diminished GH-CM's action on monocytes. The treatment of mice with GH resulted in increased macrophage recruitment, podocyte injury, and proteinuria. Furthermore, we noticed the activation of TNF-α signaling, macrophage accumulation, and fibrosis in DKD patients' kidney biopsies. Our findings suggest that podocytes could secrete TNF-α and contribute to macrophage migration, resulting in DKD-related renal inflammation. Inhibition of either GH action or TNF-α expression in podocytes could be a novel therapeutic approach for DKD treatment."

In turn, residential water costs from municipal utilities are predicted to rise to unaffordable rates for poor residential water customers. Building on a regional conjunctive use model with future climate scenarios and 50-year future water supply plans, our study communicates the effects of climate change on poor people in El Paso, Texas, as water becomes more difficult and expensive to obtain in future years. Four scenarios for future water supply and future water costs were delineated based on expected impacts of climate change and groundwater depletion. Residential water use was calculated by census tract in El Paso, using basic needs indoor water use and evaporative cooling use as determinants of household water consumption. Based on household size and income data from the US Census, fraction of household income spent on water was determined. Results reveal that in the future, basic water supply will be a significant burden for 40% of all households in El Paso. Impacts are geographically concentrated in poor census tracts. Our study revealed that negative impacts from water resource depletion and increasing populations in El Paso will lead to costly and difficult water for El Paso water users. We provide an example of how to connect future resource scenarios, including those affected by climate change, to challenges of affordability for vulnerable consumers."

A. baldaniorum has a variety of proteins potentially involved in controlling the turnover of c-di-GMP many of which are coupled to sensory domains that could be involved in establishing a mutualistic relationship with the host. Here, we present in silico analysis and experimental characterization of the function of CdgB (AZOBR_p410089), a predicted MHYT-PAS-GGDEF-EAL multidomain protein from A. baldaniorum Sp245. When overproduced, CdgB behaves predominantly as a c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) in A. baldaniorum Sp245. It inhibits biofilm formation and extracellular polymeric substances production and promotes swimming motility. However, a CdgB variant with a degenerate PDE domain behaves as diguanylate cyclase (DGC). This strongly suggest that CdgB is capable of dual activity. Variants with alterations in the DGC domain and the MHYT domain negatively affects extracellular polymeric substances production and induction of swimming motility. Surprisingly, we observed that overproduction of CdgB results in increased c-di-GMP accumulation in the heterologous host Escherichia coli, suggesting under certain conditions, the WT CdgB variant can behave predominantly as a DGC. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that CdgB is anchored to the cell membrane and localizes potentially to the cell poles. This localization is dependent on the presence of the MHYT domain. In summary, our results suggest that CdgB can provide versatility to signaling modules that control motile and sessile lifestyles in response to key environmental signals in A. baldaniorum."

Of 36 participants with a FAST score > 0.35, 29 (80.6%) participants had MAFLD and 23 (63.9%) participants had NAFLD. Of 29 patients with liver fibrosis, 26 (89.7%) participants had obesity and metabolic dysregulation. In the evaluation of diet, the total energy, protein, dietary fiber, and salt intake were significantly higher in participants with MAFLD than those in participants without fatty liver. In the microbiota analysis, the results of the linear discriminant analysis effect size analysis revealed nine bacterial genera that were significantly different in participants with MAFLD in comparison with participants without fatty liver. Of these genera, the relative abundance of Blautia was especially low in participants with MAFLD.In a resident health survey, participants with MAFLD had a higher proportion of fatty liver than those with NAFLD. MAFLD criteria could help in improved screening of participants with liver fibrosis. Therefore, the MAFLD criteria could be a useful diagnostic tool for aggressively identifying participants with a high risk of fatty liver.

However, the evaluation is often more complex at an urban scale, due to a lack of building characteristics and demographic data. In the present paper, we propose a method, which is based on the representative building concept that can be used to quantify the potential benefits of rainwater harvesting at different scales, that is, from the building scale to the district and city scales. Particular attention has been paid to the sizing of the system so that it can be used for different rainwater collection purposes. The method has been applied to the city of Turin (Italy) considering different scenarios: 1) domestic use (e.g., toilet flushing and the washing machine), where buildings are independent of each other, and 2) two public uses (the irrigation of public green areas and street washing), for which we have hypothesized that the rainwater collection takes place at a district scale. The non-potable water saving for domestic use varies across the city from 29% to 62%, according to the characteristics of the buildings, while the reduction of the flow peak conveyed to the sewerage system, during extreme storms, is quite constant (in the 57–67% range). Irrigation and street washing require a lower amount of water, thus about 80% of water can be saved, but the retention efficiency is low, and a slight reduction in the flow peaks can be expected. The aim of the methodology presented in this work is to provide a suitable decision-making tool for policy makers and urban planners to evaluate the capability and efficiency of rainwater harvesting systems for buildings, districts, and cities."
https://openalex.org/W4309865614,"Contaminated surfaces are one of the ways that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be transmitted. SARS-CoV-2 can be detected on environmental surfaces; however, few environmental sampling studies have been conducted in nonclinical settings. The objective of this study was to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA on environmental surfaces in public areas in Las Vegas, Nevada. In total, 300 surface samples were collected from high-touch surfaces from high-congregate public locations and from a public health facility (PHF) that was visited by COVID-19 patients. Environmental samples were analyzed with quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) using SARS-CoV-2 specific primers and probes for three target genes. Results showed that 31 out of 300 (10.3%) surface samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 24 at the PHF and 7 in high-congregate public locations. Concentrations ranged from 10 2 to 10 6 viral particles per 3 ml sample on a wide variety of materials. The data also showed that the N gene assay had greater sensitivity compared to the S and ORF gene assays. Besides frequently touched surfaces, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in restrooms, on floors and surfaces in contact with floors, as well as in a mop water sample. The results of this study describe the extent and distribution of environmental SARS-CoV-2 contamination in public areas in Las Vegas, Nevada. A method using the N gene PCR assay was developed for SARS-CoV-2 environmental monitoring in public areas. Environmental monitoring with this method can determine the specific sites of surface contamination in the community and may be beneficial for prevention of COVID-19 indirect transmission, and evaluation and improvement of infection control practices in public areas, public health facilities, universities, and businesses."
https://openalex.org/W4309874414,"Pharmacies are the first point of contact for women seeking medical abortion (MA) and act as important sources of information and referral in Nepal. Over the counter sale of MA drugs is not currently allowed in Nepal. This study aimed to assess the MA drug dispensing practices of pharmacy workers using mystery clients in Nepal.A cross-sectional study using the mystery client approach was conducted in 266 pharmacies in September-October 2019. These pharmacies had either received harm reduction training or medical detailing visits. A total of 532 visits were conducted by six male and six female mystery clients. Mystery clients without prescription approached the sample pharmacy and filled out a standard digital survey questionnaire using the SurveyCTO application immediately after each interaction.Pharmacy workers dispensed MA drugs in 35.7% of the visits while they refused to provide MA drugs to the mystery clients in 39.3% of visits. Lack of evidence of prior consultation with a physician (27.5%), referral to other health facilities (21.8%), unavailability of MA drugs in the pharmacy (21.3%) and lack of prescription (16.4%) were the main reasons for refusal. Seventy percent of the pharmacy workers inquired clients about last menstrual period/months of pregnancy while 38.1% asked whether the pregnancy status was confirmed. During 65.1% of the visits, mystery clients were told about when to take the MA drugs while in 66.4% of visits, they were told about the route of drug administration. Similarly, mystery clients were briefed about what to expect during the abortion process in half of the visits, and information about the possible side effects of the MA drug was provided in 55.9% of the visits. Pharmacy workers provided correct information on taking MA drugs to mystery clients in 70.7% of visits.Despite legal provision of sale of MA drugs only on prescription, pharmacy workers dispensed MA drug in one out of three visits. As pharmacies are the initial contacts of women for abortion services in Nepal, correct supplementary information through pharmacy workers can be an effective strategy to expand access to quality safe abortion services."
https://openalex.org/W4309923378,"Abstract BRAF-mutated melanoma relapsing after targeted therapies is an aggressive disease with unmet clinical need. Hence the need to identify novel combination therapies able to overcome drug resistance. miRNAs have emerged as orchestrators of non-genetic mechanisms adopted by melanoma cells to challenge therapies. In this context we previously identified a subset of oncosuppressor miRNAs downregulated in drug-resistant melanomas. Here we demonstrate that lipid nanoparticles co-encapsulating two of them, miR-199-5p and miR-204-5p, inhibit tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo in combination with target therapy and block the development of drug resistance. Mechanistically they act by directly reducing melanoma cell growth and also indirectly by hampering the recruitment and reprogramming of pro-tumoral macrophages. Molecularly, we demonstrate that the effects on macrophages are mediated by the dysregulation of a newly identified miR-204-5p-miR-199b-5p/CCL5 axis. Finally, we unveiled that M2 macrophages programs are molecular signatures of resistance and predict response to therapy in patients. Overall, these findings have strong translational implications to propose new combination therapies making use of RNA therapeutics for metastatic melanoma patients."
https://openalex.org/W4309927928,"Time series sensor data classification tasks often suffer from training data scarcity issue due to the expenses associated with the expert-intervened annotation efforts. For example, Electrocardiogram (ECG) data classification for cardio-vascular disease (CVD) detection requires expensive labeling procedures with the help of cardiologists. Current state-of-the-art algorithms like deep learning models have shown outstanding performance under the general requirement of availability of large set of training examples. In this paper, we propose Shapley Attributed Ablation with Augmented Learning: ShapAAL, which demonstrates that deep learning algorithm with suitably selected subset of the seen examples or ablating the unimportant ones from the given limited training dataset can ensure consistently better classification performance under augmented training. In ShapAAL, additive perturbed training augments the input space to compensate the scarcity in training examples using Residual Network (ResNet) architecture through perturbation-induced inputs, while Shapley attribution seeks the subset from the augmented training space for better learnability with the goal of better general predictive performance, thanks to the “efficiency” and “null player” axioms of transferable utility games upon which Shapley value game is formulated. In ShapAAL, the subset of training examples that contribute positively to a supervised learning setup is derived from the notion of coalition games using Shapley values associated with each of the given inputs’ contribution into the model prediction. ShapAAL is a novel push-pull deep architecture where the subset selection through Shapley value attribution pushes the model to lower dimension while augmented training augments the learning capability of the model over unseen data. We perform ablation study to provide the empirical evidence of our claim and we show that proposed ShapAAL method consistently outperforms the current baselines and state-of-the-art algorithms for time series sensor data classification tasks from publicly available UCR time series archive that includes different practical important problems like detection of CVDs from ECG data."
https://openalex.org/W4309928074,"The stress placed on global power supply systems by the growing demand for electricity has been steadily increasing in recent years. Thus, accurate forecasting of energy demand and consumption is essential to maintain the lifestyle and economic standards of nations sustainably. However, multiple factors, including climate change, affect the energy demands of local, national, and global power grids. Therefore, effective analysis of multivariable data is required for the accurate estimation of energy demand and consumption. In this context, some studies have suggested that LSTM and CNN models can be used to model electricity demand accurately. However, existing works have utilized training based on either electricity loads and weather observations or national metrics e.g., gross domestic product, imports, and exports. This binary segregation has degraded forecasting performance. To resolve this shortcoming, we propose a CNN-LSTM model based on a multivariable augmentation approach. Based on previous studies, we adopt 1D convolution and pooling to extract undiscovered features from temporal sequences. LSTM outperforms RNN on vanishing gradient problems while retaining its benefits regarding time-series variables. The proposed model exhibits near-perfect forecasting of electricity consumption, outperforming existing models. Further, state-level analysis and training are performed, demonstrating the utility of the proposed methodology in forecasting regional energy consumption. The proposed model outperforms other models in most areas."
https://openalex.org/W4309865349,"In the United States, the discovery and spread of white-nose syndrome (WNS) has drastically changed how bats and caves are managed. The U.S. National Park Service has been instrumental in the national response to WNS, as it manages extensive cave resources and has a close relationship with the public. However, managers lack information on visitor support for disease prevention measures designed to slow the spread of WNS and minimize human disturbance of vulnerable bat populations. This study utilized the Theory of Planned Behavior to determine how visitor attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral controls influenced their behavior regarding WNS preventive actions, including participation in educational programming on bats, wearing clothes or shoes in caves that have not been contaminated with the fungus that causes WNS, walking over decontamination mats, and complying with cave closures. During summer of 2019, data were collected using an on-site survey of 1365 visitors to eight U.S. national park units: Oregon Caves, Lava Beds, Carlsbad Caverns, El Malpais, Wind Cave, Jewel Cave, Mammoth Cave, and Cumberland Gap. Visitors were willing to participate in all preventative actions addressed in the survey (77.7%-96.7%). Visitors expressed that engaging in these actions was very desirable (36.0%-65.6%), and their decision to engage in these actions was most strongly influenced by park staff (39.2%-68.8%) or signage (35.5%-61.9%). Attitudes and subjective norms were positive predictors of behavioral intentions for all measures. Perceived behavioral control was not a direct predictor for behavioral intent, but its interaction with attitudes and subjective norms had a moderating influence on intention to comply with multiple WNS preventive actions. With the continued spread of WNS and emergence of other threats to bats, understanding visitor behavioral intent and underlying factors will facilitate successful implementation of preventive actions that are publicly supported and promote conservation of bat populations in U.S. national parks."
https://openalex.org/W4309865363,"Many social, cultural, and systemic challenges affect the uptake of measles immunisation services. Prior studies have looked at the caregivers’ perspectives, but little is known about the perspectives of the health care providers on the barriers of measles immunisation services in Canada. This study examined measles immunisation coverage trends across the regional health authorities in Saskatchewan and explored the barriers and enablers to measles immunisation coverage from providers’ perspectives. The study adopted an explanatory sequential mixed method. We utilized the entire population of 16,582 children under two years of age available in the Saskatchewan Immunisation Management System (SIMS) registry for 2002 and 2013 in aggregate format and interviewed 18 key informants in pre-determined two-stages in 2016 and 2017. The quantitative analysis was done with Joinpoint regression modelling, while the qualitative interview data was analyzed using hybrid inductive and deductive thematic approaches. There was a 16.89%-point increase in measles immunisation coverage in the province from 56.32% to 73.21% between 2002 and 2013. There was also a persistently higher coverage among the affluent (66.95% - 82.37%) than the most deprived individuals (45.79% - 62.60%) in the study period. The annual rate of coverage change was marginally higher among the most deprived (16.81%; and average annual percentage change (AAPC) 2.0, 95% CI 1.7–2.2) than among the affluent group (15.42% and AAPC 3.0; 95% CI 2.0–4.0). While access-related issues, caregivers’ fears, hesitancy, anti-vaccination challenges, and resource limitations were barriers to immunisation, improving community engagement, service delivery flexibility, targeted social responses and increasing media role were found useful to address the uptake of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases immunisation. There is low coverage and inequity in measles immunisation uptake in Saskatchewan from social and institutional barriers. Even though there is evidence of disparity reduction among the different groups, the barriers to increasing measles immunisation coverage have implications for the health of the socio-economically deprived groups, the healthcare system and other vaccination programs. There is a need to improve policy framework for community engagement, targeted programs, and public health discourse."
https://openalex.org/W4309865504,"Detritivores are essential to nutrient cycling, but are often neglected in trophic networks, due to difficulties with determining their diet. DNA analysis of gut contents shows promise of trophic link discrimination, but many unknown factors limit its usefulness. For example, DNA can be rapidly broken down, especially by digestion processes, and DNA provides only a snapshot of the gut contents at a specific time. Few studies have been performed on the length of time that prey DNA can be detected in consumer guts, and none so far using benthic detritivores. Eutrophication, along with climate change, is altering the phytoplankton communities in aquatic ecosystems, on which benthic detritivores in aphotic soft sediments depend. Nutrient-poor cyanobacteria blooms are increasing in frequency, duration, and magnitude in many water bodies, while nutrient-rich diatom spring blooms are shrinking in duration and magnitude, creating potential changes in diet of benthic detritivores. We performed an experiment to identify the taxonomy and quantify the abundance of phytoplankton DNA fragments on bivalve gut contents, and how long these fragments can be detected after consumption in the Baltic Sea clam Macoma balthica. Two common species of phytoplankton (the cyanobacteria Nodularia spumigena or the diatom Skeletonema marinoi) were fed to M. balthica from two regions (from the northern and southern Stockholm archipelago). After removing the food source, M. balthica gut contents were sampled every 24 hours for seven days to determine the number of 23S rRNA phytoplankton DNA copies and when the phytoplankton DNA could no longer be detected by quantitative PCR. We found no differences in diatom 18S rRNA gene fragments of the clams by region, but the southern clams showed significantly more cyanobacteria 16S rRNA gene fragments in their guts than the northern clams. Interestingly, the cyanobacteria and diatom DNA fragments were still detectable by qPCR in the guts of M. balthica one week after removal from its food source. However, DNA metabarcoding of the 23S rRNA phytoplankton gene found in the clam guts showed that added food (i.e. N. spumigena and S. marinoi) did not make up a majority of the detected diet. Our results suggest that these detritivorous clams therefore do not react as quickly as previously thought to fresh organic matter inputs, with other phytoplankton than large diatoms and cyanobacteria constituting the majority of their diet. This experiment demonstrates the viability of using molecular methods to determine feeding of detritivores, but further studies investigating how prey DNA signals can change over time in benthic detritivores will be needed before this method can be widely applicable to both models of ecological functions and conservation policy."
https://openalex.org/W4309865866,"Ethical livestock production is currently a major concern for consumers. In parallel, research has shown that transport duration is an important factor affecting animal welfare and has a negative impact on the final product quality and on the production cost. This study applied proteomics methods to the animal stress/welfare problem in pigs muscle-exudate with the aim to identify proteins indicative of molecular processes underpinning transport stress and to better characterise this species as a biomedical model. A broader perspective of the problem was obtained by applying label-free LC-MS to characterise the proteome response to transport stress (short or long road transportation) in pigs within the same genetic line. A total of 1,464 proteins were identified, following statistical analysis 66 proteins clearly separating pigs subject to short road transportation and pigs subject long road transportation. These proteins were mainly involved in cellular and metabolic processes. Catalase and stress-induced phosphoprotein-1 were further confirmed by Western blot as being involved in the process of self-protection of the cells in response to stress. This study provide an insight into the molecular processes that are involved in pig adaptability to transport stress and are a step-forward for the development of an objective evaluation method of stress in order to improve animal care and management in farm animals."

Vaccinating a large share of the population is essential for containing the COVID-19 pandemic. However, many individuals refuse to get vaccinated, which might be related to a lack of trust. Using unique survey data from Lithuania during the COVID-19 pandemic, we show that trust in government authorities, science, and pharmaceutical companies are important predictors of individual vaccination intentions. We do not find evidence that trust in strangers, the healthcare system, or the media predict intentions to get vaccinated against COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4309866793,"Background Suicide is the second leading cause of death among young people worldwide and remains a major public health concern. Research indicates that negative social contexts involving familial and peer relationships, have far-reaching influences on levels of suicidal behaviours in later life. Previous systematic reviews have focused on evaluating associations between negative life events such as abuse and bullying in childhood and subsequent self-harm or suicidality. However, the association between adolescent experiences of humiliation and shame, and subsequent self-harm or suicidal behaviour among children and young adults has not been well examined. As such, this systematic review is conducted to examine the prevalence and association between humiliation and shame and self-harm, suicidal ideation, and death by suicide among adolescents and young adults. Methods A systematic literature search in extant electronic databases including; MEDLINE, Web of Science Core Collection, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Embase will be conducted to identify potential studies. Google Scholar, and the reference list of the retrieved articles and/or previous systematic reviews in this area, will also be scanned to identify further potential studies. ProQuest will be searched to identify relevant studies available within grey literature. There are no restrictions on the date of publications. Based on our initial review, the following terms were identified: Population : Adolescent (MESH), young adult (MESH), teen, teenage. Exposure : Humiliation, degradation, shame (MESH) or embarrassment (MESH), harassment victimisation, abasement. Outcome : Self-injurious behaviour (MESH), suicide (MESH), suicide attempted (MESH), suicide completed (MESH), self-harm, intentional self-injury, deliberate self-harm, overdose, deliberate self-poisoning, non-suicidal self-injury, self-mutilation, suicidal thought, suicidal ideation, suicidal intent, suicide. At least one term from each category will be used for conducting the literature search. All original quantitative studies published in the English language which examined the prevalence or association between humiliation or shame and self-harm and/or suicidal ideation and/or completed suicide will be included. The studies will be assessed for methodological quality using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. Narrative synthesis will be performed for all of the studies. If the studies are sufficiently homogenous, the results will be pooled for a meta-analysis. This systematic review protocol followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocol (PRISMA-P) guidelines. The protocol has been registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) [CRD42022289843]. Discussion This is the first review to synthesise evidence on the prevalence of, and associations between the experiences of humiliation and shame and subsequent self-harm and/or suicidal behaviours among adolescents and young adults. As there is growing evidence on increased self-harm among this age group, it is important to identify population-specific risk factors for self-harm and suicidality which will have significance in formulating tailored and effective treatment and therapeutic services for adolescents and young adults."
https://openalex.org/W4309874189,"Exposure to prolonged periods in microgravity is associated with deconditioning of the musculoskeletal system due to chronic changes in mechanical stimulation. Given astronauts will operate on the Lunar surface for extended periods of time, it is critical to quantify both external (e.g., ground reaction forces) and internal (e.g., joint reaction forces) loads of relevant movements performed during Lunar missions. Such knowledge is key to predict musculoskeletal deconditioning and determine appropriate exercise countermeasures associated with extended exposure to hypogravity.The aim of this paper is to define an experimental protocol and methodology suitable to estimate in high-fidelity hypogravity conditions the lower limb internal joint reaction forces. State-of-the-art movement kinetics, kinematics, muscle activation and muscle-tendon unit behaviour during locomotor and plyometric movements will be collected and used as inputs (Objective 1), with musculoskeletal modelling and an optimisation framework used to estimate lower limb internal joint loading (Objective 2).Twenty-six healthy participants will be recruited for this cross-sectional study. Participants will walk, skip and run, at speeds ranging between 0.56-3.6 m/s, and perform plyometric movement trials at each gravity level (1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.38, 0.27 and 0.16g) in a randomized order. Through the collection of state-of-the-art kinetics, kinematics, muscle activation and muscle-tendon behaviour, a musculoskeletal modelling framework will be used to estimate lower limb joint reaction forces via tracking simulations.The results of this study will provide first estimations of internal musculoskeletal loads associated with human movement performed in a range of hypogravity levels. Thus, our unique data will be a key step towards modelling the musculoskeletal deconditioning associated with long term habitation on the Lunar surface, and thereby aiding the design of Lunar exercise countermeasures and mitigation strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4309879255,"The rapid growth of malware has become a serious problem that threatens the security of the mobile ecosystem and needs to be studied and resolved. Android is the main target of attackers due to its open source and popularity. To solve this serious problem, an accurate and efficient malware detection method is needed. Most existing methods use a single type of feature, which can be easily bypassed, resulting in low detection accuracy. In addition, although multiple types of features are used in some methods to solve the drawbacks of detection methods using a single type of feature, there are still some problems. Firstly, due to multiple types of features, the number of features in the initial feature set is extremely large, and some methods directly use them for training, resulting in excessive overhead. Furthermore, some methods utilize feature selection to reduce the dimensionality of features, but they do not select highly distinguishable features, resulting in poor detection performance. In this article, an effective and accurate method for identifying Android malware, which is based on an analysis of the use of seven types of static features in Android is proposed to cope with the rapid increase in the amount of Android malware and overcome the drawbacks of detection methods using a single type of feature. Instead of utilizing all extracted features, we design three levels of feature selection methods to obtain highly distinguishable features that can be effective in identifying malware. Then a fully densely connected convolutional network based on DenseNet is adopted to leverage features more efficiently and effectively for malware detection. Compared with the number of features in the original feature set, the number of features in the feature set obtained by the three levels of feature selection methods is reduced by about 97%, but the accuracy is only reduced by 0.45%, and the accuracy is more than 99% in a variety of machine learning methods. Moreover, we compare our detection method with different machine learning models, and the experimental results show that our method outperforms general machine learning models. We also compare the performance of our detection method with two state-of-the-art neural networks. The experimental results show that our detection model can greatly reduce the training cost and still achieve good detection performance, reaching an accuracy of 99.72%. In addition, we compare our detection method with other similar detection methods that also use multiple types of features. The results show that our detection method is superior to the comparison methods."
https://openalex.org/W4309922328,"The regulation of muscle glucose utilization has significant potential for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is involved in cellular metabolism and regulation of muscle metabolism. However, it is unclear how HSF1 regulates muscle glucose metabolism. In the present study, the development of obesity in mice was associated with HSF1 downregulation. Serum samples and muscle biopsies were obtained from obese and healthy humans. Fasting glucose and insulin levels and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance value showed that obesity was associated with insulin resistance. The skeletal muscle level of HSF1 was decreased in obese and ob/ob mice. HSF1 was selectively over-expressed in the skeletal muscles of high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Muscle HSF1 over-expression successfully triggered glycolytic-to-oxidative myofiber switch and increased fatty acid metabolism and insulin sensitivity in the skeletal muscles of HFD-fed mice. Moreover, HSF1 improved energy expenditure and blocked muscle accumulation of triglycerides in HFD-fed mice. Consequently, muscle HSF1 mitigated the impaired muscle insulin signaling and insulin resistance in HFD-fed mice. In conclusion, T2DM and obesity in HFD-fed mice may be treated with selective HSF1-directed programming of exercise-like effects in skeletal muscle. These findings may aid the development of a new therapeutic approach for obesity and T2DM."

Available data suggest widely variable rates of HBV and HCV infections in HIV-infected populations across sub-Saharan Africa. With prolonged survival rates due to increased accessibility to antiretroviral drugs, HBV and HCV have the potential to complicate the prognosis of HIV co-infected patients by contributing significantly to continued morbidity and mortality. The study sought to determine the seroprevalence of HIV/HBV and HIV/HCV co-infections among HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy and to evaluate the effect of HIV/HBV and HIV/HCV co-infections on the immunologic and virologic responses of patients. A cross-sectional study in which samples were taken from 500 people living with HIV and attending ART clinic at the Fevers unit of the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital and tested for Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) and Hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV). CD4 cell counts and HIV-1 RNA levels were estimated as well. Data generated were analysed using IBM SPSS version 22. The seroprevalence of HIV/HBV and HIV/HCV co-infections among people living with HIV was 8.4% and 0.2% respectively. HIV/HBV coinfection included 15/42 (35.7%) males and 27/42 (64.3%) females out of which the majority (97.6%) were in the 21–60 years old bracket. HIV/HBV and HIV/HCV co-infections have varied effects on the immunological and virological response of HIV patients on ART. The mean CD cell count was 361.0 ± 284.0 in HIV/HBV co-infected patients and 473.8 ± 326.7 in HIV mono-infected patients. The mean HIV-1 RNA level was not significantly different (X 2 [df] = .057 [1]; P = .811) among HIV/HBV co-infected patients (Log 10 2.9±2.0 copies/mL), compared to that of HIV mono-infected patients (Log 10 2.8±2.1 copies/mL) although HIV mono-infected patients had lower viral load levels. One-third (14/42) of HIV/HBV co-infected patients had virologic failure and the only HIV/HCV co-infected patient showed viral suppression. 336/500 (67.2%) patients had HIV-1 viral suppression (females [66.1%]; males [33.9%]) while 164/500 (32.8%) had virologic failure (females [67.7%]; males [32.3%]). The mean CD4 count of patients with viral suppression and patients with virologic failure was 541.2 cells/μL (95% CI 508.5–573.8) and 309.9 cell/μL (95% CI 261.9–357.9) respectively.The study concludes that, HIV/HBV and HIV/HCV coinfections do not significantly affect the immunologic and virologic responses of patients who have initiated highly active antiretroviral therapy, and treatment outcomes were better in females than in males. There was no HBV/HCV co-infection among patients."
https://openalex.org/W4309927984,"Background Life expectancy (LE) is increasing all over the world, and relying on LE alone is no longer sufficient to identify whether a country is having a healthier population. Examining the increase in LE in relation to health ― health expectancy estimation ― is advised to ascertain the increase (or decrease) in LE without disability over time. This study examines the trends in health expectancy at age 60 in Bangladesh from 1996 to 2016. Methods Mortality information from United Nations and World Health Organization and morbidity information from Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics were combined using the Sullivan method. Results With an overall declining trend over the study period and a big drop in disability rates during 2012–2013, the disability rates were observed 1.6–1.7% in 2016. The declining trend in disability may have two-fold implications: (1) among the 98.3% older adults (≥60 years) with no severe/extreme disability, those were in jobs could have continued their work if there was no mandatory retirement at age 59, and (2) the 1.7% (translates into 0.2 million in 2020) older adults with severe/extreme disability require care assistance with their daily activities. The observed gain in disability-free life expectancy, the decrease in life expectancy with disability and its proportion allude to the compression of morbidity and healthier older adults over time. Conclusion In 2020, Bangladesh had 13.2 million (i.e., 8% of the total population) older adults, which is increasing day by day. The policy makers and government are suggested to prioritize the issues of older adults, particularly disability, care needs, retirement age, and health in the light of the current study’s findings. Utilizing health expectancy research is suggested to understand the combined effect of disability and mortality for considering policy changes."
https://openalex.org/W4309928169,"Sensitive and specific genotyping of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) is critical for the surveillance and monitoring of the vaccine effectiveness. Here, HPV genotypes were identified in 137 cervical samples with different histology (79 ≤CIN1 and 58 CIN3+) using Nested-PCR followed by Next-Generation sequencing (NGS) and relative proportions for each genotype in multiple infections were computed. All samples had been previously genotyped by PCR-Reverse Blotting Hybridization (PCR-RBH) thus allowing for a concordance analysis between both techniques. Multiple infections were present in 85% of ≤CIN1 cases compared to only 41% in CIN3+ cases (p&lt;0.001). Among ≤CIN1 cases a towering genotypic diversity was observed, considering both low (LR-) and high risk (HR-) HPV genotypes; while among CIN3+, diversity was lower, HR-HPVs prevailing in most cases, especially HPV16. Furthermore, the predominance of HR-HPV genotypes in the proportions identified in each sample was higher in CIN3+ cases [(HPV16 (62.5%), followed by HPV31 and HPV58 (8.3% each)], than in ≤CIN1 cases [(HPV16 (17.7%), followed by HPV52 (14.7%) and HPV31 (10.3%)]. Agreement between PCR-RBH and NGS was higher than 90% for all genotypes (with an overall Kappa of 0.7), even though NGS identified eighty-nine positive results for HPV genotypes that had not been detected by PCR-RBH, evidencing its greater sensitivity. These results suggest that a reduction in genotypic diversity and/or an increase in the relative proportion of HR-HPVs in multiple infections can be considered as a biomarker for the potential risk of malignant progression."
