https://openalex.org/W3008359597,"Various species of the intestinal microbiota have been associated with the development of colorectal cancer1,2, but it has not been demonstrated that bacteria have a direct role in the occurrence of oncogenic mutations. Escherichia coli can carry the pathogenicity island pks, which encodes a set of enzymes that synthesize colibactin3. This compound is believed to alkylate DNA on adenine residues4,5 and induces double-strand breaks in cultured cells3. Here we expose human intestinal organoids to genotoxic pks+ E. coli by repeated luminal injection over five months. Whole-genome sequencing of clonal organoids before and after this exposure revealed a distinct mutational signature that was absent from organoids injected with isogenic pks-mutant bacteria. The same mutational signature was detected in a subset of 5,876 human cancer genomes from two independent cohorts, predominantly in colorectal cancer. Our study describes a distinct mutational signature in colorectal cancer and implies that the underlying mutational process results directly from past exposure to bacteria carrying the colibactin-producing pks pathogenicity island. Organoids derived from human intestinal cells that are co-cultured with bacteria carrying the genotoxic pks+ island develop a distinct mutational signature associated with colorectal cancer."

https://openalex.org/W3007415664,"A mosaic of cross-phylum chemical interactions occurs between all metazoans and their microbiomes. A number of molecular families that are known to be produced by the microbiome have a marked effect on the balance between health and disease1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Considering the diversity of the human microbiome (which numbers over 40,000 operational taxonomic units10), the effect of the microbiome on the chemistry of an entire animal remains underexplored. Here we use mass spectrometry informatics and data visualization approaches11,12,13 to provide an assessment of the effects of the microbiome on the chemistry of an entire mammal by comparing metabolomics data from germ-free and specific-pathogen-free mice. We found that the microbiota affects the chemistry of all organs. This included the amino acid conjugations of host bile acids that were used to produce phenylalanocholic acid, tyrosocholic acid and leucocholic acid, which have not previously been characterized despite extensive research on bile-acid chemistry14. These bile-acid conjugates were also found in humans, and were enriched in patients with inflammatory bowel disease or cystic fibrosis. These compounds agonized the farnesoid X receptor in vitro, and mice gavaged with the compounds showed reduced expression of bile-acid synthesis genes in vivo. Further studies are required to confirm whether these compounds have a physiological role in the host, and whether they contribute to gut diseases that are associated with microbiome dysbiosis."
https://openalex.org/W3006996572,"Cancer recurrence after surgery remains an unresolved clinical problem1–3. Myeloid cells derived from bone marrow contribute to the formation of the premetastatic microenvironment, which is required for disseminating tumour cells to engraft distant sites4–6. There are currently no effective interventions that prevent the formation of the premetastatic microenvironment6,7. Here we show that, after surgical removal of primary lung, breast and oesophageal cancers, low-dose adjuvant epigenetic therapy disrupts the premetastatic microenvironment and inhibits both the formation and growth of lung metastases through its selective effect on myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). In mouse models of pulmonary metastases, MDSCs are key factors in the formation of the premetastatic microenvironment after resection of primary tumours. Adjuvant epigenetic therapy that uses low-dose DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibitors, 5-azacytidine and entinostat, disrupts the premetastatic niche by inhibiting the trafficking of MDSCs through the downregulation of CCR2 and CXCR2, and by promoting MDSC differentiation into a more-interstitial macrophage-like phenotype. A decreased accumulation of MDSCs in the premetastatic lung produces longer periods of disease-free survival and increased overall survival, compared with chemotherapy. Our data demonstrate that, even after removal of the primary tumour, MDSCs contribute to the development of premetastatic niches and settlement of residual tumour cells. A combination of low-dose adjuvant epigenetic modifiers that disrupts this premetastatic microenvironment and inhibits metastases may permit an adjuvant approach to cancer therapy. In mouse models of pulmonary metastasis, adjuvant epigenetic therapy targeting myeloid-derived suppressor cells disrupts the premetastatic microenvironment after resection of primary tumours and inhibits the dissemination of residual tumour cells."
https://openalex.org/W3008581599,"Strain-hardening (the increase of flow stress with plastic strain) is the most important phenomenon in the mechanical behaviour of engineering alloys because it ensures that flow is delocalized, enhances tensile ductility and inhibits catastrophic mechanical failure1,2. Metallic glasses (MGs) lack the crystallinity of conventional engineering alloys, and some of their properties-such as higher yield stress and elastic strain limit3-are greatly improved relative to their crystalline counterparts. MGs can have high fracture toughness and have the highest known 'damage tolerance' (defined as the product of yield stress and fracture toughness)4 among all structural materials. However, the use of MGs in structural applications is largely limited by the fact that they show strain-softening instead of strain-hardening; this leads to extreme localization of plastic flow in shear bands, and is associated with early catastrophic failure in tension. Although rejuvenation of an MG (raising its energy to values that are typical of glass formation at a higher cooling rate) lowers its yield stress, which might enable strain-hardening5, it is unclear whether sufficient rejuvenation can be achieved in bulk samples while retaining their glassy structure. Here we show that plastic deformation under triaxial compression at room temperature can rejuvenate bulk MG samples sufficiently to enable strain-hardening through a mechanism that has not been previously observed in the metallic state. This transformed behaviour suppresses shear-banding in bulk samples in normal uniaxial (tensile or compressive) tests, prevents catastrophic failure and leads to higher ultimate flow stress. The rejuvenated MGs are stable at room temperature and show exceptionally efficient strain-hardening, greatly increasing their potential use in structural applications."
https://openalex.org/W3009028593,"Adipose tissue is an energy store and a dynamic endocrine organ1,2. In particular, visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is critical for the regulation of systemic metabolism3,4. Impaired VAT function—for example, in obesity—is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes5,6. Regulatory T (Treg) cells that express the transcription factor FOXP3 are critical for limiting immune responses and suppressing tissue inflammation, including in the VAT7–9. Here we uncover pronounced sexual dimorphism in Treg cells in the VAT. Male VAT was enriched for Treg cells compared with female VAT, and Treg cells from male VAT were markedly different from their female counterparts in phenotype, transcriptional landscape and chromatin accessibility. Heightened inflammation in the male VAT facilitated the recruitment of Treg cells via the CCL2–CCR2 axis. Androgen regulated the differentiation of a unique IL-33-producing stromal cell population specific to the male VAT, which paralleled the local expansion of Treg cells. Sex hormones also regulated VAT inflammation, which shaped the transcriptional landscape of VAT-resident Treg cells in a BLIMP1 transcription factor-dependent manner. Overall, we find that sex-specific differences in Treg cells from VAT are determined by the tissue niche in a sex-hormone-dependent manner to limit adipose tissue inflammation. Visceral adipose tissue contains populations of regulatory T cells that exhibit sexual dimorphism, determined by the surrounding niche, and differ between male and female mice in terms of cell number, phenotype, transcriptional landscape and chromatin accessibility."
https://openalex.org/W3008149695,"The avascular nature of cartilage makes it a unique tissue1–4, but whether and how the absence of nutrient supply regulates chondrogenesis remain unknown. Here we show that obstruction of vascular invasion during bone healing favours chondrogenic over osteogenic differentiation of skeletal progenitor cells. Unexpectedly, this process is driven by a decreased availability of extracellular lipids. When lipids are scarce, skeletal progenitors activate forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors, which bind to the Sox9 promoter and increase its expression. Besides initiating chondrogenesis, SOX9 acts as a regulator of cellular metabolism by suppressing oxidation of fatty acids, and thus adapts the cells to an avascular life. Our results define lipid scarcity as an important determinant of chondrogenic commitment, reveal a role for FOXO transcription factors during lipid starvation, and identify SOX9 as a critical metabolic mediator. These data highlight the importance of the nutritional microenvironment in the specification of skeletal cell fate. Lipid starvation results in skeletal progenitors favouring commitment to chondrogenic over osteogenic fate, a process mediated by FOXO transcription factors and SOX9."
https://openalex.org/W3007803772,"Simulation-based training is increasingly being used for assessment and training of psychomotor skills involved in medicine. The application of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies has provided new methodologies to utilize large amounts of data for educational purposes. A significant criticism of the use of artificial intelligence in education has been a lack of transparency in the algorithms' decision-making processes. This study aims to 1) introduce a new framework using explainable artificial intelligence for simulation-based training in surgery, and 2) validate the framework by creating the Virtual Operative Assistant, an automated educational feedback platform. Twenty-eight skilled participants (14 staff neurosurgeons, 4 fellows, 10 PGY 4-6 residents) and 22 novice participants (10 PGY 1-3 residents, 12 medical students) took part in this study. Participants performed a virtual reality subpial brain tumor resection task on the NeuroVR simulator using a simulated ultrasonic aspirator and bipolar. Metrics of performance were developed, and leave-one-out cross validation was employed to train and validate a support vector machine in Matlab. The classifier was combined with a unique educational system to build the Virtual Operative Assistant which provides users with automated feedback on their metric performance with regards to expert proficiency performance benchmarks. The Virtual Operative Assistant successfully classified skilled and novice participants using 4 metrics with an accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of 92, 82 and 100%, respectively. A 2-step feedback system was developed to provide participants with an immediate visual representation of their standing related to expert proficiency performance benchmarks. The educational system outlined establishes a basis for the potential role of integrating artificial intelligence and virtual reality simulation into surgical educational teaching. The potential of linking expertise classification, objective feedback based on proficiency benchmarks, and instructor input creates a novel educational tool by integrating these three components into a formative educational paradigm."
https://openalex.org/W3008543536,"Mating and egg laying are tightly cooordinated events in the reproductive life of all oviparous females. Oviposition is typically rare in virgin females but is initiated after copulation. Here we identify the neural circuitry that links egg laying to mating status in Drosophila melanogaster. Activation of female-specific oviposition descending neurons (oviDNs) is necessary and sufficient for egg laying, and is equally potent in virgin and mated females. After mating, sex peptide—a protein from the male seminal fluid—triggers many behavioural and physiological changes in the female, including the onset of egg laying1. Sex peptide is detected by sensory neurons in the uterus2–4, and silences these neurons and their postsynaptic ascending neurons in the abdominal ganglion5. We show that these abdominal ganglion neurons directly activate the female-specific pC1 neurons. GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric-acid-releasing) oviposition inhibitory neurons (oviINs) mediate feed-forward inhibition from pC1 neurons to both oviDNs and their major excitatory input, the oviposition excitatory neurons (oviENs). By attenuating the abdominal ganglion inputs to pC1 neurons and oviINs, sex peptide disinhibits oviDNs to enable egg laying after mating. This circuitry thus coordinates the two key events in female reproduction: mating and egg laying. Neuron-tracing and labelling experiments in Drosophila females reveal the neural circuitry that coordinates mating and egg laying, and the role of sex peptide from male seminal fluid in triggering these neurons."
https://openalex.org/W3099062499,"Foot stiffness underlies its mechanical function, and is central to the evolution of human bipedal locomotion. The stiff and propulsive human foot has two distinct arches, the longitudinal and transverse. By contrast, the feet of non-human primates are flat and softer. Current understanding of foot stiffness is based on studies that focus solely on the longitudinal arch, and little is known about the mechanical function of the transverse arch. However, common experience suggests that transverse curvature dominates the stiffness; a drooping dollar bill stiffens significantly upon curling it along the transverse direction, not the longitudinal. We derive a normalized curvature parameter that encapsulates the geometric principle underlying the transverse curvature-induced stiffness. We show that the transverse arch accounts for almost all the difference in stiffness between human and monkey feet (vervet monkeys and pig-tailed macaques) by comparing transverse curvature-based predictions against published data on foot stiffness. Using this functional interpretation of the transverse arch, we trace the evolution of hominin feet and show that a human-like stiff foot likely predates Homo by $\sim 1.5$ million years, and appears in the $\sim 3.4$ million year old fossil from Burtele. A distinctly human-like transverse arch is also present in early members of Homo, including Homo naledi, Homo habilis, and Homo erectus. However, the $\sim 3.2$ million year old Australopithecus afarensis is estimated to have possessed a transitional foot, softer than humans and stiffer than other extant primates. A foot with human-like stiffness probably evolved around the same time as other lower limb adaptations for regular bipedality, and well before the emergence of Homo, the longitudinal arch, and other adaptations for endurance running."
https://openalex.org/W3007793600,"Most magmatism occurring on Earth is conventionally attributed to passive mantle upwelling at mid-ocean ridges, to slab devolatilization at subduction zones, or to mantle plumes. However, the widespread Cenozoic intraplate volcanism in northeast China1–3 and the young petit-spot volcanoes4–7 offshore of the Japan Trench cannot readily be associated with any of these mechanisms. In addition, the mantle beneath these types of volcanism is characterized by zones of anomalously low seismic velocity above and below the transition zone8–12 (a mantle level located at depths between 410 and 660 kilometres). A comprehensive interpretation of these phenomena is lacking. Here we show that most (or possibly all) of the intraplate and petit-spot volcanism and low-velocity zones around the Japanese subduction zone can be explained by the Cenozoic interaction of the subducting Pacific slab with a hydrous mantle transition zone. Numerical modelling indicates that 0.2 to 0.3 weight per cent of water dissolved in mantle minerals that are driven out from the transition zone in response to subduction and retreat of a tectonic plate is sufficient to reproduce the observations. This suggests that a critical amount of water may have accumulated in the transition zone around this subduction zone, as well as in others of the Tethyan tectonic belt13 that are characterized by intraplate or petit-spot volcanism and low-velocity zones in the underlying mantle. The widespread intraplate volcanism in northeast China and the unusual ‘petit-spot’ volcanoes offshore Japan could have resulted from the interaction of the subducting Pacific slab with a hydrous mantle transition zone."
https://openalex.org/W3043342085,"The observation of chirality is ubiquitous in nature. Contrary to intuition, the population of opposite chiralities is surprisingly asymmetric at fundamental levels. Examples range from parity violation in the subatomic weak force to the homochirality in essential biomolecules. The ability to achieve chirality-selective synthesis (chiral induction) is of great importance in stereochemistry, molecular biology and pharmacology. In condensed matter physics, a crystalline electronic system is geometrically chiral when it lacks any mirror plane, space inversion center or roto-inversion axis. Typically, the geometrical chirality is predefined by a material's chiral lattice structure, which is fixed upon the formation of the crystal. By contrast, a particularly unconventional scenario is the gyrotropic order, where chirality spontaneously emerges across a phase transition as the electron system breaks the relevant symmetries of an originally achiral lattice. Such a gyrotropic order, proposed as the quantum analogue of the cholesteric liquid crystals, has attracted significant interest. However, to date, a clear observation and manipulation of the gyrotropic order remain challenging. We report the realization of optical chiral induction and the observation of a gyrotropically ordered phase in the transition-metal dichalcogenide semimetal $1T$-TiSe$_2$. We show that shining mid-infrared circularly polarized light near the critical temperature leads to the preferential formation of one chiral domain. As a result, we are able to observe an out-of-plane circular photogalvanic current, whose direction depends on the optical induction. Our study provides compelling evidence for the spontaneous emergence of chirality in the correlated semimetal TiSe$_2$. Such chiral induction provides a new way of optical control over novel orders in quantum materials."

We studied this problem using an olfactory delayed match to sample task whereby a sample odor specifies the association between a subsequent test odor and rewarding action. Multi-neuron recordings revealed representations of the sample and test odors in olfactory sensory and association cortex, which were sufficient to identify the test odor as match or non-match. Yet, inactivation of a downstream premotor area (ALM), but not orbitofrontal cortex, confined to the epoch preceding the test odor led to gross impairment. Olfactory decisions that were not context-dependent were unimpaired. Therefore, ALM does not receive the outcome of a match/non-match decision from upstream areas. It receives contextual information—the identity of the sample—to establish the mapping between test odor and action. A novel population of pyramidal neurons in ALM layer 2 may mediate this process.

Brain functions deemed cognitive exhibit complexities that extend an organism’s behavioral repertoire beyond simple sensory-response associations, motor programs, and instructed actions. Cognitive functions exploit contingent, hierarchical processes of decision-making and executive control. For example, instead of choosing an action, a decision might lead an organism to choose a strategy, switch tasks, or make yet another decision. Cognitive functions may also transpire over flexible timescales without precipitating an immediate behavior, as when a decision is based on information acquired at some moment and combined with information acquired later. Neural mechanisms of decision-making and executive control have been studied primarily in the parietal and prefrontal cortex of nonhuman primates. These studies focused mainly on neurons that exhibit responses over long timescales and implicated processes such as working memory (Funahashi et al., 1989Funahashi S. Bruce C.J. Goldman-Rakic P.S.

The study of the neural mechanisms of perceptual decision-making may therefore provide an initial logic for higher-order cognition. This will require an understanding of neural circuits at a level that is not yet possible to achieve in nonhuman primates. Thus, there has been growing interest in the pursuit of elementary cognitive functions in the mouse, for which genetic and viral tools for circuit manipulation abound (Carandini and Churchland, 2013Carandini M. Churchland A.K. Probing perceptual decisions in rodents.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 824-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, Luo et al., 2018Luo L. Callaway E.M. Svoboda K. Genetic Dissection of Neural Circuits: A Decade of Progress.Neuron. 2018; 98: 256-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The challenge is to find simple behaviors within the mouse repertoire that have the potential to elucidate more complex cognitive functions. We developed a simple task that allows us to study rudiments of executive control and decision-making in a mouse. The task is a variant of the logical exclusive or (XOR) problem, realized as an olfactory delayed match to sample task (DMS; Figure 1) (Liu et al., 2014Liu D. Gu X. Zhu J. Zhang X. Han Z. Yan W. Cheng Q. Hao J. Fan H. Hou R. et al.Medial prefrontal activity during delay period contributes to learning of a working memory task.Science. 2014; 346: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The mouse is exposed to a sample odor, either SA or SB, and, after a short delay, receives a test odor, TA or TB. To receive a reward, the mouse must lick to the left if the sample and test odors are the same and to the right if they are different. The XOR problem interests computational neuroscientists because it cannot be solved by a simple linear classifier. Our interest was in the possibility that it could be solved by a hierarchy of decisions. For example, the mouse might use the sample odor to decide on the appropriate association between the test odor and the correct behavioral response—a left or right lick. We hypothesized that this hierarchical control might be solved by changing the configuration of cortical circuitry in the premotor cortex, in the area anterolateral motor cortex (ALM). Studies from Svoboda and colleagues have shown that ALM plays an essential role in behaviors in which a sensory cue serves as an instruction to lick to the left or right (Guo et al., 2014aGuo Z.V. Li N. Huber D. Ophir E. Gutnisky D. Ting J.T. Feng G. Svoboda K. Flow of cortical activity underlying a tactile decision in mice.Neuron. 2014; 81: 179-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, Li et al., 2015Li N. Chen T.-W. Guo Z.V.

Neural mechanisms of movement planning: motor cortex and beyond.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2018; 49: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). They showed that many neurons in ALM can hold such an instruction—or the plan to lick to the left or right—in persistent activity through a delay period. In the DMS task we study, the sample odor cannot provide an instruction to lick left or right, only a context to interpret the test odor. Thus, the mouse cannot plan a lick until the arrival of the test odor after the delay. We investigated three hypotheses for the involvement of ALM in this task. First, areas upstream to ALM could solve the match/non-match discrimination and project this solution to ALM, which organizes an appropriate lick response. Second, ALM could decode upstream representations that combine sample and test odors to select the appropriate response. Third, ALM could receive information about the identity of the sample odor to instantiate the appropriate response to the test odor. We provide experimental evidence for this third possibility. We show that the sample odor is represented in ALM itself, and that this representation allows ALM to associate the test odor with the appropriate lick response. Mice were trained to compare a sample and test odor, separated by a delay, and to report their decisions of match or non-match by licking to the left or to the right, respectively (Figures 1A, S1A, and S1B). The lick-left, lick-right design requires distinct actions to report both match and non-match. Importantly, animals cannot solve the task until they smell the test odor. For most experiments, we used the same two odors, (+)-α-pinene and cis-3-hexen-1-ol (odors A and B, respectively) on all trials. Animals were trained to suppress their premature licks before test onset (Figure 1B) and do not appear to use licks to represent and remember the sample odors (Figures S1C–S1E). Mice performed the task with a median accuracy of 90% (Figure 1C). When challenged with a novel pair of odorants after training with pinene and hexenol, mice performed at chance level with a high no-choice rate (Figure S1F). This suggests that the mice failed to generalize the match/non-match rule. Rather, they learned that test odor TA instructs lick left if preceded by sample odor SA (AA trial), whereas it instructs lick right if preceded by sample odor SB (BA trial). The complementary logic holds for the test odor TB (Figure 1D). This flexible association between test odor and licking response is contingent on the sample odor identity, which must be represented through the delay in order to affect the match/non-match decision. We first characterize the neural representation of the sample and test odors by surveying neural responses in the Piriform cortex (Pir), the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and the ALM while the mouse performed the DMS task. We wished to determine whether each of these areas contain a persistent representation of the sample odor and whether they encode the test odor in a way that might inform the match/non-match decision. As detailed in the next section, the findings support the possibility that the match/non-match decision can be established within Pir and OFC and then transmitted to the ALM to render the lick response. We then test this model by inactivating ALM during the sample and delay epochs of the task. We find evidence against this model and instead establish a necessary role of ALM during the sample and delay epochs. Finally, using 2-photon Ca imaging, we expose a class of neurons in superficial ALM that could mediate the circuit changes required to allow ALM to associate the test odor with an appropriate lick response. We performed electrophysiological recordings in brain areas likely to be involved in the DMS task: Pir, OFC, and ALM. Pir is a primary olfactory sensory area (Giessel and Datta, 2014Giessel A.J.

Pir projects to OFC, a higher-order associative area that is thought to encode value, expectation, and working memory (Bechara et al., 2000Bechara A. Damasio H. Damasio A.R.

Figures 2A–2C provide examples of neurons that respond selectively to (1) one or the other sample odor during the sample and delay periods (1st and 2nd columns); (2) one or the other test odor (3rd column); and (3) one or the other choice (4th column). They also show the strength of the selectivity across all the neurons recorded. The selectivity index quantifies the degree to which the distributions of firing rates to the two conditions (e.g., odor A or B) are non-overlapping (see STAR Methods). In what follows we refer to a neuron as selective if the difference in the mean responses is statistically reliable (indicated by shading in Figures 2D–2G). More than a third of neurons (37%) in Pir responded selectively to either odor A or odor B during the sample epoch (Figures 2A and 2D). Of these, 71% exhibited the same odor preference during the sample and test epochs (Figure S2A), suggesting that these neurons represent sensory information and encode odor identity. Most of the sample-selective neurons responded transiently (e.g., Figure 2A, left most panel), but 28% exhibited persistent selectivity through the delay (e.g., Figure 2A, 2nd panel from left; Figure S2B). These neurons can therefore inform downstream neurons of the identity of the sample odor at the time of test. A subset of Pir neurons responded to the test odor in a way that depended on the identity of the sample odor (Figure S2C; STAR Methods). These neurons are characterized as trial-type-selective (6.2% of all Pir neurons). Finally, 4.5% of Pir neurons exhibited selective responses during the test epoch that reflect either a match or non-match between sample and test odors (Figures 2A and 2G). The information represented by these last two classes of neurons, trial type and match/non-match, would appear to be sufficient to guide motor output in downstream brain areas. In OFC, 24.5% of the neurons were odor-selective during the sample epoch (Figures 2B and 2D) and 60% of these exhibited the same odor preference at test (Figure S2D), suggesting that they encode odor identity. Compared to Pir, fewer of the sample-selective neurons in OFC exhibited persistent spiking through the delay epoch (Figure S2E; 13% in OFC versus 28% in Pir). Only 3.7% of the neurons were selective to trial type (Figure S2F), but a greater fraction (11%) responded selectively to match/non-match trials (Figure 2G). Therefore, the OFC also appears to have integrated sensory inputs in a way that could guide appropriate motor output. Unlike Pir and OFC, which largely represent odor identity, the dominant task-related activity in ALM was correlated with the lick response—the outcome of the match/non-match decision; 28% of ALM neurons distinguished match from non-match trials during the test epoch (Figures 2C and 2G). Analyses of error trials and premature licks show that the neural activity reflects lick direction rather than the identities of the sample and test odors or the true match/non-match condition, consistent with the role of ALM in motor planning (Figures S2J and S2K) (Guo et al., 2014aGuo Z.V.

A largely non-overlapping population in ALM (12%) exhibited weak odor selectivity during the sample epoch, and among these, 12% (less than 1.5% overall) maintained this selectivity through the end of the delay epoch (Figures 2D and S2H). Very few neurons exhibited a selective response to the test odor, and only 1.4% of ALM neurons were trial-type-selective (Figure S2I). Together, these recordings are consistent with the known role for ALM in the preparation of an appropriate motor response (Svoboda and Li, 2018Svoboda K. Li N. Neural mechanisms of movement planning: motor cortex and beyond.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2018; 49: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) following the match/non-match decision. This survey of a sensory, association, and premotor cortex reveals neurons in each area that exhibit one or more of the properties required to solve the DMS task: (1) a representation of the sample odor during the delay epoch, (2) a response to the test odor that is possibly modulated by the identity of the sample odor, and (3) the conversion of these sensory signals to choice-related activity (Figure 2H). Figure 3A shows the averaged difference in firing rate to each neuron’s preferred versus nonpreferred odor during the trial. The assignment of preferred odor was derived from five randomly selected trials to each odor, which are excluded from the averages. The procedure ensured an unbiased estimate of the difference (see STAR Methods). The average difference is strongest in Pir and weakest in ALM. In the left panel, the magnitude of the difference reflects a combination of greater selectivity and the fraction of neurons that are selective, as nonselective neurons drive the average toward zero. In the right panel, the averages comprise only the selective cases from each area (filled histograms in Figure 2). All three areas contain signals that could convey the representation of the sample odor (Pir > OFC > ALM). However, this conclusion is based on averaged activity across trials. To determine whether such task relevant information is available on single trials, we trained linear classifiers to decode these variables from simultaneously recorded neurons (from 14 to 120 simultaneously recorded neurons; see STAR Methods). As shown in Figure 3B, all three areas contain signals that support classification of the sample odor above chance levels throughout the sample and delay epochs. The performance of the classifier is lower for ALM recordings compared to Pir recordings, for which the sample odor identity can be decoded throughout the delay period and into the test epoch. This extended sample-selective response could potentially be used to perform a comparison between sample and test odors. Consistent with this, classification of all four trial types is possible using the Pir recordings (Figure 3C). In this same epoch (test odor onset to the first lick response), it is possible to decode the binary choice from all three areas, with ALM exhibiting the highest performance (Figure 3D). The neural recordings and decoding analyses would appear to support a traditional hierarchical view of the mechanism responsible for resolving the match/non-match decision. That is, the expression of the decision by the left- and right-lick neurons in ALM could arise by reading out activity in OFC or Pir, perhaps via another intermediate area between Pir and ALM. On this view, ALM is only essential once the test odor arrives, when it must either convert the match/non-match decision to a lick response or perform a computation, similar to our decoder, that converts the population response from upstream areas to a lick response. Both mechanisms lead to the prediction that inactivation of ALM during the sample and delay epochs should not impair performance on the task. As we next show, this seemingly obvious prediction is incorrect. We inactivated ALM bilaterally on a fraction of the trials by photostimulation of GABAergic interneurons expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) (Figures 4A and S3; STAR Methods) (Guo et al., 2014aGuo Z.V.

Flow of cortical activity underlying a tactile decision in mice.Neuron. 2014; 81: 179-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, Zhao et al., 2011Zhao S. Ting J.T.

Cell type–specific channelrhodopsin-2 transgenic mice for optogenetic dissection of neural circuitry function.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Inactivation was confined to the sample and delay epochs and was tapered gradually at the end of the delay (see STAR Methods) such that by the onset of the test odor, ALM should have been capable of receiving information from upstream sensory and association areas. We reasoned that if ALM reads out the match/non-match decision computed in upstream areas, then inactivation of ALM before the arrival of the test odor should not impair performance. Contrary to this prediction, bilateral inactivation of ALM markedly impaired performance on the DMS task (Figure 4B). The proportion of correct trials decreased from 0.86 on the control trials to 0.68 (0.5 reflects chance performance). In contrast, bilateral inactivation of OFC induced no impairment on the same task (proportion correct: 0.82 and 0.84 with and without inactivation; Figure 4C). Photostimulation of ALM in animals that did not express ChR2 did not diminish performance (Figure 4D). Inactivation of ALM caused less impairment when it was restricted to only a portion of the sample plus delay epochs (Figure 4E). Inactivation during the late delay reduced the proportion of correct trials from 0.86 to 0.79, whereas inactivation during the sample and early delay reduced the proportion to 0.83. These more modest effects suggest that the impairment can be ameliorated when there is a time window in which ALM can receive task related information. The behavioral impairment induced by ALM inactivation is a consequence of altered activity within ALM itself during the sample and delay. Photoinactivation of ALM did not affect odor or match/non-match selectivity in upstream areas, Pir and OFC. During inactivation, the population odor selectivity in Pir or OFC did not change appreciably (Figures 4I, 4J, 4L, and 4M), and our ability to decode match versus non-match from activity was similarly unchanged (Figures 4O and 4P). Neural recordings from ALM during silencing demonstrated that optogenetic suppression eliminated the representation of the sample odor, but neural activity returned after the laser was ramped down (Figures 4K, 4N, 4Q, and 4R). Despite their diminished performance, animals invariably licked to one of the two ports in inactivation trials, and there was no consistent change in the reaction time (Figures S4A and S4B). From these observations, we conclude that the impairment was not explained by a loss of processing capacity in Pir or OFC or from physiological sequelae of photoinactivation of ALM that might affect its function during the test epoch. This last conclusion deserves further scrutiny. A possible concern is that the inactivation of ALM during sample and delay epochs disrupts the ALM circuitry such that it is unable to process information about the test odor or receive information about the decision from an upstream area. We evaluated this possibility with two control experiments that required the mice to lick to the left or right based on the identity of a test odor but did not require a comparison of the test odor to the sample odor. In the first control, an uninformative sample odor A was presented on all trials, but the mouse was rewarded for licking left or right for test odor A or B, respectively (AA and AB trials; Figure 4A). Inactivation during the sample and delay epochs produced minimal impairment (0.91 to 0.88 correct; Figure 4F). In the second control, we incorporated two additional trial types into the AB × AB design using two new odors (C and D). In these CC and CD trials, as in the previous control, the correct lick behavior was determined only by the test odor. The six trial types were randomly interleaved (Figure 4A). Inactivation of ALM during the sample and delay epochs led to minimal impairment in CC and CD trials (0.94 to 0.91 correct), whereas significant impairment was replicated in the interleaved DMS trials (0.82 to 0.68 correct; Figure 4G). The degree of impairment on each type of experiment is captured by a simple statistic: the log probability ratio of correct choices with and without inactivation (Equation 4). We used Monte Carlo methods to estimate the magnitude and uncertainty of this statistic for each of the experimental and control experiments. As is clear from Figure 4H, inactivation impaired performance selectively when it was targeted to ALM and when the sample odor was informative (Figure 4H, sample informative tasks versus sample uninformative tasks, p < 0.0001; STAR Methods). Further, the laser introduced no side bias in the CC/CD control (β2 = −0.46, SEM = 0.40, p = 0.25, Equation 8; see STAR Methods), demonstrating that the bias observed in some of the DMS trials is not due to unbalanced inactivation of the two hemispheres (see also Figure S4C). These control experiments demonstrate that after recovery from inactivation, ALM is capable of processing information that instructs a licking response via a simple association between two odors and two actions. The impairment on the DMS task must therefore arise by interfering with the process that allows the sample odor to establish, on each trial, the appropriate association between test odor and lick response. Moreover, it implies that this process occurs in ALM. Based on the neural recordings, the necessity of ALM during the sample and delay seems highly perplexing. At the end of the delay period, less than 1.5% of neurons in ALM had activity that was informative about the identity of the sample. We considered that we might have missed neurons, especially from superficial cortical layers (Figure S2L; see also Figure 3D in Guo et al., 2017Guo Z.V. Inagaki H.K. Daie K. Druckmann S. Gerfen C.R. Svoboda K. Maintenance of persistent activity in a frontal thalamocortical loop.Nature. 2017; 545: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We therefore examined neural responses in ALM with 2-photon calcium imaging while mice performed the DMS task. Imaging was performed in mice expressing the calcium indicator GCaMP6f in pyramidal cells (Chen et al., 2013Chen T.W. Wardill T.J. Sun Y. Pulver S.R. Renninger S.L. Baohan A. Schreiter E.R. Kerr R.A.

Consistent with our electrical recordings, calcium imaging revealed that ∼37% of the neurons were choice-selective across all cortical depths examined (Figures S5A and S5B). However, we also observed a large subset of neurons with striking odor selectivity during the sample and delay epochs (Figures 5A, S5C, and S5D). Interestingly, the odor-selective calcium activity was heterogeneous in its timing, showing a variety of latencies and timescales (Figures 5B–5E). Some of the signals spanned the sample and part of the delay period, peaking at consistent times across trials (long duration, low scatter; e.g., Figure 5C). Other neurons exhibited more transient responses that occurred at different times across trials (short duration, high scatter; e.g., Figure 5D). Although they are ordered on the graph for visualization, these brief, scattered activations appeared random. For example, their timing is uncorrelated in simultaneously recorded neurons (Figures S6A and S6B). These characterizations also hold for the estimated spike rates, achieved through deconvolution of the raw Ca signals (Figures S6C–S6F), despite a revision of the estimates of signal duration. From the imaging data, we educe that a subpopulation of ALM neurons represents the identity of the sample odor through the sample and delay peri"
https://openalex.org/W3104226014,"The strong nuclear interaction between nucleons (protons and neutrons) is the effective force that holds the atomic nucleus together. This force stems from fundamental interactions between quarks and gluons (the constituents of nucleons) that are described by the equations of quantum chromodynamics. However, as these equations cannot be solved directly, nuclear interactions are described using simplified models, which are well constrained at typical inter-nucleon distances1-5 but not at shorter distances. This limits our ability to describe high-density nuclear matter such as that in the cores of neutron stars6. Here we use high-energy electron scattering measurements that isolate nucleon pairs in short-distance, high-momentum configurations7-9, accessing a kinematical regime that has not been previously explored by experiments, corresponding to relative momenta between the pair above 400 megaelectronvolts per c (c, speed of light in vacuum). As the relative momentum between two nucleons increases and their separation thereby decreases, we observe a transition from a spin-dependent tensor force to a predominantly spin-independent scalar force. These results demonstrate the usefulness of using such measurements to study the nuclear interaction at short distances and also support the use of point-like nucleon models with two- and three-body effective interactions to describe nuclear systems up to densities several times higher than the central density of the nucleus."

The final seven steps occur in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and require dolichylphosphate-activated mannose and glucose as donor substrates2. The responsible enzymes-ALG3, ALG9, ALG12, ALG6, ALG8 and ALG10-are glycosyltransferases of the C-superfamily (GT-Cs), which are loosely defined as containing membrane-spanning helices and processing an isoprenoid-linked carbohydrate donor substrate3,4. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of yeast ALG6 at 3.0 Å resolution, which reveals a previously undescribed transmembrane protein fold. Comparison with reported GT-C structures suggests that GT-C enzymes contain a modular architecture with a conserved module and a variable module, each with distinct functional roles. We used synthetic analogues of dolichylphosphate-linked and dolichylpyrophosphate-linked sugars and enzymatic glycan extension to generate donor and acceptor substrates using purified enzymes of the ALG pathway to recapitulate the activity of ALG6 in vitro. A second cryo-electron microscopy structure of ALG6 bound to an analogue of dolichylphosphate-glucose at 3.9 Å resolution revealed the active site of the enzyme. Functional analysis of ALG6 variants identified a catalytic aspartate residue that probably acts as a general base. This residue is conserved in the GT-C superfamily. Our results define the architecture of ER-luminal GT-C enzymes and provide a structural basis for understanding their catalytic mechanisms."

However, there are few longitudinal studies of stigma and discrimination among homeless adults with mental illness. This study aimed to identify the two-year group trajectories of stigma and discrimination and examine the predictive role of mental health characteristics among 414 homeless adults with mental illness participating in the extended follow-up phase of the Toronto At Home/Chez Soi (AH/CS) randomized trial site. Mental health-related perceived stigma and discrimination were measured at baseline, one, and two years using validated scales. Group-based-trajectory modelling was used to identify stigma and discrimination group trajectory memberships and the effect of the Housing First treatment (rent supplements and mental health support services) vs treatment as usual on these trajectories. The associations between mental health-related characteristics and trajectory group memberships were also assessed using multinomial logistic regression. Over two-years, three group trajectories of stigma and discrimination were identified. For discrimination, participants followed a low, moderate, or increasingly high discrimination group trajectory, while for stigma, participants followed a low, moderate or high stigma group trajectory. The Housing First treatment had no significant effect on discrimination or stigma trajectories groups. For the discrimination trajectories, major depressive episode, mood disorder with psychotic features, alcohol abuse, suicidality, severity of mental health symptoms, and substance use severity in the previous year were predictors of moderate and increasingly high discrimination trajectories. History of discrimination within healthcare setting was also positively associated with following a moderate or high discrimination trajectory. For the stigma trajectories, substance dependence, high mental health symptoms severity, substance use severity, and discrimination experiences within healthcare settings were the main predictors for the moderate trajectory group; while substance dependence, suicidality, mental health symptom severity, substance use severity and discrimination experiences within health care setting were also positive predictors for the high stigma trajectory group. Ethno-racial status modified the association between having a major depression episode, alcohol dependence, and the likelihood of being a member of the high stigma trajectory group. This study showed that adults experiencing mental illness and homelessness followed distinct stigma and discrimination group trajectories based on their mental health-problems. There is an urgent need to increase focus on strategies and policies to reduce stigma and discrimination in this population."

Staphylococcus epidermidis is a critical component of the normal human flora that helps control the colonization and invasion of potentially dangerous microbial pathogens.

Aap is a multidomain protein consisting of an N-terminal export signal followed by the A-repeat region (11 partially-conserved 16-residue repeats), a lectin domain, the B-repeat region containing 5–17 conserved repeats of a 128-amino acid sequence, a proline/glycine-rich (P/G-rich) region that forms a highly-extended stalk that is resistant to compaction (23Yarawsky A.E.

The N-terminal portion of Aap containing the A-repeat region and lectin domain (collectively called the A-domain) can be proteolytically cleaved to expose the B-repeat region, which can then initiate bacterial accumulation into microcolonies (18Rohde H.

The staphylococcal metalloprotease SepA is responsible for this proteolytic cleavage event, switching the role of Aap from A-domain–mediated surface adhesion to its namesake role in biofilm accumulation (24Paharik A.E.

Each B-repeat (Brpt) contains a 78-amino acid G5 domain and a 50-amino acid spacer domain (also called an E domain); the B-repeat sequences in Aap are highly conserved, with 83–100% sequence identity (25Conrady D.G.

The final repeat in the B-repeat region is composed of a single G5 domain without the spacer motif (Fig. 1A); this C-terminal half-repeat “cap” plays a role in stabilizing the protein (25Conrady D.G.

We have previously demonstrated that a single B-repeat domain with the half-repeat cap (Brpt1.5) will self-associate in the presence of Zn2+ to form an anti-parallel dimer, leading to a model for Zn2+-mediated protein-dependent intercellular accumulation between staphylococci in a nascent biofilm (25Conrady D.G.

Subsequent work demonstrated that Brpt1.5 and longer B-repeat constructs can self-assemble in the presence of Zn2+ or Cu2+, whereas other metals (Mn2+, Co2+, and Ni2+) can bind to B-repeats but do not induce assembly (27Chaton C.T.

Recent work has shown similar Zn2+-dependent self-association behavior for the B-repeat region of SasG, the S. aureus ortholog of Aap (28Geoghegan J.A. Corrigan R.M. Gruszka D.T. Speziale P. O'Gara J.P. Potts J.R. Foster T.J. Role of surface protein SasG in biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus.J.

(19Corrigan R.M. Rigby D. Handley P. Foster T.J. The role of Staphylococcus aureus surface protein SasG in adherence and biofilm formation.Microbiology. 2007; 153 (17660408): 2435-244610.1099/mic.0.2007/006676-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that at least five tandem B-repeats were required for S. aureus biofilm formation, suggesting that the biological function of SasG and, presumably, Aap relies on longer stretches of at least five consecutive B-repeats. Therefore, the focus of this study is to characterize a biologically-relevant construct of Aap consisting of five consecutive B-repeats and the C-terminal cap (called Brpt5.5; see Fig. 1A) and to determine the role of tandem B-repeats in S. epidermidis biofilm formation. In the presence of Zn2+, tandem B-repeats assembled into a range of oligomeric states, including highly-elongated fibers. We show that Zn2+-induced B-repeat fibers are functional amyloid fibers that assemble in a temperature- and time-dependent fashion. Importantly, fibers formed in vitro by recombinant, tandem B-repeats show at least partial resistance to Zn2+ chelation and acidification, suggesting that these highly stable amyloid fibers may play a critical part in rendering the biofilm resistant to physical or chemical stresses. We apply a newly-developed analytical approach to deconvolute the early-stage assembly of fibril intermediates using analytical ultracentrifugation. Finally, we show that amyloid fibers form during early and late stages of S. epidermidis biofilm growth, and we demonstrate that fibrils isolated from S. epidermidis biofilms are primarily composed of Aap. This is the first report demonstrating that Aap, an essential protein for S. epidermidis infectivity, forms amyloid fibrils; these findings reveal important mechanistic details regarding S. epidermidis infections responsible for extensive morbidity and mortality. To determine the functional relationship between tandem copies of the Aap B-repeat region and S. epidermidis biofilm formation, we have generated a construct containing the C-terminal five intact B-repeats, along with the C-terminal half-repeat (called Brpt5.5) (Fig. 1A). The design of this construct was based on the minimum number of B-repeats previously shown to support biofilm formation by SasG, an Aap ortholog from S. aureus (19Corrigan R.M. Rigby D. Handley P. Foster T.J.

In addition, we utilized a Brpt3.5 construct, both in isolation and as an N-terminally His6-tagged maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion protein (called HMBP–Brpt3.5). The HMBP–Brpt3.5 construct showed more efficient expression and was more stable in solution, so it was predominantly used for initial experiments. Far-UV circular dichroism (CD) was used to verify proper folding of the B-repeats in these constructs (Fig. 1B). Based on our previous studies of related Brpt1.5 constructs (25Conrady D.G.

Indeed, these constructs all contain high β-strand and coil content. The increased negativity around 200 nm observed for the Brpt3.5 and Brpt5.5 constructs may be due to greater random coil contribution from the increased proportion of B-repeat spacer motifs compared with G5 domains in Brpt3.5 and Brpt5.5 (i.e. Brpt5.5 contains five spacer motifs versus six G5 domains (˜45% spacer), whereas Brpt1.5 contains one spacer motif versus two G5 domains (˜33% spacer) (see Fig. 1A)). The CD spectrum for uncleaved HMBP–Brpt3.5 (Fig. S2) revealed a combination of α-helical, β-strand, and coil secondary structure, consistent with the α-helical content of MBP (31Spurlino J.C. Lu G.Y.

Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) was used to characterize each construct in solution under native conditions (Fig. 1C). Brpt3.5 and Brpt5.5 sedimented as monomers with very high frictional ratios (2.58 and 3.55, respectively; the frictional ratio f/f0 is the frictional coefficient of the sedimenting species compared with that of an ideal sphere of identical volume). Although these constructs have similar sedimentation coefficients, the difference in frictional ratios is an important indication of the increased mass of Brpt5.5 compared with Brpt3.5. Such high frictional ratios are indicative of highly-elongated global conformations, such as what might be expected based on our prior characterization of Brpt1.5 (25Conrady D.G. Brescia C.C.

https://openalex.org/W3007334074,"Cancer-associated RNF43 mutations lead to activation of β-catenin signaling through aberrantly increasing Wnt-receptor levels at the membrane. Importantly, inactivating RNF43 mutations have been suggested to render cancer cells sensitive to Wnt-based therapeutics. However, the extent to which RNF43 mutations lead to impaired regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been poorly investigated. Here, we observed that tumors with a functional mismatch repair system show a predominant 5′-location of truncating RNF43 mutations, suggesting C-terminal truncations such as the most commonly reported p.G659fs mutation, do not affect β-catenin signaling. In accordance, expressing C-terminal truncation mutants and wild-type RNF43, showed equal effects on β-catenin signaling, Wnt-receptor turnover, and DVL-binding. We confirmed these observations at endogenous levels by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of G659fs RNF43 expression in KM12 cells and generating comparable mutations in HEK293T cells. We could not confirm previous reports linking RNF43 to p53 and E-cadherin breakdown. Our data also suggest that only colorectal cancer cells harboring N-terminal mutations of RNF43 convey Wnt-dependency onto the tumor cells. Results of this study have potentially important clinical implications indicating that Wnt-based therapeutics should be applied cautiously in cancer patients harboring RNF43 mutations."
https://openalex.org/W3008402633,"The Mucin 1 (MUC1) protein is overexpressed in various cancers and mediates chemotherapy resistance. However, the mechanism is not fully understood. Given that most chemotherapeutic drugs disrupt ER homeostasis as part of their toxicity, and MUC1 expression is regulated by proteins involved in ER homeostasis, we investigated the link between MUC1 and ER homeostasis. MUC1 knockdown in pancreatic cancer cells enhanced unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling and cell death upon ER stress induction. Transcriptomic analysis revealed alterations in the pyrimidine metabolic pathway and cytidine deaminase (CDA). ChIP and CDA activity assays showed that MUC1 occupied CDA gene promoter upon ER stress induction correlating with increased CDA expression and activity in MUC1-expressing cells as compared with MUC1 knockdown cells. Inhibition of either the CDA or pyrimidine metabolic pathway diminished survival in MUC1-expressing cancer cells upon ER stress induction. Metabolomic analysis demonstrated that MUC1-mediated CDA activity corresponded to deoxycytidine to deoxyuridine metabolic reprogramming upon ER stress induction. The resulting increase in deoxyuridine mitigated ER stress-induced cytotoxicity. In addition, given (1) the established roles of MUC1 in protecting cells against reactive oxygen species (ROS) insults, (2) ER stress-generated ROS further promote ER stress and (3) the emerging anti-oxidant property of deoxyuridine, we further investigated if MUC1 regulated ER stress by a deoxyuridine-mediated modulation of ROS levels. We observed that deoxyuridine could abrogate ROS-induced ER stress to promote cancer cell survival. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a novel MUC1-CDA axis of the adaptive UPR that provides survival advantage upon ER stress induction."
https://openalex.org/W3007699275,"Mass loss from the Antarctic Ice Sheet to the ocean has increased in recent decades, largely because the thinning of its floating ice shelves has allowed the outflow of grounded ice to accelerate1,2. Enhanced basal melting of the ice shelves is thought to be the ultimate driver of change2,3, motivating a recent focus on the processes that control ocean heat transport onto and across the seabed of the Antarctic continental shelf towards the ice4–6. However, the shoreward heat flux typically far exceeds that required to match observed melt rates2,7,8, suggesting that other critical controls exist. Here we show that the depth-independent (barotropic) component of the heat flow towards an ice shelf is blocked by the marked step shape of the ice front, and that only the depth-varying (baroclinic) component, which is typically much smaller, can enter the sub-ice cavity. Our results arise from direct observations of the Getz Ice Shelf system and laboratory experiments on a rotating platform. A similar blocking of the barotropic component may occur in other areas with comparable ice–bathymetry configurations, which may explain why changes in the density structure of the water column have been found to be a better indicator of basal melt rate variability than the heat transported onto the continental shelf9. Representing the step topography of the ice front accurately in models is thus important for simulating ocean heat fluxes and induced melt rates. The front of the Getz Ice Shelf in West Antarctica creates an abrupt topographic step that deflects ocean currents, suppressing 70% of the heat delivery to the ice sheet."
https://openalex.org/W3008959887,"The metalloprotease ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17) regulates EGF-receptor and TNFα signaling, thereby not only protecting the skin and intestinal barrier, but also contributing to autoimmunity. ADAM17 can be rapidly activated by many stimuli through its transmembrane domain (TMD), with the seven membrane-spanning inactive Rhomboids (iRhom) 1 and 2 implicated as candidate regulatory partners. However, several alternative models of ADAM17 regulation exist that do not involve the iRhoms, such as regulation through disulfide bond exchange or through interaction with charged phospholipids. Here, we report that a non-activatable mutant of ADAM17 with the TMD of betacellulin (BTC) can be rescued by restoring residues from the ADAM17 TMD, but only in Adam17−/− cells, which contain iRhoms, not in iRhom1/2−/− cells. We also provide the first evidence that the extracellular juxtamembrane domains (JMDs) of ADAM17 and iRhom2 regulate the stimulation and substrate selectivity of ADAM17. Interestingly, a point mutation in the ADAM17 JMD identified in a patient with Tetralogy of Fallot, a serious heart valve defect, affects the substrate selectivity of ADAM17 toward Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor like growth factor (HB-EGF), a crucial regulator of heart valve development in mice. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of ADAM17 through an essential interaction with the TMD1 and JMD1 of iRhom2."

Moreover, it also shows that the relationship between them has not yet been fully predicted and can still be completely understood. This study contains time-variant and time-invariant variables, and these variables usually have an outlier’s problem. As we know that the OLS estimators are more sensitive to react adversely to this problem, yet we have not received enough evidence from similar researches that cares about it. Consistent with these arguments, this study focuses primarily on exploring the influence of corporate governance structure and the capital structure on firms' market-oriented and accounting-based performance, especially with the contemplation of outliers. Hypotheses have been evaluated using M-estimators and S-estimators of robust regression for 45 listed firms for the period from 2013 to 2017. The findings reveal that the governance structure of firms with BOD, independent director, institutional investors, audit committee and female directors accelerates its performance. Further, we find that the leverage ratio improves accounting performance, but it has a downward impact on the share prices of listed firms. Our study contributes to the prevailing literature by proving that the kind of governance structure that based on diverse expert members and a capital structure with a high volume of debt is of utmost importance to the performance of firms as a whole."

We aimed to compare the HRQOL between older Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and their age-gender-matched controls. Methods Older patients with T2D were recruited from a community hospital in Suzhou located in the east part of China while controls were selected from a community-based health survey of older adults aged 60 years or older. HRQOL of cases and controls was assessed by the EQ-5D-3L. The impact of T2D on HRQOL was investigated using a liner regression model and the relationship between T2D and EQ-5D health problems was evaluated using logistic regression models. Results A total of 220 cases and 440 controls were included. The mean age of the participants was 68.8 years and women accounted for 69.1% of the study sample. The EQ-5D-3L index score was lower for older people with T2D (0.886) than their controls (0.955). After multivariable adjustment, the difference in ED-5D-3L index score between older people with and without T2D was 0.072. In logistic regression analyses, T2D was positively associated with reporting of problems in mobility (odds ratio [OR] = 5.00); pain/discomfort (OR = 1.66), and anxiety/depression (OR = 3.2). Conclusions T2D has a detrimental effect on HRQOL of older Chinese people."
https://openalex.org/W3007916462,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance is a major problem in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We generated a TKI-resistant K562 sub-population, K562-IR, under selective imatinib-mesylate pressure. K562-IR cells are CD34-/CD38-, BCR-Abl-independent, proliferate slowly, highly adherent and form intact tumor spheroids. Loss of CD45 and other hematopoietic markers reveal these cells have diverged from their hematopoietic origin. CD34 negativity, high expression of E-cadherin and CD44; decreased levels of CD45 and β-catenin do not fully confer with the leukemic stem cell (LSC) phenotype. Expression analyses reveal that K562-IR cells differentially express tissue/organ development and differentiation genes. Our data suggest that the observed phenotypic shift is an adaptive process rendering cells under TKI stress to become oncogene independent. Cells develop transcriptional instability in search for a gene expression framework suitable for new environmental stresses, resulting in an adaptive phenotypic shift in which some cells partially display LSC-like properties. With leukemic/cancer stem cell targeted therapies underway, the difference between treating an entity and a spectrum of dynamic cellular states will have conclusive effects on the outcome."

However, the mechanisms by which bladder carcinoma cells induce lymphangiogenesis and further promote metastasis in the lymphatic system remain unclear. Here, we show that the transcription factor GATA-binding factor 6 (GATA6) was substantially downregulated in bladder cancer via promoter hypermethylation. Low-level GATA6 expression significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis positivity and was able to predict earlier relapse and shorter survival of bladder cancer. Reconstitution of GATA6 inhibited lymphangiogenesis and lymph node metastasis in GATA6-low bladder cancer cells, while silencing of GATA6 rendered lymphatic metastasis in GATA6-high bladder cancer cells. Additionally, we demonstrated that GATA6 bound to the promoter of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C, a lymphangiogenic factor, and acted as a transcriptional repressor. This GATA6/VEGF-C axis was essential for GATA6-mediated lymphatic metastasis. In bladder cancer patients, low GATA6 correlated with high VEGF-C and reduced overall survival. These findings indicate GATA6 as a pivotal regulator in the lymphatic dissemination of bladder cancer and suggest a new therapeutic target for the disease."

https://openalex.org/W3007020747,"Background Airway obstruction due to decreased airway diameter and increased incidence of mucus plugs has not been directly observed in asthma exacerbation. We studied the changes in the inner diameter of the airway (Din) and the frequency of mucus plugs by airway generation in patients with asthma exacerbation. We compared these patients to those in a stable phase using high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). Methods and findings Thirteen patients with asthma were studied by HRCT during asthma exacerbation and in a stable period. The HRCT study was performed on patients who could safely hold their breath for a short while in a supine position 1 hour after initial treatment for asthma exacerbation. Using a curved multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) software, we reconstructed the longitudinal airway images and the images exactly perpendicular to the airway axis to measure the Din and mucus plugs from the second- (segmental) to sixth-generation bronchi in all segments of the lungs.The ratios of Din (exacerbation/stable) were 0.91(P = 0.016), 0.88 (P = 0.002), 0.83 (P = 0.001), 0.80 (P = 0.001), and 0.87 (NS) in the second-, third-, fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-generation bronchi, respectively. The percentages of airway obstruction due to mucus plugs were notably higher in the fourth- and fifth-generation bronchi (17.9%/18.1% in stable phase and 43.2%/45.9% in the exacerbation phase, respectively) than in the other generations of bronchi. Conclusions Among the bronchi examined, the fourth- and fifth-generation bronchi were significantly obstructed during asthma exacerbation compared with the stable phase in terms of a decreased airway diameter and mucus plugs."
https://openalex.org/W3007474638,"Background Non-adherence with medications in pregnancy is increasingly recognized and often results in a higher rate of preventable maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Non-adherence with prophylactic aspirin amongst high-risk pregnant women is associated with higher incidence of preeclampsia, preterm delivery and intrauterine growth restriction. Yet, the factors that influences adherence with aspirin in pregnancy, from the women’s perspective, remains poorly understood. Objective The study is aimed at understanding the factors, from the women’s perspective, that influenced adherence with prophylactic aspirin in their pregnancy. Study design A sequential-exploratory designed mixed methods quantitative (n = 122) and qualitative (n = 6) survey of women with recent high-risk pregnancy necessitating antenatal prophylactic aspirin was utilized. Women recruited underwent their antenatal care in one of three high-risk pregnancy clinics within the South Western Sydney Local Health District, Australia. The quantitative study was done through an electronic anonymous survey and the qualitative study was conducted through a face-to-face interview. Data obtained was analysed against women’s adherence with aspirin utilizing phi correlation (φ) with significance set at <0.05. Results Two key themes, from the women’s perspective, that influenced their adherence with aspirin in pregnancy were identified; (1) pill burden and non-intention omission (2) communication and relationship with health care provider (HCP). Pill burden and its associated non-intentional omission, both strongly corelated with reduced adherence (Φ = 0.8, p = 0.02, Φ = 0.8, p<0.01) whilst the use of reminder strategies minimized accidental omission and improved adherence (Φ = 0.9, p<0.01). Consistent communication between HCPs and a good patient-HCP relationship was strongly associated with improved adherence (Φ = 0.7, p = 0.04, Φ = 0.9, p = <0.01) and more importantly was found to play an important role in alleviating factors that had potentials to negatively influence adherence with aspirin in pregnancy. Conclusion This study identified factors that both positively and negatively influenced adherence with aspirin amongst high-risk pregnant women. Is highlights the importance in recognizing the impact of pill burden in pregnancy and the need to counsel women on the utility of reminder strategies to minimize non-intentional omission. Importantly, it emphasizes on the importance of a positive patient-HCP relationship through effective and consistent communication to achieve the desired maternal and fetal outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3008206242,"Animal cells use pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect specific pathogens. Pathogen detection mounts an appropriate immune response, including interferon and cytokine induction. The intracellular PRR-signaling pathways that detect DNA viruses have been characterized, particularly in myeloid cells. In these pathways, cGMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and the pyrin and HIN domain family member (PYHIN) protein interferon-γ–inducible protein 16 (IFI16) detect DNA and signal via stimulator of interferon genes protein (STING). However, although airway epithelial cells are frontline sentinels in detecting pathogens, information on how they respond to DNA viruses is limited, and the roles of PYHIN proteins in these cells are unknown. Here, we examined expression and activities of cGAS, STING, and PYHINs in human lung epithelial cells. A549 epithelial cells, commonly used for RNA-sensing studies, failed to respond to DNA because they lacked STING expression, and ectopic STING expression restored a cGAS-dependent DNA response in these cells. In contrast, NuLi-1 immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells did express STING, which was activated after DNA stimulation and mediated DNA-dependent gene induction. PYHIN1, which like IFI16 has been proposed to be a viral DNA sensor, was the only PYHIN protein expressed in both airway epithelial cell types. However, rather than having a role in DNA sensing, PYHIN1 induced proinflammatory cytokines in response to interleukin-1 (IL-1) or tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) stimulation.

DNA-sensing PRRs have been intensively studied in recent years and have been shown to have an important role in alerting the cell to the presence of viruses and other pathogens by stimulating production of cytokines and interferons (IFNs), and also to drive autoimmunity by inappropriate responses to self DNA (1Schlee M. Hartmann G. Discriminating self from non-self in nucleic acid sensing.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2016; 16 (27455396): 566-58010.1038/nri.2016.78Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). For more than a decade, STING has been known to be a signaling adaptor protein with a role in DNA sensing (2Ishikawa H. Barber G.N.

The best characterized of these is cGMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) (4Sun L. Wu J. Du F. Chen X. Chen Z.J. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase is a cytosolic DNA sensor that activates the type I interferon pathway.Science. 2013; 339 (23258413): 786-79110.1126/science.1232458Crossref PubMed Scopus (2524) Google Scholar). cGAS directly binds dsDNA, which stimulates the enzyme's catalytic activity leading to synthesis of the second messenger cGMP-AMP (cGAMP) (5Chen Q. Sun L. Chen Z.J. Regulation and function of the cGAS-STING pathway of cytosolic DNA sensing.Nat.

STING then translocates to perinuclear signaling compartments where it associates with and activates the kinase TBK1. TBK1 mediates activation of IRF3 and of other transcription factors downstream of STING, giving rise to IFN and cytokine induction (5Chen Q. Sun L. Chen Z.J.

Like cGAS, the human PYHIN (pyrin and hematopoietic interferon-inducible nuclear antigen with 200 amino acid repeats (HIN) domain) protein IFNγ–inducible protein 16 (IFI16) is also a PRR for dsDNA, acting upstream of STING to mediate cytokine and IFNβ induction (9Unterholzner L.

Although human airway epithelial cells are frontline sentinels in the detection of invading pathogens, in contrast to monocytes and keratinocytes, much less is known about how airway epithelial cells respond to DNA, and the role of cGAS, STING and PYHIN proteins in these cells. Thus, here we aimed to characterize the role of cGAS, STING, and PYHINs in human lung epithelial cell lines and their potential contribution to DNA sensing. Apart from IFI16, there are four other human PYHIN proteins: absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen (MNDA), pyrin and HIN domain family member 1 (PYHIN1, also called IFIX), and pyrin domain only protein 3 (POP3) (12Connolly D.J.

PYHIN proteins are named because of the presence of an N-terminal pyrin domain, a motif that mediates oligomerization and is part of the death domain fold superfamily, and with the exception of POP3, one or two C-terminal HIN domains which are capable of binding dsDNA (12Connolly D.J.

Compared with AIM2 and IFI16, very little is known about the role of MNDA and PYHIN1 in innate immunity. The PYHIN1 gene encodes up to six PYHIN1 protein isoforms because of alternative splicing, all six of which contain the pyrin domain, whereas only four contain a HIN domain (25Ding Y. Wang L. Su L.K.

A meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies correlated SNPs present in the PYHIN1 gene region with asthma in African-American and African-Caribbean populations, suggesting a possible link between this PYHIN protein and asthma pathogenesis (28Torgerson D.G.

However, further analysis did not confirm the significant linkage between asthma-associated loci and PYHIN1 gene in individuals of African ancestry (29Kantor D.B. Palmer C.D. Young T.R. Meng Y.

Gene variants of PYHIN1 were also associated with pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (30Andreoletti G. Ashton J.J. Coelho T. Willis C. Haggarty R. Gibson J. Holloway J. Batra A. Afzal N.A. Beattie R.M. Ennis S. Exome analysis of patients with concurrent pediatric inflammatory bowel disease and autoimmune disease.Inflamm.

One study recently suggested that like IFI16, PYHIN1 may be a PRR for viral DNA, because knockdown of PYHIN1 expression in fibroblast cells, using shRNAs targeting all six isoforms, significantly enhanced HSV-1 titers compared with control cells, suggesting that PYHIN-1 inhibits HSV-1 replication (31Diner B.A. Li T.

Further, PYHIN1 directly bound dsDNA via its HIN domain, and dsDNA transfection of HEK293 cells ectopically expressing PYHIN1 led to IFNβ mRNA induction (31Diner B.A. Li T. Greco T.M. Crow M.S.

To gain insights into the roles of STING, cGAS, and PYHIN proteins in human airway epithelial cells, we characterized the dsDNA sensing response in A549 cells, a commonly used human lung epithelial cell line for RNA virus studies. We also examined dsDNA sensing pathways for the first time in NuLi-1 cells, which are immortalized normal human bronchial epithelial cells. We found that A549 cells did not mount a robust innate immune response to dsDNA compared with RNA because of a lack of STING expression. Restoring STING expression in A549 cells led to a cGAS-dependent DNA response. In contrast, NuLi-1 cells did express STING, which was activated after DNA stimulation, and DNA-stimulated gene induction was STING-dependent. Both A549 and NuLi-1 cells expressed PYHIN1, and here we show for the first time a role for PYHIN1 not in DNA sensing, but in induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα and IL-6). To examine innate immune DNA-sensing responses in airway epithelial cells we employed the human lung epithelial cell line A549, which is commonly used as an in vitro model for RNA virus infection of lung. We compared the response of A549 cells to human monocytic THP-1 cells differentiated with PMA, which are extensively characterized for cytosolic DNA sensing responses. Production of IP10 (CXCL10), a common marker of a PRR response, was assessed in both cells types after infection with RNA and DNA viruses. Surprisingly, although A549 cells responded robustly to the RNA virus Sendai (SeV), no IP10 production was apparent after infection of A549 cells with dsDNA viruses, namely the poxvirus modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) or HSV-1 (Fig. 1A). Under the same infection conditions, THP-1 cells produced significant amounts of IP10 for each virus tested (Fig. 1B). The same trend was observed when type I IFN production was measured by bioassay: A549 cells only responded to SeV and not MVA or HSV-1, whereas type I IFN was elicited from THP-1 cells for all three viruses (Fig. 1, C and D). We next examined cellular responses to pure nucleic acid ligands. For this, a synthetic dsDNA known to stimulate STING-dependent responses, VACV 70-mer (9Unterholzner L. Keating S.E. Baran M. Horan K.A. Jensen S.B. Sharma S. Sirois C.M. Jin T. Latz E. Xiao T.S. Fitzgerald K.A. Paludan S.R. Bowie A.G. IFI16 is an innate immune sensor for intracellular DNA.Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11 (20890285): 997-100410.1038/ni.1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar), and 5′triphosphate dsRNA (5′pppRNA), which is a ligand for the RNA sensing PRR RIG-I (33Yoneyama M. Onomoto K. Jogi M. Akaboshi T. Fujita T. Viral RNA detection by RIG-I-like receptors.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2015; 32 (25594890): 48-5310.1016/j.coi.2014.12.012Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), were used. Transfection of the RIG-I ligand into either A549 or THP-1 cells induced robust IP10 mRNA induction, whereas transfection of 70-mer caused substantial IP10 induction in THP-1 cells but only a marginal response in A549 cells (Fig. 1E). We wondered what would account for the difference in response to DNA and DNA viruses in A549 cells compared with THP-1 and so examined expression of cGAS, STING, and PYHIN proteins both in unstimulated and nucleic acid–stimulated cells by immunoblot. Interestingly, although cGAS expression was comparable in both cell types, STING expression was minimal to undetectable in A549 cells (Fig. 1F). We also noted that THP-1 cells expressed detectable amounts of the PYHINs IFI16, AIM2, MNDA, and PYHIN1, whereas A549 cells only expressed detectable PYHIN1 (Fig. 1F). We next determined whether transfection of plasmids encoding PYHINs, cGAS, STING, or DDX41 would restore an IFN response to DNA in A549 cells. Like cGAS and IFI16, DDX41 has been shown to be a PRR for dsDNA acting upstream of STING (34Zhang Z. Yuan B. Bao M. Lu N. Kim T. Liu Y.J. The helicase DDX41 senses intracellular DNA mediated by the adaptor STING in dendritic cells.Nat. Immunol. 2011; 12 (21892174): 959-96510.1038/ni.2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). In this reconstitution system, the transfected plasmid DNA provides the DNA PAMP, while the IFN response is measured by an IFNβ promoter reporter gene (10Almine J.F. O'Hare C.A. Dunphy G. Haga I.R.

This showed that transfection of a plasmid encoding STING, but not AIM2, IFI16, MNDA, cGAS, or DDX41, was sufficient to restore a robust IFNβ response (Fig. 2A). Fig. S1, A–D, confirms that all of the transfected plasmids expressed the expected proteins of correct molecular weight, albeit that some proteins, especially AIM2 were difficult to detect because of the low transfection efficiency of A549 cells compared with HEK293T cells (compare Fig. S1A to Fig. 6C).Figure 6PYHIN1 regulates the IL-6 and TNF promoters.

The data are mean ± S.D. of triplicate samples and are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Of the DNA PRRs that signal via STING (cGAS, IFI16, and DDX41), only cGAS expression was detectable in untransfected A549 cells (Fig. 1A), so we reasoned that ectopic STING expression was restoring a cGAS-dependent response. To test this, cGAS siRNA was employed, which effectively reduced endogenous cGAS expression (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2C shows that the IFNβ response restored by STING expression was cGAS-dependent, because cGAS siRNA completely prevented STING-stimulated IFNβ promoter induction. This suggested that A549 cells were capable of producing cGAMP in response to DNA, even though the IFNβ response was impaired because of lack of STING expression. To provide further evidence for this, we employed a cGAMP bioassay modified from a previous study (10Almine J.F. O'Hare C.A. Dunphy G. Haga I.R. Naik R.J. Atrih A. Connolly D.J. Taylor J.

https://openalex.org/W3007187416,"The optics of the eye is the key to a functioning visual system. The exact nature of the correlation between ocular optics and eye development is not known because of the paucity of knowledge about the growth of a key optical element, the eye lens. The sophisticated optics of the lens and its gradient of refractive index provide the superior optical quality that the eye needs and which, it is thought, has a major influence on the development of proper visual function. The nature of a gradient refractive index lens, however, renders accurate measurements of its development difficult to make and has been the reason why the influence of lens growth on visual function remains largely unknown. Novel imaging techniques have made it possible to investigate growth of the eye lens in the zebrafish. This study shows measurements using X-ray Talbot interferometry of three-dimensional gradient index profiles in eye lenses of zebrafish from late larval to adult stages. The zebrafish lens shows evidence of a gradient of refractive index from the earliest stages measured and its growth suggests an apparent coincidence between periods of rapid increase in refractive index in the lens nucleus and increased expression of a particular crystallin protein group."

However, there is a lack of scales for the comprehensive assessment of adverse childhood experiences providing information of various types and the age of occurrence. Based on the complete, experimental version of the Maltreatment and abuse chronology of exposure (MACE-X) scale, the present study aimed to develop and psychometrically test a Norwegian version of MACE.The 75-item MACE-X was translated from German to Norwegian and administered as a self-report measure to 90 outpatients and 145 employees at a Division of specialized mental health care in South-Eastern Norway. The outpatients also completed the Childhood trauma questionnaire (CTQ) and the Symptom checklist 90 (SCL-90) to investigate convergent and predictive validity. To investigate test-retest reliability, outpatients completed MACE once more two weeks later.Rasch analysis and Anderson likelihood ratio tests on the combined outpatient and employee data resulted in a 55 item version of the Norwegian MACE. In the outpatient group, test-retest reliability of the MACE-55 was excellent for total scores (ICC ≥ 0.94) and good to excellent for 10 subscale scores (ICC ≥ 0.82). Convergent validity with the CTQ was moderate to high for both total scores (0.63 ≥ r ≥ 0.86) and subscale scores (0.56 ≥ r ≥ 0.82). As compared to CTQ total scores, a MACE total score that combined severity and duration of exposure was numerically more strongly associated with overall psychiatric symptoms and each of nine symptom domains on the SCL-90.The newly developed Norwegian MACE comprehensively assesses past exposure to adverse childhood experiences with high psychometric properties. This scale is a useful tool for research questions addressing sensitive periods for childhood adversities and associated health phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W3008791246,"Previous research has established a correlation between literacy skills and sign language skills among deaf children raised in signing families, but little research has examined the impact of early signing skills on the rate of growth of emergent literacy in early childhood. A subset of data was extracted from a larger dataset containing national longitudinal data from a three-year investigation of early literacy development of deaf children who were between the ages of three and six at the outset of the study. Selection criteria for inclusion in this limited sample included: 1) being rated as having little or no access to spoken language and 2) being raised in homes in which signs were regularly used as a means of communication (N = 56). Our purpose was twofold: 1) to examine and describe the trajectories of growth in letter and word identification skill for this sample in relation to the participants’ initial ages; and 2) to assess the degree to which the presence or deaf parents in the home (DoD) and the receptive American Sign Language (ASL) skills of the participants impacted both the level of emerging print literacy and its rate of growth over the three year period. We hypothesized that both the presence of a deaf parent in the home and the acquisition of ASL skills, a strong native language, would contribute to both the overall letter and word identification skills and to the rates of growth of this skill over time. Results indicated that having a deaf parent did, indeed, impact emergent literacy attainment, but its effect was rendered nonsignificant when ASL skill was taken into consideration. Possession of stronger ASL skills, whether or not the children had deaf parents, contributed significantly to both the levels and rate of growth. The findings contribute to the body of work that emphasizes the importance early language skills (spoken or signed) to later academic success and dispels the myth that deaf children with deaf parents have exclusive access to the acquisition of these skills."
https://openalex.org/W3006731763,"Protein maturation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) depends on a fine balance between oxidative protein folding and quality control mechanisms, which together ensure high-capacity export of properly folded proteins from the ER. Oxidative protein folding needs to be regulated to avoid hyperoxidation. The folding capacity of the ER is regulated by the unfolded protein response (UPR) and ER-associated degradation (ERAD). The UPR is triggered by unfolded protein stress and leads to up-regulation of cellular components such as chaperones and folding catalysts. These components relieve stress by increasing folding capacity and up-regulating ERAD components that remove non-native proteins. Although oxidative protein folding and the UPR/ERAD pathways each are well-understood, very little is known about any direct cross-talk between them. In this study, we carried out comprehensive in vitro activity and binding assays, indicating that the oxidative protein folding relay formed by ER oxidoreductin 1 (Ero1), and protein disulfide-isomerase can be inactivated by a feedback inhibition mechanism involving unfolded proteins and folding intermediates when their levels exceed the folding capacity of the system. This mechanism allows client proteins to remain mainly in the reduced state and thereby minimizes potential futile oxidation-reduction cycles and may also enhance ERAD, which requires reduced protein substrates. Relief from excess levels of non-native proteins by increasing the levels of folding factors removed the feedback inhibition. These results reveal regulatory cross-talk between the oxidative protein folding and UPR and ERAD pathways."

We systematically collected numerous clinical (symptoms, pulmonary function, comorbidities, and treatment) and social (financial situation, housing situation, family support, caregiver overload, ability to perform activities, and risk of social exclusion) variables using several questionnaires and indices. The patients were followed closely for one year and readmissions at 30, 60, and 365 days were analysed.253 patients were included, aged 68.9±9.8years, FEV1 = 42.1%±14.2%, and a Charlson's index = 1.8±0.9. Of these patients, 20.2%, 39.6%, and 63.7% were readmitted within the first 30, 90, and 365 days after discharge, respectively. In the multivariate model applied, the variables that were independently associated with readmission over all three periods of the analysis were dependence to perform basic activities of daily living (BADLs) (odds ratio [OR] = 2.10-4.10) and a history of two or more admissions within the previous year (OR = 2.78-3.78). At 90 days, a history of bacterial isolates in a previous sputum culture (OR = 2.39) and at 365 days, a high grade of dyspnoea (OR = 2.51) and obesity (OR = 2.38) were also identified as predictors of hospital readmission.The patients' limitation to perform BADLs and their history of admissions for AECOPD were the best predictive variables for the likelihood of readmission when adjusted for many other social and clinical variables, regardless of the time period considered for such prediction."

Only a few studies have targeted communities along the Eastern seaboard, leaving a variety of microbial ecosystems uncharacterized. In this study, we examine the microbial community structure within three South Carolina beaches along the Grand Strand via sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene to discern relationships between diversity and temporal or regional factors. Gammaproteobacteria, Planctomycetes, Acidobacteria, and Actinobacteria dominated the composition of these beaches. Diversity analyses revealed that highly diverse communities were similar in overall composition and diversity but showed different levels of community structure stability over time. The community structure in Pawleys Island sands showed no significant change over time, while Garden City experienced significant shifts between each sampling date. Community structure also differed between beaches and, to a lesser degree, sampling date. These data provide evidence of the high microbial diversity within these beach sands and suggest that even though beaches of the same geographic region can show similarity in composition and diversity at a particular timepoint, the nature of their community structure and underlying diversity may differ comparatively and over time."

Due in part to misdiagnosis, this infectious disease results in nearly 60,000 deaths per year around the globe. This study represents the first effort to describe the diversity of pathogenic Leptospira in Cuba based on whole-genome sequencing. We have collected nineteen whole-blood samples from patients that were diagnosed as having leptospirosis between 2008 and 2012 in Cuba. In addition, we have enhanced our sample set by three historical strains that were used for the development of a human vaccine in 1990s. The Leptospira strains were grown and serotyped by the microscopic agglutination test, and the draft genomes were generated by NGS (Illumina). Subsequently, the core genomes were analyzed and compared to the genetic data available from other Caribbean islands and countries in Central America. Core genome Multi-locus Sequence Typing (cgMLST) revealed four different core genome clonal groups (cgCGs), with the highest number of samples belonging to L. interrogans, followed by L. borgpetersenii and L. kirschneri. All cgCGs that were found in Cuba have been also identified from multiple origins across the globe, except in neighbor countries and Central America. Serotyping divided the samples into the serogroups Canicola, Ballum and Pomona. The most frequent cgCGs, cgCG28, associated with serogroup Canicola, and cgCG15, associated with serogroup Ballum, have also been identified from samples isolated from dogs, rodents, and pigs; suggesting that these hosts represent the major source of human infection in Cuba. The vaccine strains did not significantly differ from the recent patient isolates. However, the increasing prevalence of samples belonging to the serogroup Ballum combined with the fact that the available vaccine in Cuba represents inactivated Leptospira belonging to serogroups other than Ballum, should be a valuable information for the National and Regional Leptospirosis Control Programs."
https://openalex.org/W3008287314,"Plasma in several organisms has components that promote resistance to envenomation by inhibiting specific proteins from snake venoms, such as phospholipases A2 (PLA2s). The major hypothesis for inhibitor's presence would be the protection against self-envenomation in venomous snakes, but the occurrence of inhibitors in non-venomous snakes and other animals has opened new perspectives for this molecule. Thus, this study showed for the first time the structural and functional characterization of the PLA2 inhibitor from the Boa constrictor serum (BoaγPLI), a non-venomous snake that dwells extensively the Brazilian territory. Therefore, the inhibitor was isolated from B. constrictor serum, with 0.63% of recovery. SDS-PAGE showed a band at ~25 kDa under reducing conditions and ~20 kDa under non-reducing conditions. Chromatographic analyses showed the presence of oligomers formed by BoaγPLI. Primary structure of BoaγPLI suggested an estimated molecular mass of 22 kDa. When BoaγPLI was incubated with Asp-49 and Lys-49 PLA2 there was no severe change in its dichroism spectrum, suggesting a non-covalent interaction. The enzymatic assay showed a dose-dependent inhibition, up to 48.2%, when BoaγPLI was incubated with Asp-49 PLA2, since Lys-49 PLA2 has a lack of enzymatic activity. The edematogenic and myotoxic effects of PLA2s were also inhibited by BoaγPLI. In summary, the present work provides new insights into inhibitors from non-venomous snakes, which possess PLIs in their plasma, although the contact with venom is unlikely."

Major challenges, however, include the lack of guidewires that are compatible with the MRI environment, not susceptible to radiofrequency-induced heating, and reliably visualized. Preclinical evaluation of new guidewire designs has been conducted at 1.5T. Here we further evaluate the safety (device heating), device visualization, and procedural feasibility of 3T MRI-guided cardiovascular catheterization using a novel MRI-visible glass-fiber epoxy-based guidewire in phantoms and porcine models.To evaluate device safety, guidewire tip heating (GTH) was measured in phantom experiments with different combinations of catheters and guidewires. In vivo cardiovascular catheterization procedures were performed in both healthy (N = 5) and infarcted (N = 5) porcine models under real-time 3T MRI guidance using a glass-fiber epoxy-based guidewire. The times for each procedural step were recorded separately. Guidewire visualization was assessed by measuring the dimensions of the guidewire-induced signal void and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) between the guidewire tip signal void and the blood signal in real-time gradient-echo MRI (specific absorption rate [SAR] = 0.04 W/kg).In the phantom experiments, GTH did not exceed 0.35°C when using the real-time gradient-echo sequence (SAR = 0.04 W/kg), demonstrating the safety of the glass-fiber epoxy-based guidewire at 3T. The catheter was successfully placed in the left ventricle (LV) under real-time MRI for all five healthy subjects and three out of five infarcted subjects. Signal void dimensions and CNR values showed consistent visualization of the glass-fiber epoxy-based guidewire in real-time MRI. The average time (minutes:seconds) for the catheterization procedure in all subjects was 4:32, although the procedure time varied depending on the subject's specific anatomy (standard deviation = 4:41).Real-time 3T MRI-guided cardiovascular catheterization using a new MRI-visible glass-fiber epoxy-based guidewire is feasible in terms of visualization and guidewire navigation, and safe in terms of radiofrequency-induced guidewire tip heating."
https://openalex.org/W3007802207,"Reasons for performing study Although muscle mass strongly influences performance, there is currently no effective means to measure the 3-dimensional muscle mass of horses. We evaluated a 3-dimensional (3D) scanning methodology for its ability to quantify torso and hindquarter volumes as a proxy for regional muscle mass in horses. Objectives Determine the repeatability of 3D scanning volume (V) measurements and their correlation to body weight, estimated body volume and muscle/fat ultrasound (US) depth. Methods Handheld 3D photonic scans were performed on 16 Quarter Horses of known body weight 56 days apart (n = 32 scans) with each scan performed in duplicate (n = 32 replicates). Tail head fat, gluteal and longissimus dorsi muscle depths were measured using US. Processed scans were cropped to isolate hindquarter (above hock, caudal to tuber coxae) and torso (hindquarter plus dorsal thoracolumbar region) segments and algorithms used to calculate V. Torso and hindquarter volume were correlated with body weight and US using Pearson’s correlation and with estimated torso volume (50% body weight / body density) with Bland-Altman analysis. Results Scans took 2 min with < 3.5% error for duplicate scans. Torso volume (R = 0.90, P< 0.001) and hindquarter volume (R = 0.82, P< 0.001) strongly correlated with body weight and estimated BV (R = 0.91) with low bias. Torso volume moderately correlated to mean muscle US depth (R = 0.4, P< 0.05) and tail head fat (R = 0.42, P< 0.01). Mean muscle US depth moderately correlated to body weight (R = 0.50, P< 0.01). Main limitations 3D Scans determine body volume not muscle volume. Conclusions The hand-held 3D scan provided a rapid repeatable assessment of torso and hindquarter volume strongly correlated to body weight and estimated volume. Superimposition of regional scans and volume measures could provide a practical means to follow muscle development when tail head fat depth remain constant."
https://openalex.org/W3008778774,"Tumor antigens processed and presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) Class I alleles are important targets in tumor immunotherapies. Clinical trials showed that presence of CD8+ T cells specific to tumor associated antigens (TAAs) and tumor neoantigens is one of the main factors resulting in tumor regression. Affinity prediction of tumor antigen epitopes to HLA is an important reference index for peptide selection, which is highly individualized. In this study, we selected 6 CTAs (cancer-testis antigens) commonly used in cancer immunotherapy and top 95 hot mutations from the Cancer Genome Atlas for analyzing potential epitopes with high affinities to the common HLA class I molecules in white and East Asian population, respectively. The results showed that the overall difference in CTAs epitope prediction is small between the two populations. Meanwhile, there is a linear relationship between the CTAs peptide length and the relative overall epitope occurrence. However, the difference is bigger for epitopes prediction of missense mutations between the two populations. It is worth noting that, both in the two populations, the single point mutations with the highest incidences have the lowest epitope occurrences while the mutations with the highest epitope occurrences are with low mutation incidences. This may be the result of long-term selection by the host immunosurveillance. Frameshift/inframe indel mutation neoantigens are between CTAs and spot mutation neoantigens in the relationship between peptide length and predicted epitope number. Our results help provide clues for tumor antigen and epitope selection in cancer vaccine design."
https://openalex.org/W3006850052,"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a chloride channel activated by protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation on the regulatory (R) domain. Phosphorylation at several R domain residues stimulates ATP-dependent channel openings and closings, termed channel gating. To explore the protein segment responsible for channel potentiation and PKA-dependent activation, deletion mutations were constructed by removing one to three protein segments of the R domain including residues 708–759 (ΔR708–759), R760–783, and R784–835, each of which contains one or two PKA phosphorylation sites. Deletion of R708–759 or R760–783 had little effect on CFTR gating, whereas all mutations lacking R784–835 reduced CFTR activity by decreasing the mean burst duration and increasing the interburst interval (IBI). The data suggest that R784–835 plays a major role in stimulating CFTR gating. For ATP-associated regulation, ΔR784–835 had minor impact on gating potentiation by 2′dATP, CaATP, and pyrophosphate. Interestingly, introducing a phosphorylated peptide matching R809–835 shortened the IBI of ΔR708–835-CFTR. Consistently, ΔR815–835, but not ΔR784–814, enhanced IBI, whereas both reduced mean burst duration. These data suggest that the entirety of R784–835 is required for stabilizing the open state of CFTR; however, R815–835, through interactions with the channel, is dominant for enhancing the opening rate. Of note, PKA markedly decreased the IBI of ΔR708–783-CFTR. Conversely, the IBI of ΔR708–814–CFTR was short and PKA-independent. These data reveal that for stimulating CFTR gating, PKA phosphorylation may relieve R784–814–mediated autoinhibition that prevents IBI shortening by R815–835. This mechanism may elucidate how the R domain potentiates channel gating and may unveil CFTR stimulation by other protein kinases.

However, the ΔRS660A mutation that deletes a large part of the R domain (ΔR708–835) generates substantial basal activity so that this mutation greatly attenuates cAMP-stimulated CFTR current (9Rich D.P.

These findings suggest that R708–835 may contain inhibitory protein segments that directly prohibit CFTR activation. Interestingly, the ΔRS660A mutation also greatly reduces the open probability (Po) of CFTR (11Winter M.C. Welsh M.J.

These data suggest that the phosphorylated R domain is able to stimulate the channel activity of CFTR. In addition, previous work found that R817–838 containing no PKA phosphorylation site is also required for stimulating CFTR gating (14Xie J. Adams L.M. Zhao J. Gerken T.A. Davis P.B. Ma J.

In other words, these site-directed mutations may eliminate or alter the postphosphorylation function of target residues, but they may also retain or modify their prephosphorylation actions. To avoid this confounding factor, deletion mutations were used in this study for removing all pre- and postphosphorylation function of residues. To investigate the segmental function of the R domain in regulation of CFTR gating, this study first searched which protein segment plays a major role in regulating CFTR gating. Then the study further explored whether the R domain–mediated stimulation is caused by ATP-associated gating regulation and how PKA phosphorylation elicits the gating stimulation. Similar to previous work (26Baldursson O. Ostedgaard L.S. Rokhlina T. Cotten J.F. Welsh M.J. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator Cl− channels with R domain deletions and translocations show phosphorylation-dependent and -independent activity.J. Biol.

All CFTR mutants in this study included a S660A mutation for data comparison (Fig. 1A). To test segmental function of the R domain in channel gating, the single-channel activity of CFTR mutants that deleted one to three protein segments of R1, R2, and R3 was carefully examined (Fig. 1B). All deletion mutations were without effect on the single-channel current amplitude (i) of the CFTR Cl− channel (Fig. 1, B and C). The deletion of R1 alone (ΔR1) showed little or no effect on the open probability (Po) (Fig. 1D) and mean burst duration (MBD) of CFTR (Fig. 1E) but appeared to decrease the interburst interval (IBI) (Fig. 1F, p = 0.07, one-way ANOVA). In addition, ΔR2 did not alter Po, MBD, and IBI (Fig. 1, D–F). By contrast, ΔR12 that removes R1 and R2 together mildly reduced Po (Fig. 1D) because of a large decrease in MBD (Fig. 1E) with no change in IBI (Fig. 1F). However, the Po of those CFTR mutants with R3 deleted, including ΔR3-, ΔR23-, and ΔR123-CFTR, were greatly decreased (Fig. 1D, gray columns) by large decreases in MBD (Fig. 1E) and marked increases in IBI (Fig. 1F). Notably, ΔR123-CFTR here is the same as ΔRS660A-CFTR tested in early studies (9Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Anderson M.P. Manavalan P. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J.

These data suggest that R3 is required for stimulating CFTR gating, whereas R1 and R2 might contribute to MBD regulation. It is also possible that a large deletion of R1 and R2 together in ΔR12-CFTR may disturb the function of R3 in the MBD prolongation. ATP-dependent CFTR gating may consist of three primary gating motions: ATP-mediated NBD dimerization, NBD/MSD coupling, and transmembrane gate movements (2Hwang T.C. Kirk K.L.

Therefore, the R domain by interacting with the intracellular side of CFTR may modulate channel gating via two major pathways: 1) it may alter properties of ATPase sites in the interface of two NBDs (11Winter M.C.

To test the first mechanism, three gating stimulators that may enhance ATP-associated gating regulation were used (Fig. 2), including 2′dATP (1 mm) as an ATP analogue (29Aleksandrov A.A.

If R3 regulates CFTR gating through modifying ATP function in NBDs, one would expect to find that potentiation effects of stimulators on channel gating may be greatly altered in those mutants with R3 deleted. However, the data demonstrate that three gating stimulators, 2′dATP, CaATP, and PPi, largely increased the macroscopic currents (Fig. 2, A and B), Po (Fig. 2D), and i × Po values (Fig. 2E) of all tested CFTR constructs at similar levels of ˜2–3-fold enhancements (Fig. 2, B and E). PPi also slightly decreased the i of WT and all mutant CFTRs (Fig. 2C), similar to the previous finding (32Scott-Ward T."

They catalyze the esterification of specific amino acids to the 3′-end of their cognate tRNAs and therefore play a pivotal role in protein synthesis. Although previous studies suggest that aaRS-dependent errors in protein synthesis can be beneficial to some microbial species, evidence that reduced aaRS fidelity can be adaptive is limited. Using bioinformatics analyses, we identified two distinct leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) genes within all genomes of the archaeal family Sulfolobaceae. Remarkably, one copy, designated LeuRS-I, had key amino acid substitutions within its editing domain that would be expected to disrupt hydrolytic editing of mischarged tRNALeu and to result in variation within the proteome of these extremophiles. We found that another copy, LeuRS-F, contains canonical active sites for aminoacylation and editing. Biochemical and genetic analyses of the paralogs within Sulfolobus islandicus supported the hypothesis that LeuRS-F, but not LeuRS-I, functions as an essential tRNA synthetase that accurately charges leucine to tRNALeu for protein translation. Although LeuRS-I was not essential, its expression clearly supported optimal S. islandicus growth.

These enzymes covalently attach a specific amino acid to their cognate transfer RNA (tRNA). Subsequently, with the aid of an elongation factor, the aminoacylated (charged) tRNA is then delivered to the ribosome, where the amino acid is incorporated into a nascent polypeptide chain.

Aminoacylation of tRNA is catalyzed by the aaRSs in two steps. First, an amino acid is activated in an ATP-dependent fashion to generate an aminoacyl-adenylate intermediate concomitant with pyrophosphate release. In the second step, the activated amino acid is transferred to the 3′-adenosine end of an acceptor tRNA with release of AMP. Each standard amino acid is activated by one of the 20 aaRSs. Recognition of cognate tRNA occurs via a set of identity determinants that link the amino acid to the correct anticodon (2Giegé R. Jühling F. Pütz J. Stadler P. Sauter C. Florentz C.

The precision of tRNA charging is fundamental to accurate decoding of the genetic code. Faithful protein synthesis requires aaRSs to choose their cognate amino acid from a pool of structurally and chemically similar amino acids (3Fersht A.R. Dingwall C.

However, rather than being lethal, it was suggested that purposeful mistranslation in Mycoplasma could be adaptive, leading to antigen diversity and allowing this parasite to modulate its interactions with host defense systems (19Li L.

Herein, using bioinformatic approaches, we searched for other examples, particularly for LeuRS, that might have adapted similarly, compared with Mycoplasma, in compromising mechanisms of fidelity. Significantly, we discovered that each member of the archaeal family Sulfolobaceae, within the phylum Crenarchaeota, contains a LeuRS (LeuRS-I) that has a disrupted CP1 editing domain (Fig. 1). Surprisingly, LeuRS-I appears to be a duplication of a second LeuRS (LeuRS-F) that possesses canonical aminoacylation and CP1 editing domains. The CP1 domains of LeuRS were searched to identify unusual sequences that might compromise or eliminate its hydrolytic editing activity. Bioinformatic analysis of 39 unique strains within the Sulfolobaceae revealed two distinct isoforms that occupy and cluster within distinct branches of a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1). Pairs of the full-length LeuRS enzymes within a given organism maintain ˜40% amino acid sequence identity. However, depending upon the particular genera and species, pairwise alignments among one of the isoforms (Fig. 1, denoted LeuRS-F in orange) reveal conservation of 59–69% amino acid sequence identity, whereas the second isoform (Fig. 1, denoted LeuRS-I in blue) preserves 48–53% identity. One of the LeuRS variants, LeuRS-F, contained canonical sequences within the CP1 editing domain that would be expected to confer hydrolytic activity to maintain fidelity. In contrast, the second isoform, LeuRS-I, has critical substitutions of key amino acids that define the CP1 editing active site (Fig. 2). Within each species investigated, the universal aspartic acid essential to post-transfer editing (9Lincecum T.L. Tukalo M. Yaremchuk A. Mursinna R.S. Williams A.M. Sproat B.S. Van Den Eynde W.

We hypothesized that this would render the Sulfolobaceae LeuRS-I editing deficient. Each of the Sulfolobus islandicus and Sulfolobus solfataricus LeuRS-I's are also missing two additional residues important for post-transfer editing.

A conserved threonine within Escherichia coli leucyl-tRNA synthetase prevents hydrolytic editing of leucyl-tRNALeu.Biochemistry. 2001; 40 (11331000): 5376-538110.1021/bi002915wCrossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 22Tukalo M.

Biol. 2005; 12 (16155583): 923-93010.1038/nsmb986Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Mutation of the conserved threonine that forms the bottom of this binding pocket (Escherichia coli Thr-252) to alanine relaxes specificity of the CP1 editing site, allowing hydrolysis of correctly charged Leu-tRNALeu (21Mursinna R.S. Lincecum Jr., T.L. Martinis S.A. A conserved threonine within Escherichia coli leucyl-tRNA synthetase prevents hydrolytic editing of leucyl-tRNALeu.Biochemistry. 2001; 40 (11331000): 5376-538110.1021/bi002915wCrossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In the case of LeuRS-I, the position of this conserved threonine residue is occupied by a bulkier leucine (Leu-227, Fig. 2A). When bulkier residues such as leucine, phenylalanine, or tyrosine replace this threonine, mischarged amino acids are blocked from the editing site and tRNALeu is stably aminoacylated with isoleucine and valine (23Mursinna R.S. Martinis S.A. Rational design to block amino acid editing of a tRNA synthetase.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124 (12071734): 7286-728710.1021/ja025879sCrossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 24Tang Y.

Moreover, it was hypothesized, and later shown, that Val-338 from E. coli LeuRS confers specificity to the CP1 domain (9Lincecum T.L. Tukalo M. Yaremchuk A. Mursinna R.S. Williams A.M. Sproat B.S.

Mutating this residue to a bulkier phenylalanine disrupted E. coli LeuRS editing of Ile-tRNALeu (25Zhai Y. Nawaz M.H. Lee K.W. Kirkbride E. Briggs J.M. Martinis S.A. Modulation of substrate specificity within the amino acid editing site of leucyl-tRNA synthetase.Biochemistry. 2007; 46 (17311409): 3331-333710.1021/bi061778lCrossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In S. islandicus and S. solfataricus LeuRS-I, E. coli Val-388 corresponds to a tyrosine (Tyr-313) (Fig. 2A). In concert with the substitution of the universally conserved aspartic acid, we hypothesize that these two mutations will abolish the editing capabilities of LeuRS-I. The sequences of the Sulfolobaceae LeuRS isoforms were compared with Pyrococcus horikoshii LeuRS, which is the closest relative that has a solved crystal structure (26Fukunaga R. Yokoyama S. Aminoacylation complex structures of leucyl-tRNA synthetase and tRNALeu reveal two modes of discriminator-base recognition.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Crystal structure of leucyl-tRNA synthetase from the archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii reveals a novel editing domain orientation.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346 (15663927): 57-7110.1016/j.jmb.2004.11.060Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). There were no gross deletions, insertions, or rearrangements of domains suggesting that the Sulfolobaceae LeuRSs resemble their archaeal/eukaryal counterparts (Fig. 2B). However, the LeuRS C-terminal domains are significantly diverged with sequence identities that approached 20%. For example, whereas the C-terminal domain of S. islandicus LeuRS-F (residues 781–944) has a predicted pI of 8.6, its counterpart in LeuRS-I(772–934) is very acidic with a pI of 5.0. This results in an overall predicted pI for LeuRS-F and LeuRS-I of 7.1 and 5.6, respectively (Fig. 2B). Based on previous experiments that substituted the universally conserved aspartic acid in the CP1 editing domain of LeuRS, we hypothesized that a natural histidine substitution in Sulfolobaceae LeuRS-I would disable its mechanism to clear mischarged tRNALeu. Using E. coli LeuRS as a model, we mutated the universally conserved aspartic acid to histidine to test if editing activity was inactivated. The mutant E. coli LeuRS-D345H was recombinantly expressed and affinity-purified via its N-terminal His6 tag. The purified mutant enzyme aminoacylated E. coli tRNALeu to similar levels as WT E. coli LeuRS (data not shown). We generated mischarged E. coli Ile-tRNALeu using editing-defective E. coli LeuRS-Y330A/D342A/D345A (28Zhai Y. Martinis S.A. Two conserved threonines collaborate in the Escherichia coli leucyl-tRNA synthetase amino acid editing mechanism.Biochemistry. 2005; 44 (16300391): 15437-1544310.1021/bi0514461Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The mischarged tRNA was isolated and used to test if editing activity was inactivated with E. coli LeuRS-D345H. Compared with WT E. coli LeuRS, the mutant E. coli LeuRS-D345H's deacylation activity was significantly decreased (Fig. 3). As would be expected, E. coli LeuRS-D345H also produced mischarged Ile-tRNALeu (data not shown). Together, these results support that LeuRS-I, which has the same amino acid substitution, is deficient in editing. We hypothesized that LeuRS-I generated statistical mutations similar to Mycoplasma LeuRS that is missing its CP1 domain (19Li L. Boniecki M.T. Jaffe J.D. Imai B.S. Yau P.M. Luthey-Schulten Z.A. Martinis S.A. Naturally occurring aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases editing-domain mutations that cause mistranslation in Mycoplasma parasites.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108 (21606343): 9378-938310.1073/pnas.1016460108Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The genes for S. islandicus LeuRS-F and LeuRS-I were cloned and expressed as fusions with N-terminal His6 tags. Preliminary experiments determined that whereas LeuRS-F possessed minimal aminoacylation activity at ambient temperatures below 40 °C, LeuRS-I lacked any measurable activity. Because Sulfolobus species reside in fluctuating acidic environments at extreme temperatures, we screened for conditions to maximize activity using LeuRS-F. LeuRS-F aminoacylated in vitro transcribed S. islandicus tRNALeu optimally at 55 °C and pH 6.5. Interestingly, the intracellular pH of the related Sulfolobus acidocaldairus is 6.5 (29Anemüller S. Schäfer G. Cytochrome aa3 from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius: a single-subunit, quinol-oxidizing archaebacterial terminal oxidase.Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191 (2166661): 297-30510.1111/j.1432-1033.1990.tb19123.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although LeuRS-F exhibited robust charging activity at elevated temperature and under acidic conditions, LeuRS-I still failed to aminoacylate this S. islandicus in vitro transcribed tRNALeu substrate (Fig. 4A). We further investigated whether this LeuRS paralog could bind tRNALeu. Quenching of LeuRS intrinsic fluorescence was measured with increasing concentrations of in vitro transcribed tRNALeu-UAG. LeuRS-F was found to bind in vitro transcribed tRNALeu with an apparent affinity of 27.1 ± 5.1 μm (Fig. 4B). At 75 μm tRNA, LeuRS-F is ˜85% bound. Surprisingly, LeuRS-I also bound in vitro transcribed tRNALeu with an apparent affinity of 31.4 ± 2.5 μm (Fig. 4B) and was 74% bound in the presence of 75 μm tRNALeu-UAG. These binding affinities are up to 10-fold lower than those reported for the archaeal LeuRS enzymes in the haloalkaliphile Natrialba magadii (30Fang Z.P. Wang M. Ruan Z.R. Tan M. Liu R.J. Zhou M. Zhou X.L. Wang E.D. Coexistence of bacterial leucyl-tRNA synthetases with archaeal tRNA binding domains that distinguish tRNALeu in the archaeal mode.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (24500203): 5109-512410.1093/nar/gku108Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It is possible the differences are a result of the technique utilized to obtain them, or that these unusual S. islandicus aaRSs require leucine and/or ATP to achieve optimal tRNA binding. Although the measured binding affinities are lower than expected for synthetase-tRNA interactions, the affinities for LeuRS-F and LeuRS-I are similar, suggesting LeuRS-I does not have a tRNA-binding defect. Because LeuRS-I retains tRNA-binding activity, it is possible that LeuRS-I aminoacylates a novel tRNA or even a protein. It is also possible that the tRNA-bound LeuRS-I functions outside of translation. Key motifs within the Class I synthetase core of LeuRS-I appear to be intact with both HIGH and KMSKS signature sequences being maintained for amino acid activation. Using pyrophosphate exchange assays, we tested whether the recombinant LeuRS isoforms from S. islandicus could activate leucine. Using the optimal conditions of 55 °C and pH 6.5 that were established for aminoacylation by LeuRS-F, we determined that LeuRS-I activates leucine, albeit at a lower efficiency than LeuRS-F (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, activation of noncognate amino acids were similar for LeuRS-F and LeuRS-I (data not shown). LeuRS-I generated the adenylates of both isoleucine and norvaline, albeit to a much lesser extent than leucine. Therefore, even at the conditions where LeuRS-I failed to aminoacylate S. islandicus in vitro transcribed tRNALeu, it is clear that this LeuRS-like protein maintains the capacity to be enzymatically active. Given the enzyme’s strong preference for leucine compared with other amino acids, it is possible that leucine activation is required for a noncanonical activity, to aminoacylate a novel tRNA or protein. Because LeuRS-I failed to aminoacylate S. islandicus in vitro transcribed tRNALeu, we wondered if its gene was defunct and even expressed in S. islandicus. Therefore, as a first step, we probed whether the duplicated leuRS genes are actively transcribed into mRNA. S. islandicus M.16.4 (31Reno M.L. Held N.L. Fields C.J. Burke P.V. Whitaker R.J. Biogeography of the Sulfolobus islandicus pan-genome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Total RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed into a cDNA library. Using gene-specific primers and the cDNA as a template, PCR yielded products of the expected size confirming that both leuRS-F and leuRS-I are actively transcribed (Fig. 5A). We then asked whether one or both of these LeuRS paralogs were essential to the viability of S. islandicus. To address this question, we sought to generate knockout strains of both leuRS-F and leuRS-I. Because S. islandicus serves as a model organism for DNA replication, repair, and recombination within the Crenarchaeota, many genetic systems for in vivo analysis have been developed (see reviews in Refs. 32She Q.

It is applied for the first time in the study to control the optimal pressure of hydrogen natural gas mixture in an inclined pipeline. The solution to the flow problem is first validated with existing results using the Taylor series approximation, regression analysis and the Runge-Kutta method combined. The optimal pressure is then determined using ZGC where the optimal set points are calculated without having to solve the non-linear system of equations associated with the standard optimization problem. It is shown that the mass ratio is the more effective parameter compared to the initial pressure in controlling the maximum variation of pressure in a gas pipeline."
https://openalex.org/W3008862349,"The visual system optimizes its functioning for a given environment through processes collectively called adaptation. It is currently unknown, however, whether adaptation is affected by the particular task the observer performs within that environment. Two experiments tested whether this is the case. Observers adapted to high contrast grating patterns, and the decay of adaptation was measured using a version of the tilt-aftereffect, while they performed two different secondary tasks. One task involved judging the luminance of a small circular spot at fixation, and was expected to be unaffected by adaptation. The other secondary task involved judging a low contrast grating, and adaptation was expected to make this task difficult by reducing the visibility of the grating. Identical displays containing both a fixation spot and a grating were used for both tasks. Tilt-aftereffects were smaller when subjects concurrently performed the grating task than when they performed the fixation task. These results suggest that the control of adaptation, in this case its decay, is sensitive to the nature of the task the observer is performing. Adaptation may attempt to optimize vision with respect to many different criteria simultaneously; task is likely one of the criteria included in this process."

However, the evidence relating to women with diabetes in pregnancy is limited. Clinical guidelines for antenatal corticosteroid administration recommend that women with diabetes in pregnancy are treated in the same way as women without diabetes, but there are no recent descriptions of whether contemporary practice complies with this guidance. This study is a retrospective review of antenatal corticosteroid administration at a New Zealand tertiary hospital in women with diabetes in pregnancy. We found that in this cohort, for both an initial course at less than 35 weeks' gestation and repeat courses at less than 33 weeks', the administration of antenatal corticosteroid to women with diabetes in pregnancy is largely consistent with current Australian and New Zealand recommendations. However, almost 25% of women received their last dose of antenatal corticosteroid at or beyond the latest recommended gestation of 35 weeks' gestation. Pre-existing diabetes and planned caesarean section were independently associated with an increased rate of antenatal corticosteroid administration. We conclude that diabetes in pregnancy does not appear to be a deterrent to antenatal corticosteroid administration. The high rates of administration at gestations beyond recommendations, despite the lack of evidence of benefit in this group of women, highlights the need for further research into the risks and benefits of antenatal corticosteroid administration to women with diabetes in pregnancy, particularly in the late preterm and early term periods."
