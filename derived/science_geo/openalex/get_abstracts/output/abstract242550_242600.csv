https://openalex.org/W2114803986,"The positioning of nucleosomes along chromatin has been implicated in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells, because packaging DNA into nucleosomes affects sequence accessibility. We developed a tiled microarray approach to identify at high resolution the translational positions of 2278 nucleosomes over 482 kilobases of Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA, including almost all of chromosome III and 223 additional regulatory regions. The majority of the nucleosomes identified were well-positioned. We found a stereotyped chromatin organization at Pol II promoters consisting of a nucleosome-free region approximately 200 base pairs upstream of the start codon flanked on both sides by positioned nucleosomes. The nucleosome-free sequences were evolutionarily conserved and were enriched in poly-deoxyadenosine or poly-deoxythymidine sequences. Most occupied transcription factor binding motifs were devoid of nucleosomes, strongly suggesting that nucleosome positioning is a global determinant of transcription factor access."

We used stable carbon isotopic values of di-unsaturated alkenones extracted from deep sea cores to reconstruct pCO2 from the middle Eocene to the late Oligocene (approximately 45 to 25 million years ago). Our results demonstrate that pCO2 ranged between 1000 to 1500 parts per million by volume in the middle to late Eocene, then decreased in several steps during the Oligocene, and reached modern levels by the latest Oligocene. The fall in pCO2 likely allowed for a critical expansion of ice sheets on Antarctica and promoted conditions that forced the onset of terrestrial C4 photosynthesis."

The mid-infrared spectrum of bulk aqueous acid, for example, is too diffuse to establish the roles of the putative Eigen (H 3 O + ) and Zundel (H 5 O 2 + ) ion cores. To expose the local environment of the excess charge, we report how the vibrational spectrum of protonated water clusters evolves in the size range from 2 to 11 water molecules. Signature bands indicating embedded Eigen or Zundel limiting forms are observed in all of the spectra with the exception of the three- and five-membered clusters. These unique species display bands appearing at intermediate energies, reflecting asymmetric solvation of the core ion. Taken together, the data reveal the pronounced spectral impact of subtle changes in the hydration environment."
https://openalex.org/W2018196751,"Hippocampal place cells are a model system of how the brain constructs cognitive representations and of how these representations support complex behavior, learning, and memory. There is, however, a lack of detailed knowledge about the properties of hippocampal afferents. We recorded multiple single units from the hippocampus and the medial and lateral entorhinal areas of behaving rats. Although many medial entorhinal neurons had highly specific place fields, lateral entorhinal neurons displayed weak spatial specificity. This finding demonstrates a fundamental dissociation between the information conveyed to the hippocampus by its major input streams, with spatial information represented by the medial and nonspatial information represented by the lateral entorhinal cortex."

This difference indicates that most (70 to 95%) of Earth's mantle is compositionally similar to the incompatible element–depleted source of mid-ocean ridge basalts, possibly as a result of a global differentiation 4.53 billion years ago (Ga), within 30 million years of Earth's formation. The complementary enriched reservoir has never been sampled and is probably located at the base of the mantle. These data influence models of Earth's compositional structure and require revision of the timing of global differentiation on Earth's Moon and Mars."
https://openalex.org/W2161577497,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play key roles in activating immune responses during infection. The human TLR3 ectodomain structure at 2.1 angstroms reveals a large horseshoe-shaped solenoid assembled from 23 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). Asparagines conserved in the 24-residue LRR motif contribute extensive hydrogen-bonding networks for solenoid stabilization. TLR3 is largely masked by carbohydrate, but one face is glycosylation-free, which suggests its potential role in ligand binding and oligomerization. Highly conserved surface residues and a TLR3-specific LRR insertion form a homodimer interface in the crystal, whereas two patches of positively charged residues and a second insertion would provide an appropriate binding site for double-stranded RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2010248837,"Rhizobial Nod factors induce in their legume hosts the expression of many genes and set in motion developmental processes leading to root nodule formation. Here we report the identification of the Medicago GRAS-type protein Nodulation signaling pathway 1 (NSP1), which is essential for all known Nod factor–induced changes in gene expression. NSP1 is constitutively expressed, and so it acts as a primary transcriptional regulator mediating all known Nod factor–induced transcriptional responses, and therefore, we named it a Nod factor response factor."
https://openalex.org/W2127920639,"Rhizobial bacteria enter a symbiotic interaction with legumes, activating diverse responses in roots through the lipochito oligosaccharide signaling molecule Nod factor. Here, we show that NSP2 from Medicago truncatula encodes a GRAS protein essential for Nod-factor signaling. NSP2 functions downstream of Nod-factor-induced calcium spiking and a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. We show that NSP2-GFP expressed from a constitutive promoter is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum/nuclear envelope and relocalizes to the nucleus after Nod-factor elicitation. This work provides evidence that a GRAS protein transduces calcium signals in plants and provides a possible regulator of Nod-factor-inducible gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1542533195,"The marked increase in land-falling hurricanes in Florida and Japan in 2004 has raised questions about whether global warming is playing a role. In his Perspective,
 Trenberth
 explains that the observational hurricane record reveals large natural variability from El NiA±o and on multidecadal time scales, and that trends are therefore relatively small. However, sea surface temperatures are rising and atmospheric water vapor is increasing. These factors are potentially enhancing tropical convection, including thunderstorms, and the development of tropical storms. These changes are expected to increase hurricane intensity and rainfall, but the effect on hurricane numbers and tracks remains unclear."
https://openalex.org/W2076938907,"Declining salinities signify that large amounts of fresh water have been added to the northern North Atlantic Ocean since the mid-1960s. We estimate that the Nordic Seas and Subpolar Basins were diluted by an extra 19,000 ± 5000 cubic kilometers of freshwater input between 1965 and 1995. Fully half of that additional fresh water—about 10,000 cubic kilometers—infiltrated the system in the late 1960s at an approximate rate of 2000 cubic kilometers per year. Patterns of freshwater accumulation observed in the Nordic Seas suggest a century time scale to reach freshening thresholds critical to that portion of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation."
https://openalex.org/W2093175831,"Oxidized lipids and inflammatory cytokines are believed to play a causal role in atherosclerosis through the regulation of gene expression in macrophages and other cells. Previous work has implicated the nuclear receptors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor and liver X receptor in the control of lipid-dependent gene expression and inflammation. Here we demonstrate that expression of a third group of nuclear receptors, the NR4A ligand-independent orphan receptors, is highly inducible in macrophages by diverse inflammatory stimuli. Treatment of macrophages with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), cytokines, or oxidized lipids triggers the transcriptional induction of Nur77 (NR4A1), Nurr1 (NR4A2), and NOR1 (NR4A3) expression. Several lines of evidence point to the NF-κB signaling pathway as a principal mediator of inducible NR4A expression in macrophages. Analysis of the murine and human Nur77 promoters revealed two highly conserved NF-κB response elements. Mutation of these elements inhibited LPS-dependent expression of the Nur77 promoter in transient transfection assays. Furthermore, induction of Nur77 expression by LPS was severely compromised in fibroblasts lacking the three NF-κB subunits, Nfkb1, c-Rel, and RelA. Consistent with its ability to be induced by oxidized lipids, Nur77 was expressed in macrophages within human atherosclerotic lesions. These results identified NR4A nuclear receptors as potential transcriptional mediators of inflammatory signals in activated macrophages.

These results identified NR4A nuclear receptors as potential transcriptional mediators of inflammatory signals in activated macrophages. Atherosclerosis can be viewed as both a disorder of lipid metabolism and a chronic inflammatory disease. Monocytes/macrophages play a key role in the disease from both a metabolic and inflammatory standpoint. In the early stages, monocytes are recruited into the arterial wall, differentiate into tissue macrophages, and take up oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL). 1The abbreviations used are: oxLDL, oxidized low density lipoprotein; LDL, low density lipoprotein; acLDL, acetylated LDL; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; LXR, liver X receptor; M-CSF, macrophage colony-stimulating factor; GM-CSF, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; rh, recombinant human; IL, interleukin; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; HC, hydroxycholesterol. These lipid-loaded macrophages or “foam cells” establish a chronic inflammatory process together with Th1 and Th2 cells through the production of inflammatory molecules, cytokines, and extracellular matrix-degrading enzymes. Delineating the transcriptional processes that regulate macrophage gene expression in response to oxidized lipids and inflammatory stimuli is essential for our understanding of atherogenesis. Nuclear hormone receptors are ligand-activated transcription factors involved in diverse physiological functions. Previous work has identified the PPAR and LXR nuclear receptor subfamilies as modulators of lipid metabolic and inflammatory gene expression in cells of the artery wall (1Evans R.M. Barish G.D. Wang Y.X. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar, 2Tontonoz P. Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Macrophage lipid loading has been shown to lead to the transcriptional activation of PPARs and LXRs by providing the cell with oxidized fatty acid and oxysterol ligands for the receptors (2Tontonoz P.

The role of other orphan nuclear receptors in the control of macrophage gene expression is not well understood. The NR4A subfamily of nuclear receptors were first identified as early response genes for growth factors (8Milbrandt J.

Science. 1997; 276: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). All three proteins bind to a consensus NBRE (NGF-IB response element) sequence (AAAGGTCA) as monomers or to a palindromic NurRE sequence (TGATATTTX6AAATGCCA) as homodimers (15Philips A. Lesage S. Gingras R. Maira M.H. Gauthier Y. Hugo P. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5946-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In addition, both Nur77 and Nurr1 heterodimerize with RXR and mediate responses to retinoids (16Wallen-Mackenzie A. Mata de Urquiza A. Petersson S. Rodriguez F.J. Friling S. Wagner J. Ordentlich P. Lengqvist J. Heyman R.A. Arenas E. Perlmann T. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 3036-3047Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The function of NR4A receptors in macrophages and their potential relevance to atherogenic inflammation is unknown. Here we demonstrate that the NR4A nuclear receptors are potently induced by diverse inflammatory stimuli in macrophages. Evidence points to the NF-κB signaling pathway as a principal regulator of inducible NR4A expression. We propose that these receptors may be important mediators of inflammatory signaling in the artery wall. Cell Culture and Reagents—THP-1 cells (ATCC) were cultured in RPMI containing 10% FBS (Cellgro). HEK-293T and RAW264.7 cells were also obtained from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS. Wild type and nfkb1-/-c-rel-/-relA-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone). Mouse primary peritoneal macrophages and bone marrow-derived macrophages were prepared and cultured as described (17Castrillo A. Joseph S.B. Marathe C. Mangelsdorf D.J. Tontonoz P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10443-10449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Human monocyte-derived macrophages were obtained from the UCLA Lipid Core Facility. nfkb1-/-c-rel-/-relA-/- MEFs were generated from 12.5-day embryos resulting from nfkb1-/-c-rel-/-relA+/- matings. Mice with each of these individually targeted mutations have been described previously (18Sha W.C. Liou H.C. Tuomanen E.I. Baltimore D.

Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% bovine calf serum and immortalized by repeated passage according to the 3T3 procedure (21Aaronson S.A. Todaro G.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1968; 72: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). These cells are deficient in all three proteins associated with the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway, and they do not show detectable kB site binding activity in response to NF-κB inducing stimuli. LPS, oxidized lipid, and cytokine treatments of all cell types were carried out in media containing 1% FBS. The reagents used were: LPS (Sigma), rhIL-4 (204-ML), rhIL-6 (206-IL), rhM-CSF (216-MC), and rhGM-CSF (215-GM, R&D Systems), vitamin D3 (BIOMOL, DM-200), TPA (Calbiochem, 524400), recombinant murine TNFα (315-01A) and rhTNFα (Peprotech, 300-01A), rhIFNγ (Endogen), rhIL-1β (BD Pharmingen), LDL (RP-032), acetylated LDL (acLDL; RP-045), and oxLDL (Intracel, RP-047), 20(S),22(R),25,7β-hydroxycholesterols (Sigma), and SB203580, PD98059, MG-132, and LY294002 (Calbiochem). Transfections—Deletions of the mouse Nur77 promoter were generated by PCR and cloned into the HindIII/XhoI site of the pGL3 basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega). Two nucleotides of the NF-κB sites in Nur77 promoter were mutated using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Transient transfection of mouse Nur77 promoters into RAW264.7 cells was performed in triplicate as described (17Castrillo A. Joseph S.B. Marathe C. Mangelsdorf D.J. Tontonoz P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10443-10449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. Luciferase activity was normalized to internal β-galactosidase control. RNA and Protein Analysis—Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Procedures for Northern blotting and real-time quantitative PCR RNA analysis, as well as Western blotting for protein analysis have been described previously (17Castrillo A. Joseph S.B. Marathe C. Mangelsdorf D.J. Tontonoz P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10443-10449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The antibodies used were: R-α-IκBα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, c-21), R-α-Nur77 (Santa Cruz, M-210), R-α-Nur77/Nurr1/NOR1 (Santa Cruz, E-20), R-α-HMG-1 (BD Pharmingen, 556528), and goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz, sc-2301). The primer sequences used for real-time PCR SYBR Green assays were: Nur77, forward 5′-ATGCCTCCCCTACCAATCTTC-3′, reverse 5′-CACCAGTTCCTGGAACTTGGA-3′; Nurr1, forward 5′-TCACCTCCGGTGAGTCTGATC-3′, reverse 5′-TGCTGGATATGTTGGGTATCATCT-3′; NOR1, forward 5′-CGCCGAAACCGATGTCA-3′, reverse 5′-TGTACGCACAACTTCCTTAACCA-3′. Immunohistochemistry—RAW cells and HEK-293T cells were cultured in 4-well chamber slides and transfected with Nur77 or LacZ vector using Lipofectamine 2000. 24 h later, the cells were fixed with 3.8% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were stained with anti-Nur77 antibody (Santa Cruz, M-210), followed by rhodamine-conjugated or Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probe) in 10% fetal calf serum in PBS. RAW cells were treated with 500 ng/ml LPS for 12 h and then double stained with Nur77 antibody (Santa Cruz, M-210) and phycoerythrin-conjugated rat anti-mouse F4/80 (Serotec). Chamber slides were mounted in fluorescence mount with 4′,6′-diamidino-phenylindole (Vector). For immunohistochemical analysis of Nur77 in human atherosclerotic lesions, a segment of human left coronary artery containing atherosclerotic plaques was harvested from a patient at autopsy, snap-frozen, and stored at -80 °C. Frozen sections (6 μm) were fixed for 5 min in cold acetone and processed for immunohistochemical staining. After three washes with ice-cold PBS, the cells were blocked with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing non-immune goat serum. For Nur77 staining, frozen sections were incubated with rabbit anti-Nur77 antibody (Santa Cruz, M-210) followed by Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes). CD68 staining was performed with an anti-human CD68 monoclonal antibody (Dako) followed by Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories). Staining with nonimmune rabbit IgG (Dako) served as a negative control. In an effort to identify transcription factors involved in responses to oxidized lipids and inflammatory mediators, we screened expression of a panel of nuclear receptors in macrophages treated with a variety of stimuli. Expression of NOR1 (NR4A3) was found to be highly induced in the human monocytic cell line THP-1 in response to treatment with TPA or LPS (Fig. 1A) and the inflammatory cytokines TNFα, IFNγ, and IL-1β (Fig. 1B). NOR1 was also slightly up-regulated by M-CSF and GM-CSF in THP-1 cells. Other activators such as the retinoic acid receptor agonist AM580 or vitamin D3 had no effect. LPS also stimulated expression of the three NR4A family members in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (Fig. 1C). We further explored the effect of LPS on expression of NR4A receptors in THP-1 cells over the time course of 1 to 24 h (Fig. 1D). All three receptors were rapidly induced (after 1 h) by LPS. Interestingly, whereas expression of Nur77 and Nurr1 mRNA decreased after early induction, NOR1 mRNA increased over the course of 24 h in these cells. Note that the absolute level of Nurr1 expression in macrophages was significantly lower than that of Nur77 and NOR1 (Fig. 1D and data not shown). We next investigated the regulation of NR4A receptors in murine macrophages by LPS and TNFα. A time course of LPS treatment of thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 1E) or RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 1F) revealed that Nur77 and NOR1 were potently induced at early time points, with RNA levels peaking at 1 and 2 h post-treatment, respectively. A similar pattern was also observed in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (data not shown). Consistent with the results obtained in human THP-1 cells, the cytokine TNFα also induced Nur77 expression in murine RAW macrophages (Fig. 1G). Next we examined macrophage NR4A protein expression in response to LPS. Western blot analysis using an antibody that recognizes all three NR4A receptors showed that NR4A protein accumulated in the nucleus as early as 1 h after stimulation and remained elevated over the 24-h time course (Fig. 2A). IκBα protein expression was monitored as a control. As expected, IκBα levels in the cytoplasm decreased early due to degradation but then recovered. Nur77 protein expression was further studied using immunofluorescence microscopy. The specificity of our Nur77 antibody was confirmed using 293T cells that had been transfected with an expression plasmid for Nur77 or LacZ. Strong nuclear staining was observed only in Nur77-transfected cells (Fig. 2B). Nuclear expression of Nur77 protein in RAW264.7 macrophages was confirmed by co-staining with antibodies to Nur77 and the macrophage marker F4/80 (Fig. 2C). Finally, treatment of RAW264.7 macrophages with LPS led to a marked increase in nuclear Nur77 protein expression (Fig. 2D). To identify the upstream signaling pathways that mediate induction of Nur77 in response to LPS, we pre-incubated RAW cells with specific signaling pathway inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 3A, inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway by SB203580 or the MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) pathway by PD98059 had no effect on Nur77 induction at this time point (1 h). LY294002, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, slightly enhanced Nur77 induction. By contrast, the proteosome inhibitor MG-132 (which blocks IκB degradation and thereby inhibits NF-κB signaling) strongly inhibited the induction of Nur77 by LPS (Fig. 3A). To further explore the signaling pathway controlling macrophage Nur77 expression, the human and mouse Nur77 promoters were compared. These promoters share a high degree of sequence identity and contain well conserved binding sites for NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors (Fig. 3B). Because LPS induction of Nur77 expression is very rapid, we focused our studies on the conserved NF-κB sites. NF-κB is a principal transcription factor involved in response to LPS and is known to induce gene expression very rapidly upon activation. Transient transfections into RAW macrophages were carried out using reporter constructs containing serial deletions of the Nur77 promoter. These studies confirmed the importance of the NF-κB elements, as their deletion resulted in a 50-60% reduction of reporter activity (Fig. 3C). Note that the difference between activity of -1043 and -535 constructs was consistent among multiple independent experiments, suggesting the possible presence of an inhibitory element between -1043 and -535. When the NF-κB sites were mutated alone or together, induction of Nur77 promoter activity by LPS (TLR4 ligand), poly(I:C) (TLR3 ligand), or lipoteichoic acid (LTA) (TLR2 ligand) was greatly reduced (Fig. 3D). To definitively address the role of NF-κB signaling in Nur77 promoter regulation, we employed MEFs lacking expression of the three NF-κB subunits essential for the classical NF-κB pathway (nfkb1-/-c-rel-/-relA-/-). 2A. Hoffmann, manuscript in preparation. These cells show no detectable κB site binding activity in response to NF-κB-inducing stimuli (data not shown). As expected, the induction of IκBα by LPS was abolished in these cells (Fig. 4). The induction of Nur77 by LPS was also severely compromised in nfkb1-/-c-rel-/-relA-/- cells, confirming the central role of the NF-κB pathway in this response. Similar impaired induction of NOR1 was also observed in nfkb1-/-c-rel-/-relA-/- cells (data not shown). Considerable evidence has linked oxidized lipids to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. We therefore explored the effect of oxLDL and various oxysterols on macrophage expression of NR4A receptors. Note that under the conditions used here, oxidized lipids did not induce obvious apoptosis in treated cells (data not shown). When THP-1 cells were treated with different forms of LDL for 48 h, a robust induction of NOR1 and Nur77 was observed in response to oxLDL but not to native LDL or acLDL (Fig. 5A). We also observed a strong induction of NR4A receptor expression by 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) and 7β-cholesterol. These oxysterols have been reported to be major species present in human atherosclerotic plaques and are atherogenic in animal models (22Brown A.J. Jessup W. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 142: 1-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar, 23Imai H. Werthessen N.T. Subramanyam V. LeQuesne P.W. Soloway A.H. Kanisawa M.

Oxysterols also induced the expression of members of the NR4A family in TPA-differentiated THP-1 cells (Fig. 5B), as well as in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (Fig. 5C). Some cell type specificity in the response to oxysterols was noted. For example, although Nur77 was consistently induced in all cell types, NOR1 was induced in THP-1 cells but not human monocyte-derived macrophages. The ability of oxidized lipids to activate NR4A expression did not correlate with their ability to activate PPAR or LXR. For example, the specificity of oxidized lipid induction of NOR1 in THP-1 macrophages was distinct from ABCA1 induction (Fig. 5D). Whereas oxLDL induced expression of both genes, 25-HC was the most effective inducer of NOR1, and the LXR agonist 22(R)-HC was the most effective inducer of ABCA1. Furthermore, synthetic high affinity ligands for PPARγ (GW7845, 1 μm) or LXR (GW3965, 1 μm) did not induce NR4A expression (data not shown), indicating that oxidized lipids regulate NR4A receptor expression through an LXR- and PPAR-independent mechanism. Finally, to address whether transcriptional regulation by NR4A receptors might be relevant to artery wall macrophages, we examined Nur77 expression in human coronary artery atherosclerotic lesions. As shown in Fig. 6A, Nur77 antibody showed positive staining throughout the lesion. This pattern of expression was overlapping with that of the macrophage-specific marker CD68 (Fig. 6B). Co-staining with antibodies to both Nur77 and CD68 confirmed macrophage expression of Nur77 (Fig. 6C and shown at higher magnification in Fig. 6E). However, Nur77 expression was not macrophage-specific. Several other cell types within the lesion, notably smooth muscle cells, also expressed Nur77 (Fig. 6C). The NR4A proteins are among the most evolutionarily ancient nuclear receptors. Higher eukaryotes possess three closely related receptors, Nur77, Nurr1, and NOR1, whereas Drosophila has a single homolog, DHR38. Recent structural studies have shown that the ligand binding domains of these receptors do not contain a pocket large enough to support the binding of a small molecule (25Wang Z. Benoit G. Liu J. Prasad S. Aarnisalo P. Liu X. Xu H. Walker N.P. Perlmann T. Nature. 2003; 423: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 26Baker K.D. Shewchuk L.M. Kozlova T. Makishima M. Hassell A. Wisely B. Caravella J.A. Lambert M.H. Reinking J.L. Krause H. Thummel C.S. Willson T.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Cell. 2003; 113: 731-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Thus, these proteins appear to be ligand-independent transcription factors for which activity is controlled at the level of protein expression and/or post-translational modification. Indeed, the mammalian NR4A receptors were identified originally as early response genes induced by growth factors such as nerve growth factor (NGF) (8Milbrandt J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 183-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Previous studies of Nur77 and NOR1 have focused primarily on their roles in T cell apoptosis (11Winoto A. Littman D.R. Cell. 2002; 109: S57-S66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), whereas Nurr1 has been implicated in the development of dopaminergic neurons (14Zetterstrom R.H. Solomin L. Jansson L. Hoffer B.J. Olson L. Perlmann T. Science. 1997; 276: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). The function of these receptors in other cell types, however, is poorly understood. In the present work we have shown that expression of Nur77, NOR1, and Nurr1 is highly inducible in macrophages by diverse inflammatory stimuli, including cytokines, TLR ligands, and oxidized lipids. These observations point to a previously unrecognized role for NR4A receptors in macrophage inflammatory responses. Previous work has identified the PPARs and LXRs as nuclear receptors responsive to oxidized lipids present in the atherosclerotic artery wall. Both PPARγ and LXRα are induced during macrophage differentiation, and their transcriptional activity is activated by the binding of specific oxidized lipids. Oxidized fatty acids such as 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid are direct ligands for PPARγ, whereas oxysterols are direct ligands for LXRs (2Tontonoz P. Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The relevance of these observations for the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis is underscored by the observations that synthetic ligands for PPARγ or LXR inhibit the development of atherosclerosis in mice (6Li A.C. Brown K.K. Silvestre M.J. Willson T.M. Palinski W. Glass C.K. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 7Joseph S.B. McKilligin E. Pei L.

S. A. 2002; 99: 7604-7609Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have identified NR4A receptors as a novel pathway for the control of macrophage gene expression by inflammatory stimuli. In contrast to PPAR and LXR, oxidized lipids regulate Nur77 activity not through direct binding to the receptor but by increasing the level of receptor expression within the cell. Although the molecular mechanism involved in Nur77 induction by oxidized lipids remains to be elucidated, we have shown that the rapid induction by inflammatory stimuli such as LPS requires the action of NF-κB proteins on the Nur77 promoter. Despite the fact that the NR4A receptors were among the first orphan nuclear receptors cloned, our knowledge of their biological function is still limited. In particular, very few direct target genes for these transcription factors have been identified. In the brain, the tyrosine hydroxylase and the proopiomelanocortin genes are targets (27Sakurada K. Ohshima-Sakurada M. Palmer T.D. Gage F.H. Development. 1999; 126: 4017-4026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Murphy E.P. Conneely O.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The apoptotic effects of Nur77 in T cells have been proposed to involve the target genes FasL and CD30 (29Weih F. Ryseck R.P. Chen L. Bravo R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5533-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 30Zhang J. DeYoung A. Kasler H.G. Kabra N.H. Kuang A.A. Diehl G. Sohn S.J. Bishop C. Winoto A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1999; 64: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, Nur77-mediated apoptosis is intact in gld/gld (FasL mutant mice) or CD30-/- mice, excluding both as major downstream effectors. Previous studies have reported that expression of Nurr1 is elevated in rheumatoid arthritis synovial tissue; however, the functional consequence of receptor induction in this context has not been explored (31McEvoy A.N. Murphy E.A. Ponnio T. Conneely O.M. Bresnihan B. FitzGerald O. Murphy E.P. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2979-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In contrast to the mitochondrial Nur77 localization seen in some apoptotic circumstances (12Lin B. Kolluri S.K. Lin F. Liu W. Han Y.H. Cao X. Dawson M.I. Reed J.C. Zhang X.K. Cell. 2004; 116: 527-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 32Li H. Kolluri S.K. Gu J. Dawson M.I. Cao X. Hobbs P.D. Lin B. Chen G. Lu J. Lin F. Xie Z. Fontana J.A. Reed J.C. Zhang X. Science. 2000; 289: 1159-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), inducible expression of Nur77 proteins in our studies localized to the nucleus (Fig. 2). This observation suggests that NR4A proteins function as classical transcription factors in this context. An important goal of future work will be to identify genes that are controlled by NR4A proteins in macrophages. Because all three NR4A members are strongly induced by inflammatory stimuli and bind to the same response elements, it seems likely that they may regulate expression of some of the same genes. Thus, these receptors may play redundant roles in macrophage inflammatory responses as well as in T cell apoptosis (33Cheng L.E. Chan F.K. Cado D. Winoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1865-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Given the causal role of oxidized lipids in atherogenesis, our results raise the possibility that NR4A-dependent gene expression may be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Recent work from other groups has investigated the function of NR4A receptors in both smooth muscle and endothelial cells and their relevance to cardiovascular disease. Badimon and colleague (34Martinez-Gonzalez J. Badimon L. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 65: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) have reported that NOR1 expression is induced in smooth muscle cells by LDL treatment. Gruber et al. (35Gruber F. Hufnagl P. Hofer-Warbinek R. Schmid J.A. Breuss J.M. Huber-Beckmann R. Lucerna M. Papac N. Harant H. Lindley I. de Martin R. Binder B.R. Blood. 2003; 101: 3042-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) have reported that Nur77 regulates PAI-1 expression in endothelial cells in response to TNFα. Another recent study employed a carotid artery ligation model to show that neointimal formation is inhibited in vascular smooth muscle cell-specific Nur77 transgenic mice and increased in smooth muscle cell-specific Nur77 dominant-negative transgenic mice (36Arkenbout E.K. de Waard V. van Bragt M. van Achterberg T.A. Grimbergen J.M. Pichon B. Pannekoek H. de Vries C.J. Circulation. 2002; 106: 1530-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of macrophage Nur77 to cardiovascular disease has not yet been addressed. In the future it will be important to test directly the contributions of NR4A-dependent gene expression for the development of atherosclerosis in apoE or LDLR null mice. Because of the redundancy of these receptors, however, it is likely that a strategy to knock down two or all three receptors will be required. We are grateful to Dr. S.

The caveolin/lipid raft signaling hypothesis proposes that compartmentation of signaling molecules in caveolae provides a mechanism for temporal and spatial signal transduction and cross-talk among signaling pathways (15Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Sargiacomo M. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 231-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Despite substantial data supporting this notion (16Shaul P.W. Anderson R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L843-L851PubMed Google Scholar, 17Williams T.M. Lisanti M.P. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: 214Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), little is known regarding the expression of caveolae in the plasma membrane versus non-plasma membrane locations. One cell type in which GPCR compartmentation has been studied is the cardiac myocyte (CM), but virtually all previous studies related to caveolae have involved the use of neonatal CM (9Rybin V.O.

Adult CM differ from neonatal CM in numerous ways, including being more extensively differentiated, multinucleated, and larger in volume and possessing a more developed T-tubule network. In this study, we hypothesized that Cav-3 co-localizes with GPCR signaling components in both sarcolemmal and intracellular membranes and used adult CM to determine whether (a) Cav distributes differently in adult CM versus other cardiac cell types; (b) GPCR (e.g. β-adrenergic, muscarinic, and μ-opioid receptors) and key post-receptor signaling components, including heterotrimeric G-proteins and adenylyl cyclase, co-localize with Cav-3 in intracellular domains (i.e. T-tubules) in addition to the sarcolemma; and (c) Cav-3 scaffolds GPCR signaling components capable of stimulating and inhibiting cAMP synthesis. Materials—Antibodies for adenylyl cyclase (AC) type 5/6, β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors (AR), Gαs, Gαi3, Gαi2, M2- and M4-muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR), μ-opioid receptors (μ-OR), and β-adaptin were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibodies for Cav-3 and Cav-1 were from BD Biosciences. Antibodies for dihydropyridine receptors (DHPR), vinculin, and ryanodine receptors (RyR) were purchased from Sigma. Anti-Cav-3 polyclonal antibodies were from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate- and Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Invitrogen. Other secondary antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. All other chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma unless stated otherwise. CM Preparation—Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg), and hearts were excised and retrograde-perfused with medium containing collagenase II (Worthington) as described previously (19Ander A.N. Duggirala S.K. Drumm J.D. Roth D.M. DNA Cell Biol. 2004; 23: 586-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Animals were heparinized (1000-2000 units intraperitoneal) 5 min prior to administration of anesthesia. Hearts were removed and placed in ice-cold cardioplegic solution (112 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 9 mm NaH2PO4, and 11.1 mm d-glucose supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, 30 mm taurine, 2 mm dl-carnitine, and 2 mm creatine, pH 7.4). The hearts were retrograde-perfused on a Langendorff apparatus at a rate of 5 ml/min for 5 min at 37 °C, followed by perfusion with medium containing collagenase II (250 units/mg) for 20 min. Following perfusion, both ventricles were isolated, minced in collagenase II-containing medium for 10-15 min, washed several times, and re-acclimated to 1.2 mm Ca2+ over 25 min to produce calcium-tolerant CM. To remove all non-myocytes, myocytes were plated in 4% fetal bovine serum on laminin (2 μg/cm2)-coated plates for 1 h, followed by serum-free medium (1% bovine serum albumin); CM were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 24 h prior to experiments. Membrane Fractionation—CM were fractionated using both detergent-free and detergent-containing (1% Triton X-100) methods (20Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Buffer containing 10 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA was used to extract the contractile myofibrils as described previously (22Roth D.A. Urasawa K. Leiber D. Insel P.A. Hammond H.K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). CM from a 15-cm plate were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and scraped in 3 ml of either 500 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11.0, to extract peripheral membrane proteins or TNE buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA) containing 1% Triton X-100. For detergent-free extraction, cells were homogenized by three 10-s bursts of a tissue grinder and then sonicated by three cycles of 20-s bursts of sonication and 1 min of incubation on ice. Approximately 2 ml of homogenate were mixed with 2 ml of 90% sucrose in MES-buffered saline (25 mm MES and 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5) to form 45% sucrose and loaded at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A discontinuous sucrose gradient was generated by layering 4 ml of 35% sucrose prepared in MES-buffered saline and 250 mm Na2CO3, followed by 4 ml of 5% sucrose also in MES-buffered saline/Na2CO3. Gradients were centrifuged at 280,000 × g using a Beckman SW 41Ti rotor for 16-20 h at 4 °C. For subcellular fractionation using Triton X-100, 2 ml of homogenate were mixed with 2 ml of 90% sucrose in TNE buffer. A discontinuous sucrose gradient was generated by layering 4 ml of 30% sucrose in TNE buffer, followed by 4 ml of 5% sucrose in TNE buffer and centrifugation at 190,000 × g using the SW 41Ti rotor for 16-20 h at 4 °C. Samples were removed in 1-ml aliquots to form 12 fractions. Immunoprecipitation of Buoyant Fractions (BF) and Heavy Fractions (HF)—Immunoprecipitations were performed using either protein A- or protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science). BF and HF (in which the pH was neutralized with HCl) or Triton X-100 fractions were incubated with primary antibody for 1-3 h at 4 °C, immunoprecipitated overnight with protein-agarose at 4 °C, and then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min. Protein-agarose pellets were washed once with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% Igepal CA-630 plus mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)), followed by subsequent washes with wash buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Igepal CA-630) and wash buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.2% Igepal CA-630). Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins in fractions and cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE using 10 or 12% acrylamide precast gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.) by electroelution. Membranes were blocked with 20 mm PBS and 1% Tween containing 1.5% nonfat dry milk and incubated overnight with primary antibody at 4 °C. Primary antibodies were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). All displayed bands migrated at the appropriate size as determined by comparison with molecular weight standards (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The amount of protein per fraction was determined using a dye binding protein assay (Bio-Rad). Immunofluorescence Microscopy of Adult Heart and CM—Adult rat heart ventricles and CM were prepared for immunofluorescence microscopy as described (23Page E. Winterfield J. Goings G. Bastawrous A. Upshaw-Earley J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H1988-H2000PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sedarat F. Xu L. Moore E.D. Tibbits G.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H202-H209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CM were plated on laminin (2 μg/cm2)-precoated glass coverslips and grown for 24 h. Rat ventricles were freshly harvested, frozen, and then mounted on a cryostat (-23 °C) to cut 10-μm semithin sections. Semithin sections and cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature; incubated with 100 mm glycine, pH 7.4, for 10 min to quench aldehyde groups; permeabilized in 0.1% buffered Triton X-100 for 10 min; blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin, PBS, and 0.05% Tween for 20 min; and then incubated with primary antibodies (1:100) in 1% bovine serum albumin, PBS, and 0.05% Tween for 24-48 h at 4 °C. Excess antibody was removed by incubation with PBS and 0.1% Tween for 15 min, and samples were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Alexa-conjugated secondary antibody (1:250) for 1 h. To remove excess secondary antibody, semithin sections and cells were washed six times at 5-min intervals with PBS and 0.1% Tween and incubated for 20 min with the nuclear stain 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1:5000) diluted in PBS. Sections and cells were washed for 10 min with PBS and mounted in gelvatol for microscopic imaging. Deconvolution Image Analysis—Deconvolution images were obtained as described (25Agard D.A.

The system includes a Photometrics CCD camera mounted on a Nikon TE-200 inverted epifluorescence microscope. Between 30 and 80 optical sections spaced by ∼0.1-0.3 μm were generally taken. Exposure times were set such that the camera response was in the linear range for each fluorophore. Lenses included ×100 (numerical aperture of 1.4), ×60 (numerical aperture of 1.4), and ×40 (numerical aperture of 1.3). The data sets were deconvolved and analyzed using SoftWorx software (Applied Precision, LLC) on a Silicon Graphics Octane workstation. Image analysis was performed with the Data Inspector program in SoftWorx. Maximal projection volume views or single optical sections are shown as indicated. Electron Microscopy—Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, gently scraped, and pelleted. The resuspended pellet was fixed for 1 h at room temperature with 8% paraformaldehyde and then overnight with 4% paraformaldehyde at 40 °C. Cells were washed three times with 0.1 m phosphate buffer, embedded in 10% gelatin, and cryoprotected overnight in 2.3 m sucrose at 40 °C. Cryosections were cut on a Leica UltraCut E ultramicrotome; 80-nm ultrathin sections were mounted on glow-discharged nickel grids and stored on 2% gelatin until labeled. Sections were blocked with 1% goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h to overnight, followed by 5- or 10-nm gold-labeled goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences). Sections were then absorption-stained with uranyl acetate and embedded in 0.2% methyl cellulose. For AC localization, cells were treated with an adenoviral construct containing either LacZ (control) or AC6 for 24 h prior to fixation (18Ostrom R.S. Violin J.D. Coleman S. Insel P.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1075-1079PubMed Google Scholar). Measurement of AC Activity—AC activity was measured in Cav-3 immunoprecipitates using a modification of a previously described method (10Ostrom R.S. Liu X. Head B.P. Gregorian C. Seasholtz T.M. Insel P.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 983-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A 15-cm plate of adult CM was homogenized on ice in lysis buffer, precleared with protein A-agarose for 1 h, and incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. Antibody conjugates were immunoprecipitated with protein G-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min. Agarose pellets were washed once with lysis buffer and subsequently with wash buffers A and B and then resuspended in 30 mm Na-HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5. Protein (30 μl of immunoprecipitate) was added to tubes containing 30 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine (a cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitor), 1 mm ATP, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 5 μm GTP, 60 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. After 5 min, 0.1 μm naloxone (an opioid receptor antagonist) or vehicle was added, followed 5 min later by addition of 1 μm [d-Ala2,N-MePhe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin (DAMGO; a selective μ-OR agonist) or vehicle. After 5 min, 10 μm forskolin was added, and samples were incubated for an additional 15 min. The reaction was stopped by boiling for 5 min, and cAMP content was assayed as described previously (27Ostrom R.S. Gregorian C. Drenan R.M. Xiang Y. Regan J.W. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42063-42069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Caveolin Distributes Differently in Adult CM Compared with Other Cardiovascular Cells—The distribution of Cav was investigated in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (hCASMC) and adult rat cardiac fibroblasts (ACF) and CM following sucrose density fractionation. We detected the majority of Cav-1 in BF 4 and 5 from ACF and hCASMC (Fig. 1A). In adult CM, Cav-3 was detected in both BF 4 and 5 and HF/non-BF 9-12 (Fig. 1A). Following equal protein loading of sucrose density fractions of adult CM (Fig. 1B), BF were enriched in Cav-3; HF had a lower proportion of Cav-3 (Fig. 1A, lower panels). BF contained <5% of total cellular protein (Fig. 1B). Adult CM fractions in Fig. 1A (from equal volume-loaded gels) that were immunoblotted for the T-tubule markers vinculin and DHPR (a marker for voltage-sensitive calcium channels) showed a distribution pattern similar to that with Cav-3 (Fig. 1C). RyR (a marker of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)) and β-adaptin (a marker of clathrin-coated pits) were detected only in HF (Fig. 1C). To test whether the Cav-3 distribution pattern observed upon Na2CO3/sucrose density fractionation of adult CM was unique to this method of cellular disruption and fractionation, we fractionated adult CM in alternative lysis buffers, one containing 1% Triton X-100 and the other containing a high salt buffer to extract contractile myofibrils. Immunoblotting of equal volume-loaded fractions from the Triton X-100 fractionation revealed a broad distribution of Cav-3 (Fig. 1D). Following extraction of the contractile myofibrils using high salt buffer, we detected buoyant and heavy pools of Cav-3, albeit with a substantially greater amount of Cav-3 in the heavier fractions (Fig. 1D). Overall, these results show that Cav-3 was present in both BF and HF following sucrose density fractionation, indicating a different cellular distribution compared with Cav-1 in two other cardiovascular cell types, hCASMC and ACF. GPCR Signaling Components Distribute Non-uniformly with Cav-3 in Adult CM—Using immunoblot analyses, we investigated co-localization of Gs and Gi protein-coupled receptor signaling components with Cav-3 in adult CM. AC5/6 and β1- and β2-AR were detected in BF, whereas a portion of β1-AR was also detected in HF (Fig. 2A). Gαs was detected as two bands (which represent the short and long splice variants of Gαs) in BF and HF (Fig. 2A). Because the β-AR and mAChR pathways act antagonistically in the regulation of cardiac rate and force of contraction, we investigated whether M2- and M4-mAChR localize to BF. We found that M2-mAChR were excluded from BF, as were Gαi3 and Gαi2, G-proteins through which both M2- and M4-mAChR signal, whereas we detected M4-mAChR in both BF and HF (Fig. 2, B and C). We also detected μ-OR, another Gi-coupled receptor, in adult CM by PCR (data not shown) and immunoblotting of both BF and HF (Fig. 2B). As an alternative means to test for interaction of the signaling components with Cav-3, we assessed BF and HF following immunoprecipitation with an anti-Cav-3 antibody (Fig. 2D). AC5/6, β1- and β2-AR, Gαs, M4-mAChR, μ-OR, and Cav-3 were all detected in Cav-3 immunoprecipitates from both BF and HF. By contrast, M2-mAChR and Gαi3 (Fig. 2D) were detected only in Cav-3 immunoprecipitates from HF, whereas Gαi2 and β-adaptin were not detected in immunoprecipitates from either BF or HF. Thus, the results with the Cav-3 immunoprecipitates from BF and HF confirm the immunoblot findings with sucrose density fractions and demonstrate that GPCR signaling components vary in their cellular distribution with Cav-3. Immunofluorescence Microscopy Shows Co-localization of Cav-3 with AC5/6, Gαs protein, β2-AR, μ-OR, and M4-mAChR in Sarcolemmal and Intracellular Regions in Adult CM—We used immunofluorescence microscopy as an additional means to assess GPCR co-localization with Cav-3 in CM. Cav-3 was detected in the sarcolemma as a punctate pattern and in striations running transversely across the interior of the cell (Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). To assess co-localization of Cav-3 and AC6, a key post-GPCR/G-protein effector in CM, we used an adenoviral vector to overexpress AC6 because available antibodies do not readily detect endogenous AC6 in adult CM. Individual components showed different extents of co-localization with Cav-3 in the sarcolemmal and intracellular regions (data expressed relative to Cav-3 expression) (Figs. 3, 4, 5): AC5/6, 27 and 11%, respectively; Gαs, 32 and 7%, respectively; β2-AR, 43 and 59%, respectively; μ-OR, 39 and 32%, respectively; M4-mAChR, 21 and 34%, respectively; and M2-mAChR, 12 and 45%, respectively (Figs. 3, 4, 5). As a negative control, incubation with secondary antibodies revealed minimal background staining (Fig. 4, lower panel). AC6, Gαs, β2-AR, M4-mAChR, and μ-OR displayed greater co-localization with Cav-3 in the sarcolemma than did M2-mAChR. The distribution of intracellular β2-AR was predominantly in subsarcolemmal locations (Fig. 3), whereas M2-mAChR displayed a more transverse intracellular distribution (Fig. 5A, upper panels). Treatment with the agonist carbachol (100 μm) for 10 min disrupted the transverse staining pattern of M2-mAChR, with redistribution to the sarcolemma and nucleus (Fig. 5A, lower panels). Quantitation of Cav-3 immunofluorescence revealed that ∼25% of total cellular Cav-3 was sarcolemmal (Fig. 5B, left panel), a value similar to that for Cav-3 detected in BF (right panel) from sucrose density fractionation (Fig. 1C, third panel). Thus, Cav-3 appears to be present in both intracellular and sarcolemmal regions, and different GPCR differ in their co-localization with Cav-3.Fig. 4Immunofluorescence and deconvolution analysis of the co-localization of Cav-3 with μ-OR and M4-mAChR in adult CM. Cells were stained with antibodies for Cav-3, μ-OR, and M4-mAChR. Images were deconvolved and are shown as single-stained or overlaid to show co-localization.

https://openalex.org/W1971954801,"Osteoporosis is one of the major health problems in our modern world. Especially, disuse (unloading) osteoporosis occurs commonly in bedridden patients, a population that is rapidly increasing due to aging-associated diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying such unloading-induced pathological bone loss have not yet been fully understood. Since sympathetic nervous system could control bone mass, we examined whether unloading-induced bone loss is controlled by sympathetic nervous tone. Treatment with β-blocker, propranolol, suppressed the unloading-induced reduction in bone mass. Conversely, β-agonist, isoproterenol, reduced bone mass in loaded mice, and under such conditions, unloading no longer further reduced bone mass. Analyses on the cellular bases indicated that unloading-induced reduction in the levels of osteoblastic cell activities, including mineral apposition rate, mineralizing surface, and bone formation rate, was suppressed by propranolol treatment and that isoproterenol-induced reduction in these levels of bone formation parameters was no longer suppressed by unloading. Unloading-induced reduction in the levels of mineralized nodule formation in bone marrow cell cultures was suppressed by propranolol treatment in vivo. In addition, loss of a half-dosage in the dopamine β-hydroxylase gene suppressed the unloading-induced bone loss and reduction in mineralized nodule formation. Unloading-induced increase in the levels of osteoclastic activities such as osteoclast number and surface as well as urinary deoxypyridinoline was all suppressed by the treatment with propranolol. These observations indicated that sympathetic nervous tone mediates unloading-induced bone loss through suppression of bone formation by osteoblasts and enhancement of resorption by osteoclasts.

Especially, high fracture risk in osteoporosis patients results in not only loss of quality of life but also loss of life in a certain fraction of aged patients. The number of osteoporosis patients is estimated to be close to 10% of the whole population in many advanced countries. Among this patient population, a significant number of patients have disuse osteoporosis based on bedridden conditions caused by aging-related cardiovasucular as well as cerebrovascular diseases (5Ehrlich P.J. Lanyon L.E. Osteoporosis Int. 2002; 13: 688-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Bone has been known to be lost upon the removal of the mechanical stimuli, and prolonged lack of mechanical stimuli leads to disuse osteoporosis (5Ehrlich P.J. Lanyon L.E. Osteoporosis Int. 2002; 13: 688-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 6Lanyon L. Skerry T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1937-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 7Bikle D.D.

Bone mass is determined by the actions of osteoblasts, which make bone, and those of osteoclasts, which resorb bone (2Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. N. Am. 2003; 32: 15-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 12Augat P. Simon U. Liedert A. Claes L.

The balance between the two activities is under the control of hormones and cytokines. Usually, simultaneous changes in the two activities are considered to be coupled to compensate bone loss. However, in the case of disuse osteoporosis, bone formation activities are not enhanced even in the presence of enhanced bone resorption. Rather, bone formation is significantly suppressed in disuse osteoporosis (16Ishijima M. Tsuji K. Rittling S.R. Yamashita T. Kurosawa H. Denhardt D.T. Nifuji A. Noda M. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 17Harada S. Rodan G.A. Nature. 2003; 423: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Therefore, disuse osteoporosis is a critical pathological situation where bone mass is continuously lost without having any compensatory activity against the reduction of bone. However, how such a critical reduction in bone formation occurs in unloading-induced pathological bone loss is not yet known. Bone formation and bone resorption are under the control of the systemic hormones and local cytokines (2Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. N. Am. 2003; 32: 15-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 6Lanyon L. Skerry T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1937-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, none of these factors have been proven to be the major cause of the disuse osteoporosis. In addition to the bedridden patients, astronauts under gravity conditions also lose bone due to the loss of mechanical stress. Analysis of such astronauts returning from space indicated that sympathetic nervous tone is enhanced in their muscle (18Fu Q Levine B.D. Pawelczyk J.A. Ertl A.C. Diedrich A. Cox J.F. Zuckerman J.H.

However, nothing has been known about how this system is related to pathophysiology in bone metabolism in the body. Therefore, we examined whether sympathetic nervous tone is involved in reduction of bone mass in a disuse osteoporosis model via osteoblastic and osteoclastic cells using hind limb unloading. Animals—Male 129 or C57BL/6J mice (10–14 weeks old) were used for the experiments. Mice were housed for at least 1 week prior to the study. The mice were subjected to either intraperitoneal injections of propranolol (20 μg/g of body weight/day) (21Commins S.P. Watson P.M. Levin N. Beiler R.J. Gettys T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33059-33067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), continuous administration of guanethidine via an osmotic minipump (20 μg/g of body weight/day) (22Sherman B.E. Chole R.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1354-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), or intraperitoneal injections of isoproterenol (6 μg/g of body weight/day) (23Takeda S. Elefteriou F.

In the case of osmotic minipump implantation, the pump was implanted 12 h before the start of hind limb unloading. Osmotic minipumps were implanted into the subcutaneous tissue in the back of the animals according to the manufacturer's instruction. For dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH) 1The abbreviations used are: DBH, dopamine β-hydroxylase; BV/TV, bone volume/tissue volume; BFR, bone formation rate; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase; MAR, bone mineral apposition rate; MS, mineralizing surface; CT, computerized tomography. gene deletion experiments, heterozygous knockout mice with a C57BL6/129sv F2 background and wild type litter mate mice were used (13-week-old females) (24Thomas S.A. Matsumoto A.M. Palmiter R.D. Nature. 1995; 374: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). All of the mice were injected intraperitoneally with calcein at 4 mg/kg at 4 and 2 days before sacrifice. After treatment for 10 or 14 days, mice were anesthetized with tribromoethanol at 200 mg/kg and were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Hind Limb Unloading Model—Hind limb unloading was conducted by applying a tape to the surface of the hind limb to set a metal clip (10Ishijima M. Tsuji K. Rittling S.R. Yamashita T. Kurosawa H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 16Ishijima M. Tsuji K. Rittling S.R. Yamashita T. Kurosawa H. Denhardt D.T. Nifuji A. Noda M. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The end of the clip was fixed to an overhead bar. The height of the bar was adjusted to maintain the mice at an ∼30° head down tilt with the hind limbs elevated above the floor of the cage. The mice were subjected to hind limb unloading for 10 or 14 days. Loaded control mice were also housed individually under the same conditions except for hind limb unloading for the same duration. Body Weight—The body weight of the mice was monitored during the experimental period. There were no significant changes in body weight in any of the groups during the course of the study. This confirmed that stress could be considered minimal in our experiments as previously described (16Ishijima M. Tsuji K. Rittling S.R. Yamashita T. Kurosawa H. Denhardt D.T. Nifuji A. Noda M. J.

Two-dimensional Micro-CT Analysis of Bone—Bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV) was determined based on two-dimensional micro-CT analyses using a micro-CT apparatus (Musashi, Nittetsu-ELEX Co., Kita-Kyushu City, Japan). The data were quantified by using automated image analysis system (Luzex-F, Nireco). The fractional bone volume (BV/TV) was obtained in an area of 0.47 mm2 with its closest and furthest edges at 0.28 and 0.84 mm, respectively, distal to the growth plate of the proximal ends of the tibiae. The threshold level for the measurements was set at 110 for the analyses (16Ishijima M. Tsuji K. Rittling S.R. Yamashita T. Kurosawa H. Denhardt D.T. Nifuji A. Noda M. J. Exp.

Histomorphometric Analysis of Bone—At the end of the experiments, the right femora of each mouse were removed and fixed in 70% ethanol. Serial 3-μm-thick sagittal sections were made as undecalcified sections (right femora). For bone formation rate (BFR), metaphyseal cancellous bone in the femora was used to obtain bone fraction in a rectangular area of 0.34 mm2 (0.5 × 0.67 mm) with its closest and furthest edges at 0.3 and 0.8 mm distal to the growth plate, respectively. For decalcified sections, the left tibiae of the mice were removed at the end of the experiments and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then decalcified in 20% EDTA. Serial 5-mm-thick sagittal sections were made using a microtome and stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). TRAP-positive multinucleated cells attached to bone were scored as osteoclasts. Measurements were made within an area of 0.24 mm2 (0.6 × 0.4 mm), with its closest and furthest edges at 0.3 and 0.7 mm distal to the growth plate of the proximal ends of the tibiae. Histomorphometry was conducted to quantify the number of osteoclasts (Oc.N/BS) and osteoclast surface (Oc.S/BS) as defined by Parfitt et al. (11Parfitt A.M. Drezner M.K. Glorieux F.H. Kanis J.A.

The cells were cultured in the presence of ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml) and β-glycerophosphate (10 mm) in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% antibiotics. After 3 weeks in culture, alizarin red staining was conducted. This staining was used to visualize the calcified materials formed in vitro. Briefly, after the cultures were terminated, the cells were fixed in 100% ethanol and then were stained in alizarin red solution (1%) for 1 min. The cultures were then rinsed several times with water. The area of alizarin red positive nodules was measured by using an image analyzer. Urinary Deoxypyridinoline—Deoxypyridinoline levels in urine at the end of the hind limb unloading were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Metra Biosystems) (6Lanyon L. Skerry T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1937-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Urine samples were collected from five mice per group, which were housed in a metabolic cage during the last 24 h and analyzed. Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as means ± S.D., and statistical evaluation was performed based on analysis of variance, using a statistical software package for Windows, Statview version 5.0 (SAS Institute). A p value less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Hind limb unloading reduced bone volume in vehicle-treated control mice as reported previously (16Ishijima M. Tsuji K. Rittling S.R. Yamashita T. Kurosawa H. Denhardt D.T. Nifuji A. Noda M. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, a and b, column 1 versus column 2). In contrast, treatment with propranolol, a β-adrenergic blocker acting at the receptor levels, suppressed hind limb unloading-induced reduction in bone mass expressed as BV/TV (Fig. 1, a and b; no significant difference between columns 3 and 4). With regard to the drug effect in unloaded mice, propranolol treatment resumed the bone loss induced by unloading (Fig. 1b, column 2 versus column 4). Control-loaded mice treated with propranolol revealed significant difference in bone mass compared with unloaded vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 1b, column 2 versus column 3). If hind limb unloading suppressed the levels of bone mass and bone formation through sympathetic tone, not only the actions of the blockers for sympathetic signaling, which act at the receptor levels, but also the depletion of the presynaptic transmitter reservoir should affect the unloading-induced reduction in bone mass. Therefore, guanethidine sulfate was administrated to deplete norepinephrine at the presynaptic nerve ending levels in the animals that were subjected to hind limb unloading. As shown in Fig. 2, guanethidine treatment suppressed unloading-induced bone loss (Fig. 2, a and b). The pattern of the levels in BV/TV was similar to that in the case of propranolol (Fig. 1). Body weight was not altered significantly due to unloading or drug treatment in all of our experiments (Fig. 2, c–e).Fig. 2Guanethidine treatment suppressed unloading-induced pathological bone loss. During hind limb unloading of mice (129 strain) for 14 days, guanethidine treatment or vehicle was administered using an osmotic minipump (model 1002). The number of the mice used for the experiments represented in each bar is indicated as N. During the 14-day hind limb unloading of 129 mice, guanethidine treatment was carried out.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further test whether unloading signaling is exerted in the line of sympathetic tone, we examined the effects of activation by isoproterenol of sympathetic tone. This was in order to determine whether isoproterenol may mask the unloading-induced signals. Isoproterenol treatment reduced bone mass in control-loaded mice as reported previously (Fig. 3, a and b, column 1 versus column 3), and under this condition, hind limb unloading no longer reduced bone mass (Fig. 3, a and b; compare columns 3 and 4). Notably, the levels of bone mass reduction by isoproterenol treatment were similar to those in unloaded mice (Fig. 3b, column 3 versus column 2). Thus, the data of these three sets of experiments are in accordance with the notion that unloading signaling is suppressed by blockers for sympathetic signaling, and such signaling is no longer active in the presence of the action of β-adrenergic agonist. In order to examine the mechanisms of β-adrenergic actions in unloading-induced bone loss, we conducted dynamic histomorphometry. Hind limb unloading induced reduction in the levels of bone mineral apposition rate (MAR)), mineralizing surface (MS), and BFR (Fig. 4, a–d) after 10 days of hind limb unloading and propranolol treatment suppressed the unloading-induced decrease in MAR, MS, and BFR (Fig. 4, a–d). The patterns of the columns were similar to those in the case of bone mass (Fig. 1). Guanethidine treatment also suppressed the hind limb unloading-induced reduction in MAR, MS, and BFR (Fig. 5, a–d) in the mice subjected to hind limb unloading for 2 weeks. Again, the patterns of the columns were similar to those in the case of bone mass (Fig. 1). Thus, depletion of sympathetic neurotransmitter has effects similar to the block of β-adrenergic receptor with respect to bone formation activity in vivo. Isoproterenol treatment alone suppressed the levels of mineral apposition rate, mineralizing surface, and bone formation rate, whereas in the presence of isoproterenol treatment, 10 days of hind limb unloading failed to suppress all of these parameters (Fig. 6, a–d). It is again notable that the patterns of the columns in Fig. 6 were similar to those observed in the effects of isoproterenol on bone mass (Fig. 3). These three lines of evidence based on dynamic histomorphometry indicated that bone formation is the target of sympathetic tone in mice subjected to hind limb unloading.Fig. 5Guanethidine treatment suppressed unloading-induced reduction in bone formation in vivo.

For this purpose, a nodule formation assay was conducted by using bone marrow cells obtained from the bone of the mice after they were subjected to hind limb unloading or control loading in the presence or the absence of the treatment with pharmacological agents. Hind limb unloading reduced nodule formation in the cultures of cells obtained from the animals (Fig. 7, a and b, column 1 versus column 2). Propranolol treatment in vivo suppressed the unloading-induced reduction in the mineralized nodule formation in culture (Fig. 7, a and b, column 3 versus column 4). Isoproterenol treatment suppressed the levels of nodule formation in loaded control mice (Fig. 8, a and b, column 1 versus column 3), and in the presence of isoproterenol treatment in vivo, hind limb unloading failed to further reduce the levels of nodule formation in bone marrow cells in culture (Fig. 8, a and b, column 3 versus column 4). Thus, these in vitro experiments indicated that β-adrenergic sympathetic tone mediates unloading-induced reduction in mineralization of bone marrow cell cultures.Fig. 8Isoproterenol treatment in vivo suppressed the levels of nodule formation, and unloading conditions failed to further reduce the mineralization levels in vitro.

Hind limb unloading reduced bone mass by about 68.6% in wild type littermate mice (Fig. 9a, column 1 versus column 2). Heterozygous loss for the dopamine β-hydroxylase gene attenuated the reduction in bone loss by about 29.7% after hind limb unloading (Fig. 9a, column 3 versus column 4). The rate of bone loss due to unloading (calculated as (control load – unload)/(control load × 100%) was significantly reduced from 68 ± 7% in DBH+/+ (wild type) to 30 ± 24% in DBH+/– (Fig. 9c)(p < 0.05). The nodule formation in cultures of bone marrow cells of the wild type littermate was reduced by unloading (Fig. 9b, column 1 versus column 2). The marrow cells obtained from DBH gene heterozygous knockout mice indicated suppression of hind limb unloading-induced reduction in nodule formation (Fig. 9b, column 3 versus column 4). During the course of unloading-induced bone loss, bone resorption also occurs as critical events to reduce bone mass. Unloading in tail-suspended mice caused an increase in osteoclast number (Oc.N/BS) and osteoclast surface (Oc.S/BS) based on histomorphometry in vivo as reported previously (Fig. 10, b–g, column 1 versus column 2). In contrast, inhibition of sympathetic tone by treatment with propranolol or guanethidine, suppressed such unloading-induced increase in osteoclast number (Oc.N/BS) (Fig. 10, a and b for propranolol, d for guanethidine; column 3 versus column 4) and osteoclast surface (Oc.S/BS) (Fig. 10, c for propranolol, e for guanethidine; column 3 versus column 4). The levels of Oc.N/BS and Oc.S/BS were enhanced by either unloading or isoproterenol treatment alone to similar levels (Fig. 10, f and g, column 2 versus column 3). The simultaneous presence of unloading conditions and isoproterenol treatment resulted in similar levels in the increase in osteoclast number (Oc.N/BS) and surface (Oc.S/BS) to those in mice subjected to either one of the two conditions alone (Fig. 10, f and g, column 4 versus columns 2 and 3). Furthermore, unloading-induced increase in deoxypyridinoline excretion into urine (Fig. 11, column 1 versus column 2) was also suppressed by guanethidine treatment (Fig. 11, column 3 versus column 4).Fig. 11Pharmacological inhibition of sympathetic tone suppresses unloading-induced systemic bone loss assessed by the levels of urinary deoxypyridinoline excretion.

This is the first report that sympathetic control of the bone mass is involved in the unloading-induced bone loss by controlling osteoblasts. Unloading-induced bone loss was suppressed by the treatment of the animals with propranolol, a receptor antagonist, suggesting that β-adrenergic receptors in the sympathetic nervous system are the target of unloading-induced bone loss. The peripheral sympathetic nervous targets receive signals from the proximal upper nervous ending, which releases noradrenalin as a neurotransmitter into the synaptic gap. We observed that unloading-induced bone loss was again suppressed by the treatment of the animals with guanethidine. These data indicate that the depletion of noradrenalin in the proximal ending of the synaptic gap could suppress the unloading-induced osteoporosis. Furthermore, unloading failed to further suppress the bone volume that was reduced by a β-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol. These three series of observations further indicate that sympathetic nervous tone is involved in unloading-induced pathological bone loss. We also examined the effects of heterozygous deletion of the DBH gene. DBH is required for the sympathetic nervous tone. Therefore, we subjected the heterozygous knockout mice to hind limb unloading. Unloading-induced bone loss was attenuated by the absence of the half-dosage of dopamine β-hydroxylase gene, indicating that the presence of a full dosage of DBH gene in the animals is necessary for the complete effects of the unloading-induced bone loss. Furthermore, DBH data excluded the possibility that pharmacological experiments might be influenced by possible artifacts due to the systemic drug administration. Thus, both pharmacological and genetic interventions of sympathetic signals supported the idea that the sympathetic nervous system causes pathological loss of bone in unloading-induced osteopenia. Since bone formation is the critical activity to determine the levels of bone loss due to unloading, it is the major target to elucidate the mechanisms required for unloading-induced loss of bone mass. Dynamic histomorphometric analyses on osteoblastic cell activity in vivo revealed that the reduction in bone formation activity in vivo due to unloading was suppressed by a series of pharmacological agents including propranolol and guanethidine. Furthermore, bone cell culture experiments using the bone marrow cells taken from the animals subjected to either pharmacological or genetic interventions of the sympathetic nervous tone indicate that these interventions suppressed unloading-induced reduction in mineralized nodule formation. The interpretation of the reduction in the formation of osteoblastic bone nodules after 3 weeks in culture would be that progenitor cell populations for osteoblastic cell lineage could be reduced at the point of harvesting the cells from animals at the end of unloading. This suppression was blocked by the treatment with propranolol. We also carried out 3-week culture experiments to form bone nodules in the presence or absence of isoproterenol or propranolol and guanethidine in culture using bone marrow cells that were taken from wild type (untreated) C57Bl6 mice. There was no effect of these agents in culture to modulate the nodule formation in the bone marrow cells from untreated mice (data not shown). These data support the idea that the progenitor population in bone marrow in vivo would be reduced by the unloading condition or by treatment with drugs such as propranolol, guanethidine, and isoproterenol during the periods of the tail suspension experiments. Therefore, the action of sympathetic nervous tone during unloading-induced bone loss renders cell level effects on osteoblastic cell activity. It is known that propranolol at doses of 10 μg/g body weight could reduce blood pressure in mice. It is also known that such blood pressure change could be enhanced by the treatment with isoproterenol. However, there has yet been no clear evidence in clinical or experimental settings in terms of a direct relationship between blood pressure and bone mass. However, at this point, we cannot fully exclude the possibility that propranolol or isoproterenol used in our experiments may have affected bone mass via regulation of blood pressure, and these points have to be elucidated in the future. It is intriguing to consider the differences in the time courses of the β-adrenergic receptor modulators. Propranolol has been known to reduce blood pressure in days, whereas isoproterenol and guanethidine alter blood pressure immediately. It is not known whether such time course differences seen in their effects on blood pressure may also affect their modulation of the bone mass. However, both propranolol and guanethidine blocked unloading-induced bone loss similarly in our experiments. This may partially be due to the nature of bone where the biological read out (i.e. bone mass) could be detected in a relatively slow manner compared with blood pressure. If these types of drugs could be proven to be effective in the treatment of unloading-induced osteoporosis, it has to be considered that side effects might occur in the treatment of the patients. In the future, we may have to identify certain windows of the dosages by which bone effects may be obtained without affecting the blood pressure, or these drugs may be used only for those patients whose side effects could be predicted to be less based on the individual genomic data. Our data indicated that sympathetic tones regulate unloading-induced enhancement in bone resorption. This was evidenced by the observations that inhibition of sympathetic tone by propranolol and guanethidine, suppressed unloading-induced bone resorption, and this leads to suppression in bone loss. Histomorphometric analyses indicated that unloading activates bone resorption through the increase in osteoclast number and osteoclast surface. These increases in the bone resorption parameters due to unloading were suppressed by treatment with propranolol and guanethidine. Such observations regarding the inhibitors for sympathetic tone effects on unloading-induced bone resorption were not limited to particular bone, since suppression of sympathetic tone by the treatment with guanethidine also suppressed unloading-induced increase in deoxypyridinoline excretion into urine, which is a systemic bone resorption maker. These data revealed that sympathetic tone regulates unloading-induced bone resorption as well. Involvement of sympathetic tone in the induction of bone resorption after unloading was further supported by the analysis on the mice subjected to simultaneous unloading and isoproterenol treatment. Either isoproterenol treatment or unloading alone could cause an equivalent increase in the levels of bone loss as well as an increase in the levels of bone resorption parameters (osteoclast number and osteoclast surface). The simultaneous presence of unloading conditions and isoproterenol treatment resulted in an increase in bone loss as well as an increase in osteoclast number and osteoclast surface to levels equivalent to those in the cases of either one of the two conditions alone. These data further support the notion that sympathetic nervous tone and the unloading condition would share signaling pathways. Unloading induces rapid bone loss and increases fracture risk significantly, especially in elderly bedridden patients. In fact, deoxypyridinoline excretion into urine was reported to increase in astronauts within a few hours after they are exposed to microgravity conditions in space. Such rapid bone loss is caused by an immediate response of osteoclastic activity when the body is subjected to unloading conditions. Although this phenomenon is so clearly observed in human (bedridden patients and astronauts) and various animal models, the mechanism for such a response of bone resorbing activity has not been identified. Since the nervous system could elicit signals at a relatively fast speed, our identification of the sympathetic tone as responsible for the unloading-induced increase in bone resorption and loss of bone mass would explain the rapid response of osteoclasts to unloading. Although we have used DBH knockout mice to see the effects of such a deletion of the gene on the bone loss due to tail suspension, this enzyme is also required to produce epinephrine in the adrenals as well as norepinephrine. The enzyme required to produce epinephrine from norepinephrine, phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase, has been suggested in several reports to be subjected to induction by immobilization-induced stress. As a result, the DBH heterozygous knock-out mice results may not represent conclusive proof of a prominent role for the sympathetic nervous system here. However, our data on the effects of unloading on bone in DBH knockout mice is at least in part in accordance with the idea that sympathetic tone is involved in the bone loss due to unloading. In conclusion, our data indicate that sympathetic tone is in charge of the pathological reduction in bone mass upon unloading by suppressing osteoblastic cell actions and enhancing osteoclastic actions. These data predict that identification of the involvement of systemic modulation in the bone loss in unloading conditions could give a clue to appropriate measures to treat patients with disuse osteoporosis (9Serhan C.N.

The human homologue of Ndc80 is referred to as Hec1, which stands for highly enhanced in cancer cells 1 (26Chen Y. Riley D. Chen P. Lee W. Mol. Cell.

Antibodies to Hec1 localize to the outer plate of HeLa cell kinetochores where the plus ends of kinetochore microtubules are anchored (27Howe M. McDonald K.L. Albertson D.G. Meyer B.J. J.

Depletion or inactivation of subunits of the Ndc80 complex by several methods invariably results in severe problems of chromosome congression and lack of poleward forces at the kinetochore (reviewed in Refs. 19Maiato H. Deluca J. Salmon E.D. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5461-5477Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar and 20Kline-Smith S.L. Sandall S. Desai A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). There has been some controversy as to whether the defective chromosome congression phenotype resulting from depletion of Ndc80 is caused by a defect in kinetochore-microtubule attachment. Depletion of Hec1 or Spc25 by RNA interference in HeLa cells resulted in a failure of chromosomes to congress to the spindle equator, but the existence of kinetochore-microtubule connections that resisted short cold or calcium treatments and the localization of the microtubule plus end-binding protein EB1 at the kinetochore-microtubule interface suggested that stable kinetochore-microtubule interactions may form in these cells (23Bharadwaj R. Qi W. Yu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 13076-13085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 31Martin-Lluesma S. Stucke V.M. Nigg E.A. Science. 2002; 297: 2267-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Recent studies, however, concluded that cells depleted of Hec1 or Nuf2 display a damaged outer kinetochore, coupled to a dramatic decrease in the number of microtubules embedded in the outer kinetochore surface and to a failure to accumulate cold-stable microtubules (27Howe M. McDonald K.L. Albertson D.G. Meyer B.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 28DeLuca J.G. Howell B.J. Canman J.C. Hickey J.M. Fang G. Salmon E.D. Curr.

Thus, the Ndc80 complex might be essential for the formation of stable kinetochore-microtubule interactions, suggestive of a direct role in microtubule binding or, alternatively, a role in a kinetochore assembly pathway, the impairment of which abrogates recruitment of other proteins required for microtubule binding. Indeed, the depletion/inactivation of the Ndc80 complex causes a corresponding kinetochore depletion or reduction of a group of proteins normally localized at or in the corona peripheral to the kinetochore outer plate, including the motor proteins dynein/dynactin and the spindle assembly checkpoint proteins Mps1, Mad1, Mad2, Zw10, and Rod. However, peripheral checkpoint proteins and motor proteins such as Bub1, BubR1, and CENP-E retain an essentially normal kinetochore localization under these conditions (23Bharadwaj R. Qi W. Yu H. J.

In summary, the Ndc80 complex plays a direct role in stabilizing the kinetochore-microtubule interface and in controlling the localization of a subset of proteins at or in the corona peripheral to the kinetochore outer plate, although its precise function in these processes remains unclear. The complexity of the putative microtubule-kinetochore interface is underscored by the recent discovery that the Ndc80 complex is part of an evolutionarily conserved protein assembly also containing the Mtw1-Mis12 complex and other proteins such as Zwint-1 and Spc105 (7Obuse C.

The role of the Ndc80 complex as a direct or indirect kinetochore receptor for Mps1, Mad1, Mad2, Zw10, and Rod might also explain the effects of Ndc80 depletion on the spindle assembly checkpoint. These effects range from complete inactivation to sustained activation followed by cell death, with a discrepancy that might be explained by the penetrance of the depletion phenotype (23Bharadwaj R.

Because of the complexity of kinetochore structure, the development of in vitro approaches using reconstituted kinetochore complexes will be invaluable to elucidate the mechanism of formation of kinetochore-microtubule interfaces. Here, we describe a step in this direction represented by the reconstitution and characterization of the human Ndc80 complex. We show that the reconstituted complex forms a quaternary assembly whose biophysical, biochemical, and biological properties are indistinguishable from those of the endogenous complex. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Hec1 Complex Constructs— All constructs for human Spc24, Spc25, Nuf2, and Hec1 subunits were generated by PCR using a human fetal thymus cDNA library (Invitrogen). Spc24, Spc25, Nuf2, and Hec1 sequences were subcloned in a modified pGEX-6P vector (pGEX-6P-2RBS) to support dicistronic expression. All constructs were sequenced. Protein expression in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) was induced with 400 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Expression was continued for ∼12–16 h at 18–20 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 15 min in a Beckman JLA 10.5 rotor and resuspended in 30–40 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 600 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Molecular Biochemicals) per liter of E. coli culture. After sonication, the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 45–60 min using a 55.1 Ti rotor. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) 1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; Alexa, Alexa Fluor 488; h (prefix), human; SEC, size exclusion chromatography; SFM, scanning force microscopy; WB, Western blotting. -Spc24-Spc25 and GST-Nuf2-Hec1 were purified using glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After 2–3 h of agitation at 4 °C, beads were washed with 30 volumes of lysis buffer and equilibrated with 30 volumes of cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The Spc24-Spc25 subcomplex was cleaved from GST with 10 units of PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) per milligram of substrate for 16 h at 4 °C. Simultaneously, the GST-Nuf2-Hec1 complex was expressed and purified as described above and incubated with the flow through of PreScission cleavage of the GST-Spc24-Spc25 complex. After forming a quaternary Ndc80 complex, PreScission protease was added to remove the GST moiety from Nuf2. The quaternary complex was collected in the flow through, concentrated up to 5 mg/ml by Vivaspin (molecular weight cut-off 30,000) and loaded onto a Superose 6 column equilibrated with size exclusion chromatography (SEC) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 600 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol). The final yield was estimated at ∼0.1 mg of pure complex per liter of bacteria. For binding assays and analytical SEC we also created the vectors pGEX-6P-Nuf2-(1–137), pGEX-6P-Nuf2-(1–386), pGEX-6P-Nuf2-(387–464), pAM3-His6-Hec1-(1–230), pAM3-His6-Hec1-(1–445), pAM3-His6-Hec1-(446–642), pGEX-6P-2RBS-Spc24-(1–131)·Spc25-(1–144), pGEX-6P-2RBS-hSpc24-(1–131)·hSpc25-(145–224), pGEX-6P-2RBS-hSpc24-(132–197)·hSpc25-(1–144), pGEX-6P-2RBS-hSpc24-(132–197)·hSpc25-(145–224), pGEX-6P-2RBS-GST-Nuf2-(1–386)·Hec1-(1–445), and pGEX-6P-2RBS-GST-Nuf2-(387–464)·Hec1-(446–642). These vectors were used for protein expression and purification essentially as described above for the quaternary Ndc80, except that the salt concentrations of buffers were usually kept at 300 mm NaCl. Hydrodynamic Analysis—Analytical SEC was performed on a SMART system (Amersham Biosciences) using a Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). Elution volumes of bovine thyroglobulin, rabbit aldolase, hen egg albumin, and ribonuclease A were plotted against their known Stokes radii (82.55, 46.15, 30.5, and 16.4 Å, respectively) to generate a calibration curve (R2 = 0.98) from which the Stokes radius of Ndc80 was determined. For glycerol velocity gradients, samples were loaded directly onto 12-ml 5–40% glycerol gradients prepared by layering eight 1.5-ml aliquots of gradient buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing a decreasing glycerol concentration. Centrifugation was protracted for 48 h at 40,000 rpm on a Beckman SW41Ti swinging bucket rotor at 4 °C. The gradient was fractionated in 300-μl fractions, the content of which was visualized by SDS-PAGE after precipitation with trichloroacetic acid. Chymotrypsinogen A (25-kDa monomer, 2.58 S), bovine serum albumin (60-kDa monomer, 4.22 S), aldolase (158-kDa tetramer, 7.4 S), and catalase (240-kDa tetramer, 11.3 S) were also analyzed and their elution plotted against the known Svedberg coefficient. The resulting calibration curve (R2 = 0.97) was used to determine the sedimentation coefficient (s) of the Ndc80 complex. The molecular weight was calculated from the Stokes radius (a) in Ångstroms and from s according to the equation molecular weight = αas (36Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar), where α = (6πη0N)/(1 - νρ), N is Avogadro's number (6.02 × 1023), η0 is the viscosity of medium (g/(cm·s)), ρ is the density of the medium (g/ml), and ν is the partial specific volume of the analyzed particle (ml/g). Because η0 and ρ values change according to the buffer composition and ν depends on the amino acidic composition, the α value was determined by plotting the molecular weights of standard proteins against their a × s values. The axial ratio of the prolate ellipsoid of rotation was calculated as described (37Harding S.E. Colfen H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). GST Pull-down Experiments—GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described above. Binding of the GST fusion proteins to their interacting partners fused to a hexahistidine (His6) tag was tested by anti-His tag Western blotting (WB). Each interaction was verified by at least three independent experiments. Binding Assay and Alexa Fluor 488 (Alexa) Labeling—Hec1-(1–445)·Nuf2-(1–386), Hec1-(446–642)·Nuf2-(387–464), Alexa-Spc24-(1–197)·Spc25-(1–224), and Alexa-Spc24-(70–197)·Spc25-(57–224) subcomplexes were analyzed on a Superdex™ 200 PC 3.2/30 SEC column. 35-μl fractions were collected, and their contents were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. To test the interaction of the the subcomplexes, Hec1-(1–445)·Nuf2-(1–386) or Hec1-(446–642)·Nuf2-(387–464) were incubated for 2 h on ice with Alexa-Spc24-(1–197)·Spc25-(1–224) or Alexa-Spc24-(70–197)·Spc25-(57–224). The reaction mixes were analyzed by SEC as described above. Proteins were labeled with Alexa-488 succimidyl ester reactive dye (Molecular Probes, Inc.) as described (38De Antoni A. Pearson C.G. Cimini D. Canman J.C. Sala V. Nezi L. Mapelli M. Sironi L. Faretta M. Salmon E.D. Musacchio A. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 214-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Cell Culture, Injections, and Microscopy—HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotic/antimycotic solution and cultured in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. The culture of PtK1 cells and microinjection techniques were described previously (39Howell B.J. Hoffman D.B. Fang G. Murray A.W. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1233-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). For microinjection experiments, cells were grown on acid-washed coverslips in 35-mm Petri dishes. Cells were microinjected with ∼1–5% cell volume of Alexa-labeled Spc24-Spc25 protein complex (at 86 μm needle concentration) or Alexa-labeled Hec1 complex (at 26 μm needle concentration) and then placed in Leibovitz's dye-free L-15 medium, pH 7.2 (Sigma), supplemented with 7 mm Hepes, 10% fetal bovine serum, an antibiotic/antimycotic solution, 4.5 g/liter glucose, and 0.45 units/ml Oxyrase (Oxyrase Inc., Mansfield, OH). HeLa cells injected with the Alexa-Spc24-Spc25 complex or the Alexa-Ndc80 complex were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and subsequently permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100. Alexa-Spc24–25-injected cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with Hec1 primary antibodies (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at a dilution of 1:750; Alexa-Ndc80-injected cells were incubated with CREST serum (Antibodies Inc., Davis, CA) at a dilution of 1:2000. The secondary antibodies used were rhodamine Red-X anti-mouse for Alexa-Spc24-Spc25 injected cells and rhodamine Red-X anti-human for Ndc80 complex-injected cells. Images were obtained using a Nikon 100×, 1.4 numerical aperture planapochromat oil immersion lens on a spinning disc confocal fluorescence microscope. For live cell imaging, cells on coverslips mounted into Rose chambers were imaged as described above. Scanning Force Microscopy—For imaging, 20 μl of a diluted Ndc80 complex reconstituted as described above was deposited on freshly cleaved mica. After ∼30 s the mica was washed with water (glass-distilled; Sigma) and exposed to a stream of filtered air. Images were obtained on a NanoScope IV (Digital Instruments; Santa Barbara, CA) operating in tapping mode in air with a type E scanner. Silicon nanotips were from Digital Instruments (Nanoprobes). Domain Structure of the Human Ndc80 Complex—To investigate the interactions connecting the four subunits of human Ndc80 we used a bacterial co-expression strategy. Dicistronic vectors were designed to express the first recombinant cistron as a C-terminal fusion to a His6 tag or to GST. The second cistron was expressed as an untagged protein or as a His6 tag fusion (when the first cistron was fused to GST). In co-expression experiments with the full-length proteins we determined that Nuf2-Hec1 and Spc24-Spc25 form two stable subcomplexes (see below). We exploited this observation to map the dimerization domains within each subcomplex by creating constructs expected to coincide with the predicted globular and coiled coil (40Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar) regions of Nuf2, Hec1, Spc24, and Spc25 shown in Fig. 1A. In a first set of experiments we tested the ability of His-Hec1-(1–445) to bind different regions of Nuf2 fused to GST. His-Hec1-(1–445) was co-expressed with GST, GST-Nuf2-(1–385), or GST-hNuf2-(386–464). Bacterial lysates were incubated with GSH-Sepharose, and any His-tagged Hec1 fusion protein bound to Nuf2 was detected by WB with an anti-His-tagged antibody. His-Hec1-(1–445) bound tightly to GST-Nuf2-(1–385) (Fig. 1B, lane 6) and not to GST or GST-hNuf2-(386–464) (lanes 3 and 9). This result identifies an interaction between the N-terminal regions of Nuf2 and Hec1. Next, we co-expressed His-Hec1-(446–642) with GST, GST-Nuf2-(1–385), or GST-hNuf2-(386–464). Interestingly, we found a tight interaction between His-Hec1-(446–642) and GST-hNuf2-(386–464) (lane 9), whereas no binding was observed to GST or GST-Nuf2-(1–385) (lanes 3 and 6). This experiment also indicated that GST-Nuf2-(1–385) undergoes severe proteolytic degradation, and that it is stabilized by its interaction with His-Hec1-(1–445) (compare lanes 6 in panels B and C). Finally, we failed to detect binding between the predicted N-terminal globular heads of Nuf2 and Hec1, GST-Nuf2-(1–137) and His-Hec1-(1–230) (not shown). In summary, the entire length of the coiled coils of Hec1 and Nuf2 is engaged in dimerization. The same approach was applied to Spc24-Spc25. First, we tested the ability of a His-tagged version of the N-terminal region of Spc25 (His-Spc25-(1–144)) to bind GST-tagged versions of the N- or C-terminal regions of Spc24 (GST-Spc24-(1–131) or GST-Spc24-(132–197)). His-Spc25-(1–144) bound tightly to GST-Spc24-(1–131) (Fig. 1D, lane 6). His-Spc25-(1–144) also bound reproducibly to GST-Spc24-(132–197) (Fig. 1D, lane 9), but this may be an artifact caused by the instability of GST-Spc24-(132–197), which undergoes severe proteolytic degradation. Next, we tested the predicted C-terminal globular domain of Spc25 (His-Spc25-(145–224)) against GST-Spc24-(1–131) and GST-Spc24-(132–197). His-Spc25-(145–224) bound weakly to GST-Spc24-(132–197) (Fig. 1E, lane 9). As explained above, this might also be an artifact caused by the instability of GST-Spc24-(132–197). However, at least a fraction of GST-Spc24-(132–197) was protected from degradation upon co-expression"
https://openalex.org/W2102293129,"The application of single molecules as templates for nanodevices is a promising direction for nanotechnology. We used a pair of suspended DNA molecules as templates for superconducting two-nanowire devices. Because the resulting wires are very thin, comparable to the DNA molecules themselves, they are susceptible to thermal fluctuations typical for one-dimensional superconductors and exhibit a nonzero resistance over a broad temperature range. We observed resistance oscillations in these two-nanowire structures that are different from the usual Little-Parks oscillations. Here, we provide a quantitative explanation for the observed quantum interference phenomenon, which takes into account strong phase gradients created in the leads by the applied magnetic field."
https://openalex.org/W2128931073,"Androgen has anabolic effects on cardiac myocytes and has been shown to enhance left ventricular enlargement and function. However, the physiological and patho-physiological roles of androgen in cardiac growth and cardiac stress-induced remodeling remains unclear. We aimed to clarify whether the androgen-nuclear androgen receptor (AR) system contributes to the cardiac growth and angiotensin II (Ang II)-stimulated cardiac remodeling by using systemic AR-null male mice. AR knock-out (ARKO) male mice, at 25 weeks of age, and age-matched wild-type (WT) male mice were treated with or without Ang II stimulation (2.0 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks. ARKO mice with or without Ang II stimulation showed a significant reduction in the heart-to-body weight ratio compared with those of WT mice. In addition, echocardiographic analysis demonstrated impairments of both the concentric hypertrophic response and left ventricular function in Ang II-stimulated ARKO mice. Western blot analysis of the myocardium revealed that activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2 and ERK5 by Ang II stimulation were lower in ARKO mice than those of WT mice. Ang II stimulation caused more prominent cardiac fibrosis in ARKO mice than in WT mice with enhanced expression of types I and III collagen and transforming growth factor-β1 genes and with increased Smad2 activation. These results suggest that, in male mice, the androgen-AR system participates in normal cardiac growth and modulates cardiac adaptive hypertrophy and fibrosis during the process of cardiac remodeling under hypertrophic stress. Androgen has anabolic effects on cardiac myocytes and has been shown to enhance left ventricular enlargement and function. However, the physiological and patho-physiological roles of androgen in cardiac growth and cardiac stress-induced remodeling remains unclear. We aimed to clarify whether the androgen-nuclear androgen receptor (AR) system contributes to the cardiac growth and angiotensin II (Ang II)-stimulated cardiac remodeling by using systemic AR-null male mice. AR knock-out (ARKO) male mice, at 25 weeks of age, and age-matched wild-type (WT) male mice were treated with or without Ang II stimulation (2.0 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks. ARKO mice with or without Ang II stimulation showed a significant reduction in the heart-to-body weight ratio compared with those of WT mice. In addition, echocardiographic analysis demonstrated impairments of both the concentric hypertrophic response and left ventricular function in Ang II-stimulated ARKO mice. Western blot analysis of the myocardium revealed that activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2 and ERK5 by Ang II stimulation were lower in ARKO mice than those of WT mice. Ang II stimulation caused more prominent cardiac fibrosis in ARKO mice than in WT mice with enhanced expression of types I and III collagen and transforming growth factor-β1 genes and with increased Smad2 activation. These results suggest that, in male mice, the androgen-AR system participates in normal cardiac growth and modulates cardiac adaptive hypertrophy and fibrosis during the process of cardiac remodeling under hypertrophic stress. Androgen exerts a variety of biological effects in many target organs, including male genitalia, brain, and skeletal tissues (1Mooradian A.D. Morley J.E. Korenman S.G. Endocr.

Most of these actions are mediated through the transcriptional control of particular sets of target genes by the nuclear androgen receptor (AR). 1The abbreviations used are: AR, nuclear androgen receptor; ARKO, AR knockout; WT, wild-type; Ang II, angiotensin II; HW, heart weight; BW, body weight; CSA, cross-sectional area; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; ANP, A-type natriuretic peptide; BNP, B-type natriuretic peptide; αMHC, α-myosin heavy chain; βMHC, β-myosin heavy chain; AT1aR, angiotensin II type 1a receptor; AT2R, angiotensin II type 2 receptor; TGF-β1, transforming growth factor β1; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; LV, left ventricular; LVDd, left ventricular diastolic dimension; LVM, left ventricular mass; RWT, relative wall thickness; FS, fractional shortening.1The abbreviations used are: AR, nuclear androgen receptor; ARKO, AR knockout; WT, wild-type; Ang II, angiotensin II; HW, heart weight; BW, body weight; CSA, cross-sectional area; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; ANP, A-type natriuretic peptide; BNP, B-type natriuretic peptide; αMHC, α-myosin heavy chain; βMHC, β-myosin heavy chain; AT1aR, angiotensin II type 1a receptor; AT2R, angiotensin II type 2 receptor; TGF-β1, transforming growth factor β1; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; LV, left ventricular; LVDd, left ventricular diastolic dimension; LVM, left ventricular mass; RWT, relative wall thickness; FS, fractional shortening. AR is a ligand-inducible transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily (3Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M.

Upon hormone binding, AR is translocated from the cytosol into the nucleus where it binds specific promoter elements. A number of coregulators and/or coregulator complexes are then recruited to AR, which then activates or represses the transcription of various target genes (2Wilson J.D. Endocr.

To clarify the physiological function of androgen via AR transcriptional regulation, we generated AR knock-out (ARKO) mice by means of the Cre-loxP system and have reported that ARKO male mice manifest late-onset obesity (8Sato T.

In addition to the classic target tissues of androgens, the AR gene is also expressed in mammalian cardiomyocytes, suggesting that androgens may play a role in the heart (11Marsh J.D. Lehmann M.H. Ritchie R.H. Gwathmey J.K. Green G.E. Schiebinger R.J. Circulation. 1998; 98: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In fact, Marsh and colleagues (11Marsh J.D. Lehmann M.H. Ritchie R.H. Gwathmey J.K. Green G.E. Schiebinger R.J. Circulation. 1998; 98: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) have shown that androgens produce cardiac hypertrophy by a direct, receptor-specific mechanism. They also revealed that androgens regulate functional expression of an L-type calcium channel in isolated rat ventricular myocytes, leading to a modulation of cardiac performance in males (12Golden K.L.

Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 951-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) reported that either castration or flutamide, an AR antagonist, markedly attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in guanylyl cyclase-A knock-out male mice. These previous studies have helped in delineating the influence of the androgen-AR system in the heart. However, to prove the physiological and pathophysiological roles of the androgen-AR system on cardiac structure and function, in vitro experiments as well as in vivo studies using pharmacological manipulations have limitations. In the present study, to define the biological significance of cardiac AR function, we carried out studies using ARKO male mice. We obtained in vivo evidence that the androgen-AR system plays a pivotal role in normal cardiac growth and in cardiac protection against angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced cardiac fibrosis in male mice. Animal Preparation—ARKO male mice were generated by targeted disruption of the AR gene using the Cre-loxP system. ARKO male mice with C57BL6/CBA hybrid backgrounds were generated and maintained as previously reported (8Sato T. Matsumoto T. Yamada T. Watanabe T. Kawano H. Kato S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 9Kawano H. Sato T. Yamada T. Matsumoto T. Sekine K. Watanabe T. Nakamura T. Fukuda T. Yoshimura K. Yoshizawa T. Aihara K.

U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1673-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In ARKO male mice, testicular androgen production seemed to be severely impaired, leading to a reduction in serum gonadal androgen levels, whereas serum adrenal androgen and estrogen levels remained normal (9Kawano H. Sato T. Yamada T. Matsumoto T. Sekine K. Watanabe T. Nakamura T. Fukuda T. Yoshimura K. Yoshizawa T. Aihara K. Yamamoto Y. Nakamichi Y. Metzger D. Chambon P. Nakamura K. Kawaguchi H. Kato S. Proc.

We used littermate wild-type (WT) male mice and ARKO male mice in this study and divided these mice into four groups; WT male mice with or without Ang II stimulation and ARKO male mice with or without Ang II stimulation. Ang II (WAKO, Japan) dissolved in saline was continuously and subcutaneously infused at a rate of 2.0 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks using an osmotic minipump (Alzet model 1002, Alza Corp., Mountain View, CA). Experiments were conducted in these male mice at 25 weeks of age. All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Research Committee, The University of Tokushima Graduate School. Measurements of Blood Pressure and Heart Rate—Systolic blood pressure and heart rate were measured using a noninvasive computerized tail-cuff system (BP98A Softron Corp., Tokyo, Japan) at 2 weeks after pump implantation. Unanesthetized mice from each group were placed in a holding device mounted on a thermostatically controlled warming plate, maintained at 37 °C. Systolic blood pressure and heart rate were measured on two consecutive days, and at least 10 readings were taken for each measurement. Echocardiographic Analysis—Transthoracic echocardiography was performed using a 15-MHz imaging transducer (Aplio 80 Toshiba Medical Systems Co. Ltd., Japan). Mice from each group were anesthetized by peritoneal injection with 20 mg/kg of 2.5% pentobarbital. The left hemithorax of each mouse was carefully shaved, and M-mode images of the left ventricle were recorded. Left ventricular anterior wall thickness (AW), left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVDd), left ventricular end-systolic dimension (LVDs), and left ventricular posterior wall thickness (PW) were measured. All measurements were performed using the leading edge-to-leading edge convention adopted by the American Society of Echocardiography. Percent fractional shortening (FS), left ventricular mass (LVM), and relative wall thickness (RWT) were calculated as follows: FS = ((LVDd - LVDs)/LVDd) × 100, LVM = 1.05 × ((LVDd + AW + PW)3/1000 - LVDd3/1000 + 0.6) and RWT = (AW + PW)/LVDd. Determination of Heart-to-Body Weight Ratio and Histological Analysis—At the end of pump infusion, mice from each group were anesthetized, and the hearts were excised. The weight of the whole heart (HW) was measured, and the ratio of HW to body weight (HW/BW) was calculated. The whole heart was resected and placed in 20% neutral buffered formalin overnight. After fixation, samples were embedded in paraffin. Then 3-μm sections were cut and stained. The cross-sectional areas of LV myocytes were measured on the mid free wall of the LV from sections stained with hematoxylin/eosin. Suitable cross-sectional areas were defined as having nearly circular capillary profiles and nuclei. Approximately 100 cells were counted in each section, and the average area was used for analysis. To calculate the ratio of the interstitial fibrosis area in the left ventricular area, excluding perivascular fibrosis, samples were stained with Masson-Trichrome and 10 fields were randomly selected from 3 individual sections. Measurements of both the cross-sectional area, and collagen fraction volume ratio were performed using Image J 1.29, a free software program. Western Blot Analysis—Activities of extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2), ERK5, also referred to as big mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase 1, and Smad2 were measured by Western blot analysis as described previously (14Nishiyama A.

For evaluation of activated ERK1/2, ERK5, and Smad2, phosphospecific ERK1/2 antibody, phosphospecific ERK5 antibody, and phosphospecific Smad2 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) were used, respectively. For Western blot analysis, protein extracts (30 μg for ERK1/2 and ERK5 and 150 μg for Smad2) from the hearts of WT and ARKO mice were boiled for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer and then run on SDS-PAGE. The protein extracts were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond™-ECL, Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween 20. The blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies for phosphospecific ERK1/2, phosphospecific ERK5, and phosphospecific Smad2, followed by incubation for 1 h with anti-rabbit secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugate). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences) treatment and exposure to Hyperfilm-ECL. The intensity of the bands was measured using Image J version 1.29. Northern Blots Analysis—Procedures were performed as previously described (16Aihara K. Azuma H. Akaike M. Ikeda Y. Yamashita M. Sudo T. Hayashi H. Yamada Y. Endoh F. Fujimura M. Yoshida T. Yamaguchi H. Hashizume S. Kato M. Yoshimura K. Yamamoto Y. Kato S. Matsumoto T. J. Biol.

RNA concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically at 260 nm, and samples were stored in diethyl dicarbonate-treated water at -80 °C. Approximately 20 μg of total RNA from each sample was fractionated on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to Hybond nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences) by capillary action in a high salt solution (20 × SSC). Blots were prehybridized in a hybridization solution for 1 h at 42 °C, followed by overnight hybridization with digoxigenin-labeled specific oligonucleotide probes (DIG Northern Starter Kit, Roche Applied Science). Blots were washed twice in 2 × SSC/0.1% SDS at room temperature for 5 min and then washed twice in 0.2 × SSC/0.1% SDS at 68 °C for 15 min before exposure to x-ray film. Evaluation of mRNA levels encoding A-type natriuretic peptide (ANP), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), α-myosin heavy chain (αMHC), β-myosin heavy chain (βMHC), and collagen types I and III was performed. Quantification of mRNA levels was estimated after correction for loading differences by measuring the amount of 28 S rRNA. The intensity of the bands was also measured using Image J version 1.29.

In brief, total RNA isolated from heart tissue was used for cDNA synthesis. A cDNA was prepared from 1 μg of total RNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), used for random hexamers, dNTPs, and first-strand cDNA synthesis, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amplification reaction was performed in a final volume of 20 μl in 96-well optical reaction plates (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The PCR mixture contained 50 ng of cDNA, 1 μl of 0.1 nm forward and reverse primer mix, and 13 μl of SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), which contains the fluorescent dye SYBR Green. Assays were performed with an ABI Prism 7500 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems). The dye exhibits fluorescence enhancement upon binding to double-stranded DNA, and the enhancement of fluorescence is proportional to the initial concentration of the cDNA. Amplification included one stage of 2 min at 50 °C and one stage of 10 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of a three-step loop: 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 54 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. A melting curve was used to identify a temperature where only the amplicon, and not primer dimers, accounted for the SYBR green-bound fluorescence. Results were analyzed with the SDS7500 software, and all values were normalized to levels of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH). Oligonucleotide primers used in this study are shown in Table I. Statistical Analysis—Values for each parameter within a group were expressed as a mean ± S.E. For comparisons among groups, statistical significance was assessed using a one-way analysis of variance, and the significance of each difference was determined by post hoc testing using Tukey-Kramer's method. These analyses were performed on an Apple Macintosh computer with the use of Excel (Microsoft X) and Stat View statistical package (Stat View 5.0, SAS Institute Inc.) (17Aihara K. Azuma H. Takamori N. Kanagawa Y. Akaike M. Fujimura M. Yoshida T. Hashizume S. Kato M. Yamaguchi H. Kato S. Ikeda Y. Arase T. Kondo A. Matsumoto T. Circulation. 2004; 109: 2761-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Statistical significance was considered at p < 0.05. Blood Pressure and Heart Rate—Basal levels of systolic blood pressure in WT mice were similar to those of ARKO mice. Systolic blood pressure levels in both WT and ARKO mice were significantly increased by Ang II stimulation, but there was no statistical difference between the two groups (Table II). There was no significant difference in heart rate between WT and ARKO mice, and Ang II stimulation did not affect heart rate in either group (Table II).Table IISystolic blood pressure, heart rate, and heart-to-body weight ratio Values are means ± S.E.

Although Ang II stimulation caused an increase in both cardiac size (Fig. 1, A and B) and the HW/BW ratio (Table II) in WT and ARKO mice, these values were still lower in ARKO mice than in WT mice. Cross-sections of the heart demonstrated that LV volume and wall thickness in ARKO mice were reduced compared with those in WT mice (Fig. 1B). In addition, Ang II stimulation could elicit a prominent cardiac hypertrophy in WT mice, whereas the cardiac LV volume and wall thickening after Ang II stimulation was still lower in ARKO mice compared with those in WT mice (Fig. 1B). Histomorphometric analyses of the LV tissues showed that the cross-sectional area of cardiomyocytes without Ang II stimulation was significantly smaller in ARKO mice than in WT mice (Fig. 1D). Although Ang II stimulation caused an increase in the cross-sectional area of the cardiomyocytes in both WT and ARKO mice, the cross-sectional area after Ang II stimulation was again smaller in ARKO mice than in WT mice (Fig. 1D). Exacerbated Cardiac Fibrosis by Ang II Stimulation in ARKO Male Mice—The collagen fraction volume ratio calculated from histomorphometric analyses of Masson-Trichrome-stained specimens revealed that cardiac fibrosis was faintly present in LV tissues of WT and ARKO mice without Ang II stimulation. Ang II stimulation elicited a markedly enhanced fibrotic change in LV tissues of ARKO mice compared with those of WT mice (Fig. 1, B, C, and E). However, Ang II administration did not cause an obvious progression of cardiac fibrosis in both WT and ARKO mice when the experiments were conducted at 8 weeks instead of 25 weeks of age (data not shown). Analyses of Cardiac Structure—Echocardiographic studies revealed that Ang II stimulation caused a significant increase in the values of AW and PW in both WT and ARKO mice (mean ± S.E. mm; AW: 0.86 ± 0.03 to 1.15 ± 0.01 in WT and 0.60 ± 0.02 to 0.70 ± 0.02 in ARKO mice; PW: 0.88 ± 0.03 to 1.13 ± 0.03 in WT and 0.68 ± 0.02 to 0.72 ± 0.02 in ARKO mice), whereas there was no statistically significant change in LVM/BW and RWT by Ang II stimulation in ARKO mice. Furthermore, although the values of LVDd and LVDs were decreased in Ang II-stimulated WT mice due to their concentric hypertrophy, these values did not change or even slightly increase in ARKO mice by Ang II stimulation (Fig. 2). Ang II-stimulated Cardiac Dysfunction in ARKO Male Mice—We also evaluated the cardiac performance of these mice using echocardiography. Although left ventricular FS, a marker of systolic function, was not significantly different between WT and ARKO mice, Ang II stimulation significantly attenuated LV systolic function in ARKO mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 2). Ang II-stimulated Cardiac ERK1/2 and ERK5 Activations Were Decreased in ARKO Male Mice—Because MAP kinase pathways have been shown to be involved in cardiac hypertrophy (18Bueno O.F. De Windt L.J.

Circulation. 2004; 110: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), we examined effects of Ang II stimulation on ERK1/2 and ERK5 activities. Ang II stimulation caused a significant increase in cardiac ERK1/2 and ERK5 phosphorylation in WT mice, whereas Ang II stimulation did not significantly enhance MAP kinase phosphorylation in ARKO mice (Fig. 3). Phosphorylation of other MAP kinases, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and p38, by Ang II were not observed in either WT or ARKO mice (data not shown). These results suggest that the blunted response to Ang II stimulation in ERK1/2 and ERK5 activities may be at least in part related to the aberrant cardiac hypertrophic response and cardiac dysfunction in ARKO mice. Aberrant Gene Expression of Cardiac Remodeling Factors in ARKO Male Mice—As shown in Fig. 4, the basal gene expression levels of BNP, MHCs, and types I and III collagen were not different between WT and ARKO mice. The ANP mRNA level was slightly lower in ARKO mice than in WT mice. Although Ang II stimulation markedly enhanced the expression levels of ANP and BNP mRNA in both WT and ARKO mice, the expression level of ANP mRNA was increased more in ARKO mice than in WT mice. Ang II stimulation did not affect αMHC mRNA levels in either WT or ARKO mice, but enhanced βMHC mRNA expression only in WT mice. Ang II stimulation enhanced both type I and III collagen mRNA expression levels in WT and ARKO mice, but the enhancement was more pronounced in ARKO mice. Although there were no significant differences in the AT1aR and AT2R mRNA levels between WT and ARKO mice with or without Ang II stimulation, ARKO mice showed a tendency for higher expression in these mRNA levels than WT mice in the presence or absence of Ang II stimulation (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Effects of AR deficiency on the gene expression of AT1aR (left), AT2R (middle), and TGF-β1(right) with or without Ang II stimulation. The real-time PCR analyses of each parameter were performed in WT (white bars) and ARKO (black bars) male mice. Values were normalized by arbitrarily setting the measurement of control (WT male mice without Ang II) to 1.0. Values are expressed as mean ± S.E. *, p < 0.05, each group n = 12.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) TGF-β1 Expression and Smad Pathway Were Activated in ARKO Mice by Ang II Stimulation—TGF-β1 has been identified as a contributor of cardiac fibrosis (21Weber K.T. Semin. Nephrol. 1997; 17: 467-491PubMed Google Scholar), and Ang II is known to affect TGF-β1 expression (22Campbell S.E. Katwa L.C. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1997; 29: 1947-1958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Upon binding of TGF-β1 to its receptor, phosphorylation of Smad2 and its subsequent translocation to the nucleus is a critical step in TGF-β1 signaling pathway (23Massague J. Weis-Garcia F. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 41-64PubMed Google Scholar, 24Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effects of Ang II on TGF-β1 expression and Smad2 activation. Although Ang II stimulation significantly enhanced cardiac TGF-β1 mRNA levels in both WT and ARKO mice, the degree of enhancement of its gene expression was more augmented in ARKO mice than in WT mice (Fig. 5). Consistent with the increase in TGF-β1 mRNA expression, Ang II stimulation also caused a significant increase in cardiac Smad2 phosphorylation in both WT and ARKO mice with more Smad2 phosphorylation in ARKO than in WT mice (Fig. 6). Increased cardiac mass, used synonymously with cardiac hypertrophy, is one of the important cardiovascular risk factors (25Hayward C.S. Webb C.M. Collins P.

https://openalex.org/W1976279799,"Eukaryotic DNA polymerase δ (Pol δ) plays an essential role in replicating large nuclear genomes, a process that must be accurate to maintain stability over many generations. Based on kinetic studies of insertion of individual dNTPs opposite a template guanine, Pol δ is believed to have high selectivity for inserting correct nucleotides. This high selectivity, in conjunction with an intrinsic 3′-exonuclease activity, implies that Pol δ should have high base substitution fidelity. Here we demonstrate that the wild type Saccharomyces cerevisiae three-subunit Pol δ does indeed have high base substitution fidelity for the 12 possible base-base mismatches, producing on average less than 1.3 stable misincorporations/100,000 nucleotides polymerized. Measurements with exonuclease-deficient Pol δ confirm the high nucleotide selectivity of the polymerase and further indicate that proofreading enhances the base substitution fidelity of the wild type enzyme by at least 60-fold. However, Pol δ inefficiently proofreads single nucleotide deletion mismatches in homopolymeric runs, such that the error rate is 30 single nucleotide deletions/100,000 nucleotides polymerized. Moreover, wild type Pol δ frequently deletes larger numbers of nucleotides between distantly spaced direct repeats of three or more base pairs. Although wild type Pol δ and Pol ϵ both have high base substitution fidelity, Pol δ is much less accurate than Pol ϵ for deletions involving repetitive sequences. Thus, strand slippage during replication by wild type Pol δ may be a primary source of insertion and deletion mutagenesis in eukaryotic genomes.

Thus, strand slippage during replication by wild type Pol δ may be a primary source of insertion and deletion mutagenesis in eukaryotic genomes. DNA polymerases are involved in replication of nuclear and mitochondrial chromosomes, DNA repair, recombination, somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes, and cell cycle checkpoint control (1Hubscher U. Maga G. Spadari S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 133-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 2Shcherbakova P.V. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Sci.

Among these many tasks, by far the most DNA synthesis occurs during replication of large eukaryotic nuclear genomes. Three eukaryotic DNA polymerases are required for normal chromosomal DNA replication: DNA polymerases α (Pol α), 1The abbreviations used are: Pol α, δ, and ϵ, DNA polymerase α, δ, and ϵ, respectively; Exo-, exonuclease-deficient; Exo+, exonuclease-proficient; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; wt, wild type.1The abbreviations used are: Pol α, δ, and ϵ, DNA polymerase α, δ, and ϵ, respectively; Exo-, exonuclease-deficient; Exo+, exonuclease-proficient; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; wt, wild type. δ (Pol δ), and ϵ (Pol ϵ). Pol α is responsible for limited synthesis to initiate replication at origins and to prime Okazaki fragments, whereas Pol δ is responsible for their elongation and maturation (for review, see Ref. 4Garg P. Burgers P.M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 40: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Several studies assign Pol ϵ as the leading strand DNA polymerase, although exceptions to this rule have been documented (4Garg P. Burgers P.M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 40: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar).Accurate DNA synthesis during replication is essential for maintaining genomic stability over many generations (5Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16895-16898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The ability of Pol δ and Pol ϵ, which are responsible for most replication, to copy DNA accurately is enhanced by an intrinsic 3′-exonuclease activity that both enzymes possess. The importance of accurate DNA replication has prompted several studies of DNA synthesis fidelity by Pol α, Pol δ, and Pol ϵ. Studies conducted before recombinant enzymes were available, using polymerases purified from mammalian tissues, demonstrated that the catalytic subunits of Pol α (6Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13581-13587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kunkel T.A. Alexander P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 160-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Pol ϵ (at that time referred to as Pol δ-II) (8Kunkel T.A. Sabatino R.D. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4865-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and Pol δ (9Thomas D.C. Roberts J.D. Sabatino R.D. Myers T.W. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. So A.G. Bambara R.A. Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11751-11759Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) can all synthesize DNA accurately. However, Pol δ and Pol ϵ were more accurate than Pol α, and their fidelity was reduced in reactions containing high dNTP or dNMP concentrations (8Kunkel T.A. Sabatino R.D. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4865-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 9Thomas D.C. Roberts J.D. Sabatino R.D. Myers T.W. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. So A.G. Bambara R.A. Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11751-11759Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), conditions that partially diminish proofreading by their intrinsic 3′-exonuclease activities.The importance of proofreading to eukaryotic replication fidelity was demonstrated further by genetic studies showing elevated mutation rates in yeast and mouse cells containing mutations that inactivate the 3′-exonuclease activity of Pol δ (10Morrison A. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Sugino A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1467-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 11Morrison A. Sugino A. Mol. Gen.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the availability of exonuclease-deficient polymerase mutants allows for purification of both wild type and exonuclease-deficient forms of Pol δ (14Burgers P.M. Gerik K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19756-19762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and Pol ϵ (15Chilkova O. Jonsson B.H. Johansson E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14082-14086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These polymerases are multisubunit complexes that contain the polymerase/exonuclease catalytic subunits (125 kDa for Pol δ, 256 kDa for Pol ϵ) physically associated with accessory subunits (55- and 40-kDa subunits for Pol δ or 80-, 34-, and 29-kDa subunits for Pol ϵ). Determination of the fidelity of DNA synthesis by these exonuclease-deficient enzyme complexes defines the inherent nucleotide selectivity of each polymerase active site. These fidelity measurements can then be compared with those of wild type, exonuclease-proficient complexes to describe the apparent contribution of proofreading to replication fidelity. The contribution of proofreading deduced in this manner is more definitive than early reports for mammalian enzymes mentioned above, which relied on altered reaction conditions that only partially diminish proofreading.Replication fidelity is usually quantified in one of two ways. The first is illustrated by several recent studies that reported steady-state kinetic parameters for Pol δ insertion of individual correct (16Einolf H.J. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16316-16322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17Chen X. Zuo S. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14207-14213Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) nucleotides using an oligonucleotide primer-template. These studies indicate that Schizosaccharomyces pombe Pol δ (in the presence of Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein, PCNA, and replication factor C) (17Chen X. Zuo S. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17677-17682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and S. cerevisiae Pol δ (either in the absence or presence of PCNA) (18Hashimoto K. Shimizu K. Nakashima N. Sugino A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14207-14213Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) both efficiently discriminate against misinsertion of dAMP, dGMP, and dTMP opposite a specific template guanine. Somewhat surprisingly, however, S. pombe Pol δ did not efficiently proofread any of the three mismatches, and S. cerevisiae Pol δ failed to proofread two of the three mismatches efficiently, leading to the conclusion that wild type S. cerevisiae Pol δ has lower fidelity than wild type Pol ϵ for single base misincorporations.A second approach gives a more comprehensive view of replication fidelity. A single-stranded gapped region of M13mp2 is filled by a polymerase in the presence of all four dNTPs, and polymerase errors are scored by M13 plaque colors. This forward mutation assay permits a quantitative description of base substitution and insertion/deletion error rates at numerous template positions, representing all 12 possible base-base mismatches and a variety of different insertions and deletions in numerous sequence contexts. Using this approach, we have previously described the fidelity of the four-subunit S. cerevisiae Pol α-primase complex (19Kunkel T.A. Hamatake R.K. Motto-Fox J. Fitzgerald M.P. Sugino A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4447-4458Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and the fidelity of the four-subunit, wild type and exonuclease-deficient forms of S. cerevisiae Pol ϵ (20Shcherbakova P.V. Pavlov Y.I. Chilkova O. Rogozin I.B. Johansson E. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43770-43780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The present study reports the fidelity of the third major replicative polymerase from S. cerevisiae, the three-subunit, wild type and exonuclease-deficient forms of Pol δ. Given the inefficient proofreading of mismatches by yeast Pol δ observed in the kinetic studies mentioned above, we investigated whether wild type yeast Pol δ proofreads mismatched intermediates in a complete synthesis reaction that contains all four deoxynucleoside triphosphates and requires both nucleotide misinsertion and primer extension to score errors. In addition, we determined the extent to which proofreading corrects specific base-base mismatches and insertion/deletion errors in different sequence contexts. Understanding Pol δ fidelity and proofreading ability is important because loss of Pol δ proofreading can have serious consequences. For example, mice homozygous for exonuclease-deficient Pol δ develop tumors at a high rate (13Goldsby R.E. Hays L.E. Chen X. Olmsted E.A. Slayton W.B. Spangrude G.J. Preston B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Gerik K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19756-19762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) in two forms, the wild type exonuclease-proficient enzyme complex and a complex deficient in 3′-exonuclease activity because of the D321A/E323A double amino acid replacement, designated pol3-01 (10Morrison A. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Sugino A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1467-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 22Simon M. Giot L. Faye G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2165-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). All materials for fidelity assays were from sources described previously (20Shcherbakova P.V. Pavlov Y.I. Chilkova O.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).Exonuclease Assays—The 3′-exonuclease activity of the enzyme preparations was measured using a DNA template-primer formed by annealing the 32P-5′-end-labeled 18-mer 5′-TGA CCA TGT ACA TCA GAA-3′ and the 36-mer 3′-ACT GGT ACA TGT AGT CTT AGC CTG CAT ATA GTC ACT-5′. Reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained 0, 1, 2, 5, or 20 nm Pol δ, 10 nm DNA, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 75 mm NaCl, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and either 0 or 50 μm each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min, mixed with 10 μl of formamide dye solution, and subjected to electrophoresis on a denaturing 7 m urea and 12% acrylamide gel in 89 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, and 2.5 mm EDTA.Polymerase Fidelity Assays—DNA synthesis fidelity was measured using several bacteriophage M13mp2 gap filling assays as described previously, but using gel-purified gapped substrates (23Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Double-stranded M13mp2 DNA with a single-stranded region containing a portion of the lacZ gene was used a substrate for in vitro DNA synthesis. For Pol δ, reaction mixtures contained 0.15 nm DNA template, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 250 μm dNTPs, and 9 nm exonuclease-deficient or 64 nm wild type Pol δ. For Pol ϵ, reaction mixtures contained 0.15 nm DNA template, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 8 mm magnesium chloride, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 250 μm dNTPs, and 0.6 nm exonuclease-deficient or 2.2 nm wild type Pol ϵ. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for up to 60 min. Polymerase concentrations and reaction times were chosen such that the entire single-stranded region of each substrate was filled by the polymerase. Reaction mixtures were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm that gap filling was complete. Aliquots of DNA from each reaction were introduced into E. coli, which were plated as described to score M13 plaque colors that reflect either correct synthesis or errors made during in vitro DNA synthesis (23Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).The forward mutation assay utilizes a DNA substrate containing a 407-nucleotide gap with the wild type lacZ sequence that encodes a blue plaque phenotype. This substrate allows for detection of many different base substitution and frameshift errors that yield light blue and colorless plaques. To define specific errors, single-stranded DNA was isolated from independent mutant plaques, and the lacZ gene was sequenced using either an ABI Prism 377 or ABI Prism 3100 sequencer. Error rates for individual types of mutation were calculated according to Equation 1ER=((Nt/N)×MF)/(D × 0.6)(eq.1) where Ni is the number of mutations of a particular type, N is the total number of mutants analyzed, MF is frequency of lacZ mutants, D is the number of detectable sites for the particular type of mutation, and 0.6 is the probability of expressing a mutant lacZ allele in E. coli (23Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).Reversion assays were employed using substrates with similar size gaps prepared from M13mp2 phage with preexisting mutations that result in colorless plaques. With these assays, polymerase errors are scored as blue plaque revertants. Reversion substrates contained either a TGA stop codon that reverts via a polymerase-generated base substitution error, or a run of three, five, or seven T nucleotides that reverts via a single nucleotide deletion. Error rate calculations for reversion substrates were performed as above, with Ni/N representing the fraction of mutations observed within the target sequence (i.e. TGA codon or T nucleotide run).RESULTSExonuclease Activity of Wild Type and Mutant Pol δ—The three-subunit Pol δ was purified from S. cerevisiae in two forms, the wild type exonuclease-proficient enzyme complex and a complex containing a D321A/E323A double amino acid replacement in the catalytic subunit (10Morrison A. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Sugino A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1467-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 14Burgers P.M. Gerik K.J. J. Biol.

This double mutation, corresponding to the pol3-01 allele, previously has been shown to inactivate 3′-exonuclease function (12Jin Y.H. Obert R. Burgers P.M. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Gordenin D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5122-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 18Hashimoto K. Shimizu K. Nakashima N. Sugino A.

To assess the exonuclease activity of the current wild type and pol3-01 enzyme preparations, their ability to degrade the primer strand of an oligonucleotide template-primer was examined. As expected, the 3′-exonuclease of wild type yeast Pol δ degraded the primer in the absence of dNTPs (Fig. 1). In the presence of dNTPs, a small amount of exonucleolytic degradation by the wild type enzyme was observed, but the major products, including a full-length 36-mer, resulted from polymerization (Fig. 1). In contrast, no exonuclease activity was observed for the pol3-01 enzyme preparation (Fig. 1). This lack of exonuclease activity confirms that the pol3-01 mutant enzyme preparation used here is exonuclease-deficient. The pol3-01 enzyme was active as a polymerase in the presence of dNTPs and even generated a product that was one nucleotide longer than the template (arrow in Fig. 1), an end-addition product characteristic of exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerases (24Clark J.M. Joyce C.M. Beardsley G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 25Clark J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9677-9686Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Also notable are the variable band intensities of different chain lengths (e.g. compare the bands with asterisks with their neighbors in Fig. 1), indicating that the wild type and exonuclease-deficient Pol δ catalytic subunits both have difficulty replicating certain template sequences despite the presence of the p55 and p40 accessory subunits.Fidelity of Wild Type and Exonuclease-deficient Pol δ—Previous studies reported steady-state kinetic parameters only for insertion of a single correct or incorrect nucleotide opposite a single template guanine by Pol δ (17Chen X. Zuo S. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17677-17682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 18Hashimoto K. Shimizu K. Nakashima N. Sugino A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14207-14213Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, to obtain a comprehensive view of rates for a variety of substitution and insertion/deletion errors in numerous sequence contexts, we determined the fidelity of wild type and exonuclease-deficient Pol δ during gap filling DNA synthesis in the M13mp2 forward mutation assay. Both forms of Pol δ completely copied the lacZ template sequence within a 407-nucleotide single-stranded DNA gap (data not shown, but indistinguishable from Fig. 3 in Ref. 23Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). When the products of these reactions were introduced into E. coli cells, lacZ mutant frequencies among the M13mp2 plaques were 0.0047 for wild type Pol δ and 0.023 for exonuclease-deficient Pol δ (Table I, average of duplicate measurements). Mutant plaques were selected, and their DNA was sequenced to identify the nucleotide changes responsible for the phenotypes (Fig. 2). Using this information, the rates for specific classes of errors were calculated (see “Experimental Procedures”), and error rates for the two enzymes were compared to establish the contribution of nucleotide selectivity and proofreading to fidelity (Table I and described below).Fig. 3Base substitution error rates of exonuclease-deficient Pol δ and Pol ϵ. Individual base-base mispair error rates are shown for Pol α (black bars), exonuclease-deficient Pol δ (gray bars), and exonuclease-deficient Pol ϵ (open bars). Some error rates are reported as less than or equal to values (indicated by an asterisk above the bar). All data are from the forward mutation assay. Data for Pol δ are presented in Fig. 2.

The lacZ(+) strand is shown, with the transcriptional start site designated as position 1 and the first 53 codons displayed as triplets. The gapped region ends at position 191.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Base Substitutions—The mutations identified in DNA products generated by wild type Pol δ included only nine base substitutions (Table I), such that the substitution frequency was not significantly higher than the background of the assay (see Footnote a of Table I). The average error rate is ≤1.3 × 10-5, i.e. wild type Pol δ generates less than one single base substitution error for every 80,000 nucleotides polymerized. In contrast, exonuclease-deficient Pol δ generated base substitutions at many different template positions (Fig. 2), reflecting all possible mismatches except for C-dCTP. The average base substitution error rate is 13 × 10-5, at least 10-fold higher than for wild type Pol δ. Error rates were also calculated individually for the 12 different mismatches, each of which can be scored at between 9 and 27 template nucleotides in the lacZ mutational target. These rates varied over more than a 12-fold range, from the highest rate of 14 × 10-5 for T-dGTP to the lowest rate of ≤1.1 × 10-5 for C-dCTP (Fig. 3). Comparisons with previous results for yeast Pol α (19Kunkel T.A. Hamatake R.K. Motto-Fox J. Fitzgerald M.P. Sugino A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4447-4458Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which is naturally exonuclease-deficient, and an exonuclease-deficient derivative of yeast Pol ϵ (20Shcherbakova P.V. Pavlov Y.I.

Nucleases and polymerases are required to promote accurate NHEJ when the terminal bases of the DSB are damaged. The same enzymes also participate in imprecise rejoining and joining of incompatible ends, important mutagenic events. Previous work has shown that the Pol X family polymerase Pol4 is required for some but not all NHEJ events that require gap filling in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we systematically analyzed DSB end configurations and found that gaps on both strands and overhang polarity are the principal factors that determine whether a joint requires Pol4. DSBs with 3′-overhangs and a gap on each strand strongly depended on Pol4 for repair, DSBs with 5′-overhangs of the same sequence did not. Pol4 was not required when 3′-overhangs contained a gap on only one strand, however. Pol4 was equally required at 3′-overhangs of all lengths within the NHEJ-dependent range but was dispensable outside of this range, indicating that Pol4 is specific to NHEJ. Loss of Pol4 did not affect the rejoining of DSBs that utilized a recessed microhomology or DSBs bearing 5′-hydroxyls but no gap. Finally, mammalian Pol X polymerases were able to differentially complement a pol4 mutation depending on the joint structure, demonstrating that these polymerases can participate in yeast NHEJ but with distinct properties.

Double strand breaks (DSBs) 1The abbreviations used are: DSB, double strand break; NHEJ, nonhomologous end joining; MMEJ, microhomology-mediated end joining; NLS, nuclear localization signal; nt, nucleotide; OMP, oligonucleotide-modified plasmid. can be repaired by two mechanisms: homologous recombination and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) (reviewed in Ref. 1Jackson S.P. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Although recombination utilizes an intact homologous template to promote accurate repair, NHEJ relies on base-pairing potential in the terminal overhangs, termed microhomologies, to guide religation of the ends. NHEJ is initiated when the Ku heterodimer (Yku70/Yku80 in yeast) binds to the DSB ends. The Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex is thought to tether the two termini together, along with DNA-PK in mammalian cells (2Chen L. Trujillo K. Ramos W. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E. Mol.

The DNA ligase IV complex in yeast, consisting of the catalytic subunit Dnl4 and its cofactor Lif1, ligates the break to restore the duplex (5Wilson T.E. Grawunder U. Lieber M.R. Nature. 1997; 388: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Agents that create DSBs often leave damaged bases at the break termini (6Coquerelle T. Bopp A. Kessler B. Hagen U. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. Relat. Stud. Phys. Chem. Med. 1973; 24: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 7Pastwa E. Neumann R.D. Mezhevaya K. Winters T.A. Radiat. Res. 2003; 159: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Processing enzymes, at minimum including a nuclease and a polymerase, must remove and resynthesize these damaged bases before ligation can occur, but such repair is ultimately accurate. The nuclease Artemis is involved in mammalian NHEJ (8Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 781-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar), but in yeast the NHEJ nuclease(s) are unknown. The Pol X family of DNA polymerases has been implicated in NHEJ. Pol4, the only Pol X family member in yeast, is required for gap filling in some end configurations but not others (9Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23599-23609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Mammals have four Pol X family members: Polβ, Polλ, Polμ, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (reviewed in Ref. 10Nick McElhinny S.A. Ramsden D.A. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 200: 156-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Polβ functions in base excision repair (11Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar), whereas terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase is specifically associated with V(D)J recombination, a specialized form of NHEJ that occurs only in B- and T-cell maturation (12Komori T. Okada A. Stewart V. Alt F.W. Science. 1993; 261: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 13Gilfillan S. Dierich A. Lemeur M. Benoist C. Mathis D. Science. 1993; 261: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In contrast, recent reports have implicated Polλ and Polμ in general NHEJ. Immunodepletion of Polλ but not Polμ inhibits in vitro NHEJ (14Lee J.W. Blanco L. Zhou T. Garcia-Diaz M. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Wang Z. Povirk L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 805-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Additionally, Polμ has been show to interact with Ku and the XRCC4-ligase IV complex and is recruited to DNA damage foci (15Mahajan K.N. Nick McElhinny S.A. Mitchell B.S. Ramsden D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5194-5202Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Both Polλ and Polμ can act in NHEJ in a reconstituted system (16Ma Y. Lu H. Tippin B. Goodman M.F. Shimazaki N. Koiwai O. Hsieh C.L. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 701-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In all cases, Pol X polymerases are only required for NHEJ when gaps must be filled, indicating that they are not part of the core NHEJ complex. Although the ability of NHEJ to trim and fill overhangs is of great importance to restorative repair, it also enables imprecise rejoining. NHEJ faithfully repairs DSBs with compatible overhangs the majority of the time, but Pol4-dependent inaccurate repair involving overhang mispairing and gain or loss of nucleotides can occur (17Karathanasis E. Wilson T.E. Genetics. 2002; 161: 1015-1027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Della M. Palmbos P.L. Tseng H.M. Tonkin L.M. Daley J.M. Topper L.M. Pitcher R.S. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson T.E. Doherty A.J. Science. 2004; 306: 683-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 19Wilson T.E. Genetics. 2002; 162: 677-688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NHEJ can also join incompatible termini by utilizing microhomologies either in the DSB overhangs or exposed by resection into the duplex DNA (9Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23599-23609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 20Wu X. Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Because incompatible termini necessarily originate from separate or resected DSBs, such imprecise NHEJ events lead to chromosomal rearrangements or deletions. Together, terminal base damage, overhang mispairing, and incompatible termini lead to a large variety of processed NHEJ joints and outcomes in vivo. Thus, understanding the mechanistic basis of processed NHEJ, including the differential contributions of processing enzymes to various joint types, is of great importance. We previously identified some Pol4-dependent NHEJ events but, because of limited ability to create specific DSB termini, could not identify the precise characteristics of a joint structure that necessitated Pol4 action (9Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23599-23609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Here, we sought to determine why only some joints that require gap filling are Pol4-dependent by using oligonucleotide-modified plasmids (OMPs) to perform a systematic analysis of DSB end configurations (21Daley J.M. Wilson T.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 896-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We found that only NHEJ events that involve 3′-overhangs and require gap filling on both strands are strongly Pol4-dependent, with Pol4 promoting accurate repair. Repair of Pol4-independent gap-containing DSBs does not require the translesion polymerases Polη or Polζ, implicating the replicative polymerases in these joints. Pol4 appears to be exclusively associated with the NHEJ pathway of DSB repair, because it is not required for Ku-independent DSB rejoining that occurs via long overhangs or recessed microhomologies (i.e. microhomologies within the duplex portion of a DSB). Finally, we extended these findings to mammalian NHEJ by showing that Polβ, Polλ, and Polμ can each partially replace Pol4 when expressed in yeast. Interestingly, these mammalian polymerases reconstituted NHEJ to different extents depending on the joint structure. These data suggest that specialized NHEJ polymerases are recruited to DSBs with termini that are too unstable to utilize the replicative polymerases. Yeast Strains—Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used for plasmid transformation were isogenic derivatives of the previously described wild-type strain YW389 (MATα ade2D0 his3D200 leu2 lys2–801 trp1D63 ura3D0) (22Vance J.R. Wilson T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15073-15081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). YW438 (pol4Δ::MET15), YW459 (yku70Δ::HIS3), YW507 (dnl4Δ::MET15), YW1567 (pol4Δ::MET15 rad30Δ::kanMX4), YW1568 (pol4Δ::MET15 rev3Δ::HIS3), YW1569 (pol4Δ::MET15 rad30Δ::kanMX4 rev3Δ::HIS3), and YW1654 (pol4Δ::MET15 yku70Δ::kanMX4) were created using a PCR-mediated one-step gene replacement technique (23Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2623) Google Scholar). All disruptions were confirmed by PCR. The suicide deletion strains YW1276 (ADE2::HOSD[+1]) and YW1407 (ADE2::HOSD[+1] pol4Δ::URA3) were described previously (18Della M. Palmbos P.L. Tseng H.M. Tonkin L.M. Daley J.M. Topper L.M. Pitcher R.S. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson T.E. Doherty A.J. Science. 2004; 306: 683-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). When indicated, yeast were transformed with the appropriate polymerase expression plasmids (see below) with continued selection for the plasmid using growth medium lacking leucine. Polymerase Expression Plasmids—Polymerase expression plasmids were created by gap repair with tailed PCR fragments into the CEN/LEU2 plasmid pTW435, which uses the ADH1 promoter to drive expression of a nuclear localization signal (NLS)-Myc-tagged protein. The POL4 coding sequence was amplified from yeast genomic DNA, and the Polβ, Polλ, and Polμ sequences were amplified from human placental cDNA (Clontech) using the Advantage HF PCR kit (BD Biosciences). Plasmids were sequenced to verify the correct coding sequence. Oligonucleotide-modified Plasmids—OMPs were created as described previously (21Daley J.M. Wilson T.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 896-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, two pairs of annealed oligonucleotides designed to restore the ADE2 coding sequence in plasmid pTW423 were ligated onto the ends of pTW423 digested with BglII and XhoI (supplemental Fig. 1A). Plasmids were purified from free oligonucleotides by agarose gel electrophoresis, and product size, linearity, and integrity were verified. DNA concentration was quantified by UV spectrometry. Because the DSB side of the oligonucleotides initially bore 5′-hydroxyls to prevent ligation of the DSB in vitro, purified OMPs were typically treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) followed by a second round of purification. The extent of oligonucleotide ligation was then monitored by primer extension (supplemental Fig. 1B). Because the ligation extent is not constant, small differences in NHEJ efficiency between OMPs cannot be considered significant, although large differences likely reflect real changes in the repair rate. Interstrain differences with a given OMP are independent of this effect. Preparation and SfiI Digest of Plasmids pTW502–507—Plasmids pT-W502–507 are derivatives of the CEN plasmid pES16, which was described previously (5Wilson T.E. Grawunder U. Lieber M.R. Nature. 1997; 388: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Two PCR products amplified from pES16 were prepared to insert an SphI site and stop codons in all reading frames flanked by two SfiI sites after the second codon of ADE2. The first product was made using primers OW2003 (5′-ACACCCGCCGCGCTTAATG-3′) and OW2041 (5′-TACTAGCATGCGGCCGAGTGGGCCATCCATACTTGATTGTTTTGT-3′). The second product was made with OW2068–2073, depending on the plasmid (5′-TACTAGCATGCXTAACTGACTAGGCCCXXXCGGCCCATCTAGAACAGTTGGTATATTAGGA-3′) and OW2008 (5′-TTAACAGATCTCACAATCATGACTGC-3′). The SphI site is indicated in italics, the SfiI sites are in bold, stop codons are underlined, and variable nucleotides that place ADE2 in-frame or make up the desired overhang are indicated by X. The products were digested with NotI and SphI or BglII and SphI, respectively, and simultaneously ligated into NotI- and BglII-digested pES16. Plasmids were then digested with SfiI to excise the polyterminator and gel-purified as above. Yeast Transformation—Plasmids were transformed into yeast using a high efficiency lithium acetate method as described previously (21Daley J.M. Wilson T.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 896-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). 100 ng of linear plasmid (marked with URA3) was co-transformed with 10 ng of supercoiled pRS315 as a transformation control (marked with LEU2). Cells were plated in parallel to glucose medium lacking either uracil or leucine and grown at 30 °C for 3 days. The relative repair efficiency for a strain-plasmid combination is expressed as the ratio of Ade+ (white) colonies on plates lacking uracil, which represent inframe joining of DSBs, to colonies on plates lacking leucine. Note that although in-frame joining effectively selected for the target joint in most cases, alternative Ade+ joints can also occur and will be represented in the graphs. To ensure adequate colony counts, more cells were plated for less efficient joints and/or mutant strains. A minimum of 150, and more typically 500–1200, Ade+ colonies were counted for each joint in wild-type yeast, except where noted. Similar colony numbers were counted for mutant strains when possible, but in instances in which the mutant strain was highly deficient at forming a particular joint, counts were made of the few colonies recovered at the highest plating density. Individual data panels always represent results collected in parallel with a single preparation of the plasmids and carrier DNA to allow valid comparisons. Small variances between graphs are the result of different reagent sets and are not significant as compared with the large changes observed when comparing mutant and wild-type strains within a graph. Joint Analysis—To determine whether Ade+ colonies had formed the target joint in wild-type and/or residual colonies of mutant strains, a sampling of independent colonies for relevant plasmid-strain combinations was subjected to joint analysis. For this, PCR was used to amplify the region of ADE2 containing the break followed by sequencing. A complete understanding of a particular joint efficiency can be determined only by considering both the transformation efficiency (Ade+/Leu+ ratio) and pattern of joints among sequenced colonies. Suicide Deletion—The HO(+1) suicide deletion allele was used to measure the percentage of cells that undergo NHEJ and the percentage of imprecise +2 NHEJ events as described previously (18Della M. Palmbos P.L. Tseng H.M. Tonkin L.M. Daley J.M. Topper L.M. Pitcher R.S. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson T.E. Doherty A.J. Science. 2004; 306: 683-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Pol4 Is Required for Gap Filling Independently of Nonhomologous Flaps—On the basis of previous data (9Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23599-23609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), we considered several joint features, in addition to the presence of gaps, as possible explanations for Pol4 dependence in NHEJ: formation of nonhomologous flaps (i.e. unpaired terminal nucleotides) upon overhang annealing, the stability of the annealed overhangs, and overhang polarity. To test whether the presence of nonhomologous flaps causes Pol4 to be required for gap filling, a series of plasmids were created that bore the four possible combinations of 1-nt flaps and gaps (Fig. 1). The fully compatible and gap-only DSBs are the most physiologically relevant of these as they correlate with precise repair of complementary overhangs at a single DSB, at which gaps would result from the removal of damaged terminal nucleotides. More generally, this panel mimics end structures that might arise when incompatible termini of different DSBs are joined. To make these substrates we took advantage of the fact that the 3-base SfiI 3′-overhangs can be composed of any combination of nucleotides. SfiI sites were placed after the start codon of ADE2 in such a way that the target joint placed ADE2 in-frame. SfiI-digested plasmids were transformed into wild-type, pol4, yku70, and dnl4 yeast to monitor repair, along with a supercoiled LEU2-marked plasmid to control for transformation efficiency. As expected, DSBs with fully compatible overhangs did not require Pol4 for joining (Fig. 1, first target joint). When a 1-nt gap was introduced, joining became strongly Pol4-dependent (Fig. 1, second target joint). This joint was also highly dependent on Dnl4 and Yku70, indicating that the repair occurred by NHEJ. The few Ade+ colonies that did arise in pol4 yeast utilized other short recessed microhomologies. A joint with a 1-nt gap and a 1-nt nonhomologous flap also showed substantial Pol4 dependence, with the target overhang-to-overhang joint not recovered among five sequenced residual events from the pol4 strain (Fig. 1, fourth target joint). Thus, Pol4 is required for gap filling in 3′-overhang NHEJ events regardless of the presence or absence of nonhomologous flaps. A joint with 1-nt flaps but no gap showed only a ∼2-fold reduction in the pol4 strain (Fig. 1, third target joint), similar to previous results (9Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23599-23609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Pol4 Is Not Required for Microhomology-mediated End Joining (MMEJ)—Surprisingly, substantially more Ade+ colonies were recovered in yku70 yeast relative to the dnl4 strain with two of the above SfiI-digested plasmids. Sequencing revealed that the joints recovered in yku70 and dnl4 strains utilized a 6-nt recessed microhomology that contained part of the SfiI recognition sequences and placed ADE2 in-frame in these plasmids (Fig. 1, first and fourth target joints). This joint bears the characteristics of MMEJ events that occur in NHEJ mutant strains when no homology donor is available for recombination (24Ma J.L. Kim E.M. Haber J.E. Lee S.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8820-8828Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). MMEJ shows partial DNA ligase IV dependence but does not require and is in fact inhibited by Ku, which is consistent with our data (24Ma J.L. Kim E.M. Haber J.E. Lee S.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8820-8828Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). These plasmids thus provided a means of assessing the role of Pol4 in MMEJ. For the fourth SfiI joint, five of five sequenced residual repair events formed by the pol4 strain corresponded to this MMEJ event (Fig. 1). More strikingly, the increased MMEJ efficiency seen upon yku70 mutation was still observed upon further pol4 mutation. Therefore, Pol4 is not required for MMEJ. Pol4 Is Required at All NHEJ-dependent Microhomology Lengths—We next asked whether the pattern of Pol4 dependence seen in Fig. 1 would be recapitulated if the joint contained a more stable (but still NHEJ-dependent) microhomology. The OMP approach was used to create DSBs with the desired overhang configurations. In this system, annealed oligonucleotides are ligated onto restriction site ends within the ADE2 gene of the plasmid pTW423 (supplemental Fig. 1A). Ade positivity largely but not completely selects for the target joint by requiring ligation of both oligonucleotide pairs and subsequent rejoining of the DSB (21Daley J.M. Wilson T.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 896-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We again created a panel of DSBs containing 3′-overhangs and each possible combination of 1-base gaps and 1-base flaps but now in the context of a 4-base microhomology. The overhang sequence was kept constant to ensure that differences in repair were due to the presence of flaps and gaps. Such ends are again within the spectrum expected to occur at naturally occurring DSBs, with flaps relevant only to mutagenic events. These DSBs showed a pattern of Pol4 dependence similar to the shorter overhangs. Each gap-containing joint was again highly Pol4-dependent regardless of whether flaps were present (Fig. 2A). The deficiency in the pol4 strain was comparable with that of the dnl4 strain, indicating that Pol4 is strongly required for NHEJ of gap-containing DSBs with 3′-overhangs. Residual Ade+ colonies generated by the pol4 strain corresponded to the designed joint, however, indicating that this event can occur in the absence of Pol4 at a low frequency (Fig. 2A). A joint with flaps but no gaps again showed slightly decreased joining in the absence of Pol4 (Fig. 2A, third target joint). Thus, Pol4 is required for efficient gap filling at 3′-overhangs regardless of whether the overhang contains 1, 2, or 4 homologous bases and in all cases tends to promote accurate rejoining of the microhomology present in the overhangs. Overhang Polarity Determines Pol4 Dependence—We next generated a comparable panel of OMPs with 5′-overhangs to test the importance of overhang polarity, given that each polarity is expected to occur naturally. These DSBs were markedly less Pol4-dependent than the corresponding DSBs with 3′-overhangs (Fig. 2B). When the DSB contained 1-nt gaps, a 2.1-fold decrease in joining efficiency was observed in the pol4 strain as compared with a 39-fold deficiency with 3′-overhangs. Similarly, a 5′-overhang joint with 1-nt flaps and 1-nt gaps was reduced by only 1.6-fold in a pol4 mutant versus 31-fold with 3′-overhangs. Sequencing revealed that Ade+ colonies indeed represented the designed joint in both wild-type and pol4 strains for 5′-overhangs (Fig. 2B). Dnl4 was still required for 5′-overhang joining, however, indicating that repair still occurred by bona fide NHEJ (Fig. 2B). Thus, the NHEJ requirement for Pol4 is greatly relaxed at 5′-overhangs. Why might 3′-overhang joints depend more strongly on a specialized NHEJ polymerase? The 3′-primer terminus that must be extended during gap filling has a different stability and orientation when comparing 3′- and 5′-overhangs. With 5′-overhangs, the 3′-end is on the stable duplex adjacent to the gap, and synthesis proceeds centrally. With 3′-overhangs, the polymerase must synthesize away from the break center using the overhang-to-overhang base pairing as the primer-template pair. This duplex consists of only 1 to at most 6 bases (21Daley J.M. Wilson T.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 896-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and is therefore much less stable than the primer used for 5′-overhang filling. Thus, Pol4 is likely a specialized polymerase that evolved to function in circumstances in which an unstable duplex is the only available primer for DNA synthesis. The recently solved crystal structure of Polλ, the mammalian Pol X polymerase most related to Pol4, supports this idea (25Garcia-Diaz M. Bebenek K. Krahn J.M. Blanco L. Kunkel T.A. Pedersen L.C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 561-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Interactions between the polymerase and the 3′-primer terminus are much less extensive in Polλ than in the replicative polymerases, whereas the lyase domain of Polλ makes extensive contacts with the base on the 5′-side of the gap. The unique biochemical properties of Pol X polymerases, including terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase activity and frequent primer-template slippage, appear to reflect this reduced dependence on a stably annealed primer (26Covo S. Blanco L. Livneh Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 859-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Bebenek K. Garcia-Diaz M. Patishall S.R. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol.

It is also possible that accessibility of the primer terminus within the bound NHEJ complex differs with joint polarity and that only Pol4 is capable of gaining access to internal 3′-ends via interactions with other NHEJ proteins. Indeed, 5′-overhangs could even be filled prior to association of the DSB ends, whereas 3′-overhangs can only be filled during NHEJ. Although Pol4 is not strictly required at gapped 5′-overhangs, our results do not rule out a role for Pol4 in these events in wild-type cells. In fact, a modest decrease was observed in pol4 mutants (Fig. 2B). We therefore favor a model in which other polymerases can compensate for Pol4 loss at more permissive 5′-overhangs. To attempt to identify these redundant polymerases, we constructed double and triple mutants of pol4 with the two remaining nonessential polymerases in budding yeast, Polη and Polζ. Polη, encoded by the RAD30 gene, and Polζ, consisting of two subunits Rev3 and Rev7, are involved in error-free and error-prone lesion bypass pathways, respectively (reviewed in Refs. 29Ohmori H. Friedberg E.C. Fuchs R.P. Goodman M.F. Hanaoka F. Hinkle D. Kunkel T.A. Lawrence C.W. Livneh Z. Nohmi T. Prakash L. Prakash S. Todo T. Walker G.C. Wang Z. Woodgate R. Mol.

Neither of these polymerases was required for gap-filling of 5′-overhangs, as even pol4 rad30 rev3 yeast repaired the gapped 5′-overhang DSB as efficiently as pol4 yeast (Fig. 2C). Therefore, one of the essential polymerases or an unknown polymerase needed to be utilized. Polα, Polδ, and Polϵ are required for DNA replication. Intriguingly, a recent study using mammalian cell extracts identified Polα as providing NHEJ polymerase activity (31Pospiech H. Rytkonen A.K. Syvaoja J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3277-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The involvement of Polδ and Polϵ in base excision repair also makes them reasonable candidates (32Stucki M.

Alternative approaches will be needed to gain further insight into which of these polymerases might act in yeast NHEJ. Pol4 Is Dispensable When Only One Strand Requires Gap Filling—To gain insight into the order of events in NHEJ, we next created DSBs identical to the gap-containing 3′-overhang used in Fig. 2A except with a gap on only one strand. In this configuration, Pol4 was largely dispensable for joining, but Dnl4 was not (Fig. 3). Joint sequences showed that the duplex was restored as expected in both wild-type and pol4 strains (Fig. 3). This indicates that even in the absence of Pol4, the NHEJ machinery can ligate the one nicked strand, as has been observed in vitro (16Ma Y. Lu H. Tippin B. Goodman M.F. Shimazaki N. Koiwai O. Hsieh C.L. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 701-713"

However, in real life, events do not always appear as expected, and we must choose an undesirable action. More than half of the neurons in the monkey centromedian (CM) thalamus were selectively activated when a small-reward action was required but a large-reward option was anticipated. Electrical stimulation of the CM after a large-reward action request substituted a brisk performance with a sluggish performance. These results suggest involvement of the CM in a mechanism complementary to decision and action bias."

Previous studies have shown that African women carry head-supported loads of up to 60% of their Mb far more economically than army recruits carrying equivalent loads in backpacks. Here we show that Nepalese porters carry heavier loads even more economically than African women. Female Nepalese porters, for example, carry on average loads that are 10% of their Mb heavier than the maximum loads carried by the African women, yet do so at a 25% smaller metabolic cost."

The autoinhibited form of GCN2 is activated in cells starved of amino acids by binding of uncharged tRNA to a histidyl-tRNA synthetase-like domain. Replacement of Arg-794 with Gly in the PK domain (R794G) activates GCN2 independently of tRNA binding. Crystal structures of the GCN2 protein kinase domain have been determined for wild-type and R794G mutant forms in the apo state and bound to ATP/AMPPNP.

The R794G mutant shows increased flexibility in the hinge region connecting the N- and C-lobes, resulting from loss of multiple interactions involving Arg794. This conformational change is associated with intradomain movement that enhances ATP binding and hydrolysis.

Mammalian and yeast cells respond to starvation or stress by down-regulating overall protein synthesis, while increasing translation of specific mRNAs encoding transcription factors responsible for ameliorating starvation or stress conditions. These responses are induced by protein kinases that phosphorylate serine 51 in the α-subunit of translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α). 1The abbreviations used are: eIF2α, α-subunit of translation initiation factor 2; PK, protein kinase; HisRS, histidyl-tRNA synthetase; PDB, Protein data bank; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; cAPK, cAMP dependent protein kinase; CDK2, cyclin-dependent kinase 2; c-Src, tyrosine kinase c-Src; CAPSO, N-cyclohexyl-2-hydroxy-3-amino-propanesulfonic acid; CHES, N-cyclohexyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid; RB/DD, ribosome-binding and dimerization domain; AMPPNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate; WT, wild-type; GCN2, general control non-derepressible-2. The eIF2 (αβγ) heterotrimer forms a ternary complex with GTP and methionyl-tRNAMet, which delivers Met-tRNAMeti to the small ribosomal subunit (1Hinnebusch A.G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-243Google Scholar). Thereafter, this 43 S preinitiation complex binds to mRNA and assembles an 80 S initiation complex at the AUG start codon, with hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP and release of eIF2-GDP (2Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 33-88Google Scholar). eIF2-GDP is recycled to eIF2-GTP by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B. Phosphorylation of eIF2α converts eIF2-GDP into an inhibitor of eIF2B, thereby decreasing ternary complex formation and protein synthesis (1Hinnebusch A.G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-243Google Scholar).

All four kinases share a conserved protein kinase (PK) domain (in humans, pairwise amino acid sequence identities = 28-33%), each with a unique set of regulatory domains (Fig. 1a) coupling eIF2α phosphorylation to particular stresses. GCN2 is the most widespread eIF2α kinase superfamily member, first identified as an inducer of GCN4, a transcriptional activator of amino acid biosynthetic genes in budding yeast. Four short open reading frames in the GCN4 mRNA leader support ribosomal reinitiation and increased GCN4 translation in response to moderate reductions in eIF2-GTP. Accordingly, eIF2α phosphorylation in amino acid-starved cells induces GCN4 with attendant increases in amino acid production (10Hinnebusch A.G. Hershey J.W.B. Matthews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 199-244Google Scholar). Similarly, activation of GCN2 in starved mouse cells, or of pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum kinase in cells experiencing endoplasmic reticulum stress, induces translation of the stress-responsive transcription factor ATF4, while reducing overall rates of translation initiation (5Harding H.P.

The HisRS domain binds various uncharged tRNAs with similar affinities, discriminating only against their aminoacylated forms (14Dong J. Qiu H. Garcia-Barrio M. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 269-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). A ribosome-binding and dimerization domain (RB/DD) at the extreme C terminus is also required for GCN2 activation (16Zhu S. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1808-1814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 17Qiu H. Garcia-Barrio M.T. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell.

The RB/DD domain interacts with the HisRS and PK domains in vitro, and there is evidence that the RB/DD-PK interaction impedes GCN2 activation by decreasing the affinity of GCN2 for uncharged tRNAs (14Dong J.

A degenerate kinase-like domain located immediately N-terminal to the PK domain (ψPK domain, Fig. 1a) and the RWD region at the extreme N terminus of GCN2 serve as additional regulatory domains. RWD supports binding of the GCN1·GCN20 complex (20Garcia-Barrio M. Dong J. Ufano S. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1887-1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kubota H. Ota K. Sakaki Y. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17591-17596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which interacts with translating ribosomes and may facilitate transfer of uncharged tRNA from the ribosomal decoding site to the HisRS domain (22Marton M.J.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6622-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The isolated PK domain of GCN2 is completely inert in vitro, but, remarkably, activity is rescued by single amino acid substitutions at Arg794 (R794G) or Phe842 (F842L). These constitutively activating (GCN2c) mutations bypass the tRNA binding requirement for kinase activation in vivo, and we proposed previously that they alter the PK active site in a way that mimics conformational changes induced by interactions with the HisRS or RB/DD domains on tRNA binding (24Qiu H. Hu C. Dong J. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1271-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The PK domain interacts with an N-terminal segment of the HisRS domain, and mutations in the latter abolished kinase function, without impairing tRNA binding or dimerization of the HisRS domain. Thus, the HisRS and PK domains probably participate in stable intramolecular interactions, with tRNA binding eliciting kinase activation via conformational changes that propagate from the HisRS domain to the PK domain (18Qiu H. Dong J. Hu C. Francklyn C.S. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1425-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Other GCN2c mutations have been described, e.g. E803V (25Ramirez M. Wek R.C. Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Jackson B.M. Freeman B. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5801-5815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whose activated phenotype remains dependent on tRNA binding to the HisRS domain (24Qiu H. Hu C. Dong J. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1271-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It was proposed that that these latter mutations lower the threshold concentration of uncharged tRNA required for kinase activation, allowing high-level GCN2 activity in non-starved cells containing basal levels of uncharged tRNA. To examine the molecular mechanisms responsible for GCN2 autoinhibition and activation by uncharged tRNAs, we determined a series of x-ray structures of the dimeric catalytic domain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae GCN2 in apo- and ATP-bound forms at 3.0- and 2.75-Å resolution, respectively. These structures reveal partial closure of the active site cleft that restricts ATP binding by restraining the conformation of the hinge region between the N- and C-lobes of the PK domain. In addition, we determined x-ray structures of the R794G mutant PK domain in apo- and AMPPNP-bound forms at 1.95- and 2.0-Å resolution, respectively. These two structures demonstrate that this activating mutation increases the flexibility of the hinge segment and opens a “molecular flap” that increases the inter-lobate space and accessibility of the enzyme active site. Hence, our work reveals a novel nucleotide gating mechanism via conformational modulation of the hinge region that controls kinase activity. We propose a two-step activation mechanism in which tRNA binding to the HisRS domain leads to a comparable structural remodeling of the hinge region of wild-type GCN2 that facilitates ATP binding. Subsequent autophosphorylation of the activation loop is predicted to facilitate an additional realignment of active site residues necessary for substrate phosphorylation. Protein Preparation and Crystallization—The GCN2 fragment (from S. cerevisiae) encompassing residues 594-997 with deleted segment 665-767, and the same fragments bearing the D835N or R794G mutations, were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3*) cells as N-terminal His6-Smt3 fusion proteins (26Mossessova E. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) using a pET26b-derived expression vector (both S- and Se-methionine forms). The methionine prototrophic strain expressing GCN2PKD835N was used for producing selenomethionine-labeled protein via growth condition-dependent inhibition of the methionine biosynthesis pathway (27Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). A 1:1000 preculture in LB medium was used to inoculate 300 ml of M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.4% glucose, 2 mm MgSO4, and 30 μg/ml kanamycin. After overnight growth (A600 = 0.6) the culture was diluted 1:20 into 6 liters of pre-warmed M9 minimal medium as above. A mixture of 100 mg/liter of l-selenomethionine, 100 mg/liter lysine, threonine, and phenylalanine, and 50 mg/liter of leucine, isoleucine, and valine were added after 8 h of culture growth (A600 = 0.6). The culture was induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.3 mm) after 30 min, and cells were grown for 12 h before harvesting. All proteins were purified to homogeneity by nickel ion affinity chromatography, followed by Ulp1-mediated removal of the tag, subtractive nickel ion, heparin-Sepharose, and gel filtration chromatography. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization and electrospray ionization mass spectrometric analyses confirmed that purified GCN2PKWT, GCN2PKD835N, and GCN2PKR794G were neither degraded nor post-translationally modified. Both wild-type and the D835N mutant showed observed mass = 35,095 ± 1 Da (calculated mass = 35,094.3Da). The R794G mutant showed observed mass = 34,995 ± 1 Da (calculated mass = 34,993.5 Da). Se-GCN2PKD835N crystals were obtained via sitting drop vapor diffusion against a reservoir containing 11% polyethylene glycol 3350, 50 mm CAPSO, pH 9.4, at 21 °C, using a protein concentration of 17.5 mg/ml (stored in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.2 mm Tri(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride), after cross-seeding with S-GCN2PKD835N microcrystals obtained under identical conditions. Rectangular bars, diffracting to 2.6-Å resolution, grow in the orthorhombic space group P212121 (a = 79.6 Å, b = 154.1 Å, c = 157.4 Å) with three homodimers/asymmetric unit. Crystals of GCN2PKWT were obtained under similar conditions, after cross-seeding with GCN2PKD835N microcrystals following a reservoir buffer substitution of 100 mm CHES, pH 9.0. Crystal cryoprotection was achieved by adding glycerol to a final concentration of 25% (v/v). Crystals of the GCN2PKWT·Mg2ATP complex were obtained by co-crystallization under conditions similar to those used for GCN2PKWT, following addition of 2.5 mm ATP and 5 mm MgCl2 to the crystallization buffer. GCN2PKWT·Mg2ATP crystals were cryoprotected by addition of 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol to a final concentration of 30% (v/v). Crystals of GCN2PKR794G grow spontaneously via vapor diffusion against a reservoir containing 9% polyethylene glycol 6000 and 100 mm CHES, pH 9.5. GCN2PKR794G·Mg2AMPPNP co-crystals were obtained under conditions similar to those used for GCN2PKR794G, following addition of 2.5 mm AMPPNP and 5 mm MgCl2 to the crystallization buffer. Apo-GCN2PKR794G and GCN2PKR794G·Mg2AMPPNP crystals were cryoprotected by adding glycerol to a final concentration of 25% (v/v). All crystals grew within 7 days, with the exception of the GCN2PKWT·Mg2ATP complex, which required 2 months. Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—All diffraction data were collected at SGX-CAT (Advanced Photon Source) under standard cryogenic conditions. A single wavelength anomalous dispersion experiment was conducted at an x-ray wavelength near the selenium absorption peak with a single Se-GCN2PKD835N crystal. 48 of 54 possible selenium sites were located.

The structure of GCN2PKR794G·Mg2AMPPNP was determined by calculating difference Fourier syntheses, using the isomorphous structure of the GCN2PKR794G dimer. Residues not included in the final structural models frequently correspond to a few residues (773-779) within the kinase insert, a portion of activation loop (863-882), and the C-terminal αJ-helix (986-997). Coordinates of a single polypeptide chain (Chain A) from each structure were used for illustrations.Table ISummary of phase determination and crystallographic refinement statisticsStructureGCN2PKD835N Se-MetGCN2PKWT apoGCN2PKWT·Mg2ATPGCN2PKR794G apoGCN2PKR794G·Mg2AMPPNPWavelength (Å)0.979350.979350.979310.979310.97931Space groupP212121P212121P21212P212121P212121Molecules/asymmetric unit64222Cell constantsa = 79.6 Å, b = 154.1 Å, c = 157.4 Åa = 79.9 Å, b = 95.7 Å, c = 175.1 Åa = 82.1 Å, b = 175.2 Å, c = 47.5 Åa = 52.8 Å, b = 79.3 Å, c = 146.9 Åa = 52.6 Å, b = 78.9 Å, c = 146.3 ÅResolution range (Å) (overall/outer shell)40.00-2.60/2.66-2.6050.00-3.00/3.16-3.0050.00-2.75/2.81-2.7550.00-1.95/2.00-1.9550.00-2.00/2.05-2.00Reflections (measure/unique)1,134,151/112,609385,351/26,813228,449/18,487452,004/45,568442,569/41,845Completeness (%) (overall/outer shell)98.6/96.795.0/92.299.4/97.099.1/97.694.5/94.3{I/σ(I)} (overall/outer shell)13.6/2.57.8/2.016.7/2.422.4/2.819.6/2.9Rmerge (I)aRmerge=∑hkl∑i|I(hkl)i−〈I(hkl)〉|/∑hkl∑i〈I(hkl)i〉.

Open table in a new tab Kinase Assay—The purified proteins (GCN2PKWT and GCN2PKR794G) were analyzed for kinase activity as described previously (24Qiu H. Hu C. Dong J. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1271-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) by incubating with 25 μm [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, Amersham) and 2.5 μm recombinant eIF2α-ΔC purified from E. coli in 20 μl of kinase buffer for 20 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling, resolved by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue, and the dried gel was subjected to quantitative phosphorimaging analysis. By varying the concentration of eIF2α-ΔC in the assays (data not shown), we verified that saturating amounts of substrate were employed in these assays. Multiple Sequence Alignments and Homology Modeling—Protein sequences similar to GCN2PKWT (E-value <10-4) were identified using ψ-BLAST (31Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments were prepared using CLUSTALX (32Jeanmougin F. Thompson J.D. Gouy M. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 403-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar), and amino acid conservation was calculated with BLOSUM62 (33Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10915-10919Crossref PubMed Scopus (4330) Google Scholar). The homology model of GCN2 HisRS, residues 1034-1490, was obtained with MODELLER (34Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10565) Google Scholar) using the structure of histidyl-tRNA synthetase from Staphylococcus aureus (Protein Data Bank code 1QE0) residues 13-420 as a modeling template (E value = 3 × 10-11, sequence identity 19%, model score = 1.0). Tests with known structures have shown that models with scores from 0.7 to 1.0 have the correct -fold at a 95% confidence level (35Sanchez R. Sali A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13597-13602Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Coordinate Depositions—Refined atomic co-ordinates and x-ray structure factors for GCN2PKD835N (PDB code 1ZXE), GCN2PKWT (PDB code 1ZYC), GCN2PKWT·Mg2ATP (PDB code 1ZYD), GCN2PKR794G (PDB code 1ZY4), and GCN2PKR794G·Mg2AMPPNP (PDB code 1ZY5) are available from the Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org/pdb). Crystallization and Structure Determination—Limited proteolysis/mass spectrometry studies of the GCN2 PK domain (residues 593-998) confirmed the presence of a large (102 residue) proteolytically sensitive insert that is poorly conserved among GCN2 homologs (Fig. 1b). An optimal E. coli expression construct, encoding the active kinase domain (residues 594-997) lacking the insert loop (residues 665-767), was used to produce various proteins for crystallographic study. Three distinct proteins, including wild-type enzyme (GCN2PKWT) and the two mutant forms containing the D835N inactivating mutation (GCN2PKD835N) or the R794G activating mutation (GCN2PKR794G), were purified to homogeneity and crystallized. GCN2PKWT and GCN2PKR794G were assayed for autophosphorylation and eIF2α kinase activity (see below). Unmodified native GCN2 PK domains containing the insert region failed to yield crystals under various crystallization conditions. The residue-numbering scheme used in this article corresponds to the native GCN2 PK domain (Fig. 1b). The structure of Se-Met GCN2PKD835N was determined at 2.6-Å resolution via single wavelength anomalous dispersion and noncrystallographic averaging of three homodimers within the asymmetric unit (final refinement model gave Rwork = 21.1% and Rfree = 25.9% with excellent stereochemistry). Thereafter, the refined structure of a GCN2PKD835N monomer was used as a search model for additional structure determinations, including autoinhibited apoenzyme (GCN2PKWT), a hyperactive mutant form of the apoenzyme GCN2PKR794G, and a GCN2PKWT·Mg2ATP complex. Finally, the structure of the GCN2PKR794G·Mg2AMPPNP complex was obtained via difference Fourier syntheses using the isomorphous structure of GCN2PKR794G (Table I and “Experimental Procedures”). Structural Overview of the GCN2 PK Domain—The GCN2 PK has a typical, bi-lobate kinase fold with the ATP binding cleft positioned in the hinge region between the two lobes (Fig. 2a). Alignment of our structure of GCN2PKWT with those of other protein kinase structures in the PDB, performed using CE (36Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar), shows conformational similarity to human cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2, PDB code 1P2A, root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) for equivalent Cα atoms = 2.4 Å), human tyrosine kinase c-Src (c-Src, PDB code 1FMK, r.m.s.d. = 2.4 Å), human protein kinase B (PKB/Akt2, PDB code 1MRV, r.m.s.d. = 2.5 Å), murine cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK, PDB code 1RE8, r.m.s.d. = 2.8 Å), and human hematopoietic cell kinase (hematopoietic cell kinase, PDB code 2HCK, r.m.s.d. = 3.2 Å). The nomenclature used to describe secondary structural elements of GCN2 PK follows that introduced for cAPK by Knighton et al. (37Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). The smaller N-terminal lobe (N-lobe, residues 599-788) is preceded by a short α-helix (αA, residues 594-598) and contains a five-stranded (β1-β5), twisted β-sheet with two α-helices (αB and αC) linking β3-β4 (Fig. 2a). The position of αC is displaced as seen in the inactive conformation of CDK2 (38De Bondt H.L. Rosenblatt J. Jancarik J. Jones H.D. Morgan D.O. Kim S.H. Nature. 1993; 363: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar), c-Src, and hematopoietic cell kinases (39Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 40Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar, 41Williams J.C.

The large insert characteristic of the eIF2α kinase family members occurs between β4 and β5. The nucleotide binding “P-loop” (606-611) linking β1 to β2 is poorly ordered in some copies of the enzyme within the asymmetric unit. The larger C-terminal lobe (C-lobe, residues 795-982) containing amino acids implicated in catalysis, activation, and substrate recognition is predominantly α-helical (αD-αI), and is connected to the N-lobe by the hinge region (residues 790-794, Figs. 1b and 2a). The conformation of the Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif of apo-GCN2PKWT closely resembles that of the cAPK in its active conformation (PDB code 1ATP). In both structures, the DFG motif projects into the active site, whereas the activation loop extends out into solvent (Fig. 2a, magenta and orange segments, respectively). The 42-res"
https://openalex.org/W2075893175,"Photoreceptor cells have a remarkable capacity to adapt the sensitivity and speed of their responses to ever changing conditions of ambient illumination. Recent studies have revealed that a major contributor to this adaptation is the phenomenon of light-driven translocation of key signaling proteins into and out of the photoreceptor outer segment, the cellular compartment where phototransduction takes place. So far, only two such proteins, transducin and arrestin, have been established to be involved in this mechanism. To investigate the extent of this phenomenon we examined additional photoreceptor proteins that might undergo light-driven translocation, focusing on three Ca2+-binding proteins, recoverin and guanylate cyclase activating proteins 1 (GCAP1) and GCAP2. The changes in the subcellular distribution of each protein were assessed quantitatively using a recently developed technique combining serial tangential sectioning of mouse retinas with Western blot analysis of the proteins in the individual sections. Our major finding is that light causes a significant reduction of recoverin in rod outer segments, accompanied by its redistribution toward rod synaptic terminals. In both cases the majority of recoverin was found in rod inner segments, with ∼12% present in the outer segments in the dark and less than 2% remaining in that compartment in the light. We suggest that recoverin translocation is adaptive because it may reduce the inhibitory constraint that recoverin imposes on rhodopsin kinase, an enzyme responsible for quenching the photo-excited rhodopsin during the photoresponse. To the contrary, no translocation of rhodopsin kinase itself or either GCAP was identified.

To the contrary, no translocation of rhodopsin kinase itself or either GCAP was identified. The phototransduction cascade of vertebrate photoreceptors has served as a “benchmark system” where many of the basic molecular principles of G protein-coupled receptor signal transduction have been discovered and elaborated. Vision begins with the excitation of a prototypic G protein-coupled receptor, rhodopsin, which leads to the activation of multiple molecules of the G protein, transducin. Activated transducin stimulates the activity of its effector, cGMP phosphodiesterase, which leads to a decrease in cellular cGMP, closure of cGMP-gated channels in the plasma membrane, and ultimately development of the electrical signal known as the photoresponse (see Refs. 1Pugh Jr., E.N.

Physiol. 2002; 64: 153-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar for recent reviews on phototransduction). Inactivation of phototransduction is required to prevent photoreceptors from saturating when exposed to constant illumination. Temporal resolution of vision also requires rapid inactivation of the components of the phototransduction cascade so that the cell can rapidly respond to the next light event. Inactivation of rhodopsin is achieved by its phosphorylation by rhodopsin kinase followed by binding of arrestin to completely prevent any further transducin activation (5Arshavsky V.Y. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 124-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The termination of cGMP hydrolysis is achieved by the GTPase activity of transducin, a reaction greatly accelerated by the GTPase activating protein, RGS9 (4Arshavsky V.Y. Lamb T.D. Pugh Jr., E.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 153-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 6Cowan C.W. He W. Wensel T.G. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 65: 341-359Crossref Google Scholar). Finally, restoration of cGMP to its dark level to reopen cGMP-gated channels is accomplished by guanylate cyclase (7Dizhoor A.M. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Photoreceptors have the ability to adjust the speed and sensitivity of their photoresponses to ever changing conditions of ambient illumination. The illumination at the earth's surface varies by nearly 11 orders of magnitude during the normal day-night cycle, and two types of photoreceptors, rods and cones, cover this entire range of light intensities (8Rodieck R.W. The First Steps in Seeing. Sinauer, Sunderland1998Google Scholar). It is well established that this property called light adaptation is underlaid by many individual molecular mechanisms (9Pugh Jr., E.N. NIkonov S. Lamb T.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Many of these mechanisms act in response to the decrease in intracellular Ca2+ that takes place during the photoresponse. Ca2+ decrease causes an enhanced synthesis of cGMP, an increase in cGMP sensitivity of the channels, and shortening of the lifetime of photoactivated rhodopsin. These effects of Ca2+ are mediated by several Ca2+-binding proteins, among which the most characterized are recoverin (10Dizhoor A.M. Ray S. Kumar S. Niemi G. Spencer M. Brolley D. Walsh K.A. Philipov P.P. Hurley J.B. Stryer L.

Ca2+-bound recoverin interacts with rhodopsin kinase and inhibits its ability to phosphorylate rhodopsin. The reduction in Ca2+ caused by light releases the kinase from the complex, thus enhancing rhodopsin phosphorylation and signal turnoff (13Kawamura S.

As such, the light-adapted photoreceptor has enhanced cyclase activity that allows it to efficiently counter the depletion in cGMP caused by continuous phosphodiesterase activation. Each of these Ca2+-bindng proteins, recoverin, GCAP1, and GCAP2, is acylated at its N terminus with a medium chain length (C12-C14) fatty acyl residue. In the case of recoverin, Ca2+ binding increases exposure of the myristoyl residue, which in turn increases the affinity of recoverin for membranes (reviewed in Ref. 21Ames J.B. Tanaka T. Stryer L. Ikura M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In contrast, binding of Ca2+ to GCAPs does not cause increased membrane binding (22Olshevskaya E.V.

An entirely novel type of photoreceptor light adaptation, based on massive reversible translocation of signaling proteins between the rod or cone outer segment, where phototransduction takes place, and the rest of the cell has been revealed in recent studies. This translocation has been documented in a broad range of animal species from flies to mammals (see Refs. 24Arshavsky V.Y. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: E43Google Scholar, 25Hardie R.C. Curr.

Winkens H.J. Curr. Eye Res. 1985; 4: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and transducin (independently described in Refs. 29Brann M.R. Cohen L.V.

McGinnis J.F. J. Neurosci. Res. 1988; 20: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), have been shown to undergo light-driven translocation in mammalian rods. Upon illumination, transducin moves from rod outer segments, whereas arrestin moves in the opposite direction. It is thought this mechanism allows the photoreceptor to optimize the protein composition of its outer segment as the ambient lighting conditions change during the normal diurnal cycle. Evidence in support of this function has been obtained in both vertebrates (32Sokolov M. Lyubarsky A.L. Strissel K.J. Savchenko A.B. Govardovskii V.I. Pugh Jr., E.N. Arshavsky V.Y. Neuron. 2002; 34: 95-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and invertebrates (33Bähner M. Frechter S. Da Silva N. Minke B. Paulsen R. Huber A.

Here we searched for additional proteins undergoing light-driven translocation in rods by focusing on the Ca2+-binding proteins, recoverin and GCAPs. The subcellular distribution of each of these proteins was measured using a quantitative approach originally developed to study transducin translocation (32Sokolov M. Lyubarsky A.L. Strissel K.J.

The method is based on serial sectioning through the photoreceptor layer of a flat-mounted retina followed by protein detection in each section using Western blotting. Our major finding is that light causes a 5-10-fold reduction of recoverin content in rod outer segments, accompanied by its redistribution toward rod synaptic terminals. To the contrary, the subcellular distribution of rhodopsin kinase and both GCAP1 and GCAP2 remained unchanged in dark- and light-adapted rods. Antibodies—Western blotting of proteins was performed using the following antibodies: anti-recoverin and anti-GCAP1 and -GCAP2 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (a gift from A. M.

S. Molday, University of British Columbia). Serial Sectioning with Western Blotting—The method was used essentially as previously described (32Sokolov M. Lyubarsky A.L. Strissel K.J. Savchenko A.B.

A mouse eye was enucleated and dissected in Ringer's solution containing 130 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm KCl, 2.4 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 0.02 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), with the osmolarity adjusted to 313 mosm. All tissue manipulations were conducted in Ringer's solution. The anterior portion of the eye was cut away, and the lens was removed. A 2-mm trephine was used to punch a central disc through the entire posterior eye cup. The retina was pulled away from the eyecup disc, transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane with the photoreceptors facing up, and positioned on a porous glass filter. The retina was flattened by applying gentle suction from underneath the glass filter, removing the entire solution from the flattening chamber. The retina, still attached to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, was then flat-mounted between two glass slides separated by 0.5-mm thick spacers and frozen. The cover glass and spacers were subsequently removed, and the retina was sectioned in a cryomicrotome. The alignment of the retina surface with the cutting plane of the microtome knife was performed as follows. Tissue-freezing compound was applied to the microtome specimen holder and allowed to freeze. A flat surface, large enough to accommodate the base slide holding the frozen retina, was made by sectioning through to a sufficient depth in the freezing compound. The base slide was mounted to the freezing compound by addition of water drops along the sides of the glass base. The retina was trimmed to remove any folded edges, and the remaining flat surface was cut in 5-μm serial sections. Each section was collected in a precooled 0.5-ml Eppendorf tube and stored at -80 °C until used. Western blotting was performed using the Criterion™ system (Bio-Rad). Each frozen section was dissolved in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For each tested protein, 10-μl aliquots were separated on 26-well 10-20% Tris-HCl gel during 1 h at 150 V. For rhodopsin detection, 20-fold diluted aliquots were used. For the detection of GCAPs 10 mm EGTA was added to the samples. The transfer to Immun-Blot™ polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) was carried out in Towbin buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 15% (v/v) methanol for 2 h at 0.2 A. Proteins of interest were probed with specific antibodies against the Ca2+-binding proteins and intracellular markers (rhodopsin and cytochrome oxidase) and visualized using the ECF detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The fluorescence of the bands was quantified by using the Storm 860 gel and blot imaging system (Molecular Dynamics) equipped with the same software. We found that the ECF detection system provides better linearity of the signal than the more ubiquitously used ECL system, which makes it more suitable for quantitative experiments. To calculate the fraction of each protein of interest present in rod outer segments, we used the approach originally developed for calculating the outer segment fraction of transducin (32Sokolov M. Lyubarsky A.L. Strissel K.J. Savchenko A.B. Govardovskii V.I. Pugh Jr., E.N. Arshavsky V.Y. Neuron. 2002; 34: 95-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The density of the immunostained bands in each section was plotted as percent of the total density of all bands. Those sections that contained rhodopsin but not cytochrome oxidase we considered as sections containing non-contaminated rod outer segment material. The fractions of the Ca2+-binding proteins of interest and rhodopsin present in these sections were calculated, and the amount of each protein in the entire outer segment was derived by taking their ratios. Light Adaptation of Animals and Determination of Rhodopsin Bleaching Levels—Prior to light exposure, mice were dark-adapted for at least 12 h and anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of a ketamine/xylazine mixture (75/10 mg/kg, respectively). The pupils were dilated with a mixture of 1% cyclopentolate-HCl, 2.5% phenylephrine, and 0.25% tropicamide. To prevent cataract formation in anesthetized animals, Gonak™ (Akorn) was applied on the cornea several times during the course of light exposure. Light was delivered to the eyes by fiber optic guides from an adjustable light source equipped with a 100-watt halogen bulb. Even illumination throughout the entire retina was achieved by positioning a white screen between the light guide and the eye, just above the cornea. The light intensity at the eye surface was measured by a calibrated photodiode, the spectral sensitivity of which closely matched that of rhodopsin. The photodiode was attached to a PDA-700 amplifier (TTI Inc., Oriskany, NY). Mice were typically subjected to a 30-min exposure at 60 scotopic candela m-2, which resulted in the bleaching of ∼40% rhodopsin in their retinas at the end of the illumination period. Rhodopsin concentration was determined by difference spectroscopy using the molar extinction coefficient of 40,500 (36Bownds D. Gordon-Walker A. Gaide-Huguenin A.-C. Robinson W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1971; 58: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The degree of rhodopsin bleaching in the retinas of light-adapted animals was determined by measuring the amount of rhodopsin before and after its regeneration with 11-cis-retinal. A protocol modified from Ref. 32Sokolov M. Lyubarsky A.L. Strissel K.J. Savchenko A.B. Govardovskii V.I. Pugh Jr., E.N. Arshavsky V.Y. Neuron. 2002; 34: 95-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar was used as follows. A single retina was extracted from an eye under dim red illumination and sonicated in 250 μl of water. A 100-μl aliquot was mixed with 20 μl of 200 mm hydroxylamine (titrated to pH 7.5 by NaOH) containing 10% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. The sample was centrifuged in a tabletop microcentrifuge, and rhodopsin concentration in the supernatant was measured by difference spectrometry. The rest of the sonicated sample was mixed with 0.5 μl of 4 mm 11-cis-retinal solubilized in ethanol, sonicated again, and incubated at 37 °C for 40 min in complete darkness. Upon the completion of regeneration, rhodopsin concentration was determined in a 100-μl aliquot, as in the non-regenerated sample. The extent of rhodopsin bleaching in the retina was calculated as the difference between the measured rhodopsin concentration in regenerated and non-regenerated samples. Preparation of Mouse Recoverin Standard—The cDNA for mouse recoverin was generated by RT-PCR from mouse retinal mRNA (isolated from strain C57BL/6). This cDNA was cloned into the pTriex2 vector (Novagen). Myristoylated recoverin was generated in Escherichia coli and purified over phenyl-Sepharose as previously described (37Ray S. Zozulya S. Niemi G.A. Flaherty K.M. Brolley D. Dizhoor A.M. McKay D.B. Hurley J. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5705-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Purified myristoylated recoverin was >90% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE. The concentration of the purified protein was determined by amino acid analysis (AAA Laboratories, Mercer Island, WA). Subcellular Distribution of Recoverin in Dark- and Light-adapted Retinas—Previous reports addressing the distribution of recoverin in the retina indicated that it is localized primarily in rods and cones with a very small fraction also present in some of the cone bipolar cells (10Dizhoor A.M. Ray S. Kumar S. Niemi G. Spencer M. Brolley D. Walsh K.A. Philipov P.P. Hurley J.B. Stryer L. Science. 1991; 251: 915-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 38Milam A.H. Dacey D.M.

Res. 1997; 50: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In all of these studies, recoverin immunostaining was observed throughout the entire cellular volumes of rods and cones. However, immunostaining is not an optimal technique to quantify the distribution of recoverin between the outer segment and the other cellular compartments. This is because the efficiency of antigen-antibody recognition can vary significantly in different cellular compartments and different antibodies or tissue fixation techniques often yield variable quantitative results. Collectively these phenomena are known as epitope masking (cf. Ref. 40Roof D.J. Heth C.A. Science. 1988; 241: 845-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A quantitative approach for analyzing the subcellular distribution of photoreceptor-specific proteins was introduced in our study of light-driven transducin translocation in rods (32Sokolov M. Lyubarsky A.L. Strissel K.J. Savchenko A.B. Govardovskii V.I. Pugh Jr., E.N. Arshavsky V.Y. Neuron. 2002; 34: 95-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). This method exploits the highly layered structure of the vertebrate retina by combining serial tangential sectioning of flat-mounted frozen retinas with the Western blot analysis of proteins in each section. The subcellular localization of any given protein is then determined by comparing its distribution in the sections with the distribution of protein markers confined to specific subcellular compartments of the rods. Because in this analysis proteins are completely unfolded by SDS, detached from their intracellular environments and interacting partners, and separated from one another on the gel, it does not suffer from epitope masking and allows quantitative analysis of individual protein bands on Western blots. We previously used serial sectioning to determine the distribution of recoverin in dark-adapted mouse rods (41Sampath A.P. Strissel K.J. Elias R. Arshavsky V.Y. McGinnis J.F. Chen J. Kawamura S. Rieke F. Hurley J.B. Neuron. 2005; 46: 413-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We extended this analysis to quantify the subcellular distribution of recoverin in rods of dark- and light-adapted mice (Fig. 1A). Most of the recoverin in rods is localized in the inner segments. Remarkably, light caused a significant redistribution of recoverin from the outer segments toward the synaptic terminals. To quantify the extent to which recoverin is lost from the outer segments upon illumination, we averaged recoverin distribution profiles obtained from four dark and five light experiments and calculated the average recoverin content as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We found that the recoverin content in the outer segments of dark-adapted mice was 12 ± 3% (S.E.) of its entire cellular pool whereas light caused its reduction to only 1.8 ± 0.5% (S.E.). When we then conducted a formal calculation of the amount of recoverin translocating between the proximal and distal halves of the cell (with the dividing line designated as section 12) the total extent of translocation was 24%. This amount is about twice as large than the recoverin content in the outer segments in the dark, which indicates that recoverin from both outer and inner segments moves toward the synaptic terminals upon illumination. The Amount of Recoverin in the Entire Rod Cell Is Comparable with Transducin—A previous report using isolated bovine rod outer segments estimated the molar ratio of recoverin to rhodopsin to be 1:174 (15Klenchin V.A. Calvert P.D. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16147-16152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, our observation that even in the dark ∼90% recoverin in rods is localized outside the outer segments calls for re-evaluation of its total cellular amount. The molar ratio of recoverin to rhodopsin was determined by quantitative immunoblotting of mouse retina homogenates. Because cones comprise only ∼3% of the total photoreceptor pool in the rodent retina (42Carter-Dawson L.D. LaVail M.M. J. Comp. Neurol. 1979; 188: 245-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) and recoverin immunostaining in bipolar cells is truly minor (39McGinnis J.F. Stepanik P.L. Jariangprasert S. Lerious V. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 50: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we assumed that the total recoverin amount in the retina would be very close to its amount in rods. We isolated whole retinas from dark-adapted mice, disrupted them by sonication, and quantified rhodopsin by difference spectroscopy (see “Experimental Procedures”). Recoverin was analyzed in the same extracts by quantitative immunoblotting, using recombinant mouse recoverin as the standard (Fig. 2). As expected, the molar ratio of recoverin to rhodopsin determined by this approach was much higher than previously reported and equal to 0.080 ± 0.010 (S.E., n = 6). This is approximately equimolar with transducin in mouse rods (0.084 ± 0.004 molar ratio with rhodopsin from Ref. 43Tsang S.H. Burns M.E. Calvert P.D. Gouras P. Baylor D.A. Goff S.P. Arshavsky V.Y. Science. 1998; 282: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Translocation of Recoverin Is Not Accompanied by Translocation of Rhodopsin Kinase—Because the most well known function of recoverin is to regulate the activity of rhodopsin kinase, it was interesting to test whether rhodopsin kinase also undergoes light-driven translocation. However, the data illustrated in Fig. 3 indicate that rhodopsin kinase remains in the same outer segment sections as rhodopsin, regardless of the conditions of illumination. Subcellular Distribution of GCAPs in the Dark- and Light-adapted Retinas—We next conducted similar analyses for determining the distributions of two other photoreceptor-specific Ca2+-binding proteins, GCAP1 and GCAP2 (Fig. 4). Although the distribution profiles of GCAP1 and GCAP2 are different from one another, neither one undergoes a statistically significant translocation upon illumination. The rod outer segment content of GCAP1 was calculated to be 70.3 ± 5.5% (S.E., n = 4) in the dark and 70.2 ± 5.8% (S.E., n = 4) in the light. In fact, the actual number might be somewhat higher because GCAP1 is enriched in cones that are located at the base of rod outer segments. This cone-localized GCAP1 may be counted toward the rod inner segment sections in our analysis. An observable difference in the GCAP1 amounts in section 6 of the dark and light profiles is not statistically significant (p = 0.15) and is paralleled by a slightly (and also statistically insignificant) difference in the average rhodopsin content in section 6. The rod outer segment content of GCAP2 was calculated to be 25.7 ± 3.8% (S.E., n = 4) in the dark and 22.1 ± 1.3% (S.E., n = 4) in the light. Based on this analysis, we conclude that unlike recoverin neither GCAP undergoes light-dependent translocation from their relative positions in the cell. The overall distribution of each GCAP throughout the serial sections is generally consistent with previous immunolocalization analysis of GCAP in photoreceptors. In those studies, GCAP1 was shown to be present predominantly in the outer segments of rods and cones, whereas GCAP2 was shown to be present throughout the entire photoreceptor cell (12Dizhoor A.M.

Eye Res. 1999; 68: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The central observation obtained in this study is that recoverin undergoes light-driven translocation from rod outer segments toward the rod synaptic terminals. The significance of this finding is that recoverin is only the third signaling protein shown to translocate in this manner in vertebrate rods. Signal-dependent protein translocation occurs in other types of cells as well (48Lefkowitz R.J. Whalen E.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 49Milligan G. Parenti M. Magee A.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 181-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), but the combination of a high degree of subcellular compartmentalization of the rod photoreceptor and its extremely well characterized function makes it a unique model for studying cell polarization and signal-dependent redistribution of intracellular proteins. What could be the physiological role and the underlying cellular mechanisms of recoverin translocation? As the answers to these questions are as yet unresolved we present the following analysis based on the available literature. What is the Functional Role of Recoverin Translocation?—The function of recoverin in phototransduction has been a subject of intensive investigation. In vitro, recoverin regulates the lifetime of activated rhodopsin by sequestering rhodopsin kinase in a Ca2+-dependent manner (13Kawamura S. Nature. 1993; 362: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 14Chen C.-K. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. Hurley J.B. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1998; 111: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This suggested a mechanism where the light-induced Ca2+ decrease in the outer segments is accompanied by kinase deinhibition of recoverin, enhanced rhodopsin phosphorylation, and ultimately in a shortened photoresponse that is characteristic of the light-adapted photoreceptor. However, this putative mechanism was challenged by the lack of Ca2+ effect on rhodopsin phosphorylation in rods permeabilized by α-toxin (51Otto-Bruc A.E. Fariss R.N. Van Hooser J.P. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15014-15019Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, the Ca2+ dependence of rhodopsin phosphorylation in vitro (13Kawamura S.

Baylor D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6474-6479Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) did not match the physiological range of cytoplasmic Ca2+ changes (53McCarthy S.T. Younger J.P. Owen W.G. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 2076-2089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 54Gray-Keller M.P. Detwiler P.B.

Physiol. 2002; 542: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The latter was explained by Bownds and co-workers (15Klenchin V.A. Calvert P.D. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16147-16152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) who argued that this range is dependent on the concentration of reacting components. Key to their analysis was the observation that the membrane association of recoverin increases its affinity to Ca2+ (56Zozulya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) along with the fact that rod outer segments are tightly packed by the membranes of the photoreceptor discs. This apparent controversy was recently resolved by the demonstration that rods of the recoverin knock-out mice have shortened photoresponses, consistent with the role of recoverin in the regulation of rhodopsin kinase activity (16Makino C.L. Dodd R.L. Chen J. Burns M.E. Roca A. Simon M.I. Baylor D.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 41Sampath A.P. Strissel K.J. Elias R. Arshavsky V.Y. McGinnis J.F. Chen J. Kawamura S. Rieke F. Hurley J.B. Neuron. 2005; 46: 413-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). What could be the role of recoverin translocation in this context? One possibility is that recoverin departure from the outer segments works in concert with the reduction in Ca2+ concentration in deinhibition of rhodopsin kinase. Thus, recoverin translocation may serve as a cellular mechanism contributing to the shortening of the photoresponses in light-adapted rods. Another aspect of recoverin translocation revealed in our study is its light-dependent elevation in synaptic terminals. Given that the majority of recoverin in rods resides outside the outer segments it seems likely that it has an additional role(s) in the cell. Indeed, a recent report (41Sampath A.P. Strissel K.J. Elias R. Arshavsky V.Y. McGinnis J.F. Chen J. Kawamura S. Rieke F. Hurley J.B. Neuron. 2005; 46: 413-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) indicates that recoverin knock out shortens the light responses of rod bipolar and ganglion cells. This shortening occurs at a time in the photoresponse before the effect of recoverin is detectable. The increase of recoverin in synaptic terminals upon light adaptation may further modify the transmission of visual information down-stream from photoreceptors. What are the Cellular Mechanisms of Recoverin Translocation?—Recoverin undergoes a light-dependent translocation in the same direction as transducin (29Brann M.R. Cohen L.V. Science. 1987; 235: 585-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 30Philp N.J. Chang W. Long K. FEBS Lett. 1987; 225: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 31Whelan J.P. McGinnis J.F. J. Neurosci. Res. 1988; 20: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The relationship between these movements is unclear because there is no established interaction between recoverin and transducin. The movement of recoverin could be mediated either by diffusion through the photoreceptor cytoplasm or by active transport involving molecular motors. Both types of mechanism for the light-driven translocation of signaling proteins in photoreceptors have been considered in a recent review (27Strissel K.J. Sokolov M. Arshavsky V.Y. Williams D.S. Recent Advances in Human Biology. World Scientific, Singapore2004: 163-193Google Scholar). We find the diffusion hypothesis particularly appealing in the case of recoverin. The Ca2+-bound form of recoverin, with its high affinity for membranes, may be attracted to the high membrane content of the outer segment in darkness when intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations are high. In light, when intracellular free Ca2+ levels fall, recoverin dissociates from membranes and either redistributes itself throughout the rod or binds preferentially to a target within the rod cell body. A similar scenario may exist in all other subcellular compartments where the amount of membrane-associated recoverin is determined by the balance between Ca2+ concentration and the corresponding membrane density. Consistent with this, GCAP1 and GCAP2, which do not translocate between the cytosol and membranes in a Ca2+-sensitive manner, also do not redistribute themselves differently between the outer segment and cell body in light and dark."

Forkhead transcription factors belonging to the FoxO subfamily have been shown to inhibit growth and cell cycle progression in a variety of cell types. We hypothesized that forkhead proteins may play a role in VSMC biology. Under in vitro conditions, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB, tumor necrosis factor-α, and insulin-like growth factor 1 stimulated phosphorylation of FoxO in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells via MEK1/2 and/or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent signaling pathways. PDGF-BB, tumor necrosis factor-α, and insulin-like growth factor 1 treatment resulted in the nuclear exclusion of FoxO, whereas PDGF-BB alone down-regulated the FoxO target gene, p27kip1, and enhanced cell survival and progression through the cell cycle. These effects were abrogated by overexpression of a constitutively active, phosphorylation-resistant mutant of the FoxO family member, TM-FKHRL1. The anti-proliferative effect of TM-FKHRL1 was partially reversed by small interfering RNA against p27kip1. In a rat balloon carotid arterial injury model, adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of FKHRL1 caused an increase in the expression of p27kip1 in the VSMC and inhibition of neointimal hyperplasia. These data suggest that FoxO activity inhibits VSMC proliferation and activation and that this signaling axis may represent a therapeutic target in vasculopathic disease states.

Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is a well established procedure for revascularization of patients with arterial occlusive disease. The occurrence of restenosis at the site of angioplasty remains a major limitation of this procedure. An important goal is to elucidate the molecular basis of restenosis and to use this information to identify novel therapeutic targets.Neointimal hyperplasia, a hallmark of VSMC proliferation, contributes significantly to the restenotic process after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. The complex response involves initial accumulation of inflammatory cells and the release of growth factors and chemotactic cytokines (3Dzau V.J. Braun-Dullaeus R.C. Sedding D.G. Nat.

In the current study, we show that FoxO proteins lie downstream of PDGF-BB, TNF-α, and IGF-1 signaling pathways in VSMC in vitro, and we provide evidence for an inhibitory role of forkhead proteins in injury-induced neointimal hyperplasia in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—PD98059, LY294002, and wortmannin were purchased from Calbiochem. Recombinant human PDGF-BB, TNF-α, and IGF-1 were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Antibodies to AKT, phospho-AKT-Ser-473, FKHR, FKHRL1, phospho-FKHR-Ser-256 (which also recognizes phospho-AFX-Ser-193), β-actin, and hemagglutinin (HA) were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Cy3-conjugated anti-smooth muscle actin antibody was purchased from Sigma. Anti-PDGF-B antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA).

(Valencia, CA). The XTT assay kit was from Roche Applied Science.Cell Culture—Human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (CASMC) (Cambrex Bio Science, Baltimore, MD) were cultured in smooth muscle basal medium (SmBM) supplemented with SingleQuots and 10% FBS (Cambrex Bio Science). All studies were carried out with CASMC at passages 5-8. CASMC were grown for 16-72 h (as indicated) in SmBM in the absence of serum before treating with PDGF-BB, TNF-α, or IGF-1. CASMC from two independent donors were tested for the in vitro experiments.Western and Northern Blot Analyses—Immunoblot assays were performed by modification of the procedure previously described (55Abid M.R. Tsai J.C. Spokes K.C. Deshpande S.S. Irani K. Aird W.C. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2548-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Briefly, CASMC were washed in phosphate-buffered saline twice and harvested by scraping in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium vanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Protein (25 μg) was separated on 10% of Tris-HCl SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The membrane was blocked with TBST (10 mm Tris, 0.2% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat milk for 1 h and then incubated with primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. After three washes with TBST, the membrane was incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce) was used for detection. Membranes were stripped with Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) for 15 min at room temperature followed by washing with TBST. Primary antibodies were used as indicated. Secondary antibodies included anti-rabbit IgG/horseradish peroxidase conjugate or anti-mouse IgG/horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:1000 dilution; Amersham Biosciences). RNA was harvested with the Trizol reagent, and hybridization was performed with p27kip1 cDNA probe as previously described (53Abid M.R. Guo S. Minami T. Spokes K.C. Ueki K. Skurk C. Walsh K. Aird W.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Northern and Western blots were performed in triplicate, and representative blots are shown.Adenovirus Vector Constructs and Transduction—CASMC were transduced with replication-defective adenovirus encoding the cDNA for β-galactosidase (Adv), wild type FKHRL1 (WT-FKHRL1), and the phosphorylation-resistant triple mutant FKHRL1 (TM-FKHRL1), which contains T32A, S253A, and S319A (53Abid M.R.

For virus transductions, CASMC were plated at ∼70-80% confluence and cultured for 5 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in smooth muscle growth medium (SmGM, Cambrex Bio Science). The cells were washed once with and incubated in Opti-MEM I (without phenol red) for 30 min and then transduced at a multiplicity of infection of 20 in SmGM medium for 12 h, grown in fresh medium for another 10 h, and then serum-starved in SmBM for 16-72 h as indicated.FKHR and FKHRL1 Immunofluorescence—CASMC were plated onto 4-well chamber slides (Lab-Tek, Christchurch, New Zealand) at a density of 50,000 cells/well. The cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in blocking buffer (4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% saponin in phosphate-buffered saline) for 10 min. The cells were incubated with anti-FKHR, anti-FKHRL1, or anti-HA antibody (1:100) in 200 μl of blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit IgG (1:100) in 200 μl of blocking buffer for 1 h. After extensive washing, the cells were incubated with DAPI-containing mounting medium Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 10 min at room temperature, and representative images were captured with a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope and a Spot digital camera. The images were merged using Adobe Photoshop software.Proliferation Assays—CASMC were grown to a density of 50,000 cells/well in 12-well plates. At 80% confluence, the cells were starved for 48 h in SmBM in the absence of serum. The cells were treated with TNF-α, PDGF-BB, or 10% fetal calf serum for 20 h to induce cell cycle reentry and pulsed with 1 mCi/liter [3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) during the last 4 h of incubation. After washes with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were trypsinized and solubilized with 0.2 m NaOH. Radioactivity incorporated into DNA was measured in a scintillation counter. In addition, the XTT assay was employed to determine cell proliferation. This assay is based on the conversion of the yellow tetrazolium salt XTT into an orange, water-soluble dye, formazan, by metabolically active cells. Cells were serum-starved for 48 h, treated with agonists for 48 h, and then incubated with XTT for 4 h. Formation of formazan was directly quantitated in 96-well plates with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader at A490-655 nm (model 680; Bio-Rad). Trypan blue exclusion method was also used to count the number of viable cells where indicated (55Abid M.R. Tsai J.C. Spokes K.C. Deshpande S.S. Irani K. Aird W.C. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2548-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).Flow Cytometry for Cell Cycle and Apoptosis Assay—FACS analyses were carried out to determine apoptosis as assayed by annexin V-propidium iodide staining of intact cells and to determine the cell cycle distribution of CASMC by quantifying propidium iodide-labeled DNA content of ethanol-permeabilized cells, as previously described (53Abid M.R.

In brief, 25 μl of Lipofectin was added to 225 μl of Opti-MEM I in a polystyrene tube. Following a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the mixture was combined with 250 μl of Opti-MEM I containing 5 μg of control nonsilencing Alex Fluor 488 (NS) (Qiagen) or p27kip1 siRNA and incubated for an additional 30 min. 2 ml of fresh Opti-MEM I was added to each polystyrene tube containing 500 μl of the mixture of siRNA and Lipofectin. The cells were washed with Opti-MEM I and then incubated with 2.5 ml of the above mixture at 37 °C, 5% CO2. After 4.5 h, Opti-MEM I was removed, and cells were incubated in SmGM medium for 24-48 h, as indicated. For co-transduction with adenovirus and siRNA, the cells were plated and transduced with the viruses expressing either control β-galactosidase (Adv) or TM-FKHRL1 on day 1 and then transfected with either NS or p27kip1 siRNA on the next day.Gene Transfer and in Vivo Balloon Angioplasty—The rat carotid balloon angioplasty model was performed according to the method described by Clowes et al. (57Clowes A.W. Reidy M.A. Clowes M.M. Lab. Invest. 1983; 49: 327-333PubMed Google Scholar, 58Clowes A.W. Reidy M.A. Clowes M.M. Lab. Invest. 1983; 49: 208-215PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 4-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats (350-400 g) were heparinized systemically (100 units/kg). 1-1.5 cm of the left carotid arteries of adult males were injured with a 2F embolectomy catheter (Baxter Edwards Healthcare, Irvine, CA), which was inflated in the carotid and passed three times to achieve significant injury. The vessel was filled with 50 μl of normal saline (n = 8) or with 108 to 5 × 108 plaque-forming units of rAd.TM-FKHRL1 (n = 14) or control rAd.β-gal (n = 6) for 20 min. The adenovirus solution was flushed out via the opened external carotid artery. The external carotid was then ligated, and blood flow was restored. All rats were housed at the BIDMC animal facility and were treated according to published National Institutes of Health guidelines.Tissue Collection, Morphology, and Immunocytochemistry—Rats subjected to balloon injury were monitored for 14 days and subsequently sacrificed. Injured carotids were retrieved, fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin/eosin for histomorphometric analysis. The ratio of intima versus media (I/M) in each carotid was measured by morphometric analysis using the NIH Image version 1.62 public domain software. I/M ratios from 10 serial sections 50 μm apart were averaged for each animal. To detect PDGF-B in the tissue sections, immunochemical staining was performed using biotinylated anti-IgG as a secondary antibody. Apoptotic cells were identified using the Vectastain Elite ABC kit. Immunofluorescent staining of 5-μm frozen sections was employed to detect Ki-67, smooth muscle actin, HA, FKHRL1, and p27kip1. The snap frozen tissue sections were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde followed by the heat treatment in 10 mm citrate buffer.Statistical Analysis—Data are given as mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance as appropriate.RESULTSPDGF-BB, TNF-α, and IGF-1 Induce Phosphorylation of FoxO Proteins in CASMC—To determine whether PDGF-BB, TNF-α, and IGF-1 modulate the phosphorylation of forkhead proteins in VSMC, we carried out Western blot analyses of CASMC treated in the absence or presence of the cytokine/growth factor. As shown in Fig. 1, incubation of CASMC with PDGF-BB (10 ng/ml for 15 min), TNF-α (10 ng/ml for 30 min), or IGF-1 (100 ng/ml for 15 min) each resulted in phosphorylation of Akt at serine 473, FKHR at serine 256, and AFX at serine 193. PDGF-BB-mediated induction of FKHR phosphorylation was blocked by pretreatment with the PI3K inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin, but not by the MEK1/2 inhibitor, PD980059 (Fig. 1A shows LY294002 and PD980059). In contrast, PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of AFX was only partially inhibited by LY294002. The effect of TNF-α on the phosphorylation of FKHR and AFX was partially attenuated by LY294002 and PD980059 (Fig. 1B). Finally, IGF-1-mediated phosphorylation of FKHR and AFX was blocked by LY294002 (Fig. 1C). In time course experiments, the effect of TNF-α on phosphorylation of FKHR and AFX was delayed (maximum at 30 min) compared with PDGF-BB and IGF-1 (maximum at 15 min) (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that PDGF-BB, TNF-α, and IGF-1 each induces phosphorylation of forkhead in CASMC through MEK1/2 and/or PI3K-dependent signaling pathways.PDGF-BB, TNF-α, and IGF-1 Induce Nuclear Export of FKHR and FKHRL1 in CASMC—To determine the effect of PDGF-BB, TNF-α, or IGF-1 on nuclear localization of FoxO, CASMC were cultured in 4-well chamber slides, serum-starved for 24 h, and then treated with or without 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB, 10 ng/ml TNF-α, or 100 ng/ml IGF-1 for 30 min. Subcellular distribution of FKHR and FKHRL1 was assayed by immunofluorescence. Under serum starvation conditions, FKHR and FKHRL1 were predominantly localized in the nucleus. Treatment with PDGF-BB, TNF-α, or IGF-1 resulted in nuclear export of FKHR and FKHRL1 (Figs. 2, A and B). Preincubation of CASMC with 50 μm LY294002 significantly inhibited PDGF-BB-, TNF-α-, and IGF-1-mediated nuclear exclusion of FKHR, whereas the inhibitory effect of 50 μm PD98059 was limited to TNF-α-mediated translocation of FKHR (Fig. 2C). These results are consistent with the phosphorylation data (see Fig. 1) and collectively suggest that PDGF-BB-, TNF-α-, and IGF-1-mediated phosphorylation of FoxO results in cytoplasmic translocation/nuclear exclusion of the transcription factors.Fig. 2PDGF-BB, TNF-α, and IGF-1 each induces nuclear exclusion of forkhead proteins in CASMC. A total of 50,000 cells of CASMC were cultured in 4-well chamber slides; serum-starved for 24 h; treated in the absence or presence of PDGF-BB, TNF-α, and IGF-1 for 30 min; fixed with paraformaldehyde; and then incubated with primary antibodies to FKHR (A) or FKHRL1 (B), followed by Cy3-conjugated anti-IgG secondary antibody. The cells were incubated with DAPI for nuclear staining and observe"
https://openalex.org/W2060666628,"Oxidative stress is a key apoptotic stimulus in neuronal cell death and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson disease (PD). Recently, we demonstrated that protein kinase C-δ (PKCδ) is an oxidative stress-sensitive kinase that can be activated by caspase-3-dependent proteolytic cleavage to induce apoptotic cell death in cell culture models of Parkinson disease (Kaul, S., Kanthasamy, A., Kitazawa, M., Anantharam, V., and Kanthasamy, A. G. (2003) Eur. J. Neurosci. 18, 1387-1401 and Kanthasamy, A. G., Kitazawa, M., Kanthasamy, A., and Anantharam, V. (2003) Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 5, 609-620). Here we showed that the phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue in PKCδ can regulate the proteolytic activation of the kinase during oxidative stress, which consequently influences the apoptotic cell death in dopaminergic neuronal cells. Exposure of a mesencephalic dopaminergic neuronal cell line (N27 cells) to H2O2(0-300 μm) induced a dose-dependent increase in cytotoxicity, caspase-3 activation and PKCδ cleavage. H2O2-induced proteolytic activation of PKC was δ mediated by the activation of caspase-3. Most interestingly, both the general Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (25 μm) and the p60Src tyrosine-specific kinase inhibitor (TSKI; 5 μm) dramatically inhibited H2O2 and the Parkinsonian toxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium-induced PKCδ cleavage, kinase activation, and apoptotic cell death. H2O2 treatment also increased phosphorylation of PKCδ at tyrosine site 311, which was effectively blocked by co-treatment with TSKI. Furthermore, N27 cells overexpressing a PKCδY311F mutant protein exhibited resistance to H2O2-induced PKCδ cleavage, caspase activation, and apoptosis. To our knowledge, these data demonstrate for the first time that phosphorylation of Tyr-311 on PKCδ can regulate the proteolytic activation and proapoptotic function of the kinase in dopaminergic neuronal cells.

Kanthasamy A. Kitazawa M. Anantharam V. Kanthasamy A.G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 1387-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). PKCδ is a member of the PKC serine-threonine protein kinase family classified into three groups, namely the classical (α, β, and γ activated by DAG and Ca2+), the atypical (ζ and λ/ι DAG and Ca2+-independent), and the novel (δ, ϵ, η, and [phis] activated by DAG but Ca2+-independent). PKCδ activation requires either the phosphorylation of its activation loop residues, leading to enzyme translocation, or the proteolytic cleavage of the kinase to yield catalytically active fragments. In the cellular models of Parkinson disease, we observed a caspase-3 mediated activation of PKCδ without any evidence of membrane translocation (1.Kaul S. Kanthasamy A. Kitazawa M. Anantharam V. Kanthasamy A.G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 1387-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). PKCδ is known to be phosphorylated at tyrosine residues Tyr-52, Tyr-155, Tyr-187, Tyr-311, Tyr-332, and Tyr-565 when activated in response to certain stimuli, particularly to the known oxidative stress-inducing agent hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (19.Denning M.F.

Other members of the Src family of kinases that influence PKCδ activity via phosphorylative changes are Fyn and c-Abl kinase (26.Sun X. Wu F. Datta R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol.

Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that PKCδ, when phosphorylated on the tyrosine residue Tyr-311, exhibits an increased catalytic activity in H2O2-treated cells (28.Rybin V.O. Guo J.

However, the relationship between PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation and its proteolytic cleavage has never been explored, particularly whether PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation can regulate its proteolytic activation and proapoptotic function. Here we demonstrate that phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue Tyr-311 in PKCδ is essential for proteolytic activation, and that inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation can attenuate oxidative stress-induced apoptotic cell death in dopaminergic neuronal cells.

Cell Culture—The immortalized rat mesencephalic dopaminergic neuronal cell line 1RB3AN27, normally referred to as N27 cells, was a kind gift from Dr. Kedar N. Prasad (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO). N27 cells represent a homogeneous population of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive dopaminergic cells.

The cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units of penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C as described previously (31.Prasad K.N. Clarkson E.D. La Rosa F.G. Edwards-Prasad J. Freed C.R. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1998; 65: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 32.Anantharam V. Kitazawa M. Wagner J. Kaul S. Kanthasamy A.G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1738-1751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment Paradigm—H2O2 (0-300 μm) or MPP+ (300 μm) was added to the cells for the duration of the experiment. The cells were removed from the flask by using a cell scraper and centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min, washed with PBS twice, and homogenized as described previously (1.Kaul S. Kanthasamy A. Kitazawa M. Anantharam V. Kanthasamy A.G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 1387-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Cell lysates, collected by spinning down the cell fragments at 20,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C, were used for immunoprecipitation studies to determine caspase-3 enzyme activity, DNA fragmentation, and PKCδ cleavage. Untreated cells were grown in the complete medium and used as control samples. For real time fluorescence imaging, the cells were grown in 24-well plates and viewed in the culture wells. Cytotoxicity Assays—Cell death was determined after exposing the N27 cells to H2O2 (100 μm) using the Sytox® green cytotoxicity assay and the LIVE/DEAD® viability/cytotoxicity kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The Sytox® green cytotoxicity assay is based on the principle that Sytox® green cannot enter cells with intact membranes (live cells) but permeates cells with compromised plasma membranes and intercalates with DNA to produce green fluorescence (36.Roth B.L. Poot M. Yue S.T. Millard P.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 2421-2431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Sherer T.B. Betarbet R. Stout A.K. Lund S. Baptista M. Panov A.V. Cookson M.R. Greenamyre J.T. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7006-7015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, N27 cells were grown in 24-well cell culture plates at equal densities and treated with H2O2 (0-300 μm) and 1 μm Sytox® green fluorescent dye for a period of 4 h. The Sytox® green assay allows dead cells to be viewed directly under the fluorescence microscope as well as quantitatively measured with a fluorescence microplate reader (excitation 485 nm; emission 538 nm) (SpectraMax Gemini XS model, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The LIVE/DEAD® kit consists of a combination of two dyes: SYTO 10 (green fluorescence), a highly cell permeable cell dye which stains all cells, and an ethidium homodimer (DEAD Red; red fluorescence), a membrane impermeant dye that only binds to nucleic acids in cells with compromised cell membranes. Fluorescent images were taken after exposure to H2O2 with a NIKON TE2000 microscope, and pictures were captured with a SPOT digital camera. In Situ Fluorometric Analysis of Caspase Activity—FITC-VAD-FMK, a cell-permeable fluorescent probe that binds to active caspase-3, was used as an in situ marker for caspase activity. The entire procedure was performed according to Promega's CaspACE® kit, as described previously (1.Kaul S. Kanthasamy A. Kitazawa M. Anantharam V. Kanthasamy A.G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 1387-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Fluorescent images were captured using a SPOT digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). Enzymatic Assay for Caspases—Caspase-3 activity was measured as described previously (32.Anantharam V. Kitazawa M. Wagner J. Kaul S. Kanthasamy A.G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1738-1751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Yoshimura S. Banno Y. Nakashima S. Takenaka K. Sakai H. Nishimura Y. Sakai N. Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Tsujimoto Y. Nozawa Y. J. Biol.

Acetyl-DEVD-amino-4-methylcoumarin (50 μm) was the fluorometric caspase-3 substrate used for the reaction. Enzymatic activity, measured using a Spectramax microplate reader at 405 nm, was represented as fluorescence units/mg of protein. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were collected after exposure to 100 μm H2O2, resuspended in 300 μl of homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin), sonicated, and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C (1.Kaul S. Kanthasamy A. Kitazawa M. Anantharam V. Kanthasamy A.G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 1387-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by 10-12% SDS-PAGE. PKCδ polyclonal (1: 2000), PKCδ-Tyr-311 (1:500), and β-actin (1:5000) antibodies were used to blot the membranes. Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit (1:2000) and anti-mouse (1:2000) were used for antibody detection with an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assay—Immunoprecipitation studies were conducted to determine the phosphorylative changes in the PKCδ protein obtained from H2O2-treated N27 cells. Briefly, cells were washed once with 1× PBS and resuspended in 500 μl of PKC lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, and 4 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin) (1.Kaul S. Kanthasamy A. Kitazawa M. Anantharam V. Kanthasamy A.G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 1387-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The cell suspension was kept on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min. The resultant supernatant was collected as the cytosolic fraction. Cytosolic protein (∼200 μg total) was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C using 20-40 μl of anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10)-agarose conjugated antibody. The Sepharose-bound antigen-antibody complexes were washed three times with buffer. Samples were then mixed with 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, boiled for 5 min, and then separated on 10-12% SDS-PAGE. For the kinase assay, the immunoprecipitation was done by using a polyclonal PKCδ rabbit antibody and protein-Sepharose A and washed three times with kinase buffer (40 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 20 mm MgCl2, 20 μm ATP, 2.5 mm CaCl2). The reaction was started by adding 20 μl of buffer containing 0.4 mg of histone and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (4,500 Ci/mm). After incubation for 10 min at 30 °C, SDS loading buffer (2×) was added to the samples to terminate the reaction. The reaction products were separated on SDS-PAGE (12.5%), and the H1-phosphorylated bands were detected using a Personal Molecular Imager (FX model, Bio-Rad Labs) and quantified with Quantity One 4.2.0 software. DNA Fragmentation Assay—DNA fragmentation was measured using a recently developed Cell Death Detection ELISA Plus assay kit, a fast, highly sensitive, and reliable assay for the detection of early apoptotic death (32.Anantharam V. Kitazawa M. Wagner J. Kaul S. Kanthasamy A.G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1738-1751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Reyland M.E. Anderson S.M. Matassa A.A. Barzen K.A. Quissell D.O. J. Biol.

Briefly, after treatment with 100 μm H2O2, the cells were spun down at 200 × g for 5 min and washed once with PBS. Cells were then lysed in 450 μl of lysis buffer (provided with the kit) and spun down again at 5,000 rpm for 10 min to collect the supernatant, which was used to measure DNA fragmentation as per the manufacturer's protocol. Readings were taken in a Spectramax multiwell plate reader at 405 nm, with 490 nm as a reference reading. Measurement of ROS Generation—The ROS generation in N27 cells was measured using the fluorescence probe dihydroethidine, as described previously (40.Bindokas V.P. Jordan J. Lee C.C. Miller R.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1324-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, N27 cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 2 × 106 cells per well for a period of 24 h prior to treatment. After 24 h, the RPMI culture medium was removed from the wells and replaced with clear HBSS medium supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2. 1 μm dihydroethidine (final concentration) was added to the HBSS for a period of 15 min. The cells were then treated with either H2O2 (100 μm) alone or along with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein (25 μm) and TSKI (5 μm) for a period of 1 h. After the 1-h incubation period, fluorescence was measured by using a microplate reader (Beckman and Coulter). The data were quantified using SpectraMax spectrophotometer analysis software. Transient Transfections—cDNA encoding PKCδ catalytic fragment (PKCδ-CF) from the pEGFPN1 vector was subcloned into the lentiviral expression vector plenti6/V5-d-TOPO (herein referred to as plenti/PKCδ-CF) by PCR using standard cloning procedures. PKCδY311F encoded in pcDNA3 vector encodes a protein in which tyrosine residue at position 311 is mutated to phenylalanine. The expression of PKCδ-CF in mammalian cells can be monitored by using an antibody directed against V5 epitope. Transfections of PKCδ-CF and PKCδY311F mutants were done by using an AMAXA® Nucleofector™ kit for cell lines (AMAXA GmbH, Germany). Plasmid pCDNA3.1 was used as vector control. Briefly, N27 cells were grown in T-175 flasks at a density of 3 × 106 per ml and harvested for the transfection procedure. The Nucleofector™ solution V was primed by adding a supplement solution (provided by manufacturer) and plasmid DNA. The cells were then resuspended in this DNA-containing Nucleofector solution at an optimal density of 3 million cells per 100 μl of solution. Electroporation was carried out with AMAXA® Nucleofector™ transfector instrument as per the manufacturer's protocol. The procedure was repeated for each subsequent sample. 100 μl of cell suspension containing 5 μg of pmax GFP DNA (provided with the kit) was used to determine the transfection efficiency. The transfected cells were then transferred to T-75 flasks or 6-well plates as desired and allowed to grow for a 24-h period before being used for the treatment paradigm. Transfection efficiency was determined to be >75% as determined by GFP expression. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed with Prism 3.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Bonferroni's and Dunnett's multiple comparison testing were used in order to delineate significant differences between the MPP+-treated groups and the control (untreated) and the inhibitor-treated samples. Differences with p < 0.05, p < 0.01, and p < 0.001 were considered to be statistically significant and are indicated by asterisks in the figures. Low Dose H2O2 Exposure Induces Dose-dependent Cell Death in Dopaminergic Neuronal Cells—H2O2 is an oxidative insult commonly used to investigate oxidative stress-induced apoptotic signaling in many cell types including dopaminergic neuronal cells (41.Chang H. Oehrl W. Elsner P. Thiele J.J. Free Radic. Res. 2003; 37: 655-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 42.Kumar S. Bharti A. Mishra N.C. Raina D. Kharbanda S. Saxena S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17281-17285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To determine the effects of low dose oxidative stress on the dopaminergic system, we treated mesencephalic dopaminergic clonal cells (N27) with low doses of H2O2 (0-300 μm) for a period of 4 h, and cytotoxicity was assayed at 1-h intervals over the entire treatment period. Fig. 1A demonstrates a fluorescent image from a group of N27 cells treated with H2O2 (100 μm) for 4 h and assayed for cell death by a LIVE/DEAD® viability/cytotoxicity kit (Molecular Probes). H2O2 treatment induced a clear increase in the number of dead cells, as evident from the increase in red fluorescence-labeled cells (dead cells) compared with the number of cells exhibiting green fluorescence (live cells). In untreated cells, only a very few red fluorescence-positive cells were observed. We also measured the cytotoxicity both qualitatively and quantitatively by using another fluorescence dye Sytox® green, which stains only dead/dying cells. Fig. 1B is representative of untreated N27 cells (top row) and cells treated with H2O2 (100 μm) at the end of a 4-h treatment period (bottom row) in both phase contrast and FITC fluorescence imaging. An increase in green fluorescence indicates an increase in cell death in H2O2-treated cells, because the Sytox® green dye only permeates compromised cell membranes to stain the nuclear chromatin. Fig. 1C depicts the quantitative measurement by a microplate reader of Sytox® green fluorescence and demonstrates a dose-dependent increase of cell death in N27 cells treated with varying doses of H2O2 (0-300 μm). H2O2 increased cytotoxicity by 216, 380, 468, and 638% over untreated controls at 10, 30, 100, and 300 μm concentrations 4 h after exposure, demonstrating dose-dependent oxidative stress-induced cell death in N27 cells. Because 100 μm H2O2 consistently induced significant oxidative damage in these cells, we used this concentration for all subsequent experimental analyses in this study. H2O2 Induces a Time-dependent Increase in Caspase-3-mediated Cellular Apoptosis in N27 Dopaminergic Cells—To determine whether apoptotic cell death occurs during H2O2 treatment, we measured the activity of the key apoptotic cellular enzyme caspase-3 as well as the extent of DNA fragmentation in the treated cells. H2O2 (100 μm) induced a time-dependent increase in caspase-3 activity over a 4-h treatment period (Fig. 2A). Treatment with 100 μm H2O2 induced 260, 438, 1055, and 1369% increases in caspase-3 activity in N27 cells at 90, 120, 150, and 240 min post-exposure. We further confirmed the activation of caspases during oxidative insult by labeling the activated caspase enzyme with the fluorescent substrate Z-VAD-FITC followed by observation under a fluorescence microscope (Fig. 2A, inset). H2O2 treatment induced a significant increase in the fluorescent labeling of the N27 cells after the 4-h post-exposure as compared with the untreated cells. Cellular apoptosis is often marked by the final precipitating events of chromatin breakdown and DNA fragmentation, which are considered hallmarks of programmed cell death. Therefore, we determined the extent of DNA fragmentation following H2O2 treatment in N27 cells using a DNA ELISA technique. H2O2 (100 μm) induced time-dependent increases in DNA fragmentation of 109, 154, and 392% at 1, 2, and 4 h, respectively, as compared with the untreated cells (Fig. 2B). Together, these data clearly indicate that N27 dopaminergic cells are highly sensitive to low dose oxidative stress and can undergo activation of caspase-3 and subsequent DNA fragmentation. Oxidative Stress Induces Caspase-3-mediated Proteolytic Cleavage of PKCδ—We showed previously (1.Kaul S. Kanthasamy A. Kitazawa M. Anantharam V. Kanthasamy A.G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 1387-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 32.Anantharam V. Kitazawa M. Wagner J. Kaul S. Kanthasamy A.G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1738-1751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that apoptotic cell death is mediated by caspase-3-dependent proteolytic activation in Parkinson disease models. To determine whether oxidative stress induces the proteolytic activation of PKCδ in dopaminergic neuronal cells, we examined the effect of H2O2 on PKCδ cleavage in N27 cells. H2O2 (100 μm) induced a time-dependent proteolytic cleavage of the full-length PKCδ (72-74 kDa) to cleaved catalytically active fragments migrating at 42 and 38 kDa, respectively (Fig. 3A). Additionally, H2O2-induced PKCδ cleavage was completely inhibited by co-treatment with 50"

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Set1 has been identified as the sole histone methyltransferase required for histone H3 lysine 4 (Lys4) methylation. Yeast cells that do not express Set1 have several apparent phenotypes, including slow growth and defects in telomere, HML, and rDNA silencing. However, the mechanism by which the Set1 methyltransferase mediates differential histone H3 methylation (mono-, di-, and tri-) is still not understood, and the involvement of domains or regions in Set1 contributing to H3 Lys4 methylation has not been well characterized. In this study, the N terminus of Set1 was shown to be important for global and gene specific histone H3 trimethylation. We show that Set1 trimethyl-defective mutants can rescue a set1Δ slow growth defect. In contrast, Set1 trimethyl mutants were defective in telomere, rDNA, HML, and HMR silencing. Taken together, these data suggest that histone H3 Lys4 trimethylation is required for proper silencing, while mono- and/or dimethylation is sufficient for cell growth.

The existence of histone methylation has been known for over 30 years (1.Murray K. Biochemistry. 1964; 127: 10-15Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and recently site specific histone methylation and the corresponding methyltransferases have been identified (2.Lachner M.

Biol. 2004; 14: R546-R551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). The catalytic core for most histone lysine methyltransferases resides in the SET domain (2.Lachner M.

Ponting C.P. Allis C.D. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2000; 406: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2132) Google Scholar). The SET domain is an evolutionarily conserved motif, with homologues present in organisms ranging from yeast to humans (5.Jenuwein T. Laible G. Dorn R. Reuter G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 80-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Set1 is the sole methyltransferase responsible for histone H3 lysine 4 (H3 Lys4) methylation and catalyzes the addition of up to three methyl groups to its substrate resulting in mono-, di-, or trimethylated lysine 4 (6.Briggs S.D.

Purification of Set1 indicates that Set1 is in a high molecular weight complex with seven other proteins (Swd1, Swd2, Swd3, Bre2, Sdc1, Spp1, and Shg1) and together with Set1 is referred to as COMPASS or SET1C (8.Nagy P.L.

Several of the Set1-associated proteins are also critical for Set1-mediated histone H3 Lys4 methylation suggesting that their interactions with Set1 regulate enzymatic activity or targeting of Set1 to chromatin (8.Nagy P.L.

Furthermore, several of their complex members have been identified as the human homologues of the proteins associated with Set1 (14.Miller T. Krogan N.J. Dover J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P.

In budding yeast, H3 Lys4 trimethylation and Set1 are highly concentrated at chromatin near the 5′ ends of open reading frames and is associated with transcriptionally active chromatin (7.Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Sherriff J. Bernstein B.E. Emre N.C.T. Schreiber S.L. Mellor J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2002; 419: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar, 19.Ng H.H. Robert F.

In contrast, H3 Lys4 dimethylation can be located at intergenic regions, promoters, and open reading frames (13.Bryk M. Briggs S.D. Strahl B.D. Curcio M.J. Allis C.D. Winston F. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 165-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 19.Ng H.H. Robert F. Young R.A. Struhl K. Mol.

Therefore, it is thought that H3 Lys4 dimethylation is more global and is located at regions of chromatin that are transcriptionally active, competent for transcription, or transcriptionally repressed (7.Santos-Rosa H.

These results indicate that the different forms of H3 Lys4 methylation may have distinct and/or overlapping biological roles. However, the mechanism by which Set1 methyltransferase differentially methylates H3 (mono-, di-, and tri-) is still not understood, and potential domains within Set1 that regulate H3 Lys4 methylation have not been well characterized. Set1 and COMPASS subunits have also been found to interact with the CTD of RNA polymerase II when it is phosphorylated at serine 5, and this interaction is dependent on the Paf1 elongation complex (19.Ng H.H. Robert F. Young R.A. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 709-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar, 21.Krogan N.J. Dover J. Wood A. Schneider J. Heidt J.

In addition, yeast deletion strains of Paf1 complex members lack both H3 Lys4 and Lys79 methylation (19.Ng H.H. Robert F. Young R.A. Struhl K. Mol.

Osley M.A. Strahl B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 637-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Based on these observations and chromatin localization studies of Set1 and Lys4 methylation, it has been proposed that H3 Lys4 methylation may play a role in transcription activation and/or elongation (19.Ng H.H. Robert F. Young R.A. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 709-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar, 21.Krogan N.J. Dover J. Wood A. Schneider J. Heidt J.

However, the exact mechanism by which Set1 and H3 Lys4 methylation functions in these processes is still poorly understood. In this study, we generated N-terminal Set1 deletion mutants that lack global and gene specific H3 Lys4 trimethylation while maintaining normal levels of mono- and dimethylated H3 Lys4. We determined that the putative RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain in the N terminus of Set1 is needed for histone H3 Lys4 trimethylation. Using Set1 trimethyl-defective mutants, we showed that histone H3 Lys4 trimethylation alone is required for proper silencing of telomeres, rDNA, HML, and HMR loci, while only mono- and dimethylation were sufficient for proper cell growth suggesting that the different forms of histone H3 Lys4 methylation are playing distinct biological roles. Yeast Plasmids and Strains—Construction of the plasmid expressing FLAG-tagged full-length Set1 (1-1080) and Set1 (780-1080) has been described previously (6.Briggs S.D. Bryk M. Strahl B.D. Cheung W.L. Davie J.K. Dent S.Y.R. Winston F. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The N-terminal truncation of Set1 (829-1080) was made by PCR amplification of the desired region of Set1 using the full-length SET1 plasmid as template. All constructs were engineered with a single FLAG epitope at the N terminus and subcloned into a yeast expression plasmid under the control of the ADH1 promoter and containing a URA3 or TRP1 selectable marker. The RRM deletion mutant (1-1080 ΔRRM) was made via site-directed deletion using the Stratagene Quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit. Briefly, complementary oligonucleotides were designed that had homology both to the regions immediately upstream and downstream of the region to be deleted. PCR amplification of the template (Set1 1-1080) and subsequent steps were performed as described by the manufacturer.

Preparation of Yeast Whole Cell Extracts and Immunoprecipitations—For analysis of yeast histones, yeast whole cell extracts were prepared as follows: 5-ml cultures of yeast were grown to mid-log phase (A600 = 1.0). Cells were harvested, washed with water and resuspended in 250 μl of 2 m NaOH with 8% β-mercaptoethanol. Cells were incubated on ice for 5 min and then pelleted at 13,000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended gently in 250 μl of Buffer A (40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 350 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and pelleted as described above. Cell pellets were resuspended in 180 μl of 2× SDS-sample buffer. Five μl or 10 μl of each sample were loaded per lane for Western blotting. For immunoprecipitation of yeast Set1, 50-ml cultures of MBY1198 and MBY1217 expressing blank vector or the indicated FLAG-Set1 (1-1080) or FLAG-tagged Set1 mutants (1-1080 ΔRRM, 780-1080 and 829-1080) were grown to mid-log phase and harvested. Cells were washed with water, resuspended in Buffer A (see above) and lysed with glass beads using a mini-bead beater (Biospec Products). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and removed to a new tube. M2 resin (Sigma) was added (10 μl) to each lysate and rotated at 4 °C for 2 h. M2 resin was pelleted by spinning at 3000 rpm in a microcentrifuge and washed two times for 5 min each with 1 ml of Buffer A. Immunoprecipitated Set1 was eluted from the M2-resin by the addition of 10 μl of 2× SDS-Laemmli sample buffer. Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Western blot analysis to detect methylated histones was performed as described previously (6.Briggs S.D. Bryk M. Strahl B.D. Cheung W.L. Davie J.K. Dent S.Y.R. Winston F. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). To detect FLAG-Set1, immunoprecipitates were resolved on 8% or 10% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to PVDF 1The abbreviations used are: PVDF, polyvinylidene fluoride; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid; RRM, RNA recognition motif. membrane, and immunoblotted with monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody. Western blots directed against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were also performed on the IP input to control for protein levels (data not shown). Chromatin Immunoprecipitations—For analysis of PYK1, 100-ml cultures were grown as described (19.Ng H.H. Robert F. Young R.A. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 709-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures were grown in YP-ethanol (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% ethanol) to mid-log phase (A600 = 1.0) and split. Cells were washed and resuspended in either 50 ml of YP-ethanol or YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) to induce expression of PYK1. Cells were induced for 1.5 h, harvested, and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde. For analysis of GAL10, cultures were grown as described previously (26.Carvin C.D. Kladde M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33057-33062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100-ml cultures were grown in SC media (0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base supplemented with amino acids, 2% glucose) lacking uracil overnight and split. Cells were harvested and resuspended in either SC-Ura or SC-Ura containing 0.5% glucose and 2% galactose. Cells were induced for 4 h, harvested, and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde. Chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously using H3 Lys4 dimethyl- and H3 Lys4 trimethyl-specific antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology) (27.Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Methods. 1999; 19: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by PCR using primers that have been described previously to analyze the promoter, 5′ and 3′ regions of PYK1 and GAL10 (19.Ng H.H. Robert F. Young R.A. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 709-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Two additional oligonucleotides were designed to analyze a region of the GAL10 promoter (-290 to -40 bp). Their sequences are as follows: 5′-CACGGAGGAGAGTCTTCCGTCGGAG-3′ and 5′-GGACGCAAAGAAGTTTAATAATCAT-3′. Growth and Silencing Assay—Growth assays were performed as follows. Yeast strains MSY421 and MBY1587 were transformed with plasmids to express wild type, epitope-tagged, FLAG-Set1 (1-1080), FLAG-Set1 ΔRRM (1-1080 ΔRRM), FLAG-Set1 (780-1080), FLAG-Set1 (829-1080), or blank vector. Cells were grown to mid-log phase (A600 = 1.0), serially diluted 5-fold, and plated on SC-Trp plates. Cells were photographed after 36 h at 30 °C. Telomere silencing assays were performed as described previously (11.Nislow C. Ray E. Pillus L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2421-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Briefly, strains UCC506 (MATa ade2-101 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 lys2-801 trp1-Δ1 ura3-52 URA::Tel-V-R) and UCC506 set1Δ were transformed with the above plasmids. Individual isolates were grown 3 days to saturation in SC-Trp, normalized for A600, serially diluted (2-fold), and spotted (5 μl/spot) on SC-Trp or SC-Trp plates containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) (100 μg/ml, Bio 101, Inc.). Cell growth was monitored over time at 30 °C. Cells on SC-Trp plates were photographed after 24 h, and cells on SC-Trp + 5-FOA were photographed after 60 h. rDNA, HML, and HMR silencing were performed as described previously (13.Bryk M. Briggs S.D. Strahl B.D. Curcio M.J. Allis C.D. Winston F. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 165-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 25.van Leeuwen F. Gafken P.R. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 2002; 109: 745-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). For rDNA silencing cells were grown 5 days to saturation, normalized for A600, serially diluted (4-fold), and spotted on SC-Trp or SC-Trp plates containing 5-FOA (100 μg/ml, Bio 101, Inc.). For HML and HMR silencing cells were grown overnight, diluted (5-fold), and spotted as described above. Cells on SC-Trp plates were photographed after 24 h. 5-FOA plates were photographed at 48 h. To investigate the importance of the N terminus of Set1 in regulating H3 Lys4 methylation, two FLAG-tagged N-terminal set1 deletion constructs (780-1080 and 829-1080) were generated (Fig. 1A) and expressed in a yeast strain in which the endogenous SET1 was deleted (set1Δ). To determine the histone H3 Lys4 methylation status in these cells, yeast set1Δ strains containing blank plasmid (Vector) and the two N-terminal set1 deletion constructs (780-1080 and 829-1080) were grown to an A600 = 1.0 and extracted with 2× SDS-Laemmli sample buffer. Clarified supernatants were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and probed with methyl-specific antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology) to mono-, di-, and trimethylated forms of histone H3 Lys4. As shown in Fig. 1B, H3Lys4 trimethylation was nearly abolished in set1Δ strains expressing N-terminal set1 deletion constructs (780-1080 and 829-1080). Trace amounts of H3 Lys4 trimethylation were detected after longer exposure time to film (Fig. 1B). Surprisingly, H3 Lys4 mono- and dimethylation were restored to similar levels to that of a wild-type isogenic strain, indicating that the N terminus of Set1 is specifically required for H3 Lys4 trimethylation. To confirm that the Set1 N-terminal deletion mutants (780-1080 and 829-1080) were expressed, mutant yeast strains were grown to an A600 = 1.0 and lysed using glass beads. Clarified supernatants were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG affinity resin (M2 resin, Sigma). Immunoprecipitates were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and probed with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies (M2, Sigma). Western blots indicated equal expression of the two N-terminal set1 deletion constructs (780-1080 and 829-1080) (Fig. 1B). No FLAG-Set1 deletion mutants were detected in the unbound fraction (data not shown). Besides the n-SET, SET, and post-SET domains of Set1, which are required for methyltransferase activity, the only other known domain found in Set1 is its putative RRM. The RRM is a domain commonly found in RNA-binding proteins and has been implicated in binding RNA, single-stranded DNA, as well as proteins (28.Stefl R. Skrisovska L. Allain F.H. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To test whether the putative RRM domain might be the region in the N terminus of Set1 that regulates H3 Lys4 trimethylation, we constructed a FLAG-tagged Set1 expression construct that lacked this domain (Fig. 1A). This deletion construct was expressed in the set1Δ strain and examined for H3 Lys4 methylation status. As shown in Fig. 1C, the Set1 ΔRRM (1-1080 ΔRRM) mutant restored H3 Lys4 mono- and dimethylation levels similar to wild-type cells and full-length Set1 (1-1080). Similar to the N-terminal Set1 deletion mutants (780-1080 and 829-1080), H3 Lys4 trimethylation was nearly abolished in the Set1 ΔRRM (1-1080 ΔRRM) mutant strain (Fig. 1C). Again, longer exposure time to film indicated the presence of trace amounts of H3 Lys4 trimethylation (Fig. 1C). Together these data suggest the RRM domain is at least one domain within the N terminus of Set1 that is needed for trimethylation. In further support of our data, Schlichter and Cairns (29.Schlichter A. Cairns B.R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1222-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) recently published a similar result showing that the RRM domain of Set1 is required for H3 Lys4 trimethylation. To determine the levels of protein expression, full-length FLAG-Set1 (1-1080) and FLAG-Set1 ΔRRM (1-1080 ΔRRM) were immunoprecipitated from whole cell extracts and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 1C). Our results showed expression of both full-length Set1 (1-1080) and Set1 ΔRRM (1-1080 ΔRRM). However, lower levels of Set1 ΔRRM (1-1080 ΔRRM) mutant protein were detected when compared with full-length Set1 (1-1080) (Fig. 1C). Again, no FLAG-Set1 (1-1080) or Set1 ΔRRM (1-1080 ΔRRM) was detected in the unbound fraction (data not shown). Together these data may indicate that the Set1 ΔRRM (1-1080 ΔRRM) mutant protein is less stable. Interestingly, Swd2, a Set1-associated protein, has been implicated in the protein stability of Set1 suggesting the possibility that Swd2 or other Set1-associated proteins (Swd1, Swd3, Spp1, Bre2, Sdc1, or Shg1) interact with the RRM domain to stabilize the protein levels of Set1 (30.Dichtl B. Aasland R. Keller W. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 965-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To examine the effects Set1 trimethyl-deficient mutants at the gene level, chromatin immunoprecipitations were preformed using H3 Lys4 di- and trimethyl-specific antibodies. The GAL10 and PYK1 loci, which are known targets of Set1 and H3 Lys4 methylation, were examined (19.Ng H.H. Robert F. Young R.A. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 709-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar, 31.Ezhkova E. Tansey W.P. Mol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 1867-1871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). A complete loss of H3 Lys4 trimethylation was observed at these loci in our set1Δ strain expressing Set1 829-1080 under conditions in which GAL10 and PYK1 were either induced (Fig. 2) or uninduced (data not shown). Importantly, the level of H3 Lys4 dimethylation was similar to that of wild type cells (Fig. 2). Together these data suggest that our Set1 trimethyl-deficient mutants are still targeted to chromatin and are competent to dimethylate chromatin templates. With the establishment of Set1 mutants that are defective for H3 Lys4 trimethylation but not mono- or dimethylation, we wanted to determine whether differential methylation of H3 Lys4 played a distinct biological function. Deletion of SET1 in S. cerevisiae leads to the loss of telomere, HML, and rDNA silencing (6.Briggs S.D. Bryk M. Strahl B.D. Cheung W.L. Davie J.K. Dent S.Y.R. Winston F. Allis C.D.

Biol. 2002; 12: 165-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In addition, some yeast strains deleted for SET1 also demonstrate a slow growth phenotype (6.Briggs S.D. Bryk M. Strahl B.D. Cheung W.L. Davie J.K. Dent S.Y.R. Winston F. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). To examine the extent of H3 Lys4 methylation (mono-, di-, or trimethylation) associated with these known set1Δ phenotypes, we expressed full-length Set1 (1-1080), Set1 ΔRRM (1-1080 ΔRRM), and both N-terminal Set1 deletions (780-1080 and 829-1080) in set1Δ strains that either have growth or silencing defects (6.Briggs S.D. Bryk M. Strahl B.D. Cheung W.L. Davie J.K. Dent S.Y.R. Winston F. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 8.Nagy P.L. Griesenbeck J. Kornberg R.D.

Cell. 1997; 8: 2421-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To determine whether slow growth is the result of a loss in H3 Lys4 mono-, di-, or trimethylation, the yeast strain background, MSY421, was used. This strain was previously shown to have a significant growth defect when SET1 was deleted (6.Briggs S.D. Bryk M. Strahl B.D. Cheung W.L. Davie J.K. Dent S.Y.R. Winston F. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Both full-length Set1 (1-1080), Set1 ΔRRM (1-1080 ΔRRM), and the two N-terminal Set1 deletion mutants (780-1080 and 829-1080) were expressed in the MSY421 set1Δ strain. All cells were grown to A600 = 1.0, and 5-fold serial dilutions were spotted on plates containing synthetic complete media lacking uracil (SC-Ura, Bio 101, Inc.) and incubated at 30 °C. Interestingly, set1Δ strains expressing Set1 trimethylation mutants (1-1080 ΔRRM, 780-1080, and 829-1080) rescued the slow growth phenotype similar to that of full-length Set1 (Fig. 3). Furthermore, these data would suggest that mono- or dimethylation of H3 Lys4 or a combination of both is sufficient for proper cell growth. To determine whether the observed loss of telomere silencing in a set1Δ strain is the result of losing H3 Lys4 mono-, di-, or trimethylation, SET1 was deleted in a strain where a URA3 gene has been integrated at a subtelomere locus (24.Gottschling D.E. Aparicio O.M. Billington B.L. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 751-762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we observed that the set1Δ cells expressing Set1 ΔRRM (1-1080 ΔRRM) or N-terminal Set1 deletions (780-1080 and 829-1080) showed a dramatic sensitivity to 5-FOA (Bio 101, Inc.) as compared with both wild-type cells transformed with blank plasmid (Vector) or set1Δ cells expressing full-length Set1 (1-1080) (Fig. 4). Interestingly, cells expressing Set1 trimethylation mutants (1-1080 ΔRRM, 780-1080, and 829-1080) will eventually grow on 5-FOA plates, albeit in a diminished capacity, upon longer incubation periods at 30 °C (data not shown). This is consistent with our data indicating trace amount of H3 Lys4 trimethylation in cells expressing trimethyl-defective mutants (Fig. 1, B and C). Since these cells contain proper H3 Lys4 mono- and dimethylation, our data suggest that H3 Lys4 trimethylation is needed for proper telomere silencing. To determine whether silencing at rDNA, HML, and HMR loci is dependent upon H3 Lys4 trimethylation, similar assays, as described above, were performed in strains lacking Set1 and containing a URA3 gene integrated at the rDNA locus and the HMR and HML silent mating type loci (24.Gottschling D.E. Aparicio O.M. Billington B.L. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 751-762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar, 25.van Leeuwen F. Gafken P.R. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 2002; 109: 745-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). In all instances, cells that expressed Set1 mutants that are deficient for H3 Lys4 trimethylation exhibit sensitivity to 5-FOA as compared with both wild-type cells transformed with blank plasmid (Vector) or set1Δ cells expressing full-length Set1 (1-1080) (Fig. 4). This data again suggests that H3 Lys4 trimethylation is also needed for proper silencing at the rDNA, HML, and HMR loci. Interestingly, at the different silent loci, silencing seems to be compromised at varying degrees when SET1 is deleted or when expressing the Set1 trimethyl-deficient mutants in a set1Δ. Although the reason for this difference is not known, this has been commonly observed among other protein factors that disrupt silencing. However, various explanations could account for our observed differences. For example, the differences between HML and HMR silencing could be a consequence on how the URA3 gene was previously integrated in these strains. It has been shown previously that the URA3 gene is silenced better at the HML than HMR locus due to the way the gene was inserted (33.Singer M.S. Kahana A. Wolf A.J. Meisinger L.L. Peterson S.E. Goggin C. Mahowald M. Gottschling D.E. Genetics. 1998; 150: 613-632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, HMR silencing in this strain has been shown to be more sensitive to silencing defects than HML (33.Singer M.S. Kahana A. Wolf A.J. Meisinger L.L. Peterson S.E. Goggin C. Mahowald M. Gottschling D.E. Genetics. 1998; 150: 613-632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another strain difference is that HMR, HML, and rDNA strains contain one gene copy of histones H3 and H4, therefore histone amounts may also contribute to these silencing differences. Although we speculate that some of these differences are due to subtle strain differences, it is also possible these differences are due to the type or amount of protein factors (e.g. Sir proteins) that are required for silencing at each of these distinct loci (34.Rusche L.N. Kirchmaier A.L. Rine J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 481-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate a strong correlation between H3 Lys4 trimethylation and silencing. Although, the mechanism by which H3 Lys4 trimethylation regulates silencing is still unclear, it has been proposed that loss of histone methylation at H3 Lys4 and/or H3 Lys79 methylation allows promiscuous binding of Sir proteins to euchromatic regions, which results in titrating away Sir proteins from silent loci (35.van Leeuwen F. Gottschling D.E. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2002; 14: 756-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In support of this model, it has recently been shown that Sir3 localization is disrupted in a yeast strain expressing a catalytically inactive mutant of Set1 and that Sir3 can bind to unmodified histone peptides but not peptides trimethylated at H3 Lys4 (12.Santos-Rosa H. Bannister A.J. Dehe P.M. Geli V. Kouzarides T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47506-47512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It will now be interesting to determine whether similar results are observed using yeast strains lacking only H3 Lys4 trimethylation. However, other possibilities could still exist. For example, protein-protein interactions at the N terminus of Set1 may be needed for proper gene silencing, or Set1-mediated trimethylation may regulate expression of a known or unknown silencing factor(s). It has been indicated by several groups that H3 Lys4 trimethylation plays a role in transcriptional activation and/or elongation (7.Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Sherriff J.

Surprisingly, reverse transcription-PCR and quantitative real time PCR analysis revealed no significant changes in GAL1, GAL10, and PYK1 steady state mRNA levels under uninduced or induced conditions in either set1Δ cells or set1Δ cells expressing Set1 trimethyl-deficient mutants (data not shown). These data suggest that specific loss of H3 Lys4 trimethylation is not sufficient to disrupt transcription of these Set1 targeted genes. In addition, set1Δ and Set1 trimethyl-deficient mutant strains do not show a hypersensitive phenotype when plated on media containing 6-azauracil, suggesting they are not defective in transcriptional elongation. 2I. M. Fingerman and S. D. Briggs, unpublished observation. Further investigation will be needed to assess the precise role of Set1-mediated Lys4 trimethylation in transcriptional activation and elongation. In summary, this study demonstrates that a region outside the SET domain (i.e. the RRM domain or other domains in the N terminus of Set1) is required for regulation of Set1-mediated trimethylation. This is in contrast to Set7/9 and Dim5 histone methyltransferases in which a conserved tyrosine or phenylalanine residue within the SET domain mediates the degree of histone methylation (38.Zhang X.

In addition, Set1 trimethyl-specific mutants have allowed us to discover that differential H3 Lys4 methylation is required for distinct biological functions such as proper cell growth and telomere, rDNA, HML, and HMR silencing. Surprisingly, we were unable to determine a role for H3 Lys4 trimethylation in transcription. Further investigation will be needed to determine precise mechanism of how Set1-mediated Lys4 mono-, di-, and trimethylation can regulate these biological processes. Since Set1 exists in a high molecular weight complex, it is likely that Set1-associated factors will play a significant role in mediating the distinct forms of H3 Lys4 methylation (8.Nagy P.L.

https://openalex.org/W2039291159,"Human cardiac Troponin I (cTnI) is the first sarcomeric protein for which mutations have been associated with restrictive cardiomyopathy. To determine whether five mutations in cTnI (L144Q, R145W, A171T, K178E, and R192H) associated with restrictive cardiomyopathy were distinguishable from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-causing mutations in cTnI, actomyosin ATPase activity and skinned fiber studies were carried out. All five mutations investigated showed an increase in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of force development compared with wild-type cTnI. The two mutations with the worst clinical phenotype (K178E and R192H) both showed large increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity (Δ<i>p</i>Ca<sub>50</sub> = 0.47 and 0.36, respectively). Although at least one of these mutations is not in the known inhibitory regions of cTnI, all of the mutations investigated caused a decrease in the ability of cTnI to inhibit actomyosin ATPase activity. Mixtures of wild-type and mutant cTnI showed that cTnI mutants could be classified into three different groups: dominant (L144Q, A171T and R192H), equivalent (K178E), or weaker (R145W) than wild-type cTnI in actomyosin ATPase assays in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Although most of the mutants were able to activate actomyosin ATPase similarly to wild-type cTnI, L144Q had significantly lower maximal ATPase activities than any of the other mutants or wild-type cTnI. Three mutants (L144Q, R145W, and K178E) were unable to fully relax contraction in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The inability of the five cTnI mutations investigated to fully inhibit ATPase activity/force development and the generally larger increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity than observed for most hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutations would likely lead to severe diastolic dysfunction and may be the major physiological factors responsible for causing the restrictive cardiomyopathy phenotype in some of the genetically affected individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2067963578,"We have shown previously that diallyl trisulfide (DATS), a constituent of processed garlic, inhibits proliferation of PC-3 and DU145 human prostate cancer cells by causing G2-M phase cell cycle arrest in association with inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 activity and hyperphosphorylation of Cdc25C at Ser216. Here, we report that DATS-treated PC-3 and DU145 cells are also arrested in mitosis as judged by microscopy following staining with anti-α-tubulin antibody and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and flow cytometric analysis of Ser10 phosphorylation of histone H3. The DATS treatment caused activation of checkpoint kinase 1 and checkpoint kinase 2, which are intermediaries of DNA damage checkpoints and implicated in Ser216 phosphorylation of Cdc25C. The diallyl trisulfide-induced Ser216 phosphorylation of Cdc25C as well as mitotic arrest were significantly attenuated by knockdown of check-point kinase 1 protein in both PC-3 and DU145 cells. On the other hand, depletion of checkpoint kinase 2 protein did not have any appreciable effect on G2 or M phase arrest or Cdc25C phosphorylation caused by diallyl trisulfide. The lack of a role of checkpoint kinase 2 in diallyl trisulfide-induced phosphorylation of Cdc25C or G2-M phase cell cycle arrest was confirmed using HCT-15 cells stably transfected with phosphorylation-deficient mutant (T68A mutant) of checkpoint kinase 2.

For example, DADS inhibited proliferation of HCT-15 human colon cancer cells by causing G2-M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction (20.Sundaram S.G. Milner J.A. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 21.Knowles L.M. Milner J.A. Nutr. Cancer. 1998; 30: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 22.Knowles L.M. Milner J.A. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1129-1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In HCT-15 cells, accumulation of G2-M phase cells upon treatment with DADS was accompanied by an increase in cyclin B1 protein level, reduction in complex formation between cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) and cyclin B1, and hyperphosphorylation of Cdk1 (21.Knowles L.M. Milner J.A. Nutr. Cancer. 1998; 30: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 22.Knowles L.M. Milner J.A. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1129-1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DADS-induced apoptosis in HCT-15 cells correlated positively with an increase in the intracellular free calcium level (20.Sundaram S.G. Milner J.A. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell line, the DADS-induced apoptosis was associated with induction of Bax protein, down-regulation of Bcl-XL, and activation of caspase-3 (23.Nakagawa H. Tsuta K. Kiuchi K. Senzaki H. Tanaka K. Hioki K. Tsubura A. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 891-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Recently, we determined the effects of OSC analogues with varying oligosulfide chain length (diallyl sulfide, DADS, and DATS) on proliferation of human prostate cancer cells (29.Xiao D. Choi S. Johnson D.E. Vogel V.G. Johnson C.S. Trump D.L. Lee Y.J. Singh S.V. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5594-5606Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We found that DATS is a much more potent apoptosis inducer than either diallyl sulfide or DADS, indicating that even a subtle change in OSC structure (e.g. oligosulfide chain length) could have a significant impact on its biological activity (29.Xiao D. Choi S. Johnson D.E. Vogel V.G. Johnson C.S. Trump D.L. Lee Y.J. Singh S.V. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5594-5606Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We demonstrated further that the DATS-induced cell death in prostate cancer cells was due to c-Jun N-terminal kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-mediated phosphorylation of Bcl-2 (29.Xiao D. Choi S. Johnson D.E. Vogel V.G. Johnson C.S. Trump D.L. Lee Y.J. Singh S.V. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5594-5606Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Although significant progress has been made toward our understanding of the signal transduction pathways leading to OSC-mediated apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 30.Herman-Antosiewicz A. Singh S.V. Mutation Res. 2004; 555: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), the mechanism by which these highly promising cancer chemopreventive agents block cell cycle progression remains elusive.We have shown previously that DATS-induced G2-M phase cell cycle arrest in human prostate cancer cells is associated with reactive oxygen species-dependent destruction as well as hyper-phosphorylation of Cdc25C at Ser216 (31.Xiao D. Herman-Antosiewicz A. Antosiewicz J. Xiao H. Brisson M. Lazo J.S. Singh S.V. Oncogene. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). In the present study, we extended these observations, and determined the mechanism and functional significance of Cdc25C hyperphosphorylation in DATS-induced G2-M phase cell cycle arrest. Here, we demonstrate that DATS-treated PC-3 and DU145 cells are also arrested in M (mitotic) phase in association with activation of checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) and checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2). Furthermore, the present study indicates that the DATS-induced hyperphosphorylation of Cdc25C and mitotic arrest are significantly attenuated by siRNA-based knockdown of Chk1 protein. On the other hand, Chk2 protein knockdown does not affect DATS-induced G2 or mitotic block. In conclusion, the present study indicates that the DATS-induced mitotic arrest in human prostate cancer cells is regulated by Chk1, which is an intermediary of DNA damage checkpoint (32.Furnari B.

Briefly, exponentially growing cells were exposed to Me2SO (control) or DATS for the desired time periods. Both floating and adherent cells were collected, washed with PBS, fixed with 70% ethanol, stained with propidium iodide, and analyzed using a Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer as described by us previously (39.Singh S.V. Herman-Antosiewicz A. Singh A.V. Lew K.L. Srivastava S.K. Kamath R. Brown K.D. Zhang L. Baskaran R. J. Biol.

For PC-3 cells, the coding strands for Chk1 and Chk2 siRNA were GCGUGCCGUAGACUGUCCAdTdT and GAACCUGAGGACCAAGAACdTdT, respectively. Mock-treated cells as well as cells transfected with a nonspecific control siRNA (ACUCUAGCGCCAUCGUGCCUU (Dharmacon; PC-3 cells) or UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUdTdT (Qiagen; DU145 cells)) were used as controls. The coding strand for the Chk1 siRNA used for DU145 cells was GAAGCAGUCGCAGUGAAGAdTdT (Dharmacon). For transfection, cells were plated in 6-well plates and transfected at 30% confluence with siRNA duplexes (200 nm) using Oligofectamine according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After 24 h, cells were treated with DATS or Me2SO (control) for 8 h. Both floating and adherent cells were collected, washed with PBS, and processed for cell cycle analysis, determination of histone H3 phosphorylation, or immunoblotting as described above.Statistical Analysis—Paired t test or one-way analysis of variance (followed by Bonferroni's or Tukey's multiple comparison test) was used to test the significance of differences in measured variables between control and treated groups.RESULTSDATS Treatment Caused Mitotic Arrest in PC-3 Cells—We have shown previously that DATS-treated PC-3 and DU145 cells, but not a normal prostate epithelial cell line (PrEC), are arrested in the G2-M phase of the cell cycle in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (31.Xiao D. Herman-Antosiewicz A. Antosiewicz J. Xiao H. Brisson M. Lazo J.S. Singh S.V. Oncogene. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). The DATS-mediated G2-M phase cell cycle arrest in prostate cancer cells is associated with generation of reactive oxygen species, inhibition of Cdk1-cyclin B1 kinase activity, and accumulation of cyclin B1 protein (31.Xiao D. Herman-Antosiewicz A. Antosiewicz J. Xiao H. Brisson M. Lazo J.S. Singh S.V. Oncogene. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). In the present study, we extended these findings to gain further insights into the mechanism by which DATS inhibits cell cycle progression. In cycling cells, cyclin B1 protein level increases abruptly as the cells acquire 4N DNA content, peaks during the metaphase/anaphase transition, and declines precipitously upon completion of mitosis (40.Pines J. Hunter T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 41.Sherwood S.W. Rush D.F. Kung A.L. Schimke R.T. Exp.

Degradation of cyclin B1 is essential for mitotic exit (40.Pines J. Hunter T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 41.Sherwood S.W. Rush D.F. Kung A.L.

Cytometry. 1997; 27: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because DATS treatment caused accumulation of cyclin B1 protein (31.Xiao D. Herman-Antosiewicz A. Antosiewicz J. Xiao H. Brisson M. Lazo J.S. Singh S.V. Oncogene. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar), we hypothesized that DATS-treated PC-3 cells might be unable to exit mitosis. We explored this possibility by immunofluorescence microscopy following staining of control and DATS-treated PC-3 cells with anti-α-tubulin antibody and DAPI. As shown in Fig. 1A (panels a–c), a large fraction of control cells exhibited an intact microtubule network. On the other hand, the α-tubulin staining in DATS-treated PC-3 cells was restricted to small areas on the periphery of the nucleus. Moreover, the DAPI staining revealed an abundance of mitotic figures in a prometaphase and metaphase-like state with condensed chromatin in DATS-treated PC-3 cultures (identified by an arrow in panels d and e of Fig. 1A), which were less frequent in vehicle-treated controls (compare panels a–c in Fig. 1A for controls). The mitotic figures with condensed chromatin were scored in cultures of control and DATS-treated PC-3 cells, and the results are summarized in Fig. 1B. The percentage of mitotic figures was ∼4-fold higher in DATS treated PC-3 cultures compared with vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, DATS-treated PC-3 cultures also exhibited multinucleated cells (identified by an arrowhead in panel f of Fig. 1A), which were rarely seen in control cultures.The DATS-induced mitotic arrest was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis of Ser10 phosphorylation of histone H3, which has emerged as a sensitive marker for mitotic cells (37.Hendzel M.J. Wei Y. Mancini M.A. Van Hooser A. Ranalli T. Brinkley B.R. Bazett-Jones D.P. Allis C.D. Chromosoma. 1997; 106: 348-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). The Ser10 phosphorylation of histone H3 begins in prophase, peaks in metaphase, and declines during anaphase (43.Gurley L.R. D'Anna J.A. Barham S.S. Deaven L.L. Tobey R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 84: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 44.Paulson J.R. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6064-6072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Agents initiating premature chromosome condensation have been shown to increase Ser10 phosphorylation of histone H3 (45.Ajiro K. Nishimoto T. Takahashi T. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 976-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 1C, the Ser10 phosphorylation of histone H3 was increased by about 5-fold upon treatment of PC-3 cells with DATS compared with control. Collectively, these results indicated that DATS-treated PC-3 cells were arrested in mitosis.DATS Treatment Promoted Phosphorylation of Chk1 at Ser317 and Chk2 at Thr68 in PC-3 Cells—We have shown previously that the DATS-induced G2-M phase cell cycle arrest in PC-3 cells is associated with a marked increase in Ser216 phosphorylation of Cdc25C (31.Xiao D. Herman-Antosiewicz A. Antosiewicz J. Xiao H. Brisson M. Lazo J.S. Singh S.V. Oncogene. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar), which together with other Cdc25 family members plays an important role in activation of Cdk1-cyclin B1 kinase (47.Draetta G. Eckstein J. Biochim. Biophys.

Phosphorylation of Cdc25C at Ser216 is known to promote its retention in the cytoplasm due to increased binding with 14-3-3 (50.Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A.S. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). Although our previous work indicated an increase in binding of Cdc25C with 14-3-3β upon treatment with DATS (31.Xiao D. Herman-Antosiewicz A. Antosiewicz J. Xiao H. Brisson M. Lazo J.S. Singh S.V. Oncogene. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar), the kinases responsible for DATS-induced hyperphosphorylation of Cdc25C were not known. Several kinases including Chk1 and Chk2 have been shown to mediate Ser216 phosphorylation of Cdc25C in response to different stimuli (32.Furnari B. Rhind N. Russell P.

Chk1 and Chk2 are intermediaries of DNA damage checkpoints and activated in response to various stimuli including ionizing radiation and UV (32.Furnari B. Rhind N. Russell P.

Analysis of subcellular fractions of pea leaves and red beet roots established that GGH activity is confined to the vacuole and that this activity, if not so sequestered, would deglutamylate all cellular folylpolyglutamates within minutes. Purified pea leaf vacuoles contained an average of 20% of the total cellular folate compared with ∼50 and ∼10%, respectively, in mitochondria and chloroplasts.

Phytochemistry. 1992; 31: 2277-2282Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The tail critically affects the cofactor activity and transport of folates because most folate-dependent enzymes prefer polyglutamates, whereas most carriers prefer monoglutamates (3Shane B. Vitam.

By favoring protein binding, the tail also enhances folate stability, since bound folate is less prone to oxidative degradation (1Scott J. Rébeillé F. Fletcher J. J. Sci. Food Agric. 2000; 80: 795-824Crossref Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The enzyme that adds the polyglutamyl tails, folylpolyglutamyl synthetase, has been well studied in plants and shown to have mitochondrial, plastidial, and cytosolic isoforms (5Cossins E.A. Can. J.

Biochemical characterization of plant GGHs has so far been limited to crude extracts (9Rickle S.A. Xu H. Liu C.Y. Morris P.F. Graham J.S. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 1526Google Scholar, 10Wu K.

Phytochemistry. 1993; 32: 1109-1117Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and has produced conflicting results on the enzyme structure and mode of action. Furthermore, the subcellular location of plant GGH is unclear; cytosolic (11Lin S. Rogiers S. Cossins E.A. Phytochemistry. 1993; 32: 1109-1117Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) or extracellular (12Huangpu J. Pak J.H. Graham M.C. Rickle S.A. Graham J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) sites have been proposed, but the vacuole is another a priori possibility (11Lin S. Rogiers S. Cossins E.A.

Wherever it is, plant GGH must be sequestered away from folate polyglutamates, since extractable GGH activities are typically enough to deglutamylate all cellular folate within minutes (7Leichter J.

Verhoef P. Konings E.J. Van Dusseldorp M. Matser A. Hollman P.C. Meyboom S. Kok F.J. West C.E. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2002; 50: 3473-3478Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Nor is much known about the subcellular distribution in plants of the folate polyglutamate substrates of GGH, i.e. about the glutamyl tail lengths, one-carbon (C1) substituents, and oxidation state of the folates in different organelles. The only data are for pea leaves, in which penta- and tetraglutamates of 5-formyl-THF and THF appear to predominate in mitochondria and 5-methyl-THF (of unknown tail length) elsewhere (15Besson V. Rébeillé F. Neuburger M. Douce R. Cossins E.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16Chen L. Chan S.Y. Cossins E.A.

There are, however, some data for pea on the distribution of total folate. Mitochondria, plastids, and a fraction composed mainly of the cytosol and vacuole accounted for 11–30, 3–11, and 60–80%, respectively, of leaf folate (17Chan S.Y. Cossins E.A. Pteridines. 2003; 14: 67-76Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 18Gambonnet B. Jabrin S. Ravanel S. Karan M. Douce R. Rébeillé F. J. Sci.

Besides not distinguishing among folate forms, these data leave open the key question of whether vacuoles contain folates. Knowing whether folates or GGH occur in vacuoles is important for several reasons. If vacuoles store folates, the transport or storage processes might be engineered to enhance folate accumulation (20Hossain T. Rosenberg I. Selhub J. Kishore G. Beachy R. Schubert K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5158-5163Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 21Diaz de la Garza R. Quinlivan E.P. Klaus S.M. Basset G.J. Gregory III, J.F. Hanson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, if GGH is vacuolar, the situation could be as in mammals, where lysosomes do not store folates but import folate polyglutamates, hydrolyze them, and export monoglutamates (23Sirotnak F.M. Tolner B. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 91-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 24Barrueco J.R. O'Leary D.F. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15356-15361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GGH also hydrolyzes the paminobenzoate (pABA) polyglutamates formed by oxidative degradation of folates (11Lin S. Rogiers S. Cossins E.A. Phytochemistry. 1993; 32: 1109-1117Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 25Suh J.R. Herbig A.K. Stover P.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 255-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), yielding p-aminobenzoyl glutamate (pABAGlu1). This may be the first step in the salvage of pABA for folate re-synthesis, a potentially crucial but unexplored process (22Hanson A.D. Gregory III, J.F. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In this study we used recombinant Arabidopsis GGHs to clarify the features of this enzyme in plants and showed that GGH is confined to vacuoles. We also determined the types and tail lengths of folates in organelles. This analysis revealed high levels of 5-methyl-THF polyglutamates in vacuoles. Chemicals and Reagents—Folic acid (PteGlu1), other folates, pABA polyglutamates (pABAGlun), and poly-γ-l-glutamates (γ-Glun) were from Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). 5,10-Methenyl-THF polyglutamates were made from the corresponding 5-formyl compounds (26Schirch V.

Macerozyme R-10 and Cellulase Onozuka R-10 were from Yakult Honsha (Tokyo, Japan). Ni2+-nitriloacetic acid superflow resin was from Qiagen. Percoll was from Amersham Biosciences. Other biochemicals were from Sigma. Plant Material—Pea plants (Pisum sativum cv. Laxton's Progress 9) were grown in vermiculite at 16–18 °C in 12-h days (75 microeinsteins m–2 s–1, Cool Light fluorescent tubes) for 12–18 days. Water was added only at sowing. Fresh red beet (Beta vulgaris) roots were purchased locally and used within 2 days. Subcellular Fractionation of Pea Leaves—Mitochondria and chloroplasts were purified on Percoll gradients (27Douce R. Bourguignon J. Brouquisse R. Neuburger M.

Protoplasts, vacuoles, and a cytosol-enriched fraction were prepared by modifying published methods (29Baldet P. Alban C. Axiotis S. Douce R. Arch. Biochem.

Briefly, expanded leaves were harvested after 12–24 h in the dark or dim light, cut into 1-mm strips, and washed in 10 mm MES/NaOH, pH 5.5, 0.5 m sorbitol, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.05% (w/v) PVP-40. A previously clarified (20,000 × g, 20 min) digestion medium containing 20 mg ml–1 cellulase and 5 mg ml–1 macerozyme in the same buffer was then added (10 ml/g of tissue) followed by incubation at 25 °C for 4 h in white fluorescent light (150 microeinsteins m–2 s–1) with rotary shaking (60 rpm). The released protoplasts were filtered through a 70-μm nylon mesh and purified on a three-step sucrose-sorbitol gradient as described (29Baldet P. Alban C. Axiotis S. Douce R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), except that the buffer contained 5 mm CaCl2 and the density of the bottom layer was increased by adding 10% (v/v) Percoll. A cytosolic fraction was prepared as described (29Baldet P. Alban C. Axiotis S. Douce R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) from protoplasts washed in 10 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.0, 0.5 m sorbitol, 5 mm CaCl2. To obtain vacuoles, washed protoplast suspensions (3–4 mg chlorophyll ml–1 corresponding to 4–5 × 107 protoplasts ml–1) were (i) rapidly diluted 1:10 in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.05% (w/v) PVP-40, (ii) gently stirred for 4 min, and (iii) loaded in 1.5-ml aliquots onto a 3-step gradient consisting of 5% Ficoll (5 ml, bottom), 3% Ficoll (2 ml, middle), and 0.5% Ficoll (1.5 ml, top), each in the above buffer. This procedure was scaled up as necessary. After centrifugation (30 min, 1000 × g, swinging bucket rotor without braking), intact vacuoles were recovered at the 3–0.5% Ficoll interface and used without further treatment. Organelle preparations for folate analysis were supplemented with 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at –80 °C. Enzymes were extracted from organelles by freezing in liquid N2 and thawing at 30 °C (3–5 cycles) then centrifuging at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. These extracts and cytosol fractions were desalted on PD-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm ascorbic acid and stored at –80 °C after freezing in liquid N2. GGH was assayed as outlined below. The marker enzymes α-mannosidase, NADP-linked glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, fumarase, and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) were assayed essentially as described (30Trossat C.

Fumarase was assayed in a separate set of freshly prepared extracts not desalted or desalted in 50 mm TricineNaOH, pH 8.4. Red Beet Root Vacuoles—Intact vacuoles were isolated essentially as described (33Leigh R.A. Branton D. Plant Physiol. 1976; 58: 656-662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that dithiothreitol replaced β-mercaptoethanol, and Histodenz™ replaced metrizamide. Sigma plant protease inhibitor mixture was added to all media except when vacuoles were assayed for GGH activity. Routinely, 450 g of roots were peeled, cut into 5-mm slices, and loaded into the slicing apparatus, which was set to a slice thickness of 0.1 mm and operated at ∼150 rpm. The slices and released cell contents were collected in 1 liter of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 m sorbitol, 5 mm EDTA, 15 mm dithiothreitol plus or minus 1 ml/liter protease inhibitor mixture and filtered through 2 layers of cheesecloth. The solid residue was sliced and filtered again, and the pooled filtrates were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The vacuole-enriched pellets were resuspended in 20 ml of 15% (w/v) Histodenz™ dissolved in buffer A (1.2 m sorbitol, 1 mm EDTA, 15 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm Tris-MES, pH 8.0, plus or minus 1 ml/liter protease inhibitor mixture). To prepare density gradients, 5-ml aliquots of the suspension in 15-ml disposable clinical centrifuge tubes were successively overlaid with 5 ml of 10% (w/v) Histodenz™ in buffer A and 2 ml of buffer A. Gradients were centrifuged at 650 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and vacuoles were collected from the 0/10% Histodenz™ interface. To remove most of the Histodenz™, the suspension was added to at least 2 volumes of buffer A and centrifuged at 650 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The final vacuole pellet was resuspended in 200–500 μl of resuspension medium or 200 μl of GGH assay buffer (see GGH Assay section, below), frozen in liquid N2, and held at –80 °C until analysis. Betanin contents of vacuoles and samples of the roots they came from were estimated spectrophotometrically (ϵ550 nm = 62,000 m–1 cm–1) (34Leigh R.A. Rees T. Fuller W.A. Banfield J. Biochem. J. 1979; 178: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Betanin was extracted from freeze-dried root samples by grinding in 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and centrifuging to clarify. Folate Analysis—Folates were extracted and analyzed by HPLC with electrochemical detection as described (21Diaz de la Garza R. Quinlivan E.P. Klaus S.M. Basset G.J. Gregory III, J.F. Hanson A.D.

Chem. 2000; 46: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Subcellular fraction samples were routinely thawed, made to 10 ml with extraction buffer (50 mm Hepes-50 mm CHES, pH 7.9, 2% (w/v) sodium ascorbate, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol), split in two, and processed plus or minus treatment with rat plasma conjugase. The folate binding column was scaled down from 5 to 1 ml, and the volumes of wash and eluting buffers were reduced proportionately. Beet root samples (8 g) were homogenized in 60 ml of extraction buffer; half the extract was conjugase-treated, and half was not. The HPLC column and mobile phase buffers were as described (21Diaz de la Garza R. Quinlivan E.P. Klaus S.M. Basset G.J. Gregory III, J.F. Hanson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13720-13725Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) with a 55-min (for monoglutamates) or 70-min (for polyglutamates) non-linear elution program. Detector response was calibrated using THF, 5-methyl-THF, 5,10methenyl-THF, 5-formyl-THF, and PteGlu1 standards. Triand pentaglutamate forms of 5-methyl-, 5-formyl-, and 5,10-methenyl-THF were used to identify retention times of polyglutamates. cDNAs and Expression in Escherichia coli—ESTs for genes At1g78660 (GenBank™ CF653065) and At1g78680 (GenBank™ AY096428) were obtained from the Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum für Genomforschung (Berlin, Germany) and the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Columbus, OH), respectively. Based on sequence alignments, constructs lacking ∼20 or ∼45 N-terminal residues were designed for each protein (see Supplemental Fig. 1). The corresponding cDNAs were amplified using Pfu polymerase and the primers shown in Table I, digested, and cloned between the NdeI and XhoI sites of pET28b (Novagen, Madison, WI). This fused the hexahistidine tag-containing sequence MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHM to the N terminus of the proteins. Constructs were made in E. coli DH10B cells, sequence-verified, and introduced into E coli BL21-CodonPlus® (DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene), which were grown at 27 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg ml–1 kanamycin and 20 μg ml–1 chloramphenicol until A600 reached 0.6. Isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added (final concentration 1 mm), and incubation was continued for 3 h at 27 °C.Table IPCR primers used to clone truncated Arabidopsis GGH sequences into pET28bGenePrimer sequence (5′ → 3′)AtGGH1 (At1g78660)FL: GATCGATCCATATGGAGGCTTCTGAGTCGATTFS: GATCGATCCATATGGTTTGCTCCTCGCCGGATR: TGATCCTCGAGTTAGAAACGGGATCTTGGTTAtGGH2 (At1g78680)FL: GATCGATCCATATGGCCAAGGCTGCGACGFS: GATCGATCCATATGGTATGCTCTGCTCCGGATR: TGATCCTCGAGTTAGAGAAGGGATCGTTGTT Open table in a new tab Protein Purification—Operations were at 0–4 °C. Cells from a 50-ml culture were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 1.5 m NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and broken in a Mini-BeadBeater (Biospec, Bartlesville, OK) using 0.1-mm zirconia/silica beads. After centrifugation (16,000 × g, 15 min), the supernatant was subjected to Ni2+ chelate affinity chromatography (0.5-ml column) following the manufacturer's protocol. Bound proteins were eluted using 250 mm imidazole and desalted on PD-10 columns in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. After storage at 4 °C or at –80 °C after freezing in liquid N2, the purified enzymes maintained full activity for several weeks and months, respectively. Protein was estimated by the Bradford method (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Experiments were run using a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge and an AN-60-Ti rotor at 25 °C. The proteins were dialyzed into 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm octyl β-glucoside. Buffer viscosity and density and protein partial specific volume ( v¯) were obtained from SEDNTERP software (www.jphilo.mailway.com). The v¯ values for AtGGH1 and AtGGH2 were, respectively, calculated from amino acid content to be 0.7324 and 0.7351 ml/g at 20 °C. In sedimentation velocity studies sample volume was 0.42 ml, and the reference volume of dialysis buffer was 0.44 ml. The samples were run at 50,000 rpm. Absorption measurements were made at 280 nm for AtGGH1 (0.8 mg/ml) and 230 nm for AtGGH2 (0.1 mg/ml). A single sample was run in each experiment with zero time between scans, Rmin was set at 6.0, and the samples were scanned from the earliest time until the boundaries reached the cell bottom. The samples were at thermal equilibrium before starting to spin the rotor, which was accelerated directly to 50,000 rpm. The data were analyzed using the c(s) and c(M) methods found in Sedfit (38Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3024) Google Scholar) (www.analyticalultracentrifugation.com). The sedimentation coefficients calculated from the Sedfit program were converted to s20,w values using Sedfit. GGH Assay—Standard assay mixtures contained folate pentaglutamate (PteGlu5) or pABAGlu5 (0.2 mm unless otherwise indicated), 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and enzyme in a final volume of 100 μl. After incubation for 0–6 h, the reaction was stopped by boiling for 3 min, then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min. Incubation was at 37 °C; no substantial difference in reaction rate was observed in the range 30–42 °C. Folate- or pABA-containing analytes in the supernatant were separated by HPLC using a C18 Symmetry column (Waters, 7.5 × 0.46 cm; 3-μm particle size) and quantified by absorption at 282 nm (292 nm for 5-methyl-THF) or by fluorescence (270-nm excitation, 350-nm emission), respectively. The column was eluted at 1.5 ml min–1 with a 10-min linear gradient from 15 to 45% (v/v) methanol in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 8 mm tetrabutylammonium bisulfate (buffer B). γ-Glun and glutamate were derivatized with o-phthalaldehyde (39Wang Y. Nimec Z. Ryan T.J. Dias J.A. Galivan J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1164: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), separated using the column above connected in series to a C18 Spherisorb ODS2 column (Waters, 15 × 0.46 cm; 5-μm particle size) and isocratic elution with 40% methanol buffer B, and quantified fluorometrically (365-nm excitation, 420-nm emission). For kinetic studies initial rates of substrate disappearance were measured (before an average of 25% of PteGlu5 or 3% of pABAGlu5 had been used). Rates were proportional to enzyme concentration and time. Kinetic constants were calculated from Hanes-Woolf plots. To determine specificity for the various γ-glutamyl bonds in PteGlu5 or pABAGlu5, residual substrate and the various PteGlun or pABAGlun products were determined, and the extent of hydrolysis (E) was plotted versus the relative concentration (R) of each PteGlun or pABAGlun species (40Bhandari S.D. Gregory III, J.F. Renuart D.R. Merritt A.M. J. Nutr. 1990; 120: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These terms are defined as follows. E=(XGlu4+XGlu3+XGlu2+XGlu1)(XGlu5+XGlu4+XGlu3+XGlu2+XGlu1)(Eq. 1) R=(XGlun)(XGlu5+XGlu4+XGlu3+XGlu2+XGlu1)(Eq. 2) where XGlun = PteGlun or pABAGlun. The slope of the line corresponding to each product measures the relative extent of its formation and so indicates the γ-glutamyl bond specificity of the enzyme. GGH-like Genes in Arabidopsis and Other Plants—BLAST searches of genome and EST databases at GenBank™ and The Institute for Genomic Research indicated that higher plants have one or a few genes encoding proteins similar to mammalian GGHs. For instance, rice and maize appear to have one gene, soybean and cotton two, Arabidopsis three, and tomato four. Arabidopsis is, thus, typical in having a small GGH gene family. The three Arabidopsis genes are tandemly arranged on chromosome 1 and specify proteins (AtGGH1, -2, and -3) that are ∼35% identical to human GGH and 70–80% identical to each other. As shown in Supplemental Fig. 1, the Arabidopsis proteins share many features with mammalian GGHs, including a predicted secretory pathway signal peptide (41Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (5622) Google Scholar, 42Carter C. Pan S. Zouhar J. Avila E.L. Girke T. Raikhel N.V. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3285-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), at least one N-glycosylation motif (13Galivan J. Ryan T.J. Chave K. Rhee M. Yao R. Yin D. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 85: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and the conserved cysteine and histidine residues that are catalytically essential in human GGH as well as six other conserved residues that may contribute to catalysis or substrate binding (43Chave K.J. Auger I.E. Galivan J. Ryan T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40365-40370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 44Li H. Ryan T.J. Chave K.J. Van Roey P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24522-24529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In contrast to these similarities, the AtGGH3 sequence has two short insertions near the N terminus that have no clear-cut counterparts in mammalian GGHs and are absent from all other available plant GGH sequences. Because AtGGH3 appears to be unique to Arabidopsis and, thus, not of general interest it was not further studied. This enzyme is also far less strongly expressed than AtGGH1 or -2. 2G. Orsomando and A. D. Hanson, unpublished information. Kinetic Characterization of GGH Proteins—Recombinant AtGGH1 and AtGGH2 were expressed in E. coli, removing the signal peptide region and replacing it with a sequence containing a histidine tag as was done for human GGH (43Chave K.J. Auger I.E. Galivan J. Ryan T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40365-40370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This strategy gave high levels of both proteins, which were purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography to >90% homogeneity as judged by SDS-PAGE (see Supplemental Fig. 2). Two versions of each enzyme were made, differing in how many residues were removed (see Supplemental Fig. 1). Because results for both versions were similar, we report data only for the shorter one.

Here we investigated the involvement of the common TLR adaptor molecule MyD88 in host responses to C. pneumoniae-induced pneumonia in mice. MyD88-deficient mice were severely impaired in their ability to mount an acute early inflammatory response toward C. pneumoniae. Although the bacterial burden in the lungs was comparable 5 days after infection, MyD88-deficient mice exhibited only minor signs of pneumonia and reduced expression of inflammatory mediators. MyD88-deficient mice were unable to up-regulate proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, demonstrated delayed recruitment of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells to the lungs, and were unable to clear the pathogen from their lungs at day 14. At day 14 the MyD88-deficent mice developed a severe, chronic lung inflammation with elevated IL-1β and IFN-γ leading to increased mortality, whereas wild-type mice as well as TLR2- or TLR4-deficient mice recovered from acute pneumonia and did not show delayed bacterial clearance. Thus, MyD88 is essential to recognize C. pneumoniae infection and initiate a prompt and effective immune host response against this organism leading to clearance of bacteria from infected lungs.

Thus, MyD88 is essential to recognize C. pneumoniae infection and initiate a prompt and effective immune host response against this organism leading to clearance of bacteria from infected lungs. Members of the family Chlamydiaceae are obligate intracellular pathogens that cause a wide variety of human diseases that include ocular, pulmonary, and genital infections (1Belland R. Ojcius D.M.

Within this family Chlamydia pneumoniae is in particular clinically important, not only because it has a worldwide distribution and is responsible for about 10% of community-acquired pneumonia and 5% of sinusitis and bronchitis, but also because it has been strongly implicated as a major contributor to vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis (2Campbell L.A.

Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6623) Google Scholar, 7Beutler B. Nature. 2004; 430: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). Association of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) with their cognate TLRs initiates signaling that requires assemblies of heteromeric complexes composed of dimerized TLRs, together with one or more adaptor molecules for effective downstream transmission and transcriptional responses that defend against the pathogen and activate a variety of other defensive mechanisms. Most (but not all) TLR signaling involves the adaptor molecule MyD88 (myeloid differentiation factor 88), but MyD88-independent responses are important though poorly understood. MyD88-/- mice are unable to mount a vigorous Th1 response, and instead Th2 polarization predominates. Whereas some studies indicate that long term adaptive responses may be preserved, other data support a model wherein adaptive responses are critically dependent upon intact TLR signaling, and hence MyD88 (8Doherty T.M. Arditi M. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 1699-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in some cases it appears that late activation of inflammatory cytokines can occur in the absence of MyD88. Mice deficient in MyD88 are markedly susceptible to systemic challenge with Staphylococcus aureus or Listeria monocytogenes (9Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5392-5396Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 10Seki E. Tsutsui H. Tsuji N.M. Hayashi N. Adachi K. Nakano H. Futatsugi-Yumikura S. Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Akira S.

MyD88-dependent responses were essential for effective lung defenses against pulmonary infection with Pseudomonas aeroginosa but not S. aureus (14Skerrett S.J. Liggitt H.D. Hajjar A.M. Wilson C.B. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 3377-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Therefore, the consequences of MyD88 deficiency appear to be both pathogen and tissue-specific, suggesting substantial complexity in innate defenses, whereby essential or redundant roles for specific components are dependent both on the nature and the site of infection (14Skerrett S.J. Liggitt H.D. Hajjar A.M. Wilson C.B. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 3377-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Several studies have investigated the potential interaction of C. pneumoniae with TLRs in vitro. Chlamydial heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) has been shown to signal via TLR4 (15Sasu S. LaVerda D. Qureshi N. Golenbock D.T. Beasley D. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 16Bulut Y. Faure E. Thomas L. Equils O. Arditi M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 987-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) and yet undefined non-LPS components of C. pneumoniae may stimulate cytokine release involving TLR2 (17Netea M.G. Kullberg B.J. Galama J.M. Stalenhoef A.F. Dinarello C.A. Van der Meer J.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1188-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The utilization of TLRs by live C. pneumoniae is not completely understood. The induction of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), a crucial step in the elimination of C. pneumoniae and both MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent signaling were found to be important and complementary for IFN-γ expression in macrophages after intracellular bacterial infection (18Rothfuchs A.G. Trumstedt C. Wigzell H. Rottenberg M.E. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 6345-6353Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To clarify the role of MyD88 signaling in host defense against C. pneumoniae, we inoculated MyD88-/- and wild-type mice intranasally with C. pneumoniae and compared the immune response and survival among the genotypes. We found that MyD88 is critically important for mounting a rapid and effective lung defenses against C. pneumoniae. In the absence of MyD88, an acute host defense against infection by C. pneumoniae does not occur, and infected mice rapidly succumb to infection. Surprisingly, we also found that a robust MyD88-independent inflammatory response does develop considerably later. MyD88-deficient mice were unable to clear bacteria and showed a severe, chronic lung inflammation with elevated systemic IL-1β and local IL-1β and IFN-γ concentrations, and intact adaptive immune responses with similar levels of C. pneumoniae-specific Abs to wild-type mice. These responses nevertheless were associated with decreased survival in C. pneumoniae-infected MyD88-deficient mice. Mice—MyD88-/-, TLR2-/-, and TLR4-/- mice were kindly provided by Dr. S. Akira (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). A homogenous population was established by backcrossing MyD88-, TLR2-, and TLR4-deficient mice to C57BL/6 mice for more than five generations. Mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions, and were used at 8 weeks of age. All experiments were done according to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. C. pneumoniae Infection—C. pneumoniae CM-1 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was propagated in HEp-2 cells as previously described (19Peterson E.M. Zhong G.M. Carlson E. de la Maza L.M. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 885-891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HEp-2 cells and the C. pneumoniae stocks were determined to be free of Mycoplasma contamination by PCR (20Ossewaarde J.M. de Vries A. Bestebroer T. Angulo A.F. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 328-331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were anesthetized with isofluorane prior to intranasal application of 5 × 106 IFU of C. pneumoniae suspended in sucrose-phosphate-glutamate buffer (40 μl per nostril). This buffer alone does not induce inflammation after intranasal application (data not shown). BAL was collected with 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The lavage fluid was centrifuged, and the supernatant was used for cytokine measurements. The pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and cell number was counted. Lungs were homogenized in 1 ml of sucrose-phosphate-glutamate medium and stored at -70 °C. HEp-2 cells contained in 1-dram glass vials were inoculated with 0.1 ml of undiluted and diluted lung homogenates. Cultures were centrifuged for 1 h at 30 °C, fed with E-MEM-S containing cycloheximide (1 μg/ml), incubated for 72 h, and fixed with methanol. Two mAbs, CP-20, and CP-33, which recognize the LPS and a 33-kDa protein of C. pneumoniae, respectively, were used to stain C. pneumoniae as previously described (21Peterson E.M. de la Maza L.M. Brade L. Brade H. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3848-3855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Histopathological Analysis—Lungs were fixed in formalin, paraffin-embedded, and hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections were evaluated by a trained pathologist blinded to the genotypes. The degree of inflammation was assigned an arbitrary score of 0 (normal = no inflammation), 1 (minimal = perivascular, peribronchial, or patchy interstitial inflammation involving less than 10% of lung volume), 2 (mild = perivascular, peribronchial, or patchy interstitial inflammation involving 10-20% of lung volume), 3 (moderate = perivascular, peribronchial, patchy interstitial, or diffuse inflammation involving 20-50% of lung volume), and 4 (severe = diffuse inflammation involving more than 50% of lung volume). Preparation of Bone Marrow-derived and Alveolar Macrophages—Mice were sacrificed, femurs, and tibias were excised and flushed with DMEM (Cellgro, Los Angeles, CA) containing 10% FCS (Invitrogen, Life Technologies) and antibiotics/antimycotics (Invitrogen). Bone marrow cells were treated with red blood cell lysis buffer (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) and incubated in DMEM/10% FCS containing 10 ng/ml M-CSF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Medium was changed at days 3 and 5 (10 ng/ml M-CSF at day 3, no M-CSF at day 5). Macrophages were seeded onto 96-well tissue culture plates (5 × 104 cells/well) at day 6 and stimulated the next day for another 24 h in DMEM/10% FCS supplemented with 10 mg/ml gentamycin (Invitrogen) as indicated. For the preparation of alveolar macrophages, mice were sacrificed, and the trachea was surgically exposed. A 22G intravenous catheter (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) was inserted and secured with a suture, followed by injection of 5 × 1 ml of ice-cold HBSS (Invitrogen) containing 2 mm EDTA and collection of the aspirate. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once in DMEM/10% FCS/gentamycin and counted. We routinely isolated 1.5-3.0 × 105 cells per animal. Macrophages were transferred to 96-well tissue culture plates at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/well. After 4 h, macrophages were washed once to remove non-adherent cells and stimulated for 24 h in DMEM/10% FCS/gentamycin as indicated. Cytokine ELISAs and Measurements of C. pneumoniae-specific Total IgG—The cytokine concentrations in the serum, BAL, lung homogenates, or culture supernatant were analyzed using OptEIA™ Mouse IL-1β, IL12p40, and IL-6 (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ), DuoSet™ MCP-1 (JE/CCL2), MIP-2 (R&D Systems), and Mouse IFN-γ ELISA (eBioscience). An ELISA was used to determine serum titers to C. pneumoniae-specific total IgG as described previously (22Pal S. Luke C.J. Barbour A.G. Peterson E.M. de la Maza L.M. Vaccine. 2003; 21: 1455-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry Analysis—The lymphocytes distributed in the lungs after infection were analyzed by flow cytometry of lung homogenates. Briefly, lymphocytes were isolated by digesting the lung tissue at 37 °C for 1 h with RPMI medium containing 1 mg/ml collagenase A (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis IN) and 50 units/ml DNase and filtering through a 100-μm cell strainer (BD Falcon, Bedford, MA). Erythrocytes were depleted by lysis buffer before further analysis. Isolated single cells were stained with appropriate antibodies against cell surface markers. Specifically, for T cell phenotyping, lymphocytes were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD8α mAb, PE-conjugated anti-CD4 mAb, or APC-conjugated anti-CD3e mAb (BD Biosciences). Data of multicolor-stained lymphocytes were then collected on a FACSCalibur™ flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using CELLQuest™ software. Statistics—Data are reported as mean values ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test or Mann-Whitney U test. Statistical significance for survival studies was determined by Fisher's exact test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. MyD88 Deficiency Protects Mice from Acute Lung Inflammation on Day 5 of a C. pneumoniae Infection but Leads to Severe Chronic Lung Inflammation at Days 14 and 35—To investigate the role of MyD88 in host defense against an acute C. pneumoniae infection MyD88-/- and MyD88+/+ mice were inoculated intranasally with C. pneumoniae and sacrificed at day 5 postinoculation. Macroscopically, gross examination of the infected lungs demonstrate severe inflammation as apparent by more consolidation with pale, tan firm cut surfaces in MyD88+/+ mice, whereas MyD88-/- mice did not show macroscopic signs of inflammation (Fig. 1A). On day 5, the lungs revealed patchy interstitial and diffuse pneumonia with massive infiltration of neutrophils into lung tissue in MyD88+/+ mice, whereas MyD88-/- mice showed significantly less or no signs of lung inflammation (Fig. 1B). The lung inflammation severity score for MyD88+/+ was significantly higher (p < 0.01) in infected MyD88+/+ mice compared with MyD88-/- mice on day 5 (Fig. 1C). However, there was a dramatic reversal of the lung histopathology at days 14 and 35. Whereas MyD88+/+ mice had cleared the lung inflammation, MyD88-/- mice now developed a severe, diffuse, and chronic lung inflammation, with a significantly higher lung inflammation score (p < 0.05) compared with MyD88+/+ mice (Fig. 1C). Histopathological analysis on day 35 revealed that all of the MyD88+/+ mice cleared the lung inflammation, whereas 50% of MyD88-/- mice that survived still had severe, chronic lung inflammation (Fig. 1B). Whereas the acute inflammation seen at day 5 in the lungs of MyD88+/+ mice showed massive polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) infiltration, the inflammation observed on day 14 in the lungs of MyD88-/- mice showed mostly lymphocytic cells and some plasma cell infiltration but lacked PMN infiltration (Fig. 1D). MyD88 Deficiency Impairs the Inflammatory Host Responses to C. pneumoniae Infection—To further investigate the role of MyD88 in inflammatory host responses against C. pneumoniae infection, we measured the body weight of MyD88-/- and MyD88+/+ mice before inoculation and 5 and 14 days after inoculation with C. pneumoniae. Infection resulted in a significant decrease of relative body weight in MyD88+/+ mice at day 5 after inoculation (p < 0.05) (compared with the body weight of mice prior to infection), but no reduction in relative body weight was observed in MyD88-/- mice at day 5 compared with the body weight of mice prior to infection (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the development of lung inflammation, MyD88+/+ mice demonstrated an increase in lung weight compared with MyD88-/- mice at day 5 (p < 0.05). However, at day 14, lung weight from MyD88+/+ mice returned to base line coinciding with a recovery from acute inflammation and edema, whereas MyD88-/- mice demonstrated an increased lung weight at day 14 consistent with development of severe lung inflammation (Fig. 2B). These findings are supported by a significantly increased number of inflammatory cells in the BAL of MyD88+/+ mice compared with MyD88-/- mice at day 5 (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2C). Whereas inflammatory cells of MyD88+/+ mice were decreased by day 14 compared with day 5, we could not observe any differences in inflammatory cells in the BAL between the two genotypes at day 14 (Fig. 2C). Next, we measured the concentrations of IFN-γ, IL-1β, and MIP-2 in serum, lung homogenates, and BAL from infected MyD88-/- or MyD88+/+ mice at days 5, 14, and 35 (Fig. 3). At day 5, IFN-γ, IL-1β, and MIP-2 concentrations in lung homogenates or BAL were significantly higher in infected MyD88+/+ mice compared with MyD88-/- mice, which were unable to mount an early inflammatory response (Fig. 3, A-C). Consistent with the observations with lung histopathology and bacterial burden, there was a dramatic reversal at day 14, when MyD88+/+ mice cleared the inflammation and pro-inflammatory cytokines returned to baseline, whereas MyD88-/- mice developed a significant increase in IFN-γ and IL-1β levels locally (lung homogenate and BAL) (Fig. 3, A and B). However, MIP-2 levels in lung homogenate and BAL samples of MyD88-/- mice remained low even at day 14, consistent with the lack of PMN infiltration in the lung inflammation observed at this day (Figs. 3C and 1D). At day 35, inflammatory cytokine levels in serum or lung homogenate were normal in control MyD88+/+ mice, whereas they remained elevated in MyD88-/- mice (Fig. 3B). These findings suggest that MyD88 deficiency impairs host innate immunity, delays bacterial clearance from the lungs, leading to a late and chronic lung inflammation, which lacks infiltration of PMNs. C. pneumoniae-infected MyD88-/- Mice Fail to Clear the Bacteria from Their Lungs at 14 Days, Which Leads to Increased Mortality—To investigate whether the delayed but severe and chronic inflammation in the lungs of MyD88-/- mice on days 14 and 35 was caused by delayed bacterial clearance and sustained high bacterial burden, we quantified C. pneumoniae IFU in the lungs of MyD88-/- and MyD88+/+ mice at day 5 and day 14. There were no differences in the bacterial count in infected lungs between MyD88-/- mice and MyD88+/+ mice on day 5 following inoculation (Fig. 4A). However, at day 14 there was a dramatic reduction in bacterial burden in the lungs of MyD88+/+ mice, whereas MyD88-/- mice failed to clear bacteria from their lungs (Fig. 4A). The bacterial burden in the lungs of MyD88-/- mice on day 14 was comparable to the bacterial count on day 5 after inoculation (Fig. 4A). In addition, we observed ∼45% mortality in C. pneumoniae-infected MyD88-/- mice (5 of 11 mice died) by day 35 whereas 100% of the infected MyD88+/+ mice survived the infection (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4B). To determine whether antibody production was altered in MyD88-/- mice when challenged with C. pneumoniae, total IgG levels were determined in sera collected at 14 and 35 days. MyD88-/- mice produced the same titers of total C. pneumoniae-specific IgG as compared with MyD88+/+ mice both at day 14 and day 35 (data not shown). MyD88-/- Mice Demonstrate Delayed Recruitment of CD8+ and CD4+ T Cells to Lung Tissues Infected with C. pneumoniae—To further understand the mechanism of the reversal of the inflammation in the lungs of MyD88-/- mice on day 5 (early) versus day 14 (late), we determined the cellular constitution of the inflammatory cells in the lung homogenates in MyD88+/+ and MyD88-/- mice following C. pneumoniae infection. The absolute number of lymphocytes reached maximal levels on day 5 in the lungs of MyD88+/+ mice, but their recruitment was delayed in the lungs of MyD88-/- mice, and they reached maximal levels only on day 14. Consistent with the reversal of the lung inflammation at day 5 versus 14, the absolute number of CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells increased at day 5 in the lungs of MyD88+/+ mice (but not MyD88-/- mice), and dramatic reversal occurred at day 14 when the number of lung CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells diminished in WT mice, while they now increased in MyD88-/- mice (Fig. 5B). MyD88-/- and TLR2-/- Macrophages Are Deficient in Cytokine Responses to Live C. pneumoniae Infection—To confirm the role of MyD88 in inflammatory host responses against C. pneumoniae infection in vitro, we isolated primary bone marrow-derived macrophage from MyD88+/+ and MyD88-/- mice and infected them with live C. pneumoniae at an MOI of 3 and measured MCP-1, IL-6, and IL-12p40 release. C. pneumoniae infection induced significant amount of MCP-1, IL-6, and IL-12p40 release in WT but not in MyD88-/- macrophages (Fig. 6A). However, macrophages isolated from wild-type and MyD88-deficient mice showed comparable ability in intracellular killing of C. pneumoniae in vitro (data not shown). To determine the upstream receptor involved in the recognition of C. pneumoniae, we isolated primary alveolar macrophages from TLR2-/-, TLR4-/-, and WT mice and infected them with live C. pneumoniae at an MOI of 3 for 24 h. While TLR4-/- and WT alveolar macrophages responded to live C. pneumoniae stimulation by releasing IL-6, the TLR2-/- macrophages were unresponsive, suggesting that at least in vitro TLR2 plays a role upstream of MyD88 in C. pneumoniae-induced cellular activation (Fig. 6B). TLR2 or TLR4 Deficiency Is Not Associated with Delayed Bacterial Clearance or Delayed Lung Inflammation in C. pneumoniae Infection—We next investigated whether TLR2-/- or TLR4-/- mice have a defect in bacterial clearance and host defense against C. pneumoniae infection. TLR2-/-, TLR4-/-, or WT mice were inoculated intranasally with C. pneumoniae as described above and sacrificed at days 5 and 14 postinoculation. Lungs were examined histopathologically and quantitative cultures were performed. In contrast to MyD88-/- mice, TLR2-/-, and TLR4-/- mice were able to mount an acute inflammatory response early at day 5 and cleared the lung inflammation by day 14, similar to WT mice (Fig. 6C). There were no differences in the inflammation scores in lungs of WT mice versus TLR2-/- or TLR4-/- mice at days 5 or 14 (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, in contrast to MyD88-/- mice, TLR2-/-, or TLR4-/- mice were able to clear the bacteria from their lungs as well as the WT mice by day 14 (Fig. 6C). There was no increased mortality in the TLR2-/- or TLR4-/- mice compared with WT mice throughout the 35 days after infection (data not shown). The major findings of these studies are that MyD88-deficient mice fail to mount an effective lung defense against intrapulmonary challenge with C. pneumoniae. Our data implicate a central role for MyD88-dependent signaling in innate immune defense against C. pneumoniae. We found that both TLR2-/- and TLR4-/- mice were able to mount a successful host defense. However, MyD88-deficient mice were unable to up-regulate pro-inflammatory cytokines, demonstrated delayed recruitment of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells to the lung, did not recruit PMNs, were unable to clear the pathogen from their lungs, and exhibited greater mortality compared with wild-type, TLR2-/-, or TLR4-/- mice. MyD88-/- and WT macrophages showed comparable ability to kill the C. pneumoniae in vitro. This finding is consistent with previous data showing that macrophage killing of Listeria was also found to be MyD88-independent (12Edelson B.T. Unanue E.R. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 3869-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Importantly, a delayed MyD88-independent inflammatory response involving locally increased expression of IL-1β and IFN-γ did eventually develop at day 14 after inoculation, but in many cases was insufficient to prevent death. Levels of C. pneumoniae-specific total IgG antibodies in MyD88-/- mice were not different from those in MyD88+/+ mice 14 and 35 days after intranasal inoculation, suggesting that MyD88-/- mice could mount an appropriate though ultimately ineffective adaptive immune response against C. pneumoniae. Collectively then, our findings implicate a critical role for MyD88-dependent signaling in mounting a rapid and effective innate immune response against pathogenic invasion by C. pneumoniae in this mouse model. These data are most consistent with the interpretation that the primary problem was an inability to produce proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines to recruit cell types to the site of infection that are known to be involved in eradication of C. pneumoniae, particularly cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. We also observed diminished PMN recruitment to the lungs of MyD88-deficient mice, an observation well described by many other studies (12Edelson B.T. Unanue E.R. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 3869-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 14Skerrett S.J. Liggitt H.D. Hajjar A.M. Wilson C.B. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 3377-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). TLR2 and TLR4 heavily rely upon MyD88 to trigger cytokine responses, but we found that both TLR2- and TLR4-deficient mice were able to mount an immune response that successfully and efficiently countered the infectious challenge. These findings raise the question of how the host detects the presence of C. pneumoniae. One possibility is that TLR2 and TLR4 play redundant roles, and thus it is possible that TLR2/TLR4 double knock-out mice may have defects in host defenses against C. pneumoniae similar to those we observed with MyD88-null mice. Another possibility is that neither TLR2 nor TLR4 are involved in the recognition of this organism. Alternatively, in addition to TLRs, IL-1βR, and IL-18R also utilize MyD88 for signaling, raising the possibility that our results in MyD88-/- mice might have been caused by attenuated signaling triggered by these receptors rather than by TLR-mediated signals. This possibility is consistent with a recent report that also suggested that signaling by TLR2 or TLR4 may not be necessary for clearance of C. pneumoniae infection in mice after a low grade infectious challenge (23Mueller M. Postius S. Thimm J.G. Gueinzius K. Muehldorfer I. Hermann C. Immunobiology. 2004; 209: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Our current data now support these findings in high grade infectious challenge model as well. Alternatively, MyD88-independent pathways such as the TRAM/TRIF pathway or pattern recognition receptors other than TLRs such as the intracytoplasmic nucleotide binding oligomerization domain (NOD) receptors may be important in some infections, or there may be significant redundancies in the response options available, such that these alternative signaling pathways may become activated in the absence of MyD88. Recently, an involvement of NOD1 signaling has been proposed for C. pneumoniae-induced NF-κB activation in vitro (24Opitz B. Puschel A. Schmeck B. Hocke A.C. Rosseau S. Hammerschmidt S. Schumann R.R. Suttorp N. Hippenstiel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36426-36432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). It is also possible that TLR2, TLR4, and other pattern recognition receptors may form a redundant system for detecting C. pneumoniae, but that the downstream adaptor MyD88 that is common to these receptors is absolutely required for an appropriate innate defense. Available evidence is therefore most consistent with the interpretation that MyD88 is required for an effective host response to C. pneumonia, but the identity of the upstream ligand(s) and the precise role of specific pattern recognition receptors must await the results of further investigation. Despite these uncertainties, based on a large body of evidence, current models of innate immune defenses postulate a central role for TLR-mediated processes in pathogen detection, initiation of a rapid innate immune defense, and regulation of subsequent adaptive immune responses (6Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6623) Google Scholar, 7Beutler B. Nature. 2004; 430: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar) and thus make it difficult to rule out involvement of TLRs in host defense against C. pneumoniae. We note that most TLRs can utilize MyD88 to trigger responses, and we therefore suggest that our results are most likely because of abrogated pathogen detection mechanisms by one or more TLRs that utilize MyD88. In any event, our results clearly support the general model of pathogen detection and initiation of host defenses, and specifically demonstrate the central importance of MyD88 in mediating host defense against C. pneumoniae. It appears that the inability of MyD88-/- mice to recruit appropriate immune effector cells to the lungs probably was a major contributor to the inability to clear pathogens from the lungs in MyD88-/- mice and reduced survival. Specifically, we found that MyD88-/- mice could neither produce inflammatory cytokines nor recruit CD8+ T cells to the lungs early in the course of the infection (i.e. within at least the first 5 days). However, later on (i.e. at 14 days), both inflammation and recruitment of CD8+ T cells were observed in the lungs of MyD88-/- mice. On the other hand, PMNs were not recruited either early or late in MyD88-/- mice, but were abundant in lungs of wild-type mice. Therefore, PMNs do not appear to be a significant contributor to the late chronic inflammation seen in MyD88-/- mice, but could be involved in rapid killing and clearance of pathogens from the lungs in the early phases of infection in WT mice. Rodriguez et al. (25Rodriguez N. Fend F. Jennen L. Schiemann M. Wantia N. Prazeres da Costa C.U. Durr S. Heinzmann U. Wagner H. Miethke T. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 4836-4844Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) recently reported that PMNs actually facilitate replication of C. pneumoniae in epithelial cells, which would imply that lack of PMNs in the lungs of MyD88-/- mice would lead to a reduced bacterial load. However, we found that MyD88-/- mice had a defect in bacterial clearance from the lungs and had the same amount of bacteria at day 14 compared with day 5. Thus, lack of PMNs did not result in any decrease in bacterial load in the lungs of MyD88-/- mice at later days in our study. Whereas Rodriguez et al. (25Rodriguez N. Fend F. Jennen L. Schiemann M. Wantia N. Prazeres da Costa C.U. Durr S. Heinzmann U. Wagner H. Miethke T. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 4836-4844Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) looked at early events at days 3 and 6 after infection our study addresses both early and late stages by investigating days 5, 14, and 35 after infection. We also found that MyD88-deficient mice have a delay in CD8+ T cell recruitment to the lung after infection. This finding directly implicates MyD88-dependent signaling in recruitment of CD8+ T cells to sites of infection. Because CD8+ T cells are known to be essential for resolution of C. pneumoniae infection (26Rottenberg M.E. Gigliotti Rothfuchs A.C. Gigliotti D. Svanholm C. Bandholtz L. Wigzell H. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2829-2836PubMed Google Scholar), our observation of delayed CD8+ T cell recruitment to the lungs may provide an explanation for the reversal of phenotype that we observed in MyD88-deficient mice on days 5 and 14. Whereas previous studies have demonstrated no defects in MyD88-deficient mice in the total number of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and in their ability to produce IFN-γ after nonspecific activation (27Schnare M. Barton G.M. Holt A.C. Takeda K. Akira S. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar), more recent studies have shown that MyD88-deficient mice have defects in their CD8+ T cell response to acute viral infections such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) (28Zhou S. Kurt-Jones E.A. Mandell L. Cerny A. Chan M. Golenbock D.T. Finberg R.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 822-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 29Honda K. Yanai H. Negishi H. Asagiri M. Sato M. Mizutani T. Shimada N. Ohba Y. Takaoka A. Yoshida N. Taniguchi T. Nature. 2005; 434: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar). Hence, our data are most consistent with the interpretation that the major reason MyD88-/- mice could not clear the pathogen from their lungs and developed a chronic inflammation was that an early localized proinflammatory response was lacking, PMNs were not recruited, and recruitment of CD8+ T cells into the infected lungs was delayed, that these factors conspired to allow the bacteria to flourish in the lungs of MyD88-/- mice, and that continued inability to clear the pathogen led to the delayed but intense lung inflammation and increased mortality. We conclude that MyD88 critically regulates host defense to infectious challenge with C. pneumonia in mice, that an effective, rapid innate immune response to clear the bacteria in this mouse model cannot be successfully mounted in the absence of MyD88, and that the result of MyD88 deficiency is chronic lung inflammation and higher mortality from an inability to effectively counteract C. pneumoniae infection.

Light isomerizes 11-cis- into all-trans-retinal, triggering a conformational transition of the opsin molecule that initiates phototransduction. After bleaching all-trans-retinal leaves the opsin, and light sensitivity must be restored by regeneration of 11-cis-retinal. Under bright light conditions the retinal G protein-coupled receptor (RGR) was reported to support this regeneration by acting as a photoisomerase in a proposed photic visual cycle. We analyzed the contribution of RGR to rhodopsin regeneration under different light regimes and show that regeneration, during light exposure and in darkness, is slowed about 3-fold in Rgr-/- mice. These findings are not in line with the proposed function of RGR as a photoisomerase. Instead, RGR, independent of light, accelerates the conversion of retinyl esters to 11-cis-retinal by positively modulating isomerohydrolase activity, a key step in the “classical” visual cycle.

Furthermore, we find that light accelerates rhodopsin regeneration, independent of RGR. Rhodopsin is the light-sensing molecule of rod photoreceptors. It comprises a protein component, opsin, and a vitamin A-derived chromophore 11-cis-retinal. Absorption of a photon by rhodopsin isomerizes the retinal from its 11-cis-isomer to its all-trans-retinal isomer, leading rapidly to a conformational change of the opsin molecule. In its activated form rhodopsin interacts with transducin thereby activating the phototransduction cascade that leads to closure of cGMP-activated channels in the plasma membrane. The resulting hyperpolarization leads to a reduction of synaptic glutamate release, completing the conversion of a light stimulus into a neurochemical signal (reviewed in Ref. 1Burns M.E. Baylor D.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 779-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar).Light-induced activity of rhodopsin is quickly terminated by phosphorylation and capping of its transducin interaction site. The chromophore, now in the all-trans form, is hydrolyzed and released. To become photosensitive again, the bleached opsin molecule requires the re-introduction of a new molecule of 11-cis-retinal. The source of 11-cis-retinal for rod photoreceptors is the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), 1The abbreviations used are: RPE, retinal pigment epithelium; sER, smooth endoplasmic reticulum; RDH5, 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase; REST, retinyl ester storage particle; sRPE65, soluble RPE65; CRALBP, cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein; WT, wild type; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ERG, electroretinogram recordings; mRPE65, membrane-bound RPE65.1The abbreviations used are: RPE, retinal pigment epithelium; sER, smooth endoplasmic reticulum; RDH5, 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase; REST, retinyl ester storage particle; sRPE65, soluble RPE65; CRALBP, cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein; WT, wild type; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ERG, electroretinogram recordings; mRPE65, membrane-bound RPE65. where 11-cis- retinal is regenerated from all-trans-retinoids. This “classical” visual cycle involves formation of all-trans-retinol in the photoreceptor, transport to the RPE, several steps of metabolic conversion, and transport of 11-cis-retinal back to the photoreceptor (reviewed in Refs. 2McBee J.K.

Redmond T.M. Genomics. 1994; 20: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)) is essential for this classical visual cycle: absence of RPE65 leads to undetectable levels of 11-cis-retinal (5Redmond T.M. Yu S. Lee E. Bok D. Hamasaki D. Chen N. Goletz P. Ma J.X. Crouch R.K. Pfeifer K. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) and dramatically reduced photoreceptor function (6Seeliger M.W. Grimm C. Stahlberg F. Friedburg C. Jaissle G. Zrenner E. Guo H. Reme C.E. Humphries P. Hofmann F. Biel M. Fariss R.N. Redmond T.M. Wenzel A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar).Recently, the existence of an additional pathway providing 11-cis-retinal under photic conditions was proposed, based on studies of mice deficient in the retinal G protein-coupled receptor (RGR, on mouse chromosome 14 (7Chen P. Hao W. Rife L. Wang X.P. Shen D. Chen J. Ogden T. Van Boemel G.B. Wu L. Yang M. Fong H.K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar)). In vitro, RGR binds all-trans-retinal and upon illumination converts it into 11-cis- retinal (8Hao W. Fong H.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6251-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 9Hao W.

Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 413-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As Rgr-/- mice have decreased steady-state levels of rhodopsin during light exposure, it was suggested that RGR-dependent generation of 11-cis-retinal represents an auxiliary “photic pathway” supporting the classical visual cycle in periods of high chromophore demand, e.g. during continuous light exposure (7Chen P. Hao W. Rife L. Wang X.P. Shen D. Chen J. Ogden T. Van Boemel G.B. Wu L. Yang M. Fong H.K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 11Pepperberg D.R. Crouch R.K.

Rev. 2002; 60: 62-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar).Several lines of evidence indicate that this proposed photic pathway and the classical visual cycle might not be independent. RGR forms a protein complex with components of the classical visual cycle, namely cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP), 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase (RDH5), and RPE65 (13Chen P. Lee T.D. Fong H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21098-21104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 51Bhattacharya S.K. Wu Z. Miyagi M. West K.A. Jin Z. Nawrot M. Saari J.C. Crabb J.W.

Additionally, RPE65 and RGR protein levels may influence each other (14Wu B.X. Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Rohrer B. Crouch R.K. Ma J.X. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 3857-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and most importantly the loss of RPE65 alone leads to complete 11-cis-retinal deficiency in mice (5Redmond T.M. Yu S. Lee E. Bok D. Hamasaki D. Chen N. Goletz P. Ma J.X. Crouch R.K. Pfeifer K. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar).However, the possible impact of RGR on the classical visual cycle is controversial. In Rgr-/- mice, no deficit regeneration of rhodopsin was detected in darkness, when only the classical visual cycle is functional (7Chen P. Hao W. Rife L. Wang X.P. Shen D. Chen J. Ogden T. Van Boemel G.B. Wu L. Yang M. Fong H.K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). A more recent study of Rgr-/- mice reported slowed rhodopsin regeneration after a moderate bleach, but accelerated regeneration after a strong bleach (15Maeda T. Van Hooser J.P. Driessen C.A. Filipek S. Janssen J.J. Palczewski K. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 944-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).We show here that the protein levels of RPE65 and RGR in mice are closely correlated with each other in different genetic backgrounds: a variant of Rpe65 (Leu450 > Met450) that exhibits a slowing of the classical visual cycle and leads to a decreased level of RPE65 protein (16Wenzel A. Reme C.E. Williams T.P. Hafezi F. Grimm C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 53-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Nusinowitz S. Nguyen L.T. Farber D.B. Danciger M. Exp.

Biochemistry. 2005; (10.1021/bi0505363)PubMed Google Scholar) also leads to reduced levels of RGR. To avoid the influence of different RPE65 variants, we bred Rgr-/- and WT mice to homogeneity for the Met450 variant of Rpe65. In this genetic background we have quantified the effect of RGR on rhodopsin regeneration, both in continuous light and in darkness following different bleaching regimes. We find that RGR accelerates rhodopsin regeneration, independently of light, by inducing a positive multiplicative effect on the isomerohydrolase activity. In addition, we demonstrate that continuous illumination indeed accelerates rhodopsin regeneration, regardless of the presence of RGR. Together, we provide in vivo evidence that RGR is actually a factor enhancing the classical visual cycle, rather than a component of an independent photic visual cycle.MATERIALS AND METHODSMice—WT and Rgr-/- mice (7Chen P. Hao W. Rife L. Wang X.P. Shen D. Chen J. Ogden T. Van Boemel G.B. Wu L. Yang M. Fong H.K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) were screened for variations at codon 450 of Rpe65 and bred to homozygosity for Rpe65-Met450. Rpe65+/- mice were derived from Rpe65+/+ and Rpe65-/- mice (5Redmond T.M. Yu S. Lee E. Bok D. Hamasaki D. Chen N. Goletz P. Ma J.X. Crouch R.K. Pfeifer K. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) in F1 and carried Met at position 450 of the remaining allele. Genotyping for codon 450 of Rpe65 was performed as described recently (22Grimm C. Wenzel A. Stanescu D. Samardzija M. Hotop S. Groszer M. Naash M. Gassmann M. Reme C. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5651-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).BALB/c, C57BL/6, and 129/Ola wild-type mice were obtained from Harlan (Netherlands and United Kingdom) and Janvier (France). B6/129S hybrids were from Jackson Labs (Bar Harbor, ME). All mice were reared in cyclic light (12:12 h, 60 lux, lights on 6:00 a.m.). Experiments were performed with mice aged 6-10 weeks. Animal experiments were performed in accordance with the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and according to the guidelines of the local veterinary authorities.Western Blotting—Eyes of dark-adapted mice were prepared as follows: the eye was enucleated, attached tissue was thoroughly removed, and lens and vitreous were removed through a slit in the cornea. The remaining eyecup (containing the retina) was homogenized in Tris buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.0) using an ultrasound tip, the homogenate was centrifuged for 1 min at 1000 × g, the clear supernatant was analyzed for its protein content (Bradford Assay, Bio-Rad), mixed with SDS sample buffer, and heated for 10 min at 70 °C.Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and detected with the following antibodies: RGR, pin3, polyclonal rabbit affinity purified; RPE65, pin5, polyclonal rabbit affinity purified; CRALBP, UW55, polyclonal rabbit, gift from J.

Immunoreactivity was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and the Western Lightning System (PerkinElmer Life Sciences Inc.). Pin3 and pin5 are newly generated antisera, raised against RPE65 amino acids NH2-CNFITKINPETLETIK and RGR amino acids NH2-CLSPQKSKKDRTQ. Specificity was confirmed on extracts and tissue sections from WT, Rgr-/-, and Rpe65-/- mice, respectively (not shown).Quantification of RPE65 and RGR on Western Blots—Eyecup proteins (20 μg) from 5 animals of each genotype (WT, Rgr-/-, and Rpe65+/-) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose. RPE65 was detected with anti-RPE65 (pin5) and RGR with anti-RGR (pin3). Immunoreactivity was visualized using anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to IR dye 800 (Rockland Immunochemicals) and quantified using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biotechnology). Interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein immunoreactivity, detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (gift from B. Wiggert (NEI, National Institutes of Health (27Wiggert B. Lee L. Rodrigues M. Hess H. Redmond T.M. Chader G.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1986; 27: 1041-1049PubMed Google Scholar)), served as internal standard. Fluorescence readings for RPE65 and RGR were normalized to interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein values, and the average normalized RPE65 or RGR value from WT was set to 1. The comparison of RPE65 levels in the three genotypes was tested by a one-way analysis of variance. The comparison of RGR levels in WT and Rpe65+/- mice was tested using a two-tailed t test.Rhodopsin Steady State Levels—Mice were dark adapted overnight. 45-60 min prior to light exposure, pupils were dilated (Cyclogyl 1%; Alcon, Cham, Switzerland; and phenylephrine 5%, Ciba Vision, Niederwangen, Switzerland) under dim red light (≥650 nm). Mice were placed in cages with reflective interior and exposed to 100 lux of fluorescent white light (TLD-36 W/965 tubes; Philips, Hamburg, Germany; UV-impermeable diffuser) for different times. For determination of rhodopsin content, mice were transferred into dim red light, sacrificed, and retinas of both eyes were prepared through a slit in the cornea and placed in 1 ml of distilled H2O for 1 min. After 3 min of centrifugation at 15,000 × g, the supernatant was discarded and 700 μl of 1% hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (Fluka Chemie, Buchs, Switzerland) in H2O was added to the pellet. Retinas were mechanically homogenized with a Polytron (20 s, 3,000 rpm), centrifuged for 3 min at 15,000 × g, and the supernatant was collected. The absorption at 500 nm was measured before and after exposure to bright white light (20,000 lux for 1 min). The amount of rhodopsin present per retina was calculated using the following formula derived from the Lambert-Beer equation: rho = vol × c = vol ×Δabs500/(ϵ500 × l × n). rho is the amount of rhodopsin per retina (in moles); vol, the volume of sample (in liters); c, the concentration of rhodopsin per retina (in mol/liters); Δabs500 is the difference between absorption before and after bleaching measured at 500 nm; ϵ500 is the extinction coefficient of rhodopsin at 500 nm (4.2 × 104 cm × molar); l is the path length of the cuvette (in cm); and n is the number of retinas.Rhodopsin Regeneration in Darkness—Mice were dark adapted overnight, pupils dilated, and mice were exposed to white light with an intensity of 5,000 lux for 10 min or 30,000 lux for 10 s. After light exposure, mice were placed in darkness for the times indicated in the figures, and rhodopsin was measured as described above.HPLC Profiling for Visual Cycle Intermediates—For each condition we analyzed the retinoid composition of three different mice (one eye each). For retinoid extraction and HPLC analyses all steps were carried out under dim red light. Retinoids were extracted from eyecups including retina and RPE. The tissue was transferred into 200 μl of 2 m NH2OH (pH 6.8) and 200 μl of methanol and was homogenized by sonification (5 bursts for 5 s, 20% of maximum power, Sonoplus, Bandelin, Berlin, Germany). Retinoids were extracted from the homogenate as described previously (28Lampert J.M. Holzschuh J. Hessel S. Driever W. Vogt K. von Lintig J. Development. 2003; 130: 2173-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). HPLC analyses were performed on a Hypersil 3-μm column (Knauer, Germany) on a System Gold (Beckman) equipped with a multidiode array (model 166, Beckman) and Karat software. The individual retinoids were each determined by their retention times and spectral characteristics as compared with authentic standards. For quantification of the molar amounts, peak integrals were scaled with defined amounts of reference substances. The reference substances all-trans-retinyl palmitate, and all-trans-, 13-cis-, and 9-cis-retinal were purchased from Sigma. 11-cis-Retinal was isolated from dark-adapted bovine eyes. The corresponding retinols and oximes were obtained by the reduction of the retinals with NaBH4 or their reaction with NH2OH. The proportion of a retinal isomer was determined by the total peak areas of both its syn- and anti-retinal oxime. For example, to calculate the amount of 11-cis-retinal from the HPLC profile shown in Fig. S3, the peak areas of syn-11-cis retinaloxime (peak 2) and anti-11-cis retinaloxime (peak 8) were scaled according to the corresponding areas of the peaks in the 11-cis-retinal reference, and the resulting amounts were summed to provide the total amount of 11-cis- retinal (in pmol) in the tissue.Electroretinogram Recordings (ERG)—ERGs were obtained as described previously (6Seeliger M.W. Grimm C. Stahlberg F. Friedburg C. Jaissle G. Zrenner E. Guo H. Reme C.E. Humphries P. Hofmann F. Biel M. Fariss R.N. Redmond T.M. Wenzel A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were dark-adapted overnight prior to the experiments and their pupils dilated. Anesthesia was induced by subcutaneous injection of ketamine (66.7 mg/kg), xylazine (11.7 mg/kg), and atropine (1 mg/kg). Silver needle electrodes served as reference (forehead) and ground (tail), and gold wire ring electrodes as active electrodes. The ERG equipment consisted of a ganzfeld bowl, an amplifier (0,1 to 3,000 Hz), and a PC-based control and recording unit (Toennies Multiliner Vision, Jaeger/Toennies, Höchberg, Germany). Responses to trains of flashes (flicker) were obtained for a fixed frequency (6 Hz) with a range of intensities (0.00012 to 19 cd s/m2 in steps of 0.2 logarithmic units). For ERG recordings following light exposure, mice were exposed to 5,000 lux of white light for 10 min and transferred into darkness for 2 or 4 h. During bleaching and recovery in the dark the mice were not anesthetized. Anesthesia was induced directly before the ERG was recorded. Therefore, anesthesia only interfered with regeneration for the final 5-10 min of the 2- or 4-h period.RESULTSThree genotypes of mice were used to study the role of RGR, and these are designated throughout as WT, Rgr-/-, and Rpe65+/-. These abbreviations represent the following genotypes: wild type (“WT” = Rgr+/+/Rpe65+/+), Rgr deficient (“Rgr-/-” = Rgr-/-/Rpe65+/+), and Rpe65 heterozygous (“Rpe65+/-” = Rgr+/+/Rpe65+/-).RGR and RPE65 Protein Levels Correlate in Different Strains of Mice—We measured RPE65 and RGR protein levels both in the transgenic mice and also in several strains of wild type mice. BALB/c and 129/Ola mice express the RPE65 variant carrying Leu at position 450. B6/129S hybrids and C57BL/6 have a Met at this position (16Wenzel A. Reme C.E. Williams T.P. Hafezi F. Grimm C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 53-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Danciger M. Matthes M.T. Yasamura D. Akhmedov N.B. Rickabaugh T. Gentleman S. Redmond T.M. La Vail M.M. Farber D.B. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This difference causes a reduction of RPE65 protein levels in the latter two strains (Fig. 1A and see Refs. 14Wu B.X. Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Rohrer B. Crouch R.K. Ma J.X. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 3857-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 16Wenzel A. Reme C.E. Williams T.P. Hafezi F. Grimm C.

Biochemistry. 2005; (10.1021/bi0505363)PubMed Google Scholar). These varying RPE65 protein levels among strains with the Leu450 variant of Rpe65 and those with the Met450 variant were matched by differences in RGR protein levels (Fig. 1A and Ref. 14Wu B.X. Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Rohrer B. Crouch R.K. Ma J.X. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 3857-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The interdependence of the RPE65 and RGR protein levels was further verified in F1 mice of BALB/c and C57BL/6, which showed intermediate levels of these proteins (Fig. 1B). In contrast, CRALBP expression was not affected by the Rpe65 genotype (Fig. 1B). Mice with RPE65-Met450 or RPE65-Leu450 differ not only in their kinetics of rhodopsin regeneration in darkness (16Wenzel A. Reme C.E. Williams T.P. Hafezi F. Grimm C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 53-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Wenzel A. Grimm C. Samardzija M. Reme C.E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Biochemistry. 2005; (10.1021/bi0505363)PubMed Google Scholar), but also, as we show here, in their steady state levels of rhodopsin in the light supplemental materials (Fig. S1).Lack of RGR Causes a Reduction in RPE65 Protein Levels—Generation of the Rgr-/- transgenic animals (7Chen P. Hao W. Rife L. Wang X.P. Shen D. Chen J. Ogden T. Van Boemel G.B. Wu L. Yang M. Fong H.K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) involved blastocyst injection of transgenic CJ7 or R1 embryonic stem cells and the resulting chimeric animals were bred with C57BL/6J mice. CJ7 and R1 cells are derived from 129/Sv mouse lines (29Fedorov L.M. Haegel-Kronenberger H. Hirchenhain J. Transgenic Res. 1997; 6: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The Met450 variant of Rpe65 has so far only been identified in C57BL/6J mice or hybrid lines derived from this background. Other mouse strains (including 129/Sv (30Danciger M. Lyon J. Worrill D. Hoffman S. Lem J. Reme C.E. Wenzel A. Grimm C. Mamm. Genome. 2004; 15: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)) have the Rpe65 variant with the Leu450 genotype (16Wenzel A. Reme C.E. Williams T.P. Hafezi F. Grimm C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 53-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Danciger M. Matthes M.T. Yasamura D. Akhmedov N.B. Rickabaugh T. Gentleman S. Redmond T.M. La Vail M.M.

Sci. 2003; 44: 2798-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, mice derived from chimeras of 129/Sv (CJ7 or R1 embryonic stem cells) and C57BL/6J may contain both Rpe65 variants. In fact, the WT and Rgr-/- mice (7Chen P. Hao W. Rife L. Wang X.P. Shen D. Chen J. Ogden T. Van Boemel G.B. Wu L. Yang M. Fong H.K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) we originally obtained were mixed with regard to the Leu450 or Met450 variant of Rpe65 (not shown).For all the experiments described here, we used WT, Rgr-/-, and Rpe65+/- mice expressing only the Met450 variant. The Rpe65+/- mice represent a control, as the expression level of RPE65 in these animals appeared to be closely matched to that in Rgr-/- animals, as described next.Reports on the effect of RGR deletion on the amount of RPE65 are contradictory: RPE65 may be unaffected (15Maeda T. Van Hooser J.P. Driessen C.A. Filipek S. Janssen J.J. Palczewski K. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 944-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) or reduced (14Wu B.X. Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Rohrer B. Crouch R.K. Ma J.X. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 3857-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared RPE65 levels in Rgr-/- and WT mice homozygous for the Met450 variant of Rpe65 by Western blotting (Fig. 2A). Average RPE65 protein levels were reduced by 57% in Rgr-/- mice (n = 5, p ≤ 0.001, one-way analysis of variance, supplemental materials Fig. S2).Fig. 2Western blot analysis of RGR, RPE65, CRALBP, and RDH5 in WT, Rgr-/- and Rpe65+/- mice. A, results from two animals of each genotype (WT or Rgr-/-) are shown. Lack of RGR (upper left) resulted in reduced amounts of RPE65 immunoreactivity (upper right) but had virtually no influence on the protein levels of CRALBP (lower left) and RDH5 (lower right). Equal amounts of protein from eyecup preparations were subjected to SDS-PAGE. B, comparison of RPE65 immunoreactivity in 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 μg of protein of eyecup preparations from Rgr-/- (right) and Rpe65+/- mice (left).

We furthermore, compared RPE65 immunoreactivity in the eyes of Rgr-/- and Rpe65+/- mice in different amounts of total protein (Fig. 2B) and quantified RPE65 immunoreactivity using the Odyssey infrared imaging system. According to our comparison, Rgr-/- and Rpe65+/- mice on average express the same amount of RPE65, which is 43 ± 10 and 46 ± 8% of wild type RPE65 levels, respectively (Fig. S2). Thus, our results are in line with previously published data: RPE65 immunoreactivity in Rpe65+/- mice was reported to be “roughly half” that seen in WT (31Redmond T.M. Hamel C.P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 705-724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to be reduced by 50% in Rgr-/- mice (14Wu B.X. Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Rohrer B. Crouch R.K. Ma J.X. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 3857-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Consequently, the effect of RGR ablation can be analyzed in Rpe65+/- and Rgr-/- mice without the confounding factor of different RPE65 expression levels.Regeneration of Rhodopsin in Darkness: Role of RGR in the Classical Visual Cycle—Mice with different levels of RPE65 protein because of the expression of either the Met450 or Leu450 variant of Rpe65 show different regeneration kinetics for rhodopsin in darkness following a strong bleach (16Wenzel A.

Therefore, we assumed that reduced levels of RPE65 in Rgr-/- mice should slow rhodopsin regeneration in darkness as compared with WT mice. To compensate for different expression levels of RPE65 and to analyze the pure effect of RGR deficiency, we also employed Rpe65+/- mice. These mice on average express wild type RGR levels (Fig. S2, mean = 80 ± 19%, no significant difference, n = 5, p > 0.3, two-tailed t test) and the same RPE65 levels as Rgr-/- mice (Figs. 2B and su"
https://openalex.org/W2031801904,"The genomes of Bacillus cereus and its closest relative Bacillus anthracis contain 10 polysaccharide deacetylase homologues. Six of these homologues have been proposed to be peptidoglycan N-acetylglucosamine deacetylases. Two of these genes, namely bc1960 and bc3618, have been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant enzymes have been purified to homogeneity and further characterized. Both enzymes were effective in deacetylating cell wall peptidoglycan from the Gram(+) Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis and the Gram(–) Helicobacter pylori as well as soluble chitin substrates and N-acetylchitooligomers. However, the enzymes were not active on acetylated xylan. These results provide insight into the substrate specificity of carbohydrate esterase family 4 enzymes.

This is the first biochemical study of bacterial peptidoglycan N-acetylglucosamine deacetylases. Polysaccharide deacetylases belong to carbohydrate esterase family 4 (CE4), 1The abbreviations used are: CE4, carbohydrate esterase family 4; GMDP, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine-(β-1,4)-N-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine-d-isoglutamine; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; TOF, time of flight; PSD, post source decay; MurNAc, N-acetylmuramic acid; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. which includes chitin deacetylases, acetylxylan esterases, xylanases, rhizobial NodB chitooligosaccharide deacetylases, and peptidoglycan deacetylases (1Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. Davies G. Henrissat B. Svensson B. Carbohydrate-active Enzymes: An Integrated Database Approach. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1999: 3-12Google Scholar). All these enzymes share a universal conserved region called polysaccharide deacetylase domain (according to the Henrissat classification). All five members of this family catalyze the hydrolysis of either N-linked acetyl group from N-acetylglucosamine residues (chitin deacetylase, NodB, and peptidoglycan N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase), or O-linked acetyl groups from O-acetylxylose residues (acetylxylan esterase, xylanase) (2Caufrier F.

A large number of open reading frames encoding for putative polysaccharide deacetylases have been identified in genomes of Gram-positive bacteria. It has been suggested that they correspond to peptidoglycan deacetylases, although this has been verified only in two cases. Two genes namely (pgdA) from Streptococcus pneumoniae and (pdaA) from Bacillus subtilis have been identified encoding for peptidoglycan N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase (5Volmer W. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20496-20501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and an enzyme required for the production of muramic δ-lactam in the spore cortex of B. subtilis, respectively (6Fukushima T.

Nature. 2003; 423: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) genomes revealed in each a multiplicity (10 open reading frames) of putative polysaccharide deacetylases. Six of these genes have been proposed to encode for putative peptidoglycan deacetylases in B. cereus and have almost identical amino acid sequence with the corresponding ones from B. anthracis implying similar functional roles of these proteins in the two bacteria. Given the laboratory safety precautions necessary for working with highly infectious agents and the recent concerns and proscriptions related to B. anthracis as a potential bioweapon (class A agent, Center for Disease Control) the B. cereus enzymes offer themselves as suitable models for studying the corresponding proteins of B. anthracis. The objective of this study is to shed light on the role of bacterial GlcNAc polysaccharide deacetylases and, furthermore, based on the extensive homologies, to contribute to our understanding of the physiology of B. anthracis, an interesting pathogenic microbe and close relative of B. cereus. This report describes the cloning and expression of two genes encoding for peptidoglycan GlcNAc deacetylases from B. cereus ATCC 14579 as well as the characterization of the purified recombinant enzymes. Materials and Methods—Primers were synthesized by the Microchemistry Facility of the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology. The expression plasmid pET-26b(+) and Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS were from Novagen. cDNA clones from B. cereus ATCC14579 were from Integrated Genomics Inc. (Chicago, IL). All chromatographic materials were from Amersham Biosciences. Ni-NTA-agarose, PCR, gel extraction, and plasmid purification kits were from Qiagen. Enzymes and reagents for acetate determination were purchased from Roche Diagnostics. Substrates and common biochemicals were purchased from Sigma. Restriction enzymes as well as all DNA-modifying enzymes were from MINOTECH Biotechnology. Cloning and Expression of the bc1960 and bc3618 Genes of B. cereus into pET Expression Vectors—The genes were amplified from cDNA clones using DNA polymerase chain reaction. An NdeI and a XhoI site was incorporated at the start and the end of each gene to produce an in-frame C-terminal His6 tag-fused construct in pET-26b(+) vector. The amplified genes were purified, digested with the corresponding enzymes, and ligated into pET-26 vectors placing the polysaccharide deacetylase genes under the transcriptional control of the T7lac promoter. The resulting plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS, the transformants were screened for the gene of interest, and the inserts were sequenced at the automatic sequencing facility of the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology. The transformed strains containing each of the cloned genes were stored at –80 °C in 20% glycerol until further use. 20 ml of a saturated culture of each of the transformed polysaccharide deacetylases expression strains was inoculated into 500 ml of LB medium containing suitable antibiotics and incubated at 30 °C on a rotary shaker to an A600 of 0.6. The cultures were transferred to 25 °C, isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm and the cells were further incubated for 16 h. Purification of BC1960 and BC3618 —Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole (buffer A). After sonication, the soluble fraction was collected by centrifugation and loaded onto Ni-NTA-agarose, equilibrated with buffer A. Proteins were eluted using a step gradient of imidazole (250 mm). Active fractions were pooled, concentrated (3 ml), and subsequently applied onto a Sephacryl S200 HR column previously equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl. Fractions containing enzyme activity were pooled and concentrated (1 mg/ml). Preparation of Radiolabeled Substrates—Preparation of cell wall peptidoglycan from vegetative B. cereus and B. subtilis was performed according to a previously described protocol (11Atrih A. Bacher G. Allmaier G. Williamson M.P. Foster S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3956-3996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Labeling of glycol chitin and peptidoglycan was performed using [3H]acetic anhydride according to Araki and Ito (12Araki Y. Oba S. Araki S. Ito E. J. Biochem. 1980; 88: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Enzyme Assays—Standard enzyme assays were performed in a mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (for BC3618), or 20 mm Mes-NaOH, pH 6.0 (for BC1960), 1 mm CoCl2, and 5 μl of the substrate (1 mg/ml). Incubation time was 30 min at 50 °C (for BC1960) or 37 °C (for BC3618). We have employed two different assays for determining polysaccharide deacetylase activity. (i) In a radiometric assay, deacetylase activity was estimated using as substrate partially O-hydroxyethylated chitin (glycol chitin) and peptidoglycan radiolabeled in N-acetyl groups (12Araki Y. Oba S. Araki S. Ito E. J. Biochem. 1980; 88: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). (ii) In a coupled assay, acetate released by the action of polysaccharide deacetylases on various polysaccharides and N-acetylchitooligosaccharides (GlcNAc1–6) was determined by the enzymatic method of Bergmeyer via three coupled enzyme reactions (13Bergmeyer H.U. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 2nd. 1. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim/Academic Press, Inc., New York and London1974: 112-117Google Scholar). Kinetic properties of BC1960 and BC3618 toward N-acetylchitooligosaccharides were determined as below. The reactions were performed with various concentrations of GlcNAc2–6 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (for BC3618), or 20 mm Mes-NaOH, pH 6.0 (for BC1960), 1 mm CoCl2 at 50 °C (for BC1960) or 37 °C (for BC3618) for 10 min. Reactions were terminated by heating the mixture at 100 °C for 5 min. Acetic acid released was determined by using an acetic acid determination kit (Roche Diagnostics) (13Bergmeyer H.U. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 2nd. 1. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim/Academic Press, Inc., New York and London1974: 112-117Google Scholar). Analysis of Reaction Products—A commercially available muropeptide GMDP (40 μg/ml) was treated either with BC1960 or BC3618. Reaction products were separated by HPLC, desalted, and further analyzed by MALDI-TOF and MALDI-PSD as previously described (14Antignac A. Rousselle J.-C. Namane A. Labigne A. Taha M.K. Boneca I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31521-31528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Purified peptidoglycan (200 μg) of Helicobacter pylori, was incubated with BC1960 or BC3618 for 18 h at 50 °C and 37 °C, respectively. Samples were boiled for 10 min, and insoluble peptidoglycan was recovered by centrifugation and washed once with water. The resulting pellet was further digested with mutanolysin (500 μg/ml) in 12.5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.8, for 18 h at 37 °C with stirring. Samples were boiled for 5 min, the supernatants were reduced with sodium borohydride, and muropeptides were analyzed by HPLC as previously described (15Glauner B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Individual peaks were also purified and analyzed by MALDI-TOF and MALDI-PSD as previously described (14Antignac A. Rousselle J.-C. Namane A. Labigne A. Taha M.K. Boneca I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31521-31528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Preparation and reversed phase-HPLC analysis of soluble and reduced muropeptides from B. subtilis peptidoglycan was carried out as previously reported (11Atrih A. Bacher G. Allmaier G. Williamson M.P. Foster S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3956-3996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reduced muropeptides were separated using a Waters HPLC system on a Hypersil octadecylsilane column (4.6 × 250 mm; particle size, 5 mm). Elution buffers were as follows: buffer A, 40 mm sodium phosphate, pH 4.5; buffer B, 40 mm sodium phosphate, pH 4.0, containing 20% (v/v) methanol. A small amount of sodium azide (142 μl from a 1% (w/v) solution) was added to 1 liter of buffer A to equalize its A202 with that of buffer B. The column was equilibrated at 52 °C with buffer A at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min for 20 min. Soluble reduced muropeptides (60 μl) were injected, and a linear gradient of 0 to 100% buffer B over a period of 270 min was started 5 min after sample injection. The flow rate was constant at 0.5 ml/min over the course of the gradient, and the eluted compounds were detected by monitoring A202. GlcNAc2–4 (2–4 mg) were incubated with 0.5 mg of each enzyme in 0.5 ml of buffer (25 mm Mes-NaOH buffer, pH 6.0, for BC1960 and 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, for BC3618) at 37 °C for between 18 to 48 h. The reaction was stopped by heating to 100 °C for 3 min and cooled, and the pH was adjusted to 4.5 by HCl before lyophilization. The samples were dissolved in 0.7 ml of D2O, the pD was adjusted to 4 using DCl, and the proton NMR spectra were obtained as previously described (16Sørbotten A. Horn S.J. Eijsink V.G.H. Vårum K.M. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 538-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—Homogeneous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing and reducing conditions was performed according to Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). Protein bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R. Comparison with Other Polysaccharide Deacetylases—The deduced sequences of bc1960 (NP_831730) and bc3618 (NP_833348) consist of 275 and 213 amino acids, respectively. BC1960 and BC3618 exhibit the highest identity to the peptidoglycan N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase from S. pneumoniae (38 and 36% identity, respectively). Residues conserved in all members of CE4 family enzymes were also identified in the B. cereus deacetylases (Fig. 1). Comparison with B. anthracis—Fig. 2 lists the 10 open reading frames of B. cereus alongside the orthologous members of B. anthracis. These pairings represent the best sequence alignments determined by CLUSTAL analysis of the individual proteins for each organism. Ten open reading frames found in B. anthracis were identical in size, and most of them were within 90% identical to the corresponding ones from B. cereus. The assignment of putative enzymatic activities used here was obtained from the annotated ERGO-light data base (see the legend for Fig. 2) (10Ivanova N. Sorokin A. Anderson I. Galleron N. Candelon B. Kapatral V. Bhattacharyya A. Reznik G. Mikhailova N. Lapidus A. Chu L. Mazur M. Goltsman E. Larsen N. D'Souza M. Walunas T. Grechkin Y. Pusch G. Haselkorn R. Fonstein M. Ehrlich S.D. Overbeek R. Kyrpides N. Nature. 2003; 423: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Enzyme Purification and Characterization—In addition to bc1960 and bc3618 genes we have also expressed the remaining four putative GlcNAc deacetylase genes. However, we were unable to demonstrate enzymatic activity of these gene products toward various chitin and peptidoglycan substrates tested. Both polysaccharide deacetylases were produced containing a C-terminal His6 tag and isolated from the soluble fraction of the cell extract. Purification was achieved in one step using an Ni-NTA affinity chromatography with an overall yield 5 mg of protein per liter of E. coli culture. The recombinant enzymes were purified to homogeneity and appear to be monomers as judged by SDS-PAGE and gel filtration chromatography. BC3618 and BC1960 exhibit molecular masses of ∼28 and ∼30 kDa, respectively, in agreement with the masses (27,711 Da for BC3618 and 30,570 Da for BC1960) estimated from the nucleotide sequences (Fig. 3). Both enzymes were active on radiolabeled glycol chitin and peptidoglycan from B. cereus vegetative cell walls but not on xylan. Chitin deacetylase from Mucor rouxii was not effective in deacetylating cell wall peptidoglycan from B. cereus (data not shown). Both enzymes were inhibited by the presence of 1 mm Cu2+ and Zn2+ tested as chlorides, whereas they were not inhibited by other divalent or monovalent metals (Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, K+, and Na+) tested up to 50 mm concentration. A maximum 10% increase in activity of both enzymes was observed by the addition of 1 mm CoCl2 in the assay buffer. Both enzymes were not inhibited by acetate even at concentrations up to 50 mm. The purified recombinant enzymes exhibited different pH, temperature optima, and thermal stability, as determined by using both radiolabeled glycol chitin and peptidoglycan as substrates. BC1960 exhibits a pH optimum at pH 6.0 and a remarkable thermal stability, because it retains 95% of its activity after preincubation at 50 °C for 24 h. On the other hand, BC3618 exhibits a pH optimum at pH 8.0 and is inactivated after incubation at 50 °C for 1 h. Optimum temperature for enzyme activity was determined to be 50 °C and 37 °C for BC1960 and BC3618, respectively (data not shown). The specificity of the enzymes for various N-acetylchitooligomers was examined, and the kinetic parameters were also calculated (Table I). Both enzymes did not deacetylate N-acetylglucosamine and required at least two sugar residues for catalysis. Kinetic parameters for GlcNAc2–6 were obtained from Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis, and the enzyme reaction rates for these substrates seemed to follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Both enzymes exhibited the highest Vmax value toward GlcNAc4 and the lowest Km for GlcNAc6 among these substrates. The resulting kcat/Km ratios indicated that GlcNAc4 was the favorable substrate for both enzymes. BC3618 exhibited higher kcat/Km values compared with BC1960 toward GlcNAc3–6 substrates, whereas BC1960 exhibited higher kcat/Km toward GlcNAc2.Table ISubstrate specificity and kinetic properties of BC1960 and BC3618 toward GlcNAc2–6SubstrateBC1960BC3618Relative activityaThe concentration of substrates was adjusted with respect to their content in N-acetyl residues.KmVmaxkcatbThe kcat values were derived from the expression Vmax/molecular mass of the protein./KmRelative activityKmVmaxkcatbThe kcat values were derived from the expression Vmax/molecular mass of the protein./Km%mmμmol/min/mgmm-1 s-1%mmμmol/min/mgmm-1 s-1GlcNAc00GlcNAc249.34.124.334.83.98.70.7GlcNAc369.22.4630.66.329.82.25010.4GlcNAc41001.1847.3241001.597.329.9GlcNAc586.40.3715.521.344.60.524.222.3GlcNAc6870.313.422.648.10.452525.6a The concentration of substrates was adjusted with respect to their content in N-acetyl residues.b The kcat values were derived from the expression Vmax/molecular mass of the protein. Open table in a new tab Enzymatic Deacetylation of GMDP—The synthetic muropeptide GMDP was incubated with both deacetylases. Both enzymes converted GMDP in two new muropeptides (peaks 1 and 2, Fig. 4A). The new species were purified, desalted, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF. The two muropeptides had exactly the same molecular mass (m/z 678.2749 and 678.3139) and differed from GMDP (m/z 720.2915) by m/z 42, which corresponds to the loss of an acetyl group. Further, we performed MALDI-PSD on peaks 1 and 2 to determine which moiety of GMDP was modified by both deacetylases (Fig. 4B and data not shown). Interestingly PSD analysis of peaks 1 and 2 revealed that only the N-acetylglucosamine residue had lost the N-linked acetyl functional group and that no modification of the N-acetylmuramic acid residue had occurred. Indeed, a major fragment (m/z 517.4) corresponds to the loss of glucosamine (m/z 161). Fragmentation from the C-terminal end of the deacetylated GMDP generates a and b type ions. For example, a1-NH3 ion m/z 504.2 is further converted into m/z 343.2 corresponding to the loss of m/z 161, therefore, a glucosamine residue. Finally, the presence of the ion m/z 318.2, which corresponds to the N-acetylmuramic acid alone, clearly excludes deacetylation of the N-acetylmuramic acid residue. Furthermore, no fragments corresponding to the loss of N-acetylglucosamine were observed (loss of m/z 203). The same fragmentation patterns were observed for peak 2 (data not shown) excluding a minor deacetylation of GMDP at the N-acetylmuramic acid residue. These results also imply that, despite the conversion of GMDP into two mew muropeptide peaks with different elution properties, the two species are structurally identical. This behavior might be due to different protonation states of the deacetylated GMDP in the elution buffers. Enzymatic Deacetylation of H. pylori and B. subtilis Peptidoglycans by BC1960 and BC3618 —To further examine the substrate specificity of BC1960 and BC3618, we incubated insoluble peptidoglycan from H. pylori with each enzyme followed by mutanolysin digestion and analyzed the resulting muropeptides by reversed phase-HPLC. Muropeptide analysis indicated that both deacetylases generated the same kind of muropeptides (BC3618 converted 57% of muropeptides while BC1960 converted 90% of muropeptides into new species, data not shown). However, after 18-h treatment, BC1960 seemed to convert almost all H. pylori monomeric muropeptides into new muropeptide species, whereas treatment with BC3618 resulted in a mixture of normal H. pylori muropeptides and new species (Fig. 5). Analysis of the resulting muropeptides by MALDI-TOF showed that both enzymes were able to deacetylate monomeric muropeptides (GlcNAc-MurNAc) with varying peptide chain lengths (Table II). The appearance of the same muropeptide in two individual peaks (Table II, peaks 4, 4a*, 5*, and 5a*) might be due to different protonation states of the deacetylated muropeptides in the elution buffers. Interestingly, even anhydro muropeptides (retention time over 65 min) (18Costa K. Bacher G. Allmaier G. Dominguez-Bello M.G. Engstrand L. Falk P. de Pedro M.A. Garcia-del Portillo F. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3710-3715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were converted into new species (Table II, peaks 6* and 9*), which corresponded to the deacetylated ones. Fragmentation of the deacetylated muropeptides by MALDI-PSD confirmed that N-acetylglucosamine residue of muropeptides is deacetylated.Table IIIdentities and quantification of muropeptides from H. pylori peptidoglycanPeak no.aNumbers correspond with peaks in Fig. 5.MALDI-TOFProposed structurebMuropeptides best fitting the relative molecular masses measured by MALDI-TOF.

Open table in a new tab To examine the effect of these enzymes on Bacilli peptidoglycan we used as a model substrate peptidoglycan from vegetative B. subtilis (Table III). Identification of muropeptides was based on the previously reported analysis of B. subtilis peptidoglycan (11Atrih A. Bacher G. Allmaier G. Williamson M.P. Foster S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3956-3996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of B. subtilis vegetative peptidoglycan with BC1960 and BC3618 resulted in an increase of the deacetylated muropeptides from 23.6% (native peptidoglycan) to 36.1% and 26.6%, respectively. Both enzymes catalyze the deacetylation of GlcNAc residues on peptidoglycan, as confirmed by the increase of peak 4, which corresponds to a disaccharide tripeptide with an amide group missing the N-acetylgroup from GlcNAc and the concomitant decrease of muropeptide 3, which corresponds to the acetylated form of this muropeptide (Table III). GlcNAc deacetylase activity of BC1960 is also confirmed by the increase of peaks 18, 22, 23, and 32, which correspond to muropeptides de-acetylated on GlcNAc residues identified in B. subtilis peptidoglycan. BC3618 could also deacetylate to a lower extent certain muropeptides (Table III, peaks 18 and 23), whereas it was ineffective in deacetylating other muropeptides (Table III, peaks 22 and 32).Table IIIIdentities and quantification of muropeptides from B. subtilis peptidoglycanPeak no.aMuropeptide identityaNativeBC1960BC3618Mol%3Disaccharide tripeptide with 1 amidation26.013.414.84Disaccharide tripeptide 1 amidation missing an acetyl group4.18.96.018Disaccharide tripeptide disaccharide tetrapeptide with 1 amidation and missing an acetyl group3.94.24.421Disaccharide tripeptide disaccharide tetrapeptide with 2 amidations31.820.221.922Disaccharide tripeptide disaccharide tetrapeptide with 2 amidations and missing an acetyl group12.316.312.223Disaccharide tripeptide disaccharide tetrapeptide with 2 amidations and missing an acetyl group1.54.32.331Disaccharide tripeptide disaccharide tetrapeptide disaccharide tetrapeptide with 3 amidations3.72.62.732Disaccharide tripeptide disaccharide tetrapeptide disaccharide tetrapeptide with 3 amidations and missing an acetyl group1.92.61.7Peak number and muropeptide identity have been assigned according to Atrih et al.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3956-3996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of Enzymatically Deacetylated Oligomers GlcNAc2–4— Fig. 6 shows the 1H NMR spectra (anomer region) of the chitin oligomers (dimer, trimer, and tetramer) obtained after treatment with BC3618. The spectra of the dimer (Fig. 6A) shows that the major resonances are the α-anomer-reducing end of an acetylated unit (A) at 5.19 ppm and the β-anomer-reducing end of an acetylated unit at 4.74 ppm (19Ishiguro K. Yoshie N. Sakurai M. Inoue Y. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 237: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The α- and β-anomer-reducing end resonances from a deacetylated unit (D), which would be expected to appear at 5.43 and 4.92 ppm, are only present in very low concentrations in the spectrum. The internal D- and A-units resonate at around 4.9 and 4.6 ppm, and only the resonances from the internal D-units can be seen in the spectra (20Vårum K.M. Anthonsen M.W. Grasdalen H. Smidsrød O. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 211: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Thus, the major dimer contains an acetylated reducing end and a deacetylated non-reducing end (DA). Similarly, the trimer (Fig. 6B) and tetramer (Fig. 6C) spectra were assigned, and it was found that the major trimer is DDA and the major tetramer DDDA. Thus, BC1960 and BC3618 were able to deacetylate all units on chitin oligomers (dimer to tetramer) except the reducing end unit. BC1960 and BC3618 behaved similarly with respect to the specificity on chitin oligomers, except that with BC1960 it was possible to deacetylate the reducing end unit of the trimer and the tetramer (but not with the dimer) as substrates upon extended incubation with the enzyme, whereas this was not the case with BC3618. Lysozyme Digestion of B. cereus Peptidoglycan—To examine the effect of the degree of acetylation of vegetative peptidoglycan from B. cereus on the rate of lysozyme degradation four different peptidoglycan substrates from B. cereus were examined: (a) native vegetative peptidoglycan; (b) chemically N-acetylated peptidoglycan and chemically N-acetylated peptidoglycan incubated with either BC1960 (c) or BC3618 (d). We observed that, although native peptidoglycan couldn't be digested, 40% of the chemically acetylated peptidoglycan was solubilized by lysozyme (Fig. 7). Partial digestion of acetylated peptidoglycan by lysozyme might be due to incomplete chemical acetylation of the polymer. However, incubation of chemically acetylated peptidoglycan with either BC1960 or BC3618 resulted in modified substrates resistant to hydrolysis by lysozyme. The genomes of B. cereus (9Read T.

In our effort to shed light on the role of polysaccharide deacetylases in bacteria and contribute to the understanding of the physiology of B. anthracis, we report for the first time the cloning and expression of two peptidoglycan GlcNAc deacetylase genes bc1960 and bc3618 from B. cereus as well as the purification and characterization of the recombinant enzymes. Previous reports on bacterial peptidoglycan deacetylases addressed either partially purified enzymes or not biochemically characterized gene products (5Volmer W. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20496-20501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 6Fukushima T. Yamamoto H. Atrih A. Foster S.J. Sekiguchi J. J.

BC1960 exhibits an overall 36% identity and 57% similarity with BC3618. The sequence similarity with other known polysaccharide deacetylases extends only to the C-terminal, which is the putative NodB domain (Fig. 1). The purified recombinant enzymes exhibit different pH, temperature optima, and thermal stability, whereas they are not inhibited by acetate and they are both activated by CoCl2. Both enzymes were effective in deacetylating peptidoglycan from B. cereus, B. subtilis, H. pylori, as well as glycol chitin, N-acetyl chitooligomers, and the synthetic muropeptide GMPD. However, the enzymes were not active on acetylated xylan. This is the first example of CE4 family enzymes that are active on both peptidoglycans and chitin substrates. It has been previously reported that chitin deacetylase from M. rouxii and acetylxylan esterase from Streptomyces lividans were active on both soluble chitin and acetyl xylan substrates (2Caufrier F. Martinou A. Dupont C. Bouriotis V. Carbohydr. Res. 2003; 338: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, both enzymes were inactive toward peptidoglycan substrates. These results provide insight into the substrate specificity of the CE4 family enzymes. Considering specificity of GlcNAc deacetylases, the enzymes are active on both peptidoglycans and soluble muropeptides. It seems that although the enzymes exhibit a strict specificity for deacetylating GlcNAc residues of peptidoglycan substrates they are able to hydrolyze various muropeptides of different peptide side chains as exemplified in the case of peptidoglycan from H. pylori and B. subtilis (Fig. 5 and Tables II and III). Furthermore, the enzymes are active on substrates whereby the neighboring residue to GlcNAc is not N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) as demonstrated in the cases of GlcNAcn (Fig. 6) and anhydromuropeptides from peptidoglycan of H. pylori (Table II). In support of this observation PgdA from S. pneumoniae, the only peptidoglycan deacetylase identified in this bacterium, carries out the deacetylation of almost 80% of GlcNAc residues in cell wall peptidoglycan (5Volmer W. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20496-20501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Considering enzyme specificity of MurNAc deacetylases, expression of pdaA gene from B. subtilis in E. coli had no effect on modification of E. coli peptidoglycan structure, whereas joint expression of muramoyl-l-alanine amidase (cwlD) and pdaA genes resulted in the formation of muramic-δ-lactam. PdaA probably carries out both deacetylation and lactam ring formation and requires the product of CwlD activity as a substrate (7Gilmore M.E. Bandyopadhyay D. Dean A.M. Linnstaedt S.D. Popham D.L. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 80-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The recently reported structure of PdaA complexed with the substrate analogue N-acetylglucosamine, although possibly representing a non-productive binding mode, revealed interactions of an aspartic acid and three histidines all conserved in the nodB homologous domain with the ligand (8Blair D.E. Van Aalten D.M.F. FEBS Lett. 2004; 570: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). BC1960 and BC3618 exhibit significant sequence similarity with PdaA (68 and 67%, respectively). On the basis of the sequence similarities, similar structures are predicted between the two enzymes and PdaA. Kinetic analysis of BC1960 and BC3618 toward N-acetylchitooligosaccharides GlcNAc2–6 revealed that the catalytic efficiency of the enzymes depended on the length of the oligomers (Table I). Both enzymes required at least two sugar residues for catalysis (although BC3618 showed very low efficiency toward GlcNAc2). Furthermore, GlcNAc4 proved to be the favorable substrate for both enzymes. Identification of the sequence of chitin oligomers (GlcNAc2–4) following enzymatic deacetylation by 1H NMR revealed that both enzymes deacetylate all GlcNAc residues of the oligomers except the reducing end ones (Fig. 6). It has been previously reported that the resistance of pneumonococcal and B. cereus peptidoglycan to lysozyme degradation depends on the degree of acetylation of peptidoglycan (5Volmer W. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20496-20501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 21Severin A. Tabei K. Tomasz A. Microb. Drug Resist. 2004; 10: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Recent analysis of B. cereus peptidoglycan revealed an unusual high percentage of deacetylated GlcNAc residues (21Severin A. Tabei K. Tomasz A. Microb. Drug Resist. 2004; 10: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We have similarly observed that chemical acetylation of vegetative peptidoglycan isolated from B. cereus (ATCC 14579) resulted in enhanced degradation rates by lysozyme. However, enzymatic deacetylation of chemically acetylated peptidoglycan by BC1960 and BC3618 resulted in resistance of this macromolecule to lysozyme degradation (Fig. 7). It is conceivable that the BC1960 and BC3618 or the other orthologues may provide protection against host lysozyme. Further investigations are needed to establish the importance, if any of these enzymes (knock-out studies). In light of the unusual occurrence of multiple putative deacetylases in the Bacillus sp. genomes, especially B. cereus and B. anthracis, we speculate that these enzymes may play different roles in cellular, developmental, or environmental biology of B. cereus (e.g. sporulation, spore germination, vegetative growth, and host-microbe interactions). Clarification of these questions will require a combined biochemical and genetic (knock-out) analysis. Considering the current interest on B. anthracis as a potential bioweapon and the difficulties encountered working with such agents, these studies may set a basis for potential drug design applications targeting enzymes involved in biosynthesis/modification of B. anthracis peptidoglycan. We thank Dr. N. Kyrpides (Integrated Genomics, Chicago, IL) for providing the B. cereus ATCC 14579 clones and Catherine Chaput for preparing the H. pylori peptidoglycan. We also thank Prof. N. Panopoulos for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2069662936,"The fossil record of predation indicates that attacks on Paleozoic brachiopods were very rare, especially compared to those on post-Paleozoic mollusks, yet stratigraphically and geographically widespread. Drilling frequencies were very low in the early Paleozoic (<<1%) and went up slightly in the mid-to-late Paleozoic. Present-day brachiopods revealed frequencies only slightly higher. The persistent rarity of drilling suggests that brachiopods were the secondary casualties of mistaken or opportunistic attacks by the enemies of other taxa. Such sporadic attacks became slightly more frequent as trophic systems escalated and predators diversified. Some evolutionarily persistent biotic interactions may be incidental rather than coevolutionary or escalatory in nature."

To gain a better insight on the stereochemical features of its association with the cell membrane and its interaction with the cannabinoid receptors, we have studied its conformation, location, and dynamic properties in a dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine multilamellar model membrane bilayer system. By exploiting the bilayer lattice as an internal three-dimensional reference grid, the conformation and location of anandamide were determined by measuring selected inter- and intramolecular distances between strategically introduced isotopic labels using the rotational echo double resonance (REDOR) NMR method.

Our results demonstrate that anandamide adopts an extended conformation within the membrane with its headgroup at the level of the phospholipid polar group and its terminal methyl group near the bilayer center. Parallel static 2H NMR experiments further confirmed these findings and provided evidence that anandamide experiences dynamic properties similar to those of the membrane phospholipids and produces no perturbation to the bilayer. Our results are congruent with a hypothesis that anandamide approaches its binding site by laterally diffusing within one membrane leaflet in an extended conformation and interacts with a hydrophobic groove formed by helices 3 and 6 of CB1, where its terminal carbon is positioned close to a key cysteine residue in helix 6 leading to receptor activation.

The membrane lipid bilayer is a ubiquitous molecular assembly into which are embedded a variety of proteins, natural hormones, and neurotransmitters. Accumulated evidence indicates that many fatty acid-derived lipophilic neurotransmitters are synthesized, stored, and degraded and also exert their functions within the lipid membrane (1Bracey M.H. Hanson M.A. Masuda K.R. Stevens R.C. Cravatt B.F. Science. 2002; 298: 1793-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 2Piomelli D. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 873-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been suggested that the conformation, location, and orientation of the ligand in the membrane are critical in determining its ability to reach and interact productively with its site of action (3Herbette L.G. Chester D.W. Rhodes D.G. Biophys. J. 1986; 49: 91-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 4Makriyannis A. Pertwee R.G. Cannabinoid Receptors.

Exploring the conformational and dynamic properties of these ligands in the membrane can lead to a better understanding of the molecular features involved in their interactions with the target proteins (6Inooka H. Ohtaki T. Kitahara O. Ikegami T. Endo S. Kitada C. Ogi K. Onda H. Fujino M. Shirakawa M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). N-Arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide), initially isolated from mammalian brain, has been identified as an endogenous ligand for the two known G protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) (7Devane W.A. Hanaus L. Breuer A. Pertwee R. Stevenson L. Griffing F. Gibson D. Mandelbaum A. Etinger A. Mechoulam R. Science. 1992; 258: 1946-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (4587) Google Scholar). This endocannabinoid exerts its activity by modulating several physiological functions such as pain, cognition, and memory. Site-directed mutagenesis evidence has shown that the anandamide binding sites are embedded in the trans-membrane helices of the receptor (8Hucho F. Neurotransmitter Receptors. 1993; 24: 3-14Google Scholar, 9Song Z.H. Bonner T.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 891-896PubMed Google Scholar). This correlates well with studies of other G protein-coupled receptors, such as rhodopsin and the β-adrenergic receptor, which provide evidence that their respective ligands interact within the trans-membrane domains of the receptor (10Henderson R. Baldwin J.M. Ceska T.A. Zemlin F. Beckmann E. Downing K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 899-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar). Moreover, enzymes that are involved in anandamide biosynthesis and degradation, including a d-type phosphodiesterase (11Cadas H.G. Gaillet S. Beltramo M. Venance L. Piomelli D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3934-3942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and fatty acid amide hydrolase (7Devane W.A. Hanaus L. Breuer A. Pertwee R. Stevenson L. Griffing F. Gibson D. Mandelbaum A. Etinger A. Mechoulam R. Science. 1992; 258: 1946-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (4587) Google Scholar), are also membrane-bound, and their respective substrates and products originate from membrane phospholipids (12Childers S.R. Breivogel C.S. Drug Alcohol Dependence. 1998; 51: 173-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Because all of the above mentioned endocannabinoid-related proteins are membrane-bound, the conformation, location, and dynamic behavior of anandamide within the cell membrane would be of particular importance for a better understanding of the nature of receptor or enzyme activation/deactivation and may also enhance our ability to design novel therapeutic medications acting through the endocannabinoid system. Because of the high lipophilicity (clogP = 6.3) of anandamide, this amphipathic ligand is expected to reside nearly exclusively within the membrane bilayer. Earlier computational work (13Tong W. Collantes E.R. Welsh W.J. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 4207-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 14Barnett-Norris J. Guarnieri F. Hurst D.P. Reggio P.H. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 4861-4872Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) on the conformational properties of anandamide has shown that its arachidonoyl component is capable of assuming a variety of conformations in solution, which can be generally characterized as hairpin (U-shaped), J-shaped, and extended (Fig. 1). Because the structure of anandamide is highly flexible, its conformation could be very sensitive to its immediate environment, and the molecule may exhibit different conformational preferences depending on its surrounding media. However, there were no experimental studies on the conformational properties of anandamide in a bilayer membrane environment. From earlier work with (-)-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) 1The abbreviations used are: Δ9-THC, (-)-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol; DPPC, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine; REDOR, rotational echo double resonance.1The abbreviations used are: Δ9-THC, (-)-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol; DPPC, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine; REDOR, rotational echo double resonance. we had demonstrated that the orientation of a lipophilic ligand within an anisotropic membrane environment does not always conform with the expected predictions based on optimal packing within the phospholipid amphipathic environment (15Makriyannis A. Banijamali A. Jarrell H.C. Yang D.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 986: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our experiments showed that this amphipathic cannabinoid does not align as expected with the long axis of its tricyclic component parallel to the phospholipid chains. Instead, the molecule assumes an awkward orientation in which the long axis of its tricyclic core is perpendicular to the bilayer chain (Fig. 2). We were thus motivated to design a series of experiments to determine experimentally which of the three computationally identified conformations of anandamide is the dominant one in an anisotropic membrane system and to study its location and dynamic properties within the membrane. Traditionally, this information is obtained with the help of high resolution NMR where the ligand conformation is studied in SDS micellar or other membrane-mimicking environments (16Mcdonnell P.A. Opella S.J. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1993; 102: 120-125Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 17Neidigh J.W. Andersen N.H.

However, such approaches suffer from several limitations, one of which is the highly curved nature of micelles that may not serve as an ideal membrane model (19Guo J. Pavlopoulos S. Tian X. Lu D. Nikas S.P. Yang D.-P. Makriyannis A. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 4838-4846Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the case of long chain lipid messengers, such spectra are further complicated by the fact that their respective 1H NMR resonances are unresolved because of severe overlap. In this study, we have employed a novel approach to examine the location and conformation of anandamide in a model membrane system consisting of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) multilamellar bilayers using the rotational echo double resonance (REDOR) NMR technique. We have also used static solid-state 2H NMR to obtain information on the dynamic properties of anandamide in the bilayer.Fig. 2Structures of Δ9-THC and anandamide. The orientation of Δ9-THC in a lipid membrane bilayer is indicated by the dashed line, which represents the long axis of the phospholipid bilayer chains. In this orientation, the molecule positions its phenolic hydroxyl group toward the polar side of the membrane and its long axis is perpendicular to the bilayer chains.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Our experimental strategy was to employ the phospholipid multilamellar bilayer system not only as a model membrane environment but also as an internal reference grid for the incorporated anandamide molecule because this supramolecular lipid assembly is a highly organized lattice (20Katsaras J. Raghunathan V.A. Dufourc E.J. Dufourcq J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4684-4688Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The conformation of anandamide can then be obtained by determining the geometric relationships between anandamide and the lipid molecules. This was accomplished by identifying key atom pairs within the anandamide/DPPC bilayer assembly and determining the respective intra- or intermolecular distances using rotational echo double resonance (REDOR), a powerful solid-state NMR method capable of accurately measuring distances between two different nuclei, such as 13C–31P, 13C–15N, and 13C–2H (21Gullion T. Schaefer J. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 81: 196-200Crossref Scopus (1527) Google Scholar, 22Schaefer J. Ernst Schering Res. Found. Workshop. 1998; 26: 25-52Google Scholar). This technique uniquely allows the measurement of mid-range internuclear distances and has been applied successfully to study peptide backbone conformations and ligand-protein binding geometries (23Mueller D.D. Schmidt A. Pappan K.L. McKay R.A. Schaefer J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5597-5603Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 24Hirsh D.J. Hammer J. Maloy W.L. Blazyk J. Schaefer J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12733-12741Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A distance range of 8.0 Å may be reliably measured for a pair of high γ nuclei, such as 13C and 31P. Although the measurable distance is shorter for the low γ 2H nucleus, this range is expanded in the experiments described here because of the dipolar contributions of multiple 2H atoms with each of the observed 13C nuclei. In this study, we have introduced 13C, 15N, and 2H isotopic labeling in strategic positions within anandamide and the surrounding DPPC molecules and determined the preferred conformation of anandamide within the bilayer using selected internuclear distances between these labels through a series of REDOR experiments (Fig. 3). The exact location and conformation of anandamide in the lipid bilayer were obtained by simulating the multispin REDOR dephasing data based on our proposed molecular model of the anandamide/DPPC system. Parallel static solid-state 2H NMR experiments with the anandamide/DPPC system in the liquid crystalline phase (Lα) were used to confirm further our findings and obtain information on the dynamic properties of this endocannabinoid within the cell membrane from which it originates and is believed to reside. This approach may also be of general interest for studying the conformational properties of other small molecules, peptides, and integral membrane proteins within a membrane system. DPPC was 2H labeled independently at the 2′,7′, and 16′ positions of both sn-1 and sn-2 acyl chains (Fig. 3) to obtain 1,2-[2′-2H2]DPPC, 1,2-[7′-2H2]DPPC, 1,2-[16′-2H3]DPPC (25Yang D.P. Mavromoustakos T. Beshah K. Makriyannis A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1103: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), whereas [1′-13C]anandamide, [20-13C,15N]anandamide, and [20-2H3]anandamide (Fig. 3) were synthesized using methods described elsewhere (26Yao F.-M. Palmer S.L. Khanolkar A.D. Tian X. Guo J. Makriyannis A. J. Labelled Compounds Radiopharmaceut. 2003; 46: 115-129Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Deuterium-depleted water was purchased from Aldrich. Eleven samples of fully hydrated DPPC multilamellar bilayers with and without anandamide (10 mol %) were prepared. Six of these were used for two groups of REDOR experiments (see Fig. 3). The three samples in the first group were [1′-13C]anandamide/[31P]DPPC, [1′-13C]anandamide/1,2-[2′-2H2]DPPC, and [1′-13C]anandamide/1,2-[7′-2H2]DPPC, where the anandamide 1′-13C label was used as the observe nucleus and the DPPC labels 31P, 2′-2H, or 7′-2H2 as the dephased nucleus. The three samples in the second group were [20-13C]anandamide/1,2-[16′-2H3]DPPC, [20-13C]anandamide/1,2-[7′-2H2]DPPC, and [20-13C, 15N]anandamide/unlabeled DPPC, where the anandamide 20-13C label was used as the observe nucleus and DPPC 16′-2H, 7′-2H2, or anandamide 15N as the dephased nucleus. The remaining five samples: [20-2H3]anandamide/unlabeled DPPC, 1,2-[2′-2H2]DPPC, 1,2-[16′-2H3]DPPC, unlabeled anandamide/1,2-[2′-2H2]DPPC, and unlabeled anandamide/1,2-[16′-2H3]DPPC, were used in the static solid-state 2H NMR experiments. To prevent lipid oxidation, each sample preparation was carried out in a nitrogen atmosphere using a glove box. Mixtures of DPPC (45 mg) and anandamide were first dissolved in chloroform and the solvent removed by passing a stream of nitrogen over the solution. The residue was then placed under vacuum for 10 h, and 2H-depleted water was added to the dried sample to produce a 50% (w/w) lipid/water preparation. Each semisolid membrane preparation was then introduced into a 4-mm glass tube, sealed under vacuum, gently vortexed, equilibrated at 50 °C for 20 min, and subsequently stored at -20 °C. REDOR Experiments—All NMR experiments were carried out on a Chemagnetics CMX300 solid-state spectrometer (Fort Collins, CO). Each sealed sample was first allowed to equilibrate for 20 min at 50 °C and packed into a 5-mm zirconia rotor. This was then inserted into a Chemagnetics triple resonance probe and cooled rapidly to -40 °C. The rotor was driven by nitrogen gas, whereas the gas flow and temperature were controlled by a Chemagnetics air and temperature controller equipped with a dry ice/acetone bath. The magic angle spinning speed was set to 4,000 Hz and controlled by the MAS controller with a fluctuation of ±2 Hz. The observe nucleus was always 13C resonating at 75.43 MHz, whereas the dephased nucleus was 2H, 31P, or 15N at 46.05, 121.44, or 30.39 MHz, respectively. A contact pulse (1.6-ms duration and 50-kHz power) was applied in the proton channel (299.99 MHz) for cross-polarization, and its power was increased to 82 kHz for proton decoupling (see Fig. 4). The observed 13C resonances in the experiments are well resolved and separated from other chemical shift signals in the 13C spectrum of the sample. To invert the deuterium nuclei for sufficient dephasing, a composite XY-4 π-pulse scheme was employed on the 2H channel, whereas an XY-8 composite pulse scheme was used on the 13C channel to compensate for possible pulse imperfections (27Sack I. Goldbourt A. Vega S. Buntkowsky G. J. Magn. Reson. 1999; 138: 54-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A sample of [1-13C,2-2H3]sodium acetate (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, MA) was used as a standard for all 13C observe, 2H dephased REDOR experiments. Static Solid-state 2H NMR—All of the deuterium spectra were obtained using a Chemagnetics CMX300 spectrometer operating at 46.05 MHz with a wideline probe at 42 °C. The quadrupole echo pulse sequence, [(π/2)x-τ-(π/2)y], was employed with 2.5 μs for the 2H π/2 pulse, 35 μs for τ, and 200 ms for recycle delay. A total of 5,000 echoes were accumulated for each spectrum. Before recording a spectrum, each sample was held at 50 °C in the probe for 15 min to ensure complete equilibration. Solid-state REDOR NMR experiments were used to elucidate the location and conformation of anandamide within the DPPC multilamellar membrane bilayer by detecting heteronuclear dipolar couplings between anandamide and the phospholipid molecules, as well as between the 20-13C- and 15N-labeled sites of anandamide. Each of our REDOR experiments consists of two parallel parts: the 13C signal is first observed without the dephasing pulse train and is then repeated with the dephasing pulse train applied. The intensity difference ΔS between the two spectra can be directly related to the dipolar coupling of each spin pair, from which the internuclear distance can be deduced (28Pan Y. Gullion T. Schaefer J. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 90: 330-340Google Scholar). The first group of experiments (1′-13C-observe) was aimed at determining the location of the anandamide headgroup, and we observed positive effects (ΔS ≥ 0) in both the 1′-13C-observe, 31P-dephased (1′-13C/31P) and the 1′-13C-observe, 2′-2H2-dephased (1′-13C/2′-2H2) experiments. However, no effects (ΔS = 0) were observed in the 1′-13C/7′-2H2 REDOR experiment. The second group (20-13C-observe) was designed to identify the location of the anandamide terminal methyl within the DPPC bilayer. Only in the 20-13C/16′-2H3 experiment did we observe positive effects, whereas the 20-13C/7′-2H2 and 20-13C/15N experiments showed no effects, evidence that these internuclear distances are beyond the REDOR detection limits. Anandamide Headgroup (1′-13C-Observe REDOR Experiments)—The location of the anandamide headgroup within the lipid bilayer was identified from three REDOR experiments. Fig. 5, left panel, shows four pairs of 1′-13C/31P REDOR spectra in which the 13C resonance was detected at 46.0 ppm. The experiment revealed an intensity difference (ΔS) in each pair of resonances which became progressively pronounced as the rotor cycle increased from 16 to 64. The 13C signal was almost completely eliminated because of the 31P dephasing at rotor cycle 64, indicating a strong coupling between the 1′-13C of anandamide and 31P of the DPPC headgroup. In the second experiment, pairs of 1′-13C/2′-2H2 REDOR spectra were collected, four of which are shown in Fig. 5, right panel. Here again, the signal intensity difference ΔS for each pair increased noticeably as the rotor cycle progressed from 16 to 64, indicating that the 13C label of the anandamide headgroup is located in the proximity of the 2′-2H labels of DPPC. Conversely, no differences in the signal intensity were observed in the 1′-13C/7′-2H2 experiments (data not shown), indicating that the dipolar coupling between 1′-13C of anandamide and the deuterons at the 7′ position of DPPC is beyond the REDOR detection limit. Collectively, the results from the above three sets of experiments provide evidence that the headgroup of anandamide is located at the water/lipid interface. Such a location also allows for possible intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the anandamide headgroup hydroxyl and the phosphate of DPPC. Anandamide Terminal Methyl Group (20-13C-Observe REDOR Experiments)—To determine the location of the anandamide terminal methyl group within the lipid bilayer, we used [20-13C]anandamide in 20-13C/16′-2H3, 20-13C/7′-2H2, and 20-13C/15N REDOR experiments. Pairs of 20-13C/16′-2H3 REDOR spectra exhibited large ΔS values (Fig. 6, left panel), providing evidence for strong coupling and close proximity between the 20-13C label on anandamide and the terminal methyl deuterons of the DPPC acyl chains. Conversely, the 20-13C/7′-2H2 REDOR spectral pairs showed no discernible intensity differences (Fig. 6, right panel), indicating that the terminal methyl group of anandamide is beyond the measurable range from the middle of the DPPC acyl chains. The 20-13C/15N REDOR experiments using doubly labeled anandamide with 15N in its headgroup and 13C in the terminal methyl showed essentially no difference in their respective intensities (data not shown), thus providing evidence that the anandamide terminal methyl group is also not in close proximity with its own headgroup. Anandamide Adopts the Extended Conformation in Lipid Bilayer—The above six REDOR experiments provided evidence for the location of both the headgroup and terminal methyl of anandamide with respect to the DPPC lipid bilayer. The results also allow for a clear choice among the three possible anandamide conformations. In the U- or J-shaped conformation, the anandamide 20-13C label would be located near the DPPC 2′-2H2 or 7′-2H2 label, respectively, and should have led to strong REDOR effects in the corresponding experiments. However, if anandamide adopts the extended conformation in lipid bilayers, we would expect the anandamide 20-13C label to be near the DPPC 16′-methyl group. Because strong REDOR effects were observed only in the 20-13C/16′-2H3 experiment, we therefore concluded that anandamide must exist, at least predominantly, in an extended conformation. Structural Model for Anandamide within the DPPC Bilayer—In our experiment, each measured dipolar coupling may result from interactions of the 13C-observe with nuclei from multiple sites as one anandamide molecule is surrounded by a number of DPPC molecules. To obtain a more quantitative interpretation of our REDOR data, we have constructed a molecular model representing the geometric relationship between anandamide and DPPC, using the Accelrys Insight II/Discover modeling software. The DPPC bilayer assembly in the subgel Lc′ phase was constructed based on earlier x-ray crystallographic data (20Katsaras J. Raghunathan V.A. Dufourc E.J. Dufourcq J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4684-4688Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 29Hauser H. Pascher I. Pearson R.H. Sundell S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 650: 21-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). When an anandamide molecule adopts the extended conformation, it structurally resembles a lipid acyl chain. Based on this model, one anandamide molecule occupies a site similar to that of one of the DPPC acyl chains as shown in Fig. 7, laterally shifting the DPPC acyl chains from sites AB to BC. In this representation, the tail of the anandamide molecule is surrounded by six DPPC acyl chains arranged in a hexagonal structure, whereas the anandamide headgroup is surrounded by four phosphate headgroups arranged in a rhomboidal configuration. Fig. 8 depicts side and top views of an anandamide molecule surrounded by four DPPC molecules within one bilayer leaflet in which the intermolecular 1′-13C/31P, 1′-13C/2′-2H2, and 20-13C/16′-2H3 geometric relationships are represented.Fig. 8Three-dimensional model of the anandamide/DPPC lattice. Left, the side view shows four DPPC molecules surrounding one anandamide molecule, and the top view shows the projections of six acyl chains forming a hexagon and four headgroups in a rhomboidal arrangement. Right, spatial relationships between 1′-13C of anandamide and the 31P of DPPC, between the 1′-13C of anandamide and the 2′-2H2 of the DPPC sn-2 chain, and between the 20-13C of anandamide and the 16-2H3 of DPPC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Numerical Analysis of the Multispin REDOR Dephasing— For a multispin system, the REDOR intensity difference ΔS/S0 can be calculated by (30Goetz J.M. Schaefer J. J. Magn. Reson. 1997; 127: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar)ΔSS0=1−18π2∫ψ=02π∫θ=0π∫ϕ=02π∏icos[NcωDivR42[n^′(i)⋅y^][n^′(i)⋅z^]]dϕsinθdθdψ(eq.1) where νR is the rotor frequency, Nc is the number of rotor cycles,ωDi=γ1γ2h4π2ri3(eq.2) is the dipolar coupling constant of the ith 2H or 31P to 13C, andn^′(i) is the Euler rotation of the unit vector from the ith 2H or 31P to 13C. To simulate the experimental REDOR dephasing curve (ΔS/S0 versus Nc), we developed a computer integration program using the Gaussian quadrature numerical algorithm under a Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation. Based on our model, the 1′-13C/31P rhomboidal arrangement requires two distinct 13C–31P distances r1 and r2. In our numerical simulation, a series of REDOR dephasing curves are generated by systematically varying these two distances. Fig. 9a shows three of the simulated curves where the best fit is for values of r1 = 5.7 Å and r2 = 8.4 Å, each with an uncertainty of about ± 0.2 Å. According to our model, the 2H labels contributing to the 13C–2H dephasing are equidistant for the observed 1′- or 20-13C of anandamide. For this reason, only one r value was required in our calculations for the 1′-13C/2′-2H2 and 20-13C/16′-2H3 experiments. The dephasing curves for the anandamide 1′-13C and DPPC sn-2-[2′-2H2] interactions within the triangular arrangement are shown in Fig. 9b, with an optimal distance of 6.0 Å ± 0.5 Å. For the 20-13C/16′-2H3 interactions within the hexagonal arrangement, the simulated REDOR curves are plotted in Fig. 9c. The best fit for the experimental data corresponds to a distance of r = 6.5 Å, with an upper limit of 7.0 Å and a lower limit of 6.0 Å. The obtained distances, in conjunction with the structural coordinates of the DPPC supramolecular assembly, unequivocally establish that anandamide adopts an extended conformation with an estimated total “length” of 22 Å in the membrane bilayer. The above REDOR experiments were carried out at a low temperature (-40 °C) by necessity to minimize molecular motions within the bilayer system and allow for the measurement of dipolar interactions between specific atoms within the anandamide/DPPC assembly. To obtain parallel structural information on the anandamide/DPPC system under more “physiological” conditions, we carried out a series of static solid-state 2H NMR experiments using DPPC 2H-labeled at the 2′ and 16′ positions as well as anandamide carrying 2H labels at its terminal methyl group. The spectra in Fig. 10 were obtained at 42 °C, a temperature at which the fully hydrated DPPC bilayer exists in the liquid crystalline L phase. The 2H spectrum from 1,2[2′-2H2]DPPC confirmed that our membrane preparation exists in the liquid crystalline Lα phase and showed a set of three superimposed Pake patterns with quadrupolar splittings of ΔνQ = 12.0, 17.8, and 26.7 kHz, caused by 2-[2′S-2H], 2-[2′R-2H], and 1-[2′-2H2], respectively, based on our earlier assignments (25Yang D.P. Mavromoustakos T. Beshah K. Makriyannis A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1103: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The 2H spectrum caused by 1,2-[16′-2H3]DPPC from the terminal methyl groups has a ΔνQ value of 3.1 kHz. This narrower splitting reflects a considerably freer movement of this segment of the acyl chain. Addition of 10% (molar) anandamide to each of the two DPPC preparations leads only to very small increases in the ΔνQ values, indicating that this endocannabinoid ligand has only a minor effect on the dynamic properties of the phospholipid bilayer. The above data suggest an anandamide/DPPC model in which the lipophilic ligand is well integrated into the bilayer membrane with its long axis parallel to the phospholipid acyl chains. Further support for this model is provided by the 2H experiment from the terminal methyl group of anandamide in which the quadrupolar splitting (ΔνQ = 3.0 kHz) is very similar to the respective spectrum from the 16′ methyl groups of DPPC, suggesting that the terminal methyl groups from anandamide and DPPC exhibit similar motional properties and arguably occupy a similar space within the bilayer. It is interesting to compare our findings with work related to the structural properties of unsaturated membrane lipids because anandamide is derived from polyunsaturated phospholipids. Recent studies involving unsaturated diaryl phospholipids such as 1-palmitoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PDPC) and 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (SDPC) show that in the gel Lβ phase, both the saturated and the polyunsaturated chains adopt the all-trans and extended (angle iron or helical) conformations, respectively (31Barry J.A. Trouard T.P. Salmon A. Brown M.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8386-8394Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 32Binder H. Gawrisch K. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2001; 105: 12378-12390Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A similar result was obtained from studies on PDPC and 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (SAPC) molecules in the liquid crystalline Lα phase using either computational or 2H NMR approaches (33Applegate K.R. Glomset J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 658-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Applegate K.R. Glomset J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1635-1644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results now indicate that anandamide, which represents a single chain polyunsaturated lipid and is devoid of a phospholipid headgroup, also assumes such a preferred extended conformation when incorporated in a phospholipid bilayer. The findings reported here serve to expand our current understanding on the structural features of the interaction of anandamide with cell membrane and allow us to speculate on the manner with which this endogenous ligand interacts with its respective receptors. Based on substantial experimental evidence, it has been proposed that lipophilic ligands interact with their respective target proteins by first partitioning into the membrane bilayer where they assume a preferred location and orientation (5Xie X.Q. Melvin L.S. Makriyannis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10640-10647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We can thus postulate that the lipophilic anandamide resides predominantly within the membrane bilayer either following its release within a neural synapse or after its enzymatic synthesis within the cell membrane by membrane-bound enzymes (7Devane W.A. Hanaus L. Breuer A. Pertwee R. Stevenson L. Griffing F. Gibson D. Mandelbaum A. Etinger A. Mechoulam R. Science. 1992; 258: 1946-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (4587) Google Scholar). While in the bilayer, the endocannabinoid ligand engages in fast lateral diffusion within the bilayer leaflet before undergoing a productive interaction with the receptor. Our results supporting an extended conformation for anandamide with its headgroup at the level of the bilayer phosphate and a length of ∼22.0 Å suggest that the CB1 cannabinoid receptor may have a ligand entry port of equivalent size. Our results also demonstrate that such an alignment does not lead to any unfavorable membrane perturbations. Such an interaction allows anandamide to access helices 3 and 6, which are believed to be involved in CB1 receptor activation (Fig. 11). This hypothesis is congruent with data 2R. Picone and A. Makriyannis, unpublished results. suggesting that the terminal five-carbon chain of the anandamide arachidonoyl moiety interacts with the CB1 receptor through a hydrophobic groove situated at the level of the bilayer center and involved with the participation of hydrophobic residues V6.43 and I6.46 (35Barnett-Norris J. Hurst D.P. Buehner K. Ballesteros J.A. Guarnieri F. Reggio P.H. Int. J. Quantum Chem. 2002; 88: 76-86Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We therefore propose that such an extended conformation of anandamide in the lipid bilayer may facilitate a productive interaction between this endocannabinoid and its CB1 receptor. The same hydrophobic groove has been shown to be involved in the interaction of the five carbon side chain of the plant derived cannabinergic ligand, Δ9-THC, and some of its more potent longer chain classical cannabinoid analogs. Work from our laboratory has confirmed that a cysteine residue in helix 6 (Cys-47) reacts covalently with an electrophilic isothiocyanate group introduced at the terminal carbon of the cannabinoid ligand side chain. It is believed that this cysteine residue is a conserved key residue involved in the activation of many G protein-coupled receptors. Our hypothesis is strengthened further by recent data suggesting a similar covalent interaction between the cysteine 47 and an anandamide derivative carrying an isothiocyanate group at its terminal C-20 carbon. 3A. Makriyannis and I. Chen, unpublished results. Our solid-state REDOR experiments provide evidence for anandamide existing in an extended conformation within DPPC bilayers in the subgel phase. Parallel experiments using static solid-state 2H NMR support a similar conformation for anandamide in the Lα liquid crystalline bilayer system. In the phospholipid bilayer environment, the arachidonoyl chain of anandamide assumes an orientation parallel to the lipid acyl chains with its terminal methyl group near the bilayer center. The anandamide headgroup is located near the bilayer lipid/water interface and may be engaged in hydrogen bonding interactions with the lipid phosphate groups. Furthermore, our 2H NMR experiments provide evidence that in the liquid crystalline phase, the dynamic properties of anandamide are generally similar to those of the bilayer phospholipids and indicate that while in the above location and conformation, the endocannabinoid does not lead to unfavorable perturbation of the membrane bilayer. The results are congruent with a hypothesis that anandamide approaches its binding site by laterally diffusing within one membrane leaflet in an extended conformation and activates the cannabinoid receptors by interacting with a hydrophobic groove formed by helices 3 and 6 while its terminal carbon is very closely positioned to a key cysteine residue in helix 6."

In vitro studies demonstrating transfer of preformed scaffold-[FeS] complexes to apoprotein acceptors have provided experimental support for this hypothesis, but investigations to date have yielded only single-cluster transfer events. We describe an in vitro assay system that allows for real-time monitoring of [FeS] cluster formation using circular dichroism spectroscopy and use this to investigate de novo [FeS] cluster formation and transfer from Escherichia coli IscU and IscA to apo-ferredoxin. Both IscU and IscA were found to be capable of multiple cycles of [2Fe2S] cluster formation and transfer suggesting that these scaffold proteins are capable of acting “catalytically.” Kinetic studies further showed that cluster transfer exhibits Michaelis-Menten behavior indicative of complex formation of holo-IscU and holo-IscA with apoferredoxin and consistent with a direct [FeS] cluster transfer mechanism. Analysis of the dependence of the rate of cluster transfer, however, revealed enhanced efficiency at low ratios of scaffold to acceptor protein suggesting participation of a transient, labile scaffold-[FeS] species in the transfer process.

The biosynthesis of iron-sulfur proteins is a multistep process involving a number of specialized proteins that mediate [FeS] cluster formation and delivery to acceptor proteins (reviewed in Refs. 1Frazzon J.

One of the key features of the current view of the pathway is the proposed participation of protein scaffolds that function as the initial sites for formation of transient [FeS] clusters; these molecular scaffolds may serve to guide cluster assembly, protect nascent clusters in the cellular environment, and/or assist in cluster transfer to acceptor proteins. The concept of scaffold-mediated metallocluster formation emerged from studies on the nitrogenase MoFe protein (4Shah V.K. Brill W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The mechanism of cluster transfer, however, is poorly understood. The structures of the scaffold-[FeS] complexes are not known, and the exact forms of [FeS] cluster(s) transferred have not been established. The solution NMR (20Ramelot T.A. Cort J.R. Goldsmith-Fischman S. Kornhaber G.J. Xiao R. Shastry R. Acton T.B. Honig B. Montelione G.T. Kennedy M.A. J. Mol.

Biol. 2004; 338: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) show that cysteine residues presumed to be involved in binding to iron atoms of the clusters are located at the surface of the apo-forms of the scaffold proteins. The scaffold-bound [FeS] clusters are therefore likely to be at least partially exposed to solvent and accessible for transfer to acceptor proteins. Little is known about how the clusters are released, but there is some evidence for a direct transfer involving scaffold-acceptor complexes. Studies employing a modified form of human Isu containing a 57Fe-labeled cluster showed that the label did not exchange with ferrous sulfate present in solution during cluster transfer to apo-ferredoxin (15Wu S. Wu G. Surerus K.K. Cowan J.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8876-8885Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and studies with Escherichia coli IscA and SufA showed that the iron chelator bathophenanthroline sulfonate does not interfere with cluster transfer to apo-BioB (12Ollagnier-de-Choudens S.

These findings are consistent with a mechanism in which transfer occurs without a significant degree of cluster disassembly and reassembly and suggest that clusters may be captured immediately upon release from the scaffold protein or may be transferred directly in a scaffold-acceptor protein complex. Evidence that complex formation can occur has been obtained for IscA-ferredoxin and SufA-BioB pairs using affinity chromatography (16Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Mattioli T. Takahashi Y. Fontecave M. J.

Chem. 2002; 7: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, the nature of the scaffold-acceptor interactions has not been characterized, and it has not been firmly established that complex formation is required for cluster transfer. Although these in vitro studies provide support for scaffold proteins in [FeS] cluster assembly and delivery, the cluster transfers described to date have been relatively inefficient. In some cases the overall yield of cluster transfer has approached 100%, but the transfer rates observed have generally been slow (kobs <0.1 min–1) and in some cases much slower than the cell division time of the source organism. This raises the question of whether the observed transfers reflect the physiological mechanism of cluster formation and transfer or whether they are simply a thermodynamic consequence of the greater stability of the acceptor protein-[FeS] complexes compared with that of the scaffold-[FeS] complexes. In addition, none of the studies reported has demonstrated that the scaffold protein is able to function in the manner expected for a carrier-type catalyst, i.e. to mediate multiple cluster transfer reactions. In each study a stoichiometric or excess amount of preformed scaffold-[FeS] complex was used to deliver cluster to the acceptor protein, and turnover or recycling of the scaffold proteins has not been demonstrated. This raises the question of whether [FeS] complexes of scaffold proteins can function sufficiently rapidly to support the iron-sulfur protein requirements of the cell. In the studies described herein we have developed an in vitro assay system that allows for real-time monitoring of [FeS] cluster formation in solutions containing both scaffold and acceptor proteins. We have used this system to investigate de novo [FeS] cluster formation and transfer from the E. coli proteins IscU and IscA to E. coli apo-ferredoxin. This system has allowed us to observe multiple [FeS] cluster transfer cycles and to investigate the dependence of transfer rate on scaffold and acceptor protein concentrations. Protein—Recombinant forms of E. coli apo-IscU (23Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 790-7795Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar), apo-IscA (22Cupp-Vickery J.R. Silberg J.J. Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and ferredoxin (24Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11120-11125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared according to previously published procedures, and protein concentrations were determined as described therein. Concentrations of the holo-forms of IscU, IscA, and ferredoxin are reported in terms of the [2Fe2S] complex of each protein. IscU behaves as a dimer in both the apo- and holo-forms (8Agar J.N. Krebs C. Frazzon J. Huynh B.H. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 23Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 790-7795Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and concentrations are therefore reported in terms of the (IscU)2-[2Fe2S] complex. The oligomeric state of IscA is less well defined (11Wu G. Mansy S.S. Hemann C. Hille R. Surerus K.K. Cowan J.A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 16Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Mattioli T. Takahashi Y. Fontecave M. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2003; 270: 1662-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), but the crystal structure of apo-IscA suggests that two [2Fe2S] clusters can be bound to a tetramer (22Cupp-Vickery J.R. Silberg J.J. Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and concentrations are therefore reported in terms of an (IscA)2-[2Fe2S] complex. Holo-ferredoxin contains a single [2Fe2S] cluster (24Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11120-11125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kakuta Y. Horio T. Takahashi Y. Fukuyama K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1007-11012Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Sample Handling and Cluster Reconstitution—Sample manipulations, including reagent preparation and chromatography, were carried out anaerobically under argon in septum-capped vials, cuvettes, or columns, and stainless steel needles, tubing, and cannulae were used for sample transfers. Unless otherwise specified the buffer used was 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm dithiothreitol (TD buffer), and the temperature was maintained at 25 °C. Holo-IscU was prepared by three sequential additions at 5-min intervals of 0.5 eq of ferric ammonium citrate and lithium sulfide to apo-IscU; the final solution thus contained 1.5-fold greater concentrations of iron and sulfide than required for formation of the (IscU)2-[2Fe2S] complex. Holo-IscA was prepared similarly using ferrous ammonium sulfate in place of the ferric salt. For both proteins formation of [2Fe2S] clusters was monitored by visible region CD spectroscopy (cf. Fig. 1). In some cases (IscU)2-[2Fe2S] and (IscA)2-[2Fe2S] were purified by sequential gel permeation and ion exchange anaerobic chromatography on small G25 and DE52 columns; both holo-forms were found to be stable for at least 24 h under anaerobic conditions at 0 °C. Elemental analyses of holo-IscU and holo-IscA for iron and sulfide were consistent with the presence of one [2Fe2S] cluster per dimer. Ferredoxin was isolated as the [2Fe2S] complex (24Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11120-11125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apo-ferredoxin was prepared by precipitating the holo-form in 10% trichloroacetic acid containing 10 mm dithiothreitol for 10 min at 0 °C. The sample was collected by centrifugation, washed twice in water under anaerobic conditions, and dissolved anaerobically in TD buffer. Cluster Transfer Studies—Unless otherwise specified, apo-IscU (or apo-IscA) and apo-ferredoxin in TD buffer were mixed at 25 °C in a 1-ml cuvette with 0.2 mm ferric (or ferrous) salt, typically equivalent to five times the amount of apo-ferredoxin (i.e. 2.5-fold that required for formation of the [2Fe2S]-ferredoxin). Lithium sulfide was used as the source of sulfide rather than the physiological donor cysteine and IscS (8Agar J.N. Krebs C. Frazzon J. Huynh B.H. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) to ensure that sulfide availability was not rate-limiting. Reactions were initiated by the addition of five equivalents of lithium sulfide (0.2 mm final concentration), and the kinetics of cluster assembly and transfer were monitored by CD spectroscopy. Control experiments, in the absence of scaffold protein, were also carried out to determine the background rates of ferredoxin-[2Fe2S] formation. Analytical Method—Analyses for iron and sulfide were carried out as described previously (26Iametti S. Bera A.K. Vecchio G. Grinberg A. Bernhardt R. Bonomi F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2421-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). CD measurements were recorded at 25 °C in 1-cm path anaerobic cuvettes using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter. Circular Dichroism of [FeS] Complexes—Previous [FeS] cluster transfer studies utilized UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, analytical gel electrophoresis, or biochemical assays to determine the amount of acceptor complex formed. The electrophoretic and biochemical methods employed require interrupting the transfer reaction and/or separation of scaffold and acceptor proteins and do not allow for real-time characterization of reaction progress (9Wu G.

Berndt C. Bill E. Schwenn J.D. Seidler A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1662-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). UV-visible spectroscopy has been used to directly monitor cluster transfer with IscA and SufA (12Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Nachin L. Sanakis Y. Loiseau L. Barras F. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17993-18001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Mattioli T. Takahashi Y. Fontecave M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 9: 828-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), but the general similarity and the absence of protein-specific signature features of the absorption spectra of [FeS] complexes makes it difficult to determine whether intermediate species having different coordination and/or geometry might occur during the transfer reaction. CD spectra of metal complexes are generally more complex than absorption spectra and provide increased sensitivity for detecting differences in cluster properties. The near UV-visible region CD of the [2Fe2S] complex of E. coli IscU (39Urbina H.D. Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44521-44526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) is qualitatively similar to that of E. coli ferredoxin-[2Fe2S] (24Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11120-11125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with similar cluster coordination, but the CD intensity of IscU2-[2Fe2S] is weaker suggesting different cluster environments in the two proteins. The CD of IscA has not been reported, but models of [2Fe2S] complexes of IscA based on the crystal structure (22Cupp-Vickery J.R. Silberg J.J. Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) suggest that the cluster environment is likely to be much different from that of ferredoxin (25Kakuta Y. Horio T. Takahashi Y. Fukuyama K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1007-11012Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether CD could provide a more sensitive means of monitoring cluster transfer from IscU and/or IscA to ferredoxin. Fig. 1 shows near UV-visible region CD spectra of purified [2Fe2S] forms of IscU, IscA, native ferredoxin, and ferredoxin reconstituted using the scaffold proteins. Native ferredoxin-[2Fe2S] was isolated as described previously (24Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11120-11125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and IscU2-[2Fe2S] and IscA2-[2Fe2S] were prepared and purified as described under “Materials and Methods.” Apo-ferredoxin was reconstituted by equilibration for 18–22 h under anaerobic conditions with the purified IscU2-[2Fe2S] or IscA2-[2Fe2S] complexes. An excess of apo-ferredoxin (1.6 eq) was used to favor complete cluster transfer from the scaffold proteins. For both IscU and IscA the CD spectrum of the reconstituted ferredoxin is qualitatively indistinguishable from the native ferredoxin-[2Fe2S] complex, consistent with a lack of effect of the source of the [FeS] cluster on the properties of the ferredoxin product. In addition, UV-visible absorption spectra and iron and sulfide analysis of the isolated reconstituted ferredoxins confirmed that the products were the expected [2Fe2S] complexes. With IscU2-[2Fe2S] as the donor the yield of ferredoxin-[2Fe2S] was essentially quantitative (≅98%) with respect to the amount of cluster available, whereas the yield was somewhat lower with IscA2-[2Fe2S] (≅90%). In both cases the large difference in CD intensity of ferredoxin-[2Fe2S] compared with that of the scaffold complexes and the spectral detail over this wavelength range provide a sensitive means to monitor [FeS] cluster transfer. Catalysis of Cluster Transfer by IscU—The results in Fig. 1 establish transfer of preformed [FeS] clusters from IscU2-[2Fe2S] and IscA2-[2Fe2S] to apo-ferredoxin. To determine whether IscU and IscA are able to mediate multiple cluster transfer cycles requires: 1) use of substoichiometric amounts of the scaffold protein relative to apo-ferredoxin, 2) a system for continuous regeneration of the scaffold-[2Fe2S] complex, and 3) that the rate of cluster assembly on the scaffold is greater than the rate of unassisted ferredoxin cluster assembly. As described under “Materials and Methods” we found that IscU2-[2Fe2S] was formed in good yield using ferric ammonium citrate and lithium sulfide in TD buffer, and we monitored the rate of cluster formation at 25 °C by single-wavelength CD measurements at 540 nm. Supplemental Fig. 1 shows that using 100 μm apo-IscU, formation of IscU2-[2Fe2S] is >90% complete within 5 min with kobs ≅ 0.3 min–1. Spontaneous formation of ferredoxin-[2Fe2S] under similar conditions, in contrast, is much slower and requires several hours to reach completion (see below). Therefore under these conditions formation of holo-IscU is not expected to be rate-limiting, and the rate of holo-ferredoxin formation in mixtures of apo-IscU and apo-ferredoxin will reflect the rate of cluster transfer from holo-IscU to apo-ferredoxin and/or ferredoxin cluster maturation. Initial studies to test for a catalytic role of IscU in mediating multiple cluster transfers were carried out using apo-IscU2 and apo-ferredoxin in a molar ratio of 0.1 to 1. In the experiment shown in Fig. 2 apo-ferredoxin alone or apo-ferredoxin and apo-IscU were pre-equilibrated in the presence of ferric ammonium citrate, and cluster formation was initiated by addition of lithium sulfide. IscU was found to significantly enhance cluster assembly on ferredoxin. The initial rate of ferredoxin-[2Fe2S] formation is ≅9-fold greater in the presence of IscU than in its absence suggesting that scaffold-mediated preassembly and transfer is more efficient than direct assembly on the ferredoxin. The final yield of holo-ferredoxin is also greater (≅100 versus ≅75%) suggesting that the scaffold-mediated process may prevent unproductive side reactions from occurring. The CD spectra at different stages of completion of the reaction are qualitatively similar and exhibit distinct isodichroic points at 333, 357, 394, and 478 nm. The occurrence of isodichroic wavelengths during the course of the reaction indicates that the IscU2-[2Fe2S] and ferredoxin-[2Fe2S] complexes are the only spectroscopically detectable species and suggests that if intermediate [FeS] species are formed during cluster transfer, they do not accumulate to a significant degree. The reaction kinetics of the IscU-mediated cluster transfer process were further investigated by varying the concentration of apo-ferredoxin. Experiments were carried out using 10–75 μm apo-ferredoxin in the absence and presence of 5.5 μm IscU, and rates of ferredoxin-[2Fe2S] formation in the presence of IscU were corrected for spontaneous formation in the absence of IscU. The results are presented in Fig. 3 in the form of a double reciprocal plot. Ferredoxin-[2Fe2S] formation in the presence of IscU exhibits Michaelis-Menten behavior suggesting formation of a complex between IscU2-[2Fe2S] and apoferredoxin with rapid association/dissociation kinetics followed by slower transfer of the [FeS] cluster. The apparent Km for the reaction is ≅27 μm suggesting a relatively weak interaction between the two proteins. The maximal turnover number extrapolated to saturating levels of apo-ferredoxin is ≅0.21 mol holo-ferredoxin/mol IscU2 min–1 indicating that cluster transfer in this system is a relatively slow process. Catalysis of Cluster Transfer by IscA—Studies were also carried out to determine whether IscA is able to catalyze multiple cluster transfer cycles. Because cluster assembly on IscA is more efficient with ferrous salts, apo-IscA and apo-ferredoxin were equilibrated with ferrous ammonium sulfate, and the reaction was initiated by addition of lithium sulfide. Fig. 4 shows a time course experiment employing a molar ratio of apo-IscA2:apo-ferredoxin of 0.1 to 1. The stimulation of the initial rate of ferredoxin-[2Fe2S] formation (≅4-fold) is not as great as that observed with IscU, but enhancement continues throughout the reaction consistent with IscA mediating multiple catalytic cycles. The final yield (18 h) of holo-ferredoxin in the presence of IscA is also greater than in its absence (≅80 versus ≅65%) suggesting that the scaffold-mediated process is somewhat more effective. As found for IscU, the CD spectra at intermediate stages exhibit distinct isodichroic points (335, 392, and 478 nm) indicating that IscA2-[2Fe2S] and ferredoxin-[2Fe2S] are the only detectable chromophoric species. The kinetics of IscA-mediated cluster transfer were further investigated using 10–75 μm apo-ferredoxin in the absence and presence of 5.5 μm IscA, and rates were corrected for spontaneous ferredoxin-[2Fe2S] formation. Fig. 5 shows that IscA-mediated ferredoxin-[2Fe2S] formation exhibits Michaelis-Menten behavior indicative of formation of an IscA2-[2Fe2S]·apo-ferredoxin complex with fast kinetics followed by slower cluster transfer. The apparent Km observed (≅210 μm) suggests a weaker interaction between IscA-[2Fe2S] and apo-ferredoxin than that for IscU2-[2Fe2S] (Km ≅ 27 μm). In addition, the maximal extrapolated turnover number (≅0.03 min–1) is ∼7-fold slower than that observed with IscU2-[2Fe2S] (≅0.2 min–1) indicating that IscA is a less effective catalyst for cluster transfer to apo-ferredoxin. The lower affinity and poorer catalysis are consistent with the finding that the final yield obtained with IscA (≅75%, Fig. 4) is less than that obtained with IscU (≅100%, Fig. 2). Additional studies with other apo-protein acceptors will be required to determine whether the reduced effectiveness of IscA compared with IscU reflects a fundamental difference in the mechanism of cluster transfer by IscA and IscU or results from differences in their specific apo-protein acceptor preferences. There is some indication that IscA2-[2Fe2S] may be more stable than IscU2-[2Fe2S], and this could contribute to differences in rates of cluster transfer. In vitro studies have shown that clusters on IscU2-[2Fe2S] can be transferred to apo-IscA, whereas IscA2-[2Fe2S] will not transfer its cluster to apo-IscU (19Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Sanakis Y. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2004; 9: 828-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, the exact cellular role of IscA has not been established. In addition to forming [FeS] complexes, IscA binds iron and may play a role in iron delivery to IscU for cluster assembly rather than as an alternate [FeS]-scaffold protein (27Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 28Ding H. Clark R.J. Ding B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37499-37504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Effect of Scaffold Concentration—Additional cluster transfer experiments were carried out using molar ratios of apo-IscU and apo-IscA to apo-ferredoxin ranging from 0.05:1 to 1.2:1. An analysis of the results in terms of the observed specific activity (mol holo-ferredoxin/mol scaffold/min) versus the ratio of IscU2 or IscA2 to apo-ferredoxin is presented in Fig. 6. Surprisingly, the specific activities observed with both IscA and IscU were found to vary with the scaffold:apo-ferredoxin ratio. Higher specific activities were observed at lower ratios, and the specific activity increased >10-fold as the ratio of scaffold:acceptor decreased from about 1:1 to less than 0.1:1. Reliable rate measurements at low IscA2:apo-ferredoxin ratios could not be obtained, but the higher activity of IscU made it possible to determine rates at IscU2:apo-ferredoxin ratios as low as 0.05:1. The increased activity of IscU at low ratios is especially evident at IscU2:apo-ferredoxin ratios lower than 0.3:1. Specific activities increased ∼20-fold from ≅0.01 to ≅0.2 mol holo-ferredoxin/mol IscU2/min as the scaffold:acceptor ratio decreased from 1:1 to 0.05:1. The specific activities observed using these low amounts of apo-IscU are also greater than those reported for transfer of preformed clusters in other systems. Table I gives a comparison of the specific activities observed in our multiple turnover assays with specific activities calculated from rates of transfer from preformed Isu and Isa complexes reported by others. The specific activity using a low ratio of apo-IscU is 10–30-fold higher than single-transfer reactions using preformed Isu-[FeS] complexes. IscA is less effective than IscU, and the specific activities we observed in multiple turnover reactions differed only slightly from the single-cluster transfer activities using preformed Isa-[FeS] clusters.Table IRates of [FeS] cluster transfer from scaffold proteins to apoprotein acceptorsScaffoldAcceptorScaffold:acceptor ratioaThe scaffold:acceptor ratio is calculated assuming that scaffold proteins function as dimeric complexes containing a single [2Fe2S] cluster.Specific activitybkobs/scaffold:acceptor ratio.Referencemol/mol × min-1IscU (E. coli)Fdx (E. coli)0.05:10.2This workcApo-IscU2 or apo-IscA2 were used to mediate cluster assembly.IscU (E. coli)Fdx (E. coli)1:10.01This workcApo-IscU2 or apo-IscA2 were used to mediate cluster assembly.Isu (human)Fdx (human)5.2:10.01715Wu S.

Open table in a new tab The basis for the observed enhanced cluster transfer at low scaffold-to-acceptor ratios is not known. One explanation is that cluster transfer may involve a labile scaffold-[FeS] species that is transiently formed during initial cluster assembly, and high levels of apo-protein acceptor may favor capture and transfer of this species prior to its maturation to a more stable scaffold-[2Fe2S] complex. A more labile species may also be favored at low scaffold concentrations. The reactive scaffold-[FeS] species may differ from the mature complex in the structure of the [FeS] cluster and/or the structure of the scaffold protein. Transient [FeS] complexes having different nuclearity have been described for both IscU (8Agar J.N. Krebs C. Frazzon J. Huynh B.H. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) and IscA (10Krebs C. Agar J.N. Smith A.D. Frazzon J. Dean D.R. Huynh B.H. Johnson M.K.

Vickery, unpublished data. indicate presence of significant dynamic flexibility in the protein backbone, and a specific IscU2-[2Fe2S] species with a conformation that differs from the major component could be involved in interactions with acceptor proteins and in cluster transfer. Cellular Mechanism of Cluster Transfer—The maximal rates of scaffold-mediated cluster transfers observed in the in vitro experiments reported to date are slow (<1 min–1), and participation of additional cellular components may be required to achieve efficient cluster transfer in vivo. Molecular chaperones have been implicated in iron-sulfur protein biosynthesis (cf. Refs. 1Frazzon J. Dean D.R. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 2Mansy S.S. Cowan J.A. Acc. Chem. Res. 2004; 37: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 3Lill R. Mühlenhoff U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 133-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), and these could play a role in generating or stabilizing reactive scaffold-[FeS] species and thereby facilitate cluster transfer. Recently a report appeared describing studies on the effect of the heat shock chaperone DnaK from T. maritima on transfer of preformed [FeS] complexes of T. maritima IscU or human Isu to human ferredoxin (31Wu S.P. Mansy S.S. Cowan J.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4284-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The results from that study suggested that DnaK has only a minor influence on scaffold-[FeS] stability or transfer, and nucleotides and the co-chaperone DnaJ did not elicit effects expected for a specific, chaperone-assisted system (31Wu S.P. Mansy S.S. Cowan J.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4284-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Other bacteria and eukaryotes, however, have specialized chaperone/co-chaperone systems that display specific interactions with IscU/Isu homologs (32Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl.

https://openalex.org/W2155330074,"The RAG1 and RAG2 proteins catalyze V(D)J recombination and are essential for generation of the diverse repertoire of antigen receptor genes and effective immune responses. RAG2 is composed of a “core” domain that is required for the recombination reaction and a C-terminal nonessential or “non-core” region. Recent evidence has emerged arguing that the non-core region plays a critical regulatory role in the recombination reaction, and mutations in this region have been identified in patients with immunodeficiencies. Here we present the first structural data for the RAG2 protein, using NMR spectroscopy to demonstrate that the C terminus of RAG2 contains a noncanonical PHD finger. All of the non-core mutations of RAG2 that are implicated in the development of immunodeficiencies are located within the PHD finger, at either zinc-coordinating residues or residues adjacent to an α-helix on the surface of the domain that participates in binding to the signaling molecules, phosphoinositides. Functional analysis of disease and phosphoinositide-binding mutations reveals novel intramolecular interactions within the non-core region and suggests that the PHD finger adopts two distinct states. We propose a model in which the equilibrium between these states modulates recombination activity. Together, these data identify the PHD finger as a novel and functionally important domain of RAG2.

We propose a model in which the equilibrium between these states modulates recombination activity. Together, these data identify the PHD finger as a novel and functionally important domain of RAG2. During immune system development, immunoglobulin and T cell receptor genes are assembled from their component gene segments. This process, called V(D)J recombination, is initiated by the lymphoid-specific recombination activating genes 1 and 2 (RAG1 and RAG2) (1.Schatz D.G. Oettinger M.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 59: 1035-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 2.Oettinger M.A. Schatz D.G. Gorka C. Baltimore D. Science. 1990; 248: 1517-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). The RAG proteins recognize and bind recombination signal sequences flanking each coding segment and introduce double-strand DNA breaks, which are subsequently resolved into coding joints and signal joints. Processing and joining of the ends require the activity of the ubiquitously expressed proteins from the nonhomologous end joining pathway of DNA repair (reviewed in Ref. 3.Gellert M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). V(D)J recombination is critical for proper immune system function; accordingly, mutations in the RAG or nonhomologous end joining proteins result in immunodeficiencies, and inappropriate RAG activity can lead to genomic instability and cancer (4.Jung D. Alt F.W. Cell. 2004; 116: 299-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 5.O'Driscoll M. Jeggo P. Mutat. Res. 2002; 509: 109-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). RAG2 can be divided into two functionally defined regions, an N-terminal “core” domain (amino acids 1-383) and a C-terminal “non-core” domain (amino acids 384-527) (see Fig. 1A). The core domain is necessary and sufficient for carrying out V(D)J recombination in vivo on exogenous plasmid substrates (6.Sadofsky M.J. Hesse J.E. Gellert M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1805-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 7.Cuomo C.A. Oettinger M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1810-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), as well as V(D)J cleavage in vitro (8.McBlane J.F. van Gent D.C. Ramsden D.A. Romeo C. Cuomo C.A. Gellert M. Oettinger M.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 387-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The non-core domain is dispensable for activity in both of these assays; however, its high conservation throughout evolution suggests it serves critical functions. Indeed, replacement of the endogenous RAG2 gene with only the core domain results in impaired development of B and T cells in mice (9.Liang H.-E. Hsu L.-Y. Cado D. Cowell L.G. Kelsoe G.

Moreover, recent studies have implicated the C terminus of RAG2 in the restriction of RAG1/2-mediated transposition (11.Elkin S.K. Matthews A.G. Oettinger M.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1931-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12.Tsai C.L. Schatz D.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1922-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 13.Swanson P.C.

Finally, mutations within the RAG2 C terminus are linked to the pathogenesis of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) 1The abbreviations used are: SCID, severe combined immunodeficiency; OS, Omenn syndrome; PtdIns, phosphoinositides; WT, wild type; aa, amino acids; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; IPs, inositol polyphosphates; PIP, phosphatidylinositol phosphate; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. 1The abbreviations used are: SCID, severe combined immunodeficiency; OS, Omenn syndrome; PtdIns, phosphoinositides; WT, wild type; aa, amino acids; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; IPs, inositol polyphosphates; PIP, phosphatidylinositol phosphate; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. and Omenn syndrome (OS) (15.Schwarz K.

Langerak A.W. van Gent D.C. van Dongen J.J. Blood. 2002; 100: 2145-2152PubMed Google Scholar). Two specific activities encoded within the non-core domain have been identified, a nuclear localization signal and a degradation signal (19.Corneo B. Benmerah A. Villartay J.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 2068-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 20.Ross A.E. Vuica M. Desiderio S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5308-5319Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the amino acids mutated in SCID and OS do not overlap with the nuclear localization signal or degradation signals. Rather, these mutations are found within a region of the C terminus of RAG2 that was predicted by its primary amino acid sequence to be a PHD finger-like motif (21.Callebaut I. Mornon J.P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 880-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), although protein-motif predicting programs such as Pfam and Swiss-Prot do not detect a PHD finger within this region under low stringencies (data not shown). The PHD finger motif is present throughout eukaryotic proteomes, most often on chromatin-associated proteins (22.Sutherland H.G. Mumford G.K. Newton K. Ford L.V. Farrall R. Dellaire G. Caceres J.F. Bickmore W.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1995-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Structurally, the PHD finger, like the related FYVE and RING finger modules, belongs to the treble class of zinc-binding domains (23.Pascual J. Martinez-Yamout M. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 24.Capili A.D. Schultz D.C. Rauscher I.F. Borden K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The FYVE finger is a well characterized PtdInsP-binding module, and RING fingers function as components of E3 ubiquitin ligase enzymes (reviewed in Refs. 25.Stenmark H. Aasland R. Driscoll P.C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar and 26.Fang S. Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Both of these functions have been reported for PHD fingers from different proteins (27.Coscoy L. Ganem D. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 7-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 28.Gozani O. Karuman P. Jones D.R. Ivanov D. Cha J. Lugovskoy A.A. Baird C.L. Zhu H. Field S.J.

Cell. 2003; 114: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), although recent analyses argue that PHD fingers with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity are more likely to be RING finger variants (29.Aravind L. Iyer L.M. Koonin E.V. Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 30.Scheel H. Hofmann K. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 285-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, two recent studies (31.Ragvin A. Valvatne H. Erdal S. Arskog V. Tufteland K.R.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4029-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) describe PHD finger interactions with nucleosomes. Structural information about the RAG proteins has long been sought, in hope that it would lend insight into the biochemistry and regulation of V(D)J recombination. In this study, we present the first structural data for the RAG2 protein, demonstrating that the C terminus of RAG2 contains a noncanonical PHD finger. We find that this module directly interacts with PtdInsPs, and mutations that disrupt this binding or cause immunodeficiency can be shown to alter the recombination activity of RAG2. Thus, we identify the PHD finger as a novel and functionally important domain of RAG2. NMR Studies and Homology Modeling—Murine Rag2 protein (residues 414-487) in buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 50 μm ZnSO4, 13 mm β-mercaptoethanol) was used for the NMR studies. Three pairs of triple resonance experiments HNCA/HN(CO)CA, HN(CA)CB/HN(COCA)CB, HNCO/HN(CA)CO were collected by using uniformly 15N-, 13C-, and 2H-labeled protein. The backbone assignments were obtained with the automatic assignment program Ibis (33.Hyberts S.G. Wagner G. J. Biomol. NMR. 2003; 26: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and side chain assignments with HC(C)H, H(CCO)NH, and C(CO)NH Tocsy experiments. Virtually complete backbone and side chain assignments were achieved. Distance restraints for structure calculations were obtained from 15N NOESY-HSQC, 13C NOESY-HSQC, and two-dimensional NOESY experiments. NMR data were processed with NMRPipe (34.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11533) Google Scholar) and spectral analysis and assignments with Xeasy. Initial structures were obtained using the molecular structure and molecular dynamics package DYANA (35.Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol.

Zinc atoms and additional distance and angle constraints were incorporated at this stage to maintain the canonical tetrahedral geometry of the metal sites. Recombinant Protein Expression—GST fusion proteins were purified as described previously (28.Gozani O. Karuman P. Jones D.R. Ivanov D. Cha J. Lugovskoy A.A. Baird C.L. Zhu H. Field S.J. Lessnick S.L.

Full-length RAG2 and all RAG2 derivatives were cloned into p3xFLAG-CMV vector (Sigma), expressed in 293T cells, and dialyzed overnight into storage buffer (150 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol). In vitro translation of proteins was carried out per the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). PtdInsP Binding Assays—Protein-lipid blots and PtdInsP affinity resin pull-downs were performed as described (28.Gozani O. Karuman P. Jones D.R. Ivanov D. Cha J. Lugovskoy A.A. Baird C.L. Zhu H.

Liposome pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of binding buffer and then centrifuged. This step was repeated three times, and the bound and flow-through samples (at a relative ratio of 3:1) were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and GST fusion proteins were detected by Western analysis using anti-GST antibody (Amersham Biosciences).

RAG2 and derivatives were transiently expressed using the p3xFLAG-CMV vector (Sigma). Expression of all proteins was confirmed by Western analysis with anti-FLAG antibody of FLAG-IPs (Sigma). FLAG-tagged RAG2 and derivatives (purified three times) were used for in vitro cleavage and transposition assays as described previously (11.Elkin S.K. Matthews A.G. Oettinger M.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1931-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Solution Structure of the RAG2 C Terminus Reveals the Presence of a PHD Finger Module—To determine directly whether the RAG2 non-core region contains a zinc finger module, the structure of RAG2 from amino acids 414 to 487 (Fig. 1A) was solved using solution NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 1B; structural statistics are shown in Table I). The protein construct encompasses an independently folded protein domain, and the spectral changes induced by EDTA treatment indicate that zinc is required for proper folding and structural stability of the domain (data not shown).Table INMR structure determination statisticsStructured residuesaResidues 415-482 of RAG2. r.m.s.d. indicates root mean square deviation.

All values were based on the ensemble of 20 lowest energy structures. Open table in a new tab To identify experimentally the zinc-ligating residues, initial structure calculations were performed with no assumptions made about zinc coordination. The NOE contacts and the Cβ chemical shifts were sufficient to unambiguously identify Cys-419, Cys-423, Cys-446, Cys-458, and Cys-478 as zinc-coordinating residues (Fig. 1B; Table I). In the RAG2 sequence, cysteines are not positioned to occupy the 4th, 5th, and 8th zinc-binding position, but a number of histidine residues are appropriately located to be reasonable candidates (21.Callebaut I. Mornon J.P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 880-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Using 15N HSQC analysis of the histidine side chain signals in combination with 111Cd metal substitution, we identified His-452, His-455, and His-481 as zinc-coordinating residues (supplemental Fig. 1). Thus, overall, two zinc ions are bound in the RAG2 C-terminal zinc finger by residues Cys-419, Cys-423, Cys-446, His-452(N-ϵ2), His-455(N-δ1), Cys-458, Cys-478, and His-481(N-δ1) in the characteristic interleaved topology that is shared by PHD, RING, and FYVE finger modules (Fig. 1B and Fig. 2B). The 111Cd substitution experiments revealed that Zn1 is easily substituted during EDTA treatment, whereas Zn2 substitution requires longer EDTA treatment and higher temperatures, indicating that the RAG2 zinc finger has higher affinity for Zn2 than Zn1 (supplemental Fig. 1). Notably, mutations in the Zn2-coordinating residues, Cys-478 and His-481, are found in SCID, suggesting that zinc coordination and integrity of the PHD finger fold is critical for the function of RAG2 (Fig. 1A) (17.Villa A. Sobacchi C. Notarangelo L.D. Bozzi F. Abinun M. Abrahamsen T.G. Arkwright P.D. Baniyash M. Brooks E.G. Conley M.E. Cortes P. Duse M. Fasth A. Filipovich A.M. Infante A.J. Jones A. Mazzolari E.

Blood. 2001; 97: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). PHD, FYVE, and RING finger modules all contain two zinc ions separated by ∼14 Å with two strands of distorted β-sheet connecting the two metal centers (Fig. 2) (23.Pascual J. Martinez-Yamout M. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 41.Misra S. Hurley J.H.

The C-terminal zinc finger of RAG2 has the same topology and clearly belongs in the same structural class. The hydrophobic core and metal coordination geometry in the RAG2 structure contains the characteristic features of the PHD finger module, despite the differences in specific zinc-coordinating residues (Fig. 2A). First, as in other PHD fingers, a histidine ligand of Zn1 (His-455) forms part of the hydrophobic core of the protein (Fig. 1B). This is confirmed by the slow exchange of the H-ϵ2 proton, which makes it visible in 15N HSQC spectra, and numerous NOE contacts of the histidine side chain with other core residues (data not shown). In addition, the coordination of the second zinc is structurally similar to that of other PHD fingers, with two zinc-binding residues (Fig. 2B, C446 and H452) located on both sides of the β-turn (23.Pascual J. Martinez-Yamout M. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 24.Capili A.D. Schultz D.C. Rauscher I.F. Borden K.L.

Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 803-813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to RING fingers, as those residues are shifted toward the second β-strand (43.Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Finally, the site of the third distorted β-strand C-terminal to the last zinc-binding residues typical of RING fingers is obstructed in RAG2 by the loop between the third and fourth zinc-binding pairs, again similar to what is observed for other PHD finger structures (Fig. 2B). We note that the L1 segment of RAG2 is considerably longer than the L1 segments of other known PHD finger structures (Fig. 2). The L2 segment of the RAG2 zinc finger contains an α-helix (Fig. 2B) which, although not a common feature of PHD fingers, has been observed in a number of PHD finger structures recently deposited in the Protein Data Bank (codes 1WE9, 1WEM, 1WEP, and 1WEV). The packing of this helix is distinct from the packing of the correspondingly located helix in RING fingers (Fig. 2B). Based on these data and consistent with predictions of the primary sequence (21.Callebaut I. Mornon J.P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 880-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we conclude that the zinc finger contained within the RAG2 C terminus is a noncanonical PHD finger. The RAG2 C Terminus Interacts with PtdInsPs—Two functions associated with PHD fingers are PtdInsP binding and E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (27.Coscoy L. Ganem D. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 7-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 28.Gozani O. Karuman P. Jones D.R. Ivanov D. Cha J. Lugovskoy A.A. Baird C.L. Zhu H. Field S.J. Lessnick S.L. Villasenor J. Mehrotra B. Chen J. Rao V.R. Brugge J.S. Ferguson C.G. Payrastre B. Myszka D.G. Cantley L.C. Wagner G. Divecha N. Prestwich G.D. Yuan J. Cell. 2003; 114: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). We have not detected the latter activity for RAG2 (data not shown). To test if RAG2 binds PtdInsPs, protein-lipid blot assays (Fig. 3A) were carried out using in vitro translated full-length RAG2 and core RAG2 (named Core, aa 1-383), which lacks the PHD finger (Fig. 1A). Full-length RAG2, but not Core, bound to the phosphorylated PtdInsP species (Fig. 3B). Similarly, in an independent assay, in vitro translated RAG2, but not Core, bound to PtdInsP-coupled affinity resins (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that RAG2 can bind to PtdInsPs and that the non-core region of RAG2 is required for this activity. To test directly whether the non-core region binds PtdInsPs, GST-RAG2 C-terminal fusion proteins were assayed for PtdInsP binding in lipid blot (Fig. 3D) or liposome pull-down (Fig. 3E (45.Ferguson C.G. James R.D. Bigman C.S. Sheppard D.A. Abdiche Y. David G.M. Prestwich G.D. Submitted. 2005; Google Scholar)) assays. A C-terminal RAG2 construct containing the PHD finger and a downstream cluster of positively charged residues (RAG2-PHD-CT, aa 414-527) bound PtdInsPs robustly in both assays (Fig. 3, D and E). RAG2-PHD-CT protein bound most strongly to bis-phosphorylated PtdInsPs in the lipid blot overlay assay (Fig. 3D) and to PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the liposome pull-down assay (Fig. 3E). This binding profile is distinct from other PHD fingers tested to date, which characteristically bind preferentially to mono-phosphorylated PtdInsPs (Fig. 3, D and E) (28.Gozani O. Karuman P. Jones D.R. Ivanov D. Cha J. Lugovskoy A.A. Baird C.L. Zhu H. Field S.J. Lessnick S.L. Villasenor J. Mehrotra B. Chen J. Rao V.R. Brugge J.S. Ferguson C.G. Payrastre B. Myszka D.G. Cantley L.C. Wagner G. Divecha N. Prestwich G.D. Yuan J. Cell. 2003; 114: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Notably, chelation of zinc by EDTA, which disrupts the structure of the RAG2 PHD finger, eliminated PtdInsP binding (Fig. 3D). Unfortunately, the RAG2-PHD-CT aggregates at high protein concentrations, making it unsuitable for NMR structural studies. The RAG2 PHD finger domain alone (RAG2-PHD, aa 414-487), which was used in the structural studies, did not bind to PtdInsPs, and the C-terminal region alone (RAG2-CT, aa 488-527) bound weakly (Fig. 3D). Thus, RAG2-PHD-CT, encompassing both the PHD finger and the C-terminal basic patch, is necessary and sufficient for efficient PtdInsP binding. Structural Model of RAG2 PHD Finger-PtdInsP Interactions—To gain insight into the structural basis of PtdInsP-RAG2-PHD-CT interactions, the structure of the RAG2 PHD finger was superimposed onto the known structure of the FYVE finger-PtdIns(3)P complex (Fig. 4A) (46.Kutateladze T. Overduin M. Science. 2001; 291: 1793-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed that a molecular surface of the RAG2 PHD finger, consisting of the L2 α-helix and largely formed by the segment of the polypeptide chain between residues 462 and 474, aligns with the PtdInsP-binding surface of the FYVE finger (Fig. 4A). Considering the importance of positive charge for binding to the acidic head group of PtdInsPs (47.DiNitto J.P. Cronin T.C. Lambright D.G. Sci. STKE 2003. 2003; : RE16Google Scholar), two residues within this region of RAG2, Arg-464 and His-468, are probable participants in PtdInsP recognition (Fig. 4B). Moreover, residues mutated in patients with OS and SCID (Trp-453 and Asn-474, respectively) are adjacently located and predicted to affect this surface area (Fig. 4B). An analogous segment in the ING2 PHD finger contains a basic patch formed by three lysine residues that are necessary for efficient PtdInsP binding by ING2 as well as its pro-apoptotic activity (Fig. 4C) (28.Gozani O. Karuman P. Jones D.R. Ivanov D. Cha J. Lugovskoy A.A. Baird C.L. Zhu H. Field S.J. Lessnick S.L. Villasenor J. Mehrotra B. Chen J. Rao V.R. Brugge J.S. Ferguson C.G. Payrastre B. Myszka D.G. Cantley L.C. Wagner G. Divecha N. Prestwich G.D. Yuan J. Cell. 2003; 114: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Notably, the contacts formed by this surface alone, however, are not sufficient for PtdInsP binding for either RAG2 or ING2, as both absolutely require residues located C-terminal to the core PHD finger structure (Fig. 4C and see Fig. 3D). Thus, it is likely that the structural basis of RAG2 PHD finger interactions with PtdInsPs is mechanistically analogous to that of other PHD finger proteins. Functional Analysis of the RAG2 PHD Finger—Although most of the mutations that lead to SCID and OS have been mapped to the core regions of RAG1 and RAG2, several mutations are found within the PHD finger of RAG2 (Fig. 4B), suggesting that integrity of this domain might be critical for normal RAG2 function. To test this hypothesis, a structure-based mutational analysis was carried out to identify PHD finger mutants defective for PtdInsP binding, and the ability of these mutants to execute recombination in vivo was determined. First, to quantify the relative affinity of RAG2 PHD finger derivatives for PtdInsPs, protein-lipid blot overlays were carried out using lipid blots containing serial dilutions of PtdIns(4,5)P2. As shown in Fig. 5A, at as little as 2.5 pmol, wild-type RAG2-PHD-CT an"

IL-1β induced expression and transient phosphorylation of c-Jun in primary cultured chondrocytes. Ectopic expression of c-Jun was sufficient to cause dedifferentiation, whereas expression of dominant negative c-Jun blocked IL-1β-induced dedifferentiation. Interestingly, modulation of c-Jun expression did not affect IL-1β-induced COX-2 expression. Further experiments revealed that c-Jun phosphorylation was mediated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase and was required for IL-1β-induced dedifferentiation but not COX-2 expression. Consistent with its ability to induce phosphorylation of c-Jun, IL-1β caused transient activation of AP-1, which is necessary for IL-1β-induced dedifferentiation. IL-1β treatment suppressed expression of Sox-9, a major transcription factor that regulates type II collagen expression. Inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase or AP-1 reversed IL-1β-induced suppression of Sox-9, and ectopic expression of c-Jun was sufficient to cause suppression of Sox-9. Our results collectively suggest that IL-1β suppresses type II collagen expression in articular chondrocytes by inducing expression and phosphorylation of c-Jun, AP-1 activation, and subsequent suppression of Sox-9.

The development of cartilage, which serves as a template for long bone formation, is initiated by the differentiation of mesenchymal cells into chondrocytes (1DeLise A.M. Fisher L. Tuan R.S. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2000; 8: 309-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). During the process of differentiation, chondrocytes receive and process a complex array of signals from local and systemic factors. One such factor is the transcription factor, activator protein-1 (AP-1), 1The abbreviations used are: AP-1, activator protein-1; COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; IL-1β, interleukin-1β; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; NAC, N-acetyl-l-cysteine; NDGA, nordihydroguaiaretic acid; RA, retinoic acid; RT, reverse transcription; pc-Jun, phosphorylated c-Jun. which has an essential function in cartilage and bone development (2Jochum W. Passegue E. Wagner E. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2401-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). AP-1 is a dimeric transcription factor formed by combinations of Jun (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD), Fos (c-Fos, Fra-1, Fra-2, and FosB), and ATF proteins (ATF-2 and ATF-3) and is involved in diverse biological processes such as differentiation, proliferation, cell survival, and transformation (3Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3279) Google Scholar, 4Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2324) Google Scholar). The various subunits of AP-1 can be induced at sites of active bone formation in vivo by transforming growth factor-β, parathyroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D, and other factors (5Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3037-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that AP-1 regulates cartilage and bone development. For example, AP-1 activation mediates Wnt regulation of chondrogenesis (6Tufan A.C. Daumer K.M. DeLise A.M. Tuan R.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 273: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and regulates hypertrophic maturation of chondrocytes (7Moritani N.H. Kubota S. Eguchi T. Fukunaga T. Yamashiro T. Takano-Yamamoto T. Tahara H. Ohyama K. Sugahara T. Takigawa M. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 2003; 21: 205-210PubMed Google Scholar). Among the components of AP-1, JunB plays a crucial role in endochondral ossification by regulating the proliferation and function of chondrocytes and osteoblasts (8Hess J. Hartenstein B. Teurich S. Schmidt D. Schorpp-Kistner M. Angel P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4587-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It has been shown that c-Jun mediates axial skeletogenesis by regulating notochord survival and intervertebral disc formation (9Behrens A. Haigh J. Mechta-Grigoriou F. Nagy A. Yaniv M. Wagner E.F. Development. 2003; 130: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Overexpression of c-Fos in ATDC5 cells inhibits chondrocyte differentiation in vitro (10Thomas D.P. Sunters A. Gentry A. Grigoriadis A.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 439-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of Fos in developing chicken limb buds by retroviral microinjection causes truncation of the cartilage in the long bones of the injected leg; this is due to chondrodysplasia caused by severely retarded differentiation of the proliferating chondrocytes into mature chondrocytes, hypertrophy of chondrocytes, and delays in precartilagenous condensation (11Watanabe H. Saitoh K. Kameda T. Murakami M. Niikura Y. Okazaki S. Morishita Y. Mori S. Yokouchi Y. Kuroiwa A. Iba H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3994-3999Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). AP-1 also plays an essential role in the regulation of chondrocyte differentiation by parathyroid hormone-related protein through induction of c-Fos protein expression (12Ionescu A.M. Schwarz E.M. Vinson C. Puzas J.E. Rosier R. Reynolds P.R. O'Keefe R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11639-11647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Genetic studies in mice have provided compelling evidence for the role of AP-1 family members in skeletal development in vivo. For example, transgenic mice overexpressing c-Fos develop chondro- and osteosarcomatous lesions (13Grigoriadis A.E. Schellander K. Wang Z.Q. Wagner E.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 685-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 14Wang Z.Q. Grigoriadis A.E. Mohle-Steinlein U. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2437-2450Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), whereas knock-out of c-Fos in mice causes osteopetrosis due to an early block of differentiation in the osteoclast lineage (15Grigoriadis A.E. Wang Z.Q. Cecchini M.G. Hofstetter W. Felix R. Fleisch H.A. Wagner E.F. Science. 1994; 266: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 16Jacenko O. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Another AP-1 family member, ATF-2, also contributes to endochondral ossification; chondrocyte proliferation is reduced in ATF-2-deficient mice, leading to dwarfism and skeletal deformities (17Reimold A.M. Grusby M.J. Kosaras B. Fries J.W. Mori R. Maniwa S. Clauss I.M. Collins T. Sidman R.L. Glimcher M.J. Glimcher L.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Additionally, ectopic expression of Jun family members has been shown to perturb chondrocyte maturation (18Kameda T. Watanabe H. Iba H. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 495-503PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the regulation of chondrocyte differentiation and cartilage development, it has been suggested that AP-1 may regulate destruction of arthritic cartilage. Arthritis is associated with perturbation of chondrocyte homeostasis and is characterized by loss of the differentiated phenotype (dedifferentiation), apoptotic cell death, stimulation of matrix metalloproteinases, and inflammation (19Sandell L.J. Aigner T. Arthritis Res. 2001; 3: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Interleukin (IL)-1β which is produced by chondrocytes, synovial fibroblasts, and inflammatory cells, is a major catabolic pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in cartilage destruction (20Martel-Pelletier J. Alaaeddine N. Pelletier J.P. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: 694-703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-1 β causes chondrocyte dedifferentiation by suppressing cartilage-specific type II collagen and the onset of fibroblastic type I collagen expression. IL-1 β also induces expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, a critical pro-inflammatory enzyme that converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, which have been implicated in the pain and inflammation of arthritic disease (21Dubois R.N.

Inhibition of IL-1β-stimulated AP-1 down-regulates matrix metalloproteinase gene expression in articular chondrocytes (23Liacini A. Sylvester J. Li W.Q. Zafarullah M. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of c-Fos inhibits proteoglycan synthesis in articular chondrocytes (24Tsuji M. Funahashi S. Takigawa M. Seiki M. Fujii K. Yoshida T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and COX-2 expression is c-Jun-dependent in chondrocytic cells (25Abulencia J.P.

These observations together support the possibility that AP-1 is involved in cartilage destruction. Although AP-1 appears to play an essential role in chondrocyte differentiation and cartilage formation during embryonic development, the exact roles and underlying molecular mechanisms of AP-1 and its components in the maintenance of chondrocytic differentiation and cartilage homeostasis are not clearly understood. In this study we investigated the role of c-Jun and AP-1 in IL-1β-induced chondrocytic dedifferentiation and COX-2 expression. We found that increased expression of c-Jun and its phosphorylation by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) triggered activation of AP-1, leading to IL-1β-induced dedifferentiation of primary cultured articular chondrocytes. In contrast, we found that IL-1β-induced COX-2 expression was independent of c-Jun/AP-1 signaling. Culture and Treatment of Rabbit Articular Chondrocytes—Articular chondrocytes were isolated from cartilage slices of 2-week-old New Zealand White rabbits by enzymatic digestion, as previously described (26Yoon Y.-M.

Briefly, cartilage slices were enzymatically dissociated in 0.2% collagenase type II (381 units/mg solid, Sigma) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). Individual cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin. Cells were plated on culture dishes at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2. The medium was replaced every 2 days, and cells reached confluence after approximately 5 days. For experiments, 3.5-day cell cultures were treated with IL-1β, retinoic acid (RA), or epidermal growth factor (EGF) as indicated. For inhibitor studies, chemical inhibitors were added 1 h before IL-1β treatment. SP600125 (Calbiochem) was used to inhibit JNK (27Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T. Xu W. Leisten J.C. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 36-40PubMed Google Scholar) or nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) (29Haliday E.M. Ramesha C.S. Ringold G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) were used to inhibit AP-1 activity. Dedifferentiation of primary cultured chondrocytes was determined by examining the suppression of type II collagen and the onset of type I collagen expression with reverse transcription (RT)-PCR or Western blot analysis with a mouse monoclonal anti-type II collagen antibody (MAB8887, Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to determine the expression patterns of type I collagen, type II collagen, COX-2, c-Jun, and phosphorylated c-Jun (pc-Jun) in primary cultured articular chondrocytes. Briefly, primary cultured chondrocytes were fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized and blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% fetal calf serum for 30 min. Fixed cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 1 h with the following primary antibodies: mouse monoclonal anti-murine collagen-I (SP1.D8, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa), mouse monoclonal anti-chicken collagen-II (Chemicon, MAB8887), rabbit polyclonal anti-human c-Jun (sc-1694, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), mouse monoclonal anti-mouse c-Jun (J31920, BD Transduction Laboratories), mouse monoclonal anti-phosphorylated c-Jun at serine 63 (Santa Cruz, sc-822), or rabbit polyclonal anti-murine COX-2 (160106, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). The cells were washed and incubated with rhodamine- or fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibodies, washed again, and then observed under a standard fluorescence microscope. Cell nuclei were identified with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. Western Blot Analysis—Chondrocytes were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS supplemented with protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm of 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm NaF and 1 mm Na3VO4). Thirty micrograms of proteins, unless otherwise indicated, were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The following antibodies were employed to detect proteins: mouse monoclonal anti-type II collagen (Chemicon, MAB8887), mouse monoclonal anti-ERK-1/-2 (554100, BD Transduction Laboratories), mouse monoclonal antibodies against pc-Jun (Santa Cruz, sc-822) and pJNK (Santa Cruz, sc-6254), rabbit polyclonal antibodies against p300 (Santa Cruz, sc-585), c-Jun (Santa Cruz, sc-1694), and Sox-9 (Santa Cruz, sc-20095), and rabbit polyclonal anti-COX-2 (Cayman Chemical). Immunoprecipitation—Chondrocytes were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl) containing inhibitors of proteases and phosphatases as described above. After incubation on ice for 30 min, the lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. Supernatant containing 1000 μg of protein was precleared by incubating with 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h. After centrifugation, proteins in the supernatant were incubated with 2 μg of antibody against p300 (Santa Cruz, sc-585). The immune complex was precipitated by the incubating with 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing with lysis buffer, the immunocomplex was fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoprecipitated p300 and associated Sox-9 or c-Jun was detected by Western blotting. RT-PCR—Primary cultured chondrocytes were treated with IL-1β or various pharmacological agents as specified in each experiment. Total RNA was isolated using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test B, Inc., Friendswood, TX) and reverse-transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) as previously described (30Kim S.-J. Hwang S.-G. Shin D.-Y. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33501-33508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The following primers (based on the sequences of the human c-Jun and Sox-9 genes) and conditions were used for PCR: type I collagen (COL1A1) (441-bp product, annealing temperature 60 °C, 27 cycle), sense 5′-GGC TTT CCT GGA GAG AAA GG-3′ and antisense 5′-ATA GAA CCA GCA GGG CCA GG-3′; type II collagen (COL2A1) (370-bp product, annealing temperature 60 °C, 19 cycle), sense 5′-GAC CCC ATG CAG TAC ATG CG-3′ and antisense 5′-AGC CGC CAT TGA TGG TCT CC-3′; c-Jun (250-bp product, annealing temperature 55 °C, 27 cycle), sense 5′-ATG GAG TCC CAG GAG CGG ATC AA-3′ and antisense 5′-GTT TGC AAC TGC TGC GTT AG-3′; Sox-9 (386-bp product, annealing temperature 62 °C, 27 cycle), sense 5′-GCG CGT GCA GCA CAA GAA GGA CCA CCC GGA TTA CAA GTA C-3′ and antisense 5′-CGA AGG TCT CGA TGT TGG AGA TGA CGT CGC TGC TCA GCT C-3′. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was amplified for control and normalization purposes using the following primers and conditions: 299-bp product annealing temperature 50 °C, 21 cycle sense 5′-TCA CCA TCT TCC AGG AGC GA-3′ and antisense 5′-CAC AAT GCC GAA GTG GTC GT-3′. Sequencing of the PCR products for rabbit c-Jun and Sox-9 showed that these gene fragments were 92 and 93% homologous, respectively, to the corresponding human genes (data not shown). Construction of Expression Vectors and Reporter Genes—A cDNA for wild-type c-Jun was RT-PCR-amplified from ICR mouse mRNA with specific primers (sense 5′-CAG GAT CCG TTC TAT GAC TGC AAA GAT G-3′ and antisense 5′-CAG AAT TCA GCC CTG ACA GTC TGT TCT C-3′) designed to introduce BamH1 and EcoR1 restriction sequences at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the amplified fragment, respectively. The resulting cDNA was cloned into the BamH1 and EcoR1 sites of the vector, pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). Sox-9 expression vector was constructed in pcDNA3.1 vector by using RT-PCR-amplified Sox-9 cDNA from newborn mouse rib chondrocytes with specific primers (sense 5′-CGG GAT CCG CCA CCA TGA ATC TCC TGG ACC-3′ and antisense 5′-CGG AAT TCC TCA AGG TCG AGT GAG CTG T-3′). A SalI-SphI DNA fragment (about 8.23 kilobase) of the rabbit COL2A1 gene was cloned in pBluescript II phagemid vector (Stratagene). This clone contains promoter region, exon-1, intron-1, exon-2, and part of intron-2 (from -3591 to +4639). The cloned DNA fragment was digested with NaeI to produce a 3.5-kilobase fragment that contains promoter region, exon-1, and ∼60% of the first intron (from -1239 to +2260). The included intron-1 contains the enhancer element that binds to Sox-9 transcription factor (31Zhou G. Lefebvre V. Zhang Z. Eberspaecher H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14989-14997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The 3.5-kilobase COL2A1 promoter gene was inserted into the SmaI site of the pGL3-basic luciferase vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and was designated as Coll II-Pro/Enh gene. A Sox-9 reporter gene, which contains the 48-bp Sox-9 binding site in the first intron of human COL2A1 (31Zhou G. Lefebvre V. Zhang Z. Eberspaecher H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14989-14997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), was constructed by inserting a chemically synthesized 48-bp sequence into pGL3-promoter luciferase reporter vector (Promega). The reporter plasmids were sequenced to confirm the accuracy of the constructions. Transfection and Reporter Gene Assay—The expression vectors and reporter genes were transfected into articular chondrocytes (day 2.5 cultures with ∼60% confluency) by using the Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) as previously described (32Ryu J.-H. Kim S.-J. Kim S.-H. Oh C.-D. Hwang S.-G. Chun C.-H. Oh S.-H. Seong J.-K. Huh T.-L. Chun J.-S. Development. 2002; 129: 5541-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were maintained in complete medium for 48 h and used for further analysis as indicated in each experiment. For the reporter gene assay, Coll II-Pro/Enh or Sox-9 reporter genes (2 μg) were co-transfected with pCMV-β-galactosidase expression vector (0.3 μg) as an internal control of transfection efficiency with or without indicated amount of Sox-9 expression vector. After incubation of the transfected cells in complete medium for 24 h, the cells were treated with IL-1β for an additional 24 h. Luciferase activity was normalized against β-galactosidase activity. AP-1 Activity Assay—The DNA binding activity of AP-1 was determined using an AP-1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit essentially as instructed by the manufacture (Active Motif North America, Carlsbad, CA). Briefly, chondrocytes treated with various reagents as specified in each experiment were lysed in 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.9, containing 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and inhibitors of proteases as described above. After the addition of 0.6% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, the cells were incubated for 15 s on ice and then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 s at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended in the supplied nuclear lysis buffer and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Nuclear protein (10 μg) was loaded into the 96-wells of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate precoated with an oligonucleotide containing the sequence 5′-TGAGTCAG-3′ and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Mutated c-Jun oligonucleotides supplied in the kit were used as specificity controls. AP-1 binding to the nucleotide was detected with an anti-phospho-c-Jun antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody followed by colorimetric analysis. c-Jun Mediates IL-1β-induced Dedifferentiation but Not COX-2 Expression in Articular Chondrocytes—IL-1β is a major pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in cartilage destruction processes, such chondrocyte dedifferentiation and inflammatory responses. As shown in Fig. 1, RT-PCR analysis revealed that IL-1β treatment of primary cultured articular chondrocytes led to suppression of cartilage-specific type II collagen expression and induction of fibroblastic type I collagen expression (Fig. 1, A and B), two hallmarks of chondrocyte dedifferentiation. Immunofluorescence microscopy further indicated that IL-1β treatment dramatically increased the number of type I collagen-expressing cells with a concomitant decrease in type II collagen-expressing cells (Fig. 1C). Western blot analysis (Fig. 1, A and B) also revealed that IL-1β treatment induced expression of COX-2, a primary mediator of cartilage inflammation. Expressed COX-2 is localized mainly in perinuclear region (Fig. 1C), which is similar to the report by Kojima et al. (33Kojima F. Naraba H. Miyamoto S. Beppu M. Aoki H. Kawai S. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2004; 6: 355-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the accepted function of IL-1β in dedifferentiation and induction of COX-2 expression in chondrocytes. In an attempt to elucidate the role of c-Jun in IL-1β-induced dedifferentiation and COX-2 expression, we first determined the expression, phosphorylation, and subcellular localization of c-Jun in IL-1β-treated chondrocytes. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, IL-1β treatment caused transient increases in the expression levels (both transcript and protein) and phosphorylation of c-Jun in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Induction of c-Jun expression and its phosphorylation were detectable within 30 min after IL-1β treatment and peaked at 1 h. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the expressed c-Jun was localized mainly in the chondrocytic nuclei (Fig. 2C), which is consistent with its function as a component of the AP-1 transcription factor. To examine whether increased c-Jun expression was required for IL-1β-induced dedifferentiation and COX-2 expression, we induced chondrocytes to express ectopic wild-type or dominant negative c-Jun and examined the effects of IL-1β treatment in these cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, overexpression of wild-type c-Jun was associated with a reduction in type II collagen expression level but did not appear to alter COX-2 expression. Double staining for type II collagen and c-Jun in chondrocytes transfected with wild-type c-Jun indicated that cells expressing ectopic c-Jun were negative for type II collagen staining (Fig. 3B). Ectopic expression of c-Jun also potentiated the IL-1β-induced blockade of type II collagen expression (Fig. 3C). However, cells expressing ectopic c-Jun did not show induction of COX-2 expression (Fig. 3B) nor was IL-1β-induced COX-2 expression altered in these cells (Fig. 3C). The role of c-Jun was further investigated by ectopic expression of dominant negative c-Jun prior to IL-1β treatment. As shown in Fig. 4A, dominant negative c-Jun expression reduced IL-1β-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun and reversed the IL-1β-induced suppression of type II collagen expression. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that cells expressing dominant negative c-Jun expressed high levels of type II collagen (Fig. 4B, upper panel), indicating that dominant negative c-Jun blocked IL-1β-induced suppression of type II collagen expression. Consistent with the results shown in Figs. 1C and 2C, levels of COX-2 in IL-1β-treated chondrocytes were heterogeneous, and the expressed COX-2 was localized mainly in nuclear envelope. As shown in Fig. 4B, lower panel, cells overexpressing dominant negative c-Jun did not show significantly altered expression pattern of COX-2. These results collectively suggest that c-Jun expression is sufficient to cause abrogation of type II collagen expression, whereas it is not involved in the induction of COX-2 expression in articular chondrocytes.Fig. 4Ectopic expression of dominant negative c-Jun blocks IL-1β-induced dedifferentiation but not COX-2 expression in chondrocytes. A, chondrocytes transfected with empty vector or expression vector carrying dominant negative c-Jun (Δc-Jun) were cultured for 24 h and left untreated (-) or treated (+) with 5 ng/ml IL-1β for an additional 1 h or 18 h. Levels of c-Jun and pc-Jun were determined by Western blotting from 1-h samples, whereas type II collagen and COX-2 were determined from 18 h samples (upper panel). Transcript levels of type II collagen were determined by RT-PCR (lower panel). ERK and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were used as the loading control. B, chondrocytes were transfected with expression vector carrying dominant negative c-Jun (Δc-Jun) for 24 h and treated with 5 ng/ml IL-1β for an additional 18 h (IL-1β/Δc-Jun). Expression levels of total c-Jun and type II collagen (upper panel) and total c-Jun and COX-2 (lower panel) were determined by double immunostaining. Contrast was adjusted to show cells overexpressing ectopic c-Jun in total c-Jun staining. Cells were identified by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. Arrowheads in B indicate cell overexpressing Δc-Jun. The data show the results of a typical experiment from four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) c-Jun Phosphorylation by JNK and Activation of AP-1 Mediates IL-1β-induced Dedifferentiation of Chondrocytes—Having established that expression of c-Jun is necessary for IL-1β-induced dedifferentiation of chondrocytes, we next examined whether this process also requires the phosphorylation of c-Jun. We first examined the involvement of JNK in IL-1β-induced c-Jun phosphorylation, because JNK is one of the major protein kinases responsible for phosphorylating c-Jun. Western blot analysis of JNK phosphorylation (which represents JNK activation) revealed that IL-1β treatment caused a transient activation of JNK that apparently preceded the expression and phosphorylation of c-Jun (Fig. 5A). Pretreatment of cells with a JNK inhibitor (SP600125) blocked IL-1β-induced JNK activation, as evidenced by inhibition of its phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). More specifically, JNK inhibition by treatment with SP600125 did not affect IL-1β-induced c-Jun expression but dose-dependently blocked c-Jun phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). Consistent with the above results, inhibition of JNK in IL-1β-treated chondrocytes inhibited the suppression of type II collagen expression but did not affect COX-2 expression (Fig. 5B). Immunofluorescence microscopy also demonstrated that pretreatment with SP600125 blocked IL-1β-induced c-Jun phosphorylation and inhibited suppression of type II collagen expression but did not block induction of COX-2 expression (Fig. 5C). Because the above results suggest that JNK-mediated c-Jun phosphorylation is"

Here we report that mature Eag1 potassium channels carry sugar moieties linked to asparagines at positions 388 and 406. Asn-388 seems to undergo only core glycosylation, but complex sugars are bound to Asn-406. Correct complex glycosylation is required for proper trafficking of Eag1 to the plasma membrane but is also crucial for the correct function of channels already inserted in the membrane. N-Linked glycosylation is a common post-translational modification of membrane proteins. Here we report that mature Eag1 potassium channels carry sugar moieties linked to asparagines at positions 388 and 406. Asn-388 seems to undergo only core glycosylation, but complex sugars are bound to Asn-406. Correct complex glycosylation is required for proper trafficking of Eag1 to the plasma membrane but is also crucial for the correct function of channels already inserted in the membrane. Eag1 is the prototypic member of the EAG family of voltagegated potassium channels (1Warmke J.W. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3438-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Several studies have indicated a link between Eag1 and both proliferation and malignant transformation (2Ouadid-Ahidouch H. Le Bourhis X. Roudbaraki M. Toillon R.A. Delcourt P. Prevarskaya N. Recept. Channels. 2001; 7: 345-356PubMed Google Scholar, 3Pardo L.A. del Camino D. Sánchez A. Alves F. Brüggemann A. Beckh S.

Here we report on the impact of post-translational modifications upon the biological properties of the channel. N-Linked glycosylation is a common form of integral membrane protein processing that can profoundly affect protein expression, structure, and function. N-Linked oligosaccharides are assembled in a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The reactions start with the addition of simple sugars in the ER 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; ConA, concanavalin A; EndoH, endoglycosidase H; hEAG1, human EAG1; NN/QQ, N388Q, N406Q; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PNGase F, peptide-N-glycosidase F.1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; ConA, concanavalin A; EndoH, endoglycosidase H; hEAG1, human EAG1; NN/QQ, N388Q, N406Q; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PNGase F, peptide-N-glycosidase F. lumen by co-translational transfer of preassembled core glycans to a nascent polypeptide. The oligosaccharides gain complexity as proteins progress through the Golgi apparatus, resulting in complex, high-mannose, or hybrid oligosaccharides (5Burda P. Aebi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 6Spiro R.G. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 43R-56RCrossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). The single most evident function of N-linked glycosylation is the promotion of proper folding of newly synthesized polypeptides in the ER (7Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 8Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). When glycosylation is inhibited, the most commonly observed effect is the generation of misfolded, aggregated proteins that fail to reach a functional state and are subsequently degraded (7Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 8Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 9Varki A.

Carbohydrates also stabilize the mature protein (12Imperiali B. O'Connor S.E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), partly by protecting it from degradation by intracellular proteases (13Kundra R. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31039-31046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Glycosylation might also serve to enhance thermal stability (14Olsen O. Borriss R. Simon O. Thomsen K.K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 225: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) or influence the solubility of proteins as well as affect the intracellular transport and localization of the glycoprotein. Once expressed in fully mature form on the cell surface, N-linked glycans can influence functional properties like ligand binding or electrophysiological parameters (15Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1965) Google Scholar). In the particular case of voltage-gated ion channels, glycosylation may also directly influence function through the charge of the sugar moiety. In this study, we have examined the glycosylation of Kv10.1 and its impact on the functional properties of the channel. We present evidence that proper complex glycosylation at one position, at the least, is crucial for both the proper transport and the functional properties of the channels. Our results highlight the concept that glycosylation must be considered as an important post-translational modification when studying ion channel function. DNA—All clones used were derived from a pTracer/hEAG1 construct (3Pardo L.A. del Camino D. Sánchez A. Alves F. Brüggemann A. Beckh S. Stühmer W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5540-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Mutations were generated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's manual using the following primers: N26Q, 5′-GTTCGGCGGTCCCAGGATACTAATTTTG-3′; N238Q, 5′-CAGCCATCTTGGTCCCTTATCAGGTCTC-3′; N388Q, 5′-GACACCAAGACAATCCGCCAGAACAGC-3′; N406Q, 5′-CAGTTTCAGGGGTCTGGCTCAGGGAAG-3′; N470Q, 5′-CATCTTCGGGCAGGTGACGACTATTTTCC-3′; and N752Q, 5′-GCATGCCTCCGCCCAGCACAGCCTCG-3′ (only the forward primer is listed; the reverse primer had the complementary sequence). Each mutation was checked by microsequencing. To generate Eag1-N388Q, N406Q (NN/QQ), the second mutation was introduced in Eag1-N388Q. For cRNA synthesis, mutant DNA was subcloned (BamHI-SmaI) into the pSGEM vector (a generous gift from Prof. M. Hollmann, Bochum University). For immunofluorescence experiments the constructs were subcloned into pCDNA4/Myc-His B+ (Invitrogen) by PCR to avoid the green fluorescent protein fluorescence encoded by pTracer. The primers used were 5′-CGCAAATGGGCGGTAGGCGTG-3′ and 5′-GACCCTCGAGCTGGCTCCAAAAATGTCTCTCTCTGATTCTGGGG-3′. Whole inserts were sequenced to exclude any undesired mutation. Cell Culture and Transfection—CHO-K1 (American Type Culture Collection catalog number CCL-61) and Lec1 (American Type Culture Collection catalog number CRL-1735) cell lines were obtained from DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany) and grown in Ham′s F12 medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), respectively, containing 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Transfections were carried out using DAC-30 (Eurogentec) or FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Stable transfectants were selected using 1 μg/ml Zeocin (Cayla). The optimal tunicamycin concentration (2.5 μg/ml; highest concentration allowing survival of ∼80% of cells) was determined by the incubation of CHO cells in medium supplemented with decreasing concentrations of tunicamycin (10–0.3 μg/ml). CHO-hEAG1 cells were harvested, plated, and allowed to attach for several hours. Culture medium was then replaced by tunicamycin-containing (or Me2SO-containing) medium without antibiotics. After 24 h of incubation under these conditions the cells were used for further studies. Antisense experiments indicate that the half-life of the protein is <24 h in neuroblastoma cells (3Pardo L.A. del Camino D. Sánchez A. Alves F. Brüggemann A. Beckh S. Stühmer W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5540-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—5–10 μg of antibody were incubated overnight with 45 μl of protein G/A-agarose in PBS with 0.002% bovine serum albumin. Antibody-conjugated beads were washed three times with washing buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA). To obtain cell lysates, CHO cells were grown to confluency, scraped, washed three times with PBS, and lysed with non-denaturing lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants were incubated overnight with antibody-conjugated beads. Protein-antibody-bead complexes were washed three times with washing buffer and used for Western blotting or treated with endoglycosidase. Crude total cell membranes (ER, Golgi, and plasma membranes) were isolated in ice-cold hypotonic solution with protease inhibitor tabs (Roche Applied Science). Proteins denatured by heat in Laemmli sample buffer were separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5% polyacrylamide gel) and transferred to nitrocellulose filters at pH 10. Nonspecific sites were blocked for at least 30 min with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS. Membranes were incubated with anti-Eag1 primary antibody for at least 3 h (room temperature) or overnight (4 °C), washed with PBST (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS), and incubated for 1–4 h with peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody, washed, and developed using enzyme-linked chemoluminescence (ECL kit; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For differential centrifugation, cells were lysed by osmotic shock in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride supplemented with protease inhibitor tabs (Roche), homogenized 10 times through a 23-gauge needle, and finally sonicated for 5 min on ice. Proteins were stabilized by the addition of 2 m sucrose. Intact cells were removed by 10 min of centrifugation at 100 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected and further centrifuged at 1,000 (pellet P-1), 10,000 (P-10), and 100,000 × g (P-100). Pellets were resuspended in 40 μl of PBS and tested by immunoblotting. For surface expression determination, exposed proteins were biotinylated using a cell surface protein biotinylation and purification kit from Pierce. Five 50–60% confluent 16-cm plates of each cell type were incubated for 45 min at 4 °C with 1.8 mg of sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin. Biotinylated proteins were isolated on NeutrAvidin gel columns, eluted by incubation with 200 μl of 50 mm dithiothreitol in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 10 min at 95 °C, and analyzed by Western blotting. Enzymatic Deglycosylation—Prior to glycosidase digestion, proteins from whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with 20 μg of αEag1K62 antibody. Proteins were released from agarose beads by the addition of 20 μl of 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.1% SDS and incubation at 99 °C for 10 min. For the peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) digestion, 10 μl of immunoprecipitated protein was incubated overnight at 37 °C with 5 units of PNGase F in 25 μl of buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 0.8% Triton X-100). PNGase F was substituted with 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, in a control reaction. For endoglycosidase H (EndoH) digestion, 10 μl of immunoprecipitated protein was incubated overnight at 30 °C with 0.5 units of EndoH in 40 μl of buffer containing 75 mm sodium citrate (pH 5.5) and 0.05% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. EndoH was substituted by water in a control reaction. Both reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer, and products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Immunofluorescence Analysis—Transiently transfected CHO-K1 or Lec1 cells were grown on coverslips for 2–3 days following transfection. After fixation, permeabilization, and blocking (in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% bovine serum albumin, respectively), cells were incubated with the primary antibody and the fluorescently labeled secondary antibody. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342, and coverslips were mounted using the ProLong™ antifade kit and stored at 4 °C. Microscopic analysis was performed using epifluorescence or confocal microscopy. Non-transfected cells did not give any signal with anti-Eag1 antibodies, nor did transfected cells signal when incubated with only a secondary antibody (data not shown). cRNA Synthesis and Expression in Oocytes—cRNA synthesis was performed after Chomczynski and Sacchi (16Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar). When accurate cRNA quantification was required, it was performed using RiboGreen (Molecular Probes) with a ribosomal RNA standard curve. Electrophysiology—Patch clamp (17Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15119) Google Scholar) measurements were performed at room temperature using an EPC9 amplifier (Heka Electronics). We used pipettes made of aluminum silicate with a resistance of 1–3 megaohms when filled with the intracellular solution (130 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and 10 mm 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl)ester). The external solution contained 110 mm NaCl, 30 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm d-glucose, and 10 mm Hepes. Currents were activated by discrete depolarization to +60 mV from a holding potential of–80 mV, filtered at 1–3 kHz, and sampled at 5–10 kHz. Series resistance was compensated up to 60%. Leak and capacitative currents were subtracted on-line using a P/n protocol. Current densities were determined for at least five different cells. Cell capacity was determined by the automatic Cslow compensation of the amplifier. Oocyte preparation and electrophysiological recordings were performed as described elsewhere (18Stühmer W. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 353-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) Eag1 Potassium Channel Undergoes N-Linked Glycosylation—On immunoblots, a polyclonal antibody directed against the C terminus of rat Eag1 was able to specifically recognize human Eag1 expressed in CHO cells. Two distinct bands, absent in non-transfected cells, were detected in these preparations with electrophoretic mobilities corresponding to ∼110 and 130 kDa (henceforth referred to as E110 and E130). Both bands were detected in immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1A) as well as whole membrane preparations (data not shown). These results are similar to those reported previously for a different antibody (19Jeng C.-J. Chang C.-C. Tang C.Y. Neuroreport. 2005; 16: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and suggest the occurrence of post-translational modification(s). We first tested the most common modification, N-linked glycosylation. For this, we studied the effect of removal of either core or complex oligosaccharides using EndoH or PN-Gase F, respectively, on the electrophoretic mobility of immunoprecipitated Eag1. After treatment with EndoH, E110 was shifted to ∼108 kDa (Fig. 1B), whereas E130 did not show dramatic alterations in its mobility. Because EndoH cleaves only core oligosaccharides, this result indicates that E110 corresponds to a core-glycosylated glycoprotein and not to an alternatively spliced isoform (Eag1b). With this approach we could not determine whether E130 also contains core-glycosylated residues, because a small (2-kDa) change in mobility is beyond the resolution of this method. Nevertheless, we observed a slight shift of E130 compatible with this hypothesis. Removal of all sugar residues by PNGase F altered the mobility of both E130 and E110 and resulted in a single band of ≈108 kDa, indicating that both E130 and E110 contain oligosaccharides but that only E130 carries complex forms. The mobility shifts require the presence of the corresponding enzymatic activity (Fig. 1B, lanes marked with a positive sign) and are therefore unlikely because of nonspecific modifications during treatment. In the absence of enzyme (Fig. 1B, lanes marked with a negative sign), the double band pattern of native Eag1 was found unaltered. Proteolytic degradation is also unlikely, because we did not detect lower molecular mass bands. Because no complete shift of the mobility of E130 to that of a non-glycosylated protein was observed after EndoH treatment, we hypothesize that E130 represents a complex-glycosylated (and thus EndoH-resistant) and, most probably, post-ER form of Eag1. Taken together, these data indicate the existence of two distinct glycosylation isoforms of the Eag1 protein, E110 and E130. E110 is sensitive to both PNGase F and EndoH and is thus likely to represent a mannose-rich, core-glycosylated Eag1 protein, whereas E130, which is sensitive to PNGase F but insensitive to EndoH, represents a complex-glycosylated form of the Eag1 protein. In native systems (rat Eag1 isolated from brain tissue), either as total homogenates (data not shown) or as immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1C) the anti-Eag1 antibodies recognized two bands in Western blots with mobilities compatible with ∼115 and 130 kDa, similar to those determined for Eag1 expressed in CHO cells. Enzymatic deglycosylation with PNGase F also resulted in a single band of ∼108 kDa, compatible with the calculated molecular mass of the unprocessed rat Eag1. From these results, we concluded that Eag1 can undergo N-glycosylation both in heterologous and native expression systems and that two different oligosaccharides contribute with mobility shifts corresponding to ≈2–7 and ≈20 kDa to the molecular mass of the mature Eag1. Subcellular Fractionation of Glycosylated Eag1—Cell extracts were also fractionated by differential centrifugation to enable a crude distinction between large complexes and cytosolic, nuclear, or membrane-bound proteins. CHO cell lysates containing Eag1 were processed by three centrifugation steps as described under “Materials and Methods.” Pellets P-1 (1,000 × g), P-10 (10,000 × g), and P-100 (100,000 × g) were collected and studied by Western blotting (Fig. 2). To monitor the fractionation, GM-130 (a Golgi resident protein) and TRAPα (an ER integral membrane protein) were used. Both fractionated mostly within the P-1 and P-10 fractions, and both were only weakly represented in P-100 fraction, which is supposed to contain mainly plasma membrane sheets. The intensity of the band corresponding to TRAPα was strong and comparable in both P-1 and P-10 fractions, whereas the signal of GM-130 was weaker and more prominent in the P-10 fraction. As shown in Fig. 2, Eag1 glycosylation isoforms were differentially found in the analyzed fractions. Semi-quantitative densitometry analysis showed that the density of the E110 band was nearly the same in all three fractions, with a slight increase in the P-10 fraction. In contrast, the intensity of the E130 was dramatically increased in P-10 and P-100 as compared with P-1. Analysis of the percent contribution of each isoform to the total Eag1 signal in each fraction showed that in the P-1 fraction the E110 form represented a majority (67%) of the Eag1 population in the P-1 fraction, whereas E130 was the prevailing form in P-10 and P-100 (69.7 and 79.1%, respectively; Fig. 2B). These data suggest that E110 is mainly represented in the P-1 fraction, in which a strong signal of an ER marker and a medium signal of a Golgi marker were detectable. This conclusion agrees with the common observation that core-glycosylated proteins are typical for ER and early Golgi. E130 represented the majority of the Eag1 signal in the P-10 fraction (containing a majority of the Golgi and ER markers), as well as in the P-110 fraction (thought to contain plasma membrane proteins) Glycosylated Residues of the Eag1 Potassium Channel— Eag1 displays six consensus N-linked glycosylation sites NX(S/T), where X can be any amino acid except proline (20Kasturi L. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Shakineshleman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14756-14761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 21Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3762) Google Scholar) at asparagines 26, 238, 388, 406, 470, and 752. Following current structural models of voltage-gated channels (22Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Ruta V. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar, 23Guy H.R. Conti F. Trends Neurosci. 1990; 13: 201-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), two of these sites would be located in the intracellular N- and C-terminal domains (Asn-26 and Asn-752) and two in transmembrane regions (Asn-238 and Asn-470). The two remaining potential N-linked glycosylation sites, Asn-388 and Asn-406, are located in the extracellular loop between the fifth transmembrane segment and the pore-lining region H5 and are therefore prime candidates for glycosylation. We substituted each of these asparagine residues with glutamines by site-directed mutagenesis and generated stable cell lines. To minimize the effects of the specific integration site, polyclonal cell lines were used in all further studies. We determined the electrophoretic migration pattern of each mutant (Eag1-N26Q, -N238Q, -N388Q, -N406Q, -N470Q, and -N752Q) after PNGase F digestion. Mutants on residues not exposed to the extracellular environment (Asn-26, Asn-238, Asn-470, and Asn-752), which are not expected to be glycosylated, showed the typical two-band pattern (110 and 130 kDa) observed for wild type Eag1; glycosidase treatment in these mutants resulted in a single band migrating at ≈108 kDa (Fig. 3). This evidence strongly suggests that these asparagine residues are not glycosylated in CHO cells. In contrast, Eag1-N388Q and -N406Q mutants showed an altered migration pattern. Fig. 3 shows that Eag1-N388Q lacks the E110 band, whereas a single band compatible with E130 is still present. Treatment of Eag1-N388Q with PNGase F resulted in a shift of the E130 band to lower molecular mass (≈108 kDa), putatively corresponding to non-glycosylated Eag1. This result suggests that the origin of this band is the same as that of the E130 band of wild type Eag1. In Eag1-N406Q (Fig. 3), a single 110-kDa band was detectable. This band was also sensitive to PNGase F, because a slight shift in migration (to ≈108 kDa) was observed after treatment. In conclusion, of the six possible glycosylation sites in the Eag1 sequence, only the two predicted sites (Asn-388 and Asn-406) located near the putative pore region are glycosylated. Two different carbohydrate attachments seem to be located on different residues of Eag1, namely EndoH-sensitive core glycosylation at Asn-388 and EndoH-insensitive complex glycosylation at Asn-406. Double Mutation on Asn-388 and Asn-406 Abolishes Glycosylation—We then generated the double mutant Eag1-N388Q, N406Q, designated NN/QQ, lacking both glycosylation sites. As shown in Fig. 3 (lower right section), the mutant protein migrated at ∼108 kDa, corresponding to non-glycosylated Eag1. After overnight incubation with endoglycosidase, we only detected a band migrating at ∼75 kDa, suggesting proteolytic degradation of the mutant. It is therefore tempting to speculate that N-linked glycosylation increases the stability and/or protects Eag1 from degradation. To investigate the nature of the oligosaccharides attached to Eag1 and mutant proteins expressed in CHO cells, we tested the ability of the mutated proteins to bind to concanavalin A (ConA) in pull-down experiments. Both glycosylation isoforms were detectable after the precipitation of wild type Eag1 extracts with ConA (Fig. 4, lane marked wild type). As expected, ConA also pulled down a single 110-kDa band from Eag1-N406Q. However, no band was detected from cells transfected with the N388Q mutant (Fig. 4A), although the presence of Eag1 and mutant proteins in cell lysates was confirmed by Eag1 immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4, section marked Eag1 IP). These results suggest that the Eag1-N388Q mutant, like other complex-glycosylated proteins, does not contain oligosaccharides that can be recognized by ConA, i.e. α-glucose or α-d-mannose. However, Eag1-N406Q, which contains only core-oligosaccharides, is recognized by ConA. ConA did not recognize the complex oligosaccharides attached to Asn-406, but both E110 and E130 are recognized by the lectin in wild type Eag1, indicating that E130 carries oligosaccharides recognizable by ConA. Thus, only E130 is complex-glycosylated at Asn-406, but both E110 and E130 are core glycosylated at Asn-388. Intracellular Distribution and Surface Expression of Non-glycosylated Eag1—To determine the effects of N-linked glycosylation on the intracellular localization of Eag1, we studied the distribution of the protein in CHO-hEAG1 cells where N-linked glycosylation had been inhibited by tunicamycin treatment. Additionally, an Eag1-expressing cell line (Lec1hEAG1) was generated using Lec1 cells (a CHO-based, glycosylation-deficient cell line). Western blotting revealed in both cases a single band of ∼108 kDa, corresponding to the expected size of non-glycosylated Eag1. This finding supports our hypothesis about the identities of E130 and E110 and indicates an effective inhibition of N-linked glycosylation in both systems (Fig. 5, A and B). Immunofluorescence using monoclonal anti-Eag1 antibodies revealed a spotted, widespread distribution pattern with no remarkable membrane localization in untreated CHO-hEAG1 cells (Fig. 5C). The signal accumulated to perinuclear structures after tunicamycin treatment as well as in Lec1 cells expressing Eag1 (Fig. 5D). We could not find unequivocal colocalization with ER (Trapα and p53), Golgi (GM130), endosomes (Rab5 and Rab7), or lysosomal markers (cathepsin D and Limp2) (data not shown). We therefore speculate that those perinuclear structures might correspond to aggresomes (24Kopito R.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar, 25Garcia-Mata R. Gao Y.-S. Sztul E. Traffic. 2002; 3: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Eag1 wild type and mutant distribution was examined on sucrose gradients using GM-130 as a Golgi marker and calreticulin as an endoplasmic reticulum marker. The non-glycosylated Eag1 NN/QQ localized to the Golgi marker-containing fractions but had almost no colocalization with calreticulin (data not shown). Intracellular Distribution and Surface Expression of Eag1 Glycosylation Mutants—To determine whether the two distinct N-glycosylation attachments have different effects on Eag1 distribution, we studied the single and double glycosylation mutants in more detail. Indirect immunofluorescence of CHO cells transiently expressing Eag1-N388Q showed a widespread presence of the protein with a patched pattern of the signal distributed throughout the cells and their processes (Fig. 6). This pattern resembles that observed in wild type Eag1. In contrast, cells transfected with Eag1-N406Q and Eag1-NN/QQ displayed an immunofluorescence pattern strongly restricted to compact perinuclear structures, similar to those observed in tunicamycin-treated CHO-hEAG1 or in Lec1-hEAG1 cells (see Fig. 5). These results indicate that N-linked glycosylation at asparagine 406 is important for subcellular distribution of Eag1 and that mutation of this site results in proteins that are intracellularly retained. Mutation of the second glycosylation site (Asn-388) seems to have no dramatic effect on protein distribution. Surface expression of wild type and mutant channels was further assessed by biotinylation assays on CHO cells. After surface biotinylation on intact cells, labeled proteins were pulled down with streptavidin and immunoblotted. In such experiments (Fig. 6B), Eag1 was biotinylated and could be detected in the blots, whereas Eag1-N406Q was not detectable. These data indicate a dramatic reduction in the amount of protein exposed to the extracellular environment. Similar results were obtained on the double mutant Eag1-NN/QQ, whereas the single Eag1-N388Q mutant showed a similar behavior to wild type, further indicating that the critical glycosylation residue in Eag1 is Asn-406. Impact of Glycosylation on Functional Properties of Eag1—On the functional level, we analyzed the electrophysiological behavior of Eag1 channels in CHO-hEAG1 and Lec1-hEAG1 cells. Currents measured in the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique can be unequivocally attributed to channels located in the plasma membrane. The average current density (Fig. 7) was dramatically reduced both by tunicamycin treatment and in Lec1hEAG1 cells as compared with untreated CHO-hEAG1 cells. Similarly, cells expressing Eag1-NN/QQ showed a dramatic decrease in current density. This result agrees with immunofluorescent studies indicating that N-linked glycosylation is involved in the mechanism of intracellular Eag1 transport and the arrival of the channels to the cell membrane. However, the reduction in current density was not the only effect, as the remaining current was also kinetically different from that of wild type (see below). In the Xenopus oocyte expression system, injection of RNA coding for Eag1-N388Q resulted in currents quantitatively very similar to wild type, whereas RNA coding for Eag1-N406Q significantly reduced the current amplitude. This result indicates that complex glycosylation at Asn-406 is required for normal functional expression of the channel, whereas core glycosylation at position 388 has a smaller impact. We exp"

Here we analyzed the kinetic mechanism of the ATP hydrolysis cycle of acto-myosin X using a single-headed construct (M10IQ1). Myosin X was unique for the weak “strong actin binding state” (AMD) with a Kd of 1.6 μm attributed to the large dissociation rate constant (2.1 s-1). Vmax and KATPase of the actin-activated ATPase activity of M10IQ1 were 13.5 s-1 and 17.4 μm, respectively. The ATP hydrolysis rate (>100 s-1) and the phosphate release rate from acto-myosin X (>100 s-1) were much faster than the entire ATPase cycle rate and, thus, not rate-limiting. The ADP off-rate from acto-myosin X was 23 s-1, which was two times larger than the Vmax. The Pi-burst size was low (0.46 mol/mol), indicating that the equilibrium is significantly shifted toward the prehydrolysis intermediate. The steady-state ATPase rate can be explained by a combination of the unfavorable equilibrium constant of the hydrolysis step and the relatively slow ADP off-rate. The duty ratio calculated from our kinetic model, 0.6, was consistent with the duty ratio, 0.7, obtained from comparison of Km ATPase and Km motility. Our results suggest that myosin X is a high duty ratio motor.

Our results suggest that myosin X is a high duty ratio motor. Myosin is an actin-based mechanoenzymatic protein that plays a critical role in various cell motile processes. It is now clear that myosin constitutes a diverse superfamily in which at least 11 subclasses are present in mammals (1Hodge T. Cope M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3353-3354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Berg J.S. Powell B.C. Cheney R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 780-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 3Sellers J.R. Biochim.

Among them, myosin X is expressed ubiquitously in various mammalian tissues (5Yonezawa S. Kimura A. Koshiba S. Masaki S. Ono T. Hanai A. Sonta S. Kageyama T. Takahashi T. Moriyama A. Biochem.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3439-3451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based upon the deduced amino acid sequence, it is predicted that myosin X consists of a conserved motor domain, three IQ motifs that function as light chain binding sites, a coiled-coil domain, and a unique tail domain (6Berg J.S. Derfler B.H. Pennisi C.M. Corey D.P. Cheney R.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3439-3451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

It has been reported that myosin X is present at the edge of lamellipodia, membrane ruffles, and the tip of filopodia in cultured cells, suggesting that myosin X plays a role in regions where actin is in dynamic reorganization (6Berg J.S. Derfler B.H. Pennisi C.M. Corey D.P. Cheney R.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3439-3451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Myosin X associates with the cytoplasmic domain of β1-integrin at the FERM domain and translocates β1-integrin to the tip of filopodia, thus playing a role in adhesion of filopodia that helps to extend filpodia (7Zhang H. Berg J.S. Li Z. Wang Y. Lang P. Sousa A.D. Bhaskar A. Cheney R.E. Stromblad S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Myosin X also binds to Mena/VASP and moves them from the root to the tip of filopodia (8Tokuo H. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 319: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Because Ena/VASP antagonizes the ability of capping proteins to inhibit actin polymerization at the barbed ends in vitro (9Bear J.E. Svitkina T.M. Krause M. Schafer D.A. Loureiro J.J. Strasser G.A. Maly I.V. Chaga O.Y. Cooper J.A. Borisy G.G. Gertler F.B. Cell. 2002; 109: 509-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), it is thought that the distribution of Ena/VASP at specific cellular locations may regulate the elongation of actin filaments that is correlated with the change in cytoskeletal structure and cell shape. Taken together, these findings have suggested myosin X is a cargo transporter. Whereas the motor domain of myosin among the diverse superfamily members is highly conserved, it has been realized that the characteristics of the motor function varies uniquely from one to another. One of the most important issues is the processivity. Myosin Va was first identified as a processive myosin that can move on actin filaments for a long distance without dissociation (10Mehta A.D. Rock R.S. Rief M. Spudich J.A. Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Nature. 1999; 400: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 11Sakamoto T. Amitani I. Yokota E. Ando T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Clearly, the processive nature is suitable for the cargo transporting motors, and there is evidence that myosin Va transports melanosomes in melanocyte (14Rogers S.L. Karcher R.L. Roland J.T. Minin A.A. Steffen W. Gelfand V.I. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1265-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 15Wu X. Bowers B. Rao K. Wei Q. Hammer J.A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1899-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). On the other hand, conventional myosin is a typical non-processive myosin that spends the majority of time during the ATPase cycle dissociated from actin. An advantage of non-processive myosin is that many molecules can simultaneously interact with one actin filament thus producing a large force without interfering with each other. Actually, a number of myosin II molecules in a thick filament interact with an actin filament and produce a large force. For myosin X, a previous biochemical study has suggested that myosin X is not a processive motor although the duty ratio of myosin X, the fraction of time that myosin spends in a strong actin binding form, may be higher than conventional myosin based upon the surface density dependence of actin gliding velocity (16Homma K. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34348-34354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanoenzymatic characteristics of myosin X by analyzing the acto-myosin X ATPase reaction. The critical kinetic steps of the actomyosin X ATP hydrolysis mechanism were studied by various techniques, and the duty ratio was estimated. The results suggest that myosin X is a high duty ratio motor. Materials—Restriction enzymes and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNPase), 7-methylguanosine (MEG), phosphoenolpyruvate, and pyruvate kinase were obtained from Sigma.

Pyrene-actin was prepared as described (18Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). 7-Diethylamino-3-((((2-maleimidyl)ethyl)amino)carbonyl)-coumarin-labeled phosphate-binding protein (MDCC-PBP) was prepared as described (19White H.D. Belknap B. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11828-11836Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 20Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Recombinant calmodulin was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (21Ikebe M. Kambara T. Stafford W.F. Sata M. Katayama E. Ikebe R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17702-17707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Generation of the Expression Vectors for Myosin X Constructs—Bovine myosin X cDNA encoding Met1-Gln773 was subcloned into modified pFastBac1 baculovirus transfer vector containing a hexahistidine tag sequence at the 3′-end of the polylinker region as described previously (M10CC) (16Homma K. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34348-34354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). KpnI sites were created at nucleotides 2319 and 3163 of M10CC. The plasmid cDNA was digested with KpnI to excise the nucleotides 2320-3162 and ligated to produce an M10IQ1 construct encoding the entire motor domain plus one IQ domain of myosin X. Expression and Purification of Myosin X Protein—To express the recombinant M10IQ1 protein, Sf9 cells (about 4∼5 × 108 cells) were co-infected with two viruses expressing the M10IQ1 heavy chain and calmodulin. The infected cells were cultured for 3 days at 28 °C. Cells were harvested and washed with 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 mm EGTA. Cells were then lysed by sonication in 20 ml of lysis buffer (30 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor). After centrifugation at 300,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was incubated with 300 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Ni-NTA) (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in a 14-ml conical tube on a rotating wheel for 10 min at 4 °C. The resin suspension was then loaded on a column (1 × 10 cm) and washed with 10 ml of buffer A (20 mm Hepes-KOH/10 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). M10IQ1 was eluted with buffer A containing 0.2 m imidazole-HCl, pH 7.5. The M10IQ1 was dialyzed against buffer B (25 mm KCl, 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA). The purified M10IQ1 was stored on ice and used within 2 days. Typically, 1∼1.5 mg of M10IQ1/CaM was obtained. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method by employing bovine serum albumin as control, and corrected by purity of the sample determined by densitometry analysis, assuming degradation of the protein is negligible. [2,8-3H]ADP/VO4 was employed to determine the concentration of active M10IQ1. The active motor concentration was typically 70∼80% of that estimated by Bradford method followed by densitometry primarily because of overestimation of the M10IQ1 concentration using bovine serum albumin as a control with possible minor contamination of dead M10IQ1 during the purification. Gel Electrophoresis—SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out on a 7.5-20% polyacrylamide gradient slab gel using the discontinuous buffer system of Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). After staining the gel with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, the purity of the M10IQ1 preparation was determined by densitometry analysis of the SDS-PAGE gel. ATPase Assay—The steady-state ATPase activity was measured at 25 °C in the presence of 2 mm ATP with an ATP regeneration system (40 units/ml pyruvate kinase and 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate). The reaction was carried out in buffer B plus 0.2 mg/ml calmodulin at 25 °C. The liberated pyruvate was determined as described (23Reynard A.M. Hass L.F. Jacobsen D.D. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2277-2283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The error is the standard error in three different preparations. In Vitro Motility Assay—The actin gliding velocity was measured by in vitro actin gliding assay. A coverslip was first coated with nitrocellulose and coated with bovine serum albumin and penta-His monoclonal antibody (Qiagen). M10IQ1 was then applied to the coverslip. The movement of the rhodamine-labeled actin filaments was observed at 25 °C in buffer C (25 mm KCl, 25 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 143 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 36 μg/ml catalase, 4.5 mg/ml glucose, 216 μg/ml glucose oxidase, 40 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate) with various concentration of ATP. Dual-labeled F-actin was prepared as previously described (24Homma K. Yoshimura M. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Nature. 2001; 412: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The error bar shows the standard deviation of ∼100 data points obtained from movement of 5-10 different actin filaments. Actin Co-sedimentation Assay—The binding of M10IQ1 with actin in the presence of ADP was determined by employing 1 μm M10IQ1 and 5 μm F-actin in buffer B plus 0.2 mg/ml calmodulin and 0.1 mm ADP, and centrifuged at 300,000 × g at 25 °C for 10 min. The pellet was dissolved with 8 m urea, and the supernatant and the pellet were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Quench Flow Measurement—Quench Flow measurement was performed in buffer B plus 0.2 mg/ml calmodulin at 25 °C using a KinTek RQF-3 apparatus (KinTek Co., Clarence, PA) using [γ-32P]ATP as described (25Kambara T. Rhodes T.E. Ikebe R. Yamada M. White H.D. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16400-16406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The error is the standard error from three independent experiments. Stopped-flow Measurements—Kinetic measurements were performed in buffer B plus 0.2 mg/ml calmodulin at 25 °C using a KinTek SF-2001 apparatus with a 75-watt xenon lamp. Mant nucleotides were excited at 360 nm, and the fluorescence was monitored using a 420-nm cut-off filter. Pyrene-actin was excited at 365 nm with a 365-nm band-pass filter, and the fluorescence was monitored using a 400-nm cut-off filter. Intrinsic tryptophan residues in M10IQ1 were excited at 295 nm, and the fluorescence was monitored using a 340-nm cut-off filter. MDCC-PBP was excited at 436 nm with a 436-nm band-pass filter, and the fluorescence was monitored using a 450-nm cut-off filter. 3 μm MDCC-PBP, 0.01 units/ml PNPase, and 0.3 mm MEG were pre-included in all solutions. Light scattering at 550 nm was observed to monitor dissociation of acto-M10IQ1. The volume ratio of the syringe was 1:1 in all single mixing experiments and 1:1:1 in double mixing experiments. Curve fitting was done using the KinTek SF-2001 software. The error represents the standard error from 3-10 independent experiments. Kinetic Simulation—Kinetic simulations were performed using STELLA v8.1.1 software (iseesystems, Lebanon, NH). Expression and Purification of the Myosin X Construct—We produced a bovine myosin X construct having the motor domain and the first IQ domain (Met1-Gln773). This construct (M10IQ1) was used in the present study to avoid the possible complexity arising from the interhead interaction. The M10IQ1 was expressed using the baculovirus expression system together with calmodulin in Sf9 cells and purified with Ni2+-agarose affinity column. As expected from the design of the construct, the isolated protein had an apparent molecular mass of 90 kDa co-purified with a low molecular mass peptide (Fig. 1A). The mobility of the low molecular mass peptide on an SDS-PAGE increased with Ca2+, suggesting that it is calmodulin (not shown). The amount of bound calmodulin to M10IQ1 seemed to be low. We think that the bound calmodulin was partially lost during the purification steps. We observed that the addition of calmodulin to the purified M10IQ1 increased the actin-activated ATPase activity, suggesting that the IQ domain of the purified M10IQ1 is not completely occupied with calmodulin. Based upon the increase in the ATPase activity, the apparent dissociation constants of calmodulin for M10IQ1 were estimated to be 2.7 ± 1.2 μg/ml and 1.4 ± 0.2 μg/ml, in the presence (0.1 mm) and the absence of Ca2+, respectively. Hence, we added 0.2 mg/ml calmodulin to the M10IQ1 sample in all experiments in this study. We also tried co-expression of M10IQ1 with calmodulin-like protein (CLP), since CLP has been reported as a light chain of myosin X, which preferentially binds to the third IQ domain in the presence of Ca2+ (26Rogers M.S. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12182-12189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Despite the high expression levels in the Sf9 cell, which were comparable to that of calmodulin, the co-expressed CLP was not co-purified with M10IQ1 (not shown). The result is consistent with the previous finding, when we consider the lower affinity of CLP to the first IQ motif and the EGTA condition for the purification procedure. Therefore, we examined M10IQ1 having only calmodulin as the light chain in this study. Steady-state ATPase Activity and in Vitro Actin Translocating Activity of M10IQ1—Fig. 1B shows the actin-activated ATPase activity of M10IQ1 as a function of the actin concentration. The ATPase activities at various actin concentrations were fitted well with a Michaelis-Menten equation to yield Vmax and KATPase of 13.5 ± 1.6 s-1 and 17.4 ± 5.2 μm, respectively. We also performed an in vitro motility assay on the M10IQ1 construct to see whether the M10IQ1 retains the actin translocating activity. The velocity was 0.17 ± 0.03 μm s-1 (Fig. 1C) with plus-end movement directionality (not shown). The results suggest that the truncation does not impair the motor function of myosin X. We also found that the addition of exogenous calmodulin (>0.05 mg/ml) greatly improved the movement probability of actin filaments in the in vitro motility assay, suggesting that the binding of light chain to the IQ domain is essential for the motor function of myosin X, and the affinity of calmodulin to the first IQ domain is relatively low. This is consistent with the results from the calmodulin-dependent ATPase assay. MgATP Binding to M10IQ1 and Acto-M10IQ1—Fig. 2 shows the rate of Mant-ATP binding to M10IQ1 as a function of Mant-ATP concentration. The increase in the fluorescence intensity of Mant-ATP followed single exponential kinetics for both M10IQ1 and acto-M10IQ1 (Fig. 2, inset). The observed rate constants linearly increased with Mant-ATP concentration to yield second order rate constants of 3.4 ± 0.3 μm-1 s-1 and 4.7 ± 0.2 μm-1 s-1 for acto-M10IQ1 and M10IQ1, respectively. The extrapolation of the straight lines intercepts the y-axis at <2 s-1, suggesting that the rate for the reverse reaction of the ATP binding step is low. MgATP-induced Population of Weakly Bound Acto-M10IQ1—Pyrene-labeled actin was employed to monitor the ATP-induced population of weakly bound acto-M10IQ1 state. Rapid mixing of MgATP to pyrene-acto-M10IQ1 resulted in an increment of pyrene fluorescence as is observed for other un-conventional myosins (27De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32373-32381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 28De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 21514-21521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The time course of fluorescence transient observed was best fitted to a single exponential (Fig. 3, inset), and the apparent rate constants at various MgATP concentrations showed a hyperbolic relationship against MgATP concentration (Fig. 3). The binding rate constant of MgATP to acto-M10IQ1 (K′1k′+2) can be obtained from the initial slope. The value (2.7 ± 0.4 μm-1 s-1) was consistent with that obtained using Mant-ATP (Fig. 2). The maximum rate constant estimated from the hyperbolic curve fitting (k′+2) was 782 ± 74 s-1, which was more than 50-fold larger than the Vmax of the steady-state ATPase activity of acto-M10IQ1. Therefore, the ATP binding step and the following isomerization step (k′+2) are not rate-limiting for the acto-M10IQ1 ATPase cycle as for other myosins characterized so far. Dissociation of Acto-M10IQ1 by MgATP—The dissociation of acto-M10IQ1 was monitored by measuring the decrease in light scattering intensity upon mixing acto-M10IQ1 with MgATP (Fig. 3). The time course of the signal change was fitted with single exponential kinetics (Fig. 3, inset), and the apparent rate constants of acto-M10IQ1 dissociation were hyperbolically increased with ATP concentration to yield the maximum value of 885 ± 36 s-1. The hyperbola was almost identical to that obtained from the change in pyrene fluorescence intensity, suggesting that the dissociation of acto-M10IQ1 (k+8, k-8 pathway) is a rapid process. Enhancement of Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence Intensity—Myosin X contains a conserved tryptophan residue (Trp481) located at the rigid relay loop. This residue is equivalent to Trp510 of skeletal muscle myosin II that has been shown to be the largest contributor to the enhancement of intrinsic tryptophan associated with ATP binding and hydrolysis. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence intensity of M10IQ1 increased upon addition of ATP, and the increase followed single exponential kinetics (Fig. 4, inset). The apparent rate constants increased with ATP to show a hyperbolic dependence (Fig. 4) and yielded a maximum rate constant of 395 ± 26 s-1. The MgATP binding rate constant obtained from the initial tangent of the hyperbola was 4.4 ± 0.6 μm-1 s-1, which was consistent with the value obtained from the Mant-ATP binding experiment (Fig. 2). We assume that the intrinsic tryptophan enhancement of M10IQ1 by MgATP monitors predominantly the hydrolysis step (k+3 + k-3), because the observed maximal rate constant of 300∼400 s-1 was less than half of that of the maximal ATP binding rate (k′+2 ∼800 s-1) determined by the ATP-induced pyrene fluorescence change. Because the ATP binding rate constant in the absence of actin is even greater than that in the presence of actin (suggesting k+2 > k′+2 if K1 = ∼K′1), if the intrinsic tryptophan enhancement predominantly monitors the ATP binding but not the following hydrolysis step, the maximal rate should be k+2, which should be similar to or larger than k′+2 (∼800 s-1). Quench Flow Measurements of ATP Hydrolysis by M10IQ1—It is known that myosin forms a myosin/ADP/P ternary complex (MDP) after ATP hydrolysis. Because the protein-bound phosphate is released from myosin by acid quenching of the ATPase reaction, rapid initial phosphate release is observed when the reaction is stopped by acid (Pi burst). Fig. 5 shows the time course of the Pi release of M10IQ1 ATPase reaction measured by a quench flow experiment. A single turnover experiment was carried out to determine the equilibrium of the hydrolysis step (Fig. 5A). 1 μm [γ-32P]ATP was mixed with 2 μm M10IQ1 so that all given ATP was bound to the ATP binding site of myosin X. Pi was rapidly released from acto-M10IQ1 followed by a slow Pi release. The fast phase represents the initial rapid ATP hydrolysis by M10IQ1. The slow phase (0.06 s-1) corresponds to the apparent Pi release rate (k+4 obs). The presence of the slow Pi release phase suggests that a certain population of M10IQ1 is present as a prehydrolysis step (MT). From the ratio of the fraction of the fast phase to the slow phase, the Pi burst size of 0.46 ± 0.02 was obtained. This result indicates that the equilibrium of the MT-MDP step is significantly shifted to the prehydrolyzed form. The rate of the ATP hydrolysis was also measured with higher ATP concentrations (Fig. 5B). The initial Pi burst rates were 65 s-1 and 124 s-1 in the presence of 10.7 μm ATP and 20.9 μm ATP, respectively. The observed rate constants were limited by ATP binding rate at a given ATP concentration, suggesting that the ATP hydrolysis rate (k+3 + k-3) is greater than 120 s-1. Phosphate Release Rate—Fluorescently labeled phosphate-binding protein (MDCC-PBP) was used to monitor the rate of phosphate release in the presence or absence of actin (Fig. 6). The fluorescence increased upon binding of released phosphate, and it followed single exponential kinetics in the absence of actin. The observed rate, 0.06 ± 0.02 s-1 (k+4 obs), was consistent with the rate obtained from the quench flow experiment (Fig. 5A). In the presence of actin, however, the fluorescence increment followed double exponential kinetics as reported recently (30Kovacs M. Wang F. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15071-15083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The fast phase was actin concentration-dependent as expected from the kinetics scheme (Scheme 1). We could not see any sign of curvature within the experimentally achievable actin range we tested. The slope gives us a second order rate constant for MDP-AMDP transition (k′+4/K9 obs), and it was 0.71 ± 0.02 μm-1 s-1 (Fig. 6B). The maximum Pi release rate in the presence of actin was estimated to be >100 s-1 based upon the lack of curvature up to 50 μm actin. The slow phase was actin-independent and fairly constant throughout the actin concentrations tested. The slow phase is not an artifact coming from the MDCC-PBP system, because we did not observe the dual phase on skeletal myosin S-1 (not shown). One possible explanation for the slow phase is “attached hydrolysis (AMT-AMDP)” as reported (19White H.D. Belknap B. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11828-11836Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 30Kovacs M. Wang F. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15071-15083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The other possibility is ATP rebinding to M10IQ1 during the observation. In principle, these two possibilities can be discriminated by performing the experiment with different M10IQ1 concentrations. The rate of the slow phase should be independent of M10IQ1 concentration if the former situation is the case. On the other hand, if the latter situation is the case, the rate of ATP rebinding should be faster at higher M10IQ1 concentrations; thus, we should see a faster second phase. We performed the same experiment in Fig. 6A as a function of M10IQ1 concentration from 0.25 to 0.67 μm (in final), with fixed actin concentrations (5 μm in final) and ATP concentrations (0.23 μm in final) (Fig. 6B, inset). The rate of the slow phase increased by increasing the M10IQ1 concentration whereas the fast phase remained at the same rate (∼5.5 s-1, not shown), suggesting the slow phase came from the ATP rebinding during the observation. With the given ATP concentration (0.23 μm), the rate constant of the forward reaction is ∼1 s-1. The rate constant of ∼1 s-1 for the reverse reaction (that is possible with k-2 = 0.2 ± 1.3, Fig. 2) together with the equilibrium of ATP hydrolysis step (K3 = 0.85), explains the observed ∼40% contribution of the slow phase to the total phase (Fig. 6A, inset). We think that the attached hydrolysis (AMT-AMDP) is negligible under the condition we employed in this study (see “Discussion”). We conclude that the phosphate release (>100 s-1) is not the rate-limiting step of the acto-M10IQ1 ATPase cycle. We assume k-4 and k′-4 as ∼0 s-1, because 2 mm phosphate did not inhibit the ATPase activity of M10IQ1 (not shown).Scheme 1Reaction scheme of myosin X ATPase.

Its clinical prognosis correlates with the expression of members of the Trk neurotrophin receptor family, which includes TrkA and TrkB. TrkA expression is associated with favorable prognosis, whereas TrkB expression is associated with poor prognosis. Here we show that TrkA expression induces the apoptosis of NB cells and does so by modulating the levels or activities of a number of proteins involved in regulating cell survival and apoptosis, including p53, Bcl-2, and caspase-3. TrkA increased the expression of p53 target proteins and failed to induce apoptosis in cells where p53 was inactivated by mutation or via expression of dominant inhibitory p53 or E1B55K, indicating that TrkA mediates apoptosis, at least in part, through p53. Treatment with a caspase inhibitor or overexpression of Bcl-XL also prevented TrkA from inducing apoptosis. In contrast, elevated expression of TrkA in non-transformed sympathetic neurons resulted in the suppression of p53 levels and enhanced survival. These results identify apoptosis as a novel biological response of TrkA in NB cells and imply that TrkA is a good prognosis marker for NB due in part to its ability to mediate apoptosis when expressed at sufficient levels.

The median age at diagnosis is ∼18 months, and spontaneous tumor regression is frequently observed in patients diagnosed at 1 year of age or younger. In contrast, children older than 1 year diagnosed with NB often experience aggressive tumors that are disseminated, resistant to chemotherapy, and metastasized to bone, and often fatal. An important correlative characteristic of NB is the expression of two of the neurotrophin receptors, the TrkA/nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor and the TrkB/brain-derived neurotrophic factor receptor (1Aoyama M.

Cell Growth & Differ. 1990; 1: 79-85PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, expression of TrkA by transfection converts NGF non-responsive NB cells into NGF-responsive cells, both in culture and in vivo, with the typical responses being the cessation of cell growth and differentiation into neural and Schwann cells (12Matsushima H. Bogenmann E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7447-7456Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, TrkA converts malignant NB cells into quiescent differentiated cells. An alternative or additional explanation for why TrkA is a good prognosis marker for NB that might contribute to spontaneous tumor regression is that it may induce apoptosis. Paradoxically, TrkA is a potent pro-survival protein for sympathetic and sensory neurons (14Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar), whereas it has been shown to induce, when overexpressed, the apoptosis of medulloblastoma cells (15Muragaki Y. Chou T.T. Kaplan D.R. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 530-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the following study, we asked whether expression of full-length TrkA (human TrkAI) would induce the apoptosis of NB cells. We find that TrkA, expressed at levels similar to that found in neurons, caused the apoptosis of NB cells with MYCN amplification while stimulating the survival of non-transformed sympathetic neurons. Apoptosis by TrkA was accompanied by alterations in the levels and/or the activities of a number of proteins involved in apoptotic signaling, including p53, Bcl-2, and caspase-3. We show that wild-type p53 expression and activity, and not p38 MAPK or p42/44 MAPK activities, were required to mediate TrkA-induced cell death. Our findings suggest that high expression of TrkA that occurs in good prognosis NB tumors may result in apoptosis and that this event is mediated by p53, which is wild-type in most NB tumors.

E1B55K and p53C135S Ad5 were a kind gift from Dr. Philip Branton (25Narendran A. Ganjavi H. Morson N. Connor A. Barlow J.W. Keystone E. Malkin D. Freedman M.H. Exp. Hematol. 2003; 31: 693-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Heat inactivation was performed by heating the virus at 100 °C for 5 min. For infections, NB cells were counted and plated in flasks coated with either 4% rat tail collagen (for biochemistry) or poly-d-lysine (for survival assays and immunohistochemistry) for 18-24 h. Cells were infected with adenovirus at the indicated multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) and times. NGF (50 ng/ml) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (100 ng/ml), and U0126 MEK and Z-VAD-fmk were added at the time of infection unless otherwise indicated. Biochemistry—Trk immunoprecipitation: NB cells infected for 36 h were treated with neurotrophin for 5-10 min at 37 °C and lysed, and Trk proteins were immunoprecipitated and assessed for tyrosine phosphorylation in Western blots then stripped and reprobed for total protein as described before (5Kaplan D.R. Matsumoto K. Lucarelli E. Thiele C.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 321-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Trk immunoprecipitation in neurons was performed as described previously (26Belliveau D.J. Krivko I. Kohn J. Lachance C. Pozniak C. Rusakov D. Kaplan D. Miller F.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). For Western blots, cell lysates were electrophoresed on a 7% to 15% gradient or 10% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were visualized using a chemiluminescence ECL™ kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Densitometry Analysis—The densitometry analysis was performed on scanned films with Total Lab 1.0 software (Amersham Biosciences). The intensity values for p53 bands were normalized to the intensity values of the loading control. Immunostaining Assays—Cells were plated on chamber slides (Nalgene, Naperville, IL), infected in the presence of neurotrophins for the indicated times, washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution (BioWhittaker), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Fisher Scientific) for 15 min, and blocked in 3% normal goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories)/Hanks' balanced salt solution for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were incubated with primary antibody (diluted in blocking solution) overnight at 4 °C, washed, and incubated with secondary antibodies coupled to fluorochrome for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst, and pictures were taken using an upright Zeiss microscope. Survival Assays—MTT, Trypan blue exclusion, and TUNEL assays were performed as previously described (27Wartiovaara K. Barnabe-Heider F. Miller F.D. Kaplan D.R. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 815-824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed using the SAS software version 8.02, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC. Linear regression, t test, Tukey, Bonferroni, and Dunnett tests were performed using the procedure GLM, binary data were analyzed using logistic regression, and maximum likelihood ratio was performed with the procedure LOGISTIC. TrkA was expressed by recombinant adenovirus in two human NB cell lines derived from malignant tumors, 15N and NGP (16Ciccarone V. Spengler B.A. Meyers M.B. Biedler J.L. Ross R.A. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 219-225PubMed Google Scholar, 17Brodeur G.M. Sekhon G. Goldstein M.N. Cancer. 1977; 40: 2256-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Both of these cell lines exhibit MYCN amplification and do not express detectable endogenous TrkA or TrkB (16Ciccarone V. Spengler B.A. Meyers M.B. Biedler J.L. Ross R.A. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 219-225PubMed Google Scholar, 28Schwab M. Alitalo K. Klempnauer K.H. Varmus H.E. Bishop J.M. Gilbert F. Brodeur G. Goldstein M. Trent J. Nature. 1983; 305: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Recombinant adenoviruses expressing wild-type human TrkA, or a kinase-defective (KD) human TrkA encoding a mutation at Lys-538 (22Stephens R.M. Loeb D.M. Copeland T.D. Pawson T. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 691-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) were generated. The TrkA proteins were expressed from a tTA-regulated cytomegalovirus promoter (23Massie B. Dionne J. Lamarche N. Fleurent J. Langelier Y. Biotechnology (New York). 1995; 13: 602-608PubMed Google Scholar). Adenovirus vectors that express myc epitope-tagged wild-type or kinase-inactive TrkB (19Atwal J.K. Massie B. Miller F.D. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 2000; 27: 265-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) were also used to infect NB cells. Cells infected with the adenoviruses expressed kinase-active TrkA or TrkB, as determined by probing anti-pan Trk immunoprecipitates of lysates from infected cells with anti-phosphotyrosine (Ptyr). In cells infected with the adenoviruses and treated with the TrkA or TrkB ligands NGF or brain-derived neurotrophic factor, respectively, TrkA and TrkB were expressed and active as kinases (Fig. 1, A and B). KDTrkA and KDTrkB were also expressed at levels similar to their wild-type counterparts at the virus titers used (Fig. 1A). The infection rate was determined to be 50% or more by immunohistochemistry at 27 h post-infection. At this time post-infection, TrkA expressed in NB cells is lower than the endogenous levels of TrkA in cultured sympathetic neurons (Fig. 1C), indicating that TrkA was not greatly overexpressed. Because TrkA expression was observed in the absence of co-infection with a tTA virus to further transactivate the tTA-responsive promoter element driving TrkA expression (Fig. 1B), we did not use tTA co-infection in further experiments. We next determined whether TrkA expression would alter the survival or growth of the NB cell lines. TrkA, KDTrkA, TrkB, KDTrkB, and LacZ were ectopically expressed using adenoviruses in 15N and NGP cell lines and survival determined by Trypan blue exclusion (which measures both necrosis and apoptosis) and MTT assay (for mitochondrial function) at 72 h post-infection. The survival of TrkA-infected cells was reduced by 50% as compared with uninfected cells as assessed by Trypan blue exclusion (Fig. 1D, p < 0.05, Dunnett). In contrast, the expression of TrkB, KDTrkA, KDTrkB or LacZ had no significant effect on cell survival. The cell death-inducing effect of TrkA was dose-responsive in both 15N and NGP cells, with maximal cell death of 70-85% observed at 50-200 m.o.i. as determined by MTT assay (Fig. 1, E and F). The LacZ adenovirus had no effect on cell viability at 200 m.o.i. To determine whether this effect of TrkA expression was specific to TrkA and not to a contaminant in the virus preparation, the TrkA adenovirus preparation was heat-inactivated prior to infection of NGP cells. This treatment abolished TrkA-induced cell death (Fig. 1G). To ascertain whether TrkA caused apoptotic cell death, TUNEL assays were performed at different time points following TrkA or LacZ infection of NGP cells. Approximately 20% of the cells were TUNEL-positive by 48 h of TrkA expression, whereas virtually no TUNEL-positive cells were observed in cells infected with the LacZ adenovirus (Fig. 1H). This was statistically significant with p < 0.001 (logistic regression). Thus, transient ectopic TrkA, and not TrkB or KD TrkA expression, induces the apoptotic cell death of NB cells. A concern of these experiments is that expression of TrkA via recombinant adenovirus will induce apoptosis of all cell types. We therefore determined whether TrkA adenovirus expression would induce the death of sympathetic neurons, which is derived from the same precursor cells as NB is thought to arise from (29Brodeur G.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar). Sympathetic neurons isolated from the superior cervical ganglia of newborn rats were grown for 3 days in NGF and infected with TrkA or GFP adenoviruses. After 48 h, cells were washed free of NGF, and incubated for a further 48 h in 0-20 ng/ml NGF, and MTT assays were performed. TrkA, when expressed at ∼20-fold higher levels than endogenous TrkA (Fig. 1I), did not suppress the survival of the neurons. Rather, the adenovirus-expressed TrkA enhanced the survival of neurons grown in the absence or in low amounts of NGF (0-1 ng/ml NGF) that do not normally support survival (Fig. 1J), likely reflecting the auto-activation of TrkA observed at high expression levels (20Hempstead B.L. Rabin S.J. Kaplan L. Reid S. Parada L.F. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1992; 9: 883-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Thus, elevated levels of TrkA mediate the apoptosis of NB cells and enhance the survival of non-transformed neurons. We then asked whether TrkA would induce caspase-dependent apoptosis by examining caspase-3 cleavage as an indicator of caspase-3 activity, and by the cleavage of PARP, a downstream target of caspases. NGP cells treated with NGF were infected with TrkA adenovirus, and cleaved caspase-3 detected by Western blotting with an antibody specific to this protein. Caspase-3 was cleaved by 24 h and increased to maximal levels at 30 h (Fig. 2, A and B). This effect was specific to TrkA, because LacZ expression resulted in no caspase-3 activation at the 36-h time point (Fig. 2B). This result was confirmed by immunostaining for the cleaved form of caspase-3 in TrkA-infected NGP cells (Fig. 2C, p < 0.001, logistic regression). Similarly, the cleaved form of PARP was observed by 24 h and increased up to 35 h post-TrkA infection (Fig. 2D). To determine whether cell death induced by TrkA was dependent upon caspase activation, TrkA-infected cells were treated with the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (100 μm). Z-VAD-fmk prevented the appearance of cleaved caspase-3 and PARP induced by TrkA (Fig. 2E, lanes 1 and 2) and almost completely suppressed cell death induced by TrkA expression (Fig. 2F). Overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member proteins such as Bcl-XL has been shown to be protective against anti-apoptotic stimuli (30Huang Z. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6627-6631Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). If TrkA induces caspase-3 activation via the mitochondria pathway, we hypothesized that overexpression of Bcl-XL should suppress TrkA-induced cell death. NGP cells were infected with either Bcl-XL or control GFP-expressing adenovirus, together with TrkA. The overexpression of Bcl-XL was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 3A, first panel). Bcl-XL expression prevented TrkA-induced caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage (Fig. 3A) and significantly (p < 0.01, logistic regression) reduced TrkA-mediated cell death by ∼50% as compared with cells co-infected with TrkA and GFP (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that TrkA induces apoptosis in part by modulating the levels of Bcl-2 family members. In support of this hypothesis, expression of TrkA, but not LacZ via recombinant adenovirus in NGP cells resulted in a dramatic suppression of Bcl-2 protein levels as observed 36 h post-infection (Fig. 3C). TrkA expression did not alter the levels of Bax (Fig. 3D) or Bcl-XL (Fig. 3A, TrkA versus LacZ lanes). Thus, one mechanism whereby TrkA may induce apoptosis is by the suppression of the levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. We next asked whether there were differences in the activation of intracellular signaling proteins in NB cells expressing TrkA, which induces apoptosis, and TrkB, which does not. NB cells were infected with TrkA or TrkB, and the activation of three known signal transduction cascades, MEK/Erk, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, and PLC-γ1 (14Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar), was assessed after 24 h in NGF or brain-derived neurotrophic factor by probing Western blots of cell lysates with antibodies to phosphorylated and activated Akt, Erk1/2, or PLC-γ1. Although TrkA and TrkB activation resulted in the phosphorylation of both Akt and PLC-γ1 to similar extents (Fig. 4, A and B), TrkA expression resulted in much more robust Erk1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4C). No differences in Erk1/2 phosphorylation were observed in TrkA- or TrkB-expressing cells treated with NGF or brain-derived neurotrophic factor for 5 min (data not shown). These results suggest that TrkA may induce apoptosis by a MAPK-dependent mechanism. To test this hypothesis, TrkA-expressing NGP cells were treated with the selective MEK inhibitor U0126, and cell survival was assessed. U0126 treatment (20 μm) for 36 h suppressed the phosphorylation of Erk2, but not of Akt, indicating that U0126 acts selectively in these experiments (Fig. 4D). U0126 treatment, however, did not inhibit cell death induced by TrkA (48 h post-infection) in NGP cells as determined by MTT (Fig. 4E) or Trypan blue exclusion assay (Fig. 4F). MAPK activity is therefore not required for TrkA-induced cell death. The MKK4/7-JNK pathway is an important pro-apoptotic pathway in sympathetic neurons (14Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether TrkA would induce the activation of JNK in NB cells. NGP cells were infected with TrkA or LacZ adenoviruses for 36 h and treated with 50 ng/ml NGF for either 15 min or 2 h prior to lysis. Western blot analysis using a phosphorylation and activation-specific antibody for JNK revealed that TrkA did not induce the phosphorylation of JNK1/2 (Fig. 4G), indicating that these JNK isoforms are likely not involved in TrkA-mediated NB cell death. We also assessed p38 MAPK activity, which is required for efficient TrkA-induced apoptosis of PC12 cells (31Yan C. Liang Y. Nylander K.D. Schor N.F. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4867-4875PubMed Google Scholar). No difference in p38 MAPK activity (as determined by a phosphorylation and activation-specific antibody) was observed in NGF-treated NGP cells infected with TrkA or LacZ adenovirus (data not shown). Thus, TrkA appears to induce a p38 MAPK, Erk1/2, and JNK-independent cell death. An important pro-apoptotic effector acting upstream of mitochondria is the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Most primary NBs from patients express wild-type p53 (32Vogan K. Bernstein M. Leclerc J.M. Brisson L. Brossard J. Brodeur G.M. Pelletier J. Gros P. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5269-5273PubMed Google Scholar, 33Komuro H. Hayashi Y. Kawamura M. Hayashi K. Kaneko Y. Kamoshita S. Hanada R. Yamamoto K. Hongo T. Yamada M.

Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4053-4058PubMed Google Scholar), and p53 is frequently sequestered in the cytoplasm of NB cells away from its transcriptional targets (35Moll U.M. LaQuaglia M. Benard J. Riou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4407-4411Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 36Moll U.M. Ostermeyer A.G. Haladay R. Winkfield B. Frazier M. Zambetti G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1126-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). To address whether TrkA modulates p53 expression levels and/or localization, we measured the protein levels of p53 following TrkA expression by Western blotting or immunofluorescence with anti-p53. TrkA, but not LacZ control virus, induced an increase in p53 levels that was first observed at 24 h post-infection (Fig. 5, A and B). Densitometry and statistical analyses of all time points showed a significant increase in p53 levels (p < 0.01, linear regression adjusted for time or by t test for each time point; *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01, Fig. 5C). In addition, that increase was determined to be of 2-fold 30 h post-infection compared with LacZ-infected cells (Fig. 5, D and E, p < 0.01, Tukey). The levels of p21WAF-1, a protein product of a gene whose transcription is induced by p53, were also increased by TrkA expression (Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast, p53 levels were suppressed by TrkA adenovirus expression in sympathetic neurons grown in suboptimal (1 ng/ml) levels of NGF that do not support survival (Fig. 5F). The increases in p53 levels in TrkA-expressing NB cells were confirmed by immunostaining NGP cells with anti-p53 at 30 h post-infection. p53 levels were higher in TrkA-infected than in LacZ-infected cells and showed higher levels of p53 in the nucleus as compared with LacZ-infected cells (Fig. 5G). Thus, p53 may be a critical mediator of TrkA-induced NB cell death. To address whether p53 activity is required for TrkA-mediated NB cell death, two types of experiments were performed. First, we asked whether TrkA would induce the death of MYCN amplified SK-N-BE(2) neuroblastoma cells that express only a non-functional p53 mutant (C135F) (37Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L.

SK-N-BE(2) or NGP (expressing wild-type p53 (38Tweddle D.A. Malcolm A.J. Cole M. Pearson A.D. Lunec J. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 2067-2077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar)) cells were infected with TrkA, wild-type p53, or LacZ adenoviruses for 48-72 h in the presence of NGF, and cell death was assessed. TrkA was expressed at 36 h post-infection and active as a kinase in the TrkA-infected SK-N-BE(2) cells, as determined by Western blotting of anti-Trk immunoprecipitates with anti-Ptyr (Fig. 6A, first two panels) and by probing with anti-phosphorylation and activation specific Erk1/2 (Fig. 6A, third panel). Although"
https://openalex.org/W2161065850,"Polycystin-2 (PC2), a member of the transient receptor potential family of ion channels (TRPP2), forms a calcium-permeable cation channel. Mutations in PC2 lead to polycystic kidney disease. From the primary sequence and by analogy with other channels in this family, PC2 is modeled to have six transmembrane domains. However, most of the structural features of PC2, such as how large the channel is and how many subunits make up the pore of the channel, are unknown. In this study, we estimated the pore size of PC2 from the permeation properties of the channel. Organic cations of increasing size were used as current carriers through the PC2 channel after PC2 was incorporated into lipid bilayers. We found that dimethylamine, triethylamine, tetraethylammonium, tetrabutylammonium, tetrapropylammonium, and tetrapentylammonium were permeable through the PC2 channel. The slope conductance of the PC2 channel decreased as the ionic diameter of the organic cation increased. For each organic cation tested, the currents were inhibited by gadolinium and anti-PC2 antibody. Using the dimensions of the largest permeant cation, the minimum pore diameter of the PC2 channel was estimated to be at least 11 A. The large pore size suggests that the primary state of this channel found in vivo is closed to avoid rundown of cation gradients across the plasma membrane and excessive calcium leak from endoplasmic reticulum stores."
https://openalex.org/W1976140150,"Fibroblast adhesion to fibronectin (FN) induces formation of focal adhesions (FAs), structures that have significant effect on cell migration and signaling. FA formation requires actomyosin-based contractility that is regulated by Rho-dependent myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation. Previous studies indicated that the FN central cell-binding (and integrin-binding) domain (CBD) is insufficient for FA formation and that the major heparin-binding domain (HepII) facilitates FA formation in a Rho-dependent manner. We describe here conditions under which FN CBD alone is sufficient for FA formation in both human dermal fibroblasts and the FN-null murine fibroblasts. CBD-mediated FA formation is dependent on its surface adsorption and the adhesion activity of the cells. Attachment of FN-null fibroblasts to CBD elicits the same biphasic regulation of Rho activity as seen on intact FN, whereas adhesion to HepII alone does not activate Rho. Activation of Rho requires high levels of integrin occupancy. However, FN or CBD may induce FAs without increased activation of Rho (i.e. the basal level of GTP-Rho induces sufficient phospho-MLC for FA assembly under this condition). In contrast, adhesion to HepII alone does not sustain MLC phosphorylation. Pulse stimulation of cells on CBD or HepII with lysophosphatidic acid elevates Rho GTP loading to the same level, but the lysophosphatidic acid-stimulated MLC phosphorylation is significantly lower in cells on HepII than on CBD. Coating HepII with suboptimal concentrations of CBD induces FAs without increased activation of Rho. Therefore, FN CBD can support FA formation and generate contraction by activating Rho or by facilitating Rho downstream signaling.

It interacts with multiple cell surface receptors and plays an important role in the regulation of anchorage-dependent cell growth, cell migration, differentiation, gene expression, tumor development and metastasis, embryogenesis, angiogenesis, and wound healing (1.Mosher D.F.

Cell adhesion to the immobilized FN leads to clustering of the integrins and accumulation of multiple cytoskeletal and signaling proteins around the integrin cytoplasmic domain. These protein complexes, named focal adhesions (FAs), form “focal contact” with the matrix via the clustered integrins. Inside the cells, FAs are linked to the contractile actin/myosin filaments (stress fibers) via certain cytoskeletal proteins (reviewed in Ref. 7.Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar). Assembly of FAs and the associated actin stress fibers requires the small GTPase Rho (8.Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar). Rho enhances phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC), which in turn initiates contraction (9.Sellers J.R. Curr.

The Rho-controlled generation of contraction/tension affects many cellular functions such as cell motility, differentiation, matrix assembly, and cell cycle progression (12.Schoenwaelder S.M.

It has three types of molecular modules named type I, II, and III repeats (16.Kornblihtt A.R. Umezawa K. Vibe-Pedersen K. Baralle F.E.

The central region spanning roughly from the second to eleventh type III repeats (III2-11) mediates most of the cell adhesion activity of FN, and is thus named the central cell-binding domain (CBD). The adhesion activity was mapped to the fragment III9-10, which contains the RGD sequence in III10 and the synergy site in III9 (19.McDonald J.A. Quade B.J. Broekelmann T.J. LaChance R. Forsman K.

This fragment interacts with cell surface receptors of the integrin family, which are αβ heterodimers (22.Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar). C-terminal to the RGD-containing CBD is the major heparin-binding domain (HepII), which spans from III12 to III14. HepII has been reported to interact with the cell surface receptors including syndecan-4 (23.Saunders S. Bernfield M. J.

The adjacent HepII is required for FA formation (28.Woods A. Couchman J.R. Johansson S. Hook M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 29.Izzard C.S. Radinsky R.

S. A. 1999; 96: 2805-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The requirement for HepII can be bypassed by stimulation with an antibody against syndecan-4, a putative HepII receptor, or by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a known activator of Rho (33.Saoncella S. Echtermeyer F. Denhez F. Nowlen J.K. Mosher D.F. Robinson S.D. Hynes R.O. Goetinck P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2805-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). It was shown recently that the syndecan-4 null cells appear to have reduced Rho activity (34.Wilcox-Adelman S.A. Denhez F. Goetinck P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32970-32977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the HepII, via the interaction with its receptors (such as syndecan-4), may signal to activate Rho and thereby facilitate the formation of FAs (35.Woods A. Couchman J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Cell adhesion to FN regulates Rho activity in a complex pattern. In the absence of serum-soluble factors, Rho activity is slightly inhibited at the early phase of cell adhesion but modestly stimulated at the later phase of adhesion in Swiss 3T3 cells. In the presence of serum, the activation phase is significantly enhanced, indicating a synergistic effect between soluble factors and FN (36.Ren X.-D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar, 37.Ren X.-D. Kiosses W.B. Sieg D.J. Otey C.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Schwartz M.A. J.

Integrin/CBD-mediated Src activation appears responsible for the initial decrease of Rho activity (38.Arthur W.T. Petch L.A. Burridge K. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 719-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), which implies that HepII may be involved in Rho activation.Rho-associated kinase (ROCK, ROK, or Rho-kinase), one of the Rho effectors, phosphorylates MLC primarily at Ser-19 and to a lesser extent at Thr-18 (41.Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Chihara K. Nakano T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20246-20249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar), producing both mono- and diphosphorylated MLC (pMLCS19 and ppMLCT18/S19). ROCK also inhibits myosin phosphatase by phosphorylation of its myosin-binding subunit (MBS; also named MYPT1) at Thr-853 and Thr-695 (numbers based on human sequence) (42.Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Therefore, ROCK promotes MLC phosphorylation by direct phosphorylation and by inactivation of myosin phosphatase (46.Hartshorne D.J. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 164: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 47.Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Amano M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 459-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). We have recently found that ppMLCT18/S19, pMLCS19, and phosphorylation of MBS at Thr-853 (pMBST853) are dependent on Rho and ROCK in human fibroblasts. We also found that Rho signal transduction leading to MLC phosphorylation requires cell adhesion to FN (48.Ren X.-D. Wang R. Li Q. Kahek L. A.F. Kaibuchi K. Clark R. A.F. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3511-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the role of CBD and HepII in facilitating Rho signal transduction has not been addressed.To assess the role of FN CBD and HepII in regulating Rho activity and Rho-induced signal transduction leading to MLC phosphorylation, we constructed recombinant CBD (eighth to eleventh type III repeats; III8-11), HepII (12th to 15th type III repeats; III12-15), and several derivatives. We report here unexpected findings that a sufficient density of surface adsorbed CBD induces FAs via signaling that is distinct from that of HepII.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneral reagents, the Rho activity assay, and detection of MLC phosphorylation by Western blotting were described previously (48.Ren X.-D. Wang R. Li Q. Kahek L. A.F. Kaibuchi K. Clark R. A.F. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3511-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Human plasma FN was purchased from Chemicon International Inc.Cloning and Purification of the Recombinant Human FN Fragments—The human FN cDNA clone pFH154 was purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Clone pFH1 was obtained from the Japan Health Science Foundation. These clones (16.Kornblihtt A.R. Umezawa K. Vibe-Pedersen K. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1755-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) were used either as PCR templates or as restriction fragments for the cloning of FN fragments (Fig. 1). The pETCH expression vector was constructed by modifying the pET-based pCal-n vector (Stratagene) to code for a C-terminal six-histidine affinity tag. The recombinant FN fragments have three extra amino acids (Met-Gly-Ser) at the N terminus and eight extra (Thr-Ser-His-His-His-His-His-His) at the C terminus. In some constructs, the coding sequence of glutathione S-transferase (GST) was inserted at either the N or the C terminus (Fig. 1). Protein expression was induced in the BL21DE3LysS strain of Escherichia coli with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C overnight. Protein affinity purification was performed using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After elution with 250 mm imidazole, the protein solution was passed through a Sephadex® G25 (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column to change the buffer into PBS (pH 7.4 measured at room temperature). The pGEX2T vector (Amersham Biosciences) was used to produce GST-III8-11 (without the C-terminal His6 tag) in the DH5α bacteria. Protein expression was induced at 30 °C for 4 h, and the affinity purification was performed using the glutathione-agarose (Pierce). Proteins were eluted in 20 mm glutathione/PBS (pH 7.4) and desalted using a Sephadex® G25 gel filtration column. The purified proteins were stored in small aliquots at -80 °C. The purity of the proteins was routinely determined by SDS-PAGE to be above 90%. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA reagents (Pierce). The molecular mass of the recombinant proteins was estimated to be 40 kDa for III8-11-His6, 35 kDa for III12-15-His6, and 25 kDa for GST-His6. These numbers, together with 220 kDa for FN, were used to calculate molar concentration of the proteins.Protein Immobilization—Proteins were diluted in PBS and adsorbed to different surfaces at 4 °C overnight unless otherwise stated. In some experiments, CAPS buffer (pH 11 measured at room temperature) was used to coat proteins. Glass coverslips and Falcon® tissue culture-treated plastic and Falcon®-nontreated Petri plastic dishes were used for protein coating. The coated surface was then blocked with 2% heat-denatured lipid-free BSA for 60 min at room temperature and rinsed three times with PBS before use.Cell Culture and Cell Treatment—Adult human dermal fibroblast strain (CF31) isolated from a healthy 31-year-old Caucasian female was purchased from BioWhittaker. Passages 5-12 were used in this study. The FN-null mouse fibroblasts were described previously (33.Saoncella S. Echtermeyer F. Denhez F. Nowlen J.K. Mosher D.F. Robinson S.D. Hynes R.O. Goetinck P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2805-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Cells were washed four times with serum-free DMEM pre-equilibrated to 37 °C to initiate serum starvation. For reattachment experiments, cells were detached in trypsin-EDTA, washed once with serum-free DMEM containing 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and washed once with serum-free DMEM. Cells were then resuspended in serum-free medium containing 1 mg/ml heat-denatured lipid-free BSA (ICN) and plated immediately to the protein-coated plastic dishes. In some instances, cells were maintained in suspension in the 1% agarose-coated dishes for 60 min before being added to the protein-coated dishes.Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100/PBS for 4 min, and blocked with 10% normal goat serum in PBS. FAs were stained with an anti-vinculin antibody (V9131; Sigma), followed by Alexa Fluor® 488-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). The actin filaments were stained with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (Molecular Probes). After the staining on a plastic surface, cells were covered with a glass coverslip, and the pictures were taken immediately in the absence of the glycerol-based mounting medium. Image acquisition was performed under a Nikon Eclipse E600 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a PCM2000 laser confocal scanning controller and the SimplePCI image acquisition software. For staining on glass coverslips, images were recorded under a Leica DMIRE2 inverted laser confocal scanning microscope.Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Proteins were serial diluted and adsorbed to the 96-well plate at 4 °C overnight. Both tissue culture-treated and -nontreated 96-well plates were from BD Biosciences (Falcon® brand). The wells were blocked with 1% BSA/PBS plus Tween 20 for 60 min and then incubated with the monoclonal antibody against C-terminal His6 tag (Invitrogen) or MAB1933 anti-FN CBD (Chemicon International Inc.) for 60 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS/Tween 20, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG was added and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. The TMB peroxidase substrate kit (Bio-Rad) was used for color development. The optical densities at 450 nm were measured in the Bio-Rad model 680 microplate reader.Cell Adhesion Assay—The 96-well plates were coated with 50 μl/well serial diluted proteins at 4 °C overnight. The wells were then blocked with 2% heat-denatured lipid-free BSA for 60 min at room temperature and rinsed with PBS before adding the cells. Cells were suspended in serum-free DMEM for 60 min as described above and added to the wells (1.2 × 104/well) for 30 min before being fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde for 10 min. Cells were rinsed with water, air-dried, and stained with freshly made 0.1% crystal violet in 200 mm boric acid for 20 min. After rinsing, the plates were dried, and the dye absorbed by the cells was extracted using 10% acetic acid for 30 min. The optical densities at 590 nm were measured in the Bio-Rad model 680 microplate reader.RESULTSFN CBD Is Able to Support FA Formation—We first characterized the assembly of FAs and stress fibers in the human dermal fibroblasts. FAs and stress fibers were reduced in number and size after serum withdrawal but were still clearly seen after 20 h of starvation (Fig. 2A). FAs were assembled in cells reattached to the glass coverslips coated with either intact FN or the recombinant III8-15-His6 fragment (containing both CBD and HepII) under serum-free conditions (Fig. 2B). The III8-11-His6 fragment (CBD alone), on the other hand, did not induce FAs (Fig. 2B). These results are consistent with previous reports (28.Woods A. Couchman J.R. Johansson S. Hook M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 31.Yoneda J. Saiki I. Igarashi Y. Kobayashi H. Fujii H. Ishizaki Y. Kimizuka F. Kato I. Azuma I. Exp.

However, we unexpectedly found that the GST-tagged III8-11-His6 induced strong FAs that were indistinguishable from the ones induced by the intact plasma FN (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Assembly of FAs and stress fibers in human dermal fibroblasts. A, confocal microimages of FAs and stress fibers in human fibroblasts before and after serum starvation. B, the vinculin-containing FAs and actin stress fibers in human fibroblasts attached for 2 h to glass coverslips coated with 30 μg/ml intact FN, 10 μg/ml III8-15-His6, 10 μg/ml III8-11-His6, 80 g/ml μ III8-11-His6, and 10 μg/ml GST-III8-11-His6. C, FA and stress fiber staining in human fibroblasts attached for 2 h to the Falcon® tissue culture-treated plastic coated with 30 μg/ml intact FN, 10 μg/ml III8-11-His6, 60 μg/ml III8-11-His6, and 10 μg/ml GST-III8-11-His6 or to the untreated plastic (Petri dish) coated with 10 μg/ml III8-11-His6 (III8-11-His6/Petri).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Since the biochemical analyses of Rho activity and Rho signal transduction are all carried out using FN domains coated on plastic dishes, we further stained FAs on the plastic surface. We found that the ability of III8-11-His6 to induce FAs varied under several conditions. First, III8-11-His6 did not induce FAs when coated at low concentrations (5-10 μg/ml) on the Falcon® tissue culture plastic (Fig. 2C). However, a higher concentration (60 μg/ml) of III8-11-His6 induced FAs in about 50% of the cells (Fig. 2C). Second, GST-III8-11-His6 induced FAs in almost all of the cells when coated at 10 μg/ml on the Falcon® tissue culture plastic (Fig. 2C). Fusion of GST at the C terminus (III8-11-GST-His6) showed the same effect, whereas coating III8-11-His6 (at 5-10 μg/ml) with GST-His6 as separate molecules did not induce FAs (data not shown). Third, III8-11-His6, when immobilized to the untreated polystyrene (Petri dish) at 10 μg/ml, were able to induce FAs in almost all of the cells (Fig. 2C). Therefore, FN CBD alone is sufficient for FA formation.FA Formation on CBD Is Dependent on Surface Adsorption—The ability of CBD to induce FAs is not only dependent on its molecular content and concentration and the nature of the adsorbing surface but is also dependent on the coating buffer. We found that the CAPS buffer diminished the ability of GST-III8-11-His6 to induce FAs (data not shown), consistent with the previous observation (32.Bloom L. Ingham K.C. Hynes R.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1521-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These results prompted us to investigate the surface adsorption efficiency of CBD under these conditions. Since these recombinant proteins have a C-terminal His6 tag, we used an anti-His6 antibody to study the coating efficiency of these fragments by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Proteins were coated on the same type of plastics (tissue culture-treated versus untreated) from the same manufacturer except in the 96-well format. We found that the coating efficiency of III8-11-His6 was significantly higher on the untreated plastic than on the tissue culture treated plastic (Fig. 3A). GST-His6 adsorbed to the Falcon® tissue culture plastic much more efficiently than III8-11-His6, and the fusion of III8-11-His6 to GST significantly improved surface adsorption (Fig. 3B). To compare III8-11-His6 with the intact FN, we used an antibody against FN CBD (MAB1933) in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. As shown in Fig. 3C, GST-III8-11-His6 had similar surface adsorption efficiency to the intact plasma FN. The CAPS buffer remarkably decreased the coating of GST-III8-11-His6 (Fig. 3D). The high coating efficiencies were consistent with the elevated cell adhesion activities and correlated with the induction of FAs. For example, fusion of III8-11-His6 with GST increased its cell adhesion activity by about 18-fold (Fig. 3E). Coating of III8-11-His6 on the Costar® tissue culture-treated plastic (Corning) was higher than the Falcon® tissue culture-treated plate, accompanied by enhanced FA formation (data not shown). Thus, the ability of FN CBD to induce FAs is dependent on its surface adsorption.Fig. 3Analyses of CBD surface adsorption by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the cell adhesion assay.

We reported recently that adhesion to FN, but not poly-l-lysine, induced Rho/ROCK-dependent phosphorylation of MLC (48.Ren X.-D. Wang R. Li Q. Kahek L. A.F. Kaibuchi K. Clark R. A.F. J.

To determine which parts of FN are required to induce MLC phosphorylation, we used GST-III8-11-His6 or GST-III12-15-His6 to coat the Falcon® tissue culture plastic. When the cells were detached and plated directly on GST-III8-11-His6-coated plastic dishes under the serum-free condition, there was an initial decline of both pMLCS19 and ppMLCT18/S19 levels followed by a gradual rebound to reach the basal level after about 80-120 min (Fig. 4).

https://openalex.org/W2034683133,"Although histone acetylation is important for epigenetic gene transcription, histone acetylation regulation by extracellular cues has rarely been evidenced. Here, we examined whether and how histone acetylation is regulated by cell adhesion-mediated signaling. Gastric carcinoma cells in suspension showed a higher histone acetylation, compared with fibronectin-adherent cells. This difference was supported by a decreased histone deacetylases activity. Furthermore, trichostatin A (TSA)-mediated histone acetylation was significantly increased only in suspended, but not in fibronectin-adherent, cells. Pharmacological inhibition of intracellular contractility-related myosin light chain kinase or RhoA-kinase (ROCK) or expression of ROCK1 small interfering RNA, dominant negative RhoA, or active Rac1 decreased basal and TSA-mediated histone H3 acetylations in suspended cells,whereas inhibition of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II or transient overexpression of wild type myosin light chain kinase enhanced the acetylations. Meanwhile, chromatin immunoprecipitation showed higher basal and TSA-enhanced associations of ROCK1 promoter regions with Lys(9)-acetylated histone 3 in suspended cells than in fibronectin-adherent cells and expression of ROCK1 was higher and further increased by TSA treatment in suspension. In addition, phosphorylation of myosin light chain was further increased by TSA in suspension and higher in anchorage-independent cells over adherently growing cells, indicating an inverse relationship between ROCK1 expression-mediated contractility and cell adhesion abilities. Cell adhesion analysis showed that pharmacological activation of intracellular contractility-related signaling activities decreased cell adhesion abilities, whereas inhibition of them increased the adhesion. Taken together, these observations suggest that cell adhesion-related signal transduction regulates histone acetylation, presumably through a close functional linkage between intracellular contractility and histone deacetylases activity/histone acetylation."
https://openalex.org/W2141381730,"Platelets achieve bleeding arrest at sites of vascular injury via secretion of secretory proteins from their storage granules, termed α-granules. We have recently analyzed granule targeting of platelet factor 4 (PF4), a secretory α-granule chemokine, and demonstrated that PF4 α-granule storage relied upon determinants within PF4 mature sequence. To define these determinants, PF4 mutants fused to the fluorescent reporter protein green fluorescent protein were generated by progressive deletions and site-directed mutagenesis. They were then transfected in AtT20 cells and assessed for granule targeting by colocalization with ACTH-containing granules, using laser scanning confocal microscopy. This strategy identified the amino acid 41–50 (LIATLKNGRK) sequence as most critical for PF4 granule targeting and/or storage; its deletion from PF4 induced a marked decrease in granule storage (from 81 ± 2% to 17 ± 3%, p ≤ 0.0001). Ala-scanning mutagenesis of LIATLKNGRK narrowed down the targeting motif to LKNG. A direct role for LKNG in α-granule targeting was confirmed in the thrombopoietin-induced human megakaryocytic Dami cells, in which the LKNG-green fluorescent protein chimera exhibited an 82.5 ± 1.8% colocalization with the α-granule proteins von Willebrand factor and P-selectin. LKNG is poorly conserved within the chemokine family. However three-dimensional alignments of the human α-granule chemokines Nap-2 (neutrophil-activating peptide) and RANTES (Regulated upon Activation Normal T Cell Expressed and Secreted) with PF4 revealed that LKNG, a surface-exposed hydrophilic turn/loop, matched Nap-2 (LKDG) and RANTES (TRKN) peptides with similar features. Moreover Nap-2 and RANTES peptides exhibited the same α-granule targeting efficiency than LKNG. We therefore postulate that the three-dimensional and physicochemical characteristics of PF4 LKNG are of general relevance to α-granule targeting of chemokines and possibly of other α-granule proteins."

We have identified an intramolecular interaction between the linker (Linker) region connecting the SH2 and Kinase domains and the Kinase domain. Residue Trp-184 within the Linker region is essential for the Linker-Kinase interaction but not for the Linker-SH3 interaction. A recombinant PTK6 Kinase domain connected to the Linker region had catalytic activity in terms of autophosphorylation, phosphorylation of a PTK6 substrate, BKS, and phosphorylation of an oligopeptide substrate, whereas the Kinase domain itself, or one connected to a Linker region containing a W184A substitution, did not. The introduction of the W184A mutation into PTK6 also abrogated autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of another PTK6 substrate, Sam68, as well as phosphorylation of intracellular proteins. It also abolished the ability of PTK6 to promote proliferation and prevent apoptosis of HEK 293 cells, as well as to permit anchorage-independent colony formation. Therefore, unlike Src family members, in which the Linker-Kinase interaction inhibits catalytic activity, in PTK6 this interaction has an essential positive role.

A partial cDNA of PTK6 was first identified during an extensive survey of PTK mRNAs expressed in human melanocytes (1Lee S.-T. Strunk K.M. Spritz R.A.

It is found in the nucleus in normal prostate epithelia and well differentiated prostate carcinomas and in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of normal oral epithelial cells; however it is mainly present in the cytoplasm in poorly differentiated prostate and oral squamous cell cancers (11Derry J.J. Prins G.S. Ray V. Tyner A.L. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4212-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 12Petro B.J. Tan R.C. Tyner A.L. Lingen M.W. Watanabe K. Oral Oncol. 2004; 40: 1040-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The presence of PTK6 renders mammary epithelial cells more sensitive to the mitogenic effects of EGF and increases anchorage-independent proliferation (13Kamalati T. Jolin H.E. Mitchell P.J. Barker K.T. Jackson L.E. Dean C.J. Page M.J. Gusterson B.A. Crompton M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30956-30963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It also permits EGF-dependent phosphorylation of ErbB3 and subsequent activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway (14Kamalati T. Jolin H.E. Fry M.J. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5471-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, a complex of PTK6 and Akt dissociates in response to EGF stimulation in keratinocytes and COS-1 cells but not in T-47D breast carcinoma cells (15Zhang P. Ostrander J.H. Faivre E.J. Olsen A. Fitzsimmons D. Lange C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1982-1991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It has therefore been suggested that PTK6 may function as a signaling molecule whose kinase activity normally limits the activity of Akt in unstimulated cells. Chen et al. (16Chen H.Y. Shen C.H. Tsai Y.T. Lin F.C. Huang Y.P. Chen R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10558-10572Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) have shown that PTK6 can promote cell motility and invasion by phosphorylating paxillin. These findings suggest that deregulation of PTK6 via its inappropriate expression and subcellular localization may contribute to tumorigenesis. The PTK6 polypeptide deduced from the cDNA sequence contains an SH3 domain, an SH2 domain, and a tyrosine kinase catalytic (Kinase) domain (2Mitchell P.J. Barker K.T. Martindale J.E. Kamalati T. Lowe P.N. Page M.J. Gusterson B.A. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2383-2390PubMed Google Scholar). PTK6 has homology to Src family members. However, it shares only 46% amino acid identity with Src and lacks an N-terminal consensus sequence for acylation and membrane association (2Mitchell P.J. Barker K.T. Martindale J.E. Kamalati T. Lowe P.N. Page M.J. Gusterson B.A. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2383-2390PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the genomic structure of PTK6 is quite distinct from that of Src family kinases (5Lee H. Kim M. Lee K.H. Kang K.N. Lee S.-T. Mol. Cells. 1998; 8: 401-407PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, based on the exon structure, the existence of a unique family of non-receptor-type PTKs that includes PTK6/Sik, Srm, Frk, and Drosophila Src42A/Dsrc41 has been proposed (17Serfas M.S. Tyner A.L. Oncol. Res. 2003; 13: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In Src family members, the inactive conformation of the enzyme is stabilized by intramolecular interactions between the C-terminal phosphotyrosine and the SH2 domain and between proline residues in the SH2-Kinase linker (Linker) and the SH3 domain (18Liu X.

Such intramolecular interactions also negatively regulate the catalytic activity of PTK6 (25Derry J.J. Richard S. Valderrama Carvajal H. Ye X. Vasioukhin V. Cochrane A.W. Chen T. Tyner A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6114-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 26Qiu H. Miller W.T. J. Biol.

In Src family members, these interactions also lock the Kinase domain in an inactive conformation by pinning the Linker region against the N lobe of the Kinase domain (20Williams J.C. Weijland A.

A tryptophan residue in the Linker region, which is highly conserved among PTKs (e.g. Trp-260 in chick c-Src), interacts with the C-terminal end of the αC helix in the N lobe of the Kinase domain (21Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 22Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 32129-32134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This is particularly important for maintaining the inactive state of the Kinase domain. In addition, a conserved hydrophobic residue in the Linker region (e.g. Leu-255 in chick c-Src) projects into a hydrophobic pocket on the back of the N lobe and stabilizes the inactive conformation (29Gonfloni S. Williams J.C. Hattula K. Weijland A. Wierenga R.K. Superti-Furga G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7261-7271Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 30Gonfloni S. Frischknecht F. Way M. Superti-Furga G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We have examined the interaction between the Linker region and Kinase domain of PTK6. Site-directed mutagenesis and surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that Trp-184 of PTK6, which is analogous to Trp-260 (chick c-Src numbering) of Hck, is important for the interaction. We analyzed the biochemical and biological functions of the Trp-184 residue and report that it plays a very different role to the analogous residues in Src family members. Expression Constructs—To generate constructs expressing the glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused SH3 domain (GST-PTK6-SH3), GS-T-PTK6-Kinase, GST-PTK6-Linker(ΔN)-Kinase, and GST-PTK6-L-inker-Kinase (Fig. 1) in Escherichia coli, cDNAs encoding residues 3–72, 189–451, 180–451, and 171–451 of PTK6 were amplified by PCR using primer pairs, 5′-CGGGATCCCGGGACCAGGCTCACCTG-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCACGTCTCCCTCTCGGCCAGGT-3′, 5′-GGAATTCCGAGGAGTTCACGC-3′ and 5′-CATTATGCTGAGTGATATCCCG-3′, 5′-GGAATTCCCATTGGGATGACT-3′ and 5′-CATTATGCTGAGTGATATCCCG-3′, and 5′-CGGGATCCCGCGGAAGCACGAGCCTGAG-3′ and 5′-CATTATGCTGAGTGATATCCCG-3′, respectively, and pBS-PTK6-MR (5Lee H. Kim M. Lee K.H. Kang K.N. Lee S.-T. Mol. Cells. 1998; 8: 401-407PubMed Google Scholar) as the template. The amplified fragment encoding PTK6-SH3 was digested with BamHI and EcoRI, ligated into pGEX-4T3 (Amersham Biosciences) to generate pGEX-4T3-PTK6-SH3. The other amplified fragments were digested with EcoRI and NotI and ligated into pGEX-4T3 to generate pGEX-4T3-PTK6-Kinase, pGEX-4T3-Linker(ΔN)-Kinase, and pGEX-4T3-Linker-Kinase, respectively. To produce a construct expressing GST-BKS in E. coli, a cDNA encoding BKS (31Mitchell P.J. Sara E.A. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4273-4282Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using the primer pair 5′-CGGGATCCCGCATGGCCTCTGCCCTGAGG-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCCGAATCAGTGCTCCAGTGC-3′ and a random cDNA mixture from the breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 as the template. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and subcloned into pGEX-4T3 to generate pGEX-4T3-BKS. For the construct expressing the thioredoxin (Trx)-fused Linker region (Trx-PTK6-Linker) in E. coli, the cDNA encoding PTK6-Linker was amplified by PCR using primer pair, 5′-CATGCCATGGGCCGGAAGCACGAGCCTGAG-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCTCAGAACTCCTCCCAGGCCTC-3′, and pBS-PTK6-MR as the template. The PCR product was digested with NcoI and BamHI and subcloned into pET-32c(+) (Novagen) (pET-32c(+)-PTK6-Linker). To make the construct expressing PTK6 in mammalian cells, a fragment containing full-length PTK6 cDNA was isolated by digestion of pBS-PTK6-MR (5Lee H. Kim M. Lee K.H. Kang K.N. Lee S.-T. Mol. Cells. 1998; 8: 401-407PubMed Google Scholar) with Asp-718 and BamHI and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) digested with the same enzymes (pcDNA3.1-PTK6). Constructs expressing PTK6 and its derivatives were made by primer-mediated site-directed mutagenesis with a QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The identity of all the constructs was verified by DNA sequencing to avoid PCR errors. Production of Recombinant Fusion Proteins—GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli XL1-blue and purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences) as described (32Lee S.J. Jang J.W. Kim Y.M. Lee H.I. Jeon J.Y. Kwon Y.G. Lee S.-T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 519: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Trx-fusion proteins containing a hexahistidine (His) tag were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) and purified with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acidagarose beads (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Pull-down Assays—For pull-down assays using GST-fused proteins, cell lysates containing ∼2 μg of GST-fused proteins were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin pre-equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline buffer. The resin was washed three times, and the GST-fused proteins bound to it were incubated with 2 μg of purified Trx-fused proteins at 4 °C for 8 h. The resin was washed again, and the bound proteins were eluted by boiling after adding SDS sample buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—Binding of PTK6-Linker or the Trp-184 mutant form of PTK6-Linker (PTK6-Linker(W184A)) to PTK6-Kinase was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance using a Biacore 2000 (BIACORE) as described (32Lee S.J. Jang J.W. Kim Y.M. Lee H.I. Jeon J.Y. Kwon Y.G. Lee S.-T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 519: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), with a minor modification. The surface of the sensor chip, CM5, was activated by injecting a mixture of 0.2 m N-ethyl-N′-dimethylaminopropyl-carbodiimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide. Thereafter, GST-PTK6-Kinase (ligand) in coupling buffer (10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0) was injected and immobilized on the surface of the chip. Activated surface that was not immobilized was blocked by 1 m ethanolamine-HCl (pH 8.5). A running buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% P20) was used during the immobilization and binding analysis. In typical experiments, the immobilization levels of GST and GST-PTK6-Kinase were ∼4,550 and 4,450 response units, respectively. Various concentrations of analyte (Trx-PTK6-Linker or Trx-PTK6-Linker(W184A)) were injected so as to pass through the flow cell with immobilized GST followed by the flow cell with immobilized GST-PTK6-Kinase in 2 min at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. For regeneration, proteins bound to ligands were removed by 1-min pulse injections of 50 mm NaOH and 1 m NaCl into the GST-PTK6-Kinase flow cell. This regeneration condition retained more than 95% of the original capacity for binding Trx-PTK6-Linker. To correct for bulk shift, data from the reference flow cells were subtracted from the experimental data. The equilibrium constant (KD) was calculated from the rate constants for association (ka) and dissociation (kd) and the equation KD = kd/ka. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). For transient expression, transfection into HEK 293 cells was carried out with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions (33Jung J.W. Shin W.S. Song J. Lee S.-T. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 328: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and the cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. For stable expression, transfection was performed with calcium phosphate followed by selection with 1,200 μg/ml G418 (34Lee S.-T. Lee S. Peters D.P. Hoffman G.G. Stacey A. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24126-24133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 2 weeks, G418-resistant colonies were cloned and expanded. Western Blot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA) with 10 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and 1 mm NaVO4 on ice for 30 min. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The protein in the supernatants was determined with the BCA assay (Pierce). For Western blot analysis, 40-μg samples of lysate protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with anti-His tag (Qiagen), anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology), anti-PTK6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), anti-Sam68 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), and anti-β-actin (Sigma) primary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and an enhanced chemiluminescent detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation, 1 mg of lysate protein was incubated with 1 μg of anti-PTK6 or anti-Sam68 antibody at 4 °C for 5 h followed by 30 μl of protein A beads (1:1 slurry, Sigma) for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to in vitro kinase assay or Western blot analysis. In Vitro Kinase Assay—To examine autophosphorylation of PTK6 and phosphorylation of BKS by PTK6, purified GST-PTK6-Kinase (200 ng), GST-PTK6-Linker(ΔN)-Kinase (207 ng), GST-PTK6-Linker(ΔN,W184A)-Kinase (207 ng), or GST-PTK6-Linker-Kinase (215 ng) was incubated alone or with 1 μg of GST-BKS in the presence of 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (specific radioactivity, 300–400 cpm/pmol) in 25 μl of kinase reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 50 μm Na3VO4) for 30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were terminated by adding SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The catalytic activity of PTK6 or its derivatives was determined with a random copolymer of glutamate and tyrosine (poly(Glu,Tyr), Sigma) as substrate. GST-PTK6-Kinase, GST-PTK6-Linker(ΔN)-Kinase, GST-PTK6-Linker(ΔN,W184A)-Kinase, and GST-PTK6-Linker-Kinase were expressed in E. coli and purified as described above. PTK6 and its mutants were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells by transfection and immunoprecipitated with anti-PTK6 antibody. For the reactions we used 200 ng of purified GST fusion protein or a half of the protein immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of antibody. In vitro kinase assays were performed as described above, except for the addition of 0.5 mg/ml poly(Glu,Tyr) as substrate. Aliquots (17 μl) of the reaction mixtures were spotted onto phospho-cellulose paper (Whatman), washed in 5% trichloroacetic acid and 0.5% H3PO4 four times for 10 min for each wash, followed by ethanol once, and then dried. Radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting. Cell Proliferation and Cell Survival—To assay cell proliferation, subconfluent cells were starved in serum-free DMEM for 24 h and incubated in DMEM containing 1% fetal bovine serum and 50 ng/ml EGF in the presence of [3H]thymidine for the indicated times. Cell proliferation was determined by the amount of [3H]thymidine incorporated, as described previously (35Lee S.J. Yoo H.J. Bae Y.S. Kim H.J. Lee S.-T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 312: 1196-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For cell survival assays, subconfluent cells were incubated with serum-free DMEM containing various concentrations of H2O2 for 48 h. Viable cells were determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as described previously (36Park M. Lee S.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Anchorage-independent Colony Formation—Anchorage-independent colony formation was measured as described previously (37Schedin P.J. Eckel-Mahan K.L. McDaniel S.M. Prescott J.D. Brodsky K.S. Tentler J.J. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1766-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. A bottom layer of 0.5% low melting point agarose (SeaPlaque, FMC Corp.) in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum was poured into 6-well dishes and allowed to harden at 4 °C. Cells (1 × 104/well) of the appropriate stable cell line were suspended in DMEM-10% fetal bovine serum plus 0.35% agarose at 42 °C and poured onto the solidified base layer. After 5 weeks of incubation, the numbers of colonies formed were counted with a microscope. All assays were performed three times in duplicate. The Linker Region Interacts with the Kinase Domain of PTK6—To see whether an intramolecular interaction occurs between the Linker region and the Kinase domain of PTK6, we expressed GST-PTK6-Kinase and Trx-PTK6-Linker as soluble proteins in E. coli (Fig. 1). The Trx-PTK6-Linker was pulled down by GST-PTK6-Kinase, but not by GST, and Trx on its own did not bind to GST-PTK6-Kinase (Fig. 2). In addition, when GST-PTK6-Kinase or GST was pulled down with the Trx-PTK6-Linker or Trx bound to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin, GST-PTK6-Kinase bound specifically to the Trx-PTK6-Linker (data not shown). These results indicate that the Linker region and Kinase domain are bound to each other in PTK6. The Trp-184 Residue in the Linker Region Is Important for the Linker-Kinase Interaction but Not for the Linker-SH3 Interaction—A tryptophan residue, Trp-184, in the C-terminal region of the Linker in PTK6 is conserved among PTK6, Src, and Csk family members (Fig. 3). In addition, leucine residue Leu-178 of PTK6 is located close to a hydrophobic amino acid (Leu or Trp) that is conserved in Src and Csk family members. To see which amino acid residue(s) in the Linker region plays an important role in the intramolecular interaction between the Linker region and the Kinase domain, various mutations were introduced into Trx-PTK6-Linker, and the mutant polypeptides were expressed as soluble proteins in E. coli (Fig. 1). As expected, changing the conserved tryptophan 184 to alanine (W184A) abolished the interaction (Fig. 4A), whereas neither mutation of the nearby tryptophan 181 to alanine (W181A) nor mutations of leucine 178 to alanine (L178A) or glycine (L178G) affected the interaction. Nor was it affected by substitution of the three proline residues (Pro-175, Pro-177, and Pro-179) that are important for binding to the SH3 domain (27Qiu H. Miller W.T. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2216-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) or of the other proline (Pro-187) in the Linker region. Moreover, in a condition that Trx-PTK6-Linker bound specifically to GST-PTK6-SH3 (Fig. 1), the W184A mutation did not affect the Linker-SH3 interaction (Fig. 4B). We determined the kinetic and equilibrium constants of the interaction between PTK6-Kinase and PTK6-Linker by surface plasmon resonance using a Biacore 2000. A dilute solution of Trx-PTK6-Linker or the W184A mutant (Trx-PTK6-Linker(W184A)) as analyte was allowed to bind to immobilized GST-PTK6-Kinase. As shown in the sensorgrams of Fig. 5, Trx-PTK6-Linker bound to GST-PTK6-Kinase with a dissociation constant (KD) of 1.10 × 10–7 m and Trx-PTK6-Linker(W184A) did not bind. The C-terminal Half of the Linker Region Including the Trp-184 Residue Is Essential for PTK6 Activity—Recombinant PTK6 derivatives were expressed in E. coli (Fig. 1), and their catalytic activities were analyzed by examining autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of a PTK6 substrate, BKS, and an oligopeptide substrate. GST-PTK6-Kinase (Fig. 1), which does not contain any of the Linker region, neither autophosphorylated nor phosphorylated GST-BKS (Fig. 6A). On the other hand, GST-PTK6-Linker-Kinase, which contains the Linker region (but not the SH2 and SH3 domains) (Fig. 1), phosphorylated itself and GST-BKS. When the N-terminal half of the Linker region, which contains the 3 proline residues important for binding to the SH3 domain (27Qiu H. Miller W.T. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2216-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), was removed (GST-PTK6-Linker(ΔN)-Kinase) (Fig. 1), its catalytic activity was unchanged. However, introduction of the W184A mutation into this construct (GST-PTK6-Linker(ΔN,W184A)-Kinase) resulted in complete loss of catalytic activity (Fig. 6B). This result demonstrates that the C-terminal half of the Linker region, including Trp-184, is required for catalytic activity. W184A Mutation Eliminates the Catalytic Activity of PTK6 in Mammalian Cells—To examine whether the Linker-Kinase interaction is essential for catalytic activity of the PTK6 polypeptide expressed in mammalian cells, the W184A mutation and the ATP-binding site mutation K219M (13Kamalati T.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6114-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and they were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells. The mutants were expressed at levels comparable with the wild type PTK6 (Fig. 7A, middle panel). The catalytic activity as estimated by the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins (Fig. 7A, upper panel) was high in wild type PTK6 and much higher in the Y447F mutant as previously reported (25Derry J.J. Richard S. Valderrama Carvajal H. Ye X. Vasioukhin V. Cochrane A.W. Chen T. Tyner A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6114-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 26Qiu H. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34634-34641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, it was at the basal level not only in the W184A and K219M mutants but also in the W184A/Y447F and K219M/Y447F mutants. In addition, without regard to the Y447F mutation, both W184A and K219M mutants neither autophosphorylated (Fig. 7B) nor phosphorylated another PTK6 substrate, Sam68 (Fig. 7C). To quantify the catalytic activity of wild type PTK6 and its mutants, they were immunoprecipitated from the HEK 293 cells with anti-PTK6 antibody and tested with the oligopeptide substrate (Fig. 7D). With the catalytic activity of the wild type set at 100%, those obtained with vector, W184A mutant, K219M mutant, Y447F mutant, W184A/Y447F mutant, and K219M/Y447F mutant were 17.86 ± 0.01, 28.13 ± 1.45, 28.93 ± 1.39, 189.06 ± 1.27, 27.74 ± 0.13, and 28.13 ± 1.73%, respectively. The slightly higher catalytic activities with the W184A, K219M, W184A/Y447F, and K219M/Y447F mutants than with the vector control were probably due to co-immunoprecipitated endogenous tyrosine kinases. The W184A Mutation Abolishes the Proliferative, Anti-apoptotic, and Anchorage-independent Activities of PTK6—To examine the biological consequences of the W184A mutation, HEK293 cells stably expressing the constitutively active Y447F mutant and its derivatives, W184A/Y447F and"

An exception is Hoxb13, which functions as a proapoptotic and antiproliferative protein during development of the caudal spinal cord and tail vertebrae and has also been implicated in adult cutaneous wound repair. The adult epidermis, which expresses several Hox genes including Hoxb13, is continually renewed in a program of growth arrest, differentiation, and a specialized form of apoptosis (cornification). Yet little is known about the function(s) of these genes in skin. Based on its role during embryogenesis, Hoxb13 is an attractive candidate to be involved in the regulation of epidermal differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that Hoxb13 overexpression in an adult organotypic epidermal model recapitulates actions of Hoxb13 reported in embryonic development. Epidermal cell proliferation is decreased, apoptosis increased, and excessive terminal differentiation observed, as characterized by enhanced transglutaminase activity and excessive cornified envelope formation. Overexpression of Hoxb13 also produces abnormal phenotypes in the epidermal tissue that resemble certain pathological features of dysplastic skin diseases. Our results suggest that Hoxb13 functions to promote epidermal differentiation, a critical process for skin regeneration and for the maintenance of normal barrier function.

During development, the skin begins as a single layer of multipotent ectodermal cells capable of producing either hair follicles or epidermis. Cells receiving an instructive signal from the underlying mesenchyme respond by producing hair follicles, but in the absence of the signal, they stratify and generate the morphologically distinct layers of the epidermis. During adult life, the developmental program is recapitulated in the form of a program of cellular differentiation in which the epidermal layers of the skin are continuously renewed. In this process, cells from the dividing basal layer undergo growth arrest and then begin an upward migration, differentiating as they proceed to build an impermeable layer of cornified cells (the stratum corneum) that arises through a coordinated process of programmed cell death (1Wier K.A.

This cornification process, the final step in epidermal differentiation, occurs when a series of defined structural proteins (including loricrin, involucrin, and various keratins) become tightly cross-linked via the activity of the transglutaminase (TGase) 1The abbreviations used are: TGase, transglutaminase; REK, rat epidermal keratinocytes; H&E, hematoxylin and eosin; HA, hyaluronan; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling; CadavF, fluorescein-cadaverine; RT, reverse transcription; GFP, green fluorescent protein.1The abbreviations used are: TGase, transglutaminase; REK, rat epidermal keratinocytes; H&E, hematoxylin and eosin; HA, hyaluronan; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling; CadavF, fluorescein-cadaverine; RT, reverse transcription; GFP, green fluorescent protein. family of enzymes (6Griffin M.

During skin wounding, once the epidermal cells have migrated laterally to repopulate the wound bed, they must vigorously activate the epidermal differentiation program to restore the cutaneous barrier. This process is critically important, because loss of barrier function and inadequate wound healing can result in life threatening fluid losses and infection (8Martin P. Science. 1997; 276: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (3622) Google Scholar). A major objective in cutaneous biology is to understand the transcriptional machinery that regulates gene expression during epidermal differentiation and renewal. One class of transcriptional regulators that are attractive candidates for roles in epidermal renewal and repair is the highly conserved family of Hox transcription factors (9Manak J.R. Scott M.P.

In mammals, the 39 Hox genes that have been identified to date are organized into four individual chromosomal clusters (A-D in humans; a-d in mice). They appear to have arisen from two duplication events of a single ancestral cluster. Based on sequence homology and location within the cluster, Hox genes have been assigned to 13 paralogous groups. During embryogenesis, Hox proteins function as important regulators in differentiation and cell fate determination, and they are critical for axial patterning. Because of their distinct spatio-temporal expression patterns in developing and adult skin, Hox genes have been implicated in the patterning and regenerative processes of skin and hair, as well as in certain skin pathologies including cancer (13Scott G.A. Goldsmith L.A. J. Invest Dermatol. 1993; 101: 3-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Stelnicki E.J. Komuves L.G. Kwong A.O. Holmes D. Klein P. Rozenfeld S. Lawrence H.J. Adzick N.S.

Dyn. 2002; 224: 58-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Interestingly, once the roles of certain Hox genes in axial patterning are complete, these genes may be utilized in a spatially ubiquitous way throughout tissues that are not segmentally restricted, such as the skin. For example, in mice, expression of Hoxb13 is restricted to the caudal region during early fetal development, and contributes to development of posterior organs such as the prostate (18Economides K.D. Capecchi M.R. Development. 2003; 130: 2061-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and the caudal spinal cord and tail vertebrae (19Economides K.D. Zeltser L. Capecchi M.R. Dev. Biol. 2003; 256: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, the axial patterning rules are violated as the animal matures and Hoxb13 (20Komuves L.G. Ma X.K. Stelnicki E. Rozenfeld S. Oda Y. Largman C. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 227: 192-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) as well as Hoxc13 (21Godwin A.R. Capecchi M.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 22Duboule D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) become expressed in the epidermis and/or hair follicles throughout the adult skin. A major difficulty in addressing Hox gene function, either in the fetus or in adult skin, is the fact that functional equivalency often exists within a paralogous group. Thus, with the singular exception of Hoxc13, whose loss in mice produces a fragile hair phenotype (21Godwin A.R. Capecchi M.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), no other skin mutant phenotype of any classical Hox gene has been reported. Adult mice that lack Hoxb13, a paralog of Hoxc13, do not display the altered hair phenotype. However, despite the lack of a skin phenotype in Hoxb13 knock-out mice, previous studies strongly suggest that Hoxb13 functions in both epidermal differentiation and wound repair. Hoxb13 is expressed in both fetal and adult skin (20Komuves L.G. Ma X.K. Stelnicki E. Rozenfeld S. Oda Y. Largman C. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 227: 192-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23Stelnicki E.J. Arbeit J. Cass D.L. Saner C. Harrison M. Largman C. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 57-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Wound healing studies conducted on human fetal and adult skin explants transplanted onto SCID mice revealed that Hoxb13 expression is significantly down-regulated in fetal skin that heals without a scar, but its expression does not change in adult wounds (23Stelnicki E.J. Arbeit J. Cass D.L. Saner C. Harrison M. Largman C. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 57-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These results suggested that suppression of Hoxb13 might be a necessary component to obtain optimal repair. To that end, we recently reported that adult cutaneous Hoxb13 knock-out wounds heal with less scarring compared with wild-type wounds (24Mack J.A. Abramson S.R. Ben Y. Coffin J.C. Rothrock J.K. Maytin E.V. Hascall V.C. Largman C. Stelnicki E.J. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1352-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Examination of unwounded Hoxb13 knock-out skin revealed significantly higher levels of hyaluronan (HA, a known inhibitor of differentiation, Ref. 25Passi A. Sadeghi P. Kawamura H. Anand S. Sato N.

Abramson S.R. Ben Y. Coffin J.C. Rothrock J.K. Maytin E.V. Hascall V.C. Largman C. Stelnicki E.J. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1352-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) in both the epidermis and dermis, as well as reduced expression levels of several epidermal differentiation markers. Collectively, these data indicated that Hoxb13 might function to promote epidermal differentiation and renewal in adult skin. To further investigate the role of Hoxb13 in epidermal differentiation, in this study, we describe the effects of Hoxb13 overexpression in an organotypic system that employs rat epidermal keratinocytes (REKs) (26Lillie J.H. MacCallum D.K. Jepsen A. Exp. Cell Res. 1980; 125: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 27Tammi R.H. Tammi M.I. Hascall V.C. Hogg M. Pasonen S. MacCallum D.K. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 113: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). There are three significant advantages to using this rodent cell line as opposed to primary human keratinocytes or immortalized human cell lines. First, REKs can be stably transfected. Second, when lifted to the air-liquid interface, REKs fully stratify and differentiate, expressing all of the morphological and molecular markers normally observed in epidermis in vivo (25Passi A. Sadeghi P. Kawamura H. Anand S. Sato N. White L.E. Hascall V.C. Maytin E.V. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 296: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Third, REKs grow and stratify without any need for fibroblast coculture. Here we show that overexpression of Hoxb13 dramatically alters the normal REK differentiation program as evidenced by abnormal accumulation of the cornified envelope, complete loss of the suprabasal granular layer, and several other morphological abnormalities that can also be observed in diseased skin. Together, these data support a role for Hoxb13 in suppressing proliferation, promoting apoptosis, and driving epidermal differentiation, and they strengthen the possibility that Hoxb13 is involved in wound repair and in the pathogenesis of certain skin diseases. Generation of REK-Hoxb13 Stable Cell Lines—Full-length Hoxb13 in the pCMV-SPORTS6 expression vector (Open Biosystems) was sub-cloned into the retroviral vector pLPC. pLPC is a derivative of pLNCX (BD Biosciences). Either pLPCHoxb13 or pLPC alone was cotransfected with pCGP (encoding gag-pol) and pVSV-G (Stratagene) into 293T cells. At 48 h post-transfection, viral particles were harvested, filtered, and mixed with an equal volume of growth medium in the presence of 4 μg/ml polybrene. 1 ml of the mix was added onto 5 × 103 REK cells per well in a 24-well plate and the cells spin-inoculated at 2500 rpm for 1 h at room temperature. At 48 h post-transduction, the cells were trypsinized and seeded into 35-mm tissue culture dishes. Puromycin-resistant cells were obtained after a week of selection in 2 μg/ml puromycin. Cells were pooled and seeded onto three 96-well plates at a density of one cell/well and grown for 2 weeks in medium containing 1 μg/ml puromycin. The presence of the retroviral vector or of Hoxb13 in the resultant clones was confirmed by RT-PCR. Detection of Hoxb13 in Transiently Transfected REKs—Hoxb13 expression and cellular localization were examined by transiently transfecting REKs with a pLPCGFP-Hoxb13 fusion construct or with pLPCGFP alone using GenePORTER™ Transfection Reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, Inc.). Cells were examined using a Leica DMIL microscope and images captured with a Nikon E990 digital camera. REK Lift Cultures—REK lift cultures were done according to the method described in Passi et al. (25Passi A. Sadeghi P. Kawamura H. Anand S. Sato N. White L.E. Hascall V.C. Maytin E.V. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 296: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and Tammi et al. (27Tammi R.H. Tammi M.I. Hascall V.C. Hogg M. Pasonen S. MacCallum D.K. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 113: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, the collagen substrate was prepared using rat-tail collagen type I (BD Biosciences). 1 ml of the soluble collagen mixture was transferred into each tissue culture well on a nylon insert (Costar Transwell; 24-mm diameter, 3.0-μm pore size), and polymerized for 3 h at 37 °C. For preparation of the basement membrane, Maden Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were directly plated onto the collagen surface, grown for 18-22 days, lysed, and removed. Control pLPC REKs or pLPCHoxb13 REKs were plated onto the basement membrane surface covering the collagen substrate, grown in submerged culture for 2 days, then raised to the air-liquid interface, and incubated for an additional 5 days. H&E Staining and Immunohistochemistry—5-day REK lift cultures were fixed in Histochoice Tissue Fixative MB (Amresco, code H120-1L) overnight at 4 °C, dehydrated in isoparaffinic alcohols (Richard-Allan Scientific), and embedded in paraffin. 5-μm sections were cut and then dried overnight at 40 °C. H&E staining and immunohistochemistry were done using standard protocols. Primary antibodies utilized in this study were rabbit monoclonal antibody Ki-67 (1:200, NeoMarker, Inc.), rabbit anti-mouse K10 (1:500, BabCO), goat anti-rat filaggrin (1:2000, a generous gift from Dr. Beverly Dale-Crunk), and rabbit anti-mouse loricrin (1:500, BabCO). Immunofluorescent detection of HA was performed using aggrecan-derived biotinylated hyaluronan-binding protein (HABP; Seigagaku) as previously described (25Passi A. Sadeghi P. Kawamura H. Anand S.

Histochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 113: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Sections were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Inc.), viewed with an Olympus BX50 microscope with epifluorescence attachments, and images captured digitally using a Polaroid DMC-2 camera system. TUNEL Staining—Sections were labeled using the In Situ Cell Death Detection kit, POD (Roche Applied Science) per the manufacturer's protocol with minor modifications. Tissue sections were permeabilized with nuclease-free proteinase K (20 μg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; Sigma-Aldrich) following incubation with the TUNEL reaction. Sections were mounted in Vectashield and viewed under epifluorescence as described above. Preparation of mRNA and cDNA—Total mRNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's protocol and quantified. First-strand cDNA synthesis was done using the Super-Script™ RNase H-Reverse Transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. 2 μg of total mRNA were used with either oligo(dT)20 primers (50 μm; Invitrogen) or random oligo primers (Invitrogen). Identical controls with no reverse transcriptase were prepared at the same time. Preparation of Protein Samples—REK tissues from submerged or lift cultures were harvested, lysed, centrifuged, and the supernatants transferred to fresh tubes. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay based on the method of Bradford. RT-PCR—Primers were designed using Primer3 and synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. The sequences were as follows: Hoxb13: forward, 5′-CTCCAGGTCCTGTGCCTTAT-3′; reverse, 5′-ACTGGCCATAGGCTGGTATG-3′; 206 bp; K10: forward, 5-CTGGAGGAACAACTGCAACA-3′; reverse, 5′-TTGGGTTTGGGTAAGCTTTG-3′; 210 bp; Filaggrin: forward, 5′-GGACACCCCCAGGTGTACTA-3′; reverse, 5′-GGTGCTGTCGCTATCCTGTT-5′; 231 bp; TGase 1: forward, 5′-AATACAAGCCCCACCTTGTG-3′; reverse, 5′-CACCTCGAAATGCCATAGGT-3′; 481 bp; TGase2: forward, 5′-GAAGGACACGGTTAGGGTGA-3′; reverse, 5′-GGTGTGCTTACCAAGGAGGA-3′; 387 bp; TGase 3: forward, 5′-CCAGGCTCAGTTACGAAAGC-3′; reverse, 5′-GCAGGGAATTTATTGCAGGA-3′; 237 bp; TGase 5: forward, 5′-GGAGTCCTCAAACCGCATAA-3′; reverse, 5′-ACCGCTGAGCTAATTCTCCA-3′; 225 bp; Actin: forward, 5′-CACTGGCATTGTGATGGACTCC-3′; reverse, 5′-GACTCATCGTACTCCTGCTTGC-3′; 650 bp; 18S: forward, 5′-CTCGCTCCTCTCCTACTTGG-3′; reverse, 5′-TCTGATAAATGCACGCATCC-3′; 102 BP; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 0.45 kb, Control Amplifier Set (BD Biosciences). Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were electrophoresed on precast NuPAGE™ 4-12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and blotted according to standard protocol. Blots were blocked for 1 h at room temperature (blocking buffer: 5% milk, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), then incubated overnight with primary antibody in blocking buffer at 4 °C. Primary antibody concentrations: rabbit anti-mouse K10, 1:3000-5000 (BabCO); rabbit anti-mouse filaggrin, 1:1000 (BabCO); rabbit anti-mouse loricrin, 1:1000 (BabCO). Corneocyte Analysis—Quantification of cornified envelope formation was done according to the method of Steven and Steinert (28Steven A.C. Steinert P.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 693-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pLPC or pLPCHoxb13 REKs were plated at an equal density. After a 48 h period, cells shed into the culture medium were combined with those released from the dish by trypsinization, counted, collected by centrifugation, and lysed. Aliquots of the lysed samples were placed on a hemacytometer, and the total numbers of corneocytes determined for each clone. Data from the pLPC and pLPCHoxb13 clones were pooled separately, and the results presented as percent cornified cells per total cell number. Fluorescein-Cadaverine Uptake Study—pLPC control and pLP-CHoxb13 clones were grown in lift culture as described above. At 5-days post-lift, medium containing 100 μm fluorescein-cadaverine (CadavF, Molecular Probes) or an equimolar amount of fluorescein (Molecular Probes) was added to the cultures, which were then incubated an additional 4 h and mounted in OTC (Electron Microscopy Sciences). 5-μm frozen sections were air-dried and fixed in methanol. Sections were mounted in Vectashield, viewed with an Oympus BX50 microscope, and images captured using a Polaroid DMC-2 camera system. Statistics—All statistical analyses were performed using the Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Values are presented as means ± S.E. Hoxb13 Is Differentially Expressed in REK Lift Cultures—To begin our study of Hoxb13 in epidermal differentiation, we examined the expression pattern of Hoxb13 in REK lift cultures over time (Fig. 1A). At time 0 of lift, Hoxb13 is expressed at relatively low levels. By 3 h, the expression level increases, reaching a maximum at 12 h post-lift. After this point, Hoxb13 expression levels gradually subside, and by 120 h post-lift, a time when REKs are fully stratified (25Passi A. Sadeghi P. Kawamura H. Anand S. Sato N. White L.E. Hascall V.C. Maytin E.V. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 296: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), no significant message is detected. The dynamic expression pattern of Hoxb13 in REK lift culture suggests that it may participate in REK differentiation. Hoxb13 Translocates to the Nucleus and Is Overexpressed in Stably Transfected REKs—A large body of evidence supports a role for Hox proteins as transcription factors. Nuclear localization of Hoxb13 in REKs was evaluated in cells transiently transfected with a retroviral vector (pLPC) expressing either a GFP-Hoxb13 fusion protein, or GFP alone. In cells expressing only GFP, fluorescence was restricted to the cytoplasm (Fig. 1B, left panel). In cells expressing GFP-Hoxb13, fluorescence was strictly nuclear (Fig. 1B, right panel), supporting a role for Hoxb13 as a transcription factor in keratinocytes. We then generated stable REK clones carrying the pLPC vector alone (control clones) or full-length Hoxb13 (experimental clones). Six clones were chosen for analysis; control clones 10, 25, and 30 and Hoxb13 clones 13, 36, and 41 (Fig. 1C). The clones were grown for 5 days in lift culture and then evaluated for Hoxb13 expression. Whereas there was no detectable message at day 5 post-lift in the vector-only controls (similar to untransfected cells, e.g. Fig. 1A), Hoxb13 was highly expressed in the experimental clones at day 5 post-lift (Fig. 1C). Overexpression of Hoxb13 in REK Lift Culture Dramatically Alters the Normal Differentiation Program—When grown at the air-liquid interface, REKs stratify and differentiate, producing the same morphologically distinct layers of the epidermis that are observed in vivo (25Passi A. Sadeghi P. Kawamura H. Anand S. Sato N. White L.E. Hascall V.C. Maytin E.V. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 296: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 27Tammi R.H. Tammi M.I. Hascall V.C. Hogg M. Pasonen S. MacCallum D.K. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 113: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We first determined that the differentiation program was not altered in REKs stably transfected with the vector alone. Fig. 2A shows an H&E-stained section of a vector-only control (clone 10) obtained after 5 days in lift culture. The normal morphological phenotype, identical to that observed in untransfected REKs (25Passi A. Sadeghi P. Kawamura H. Anand S. Sato N. White L.E. Hascall V.C. Maytin E.V. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 296: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), features a well formed basal, spinous and cornified layer (Fig. 2A), and the presence of discrete keratohyalin granules in the granular layer (white arrows). Identical results were obtained with control clones 25 and 30 (data not shown). In contrast to the vector-only controls, overexpression of Hoxb13 in lift culture, as shown with clones 13 and 36, profoundly affected the overall epidermal phenotype (see Fig. 2, B, B′ and C, C′). The first notable change was an increase in overall thickness in the Hoxb13-overexpressing tissue. Other abnormal phenotypic features were a severely disorganized basal layer (yellow asterisks), an occasional suprabasal mitotic figure (m), complete absence of a granular layer (upward white arrows) and an abnormal accumulation of what appeared to be cornified tissue (white asterisks) in which numerous nuclei were retained (parakeratosis; p). Overexpression of Hoxb13 Results in Decreased Proliferation and Increased Apoptosis—Given the apparent overall thickening of the Hoxb13-overexpressing lift cultures, we asked whether increased cellular proliferation versus decreased cellular loss (via retention of cornified keratinocytes) might be responsible for the increased epidermal thickness observed. To evaluate the effect of Hoxb13 on cell division, we stained 5-day lift tissue with the proliferation marker, Ki-67 (Fig. 3, A and B). We observed a 2-fold reduction in the number of proliferating cells in the Hoxb13-overexpressing clones, as quantified by counts of Ki-67-positive cells (Fig. 3F). Clearly, epidermal thickening in the Hoxb13 lift cultures cannot be attributed to enhanced cell proliferation in the Hoxb13 clones. Rather, suppression of cell proliferation by Hoxb13 would be consistent with a role in promoting growth arrest and subsequent cellular differentiation, as has been reported for Hoxb13 in epithelial cells of the prostate (29Jung C. Kim R.S. Lee S.J. Wang C. Jeng M.H. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3046-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Another striking abnormality observed in Hoxb13-overexpressing lift cultures was the presence of numerous apoptotic cells, characterized on H&E stains by their shrunken size, condensed nucleus, and pink cytoplasmic staining (e.g. see Fig. 2, B and C′). To confirm this morphologic finding, we used TUNEL staining, which demonstrated a large increase in cells with degraded nuclear DNA (compare Fig. 3, C and D). In the vector-only tissue, as shown in clone 10 (Fig. 3C), a few TUNEL-positive cells were detected in the region of the granular/cornified layers, as expected. In contrast, Hoxb13 clones, as shown in clone 36 (Fig. 3D), showed numerous cells that were TUNEL-positive in both the basal and suprabasal layers. Cell counts of all the clones demonstrated a significant, >5-fold increase in the prevalence of apoptotic cells in the Hoxb13-driven cultures (Fig. 3E). The Detection of Epidermal Differentiation Markers Is Significantly Reduced in Hoxb13-overexpressing REKs—We previously reported that the expression levels of several epidermal differentiation markers were significantly reduced in murine Hoxb13 knock-out skin as assayed by microarray analysis (24Mack J.A. Abramson S.R. Ben Y. Coffin J.C. Rothrock J.K. Maytin E.V. Hascall V.C. Largman C. Stelnicki E.J. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1352-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Here, we utilized immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and Western blot analyses to examine the effects of Hoxb13 overexpression upon epidermal marker expression in REK 5-day lift cultures. Fig. 4A shows immunostaining for the intermediate differentiation marker keratin 10 (K10) and the late differentiation markers filaggrin and loricrin. In the vector-only control (clone 10), K10 staining was robust and confined to the suprabasal and granular layers, excluding the cornified layer. Filaggrin and loricrin staining were confined to the region of the granular layer. The expression patterns for all three proteins are identical to those seen in untransfected REKs and in mouse epidermis in vivo (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with the other vector-only controls (data not shown). In contrast to the control clones, expression levels of K10, filaggrin, and loricrin in the Hoxb13 overexpression clones were significantly reduced after 5 days in lift culture (Fig. 4A, clones 13 and 36). Occasional areas of detectable staining were focal and sparse when examining the entire length of the tissue. Western blot analyses of protein from the 5-day lift tissue gave results in agreement with the immunohistochemical data. Abundant K10, filaggrin, and loricrin signals, detected in the three control clones, were lost in the Hoxb13-overexpressing clones (Fig. 4B). An analysis of K10 and filaggrin transcriptional activity revealed that the mRNA levels were the same or only slightly reduced in Hoxb13-overexpressing clones, as compared with controls (Fig. 4C). Thus, mRNA levels in individual Hoxb13 clones did not appear at face value to correlate with the amounts of protein detected in the Western blot"

By sequence similarity, Ro52 belongs to the RING-B-box-coiled-coil (RBCC) protein family.

The linker region between the RING and B-box motifs is crucial for full folding, and Zn2+ affinity of the RING-B-box region is further protected in the entire RBCC region and appears to interact with the coiled-coil region. Murine monoclonal antibodies raised toward the RING-B-box region were primarily directed toward the linker, further supporting a highly functional role for the linker in a cellular environment.

Taken together with our previous analysis of autoantigenic epitopes in the coiled-coil region, localization of autoantigenic epitopes in Ro52 appears closely related to molecular functionalities. Ro52 is one of the main autoantigens in Sjögren syndrome, but autoantibodies to this intracellular protein occur also in systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis (1Wahren M. Tengner P. Gunnarsson I. Lundberg I. Hedfors E. Ringertz N.R. Pettersson I. J. Autoimmun. 1998; 11: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The immunodominant epitopes in Ro52 are predominantly localized in the structurally stable regions (2Ottosson L. Hennig J. Moshref A. Wahren-Herlenius M. Sunnerhagen M. Mol. Immunol. 2005; Google Scholar). The Ro52 coiled-coil contains a putative leucine-zipper between residues 211 and 232. Patient-derived monoclonal antibodies that bind to a peptide representing residues 200-239 (p200) of the Ro52 protein cause accumulating intracellular calcium levels in neonatal cardiomyocytes and relate to the development of congenital heart block (3Wahren M.

Another antigenic epitope has been mapped to the N-terminal Zn2+-binding region of Ro52 (6Pourmand N. Pettersson I. J. Autoimmunol. 1998; 11: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and was also suggested to relate to development of congenital heart block (7Buyon J.P. Slade S.G. Reveille J.D. Hamel J.C. Chan E.K. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3675-3684PubMed Google Scholar). However, the detailed location of the epitope in this 15-kDa region is yet unknown. The epitope is presumably conformation-dependent, because antigenicity is only observed in the reduced state (6Pourmand N. Pettersson I. J. Autoimmunol. 1998; 11: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and because cysteines are conserved in the suggested Zn2+-binding sites. The reason why Ro52 is targeted in autoimmune disease is not known to date. Ro52 belongs to the rapidly growing RING/B-box/coiled-coil (RBCC) 2The abbreviations used are: RBCC, Ring-B-box-coiled-coil; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; ACN, acetonitrile.2The abbreviations used are: RBCC, Ring-B-box-coiled-coil; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; ACN, acetonitrile. family, also denoted as TRIM (tripartite motif) (8Reymond A.

The Ro52 RBCC region consists of an N-terminal Zn2+-binding region, containing a RING finger and a B-box, followed by a coiled-coil region. At the C terminus of the Ro52 RBCC region, a well conserved B30.2 domain is not yet associated with any defined function (13Ponting C. Schultz J. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 193-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 14Henry J. Ribouchon M-T. Offer C. Pontarotti P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that Ro52 is involved in transcriptional regulation (15Frank M.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 16Wang D. Buyon J.P. Yang Z. Di Donato F. Miranda-Carus M.E. Chan E.K.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1568: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and mono-ubiquitination of Ro52 (17Fukuda-Kamitani T. Kamitani T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 774-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), as well as interaction with a deubiquitinating enzyme, has been shown (18Di Donato F. Chan E.K. Askanase A.D. Miranda-Carus M. Buyon J.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell. Biol. 2001; 33: 924-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Still, the function of Ro52 remains to be defined and might shed light on its targeting in autoimmune disease. Because the two main Ro52 epitopes in systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjögren syndrome are both conformation-dependent, understanding the structure of Ro52 could suggest molecular reasons for the erroneous recognition. However, the low solubility of native, intact Ro52, as well as of Ro52 RING-B-box and RBCC subcloned protein constructs (∼50 μm; Ref. 2Ottosson L. Hennig J. Moshref A. Wahren-Herlenius M. Sunnerhagen M. Mol. Immunol. 2005; Google Scholar), makes three-dimensional structure determination of Ro52 difficult. Indeed, little is known about the molecular and structural organization of proteins in the entire RBCC family, perhaps due to experimental limitations also for other RBCC proteins. Previous bioinformatic analysis has identified high conservation and similarity between different RBCC proteins in general and their subdomains in particular, where RING and B-box domains show similarities above 40% (8Reymond A. Meroni G. Fantozzi A. Merla G. Cairo S. Luzi L. Riganelli D. Zanaria E. Messali S. Cainarca S. Guffanti A. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Ballabio A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2140-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). The conserved arrangement of the domains in the RBCC region suggests that these could form a functional entity. In agreement with this, we have shown that the Ro52 RING-B-box region and the coiled-coil fold as independent units, whereas the C-terminal B30.2 region, which is not included in the RBCC motif, is unstable (2Ottosson L. Hennig J. Moshref A. Wahren-Herlenius M. Sunnerhagen M. Mol. Immunol. 2005; Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that RBCC proteins may be involved in homo- and hetero-oligomerization (19Peng H. Begg G.E. Schultz D.C. Freidman J.R. Jensen D.E. Speicher D.W. Rauscher III, F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1139-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 20Peng H. Feldman I.

BMC Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, the role of Zn2+ binding in governing the specificity of such RBCC interactions, and how different subdomains within the RBCC motif participate on a molecular level, is not yet known. While keeping in mind that the RBCC region appears to be a functional entity, structural information regarding its building blocks are available. The RING is a cysteine-rich Zn2+-binding motif of the form C3HC4 (22Krishna S.S. Majumdar I. Grishin N.V.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6894) Google Scholar). In the RAG1 and BRCA1 proteins, the RING forms a homodimerization (25Bellon S. Rodgers K. Schatz D. Coleman J. Steitz T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 586-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and heterodimerization (27Brzovic P.S. Rajapogal P. Hoyt D.W. King M.-C. Klevit R.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) interface, respectively. A general biological role for RINGs was suggested to be the building of macromolecular scaffolds for enhancements of biochemical reactions such as ubiquitination (33Kentsis A. Gordon R.E. Borden K.L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 34Kentsis A. Gordon R.E. Borden K.L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15404-15409Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The second Zn2+-binding motif of RBCC proteins, the B-box, is so far only identified in RBCC proteins (8Reymond A. Meroni G. Fantozzi A. Merla G. Cairo S. Luzi L. Riganelli D. Zanaria E. Messali S. Cainarca S. Guffanti A. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Ballabio A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2140-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar) and has the form CHC3H2 (35Borden K.L.B. Martin S.R. O'Reilly N.J. Lally J.M. Reddy B.A. Etkin L.D. Freemont P.S. FEBS. 1993; 335: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the structure of the B-box in the RBCC protein XNF7, four of seven putative ligands bind to only one Zn2+ ion in a tetrahedral manner, whereas the remaining three ligands are unoccupied (36Borden K.L.B. Lally J.M. Martin S.R. O'Reilly N.J. Etkin L.D. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5947-5956Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The coiled-coil motif occurs with high frequency in proteins (2-3%) and is responsible for the formation of supercoiled dimers, trimers, and tetramers depending on sequence constraints and biological context (37Burkhard P. Stetefeld J. Strelkov S.V. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 82-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Increased understanding of the basis for autoimmune targeting of Ro52 requires knowledge of molecular connections between targeting by patient antibodies and structural properties. We have already successfully dissected such connections for an autoimmune epitope in the Ro52 coiled-coil region (2Ottosson L. Hennig J. Moshref A. Wahren-Herlenius M. Sunnerhagen M. Mol. Immunol. 2005; Google Scholar, 5Salomonsson S. Sonesson S.-E. Ottosson L. Muhallab S. Olsson T. Sunnerhagen M. Kuchroo V.K. Thorén P. Herlenius E. Wahren-Herlenius M. J. Exp.

Immunol. 2005; 61: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, the recognition of the conformation-dependent autoantigenic epitope in the RING-B-box region of Ro52 is far less understood. Such knowledge is crucial both for understanding autoimmune disease development and for designing novel biotherapies and diagnostics in this field (39Wahren-Herlenius M. Muller S. Isenberg D. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 234-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 40Wahren-Herlenius M. Kuchroo V.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1205-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to resolve in molecular detail the antigenic properties and structural organization of the Ro52 RING-B-box motif, and how these are affected by Zn2+ binding. To this end, biophysical and immunological methods, tailored to the properties of the protein, were used jointly in a complementary way. We found that the same region that houses a conserved, dominant autoantigenic epitope in the RING-B-box region is also of fundamental importance to Ro52 folding and Zn2+ binding. Thus, the current investigation contributes to the understanding of the coupling between structural and biological properties of Ro52 in particular and in RBCC proteins in general. Expression and Purification of Ro52 Constructs—Ro52 RING-B-box (residues His6-(1-128)) and RBCC (His6-(1-258)) proteins were expressed, purified, and refolded as described elsewhere (2Ottosson L. Hennig J. Moshref A. Wahren-Herlenius M. Sunnerhagen M. Mol. Immunol. 2005; Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were estimated by UV spectroscopy at 280 nm. Experimentally determined extinction coefficients (41Gill S.C. Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5052) Google Scholar) were 32669 cm-1 m-1 for the RBCC and 13366 cm-1 m-1 for the RING-B-box region. Peptide Synthesis—All peptides were synthesized by Fmoc chemistry using solid-phase (Fmoc-PAL-PEG-PS, Applied Biosystems) on an Applied Biosystems Pioneer Peptide Synthesis System. Protected amino acids were supplied from Novabiochem, and trifluoroacetic acid was used to cleave the peptide from the resin and remove side-chain protection groups. Cysteine side chains were protected with acetamidomethyl protection groups subsequently removed with Hg(II)Ac (42Veber D. Milkowski J. Varga S. Denkewalter R. Hirschmann R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 5456-5461Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). An excess of dithiothreitol was used in order to ensure reduced cysteines in the resulting peptide as well as efficient removal of Hg2+, which otherwise bound strongly to the peptides. High pressure liquid chromatography and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry were used for peptide identification and purification (>95%), and mass spectra for the RING finger peptide, B-box peptide, and the RB linker peptide showed peaks with 5403, 4076, and 3862 Da, respectively, in agreement with the theoretical masses. Experimental extinction coefficients (41Gill S.C. Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5052) Google Scholar), 18,714 cm-1 m-1 for the RING finger and 6759 cm-1 m-1 for the B-box, were used for concentration determination by UV light. The concentration of the RB linker peptide was estimated by weight/volume because of the absence of strongly absorbing groups. Purified peptides were lyophilized and stored at -20 °C. Limited Proteolysis, Collection, and Analysis of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Data—Purified Ro52 RING-B-box and Ro52 RBCC in 50 mm Tris, 100 mm KCl, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 9 and 8, respectively, were quantified and used directly in limited proteolysis experiments with trypsin (Sigma, T-4665). Range-finding experiments were done to optimize protease:protein ratios for following the degradation of protein and accumulation of subsequent protein fragments (43Carey J. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 499-514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the time course experiment, reactions were stopped after 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 min by adding 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid solution in a 1:1 ratio, followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation (44Kriwacki R.W. Wu J. Tennant L. Wright P.E. Siuzdak G. J. Chromatogr. A. 1997; 777: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and reconstituted in 20 μl of 50% acetonitrile (ACN), 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid solution. C18 ZipTips (Millipore) were used for concentration and purification of the samples before MALDI analysis. The ZipTips were washed three times with 50% ACN, 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid and acidified with 5× 10 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid solution before the sample solution was applied (20 times). After washing three times with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, the sample was eluted with 20 μl of 50% ACN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid solution. A saturated matrix solution was prepared by dissolving ∼50 mg of α-cyanocinnamic acid in 50% ACN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid solution. Matrix was mixed with samples in a 1:1 ratio and spotted immediately on a MALDI sample plate in duplicates. Mass spectra were acquired in duplicates on a PE Biosystems Voyager MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer equipped with a nitrogen laser. To ensure that the ion yield and ion distribution are representative of the entire sample spot, the laser was rastored across the sample spot, averaging 500 laser shots per spectrum. Base-line correction and integration of peaks were performed by using the Applied Biosystems Data Explorer program, version 4.0.0.0. Identification of peptide fragments was performed from the mass of the fragments and the known specificity of trypsin with assistance of the ProteinProspector (see Ref. 45Clauser K.R. Baker P.R. Burlingame A.L. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2871-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar; prospector.ucsf.edu). Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy Studies—Circular dichroism spectroscopy was performed on a Jobin Yvon-Spex CD 6. For Zn2+ binding experiments, all synthesized peptides were reconstituted from the lyophilized powder with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. Spectra were acquired immediately and at 5 °C to reduce the risk of disulfide formation. Peptide concentrations ranged from 5 to 10 μm and with corresponding equivalent metal ion concentrations. Spectra were recorded between 190 and 260 nm with an increment of 0.5 nm. The RING-B-box was measured in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 9 (2Ottosson L. Hennig J. Moshref A. Wahren-Herlenius M. Sunnerhagen M. Mol. Immunol. 2005; Google Scholar), whereas the RING and the B-box peptides were assayed at pH 6.5 to avoid Zn2+-hydroxide precipitation. Spectral evaluation and calculation of secondary structure content were performed using DICHROWEB (46Lobley A. Whitmore L.

Wachter E. Wallace B.A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4960-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, was chosen. Fluorescence Spectrophotometry Studies—Fluorescence emission spectra were conducted on a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer for the B-box peptide, and on a Jobin Yvon-Spex FluoroMax-2 for the RING finger peptide and RING-B-box region. The buffer was 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, with 5% glycerol added for the RING finger and the RING-B-box. Spectra were acquired at 5 °C in a 1-cm path length quartz cell. Emission spectra were excited at 290 nm. Each scan was base line-corrected and volume-corrected prior to tabulating the data. In Zn2+ titration experiments, the concentrations for the RING finger, B-box peptide, and the RING-B-box region were 15, 15, and 19 μm, respectively. B-box titrations were carried out manually, and emission intensities at maximum emission wavelength (350 nm) were recorded. Titrations of the RING finger and RING-B-box region were done automatically with a Hamilton Microlab 1000 titrator, adding 1 μl of a 3 mm ZnCl2 solution into 2 ml of sample solution every 4 s until saturation was reached. Emission was measured every second at maximum emission wavelength (350 nm for the RB region and 357 nm for the RING finger peptide). Binding constant determinations and binding curve fits were calculated using the CALIGATOR program (www.bpc.lu.se/research/caligator, see Ref. 57André I. Linse S. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 305: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Sequence Analysis—Similarity searches on the consensus Ro52 RING-B-box region (residues 1-123) were made by BLAST (58Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59856) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments of mouse and human Ro52 together with 19 other RBCC/TRIM proteins were done with ClustalW (59Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55709) Google Scholar).

Monoclonal antibodies to Ro52 were developed by standard protocols by fusing spleen cells from mice immunized with recombinant Ro52 (38Ottosson L. Salomonsson S. Hennig J. Sonesson S.E. Dörner T.

Freeman G.J. Kuchroo V.K. Cell. Immunol. 2001; 213: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Resulting hybridoma were subcloned and characterized by Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using Ro52 deletion constructs (63Salomonsson S. Dörner T. Theander E. Bremme K. Larsson P. Wahren-Herlenius M. Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). ELISA of Ro52 Peptides and Fragments—ELISA was performed essentially according to standard procedures. In short, high binding 96-well plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg of peptide or recombinant protein in 100 μl of carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, per well. All subsequent steps were performed at room temperature. Plates were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20 (TPBS) and blocked with 200 μl of TPBS, 5% milk powder per well for 45 min. After three washings with TPBS, 100 μl of patient sera diluted 1:1,000 or mouse anti-human Ro52 hybridoma supernatant in TPBS, 1% milk powder was added, and the plates were incubated for at least 1 h. After washing three times with TPBS, the secondary antibody, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-human IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Dako) diluted 1:1,000 in TPBS, 1% milk powder was added, and the plates were incubated for 1 h. Plates were washed three times, and phosphatase substrate tablets (Sigma) dissolved in diethanolamine buffer, pH 9.6, was added. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm after 20 min. For ELISA with reduced antigens, the coated plates were incubated with reducing buffer (100 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, pH 6.8) for 1 h prior to blocking as described previously (6Pourmand N. Pettersson I. J. Autoimmunol. 1998; 11: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Sequence Analysis of the Zn2+-binding Region in Ro52—The Ro52 protein contains the RING finger, B-box, and coiled-coil domains of TRIM/RBCC proteins.

In chronic myelogenous leukemia cells, c-Abl expression is silenced by promoter methylation. In addition, the level of c-Abl needs to be tightly and constantly regulated due to its cytotoxicity and its rapid degradation after activation. Yet the regulation of c-Abl expression remains unclear. In an effort to gain better understanding of c-Abl function, we performed a glutathione S-transferase-Abl pull-down screen and identified TopBP1, a topoisomerase IIβ-binding protein that contains Brca1 C-terminal motifs and has been implicated in DNA damage response. Their physical interaction was verified by in vitro and in vivo assays with TopBP1 found as a substrate of Abl proteins. TopBP1 could repress the expression of c-Abl at both mRNA and protein levels. Reporter assays indicate that TopBP1 directly repressed the promoter activity of c-Abl. Furthermore, TopBP1 repressed expression of c-Abl through a novel mechanism that involved histone deacetylation and DNA methylation. This transcriptional repression was inhibited by c-Abl in a kinase-dependent manner. The dual antagonistic interplay between c-Abl and TopBP1 may also provide a mechanism for fine-tuning of c-Abl levels. Expression of BCR-ABL is the leading cause of chronic myelogenous leukemia.

Reciprocal translocation of chromosomes 9 and 21 in human results in expression of a fusion protein BCR-ABL, which is highly active as a tyrosine kinase and underlies the development of most CML cases (1Wong S.

Recently, Imatinib/STI571/Gleevec, a specific inhibitor for Abl, has been found to be clinically effective in CML treatment (2O'Dwyer M.E. Mauro M.J. Druker B.J. Annu. Rev.

Although great progress has been made in understanding the roles of BCR-ABL in the development of CML, the physiological function of c-Abl is still elusive. Accumulating evidence suggests that c-Abl is involved in genotoxic stress response, actin dynamics, and mitogenesis (3Hantschel O. Superti-Furga G. Nat. Rev. Mol.

In addition, BCR-ABL has been shown to play an important role in DNA damage response (17Dierov J. Dierova R. Carroll M. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 275-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanisms underlying the participation of c-Abl in DNA damage response remain an enigma, an increase in c-Abl levels via ectopic expression evidently leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (18Wen S.T.

The cells have evolved mechanisms to regulate the levels of c-Abl, such as protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and hypermethylation of c-Abl promoters (20Echarri A.

In CML cells, the expression of c-Abl is silenced by DNA methylation at the promoter regions of c-Abl, although the biological significance and the molecular mechanism of the repression are still unclear. A superfamily of about 40 BRCT-containing proteins has emerged as an important player in genotoxic stress response (23Bork P. Hofmann K. Bucher P. Neuwald A.F. Altschul S.F. Koonin E.V.

Some of the BRCT-containing proteins, such as Brca1 and TopBP1, assemble at the nuclear foci upon DNA damage (28Petrini J.H. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 1264-1269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), although the exact function of most of these proteins and their regulation are not well understood. To further understand the functions of c-Abl, we performed GST pull-down experiments in search of c-Abl-interacting proteins. We generated a GST-Abl fusion protein and used it for pull-down experiments against cell lysates from MC3T3-E1, a murine osteoblast cell line. The reason behind using an osteoblast cell line is based on our findings that c-Abl has been found to play vital roles in differentiation and oxidative stress response in osteoblasts and that c-Abl knock-out mice show osteoporosis (29Li B. Boast S. de Los S.K. Schieren I. Quiroz M. Teitelbaum S.L. Tondravi M.M. Goff S.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 30Li B. Wang X. Rasheed N. Hu Y. Boast S. Ishii T. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Goff S.P. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1824-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). TopBP1 was identified as one of the interacting proteins of c-Abl. We demonstrated a constitutive interaction between c-Abl and TopBP1. TopBP1 was an in vivo and in vitro substrate for c-Abl, especially upon DNA damage. Furthermore, we found that TopBP1 repressed c-Abl expression at the level of transcription, probably by recruiting histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). The repressive action of TopBP1 on c-Abl transcription was inhibited by c-Abl but not by kinase dead c-Abl, suggesting that this regulation was phosphorylation-dependent. These findings also imply that a feedback regulation loop exists to modulate c-Abl expression. Cell Culture and Transfection—Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were prepared as previously described (30Li B. Wang X. Rasheed N. Hu Y. Boast S. Ishii T. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Goff S.P. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1824-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). MEFs, MC3T3-E1, COS7, HeLa, and U2OS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and K562 cells in RPMI1640 media that were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cell transfection was carried out by liposome-mediated method with Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). GST Pull-down Assay—c-Abl or TopBP1 open reading frames were subcloned into pGEX2TK. These fusion proteins were induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and purified with GST beads. Cell lysates were prepared and incubated with GST fusion proteins at 4 °C overnight. The precipitates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Immunoprecipitation, Western blot analysis, and in vitro kinase assay IP and Western blots were performed as previously reported (30Li B. Wang X. Rasheed N. Hu Y. Boast S. Ishii T. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Goff S.P. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1824-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 31Li B. Cong F. Tan C.P. Wang S.X. Goff S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28870-28876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For kinase assays, c-Abl was immunoprecipitated from MEFs and washed thoroughly with TNEN buffer (plus 0.5% Triton X-100) 5 times followed by washing with the kinase buffer 2 times. GST-TopBP1 was incubated with c-Abl in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm MnCl2) containing [γ-32P]ATP or unlabeled ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, Luciferase Assay—1.5 kilobases of c-Abl promoter was cloned into pGL3 by restriction digestion of Mlu/Hind III. The expression constructs (2 μg of c-Abl, TopBP1, KD-c-Abl), the promoter plasmid (2 μg of pGL3-Abl-Luc), and 0.4 μg of Renilla plasmid were co-transfected into HeLa cells as described above. Cells were harvested 1-2 days later and lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega). The luciferase activity and Renilla activity were measured following the manufacturer's protocols. The luciferase activity was normalized against the Renilla activity. All assays were carried out in triplicate. Morpholino Oligomers and siRNA Inhibition of TopBP1 Expression—The morpholino oligomer used was AS 5′-TTGGGACACATCGCTGGTGGTGCAT. The control morpholino oligonucleotide was CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA (26Yamane K. Wu X. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). They were transiently transfected into HeLa cells following the manufacturer's procedures (Gene Tools, LLC), and after 24 h cells were harvested for Western blot analysis. The SMARTpool siRNAs for TopBP1 (purchased from Dharmacon) were used to transfect HeLa cells to knock down protein levels of TopBP1 following the manufacturer's protocols. Western blot was used to test the efficiency of siRNA. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR Assay—Total RNA was isolated from COS7 or HeLa cells by the TRIzol reagents (Invitrogen). 5 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Diagnostic). 2 μl of the total reaction was used in the PCR to assay for the presence of c-Abl mRNA using the following primers: forward, 5′-ACCAAGGGTGTGGTTCTGGACAGTACTGA; reverse, 5′-AATGTCGCTGATCTCCTTCACAGAGCTGAG (300 bps). The primers for β-actin were: forward, 5′-AGATGTGGATCAGCAAGCAG; reverse, 5′-GCGCAAGTTAGGTTTTGTCA (104 bp). The conditions to amplify c-Abl were 35 cycles of 94 °C (30 s), 57 °C (30 s), and 72 °C (1 min) followed by 72 °C for 10 min. TopBP1 Interacted with c-Abl in Vitro and in Vivo—The C′ terminal portion of c-Abl (containing the kinase, DNA binding, and actin binding domains, designated as fragments 1, 2, and 3) was fused to GST in pGEX2TK vector, and the proper fusion was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Fig. 1A). GST-Abl fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 cells and purified with GST beads. To perform a pull-down experiment, GST-Abl beads were mixed with total cell lysate from a murine osteoblast line MC3T3-E1 and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline and analyzed on SDS-PAGE gels followed by Coomassie Blue staining. It was found that several proteins were consistently precipitated by GST-Abl but not by GST alone in three repeated pull-down experiments. These protein bands were excised from the gels and sequenced by mass spectrometry. One band was identified as TopBP1 based on sequence homology and the size of the protein. TopBP1 is a 180-kDa protein containing eight BRCT repeats and is implicated in DNA damage-induced cell cycle control and apoptosis (26Yamane K. Wu X. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To confirm this interaction, three GST-Abl fusion proteins (F1-3) were used to precipitate TopBP1 overexpressed in MC3T3-E1 cells. It was found that fragments 1 and 2, but not fragment 3, were able to precipitate TopBP1, suggesting that the DNA binding domain of c-Abl plays an important role in interacting with TopBP1 (Fig. 1, B and C). Even though the input of F1 fragment in the pull-down experiment was much less than F2, similar amounts of TopBP1 were precipitated, suggesting that the F1 binds to TopBP1 better than F2 and that the kinase domain could also contribute to c-Abl-TopBP1 interaction. Because c-Abl is able to directly bind DNA and TopBP1 too has the potential for DNA binding, e.g. TopBP1 can bind to DNA double-stranded breaks, it is possible that DNA mediated the interaction between c-Abl and TopBP1. To exclude this possibility, the samples were treated with ethidium bromide to disrupt the double-stranded DNA structure. The interaction between c-Abl and TopBP1 was still observed under this condition (Fig. 1C, lower panel), suggesting a direct interaction. To confirm this interaction in vivo, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out. The constructs expressing c-Abl, TopBP1 (Myc-tagged), or c-Abl and TopBP1 were transfected into COS7 cells. TopBP1 and associated proteins were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate using a monoclonal anti-TopBP1 antibody and fractionated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels. It was found that c-Abl was in the precipitates brought down by TopBP1 (Fig. 1D). When TopBP1 was not expressed, no c-Abl was detected, suggesting a specific interaction. Reciprocally, TopBP1 was immunoprecipitated by anti-c-Abl antibodies only when c-Abl was co-expressed (Fig. 1E). These results indicate that c-Abl and TopBP1 do interact in vivo. We then determined whether the interaction between endogenous c-Abl and TopBP1 existed. TopBP1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-TopBP1 antibodies, and the possibly associated c-Abl was detected by anti-c-Abl antibodies on a Western blot. It was found that c-Abl was present in the precipitates carried down by anti-TopBP1 antibodies but not by control rabbit Ig G (Fig. 1F, left panel). Similarly, TopBP1 was found in association with c-Abl (Fig. 1F, right panel). This interaction was observed in several other cell lines tested. TopBP1 Also Interacted with the Kinase Domain of c-Abl and Was an in Vivo Substrate of Abl—We next determined which domain(s) of the c-Abl interacted with TopBP1 by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Truncated c-Abl fragments were individually co-transfected into COS7 cells with TopBP1 (Fig. 2A). TopBP1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibodies. The existence of c-Abl in the complex was detected on a Western blot with anti-Abl antibodies (recognizing the SH3 domain at the N′ terminus). It was found that c-Abl lacking actin binding domain or lacking both actin binding and DNA binding domains were still able to form a complex with TopBP1. When the kinase domain was further deleted, the interaction became undetectable (Fig. 2B). Note that several truncated c-Abl fragments were observed in co-IP experiments, suggesting that c-Abl is unstable (31Li B. Cong F. Tan C.P. Wang S.X. Goff S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28870-28876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the kinase domain of c-Abl was able to interact with TopBP1. Moreover, the protein level of F5 was much higher than F4, yet similar amounts of F4 and F5 were immunoprecipitated by TopBP1, confirming that the DNA binding domain contributed to c-Abl-TopBP1 interaction (Fig. 1B). Based upon the co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down results, we conclude that both the kinase and the DNA binding domains were able to bind TopBP1 (Figs. 1, A-C, and 2, A and B). Other proteins that interact with the kinase domain of c-Abl include proliferation-associated gene and Rb (4Van Etten R.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 179-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Having shown that TopBP1 interacted with the kinase and DNA binding domains of c-Abl, we then tested whether TopBP1 was a substrate for c-Abl. TopBP1 and increasing amounts of c-Abl were transfected into COS7 cells. TopBP1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-TopBP1 antibodies, and its tyrosine phosphorylation was detected by Western blot using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. It was found that c-Abl could tyrosine phosphorylate TopBP1 in a dose-dependent manner when coexpressed (Fig. 2C), whereas kinase-dead c-Abl failed to do so (data not shown). To determine whether TopBP1 is a direct Abl substrate under conditions where Abl is activated, e.g. DNA damage, we treated cells with adriamycin, a chemotherapeutic agent against a wide variety of cancers, and a topoisomerase II inhibitor that has been shown to induce single- and double-stranded DNA breaks (32Collins I. Weber A. Levens D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8437-8451Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar); an in vitro kinase assay was performed using GST-TopBP1 as a substrate. Serial deletion experiments revealed that the N′ portion of TopBP1 (containing the first four BRCT domains) was tyrosine-phosphorylated by c-Abl when co-expressed (data not shown). Endogenous c-Abl was immunoprecipitated from wild type MEFs with the c-Abl-/- MEF as a control (treated or untreated with 1 μm adriamycin for 4 h). GST-TopBP1 was purified and mixed with the beads in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and then fractionated onto a SDS-PAGE gel, dried, and exposed to x-ray films. It appeared that c-Abl can directly phosphorylate TopBP1 in vitro, and adriamycin treatment increased the kinase activity of c-Abl (Fig. 2D). Auto-phosphorylation of c-Abl was also observed (Fig. 2D). No phosphorylation was observed for c-Abl-/- MEFs. We then tested the phosphorylation of endogenous TopBP1 by c-Abl. We used MEF, U2OS, HeLa, and MC3T3-E1 cells for the experiments and found that tyrosine phosphorylation of TopBP1 was beyond detection on a Western blot (data not shown). This could be attributed to the fact that neither c-Abl nor TopBP1 was highly expressed in these cells. We then tried K562 cells that are known to carry highly activated BCR-ABL. K562 cells were treated with adriamycin for 1 or 4 h, and endogenous TopBP1 was immunoprecipitated. Tyrosine phosphorylation of TopBP1 was detected by Western blot analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. It was found that TopBP1 was indeed phosphorylated upon adriamycin treatment in K562 cells, especially after 1 h of treatment (Fig. 2E). Pretreating cells with a specific inhibitor for Abl kinases, STI571 (1 μm is sufficient to inhibit Abl activity, data not shown), abolished the phosphorylation (Fig. 2E), suggesting the phosphorylation of TopBP1 was carried out by BCR-ABL. Furthermore, it was found that endogenous TopBP1 and BCR-ABL formed a complex under this condition, justified by co-IP experiments (Fig. 2F). These data suggest that BCR-ABL can interact with TopBP1 and phosphorylate TopBP1 upon DNA damage. This could be achieved by BCR-ABL translocation to the nucleus where TopBP1 is located (17Dierov J. Dierova R. Carroll M. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 275-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that TopBP1 is a substrate of Abl in response to DNA damage. Ectopic Expression of TopBP1 Down-regulated Endogenous c-Abl Expression at the Protein Level—During co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we noted that expression of TopBP1 in COS7 cells led to a dramatic reduction in protein levels of endogenous c-Abl. To confirm this observation, we transfected COS7 cells with increasing amounts of DNA construct expressing TopBP1 for 24 h. Western blot analysis was used to detect the levels of endogenous c-Abl and overexpressed TopBP1. It was found that c-Abl almost disappeared in cells transfected with 1 μg of TopBP1 DNA (60-mm plates) (Fig. 3A). In addition, we found that the down-regulation of c-Abl is a rapid process. Cells were transfected with 2 μg of TopBP1 DNA and harvested at different time points. Because a minimum of 6 h of transfection was sufficient to down-regulate c-Abl, whereas p53 and protein kinase Cα remained unaltered (Fig. 3B) suggests a specific regulation of c-Abl by TopBP1. To exclude the possibility of a cell type-specific effect, we repeated the experiments in HeLa, a human cervical cancer cell line. It was found that overexpression of TopBP1 similarly down-regulated the levels of c-Abl (Fig. 3C). To test whether a reciprocal relationship existed, we transfected COS7 cells with increasing amounts of c-Abl-expressing construct and harvested cells after a 24-h post-transfection. The levels of TopBP1 were assessed by Western blot, and no significant difference was observed with increasing amounts of c-Abl expressed (Fig. 3D), suggesting that c-Abl does not affect TopBP1 expression. Knocking Down TopBP1 Released c-Abl Repression—We have shown that TopBP1 was sufficient to repress c-Abl expression. In fact, a severalfold increase in TopBP1 was able to repress c-Abl expression dramatically (Fig. 3, B and C). To test whether TopBP1 is required for normal expression of c-Abl, we knocked down the expression of TopBP1 using the morpholino antisense oligos (AS) (26Yamane K. Wu X. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These antisense oligos could significantly lower the protein levels of TopBP1 when transfected into HeLa cells (Fig. 4A). Re-probing the blot with anti-c-Abl antibodies revealed that c-Abl protein levels increased wherever TopBP1 is reduced (Fig. 4A). This inverse correlation strongly suggests that TopBP1 is required to repress c-Abl expression. When TopBP1 protein is lower or absent, the repression is released and, thus, increased c-Abl expression. To further support this conclusion, we repeated this knocking down experiment with siRNA in the presence of TopBP1 overexpression. It was observed that the siRNA was able to dramatically reduce the TopBP1 levels even when it was driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter, whereas the control siRNA did not (Fig. 4B). It was also observed that siRNA eliminated the repression of c-Abl by TopBP1 (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that TopBP1 could repress c-Abl expression at either the basal level or when overexpressed. TopBP1 Repressed c-Abl Expression at mRNA Levels—To determine whether TopBP1 overexpression would lead to a rapid degradation of c-Abl, which is known to be a substrate of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway when activated, we treated the TopBP1-transfected cells with a proteasome inhibitor MG132 to inhibit protein degradation. It was found that the addition of MG132 at the start of or 6 h post-transfection showed no significant effect on the down-regulation of c-Abl (Fig. 5A, and data not shown), suggesting that the decrease of c-Abl was not caused by accelerated degradation and that TopBP1 does not destabilize c-Abl. The regulation of c-Abl by TopBP1 might occur at an earlier stage than protein degradation, e.g. transcription. To test whether the regulation occurs at the level of transcription, the levels of c-Abl mRNA were first assessed by RT-PCR. Most human tissues and cell lines express two abundant mRNA species, type 1a (6 kilobases) and 1b (7 kilobases), as well as minor species (33Andrews III, D.F. Nemunaitis J.J. Singer J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6788-6792Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Primers were designed so that the two major species of c-Abl mRNA could be amplified. HeLa cells were transfected with TopBP1 construct, and total RNA was isolated at different time points. RT-PCR was carried out to determine the mRNA levels of c-Abl with and without TopBP1 expression. We found that ectopic expression of TopBP1 dramatically down-regulated the mRNA levels of c-Abl without affecting the levels of actin (Fig. 5B), suggesting that TopBP1 specifically represses the expression of endogenous c-Abl at the level of mRNA. However, overexpression of TopBP1 did not affect the expression of c-Abl when it is driven by cytomegalovirus promoter (Fig. 5C), suggesting that the promoter of c-Abl plays an important role in this down-regulation and that the regulation might occur at the level of transcription rather than at the level of mRNA stability. A similar role for TopBP1 in transcriptional repression of other genes has been recently reported. TopBP1 was found to interact with Miz1 and inhibited the transcription of c-Myc (34Herold S. Wanzel M. Beuger V. Frohme C. Beul D. Hillukkala T. Syvaoja J. Saluz H.P. Haenel F. Eilers M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 509-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Yet, how TopBP1 represses transcription of Myc is not understood. In another report TopBP1 was found to interact with E2F and inhibited the E2F target genes involved in apoptosis induction (35Liu K. Lin F.T. Ruppert J.M. Lin W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3287-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). TopBP1 Repressed c-Abl Promoter Activity—To further confirm that TopBP1 regulates c-Abl expression at the level of transcription, we generated a reporter construct by fusing the c-Abl 1b promoter to the luciferase open reading frame in vector pGL3. A 1.5-kilobase fragment (upstream of the 1b c-Abl cap site), which is conserved between human and mouse and contains multiple potential binding sites for transcription factors such as Sp1 (36Bernards A. Paskind M. Baltimore D. Oncogene. 1988; 2: 297-304PubMed Google Scholar), was synthesized by PCR, subcloned into pGL3 vector, and confirmed by sequencing. The construct gave rise to about a 6-fold increase in luciferase activity compared with the control construct. Co-expression of the TopBP1 led to a dosage-dependent reduction in luciferase activity (Fig. 5D), indicating that TopBP1 suppressed the promoter activity of c-Abl. Miz1, a TopBP1-interacting protein that recruits TopBP1 to the promoter to inhibit Myc expression, has no significant effect on c-Abl promoter activity (data not shown). Nor did E2F show any effect on c-Abl promoter activity (data not shown). These results suggest that Miz1 and E2F are not involved in repression of c-Abl transcription. Roles of Histone Deacetylation and DNA Methylation in Repressing of c-Abl Expression—There is no evidence to suggest that TopBP1 binds directly to specific cis elements of its target genes. Therefore, we speculate that an unidentified transcription factor brings TopBP1 to the transcription initiation complex, where TopBP1 might recruit transcription repressors such as Brg1/Brm or HDACs (37Liu K. Luo Y. Lin F.T. Lin W.C. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 673-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Unlike the E2F target genes, TopBP1 did not require Brg1/Brm to repress c-Abl expression, because TopBP1 similarly repressed the c-Abl expression in C33A cells, a cell line deficient for Brg1/Brm1 (37Liu K. Luo Y. Lin F.T. Lin W.C. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 673-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) (data not shown). On the other hand, using trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor for HDACs, we found that histone deacetylation was necessary for TopBP1 to repress c-Abl promoter, because TSA treatment abolished the repression on c-Abl by TopBP1 (Fig. 6, A and B). These results suggest that TopBP1 might repress c-Abl transcription by recruiting HDACs. Consistent with this result, an interaction between TopBP1 and HDAC1, but not HDAC2, -4, and -6, was observed in a co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, the c-Abl promoter is silenced by hypermethylation in CML myeloid cells (21Issa J.P. Kantarjian H. Mohan A. O'Brien S. Cortes J. Pierce S. Talpaz M. Blood. 1999; 93: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Asimakopoulos F.A. Shteper P.J. Krichevsky S. Fibach E. Polliack A. Rachmilewitz E. Ben Neriah Y. Ben Yehuda D. Blood. 1999; 94: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether a link exists between DNA methylation and TopBP1 repression of c-Abl, we studied the effects of TopBP1 overexpression on c-Abl expression in the presence of 5-azacytidine, a DNA methylation inhibitor. It was found that 5-azacytidine treatment up-regulated c-Abl expression in HeLa cells and that ectopic expression of TopBP1 failed to significantly down-regulate c-Abl mRNA levels in the presence of this methylation inhibitor (10 μm) (Fig. 6, D and E). These results taken together suggest that both histone deacetylation and DNA methylation played a role in TopBP1-induced repression on c-Abl transcription. Co-immunoprecipitation assays did not reveal an evident interaction between endogenous TopBP1 and DNA methyltransferase-1 (data not shown). c-Abl Negatively Regulated the Transcription Repressor Activity of TopBP1—Because c-Abl interacted with and phosphorylated TopBP1, we next tested whether c-Abl has any effect on TopBP1 activity in this reporter assay. Expression of c-Abl itself did not significantly alter the promoter activity of c-Abl (Fig. 7A). However, co-expression of c-Abl and TopBP1 abolished the repressive activity of TopBP1 as the promoter activity returned to the basal level, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation by c-Abl interfered with its activity in transcription repression. To prove this a kinase-dead c-Abl was co-expressed with TopBP1 in the reporter assay. It was found that the kinase-dead c-Abl alone did not alter the promoter activity and that it also failed to significantly alter the repressive activity of TopBP1 (Fig. 7A). Because kinase-dead c-Abl interacted with TopBP1 as well as normal c-Abl (Fig. 7B), it is conceivable that tyrosine phosphorylation of TopBP1 by c-Abl might somehow interfere with its transcription repressor activity. The future work is to identify the phosphorylation sites on TopBP1 and test the physiological function of these phosphorylations. This work is complicated by the nature of TopBP1, which contains 8 repeats of BRCT domains that distribute from the N′ terminus to the C′ terminus. We show here that c-Abl physically interacts with TopBP1 and that TopBP1 is a substrate of Abl proteins. Functionally, these two proteins appeared to display an antagonistic interplay. On the one hand, TopBP1 repressed c-Abl expression at the level of transcription. Overexpression of TopBP1 down-regulated c-Abl expression at both protein and mRNA levels and repressed the promoter activity of c-Abl. Knocking down TopBP1 led to an increase in c-Abl. On the other hand, c-Abl negatively regulated TopBP1 in its repression on c-Abl transcription, which required c-Abl kinase activity, because co-expression of c-Abl but not the kinase dead c-Abl blocked the repressive effect of TopBP1 on c-Abl promoter activity. How does TopBP1 repress the expression of c-Abl? Several reports have shown that TopBP1 could act as a transcriptional suppressor. It interacts with E2F and inhibits the expression of E2F target genes by recruiting Brg1/Brm; it also interacts with Miz1 and inhibits the expression of c-Myc (34Herold S. Wanzel M. Beuger V. Frohme C. Beul D. Hillukkala T. Syvaoja J. Saluz H.P. Haenel F. Eilers M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 509-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 37Liu K. Luo Y. Lin F.T. Lin W.C. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 673-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Yet TopBP1 repression of c-Abl was not mediated by Miz1 or E2F since neither showed any effect on c-Abl promoter activities. Nor does repression of c-Abl absolutely require Brg1/Brm since it could still occur in Brg1/Brm-deficient C33A cells. Our results instead suggest that TopBP1 might use a novel mechanism to repress c-Abl expression. We propose that TopBP1 might be recruited to the c-Abl promoter by an unidentified transcription factor. TopBP1 may then recruit HDACs and DNA methyltransferases to repress transcription. Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis. First, administration of the histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA blocked the repression on c-Abl promoter by TopBP1. Consistent with our results, HDAC has been found to interact with the BRCT motif (38Yarden R.I. Brody L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4983-4988Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and TopBP1 (Fig. 6C). Secondly, we found that the repression of TopBP1 on c-Abl expression was abolished when DNA methylation was inhibited, suggesting either that TopBP1 repressor function might require DNA methylation or that TopBP1 itself is involved in DNA methylation. Third, it has been reported that HDACs interact with DNA methyltransferases to synergistically repress gene expression (39Fuks F. Burgers W.A. Brehm A. Hughes-Davies L. Kouzarides T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 40Zhang Y. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bird A. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). This could be a novel mechanism by which TopBP1 represses gene expression and certainly warrants further investigation. Furthermore, the role for TopBP1 in silencing c-Abl may have some therapeutic implications, as silencing of c-Abl plays an important role in cell transformation under certain conditions (41Suzuki J.

Another interesting aspect of TopBP1 as a transcriptional repressor is that its target genes are mostly, if not all involved in apoptosis and/or cell cycle control. Although c-Myc is a protooncogene, it is also involved in apoptosis induction. E2F1 plays an essential role in S phase entry, and some of its target genes are also pro-apoptotic. Similarly, c-Abl is involved in both cell cycle control and apoptosis. Based upon our findings that c-Abl inhibited the function of TopBP1, we speculate that c-Abl may also regulate other TopBP1 target genes. Indeed c-Myc transcription has been reported to be regulated by c-Abl (42Furstoss O. Dorey K. Simon V. Barila D. Superti-Furga G. Roche S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 514-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Whether TopBP1 also mediates this regulation needs further investigation. TopBP1 is required for cell survival, as knocking down of TopBP1 by antisense oligos led to more cell death (26Yamane K. Wu X. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). It is likely that some of its target genes may mediate its pro-survival role. For example, the deficiency of TopBP1 might up-regulate the pro-apoptotic protein such as c-Abl, c-Myc. What is the significance of interaction between c-Abl and TopBP1? One possibility is to modulate c-Abl expression. c-Abl has to be tightly controlled since elevation in c-Abl levels can induce cell cycle arrest and/or programmed cell death (18Wen S.T. Jackson P.K. Van Etten R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1583-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 19Cong F. Goff S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13819-13824Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, c-Abl levels might fluctuate constantly since it is rapidly degraded once activated (20Echarri A. Pendergast A.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1759-1765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), e.g. by DNA damage or platelet-derived growth factor, and needs to be replenished. Therefore, cells require a mechanism to maintain a constant level of c-Abl. Based upon our results, we propose that upon activation, c-Abl will be degraded by proteasomes; at the same time, TopBP1, which is constitutively associated with c-Abl, will be phosphorylated, and in turn its repression on c-Abl is relieved, leading to increased c-Abl expression. This feedback regulation can augment c-Abl expression. Still, how cells terminate this amplification is currently unclear. Although TopBP1 was found to repress the expression of c-Abl, another BRCT-containing protein Brca1 was found to inhibit the kinase activity of c-Abl (14Foray N. Marot D. Randrianarison V. Venezia N.D. Picard D. Perricaudet M. Favaudon V. Jeggo P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4020-4032Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Hence, it appears that c-Abl action can be kept in check by at least two BRCT-containing proteins involved in DNA damage response. We thank Drs.
