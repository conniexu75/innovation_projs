https://openalex.org/W1768247331,"Several methods have been developed for following the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by catalase, but these either have not been sufficiently quantitative or have not proved rapid enough to yield reliable data during the critical 1st or 2nd minute of the reaction. Chemical procedures in which residual peroxide is titrated with permanganate (l-3) or an excess of permanganate is measured calorimetrically (4) are accurate except for reaction times of less than a minute, although Lemberg and Foulkes (5) developed a micromethod for obtaining data every 10 seconds (see also Ogura et al. (6)). Considerable variability is unavoidable, however, when samples must-be taken at such short intervals. The manometric method for measuring oxygen evolved from the system proved in detailed studies to be unsuited for following the rapid breakdown of peroxide in which a diffusion process across the liquid-air interface becomes limiting. This is manifested by changes in both the order of the reaction and the rate of evolution of oxygen with variations in the rate of agitation of the reaction mixture (7). Direct measurement of hydrogen peroxide by polarography provides good quantitative data during the 1st minute of the reaction which fit first order kinetics (8). However, an elaborate, special, electronic circuit is needed for such measurements. Furthermore, as pointed out by Bonmschen, Chance, and Theorell (8), this method appears to give lower values for catalase activity than do titration techniques. Preliminary experiments for following the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide by observing the decrease in light absorption of peroxide solutions in the ultraviolet were reported by Chance (9) and Chance and Herbert (10). The potentialities of this method have been investigated and a quantitative, spectrophotometric technique for following the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide has been developed for routine studies of catalase kinetics."

The incidence of cleft palate was found to vary with the genetic constitution of the treated mice, the dosage of cortisone used, and the gestational stage at which treatment was begun."

https://openalex.org/W1996559953,"VON DENFFER1 has recently suggested that the stimulus to flowering is not brought about by the production of a new flowering hormone (‘florigen’) but results from the sudden drop in production of a flower inhibitor substance (‘Blühhemmstoff’). We have been investigating the mode of action of the genes controlling the earliness or lateness of flowering in the garden pea, and have evidence that the late varieties are late because they produce an inhibitor which is absent from the earlies. We have used three varieties: Massey, which normally flowers about the ninth node; Richard Seddon, which flowers at about the fourteenth node; and Telephone, flowering at the seventeenth node. Pellew2 has suggested that a series of three multiple alleles, L, l1 and l2, determine these differences in flowering behaviour, the dominant L gene determining late flowering (eighteenth node). It is probable that our three varieties are respectively l2l2, l1l1 and LL. However, the genetical tests are not yet complete."

https://openalex.org/W2057397679,"IN a recent communication, Grigg1 has discussed the possibility of an interconidial inhibition in Neurospora, conidia of biochemically deficient mutant strains inhibiting the growth of wild-type conidia. It was demonstrated that large numbers of mutant conidia inhibit the growth of wild-type conidia by mixing varying concentrations of mutant conidia with small aliquots of wild-type conidia and subsequent plating on ‘minimal’ medium. The mutant conidia will not grow on minimal medium, although they germinate; the wild-type conidia should grow normally. Using, for example, an adenineless mutant (W40) of a macroconidial strain, 100 per cent inhibition of wild-type conidia was observed in the presence of 4 × 107 adenineless conidia per plate, whereas no inhibition was found in the presence of 2 × 107 adenineless conidia."

https://openalex.org/W2983545872,"IN a letter under this title, Prof. C. H. Waddington1 has described an interesting selection experiment with a Drosophila phenocopy of ‘crossveinless’. He has demonstrated clearly that the phenocopic effect, at any rate in this case, depends on individual genetic constitution as well as on the shock treatment applied to the pupæ—a fact realized by Goldschmidt2 for phenocopies in general, but not followed up as Prof. Waddington has done. Analogous results have been obtained in this laboratory using the mutant ‘antennaless’3. Stocks homozygous for this gene show variable penetrance and expressivity on ordinary culture media. Selection and/or close inbreeding of individuals from such stocks can give rise to lines showing the whole range from almost zero to almost complete penetrance, representing the effects of the ‘antennaless’ gene when combined with different gene backgrounds4. The main difference between the two experiments seems to lie in the fact that in the crossveinless experiments the life-history includes a period of highly abnormal conditions, whereas in ‘antennaless’ the cycle is completed under normal culture conditions. The difference is, however, only one of degree, and the two situations would seem to be essentially parallel."

https://openalex.org/W1975997620,"TRANSAMINASE reactions are known to occur in practically all animal tissues, especially in heart muscle, brain, kidney, liver and testes. Reactions of this type were first suggested by Needham1, who noted that when glutamic acid was added to minced pigeon-breast muscle it disappeared without a parallel formation of ammonia. Four or five different transaminase systems have so far been thoroughly investigated by various workers2; but the methods employed for the study of these reactions have required manometric equipment3 and intensive analytical procedures4. The present communication deals with the application of paper chromatography technique to the separation of 2 : 4 dinitrophenyl-hydrazones of the keto-acids in the reaction mixture, since it has proved in our hands a satisfactory tool for the study of transaminase reactions. The reaction studied was: L-Aspartate + α-Ketoglutarate = Oxalacetate + L-Glutamate."

The axon and, later, the myelin sheath are destroyed and there is an increase in the number of both Schwann cells and endoneurial cells (chiefly fibrocytes and macrophages) found along the course of the nerve1,2. We have now shown that in such a degenerating peripheral nerve there is a marked increase in the activity of the enzyme β-glucuronidase."

https://openalex.org/W1981627306,"ANTIBIOTICS and 3-nitro-4-hydroxyphenylarsonic acid have been reported by various workers to stimulate the growth of chicks when added to their rations in low concentrations. Most of these experiments covered only the first four to twelve weeks of life, and male chicks were generally used. In short-term experiments, the addition of aureomycin to the ration of growing pullets enhanced the response of serum calcium and serum riboflavin to injected œstrogens, and it was suggested that the response of endogenous œstrogens might be similarly affected1."

Laboratory-extracted leaf protein has been shown to contain a useful content of the essential amino-acids1,2. The largest immediate source of leaf in Great Britain is the grasslands. Grass leaf when eaten by ruminants is converted into animal products; but this process is slow and very wasteful. Pigs and poultry make only limited use of grass-leaf protein because of their inability to digest the fibre in grass."
