https://openalex.org/W2974431928,"The thalamus is the central communication hub of the forebrain and provides the cerebral cortex with inputs from sensory organs, subcortical systems and the cortex itself. Multiple thalamic regions send convergent information to each cortical region, but the organizational logic of thalamic projections has remained elusive. Through comprehensive transcriptional analyses of retrogradely labeled thalamic neurons in adult mice, we identify three major profiles of thalamic pathways. These profiles exist along a continuum that is repeated across all major projection systems, such as those for vision, motor control and cognition. The largest component of gene expression variation in the mouse thalamus is topographically organized, with features conserved in humans. Transcriptional differences between these thalamic neuronal identities are tied to cellular features that are critical for function, such as axonal morphology and membrane properties. Molecular profiling therefore reveals covariation in the properties of thalamic pathways serving all major input modalities and output targets, thus establishing a molecular framework for understanding the thalamus."
https://openalex.org/W2974674542,"It has long been suggested that climate shapes land surface topography through interactions between rainfall, runoff and erosion in drainage basins1-4. The longitudinal profile of a river (elevation versus distance downstream) is a key morphological attribute that reflects the history of drainage basin evolution, so its form should be diagnostic of the regional expression of climate and its interaction with the land surface5-9. However, both detecting climatic signatures in longitudinal profiles and deciphering the climatic mechanisms of their development have been challenging, owing to the lack of relevant global data and to the variable effects of tectonics, lithology, land surface properties and human activities10,11. Here we present a global dataset of 333,502 river longitudinal profiles, and use it to explore differences in overall profile shape (concavity) across climate zones. We show that river profiles are systematically straighter with increasing aridity. Through simple numerical modelling, we demonstrate that these global patterns in longitudinal profile shape can be explained by hydrological controls that reflect rainfall-runoff regimes in different climate zones. The most important of these is the downstream rate of change in streamflow, independent of the area of the drainage basin. Our results illustrate that river topography expresses a signature of aridity, suggesting that climate is a first-order control on the evolution of the drainage basin."
https://openalex.org/W2974798830,"Exposing cells to excess metal concentrations well beyond the cellular quota is a powerful tool for understanding the molecular mechanisms of metal homeostasis. Such improved understanding may enable bioengineering of organisms with improved nutrition and bioremediation capacity. We report here that Chlamydomonas reinhardtii can accumulate manganese (Mn) in proportion to extracellular supply, up to 30-fold greater than its typical quota and with remarkable tolerance. As visualized by X-ray fluorescence microscopy and nanoscale secondary ion MS (nanoSIMS), Mn largely co-localizes with phosphorus (P) and calcium (Ca), consistent with the Mn-accumulating site being an acidic vacuole, known as the acidocalcisome. Vacuolar Mn stores are accessible reserves that can be mobilized in Mn-deficient conditions to support algal growth. We noted that Mn accumulation depends on cellular polyphosphate (polyP) content, indicated by 1) a consistent failure of C. reinhardtii vtc1 mutant strains, which are deficient in polyphosphate synthesis, to accumulate Mn and 2) a drastic reduction of the Mn storage capacity in P-deficient cells. Rather surprisingly, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, EPR, and electron nuclear double resonance revealed that only little Mn2+ is stably complexed with polyP, indicating that polyP is not the final Mn ligand. We propose that polyPs are a critical component of Mn accumulation in Chlamydomonas by driving Mn relocation from the cytosol to acidocalcisomes. Within these structures, polyP may, in turn, escort vacuolar Mn to a number of storage ligands, including phosphate and phytate, and other, yet unidentified, compounds."

However, taxonomic assessment of the immature stages of most arthropods is challenging; characters for identification are often dependent on adult morphology and reproductive structures. This study aims to strengthen the identification of such specimens through DNA barcoding, with a focus on microlepidoptera. A sample of 241 primarily immature microlepidoptera specimens intercepted at U.S. ports-of-entry from 2007 to 2011 were selected for analysis. From this sample, 201 COI-5P sequences were generated and analyzed for concordance between morphology-based and DNA-based identifications. The retrospective analysis of the data over 10 years (2009 to 2019) using the Barcode of Life Data (BOLD) system demonstrates the importance of establishing and growing DNA barcode reference libraries for use in specimen identification. Additionally, analysis of specimen identification using public data (43.3% specimens identified) vs. non-public data (78.6% specimens identified) highlights the need to encourage researchers to make data publicly accessible. DNA barcoding surpassed morphological identification with 42.3% (public) and 66.7% (non-public) of the sampled specimens achieving a species-level identification, compared to 38.3% species-level identification by morphology. Whilst DNA barcoding was not able to identify all specimens in our dataset, its incorporation into border security programs as an adjunct to morphological identification can provide secondary lines of evidence and lower taxonomic resolution in many cases. Furthermore, with increased globalization, database records need to be clearly annotated for suspected specimen origin versus interception location."
https://openalex.org/W2974813591,"Bovine milk extracellular vesicles (EVs) attract research interest as carriers of biologically active cargo including miRNA from donor to recipient cells to facilitate intercellular communication. Since toxicity of edible milk seems to be negligible, milk EVs are applicable to use for therapeutics in human medicine. Casein separation is an important step in obtaining pure EVs from milk, and recent studies reported that adding hydrochloric acid (HCl) and acetic acid (AA) to milk accelerates casein aggregation and precipitation to facilitate EV isolation and purification; however, the effects of acidification on EVs remain unclear. In this study, we evaluated the acidification effects on milk-derived EVs with that by standard ultracentrifugation (UC). We separated casein from milk by either UC method or treatment with HCl or AA, followed by evaluation of EVs in milk serum (whey) by transmission electron microcopy (TEM), spectrophotometry, and tunable resistive pulse sensing analysis to determine EVs morphology, protein concentration, and EVs size and concentration, respectively. Moreover, we used anti-CD9, -CD63, -CD81, -MFG-E8, -HSP70, and -Alix antibodies for the detection of EVs surface and internal marker proteins by western blot (WB). Morphological features of EVs were spherical shape and similar structure was observed in isolated EVs by TEM. However, some of the EVs isolated by HCl and AA had shown rough surface. Although protein concentration was higher in whey obtained by UC, EV concentration was significantly higher in whey following acid treatment. Moreover, although all of the targeted EVs-marker-proteins were detected by WB, HCl- or AA-treatments partially degraded CD9 and CD81. These findings indicated that acid treatment successfully separated casein from milk to allow efficient EV isolation and purification but resulted in partial degradation of EV-surface proteins. Our results suggest that following acid treatment, appropriate EV-surface-marker antibodies should be used for accurate assess the obtained EVs for downstream applications. This study describes the acidification effects on EVs isolated from bovine milk for the first time."
https://openalex.org/W2974122889,"Measuring disaster resilience is a key component of successful disaster risk management and climate change adaptation. Quantitative, indicator-based assessments are typically applied to evaluate resilience by combining various indicators of performance into a single composite index. Building upon extensive research on social vulnerability and coping/adaptive capacity, we first develop an original, comprehensive disaster resilience index (CDRI) at municipal level across Italy, to support the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030. As next, we perform extensive sensitivity and robustness analysis to assess how various methodological choices, especially the normalisation and aggregation methods applied, influence the ensuing rankings. The results show patterns of social vulnerability and resilience with sizeable variability across the northern and southern regions. We propose several statistical methods to allow decision makers to explore the territorial, social and economic disparities, and choose aggregation methods best suitable for the various policy purposes. These methods are based on linear and non-liner normalization approaches combining the OWA and LSP aggregators. Robust resilience rankings are determined by relative dominance across multiple methods. The dominance measures can be used as a decision-making benchmark for climate change adaptation and disaster risk management strategies and plans."
https://openalex.org/W2972837290,"Global gridded crop models (GGCMs) combine agronomic or plant growth models with gridded spatial input data to estimate spatially explicit crop yields and agricultural externalities at the global scale. Differences in GGCM outputs arise from the use of different biophysical models, setups, and input data. GGCM ensembles are frequently employed to bracket uncertainties in impact studies without investigating the causes of divergence in outputs. This study explores differences in maize yield estimates from five GGCMs based on the public domain field-scale model Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) that participate in the AgMIP Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison initiative. Albeit using the same crop model, the GGCMs differ in model version, input data, management assumptions, parameterization, and selection of subroutines affecting crop yield estimates via cultivar distributions, soil attributes, and hydrology among others. The analyses reveal inter-annual yield variability and absolute yield levels in the EPIC-based GGCMs to be highly sensitive to soil parameterization and crop management. All GGCMs show an intermediate performance in reproducing reported yields with a higher skill if a static soil profile is assumed or sufficient plant nutrients are supplied. An in-depth comparison of setup domains for two EPIC-based GGCMs shows that GGCM performance and plant stress responses depend substantially on soil parameters and soil process parameterization, i.e. hydrology and nutrient turnover, indicating that these often neglected domains deserve more scrutiny. For agricultural impact assessments, employing a GGCM ensemble with its widely varying assumptions in setups appears the best solution for coping with uncertainties from lack of comprehensive global data on crop management, cultivar distributions and coefficients for agro-environmental processes. However, the underlying assumptions require systematic specifications to cover representative agricultural systems and environmental conditions. Furthermore, the interlinkage of parameter sensitivity from various domains such as soil parameters, nutrient turnover coefficients, and cultivar specifications highlights that global sensitivity analyses and calibration need to be performed in an integrated manner to avoid bias resulting from disregarded core model domains. Finally, relating evaluations of the EPIC-based GGCMs to a wider ensemble based on individual core models shows that structural differences outweigh in general differences in configurations of GGCMs based on the same model, and that the ensemble mean gains higher skill from the inclusion of structurally different GGCMs. Although the members of the wider ensemble herein do not consider crop-soil-management interactions, their sensitivity to nutrient supply indicates that findings for the EPIC-based sub-ensemble will likely become relevant for other GGCMs with the progressing inclusion of such processes."
https://openalex.org/W2973474892,"Purpose To describe individual sleeping patterns and nocturnal cardiac autonomic activity of National team female soccer players during an international tournament. Materials and methods Twenty elite female soccer players (aged 25.2±3.1 years) wore wrist actigraph units and heart rate (HR) monitors during night-sleep throughout 9 consecutive days (6 day-time training sessions [DT], 2 day-time matches [DM], and 1 evening-time match [EM]) of an international tournament. Training and match loads were monitored using the session-rating of perceived exertion (s-RPE) and wearable 18-Hz GPS (total distance covered [TD], training and match exposure time, and high-speed running [HSR]) to characterize training and match loads. Results Individually, s-RPE, TD, exposure time, and HSR during training sessions ranged from 20 to 680 arbitrary units (AU), 892 to 5176 m, 20 to 76 min, and 80 to 1140 m, respectively. During matches, s-RPE, TD, exposure time, and HSR ranged from 149 to 876 AU, 2236 to 11210 m, 20 to 98 min, and 629 to 3213 m, respectively. Individually, players slept less than recommended (<7 hours) on several days of the tournament, especially after EM (n = 8; TST ranging between 6:00–6:54 h). Total sleep time coefficient of variation (CV) ranged between 3.1 and 18.7%. However, all players presented good sleep quality (i.e., sleep efficiency ≥75%; individual range between: 75–98%) on each day of the tournament. Most of the players presented small fluctuations in nocturnal cardiac autonomic activity (individual nocturnal heart rate variability [HRV] ranged from 3.91–5.37 ms and HRV CV ranged from 2.8–9.0%), while two players presented higher HRV CV (11.5 and 11.7%; respectively). Conclusion Overall, this study highlights the substantial individual variability in sleep and HRV measures, suggesting the adoption of an individual approach to monitor sleep, training and match loads and recovery, to better understand how players cope with highly demanding competitions."
https://openalex.org/W2974136243,"Recently, much attention has been paid to the extracts obtained from plant species in order to analyse their biological activities. Due to the climate diversity in Tunisia, the traditional pharmacopoeia consists of a wide arsenal of medicinal plant species since long used in folk medicine, in foods as spices, and in aromatherapy. Although many of these species are nearly facing extinction, only a small proportion of them have been scientifically studied. Therefore, this study explores the biochemical properties of seven spontaneous plants, which were harvested in the arid Tunisian desert: Marrubium vulgare (L.), Rhus tripartita (Ucria) D.C., Thymelaea hirsute (L.) Endl., Plantago ovata (Forsk.), Herniaria fontanesii (J. Gay.), Ziziphus lotus (L.) and Hyoscyamus albus (L.). Extracts from these plants were found to contain different types of secondary metabolites (polyphenols, flavonoids, condensed tannins, crude saponins, carotenoids and alkaloids) that are involved in important biological activities. The biological activity of the extracts obtained from each Tunisian plant was assessed: first of all, leukaemia and colon cancer cell lines (K-562 and CaCo-2 respectively) were treated with different concentrations of extracts, and then the anti-proliferative activity was observed. The results showed, in particular, how the plant extract from Rhus tripartita significantly inhibits cell proliferation, especially on the K-562 tumour cell line. Subsequently, the anti-inflammatory activity was also assessed, and the results showed that Herniaria fontanesii and Marrubium vulgare possess the highest activity in the group of analysed plants. Finally, the greatest acetylcholinesterase inhibitory effect was exhibited by the extract obtained from Rhus tripartita. In conclusion, all the Tunisian plants we analysed were shown to contain a remarkable amount of different bio-active compounds, thus confirming their involvement in several biological activities. Rhus tripartita and Ziziphus lotus were shown to be particularly effective in anti-proliferative activity, while Herniaria fontanesii were shown to have the best anti-inflammatory activity."
https://openalex.org/W2974120510,"This study aimed to assess the renopreventive effect of enalapril and/or paricalcitol on streptozotocin (STZ) diabetes-induced nephropathy and to elucidate their mechanisms of action through investigation of the effects on renal oxidative stress, antioxidant defense system and expressions of TNF-α, p53, caspase-3, and Bcl-2. Diabetes mellitus was induced in fasting male Wistar rats by single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (45 mg /kg b.w.) dissolved in citrate buffer (pH 4.5). Ten days after STZ injection, the diabetic rats were treated with enalapril (25 mg/l of drinking water) and/or paricalcitol (8 μg/kg b.w. per os) dissolved in 5% DMSO daily for 4 weeks. The obtained data revealed that the treatment of diabetic Wistar rats with enalapril and/or paricalcitol led to significant decreases in the elevated serum urea, uric acid, creatinine, sodium and potassium levels; thereby reflecting the improvement of the impaired kidney function. The deteriorated kidney lipid peroxidation, GSH content and GST and catalase activities in diabetic rats were significantly ameliorated as a result of treatment with enalapril and/or paricalcitol. The elevated fasting and post-prandial serum glucose levels and the lowered serum insulin and C-peptide levels were also improved. The treatment with enalapril and paricalcitol in combination was the most potent in decreasing the elevated serum glucose levels. Moreover, the treatment of diabetic rats successfully prevented the diabetes-induced histopathological deleterious changes of kidney and islets of Langerhans of pancreas. In association, the immunohistochemically detected pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-α, and apoptotic mediators, p53 and caspase-3, were remarkably decreased in kidney of diabetic rats as a result of treatment while the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was increased. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that enalapril and paricalcitol alone or in combination can prevent STZ diabetes-induced nephropathy through amelioration of the glycemic state and antioxidant defense system together with the suppression of oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis. However, the treatment of diabetic rats with enalapril and paricalcitol in combination has no further significant improvement effects on renal function and damage when compared with enalapril or paclitaxel treated diabetic groups."

Phylogenetically, all but one of the Trichoplax DEG/ENaC channels form a sister clade with deuterostome pH-sensitive ASIC channels, whereas the homologues from protostome invertebrates such as arthropods, molluscs, and nematodes form separate clades. In situ hybridization of TadNaC6 revealed expression within rows of cells that line the periphery on the animal, a region bearing cells thought to be involved in cellular communication (20Varoqueaux F.

In vitro expression of TadNaC6 in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, coupled with whole-cell patch-clamp recording, revealed robust Na+-selective leak currents that were blocked by both external protons and Ca2+, a functional profile also reported for the mouse BASIC and nematode ACD-1 DEG/ENaC channels (5Wiemuth D. Gründer S. A single amino acid tunes Ca2+ inhibition of brain liver intestine Na+ channel (BLINaC).J. Biol.

Proton block of TadNaC6 was biphasic in the presence of 2 mm external Ca2+, but monophasic in 0.1 mm Ca2+, revealing an interplay between proton and Ca2+ block. In accordance, proton block was enhanced in low Ca2+, while Ca2+ block was enhanced in low [H+], indicative of competition for channel block by these two extracellular ligands. Notably, an S353A mutation, within a homologous site shown to be a key determinant for differential Ca2+ sensitivity in rodent BASIC channels (5Wiemuth D. Gründer S. A single amino acid tunes Ca2+ inhibition of brain liver intestine Na+ channel (BLINaC).J. Biol.

Indeed, given its phylogenetic distance from the functionally similar mouse BASIC and nematode ACD-1 Na+ leak channels, and the absence of key amino acids involved in proton and Ca2+ sensitivity in other DEG/ENaC channels, it is likely that the gating features of TadNaC6 evolved independently. Nevertheless, our work extends extracellular protons and Ca2+ as modulatory ligands for DEG/ENaC channels close to the base of Metazoa. Finally, TadNaC6 was found to be activated by the general DEG/ENaC channel blocker amiloride, a rare feature only reported for rat ASIC3 (23Li W.-G. Yu Y. Huang C. Cao H. Xu T.-L. Nonproton ligand sensing domain is required for paradoxical stimulation of acid-sensing ion channel 3 (ASIC3) channels by amiloride.J. Biol.

Instead, diminazene, another general DEG/ENaC channel blocker, produced a low-affinity block corroborating that the two drugs have fundamentally different modes of action. The highly-divergent sequence and atypical properties observed for TadNaC6 provide some unique perspectives on the structure, function, and evolution of proton- and Ca2+-sensitive DEG/ENaC channels. Previously, we reported the cloning of complete open reading frames for nine DEG/ENaC ion channel homologues identified in the transcriptome of the early-diverging animal T. adhaerens, while two others identified in the genome failed to amplify via RT-PCR from whole-animal total RNA. 3Y. Y. Wong, L. Phuong, W. Elkhatib, T. Piekut, and A. Senatore, manuscript under review. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of the Trichoplax channels, along with DEG/ENaC channel proteins from various representative animals, reveals that all but one of the 11 Trichoplax homologues form a sister clade with ASIC channels from vertebrates, whereas the BASIC channels (also known as ASIC5 or BLiNAC channels) form a separate node from these two groups (Fig. 1A). Similar to the nomenclature used to name the cnidarian (Hydra) DEG/ENaC Na+ channels (i.e. HyNaCs), we chose to refer to the Trichoplax channels as TadNaCs 1–11. Notably, no protostome invertebrate DEG/ENaC channels clustered between the Trichoplax and vertebrate ASIC clades, and generally, the phylogenetic positions of the various ion channels throughout the tree do not correspond with the metazoan phylogeny (Fig. 1A, inset). Whether this extensive incomplete lineage sorting is attributable to sequence divergence/convergence, or extensive gene gain/loss, is difficult to discern. However, it is notable that clades with strong bootstrap support tend to be populated by channels from a single species or phylum, consistent with proposed lineage-specific genetic expansion events for DEG/ENaC channels within the Metazoa (12Liebeskind B.J. Hillis D.M. Zakon H.H. Convergence of ion channel genome content in early animal evolution.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The gating modalities of this particular clade of channels are relatively well-understood and quite distinct from each other, underscoring that even closely-related channels at the protein sequence level can exhibit divergent functional profiles. The phylogenetic tree also depicts 14 DEG/ENaC ion channel homologues identified in an updated gene dataset for the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica (Fig. 1A), notable because these were previously reported absent (14Gründer S. Assmann M. Peptide-gated ion channels and the simple nervous system of Hydra.J. Exp. Biol. 2015; 218 (25696818): 551-56110.1242/jeb.111666Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Finally, at least two distinct clades of ctenophore DEG/ENaC channels are apparent on the tree, none sharing strongly supported nodes with clades from other animals. Altogether, the DEG/ENaC ion channel family appears to have undergone extensive lineage-specific evolutionary change, a feature similarly observed for other gene families involved in sensory functions (30Derby C.D. Kozma M.T. Senatore A. Schmidt M. Molecular mechanisms of reception and perireception in crustacean chemoreception: a comparative review.Chem.

A recent single cell transcriptome study on T. adhaerens revealed that the DEG/ENaC channels TadNaC2 (TRIADDRAFT_58143), TadNaC3 (TRIADDRAFT_58141), and TadNaC8 (TRIADDRAFT_29260) are co-expressed in lipophil cells, which bear large acidophilic vesicles proposed to be secreted along the ventral epithelium for external digestion during feeding (22Smith C.L. Varoqueaux F. Kittelmann M. Azzam R.N. Cooper B. Winters C.A. Eitel M. Fasshauer D. Reese T.S. Novel cell types, neurosecretory cells, and body plan of the early-diverging metazoan Trichoplax adhaerens.Curr.

A single channel, TadNaC10 was found to be expressed in ciliated epithelial cells, possibly the ventral cells involved in ciliary locomotion (31Sebé-Pedrós A. Chomsky E. Pang K. Lara-Astiaso D.

Here, fluorescence in situ hybridization of TadNaC6, TadNaC5, and TadNaC2 revealed somewhat overlapping cellular expression, with TadNaC6 label being most prevalent in a narrow band at the edge, whereas the TadNaC5 label is abundant in a region extending ∼100 μm from the edge. TadNaC2 label is very sparse within 100 μm of the edge but more prevalent farther in the interior (Fig. 1B), the zone occupied by lipophil cells. We subcloned all nine cloned Trichoplax DEG/ENaC channel open reading frames into the mammalian expression vectors pIRES2-EGFP and pEGFP-C1 (Fig. 2A), in order to attempt functional expression for in vitro electrophysiology. Although various expressed Trichoplax channels have produced functional currents in vitro, this study focuses solely on TadNaC6, which possesses some striking and unique functional attributes. The vector pEGFP–TadNaC6 permits ectopic expression of the channel with an N-terminal fusion tag of the green fluorescent protein (GFP), which was used to visualize successful channel expression in CHO cells via fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2B), and as a full-length channel protein fused to GFP on Western blottings using polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies (Fig. 2C). Also evident is a fainter band on the blot with a molecular mass of roughly 200 kDa, absent in untransfected cell lysates, which possibly represents dimerized EGFP–TadNaC6 fusion proteins. Expression of the unfused TadNaC6 cDNA from the pTadNaC6–IR–EGFP vector in CHO cells produced robust acid-sensitive depolarizing leak currents recorded under a whole-cell voltage clamp when the membrane voltage was held at −60 mV (Fig. 2D). Leak inward currents were considerably active upon perfusion with an extracellular saline of pH of 7.5, whereas an acidic external solution of pH 5 completely blocked channel currents, and pH 9 and 10 solutions elicited maximal inward currents. TadNaC6 thus forms a functional homomeric channel in vitro, with gating features similar to those of vertebrate BASIC and C. elegans ACD-1 channels, all conducting constitutive cation leak currents at rest that are not activated by extracellular protons (5Wiemuth D. Gründer S. A single amino acid tunes Ca2+ inhibition of brain liver intestine Na+ channel (BLINaC).J. Biol.

This is in contrast to the ASIC channels, which become transiently activated upon extracellular acidification (32Wemmie J.A. Taugher R.J. Kreple C.J.

Furthermore, similar to ACD-1 and mouse BASIC, TadNaC6 is blocked by extracellular protons. To our knowledge, this is the first report of acid sensitivity for a DEG/ENaC channel from an early-diverging metazoan. Instead, the cloned channels from the cnidarian H. magnipapillata, which form a clade with TadNaCs and vertebrate ASIC and BASIC channels (Fig. 1A), were reported insensitive to pH and activated by RF-amide neuropeptides in vitro (14Gründer S. Assmann M. Peptide-gated ion channels and the simple nervous system of Hydra.J. Exp. Biol. 2015; 218 (25696818): 551-56110.1242/jeb.111666Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 34Golubovic A.

Evidently, the kinetics of TadNaC6 macroscopic currents change with pH, with desensitization becoming apparent after transition from a pH 5 to a pH 8.5 external solution, and more pronounced when transitioning from pH 5 to pH 10 (Fig. 2D). In this regard, relief from proton binding/inhibition, which serves to activate and then desensitize TadNaC6, appears similar to proton activation of the ASIC channels. Thus, it appears as though activation and subsequent desensitization of TadNaC6 are strictly dependent on transition between single-channel states, caused by dissociation of protons. We note that the current onset at pH 7 and 8 reflects slower channel activation compared with the intermediate pH of 7.5, as well as the more basic pH conditions ≥8.5. The slow activation kinetics at pH 8 mirror the steady-state current, where proton block of TadNaC6 is biphasic through this pH range, comprising a high-affinity proton block with an average IC50 pH of 8.5 ± 0.04 (plus or minus standard error, n = 9) and a low-affinity block with an IC50 of pH 7.12 ± 0.03 (Fig. 2E). Therefore, under these experimental conditions having external solutions bearing 140 mm [Na+] and 2 mm [Ca2+], TadNaC6 appears to have at least two extracellular binding sites for protons that affect both gating and activation kinetics. Structural modeling of TadNaC6, as well as the other TadNaC channel subunits, predicts conserved transmembrane helic"
https://openalex.org/W2973687787,"Background An assessment of bone strength based on bone mineral density (BMD) underestimates the risk of fracture in patients with diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, using the trabecular bone score (TBS) for estimating bone microarchitecture, previous studies showed that bone fragility is associated with deterioration of the microstructure concomitantly with decreased BMD. This study was conducted to clarify which of these skeletal-related factors had a more prominent relationship with bone fragility. Research design and methods A retrospective cross-sectional study was performed at Shimane University Hospital. A total of 548 Japanese patients with T2DM [257 postmenopausal women and 291 men aged over 50 years] were included. TBS of the spine was computed from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry images obtained from BMD measurements. Results Vertebral fractures (VFs) were identified in 74 (28.8%) women and 115 (39.5%) men. A relationship between BMD and VFs was observed in the limited subgroup of women with a BMD T-score ≤-1.0. According to multivariate logistic regression analysis, low TBS was significantly correlated with prevalent VFs, independent of BMD in both genders, except for men with a BMD T-score > -1.0. The decision tree showed that the priority factor for determining VFs was TBS, not BMD. Conclusion Spinal microarchitecture represented by TBS was a more dominant skeletal factor for bone fragility than the decrease in bone mass, independent of BMD, in patients with T2DM. This observation suggests that loss of structural bone quality was crucial underlying pathogenesis for bone brittleness in these populations, regardless of gender. An integrated assessment of bone strength by BMD and TBS would help diagnose diabetic osteoporosis."

Oral once-daily CC-223 was administered in 28-day cycles starting at 45 mg (n = 24), with a subsequent cohort starting at 30 mg (n = 23). Objectives were to evaluate tolerability, preliminary efficacy, and pharmacokinetic and biomarker profiles of CC-223. Forty-seven patients completed the study, with mean treatment duration of 378 days and mean dose of 26 mg; 26% of patients remained on the starting dose. Most frequent grade ≥3 toxicities were diarrhea (38%), fatigue (21%), and stomatitis (11%). By investigator, 3 of 41 evaluable patients (7%) showed partial response (PR) and 34 (83%) had stable disease (SD) for a disease control rate (DCR) of 90% (95% confidence interval [CI] 76.9–97.3%). Duration of PR was 125–401 days; median SD duration was 297 days (min–max, 50–1519 days). Median progression-free survival was 19.5 months (95% CI 10.4–28.5 months). Carcinoid symptoms of flushing, diarrhea, or both improved in 50%, 41%, and 39% of affected patients, respectively. For the first time, this study describes that a second-generation mTOR pathway inhibitor can result in highly durable tumor regression and control of NET carcinoid symptoms. The manageable safety profile, high DCR, and durable response, coupled with reduction in carcinoid symptoms refractory to SSA, make CC-223 a promising agent for further development."

Our framework reflects not only spatial dependencies among stations, but also various temporal patterns over different periods. Additionally, we consider the influence of global variables, such as weather and weekday/weekend to reflect non-station-level changes.

Available treatments for this devastating disease are few and have limited efficacy, prompting the search for new drug candidates. Simultaneous inhibition of the trypanosomal glycerol kinase (TGK) and trypanosomal alternative oxidase (TAO) is considered a validated strategy toward the development of new drugs. Our goal is to develop a TGK-specific inhibitor for coadministration with ascofuranone (AF), the most potent TAO inhibitor. Here, we report on the identification of novel compounds with inhibitory potency against TGK. Importantly, one of these compounds (compound 17) and its derivatives (17a and 17b) killed trypanosomes even in the absence of AF. Inhibition kinetics revealed that derivative 17b is a mixed-type and competitive inhibitor for TGK and TAO, respectively. Structural data revealed the molecular basis of this dual inhibitory action, which, in our opinion, will aid in the successful development of a promising drug to treat trypanosomiasis.

Song is prevalent in this feeding and migratory habitat, spanning nine months of the year (September-May), peaking in winter (November-January), and reaching a maximum of 86% temporal coverage (during November 2017). From the rise of song in fall through the end of peak occurrence in winter, song length increases significantly from month to month. The seasonal peak in song coincides with the seasonal trough in day length and sighting-based evidence of whales leaving Monterey Bay, consistent with seasonal migration. During the seasonal song peak, diel variation shows maximum occurrence at night (69% of the time), decreasing during dawn and dusk (52%), and further decreasing with increasing solar elevation during the day, reaching a minimum near solar noon (30%). Song occurrence increased 44% and 55% between successive years. Sighting data within the acoustic detection range of the hydrophone indicate that variation in local population density was an unlikely cause of this large interannual variation. Hydrographic data and modeling of acoustic transmission indicate that changes in neither habitat occupancy nor acoustic transmission were probable causes. Conversely, the positive interannual trend in song paralleled major ecosystem variations, including similarly large positive trends in wind-driven upwelling, primary productivity, and krill abundance. Further, the lowest song occurrence during the first year coincided with anomalously warm ocean temperatures and an extremely toxic harmful algal bloom that affected whales and other marine mammals in the region. These major ecosystem variations may have influenced the health and behavior of humpback whales during the study period."

Here, the noncanonical function of EIF3F was studied in human lung adenocarcinoma by combining methods that revealed both the protein-protein and the protein-DNA interactions of this factor. We discovered that EIF3F promotes cell metastasis in vivo. The underpinning molecular mechanisms involved the regulation of a cluster of 34 metastasis-promoting genes including Snail2, as revealed by proteomics combined with immuno-affinity purification of EIF3F and ChIP-seq/Q-PCR analyses. The interaction between EIF3F and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) controlled the EIF3F-mediated increase in Snail2 expression and cellular invasion, which were specifically abrogated using the STAT3 inhibitor Nifuroxazide or knockdown approaches. Furthermore, EIF3F overexpression reprogrammed energy metabolism through the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase and the stimulation of oxidative phosphorylation. Our findings demonstrate the role of EIF3F in the molecular control of cell migration, invasion, bioenergetics, and metastasis. The discovery of a role for EIF3F-STAT3 interaction in the genetic control of cell migration and metastasis in human lung adenocarcinoma could lead to the development of diagnosis and therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2973248887,"The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is critical for skeletal development, but its mechanism of action in osteoblasts is not well-characterized. In the central nervous system (CNS), Homer scaffolding proteins form signaling complexes with two CaSR-related members of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family C, metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) and mGluR5. Here, we show that CaSR and Homer1 are co-expressed in mineralized mouse bone and also co-localize in primary human osteoblasts. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that Homer1 associates with CaSR in primary human osteoblasts. The CaSR-Homer1 protein complex, whose formation was increased in response to extracellular Ca2+, was bound to mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 2 (mTORC2), a protein kinase that phosphorylates and activates AKT Ser/Thr kinase (AKT) at Ser473 siRNA-based gene-silencing assays with primary osteoblasts revealed that both CaSR and Homer1 are required for extracellular Ca2+-stimulated AKT phosphorylation and thereby inhibit apoptosis and promote AKT-dependent β-catenin stabilization and cellular differentiation. To confirm the role of the CaSR-Homer1 complex in AKT initiation, we show that in HEK-293 cells, co-transfection with both Homer1c and CaSR, but neither with Homer1c nor CaSR alone, establishes sensitivity of AKT-Ser473 phosphorylation to increases in extracellular Ca2+ concentrations. These findings indicate that Homer1 mediates CaSR-dependent AKT activation via mTORC2 and thereby stabilizes β-catenin in osteoblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2973608975,"Globally, neonatal deaths remain a major public health challenge and account for the majority of deaths occurring among children under five years of age. Despite Nepal's significant achievements in meeting the maternal and child health targets of the Millennium Development Goals, an estimated 23,000 Nepalese children under five years die every year, with three out of five babies dying within the first 28 days of life. This study therefore aimed to examine the level of knowledge and practices of newborn care among Nepalese mothers in the upper Himalayas and the factors associated with these.A community based cross-sectional study was conducted among 302 randomly selected mothers with children under two years of age in Tripurasundari Municipality of Dolpa district, an upper Himalayan region of Nepal. Mothers were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires. Mean score for knowledge and Bloom's criteria for practice were considered to categorize newborn care knowledge and practices. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with the newborn care knowledge and practices.In this study, 147 (48.7%) of the mothers were found to have inadequate knowledge of newborn care, while 102 (33.8%) mothers had reported unsatisfactory newborn care practices. Mothers with at least secondary level of formal education were more likely to possess adequate newborn care knowledge compared to mothers who never attended school (AOR 4.93 at 95% CI 1.82-13.33). Mothers whose first pregnancy occurred between the ages of 20-24 years (AOR 3.89 at 95% CI 1.81-8.37) were also more likely to possess adequate newborn care knowledge, compared to mothers with a younger age at first pregnancy. Furthermore, mothers who had completed at least four ANC visits (AOR 2.89 at 95% CI 1.04-7.96), mothers who had completed three PNC visits (AOR 2.79 at 95% CI 1.16-6.72) and mothers who reported that their nearest health facility was less than one hour (30-59 minutes) walking distance (AOR 3.66 at 95% CI 1.43-9.33) had higher odds of having adequate newborn care knowledge. Similarly, mothers whose household monthly income was more than $100 (AOR 4.17 at 95% CI 1.75-9.69), mothers who had completed three PNC visits (AOR 3.27 at 95% CI 1.16-9.20) and mothers with adequate newborn care knowledge (AOR 15.35 at 95% CI 5.82-40.47) were found to be more likely to practice a satisfactory level of newborn care practices in adjusted analysis.The study revealed high prevalence of inadequate newborn care and knowledge amongst mothers in upper Himalayan dwellings. Approximately one third of all interviewed mothers practiced suboptimal newborn care. The results indicate an urgent need to increase awareness of neonatal services available to mothers and to prioritize investments by local governments in neonatal health services, in order to improve accessibility and quality of care for mothers and newborns."
https://openalex.org/W2973838334,"Choline geranate (also described as Choline And GEranic acid, or CAGE) has been developed as a novel biocompatible antiseptic material capable of penetrating skin and aiding the transdermal delivery of co-administered antibiotics. The antibacterial properties of CAGE were analyzed against 24 and 72 hour old biofilms of 11 clinically isolated ESKAPE pathogens (defined as Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter sp, respectively), including multidrug resistant (MDR) isolates. CAGE was observed to eradicate in vitro biofilms at concentrations as low as 3.56 mM (0.156% v:v) in as little as 2 hours, which represents both an improved potency and rate of biofilm eradication relative to that reported for most common standard-of-care topical antiseptics in current use. In vitro time-kill studies on 24 hour old Staphylococcus aureus biofilms indicate that CAGE exerts its antibacterial effect upon contact and a 0.1% v:v solution reduced biofilm viability by over three orders of magnitude (a 3log10 reduction) in 15 minutes. Furthermore, disruption of the protective layer of exopolymeric substances in mature biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus by CAGE (0.1% v:v) was observed in 120 minutes. Insight into the mechanism of action of CAGE was provided with molecular modeling studies alongside in vitro antibiofilm assays. The geranate ion and geranic acid components of CAGE are predicted to act in concert to integrate into bacterial membranes, affect membrane thinning and perturb membrane homeostasis. Taken together, our results show that CAGE demonstrates all properties required of an effective topical antiseptic and the data also provides insight into how its observed antibiofilm properties may manifest."

In the present study, we successfully employed the restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) approach to comprehensively discover genome-wide SNPs of 104 rabbits from four Chinese indigenous breeds: 30 Sichuan White, 34 Tianfu Black, 32 Fujian Yellow and eight Fujian Black. A total of 7,055,440 SNPs were initially obtained, from which 113,973 high-confidence SNPs (read depth ≥ 3, calling rate = 100% and biallelic SNPs) were selected to study the genetic diversity and population structure. The mean polymorphism information content (PIC) and nucleotide diversity (π) of each breed slightly varied with ranging from 0.2000 to 0.2281 and from 0.2678 to 0.2902, respectively. On the whole, Fujian Yellow rabbits showed the highest genetic diversity, which was followed by Tianfu Black and Sichuan White rabbits. The principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the four breeds were clearly distinguishable. Our results first reveal the genetic differences among these four rabbit breeds in the Sichuan and Fujian provinces and also provide a high-confidence set of genome-wide SNPs for Chinese indigenous rabbits that could be employed for gene linkage and association analyses in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2973585389,"The human gut microbiota is well established as an important factor in health and disease. Fecal sample microbiota are often analyzed as a proxy for gut microbiota, and characterized with respect to their composition profiles. Modern approaches employ whole genome shotgun next-generation sequencing as the basis for these analyses. Sequencing depth as well as choice of next-generation sequencing data analysis method constitute two main interacting methodological factors for such an approach. In this study, we used 200 million sequence read pairs from one fecal sample for comparing different taxonomy classification methods, using default and custom-made reference databases, at different sequencing depths. A mock community data set with known composition was used for validating the classification methods. Results suggest that sequencing beyond 60 million read pairs does not seem to improve classification. The phylogeny prediction pattern, when using the default databases and the consensus database, appeared to be similar for all three methods. Moreover, these methods predicted rather different species. We conclude that the choice of sequencing depth and classification method has important implications for taxonomy composition prediction. A multi-method-consensus approach for robust gut microbiota NGS analysis is recommended."

Coarse electrophoretic fractionation of these proteins revealed a composition enriched in basic amino acids that was also important in reaching this conclusion. In a subsequent paper, the same authors extended their study to a broader spectrum of plants, including algae, bryophytes, and ferns, for which representative species containing protamines were also identified. Fig. 1 shows the electrophoretic pattern observed in the sperm of M. polymorpha SNBPs compared with those of some representative nonchordate and chordate animals.

The sequences obtained (see Table 1), primarily using ETD, confirmed the arginine-rich protamine nature of these proteins, and they revealed their structural relation to the three PL proteins that were bioinformatically identified above. These results conclusively show that M. polymorpha SNBPs are the post-translational cleavage products of three independent, histone H1–related, and protamine-like precursors.Table 1Identified protaminesM + HSequenceProtein nameFirst amino acid residue no.Last amino acid residue no.NCBI accession no.3955.50RRRRRRKSRRRRRRRRRRSKGSRSPRRR*PL-1 (MpPRM)182209BAU715523799.41RRRRRRKSRRRRRRRRRRSKGSRSPRR*PL-1 (MpPRM)182208BAU715523942.56RRRRRRRHHKKGKKKGRRRRRKRRRGRR*PL-1 (MpPRM)102129BAU715523313.16RRRRRRRRRRRRRRSRRRRGRK*PL-1 (MpPRM)146167BAU715527466.75RRRRRRRHGRKGKKPKRHRRRRRRRRRGRRKAHRGRKKKRG-GRRKGKRRHRRRRR*PL-3162216PTQ322234082.51RSTSRSRSRGRRRRRRRHRRRRGRRRRGRK*PL-2207236PTQ351413780.36RRRRRRKSRRRRRRRRRR(SKGSH)SPRR*PL-1 (MpPRM)182208BAU715524139.33RRRRRRKSRRRR(RRTVDRRRRRRRRRRR)PL-1 (MpPRM)182209BAU715524366.65RRRRRRKSRRRRRRRRRRSKGSRSPRRRHSSRPL-1 (MpPRM)182213BAU715527819.01RRRRRRRHGRKGKKPKRHRRRRRRRRRGRRKAHRGRKKKRGGRRKGKRRHRRRRR(GKSH)PL-3162220PTQ32223 Open table in a new tab Interestingly, in multiple ETD MS2 scans, a c-ion series could be deduced that covered the majority of the protein. However, there was a strong ion at 215.1740 m/z (z = 1) present in multiple species denoted by the star in Fig. 3a. From this ion, a series of amino acids was determined that complemented the c-ion series. Therefore, the ion at 215.1740 m/z must be a z• ion. Based on the sequence deduced from the c-ion series, the database BLAST search provided the protein from which the observed species originated as well as the final residue in the protein. This ion corresponded to an arginine with an unknown modification of 56.0740 Da greater than an unmodified arginine. This unknown modification was also observed on C-terminal lysines. A theoretical elemental composition was calculated to assist in the determination of the modification present on the z1+· ion. The molecular formula C9H21N5O was determined to be the closest combination based on parts/million error. Interestingly, there was only one oxygen atom present in the theoretical composition. This would place the modification on the C terminus because an unmodified C terminus would have two oxygens. After accounting for the arginine side chain (C4H11N3) and the protein backbone (C2HO), the elements C3H9N2 remain. To determine the structure of the modification, the ion at 215.1740 m/z was first formed by ETD and then re-isolated for fragmentation by high-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) to give the MS3 scan shown in Fig. 3d. Because of the guanidino group present on the arginine side chain, the charge should be stabilized within this group. Therefore, the structure can be determined from additions to the arginine side chain. As shown in Fig. 3d, the ions present confirm the structure shown in Fig. 3e. All identified protamines contained this modification. The modification was absent in other observed proteins from Marchantia (results not shown), indicating that this modification is specific to protamines. Organisms where SNBPs of the protamine type undergo a post-translational processing involving extensive protein cleavage often exhibit a characteristic nuclear organization during this process. A transition from lamello-fibrillar chromatin organization to a complete electron-dense highly-compacted organization in their mature sperm is observed (7Kasinsky H.E. Eirín-López J.M. Ausió J.

These spermatids have been shown to contain PL-1–type protamines until the late stages of spermiogenesis (27Higo A. Niwa M. Yamato K.T. Yamada L. Sawada H. Sakamoto T. Kurata T. Shirakawa M. Endo M.

As can be seen in Fig. 4, chromatin adopts a distinct fibrillar organization with dispersed uniform fibers of 24 ± 3-nm thickness. The fibers appear clearly dispersed and further coalesce into a uniform, highly-condensed, and electron-dense opaque nucleus in the mature sperm (37Kreitner G.L. Transformation of the nucleus in Marchantia spermatids: morphogenesis.Am. J. Botany. 1977; 64: 464-47510.1002/j.1537-2197.1977.tb12370.xCrossref Google Scholar). This type of chromatin organization has also been observed in the liverwort Blasia pusilla, a bryophyte (26Kasinsky H.E. Ellis S. Martens G. Ausió J. Dynamic aspects of spermiogenic chromatin condensation patterning by phase separation during the histone-to-protamine transition in charalean algae and relation to bryophytes.Tissue Cell. 2014; 46 (25262620): 415-43210.1016/j.tice.2014.07.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The peculiar transitional chromatin organization before complete condensation observed in these organisms has been proposed to be mediated by the liquid-liquid phase separation mechanism of spinodal decomposition (26Kasinsky H.E. Ellis S. Martens G. Ausió J. Dynamic aspects of spermiogenic chromatin condensation patterning by phase separation during the histone-to-protamine transition in charalean algae and relation to bryophytes.Tissue Cell. 2014; 46 (25262620): 415-43210.1016/j.tice.2014.07.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The process is framed on a physicochemical model that involves “kinetic, equilibrium, and structural aspects of a system in route to equilibrium.” In it, the less electron-dense nucleoplasm and the chromatin appear to be continuous rather than one disperse and one continuous phase (7Kasinsky H.E. Eirín-López J.M. Ausió J. Protamines: structural complexity, evolution and chromatin patterning.Protein Pept.

The occurrence of protamines in the sperm of Marchantia may have broader implications for the overall evolution of SNBPs. As pointed out in earlier work, the shift to the convergent presence of SNBPs in the sperm of both plants and animals might have involved selection pressure to reduce sperm nuclear weight and volume for a swimming male gamete (24Reynolds W.F. Wolfe S.L. Changes in basic proteins during sperm maturation in a plant, Marchantia polymorpha.Exp. Cell Res. 1978; 116 (710526): 269-27310.1016/0014-4827(78)90448-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) in internally fertilizing organisms. Indeed, protamines appear to be present in more primitive lower plants with motile sperm and are much less ubiquitous in the male nuclei of the pollen grain (3Kasinsky H.E. Hnilica L.S. Specificity and Distribution of Sperm Basic Proteins. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 73-163Google Scholar). In this regard, it is interesting that while in animals protamines may be present in both internal and external fertilizers, the last type of fertilization represents an SNBP evolutionary bottleneck. Once organisms from a clade have acquired this fertilization mode, there is no return to the histone or PL SNBP types (38Kasinsky H.E. Mann M. Huang S.Y. Fabre L. Coyle B. Byrd Jr., E.W. On the diversity of sperm basic proteins in the vertebrates: V. Cytochemical and amino acid analysis in Squamata, Testudines, and Crocodylia.J. Exp.

Moreover, evolutionarily-driven interspecific changes in the regulation of protamine genes and amino acid sequence in mice and mammals have been shown to confer inter-specific sperm competition (fertility) advantage (40Martin-Coello J.

Thus, in addition to providing genome compaction/protection against DNA damage and somatic histone epigenetic clearance (6Balhorn R.

https://openalex.org/W2974415098,"Early industrialization and the development of cheap production processes for paper have led to an exponential accumulation of paper-based documents during the last two centuries. Archives and libraries harbor vast amounts of ancient and modern documents and have to undertake extensive endeavors to protect them from abiotic and biotic deterioration. While services for mechanical preservation such as ex post de-acidification of historic documents are already commercially available, the possibilities for long-term protection of paper-based documents against fungal attack (apart from temperature and humidity control) are very limited. Novel processes for mechanical enhancement of damaged cellulosic documents use Ionic Liquids (IL) as essential process components. With some of these ILs having azole-functionalities similar to well-known fungicides such as Clotrimazole, the possibility of antifungal activities of these ILs was proposed but has not yet been experimentally confirmed. We evaluated the potency of four ILs with potential application in paper restoration for suppression of fungal growth on five relevant paper-infesting molds. The results revealed a general antifungal activity of all ILs, which increased with the size of the non-polar group. Physiological experiments and ultimate elemental analysis allowed to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration of each IL as well as the residual IL concentration in process-treated paper. These results provide valuable guidelines for IL-applications in paper restoration processes with antifungal activity as an added benefit. With azoles remaining in the paper after the process, simultaneous repair and biotic protection in treated documents could be facilitated."

Moreover, O-GlcNAcylation of Ser389 in ncOGT (1036 amino acids) affects its nuclear translocation in HeLa cells. To date, the major O-GlcNAcylation sites and their roles in sOGT remain unknown.

We identified six O-GlcNAc sites in the tetratricopeptide repeat domain in sOGT, with Thr12 and Ser56 being two “key” sites. Thr12 is a dominant O-GlcNAcylation site, whereas the modification of Ser56 plays a role in regulating sOGT O-GlcNAcylation, partly through Thr12. In vitro activity and pulldown assays demonstrated that O-GlcNAcylation does not affect sOGT activity but does affect sOGT-interacting proteins. In HEK293T cells, S56A bound to and hence glycosylated more proteins in contrast to T12A and WT sOGT. By proteomic and bioinformatics analyses, we found that T12A and S56A differed in substrate proteins (e.g. HNRNPU and PDCD6IP), which eventually affected cell cycle progression and/or cell proliferation. These findings demonstrate that O-GlcNAcylation modulates sOGT substrate selectivity and affects its role in the cell.

https://openalex.org/W2974256582,"GPR40/FFAR1 is a Gq protein-coupled receptor expressed in pancreatic β cells and enteroendocrine cells, and mediates insulin and incretin secretion to regulate feeding behavior. Several GPR40 full agonists have been reported to reduce food intake in rodents by regulating gut hormone secretion in addition to their potent glucose-lowering effects; however, detailed mechanisms of feeding suppression are still unknown. In the present study, we characterized T-3601386, a novel compound with potent full agonistic activity for GPR40, by using in vitro Ca2+ mobilization assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing FFAR1 and in vivo hormone secretion assay. We also evaluated feeding suppression and weight loss after the administration of T-3601386 and investigated the involvement of the vagal nerve in these effects. T-3601386, but not a partial agonist fasiglifam, increased intracellular Ca2+ levels in CHO cells with low FFAR1 expression, and single dosing of T-3601386 in diet-induced obese (DIO) rats elevated plasma incretin levels, suggesting full agonistic properties of T-3601386 against GPR40. Multiple doses of T-3601386, but not fasiglifam, in DIO rats showed dose-dependent weight loss accompanied by feeding suppression and durable glucagon-like peptide-1 elevation, all of which were completely abolished in Ffar1-/- mice. Immunohistochemical analysis in the nuclei of the solitary tract demonstrated that T-3601386 increased the number of c-Fos positive cells, which also disappeared in Ffar1-/- mice. Surgical vagotomy and drug-induced deafferentation counteracted the feeding suppression and weight loss induced by the administration of T-3601386. These results suggest that T-3601386 exerts incretin release and weight loss in a GPR40-dependent manner, and that afferent vagal nerves are important for the feeding suppression induced by GPR40 full agonism. Our novel findings raise the possibility that GPR40 full agonist can induce periphery-derived weight reduction, which may provide benefits such as less adverse effects in central nervous system compared to centrally-acting anti-obesity drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2974276639,"Condition indices aim to evaluate the physiological status of fish larvae by estimating both the level of starvation and potential of survival. Histological indices reveal direct effects of starvation whereas biochemical indices such as lipid classes or RNA:DNA ratios are used as proxies of condition, giving information on the amount of energy reserves and growth rate, respectively. We combined these three indices to evaluate ontogenetic variations of growth performance, lipid dynamics and nutritional condition of plaice larvae caught in the field during winter 2017 in the eastern English Channel and the Southern Bight of the North Sea. RNA:DNA ratios showed that larvae at the beginning of metamorphosis (stage 4) had a lower growth rate than younger individuals (stages 2 and 3). A significant increase in the proportion of triglycerides also occurred at stage 4, indicating energy storage. Histological indices indicated that most of the larvae were in good condition, even younger ones with low lipid reserves. There was, however, an increase in the proportion of healthy individuals over ontogeny, especially with respect to liver vacuoles which were larger and more numerous for stage 4 larvae. Combined together, these condition indices revealed the ontogenetic shift in the energy allocation strategy of plaice larvae. Young larvae (stages 2 and 3) primarily allocate energy towards somatic growth. The decrease in growth performance for stage 4 was not related to poor condition, but linked to a higher proportion of energy stored as lipids. Since the quantity of lipid reserves is particularly important for plaice larvae to withstand starvation during metamorphosis, this could be considered as a second critical period after the one of exogenous feeding for larval survival and recruitment success."
https://openalex.org/W2973586872,"Background Methotrexate (MTX) is an important anti-folate agent in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment. Folinic acid rescue therapy (Leucovorin) is administered after MTX to reduce toxicity. Previous studies hypothesized that Leucovorin could ‘rescue’ both normal healthy cells and leukemic blasts from cell death. We assessed whether Leucovorin is able to restore red blood cell folate levels after MTX. Methods We prospectively determined erythrocyte folate levels (5-methyltetrahydrofolate (THF) and non-methyl THF) and serum folate levels in 67 children with ALL before start (T0) and after stop (T1) of HD-MTX and Leucovorin courses. Results Erythrocyte folate levels increased between T0 and T1 (mean ± SD: 416.7 ± 145.5 nmol/L and 641.2 ± 196.3 nmol/L respectively, p<0.001). This was due to an increase in 5-methyl THF levels (mean increase: 217.7 ± 209.5 nmol/L, p<0.001), whereas non-methyl THF levels did not change (median increase: 0.6 nmol/L [-9.9–11.1], p = 0.676). Serum folate levels increased between T0 and T1 (median increase: 29.2 nmol/L [32.9–74.0], p<0.001). Results were not significantly affected by age, sex, ALL immunophenotype and MTHFR c.677C>T genotype. Conclusion Intracellular folate levels accumulate after HD-MTX and Leucovorin therapy in children with ALL, suggesting that Leucovorin restores the intracellular folate pool. Future studies are necessary to assess concomitant lower uptake of MTX."

https://openalex.org/W2974098591,"Objective Medical Psychiatry Units (MPUs), also known as Complexity Intervention Units (CIUs), provide care for complex patients suffering from both psychiatric and physical disorders. Because there is no consensus on the indications for admission to an MPU, daily practice and effectiveness research are hampered. This study therefore used a concept mapping approach to investigate which organizational and medical factors determine the decision to admit a patient to an MPU. Methods The first step of the concept mapping approach was to create a list of factors determining MPU admission from literature. Secondly, clinical experts sorted and ranked these factors. The sorted and ranked data were then analyzed, and a draft conceptual framework was created. A final conceptual MPU admission framework was then drawn during an expert consensus meeting and recommendations for implementation were suggested. Results Thirteen clinical experts defined 90 factors from literature, which were sorted and ranked by 40 experts from 21 Dutch hospitals. This concept mapping approach resulted in a five-cluster solution for an MPU admission framework based on: 1. Staff competencies and organizational pre-requisites; 2. Patient context; 3. Patient characteristics; 4. Medical needs and capabilities; and 5. Psychiatric symptoms and behavioral problems. Furthermore, three inclusion and two exclusion criteria were formulated to help the clinicians decide whether or not to admit patients to an MPU. These criteria can be implemented in daily practice. Conclusion Implementing the five criteria derived from this conceptual framework will help make the admission decision for complex patients with psychiatric and physical disorders to an MPU more correct, consistent, and transparent."
https://openalex.org/W2974656599,"Copper is critically important for methanotrophic bacteria because their primary metabolic enzyme, particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO), is copper-dependent. In addition to pMMO, many other copper proteins are encoded in the genomes of methanotrophs, including proteins that contain periplasmic copper-A chaperone (PCuAC) domains. Using bioinformatics analyses, we identified three distinct classes of PCuAC domain-containing proteins in methanotrophs, termed PmoF1, PmoF2, and PmoF3. PCuAC domains from other types of bacteria bind a single Cu(I) ion via an HXnMX21/22HXM motif, which is also present in PmoF3, but PmoF1 and PmoF2 lack this motif entirely. Instead, the PCuAC domains of PmoF1 and PmoF2 bind only Cu(II), and PmoF1 binds additional Cu(II) ions in a His-rich extension to its PCuAC domain. Crystal structures of the PmoF1 and PmoF2 PCuAC domains reveal that Cu(II) is coordinated by an N-terminal histidine brace HX10H motif. This binding site is distinct from those of previously characterized PCuAC domains but resembles copper centers in CopC proteins and lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO) enzymes. Bioinformatics analysis of the entire PCuAC family reveals previously unappreciated diversity, including sequences that contain both the HXnMX21/22HXM and HX10H motifs, and sequences that lack either set of copper-binding ligands. These findings provide the first characterization of an additional class of copper proteins from methanotrophs, further expand the PCuAC family, and afford new insight into the biological significance of histidine brace-mediated copper coordination.

Instead, the PCuAC domains of PmoF1 and PmoF2 bind only Cu(II), and PmoF1 binds additional Cu(II) ions in a His-rich extension to its PCuAC domain. Crystal structures of the PmoF1 and PmoF2 PCuAC domains reveal that Cu(II) is coordinated by an N-terminal histidine brace HX10H motif. This binding site is distinct from those of previously characterized PCuAC domains but resembles copper centers in CopC proteins and lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO) enzymes. Bioinformatics analysis of the entire PCuAC family reveals previously unappreciated diversity, including sequences that contain both the HXnMX21/22HXM and HX10H motifs, and sequences that lack either set of copper-binding ligands. These findings provide the first characterization of an additional class of copper proteins from methanotrophs, further expand the PCuAC family, and afford new insight into the biological significance of histidine brace-mediated copper coordination."
https://openalex.org/W2973264941,"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has become a valuable imaging modality in ophthalmology, especially for the diagnosis and treatment planning of patients with uveal melanoma, the most common primary intra-ocular tumor. We aim to develop and evaluate the value of silent Zero Echo Time (ZTE) MRI to image patients with ocular tumors at 7Tesla. Therefore, ZTE and different types of magnetization-prepared ZTE (FLAIR, SPIR, T2 and Saturation recovery), have been developed. After an initial validation with 7 healthy subjects, nine patients with an eye tumor have been evaluated. The ZTE scans were compared to their Cartesian equivalent in terms of contrast, motion-sensitivity, diagnostic quality and patient comfort. All volunteers and especially the patients reported a more comfortable experience during the ZTE scans, which had at least a 10 dB lower sound pressure. The image contrast in the native ZTE was poor, but in the different magnetization-prepared ZTE, the eye lens, cornea and retina were clearly discriminated. Overall the T2-prepared scan yielded the best contrast, especially between tumor and healthy tissue, and proved to be robust against eye motion. Although the intrinsic 3D nature of the ZTE-technique provides an accurate analysis of the tumor morphology, the quality of the ZTE-images is lower than their Cartesian equivalent. In conclusion, the quality of magnetization-prepared ZTE images is sufficient to assess the 3D tumor morphology, but insufficient for more detailed evaluations. As such this technique can be an option for patients who cannot comply with the sound-levels of Cartesian scans, but for other patients the conventional Cartesian scans offer a better image quality."

Mean vertical velocity of the weight plates in the leg extension machine was measured for every repetition using a smartphone application (My Lift).Linear regression analyses showed a high goodness of fit (R2 > 0.93) and small standard errors of estimate (SEE < 5%1-RM) both in the bilateral and unilateral leg extension when individual load-velocity regressions for each participant were computed. Unilateral load-velocity relationships showed significant differences in the intercept of the regression line with the Y-axis and the velocity at each percentage of the 1-RM (Cohen's d > 1.0, p< 0.05). Finally, non-significant differences were observed between actual and estimated 1-RM from the load-velocity relationships (r = 0.88.0-96, Cohen's d < 0.2, p> 0.05).This proof of concept highlights that computing load-velocity relationships in a machine-based, single-joint, angular exercise can be appropriately performed by measuring the mean vertical velocity of the weight plates. These results could help strength and conditioning researchers and coaches who wish to analyze load-velocity relationship in other common machine-based exercises."
https://openalex.org/W2974218482,"B-cell adaptor protein (BCAP) is a multimodular, multifunctional signal transducer that regulates signal transduction pathways in leukocytes, including macrophages, B-cells, and T-cells. In particular, BCAP suppresses inflammatory signaling by Toll-like receptors (TLRs). However, how BCAP itself is regulated and what its interaction partners are is unclear. Here, using human immune cell lines, including THP-1 cells, we characterized the complex phosphorylation patterns of BCAP and used a novel protein complex trapping strategy, called virotrap, to identify its interaction partners. This analysis identified known interactions of BCAP with phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) p85 subunit and NCK adaptor protein (NCK), together with previously unknown interactions of BCAP with Src homology 2 (SH2) and SH3 domain-containing adaptor proteins, notably growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) and CRK-like proto-oncogene, adaptor protein (CRKL). We show that the SH3 domain of GRB2 can bind to BCAP independently of BCAP phosphorylation status, suggesting that the SH2 domains mediate interactions with activated receptor tyrosine kinase complexes including the CD19 subunit of the B-cell receptor. Our results also suggested that the PI3K p85 subunit binds to BCAP via SH3 domains forming an inactive complex that is then activated by sequential binding with the SH2 domains. Taken together, our results indicate that BCAP is a complex hub that processes signals from multiple pathways in diverse cell types of the immune system."
https://openalex.org/W2974457802,"Background Encephalitis, characterised as inflammation of the brain tissue, is an important cause of acquired brain injury in children. Objective clinical outcomes vary significantly between affected patients, however they do not always correlate with quality of life as reported by parents. The aim of this study was to explore how parents experience and interpret outcomes in relation to their child who has been affected by encephalitis. Methods Data were derived from in-depth, semi-structured interviews, with 15 parents of 12 children and young people affected by encephalitis. Paediatric cases were identified from the retrospective arm of the research programme ‘ENCEPH-UK-Understanding and Improving the Outcome of Encephalitis’, and from the prospective UK childhood meningitis and encephalitis cohort study (UK-ChiMES, 2012 to 2016). Data were analysed thematically. Results Parents’ perspectives on important outcomes for their child and family changed during the different stages of the encephalitis illness trajectory: from acute illness, recovery and rehabilitation, then reintegration into everyday life. Parents’ understanding of their children’s overall outcome was informed by their own experiences, involving comparisons with other children and reflections on their child’s problems before, during and after the acute illness. Conclusion Outcomes in paediatric encephalitis need to be understood in terms of the context of the patient and family experience as well as the timeframe of recovery. The research highlights the need to include more patient, parent and/or carer reported outcome measures during patient assessment, and that assessment should be repeated during recovery as family concerns change. In the longer term, these parameters could be included in clinical and rehabilitation practice to further support child recovery."

Developing strategies to control the HIV epidemic remains a key priority for the Mozambican public health community. The primary aim of this study was to determine HIV prevalence and risk behavior among males and females screened for a HIV vaccine preparedness study in Maputo, Mozambique.Male and female participants between 18-35 years old were recruited from the general community and from female sex worker (FSW) and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) associations in Maputo. All participants were screened for HIV and a questionnaire was administered to each participant to assess HIV risk behavior.A total of 1125 adults were screened for HIV infection, among whom 506 (45%) were male. Among men, 5.7% reported having had sex with men (MSM) and 12% of female participants reported having exchanged sex for money, goods or favors in the past 3 months. The overall HIV prevalence was 10.4%; 10.7% of women, and 10.1% of men were HIV infected; 41.4% of MSM were seropositive. HIV infection was associated with older age (25-35 years old) (OR: 6.13, 95% CI: 3.01, 12.5), MSM (OR: 9.07, 95% CI: 3.85, 21.4), self-perception of being at high-risk for HIV (OR: 3.99, 95% CI: 1.27, 12.5) and self-report of a history of a diagnosis of sexually transmitted infection (OR: 3.75, 95% CI: 1.57, 8.98).In our cohort, HIV prevalence was much higher among MSM compared to the overall prevalence. Behavioral factors were found to be more associated with HIV prevalence than demographic factors. The study findings demonstrate the critical importance of directing services to minority communities, such as MSM, when prevention strategies are being devised for the general population."
https://openalex.org/W2974132605,"Background Veteran patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and their family members regularly receive care from nurses. Understanding nurses’ training and beliefs can provide direction for intervention work aimed at ensuring the best possible care is delivered to this population. Aims We examined Veterans Health Administration (VHA) nurses’ training and beliefs related to care of patients with moderate-to-severe TBI. Design and methods We conducted an exploratory, cross-sectional survey with 211 VHA nurses and analyzed data using descriptive statistics. Results The average years of nursing experience was 18 years, and 90% reported ever caring for a patient with TBI. Most nurses (70%) reported only seeing patients with TBI ≤1–2 times per year in their current role; 20% reported seeing these patients 1–2 times per month. Even with infrequent care, almost 50% reported previously receiving TBI-related training. Beliefs items with the highest accuracy indicated nurses agreed that they need specialized training to care for patients with TBI and that TBI recovery may continue for several years (96.39% accuracy respectively). The beliefs item with the lowest accuracy indicated focus on whether nurses agreed that TBI severity was important in developing care plans (27.84% accuracy). Nurses reported the need for clarity of the nursing role in caring for patients with TBI (77.32% agreement). Conclusion VHA nurses do have accurate beliefs about caring for Veteran patients with moderate-to-severe TBI; however, there is the need for further role clarification regarding nursing care of patients with TBI. Impact These findings have implications for development of education and training interventions for nurses who care for Veteran patients with TBI."
https://openalex.org/W2974312871,"In the area of laser material processing, versatile applications for cutting glasses and transparent polymers exist. However, parasitic effects such as the creation of step-like structures appear when laser cutting inside a transparent material. To date, these structures were only described empirically. This work establishes the physical and chemical mechanisms behind the observed effects and describes the influence of process and material parameters onto the creation of step-like structures in hydrogel, Dihydroxyethylmethacrylat (HEMA). By focusing laser pulses in HEMA, reduced pulse separation distance below 50 nm and rise in pulse energy enhances the creation of unintended step-like structures. Spatial resolved Raman-spectroscopy was used to measure the laser induced chemical modification, which results into a reduced breakdown threshold. The reduction in threshold influences the position of optical breakdown for the succeeding laser pulses and consequently leads to the step-like structures. Additionally, the experimental findings were supplemented with numerical simulations of the influence of reduced damage threshold onto the position of optical breakdown. In summary, chemical material change was defined as cause of the step-like structures. Furthermore, the parameters to avoid these structures were identified."
https://openalex.org/W2973433134,"The Giant Gartersnake (Thamnophis gigas) is a low density visually evasive species with a low detection probability based on standard field survey methods (e.g., traps, visual census). Habitat loss has resulted in extirpations or serious declines for T. gigas populations throughout the southern two thirds of its historic range. Uncertainty regarding its current distribution and occupancy present management challenges for the species. Enhancing survey sensitivity through development of environmental DNA sampling (eDNA) methods would improve compliance monitoring under the Endangered Species Act, recovery planning for T. gigas, and evaluation of California's Central Valley tule marsh habitat on which this species depends. To address these needs, we designed and validated diagnostic quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) assays for identifying portions of the Cytochrome B (CytB) and the Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND4) genes of the T. gigas mitochondrial genome. The designed ND4 qPCR assay was not specific to T. gigas DNA and amplified DNA from a closely related and spatially co-occurring Thamnophis species (T.s. fitchi). The CytB T. gigas qPCR assay proved specific to a species level with a sensitivity that reliably detected T. gigas DNA at a concentration of 2.0x10-5 ng μL-1. To assess detection range, coordinated field sampling was conducted at aquatic sites with an observed and documented population of T. gigas. The T. gigas qPCR assay reliably detected DNA from samples taken 300m downstream from the known source. We then used environmental eDNA sampling and qPCR analysis to augment unsuccessful trap surveys in the southern range of T. gigas and detected DNA in 28 of the 52 locations sampled, confirming that T. gigas was still present at some sites where physical trapping failed to identify presence. QPCR-based DNA detection coupled with eDNA sampling methods provides an effective means to obtain critical population metrics from this otherwise cryptic, federally protected and hard to study organism, offering great promise for elucidating patterns of occupancy with greater efficiency and at far less cost than trapping methods, particularly where detection probabilities are low."

We found that SPR1-GFP preferentially binds to the GTPγS microtubule lattice compared with the guanosine-5′-[(αβ)-methyleno] triphosphate (GMPCPP) microtubule seeds (Fig. 1F). These data suggest that the SPR1 and EB proteins share a similar mechanism for recognizing growing microtubule ends. To determine whether SPR1-GFP affects the behavior of microtubule plus-ends in vitro, we measured the dynamic instability parameters at various SPR1-GFP concentrations. We observed that SPR1-GFP inhibited the growth rate of microtubule plus ends and enhanced their catastrophe frequency in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1, G and I). In contrast, SPR1-GFP did not significantly affect the shortening rate of microtubule plus ends and only modestly increased their rescue frequency at the highest SPR1-GFP concentration tested (Fig. 1, H and J). These observations (summarized in Table S1) are largely consistent with the reported changes in microtubule plus-end dynamics in spr1 loss-of-function mutants compared with the WT (19Lindeboom J.J. Nakamura M. Saltini M. Hibbel A. Walia A. Ketelaar T. Emons A.M.C. Sedbrook J.C. Kirik V. Mulder B.M. Ehrhardt D.W. CLASP stabilization of plus ends created by severing promotes microtubule creation and reorientation.J. Cell Biol. 2018; 218 (30377221): 190-20510.1083/jcb.201805047Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). SPR1 is the smallest known +TIP; therefore, we wanted to identify the regions that confer microtubule plus-end localization. The conserved N- and C-terminal regions of SPR1 (Fig. 2A) have been proposed to contribute to microtubule binding because they contain a GGG and a PGGG motif, respectively, which are part of the microtubule-binding repeats of the MAP2/tau family of microtubule-associated proteins (11Nakajima K. Furutani I. Tachimoto H. Matsubara H. Hashimoto T. SPIRAL1 encodes a plant-specific microtubule-localized protein required for directional control of rapidly expanding Arabidopsis cells.Plant Cell. 2004; 16 (15084720): 1178-119010.1105/tpc.017830Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 12Sedbrook J.C. Ehrhardt D.W. Fisher S.E. Scheible W.R. Somerville C.R. The Arabidopsis sku6/spiral1 gene encodes a plus end-localized microtubule-interacting protein involved in directional cell expansion.Plant Cell. 2004; 16 (15155883): 1506-152010.1105/tpc.020644Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To determine the relative contribution of the N- and C-terminal regions of SPR1, we created truncated versions of SPR1 that lacked either the N-terminal or the C-terminal regions (Fig. 2, B and C). We found that deleting the N-terminal 18 amino acids (SPR1Δ1–18) abolished +TIP activity in vitro (Fig. 2D), indicating that the N-terminal region of SPR1 is essential for recognizing the microtubule plus end. Deletion of the C-terminal 33 amino acids (SPR1Δ87–119) diminished the signal at growing microtubule plus ends but did not eliminate it (Fig. 2D), indicating that the C-terminal region enhances the +TIP activity of SPR1 but is not necessary for it. Consistent with these findings and with previous in vivo work (11Nakajima K. Furutani I. Tachimoto H. Matsubara H. Hashimoto T. SPIRAL1 encodes a plant-specific microtubule-localized protein required for directional control of rapidly expanding Arabidopsis cells.Plant Cell. 2004; 16 (15084720): 1178-119010.1105/tpc.017830Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), the chimeric N-GFP-C protein clearly localized to growing microtubule plus ends in vitro (Fig. 2D and Movie S2). To test whether the spacing of the N- and C-terminal regions is important for +TIP activity, we fused these regions in tandem to GFP (Fig. 2, B and C). The resulting NC-GFP fusion protein also localized to growing microtubule plus ends in vitro (Fig. 2D and Movie S3). During these experiments, we noticed that the microtubule plus-end signals of N-GFP-C and NC-GFP were less than the SPR1-GFP signal. To determine whether the N-GFP-C and NC-GFP proteins have a lower affinity for the microtubule plus end compared with SPR1-GFP, we conducted in vitro dynamic microtubule assays under single-molecule imaging conditions followed by kymograph analysis (Fig. 2F). Photobleaching experiments revealed that the majority of SPR1-GFP particles were monomeric (97.7% monomers, 2.3% dimers, n = 175). Similarly, the majority of N-GFP-C and NC-GFP particles were also monomeric (92% monomers, 8% dimers, n = 88 for N-GFP-C; 91.2% monomers, 8.8% dimers, n = 158 for NC-GFP). We measured the binding rate and dwell time of individual particles to calculate the binding rate constant (kon) and unbinding rate constant (koff) of SPR1-GFP, N-GFP-C, and NC-GFP for the growing microtubule plus end. Our findings showed that N-GFP-C and NC-GFP bind more weakly to microtubule plus ends compared with SPR1-GFP (Fig. 2G). Next we tested the significance of the N-terminal GGG and C-terminal PGGG motifs by mutating these amino acids to alanine within the context of full-length SPR1 (Fig. 2, B and C). Although mutation of PGGG to AAAA (SPR1PGGG-AAAA) had no effect on the +TIP activity of SPR1, mutation of GGG to AAA (SPR1GGG-AAA) abolished this activity (Fig. 2E). These findings underscore the essential role of the SPR1 N-terminal region and indicate that the GGG motif in the N-terminal region is critical for +TIP activity. The autonomous +TIP activity of N-GFP-C and NC-GFP makes them attractive microtubule plus-end markers. To determine whether they affect microtubule plus-end dynamics similar to the WT SPR1 protein, we tested the effect of N-GFP-C and NC-GFP on microtubule dynamics in vitro. We found that N-GFP-C did not significantly alter the microtubule growth rate (Fig. 3A), catastrophe frequency (Fig. 3C), or rescue frequency (Fig. 3D) and only modestly increased the shortening rate (Fig. 3B). NC-GFP did not significantly alter any of these microtubule dynamic instability parameters (Fig. 3, E–H, and Table S1). Furthermore, we compared the number of growth-to-shortening and shortening-to-growth transition events exhibited by individual microtubules at different concentrations of SPR1-GFP, N-GFP-C, and NC-GFP. We found that SPR1-GFP boosted microtubule transitions in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3I), consistent with its enhancement of catastrophe and rescue frequencies (Fig. 1, I and J). In contrast, neither N-GFP-C nor NC-GFP significantly altered the number of microtubule transitions (Fig. 3, J and K). Taken together, our findings demonstrate that N-GFP-C and NC-GFP localize to growing microtubule plus ends without significantly perturbing their dynamics, unlike WT SPR1. To determine whether NC-GFP is functional in vivo, we expressed it under the constitutive A. thaliana UBIQUITIN10 (pUBQ10) promoter in spr1–6 mutant plants. pUBQ10:SPR1-GFP and pUBQ10:N-GFP-C constructs were included as controls. All three constructs were also expressed in WT plants expressing an RFP-TUB6 microtubule marker to determine their microtubule localization in plants. We found that SPR1-GFP fully complements the hypocotyl cell file skewing phenotype of the spr1–6 mutant, whereas the NC-GFP and N-GFP-C constructs only partially complemented this phenotype (Fig. 4, A and B). Our data for SPR1-GFP and N-GFP-C are consistent with previous work that expressed these constructs under a cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and reported complete and partial complementation of root skewing in spr1–6, respectively (11Nakajima K. Furutani I. Tachimoto H. Matsubara H. Hashimoto T. SPIRAL1 encodes a plant-specific microtubule-localized protein required for directional control of rapidly expanding Arabidopsis cells.Plant Cell. 2004; 16 (15084720): 1178-119010.1105/tpc.017830Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Notably, although the N-GFP-C signal was barely above our detection threshold, NC-GFP localized to growing microtubule plus ends in vivo (Fig. 4C). These observations indicate that NC-GFP can be used as a microtubule plus-end marker in plants. We also found that NC-GFP preferentially binds to GTPγS microtubules, similar to SPR1-GFP (Fig. S1), indicating that NC-GFP also recognizes GDP/Pi-tubulin at growing microtubule plus ends. Because SPR1-GFP, N-GFP-C, and NC-GFP labeled the plus ends of microtubules assembled from porcine tubulin in vitro, we reasoned that they might label microtubule plus ends in animal cells. To test the suitability of these proteins as microtubule plus-end markers in animal cells, we introduced them in HEK293 cells and imaged the transfected cells using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. GFP-labeled human tubulin and EB3 were included as controls in these experiments. As expected, GFP-tubulin labeled the entire microtubule lattice, whereas EB3-GFP localized to growing microtubule plus ends (Fig. 5, A and B). Interestingly, both SPR1-GFP and NC-GFP clearly labeled growing microtubule plus ends and the microtubule shaft to a lesser extent (Fig. 5, C and D, and Movies S4 and S5). To assess whether SPR1-GFP and NC-GFP affect microtubule dynamics in HEK293 cells, we quantified microtubule growth rates in cells expressing these proteins (Fig. 5E). Cells expressing SPR1-GFP had slightly higher microtubule growth rates (0.23 ± 0.07 μm/s, n = 105 microtubules) compared with cells expressing GFP-tubulin (0.17 ± 0.06 μm/s, n = 114 microtubules) or EB3-GFP (0.17 ± 0.07 μm/s, n = 105 microtubules). Expression of NC-GFP in HEK293 cells had a less pronounced effect on the microtubule growth rate (0.19 ± 0.04 μm/s, n = 99 microtubules) compared with SPR1-GFP. Importantly, SPR1-GFP and NC-GFP did not visibly impair the viability and morphology of HEK293 cells (Fig. S2), indicating that these proteins are not toxic to animal cells. Although N-GFP-C showed an extensive cytoplasmic signal in HEK293 cells, we were unable to detect unambiguous microtubule plus-end labeling. We demonstrate that the 12-kDa plant-specific Arabidopsis SPR1 protein is an autonomous microtubule plus end–tracking protein. Using truncations and mutations in SPR1, we reveal that the conserved N-terminal region and its GGG motif are critical for plus end–tracking activity, whereas the conserved C-terminal region and its PGGG motif are dispensable. Our GTPγS microtubule binding experiments showed that SPR1 targets growing microtubule ends by recognizing the GDP/Pi state of tubulin, similar to EB proteins. However, SPR1 does not share any sequence similarity with EBs or other known +TIPs. Therefore, our findings establish a new category of intrinsic +TIPs unique to plants. Because both SPR1 and EB1 proteins recognize the GDP/Pi tubulin structure, they might compete for binding sites at growing microtubule plus ends. Competitive binding of SPR1 and Arabidopsis EB1b proteins to the microtubule lattice has been observed in microtubule cosedimentation assays (16Galva C. Kirik V. Lindeboom J.J. Kaloriti D. Rancour D.M. Hussey P.J. Bednarek S.Y. Ehrhardt D.W. Sedbrook J.C. The microtubule plus-end tracking proteins SPR1 and EB1b interact to maintain polar cell elongation and directional organ growth in Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 2014; 26 (25415978): 4409-442510.1105/tpc.114.131482Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, mutant analysis suggests that SPR1 and EB1b have overlapping and sometimes antagonistic functions (16Galva C. Kirik V. Lindeboom J.J. Kaloriti D. Rancour D.M. Hussey P.J. Bednarek S.Y. Ehrhardt D.W. Sedbrook J.C. The microtubule plus-end tracking proteins SPR1 and EB1b interact to maintain polar cell elongation and directional organ growth in Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 2014; 26 (25415978): 4409-442510.1105/tpc.114.131482Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), consistent with SPR1 and EB1 competing for binding sites. SPR1 has been found to directly interact with EB1b (16Galva C. Kirik V. Lindeboom J.J. Kaloriti D. Rancour D.M. Hussey P.J. Bednarek S.Y. Ehrhardt D.W. Sedbrook J.C. The microtubule plus-end tracking proteins SPR1 and EB1b interact to maintain polar cell elongation and directional organ growth in Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 2014; 26 (25415978): 4409-442510.1105/tpc.114.131482Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); however, our data show that this interaction is not required for the plus end–tracking activity of SPR1. It remains to be determined whether binding of SPR1 and EB1b modulates their microtubule binding affinity and/or their ability to recruit other proteins to growing microtubule plus ends. Previous work showed that the N- and C-terminal regions of SPR1 are individually not sufficient to bind to microtubules in vivo and do not rescue spr1 mutants (11Nakajima K. Furutani I. Tachimoto H. Matsubara H. Hashimoto T. SPIRAL1 encodes a plant-specific microtubule-localized protein required for directional control of rapidly expanding Arabidopsis cells.Plant Cell. 2004; 16 (15084720): 1178-119010.1105/tpc.017830Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, N-GFP-C was partially functional and localized to microtubule plus ends in vivo (11Nakajima K. Furutani I. Tachimoto H. Matsubara H. Hashimoto T. SPIRAL1 encodes a plant-specific microtubule-localized protein required for directional control of rapidly expanding Arabidopsis cells.Plant Cell. 2004; 16 (15084720): 1178-119010.1105/tpc.017830Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We found that both N-GFP-C and NC-GFP localize to growing microtubule plus ends in vitro, demonstrating that the N- and C-terminal regions, either separated or in tandem, are sufficient to target growing microtubule plus ends. These results also show that the spacing between the N- and C-terminal regions is not a critical determinant of SPR1’s plus end–tracking activity, consistent with the high level of variability in amino acid sequence and length of the central region of SPR1 (11Nakajima K. Furutani I. Tachimoto H. Matsubara H. Hashimoto T. SPIRAL1 encodes a plant-specific microtubule-localized protein required for directional control of rapidly expanding Arabidopsis cells.Plant Cell. 2004; 16 (15084720): 1178-119010.1105/tpc.017830Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 12Sedbrook J.C.

Despite localizing to growing microtubule plus ends, both N-GFP-C and NC-GFP only partially complement the spr1–6 mutant. The microtubule plus end binding affinity is about 2-fold lower for N-GFP-C and NC-GFP compared with full-length SPR1. In addition, although full-length SPR1 promotes microtubule dynamics, N-GFP-C and NC-GFP do not significantly affect microtubule dynamics. Together, these differences might explain why N-GFP-C and NC-GFP do not fully recapitulate SPR1 function in vivo. The N-terminal GGG and C-terminal PGGG motifs of SPR1 have been proposed to mediate microtubule binding based on their similarity to the microtubule binding repeats of the MAP2/tau family of microtubule-associated proteins (16Galva C.

https://openalex.org/W2973884986,"Purpose To evaluate the risk factors associated with recurrent disc hemorrhage (DH), defined for the present study as at least 3 occurrences of DH in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Methods A total of 178 POAG patients (89 eyes showing at least 3 occurrences of DH and 89 age-matched control eyes with a minimum of 10 years’ follow-up without DH) were included in a retrospective, case-control study. Ocular factors were evaluated by a retrospective chart review, and systemic factors were evaluated by a telephone survey. Associations between factors and recurrent DH were investigated by logistic regression analysis. The Kaplan–Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional-hazards regression models were used to evaluate glaucoma progression and to identify the factors predictive of glaucoma progression. Results Univariate regression analysis revealed the association of recurrent DH with low baseline intraocular pressure (IOP) [odds ratio (OR), 0.88; 95% confidential interval (CI), 0.80–0.98; P = 0.014], lower percentage reduction of IOP (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93–0.99; P = 0.020), cold extremities (OR, 2.80; 95% CI, 1.03–7.60; P = 0.043), prone or lateral decubitus sleeping position (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.13–4.03; P = 0.019), and sleeping disorders (OR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.05–5.15; P = 0.037). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that a lower percentage reduction in IOP (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93–1.00; P = 0.046) increased the risk of recurrent DH. The control group exhibited a greater cumulative probability of non-progression than the recurrent DH group (P = 0.01, by log-rank test). The Cox proportional-hazards regression model showed that recurrent DH was associated with glaucoma progression [hazard ratio (HR), 1.88; 95% CI; 1.66–3.05; P = 0.01. Conclusions Among the ocular and systemic factors, only lower-percentage reduction of IOP in POAG was associated with recurrent DH. DH recurrence is associated with glaucoma progression and may be dependent on IOP."
https://openalex.org/W2974057297,"Background Previous research indicated that birth order was associated with physical health outcomes in adulthood. However, evidence on its association with mental health was lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate if birth order was associated with mental wellbeing and psychological distress at mid-life, stratified by gender, and taking into account confounding factors in childhood and adulthood. Method The sample consisted of 9,354 participants of the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70). The Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), the Malaise Index and attending a doctor’s consultation in the past year for a mental health issue at age forty-two were used to assess mental wellbeing and psychological distress in midlife. Birth order was ascertained via a parental questionnaire and referred to the numerical birth position of the participants. The associations between birth order, mental wellbeing and psychological distress were tested using linear and logistic regression adjusting for birth characteristics: smoking during pregnancy, maternal age, mother’s marital status, father’s employment, region of birth, parental years of education and parental social class, and factors at age 42: years of education, employment status and partnership status. Potential mediating variables including breastfeeding and birthweight at birth and parental separation and conduct disorder measured at age ten were also taken into account. Results We find no evidence to support an association between birth order and midlife psychological distress or attending a doctor’s consultation in both men and women. In unadjusted analysis, there was an association between birth order four and above and a reduced WEMWBS score of -0.79 (95% CI -1.57, -0.02) in men only. This association was attenuated after adjusting for birth characteristics and mediators at birth (0.86, 95% -1.78, 0.07) but was maintained once conduct disorder at age 10 was accounted for (-1.19, 95% CI -2.28, -0.09). However, this association was attenuated once again after adjusting for employment status, years in education and partnership status in adulthood (-1.04, 95% CI -2.11, 0.03). Conclusions In this study, birth order was not associated with psychological distress or having a mental health issue at midlife. Accounting for employment status, years of education and partnership status in adulthood attenuated the relationship between birth order and mental wellbeing."
https://openalex.org/W2973759148,"Purpose To investigate intraocular pressure (IOP) readings by non-contact tonometry (NCT) and Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT) for patients with different degrees of bilateral tearing. Methods In this study, we reviewed the medical charts of patients complaining of different degrees of bilateral tearing. The tear meniscus height (TMH) and IOP with NCT and GAT were measured. In each patient, a comparison of IOP readings between the eye with lower TMH and the contralateral eye with higher TMH was evaluated. The TMH was graded as follows: grade 1 (low): TMH < 0.2 mm; grade 2 (moderate): 0.2 mm ≤ TMH < 0.6 mm; grade 3 (high): TMH ≥ 0.6 mm. Subsequently, a comparison of IOP readings among eyes with low, moderate, and high TMH was also performed. Results A total of 120 eyes of 60 patients were enrolled. When comparing the two eyes of a patient, the eye with higher TMH showed higher NCT readings and larger difference in IOP readings between the two tonometries than the eye with lower TMH (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). When TMH was classified into grades according to the degree, the high TMH eyes showed higher NCT readings than did the low and moderate TMH eyes (P < 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). In addition, the high TMH eyes showed a larger difference in IOP readings between the two tonometries than did the low and moderate TMH eyes (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). Conclusion Eyes with higher TMH showed higher NCT readings and a larger difference in IOP between the two tonometries (NCT and GAT) than those with lower TMH. In patients with tearing, the NCT value may be inaccurate, so it is necessary to measure the GAT."
