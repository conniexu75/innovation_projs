https://openalex.org/W2908788147,"The ability of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) to form clusters has been linked to increased metastatic potential. Yet biological features and vulnerabilities of CTC clusters remain largely unknown. Here, we profile the DNA methylation landscape of single CTCs and CTC clusters from breast cancer patients and mouse models on a genome-wide scale. We find that binding sites for stemness- and proliferation-associated transcription factors are specifically hypomethylated in CTC clusters, including binding sites for OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, and SIN3A, paralleling embryonic stem cell biology. Among 2,486 FDA-approved compounds, we identify Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitors that enable the dissociation of CTC clusters into single cells, leading to DNA methylation remodeling at critical sites and metastasis suppression. Thus, our results link CTC clustering to specific changes in DNA methylation that promote stemness and metastasis and point to cluster-targeting compounds to suppress the spread of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2909520779,"Here, we describe a novel pathogenic entity, the activated PMN (polymorphonuclear leukocyte, i.e., neutrophil)-derived exosome. These CD63+/CD66b+ nanovesicles acquire surface-bound neutrophil elastase (NE) during PMN degranulation, NE being oriented in a configuration resistant to α1-antitrypsin (α1AT). These exosomes bind and degrade extracellular matrix (ECM) via the integrin Mac-1 and NE, respectively, causing the hallmarks of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Due to both ECM targeting and α1AT resistance, exosomal NE is far more potent than free NE. Importantly, such PMN-derived exosomes exist in clinical specimens from subjects with COPD but not healthy controls and are capable of transferring a COPD-like phenotype from humans to mice in an NE-driven manner. Similar findings were observed for another neutrophil-driven disease of ECM remodeling (bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD]). These findings reveal an unappreciated role for exosomes in the pathogenesis of disorders of ECM homeostasis such as COPD and BPD, providing a critical mechanism for proteolytic damage."

A characteristic feature of the neocortex is its laminar organization. The cortical columnar microcircuitry is viewed as a stack of interconnected yet distinct neuronal networks in which each lamina possesses somewhat unique patterns with different specific inputs, projection targets, and feedback connections (Mountcastle, 1997Mountcastle V.B.

How the laminar structure relates to mesoscopic physiological patterns, such as local field potential (LFP) oscillations and physiological interactions of single neurons across layers, is not well understood. Numerous oscillatory and transient LFP patterns of functional relevance have been described in various neocortical regions. However, their relationship to afferents, intracortical connectivity, and the firing patterns of individual neurons has been largely unexplored (Mitzdorf, 1987Mitzdorf U.

Using multisite recording silicon probes that span all cortical layers, we sought to characterize layer-specific physiological patterns and neuronal cross-talk between layers in the primary visual cortex (V1) of freely behaving mice. The well-characterized anatomical connectivity and the diverse neuronal types of V1 (Jiang et al., 2015Jiang X. Shen S. Cadwell C.R. Berens P. Sinz F. Ecker A.S. Patel S. Tolias A.S.

Previous recordings in the hippocampus, using a similar approach, have led to a solid understanding of the relationship between extracellular signals and anatomical connectivity. LFP patterns can identify layers in vivo with <25–50 μm precision (Fujisawa et al., 2008Fujisawa S. Amarasingham A. Harrison M.T. Buzsáki G.

In these previous studies, layer boundaries were estimated mainly by depth criteria, and the relationship among LFP depth profiles, neuronal activity, and interlayer interactions in different behavioral states was not addressed quantitatively. Our goal was to define layers functionally in V1 of the mouse and relate them to classical anatomical layers. Because spontaneous mesoscopic patterns in the primate V1 are characterized by gamma (Engel et al., 2001Engel A.K. Fries P. Singer W.

Inhibition dominates sensory responses in the awake cortex.Nature. 2013; 493: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) oscillations, we searched for their corresponding patterns in the mouse. Finally, we examined the brain state-dependent spike transmission probabilities among putative principal cells and inhibitory interneurons across cortical layers in waking and sleep to quantify their brain state dependence. Mice (n = 19) were implanted with a single-shank, 64-site linear silicon probe and recorded during free behavior in their home cage. The probe was placed parallel with the orientation of the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the V1 (Figure 1). In our initial experiments, small electrolytic lesions were made to calibrate the positions of the recording sites with histological verification (n = 4; Figures 1A and S1). Subsequently, we used the characteristic depth distribution of LFPs and unit firing to identify five physiological landmarks that reliably anchored the recording sites in V1 across animals and recordings. The most prominent landmark was a large-amplitude peak of the depth profile of power between 500 Hz and 5 kHz corresponding to mid-layer 5 (Figure 1C, depth c). This peak likely reflected the aggregated power from the high firing rates of the large layer 5 pyramidal (Ray and Maunsell, 2010Ray S. Maunsell J.H. Differences in gamma frequencies across visual cortex restrict their possible use in computation.Neuron. 2010; 67: 885-896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The remaining four landmarks (Figures 1D and 1I, depths a, b, d, and e) were obtained from the depth distributions of the most prominent current source density (CSD) sinks and sources of spontaneous slow oscillations of non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (Steriade et al., 1993Steriade M. McCormick D.A. Sejnowski T.J. Thalamocortical oscillations in the sleeping and aroused brain.Science. 1993; 262: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar). To investigate the origin of landmarks a–e, we compared the slow oscillation sinks and sources with those of light-evoked responses in the waking mouse (Figures 1E and 1J; 100 ms light pulses). Visual stimulation produced an early sink (b′) at the border between layers 3 and 4, which likely reflected afferent activation from the lateral geniculate body (Mitzdorf, 1987Mitzdorf U. Properties of the evoked potential generators: current source-density analysis of visually evoked potentials in the cat cortex.Int. J. Neurosci. 1987; 33: 33-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The early sink was accompanied by a source in superficial layers (a′) and a sink-source pair corresponding to the border between layers 5 and 6 (sink, d′) and lower layer 6 (source, e′) (Reyes-Puerta et al., 2015Reyes-Puerta V. Sun J.J. Kim S. Kilb W. Luhmann H.J. Laminar and columnar structure of sensory-evoked multineuronal spike sequences in adult rat barrel cortex in vivo.Cereb. Cortex. 2015; 25: 2001-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, Niell and Stryker, 2008Niell C.M. Stryker M.P. Highly selective receptive fields in mouse visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 7520-7536Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Sink b, associated with the “UP” state of slow oscillation during non-REM sleep, was slightly but significantly deeper than the light-evoked sink b′ in the layer 3/4 border (39 ± 49 μm; p < 0.05, signed rank test; n = 13 mice; Figure 1F), whereas the other sinks and sources occurred at the same depth as those seen with visual stimulation (p > 0.05, signed rank test). Importantly, the distances between the five landmarks were consistent across animals and varied <100 μm from mouse to mouse (Figure 1G; n = 19). The consistent depth localization of spike power and CSD sinks and sources during non-REM sleep across animals allowed us to project all subsequent physiological data onto normalized depth coordinates and construct average maps across all animals (Figures 1I and 1J; STAR Methods). To test whether layers could be further disambiguated by the depth localization of LFPs, we examined coherence in the gamma band (30–100 Hz) across all recording sites (Figures 2A and S2). Each site served as a reference, and pairwise coherence with each of the remaining 63 sites was determined iteratively. Using a gradient-descent algorithm (Berényi et al., 2014Berényi A. Somogyvári Z. Nagy A.J. Roux L. Long J.D. Fujisawa S. Stark E. Leonardo A. Harris T.D. Buzsáki G. Large-scale, high-density (up to 512 channels) recording of local circuits in behaving animals.J. Neurophysiol. 2014; 111: 1132-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar; STAR Methods), the recording sites were clustered on the basis of their resulting cross-coherence matrix, resulting in six clusters whose five boundaries were consistent across animals when projected into normalized depth coordinates (Figure 2A; p > 0.05, signed rank test for cluster boundaries across animals). The depth distribution of the six gamma coherence clusters corresponded roughly to the six cortical layers in each brain state (Figures 2B and S2; p > 0.05, ANOVA for comparison across different states), suggesting that gamma oscillations in V1 have a highly specific laminar structure. To isolate layer-specific gamma oscillations by another method, we also used independent component analysis (ICA) decomposition of the band-passed (30–100 Hz) LFPs (Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2017Fernández-Ruiz A. Oliva A. Nagy G.A. Maurer A.P. Berényi A. Buzsáki G. Entorhinal-CA3 dual-input control of spike timing in the hippocampus by theta-gamma coupling.Neuron. 2017; 93: 1213-1226.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar; Figure S2). ICA yielded six main independent components (ICs) that were highly consistent across animals (p < 0.001, Spearman’s correlation for ICs spatial loadings), and their depth distribution was related to the anatomically defined layers (Figure 2C). This method has the additional advantage of removing volume-conducted currents (Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2012Fernández-Ruiz A. Makarov V.A. Benito N. Herreras O. Schaffer-specific local field potentials reflect discrete excitatory events at gamma frequency that may fire postsynaptic hippocampal CA1 units.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 5165-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that accounted for 0.34 ± 0.11 of V1 gamma LFP variance. The superficial gamma ICs had a significantly larger power compared with the deeper ones (top three versus bottom three; Figures 2D and S4; 0.14 ± 0.04 versus 0.08 ± 0.03 relative power for ICs 1–3 versus 4–6; p = 1.1 × 10−7, rank sum test). Spectral analysis of the LFP traces revealed depth- and brain state-dependent variation of characteristic frequencies (Figures 3 and S3). Slow oscillation power (0.5–3 Hz) was dominant in non-REM sleep (see Supplementary Information; brain state comparison: p = 4.0 × 10−4, Kruskal-Wallis test; n = 19 mice), especially in deeper layers (layer comparison: p = 4.1 × 10−5, Kruskal-Wallis test; Figures 3C and S3). Slow oscillation was phase-coupled to gamma frequency power in superficial layers (69 ± 12 Hz; modulation index 2.7 ± 0.5 × 10−3) and to the high-gamma (>100 Hz) band in deep layers (Figure 3D; modulation index 2.3 ± 0.3 × 10−3). Slow gamma oscillations (30–60 Hz) dominated in superficial layers, especially in the waking state followed by REM and non-REM sleep (Figures 3 and S3; p = 0.028). Although LFP phase coherence rapidly decreased across layers, especially at higher frequencies (Figure S2A), phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling revealed reliable interlaminar interactions. In the waking animal, the dominant 3–6 Hz band was phase-coupled to a 15–25 Hz band signal in multiple layers (22 ± 5 Hz; modulation index 4.8 ± 1.2 × 10−4), possibly corresponding to the spiky component of the pattern, to high gamma frequency (60–100 Hz) in the superficial layers (90 ± 13 Hz, modulation index 2.7 ± 0.7 × 10−4), and to the epsilon band (>100 Hz) in layer 5 (modulation index 6.4 ± 1.8 × 10−4), likely reflecting unit firing (Figure 3D). The most prominent LFP pattern in the waking mouse was a 3–6 Hz oscillation with largest power in layer 4 (Figure 3C, level b; p = 2.0 × 10−6, Kruskal-Wallis test; n = 19 mice). This strong power increase was due mainly to frequent epochs of a 3–6 Hz rhythm during waking immobility, in which the waveforms occasionally split into short “spike” and longer “wave” components with a depth profile distribution similar to the depth distribution of alpha waves (8–12 Hz) in monkey V1 (Bollimunta et al., 2008Bollimunta A. Chen Y. Schroeder C.E. Ding M. Neuronal mechanisms of cortical alpha oscillations in awake-behaving macaques.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 9976-9988Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar; Figures 3A and 3B). The 3–6 Hz band was cross-frequency phase-coupled to a 15–25 Hz band signal in multiple layers (22 ± 5 Hz, modulation index 4.8 ± 1.2 × 10−4), possibly corresponding to the spiky component of the pattern, to high gamma frequency (60–100 Hz) in the superficial layers (90 ± 13 Hz, modulation index 2.7 ± 0.7 × 10−4), and to the epsilon band (>100 Hz) in layer 5 (modulation index 6.4 ± 1.8 × 10−4), likely reflecting unit firing (Figure 3D). CSD analysis of the 3–6 Hz rhythm showed a depth distribution of sinks and sources similar to those of the slow oscillation (compare Figure 3E with Figure 1I). The duration of the non-spiking periods of this waking rhythm (50–150 ms) was also similar to the DOWN state of slow oscillation. However, whereas the spiking-associated phase of the waking 3–6 Hz rhythm was short, the duration of the UP state of slow oscillation varied extensively and showed a lognormal distribution (Watson et al., 2016Watson B.O. Levenstein D. Greene J.P. Gelinas J.N. Buzsáki G. Network homeostasis and state dynamics of neocortical sleep.Neuron. 2016; 90: 839-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Both principal cells and interneurons were strongly phase-locked to the trough of the layer 4-recorded 3–6 Hz rhythm (Figure 3F). Volume-conducted theta power (6–9 Hz) from the hippocampus allowed us to distinguish between waking immobility and ambulation (STAR Methods). As soon as the animal started moving, the 3–6 Hz rhythm vanished, accompanied by increased slow gamma power. The antagonism between movement and the 3–6 Hz oscillation was quantified by the negative correlation between its power and the power of theta oscillation (p < 0.01, signed rank test; Figure S2C). Visual stimulation also blocked an ongoing 3–6 Hz rhythm. However, the offset of visual stimulus often induced a short rebound train 3–6 Hz oscillation (Einstein et al., 2017Einstein M.C. Polack P.O. Tran D.T. Golshani P. Visually evoked 3-5 Hz membrane potential oscillations reduce the responsiveness of visual cortex neurons in awake behaving mice.J. Neurosci. 2017; 37: 5084-5098Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar; Figure S2I). Because “layer” designation is traditionally based on the depth distribution of cell bodies, whereas our depth classification of the LFP patterns (Figure 2) reflects largely a combination of afferent-dendritic excitation and inhibition, we sought to establish a disciplined way to relate LFP-, CSD-, and ICA-based depth estimation to the recorded neurons in different anatomically defined layers. Unit clustering was performed as described previously (Fujisawa et al., 2008Fujisawa S. Amarasingham A. Harrison M.T. Buzsáki G. Behavior-dependent short-term assembly dynamics in the medial prefrontal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 823-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) using one session from each of the 19 mice, yielding a total of 1,472 units. The physiological identity of clustered units was determined using a multi-step approach (Figure 4). First, the unfiltered waveform was quantified by the trough-to-peak latency of the extracellular spike (Fujisawa et al., 2008Fujisawa S. Amarasingham A. Harrison M.T. Buzsáki G. Behavior-dependent short-term assembly dynamics in the medial prefrontal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 823-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, Senzai and Buzsáki, 2017Senzai Y.

Stryker M.P. Highly selective receptive fields in mouse visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 7520-7536Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). This initial classification yielded a bimodal distribution of units with narrow-waveform spikes (putative interneurons, n = 251 I cells) and wide-waveform spikes (putative principal cells, n = 1,075 E cells; Figure 4A; for unclassified units, see Figure S4). We next took advantage of the simultaneously recorded units to physiologically identify them as E cells or I cells by their short-latency temporal interactions with other neurons (Fujisawa et al., 2008Fujisawa S. Amarasingham A. Harrison M.T. Buzsáki G. Behavior-dependent short-term assembly dynamics in the medial prefrontal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 823-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Putative monosynaptic connections are associated with precisely timed spike transmission at short-latency (<4 ms) offsets between two recorded neurons, as detected by narrow significant peaks (excitatory) or troughs (inhibitory) in the cross-correlogram (CCG; Figures 4B and 4C; Alonso and Martinez, 1998Alonso J.M. Martinez L.M. Functional connectivity between simple cells and complex cells in cat striate cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, Barthó et al., 2004Barthó P. Hirase H. Monconduit L. Zugaro M. Harris K.D. Buzsáki G. Characterization of neocortical principal cells and interneurons by network interactions and extracellular features.J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 92: 600-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Using these criteria, 347 and 100 units were classified as CCG-based E and I cells, respectively (Figure 4A). These CCG-based classification results overlapped well with the waveform-based classification results (97.4% of CCG-based E cells were classified as waveform-based E cells, and 98.0% of CCG-based I cells were classified as waveform-based I cells), supporting the adequate separation on the basis of trough-to-peak latency feature. We also validated the physiological identification of inhibitory neurons using an optogenetic strategy. A subset of neurons in PV-Cre::Ai32 (n = 5) and VGAT-Cre::Ai32 (n = 9) mice were identified optogenetically as inhibitory neurons (Figures 4D and 4E; blue and green diamonds, respectively, in Figure 4A). Fourteen of 15 optogenetically identified PV cells (n = 11) and 40 of 52 VGAT cells were part of the inhibitory group defined by the spike waveform criterion. These results further support the adequate separation of I cells on the basis of waveform only and also show that a minor fraction of inhibitory neurons (n = 12 of 52) had wider waveforms and were initially falsely combined with the E cell group. To link neurons to physiological layers, we examined the relationship between the six gamma ICs and spiking of all neurons. Similar to the LFP-only analysis, spike-IC phase coupling (STAR Methods) also showed clear depth stratification, indicating that units were preferentially modulated by local gamma oscillations (Figures 5A and S5). Around and above depth level b (i.e., layer 3/4 border; first three components), unit-IC coupling of both putative E and I neurons had a peak in the slow gamma range. In deep layers, unit-IC coupling shifted toward the fast gamma band. This fast gamma (60–100 Hz) phase preference also segregated E and I neurons along the cortical depth (Figure S5). We therefore used the spike-gamma phase coupling profile of all units against the six ICs to perform K-means clustering (STAR Methods). This procedure yielded eight clusters (Figure 5B). By projecting back the K-means-clustered units to cortical depth, we found that the clusters largely corresponded to the anatomically defined cell body layers (Figure 5C). The top two clusters may correspond to neurons in layers 2 and 3 (blue and cyan), and the third cluster surrounded landmark b (green) and corresponded to the layer 3/4 border sink (Figure 1I). Three clusters surrounded landmark c (yellow, red, and pink), the presumed center of layer 5, with the lowest of the three clusters surrounding landmark d, the deep sink, likely corresponding to layer 5/6 (Reyes-Puerta et al., 2015Reyes-Puerta V. Sun J.J. Kim S. Kilb W. Luhmann H.J. Laminar and columnar structure of sensory-evoked multineuronal spike sequences in adult rat barrel cortex in vivo.Cereb. Cortex. 2015; 25: 2001-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The bottom two clusters (black and gray) were designated as layer 6 neurons. The remaining unit analyses were performed on these clustered groups of neurons. The various physiological features of the recorded principal neurons as a function of depth are summarized in Figure 6 (see Figure S6 for interneurons). Long-term mean firing rates of V1 principal cells showed a strongly skewed distribution in each layer. The fastest firing group corresponded to those in layers 5A and B (Figure 6, red and magenta groups), while the slowest ones were the superficial layers (Figure 6A; p = 3.7 × 10−83, Kruskal-Wallis test). Deep-layer neurons were significantly more active during waking compared with non-REM sleep (Figure 6B; see Figure S6 for other state comparisons) (Sakata and Harris, 2012Sakata S. Harris K.D.

Synaptic computation and sensory processing in neocortical layer 2/3.Neuron. 2013; 78: 28-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). A characteristic physiological feature of cortical pyramidal neurons is their bursting property (Nowak et al., 2003Nowak L.G. Azouz R. Sanchez-Vives M.V. Gray C.M. McCormick D.A. Electrophysiological classes of cat primary visual cortical neurons in vivo as revealed by quantitative analyses.J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 89: 1541-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Bursting was determined by calculating the number of spikes in the 3–10 ms bins of the spike autocorrelograms divided by the number of spikes in the 200–300 ms bin. In general, superficial layer neurons exhibited more bursting behavior, followed by layer 6 and layer 4 neurons, while layer 5 neurons had the lowest burst indices (Figure 6C; p = 5.2 × 10−37, Kruskal-Wallis test). Another measure of spike dynamic is the relationship of the neuron’s initial phasic response versus sustained firing to a given input. We calculated this transient/steady firing rate index by dividing the peak firing rates at 0–200 ms by the mean firing rates at 100–200 ms after the UP state onset of slow oscillation (Figures 6D and S2C). By this measure, deep layer 5 neurons showed the strongest transient responses (layer difference, p = 5.6 × 10−10). During the DOWN-UP state transition, layer 5B neurons fired first, followed by superficial and layer 6 neurons (Sakata and Harris, 2009Sakata S. Harris K.D.

However, although it is clearly important to better understand EVs' roles in organismal biology, EVs in solid tissues have received little attention. Here, we modified a protocol for EV isolation from primary neural cell culture to collect EVs from frozen whole murine and human neural tissues by serial centrifugation and purification on a sucrose gradient. Quantitative proteomics comparing brain-derived EVs from nontransgenic (NTg) and a transgenic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) mouse model, superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1)G93A, revealed that these EVs contain canonical exosomal markers and are enriched in synaptic and RNA-binding proteins. The compiled brain EV proteome contained numerous proteins implicated in ALS, and EVs from SOD1G93A mice were significantly depleted in myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein compared with those from NTg animals. We observed that brain- and spinal cord–derived EVs, from NTg and SOD1G93A mice, are positive for the astrocyte marker GLAST and the synaptic marker SNAP25, whereas CD11b, a microglial marker, was largely absent. EVs from brains and spinal cords of the SOD1G93A ALS mouse model, as well as from human SOD1 familial ALS patient spinal cord, contained abundant misfolded and nonnative disulfide-cross-linked aggregated SOD1. Our results indicate that CNS-derived EVs from an ALS animal model contain pathogenic disease-causing proteins and suggest that brain astrocytes and neurons, but not microglia, are the main EV source."

Our work identifies networks of DDPs that provoke endogenous DNA damage and may reveal DNA damage-associated functions of many human known and newly implicated cancer-promoting proteins. DNA damage often underlies “spontaneous” mutations (Tubbs and Nussenzweig, 2017Tubbs A. Nussenzweig A. Endogenous DNA Damage as a Source of Genomic Instability in Cancer.Cell. 2017; 168: 644-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar) that drive cancer, genetic diseases, and evolution. DNA damage can result from exogenous agents such as radiation or tobacco smoke; indeed, most known carcinogens are DNA-damaging agents and mutagens. Most DNA damage is generated endogenously in cells (Tubbs and Nussenzweig, 2017Tubbs A. Nussenzweig A. Endogenous DNA Damage as a Source of Genomic Instability in Cancer.Cell. 2017; 168: 644-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar) by intrinsic cellular processes that involve macromolecules, including proteins. Presumably, misregulation of functional proteins may disturb cellular homeostasis in ways that provoke endogenous DNA damage. The identities and functions of endogenous DNA damage-promoting proteins in any organism are poorly understood (Figure 1A). One way to discover proteins that promote endogenous DNA damage is by overproduction—a natural event that occurs frequently by stochastic cell-to-cell variation (Elowitz et al., 2002Elowitz M.B. Levine A.J. Siggia E.D. Swain P.S. Stochastic gene expression in a single cell.Science. 2002; 297: 1183-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar) or copy number alteration and is a major driver of cancers (Zack et al., 2013Zack T.I.

Genet. 2013; 45: 1134-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). Given the DNA biology conservation across life (Makarova and Koonin, 2013Makarova K.S. Koonin E.V. Archaeology of eukaryotic DNA replication.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5: a012963Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), proteins that promote spontaneous DNA damage may be conserved, and their identification could potentially inform strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease, including cancer, aging, and pathogen evolution (Fitzgerald et al., 2017Fitzgerald D.M. Hastings P.J. Rosenberg S.M. Stress-induced mutagenesis: implications in cancer and drug resistance.Annu. Rev. Cancer Biol. 2017; 1: 119-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Some proteins that prevent or reduce endogenous DNA damage have been identified by loss-of-function mutations or knockdowns that increase DNA damage (Alvaro et al., 2007Alvaro D. Lisby M. Rothstein R.

Cell. 2009; 35: 228-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). DNA repair proteins are in this category. In contrast, no unbiased screen has been reported for proteins that actively promote endogenous DNA damage in cells. Although a nucleus-specific screen identified some (Lovejoy et al., 2009Lovejoy C.A. Xu X. Bansbach C.E. Glick G.G. Zhao R. Ye F. Sirbu B.M. Titus L.C. Shyr Y. Cortez D. Functional genomic screens identify CINP as a genome maintenance protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 19304-19309Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the numbers and range of functions of proteins and mechanisms that cause spontaneous endogenous DNA damage remain elusive. Here we report the comprehensive discovery in Escherichia coli of a large, diverse network of proteins that, when overproduced, lead to increased endogenous DNA damage: the DNA “damage-up” proteins (DDPs). Their human homologs behave similarly in human cells and predict cancer mortality and mutation loads. Bacterial and human DDPs increase mutation rates and share common mechanisms of DNA damage instigation, three of which we identify. The identities and functions of the bacterial and human DDPs provide important general models for illuminating mechanisms of genesis of spontaneous endogenous DNA damage and may inform the discovery of cancer-promoting functions of many known and newly discovered cancer-driving proteins. We screened an inducible overexpression library of all E. coli genes in two steps to identify clones with increased endogenous DNA damage (Figure 1B). For both, we measured the fluorescence of cells with a fluorescence reporter gene driven by an SOS DNA damage response-activated promoter (Nehring et al., 2016Nehring R.B. Gu F. Lin H.Y. Gibson J.L. Blythe M.J. Wilson R. Bravo Núñez M.A. Hastings P.J. Louis E.J. Frisch R.L. et al.An ultra-dense library resource for rapid deconvolution of mutations that cause phenotypes in Escherichia coli.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: e41Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar; Figure 1B), which reports DNA damage response induction (Pennington and Rosenberg, 2007Pennington J.M. Rosenberg S.M. Spontaneous DNA breakage in single living Escherichia coli cells.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar; Figures S1A and S1B). The primary screen used a high-throughput but low-resolution fluorescence plate reader to identify potential clones with increased DNA damage (Figures 1B and 1C; STAR Methods), and then false positives were eliminated using high-resolution flow cytometry (Figures 1B and 1D; STAR Methods), reporting DNA damage at the single-cell level (Pennington and Rosenberg, 2007Pennington J.M. Rosenberg S.M. Spontaneous DNA breakage in single living Escherichia coli cells.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Flow cytometry validated 208 proteins as genuine DDPs that increase DNA damage when overproduced (Figures 1E and 1F; Table S1). Additional confirmation of their DNA damage promotion is shown in Figures 1G and S1C and Table S1. Three additional, independent strategies demonstrated that all 208 are genuine DDPs (STAR Methods), including an assay for persistent single-stranded (damaged) DNA detected as foci of a fluorescent partial-function DNA damage sensor protein, RecA∗GFP (Renzette et al., 2005Renzette N. Gumlaw N. Nordman J.T. Krieger M. Yeh S.P. Long E. Centore R. Boonsombat R. Sandler S.J. Localization of RecA in Escherichia coli K-12 using RecA-GFP.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1074-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar; Figure 1H). DDPs span diverse cellular roles (Figure 1F; Table S1), with only 8% being known DNA repair proteins. Normally, DNA repair proteins reduce DNA damage; their overproduction here might perturb undamaged DNA, titrate repair partner proteins away from DNA damage, and/or inhibit DNA repair by direct or indirect means. We call all of these proteins DDPs because they increase cellular levels of endogenous DNA damage when overproduced. The 208 DDPs display properties of protein networks. Functionally, all cause increased DNA damage upon overproduction and show increased protein-protein association compared with random sets of E. coli proteins and slight but significant co-expression (Figure S2A, legend), all indicating a network. We estimate that the E. coli DDP network will exceed the 208 proteins identified, with at least 369 DDPs predicted: about 9% of E. coli protein-coding genes (STAR Methods). That perturbation of diverse aspects of cell biology can indirectly or directly promote DNA damage (Figure 1F; Table S1) may explain why such a large fraction of genes promote endogenous DNA damage when dysregulated. We tested the hypothesis that triggering endogenous DNA damage would increase mutation rates (Figure 1A) with 32 representative E. coli DDPs (STAR Methods; Table S1). The data (Figure 1I) show that increased endogenous DNA damage corresponds with elevated mutation rates, as confirmed by sequencing (Figure S1F), which also revealed various kinds of mutations including base substitutions, insertions or deletions (indels), transpositions, and gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs; Figure S1F). These mimic increased small mutations and GCRs in various cancers (Stratton, 2011Stratton M.R. Exploring the genomes of cancer cells: progress and promise.Science. 2011; 331: 1553-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Although the SOS response induces mutations by upregulating the error-prone DNA polymerases (Pols) V and IV, many of the mutations differ from common polymerase V and IV errors, suggesting that types of DNA damage, not merely SOS response induction, may influence the kinds and rates of mutations made (Figure S1F; Table S1). Thus, overproduction of diverse E. coli proteins causes DNA-damage and mutations of essentially all kinds (Figures 1I and S1F; Table S1). We identified 284 human proteins with an amino acid similarity to 58 E. coli DDPs (homologs; STAR Methods; Figure 2A; Table S2). These are candidate human DDPs (hDDPs). The remaining E. coli DDPs are mostly analogs of human proteins (they function similarly but are not homologous; Table S1). 163 E. coli DDPs have identifiable human analogs, homologs, or both. The human homologs constitute a protein-protein association network more than random human homologs of E. coli proteins (Figures 2B and S2B). Only 5.6% are known DNA repair proteins (Figure 2A). The human homologs are overrepresented among known (Forbes et al., 2015Forbes S.A. Beare D. Gunasekaran P. Leung K. Bindal N. Boutselakis H. Ding M. Bamford S. Cole C. Ward S. et al.COSMIC: exploring the world’s knowledge of somatic mutations in human cancer.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: D805-D811Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar) and predicted (D’Antonio and Ciccarelli, 2013D’Antonio M. Ciccarelli F.D. Integrated analysis of recurrent properties of cancer genes to identify novel drivers.Genome Biol. 2013; 14: R52Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) gain- and loss-of-function cancer-driving genes, with or without inclusion of known DNA repair proteins (Figure 2C; Table S3). Human homologs of random E. coli proteins are not overrepresented, showing that DDP homologs, not conserved proteins, generally are cancer-associated (STAR Methods). Our analysis of data from an overexpression screen in human cells (Lovejoy et al., 2009Lovejoy C.A. Xu X. Bansbach C.E. Glick G.G. Zhao R. Ye F. Sirbu B.M. Titus L.C. Shyr Y. Cortez D. Functional genomic screens identify CINP as a genome maintenance protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 19304-19309Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) also shows cancer association (STAR Methods). Only one protein, FIGNL1, overlaps with our 284 hDDP candidates, indicating many new genes revealed by the E. coli screen. hDDP candidate genes show increased copy numbers in human cancers in patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (Gao et al., 2013Gao J. Aksoy B.A. Dogrusoz U. Dresdner G. Gross B. Sumer S.O. Sun Y. Jacobsen A. Sinha R. Larsson E. et al.Integrative analysis of complex cancer genomics and clinical profiles using the cBioPortal.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6: pl1Crossref PubMed Scopus (8703) Google Scholar). About 40% have increased copy numbers (Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer [GISTIC] threshold copy number gain ≥ 1) compared with fewer than 20% of non-DDP genes increased in those cancers (Figure 2D; p = 0.04, one-way Fisher’s exact test), suggesting that their overexpression is associated with cancers. Table S4 shows homologs with copy number increases (Figures S3A–S3C). In at least three cancer types, overexpression of the 284 homolog RNAs, relative to total mRNAs, is associated with decreased overall survival (Figure 2E), even with known or predicted drivers excluded (Figures S3D–S3H), indicating the cancer relevance of network genes not known previously to drive cancers. Moreover, increased levels of the 284 RNAs are strongly associated with total tumor mutation loads in 12 or more cancer types (Figure 2F; STAR Methods), including with known or predicted drivers excluded (Figure 2F). The data imply that previously unsuspected cancer gene candidates also promote mutagenesis. These data highlight the network properties of the 284 DDP homologs, their frequent overexpression in cancers, and predictive power for poor survival and high tumor mutation loads. We validated a sample of candidate hDDPs as genuine DNA damage instigators in human cells (Figure 3), cloning several de novo (STAR Methods) to create 70 full-length sequence-verified overexpression GFP fusion genes, 3 human homologs of E. coli damage-down proteins as possible negative controls, and 20 negative-control random non-DDPs (Table S5; approximately half of the random human homologs of E. coli proteins). About half of the homologs are amplified in cancers in TCGA (Gao et al., 2013Gao J. Aksoy B.A. Dogrusoz U. Dresdner G. Gross B. Sumer S.O. Sun Y. Jacobsen A. Sinha R. Larsson E. et al.Integrative analysis of complex cancer genomics and clinical profiles using the cBioPortal.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6: pl1Crossref PubMed Scopus (8703) Google Scholar). We performed three flow cytometric assays (Figure 3A) for increased DNA damage (STAR Methods). The assays measure increased γH2AX levels, a DNA double-strand-break (DSB) marker (Kinner et al., 2008Kinner A. Wu W. Staudt C. Iliakis G. Gamma-H2AX in recognition and signaling of DNA double-strand breaks in the context of chromatin.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 5678-5694Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar); γH2AX in cells treated with a nonhomologous break repair (DNA-PK [protein kinase]) inhibitor (sensitized screen); and phospho-p53, a DNA damage marker (Sakaguchi et al., 1998Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. DNA damage activates p53 through a phosphorylation-acetylation cascade.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). 45% of the human homologs (33 of 73) showed increased DNA damage (Figure 3B), a highly significant enrichment compared with 20 random human proteins (p < 0.0001, one-way Fisher’s exact test; Figures S3I–S3K; Table S6). The 45% validation rate is higher than for a candidate DNA or nucleus-associated protein screen for increased DNA damage, in which 1.7% of candidate proteins were validated (Lovejoy et al., 2009Lovejoy C.A. Xu X. Bansbach C.E. Glick G.G. Zhao R. Ye F. Sirbu B.M. Titus L.C. Shyr Y. Cortez D. Functional genomic screens identify CINP as a genome maintenance protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 19304-19309Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (p = 1 × 10−36, Fisher’s exact test), demonstrating the predictive power of the E. coli screen. Our validation rate is probably underestimated because the human assays are biased toward DSB detection, and only 41% of E. coli DDPs promote DSBs (Table S1)—a number similar to the 45% of hDDPs validated in our assays. The γH2AX assays (Figure 3A, assays I and II) are DSB-specific (Shee et al., 2013Shee C. Cox B.D. Gu F. Luengas E.M. Joshi M.C. Chiu L.Y. Magnan D. Halliday J.A. Frisch R.L. Gibson J.L. et al.Engineered proteins detect spontaneous DNA breakage in human and bacterial cells.eLife. 2013; 2: e01222Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), and only 4 of 33 validated hDDPs show a phospho-p53 signal without γH2AX (Figure 3B), implying a DSB bias of phospho-p53. Thus, many additional hDDP candidates may be genuine hDDPs that cause non-DSB DNA damage not detected by these assays. Overproduction of 4 of 4 validated hDDPs increased mutation rates compared with controls in human cells in forward mutation fluctuation test assays for hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) deficiency (Figure 3C). Thus, hDDPs may drive cancers by increasing genome instability—a cancer hallmark (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Hallmarks of cancer: the next generation.Cell. 2011; 144: 646-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42734) Google Scholar). The validated hDDPs encompass four classes (Figure 3E), none of which was predicted previously to promote DNA damage and some of which were not hypothesized to link to cancer (e.g., classes ii and iv). The rates of validation in each class allow us to estimate that many additional hDDPs populate the 284-protein candidate hDDP network that would test positive in our assays (STAR Methods). Approximately 75% of the validated hDDP genes show cancer-associated copy number increases in TCGA cancers (Gao et al., 2013Gao J. Aksoy B.A. Dogrusoz U. Dresdner G. Gross B. Sumer S.O. Sun Y. Jacobsen A. Sinha R. Larsson E. et al.Integrative analysis of complex cancer genomics and clinical profiles using the cBioPortal.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6: pl1Crossref PubMed Scopus (8703) Google Scholar) (GISTIC threshold copy number gain ≥ 1; Figure 3D), exceeding the candidates not validated (Figure 3D). The data imply that validated hDDPs may drive cancer via DNA damage when overproduced and that our DNA damage assays relate to human cancer biology. We used the tractable E. coli model to discover DDP functions, to bin the 208 E. coli DDPs into function clusters that reflect the molecular kinds, causes, and consequences of DNA damage provoked by their overproduction. The phenotypes are from seven quantitative functional assays, many at the single-cell level (Figure 4). We use the data to predict and demonstrate mechanisms by which diverse conserved proteins increase endogenous DNA damage. We quantified DSBs in single cells as fluorescent foci of the engineered DSB end-specific binding protein GamGFP (Shee et al., 2013Shee C. Cox B.D. Gu F. Luengas E.M. Joshi M.C. Chiu L.Y. Magnan D. Halliday J.A. Frisch R.L. Gibson J.L. et al.Engineered proteins detect spontaneous DNA breakage in human and bacterial cells.eLife. 2013; 2: e01222Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). GamGFP “traps” DSBs, prevents their repair in E. coli and mammalian cells, and labels DSB ends as foci with an estimated 70% efficiency (Shee et al., 2013Shee C. Cox B.D. Gu F. Luengas E.M. Joshi M.C. Chiu L.Y. Magnan D. Halliday J.A. Frisch R.L. Gibson J.L. et al.Engineered proteins detect spontaneous DNA breakage in human and bacterial cells.eLife. 2013; 2: e01222Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). 87 of the 208 E. coli DDP-overproducing clones showed more GamGFP foci than vector-only controls and 25 random SOS-negative (non-DDP) clones (Figures 4A, 4B, and S4A; Table S1; STAR Methods). Our finding that 121 (59%) of DDP-overproducing clones do not increase GamGFP foci suggests that single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), the SOS response-inducing signal, frequently accumulates at sites other than DSBs. The 41% of E. coli DDPs that elevate GamGFP, DSB foci are not enriched in any gene function category (Table S1), implying that DSBs result from diverse cellular processes. Stalling of DNA replication leads to DNA damage and can create four-way DNA junctions when stalled replication forks “reverse” (illustrated in Figure 4C). Reversed forks (RFs) block resumption of DNA replication, lead to replication fork breakage (Seigneur et al., 1998Seigneur M. Bidnenko V. Ehrlich S.D. Michel B. RuvAB acts at arrested replication forks.Cell. 1998; 95: 419-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), and reflect a cause of DNA damage—stalled replication. We quantified RFs as foci of the RuvCDefGFP (RDG) engineered four-way junction-specific DNA-binding protein in cells that lack the homology-directed repair (HDR) protein RecA, in which most or all RDG foci represent RFs (Xia et al., 2016Xia J. Chen L.T. Mei Q. Ma C.H. Halliday J.A. Lin H.Y. Magnan D. Pribis J.P. Fitzgerald D.M. Hamilton H.M. et al.Holliday junction trap shows how cells use recombination and a junction-guardian role of RecQ helicase.Sci. Adv. 2016; 2: e1601605Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We found that 106 of 208 DDP clones showed more RDG foci than vector-only and 30 other control clones (Figure 4D; Figure S4B; Table S1), and 49 also showed increased DSBs (Table S1), a significant correlation (p = 0.03, r = 0.15 Spearman’s correlation). Thus, 51% or more of DDPs promote replication stalling, indicating the importance of DNA replication for DNA-damage generation by many, but not all, of the proteins. We measured intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) using the peroxide indicator dye dihydrorhodamine (DHR) (Gutierrez et al., 2013Gutierrez A. Laureti L. Crussard S. Abida H. Rodríguez-Rojas A. Blázquez J. Baharoglu Z. Mazel D. Darfeuille F. Vogel J. Matic I. β-Lactam antibiotics promote bacterial mutagenesis via an RpoS-mediated reduction in replication fidelity.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and flow cytometry and found that 56 DDPs increased ROS levels (Figures 4F, S4C, and S4D). In at least 17 of the 56, DNA damage was reduced by the ROS-quenching agent thiourea (Figure 4G; Table S1). Thus, high endogenous ROS underlie DNA damage in a subset of the DDP-producing clones. These comprise five membrane-spanning transporters (investigated below), an excess compared with transporters among E. coli proteins (p = 0.002, hypergeometric test). 40% of the other 12 proteins relate to metabolism (Table S1), implying that perturbation of metabolic pathways can cause DNA damage by increasing ROS. Cells can lose DNA because of various problems, including chromosome segregation failure; for example, by incomplete DNA replication or HDR between chromosomes, which can leave two chromosomes attached at cell division. We identified 67 DDPs that increase DNA-depleted (“anucleate”) cells, using flow cytometry with DNA and cell membranes stained separately (Figures 4H, 4I, S4E, and S4F; Table S1). Overproduced DNA repair and replication proteins are enriched among these clones (p = 0.04, one-way Fisher’s exact test; Table S1), implying that excessive DNA repair and replication proteins promote DNA damage, resulting in DNA erosion or chromosome segregation failure. We assayed DNA repair capacity indirectly as sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents that induce damage repaired by specific DNA repair mechanisms: the DSB, ssDNA break, and ROS instigator phleomycin; the base-oxidizing agent hydrogen peroxide (H2O2); and the DNA cross-linking agent mitomycin C (MMC). These cause damage repaired by HDR (phleomycin), base excision repair (BER; H2O2), and both nucleotide excision repair and HDR (MMC). Of the 208 DDPs, 106, 75, and 10 were sensitive to phleomycin, H2O2, and MMC, respectively (Figures 4J–4L and S5A–S5E). Collectively, 140 DDP overproducers were sensitive to at least one DNA-damaging agent and 45 to multiple drugs (Table S1; Figure S5G). The DDPs are enriched for phleomycin and H2O2, (but not MMC) sensitivity compared with control non-DDP clones (Figure S5). We excluded the possibility that most DNA damage sensitivities resulted from DDP-induced heritable mutations or transcriptional downregulation of DNA repair genes (Figures S5F and S5H). Specific DNA repair pathways could be either inhibited directly or saturated by DNA damage caused by specific DDPs, implying that dysregulating diverse proteins can mimic DNA repair deficiency without mutations in DNA repair genes. We grouped quantitative data from the functional assays using stability-based clustering (Figures 4M, 4N, and S5G). The data on RDG (RF) foci analyzed with three other single-cell quantitative parameters—ROS levels, DNA loss, and DSBs—showed high RF loads in a specific cluster (Figure 4M) enriched for DNA-binding transcription factors (TFs), with 29% compared with 12% among the network as a whole (p = 0.002, one-way Fisher’s exact test; Figure 4M; Table S1). The data imply that distinct protein functions preferentially stall replication. The distinct groups shown by clustering the bulk culture data are shown in Figure S5G. Grouping all quantitative datasets revealed six discreet function clusters (Figure 4N; Table S1), which may indicate at least six different potential mechanisms and/or consequences of DNA damage via DDPs (Figures S2A, legend, and S5G). The RF-dense cluster in Figure 4M (clusters 5 and 6; Figure 4N) is most enriched for DNA-binding TFs (Table S1): transcriptional activators and repressors. Persistent binding of a protein to DNA might create a replication “roadblock,” which causes stalled and reversed forks. Supporting this hypothesis, mutational ablation of the DNA-binding domains (DBDs) of the TFs CsgD, HcaR, and MhpR abolished their promotion of SOS-inducing DNA damage and RDG (RF) foci (Figures 5A–5E and S6A). Thus, these TFs must bind DNA to provoke DNA damage and RFs. Also, the TF CsgD- or HcaR-mCherry fusions form foci DBD-dependently (Figures 5F and S6B), suggesting that foci reflect the DNA-bound TF. Most CsgD-mCherry and HcaR-mCherry foci co-localized with RDG (RF) foci (Figures 5F–5H). Foci are distinguishable ∼50 kb apart on DNA (Shee et al., 2013Shee C. Cox B.D. Gu F. Luengas E.M. Joshi M.C. Chiu L.Y. Magnan D. Halliday J.A. Frisch R.L. Gibson J.L. et al.Engineered proteins detect spontaneous DNA breakage in human and bacterial cells.eLife. 2013; 2: e01222Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar); thus, RDG, RF foci accumulate in the vicinity of TF-bound DNA. High-resolution genomic mapping of RDG by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) in CsgD-overproducing cells showed RDG (RFs) enriched near the TF’s DNA-binding sites CsgD-DBD-dependently (Figure 5I). CsgD has 10 experimentally determined binding sites, and we found CsgD-dependent RDG, RF ChIP-seq peaks to be very significantly enriched in 10-kb regions around these sites (Figures 5I and S7, legend). The RDG peaks occurred both upstream and downstream of the binding sites in the replication paths CsgD- and DBD-dependently (Figure S7, legend). Our data support a model (Figure 5J) in which overproduced DNA-bound TFs create replication roadblocks, causing fork stalling and reversal near TF-bound sites, generating DNA damage.Figure S6DNA-Binding Transcription Factor and Replication Stall (RDG) Foci Examples, Related to Figure 5Show full caption(A) Representative data show induction of RDG reversed-fork foci with production of DNA-binding transcription factors (TFs), DNA-binding-domain dependently.

CRISPR proteins have revolutionized genome modification, yet the CRISPR-Cas9 scaffold is not ideal for fusions or activation by cellular triggers. Here, we show that a topological rearrangement of Cas9 using circular permutation provides an advanced platform for RNA-guided genome modification and protection. Through systematic interrogation, we find that protein termini can be positioned adjacent to bound DNA, offering a straightforward mechanism for strategically fusing functional domains. Additionally, circular permutation enabled protease-sensing Cas9s (ProCas9s), a unique class of single-molecule effectors possessing programmable inputs and outputs. ProCas9s can sense a wide range of proteases, and we demonstrate that ProCas9 can orchestrate a cellular response to pathogen-associated protease activity. Together, these results provide a toolkit of safer and more efficient genome-modifying enzymes and molecular recorders for the advancement of precision genome engineering in research, agriculture, and biomedicine."

The development of cardiac hypertrophy in response to hemodynamic overload is considered initially beneficial, as it augments the number of contractile units and normalizes ventricular wall stress according to the Law of Laplace. Decreases in wall stress not only reduce oxygen consumption but also inhibit cell death (2Nakamura M. Sadoshima J. Mechanisms of physiological and pathological cardiac hypertrophy.Nat. Rev.

However, these adaptive responses have a limited capacity for protection and, in the presence of prolonged stress, will transition to heart failure (3Ruwhof C. van der Laarse A. Mechanical stress-induced cardiac hypertrophy: mechanisms and signal transduction pathways.Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 47: 23-3710.1016/S0008-6363(00)00076-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The heart also initiates additional adaptive mechanisms, including up-regulation of anti-oxidants and mitophagy, to cope with energetic stress, increased oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction (4Shirakabe A.

Yes-associated protein (YAP), a transcription cofactor and downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, regulates proliferation and survival in multiple cell types, including cardiomyocytes (CMs). We have shown that cardiac-specific loss of YAP in mice leads to increased CM apoptosis and a lethal dilated cardiomyopathy by 12 weeks of age. Heterozygous YAP depletion impaired hypertrophy and led to worsened heart function in response to volume overload imposed by chronic myocardial infarction (MI) in the mouse heart (5Del Re D.P.

The etiologies of heart failure are divergent and include PO, ischemia, valvular disease, cardiomyopathy, and congenital heart disease (1Benjamin E.J. Virani S.S. Callaway C.W. Chamberlain A.M.

Among these, PO-related pathological cardiac hypertrophy is one of the most common causes of heart failure (6Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Cardiac plasticity.N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 358 (18367740): 1370-138010.1056/NEJMra072139Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Pathophysiologically, cardiac hypertrophy is an increase in the heart muscle mass resulting from increases in CM size together with proliferation of fibroblasts and increased deposition of extracellular matrix (7Heineke J. Molkentin J.D. Regulation of cardiac hypertrophy by intracellular signalling pathways.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7 (16936699): 589-60010.1038/nrm1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). Cardiac hypertrophy can initially be an adaptive response, serving to maintain cardiac function through reduction in wall stress and energy expenditure (8Lorell B.H. Carabello B.A. Left ventricular hypertrophy: pathogenesis, detection, and prognosis.Circulation. 2000; 102 (10908222): 470-47910.1161/01.CIR.102.4.470Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). However, insufficient accompanying growth/proliferation of microvasculature leads to an inability to maintain an efficient blood supply in response to CM enlargement. The resulting supply of nutrients is inadequate and promotes metabolic dysfunction and, eventually, heart failure. PO stress increases ventricular strain. Interestingly, the Hippo pathway is regulated by mechanical stress (9Dupont S. Morsut L. Aragona M. Enzo E. Giulitti S. Cordenonsi M. Zanconato F. Le Digabel J. Forcato M. Bicciato S. Elvassore N.

The small G-protein RhoA is a critical modulator of the actin cytoskeleton and plays a key role in both actin stress fiber formation and focal adhesion complex assembly in many cell types (12Brown J.H.

In addition, RhoA has been shown to promote the activation of YAP in HEK293 cells through a mechanism dependent upon cytoskeletal integrity (13Mo J.S. Yu F.X. Gong R. Brown J.H. Guan K.L. Regulation of the Hippo-YAP pathway by protease-activated receptors (PARs).Genes Dev. 2012; 26 (22972936): 2138-214310.1101/gad.197582.112Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 14Yu F.X.

Prior studies have shown that RhoA affords cardioprotection in vivo and acts as a mediator of protein kinase D and Akt activation (15Xiang S.Y. Vanhoutte D. Del Re D.P. Purcell N.H. Ling H.

However, it remains unknown whether RhoA modulates Hippo-YAP in CMs or whether this potential mechanism influences the adaptive hypertrophic response to PO. To elucidate the role of YAP in CMs during acute PO, we subjected control and CM-specific heterozygous YAP knockout mice (YAP-CHKO) to PO or sham operation. Our data demonstrate that, in response to PO, YAP is activated in the myocardium through a RhoA-dependent mechanism. Haploinsufficiency of YAP in CMs led to attenuated hypertrophy, but increased fibrosis and apoptosis, and decreased cardiac function during PO. These findings suggest that activation of endogenous YAP during PO mediates adaptive hypertrophy and protects the heart against PO-induced cardiac dysfunction. To examine whether YAP is activated in the heart in response to PO, wildtype (WT) mice were subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) or sham operation and sacrificed at time points ranging from 6 h to 7 days. Under our experimental conditions, TAC significantly increased left ventricular (LV) weight/tibia length (LVW/TL), an index of cardiac hypertrophy, at 7 days in WT mice. Although TAC transiently increased lung weight/tibia length (lung W/TL), an index of lung congestion, 1 h after TAC, the index returned to baseline thereafter up to 7 days (Fig. S1). Immunoblot analyses of LV homogenates showed a significant increase in YAP protein 7 days after TAC compared with sham operation (Fig. 1A). YAP mRNA expression, as evaluated by quantitative PCR, was not significantly altered after TAC (Fig. 1B), suggesting that YAP protein up-regulation is due to increased translation or stabilization. Phosphorylation of YAP at Ser-127 promotes its cytosolic retention and subsequent degradation (17Wackerhage H. Del Re D.P. Judson R.N. Sudol M. Sadoshima J. The Hippo signal transduction network in skeletal and cardiac muscle.Sci. Signal. 2014; 7 (25097035): re410.1126/scisignal.2005096Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The ratio of Ser-127–phosphorylated YAP to total YAP was decreased after TAC in a time-dependent manner compared with sham (Fig. 1C). Decreased YAP phosphorylation can favor YAP retention in the nucleus. Phosphorylation of YAP at Ser-397 promotes its proteolytic degradation (18He M. Zhou Z. Shah A.A. Hong Y. Chen Q. Wan Y. New insights into posttranslational modifications of Hippo pathway in carcinogenesis and therapeutics.Cell Div. 2016; 11 (27042197): 410.1186/s13008-016-0013-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The ratio of Ser-397 phosphorylated YAP to total YAP also decreased 7 days after TAC (Fig. 1D), suggesting that YAP is stabilized. Although the level of Lats2, the kinase responsible for YAP phosphorylation at Ser-127, was increased in a time-dependent manner after TAC, phosphorylated Lats2/total Lats2 did not change significantly (Fig. 1E). This suggests that YAP regulation during acute PO may be independent of Lats2. Nuclear localization of YAP, as evaluated by immunofluorescence, was increased 7 days after TAC compared with sham operation (Fig. 1F). In addition, subcellular fractionation was conducted to separate cytosolic and nucleus-enriched fractions. The level of YAP in both cytosolic and nuclear fractions was increased significantly after TAC, compared with sham (Fig. 1, G and H). To test whether TAC-induced up-regulation and nuclear accumulation of YAP take place in CMs, CMs were isolated from mouse hearts subjected to 1 week of TAC or sham operation. Immunofluorescent staining showed that the number of CMs with nuclear YAP staining was significantly greater in hearts subjected to 1 week of TAC than in those subjected to sham operation (Fig. S2, A and B). Immunoblot analyses of CM lysates showed that phospho-YAP/total YAP was significantly smaller and total YAP was greater in myocytes isolated from mouse hearts subjected to TAC than in those isolated from sham-operated hearts. Taken together, these results indicate that total YAP protein and its nuclear localization in CMs are increased 1 week after TAC (Fig. S2, C, D, and E). In a recent study (19Ikeda S. Mizushima W. Sciarretta S. Abdellatif M. Zhai P. Mukai R. Fefelova N. Oka S.I. Nakamura M. Del Re D.P. Farrance I. Park J.Y. Tian B. Xie L.H.

Res. 2019; 124 (30582455): 292-30510.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.314048Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we found that YAP is inactivated during the decompensated phase of cardiac hypertrophy. Thus, we sought to determine the functional significance of cardiac YAP activation during the compensated phase of PO. To investigate the functional significance of YAP activation during the compensated phase of PO, we used heterozygous CM-specific YAP KO mice (Yap+/flox;CreαMHC, referred to as YAP-CHKO) (5Del Re D.P. Yang Y. Nakano N. Cho J. Zhai P. Yamamoto T. Zhang N. Yabuta N. Nojima H. Pan D. Sadoshima J. Yes-associated protein isoform 1 (Yap1) promotes cardiomyocyte survival and growth to protect against myocardial ischemic injury.J. Biol.

We used heterozygous KO mice because homozygous CM-specific YAP KO mice rapidly develop heart failure at baseline, even when a tamoxifen-inducible system is used. We subjected WT mice (Yap+/flox) and YAP-CHKO mice to either TAC for 7 days or sham operation. The level of YAP in the heart was significantly lower in YAP-CHKO mice than in WT mice subjected to either sham operation or TAC (Fig. 2, A and B). Ctgf (connective tissue growth factor), an established YAP target gene (20Zhao B. Ye X. Yu J. Li L. Li W. Li S. Yu J. Lin J.D. Wang C.Y. Chinnaiyan A.M. Lai Z.C. Guan K.L. TEAD mediates YAP-dependent gene induction and growth control.Genes Dev. 2008; 22 (18579750): 1962-197110.1101/gad.1664408Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar), was increased in WT mouse hearts 7 days after TAC, and this up-regulation was attenuated in YAP-CHKO mouse hearts (Fig. 2C). Similar results were obtained for Ankrd1 (ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein), another YAP target gene (Fig. 2D) (21Li C. Srivastava R.K. Elmets C.A. Afaq F. Athar M. Arsenic-induced cutaneous hyperplastic lesions are associated with the dysregulation of Yap, a Hippo signaling-related protein.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2013; 438 (23942117): 607-61210.1016/j.bbrc.2013.08.008Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These results suggest that YAP-CHKO mice are a useful model for evaluating the function of endogenous YAP in the heart after TAC. We asked whether down-regulation of endogenous YAP affects the initial TAC-induced hypertrophic response. At 7 days after TAC, postmortem measurements revealed that LVW/TL was significantly increased in both WT and YAP-CHKO TAC groups compared with sham. However, we observed a significant attenuation of LVW/TL in YAP-CHKO versus WT in response to TAC (Fig. 3A). Lung W/TL was significantly increased in both WT and YAP-CHKO TAC groups compared with sham, and there was no significant difference in lung W/TL between YAP-CHKO versus WT in response to TAC (Fig. 3B). To determine whether the blunted hypertrophy was accompanied by a reduction in individual CM size, we performed a histological analysis. Measurement of CM cross-sectional area revealed a significant attenuation in YAP-CHKO hearts compared with WT mice 7 days after TAC (Fig. 3C). mRNA expression of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) was increased significantly after TAC in both WT and YAP-CHKO mice compared with respective sham-operated mice (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, however, YAP-CHKO mice exhibited a greater increase in ANF mRNA after TAC than WT mice, consistent with the observation that YAP-CHKO mice exhibit greater LV wall stress than WT mice (see below). Down-regulation of YAP also inhibited increases in CM cell size induced by isoproterenol, a β-adrenergic receptor agonist, suggesting that endogenous YAP is essential in mediating hypertrophy in CMs (Fig. S3). To evaluate how down-regulation of YAP affects cardiac function during acute PO, echocardiography was performed 7 days after TAC (Table 1). YAP-CHKO and WT mice exhibited similar baseline LV systolic function. In response to 7 days of TAC, WT mice exhibited preserved systolic function, whereas YAP-CHKO mice exhibited significantly decreased LV function, as evaluated by fractional shortening (%FS) (Fig. 4, A and B). LV end-diastolic diameter after TAC was significantly greater in YAP-CHKO than in WT mice (Fig. 4C), whereas wall thickness was similar between YAP-CHKO and WT mice (Table 1). Laplace's Law states that the wall stress (WS) of the ventricle is proportional to the ventricular pressure (P) and its diameter (R) and is inversely proportional to the ventricular wall thickness (T), given by the formula WS = P.R/2T. Echocardiographic and hemodynamic measurements indicated that LV wall stress was significantly elevated in YAP-CHKO hearts compared with WT hearts 7 days after TAC (Fig. 4D).Table 1Echocardiographic analyses of WT and YAP-CHKO mice 7 days after TACWTYAP-CHKOShamTACShamTACn12141214DSEP WT (mm)0.79 ± 0.050.81 ± 0.100.77 ± 0.090.83 ± 0.09LVEDD (mm)3.44 ± 0.303.35 ± 0.243.58 ± 0.283.89 ± 0.29ap < 0.05 versus WT-TAC is shown.DPWT (mm)0.67 ± 0.070.72 ± 0.110.73 ± 0.060.73 ± 0.12LVESD (mm)2.30 ± 0.352.26 ± 0.352.57 ± 0.443.18 ± 0.37EF (%)68.4 ± 13.166.5 ± 15.462.1 ± 12.144.2 ± 14.0ap < 0.05 versus WT-TAC is shown.,bp < 0.05 versus YAP-CHKO-SHAM is shown.

These data suggest that YAP in CMs is required for the maintenance of cardiac function and that decreased levels of YAP result in rapid chamber dilation and transition to heart failure during acute PO.Table 2Hemodynamic measurements of WT and YAP-CHKO mice 7 days after TACWTYAP-CHKOShamTACShamTACn10141014+dP/dt (mm Hg/s)7750 ± 13275839 ± 1403ap < 0.05 versus WT-Sham mice.5625 ± 1579bp < 0.01 versus WT-Sham mice.4964 ± 1397cp < 0.001 versus WT-TAC mice.−dP/dt (mm Hg/s)7520 ± 10796339 ± 19505125 ± 1165bp < 0.01 versus WT-Sham mice.4732 ± 1908dp < 0.001 versus WT-TAC mice.LVEDP (mm Hg)5.58 ± 1.5612.29 ± 3.29ap < 0.05 versus WT-Sham mice.7.8 ± 4.516.57 ± 5.80dp < 0.001 versus WT-TAC mice.,ep < 0.05 versus YAP-CHKO-Sham.

Open table in a new tab Myocardial apoptosis and fibrosis were evaluated by TUNEL and Masson's Trichrome staining, respectively (Fig. 5). PO for 7 days was not sufficient to induce a significant increase in either myocardial apoptosis or fibrosis in WT mice. However, we observed significant increases in both apoptosis and fibrosis in YAP-CHKO hearts following 7 days of TAC compared with WT mouse hearts (Fig. 5). These results suggest that endogenous YAP in CMs protects the heart against apoptosis and fibrosis during the acute phase of PO. YAP promotes cell cycle progression and/or cell proliferation in noncardiac cell types, as well as in CMs in the embryonic heart (22von Gise A. Lin Z. Schlegelmilch K. Honor L.B. Pan G.M. Buck J.N.

Although the adult heart has a limited capacity for regeneration, a small population of CMs can re-enter the cell cycle in response to injury and may confer a regenerative benefit to the heart (24Beltrami A.P.

Therefore, we investigated the effect of YAP deletion on CM proliferation under acute PO stress. We stained heart sections for Ki-67 and the CM marker troponin-T. Quantitative analyses revealed that there was a small population of Ki-67–positive CMs in WT hearts in response to PO (Fig. 6, A and B). However, we observed no significant increase in the number of Ki-67–positive CMs in YAP-CHKO mouse hearts after TAC compared with sham. These data suggest that YAP deficiency in CMs results in repressed CM cell cycle re-entry in response to short-term PO. Although the level of Ser-127–phosphorylated YAP/total YAP was decreased 7 days after TAC, the level of phosphorylated Lats2/total Lats2, the predominant YAP kinase, did not change significantly. The small GTPase RhoA is associated with CM hypertrophy and the protective signaling mechanism within the myocardium in vivo (12Brown J.H. Del Re D.P.

To elucidate the underlying mechanism of YAP activation in response to PO, we investigated the involvement of RhoA signaling and mechanical stress. To this end, we applied cyclic stretch to CMs to induce hypertrophy (26Sadoshima J. Jahn L. Takahashi T. Kulik T.J. Izumo S. Molecular characterization of the stretch-induced adaptation of cultured cardiac cells. An in vitro model of load-induced cardiac hypertrophy.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267 (1534087): 10551-10560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CMs were subjected to 1 h of cyclic stretch, and subcellular fractions were prepared from cell lysates. We found that YAP was increased in the nuclear fraction after stretch compared with the control unstretched CMs. Pretreatment of CMs with C3 exoenzyme, a selective inhibitor of RhoA activation, abolished the nuclear accumulation of YAP (Fig. 7A). Importantly, RhoA was activated 1 day and 7 days after TAC, time points at which YAP was up-regulated (Fig. 7B). To determine whether RhoA activation is sufficient to promote YAP nuclear localization, CMs were transduced with adenovirus harboring either constitutively active RhoA (RhoA (Q63L)) or GFP. YAP protein was more abundant in the nucleus of CMs with constitutively active RhoA than in CMs with GFP (Fig. 7, C and D). We also found that sphingosine 1-phosphate, a potent activator of RhoA in CMs, increased nuclear YAP, an effect that was blocked by concomitant C3 treatment (Fig. S4). These data suggest that RhoA activation is sufficient to induce YAP activation and is necessary for stretch- and agonist-induced YAP nuclear localization in CMs. We next investigated the molecular mechanism through which YAP mediates cardiac hypertrophy during the acute phase of PO. Akt signaling has been shown to modulate cardiac hypertrophy, and our previous work demonstrated a link between YAP and Akt in CMs (27Condorelli G. Drusco A. Stassi G. Bellacosa A. Roncarati R.

https://openalex.org/W2910713260,"The increasing use of messaging applications such as WhatsApp for both social and personal purposes has determined an increase in the widespread use of these technologies, even in healthcare. A growing number of healthcare professionals have adopted WhatsApp in their daily work in order to share information with peers and patients. Past research has highlighted the advantages and disadvantages of WhatsApp usage in healthcare settings; in particular two positions appear to coexist in the scientific debate: those that expose and underline all of the positive aspects of the phenomenon, and those which also highlight the negative aspects, linked in particular to the clinical risks for patients, data security and privacy protection. The main objective of this study was to assess if and how individual and organizational determinants can trigger or inhibit the use of WhatsApp in a hospital setting, and which variables managers can exploit to guide professionals' behaviors. Data were collected through a survey administered to physicians and nurses in an Italian University Hospital in Rome; a total of 191 high-quality responses were received. The results show that WhatsApp is widely used in the Hospital, and that its use is mainly due to the perception of numerous advantages and benefits reported in clinical practice. Moreover, an interplay exists between organizational and individual factors in determining the use of WhatsApp between healthcare professionals and with patients. In particular, individual factors play a key role as determinants of the use of WhatsApp; healthcare professionals use this technology mainly based on its perceived usefulness. Instead, organizational factors play a secondary role; they do not have a direct influence on the use of WhatsApp, but always act through individual factors. This study is the first to analyses the influence of individual and organizational determinants of WhatsApp usage in the hospital setting, and provides hospital managers with important information in order to manage this phenomenon and implement adequate strategies to exploit its potential increase."
https://openalex.org/W2911182703,"The neutral amino acid transporter solute carrier family 1 member 5 (SLC1A5 or ASCT2) is overexpressed in many cancers. To identify its roles in tumors, we employed 143B osteosarcoma cells and HCC1806 triple-negative breast cancer cells with or without ASCT2 deletion. ASCT2ko 143B cells grew well in standard culture media, but ASCT2 was required for optimal growth at <0.5 mm glutamine, with tumor spheroid growth and monolayer migration of 143B ASCT2ko cells being strongly impaired at lower glutamine concentrations. However, the ASCT2 deletion did not affect matrix-dependent invasion. ASCT2ko 143B xenografts in nude mice exhibited a slower onset of growth and a higher number of small tumors than ASCT2wt 143B xenografts, but did not differ in average tumor size 25 days after xenotransplantation. ASCT2 deficiency was compensated by increased levels of sodium neutral amino acid transporter 1 (SNAT1 or SLC38A1) and SNAT2 (SLC38A2) in ASCT2ko 143B cells, mediated by a GCN2 EIF2α kinase (GCN2)-dependent pathway, but this compensation was not observed in ASCT2ko HCC1806 cells. Combined SNAT1 silencing and GCN2 inhibition significantly inhibited growth of ASCT2ko HCC1806 cells, but not of ASCT2ko 143B cells. Similarly, pharmacological inhibition of l-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) and GCN2 significantly inhibited growth of ASCT2ko HCC1806 cells, but not of ASCT2ko 143B cells. We conclude that cancer cells with reduced transporter plasticity are more vulnerable to disruption of amino acid homeostasis than cells with a full capacity to up-regulate redundant transporters by an integrated stress response."
https://openalex.org/W2909121401,"The major cellular clearance pathway for organelle and unwanted proteins is the autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP). Lysosomes not only house proteolytic enzymes, but also traffic organelles, sense nutrients, and repair mitochondria. Mitophagy is initiated by damaged mitochondria, which is ultimately degraded by the ALP to compensate for ATP loss. While both systems are dynamic and respond to continuous cellular stressors, most studies are derived from animal models or cell based systems, which do not provide complete real time data about cellular processes involved in the progression of lysosomal storage diseases in patients. Gaucher and Fabry diseases are rare sphingolipid disorders due to the deficiency of the lysosomal enzymes; glucocerebrosidase and α-galactosidase A with resultant lysosomal dysfunction. Little is known about ALP pathology and mitochondrial function in patients with Gaucher and Fabry diseases, and the effects of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Studying blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients, we provide in vivo evidence, that regulation of ALP is defective. In PBMCs derived from Gaucher patients, we report a decreased number of autophagic vacuoles with increased cytoplasmic localization of LC3A/B, accompanied by lysosome accumulation. For both Gaucher and Fabry diseases, the level of the autophagy marker, Beclin1, was elevated and ubiquitin binding protein, SQSTM1/p62, was decreased. mTOR inhibition did not activate autophagy and led to ATP inhibition in PBMCs. Lysosomal abnormalities, independent of the type of the accumulated substrate suppress not only autophagy, but also mitochondrial function and mTOR signaling pathways. ERT partially restored ALP function, LC3-II accumulation and decreased LC3-I/LC3-II ratios. Levels of lysosomal (LAMP1), autophagy (LC3), and mitochondrial markers, (Tfam), normalized after ERT infusion. In conclusion, there is mTOR pathway dysfunction in sphingolipidoses, as observed in both PBMCs derived from patients with Gaucher and Fabry diseases, which leads to impaired autophagy and mitochondrial stress. ERT partially improves ALP function."
https://openalex.org/W2910850766,"The immune microenvironment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is comprised of a heterogeneous population of cells that are critical for disease evolution. Prominent among these are the specialized CD1dhiCD5+ regulatory B (Breg) cells that exert a pro-tumorigenic role by promoting tumor cell proliferation. Dissecting the molecular pathways regulating this immune sub-population can thus be valuable for uncovering potential therapeutic targets. Here, we investigate Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK), a key B-cell kinase, as a potential regulator of CD1dhiCD5+ Breg differentiation in the pancreatic tumor microenvironment. Treatment of cytokine-induced B cells in vitro with the high specificity BTK inhibitor Tirabrutinib inhibited CD1dhiCD5+ Breg differentiation and production of IL-10 and IL-35, essential mediators of Breg immunosuppressive functions. The BTK signaling pathway was also found to be active in vivo in PanIN-associated regulatory B cells. Tirabrutinib treatment of mice bearing orthotopic KrasG12D-pancreatic lesions severely compromised stromal accumulation of the CD1dhiCD5+ Breg population. This was accompanied by an increase in stromal CD8+IFNγ+ cytotoxic T cells and significant attenuation of tumor cell proliferation and PanIN growth. Our results uncover a novel role for BTK in regulating CD1dhiCD5+ Breg differentiation and emphasize its potential as a therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer."

While integrating organic practices into cocoa agroforestry may further enhance these potentials, empirical and robust data to support this claim is lacking, and mechanisms for biodiversity conservation and the provision of environmental and ecological benefits are poorly understood. A field study was conducted in the Eastern Region of Ghana to evaluate the potential of organic cocoa agroforests to conserve native floristic diversity in comparison with conventional cocoa agroforests. Shade tree species richness, Shannon, Simpson's reciprocal and Margalef diversity indices were estimated from 84 organic and conventional cocoa agroforestry plots. Species importance value index, a measure of how dominant a species is in a given ecosystem, and conservation status were used to evaluate the conservation potential of shade trees on studied cocoa farms. Organic farms recorded higher mean shade tree species richness (5.10 ± 0.38) compared to conventional farms (3.48 ± 0.39). Similarly, mean Shannon diversity index, Simpson's reciprocal diversity index and Margalef diversity index were significantly higher on organic farms compared to conventional farms. According to the importance value index, fruit and native shade tree species were the most important on both organic and conventional farms for all the cocoa age groups but more so on organic farms. Organic farms maintained 14 native tree species facing a conservation issue compared to 10 on conventional cocoa farms. The results suggest that diversified organic cocoa farms can serve as reservoirs of native tree species, including those currently facing conservation concerns thereby providing support and contributing to the conservation of tree species in the landscape."

Although recent studies report that autophagy-related gene 7 (ATG7) is overexpressed in BCs, the regulatory effects of ATG7 on cancer stem-like phenotypes and invasion have not been explored yet. Current studies demonstrated that the deficiency of ATG7 by its shRNA dramatically reduced sphere formation and invasion in vitro, as well as lung metastasis in vivo in human invasive BC cells. Further studies indicated that the knockdown of ATG7 attenuated the expression of CD44 standard (CD44s), while ectopic introduction of CD44s, was capable of completely restoring sphere formation, invasion, and lung metastasis in T24T(shATG7) cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that ATG7 overexpression stabilized CD44s proteins accompanied with upregulating USP28 proteins. Upregulated USP28 was able to bind to CD44s and remove the ubiquitin group from CD44s’ protein, resulting in the stabilization of CD44s protein. Moreover, ATG7 inhibition stabilized AUF1 protein and thereby reduced tet1 mRNA stability and expression, which was able to demethylate usp28 promoter, reduced USP28 expression, finally promoting CD44s degradation. In addition, CD44s was defined to inhibit degradation of RhoGDIβ, which in turn promotes BC invasion. Our results demonstrate that CD44s is a key ATG7 downstream regulator of the sphere formation, invasion, and lung metastasis of BCs, providing significant insight into understanding the BC invasions, metastasis, and stem-like properties."

https://openalex.org/W2909656211,"Enterococcus faecalis is a major opportunistic pathogen that readily forms protective biofilms leading to chronic infections. Biofilms protect bacteria from detergent solutions, antimicrobial agents, environmental stress, and effectively make bacteria 10 to 1000-fold more resistant to antibiotic treatment. Extracellular proteins and polysaccharides are primary components of biofilms and play a key role in cell survival, microbial persistence, cellular interaction, and maturation of E. faecalis biofilms. Degradation of biofilm components by mammalian proteases is an effective antibiofilm strategy because proteases are known to degrade bacterial proteins leading to bacterial cell lysis and growth inhibition. Here, we show that human matrix metalloprotease-1 inhibits and disrupts E. faecalis biofilms. MMPs are cell-secreted zinc- and calcium-dependent proteases that degrade and regulate various structural components of the extracellular matrix. Human MMP1 is known to degrade type-1 collagen and can also cleave a wide range of substrates. We found that recombinant human MMP1 significantly inhibited and disrupted biofilms of vancomycin sensitive and vancomycin resistant E. faecalis strains. The mechanism of antibiofilm activity is speculated to be linked with bacterial growth inhibition and degradation of biofilm matrix proteins by MMP1. These findings suggest that human MMP1 can potentially be used as a potent antibiofilm agent against E. faecalis biofilms."
https://openalex.org/W2909198394,"With increasing affluence in many developing countries, the demand for livestock products is rising and the increasing feed requirement contributes to pressure on land resources for food and energy production. However, there is currently a knowledge gap in our ability to assess the extent and intensity of the utilization of land by livestock, which is the single largest land use in the world. We developed a spatial model that combines fine-scale livestock numbers with their associated energy requirements to distribute livestock grazing demand onto a map of energy supply, with the aim of estimating where and to what degree pasture is being utilized. We applied our model to Kazakhstan, which contains large grassland areas that historically have been used for extensive livestock production but for which the current extent, and thus the potential for increasing livestock production, is unknown. We measured the grazing demand of Kazakh livestock in 2015 at 286 Petajoules, which was 25% of the estimated maximum sustainable energy supply that is available to livestock for grazing. The model resulted in a grazed area of 1.22 million km2, or 48% of the area theoretically available for grazing in Kazakhstan, with most utilized land grazed at low intensities (average off-take rate was 13% of total biomass energy production). Under a conservative scenario, our estimations showed a production potential of 0.13 million tons of beef additional to 2015 production (31% increase), and much more with utilization of distant pastures. This model is an important step forward in evaluating pasture use and available land resources, and can be adapted at any spatial scale for any region in the world."
https://openalex.org/W2909399127,"Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a major cereal disease caused by a complex of Fusarium species. These species vary in importance depending on climatic conditions, agronomic factors or host genotype. In addition, Fusarium species can release toxic secondary metabolites. These mycotoxins constitute a significant food safety concern as they have health implications in both humans and animals. The Fusarium species involved in FHB differ in their pathogenicity, ability to produce mycotoxins, and fungicide sensitivity. Accurate and exhaustive identification of Fusarium species in planta is therefore of great importance. In this study, using a new set of primers targeting the EF1α gene, the diversity of Fusarium species on cereals was evaluated using Illumina high-throughput sequencing. The PCR amplification parameters and bioinformatic pipeline were optimized with mock and artificially infected grain communities and further tested on 65 field samples. Fusarium species were retrieved from mock communities and good reproducibility between different runs or PCR cycle numbers was be observed. The method enabled the detection of as few as one single Fusarium-infected grain in 10,000. Up to 17 different Fusarium species were detected in field samples of barley, durum and soft wheat harvested in France. This new set of primers enables the assessment of Fusarium diversity by high-throughput sequencing on cereal samples. It provides a more exhaustive picture of the Fusarium community than the currently used techniques based on isolation or species-specific PCR detection. This new experimental approach may be used to show changes in the composition of the Fusarium complex or to detect the emergence of new Fusarium species as far as the EF1α sequence of these species show a sufficient amount of polymorphism in the portion of sequence analyzed. Information on the distribution and prevalence of the different Fusarium species in a given geographical area, and in response to various environmental factors, is of great interest for managing the disease and predicting mycotoxin contamination risks."

Methods Data were extracted from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (2005–2017). Group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify the patterns of opioid use (any or strong) among participants age 65+. We used multivariable logistic regression with backward selection to evaluate demographics and comorbidities as potential predictors of trajectory membership. Results Among 13,059 participants, four trajectories were identified for the use of both any opioids and strong opioids (minimal-users, incident chronic-users, discontinuing-users, and prevalent chronic-users). For any opioids, female sex (adjusted odds ratio = 1.23; 95% confidence interval = 1.03–1.46), black vs. white (1.47; 1.18–1.82), year of education (0.96; 0.94–0.99), type of residence (independent group vs. private: 1.77; 1.38–2.26, care facility vs. private: 1.89; 1.20–2.97), hypertension (1.44; 1.20–1.72), cardiovascular disease (1.30; 1.09–1.55), urinary incontinence (1.45; 1.19–1.78), dementia (0.73; 0.57–0.92), number of medications (1 to 4 vs. none: 0.48; 0.36–0.64, 5 or more vs. none: 0.67; 0.50–0.88), and antidepressant agent (1.38; 1.14–1.67) were associated with incident chronic-use vs. non-use. For strong opioids, female sex (1.27; 1.04–1.56), type of residence (independent group vs. private: 1.90; 1.43–2.53, care facility vs. private: 2.37; 1.44–3.90), current smoking (1.68; 1.09–2.60), hypertension (1.49; 1.21–1.83), urinary incontinence (1.45; 1.14–1.84), dementia (0.73; 0.55–0.97), number of medications (1 to 4 vs. none: 0.46; 0.32–0.65, 5 or more vs. none: 0.59; 0.42–0.83), and antidepressant agent (1.55; 1.24–1.93) were associated with incident chronic-use vs. non-use. Conclusion Given that chronic opioid use was more prevalent in participants who were more vulnerable (i.e., older age, with multiple comorbidities, and polypharmacy), further studies should evaluate the safety and efficacy of using opioids in this population."

We found that both species richness and diversity tend to be higher in the peel, where Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria dominate, while Gammaproteobacteria and Firmicutes dominate in the pulp. A statistical analysis revealed that the main characteristic features of the microbiomes of plant species originate from the peel microbiomes. Topinambur pulp displayed an interesting characteristic feature: it contained up to 108 CFUs of lactic acid bacteria, suggesting its use as a source of probiotic bacteria. We also detected Listeria sp., in topinambur pulps, however, the 16S rRNA gene fragment is unable to distinguish between pathogenic versus non-pathogenic species, so the evaluation of this potential health risk is left to a future study."

In kidney cell (HEK293-T) culture, the GAP activity toward RAG (GATOR1) protein complex suppresses activation of the RAG A/B–RAG C/D heterodimer when amino acids are insufficient. During amino acid sufficiency, the RAG heterodimer recruits mTORC1 to the lysosomal membrane where its interaction with Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) stimulates mTORC1's kinase activity. The DEP domain containing 5 (DEPDC5) protein, a GATOR1 subunit, causes familial focal epilepsy when mutated, and global knockout of the Depdc5 gene is embryonically lethal. To study the function of DEPDC5 in skeletal muscle, we generated a muscle-specific inducible Depdc5 knockout mouse, hypothesizing that knocking out Depdc5 in muscle would make mTORC1 constitutively active, causing hypertrophy and improving muscle function. Examining mTORC1 signaling, morphology, mitochondrial respiratory capacity, contractile function, and applied physical function (e.g. rotarod, treadmill, grip test, and wheel running), we observed that mTORC1 activity was significantly higher in knockout (KO) mice, indicated by the increased phosphorylation of mTOR and its downstream effectors (by 118% for p-mTOR/mTOR, 114% for p-S6K1/S6K1, and 35% for p-4E-BP1/4E-BP1). The KO animals also exhibited soleus muscle cell hypertrophy and a 2.5-fold increase in mitochondrial respiratory capacity. However, contrary to our hypothesis, neither physical nor contractile function improved. In conclusion, DEPDC5 depletion in adult skeletal muscle removes GATOR1 inhibition of mTORC1, resulting in muscle hypertrophy and increased mitochondrial respiration, but does not improve overall muscle quality and function. mTORC1 regulates protein synthesis and in turn is regulated by growth factors, energy status, and amino acid availability.

In conclusion, DEPDC5 depletion in adult skeletal muscle removes GATOR1 inhibition of mTORC1, resulting in muscle hypertrophy and increased mitochondrial respiration, but does not improve overall muscle quality and function. mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) 2The abbreviations used are: mTORC1mTOR complex 1KOknockoutTAtibialis anteriorCSAcross-sectional areaSOLsoleusEDLextensor digitorum longusSDHsuccinate dehydrogenaseGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenasePCSAphysiological cross-sectional areaDTNB5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). is a master regulator of protein synthesis that receives inputs from a variety of sources (e.g. energy balance, oxygen concentration, growth factors, contraction/exercise, and amino acid availability). When conditions are favorable, activated mTORC1 phosphorylates downstream targets, such as TFEB (transcription factor EB) and ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1), that restrict autophagy, as well as S6K1 (ribosomal protein 6 kinase 1) and 4E-BP1 (eukaryote translation initiation factor 4E–binding protein 1), which promote mRNA translation by the ribosome.

GATOR1 (GAP activity toward RAG 1) is a protein complex consisting of three subunits: NPRL2 (nitrogen permease regulator-like 2), NPRL3 (nitrogen permease regulator-like 3), and DEPDC5 (DEP domain containing 5). GATOR1 is a negative regulator of the RAG heterodimer, preventing translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosome during amino acid insufficiency by acting as a GTPase-activating protein to keep RAG A/B in the inactive GDP state (6Bar-Peled L.

Neuron-specific knockout of Depdc5 results in an epileptic phenotype similar to the human presentation of DEPDC5 protein mutation familial epilepsy (14Yuskaitis C.J. Jones B.M. Wolfson R.L.

In skeletal muscle cells, amino acid–sensing pathways control protein synthesis and hypertrophy through mTORC1. DEPDC5, as a component of the GATOR1 complex, is a negative regulator of mTORC1. Given that global or embryonic knockout of DEPDC5 protein is embryonically lethal, we bred an inducible skeletal muscle-specific knockout to study DEPDC5 function in muscle. To accomplish this, we used cre-loxP technology in a transgenic mouse that expresses tamoxifen-inducible cre only in limb skeletal muscle: the Tg(ACTA1-cre/Esr1*)2Kesr (CRE) mouse available commercially from the Jackson Laboratory (stock no. 025750) and crossed the CRE line (either heterozygous CRE+/−, or homozygous CRE+/+) with a transgenic mouse with the mutant homozygous allele Depdc5tm1c(EUCOMM)Hmgu (Depdc5fl/fl for the homozygous allele) (see “Genotyping” under “Method details” for further explanation). We hypothesized that Depdc5 knockout in skeletal muscle would result in a constitutively active mTORC1, promote muscle cell growth (hypertrophy), and result in increased functional performance. To test this hypothesis, we compared non–tamoxifen-treated mice (control or WT) to tamoxifen-treated mice (experimental, denoted as KO for knockout) and used immunohistochemistry to measure muscle cell cross-sectional area by fiber type, immunoblotting to determine mTORC1 pathway activation, and performed functional analysis using in vitro contractile physiology (muscle force production), rotarod (overall motor function), grip test (forelimb strength), treadmill (endurance), and voluntary wheel running (activity). In addition, because mitochondrial activity has been shown to be regulated by 4E-BP1, a downstream effector of mTORC1 (15Morita M. Gravel S.-P. Chénard V. Sikström K. Zheng L. Alain T. Gandin V. Avizonis D. Arguello M. Zakaria C. McLaughlan S. Nouet Y. Pause A. Pollak M. Gottlieb E. et al.mTORC1 controls mitochondrial activity and biogenesis through 4E-BP-dependent translational regulation.Cell Metab. 2013; 18 (24206664): 698-71110.1016/j.cmet.2013.10.001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), we determined mitochondrial respiratory capacity with high-resolution respirometry (Orobouros Instruments Oxygraph-2k), citric acid cycle activity with a citrate synthase enzymatic activity assay, and relative levels of the COX4 protein using Western blotting and performed an enzymatic activity immunohistochemical stain for succinate dehydrogenase. The transgene PCR product (∼749 bp) is expressed only in tamoxifen-treated KO skeletal muscle (tibialis anterior, TA) and not in off-target tissues such as the heart and skin or in nontransgenic or tamoxifen negative mice. DEPDC5 mRNA expression was also reduced in KO when compared with WT. Indeed, most KO samples did not result in PCR replication of DEPDC5 within the maximum 40 cycles. Gel electrophoresis of the PCR amplicons demonstrated little to no expression of DEPDC5 mRNA in skeletal muscle. DEPDC5 protein expression was reduced in a Western blotting comparison of WT versus KO in skeletal muscle (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1). All mice were fed ad libitum. In KO, when compared with WT, phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser-2448) increased by 118% (p < 0.001), phosphorylation of S6K1 at Thr-389 increased by 114% (p = 0.008), and the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 Thr-37/46) increased by 35% (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2). Male KO demonstrated significant muscle fiber hypertrophy (increased cross-sectional area (CSA)) versus WT males in Soleus (SOL) type 1 (+13%, p = 0.034), 2a (+17%, p = 0.048), and 2x (+21%, p = 0.010) fiber types. In the TA, type 2a muscle fibers demonstrated a tendency for hypertrophy (+17%, p = 0.089) in males, with no increase in 2x or 2b cells (data not shown). Female KO animals did not have significant changes in muscle fiber CSA (Fig. 3 and Table S1). In the TA of male KO, there was evidence of reduced numbers of the more oxidative and slower twitch type 1 fibers −79%, p = 0.051; and type 2a fibers −65.8%, p = 0.064, with a concomitant, albeit nonsignificant, shift to a more glycolytic and faster fiber type (type 2B fibers +31%, p = 0.279). There was no significant evidence of a shift in fiber type in SOL. In contrast, the female mice demonstrated no significant change in fiber type isoforms (Table S1). Other than the grip test in male KO, which was reduced by 15%, none of the functional tests (e.g. rotarod, treadmill, voluntary wheel running) demonstrated significant change in KO (from pre- to 6-weeks post-tamoxifen treatment as compared with WT), when the mass of the mice was accounted for in both pre- and post-testing (Fig. 4, Table S2, and Figs. S2–S5). Body mass did not significantly change in males. However, female WT mice did gain 6.3% (p = 0.037), over the experimental period, but female KO mice did not change (Table S2). Muscle wet mass was not significantly different between KO and WT for SOL, plantaris, extensor digitorum longus (EDL), or gastrocnemius muscles (p > 0.05) in either males or females. The TA muscle mass demonstrated no change in males, but was significantly lower in KO females (Table S2). Muscle contractile function (i.e. maximal tetanic force in EDL and SOL) was also not changed significantly in KO (see Table S2 for further details of the contractile physiology data). Female KO mice also had no improved function. Respiration coupled to ATP production (state 3 respiration) was significantly greater in KO versus WT (46 ± 6 versus 116 ± 4 pmol/s/mg; p < 0.001). Similarly, maximal uncoupled respiration was significantly greater in KO (67 ± 11 versus 160 ± 0 pmol/s/mg; p < 0.001; Fig. 5), indicating greater respiratory capacity per mg of muscle tissue in KO. Despite this 2.5-fold difference in mitochondrial respiratory capacity, respiratory control in response to ADP did not differ between the two groups, suggesting that mitochondrial quality was similar between KO and WT (Fig. S6). Similarly, the substrate control for succinate and the flux control ratio, calculated by normalizing the leak and coupled respiration to the maximal uncoupled respiration, were all similar between WT and KO (Fig. S6). Collectively, these data suggest that the significant differences in TA mitochondrial respiratory capacity between WT and KO are not the result of alterations in mitochondrial coupling control or quality. This means that KO may have greater mitochondrial protein abundance. This is supported by data in the SOL that demonstrated, at least in male KO mice, COX4 protein was increased ∼20% (although females actually had a similar magnitude of decline) (Fig. 6).Figure 6COX4. A, SOL COX4/GAPDH ratio is 19. 0% higher in male KO (open triangles, n = 5, p = 0.047) than in WT (combined sexes, n = 4 M and 4 F) and the ratio is 19.3% lower in female KO (filled triangles, n = 3, p = 0.021). Male KO ratio is 47.5% higher than the female KO (p = 0.004). Different letters indicate significant difference between groups. WT M and WT F were not different; thus, the groups were combined.

In addition, when we stained for succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity in the SOL, we uncovered a positive correlation between higher SDH activity and muscle size (Fig. S7), with SDH+ fiber frequency 13% greater in male KO mice than WT on average. We set out to determine the impact of Depdc5 knockout on skeletal muscle metabolism and function. As expected, the muscle-specific knockout of DEPDC5 in adult mice induced mTORC1 to become constitutively active in muscle tissue as demonstrated by increased phosphorylation of mTOR and its downstream effectors in KO animals as compared with WT. Male, but not female mice, had an increase in muscle cell size (i.e. hypertrophy) with the loss of the DEPDC5 protein. Six weeks following tamoxifen treatment, there was no change in maximal isometric force (i.e. in vitro EDL and SOL contractile physiology), activity (wheel running), overall motor ability (rotarod), or endurance (treadmill). However, evidence for a reduction in forelimb strength (grip test) in KO animals was observed. The knockout of DEPDC5 in adult muscle resulted in hyperactive mTORC1 signaling in fed mice, underscoring a critical role for muscle DEPDC5 in mTORC1 activation in vivo. These data are in line with those reported in the brain of animals with global knockout (12Hughes J. Dawson R. Tea M. McAninch D. Piltz S. Jackson D. Stewart L. Ricos M.G. Dibbens L.M. Harvey N.L.

Similarly, knockout of NPRL2 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts resulted in the inability of starvation to repress mTORC1 signaling (10Dutchak P.A. Laxman S. Estill S.J. Wang C. Wang Y. Wang Y. Bulut G.B. Gao J. Huang L.J. Tu B.P. Regulation of hematopoiesis and methionine homeostasis by mTORC1 inhibitor NPRL2.Cell Reports. 2015; 12 (26166573): 371-37910.1016/j.celrep.2015.06.042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), whereas knocking out NPRL3 resulted in changes in mRNA expression consistent with down-regulation of mTORC1 signaling (11Kowalczyk M.S. Hughes J.R. Babbs C. Sanchez-Pulido L. Szumska D. Sharpe J.A. Sloane-Stanley J.A. Morriss-Kay G.M. Smoot L.B. Roberts A.E. Watkins H. Bhattacharya S. Gibbons R.J. Ponting C.P. Wood W.G. et al.Nprl3 is required for normal development of the cardiovascular system.Mamm. Genome. 2012; 23 (22538705): 404-41510.1007/s00335-012-9398-yCrossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). When NPRL2 was knocked out in muscle, mTORC1 was activated despite fasted conditions (16Dutchak P.A. Estill-Terpack S.J. Plec A.A. Zhao X. Yang C. Chen J. Ko B. Deberardinis R.J. Yu Y. Tu B.P. Loss of a negative regulator of mTORC1 induces aerobic glycolysis and altered fiber composition in skeletal muscle.Cell Rep. 2018; 23 (29768191): 1907-191410.1016/j.celrep.2018.04.058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Whether muscle DEPDC5 knockout is sufficient to preserve mTORC1 signaling in a fasted state, in vivo, remains an unanswered question that warrants further study. In the current study, we found evidence of cellular hypertrophy following the loss of DEPDC5 in skeletal muscle. However, this hypertrophy was not consistent across all muscles, fiber types, or sexes. We suspect that the male mice may have exhibited greater hypertrophy because of a higher level of aggressive activity (i.e. wrestling/fighting), whereas the females were observed to be more sedentary/relaxed than the males in our study. Indeed, male mice can be aggressive (17Weber E.M. Dallaire J.A. Gaskill B.N. Pritchett-Corning K.R. Garner J.P. Aggression in group-housed laboratory mice: why can't we solve the problem?.Lab Anim. (NY). 2017; 46 (28328884): 157-16110.1038/laban.1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and have bouts of fighting when group housed, which may provide an anabolic stimulus (18Kappel S. Hawkins P. Mendl M.T. To group or not to group?: good practice for housing male laboratory mice.Animals (Basel). 2017; 7 (29186765): E8810.3390/ani7120088Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In contrast, aggression is not a behavior associated with female mice. Researchers sometimes choose to use only female mice to avoid dealing with aggressive behaviors (19Van Loo P.L. Van de Weerd H.A. Van Zutphen L.F. Baumans V. Preference for social contact versus environmental enrichment in male laboratory mice.Lab. Anim. 2004; 38 (15070458): 178-18810.1258/002367704322968867Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Additionally, the male physiology may have been permissive of hypertrophy in the absence of a dedicated exercise stimulus, because young male mice would have increased levels of testosterone when compared with young female mice (20Haizlip K.M. Harrison B.C. Leinwand L.A. Sex-based differences in skeletal muscle kinetics and fiber-type composition.Physiology. 2015; 30 (25559153): 30-3910.1152/physiol.00024.2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, there was no percentage increase in overall body mass in the KO compared with WT over the same period, nor were significant increases in muscle wet mass observed. Future work examining whether traditional hypertrophy models (e.g. synergist ablation), exercise training, or disuse models (e.g. hindlimb suspension or casting) in inducible Depdc5 muscle-specific KO animals will be useful in understanding the interaction of physical activity and mTORC1 activation in regulating muscle size and function. Other knockout models of mTORC1 pathway genes have demonstrated effect variability. Knocking out RAPTOR in muscle results in repressed mTORC1 signaling and TSC1 knockout in muscle results in up-regulated mTORC1 signaling (21Guridi M. Kupr B. Romanino K. Lin S. Falcetta D. Tintignac L. Rüegg M.A. Alterations to mTORC1 signaling in the skeletal muscle differentially affect whole-body metabolism.Skeletal Muscle. 2016; 6 (27004103): 1310.1186/s13395-016-0084-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Both knockouts result in younger mice being both resistant to high-fat diets and leaner than WT mice, but there were differing metabolic implications for each knockout, with severe myopathy developing in both models at older ages. Both young male and female TSC1 knockouts were lighter than age-matched WT, mainly because of decreased fat mass, but the RAPTOR knockouts were only lighter in males, primarily because of lower lean mass. Compared with nontransfected cells, knockdown of TSC1 via electroporation of shRNA was sufficient to promote hypertrophy in the short term, in both normally innervated and denervated muscle, but resulted in atrophy long term in all but soleus muscles (22Bentzinger C.F. Lin S. Romanino K. Castets P. Guridi M. Summermatter S. Handschin C. Tintignac L.A. Hall M.N. Rüegg M.A. Differential response of skeletal muscles to mTORC1 signaling during atrophy and hypertrophy.Skeletal Muscle. 2013; 3 (23497627): 610.1186/2044-5040-3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Because our KO animals did not change in overall mass compared with WT, we hypothesize that they may have gained lean mass and lost fat mass in equal proportions. Even though there was evidence of muscle hypertrophy, at least in the male KO, in contrast to our hypothesis, muscle-specific loss of DEPDC5 did not improve function overall, and grip strength was reduced. This result went contrary to our original hypothesis, where we predicted that in the short term that function would be increased. Interestingly, although we show increased mitochondrial respiratory capacity in the KO, this did not translate into increased endurance, perhaps because only skeletal muscle and not cardiac muscle is affected by the knockout. The loss of grip strength detected in the KO could be interpreted as a beginning of muscle myopathy at 6 weeks following the depletion of DEPDC5. Whether further myopathy follows with a more prolonged loss of DEPDC5 in muscle is an interesting avenue for future studies to explore. Hypertrophic muscle does not always accompany improvements in contractile or physical performance. There are numerous examples from different systems. Hypertrophy in a muscle cell can involve expansion of the sarcoplasm and/or myofibrillar expansion. Without the addition of force producing machinery in parallel (i.e. actin/myosin chains, myofibrils), force output cannot increase. However, the addition of myofibrils can also increase the pennation angle of muscle fibers, thus lowering force output per unit of muscle (23Maughan R.J. Relationship between muscle strength and muscle cross-sectional area: implications for training.Sports Med. 1984; 1 (6568749): 263-26910.2165/00007256-198401040-00002Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Weight training can result in hypertrophy without isometric strength gain (24Sale D.G. Martin J.E. Moroz D.E. Hypertrophy without increased isometric strength after weight training.Eur. J. Appl. Physiol. Occup. Physiol. 1992; 64 (1735412): 51-5510.1007/BF00376440Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Myofibrils can be added to lengthen the muscle, which might contribute to muscle mass and velocity of contraction (and thus increased power output) but would not improve force production, per se. In addition, increased capillarization, fibrosis and lipid deposition could increase muscle size and mass without increasing force output (25Alnaqeeb M.A. Al Zaid N.S. Goldspink G. Connective tissue changes and physical properties of developing and ageing skeletal muscle.J. Anat. 1984; 139 (6526719): 677-689PubMed Google Scholar). For example, in myostatin null mice force output is not increased in ratio to an increase in muscle size (26Matsakas A. Macharia R. Otto A. Elashry M.I. Mouisel E. Romanello V. Sartori R. Amthor H. Sandri M. Narkar V. Patel K. Exercise training attenuates the hypermuscular phenotype and restores skeletal muscle function in the myostatin null mouse.Exp. Physiol. 2012; 97 (22058168): 125-14010.1113/expphysiol.2011.063008Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 27Amthor H. Macharia R. Navarrete R. Schuelke M. Brown S.C. Otto A. Voit T. Muntoni F. Vrbóva G. Partridge T. Zammit P. Bunger L. Patel K. Lack of myostatin results in excessive muscle growth but impaired force generation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104 (17267614): 1835-184010.1073/pnas.0604893104Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Another example would be the super-sized muscle cells observed in Duchene muscular dystrophy models that are actually weaker than their overall muscle size would indicate potentially because of pseudohypertrophy (i.e. hypertrophy of cellular components in muscles unrelated to force production), fibrotic intrusion, and cellular disruption (28Chen C.N. Chen C.J. Graber T.G. Bratten W.M. Ferrington D.A. Thompson L.V. Immunoproteasome in animal models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2014; 35 (24934129): 191-20110.1007/s10974-014-9385-xCrossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Another potential side effect of increased mTORC1 signaling is a reduction in autophagy, because mTORC1 is a negative regulator of autophagy through the phosphorylation of ULK-1 (Unc-51 like kinase-1) and TFEB (transcription factor EB) (29Wong P.M. Puente C. Ganley I.G. Jiang X. The ULK1 complex: sensing nutrient signals for autophagy activation.Autophagy. 2013; 9 (23295650): 124-13710.4161/auto.23323Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). A reduction in autophagy might result in an accumulation of cellular debris, potentially resulting in a reduction of muscle quality. This muscle loss in quality could contribute to a lack of functional benefit from hypertrophy, although we did not find evidence of reduced specific force in the EDL or SOL. Reduced mitophagy could potentially increase reactive oxygen species production, resulting in protein or DNA damage also leading to loss of muscle quality and potential nuclear accretion or apoptosis (30Ábrigo J. Elorza A.A. Riedel C.A. Vilos C. Simon F. Cabrera D. Estrada L. Cabello-Verrugio C. Role of oxidative stress as key regulator of muscle wasting during cachexia.Oxid. Med. Cell. Longev. 2018; 2018 (29785242)2063179Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Because muscle wet mass and the fiber CSA data in the soleus were not consistent, we compared the fiber type shift to the CSA data and noticed that, although not significant one could speculate that because the muscles tend to switch fiber type from smaller, slower twitch, more oxidative fibers to larger, faster, more glycolytic fibers, the overall volume of the fiber could be maintained in the face of concomitant apoptosis, which would lead to fewer total cells in the muscle. Thus, we hypothesize that, in the context of chronic mTORC1 activation, inhibition of autophagy accompanied by hyperactive mitochondria releasing damaging reactive oxygen species creates an environment with limited ability for the cell to clear damaged organelles and protein complexes, including dysfunctional mitochondria. This condition likely further exacerbates oxidative stress and increases apoptosis, reducing the overall number of cells. Conversely, increased proteasome activity might also occur as the muscle fights to maintain homeostasis in response to chronic mTORC1 activation and mitochondrial hyperactivity. Future studies examining the long-term effects of DEPDC5 depletion in muscle are needed to address this hypothesis. Based on our findings of increased mitochondrial respiratory capacity (in both male and females), increased citrate synthase activity (in both male and females), and greater relative abundance of COX4 (in male mice), and a trend for increased succinate dehydrogenate activity, coupled with increased mTORC1 signaling, we suspect that the DEPDC5 mice may be hypermetabolic. This result has been observed in other models of altered mTORC1 signaling. Knockdown of TSC1 with shRNA (22Bentzinger C.F. Lin S. Romanino K. Castets P. Guridi M. Summermatter S. Handschin C. Tintignac L.A. Hall M.N. Rüegg M.A. Differential response of skeletal muscles to mTORC1 signaling during atrophy and hypertrophy.Skeletal Muscle. 2013; 3 (23497627): 610.1186/2044-5040-3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was sufficient to increase oxidative capacity of muscle and increase whole-body oxygen consumption as measured via indirect calorimetry. mTORC1 has been shown to regulate mitochondrial biogenesis and activity via 4E-BP1 (15Morita M. Gravel S.-P. Chénard V. Sikström K. Zheng L. Alain T. Gandin V. Avizonis D. Arguello M. Zakaria C. McLaughlan S. Nouet Y. Pause A. Pollak M. Gottlieb E. et al.mTORC1 controls mitochondrial activity and biogenesis through 4E-BP-dependent translational regulation.Cell Metab. 2013; 18 (24206664): 698-71110.1016/j.cmet.2013.10.001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Increased mTORC1 signaling may increase protein synthesis, which is thought to contribute ∼25% of the resting metabolic rate in mammals (31Rolfe D.F. Brown G.C. Cellular energy utilization and molecular origin of standard metabolic rate in mammals.Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77 (9234964): 731-75810.1152/physrev.1997.77.3.731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar). Mice may compensate for increased caloric need simply by eating more food. Thus, increased metabolic rate to fuel this protein production may not have been noticeable in the short term, in the context of body mass. The muscle-specific knockout of the GATOR1 protein subunit NPRL2 results induces aerobic glycolysis and stimulates TCA cycle anaplerotic pathways, presumably to produce biosynthetic intermediates induced by chronic activation of mTORC1 (16Dutchak P.A. Estill-Terpack S.J. Plec A.A. Zhao X. Yang C. Chen J. Ko B. Deberardinis R.J. Yu Y. Tu B.P. Loss of a negative regulator of mTORC1 induces aerobic glycolysis and altered fiber composition in skeletal muscle.Cell Rep. 2018; 23 (29768191): 1907-191410.1016/j.celrep.2018.04.058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Our findings are supportive of that conclusion, but we also provide evidence for increased electron transport chain activity, signaling a distinct role for DEPDC5 in muscle metabolic regulation. In the long term, we suspect that chronic mTORC1 activation and accompanying hypermetabolism may result in muscle and adipose tissue cachexia. Skeletal muscle-specific induced knockout of DEPDC5 in adult mice increased mTORC1 signaling, promoted hypertrophy, and increased mitochondrial respiratory capacity. However, these adaptations did not improve muscle function. The next step will be to determine whether long-term DEPDC5 depletion in skeletal muscle inhibits autophagy and induces myopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2908676840,"Shark depredation is an issue of concern in some Western Australian recreational and commercial fisheries where it can have economic, social and ecological consequences. Knowledge of the shark species involved is fundamental to developing effective management strategies to mitigate the impacts of depredation. Identification of the species responsible is difficult as direct observation of depredation events is uncommon and evaluating bite marks on fish has a high degree of uncertainty. The use of trace DNA techniques has provided an alternative method for species identification. We demonstrate proof of concept for a targeted DNA barcoding approach to identify shark species using trace DNA found at bite marks on recovered remains of hooked fish. Following laboratory validation, forensic analysis of swabs collected from samples of bitten demersal fish, led to the definitive identification of shark species involved in 100% of the incidences of depredation (n = 16)."
https://openalex.org/W2909043953,"Background Bangladesh is currently faced with an emerging scenario of increased number of female physicians in the health workforce which has health system implications. For a health system to attract and retain female physicians, information is needed regarding their motivation to choose medical profession, real-life challenges encountered in home and workplaces, propensity to choose a few particular specialties, and factors leading to drop-out from the system. This exploratory mixed-methods study attempted to fill-in this knowledge gap and help the policy makers in designing a gender-sensitive health system. Methods Three-hundred and fifteen final year female medical students from four purposively selected medical colleges of Dhaka city (two each from public and private colleges) were included in a quantitative survey using self-administered questionnaire. Besides, 31 in-depth interviews with female students, their parents, and in-service trainee physicians, and two focus group discussions with female students were conducted. Gender disaggregated data of physicians and admitted students were also collected. Data were analysed using Stata version 13 and thematic analysis method, as appropriate. Results During 2006–2015, the female physicians outnumbered their male peers (52% vs. 48%), which is also supported by student admission data during 2011–2016 from the sampled medical colleges, (67% in private compared to 52% in public). Majority of the female medical graduates specialized in Obstetrics and Gynaecology (96%). Social status (66%), respect for medical profession (91%), image of a ‘noble profession’ (91%), and prospects of helping common people (94%) were common motivating factors for them. Gender disparity in work, career and work environment especially in rural areas, and problems of work-home balance, were a few of the challenges mentioned which forced some of them to drop-out. Also, this scenario conditioned them to crowd into a few selected specialties, thereby constraining health system from delivering needed services. Conclusions Increasing number of female physicians in health workforce, outnumbering their male peers, is a fact of life for health system of Bangladesh. It’s high time that policy makers pay attention to this and take appropriate remedial measures so that women can pursue their career in an enabling environment and serve the needs and priorities of the health system."
https://openalex.org/W2910660583,"We build models to estimate well-being in the United States based on changes in the volume of internet searches for different words, obtained from the Google Trends website. The estimated well-being series are weighted combinations of word groups that are endogenously identified to fit the weekly subjective well-being measures collected by Gallup Analytics for the United States or the biannual measures for the 50 states. Our approach combines theoretical underpinnings and statistical analysis, and the model we construct successfully estimates the out-of-sample evolution of most subjective well-being measures at a one-year horizon. Our analysis suggests that internet search data can be a complement to traditional survey data to measure and analyze the well-being of a population at high frequency and local geographic levels. We highlight some factors that are important for well-being, as we find that internet searches associated with job search, civic participation, and healthy habits consistently predict well-being across several models, datasets and use cases during the period studied."
https://openalex.org/W2910734003,"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication uses a simple core machinery similar to those of bacterial viruses and plasmids, but its components are challenging to unravel. Here, we found that, as in mammals, the single Drosophila gene for RNase H1 (rnh1) has alternative translational start sites, resulting in two polypeptides, targeted to either mitochondria or the nucleus. RNAi-mediated rnh1 knockdown did not influence growth or viability of S2 cells, but compromised mtDNA integrity and copy number. rnh1 knockdown in intact flies also produced a phenotype of impaired mitochondrial function, characterized by respiratory chain deficiency, locomotor dysfunction, and decreased lifespan. Its overexpression in S2 cells resulted in cell lethality after 5–9 days, attributable to the nuclearly localized isoform. rnh1 knockdown and overexpression produced opposite effects on mtDNA replication intermediates. The most pronounced effects were seen in genome regions beyond the major replication pauses where the replication fork needs to progress through a gene cluster that is transcribed in the opposite direction. RNase H1 deficiency led to an accumulation of replication intermediates in these zones, abundant mtDNA molecules joined by four-way junctions, and species consistent with fork regression from the origin. These findings indicate replication stalling due to the presence of unprocessed RNA/DNA heteroduplexes, potentially leading to the degradation of collapsed forks or to replication restart by a mechanism involving strand invasion. Both mitochondrial RNA and DNA syntheses were affected by rnh1 knockdown, suggesting that RNase H1 also plays a role in integrating or coregulating these processes in Drosophila mitochondria."

We explored the species diversification and biogeographical history of the Nemouridae Billberg, 1820 family in the Japanese Archipelago using mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA markers. We collected 49 species among four genera: Indonemoura Baumann, 1975; Protonemura Kempny, 1898; Amphinemura, Ris 1902 and Nemoura Latreille, 1796 in Japan, China, South Korea and North America. We estimated their divergence times—based on three molecular clock node calibrations—using Bayesian phylogeography approaches. Our results suggested that Japanese Archipelago formation events resulted in diversification events in the middle of the Cretaceous (<120 Ma), speciation in the Paleogene (<50 Ma) and intra-species diversification segregated into eastern and western Japan of the Fossa Magna region at late Neogene (20 Ma). The Indonemoura samples were genetically separated into two clades—that of Mainland China and that of Japan. The Japanese clade clustered with the Nemouridae species from North America, suggesting the possibility of a colonisation event prior to the formation of the Japanese Archipelago. We believe that our results enhanced the understanding both of the origin of the species and of local species distribution in the Japanese Archipelago."
https://openalex.org/W2909818902,"Robotic stabilization of a therapeutic radiation beam with respect to a dynamically moving tumor target can be accomplished either by moving the radiation source, the patient, or both. As the treatment beam is on during this process, the primary goal is to minimize exposure of normal tissue to radiation as much as possible when moving the target back to the desired position. Due to the complex mechanical structure of 6 degree-of-freedom (6DoF) robots, it is not intuitive as to what 6 dimensional (6D) correction trajectory is optimal in achieving such a goal. With proportional-integrative-derivative (PID) and other controls, the potential exists that the controller may generate a trajectory that is highly curved, slow, or suboptimal in that it leads to unnecessary exposure of healthy tissue to radiation. This work investigates a novel feedback planning method that takes into account a robot's mechanical joint structure, patient safety tolerances, and other system constraints, and performs real-time optimization to search the entire 6D trajectory space in each time cycle so it can respond with an optimal 6D correction trajectory.Computer simulations were created for two 6DoF robotic patient support systems: a Stewart-Gough platform for moving a patient's head in frameless maskless stereotactic radiosurgery, and a linear accelerator treatment table for moving a patient in prostate cancer radiation therapy. Motion planning was formulated as an optimization problem and solved at real-time speeds using the L-BFGS algorithm. Three planning methods were investigated, moving the platform as fast as possible (platform-D), moving the target along a straight-line (target-S), and moving the target based on the fastest descent of position error (target-D). Both synthetic motion and prior recorded human motion were used as input data and output results were analyzed.For randomly generated 6D step-like and sinusoidal synthetic input motion, target-D planning demonstrated the smallest net trajectory error in all cases. On average, optimal planning was found to have a 45% smaller target trajectory error than platform-D control, and a 44% smaller target trajectory error than target-S planning. For patient head motion compensation, only target-D planning was able to maintain a ≤0.5mm and ≤0.5deg clinical tolerance objective for 100% of the treatment time. For prostate motion, both target-S planning and target-D planning outperformed platform-D control.A general 6D target trajectory optimization framework for robotic patient motion compensation systems was investigated. The method was found to be flexible as it allows control over various performance requirements such as mechanical limits, velocities, acceleration, or other system control objectives."
https://openalex.org/W2910151691,"Amyloid deposits of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and inflammation are common in atherosclerotic arteries. In this study, we investigated the interplay between oxidation of apoA-I methionine residues (Met(O)-ApoA-I), a known amyloidogenic modification of apoA-I, and the inflammatory response of immune cells. Soluble pre-fibrillar Met(O)-ApoA-I, but not apoA-I, induced intracellular accumulation of pro-interleukin (IL)-1β and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and IL-6 in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and human primary monocytes. Additionally, secretion of mature IL-1β was also activated in human monocytes. The pro-inflammatory activity of Met(O)-ApoA-I was Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent and CD36-independent and was solely determined by oxidation of apoA-I methionine residues, in particular Met-86 and Met-148. In contrast, amyloid fibrils or reconstituted high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) generated from Met(O)-ApoA-I did not induce cytokine production in BMDMs. Although lipid-free Met(O)-ApoA-I remained functional in extracting lipids from cells and generating HDL, it gained strong pro-inflammatory properties that may aggravate local inflammation in the arteries and atherosclerosis. Our study indicates that oxidation of apoA-I methionine residues produces a potent danger-associated molecular pattern capable of stimulating pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion at levels similar to those induced by known pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as lipopolysaccharide."
https://openalex.org/W2910316039,"Latino smokers in the United States (US) are known to experience smoking cessation treatment disparities due to their under-utilization of services, limited access to health care, and poor smoking cessation treatment outcomes. A limited number of studies have focused on developing and testing smoking cessation treatments for Latino smokers in the US. The objectives of this study were to conduct a feasibility pilot randomized trial testing three smoking cessation interventions for Latinos. Twenty-five adult Latino smokers were randomized to one of three groups: Culturally-Tailored Smoking Cessation plus Adherence Enhancement (CT+AE), Culturally-Tailored Smoking Cessation (CTSC), and a Health Education (HE) control group. All participants received three counseling sessions along with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Data relating to intervention acceptability and NRT adherence were collected. Self-reported 7-day point prevalence smoking was collected at 3 and 6 month follow-up and biochemically verified with expired carbon monoxide testing. Overall, the interventions demonstrated high levels of feasibility and acceptability. Days of nicotine patch use were found to be higher in the CT+AE group (mean (M) = 81.3;standard deviation (SD) = 3.32) than the CTSC (M = 68.6;SD = 13.66) and HE (M = 64;SD = 17.70) groups. At 3-month follow-up, approximately 50% of the CT+AE group were smoking abstinent, 25% of the CTSC group, and 44% of the HE group. At 6-month follow-up, 37.5% of the CT+AE group were abstinent, 25% of the CTSC group, and 44.4% of the HE group. This study is the first to target Latino smokers in the US with a culturally-tailored intervention that addresses treatment adherence. Results support the preliminary feasibility and acceptability of the CT+AE intervention. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02596711."
https://openalex.org/W2908922544,"Background Botulism is a disease caused by neurogenic toxins that block acetylcholine release, resulting in potentially life threatening neuroparalysis. Seven distinct serotypes of botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) have been described and are found in nature world-wide. This, combined with ease of production, make BoNTs a significant bioweapon threat. An essential countermeasure to this threat is an antitoxin to remove circulating toxin. An antitoxin, tradename BAT (Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent (A, B, C, D, E, F, G)–(Equine)), has been developed and its efficacy evaluated against all seven serotypes in guinea pigs. Methods and findings Studies were conducted to establish the lethal dose and clinical course of intoxication for all seven toxins, and post-exposure prophylactic efficacy of BAT product. Animals were monitored for signs of intoxication and mortality for 14 days. Guinea pig intramuscular LD50s (GPIMLD50) for all BoNTs ranged from 2.0 (serotype C) to 73.2 (serotype E) of mouse intraperitoneal LD50 units. A dose of 4x GPIMLD50 was identified as the appropriate toxin dose for use in subsequent efficacy and post-exposure prophylaxis studies. The main clinical signs observed included hind limb paralysis, weak limb, change in breathing rate/pattern, and forced abdominal respiration. Mean time to onset of clinical signs ranged from 12 hours (serotype E) to 39 hours (serotype G). Twelve hours post-intoxication was selected as the appropriate time point for intervention for all serotypes apart from E where 6 hours was selected because of the rapid onset and progression of clinical signs. Post-exposure treatment with BAT product resulted in a significantly (p<0.0001) higher survival at >0.008 scaled human dose for serotypes A, B, C, F and G, at >0.2x for serotype D and >0.04x for serotype E. Conclusions These studies confirm the efficacy of BAT as a post-exposure prophylactic therapy against all seven known BoNT serotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2909175029,"Background The preparation of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) requires substantial resources and the administrative processes can be burdensome. To facilitate the conduct of RCTs it is important to better understand cost drivers. In January 2014 the enactment of the new Swiss Legislation on Human Research (LHR) considerably changed the regulatory framework in Switzerland. We assess if the new LHR was associated with change in (i) resource use and costs to prepare an RCT, and (ii) approval times with research ethics committees (RECs) and the regulatory authority Swissmedic. Methods We surveyed investigators of RCTs which were approved by RECs in 2012 or in 2016 and asked for RCT preparation costs using a pre-specified item list. Additionally, we collected approval times from RECs and Swissmedic. Results The response rates of the investigator survey were 8.3% (19/228) for 2012 and 16.5% (47/285) in 2016. The median preparation cost of an RCT was USD 72,400 (interquartile range [IQR]: USD 59,500–87,700; n = 18) in 2012 and USD 72,600 (IQR: USD 42,800–169,600; n = 35) in 2016. For single centre RCTs a median REC approval time of 82 (IQR: 49–107; n = 38) days in 2012 and 92 (IQR: 65–131; n = 63) days in 2016 was observed. The median Swissmedic approval time for any clinical trial was 27 (IQR: 19–51; n = 213) days in 2012 and 49 (IQR: 36–67; n = 179) days in 2016. The total duration for achieving RCT approval from both authorities (REC and Swissmedic) in the parallel submission procedure applied in 2016 could not be assessed. Conclusion Based on limited data the costs to plan and prepare RCTs in Switzerland were approximately USD 72,000 in 2012 and 2016. For effective and valid research on costs and approval times of RCTs a greater willingness to share cost information among investigators and more collaboration between stakeholders with data linkage is necessary."

Most affected are the ring fingers, and little fingers of middle-aged men. Symptomatic for this disease is the increased proliferation and differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, which is accompanied by an elevated α-SMA expression. The present study evaluated the therapeutic benefit of blue light (λ = 453 nm, 38 mW/cm2, continuous radiance, spot size 10–12 cm2) as well as the molecular mechanism mediating this effect. It could be determined that blue light significantly diminished the induced α-SMA protein expression in both normal palmar fibroblasts and Duypuytren’s fibroblasts. The beneficial effect mediated by this irradiance, radiant exposure and wavelength was associated with an elevated reactive oxygen species generation. Furthermore, the data underlines the potential usefulness of blue light irradiation as a promising therapy option for Dupuytren’s disease, especially for relapse prevention, and may represent a useful strategy to treat further fibrotic diseases, such as keloids, hypertrophic scarring, and scleroderma."
https://openalex.org/W2909085140,"Objectives Animal and ex vitro studies suggested lipid-lowering agents (LLAs) may be used as an adjunct to standard anti- tuberculosis (TB) treatment. No human study has been conducted to date. Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), the current population-based cohort study sought to examine the association between use of LLAs and outcomes of patients with pulmonary TB receiving anti-TB treatment. Methods Using a NHIRD from 2003 to 2010, this population-based cohort study retrospectively examined the association between LLAs (statins or fibrates) and the outcomes of patients with pulmonary TB receiving anti-TB treatment. Results A total of 1452 adult patients newly diagnosed with pulmonary TB during the study period were identified and compared with 5808 matched patients. In the LAA cohort, 1258 received statin, and 295 received fibrate. Compared with patients who did not take LLA, patients who took oral LLAs had similar incidence of treatment completion at 9, 12, and 24 months. Conclusions Neither statins nor fibrates provide clinical benefit superior to that achieved with standard anti-tuberculosis treatment. Future clinical trials should investigate the effects of statins and fibrates on short-course standard anti-TB therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2909652762,"Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) is a foodborne intestinal pathogen and major cause of gastroenteritis worldwide. C. jejuni proteins that are immunogenic have been sought for their potential use in the development of biomarkers, diagnostic assays, or subunit vaccines for humans or livestock. To identify new immunogenic C. jejuni proteins, we used a native protein microarray approach. A protein chip, with over 1400 individually purified GST-tagged C. jejuni proteins, representing over 86% of the proteome, was constructed to screen for antibody titers present in test sera raised against whole C. jejuni cells. Dual detection of GST signals was incorporated as a way of normalizing the variation of protein concentrations contributing to the antibody staining intensities. We detected strong signals to 102 C. jejuni antigens. In addition to antigens recognized by antiserum raised against C. jejuni, parallel experiments were conducted to identify antigens cross-reactive to antiserum raised against various serotypes of E. coli or Salmonella or to healthy human sera. This led to the identification of 34 antigens specifically recognized by the C. jejuni antiserum, only four of which were previously known. The chip approach also allowed identification of conformational antigens. We demonstrate in the case of Cj1621 that antigen signals are lost to denaturing conditions commonly used in other approaches to identify immunogens. Antigens identified in this study include those possessing sequence features indicative of cell surface localization, as well as those that do not. Together, our results indicate that the unbiased chip-based screen can help reveal the full repertoire of host antibodies against microbial proteomes."

We hypothesize that as the frequency of students who have successfully completed the course increases in the student population, current students may be more likely to buy-in to the curriculum because this common experience could create a sense of community. We measured learning gains and attitudes during the transformation of an introductory biology course at a small, liberal arts college using our novel curriculum, Integrating Biology and Inquiry Skills (IBIS). Students perceived substantial learning gains in response to this curriculum, and concept assessments confirmed these gains. Over time, buy-in increased with each successive cohort, as demonstrated by the results of multiple assessment instruments, and students increasingly attributed specific components of the curriculum to their learning. These findings support our hypothesis and should encourage the adoption of curricular transformation using IBIS or other student-centered approaches."

We recently reported that expression of the small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel 2 (SK2, encoded by KCCN2) in atria from diabetic mice is significantly down-regulated, resulting in reduced SK currents in atrial myocytes from these mice. We also reported that the level of SK2 mRNA expression is not reduced in DM atria but that the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), a major mechanism of intracellular protein degradation, is activated in vascular smooth muscle cells in DM. This suggests a possible role of the UPS in reduced SK currents. To test this possibility, we examined the role of the UPS in atrial SK2 down-regulation in DM. We found that a muscle-specific E3 ligase, F-box protein 32 (FBXO-32, also called atrogin-1), was significantly up-regulated in diabetic mouse atria. Enhanced FBXO-32 expression in atrial cells significantly reduced SK2 protein expression, and siRNA-mediated FBXO-32 knockdown increased SK2 protein expression. Furthermore, co-transfection of SK2 with FBXO-32 complementary DNA in HEK293 cells significantly reduced SK2 expression, whereas co-transfection with atrogin-1ΔF complementary DNA (a nonfunctional FBXO-32 variant in which the F-box domain is deleted) did not have any effects on SK2. These results indicate that FBXO-32 contributes to SK2 down-regulation and that the F-box domain is essential for FBXO-32 function. In conclusion, DM-induced SK2 channel down-regulation appears to be due to an FBXO-32-dependent increase in UPS-mediated SK2 protein degradation.

To understand the regulation of SK channel degradation in diabetic atria, it is critical to identify and characterize the E3 ligase involved. In this study, we examined the role of muscle-specific E3 ligase in the regulation of SK channels by the UPS and tested the hypothesis that atrial SK channel protein down-regulation in DM is due to accelerated proteolysis as a result of up-regulation in E3 ligase and UPS activities. We have recently reported that the protein expression of SK2 and SK3 is significantly down-regulated in the atria of type 1 diabetic mice, whereas that of SK1 was unchanged (8Yi F. Ling T.Y. Lu T. Wang X.L. Li J. Claycomb W.C. Shen W.K. Lee H.C. Down-regulation of the small conductance calcium-activated potassium channels in diabetic mouse atria.J. Biol.

We also found that the mRNA expression of these SK channels was not reduced in diabetes (8Yi F. Ling T.Y. Lu T. Wang X.L. Li J. Claycomb W.C. Shen W.K. Lee H.C. Down-regulation of the small conductance calcium-activated potassium channels in diabetic mouse atria.J. Biol.

These results suggest that the down-regulation of SK channel protein expression in the diabetic mouse atrium may result from enhanced protein degradation. We have reported previously that atrogin-1, a muscle-specific E3 ligase, is up-regulated in diabetic mouse vessels and in vascular smooth muscle cells cultured with high glucose (HG) (11Zhang D.M. He T. Katusic Z.S. Lee H.C. Lu T. Muscle-specific F-box only proteins facilitate bk channel β1 subunit downregulation in vascular smooth muscle cells of diabetes mellitus.Circ. Res. 2010; 107 (20966391): 1454-145910.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.228361Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To determine whether atrogin-1 is involved with SK channel degradation, we conducted our experiments using HL-1 cells (8Yi F. Ling T.Y. Lu T. Wang X.L. Li J. Claycomb W.C. Shen W.K. Lee H.C. Down-regulation of the small conductance calcium-activated potassium channels in diabetic mouse atria.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290 (25605734): 7016-702610.1074/jbc.M114.607952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Overexpression of atrogin-1 was achieved by transduction of an adenoviral vector carrying the WT atrogin-1 (Ad-atrogin-1). The protein levels of atrogin-1, SK1, SK2, and SK3 were examined 48 h after transduction of atrogin-1 in HL-1 cells. The results showed that there was a 3.4-fold overexpression of atrogin-1 with Ad-atrogin-1 compared with that with a control vector (n = 3, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1A), and this was accompanied by a significant reduction of SK2 protein expression by 78% (n = 3, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1A). Overexpression of atrogin-1 did not produce any significant alterations in SK1 and SK3 protein expression (Fig. 1A). To further evaluate the regulation of SK channel expression by atrogin-1, we performed knockdown of atrogin-1 in HL-1 cells using atrogin-1 siRNAs. Forty-eight hours after transfection, atrogin-1 protein was reduced by 71% in cells transfected with siRNA compared with those with the scrambled RNAi control (n = 3, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1B). Knockdown of atrogin-1 produced a 2.1-fold increase in SK2 protein expression (n = 3, p < 0.05) but no significant change in that of SK1 and SK3 (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that mouse atrial SK2 is a target of atrogin-1 regulation. We examined the levels of atrogin-1 expression in the atrial myocardium of type 1 (streptozotocin-induced) and type 2 db/db diabetic mice. We found that atrogin-1 expression was significantly up-regulated in association with significant down-regulation of SK2 in both type 1 (n = 6 for each group, p < 0.05) and type 2 diabetic mouse atria (n = 5 for each group, p < 0.05) (Fig. 2, A and B). These results indicate that reduction of atrial SK2 channel protein expression is a common feature in the atria of type 1 and type 2 diabetic mice, which are associated with enhanced atrogin-1 expression. To determine the role of proteasomal degradation in SK2 protein regulation, HL-1 cells were transduced with Ad-atrogin-1 in the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (24 h, 10 μm). Treatment with MG-132 abolished the effects of atrogin-1, and the protein expression of SK2 was preserved (n = 6, p = N.S. versus control) (Fig. 3A). In HL-1 cells cultured in HG (25 mm), the protein expression of atrogin-1 was significantly up-regulated (n = 6, p < 0.05), and this was accompanied by significantly reduced SK2 protein expression (n = 6, p < 0.05) (Fig. 3B, left panel). In addition, knockdown of atrogin-1 by siRNA resulted in significant up-regulation of SK2 protein expression in these cells (n = 3, p < 0.05) (Fig. 3B, right panel). These results indicate that the UPS plays a critical role in regulating SK2 protein expression in atrial myocytes cultured in HG. Further demonstration of the specificity of atrogin-1 in SK2 protein degradation was performed by co-transfection of FLAG-tagged SK2 WT cDNAs (FLAG-SK2) with atrogin-1 WT cDNAs or atrogin-1ΔF cDNAs (a nonfunctional mutant with the F-box domain deleted) in HEK293 cells. There was no significant alteration in the level of atrogin-1ΔF protein expression compared with that of atrogin-1 WT (Fig. 4A). Forty-eight hours after transfection, expression of FLAG-SK2 was significantly lower in cells co-transfected with atrogin-1 WT cDNAs compared with those co-transfected with empty plasmids (control) (0.15 ± 0.06 for atrogin-1 versus 0.71 ± 0.14 for the control, n = 3, p < 0.05) (Fig. 4A). In contrast, co-transfection with atrogin-1ΔF did not reduce the level of FLAG-SK2 protein expression (0.71 ± 0.04 versus 0.71 ± 0.14 for the control, n = 3, p = N.S.) (Fig. 4A). Co-transfection with atrogin-1 cDNAs and ubiquitin cDNAs with FLAG-SK2 WT cDNAs or with FLAG-SK2-PDZ binding motif mutant cDNAs showed that the level of protein ubiquitination was significantly higher in FLAG-SK2 WT than that in FLAG-SK2-mutant (Fig. 4B, second and third lanes). In contrast, co-transfection with atrogin-1ΔF cDNAs and ubiquitin cDNAs had no significant effect on SK2 ubiquitination (Fig. 4B, fourth lane). Group data are presented in Fig. 4C, showing significant SK2 ubiquitination when SK2 WT and atrogin-1 WT are present (n = 3, p < 0.05). These results suggest that the FBXO domain in atrogin-1 and the PDZ binding motif of SK2 are both required to facilitate SK2 ubiquitination and degradation. We determined the functional consequences of enhanced atrogin-1 expression on SK2 channel activity. FLAG-SK2 WT cDNAs were co-transfected with atrogin-1 WT cDNAs or atrogin-1ΔF cDNAs in HEK293 cells. Patch clamp studies confirmed that SK2 current densities were significantly reduced by 3- to 5-fold (n = 4∼5, p < 0.05) in cells with FLAG-SK2 and atrogin-1 WT co-transfection compared with FLAG-SK2 and atrogin-1ΔF co-transfection (Fig. 5). These results are consistent with the findings from molecular biological experiments. In this study, we made several important observations. First, the expression of SK2 is markedly down-regulated in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic mouse atria. Second, the expression of atrogin-1 is significantly up-regulated in DM atria. Third, we provided compelling evidence that the expression of SK2 is closely regulated by atrogin-1-mediated UPS-dependent degradation. Fourth, both the F-box in atrogin-1 and the PDZ binding motif in SK2 are required for atrogin-1–mediated SK2 protein ubiquitination and degradation. Fifth, down-regulation of SK2 channel expression by atrogin-1 results in loss of channel activity. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism of cardiac atrial SK channel regulation by atrogin-1 that support our previous work in DM (8Yi F. Ling T.Y. Lu T. Wang X.L. Li J.

SK channels are voltage-independent and are activated by increased intracellular calcium, coupling intracellular calcium homeostasis with cell membrane potentials.

These results suggest that the electrophysiological consequence of SK channel expression is complex and could be anti-arrhythmic or pro-arrhythmic in different clinical situations. Hence, regulation of SK channel expression is highly important physiologically, with effects on atrial electrophysiology and arrhythmogenesis. We have recently reported that SK channel activity is significantly diminished in type 1 diabetic mouse atria as a result of reduced SK2 protein expression, which contributes to the significant prolongation in action potential duration and early after-depolarization formation (8Yi F.

These changes may lead to an increased susceptibility to develop atrial arrhythmias. However, the precise molecular mechanism that causes SK channel protein down-regulation in diabetic atria is unclear. One of the novel findings in this study is that the UPS is associated with the degradation of SK2 channel proteins. More than 80% of cellular proteins are degraded in a highly specific and selective fashion via the UPS (10Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin proteolytic system: from an idea to the patient bed.Proc. Am.

Each E3 recognizes a specific motif on the substrate protein; therefore, the specificity of the UPS depends on E3s (28Jiang Y.H. Beaudet A.L.

Hence, it is important to identify the specific E3s for target proteins to understand the regulation of their expression. F-box only proteins (FBXOs) are key components of the Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF) type ubiquitin ligase complex, functioning as sites for enzyme–substrate interaction (29Kipreos E.T. Pagano M.

We have found previously that atrogin-1 expression is up-regulated in vascular smooth muscle cells in diabetic vessels and when cultured in HG.

https://openalex.org/W2951156847,"Lung disease in alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) results from dysregulated proteolytic activity, mainly by neutrophil elastase (HNE), in the lung parenchyma. This is the result of a substantial reduction of circulating alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) and the presence in the plasma of inactive polymers of AAT. Moreover, some AAT mutants have reduced intrinsic activity toward HNE, as demonstrated for the common Z mutant, as well as for other rarer variants. Here we report the identification and characterisation of the novel AAT reactive centre loop variant Gly349Arg (p.G373R) present in the ExAC database. This AAT variant is secreted at normal levels in cellular models of AATD but shows a severe reduction in anti-HNE activity. Biochemical and molecular dynamics studies suggest it exhibits unfavourable RCL presentation to cognate proteases and compromised insertion of the RCL into β-sheet A. Identification of a fully dysfunctional AAT mutant that does not show a secretory defect underlines the importance of accurate genotyping of patients with pulmonary AATD manifestations regardless of the presence of normal levels of AAT in the circulation. This subtype of disease is reminiscent of dysfunctional phenotypes in anti-thrombin and C1-inibitor deficiencies so, accordingly, we classify this variant as the first pure functionally-deficient (type II) AATD mutant."

In the current paper, we describe the myrmecophilous behavior and the exocrine glands that enable the staphylinid beetle Dinarda dentata to live closely with its host ants Formica sanguinea. We confirm previous anecdotal descriptions of the beetle’s ability to snatch regurgitated food from ants that arrive with a full crop in the peripheral nest chambers, and describe how the beetle is able to appease its host ants and dull initial aggression in the ants."
https://openalex.org/W2909401525,"The maternal rearing environment can affect offspring fitness or phenotype indirectly via 'maternal effects' and can also influence a mother's behaviour and fecundity directly. However, it remains uncertain how the effects of the maternal rearing environment cascade through multiple trophic levels, such as in plant-insect herbivore-natural enemy interactions. Pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) show differential fitness on host legume species, while generalist aphid parasitoids can show variable fitness on different host aphid species, suggesting that maternal effects could operate in a plant-aphid-parasitoid system. We tested whether the maternal rearing environment affected the behaviour and fitness of aphids by rearing aphids on two plant hosts that were either the same as or different from those experienced by the mothers. A similar approach was used to test the behaviour and fitness of parasitoid wasps in response to maternal rearing environment. Here, the host environment was manipulated at the plant or plant and aphid trophic levels for parasitoid wasps. We also quantified the quality of host plants for aphids and host aphids for parasitoid wasps. In choice tests, aphids and parasitoid wasps had no preference for the plant nor plant and aphid host environment on which they were reared. Aphid offspring experienced 50.8% higher intrinsic rates of population growth, 43.4% heavier offspring and lived 14.9% longer when feeding on bean plants compared to aphids feeding on pea plants, with little effect of the maternal rearing environment. Plant tissue nitrogen concentration varied by 21.3% in response to aphid mothers' rearing environment, and these differences correlated with offspring fitness. Maternal effects in parasitoid wasps were only observed when both the plant and aphid host environment was changed: wasp offspring were heaviest by 10.9-73.5% when both they and their mothers developed in bean-reared pea aphids. Also, parasitoid wasp fecundity was highest by 38.4% when offspring were oviposited in the maternal rearing environment. These findings indicate that maternal effects have a relatively small contribution towards the outcome of plant-aphid-parasitoid interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2909578130,"New antibiotics are needed against antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria. The repurposed antifungal drug, ciclopirox, equally blocks antibiotic-susceptible or multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates, indicating that it is not affected by existing resistance mechanisms. Toward understanding how ciclopirox blocks growth, we screened E. coli mutant strains and found that disruption of genes encoding products involved in galactose salvage, enterobacterial common antigen synthesis, and transport of the iron binding siderophore, enterobactin, lowered the minimum inhibitory concentration of ciclopirox needed to block growth of the mutant compared to the isogenic parent strain. We found that ciclopirox induced enterobactin production and that this effect is strongly affected by the deletion of the galactose salvage genes encoding UDP-galactose 4-epimerase, galE, or galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, galT. As disruption of ECA synthesis activates the regulation of capsular synthesis (Rcs) phosphorelay, which inhibits bacterial swarming and promotes biofilm development, we test whether ciclopirox prevents activation of the Rcs pathway. Sub-inhibitory concentrations of ciclopirox increased swarming of the E. coli laboratory K12 strain BW25113 but had widely varying effects on swarming or surface motility of clinical isolate E. coli, A. baumannii, and K. pneumoniae. There was no effect of ciclopirox on biofilm production, suggesting it does not target Rcs. Altogether, our data suggest ciclopirox-mediated alteration of lipopolysaccharides stimulates enterobactin production and affects bacterial swarming."
https://openalex.org/W2910328687,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is the primary enzyme that converts angiotensin I (Ang I) to angiotensin II (Ang II) in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). However, chymase hydrates Ang I to Ang II independently of ACE in some kidney diseases, and it may play an important role. The present study investigated whether chymase played a crucial role in aristolochic acid I (AAI)-induced nephropathy. C57BL/6 mice were treated with AAI via intraperitoneal injection for an accumulated AAI dosage of 45 mg/kg body weight (BW) (15 mg/kg BW per day for 3 days). The animals were sacrificed after acute kidney injury development, and blood, urine and kidneys were harvested for biochemical and molecular assays. Mice exhibited increased serum creatinine, BUN and urinary protein after the AAI challenge. Significant infiltrating inflammatory cells and tubular atrophy were observed in the kidneys, and high immunocytokine levels were detected. Renal RAS-related enzyme activities were measured, and a significantly increased chymase activity and slightly decreased ACE activity were observed in the AAI-treated mice. The renal Ang II level reflected the altered profile of RAS enzymes and was significantly increased in AAI-treated mice. Treatment of AAI-induced nephropathic mice with an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) or chymase inhibitor (CI; chymostatin) reduced renal Ang II levels. The combination of ACEI and CI (ACEI+CI) treatment significantly reversed the AAI-induced changes of Ang II levels and kidney inflammation and injuries. AAI treatment significantly increased renal p-MEK without increasing p-STAT3 and p-Smad3 levels, and p-MEK/p-ERK1/2 signalling pathway was significantly activated. CI and ACEI+CI treatments reduced this AAI-activated signaling pathway. AAI-induced nephropathy progression was significantly mitigated with CI and ACEI+CI treatment. This study elucidates the role of RAS in the pathogenesis of AAI-induced nephropathy."

The neurotransmitters oxytocin and GABA have been implicated in neural responses to inequity. However, it remains poorly understood not only how individual genetic factors related to oxytocin and GABA affect the neural mechanisms behind inequity aversion, but also how these genes interact. To address these issues, we examined relationships between genotypes, behavioral decisions and brain activities during the ultimatum game. We identified interactive effects between the polymorphisms of the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) and glutamate decarboxylase 1 gene for GABA synthesis (GAD1) on envy aversion (i.e., disadvantageous inequity aversion) and on envy-induced activity in the dorsal ACC (dACC). Thus, our integrated approach suggested interactive genetic effects between OXTR and GAD1 on envy aversion and the underlying neural substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2952529147,"The “cost of begging” is a prominent prediction of costly signalling theory, suggesting that offspring begging has to be costly in order to be honest. Seminal signalling models predict that there is a unique equilibrium cost function for the offspring that results in honest signalling and this cost function must be proportional to parent’s fitness loss. This prediction is only valid if signal cost and offspring condition is assumed to be independent. Here we generalize these models by allowing signal cost to depend on offspring condition. We demonstrate in the generalized model that any signal cost proportional to the fitness gain of the offspring also results in honest signalling. Moreover, we show that any linear combination of the two cost functions (one proportional to parent’s fitness loss, as in previous models, the other to offspring’s fitness gain) also leads to honest signalling in equilibrium, yielding infinitely many solutions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that there exist linear combinations such that the equilibrium cost of signals is negative and the signal is honest. Our results show that costly signalling theory cannot predict a unique equilibrium cost in signalling games of parent-offspring conflicts if signal cost depends on offspring condition. It follows, contrary to previous claims, that the existence of parent-offspring conflict does not imply costly equilibrium signals. As an important consequence, it is meaningless to measure the “cost of begging” as long as the dependence of signal cost on offspring condition is unknown. Any measured equilibrium cost in case of condition-dependent signal cost has to be compared both to the parent’s fitness loss and to the offspring’s fitness gain in order to provide meaningful interpretation."
https://openalex.org/W2909735740,"Main objectives Echocardiographic parameters have been used to predict outcomes for specific intensive care unit (ICU) populations. We sought to define echocardiographic parameters for ICU patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Design, setting, participants, and measurements This is a historical cohort study of consecutive ICU patients at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota) who received CRRT from December 9, 2006, through November 13, 2015. Only patients with an echocardiographic examination within 7 days of CRRT initiation were considered. Results The study included 1,276 patients. Decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; ≤45%) was noted in 361/1,120 (32%) and increased right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP; ≥40 mm Hg) was noted in 529/798 (66%). Right ventricular systolic dysfunction was observed in 320/820 (39%). The most common valvular abnormality was tricuspid regurgitation (244/1,276 [19%]). Stratification of these parameters by ICU type (medical, surgical, cardiothoracic, cardiac) showed that most echocardiographic abnormalities were significantly more prevalent among cardiac ICU patients: LVEF ≤45% (67/105 [64%]), RVSP ≥40 mm Hg (63/79 [80%]) and tricuspid regurgitation (50/130 [38%]). We compared patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) vs end-stage renal disease and showed that decreased LVEF (284/921 [31%] vs 78/201 [39%]), was significantly less prevalent among patients with AKI, but increased RVSP was more prevalent (445/651 [68%] vs 84/147 [57%]) with AKI. Conclusions ICU patients who required CRRT had increased prevalence of pulmonary hypertension and right and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Prediction of adverse outcomes with echocardiographic parameters in this patient population can lead to identification of modifiable risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2908757114,"Circulating advanced glycation end products (AGE) and their receptor, RAGE, are increased after a myocardial infarction (MI) episode and seem to be associated with worse prognosis in patients. Despite the increasing importance of these molecules in the course of cardiac diseases, they have never been characterized in an animal model of MI. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize AGE formation and RAGE expression in plasma and cardiac tissue during cardiac remodeling after MI in rats. Adult male Wistar rats were randomized to receive sham surgery (n = 15) or MI induction (n = 14) by left anterior descending coronary artery ligation. The MI group was stratified into two subgroups based on postoperative left ventricular ejection fraction: low (MIlowEF) and intermediate (MIintermEF). Echocardiography findings and plasma levels of AGEs, protein carbonyl, and free amines were assessed at baseline and 2, 30, and 120 days postoperatively. At the end of follow-up, the heart was harvested for AGE and RAGE evaluation. No differences were observed in AGE formation in plasma, except for a decrease in absorbance in MIlowEF at the end of follow-up. A decrease in yellowish-brown AGEs in heart homogenate was found, which was confirmed by immunodetection of N-ε-carboxymethyl-lysine. No differences could be seen in plasma RAGE levels among the groups, despite an increase in MI groups over the time. However, MI animals presented an increase of 50% in heart RAGE at the end of the follow-up. Despite the inflammatory and oxidative profile of experimental MI in rats, there was no increase in plasma AGE or RAGE levels. However, AGE levels in cardiac tissue declined. Thus, we suggest that the rat MI model should be employed with caution when studying the AGE-RAGE signaling axis or anti-AGE drugs for not reflecting previous clinical findings."

Echocardiographic reverse remodeling was compared between AF-SVR patients (n = 17) and those with SR (n = 88) at six months and 12 months after CRT treatment. We also evaluated the changes in QRS duration; New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class; and long-term composite clinical outcomes including cardiac death, heart transplantation, and heart failure (HF)-related hospitalization. Left ventricular pacing sites and biventricular pacing percentages were not significantly different between the AF-SVR and SR groups. However, heart rate increase after CRT was significantly greater in the AF-SVR group than in the SR group (P < 0.001). At six and 12 months postoperation, both groups showed a comparable improvement in NYHA class; QRS narrowing; and echocardiographic variables including left ventricular end-systolic volume, left ventricular ejection fraction, and left atrial volume index. Over the median follow-up duration of 1.6 (interquartile range: 0.8-2.2) years, no significant between-group differences were observed regarding the rates of long-term composite clinical events (35% versus 24%; hazard ratio: 1.71; 95% confidence interval: 0.23-12.48; P = 0.60). CRT implantation provided comparable beneficial effects for patients with AF-SVR as compared with those with SR, by correcting electrical dyssynchrony and increasing biventricular pacing rate, in terms of QRS narrowing, symptom improvement, ventricular reverse remodeling, and long-term clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2910369009,"The existence of a functional relationship between speech perception and production systems is now widely accepted, but the exact nature and role of this relationship remains quite unclear. The existence of idiosyncrasies in production and in perception sheds interesting light on the nature of the link. Indeed, a number of studies explore inter-individual variability in auditory and motor prototypes within a given language, and provide evidence for a link between both sets. In this paper, we attempt to simulate one study on coupled idiosyncrasies in the perception and production of French oral vowels, within COSMO, a Bayesian computational model of speech communication. First, we show that if the learning process in COSMO includes a communicative mechanism between a Learning Agent and a Master Agent, vowel production does display idiosyncrasies. Second, we implement within COSMO three models for speech perception that are, respectively, auditory, motor and perceptuo-motor. We show that no idiosyncrasy in perception can be obtained in the auditory model, since it is optimally tuned to the learning environment, which does not include the motor variability of the Learning Agent. On the contrary, motor and perceptuo-motor models provide perception idiosyncrasies correlated with idiosyncrasies in production. We draw conclusions about the role and importance of motor processes in speech perception, and propose a perceptuo-motor model in which auditory processing would enable optimal processing of learned sounds and motor processing would be helpful in unlearned adverse conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2911174738,"In Spain, the issue of unemployment or precarious employment worsen with globalization, leading to an expansion of the so-called working poor in the labour market. According to previous literature, the economic poverty that is characteristic of this group may accompany poverty competency. In particular, the working poor resort to informal and poorly developed job-search strategies. This study addresses the job search methods used by people at risk of poverty and social exclusion. It provides evidence on the subject and serves as a basis for the adaptation of socio-labour intermediation programmes to this group. The hypothesis of this study is that people at high risk will predominantly use informal strategies that require a low level of job-search skills. A survey-based correlational study is conducted using a questionnaire completed by 279 people participating in socio-labour intermediation programmes developed by the Action against Hunger Foundation (AaHF) in Spain. Information on poverty indicators and on job-search strategies is collected. Data are analysed through cluster analysis, which distinguish two groups of people at risk of poverty and social exclusion (high risk and low risk), followed by a comparison of means (t-test) with a subsequent calculation of effect size using Cohen's d. Results show statistically significant differences with a medium effect size (between 0.45 and 0.50) for the typology of job-search strategies used, confirming the initial hypothesis. These results offer relevant information that should be considered when developing programmes aimed at improving social and labour issues for people at risk of poverty and social exclusion."

Objectives To investigate the efficacy of epidural electric stimulation-guided epidural analgesia in vaginal delivery. Study design An open label randomized prospective study. Methods Laboring women were randomized to two groups: epidural catheter insertion using only a loss of resistance technique or a loss of resistance technique with confirmation by electric stimulation. Catheters in both groups were initially tested with 3 ml of 1% lidocaine and those with any evidence of motor blockade were considered intrathecal. Sensory blockade and an 11 point numerical rating score for pain were assessed 30 minutes after administration of an epidural bolus of 10 ml of 0.22% ropivacaine with fentanyl. Successful epidural analgesia was defined as a decrease of 2 or more in the pain score and a bilateral L1-T10 sensory blockade. Results Thirty-one patients were randomized to each group. The first 20 patients in each group were enrolled in a pilot study and were also included in the final analysis. One patient in the electric stimulation group was excluded owing to dural puncture by the Tuohy needle. One patient in each group demonstrated motor blockade after test dose and were considered failures. The number (% (95% confidence interval)) of successful cases were 29 out of 30 (97% (85, 100%)) in the electric stimulation group and 24 out of 31 (77% (61, 89%)) in the loss of resistance group (P = 0.053). However, analysis of only patients with absence of motor blockade revealed that 29 out of 29 (100% (92, 100%)) patients in the electric stimulation group and 24 of 29 (80% (63, 91%)) patients in the loss of resistance group had adequate analgesia (P = 0.024). Conclusions Although limited by lack of blinding, small study size and inclusion of pilot study data, this study suggests epidural electric stimulation improves the success rate of subsequent labor analgesia."
