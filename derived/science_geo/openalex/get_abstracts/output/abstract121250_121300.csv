https://openalex.org/W1976551834,"Hedgehog (Hh) proteins comprise a family of secreted signaling molecules essential for patterning a variety of structures in animal embryogenesis. During biosynthesis, Hh undergoes an autocleavage reaction, mediated by its carboxyl-terminal domain, that produces a lipid-modified amino-terminal fragment responsible for all known Hh signaling activity. Here it is reported that cholesterol is the lipophilic moiety covalently attached to the amino-terminal signaling domain during autoprocessing and that the carboxyl-terminal domain acts as an intramolecular cholesterol transferase. This use of cholesterol to modify embryonic signaling proteins may account for some of the effects of perturbed cholesterol biosynthesis on animal development."

The antral and pyloric gastric mucosa of mpS2-null mice was dysfunctional and exhibited severe hyperplasia and dysplasia. All homozygous mutant mice developed antropyloric adenoma, and 30 percent developed multifocal intraepithelial or intramucosal carcinomas. The small intestine was characterized by enlarged villi and an abnormal infiltrate of lymphoid cells. These results indicate that mpS2 is essential for normal differentiation of the antral and pyloric gastric mucosa and may function as a gastric-specific tumor suppressor gene."

Various strategies such as elevating the level of SOD inside and/or outside the cells have been employed for protection against oxidative injury. Exogenously added SOD may be immunogenic, does not penetrate readily into the cells, and unless bound to a protein or polyethylene glycol has a metabolic half-life of only several minutes (3Boccu E.

Usually SOD mimics are chelates of transition metals such as copper, iron, or manganese (denoted L-Mn+), which like the metal center in native SOD can undergo alternate reduction and oxidation of the metal (Mechanism I) to yield O2 and H2O2. L−Mn++O2·_⇄k1k−1L−M(n−1)++O2(Eq. 1) L−M(n−1)++O2·−+2H+−k2L−Mn++H2O2(Eq. 2) There are, however, cases where alternate oxidation and reduction take place (Mechanism II).

On the other hand, metal-containing SOD mimics are prone to dissociation in the presence of cellular proteins, thus not only causing loss of SOD mimic activity but also mobilization of potentially toxic redox-active metals (15Hahn S.M. Krishna C.M. Samuni A. Mitchell J.B. Russo A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of certain metal-based SOD mimics has been previously questioned (15Hahn S.M. Krishna C.M. Samuni A. Mitchell J.B. Russo A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and the methods for assaying SOD activity have been critically evaluated (16Goldstein S. Czapski G. J. Free Radicals Biol.

More recently, metal-free reagents have been reported to act as mimics of SOD (27Samuni A. Krishna C.M. Riesz P. Finkelstein E. Russo A. J.

Nitroxides have been reported to catalyze O2−˙dismutation through two different catalytic pathways including reductive (27Samuni A. Krishna C.M. Riesz P. Finkelstein E. Russo A. J. Biol Chem. 1988; 263: 17921-17924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and oxidative (28Krishna M.C. Graham D.A. Samuni A. Mitchell J.B. Russo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5537-5541Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) reaction mechanisms. Conversely, kinetics analysis of rapid mixing stopped flow experiments designed to measure the effect of nitroxides on superoxide decay did not reveal any SOD activity (29Weiss R.H. Flickinger A.G. Rivers W.J. Hardy M.M. Aston K.W. Ryan U.S. Riley D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23049-23054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), leading to the conclusion that nitroxides act as scavengers of O2−˙. Detoxification of O2−˙is also achievable by scavengers that stoichiometrically react with it. Yet, O2−˙removal by any scavenger differs from that exerted by SOD mimics by the mechanisms underlying the reactions and also by the respective products. Although catalytic reactions are generally readily identifiable, the distinction of a scavenger of O2−˙from an authentic SOD mimic is not always straightforward. An inadequate distinction might derive from the ambiguous definition of an SOD mimic along with the unique nature of SOD, which distinguishes it from most enzymes. In view of the present results, previous approaches adopted for the evaluation of SOD mimics are analyzed and critically examined. Catalase (H2O2 oxidoreductase, EC 1.11.1.6), xanthine oxidase (EC 1.2.3.2, xanthine:oxygen oxidoreductase) (XO) and Cu-Zn SOD were purchased from Boehringer-Mannheim Co.; 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TPO) and 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TPL) were purchased from Aldrich; hypoxanthine (HX) and ferricytochrome c (cyt-cIII) were obtained from Sigma. Distilled deionized water was used throughout all experiments. All experiments involved a continuous flux of superoxide radicals generated enzymatically. Unless otherwise stated, the reaction mixture contained 50 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7, 1-5 mM HX, 50 μM diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) to minimize the effect of adventitious redox-active metal ions, and 130-260 units/ml catalase to avoid undesired effects of H2O2. The reaction was generally started by adding about 0.01-0.08 units/ml XO, providing a steady flux of ~2-16 μM O2−˙/min. Throughout the text superoxide radicals are denoted as O2−˙rather than O2−˙/⋅OOH, although it is the protonated form that is oxidizing the nitroxide. Samples of 100 μl for EPR experiments were drawn into a gas-permeable teflon capillary (Zeus Industries, Raritran, NJ) of 0.8-mm inner diameter, 0.38-mm wall thickness, and 15-cm length. Each capillary was folded twice, inserted into a narrow quartz tube that was open at both ends (2.5-mm inner diameter), and then placed into the EPR cavity. To maintain constant level of O2 during the experiments, air was blown around the sample without having to disturb the alignment of the tube within the spectrometer cavity. EPR spectra were recorded on a Varian E9 X-band spectrometer, with field set at 3357 G, modulation frequency of 100 KHz, modulation amplitude of 1 G, and a nonsaturating incident microwave power of 10 mW. The kinetic experiments were conducted by following (a) the rate of cyt-cII formation using absorption spectroscopy (OD550 nm, Δϵ = 21 mM−1 cm−1) and (b) the rate of decay of nitroxide signal using EPR spectrometry, induced by a constant flux of superoxide. Competition kinetics were studied by introducing various concentrations of nitroxide or SOD, which compete for superoxide radicals and consequently lower the rate of O2−˙-induced cyt-cIII reduction (spectrophotometric assays) or spin loss of the nitroxide (EPR assays). To analyze the data, the rate of reaction in the absence of scavenger/catalyst, denoted V and equal to the flux of O2−˙, was divided by the rate of reaction observed in the presence of scavenger/catalyst, denoted v. The values of V/v were plotted versus the concentration of the competitive additive (scavenger/catalyst). Upon the addition of SOD in the optical experiments, the values of V/v for the rates of cyt-cIII reduction depended linearly on [SOD] according to: V/v(optical) =1+[SOD]⋅kSOD+ superoxide cyt−cIII⋅kcyt-cII + superoxide EXPRESSION I where kSOD+superoxide is the catalytic rate constant of O2−˙dismutation by SOD. For competition against nitroxide, V/v values depended linearly on [nitroxide] according to: V/v(optical) =1+[ nitroxide ]⋅kapp / cyt- cII⋅kcyt- III + superoxide ExPRESSION II where kapp denotes the rate constant of O2−˙reaction with the nitroxide (be it a scavenger or a catalyst). For the EPR experiments SOD was used to compete for O2−˙against the nitroxide. There the V/v values of spin loss rates of nitroxide depended linearly on [SOD] according to:V/v(EPR)=1+[SOD]⋅kSOD+ superoxid /TTPO⋅kapp(EPR) To evaluate kapp(EPR), the values of the slopes obtained from expressions II (optical experiment) and III (EPR experiment) were divided yielding expression IV, which is independent of SOD concentration,slope(optical)/slope(EPR)=[TPO].kapp(EPR)/[cyt-cIII].kcyt-cIII+superoxide from which kapp(EPR) was evaluated using the known value for kcyt-cIII+superoxide (30Butler J. Jayson G.G. Swallow A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 408: 215-222Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 31Butler J. Koppenol W.H. Margoliash E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10747-10750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that kapp evaluated from expression II is not the same as kapp(EPR) evaluated from expression IV. The reaction of O2−˙with two nitroxides TPO and TPL was studied using both direct (EPR) and indirect (optical) techniques. Previous studies showed that nitroxides shuttle among three oxidation states as depicted in Scheme 1 of 41Krishna M.C. Samuni A. Taira J. Goldstein S. Mitchell J.B. Russo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26018-26025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar. Oxazolidine nitroxide derivatives react with superoxide via a reductive mode in which O2−˙reduces the nitroxide directly to its corresponding hydroxylamine, which in turn is oxidized to the parent nitroxide by an additional superoxide (27Samuni A. Krishna C.M. Riesz P. Finkelstein E. Russo A. J. Biol Chem. 1988; 263: 17921-17924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Samuni A. Min A. Krishna C.M. Mitchell J.B. Russo A. Adv. Exp. Med.

In contrast, piperidine derivatives such as TPO and TPL are readily oxidized by protonated superoxide, ·OOH, to yield oxo-ammonium cation (28Krishna M.C. Graham D.A. Samuni A. Mitchell J.B. Russo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5537-5541Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar)Equation 6 which in turn oxidizes another superoxide to molecular oxygen:Equation 7 The net process (Equation 5) is anticipated to remove O2−˙without affecting nitroxide concentration. A constant flux of superoxide was generated enzymatically, and the competition between nitroxide (catalyst/scavenger) and cyt-cIII for O2−˙was used for studying the reaction kinetics. The use of SOD-inhibitable reduction of cyt-cIII by O2−˙radicals to study SOD activity of nitroxides is limited because the cyt-cII formed is oxidizable by H2O2 (34Turrens J.F. McCord J.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 227: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 35Radi R. Thomson L. Rubbo H. Prodanov E. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12709-12716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and also by nitroxide (29Weiss R.H. Flickinger A.G. Rivers W.J. Hardy M.M. Aston K.W. Ryan U.S. Riley D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23049-23054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, catalase was always included, nitroxide concentrations were kept low to minimize any reverse reaction (29Weiss R.H. Flickinger A.G. Rivers W.J. Hardy M.M. Aston K.W. Ryan U.S. Riley D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23049-23054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and only the initial rates of reaction were used for the evaluation of the activity. Control experiments showed that the rate of cyt-cII oxidation by 10-20 μM nitroxide was negligible as compared with the rate of cyt-cIII reduction by O2−˙(data not shown). To study the reaction of nitroxides with superoxide, the rate of formation of cyt-cII was spectrophotometrically monitored at pH 7 in the absence (V) and in the presence (v) of various nitroxide concentrations. TPO and TPL inhibited the reduction of 22 μM cyt-cIII by competing for the superoxide in a concentration-dependent manner, the data were analyzed by plotting V/v as a function of [nitroxide] according to Expression II, and the results of a typical experiment are displayed in Fig. 1. From the slope of the lines as in Fig. 1 and knowing ksuperoxide+cyt-cIII (30Butler J. Jayson G.G. Swallow A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 408: 215-222Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 31Butler J. Koppenol W.H. Margoliash E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10747-10750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at pH 7, kapp was calculated to be 1.8 × 106M−1 s−1 and 6.5 × 105M−1 s−1 for TPO and TPL, respectively. These results alone, however, cannot distinguish whether nitroxides react with O2−˙as catalysts or scavengers. The competition of nitroxide against cyt-cIII for O2−˙was repeated at 30°C while varying the pH using 50 mM phosphate buffer. The rate constants were calculated taking into account the rate constants of cyt-cIII with O2−˙previously measured at the respective pH (30Butler J. Jayson G.G. Swallow A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 408: 215-222Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and corrected for 30°C (31Butler J. Koppenol W.H. Margoliash E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10747-10750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results are displayed in Fig. 2 and show that kapp increases with [H+], indicating, as anticipated, that ·OOH rather than O2−˙(pKa = 4.8) oxidizes the nitroxide. EPR was used to investigate the fate of the nitroxide upon its reaction with superoxide generated by HX/XO. To examine the catalytic activity of nitroxides, the effect of a constant flux of O2−˙on 10-50 μM TPO or TPL was investigated by directly monitoring their EPR signal. The reaction mixture, placed in a gas-permeable teflon capillary inserted inside the cavity of an EPR spectrometer, was continuously flushed with air at room temperature. The reaction was started by adding 0.08 units/ml XO, and the intensity of the EPR signal of the nitroxide was continuously monitored. The rate of O2−˙generation was independently determined by following at 550 nm the SOD-inhibitable reduction of cyt-cIII in the absence of nitroxide. Fig. 3 shows that under a steady O2−˙flux of ~16 μM·min−1, which was maintained for over 1 h, no change of nitroxide EPR signal intensity was detectable. It shows that the restoration of nitroxide via Equation 7 is so fast that no accumulation of the oxo-ammonium cation is detectable. These results provide direct evidence for the catalytic role played by nitroxides where superoxide is removed by both Equations 6 and 7. Furthermore, becausekcat =2k6k7/k6+k7EXPRESSION V and k7≫ k6, the value of kapp, determined from expression II, actually reflects kcat = 2k6 and not k6. The addition of 1 mM NADH, however, caused a rapid and complete loss of the EPR signal of TPO (Fig. 3) because of a two-electron reduction of the oxo-ammonium transient (TPO+), formed in Reaction R6, to its respective cyclic hydroxylamine (28Krishna M.C. Graham D.A. Samuni A. Mitchell J.B. Russo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5537-5541Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar):Equation 8 The loss of EPR signal was preventable by 100 units/ml SOD (data not shown), demonstrating that a simultaneous presence of ⋅HO2/O2−˙and the two-electron reductant is required to convert TPO to its respective cyclic hydroxylamine (via TPO+), further substantiating the role played by Equations 6 and 8. The competition between SOD and TPO (or TPL) forO2−˙ and the direct detection in real time of the nitroxides by EPR were also used to determine their reactivity toward superoxide. To determine the rate constant (k6) for nitroxide oxidation by ⋅OOH/O2−˙, NADH was added to eliminate the contribution of Equation 7 toward O2−˙decay. In this assay TPO is exposed to O2−˙flux in the presence of an excess of NADH. Increasing the TPO concentration did not enhance the rate of spin loss, indicating that all O2−˙formed react with TPO to yield TPO+ (Equation 6), which in turn is reduced by NADH to cyclic hydroxylamine (Equation 8). Under these conditions the initial rate of spin loss validly reflects the flux of superoxide (denoted V). Upon repeating the experiment in the presence of increasing concentration of SOD, the rate of spin loss (denoted v) decreases as a result of a competition between SOD and nitroxide for O2−˙/⋅OOH The results of a typical experiment done with 100 μM TPO (or 200 μM TPL) and 1 mM NADH are displayed in Fig. 4. The values of V/v were plotted versus [SOD] according to Expression III. The inhibition by SOD of O2−˙-induced reduction of cyt-cIII is also included in Fig. 4 in order to simplify calculation of the rate constants, as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” The reaction rate constants kapp(EPR) = k6 evaluated from Expression IV were 7.4 × 105M−1 s−1 and 2.5 × 105M−1 s−1 for TPO and TPL, respectively. Because a catalyst is defined as a substance that accelerates a chemical reaction in which it itself is not consumed in the overall process, its amount bears no stoichiometric relationship to the quantity of the substrate altered. This is not the case with a stoichiometric scavenger, which is consumed in the reaction. Generally, for an enzyme-substrate (or any catalyst-substrate) interaction, the concentration of the catalyst is far below that of its substrate. Generally, this perception is true for any homogeneous reaction system. In contrast, SOD whose substrate is a free radical, is unique because its physiological concentration exceeds that of its substrate by several orders of magnitude. The concentration of cellular SOD can achieve 10 μM (37Brawn K. Fridovich I. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1980; 492: 9-18PubMed Google Scholar), whereas that of its substrate is about 106-fold lower, ranging around 10 pM (37Brawn K. Fridovich I. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1980; 492: 9-18PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike enzymes, which obey the Michaelis-Menten model, SOD flip-flops between its two oxidation states, is never saturated even with super-physiologic O2−˙concentrations, and exhibits first order reaction kinetics with respect to [O2−˙]. It was previously attempted to distinguish a catalytic process from a stoichiometric reaction by analyzing the reaction kinetics (29Weiss R.H. Flickinger A.G. Rivers W.J. Hardy M.M. Aston K.W. Ryan U.S. Riley D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23049-23054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To do that, a reaction system in which O2−˙radicals spontaneously dismutate was supplemented with a tested compound (scavenger/catalyst), which is capable of reacting with the radicals: scavenger/catalyst +O2−˙−k9 reaction products (Eq. 9) Whenever the test compound modifies the decay kinetics of O2−˙, the new kinetic order should reflect the mechanism underlying the perturbing reaction. Using this method, an initial super-physiologic concentration of O2−˙is employed in both pulse radiolysis (17Goldstein S. Michel C. Bors W. Saran M. Czapski G. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1988; 4: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and rapid mixing stopped flow (29Weiss R.H. Flickinger A.G. Rivers W.J. Hardy M.M. Aston K.W. Ryan U.S. Riley D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23049-23054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) techniques. The decay of O2−˙is then followed spectrophotometrically, and the reaction kinetics are studied. The method requires that the reagent under investigation (scavenger or putative SOD mimic) significantly perturbs the spontaneous decay of O2−˙under the condition where [tested compound]o < [O2−˙]o. This implies that the rate of reaction with any scavenger/catalyst should be at least comparable with that of the spontaneous dismutation of superoxide in order to see an effect when O2−˙is directly monitored. In other words, unless the conditions of Expression VIk5O2−˙2<<k9O2−˙[tested compound ]EXPRESSION VI are met, the direct kinetics analysis cannot provide conclusive information of the mechanism underlying the activity of the reagent under investigation. This limitation cannot be circumvented by increasing the concentration of the reagent under investigation because the reaction would exhibit pseudo-first order kinetics and pre-empt any discrimination between stoichiometric and catalytic processes. The direct kinetics analysis suffers from another serious limitation when the reduced form of the SOD mimic under study is rapidly oxidizable by molecular oxygen (38Czapski G. Goldstein S. Meyerstein D. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1988; 4: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). With physiological concentrations of O2−˙, where k−1[O2] > k2[O2−˙], the actual catalytic rate constant, kactual, is much lower than the limiting value of kcat (38Czapski G. Goldstein S. Meyerstein D. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1988; 4: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).kactual =2k1k2/k1+k2+k−1⋅O2O2−˙EXPRESSION VII Therefore, direct assay methods can overestimate the catalytic activity and erroneously assess the physiological efficiency of SOD mimics (17Goldstein S. Michel C. Bors W. Saran M. Czapski G. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1988; 4: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). When [O2−˙] ≪ [scavenger/catalyst], as is the case under physiological concentrations, the reaction shown in Equation 9 would exhibit a pseudo-zero order kinetics even with respect to a scavenger as long as its concentration remains practically unchanged. Consequently, a stoichiometric scavenger would erroneously appear to act as a catalyst. The opposite error might exist upon the assessment of reagents that remove O2−˙catalytically but have a lower value of kcat compared with spontaneous dismutation. Such genuine, although less reactive, SOD mimics would be inadvertently evaluated by the direct method of kinetics analysis as being inactive (29Weiss R.H. Flickinger A.G. Rivers W.J. Hardy M.M. Aston K.W. Ryan U.S. Riley D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23049-23054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of the nitroxide kcat with the rate constant of the spontaneous decay of superoxide at pH 7.8 or 8.1 readily explains the previous failure to detect SOD mimic activity of nitroxides (29Weiss R.H. Flickinger A.G. Rivers W.J. Hardy M.M. Aston K.W. Ryan U.S. Riley D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23049-23054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With the relatively high initial [O2−˙] used in the rapid mixing stopped flow technique, the conditions for Expression VI was not met, and there was no possibility to detect any effect of nitroxide on superoxide decay (29Weiss R.H. Flickinger A.G. Rivers W.J. Hardy M.M. Aston K.W. Ryan U.S. Riley D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23049-23054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Had this assay been conducted at lower pH, such as pH7, the nitroxide catalytic activity would have been detected. Although the steady state concentration of O2−˙in biological systems is indeed low, cellular SOD or any scavenger has to cope with a continuous flux of the radical. A valid discrimination of a catalyst from a stoichiometric scavenger requires that the concentration of the scavenger/catalyst, exposed to O2−˙flux, would remain time-invariant upon exposure to O2−˙flux for a period of Δt such that[scavenger]0< flux ⋅ΔtEXPRESSION VIII the conditions for Expression VIII is met for nitroxides where 10 μM TPO (or TPL) persisted over 50 min under O2−˙ flux of ~16 μM·min−1 (Fig. 3), thus substantiating the identification of TPL and TPO as genuine catalysts. Because ·OOH/H2O2 redox couple has a midpoint potential of 1.06 V versus normal hydrogen electrode (39Sawyer D.T. Valentine J.S. Acc. Chem. Res. 1981; 14: 393-400Crossref Scopus (1203) Google Scholar), SOD mimics capable of catalytic dismutation of superoxide by utilizing a primary oxidation step should have a reversible electrochemical behavior in the same potential region. Electrochemical studies of stable nitroxides show that both TPO and TPL exhibit a reversible one-electron oxidation corresponding to the nitroxide/oxo-ammonium cation redox couple (28Krishna M.C. Graham D.A. Samuni A. Mitchell J.B. Russo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5537-5541Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The midpoint potentials for TPO (722 mV versus normal hydrogen electrode) and TPL (810 mV versus normal hydrogen electrode) indicate that they can be oxidized by ·HO2. The oxo-ammonium cation, on the other hand, has been shown to be reduced to the nitroxide by O2−˙at diffusion controlled rates (40Korcherginski N. Swartz H.M. Korcherginski N. Swartz H.M. Nitroxide Spin Labels. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 27Google Scholar). These considerations substantiate the mechanism depicted by Equations 6 and 7. In the EPR experiment and in the presence of NADH (Fig. 3), the intermediate TPO+ reacts with the two-electron reductant rather than oxidizing another O2−˙radical. The rate constant, kapp(EPR), determined under such conditions (using Expression IV) represents only the first half of the catalytic cycle (Equation 6) rather than the full cycle, i.e. kapp(EPR) equals k6 rather than kcat. Equation 6 is the rate-limiting step in the catalytic dismutation of O2−˙by nitroxide, because the second step (Equation 7) is much faster having k7 = 1.5 × 1010M−1 s−1, as previously reported (40Korcherginski N. Swartz H.M. Korcherginski N. Swartz H.M. Nitroxide Spin Labels. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 27Google Scholar). Because TPO+ does not react with oxygen and because k7≫ k6, kcat = 2k6, Expression VII approaches Expression V. The situation is different in the spectroscopic experiments. Because in the competition reaction of nitroxide with cyt-cIII for superoxide (Fig. 1) both the nitroxide and its oxidized form TPO+ (or TPL+) react with and remove superoxide, the kinetics analysis enables the determination (from Expression II) of kapp, which in fact represents kcat. The values of kcat thus calculated from kapp(EPR) = k6 obtained by EPR through competition versus SOD (Fig. 3) did not exactly match but were comparable with those independently evaluated from the competition against cyt-cIII (Fig. 1), where both the nitroxide and its oxidized form TPO+ (or TPL+) react with and remove superoxide. The final values of kcat at pH 7, determined by averaging the results independently obtained by the optical and EPR assays, are (1.8 ± 0.4) × 106M−1 s−1 and (6.9 ± 2.9) × 105M−1 s−1 for TPO and TPL, respectively. In conclusion, the present results define the limitations of the direct kinetics analysis in evaluating SOD mimics and demonstrate how appropriate application of various assays can validly discriminate between a catalyst and a stoichiometric scavenger. They also show that stable nitroxide radicals are genuine SOD mimics having kcat values that exceed 107M−1 s−1 at pH 6, evidently capable of greatly affecting the O2−˙level in cells and tissues, thus providing effective detoxification measure."

Nck has been identified as one of the so-called adapter proteins, consisting of one Src homology 2 (SH2) 1The abbreviations used are: SH2Src homology 2SH3Src homology 3EGFepidermal growth factorPDGFplatelet-derived growth factorPKAcAMP-dependent protein kinasePAKp21-activated kinaseGSTglutathione S-transferaseGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O(thio)triphosphateaaamino acids. and three Src homology 3 (SH3) domains (1Lehmann J.M.

Adapter proteins are believed to play important roles in coupling activated receptors, particularly protein-tyrosine kinases, to various signaling pathways (2Pawson T. Schlessinger J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 434-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Nck has been shown to be recruited to both the activated EGF and PDGF receptors (3Li W. Hu P. Skolnik E.Y. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5824-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 4Nishimura R. Li W. Kashishian A. Mondino A. Zhou M. Cooper J. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6889-6896Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, there is limited knowledge about the effector proteins that interact with Nck. Overexpression of Nck has been shown to transform mammalian cells, suggesting that it interacts with protein components important for regulation of normal cell growth (3Li W. Hu P. Skolnik E.Y. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5824-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 5Chou M.M. Fajardo E. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5834-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Perhaps related to this phenotype, the binding of Nck through its second SH3 domain to the mammalian Ras exchange factor Son of Sevenless (SOS) has been reported (6Hu Q. Milfay D. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1169-1174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional proteins able to bind with Nck are the IRS-1 protein in insulin-stimulated cells via the Nck SH2 domain (7Lee C.H. Li W. Nishimura R. Zhou M. Batzer A.G. Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Schlessinger J. Skolnik E.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kitamura Y. Yonezawa K. Totty N.F. Gout I. Hara K. Waterfield M.D. Sakaue M. Ogawa W. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Unidentified serine/threonine kinase(s) of ~65-69 kDa have also been reported to associate with the second SH3 domain of Nck both in vitro and in vivo (10Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Nck is rich in potential phosphorylation sites (1Lehmann J.M. Riethmüller G. Johnson J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and it has been observed that Nck becomes phosphorylated on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues in response to activation of a number of growth factor receptors, including those for epidermal growth factor, nerve growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor (3Li W. Hu P. Skolnik E.Y. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5824-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 11Park D. Rhee S.G. Mol. Cell.

Nck is also phosphorylated in response to forskolin and phorbol ester treatment (11Park D. Rhee S.G. Mol. Cell.

The p21-activated kinases (PAKs) were identified as serine/threonine kinases whose activity is regulated by the small GTPases Rac and Cdc42 (13Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z. Lim L.

PAKs appear to initiate the protein kinase cascades leading to activation of the p38 and c-Jun (JNK) kinases (16Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Knaus U.G. Ulevitch R.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

Sells, U. G. Knaus, D. Ambrose, S. Bagrodia, G. M. Bokoch, and J. Chernoff, submitted for publication. 3S. Dharmawardhane, R. H. Daniels, and G. M. Bokoch, submitted for publication. PAKs have been shown to be stimulated by both G protein-coupled receptors (15Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) and growth factor receptors.3 However, the mechanisms involved in this activation have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we describe the specific interaction of Nck with PAK1 both in vitro and in vivo. Stimulation of the PDGF receptor in Swiss 3T3 cells enhances the level of associated Nck and PAK1. We map the site of this interaction to the second SH3 domain of Nck and to the first proline-rich SH3 binding domain of PAK1. PAK1 phosphorylates Nck in vitro on serine/threonine residues, at least some of which are distinct from those phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Nck may thus serve as a means to link PAK1 to activation of tyrosine kinase receptors and additional signaling components. Full-length and isolated SH domains of Nck were generated by polymerase chain reaction using the human nck cDNA as template (1Lehmann J.M. Riethmüller G. Johnson J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and cloned into pGEX-2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for expression as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. The Nck SH3 first domain construct encoded residues 1-68 of Nck; the SH3 second, residues 101-166; SH3 third, residues 191-257; the second plus third SH3 domains, residues 101-257; and the SH2 domain, residues 275-377. These proteins were isolated using glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmacia) and gave essentially single bands on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels, with the exception of GST-full-length Nck (designated GST-Nck), which degraded to yield several smaller fragments. Full-length Nck was cloned in-frame with the hemagglutinin tag into the mammalian expression vector pCGN (22Tanaka M. Herr W. Cell. 1990; 60: 375-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). PAK1 was prepared in pCMV6 with an amino-terminal Myc epitope tag as described in Footnote 2. Point mutations in Pak1 were introduced using a unique site-elimination protocol (23Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Transient expressions in COS-7 cells were performed essentially as described in 16Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Knaus U.G. Ulevitch R.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

Swiss 3T3 and COS-7 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine at 37°C in an atmosphere of 10% CO2. Cells were plated in 100-mm tissue culture dishes and serum-starved for ~16-18 h prior to the start of the experiment. The cells were then treated with or without stimuli as indicated and then rapidly scraped from the dish into ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM sodium vanadate, 50 IU/ml aprotinin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin). In some experiments, cells were lysed in hypotonic buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl, no NaCl) in the absence of Nonidet P-40. After 15 min on ice, the lysates were pelleted for 5 min at 1500 rpm at 4°C and the clarified supernatants removed. Aliquots of cell lysates were incubated with the indicated antibody overnight at 4°C and then with 80 μl of a 1:1 slurry of Protein A or Protein G-Sepharose beads for 45-60 min. Beads were pelleted and washed twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing Nonidet P-40 and once with 1 ml of lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40 and then used for immunoblots. For kinase assays, the beads were washed an additional time with lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40 and then twice with 1 ml of kinase buffer (see below). Kinase assays were performed essentially as described in 15Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar. Washed immunoprecipitates were incubated in a 60-μl volume containing kinase buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol), 5-10 μM ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) and in the presence or absence of 1 μg of Cdc42-GTPγS or Rac1-GTPγS for 20 min at 30°C. Incubations were stopped in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% gels. To assess interactions of PAK1 with GST-Nck fusion proteins, COS-7 cell Nonidet P-40 lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4°C with equivalent amounts (~5 μg) of pure GST fusion protein and then washed as described above prior to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose. Gel electrophoresis, transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotting were performed as described in 24Bokoch G.M. Bickford K. Bohl B.P. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1927-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar. PAKs have a carboxyl-terminal Ser/Thr kinase catalytic domain that is highly conserved in the Ste20-related kinases (12Meisenhelder J. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5843-5856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). In contrast, the amino-terminal regulatory domains of PAKs containing the GTPase binding site are relatively divergent. Studies in our laboratory on the ability of PAK1 to regulate the actin cytoskeleton have indicated the importance of the amino terminus of PAK for interactions with the actin cytoskeleton.2 We therefore initiated experiments to identify proteins that interact with the amino terminus of PAKs. As shown in Fig. 1, we incubated lysates from COS-7 cells that were transiently transfected to overexpress PAK1 with various purified GST fusion protein constructs, washed them, and evaluated binding by immunoblotting. PAK1 did not bind to control GST-coated beads (lane 1) nor to several other GST fusion proteins including the SH3 domains from p120 Ras GAP and the SH2 domain of Nck (data not shown). In contrast, PAK1 bound effectively to full-length Nck (lane 2). Using the same methods, we examined binding to each of the individual SH3 domains of Nck, as well as to a construct encompassing both the second and third SH3 domains. PAK bound to the second SH3 domain but only weakly interacted with the first or third SH3 domains. Binding to the combined second and third SH3 domains was always greater than to the second SH3 domain itself, suggesting that the weak interaction with the SH3 third domain might synergize with the binding to the SH3 second domain. In contrast, the combined second and third Nck SH3 domain constructs bound PAK1 with comparable or slightly greater efficiency than did full-length Nck, indicating there was no additional synergy when the first SH3 domain was also present. PAK1 has two proline-rich motifs in the amino terminus that have the characteristic PXXP (where X indicates a variable amino acid) structure of SH3 binding domains (20Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dolgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1996; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (876) Google Scholar). These consist of the sequences PPAPP (aa 12-16) and PLPPNP (aa 40-45). We prepared peptides encompassing these domains and determined their ability to compete with PAK1 for Nck binding. As shown in Fig. 2, only the peptide (QDKPPAPPMRN) including the first putative SH3 binding site, but not the second (SKPLPPNPEEK), effectively blocked PAK binding to Nck. Both a control peptide from another site in PAK1 rich in proline residues (DATPPPVIAPRPE, aa 182-194) and a peptide derived from an SH3 binding domain on the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (KISPPTPKPRPPRPTPVAPG) were unable to block binding. Similar results were obtained using the peptides in a dot blot assay. The peptide results were confirmed by mutagenesis of proline 13 to alanine in order to disrupt the first SH3 binding motif. This mutation in PAK1 caused at least a 10-fold decrease in Nck binding affinity, as determined by semiquantitative dot blot assays (data not shown). Nck therefore binds, at least partially, through the first amino-terminal SH3 binding motif of PAK1. Interestingly, the amino acid sequence of this site is nearly identical in human PAK2 and mouse PAK3, and mouse PAK3 was recently reported to bind to full-length Nck in vitro (21Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22731-22737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Therefore, we predict that interaction of Nck with all three PAK family kinases may be important for their regulation. In order to determine whether Nck binds to PAK1 in intact cells, we transiently overexpressed Nck in COS-7 cells and then immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies to evaluate the association with endogenous PAK1 (Fig. 3A). We observed that we precipitated a 68-kDa kinase, which autophosphorylated only in the presence of recombinant GTPγS-loaded Rac or Cdc42 (Fig. 3A, first panel). This kinase co-migrated exactly with PAK1 precipitated from the same cells with a specific PAK1 antibody (15Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Identification of this kinase as PAK1 was supported by the fact that we could also directly detect PAK1 in the Nck precipitate by immunoblotting (Fig. 3A, second panel). Conversely, immunoprecipitation with the PAK1 antibody brought down Nck as well (Fig. 3A, third panel). These data indicated that Nck expressed in COS cells interacts with PAK1. We have shown that PAK1 activity is stimulated by PDGF in Swiss 3T3 cells.3 We therefore examined the interactions of endogenous Nck and PAK1 in Swiss 3T3 cells in the presence or absence of PDGF (Fig. 3B). In non-stimulated cells, Nck co-precipitated with a Ser/Thr kinase that co-migrated with endogenous PAK1 and whose activity was stimulated by addition of recombinant Rac- or Cdc42-GTPγS (Fig. 3B, first panel). Again, we also observed that this associated kinase was PAK1 as determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 3B, second panel). We examined lysates from Swiss 3T3 cells after stimulation with PDGF for various times. At all times examined from 0 to 10 min, we observed an association of PAK1 with Nck. This is consistent with the report by Chou and Hanafusa (10Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) that the association of a 68-kDa Ser/Thr kinase with Nck in cells was constitutive. In Fig. 3B, second panel, we show that there is a ~2.5-fold increase (determined by densitometry) in the amount of PAK1 found in the Nck precipitate after treatment with PDGF for 2 min, suggesting that receptor activation increases or stabilizes the binding of these two proteins to each other. In contrast, treatment of the cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which has been reported to stimulate the phosphorylation of Nck (11Park D. Rhee S.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5816-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), did not increase the level of Nck-associated PAK1. We examined whether the interaction of Nck with PAK1 had any functional consequences on PAK1 activity in vitro. Binding of Nck to PAK1 had no direct stimulatory effect on PAK1 catalytic activity nor did it alter the ability of PAK1 to interact with and be stimulated by Rac- or Cdc42-GTPγS (data not shown). However, we found that Nck served as an effective substrate for phosphorylation by recombinant constitutively active GST-PAK1 in vitro (Fig. 4). Full-length Nck was phosphorylated as efficiently by PAK1 as it was by PKA, for which Nck is a known substrate (11Park D. Rhee S.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5816-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated and non-activated wild-type PAK1 itself catalyzed very little phosphorylation of Nck but did phosphorylate when stimulated by Cdc42-GTPγS, suggesting that activation of a PAK1-Nck complex by GTPase results in Nck phosphorylation. We used various GST-Nck fusion proteins to evaluate the regions on Nck that became phosphorylated and observed that PAK1 phosphorylated fragments containing the first SH3 domain (aa 1-68) and the SH2 domain (aa 275-377) of Nck. PAK1 also phosphorylated additional sites in the second and third SH3 domain constructs that were not phosphorylated by PKA. These constructs encompass aa residues 101-166 and 191-257, respectively, of Nck, a region that contains multiple serine and threonine residues. The fusion protein containing both the second and third SH3 domains also includes residues 167-190, and this construct serves as a substrate for both PAK1 and PKA. Thus, the association of an activated PAK1 with Nck catalyzes the phosphorylation of Nck on multiple sites. The significance of these phosphorylations on Nck activity is unknown. In conclusion, the data we have presented here establish the specific interaction of PAK1 with the adapter protein Nck. In intact Swiss 3T3 cells, this interaction is increased by stimulation through the PDGF receptor, suggesting that Nck serves as a means to couple PAK1 activity to PDGF receptor activation. Since Nck has been reported to co-precipitate with the activated PDGF and EGF receptors, it will be of interest to examine whether Nck physically links PAK to such growth factor receptors. We have detected PAK1 in EGF receptor precipitates from A431 cells but have not yet determined if this association is mediated via Nck. 4R. H. Daniels and G. M. Bokoch, unpublished observations. We have shown that the interaction of Nck with PAK1 involves the second SH3 domain on Nck and the first proline-rich SH3 binding motif at the amino terminus of PAK1. In other studies, we have established that this particular PAK1 SH3 binding domain is critical to the activity of PAK1 to stimulate assembly of the actin cytoskeleton.2 Mutations in the PAK1 amino terminus that increase its ability to assemble actin also enhance the affinity of PAK1 for binding Nck.2 These data suggest that the interaction of proteins with SH3 binding domains at the PAK1 amino terminus is a dynamic process that contributes to the regulatory effects of PAK1 on cell function. The role which the Nck-PAK interaction plays in this process remains to be determined in future studies. The editorial assistance of Toni Lestelle is greatly appreciated."

The rate of H2O2 depletion and O2 evolution catalyzed by MbFeIII was enhanced by stable nitroxides such as 4-OH-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidinoxyl (TPL) in a catalytic fashion. The reduction of MbFeIV to MbFeIII was the rate-limiting step. Excess TPL over MbFeIII enhanced catalase-like activity more than 4-fold. During dismutation of H2O2, [TPL] and [MbFeIV] remained constant. NADH caused: (a) inhibition of H2O2 decay; (b) progressive reduction of TPL to its respective hydroxylamine TPL-H; and (c) arrest/inhibition of oxygen evolution or elicit consumption of O2. Following depletion of NADH the evolution of O2 resumed, and the initial concentration of TPL was restored. Kinetic analysis showed that two distinct forms of MbFeIV might be involved in the process. In summary, by shuttling between two oxidation states, namely nitroxide and oxoammonium cation, stable nitroxides enhance the catalase mimic activity of MbFeIII, thus facilitating H2O2 dismutation accompanied by O2 evolution and providing protection against hypervalent heme proteins. The ability of stable nitroxide radicals to detoxify hypervalent heme proteins such as ferrylmyoglobin (MbFeIV) produced in the reaction of metmyoglobin (MbFeIII) and H2O2 was evaluated by monitoring O2 evolution, H2O2 depletion, and redox changes of the heme prosthetic group.

However, oxyMbFeII can undergo oxidation and yield MbFeIII and OO2•¯, which disproportionates to O2 and H2O2 (1Tajima G. Shikama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12603-12606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such reactions were also noted for hemoglobin (2Abugo O.O. Rifkind J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24845-24853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although no catalytic reactions are normally associated with myoglobin, modest peroxidase activity capable of oxidizing a variety of biological substrates has been identified (3Catalano C.E.

The reaction between H2O2 and metmyoglobin has been shown to produce a two-electron oxidation product of myoglobin by a heterolytic cleavage of the O-O bond of the peroxide coordinated to the heme.MbFeIII+H2O2→K1M•bFeIV+H2O•REACTION1M•bFeIV+H2O2→k2MbFeIV+O2·−+2H+REACTION2MbFeIV+H2O2→k3MbFeIII+O·−2+2H+REACTION3 myoglobin diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid electron paramagnetic resonance ferrylmyoglobin or oxoferrylmyoglobin globin radical metmyoglobin 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinoxyl 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinoxyl 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinoxyl oxoammonium cation of TPL 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-hydroxylamine. One oxidation equivalent has been shown to reside on the globin as a transient radical located on an aromatic amino acid residue (3Catalano C.E. Choe Y.S. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10534-10541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Catalano C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9265-9271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second and longer lived oxidizing equivalent was shown to be the oxoferryl complex (6Yonetani T. Schleyer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1974-1979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Chance M. Powers L. Kumar C. Chance B. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1259-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), FeIV=O, which is denoted as FeIV throughout the text. Although the lifetime of the globin radical has been estimated to be in the range of 50-280 ms, the lifetime of the oxoferryl species ranged between minutes and hours (8Choe Y.S. Rao S.I. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 314: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 9Giulivi C. Cadenas E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Both the globin radical and the oxoferryl species are chemically reactive and have access to components in the bulk solution and initiate free radical-mediated reactions that could result in biologic damage (10Tew D. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17880-17886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by chemical oxidation reactions (11Rao S.I. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 803-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Considerable efforts have been made to characterize the globin radical. Although earlier studies suggested the globin radical to be a tyrosine phenoxyl radical (12Davies M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1077: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), recent high resolution EPR-spin trapping studies provide strong evidence to identify the amino acid radical on the globin to be centered on tryptophan (13Gunther M.R. Kelman D.J. Corbett J.T. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16075-16081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The globin radical has been proposed to mediate oxidation, peroxidation, and epoxidation of substrates and induce biologic damage (10Tew D. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17880-17886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kelman D.J. DeGray J.A. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 7458-7463Google Scholar). The oxoferryl moiety on the other hand has also been implicated in oxidation of cellular components and xenobiotics (9Giulivi C. Cadenas E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The decay of the globin radical proceeds through mechanisms that are not conclusively identified. In the absence of other reductants, the ferryl moiety and possibly also the globin radical can oxidize another H2O2 molecule to OO2•¯and consequently yield molecular O2 (Reactions 2 and 3). Reactions of hematin/hydroperoxide to generate alkoxy radicals have been also reported (15Kalyanaraman B. Mottley C. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3855-3858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is, however, no direct evidence for H2O2-induced decay of the globin radical (Equation 2), and an alternative pathway might involve an intramolecular reduction of globin radical to yield the perferrylMb (MbFeV). Whatever is the mechanism of globin radical decay, MbFeIV can be reduced to MbFeIII by reacting with H2O2 (Equation 3):⋅MbFeIV+H2O2→k2MbFeIV+O2−+2H+ REACTION 2 k3MbFeIV+H2O2⤒MbFeIII+O2∓+2H+ REACTION 3 and thereby confer modest peroxidase activity to myoglobin. The biologic significance of MbFeIV, stems from its ability to oxidize critical targets such as unsaturated fatty acids or membrane lipoproteins (4Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Catalano C.E. J. Biol.

Korzekwa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7081-7085Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Classical antioxidants such as thiols and phenolic derivatives can reduce MbFeIV to MbFeIII in a stoichiometric manner (9Giulivi C. Cadenas E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 21Laranjinha J. Almeida L. Madeira V.

Symons M.C.R. Free Rad. Res. 1994; 20: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 24Yamaguchi T. Nakano T. Kimoto E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Free Radical Res. Commun. 1992; 17: 157-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, no detailed studies on the mechanism underlying how the nitroxides increase catalase-like activity have been made. The unique feature of the antioxidative capacity of nitroxides is their catalytic nature. By undergoing 1-electron transfer reactions, nitroxides “shuttle” among three oxidation states, being readily reduced to cyclic hydroxylamines or oxidized to oxoammonium cations, as shown in Scheme 1 for 2,2,6,6,tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TPO). All three forms can be present in the tissues. Earlier studies showed that by flip-flopping between the two forms of the nitroxide/oxoammonium redox pair, nitroxides facilitate superoxide dismutation in a catalytic manner, i.e. they possess superoxide dismutase mimetic activity. The midpoint redox potentials of nitroxide/oxoammonium pair for many nitroxides range between 700 and 900 mV versus normal hydrogen electrode (26Fish J.R. Swarts S.G. Sevilla M.D. Malinski T. J. Phys. Chem. 1988; 92: 3745-3751Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 27Krishna M.C. Grahame D.A. Samuni A. Mitchell J.B. Russo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5537-5541Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In the presence of a 2-electron reductant such as NADH, the oxoammonium cation can be directly reduced to hydroxylamine (27Krishna M.C. Grahame D.A. Samuni A. Mitchell J.B. Russo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5537-5541Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Chemically, the oxoammonium species has also been isolated as an end product in hemoglobin/H2O2-mediated oxidation (24Yamaguchi T. Nakano T. Kimoto E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Several independent studies using whole animals, isolated organs, or cell culture identified nitroxides as capable of inhibiting oxidative biologic damage imposed by diverse types of oxidative insults (28Mitchell J.B.

More recent studies demonstrated the inhibitory effects of nitroxides on oxidant pathways in methyl prednisone-induced apoptosis of thymocytes (33Slater A.F.G. Nobel C.S.I. Maellaro E. Bustamante J. Kimland M. Orrenius S. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms underlying the protective activity of nitroxides have been elucidated, including oxidation of redox-active reduced transition metals (28Mitchell J.B. Samuni A. Krishna M.C.

Bylund-Fellenius A.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11131-11135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present study concentrates on the kinetics and mechanism of the involvement of nitroxides in redox processes mediated by heme proteins, such as Mb. The results demonstrate the catalytic fashion by which nitroxides can facilitate the catalase-like activity of MbFeIV and substantiate the potential role of nitroxides in detoxification of H2O2 and reactive species such as ferryl. Mb (ferric form, horse heart, type III) was purchased from Sigma. The stable nitroxides 4-OH-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TPL), 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (TPA), and TPO were purchased from Aldrich. 4-Dihydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-hydroxylamine (TPL-H) was prepared by catalytic reduction of TPL in ethanolic solution bubbled with H2 over PtO2. Cu,Zn-Superoxide dismutase and NADH were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. H2O2 was obtained from Fisher, and the solution was standardized using an ϵ240 nm of 43.6 M−1·cm−1. O2 evolution was monitored at 25°C using a Gilson 5/6 oxygraph fitted with a Clark electrode. The electrode was calibrated for absolute O2 concentrations by injecting known amounts of H2O2 into the reaction chamber containing 100 units/ml catalase and noting the deflection of the recorder. The reaction mixture in a final volume of 1.8 ml typically contained 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 50 μM DTPA, 5-25 μM MbFeIII, and 0.9-2 mM H2O2. H2O2 levels in the reaction mixture were monitored at 25°C using the iodometric assay (36Hochanadel C.J. J. Phys. Chem. 1952; 56: 587-594Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The oxidation of iodide to I−3 in the presence of ammonium molybdate catalyst in phthalate buffer, pH 4, was monitored at 350 nm using ϵ = 26400 M−1 cm−1. The redox transitions between the various oxidation states of heme in Mb were monitored by uv-visible spectrophotometry using a HP8452A diode array spectrophotometer (Hewlet Packard). EPR measurements were carried out by transferring the reaction mixture to gas-permeable teflon capillary tube (Zeus Industries, Orangeburg, SC) of 0.81-mm inner diameter, 0.38-mm wall thickness, and 15-cm length. Each capillary was folded twice, inserted into a narrow quartz tube that was open at both ends (2.5-mm inner diameter), and then placed in the EPR cavity. EPR parameters were as follows: modulation amplitude, 1 G; time constant, 0.13 s; scan time, 30 min; gain, 2.5 × 103; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; microwave power, 10 mW. Chinese hamster V79 lung fibroblasts were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Cell survival was assessed by clonogenic assay. Stock cultures of exponentially growing cells were trypsinized, rinsed, and plated (7 × 105 cells/dish) into a number of 100-cm2 Petri dishes and incubated 16 h at 37°C prior to use in experimental protocols. Immediately prior to treatment, medium was removed from the plates, the cell monolayer was rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and fresh Ham's F-12 medium without fetal calf serum was added. Cells were exposed to hydrogen peroxide (final concentration, 750 μM) for 1 h in the absence or the presence of TPL (50 μM) and MbFeIII (50 μM). Following treatment, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized, counted, and plated for macroscopic colony formation. For each dose determination, cells were plated into triplicate dishes, and each experiment was repeated a minimum of two times. Plates were incubated 7 days, after which colonies were fixed with methanol/acetic acid (3:1), stained with crystal violet, and counted. Colonies containing >50 cells were scored. Error bars represent S.D. of the mean. The effect of stable nitroxides on the kinetics of MbFeIII reaction with H2O2 was studied by measuring O2 evolution, depletion of H2O2, and redox transitions between various oxidation states of the heme prosthetic group in MbFeIII. All reactions were carried out at 25°C or at room temperature in 50 mM phosphate-buffered solutions, pH 7.4, containing 50 μM DTPA to minimize undesired reactions catalyzed by adventitious transition metal ions. Fig. 1A shows O2 evolution as a function of time at 25°C, in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing MbFeIII and H2O2 in the absence and the presence of 100 μM TPL. A steady rate of O2 evolution was established with addition of 50-fold excess of H2O2 to solutions containing 25 μM MbFeIII. The rate linearly depended on MbFeIII exhibiting a turnover number of 0.15 ± 0.04 min−1 for evolution of O2 catalyzed by MbFeIII. TPL increased the catalase-like activity of MbFeIII in a dose-dependent manner, where a 2-3 fold excess of TPL over MbFeIII enhanced the turnover number about 4-6-fold. This rate persisted until H2O2 was consumed and was not sensitive to the presence of superoxide dismutase (data not shown). The decay of H2O2 concentration as a function of time was monitored by sampling aliquots of the reaction mixture and estimating [H2O2] by the iodometric assay (36Hochanadel C.J. J. Phys. Chem. 1952; 56: 587-594Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1B, the rate of [H2O2] decay in the presence of MbFeIII increased upon the addition of TPL. Comparing the rates of O2 evolution and H2O2 decay yields a ratio of 0.5 ± 0.05, which indicates a 1:2 stoichiometry as anticipated for a genuine catalase-like dismutation reaction of H2O2 (37Stadtman E.R. Berlett B.S. Chock P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Cyanide (1 mM) completely inhibited O2 evolution, and H2O2 depletion mediated by MbFeIII both in the absence and the presence of nitroxide. The rate of H2O2 dismutation depended on the concentrations of Mb, H2O2, and nitroxide. The rate increased linearly with the increase in [MbFeIII]. However, an increase in [H2O2] beyond 10:1 [H2O2]/[MbFeIII] or in [nitroxide] beyond 2:1 [nitroxide]/[MbFeIII] resulted in a slight increase of the rate of dismutation. The enhancing effect of the nitroxide was practically the same over the pH range 5.5-8 (data not shown). Superoxide dismutase had no significant effect on O2 evolution or on H2O2 depletion induced by TPL + Mb under these conditions. The three-electron reduced form of TPL, namely the cyclic amine, did not enhance O2 evolution. The cyclic hydroxylamine TPL-H progressively enhanced oxygen evolution mediated by MbFeIII, concomitant with the hydroxylamine's rapid oxidation to TPL (data not shown). The distribution of the heme iron among its various oxidation states was determined by recording the uv-visible spectra as a function of time and deriving the respective concentrations of MbFeIII and MbFeIV according to Whitburn's algorithms (38Whitburn K.D. Shieh J.J. Sellers R.M. Hoffman M.Z. Taub I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1860-1869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon the addition of a large excess of H2O2, as indicated by the arrow, the absorption spectrum of MbFeIII was replaced by that of MbFeIV, which persisted until H2O2 depletion (Fig. 1C). TPL did not affect the level of MbFeIV; however, TPL enhanced the rate of H2O2 depletion (Fig. 1B) associated with a corresponding restoration of MbFeIII (Fig. 1C). The complete reaction mixture containing MbFeIII, H2O2 and TPL was analyzed for the TPL signal using EPR spectroscopy. In the absence of reducing agent, such as NADH, the nitroxide persisted without any appreciable spin loss throughout the complete MbFeIII-induced dismutation of a large excess of H2O2 (data not shown). No change of the shape of the EPR spectrum, indicative of any spin-spin interaction between TPL and the heme iron, was observed throughout the course of the reaction. The persistence of TPL concentration indicated that it acts catalytically as a self-replenishing reagent in the dismutation of H2O2 with a concomitant O2 evolution. TPL accelerates the catalase-like dismutation of H2O2 in a reaction in which TPL is not consumed in the overall process. Furthermore, there is no stoichiometric relationship between TPL and the quantity of the substrate altered, all of which indicates TPL functions as a true catalyst. The observed stoichiometry of 1:2 between O2 evolution accompanying H2O2 decay mediated by MbFeIII with nitroxide provides further evidence for the genuine catalytic nature of the process. Similar catalytic decomposition facilitated by manganese/bicarbonate has been observed in earlier studies (37Stadtman E.R. Berlett B.S. Chock P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Evidently such catalysis implies a time invariance of the concentration of MbFeIV and of the nitroxide (see Fig. 1). The rate of H2O2 dismutation induced by MbFeIII increased with the increase of either [MbFeIII] and/or [TPL]. Fig. 2A shows that in the presence of excess H2O2 and with constant [MbFeIII] the rate of O2 evolution increased with the increase of [TPL]. However, beyond [TPL]/[MbFeIII] ratio of 2-3, the rate of dismutation increased very little with an increase of [TPL]. A similar result was obtained with various concentrations of MbFeIII. Fig. 2B shows that varying [MbFeIII] while maintaining [TPL]/[MbFeIII] ratio at 4 yielded a straight line. The dependence of the rate of H2O2 decomposition on [TPL] demonstrated a similar behavior, where almost a maximal rate of H2O2 decay is achieved beyond [TPL]/[MbFeIII] = 2-3. The two electron-deficient sites formed in MbFeIII upon reaction with H2O2 are strong oxidants and can potentially oxidize many substrates, including TPL yielding oxoammonium cation TPL+ (25Mehlhorn R.J. Swanson C.E. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1992; 17: 157-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 27Krishna M.C. Grahame D.A. Samuni A. Mitchell J.B. Russo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5537-5541Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In order to test for the intermediacy of TPL+ in facilitating the catalase-like activity of the MbFeIII, the effect of NADH has been studied. Upon the addition of NADH to the oxygraph chamber containing MbFeIII and H2O2, the evolution of oxygen was replaced by O2 consumption in the absence of TPL. The rate of O2 consumption was significantly greater than the original rate of O2 evolution and lasted until all NADH was oxidized; whereupon, O2 evolution was re-established. The effect of NADH on O2 evolution by MbFeIII and H2O2 in the presence of TPL depended on the relative concentrations of TPL and NADH. At [NADH] < [TPL], oxygen evolution fully stopped, and [O2] did not change until NADH was consumed and O2 evolution was resumed (Fig. 3A). However, at higher NADH concentrations as when [NADH] ≫ [TPL], O2 was consumed at a rate comparable with that observed in the absence of nitroxide. This effect was also transient, and with the progressive depletion of NADH, the consumption of oxygen ended, and later evolution of O2 was gradually resumed to the original rate. Successive transient inhibitions of O2 evolution could be demonstrated by fractionated addition of NADH aliquots, and the inhibition duration increased with the increase of [NADH] added (data not shown). Control experiments showed that the two electron oxidation product of NADH, namely NAD+, had no effect on the rate of O2 evolution (data not shown). Upon addition of NADH (200 μM) to a reaction mixture containing H2O2, MbFeIII, and TPL, inhibition in the rate of H2O2 depletion was noted (Fig. 3B). No significant depletion of H2O2 was noted for the first 10 min when NADH (200 μM) was included in the reaction mixture initially (open circles); subsequently H2O2 depletion was reestablished. The addition of NADH (200 μM) 20 min after the initiation of the reaction (open squares) resulted in the inhibition of H2O2 depletion followed by a 20-30% inhibition compared with that observed in the absence of NADH (closed squares). The effect of NADH on the level of TPL was studied by following the intensity of the EPR signal of the nitroxide throughout the course of the reaction in a sample containing MbFeIII and H2O2. Upon the addition of NADH, the TPL level progressively decreased for several minutes, and when NADH was consumed the EPR signal of [TPL] increased, achieving its original level (Fig. 3C). The restoration of EPR signal of TPL paralleled the restoration of the original rate of O2 evolution. The transient decrease of EPR signal resulted from the reduction of TPL to its respective hydroxylamine, TPL-H, as this EPR-silent form was oxidizable to TPL by ferricyanide (27Krishna M.C. Grahame D.A. Samuni A. Mitchell J.B. Russo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5537-5541Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Upon complete consumption of the NADH, the evolution of O2 was resumed, whereas the original level of nitroxide was restored. The oxidation of NADH by the MbFeIII (25 μM) and H2O2 (1 mM) in the presence and the absence of TPL was followed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm, and the results are shown in Fig. 3D. The presence of TPL enhanced the rate of oxidation of NADH. The effect of TPL on the rate of O2 evolution seemed to depend on its direct reaction with the hypervalent iron. To study the kinetics of MbFeIV reaction with TPL, its reduction to MbFeIII was spectrophotometrically followed. MbFeIV was prepared by treating 10 μM MbFeIII with an excess of H2O2 in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7, followed by 500 units/ml catalase to remove unreacted H2O2. In the absence of nitroxide, MbFeIV decayed slowly to MbFeIII; however, TPL facilitated this reduction. To study the reaction kinetics, the change in OD408 nm was monitored and ΔOD = OD∞− ODt was determined, where OD∞ represented the constant absorbance achieved upon completion of the reaction. The decay of ΔOD exhibited a single exponential kinetics irrespective of the nitroxide concentration (see Fig. 4A) even at [TPL] < [MbFeIV], and the first order reaction rate constant kobs was evaluated. The reaction was conducted at various concentrations of TPL, and the dependence of kobs on [TPL], which shows a biphasic character, is presented in Fig. 4. The value of kobs linearly increased with the increase of [TPL]; however, at [TPL] < 100 μM, the dependence exhibited a downward curvature. A similar dependence of kobs on [nitroxide] was obtained when TPL was replaced by TPA or TPO as seen in Fig. 4. The initial step of superoxide dismutation catalyzed by TPL involves the generation of TPL+ and H2O2 (27Krishna M.C. Grahame D.A. Samuni A. Mitchell J.B. Russo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5537-5541Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In order to study the reverse reaction, TPL+ was generated electrochemically and added into an oxygraph chamber containing deaerated, continually stirred, buffered solution of H2O2. An instantaneous evolution of O2 was observed upon the addition of TPL+ (data not shown), which indicates that with large excess of H2O2 the reverse reaction does indeed take place. The protective effect of the combination of MbFeIII and TPL against H2O2 injury to mammalian cells was tested. Chinese hamster V79 cells were exposed to 750 μM H2O2 for 1 h in the absence or the presence of 50 μM MbFeIII or 50 μM TPL alone or their combination, and H2O2 cytotoxicity was assessed (28Mitchell J.B. Samuni A. Krishna M.C. DeGraff W.G. Ahn M.S. Samuni U. Russo A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2802-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 29Mitchell J.B. DeGraff W. Kaufman D. Krishna M.C. Samuni A. Finkelstein E. Ahn M.S. Hahn S.M. Gamson J. Russo A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 289: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Incubation with H2O2 alone caused a 98% loss in cell survival, and modest protection was provided by MbFeIII, which can be associated with its pseudo-peroxidase activity; whereas, TPL alone was without effect. However, the combination of MbFeIII and TPL protected the cells from H2O2 (Fig. 5). The large synergistic activity of TPL on the protective effect of MbFeIII is attributed to the facilitation of H2O2 dismutation. The pseudo-peroxidase activity of heme protein (3Catalano C.E. Choe Y.S. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10534-10541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is known to involve the intermediacy of MbFeIV (6Yonetani T. Schleyer H. J. Biol.

Commun. 1989; 160: 1162-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Therefore, its detoxification is being attempted using a variety of antioxidants (9Giulivi C. Cadenas E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Generally, reagents effective in reducing MbFeIV to MbFeIII operate in a stoichiometric manner. Conversely, nitroxide radicals, which shuttle among three oxidation states can detoxify hypervalent metals in a catalytic fashion. The predominance of MbFeIV over MbFeIII shows that k1≫ k3, thus indicating that the reduction of MbFeIV by H2O2 (Reaction R3) is the rate-limiting step in the catalytic cycle of H2O2 dismutation. The rates of O2 evolution and H2O2 depletion increased about 4-6-fold in the presence of TPL (see Fig. 1, A and B) most likely due to a reduction of MbFeIV by nitroxide,MbFeIV+TPL⤒k4MbFeIII+TPL+ REACTION 4 yielding the oxoammonium cation TPL+, which can oxidize another H2O2 through Reaction R5, H2O2+TPL+⤒k5k−5O2−+TPL+2H+ REACTION 5 or generate O2by oxidizing O2•¯through Reaction R6.O2−+TPL+⤒k6O2+TPL REACTION 6 Considering the values of 1.2 × 108, 3.2 × 105, and 1.5 × 1010M−1 s−1 reported for k5, k−5, and k6 (39Samuni A. Krishna C.M. Mitchell J.B. Collins C.R. Russo A. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1990; 9: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 40Kocherginski N. Swartz H.M. Nitroxide Spin Labels. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995Google Scholar), respectively, the rate of oxygen evolution with an excess of H2O2 would be the same whether TPL+ disappears via Reaction R5 or 6. The higher rate of H2O2 dismutation in the presence of TPL shows that k4≫ k3. The time invariance of the concentrations of MbFeIV and TPL provides direct evidence that both reagents act as true catalysts. The intensity of the EPR signal of TPL did not change during the course of the reaction because the steady state concentration of the oxoammonium cation TPL+ was below detection. Nevertheless, TPL+ was the species mediating the depletion of H2O2 because in the presence of NADH the EPR signal of TPL was lost due to two-electron reduction of TPL+ to the respective cyclic hydroxylamine TPL-H via Reaction R7. NADH+TPL+→k7NAD++TPL−H REACTION 7 In the presence of NADH alone, the evolution of oxygen was replaced by O2 consumption because MbFeIV was reduced via Reaction R8,MbFeIV+NADH⤒k8MbFeIII+H++NAD* REACTION 8 yielding NAD·, which is capable of reducing oxygen to OO2•¯. Even at [NADH] < [H2O2], Reaction R8 prevailed rather than Reaction R3, indicating that k8≫ k3. This conclusion apparently accounts for the observation that upon the addition of NADH the rate of O2 consumption was faster than that of O2 evolution and the finding that even low [NADH] fully blocked O2 evolution in the presence of TPL. In this case, provided that k7·[NADH] > k5·[H2O2], the oxoammonium cation TPL+ is reduced by NADH rather than by H2O2. The situation is different for a vast excess of NADH where k8·[NADH] > k4·[TPL] > k3·[H2O2] and MbFeIV reacts with NADH rather than with TPL or H2O2. Under such conditions the nitroxide does not play any role; whereas NAD· which is formed by MbFeIV reduces molecular oxygen and depletes its level. Scheme 2 displays the processes underlying the heme-induced dismutation of H2O2 in the presence and the absence of nitroxide. Competing with H2O2 for MbFeIV (see Scheme 2), the nitroxide accelerates the replenishment of MbFeIII and consequently the entire cycle of reactions. The combined presence of MbFeIV, H2O2, and nitroxide did not result in any detectable modification of the EPR spectrum of the nitroxide or the absorption spectrum of the heme iron. Nevertheless, the biphasic behavior of the reduction of MbFeIV in the presence of increasing concentration of nitroxides (Fig. 4B) suggests that ferrylmyoglobin exists in two forms, which decay via Reactions 9 and 10. Such behavior was also observed in the reaction between MbFeIV and Trolox (41Giulivi C. Romero F.J. Cadenas E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 299: 302-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). MbFeIV⇌k9k−9MbFeIV* REACTION 9 MbFeIV*⤒k10MbFeIII REACTION 10 According to this mechanism the decay of MbFeIV to MbFeIII is given by rate Equation 1: −dMbFeIVdt=k9k10k−9+k10MbFeIV(Eq.1) In the presence of reductant such as TPL, MbFeIV and MbFeIV* can be reduced through Reactions 4 and 4*, respectively. MbFeIV*+TPL→k4*MbFeIII+TPL+ REACTION 4* Thus, rate Equation 2 is obtained for the decay of MbFeIV. −dMbFeIVdt=kobEMbFeIV=k9k10+k9k4*[TPL]k−9+k10+k4*[TPL]+k4[TPL]MbFeIV(Eq.2) Rate Equation 2 explains the biphasic dependence of the reaction rate constant of the decay of MbFeIV on [nitroxide] as seen in Fig. 4. The spontaneous decay of MbFeIV to MbFeIII in the absence of TPL or any other reductant depends on k9, k−9 and k10. In the absence of TPL, rate Equation 2 reduces to rate Equation 1, where kobs = k9·k10/(k−9+ k10). In the presence of a sufficiently high [TPL], rate Equation 2 reduces to rate Equation 3: −dMbFeIVdt=k9+k4[TPL]MbFeIV(Eq.3) where kobs = k9+ k4·[TPL]. kobs=kg+k4⋅[TPL] According to this model k4, though not k9, depends on the type of reductant reacting with MbFeIV. A linear regression analysis of the experimental points at the linear portion of the biphasic curve seen in Fig. 4 enables the evaluation of k4 for TPL and k9 as 1.6 × 101M−1 s−1 and 1.5·10−2 s−1, respectively. Similarly, analysis of the kinetics of MbFeIV spontaneous decay in the absence of any reductant would allow the evaluation of k−9 and k10. In the case of TPA, as seen in Fig. 4, linearity was not approached for the dependence of kobs on [TPA], which suggests that for this nitroxide the condition k4*·[TPA] > (k−9+ k10) was not met. In the presence of an excess of H2O2 and TPL, the reduction of each MbFeIV to MbFeIII is followed by immediate formation of another MbFeIVvia Reaction R1 and is accompanied by depletion of a H2O2 molecule and evolution of O2. Under such conditions, [MbFeIV] is continuously replenished and the catalytic turnover number should equal kobs. Turnover number = rate of H2O2 decay /MbFeIV=kobs=k9+k4⋅[TPL](Eq. 4) The results displayed in Fig. 2B indicating a turnover number of 0.65 min−1 for O2 with 0.4 mM TPL can be compared with kobs = 1.26 min−1 seen in Fig. 4 for similar experimental conditions. In conclusion, the present results further elucidate the role played by nitroxides in detoxifying hypervalent metals and enhancing the catalase-like activity of heme proteins. It is possible that in addition to the previously recognized modes of nitroxide action, these mechanisms underlie the protective biological activity of nitroxide antioxidants. Furthermore, nitroxides having a wide variety of analogues with different ring structures and substituents, which confer them with differences in charge and redox behavior might be helpful tools in elucidating the redox reactions of hypervalent heme species. In addition, covalent linking of nitroxides to proteins at different sites is feasible (42Liebmann J. Bourg J. Krishna C.M. Glass J. Cook J.A. Life Sci. 1994; 54: 503-509Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and would provide an interesting chemical system to extend the study of the redox reactions between nitroxides and myoglobin."

https://openalex.org/W1981241246,"Cysteine protein (CSP) is a 34 kDa secretory vesicle protein bearing a as well as a palmitoylated cysteine-rich string region used for membrane attachment. Mutation of the CSP gene causes impaired presynaptic neuromuscular transmission in Drosophila melanogaster, implicating CSP as part of the exocytotic protein machinery. The J-domain of CSP shares homology with the universally conserved DnaJ family, a group of proteins that act as co-chaperones with Hsc70 and its homologs. Hsc70 is an abundant neural protein with coupled protein binding and ATPase activities. We have investigated the CSP modulation of Hsc70 ATPase activity. Here we demonstrated that CSP enhances Hsc70 ATPase activity in a dose-dependent manner. CSP activation of Hsc70 was maximal ( approximately 12 times) at 1:1 stoichiometry and above. We show that a J-domain-containing fragment (amino acids 1-82) of CSP is sufficient for the activation of Hsc70. Neither CSP nor the amino-terminal fragment stimulate the activity of the isolated Hsc70 ATPase domain (amino acids 1-386). CSP does not significantly increase the activity of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein, another ATPase required for transport vesicle function. Our results suggest that CSP, a DnaJ family member associated with the secretory vesicle cycle regulates Hsc70 functions. Hsc70 may function within the biochemical pathways of exo- and endocytosis to promote the formation or dissociation of multimeric complexes or to regulate conformational changes."

https://openalex.org/W2021395541,"The complete cDNA sequence for canine ZO-2, a tight junction-specific protein, is presented. A single open reading frame encodes a polypeptide of 1,174 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 132,085 daltons. As noted previously (1), ZO-2 is a member of the membrane associated guanylate kinase-containing (MAGUK) protein family, a family which includes an additional tight junction-associated protein, ZO-1. These proteins contain a region homologous to guanylate kinase, an SH3 domain, and variable numbers of PSD-95/discs-large/ZO-1 (PDZ) domains, shown to be involved in proteinprotein interactions. ZO-2 and ZO-1 contain three PDZ domains in the N-terminal half of the molecule. Between the first and second PDZ domains, ZO-2 displays a basic region (pI 5 10.27) containing 22% arginine residues. Both ZO-1 and ZO-2 have proline-rich C-terminal regions that are not homologous to other MAGUK family members. Sequence analysis of multiple ZO-2 cDNAs reveals a 36-amino acid domain in this C-terminal region present in only some of the cDNAs. Overall, ZO-2 is highly homologous to ZO-1, showing 51% amino acid identity; however, the C-terminal ends of the molecules show only 25% amino acid identity.

These proteins share several conserved regions, including a region homologous to guanylate kinase (GUK),1 an enzyme which converts GMP to GDP, a single src homology (SH3) domain, hypothesized to be involved in protein-protein interactions necessary for signal transduction (18Booker G.W.

As all proteins in this group are associated with the plasma membrane, they have collectively been termed the MAGUK family (membrane-associated guanylate kinase-containing) (24Kim S.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) ZO-1 and ZO-2 are different from other family members but similar to each other in that they display C-terminal acidic and proline-rich regions (1Jesaitis L.A. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 13Willott E. Balda M.S. Fanning A.S. Jameson B. Van Itallie C. Anderson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). ZO-1 also contains an alternatively spliced region, termed the α motif, in the C-terminal region (25Kurihara H. Anderson J.M. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad.Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7075-7079Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 26Balda M.S. Anderson J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C918-C923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The exact function of this splice domain remains unknown. Here we present the complete sequence encoding ZO-2. We find that ZO-2, like ZO-1, contains three N-terminal PDZ domains. ZO-2 displays a basic (pI 5 10.27), arginine-rich domain between PDZ1 and PDZ2, similar to a previously unnoted region in ZO-1. Finally, ZO-2 also contains an alternatively spliced region near the C terminus which we call the β motif. Amino acid (aa) sequence comparison between ZO-2 and ZO-1 indicates a high degree of homology, although divergence at the C termini of the molecules suggests these proteins will have functional differences To extend the cDNA sequence for ZO-2, a hybridization probe corresponding to the 5'-most sequence of the partial ZO-2 cDNA (1) was generated by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides 5'-GCA CGA GAG AGA CGG-3' and 5'-TTC ATC TTC AGG ACT-3'. The resulting 285-bp product was used to rescreen an oriented oligo(dT)-primed Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell cDNA library in Uni-ZAP XR (kindly provided by Marino Zerial). Of ;500,000 plaques analyzed, 10 ZO-2 cDNAs were isolated, the longestof which (pM7.7) was 4.1 kb. Analysis of the 4.1-kb cDNA sequence and the size of mature ZO-2 transcript in Northern blots (about 5.2 kb) indicated that the 4.1-kb clone was not full-length. We then generated an oriented MDCK cDNA library specific for ZO-2 in Uni-ZAP XR (Stratagene). MDCK poly(A)+ RNA was reverse-transcribed with the ZO-2-specific antisense linker-primer 5'-GAG AGA GAG AGA GAG AGA GAA CTA GTC TCG AGG TAG TCA TCG TCA TGG TC-39 containing an XhoI site. This primer was situated approximately 250 bp downstream of the 59 end of the known ZO-2 sequence contained in pM7.7. The cDNA was then ligated with EcoRI adaptors, digested with XhoI, size-fractionated, and ligated into the Uni-ZAP XR vector. The new library was screened with an oligonucleotide containing the sequence 5'-TGG CTG CTG CGC CGG CTC CTC TCG CTG TAC CCG CTG CGG GCA CTT CT-3' end-labeled with [32P]ATP (ICN Pharmaceuticals). This sequence is the complement of a known region of ZO-2 located 5' of the primer used to create the library. Approximately 400,000 plaques were screened, and positive clones were plaque-purified. Inserts were sized by restriction digestion, and the 3' 200 -300 bp were sequenced to positively identify five ZO-2 clones among 28 primary picks. The longest clone was chosen for double-stranded sequencing (Sequenase, United States Biochemical, or Amplicycle, Perkin Elmer). Nucleotide sequences, isoelectric points of various domains, and the overall molecular weight of the protein were analyzed using the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (GCG) software package. Amino acid sequence comparisons to determine the percent identity and the percent similarity (% identity + % conserved substitutions) were done using the default parameters in the GCG GAP alignment program based on the algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch (27Needleman S.B. Wunsch C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 48: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (7865) Google Scholar).

The cDNA was then used for PCR using forward (5'-CCC CCC GCA TTC AAG CCA G-3') and reverse (5'-TGT GTT TTG ATT GGA ACT GCA TAG ATG TC-3') primers from either side of the putative alternatively spliced region (starting at nucleotides 3311 and 3723 of Fig. 1). PCR products were resolved on a 1% agarose gel. The full-length nucleotide and aa sequence of canine ZO-2 is shown in Fig. 1. This sequence contains a single open reading frame coding for a 1,174-aa polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 132,085 daltons, considerably less than the mass of 160 kDa determined by SDS-PAGE (1Jesaitis L.A. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The disparity between the predicted molecular mass and that determined by SDS-PAGE could be due to anomalous electrophoretic migration or to post-translational modifications. A full-length sequence for human gene X104 related to the Friedreich ataxia locus was previously published, but no characterization of the gene product was presented (28Duclos F. Rodius F. Mandel J.-L. Koenig M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 909-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A comparison of the X104 aa sequence to canine ZO-2 indicates a high degree of similarity: the canine and human sequences are 87% identical at the aa level (Table II). The similarity is even greater within the characteristic MAGUK and acidic domains, with 92-100% aa identity. This indicates that the X104 gene product is the human homolog of canine ZO-2.Table II.Amino acid comparison of canine ZO-2 and human X104 Amino acid sequences in indicated domains of canine and human ZO-2 (28) compared by the GCG GAP alignment program based on the algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch (27). % identity (% similarity ϭ identity + % conserved substitutions).Overall87(92)MAGUK domainsPDZ199(100)PDZ299(100)PDZ3100SH397(98)GUK92(96)Acidic domain100Post-acidic68(80)Splice72(86) Open table in a new tab As noted previously (1), ZO-2 is highly homologous to ZO-1, showing an overall aa sequence identity of 51% (Table III). However, as in the comparison of canine and human ZO-2, the similarities between ZO-2 and ZO-1 are greater in the PDZ, SH3, and GUK domains. In addition, both ZO-2 and ZO-1 display acidic regions at the C-terminal end of the GUK domain followed by proline-rich regions. Interestingly, while the acidic domains of ZO-2 and ZO-1 show significant similarity (60% aa identity), the proline-rich, C-terminal regions following the acidic domains are significantly less similar (25% aa identity)Table III.Amino acid sequence comparison of canine ZO–2 and human ZO–1 Amino acid sequences in indicated domains of canine ZO–2 and human ZO–1(13)compared by the GCG GAP alignment program based on the algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch (27). % identity (% similarity = % identity + % conserved substitutions).Overall51 (67)MAGUK domainsPDZ171 (82)PDZ265 (86)PDZ370 (86)SH369 (85)GUK67 (82)Acidic domain60 (71)Post-acidic25 (43)Splice17 (31) Open table in a new tab Fig. 1 indicates there are three potential in-frame start codons for the canine ZO-2 sequence. Several criteria indicate that the third (nucleotide 398) site is used as the start First, the nucleotide sequence surrounding the third site most closely matches the eukaryotic initiation consensus sequence (Fig. 2) (29Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar). In addition, the 100 aa following this start site closely match both the initial aa sequence of human ZO-1 (70% identity, 80%similarity) and the 100 aa following a methionine at position 24 of the human ZO-2 sequence (99% identity, 100%similarity) (28Duclos F. Rodius F. Mandel J.-L. Koenig M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 909-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Finally, the aa sequence generated from upstream of this third canine ZO-2 initiation codon shows no significant homology with corresponding sequences upstream of the human ZO-1 start site or methionine 24 of human ZO-2. The canine ZO-2 sequence shows no initiation codon corresponding to that published for human X104 Fig. 1 indicates the relative positions of three N-terminal PDZ repeats, the SH3 and GUK domains, and an acidic region. This arrangement of domains is similar to that found in ZO-1 (13Willott E. Balda M.S. Fanning A.S. Jameson B. Van Itallie C. Anderson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). We further note that the region between PDZ1 and PDZ2 of canine ZO-2 is rich in arginine residues (22%) and is highly basic, with a pI of 10.27. Although not previously documented, a similar basic region exists in the corresponding region of ZO-1 (12Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Kitani-Yasuda T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 13Willott E. Balda M.S. Fanning A.S. Jameson B. Van Itallie C. Anderson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 also illustrates a 36-aa domain encoded by a 108-bp sequence present in 6 of 10 partial cDNAs from the C-terminal region of canine ZO-2. To confirm that the presence or absence of this sequence resulted from alternatively spliced mRNAs, we designed primers which straddled the 108-bp region and performed RT-PCR using total RNA isolated from MDCK cells. This analysis resulted in two distinct PCR products which ran at the expected sizes (413 and 305 bp; Fig. 3),confirming the presence of at least two unique species of RNA for canine ZO-2. We propose that this alternatively spliced region be called the β motif. It was previously demonstrated that ZO-1 contains an alternatively spliced 80-aa region termed the α motif (25Kurihara H. Anderson J.M. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad.Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7075-7079Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 26Balda M.S. Anderson J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C918-C923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ZO-1 α motif is larger than that of ZO-2, and an aa comparison of the ZO-1 α and ZO-2 β motifs shows little similarity (17% aa identity; Table III). The similarity between the canine and human ZO-2 β domains (72% aa identity) is lower than that found over the entire length of these molecules (87% aa identity), but similar to that found over the postacidic, C-terminal domains (68% aa identity; Table II). The full-length sequence for canine ZO-2 further confirms that this protein is a member of the MAGUK family. Moreover, ZO-2 shows the same distribution of MAGUK domains as ZO-1, and both ZO-1 and ZO-2 contain unique domains not found in other MAGUK family members, including acidic and prolinerich aa sequences (Fig. 4). This indicates that the tight junction contains at least two proteins with a high degree of similarity. A comparison of the canine ZO-2 aa sequence presented here with that from a previously published human gene (X104) related to Friedreich ataxia (28Duclos F. Rodius F. Mandel J.-L. Koenig M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 909-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) indicates that these proteins are homologs. However, several differences in the sequences of the proteins from these two species are apparent. The canine cDNA sequence contains three potential, in-frame start codons. We believe the third ATG is the most likely initiation site basedon 1) the highest degree of similarity to the eukaryotic initiation consensus sequence (Fig. 2) (29Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar) and 2Stevenson B.R Siliciano J.D. Mooseker M.S. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar) a comparison of the aa sequences surrounding the start sites of canine and human ZO-2 and human ZO-1. Surprisingly, we found no match for the published start site of human ZO-2 in our canine sequence. In addition, the canine ZO-2 is 69 aa longer than human ZO-2 based on a best-fit amino acid sequence comparison (GCGGAP), and the 35 aa immediately preceding the termination of human ZO-2 show a lower aa similarity (13%) to the corresponding region of canine ZO-2 than is present over the rest of the molecules. Combined, these results suggest species-dependent divergence of the canine and human ZO-2 sequences. A comparison of the amino acid sequences of canine ZO-2, human ZO-2, and human ZO-1 shows a high degree of similarity between these proteins (Tables II and III). The similarities are particularly high in the characteristic MAGUK domains, suggesting that these domains are functionally important. Of all the MAGUK protein domains, data demonstrating functional relevance have been provided for only the PDZ region.PDZ domains in PSD-95/SAP90 have been shown to bind to the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (20Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar), Shaker-type potassium channels (21Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar) and neuronal type nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) (22Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R.

The PSD-95/SAP90-nNOS interaction appears to be mediated by PDZ domains in each molecule (22). Likewise, PDZPDZ domain interactions are implicated in the binding onNOS to syntrophin, part of the dystrophin protein complex in skeletal muscle (22). The aa sequences of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor and Shaker-type potassium channel responsible for interacting with the PDZ domain have been further clarified as an N-terminal (S/T)XV sequence (20Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar, 21Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). The roles of the SH3 and GUK domains in any of the MAGUK proteins are unknown. The SH3 domain is believed to function in protein-protein interactions related to signal transduction (18Booker G.W. Gout I. Downing A.K. Driscoll P.C. Boyd J. Waterfield M.D. Campbell I.D. cell. 1993; 73: 813-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 19Mayer B.J. Baltimore D. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 8-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), but no data are available yet in this regard for MAGUK family members. The GUK domain may also be involved in signal transduction as well as in tumor suppression (13Willott E. Balda M.S. Fanning A.S. Jameson B. Van Itallie C. Anderson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 14Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 451-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar), but again, no direct information is available. Unlike other MAGUK proteins, both ZO-2 and ZO-1 contain acidic, proline-rich, and alternatively spliced domains at the C-terminal end of the proteins. The similarities between the acidic domains of canine ZO-2, human ZO-2, and human ZO-1 are high (Tables II and III). However, in similar comparisons, the downstream proline-rich aa sequences, including the splice domains, show much lower similarity, suggesting that these regions may play different roles in ZO-1 and ZO-2. Although no data are shown, alternate splicing in the region of the third PDZ domain is described for human ZO-2 (28Duclos F. Rodius F. Mandel J.-L. Koenig M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 909-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Using primers from either side of this putative splice site in the canine ZO-2 sequence, we detected only one product of the expected size and sequence in RT-PCR analysis of total MDCK cell RNA (data not shown). It is possible that the canine and human versions of ZO-2 differ in splicing. The precise roles of the acidic and splice regions remain to be elucidated.

https://openalex.org/W2044959265,"BALB/cJ mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) developed with interleukin (IL)-3 can be stimulated by c-kit ligand (KL) in the presence of IL-10 and IL-1β for sequential immediate and delayed generation of prostaglandin (PG) D2 through utilization of constitutive prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase (PGHS) −1 and induced PGHS-2, respectively (Murakami, M., Matsumoto, R., Austen, K. F., and Arm, J. P. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 22269-22275). We now report that BALB/cJ BMMC stimulated with KL + IL-10 + IL-1β also exhibit the biphasic release of [3H]arachidonic acid with an immediate phase over the first 10 min followed by a delayed phase from 2 to 7 h. The delayed phase of arachidonic acid release and of PGD2 generation was inhibited by heparin, which concomitantly released a phospholipase (PL) A2 from the cells into the supernatant. Both dexamethasone and a type II PLA2 inhibitor, 12-epi-scalaradial, suppressed delayed-phase PGD2 generation at concentrations that did not affect immediate eicosanoid generation. Transcripts for type IIA PLA2, as assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, were progressively induced in BALB/cJ BMMC treated for 2 to 7 h with KL + IL-10 + IL-1β; the induction of these transcripts was down-regulated by 10−6M dexamethasone. The expression of steady-state transcripts and protein for cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) did not change. PGHS-2-dependent delayed-phase PGD2 generation elicited by IgE-dependent activation of BALB/cJ BMMC primed with KL + IL-10 was also accompanied by the induction of type IIA PLA2 transcripts and was suppressed by heparin, with concomitant release of PLA2 into the supernatant. However, both the direct, cytokine-stimulated and the cytokine-primed, IgE-dependent, delayed-phase PGD2 generation occurred in BMMC from C57BL/6J mice, which have a natural disruption of the type IIA PLA2 gene. Thus, kinetic, pharmacologic, and genetic analyses suggest that an inducible, heparin-sensitive PLA2, rather than cPLA2, provides arachidonic acid to concomitantly induced PGHS-2 for delayed-phase PGD2 biosynthesis in activated BMMC. Furthermore, this heparin-sensitive PLA2 likely represents a novel PLA2 or a new function for a known low molecular weight PLA2. BALB/cJ mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) developed with interleukin (IL)-3 can be stimulated by c-kit ligand (KL) in the presence of IL-10 and IL-1β for sequential immediate and delayed generation of prostaglandin (PG) D2 through utilization of constitutive prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase (PGHS) −1 and induced PGHS-2, respectively (Murakami, M., Matsumoto, R., Austen, K. F., and Arm, J. P. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 22269-22275). We now report that BALB/cJ BMMC stimulated with KL + IL-10 + IL-1β also exhibit the biphasic release of [3H]arachidonic acid with an immediate phase over the first 10 min followed by a delayed phase from 2 to 7 h. The delayed phase of arachidonic acid release and of PGD2 generation was inhibited by heparin, which concomitantly released a phospholipase (PL) A2 from the cells into the supernatant. Both dexamethasone and a type II PLA2 inhibitor, 12-epi-scalaradial, suppressed delayed-phase PGD2 generation at concentrations that did not affect immediate eicosanoid generation. Transcripts for type IIA PLA2, as assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, were progressively induced in BALB/cJ BMMC treated for 2 to 7 h with KL + IL-10 + IL-1β; the induction of these transcripts was down-regulated by 10−6M dexamethasone. The expression of steady-state transcripts and protein for cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) did not change. PGHS-2-dependent delayed-phase PGD2 generation elicited by IgE-dependent activation of BALB/cJ BMMC primed with KL + IL-10 was also accompanied by the induction of type IIA PLA2 transcripts and was suppressed by heparin, with concomitant release of PLA2 into the supernatant. However, both the direct, cytokine-stimulated and the cytokine-primed, IgE-dependent, delayed-phase PGD2 generation occurred in BMMC from C57BL/6J mice, which have a natural disruption of the type IIA PLA2 gene. Thus, kinetic, pharmacologic, and genetic analyses suggest that an inducible, heparin-sensitive PLA2, rather than cPLA2, provides arachidonic acid to concomitantly induced PGHS-2 for delayed-phase PGD2 biosynthesis in activated BMMC. Furthermore, this heparin-sensitive PLA2 likely represents a novel PLA2 or a new function for a known low molecular weight PLA2."

V., Jr., Ng, J., Sande, E., Warburton, C., Powell-Braxton, L. M., and Davidson, N. O. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 9887-9890), these animals do not edit apolipoprotein (apo) B mRNA or produce apoB-48. In this study we have performed a detailed analysis of the lipoprotein phenotypic effects of apobec-1 gene disruption that were not examined in the previous study. We first analyzed the plasma lipoproteins in knockout animals with a wild-type genetic background. Although there was no difference in plasma cholesterol between apobec-1−/−, +/−, or +/+ mice, there was a marked (176%) increase in plasma apoB-100, from 1.8 ± 1.2 mg/dl in apobec-1+/+ mice to 2.7 ± 0.6 mg/dl in apobec-1+/− and 5.0 ± 1.4 mg/dl in apobec-1−/− mice. Plasma apoE was similar in these animals. By fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) analysis, there was a significant decrease in plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in apobec-1−/− mice. We further fractionated the plasma lipoproteins into d < 1.006, 1.006-1.02, 1.02-1.05, 1.05-1.08, 1.08-1.10, and 1.10-1.21 g/ml classes, and found a marked (30-40%) reduction in the cholesterol and protein content in the (d 1.08-1.10 and 1.10-1.21) HDL fractions, corroborating the FPLC data. SDS-gel analysis revealed an absence of apoB-48, an increase in apoB-100 in the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) fractions, and a small decrease in apoA-I in the HDL fractions in the apobec-1−/− samples. We next raised the basal plasma apoB levels in the apobec-1−/− animals by cross-breeding them with human apoB transgenic (TgB) mice. The plasma apoB-100 was 3-fold higher in apobec-1−/−/TgB+/− mice (26.6 ± 18.3 mg/dl) than in apobec-1+/+/TgB+/− mice (9.8 ± 3.9 mg/dl, p < 0.05). The apobec-1−/−/TgB+/− mice had a plasma cholesterol levels of 170 ± 28 mg/dl and triglyceride levels of 106 ± 31 mg/dl, which are 80% and 58% higher, respectively, than the corresponding values of 94 ± 21 mg/dl and 67 ± 11 mg/dl in apobec+/+/TgB+/− mice. By FPLC, the apobec-1−/−/TgB+/− animals developed markedly elevated plasma LDL cholesterol (518.5 ± 329.5 μg/ml) that is 373% that of apobec1+/+/TgB+/− mice (139.0 ± 87.0 μg/ml) (p < 0.05). The elevated plasma triglyceride was accounted for mainly by a 97% increase in VLDL triglyceride in the apobec1−/−/TgB+/− mice. We conclude that apobec-1−/− animals have a distinctive lipoprotein phenotype characterized by significant hyperapoB-100 and HDL deficiency in mice with a wild-type genetic background. Furthermore, the abolition of apoB mRNA editing elevates plasma total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in apobec-1−/− animals with a TgB background. Finally, to exclude the possibility that absence of apoB mRNA editing was a secondary effect of chronic Apobec-1 deficiency, we treated apobec-1−/− mice with a replication-defective mouse Apobec-1 adenoviral vector and found that we could acutely restore apoB mRNA editing in the liver.

https://openalex.org/W2165341915,"The β-chain of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), and interleukin-5 (IL-5) receptors functions as a communal receptor subunit and is often referred to as β common (β<sub>c</sub>). Analogous to other shared receptor subunits including gp130 and the IL-2R γ chain, β<sub>c</sub> mediates high affinity binding and signal transduction of all of its ligands. It is not clear, however, how these common receptor subunits can recognize several ligands and indeed whether they exhibit a common binding pocket to accomplish this. We have performed molecular modeling of β<sub>c</sub> based on the known structures of the growth hormone and prolactin receptors and targeted the putative F′-G′ loop for mutagenesis. Substitution of this whole predicted loop region with alanines completely abrogated high affinity binding of GM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-5. Individual alanine substitutions across the loop revealed that a single residue, Tyr<sup>421</sup>, is critical for high affinity binding of GM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-5, whereas alanine substitution of adjacent residues has little or no effect on high affinity binding. Significantly, reintroducing Tyr<sup>421</sup> into the polyalanine-substituted mutant restored high affinity ligand binding of GM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-5, indicating that within this region the tyrosine residue alone is sufficient for high affinity ligand interaction. Functional studies measuring STAT5 activation revealed that alanine substitution of Tyr<sup>421</sup> severely impaired the ability of β<sub>c</sub> to signal. These results show for the first time that a single residue in a shared receptor subunit acts as a binding determinant for different ligands and may have implications for other receptor systems where communal receptor subunits exhibit hydrophobic residues in their putative F′-G′ loops. These results also raise the possibility that a single compound targeted to this region may simultaneously inhibit the binding and function of multiple cytokines."

The GLO1 gene contained an open reading frame with 326 amino acids, and the molecular weight of the gene product (Glo1p) deduced from the DNA sequence was calculated to be 37,207.06. Glyoxalase I activity increased approximately 95-fold when the GLO1 gene was introduced into the yeast cell with a multicopy plasmid, and the resultant transformant showed the increased resistance against methylglyoxal. Since the knockout mutant of the GLO1 gene of haploid strain of S. cerevisiae was still viable, the GLO1 gene was thought to be unnecessary for growth of the yeast. The GLO1 gene was overexpressed in two kinds of glutathione-deficient mutants, γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase-deficient (gsh1−) and glutathione synthetase-deficient (gsh2−), respectively, and the sensitivites to methylglyoxal were compared. The gsh1-deficient mutant, which could not produce glutathione at all, was hypersensitive to methylglyoxal, and overproduction of the Glo1p did not restore the growth arrest caused by exogenously added methylglyoxal. The gsh2-deficient mutant, which accumulates γ-glutamylcysteine (an intermediate of glutathione biosynthesis), was also sensitive to methylglyoxal compared with the isogenic wild type strain, although the growth arrest caused by methylglyoxal was partially restored by overexpression of the GLO1 gene.

https://openalex.org/W1975938982,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae OLE1 gene encodes the Δ-9 fatty acid desaturase, a highly regulated integral membrane enzyme involved in the formation of unsaturated fatty acids from saturated acyl-coenzyme A precursors. The mRNA levels of the OLE1 gene are regulated by at least two independent control systems that respond to nutrient fatty acids. One involves the unsaturated fatty acid repression of OLE1 transcription; the second, described in this report, involves unsaturated fatty acid-responsive changes in the half-life of the OLE1 mRNA. Measurements of OLE1 mRNA half-life indicate that it is a moderately stable species (t1/2 = 10 ± 1.5 min) in cells grown in medium without exogenous fatty acids. Its half-life is drastically reduced (t1/2 < 2.5 min), in a time-dependent manner, following the addition of unsaturated fatty acids to the growth medium. Saturated fatty acids that have previously been shown to increase activation of OLE1 transcription do not regulate its mRNA stability. Inhibition of translation, by the addition of cycloheximide, slows the nucleolytic degradation of the OLE1 mRNA and blocks the unsaturated fatty acid-triggered reduction in its half-life. This suggests an intimate link between the two processes of mRNA decay and protein synthesis. A chimeric mRNA, produced by replacing the upstream activation and fatty acid-regulated regions of the OLE1 promoter with the GAL1 promoter sequences is destabilized by exogenous unsaturated fatty acids. A similar chimera under GAL1 control that replaces the OLE1 mRNA 5′-untranslated region with GAL1 sequences is not regulated by unsaturated fatty acids. These results suggest that the 5′-untranslated region of the OLE1 mRNA contains sequence elements required for fatty acid-triggered destabilization. Disruption of the XRN1 gene, which encodes a 5′→ 3′-exoribonuclease, results in an approximate 4-fold increase in OLE1 mRNA half-life in the absence of fatty acids. Its half-life is reduced when those cells are exposed to unsaturated fatty acids, indicating that the 5′-exoribonuclease encoded by the XRN1 gene is required for the rapid degradation of the OLE1 transcript but is not required for fatty acid-induced destabilization.

HC affected in a similar manner the gating kinetics of all types of muscle AChR, producing briefer openings with normal amplitudes. We postulate that this steroid acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor of the AChR and that its mechanism of action can be interpreted in terms of blocking models. The forward rate constant for the blocking process was also similar for all channel types, indicating that the structural differences between them are not responsible for the effect. The reduction in the channel open time was not dependent on agonist concentration; it was slightly voltage dependent, suggesting that HC binds to a site located inside the membrane that senses the electric field. Recordings at high acetylcholine concentration in the presence of HC showed a reduced number of openings per activation period and the long closed times typically observed in the desensitization phenomenon. In competition studies with the classical open channel blocker QX-222, HC induced an early termination of the burst, suggesting that the two act at different sites. Taken together the results support the existence of specific sites sensed by the membrane field, different from those of open channel blockers and probably located at the lipid-protein interface. From this site(s), glucocorticoids and other hydrophobic noncompetitive inhibitors could allosterically mediate channel blockade. Mechanisms of ion channel blockade by noncompetitive inhibitors of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) have been particularly difficult to elucidate. We have combined here transient expression of embryonic, adult, and a mutated adult muscle AChR associated with a slow channel syndrome (Ohno, K., Hutchinson, D. O., Milone, M., Brengman, J.

Transformation by E1A is mediated at least in part through binding to several cellular proteins, including the three members of the retinoblastoma family of growth inhibitory proteins. We report here the cloning of a novel murine cDNA whose encoded protein interacts with both adenovirus type 5 and type 12 E1A proteins. The novel E1A-interacting protein shares significant sequence homology with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, a family of related proteins that is involved in the proteasome-mediated proteolysis of short-lived proteins. Highest homology was seen with a Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein named UBC9. Importantly, the murine E1A-interacting protein complements a cell cycle defect of a S. cerevisiae mutant which harbors a temperature-sensitive mutation in UBC9. We therefore named this novel E1A-interacting protein mUBC9. We mapped the region of E1A that is required for mUBC9 binding and found that the transformation-relevant conserved region 2 of E1A is required for interaction.

The contribution of segment 487Phe-Ser-Arg-Asp-Arg-Lys492 to ATP binding and pump function has been investigated through the introduction of 11 site-directed amino acid mutations. ATP binding was measured through competitive inhibition of [γ-32P]2′,3′-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)-8-azido-adenosine triphosphate photolabeling of Lys492 or its substitute. Mutations F487S and positional swap F487S/S488F produced pumps that were severely defective in ATP binding (KD > 1 mM), and mutant F487S, together with F487E, exhibited low ATPase activity and low ATP-supported calcium transport and phosphorylation and failed to show CrATP-dependent Ca2+ occlusion. Mutations F487L, R489L, and K492Y were less inhibitory to ATP binding (KD = 8-49 μM) and, together with K492L and R489D/D490R, produced correspondingly smaller changes in ATP-mediated activities. The ATP dependence of ATPase activity of these five mutants showed deviations from the wild-type profile in the low, intermediate, and high concentration ranges, suggesting defects in ATP-dependent conformational changes.

Ca2+-ATPase belongs to a family of cation transport P-type ATPases that are phosphorylated by ATP on an aspartyl residue during the catalytic cycle.

However, some doubt has been cast on the role of Lys492 in ATP binding because derivatization with 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid succinimidyl ester apparently has no effect on ATPase activity (37Stefanova H.I. Mata A.M. East J.M. Gore M.G. Lee A.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The function of Lys492 may be complex, because derivatization with TNP-8N3-ATP partially uncoupled Ca2+ transport from hydrolysis of the tethered nucleotide (32McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21587-21595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cross-linking Lys492 to Arg678 with glutaraldehyde permitted ATP-dependent Ca2+ occlusion but completely blocked Ca2+ release to the lumen (14McIntosh D.B. Ross D.C. Champeil P. Guillain F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6437-6441Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to probe several conserved amino acids and segments for involvement in ATP binding. Defective ATP binding following mutation of Lys515 has been inferred from lowered Ca2+ transport activity (40Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and the role of this residue may be complex because mutation K515A inhibited both ATP- and acetyl phosphate-supported transport (41Maruyama K. Clarke D.M. Fujii J. Inesi G. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13038-13042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Changes to Lys684 in the hinge domain inhibited phosphorylation from both ATP and Pi, although the mutants appeared to bind nucleotides normally as judged from unaltered nucleotide-dependent inhibition of an intramolecular cross-link formed with glutaraldehyde (42Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16157-16164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several other residues tested in the hinge domain were also excluded from playing a crucial role in nucleotide binding (42Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16157-16164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The conserved 601Asp-Pro-Pro-Arg segment is implicated in ATP binding through the lack of ATP protection of the glutaraldehyde cross-link following change D601E and the inhibition of the cross-link itself with change P603G (43MacLennan D.H. Clark D.M. Loo T.W. Skerjanc I.S. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1992; 146: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Lys492 has not previously been altered by mutagenesis, but changing the equivalent residue in the Na+,K+-ATPase either has no effect on ATP binding (measured indirectly through the induction of ouabain binding) or inhibits both ATP and Pi binding, suggesting an indirect and complex role (44Wang K. Farley R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3577-3580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have introduced 11 mutations into the segment 487Phe-Ser-Arg-Asp-Arg-Lys492 to assess the role of this predicted loop in ATP binding and pump function. Phe487 and its distance from Lys492 are highly conserved within the family of P-type ATPases, and Phe487 or its homologue has not been previously mutated in any of the pumps. We introduce a new ATP binding assay based on the specific photolabeling of Lys492 with TNP-8N3-ATP and its inhibition by ATP. The assay overcomes the technical difficulties associated with the measurement of equilibrium binding of nucleotides to mutant and wild-type Ca2+-ATPases expressed in relatively low yield in COS-1 cell microsomes. The results indicate that conserved Phe487 and Lys492, and to a lesser extent Arg489, play a role in binding ATP in a catalytic and a regulatory mode, thereby affecting most, if not all, ATP-dependent and ATP-modulated partial reactions. The segment plays no role in phosphoryl transfer per se and has little influence on the ATP-independent pump cycle. SR vesicles were prepared by the method of Champeil et al. (45Champeil P. Guillain F. Venien F. Gingold M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), with a modification to eliminate phosphorylase (14McIntosh D.B. Ross D.C. Champeil P. Guillain F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6437-6441Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The protein content was measured by absorbance at 280 nm in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate using a conversion factor of 1 absorbance unit/mg of protein, which was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (66Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. The methods used to obtain COS-1 cell microsomes with wild-type or mutated rabbit fast twitch Ca2+-ATPase have previously been described in detail (40Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 42Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

In brief, oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed on a 735-base pair BamHI-SmaI fragment of the Ca2+-ATPase cDNA inserted in the Bluescript vector (Stratagene), and the presence of the desired mutation was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. After religation of the mutated fragment into the correct position in the full-length Ca2+-ATPase cDNA, the entire piece of Ca2+-ATPase cDNA was excised and cloned into vector pMT2 for expression in COS-1 cells. Microsomes containing expressed wild-type or mutant Ca2+-ATPase were prepared by differential centrifugation from cells grown 48-72 h after transfection with the respective cDNA in the pMT2 vector. Control microsomes containing only insignificant amounts of endogenous Ca2+-ATPase and no expressed exogenous Ca2+-ATPase were obtained following mock-transfection with the pMT2 vector without the insert. The exogenous Ca2+-ATPase content of the microsomal fraction was assayed with a specific sandwich ELISA (42Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16157-16164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of Ca2+-ATPase was in the range 100-600 μg/ml for the expressed wild-type and all of the mutants except R491L, which was not expressed, and F487S,S488F, which was poorly expressed. The concentration of total microsomal protein in the preparations was 5-10 mg/ml. Nonradiolabeled TNP-8N3-ATP was synthesized from ATP as described previously (30Seebregts C.J. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2043-2052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). High specific activity [γ-32P]TNP-8N3-ATP was prepared from 8N3-ATP by a modification of our previous procedure (32McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21587-21595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 32Pi exchange reaction was performed for 1 h with 226 nmol of 8N3-ATP and 1-1.5 mCi of 32Pi (Amersham Corp.) in 0.5 ml. The reaction mix was applied to a small column (0.5 × 2 cm) of DE52 in H2O. It was washed with 5 ml of H20 and acidified with 5 ml of 1 mM HCl, and 32Pi and 8N3-ADP were eluted with 7 ml of 10 mM HCl followed by [γ-32P]-8N3-ATP with 10 ml of 30 mM HCl. The fractions containing most of the radioactivity were pooled, neutralized with an aliquot of a 0.8 M Na2CO3/NaHCO3 mixture, and freeze-dried. An aliquot (83 μl) of a mixture of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (1 mg) and 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (2 mg) dissolved in the bicarbonate buffer was added to the nucleotide dissolved in 0.15 ml of H2O, and the reaction was continued for ~4 h at room temperature. The reaction was monitored by thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine cellulose F plates (Merck) using 1 M LiCl as mobile solvent. The reaction mix was applied to a column (0.5 × 4 cm) of DE52 in H2O, and the column was developed with ammonium formate, pH 8.2, as follows: 5 ml of H2O, 10 ml of 0.2 M, 15 ml of 0.5 M, 30 ml of 1 M. The fractions in the latter eluate containing the majority of the radioactivity were pooled (22 ml), passed through a C18-Sep-Pak (Waters) cartridge, and washed with 2 ml of 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7, and then 0.8 ml of H2O, and the nucleotide was eluted with 60% (v/v) acetonitrile. The concentration of organic solvent was lowered substantially by blowing N2 over the solution for approximately 15 minutes, and the nucleotide (30-90 μM) was stored at −20°C. An overall yield of 20-23% of either initial radioactivity (32Pi incorporation into 8N3-ATP was close to 100%) or nucleotide was obtained. An initial specific activity of 1-1.5 × 107 cpm/nmol was found to be convenient. In some cases, the TNP-nucleotide was purified further by HPLC with a Vydac C18 column (0.46 × 25 cm) and Solvent A (10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.0) and linear development with Solvent B (10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, in 60% (v/v) acetonitrile). Irradiations were performed for 1 min in quartz cuvettes using a xenon lamp and toluene filters as described previously (30Seebregts C.J. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2043-2052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The toluene was changed regularly. The standard medium was 25 mM HEPPS/tetramethylammonium hydroxide, pH 8.5, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 20% (w/v) glycerol, TNP-8N3-ATP without or with ATP at concentrations indicated in the figures, and either 5 μg of SR protein/ml (equal to ~20 nM ATPase) or 0.5-5 μg/ml Ca2+-ATPase protein of COS-1 cell microsomes. The pH dependence of the reaction was examined in a similar medium except the buffers were MES (pH 6.0), MOPS (pH 7.0), HEPPS (pH 8.0), and CHES (pH 9.0 and 10.0). An aliquot of solubilizing mix (8 μl of 20% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 5.4 M 2-mercaptoethanol, and a trace of bromphenol blue) was added to the irradiated sample, and 50 μl were taken for Laemmli SDS-PAGE in 7.5% acrylamide for 3-4 h at 4°C. The bottom of the gel (containing the majority of the radioactivity) was cut off, and the remainder was dried. For any individual experiment, the irradiations and electrophoresis were performed in a single day because the adduct formed between the TNP-nucleotide and Lys492 of the protein is unstable, exhibiting a half-life at room temperature of ~9 h (31McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Berman M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5301-5309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Autoradiography was performed with Hyperfilm-MP x-ray film (Amersham). Quantitation was performed with a Packard InstantImager 2024. The radioactivity contained in rectangles of equal area above and below the band of interest was averaged and subtracted from the test value to give the amount of labeling. Ca2+ transport was measured by Millipore filtration and assaying the filters for radioactivity (42Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16157-16164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 908-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Ca2+-activated ATPase activity in the presence of calcium ionophore to prevent back-inhibition by accumulated calcium was measured spectrophotometrically by following the oxidation of NADH at 340 nm (42Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16157-16164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 908-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). CrATP-induced Ca2+ occlusion was measured essentially as described previously (47Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25739-25743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except for the use of a HPLC column with a larger pore size (TSK G 4000 SW, 7.5 × 300 mm, equipped with a guard column). The phosphorylation measurements were performed as described previously (46Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 908-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The samples were acid quenched with 7% trichloroacetic acid, washed by centrifugation in the same acid, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE at pH 6.0. The radioactivity associated with the ATPase protein was quantitated on dried gels using a Packard InstantImager. The TNP-8N3-ATP photolabeling of SR Ca2+-ATPase data and ATP-supported phosphorylation data were fitted to the Hill equationY=Ymax⋅[S]n/(K0.5n+[S]n)(Eq. 1) where Y = relative counts or cpm, Ymax = relative maximal counts or cpm, [S] = ligand concentration, K0.5 = concentration of TNP-8N3-ATP or ATP at which half-maximal labeling or phosphorylation is obtained, and n = Hill coefficient. The mutant labeling data were fitted to the same equation plus a linear component, m·[TNP-8N3-ATP], where m = slope. The data obtained from ATP inhibition of TNP-8N3-ATP photolabeling was fitted to the binding algorithmY={100⋅K0.5(ATP)/(K0.5(ATP)+[ATP])}+offset(Eq. 2) where Y = 100 (counts in the presence of ATP/counts in the absence of ATP), and K0.5 (ATP) = concentration of ATP at half-maximal inhibition. The “true” dissociation constant for ATP binding was obtained from the equationKD(ATP)=K0.5(ATP)/{1+[TNP-8N3-ATP]/K0.5(TNP-8N3-ATP))}(Eq. 3) ATP-driven Ca2+ transport was fitted to the above Hill equation extended to kinetic measurementsv=Vmax⋅Ca2+n/K0.5n+Ca2+n(Eq. 4) The data describing the Ca2+-dependent hydrolysis of the tethered TNP-nucleotide were fitted to a biexponential decay functiony=A1⋅e−kt+A2⋅e−0.04t(Eq. 5) where the value 0.04 min−1, which is the rate constant for the slower phase of hydrolysis, was obtained from the best fit of Ca2+-dependent hydrolysis data of SR Ca2+-ATPase obtained over 15 min (not shown). It has been shown previously that the Ca2+-ATPase in the native SR membrane is labeled by TNP-8N3-ATP at Lys492 with an efficiency such that ~50% of the active ATPase is derivatized per irradiation period (30Seebregts C.J. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2043-2052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Berman M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5301-5309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The main reason for not obtaining a higher efficiency is the production of tight binding photolysis products that compete for the catalytic binding site (30Seebregts C.J. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2043-2052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The KD for binding of nucleotide is 0.3 μM (30Seebregts C.J. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2043-2052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and, at low concentrations of protein, 3 μM is sufficient to obtain maximal specific labeling (31McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Berman M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5301-5309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and present results; see below). Labeling of a control COS-1 cell microsomal preparation (not containing expressed Ca2+-ATPase), an average wild-type preparation (COS-1 cell microsomes containing expressed Ca2+-ATPase), and a mutant K492L preparation (COS-1 cell microsomes containing expressed mutant Ca2+-ATPase) at pH 8.5 is shown in Fig. 1. Since Lys492 is the amino acid that is derivatized with TNP-8N3-ATP, we predicted that mutant K492L would be poorly labeled, if at all, and could serve as an excellent check on the specificity of the photochemical reaction. The reaction of aryl nitrenes with saturated hydrocarbons is an inefficient reaction (50Kotzyba-Hilbert F. Kapfer I. Goeldner M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995; 34: 1296-1312Crossref Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The expressed wild-type Ca2+-ATPase (arrow) is much more strongly labeled at 3 μM TNP-8N3-ATP than any other protein in the preparation, and virtually no labeled bands are observable in the control preparation and that of the mutant at the position corresponding to Ca2+-ATPase. The exogenous Ca2+-ATPase band becomes stronger at higher concentrations of nucleotide, together with the appearance of other weaker bands, which are also seen in the control and mutant preparations. ATP (1 mM) substantially protects against labeling of the wild-type Ca2+-ATPase. The labeling at concentrations of TNP-8N3-ATP below 3 μM is almost exclusively at the catalytic site of the expressed Ca2+-ATPase as demonstrated by the complete lack of labeling of the control and of the mutant K492L. The relatively large amount of extra labeling of the Ca2+-ATPase seen above 3 μM is peculiar to the Ca2+-ATPase expressed in COS-1 cells and will be addressed below. To optimize the conditions for labeling of the Ca2+-ATPase in COS-1 cell microsomes, the pH dependence of the reaction was examined and compared with that of SR membranes (Fig. 2). It has been shown previously that labeling of Lys492 is pH dependent, with a pKa of 7.4, and at pH 6.0, there is virtually no labeling of Lys492, and the small amount of labeling observed is elsewhere on the protein and does not inhibit ATPase activity (30Seebregts C.J. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2043-2052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that the pH dependence of labeling of Ca2+-ATPase expressed in COS-1 cell microsomes is different from that in SR membranes. There is strong background labeling of the COS-1 cell membranes at pH 7 and below. It seems that the amount of nonspecific labeling of the Ca2+-ATPase (as well as other proteins) in the foreign membrane is much more pH dependent than in the natural SR membrane and becomes overwhelming below pH 7.0. It is possible that due to electrostatic differences the TNP-nucleotide partitions more readily into the COS-1 cell microsomal membrane than the SR membrane at acidic pH. Hence, a pH of 8.5 was chosen to provide maximal specific labeling, but as seen above, and will be seen bel"

In addition, site-directed mutagenesis further shows that histidine 236 and aspartic acid 208 are important for enzyme activity. These observations suggest that the catalytical triad motif is also utilized in the active site of MeHNL. This work provides the first functional evidence for use of a catalytic triad by a member of the hydroxynitrile group of enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1966125684,"Heparin is a complex glycosaminoglycan that inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) growth in vitro and in vivo. To define the mechanism by which heparin exerts its antiproliferative effects, we asked whether heparin interferes with the activity of intracellular protein kinase C (PKC). The membrane-associated intracellular PKC activity increased following stimulation of cultured rat SMCs with fetal calf serum and was suppressed by heparin in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Heparin acted through a selective inhibition of the PKC-alpha since preincubation of the cells with a 20-mer phosphorothioate PKC-alpha antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) eliminated the heparin effect. In vivo, following balloon injury of the rat carotid artery, particulate fraction PKC content increased with a time course and to an extent comparable with the observed changes in vitro. Heparin, administered at the time of injury or shortly thereafter, inhibited the activity of the particulate PKC and suppressed the in situ phosphorylation of an 80-kDa myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS), a substrate of PKC. The topical application of the phosphorothioate antisense ODN selectively suppressed the expression of the PKC-alpha isoenzyme in vivo but did not affect injury-induced myointimal proliferation. Topical application of the ODN also eliminated the antiproliferative activity of heparin. These results therefore suggest that heparin might block SMC proliferation by interfering with the PKC pathway through a selective direct inhibition of the PKC-alpha isoenzyme."

A transient assay utilizing embryogenic rice protoplasts has been used to identify cis elements in the promoter of Em that are responsive to both ABA and VP1. These studies showed that a 76-base pair sequence (Region I) from the Em promoter is required for ABA-inducible expression and is involved in VP1 transactivation (3Marcotte W.R.J. Bayley C.C.

Region I contains two elements encompassing the core sequence CACGTG (Em1a and Em1b), and mutations in either Em1a or Em1b drastically reduce the ability of ABA and VP1 to stimulate transcription. Tetramers of a 24-base pair sequence containing either the Em1a or Em1b elements fused to a non-responsive viral promoter can confer ABA and VP1 responsiveness (5Vasil V. Marcotte W.R.J.

Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1511-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).A wheat embryo cDNA expression library was screened for proteins that bind to Region I. A basic leucine zipper protein, EmBP-1, was identified (6Guiltinan M.J. Marcotte W.R.J. Quatrano R.S. Science. 1990; 250: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Using bacterially expressed EmBP-1 and competition experiments in electrophoretic mobility shift assays, it was shown that EmBP-1 recognizes the Em1a and Em1b elements within Region I (6Guiltinan M.J. Marcotte W.R.J. Quatrano R.S. Science. 1990; 250: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Mutations in the CACGTG core of either sequence reduce expression in the transient assay and eliminate EmBP-1 binding. Furthermore, nuclear extracts isolated from embryogenic rice suspension cells treated with ABA have enhanced Region I binding activity compared with nuclear extracts from untreated cells (6Guiltinan M.J. Marcotte W.R.J. Quatrano R.S. Science. 1990; 250: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). This result suggests that enhanced transcription from the Em promoter induced by ABA treatment could be the result of enhanced transcription factor binding to Region I. Recently, recombinant VP1 fusion protein has been shown to enhance the binding of EmBP-1 to Region I in vitro (7Hill A. Nantel A. Rock C.D. Quatrano R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3366-3374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).The goal of this study was to identify factors in nuclear extracts that alter the ability of EmBP-1 to bind to the Em1a element in the Em promoter. We identified an activity in wheat and maize nuclear extracts that enhances binding of recombinant EmBP-1 to Em1a by 80-fold. Fractionation of nuclear extracts led us to identify histone H1 and HMGb as being two factors that can enhance the ability of EmBP-1 to bind to Em1a and account for at least a part of this activity of nuclear extracts. Enhancement of EmBP-1 binding by histone H1 represents a novel activity for this protein.RESULTSBacterially expressed MBP/EmBP-1 fusion protein bound labeled Em1a probe in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 3). Nuclear extracts prepared from mature wheat embryos also bound Em1a probe, forming complexes with mobilities different from that of MBP/EmBP-1 (data not shown). Nuclear extracts containing 450 ng of protein (or less) did not show any protein-DNA complex formation with labeled Em1a probe (Fig. 1, lane 4). However, when 450 ng of nuclear extract was added to DNA binding reactions containing MBP/EmBP-1, an 80-fold increase in DNA binding activity of MBP/EmBP-1 was observed (Fig. 1, compare lanes 3 and 5). We found no differences between nuclear extracts prepared from maize wild type and vp1 mutant embryos in their ability to enhance the binding of EmBP-1 to Em1a (data not shown). We also observed no differences in enhancing activity between extracts prepared from ABA-treated or untreated embryogenic rice suspension cells (data not shown). From these results, we conclude that the enhancement activity observed in nuclear extracts is neither altered by ABA treatment nor can it be attributable solely to the presence of the maize transcriptional activator protein, VP1.In an effort to identify the proteins that are involved in this enhancement activity, we prepared a 2% trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction from wheat embryo nuclear extracts and tested its ability to enhance DNA binding activity. The trichloroacetic acid-soluble protein fraction did not bind Em1a probe alone (Fig. 1, lane 6) but clearly demonstrated enhancing activity (Fig. 1, compare lanes 3 and 7). HMG and histone H1 proteins are present in nuclear extracts at high levels and are soluble in trichloroacetic acid (9Spiker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12007-12013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown).We tested the abilities of highly purified histone H1 and HMG proteins to enhance the DNA binding activity of MBP/EmBP-1. Purified H1 protein (100 ng) stimulated the DNA binding activity of MBP/EmBP-1 up to 80-fold (Fig. 2, compare lanes 2 and 4) when added to a standard DNA binding reaction. Under these conditions, histone H1 alone does not bind the probe (Fig. 2, lane 3). When used at similar concentrations, HMGb also enhanced MBP/EmBP-1 binding (Fig. 2, lane 6). However, addition of a mixture of HMGc and -d at a similar concentration, or purified MBP, did not result in an enhancement (Fig. 2, lanes 8 and 10).Fig. 2The trichloroacetic acid-soluble proteins histone H1 and HMGb enhance the DNA binding activity of MBP/EmBP-1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed using Em1a as a probe.

Fig. 3A shows that enhancement of DNA binding activity by H1 was dependent on the concentrations of poly(dI·dC) or poly(dA·dT), two nonspecific DNA competitors, present in our binding reactions. In the presence of 0.25 μg of poly(dI·dC), histone H1 did not shift the Em1a probe (Fig. 3A, lane 2). However, when histone H1 is added to MBP/EmBP-1, DNA binding activity was stimulated (Fig. 3A, lane 3). If the amount of poly(dI·dC) in the DNA binding reaction was increased to 2 μg, the ability of H1 to enhance DNA binding was significantly reduced (Fig. 3A, lane 5). Poly(dI·dC) had only a marginal effect on the binding activity of MBP/EmBP-1 in the absence of H1, while the enhancement effect caused by H1 was eliminated at high concentrations (2 μg) of this nonspecific competitor (Fig. 3B). At the same concentrations, poly(dA·dT) was equivalent to poly(dI·dC) at competing the enhancement effect (Fig. 3A, lanes 2-5 versus lanes 6-9). In the absence of nonspecific competitor DNA (poly(dI·dC)), as little as 1 ng of purified H1 protein still caused the enhancement effect (Fig. 4). At this concentration of H1, there was approximately a 1:1 stoichiometry of H1 to the Em1a probe in the DNA binding reactions. From these results, we conclude that histone H1 enhances DNA binding activity by interacting nonspecifically with the DNA.Fig. 3Enhancement activity is dependent on the concentration of nonspecific competitor DNA.

Marcotte W.R.J. Quatrano R.S. Science. 1990; 250: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Mutations in the Em1a element within Region I not only reduced ABA-induced expression in a transient assay but prevented binding by the bZIP factor EmBP-1 (6Guiltinan M.J. Marcotte W.R.J. Quatrano R.S. Science. 1990; 250: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). We observed in this study that nuclear extracts from wheat and maize embryos enhanced the DNA binding activity of recombinant EmBP-1 to the ABA-response element in Region I of the Em promoter, i.e. Em1a. At the concentrations used, these nuclear extracts showed no DNA binding activity to Em1a as measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. However, in DNA binding reactions, these extracts were able to enhance (up to 80-fold) the binding of recombinant EmBP-1 to Em1a. Addition of the maize transcriptional activator VP1 to DNA binding reactions, containing various recombinant transcription factors and their target sites (including EmBP-1 and Em1a), resulted in a similar enhancement (7Hill A. Nantel A. Rock C.D. Quatrano R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3366-3374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, we have shown in this study that the enhancement activity of nuclear extracts was not due solely to VP1, since nuclear extracts from vp1 mutant and wild type maize embryos equally enhanced DNA binding activity of EmBP-1.To further characterize this enhancing activity, we showed that a trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction from wheat embryo nuclear extracts retained the ability to stimulate DNA binding activity. This fraction from wheat embryo extracts is enriched for four HMG proteins (a, b, c, and d) and histone H1 (9Spiker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12007-12013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). We obtained highly purified H1 and HMG proteins and tested their abilities to enhance the DNA binding activity of EmBP-1. Both H1 and HMGb proteins enhanced the DNA binding activity of EmBP-1, while a mixture of HMGc and HMGd at a similar concentration had no effect. Hence, at least these two factors can enhance the ability of EmBP-1 to bind to Em1a and account for at least a part of the total enhancement activity found in nuclear extracts. Purified HMG-1 protein from mammalian cells has been demonstrated to enhance the DNA binding activity of progesterone receptors (10Onate S.A. Prendergast P. Wagner J.P. Nissen M. Reeves R. Pettijohn D.E. Edwards D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3376-3391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data confirm this result since HMGb from wheat is equivalent to HMG-1 from mammalian cells (11Grasser K.D. Plant J. 1995; 7: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, the enhancement of a specific DNA binding protein by histone H1 as reported in this study appears to represent a novel activity for H1.In order to determine if H1 was interacting with DNA, we altered the amount of nonspecific competitor DNA in our binding reactions. We have shown that the enhancement effect is eliminated with increasing amounts of poly(dI·dC) in the binding reactions, indicating that the H1 is likely binding to the poly(dI·dC). Since histone H1 has been shown to bind to AT-rich tracts of DNA (12Zlatanova J. Yaneva J. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 10: 239-248Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we compared the abilities of poly(dI·dC) and poly(dA·dT) to compete for enhancement. Poly(dA·dT) and poly(dI·dC) were equal in their ability to compete for enhancement, indicating that H1 interacts with each equally well under our binding conditions. Addition of up to 1 μg of polylysine to DNA binding reactions had no effect on EmBP-1 DNA binding activity (7Hill A. Nantel A. Rock C.D. Quatrano R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3366-3374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This indicates that H1 is 100 times more efficient at enhancement than addition of positively charged peptides to DNA binding reactions. In the absence of nonspecific competitor DNA (poly(dI·dC)), we have shown that as little as 1 ng of H1 still enhanced the DNA binding activity of EmBP-1. At 1 ng of H1, there is approximately a 1:1 ratio of H1 to DNA in our binding reactions. Hence, under these conditions we have drastically altered the ratio of H1 to EmBP-1 with no effect on enhancement. This result suggests that H1-induced enhancement probably occurs through H1 interactions with the DNA element Em1a rather than with EmBP-1.Several reports have appeared in the literature describing the phenomena of accessory factors in nuclear extracts enhancing the DNA binding activity of a number of transcription factors (13Granelli-Piperno A. McHugh P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11431-11434Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 14Cavanaugh A.H. Simons S.S.J.

Rauscher F.J.I. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). In several of these reports, the authors simply described an enhancing activity present in nuclear extracts but did not identify specific factors that were responsible for the observed effects. However, a protein (REF-1) has been characterized and shown to mediate enhancement of AP-1 DNA binding activity by modulating the redox potential in the DNA binding reactions (20Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). REF-1-enhancing activity was mimicked by the addition of high concentrations of dithiothreitol to the DNA binding reactions. In our studies, dithiothreitol had no effect on EmBP-1 binding activity (data not shown).How might plant proteins such as histone H1 and HMGb cause an enhancement of DNA binding activity as we have described in this study? In the case of steroid receptors, HMG-1 interacts with DNA and increases DNA flexibility, resulting in enhanced binding by the progesterone receptor (10Onate S.A. Prendergast P. Wagner J.P. Nissen M. Reeves R. Pettijohn D.E. Edwards D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3376-3391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The maize HMGa protein, a homolog of wheat HMGb, also increases DNA flexibility (21Grasser K.D. Krech A.B. Feix G. Plant J. 1994; 6: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This may be the mechanism responsible for our observations, since we have shown that highly purified histone H1 and HMGb proteins from wheat are able to enhance the DNA binding activity of EmBP-1 through their interaction with DNA. It has been proposed that proteins with a high concentration of positive charges on their surface interact with DNA and induce conformational changes in the DNA by neutralizing the negative charges along the phosphodiester backbone (22Crothers D. Science. 1994; 266: 1819-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This theoretical model has been tested by replacing the negatively charged phosphates along one side of a DNA strand with neutral methylphosphonate groups (23Strauss J.K. Maher III, L.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1829-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Neutralizing the negative charges along one side of a DNA molecule induces a bend in the DNA. These observations support the hypothesis that positively charged proteins could interact with DNA and neutralize the phosphodiester backbone in a similar manner, thus inducing a bend in the DNA. According to this model, any protein with a high concentration of positive charges at its surface should interact with DNA, induce a bend, and enhance DNA binding. Wheat histone H1 is a highly positively charged protein (pI 11.6) and could be inducing a bend in Em1a, thus facilitating binding by EmBP-1.Enhancement of the DNA binding activities of specific nuclear proteins, triggered by ABA, could result in an increased rate of transcription from the ABA-regulated Em promoter. The goal of this study was to identify factors in nuclear extracts that enhance the binding activity of proteins that recognize ABA and VP1-responsive elements in the Em promoter. We identified histone H1 and HMGb as factors in nuclear extracts that can enhance binding of EmBP-1 to Em1a. Our results, which indicate for the first time that histone H1 possesses this activity, lend further support to the model that positively charged proteins can drastically affect the DNA binding activity of specific transcription factors. Furthermore, our study points to these chromosomal proteins as potential targets of an ABA-mediated modification, e.g. acetylation (24Wolffe A.P. Pruss D. Cell. 1996; 84: 817-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), that could affect the regulation of Em gene expression.

A basic leucine zipper protein, EmBP-1, was identified (6Guiltinan M.J. Marcotte W.R.J. Quatrano R.S. Science. 1990; 250: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Using bacterially expressed EmBP-1 and competition experiments in electrophoretic mobility shift assays, it was shown that EmBP-1 recognizes the Em1a and Em1b elements within Region I (6Guiltinan M.J. Marcotte W.R.J. Quatrano R.S. Science. 1990; 250: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Mutations in the CACGTG core of either sequence reduce expression in the transient assay and eliminate EmBP-1 binding. Furthermore, nuclear extracts isolated from embryogenic rice suspension cells treated with ABA have enhanced Region I binding activity compared with nuclear extracts from untreated cells (6Guiltinan M.J. Marcotte W.R.J. Quatrano R.S. Science. 1990; 250: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). This result suggests that enhanced transcription from the Em promoter induced by ABA treatment could be the result of enhanced transcription factor binding to Region I. Recently, recombinant VP1 fusion protein has been shown to enhance the binding of EmBP-1 to Region I in vitro (7Hill A. Nantel A. Rock C.D. Quatrano R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3366-3374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).The goal of this study was to identify factors in nuclear extracts that alter the ability of EmBP-1 to bind to the Em1a element in the Em promoter. We identified an activity in wheat and maize nuclear extracts that enhances binding of recombinant EmBP-1 to Em1a by 80-fold. Fractionation of nuclear extracts led us to identify histone H1 and HMGb as being two factors that can enhance the ability of EmBP-1 to bind to Em1a and account for at least a part of this activity of nuclear extracts. Enhancement of EmBP-1 binding by histone H1 represents a novel activity for this protein."

Products of mutant alleles selected to confer temperature-sensitive in vivo function were found to be extremely short-lived at the restrictive but long-lived at the permissive condition. An extragenic suppressor mutation was isolated which increased thermoresistance of a ubc9-1 strain. This suppressor turned out to stabilize the mutated gene product, indicating that the physiological activity of ubc9-1 protein is primarily controlled by conditional proteolysis. The labile ubc9-1 protein appears to be a substrate for ubiquitination, and its turnover was substantially reduced by expression of a ubiquitin derivative that interferes with formation of multi-ubiquitin chains. Stabilization resulted also from competitive inhibition of Ubc4-related ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. Activity of the proteasome complex was crucial to rapid breakdown, whereas vacuolar proteases were dispensable. Thus, the heat-denatured ubc9-1 protein is targeted for proteolysis by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and may serve as a useful tool to further define the process by which a misfolded polypeptide is recognized.

Whereas most cellular proteins are metabolically stable under normal growth conditions, a specific subset exhibits a high rate of turnover. A protein's short half-life allows rapid adjustment of its concentration in response to changes in synthesis. And indeed, many regulatory proteins whose abundance is crucial for their proper in vivo function and certain rate-limiting enzymes are subject to selective degradation. Prominent examples of such short-lived proteins include ornithine decarboxylase, a key enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis (Murakami et al., 38Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S. Igarashi K.

While metabolic instability is an intrinsic and natural property of specific proteins, normally stable polypeptides may be targeted for rapid degradation when their native conformation has been disrupted. Structural damage is frequently caused by external stress like heat or heavy metals. Occasional errors in transcription, translation, or folding will also give rise to abnormal protein variants. Similarly, unassembled subunits of multimeric complexes, such as free ribosomal proteins (Maicas et al., 36Maicas E. Pluthero F.G. Friesen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and misdirected proteins, like those that fail to be exported from the endoplasmic reticulum (Klausner and Sitia, 31Klausner R.D. Sitia R. Cell. 1990; 62: 611-614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), were found to be substrates for proteolytic breakdown. The ubiquitin-proteasome system constitutes a major pathway for the selective degradation of proteins in the nucleus and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells (Ciechanover, 8Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar; Peters, 42Peters J-M. Trend. Biochem.

Cell. 1995; 82: 881-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Substrates of this proteolytic system are modified by the attachment of multiple molecules of ubiquitin, a small and highly conserved protein, prior to their destruction by the 26 S proteasome. The catalytic core of this macromolecular complex is the so-called the 20 S proteasome, a cylindrical particle composed of four rings with each seven protein subunits. This 20 S particle associates with two 19 S cap complexes, presumed regulatory subunits that confer energy dependence and specificity on the larger 26 S proteasome. Lysosomes in mammalian cells or yeast vacuoles, on the other hand, contain numerous proteases that act on proteins delivered by endocytosis or autophagy, a nonselective uptake process observed mainly under conditions of nutritional deprivation. Vacuolar protease activity was shown to be essential for the turnover of several plasma membrane proteins in yeast (Volland et al., 60Volland C. Urban-Grimal D. Géraud G. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J.

A role of these proteases in catabolite inactivation of the cytoplasmic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase is controversial (Schork et al., 49Schork S.M. Bee G. Thumm M. Wolf D.H.

The value of temperature-sensitive mutations (ts) 1The abbreviations used are: tstemperature-sensitiveUbcubiquitin-conjugatingPCRpolymerase chain reaction. in the genetic analysis of cellular processes has been amply demonstrated (see Alberts et al. (2Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson J. Molecular Biology of the Cell. 3rd Ed. Garland, New York1994Google Scholar), Lewin (35Lewin B. Genes V. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994Google Scholar), and Murray and Hunt (39Murray A. Hunt T. The Cell Cycle. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993Google Scholar)). Temperature-sensitive mutations are presumed in most cases to be missense mutations resulting in specific amino acid replacements so that mutant gene products retain their proper structure and function only at relatively low temperatures. Despite their widespread use, the mechanisms underlying the conditional activity of ts mutant proteins have rarely been analyzed. This report describes temperature-sensitive mutations in the UBC9 gene of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Products of ts alleles were found to undergo a temperature-dependent switch in metabolic stability, and experimental evidence suggests that efficient proteolysis accounts for the restricted physiological activity of ts ubc9p derivatives. Analysis of the degradation pathway indicated that breakdown of the thermolabile ubc9-1 protein in vivo is energy-dependent, involves multi-ubiquitination and depends on the integrity of the proteasome, but does not require vacuolar protease activity. temperature-sensitive ubiquitin-conjugating polymerase chain reaction. Yeast Ubc9p is a soluble nuclear protein and belongs to a family of ubiquitin-conjugating (Ubc) enzymes that catalyze the transfer of ubiquitin to cellular substrates (Jentsch, 27Jentsch S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 179-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar; Hershko and Ciechanover, 23Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev.

To date, 13 Ubc proteins have been identified in yeast and homologs are known to exist in other eukaryotic species, including plants and mammals. Sequence conservation and crystallographic studies indicate that in a core domain of about 150 amino acids, all Ubc proteins have a similar overall structure with four α-helices and a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (Cook et al., 9Cook W.J.

Yeast strains YWO90, YWO92, YWO96, YWO98, and YWO100 are isogenic to YWO2 (MATa, his3-Δ200, leu2-3,-112, lys2-801, trp1-1, ura3-52; Seufert et al., 53Seufert W. McGrath J.P. Jentsch S.

Standard protocols (Ausubel et al., 4Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidmann J.J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green and Wiley, New York1994Google Scholar) were followed for growth of yeast cells, lithium acetate transformation, preparation of yeast genomic DNA, and other molecular and genetic techniques. Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue (Stratagene) was used for recombinant DNA work. The yeast UBC9 gene was cloned as a 1.5-kilobase pair XbaI-SspI genomic DNA fragment in plasmids pSE360 (ARS1, CEN4, URA3) and pSE362 (ARS1, CEN4, HIS3) to facilitate further manipulations. These constructs complement a chromosomal deletion of UBC9. Codons 68 and 69 were mutagenized by a dual step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Landt et al., 33Landt O. Grunert H. Hahn U. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar; Sharrocks and Shaw, 55Sharrocks A.D. Shaw P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Flanking primers WS42 (GCGGTATACTAACAAATCGATGAAC) and WS43 (TGAGAATTCTACTAACCAATAGAT) were designed to allow exchange of mutated portions as ClaI-EcoRI fragments (sites are underlined). Two internal primers (WS59: GGTTTTGAIIIATATTCATTTGG and WS60: GTTTTGAAGGIIITTCATTTGG) were used together with WS42 in separate first step reactions (I: inosine). Products were cloned in pSE362-UBC9, and DNA was prepared from a pool of about 3000 E. coli transformants each. Temperature-sensitive alleles ubc9-2 and ubc9-3 were identified by transformation of yeast strain YWO90 (MATa, ubc9-Δ1::TRP1, pSE360-UBC9), plasmid shuffling (Sikorski and Boeke, 57Sikorski R.S. Boeke J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), and replica plating. Internal mutagenic primers WS56 (ACAATAGCTTTAAGTATTTTAAATGAA) and WS65 (TTAGACGCTCCAAATCCAAATGCCCCTGC) were used to construct alleles ubc9-4 and ubc9-5, respectively (altered codons are underlined). For fusion to the GAL1 promoter coding sequences of UBC9 and CDC28 alleles were inserted into plasmid pSE936 (Elledge et al., 13Elledge S.J. Mulligan J.T. Ramer S.W. Spottswood M. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1731-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) between the restriction sites EcoRI and XbaI. These fragments were obtained by PCR amplification with UBC9-specific primers WS38 (GGGAATTCGGAAGCAATATGAGTAG) and WS39 (GCTCTAGAGGGAAAGATGGATTCCC) and CDC28-specific primers WS67 (CTGAATTCGAACATGAGCGGTGAATTAGCA) and WS68 (ATACTAGTGCTTATGATTCTTGGAAGTAGGGG). To replace the active site cysteine residue in Ubc4 by a serine residue, the codon TGT at position 86 was changed to AGC by PCR-mediated mutagenesis. The ubc4-C86S allele was fused to the CUP1 promoter in pRS304 and integrated at the TRP1 locus in strain W9473. For deletion of the PRA1 gene, construct pra1ΔEM::URA3 was used in which the coding sequence between EcoRI (position 645) and MscI (position 1929) has been replaced by the URA3 marker. Yep96 and pUB204 are high copy (2 μ origin) plasmids with a TRP1 selectable marker that express ubiquitin or the dominant negative derivative Ub-K48R;G76A, respectively (Finley et al., 17Finley D.

For induction of these genes that are controlled by the CUP1 promoter, cells were treated with 0.1 mM CuSO4 for 6 h. Yeast strains carrying alleles of UBC9 or CDC28 fused to the GAL1 promoter in pSE936 (Elledge et al., 13Elledge S.J. Mulligan J.T. Ramer S.W. Spottswood M. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1731-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) were grown at 22°C in synthetic complete medium with 2% galactose. Time courses were started by addition of 2% glucose to repress transcription from the GAL1 promoter except for the experiment shown in Fig. 7, where total protein synthesis was inhibited by addition of 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide. Cultures were shifted immediately to 37°C or remained at 22°C, and samples were withdrawn at appropriate intervals. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with cold water, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (0.1% Nonident P-40, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM EDTA, and 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5) with inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, 0.6 mM dimethylaminopurine, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor) and disrupted by vortexing with glass beads. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min, and protein concentration was measured by the Bradford assay. After boiling in sample buffer, 20 μg of total protein per lane was separated on a 12% polyacrylamide-SDS gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter with a semi-dry apparatus. Equal loading and transfer was confirmed by staining the membrane with Ponceau S. After preincubation in 5% non-fat dry milk plus 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline, immunoblots were probed with rabbit antisera against Ubc9p (K4S3) or Cdc28p (kindly provided by Dr. C. Mann, Gif-sur-Yvette, France) at a dilution of 1:1000. Donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Corp.) were used for immunodetection. For production of an antiserum in rabbits, a UBC9 cDNA fragment (Seufert et al., 54Seufert W. Futcher B. Jentsch S. Nature. 1995; 373: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) was inserted into the hexahistidine vector pQE9 (Quiagen). Ubc9p was expressed in the E. coli strain M15 and purified by nickel-chelate chromatography (Quiagen). The UBC9 gene from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme essential for cell viability (Seufert et al., 54Seufert W. Futcher B. Jentsch S. Nature. 1995; 373: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). To study its in vivo function we were interested to generate temperature-sensitive ubc9 alleles. Since a ts mutation in CDC34, another member of the UBC gene family, changes the codon of a conserved proline residue (Ellison et al., 14Ellison K.S. Gwozd T. Prendergast J.A. Paterson M.C. Ellison M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24116-24120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the corresponding and a neighboring codon of UBC9 were subjected to a PCR-mediated random mutagenesis. A pool of mutagenized plasmids was used to transform strain YWO90 that carries a deletion of the chromosomal UBC9 gene and is rescued by a plasmid-borne copy. Following plasmid shuffling (Sikorski and Boeke, 57Sikorski R.S. Boeke J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) transformants were assayed for temperature sensitivity. Two strains were isolated that grew well at 22°C, but failed to grow at 37°C and regained temperature resistance after introducing wild type UBC9. The mutant alleles of these strains were termed ubc9-2 and ubc9-3. DNA sequencing confirmed that the only alterations in these alleles map to the targeted codons. The predicted amino acid changes in the ts proteins are given in Fig. 1 together with the sequence of the previously constructed ts derivative ubc9-1p. These residues are located in a proline-rich turn region within an antiparallel β-sheet structure present in Ubc proteins (Cook et al., 9Cook W.J. Jeffrey L.C. Sullivan M.L. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15116-15121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Cook W.J. Jeffrey L.C. Xu Y. Chau V. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13809-13817Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the course of further experiments we observed that these mutations, which interfere with the in vivo activity of Ubc9p at high temperature, apparently caused a conditional reduction in the abundance of the mutated proteins. To directly compare levels of wild type and mutant Ubc9 proteins at various temperatures, isogenic strains that merely differ in the allele of UBC9 were grown at 22°C, 30°C, or shifted to 37°C for 3 h. Protein extracts were prepared and used for a Western blot analysis with a rabbit antiserum against Ubc9p. Loading of equal amounts of protein was confirmed by reprobing the same blot with antibodies to Cdc28p. As shown in Fig. 2, levels of the ts derivatives of Ubc9p were comparable with the amount of wild type protein at 22°C, significantly lower, however, at 30°C and almost undetectable after a shift to the nonpermissive temperature. In contrast, mRNA levels of the ubc9 alleles were not affected by elevated temperature (not shown) indicating that post-transcriptional events account for the observed loss of ts proteins. We therefore investigated in a next step if differential protein stability is the underlying cause. To assess protein turnover, the coding sequences of wild type and mutant ubc9 alleles were fused to the repressible GAL1 promoter. Strains carrying these constructs were grown in galactose-containing medium to induce expression of these gene products. After promoter shutoff by glucose addition, samples were withdrawn from the cultures at time intervals and levels of Ubc9p, and its mutant derivatives were followed on Western blots. At 22°C all four proteins were essentially stable with half-lives of more than 1 h (Fig. 3). At 37°C, however, the ts proteins ubc9-1p, ubc9-2p, and ubc9-3p were highly unstable with estimated half-lives of 10 min or less. Wild type Ubc9 protein, on the other hand, remained completely stable at 37°C (Fig. 3). Thus, thermosensitive in vivo function correlates with temperature-dependent instability of ubc9 mutant proteins. To further investigate this interrelation, we analyzed the stability of mutant proteins whose defects are temperature-independent. The ubc9-4 protein totally lacks Ubc9 in vivo functions due to a replacement of the presumed active site cysteine residue with alanine. The ubc9-5 protein, in which two potential phosphorylation sites have been mutated (substitution of serine residues 122 and 127 by alanines), exhibits reduced physiological activity at any temperature. Turnover measurements show that ubc9-4 and ubc9-5 proteins are indistinguishable from wild type Ubc9p in their stability at elevated temperature (Fig. 3), indicating that instability does not simply result from replacement of a conserved residue or from functional deficiency but is specific for mutant proteins whose in vivo function is temperature-sensitive.Fig. 3Conditional in vivo degradation of temperature-sensitive ubc9 mutant proteins. In the ubc9-4 allele the codon for cysteine at position 93 (TGT) has been changed to GCT specifying alanine by PCR-based mutagenesis. In the ubc9-5 allele codons for serine at position 122 (TCT) and 127 (TCC) have been changed to GCT and GCC specifying alanine. Wild type UBC9 and the indicated mutant alleles were fused to the GAL1 promoter in plasmid pSE936 (ARS1, CEN4, URA3) and transformed into strain K699. For turnover measurements strains were grown in the presence of galactose at 22°C. Cultures remained at 22°C (left panel) or were shifted to 37°C (right panel), and samples were withdrawn at indicated times after glucose addition to repress the GAL1 promoter. Detection of Ubc9p was done as described in legend to Fig. 2. The chromosomal UBC9 copy in strain K699 gave rise to a constant low level of Ubc9p that is seen in ubc9-1p, ubc9-2p, and ubc9-3p expressing strains at the 40- and 60-min time points at 37°C (right panel, lanes 3 and 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These data raise the possibility that the conditional lethality of strains carrying ubc9 ts alleles is a direct consequence of the temperature-dependent instability of ubc9 mutant proteins. To address this hypothesis a ubc9-1 ts strain was subjected to UV mutagenesis, and revertants were isolated that had regained the ability to grow at 35°C. Revertant strains were further characterized by backcrossing and tetrade dissection. A mutation that we named sub1-1 (for suppression of ubcc9-1 ts) was found to be recessive and to belong to a single locus unlinked to UBC9. Stability measurements showed that the otherwise rapid turnover of ubc9-1 protein at high temperature was significantly slowed down in the thermoresistant sub1-1 strain (Fig. 4). Interestingly, a certain degree of stabilization was observed in all 10 isolates tested and its extent correlated with the variable increase in thermoresistance of distinct revertant strains. Moreover, raising ubc9-1 protein levels by expression from the strong GAL1 promoter also conferred elevated thermoresistance (Fig. 4). These results demonstrate that low in vivo levels of the mutant protein due to temperature-dependent degradation are the primary cause for the thermosensitive viability of the ubc9-1 strain. Recently, a portable domain for heat-inducible protein degradation has been developed. Its successful application confirms that active turnover may abolish the in vivo function of a protein (Dohmen et al., 12Dohmen R.J. Wu P. Varshavsky A. Science. 1994; 263: 1273-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). To see if instability of ts mutant proteins is an exceptional phenomenon restricted to Ubc9p, we analyzed the in vivo half-lives of temperature-sensitive derivatives of the well characterized Cdc28 protein, the major cell cycle regulatory kinase in budding yeast (Reed, 44Reed S.I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 529-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar; Nasmyth, 41Nasmyth K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). To this end, wild type and three ts alleles of CDC28 were cloned and placed under control of the GAL1 promoter. After terminating expression Cdc28 protein levels at the nonpermissive temperature were followed by Western analysis. Wild type Cdc28p was apparently long lived. Its level remained constant during the 90-min time course (Fig. 5). In contrast, a pronounced decrease in abundance of cdc28-4, cdc28-13, and cdc28-1N proteins was observed, indicating that the life span of these temperature-sensitive derivatives is considerably reduced (Fig. 5). It thus appears that metabolic instability is a recurrent property of ts mutant proteins that may contribute to their conditional in vivo function. This view is consistent with recent studies of yeast Sec61p, a component of the protein translocation apparatus in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (Rapoport, 43Rapoport T.A. Science. 1992; 258: 931-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Mutations in Sec61p that render its in vivo function temperature-sensitive were found to reduce Sec61p levels at the nonpermissive condition. Overexpression of Sss1p, which is part of the Sec61p complex, restored normal Sec61p levels as well as thermoresistance of the mutant strain (Esnault et al., 15Esnault Y. Feldheim D. Blondel M. Schekman R. Kepes F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27478-27485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, thermosensitivity of sec61-2 cells was suppressed by inactivation of the Ubc6 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and has been implicated in protein degradation (Sommer and Jentsch, 58Sommer T. Jentsch S. Nature. 1993; 365: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). We were interested in characterizing the pathway that mediates proteolysis of a temperature-sensitive ubc9 mutant protein. Vacuolar proteases in yeast function in turnover of membrane proteins and global protein breakdown during starvation or sporulation. Furthermore, catabolite inactivation of a cytoplasmic enzyme has been reported to involve specific uptake of the substrate and destruction in the vacuole (Chiang and Schekman, 6Chiang H-L. Schekman R. Nature. 1991; 350: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Proteasomes, in contrast, are thought to catalyze the majority of selective proteolysis events in the cytoplasm and nucleus. To define the contribution of these systems, heat-induced degradation of ubc9-1p was analyzed in strains deficient in activities of either the vacuole or the proteasome complex. First, an isogenic pair of strains was constructed by deleting the PRA1 gene in W9490. Since the PRA1-encoded product, proteinase A, is essential for vacuolar zymogen activation, a pra1Δ strain is defective in multiple hydrolytic activities of this organelle (Ammerer et al., 3Ammerer G.

Jones E.W. Van Arsdell J.N. Innis M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2500-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In addition, strain c13-ABYS-86 mutated in two key endopeptidases, proteinase A and B, and two exopeptidases of the vacuole, carboxypeptidase Y and S (Achstetter et al., 1Achstetter T. Emeter O. Ehmann C. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13334-13343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were compared with wild type strain YWO2. Cultures were grown at low temperature in the presence of galactose to induce ubc9-1 transcription that is driven by the GAL1 promoter in these cells. Following glucose addition for promoter shutoff and shift-up to 37°C, samples were harvested and used to determine ubc9-1p levels by Western analysis. Strains with defects in vacuolar proteases apparently retained the full capacity to degrade ubc9-1p, because no reduction in the turnover kinetic could be observed (Fig. 6). Whereas a mutation of PRA1 is sufficient to stabilize several membrane proteins (Volland et al., 60Volland C. Urban-Grimal D. Géraud G. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol.

The rate-limiting step in this process is the transfer of cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it is converted to pregnenolone by the P450 side chain cleavage enzyme. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of changes in [Ca2+]c and of Ang II on intramitochondrial cholesterol distribution. Freshly prepared bovine zona glomerulosa cells were submitted to a cytosolic Ca2+ clamp (600 nM) or stimulated with Ang II (10 nM). Mitochondria were isolated and subfractionated into outer membranes (OM), inner membranes (IM), and contact sites (CS). Cholesterol content was determined by the cholesterol oxidase assay. Stimulation of intact cells with Ca2+ led to a marked decrease in cholesterol content of OM (to 54 ± 24% of controls, n = 5) and to a concomitant increase of cholesterol in CS and IM (to 145 ± 14%, n = 5). When glomerulosa cells were exposed to Ang II, a marked increase of cholesterol in CS occurred (to 172 ± 16% of controls, n = 5). No significant changes were detected in OM cholesterol, suggesting a stimulation of cholesterol supply to the mitochondria in response to Ang II. Cycloheximide specifically and significantly reduced Ca2+-activated cholesterol transfer to CS and IM. In conclusion, our data indicate that one of the main functions of the Ca2+ messenger is to increase cholesterol supply to the P450 side chain cleavage enzyme by enhancing endogenous intermembrane cholesterol transfer to a mitochondrial site containing the enzymes responsible for the initial steps of the steroidogenic cascade.

https://openalex.org/W2092819933,"The regulation of collagen gene expression was studied in culture-activated rat hepatic stellate cells, the fibrogenic effector cell involved in hepatic fibrogenesis. Treatment of cells with a 5-lipoxygenase-specific inhibitor caused a reduction in αI(I) collagen mRNA transcript abundance, which suggested that leukotriene production was involved in maintaining the activated cell's high level of collagen mRNA production. The underlying mechanism involved a decrease in collagen gene transcription. Suppression of gene transcription was localized to an nuclear factor-1 (NF-1) binding domain in the proximal promoter and an AP-2 binding domain adjacent to it. Gel retardation assays demonstrated that an increase in AP-2 binding adjacent to the NF-1 site was likely to be the transmodulator responsible for the suppression of the NF-1-dependent gene expression. The data suggest that post-translational alterations in AP-2 activity are responsible for this unappreciated mechanism of regulating the collagen gene."
https://openalex.org/W1981923156,"The glyphosate-degrading bacterium, Burkholderia caryophilli PG2982, was observed to utilize glyceryl glyphosate as a sole phosphorus source. The hydrolysis of glyceryl glyphosate to glyphosate by a phosphonate ester hydrolase (PEH) was identified as the first metabolic step in the mineralization pathway. This observation provides the first biological role for a phosphonate ester hydrolase activity. Purified PEH enzyme hydrolyzed several phosphonate esters including p-nitrophenyl phenylphosphonate, β-naphthyl phenylphosphonate, and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phenylphosphonate. The purified PEH also hydrolyzed some phosphodiesters including p-nitrophenyl 5′-thymidine monophosphate and p-nitrophenyl phosphorylcholine.

Phosphonate monoester hydrolases capable of hydrolyzing p-nitrophenyl phenylphosphonate are widespread in nature (1Kelly S.J. Butler L.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 66: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), even though phosphonate monoesters are generally considered as xenobiotics. The phosphonate monoester hydrolase activities typically arise from the nonspecific nature of 5′-phosphodiesterases (2Hynie I. Zbarsky S.H. Can. J. Biochem. 1970; 48: 1141-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 3Kelly S.J. Dardinger D.E. Butler L.G.

Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1194-1200Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). No physiological role has been ascribed to the phosphonate monoester hydrolase activities. N-Phosphonomethylglycine (glyphosate) is an herbicide and a potent inhibitor of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase. The glyceryl phosphonate monoester of glyphosate, N-(((2,3-dihydroxypropoxy)hydroxyphosphinyl)methyl)glycine (referred to hereinafter as glyceryl glyphosate; Structure s1), was observed in Monsanto field experiments as less phytotoxic than glyphosate (7Dhingra, O. P., Franz, E., Keyes, G., Loussaert, D. F., Mamer, S., (April 5, 1988) United States Patent 4,735,649.Google Scholar). Radioisotope experiments confirmed that glyceryl glyphosate was adsorbed, translocated and relatively stable in plants. 1S. B. Dotson and G. M. Kishore, unpublished results. Similarly, Escherichia coli cells, which were growth-inhibited by 0.5 mM glyphosate, did not display any growth inhibition in the presence of 5 mM glyceryl glyphosate. These preliminary results suggested that glyceryl glyphosate is not a substrate for the previously described, ubiquitous phosphonate monoester hydrolases (1Kelly S.J. Butler L.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 66: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). An enzyme capable of hydrolyzing the phosphonate ester bond of glyceryl glyphosate would likely be unique among currently described enzymes in this class. As described herein, the glyphosate-degrading bacteria Burkholderia caryophilli PG2982 (8Moore J.K. Braymer H.D. Larson A.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1983; 46: 316-320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was observed to utilize glyceryl glyphosate as a sole phosphorus source.

All buffer components and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phenylphosphonate were from Research Organics. Enzymes for coupled assays and DNA modifying enzymes were from Boehringer Mannheim. All bacteriological media components were obtained from Difco. Oligonucleotides were obtained by custom synthesis from Midland Scientific. Unless otherwise indicated, all other reagents were the highest quality available from Sigma. The p-nitrophenyl phenylphosphonate was purified before use by extraction of contaminating p-nitrophenol into hexane at pH 5.0 (5Liao T.-H. Hsieh J.-C. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and then a stock solution standardized using an extinction coefficient for p-nitrophenol of 18,320 cm−1M−1. Unless otherwise specified, all cationic and anionic buffers were prepared as the Cl− and Na+ salts, respectively. Glyceryl glyphosate prepared as described (7Dhingra, O. P., Franz, E., Keyes, G., Loussaert, D. F., Mamer, S., (April 5, 1988) United States Patent 4,735,649.Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Om P. Dingrha of the Monsanto Agricultural Group. The preparation was determined to be >99% pure by glyphosate analysis and by 31P NMR. The crystalline compound and 100 mM solutions at neutral pH were stable for greater than 1 year. Radioactive glyceryl glyphosate was obtained from DuPont NEN at a specific activity of 52.3 mCi/mmol. The radioactive compound was unstable over 3-4 months and was routinely purified by anion exchange on a MonoQ HR10/10 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated in H2O and then eluted with a 1600-ml gradient of 0-500 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.5. Fractions containing glyceryl glyphosate were identified using an analytical HPLC method (described for enzymatic assays below). The pool of glyceryl glyphosate (still contaminated with glyphosate) was fractionated on the same column a second time with an 80-ml gradient of 0-100 mM triethylamine acetate, pH 5.5. The purified radioactive compound and the stable analog were shown to be identical and >99% pure by 31P NMR, by anion exchange chromatography, and by ion-pair chromatography under several conditions. Cloning and expression were performed in E. coli MM294 (9Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8076) Google Scholar) and JM101 (10Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (11397) Google Scholar). DNA template for sequencing and site-directed mutagenesis was prepared from E. coli strain CJ236 (11Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4538) Google Scholar). Pseudomonas sp. PG2982 has been described (8Moore J.K. Braymer H.D. Larson A.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1983; 46: 316-320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and recently renamed as B. caryophilli PG2982. Phenotypic selection with glyceryl glyphosate for the pehA gene in E. coli was performed using minimal medium containing MOPS salts (12Neidhardt F.C. Block P.L. Smith D.F. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 736-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.05 mM KH2PO4, 100 μg/ml spectinomycin, and 1.5% agarose (Seakem). PG2982 was typically cultured in Dworkin-Foster (DF) minimal salts (13Dworkin M. Foster J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1958; 75: 592-601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the addition of glucose, sodium gluconate, and potassium citrate (each 0.1%) as carbon sources and containing 0.2 mM glyceryl glyphosate or Na2HPO4 as a phosphorus source. A radioactive HPLC assay was routinely used to measure the enzymatic hydrolysis of glyceryl glyphosate. Cells or enzyme were incubated with 100,000 cpm glyceryl [3-14C]glyphosate at 30°C in a total volume of 100 μl. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 100 μl of 0.1 M sodium acetate in ethanol, pH 5.5, and precipitates removed by brief centrifugation in a microcentrifuge. Radioactive reaction products were separated by isocratic elution over 15 min at 1 ml/min on a Synchropac AX100 anion exchange HPLC column (Synchrom) equilibrated in 65 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 5.5. Peaks were quantitated on-line by a Radiomatic FlowOne radioactive detector (Packard Instruments). Glyceryl glyphosate eluted at 4.9 min and glyphosate at 9.7 min, providing base-line separation. The release of glycerol from glyceryl glyphosate was measured using a colorimetric assay, which included 0.5 ml of enzyme and 0.5 ml of reaction mix consisting of 1.5 mMβ-NAD, 0.8 unit of NADH:dye oxireductase, 2 units of glycerol dehydrogenase, 300 mM [NH4]2SO4, 50 mM Bis-Tris propane, pH 9.0, 0.03% Triton X-100, and 0.08 mM p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet. The reaction proceeded with the formation of a red color, which was measured at 492 nm in a Hewlett-Packard diode array spectrophotometer at fixed time intervals. The direct hydrolysis of glyceryl glyphosate to glyphosate was further confirmed using 31P NMR. Purified enzyme was added to 1 ml of 10 mM glyceryl glyphosate in 30% D2O, pH 7.0. The phosphonate ester of glyceryl glyphosate was observed to exhibit a major peak at 13.7 ppm and a minor peak at 12.9 ppm, which reflected the equilibrium ratio of 1- to 2-glyceryl ester. A +7.7 ppm signal was observed for an authentic glyphosate standard under the same pH and ionic strength. Enzyme activity was also followed by monitoring the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phenylphosphonate. Standard assays contained 4 mM p-nitrophenyl phenylphosphonate, 0.5 mM MgCl2, and 20 mM diethanolamine, pH 9.0, in a final volume of 1 ml. Enzymatic activity was followed by continuous spectrophotometric detection at 404 nm. Initial rates were determined by linear regression. Enzyme activity was detected in situ after native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Native PAGE gels were prepared as described (14Hames B.D. Rickwood D. Gel Electrophoresis of Proteins. IRL Press, Oxford1985: 1Google Scholar) using the Tris-glycine discontinuous buffer system of Davis (15Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404Crossref PubMed Scopus (15905) Google Scholar). The proteins were separated on a 7.5% acrylamide gel at 12 mA overnight, with cooling to 4°C, in a Hoeffer model SE600 vertical slab gel apparatus. Alternatively, proteins were separated on a Phastsystem using 10-15% gradient native PAGE gels as described (Phastsystem Applications Manual, Pharmacia). After electrophoresis, the gels were stained for activity by pouring a thin layer of 10 mM Bis-Tris propane, pH 9.0, 100 mM KCl, 25 mMβ-naphthyl phenylphosphonate, and 1% Fast Red. The in vivo expression of the phosphonate ester hydrolase gene in E. coli was detected using a 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phenylphosphonate (XPP) in a histochemical assay. A final concentration of 0.01% XPP from a 10% stock in dimethylformamide was added to the cooled agar medium before pouring the plates. Plates were stored in the dark at 4°C. 3′,5′-Cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activity was assayed essentially as described (16Schilling R.J. Morgan D.R. Kilpatrick B.F. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). DNase activity was determined using the method of Kuntz (17Kunitz M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1950; 33: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Assays contained 0.125 mg of DNA, 0.0125 mg of ethidium bromide, and the change in absorbance monitored at 260 nm over 30 min. Five 10-liter fermentations of PG2982 cells were carried out in DF minimal medium to obtain PEH enzyme for purification. Cells were collected by centrifugation and stored at −20°C until used. All procedures were carried out at 4°C. During the purification, activity assays were based on the release of glycerol from glycerol glyphosate, except during the final purification steps when column fractions were first screened using the pNPP assay. The cells (200 g) were resuspended in 1 liter of 100 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol (Buffer I) and lysed by passing through a Manton-Gaulin at 8,000 p.s.i. three times. The cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 30 min. Protamine sulfate was added to the supernatants to 0.2%, and the precipitated nucleic acids harvested by centrifugation as above. The enzyme activity was found in the pellet and the supernatant. Additional protamine sulfate was added to the supernatant to 0.4% total, and the remaining PEH activity was precipitated. The two protamine sulfate precipitates were combined and resuspended with stirring overnight at 4°C in 10 volumes of 0.5 M KCl in 100 mM Tris, pH 8.0. The suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and the soluble PEH activity recovered in the supernatant. A substantial amount of activity remained in the pellet with the nucleic acids, and therefore the extraction was repeated a second time under identical conditions. The protamine sulfate extract was then brought to 50% [NH4]2SO4 by the addition of a saturated stock solution, and the precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The [NH4]2SO4 pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of Buffer I and dialyzed overnight against two 4-liter changes of 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mM dithiothreitol (dialysis buffer). The dialyzed enzyme was loaded on a Q-Sepharose fast flow anion exchange column (4 × 40 cm) equilibrated in dialysis buffer. The PEH protein eluted toward the end of a 2-liter, 0-500 mM KCl gradient in the same buffer. The fractions containing the highest activity were pooled and PEH precipitated with 50% [NH4]2SO4 as before. The [NH4]2SO4 pellet was then loaded onto a 2.6 × 100-cm Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column equilibrated in 10 mM Tris·Cl, pH 8.0, 50 mM KCl, and 5-ml fractions were collected. The PEH activity eluted just after the void volume, and the fractions containing most of the activity were pooled and loaded onto a FPLC MonoQ anion exchange column. The PEH activity was eluted with a 30-ml 0-500 mM KCl gradient in 10 mM Tris, pH 8.5. The fractions with the highest activity were pooled and rechromatographed on the MonoQ column using a 0-500 mM KCl gradient in 60 ml of 10 mM Tris, pH 8.5. Fractions containing the highest activity were again pooled and further purified using native PAGE as described above but with a preparative 4 mm × 8-cm resolving gel. The PEH activity was assayed by overlaying a solution of 4 mM pNPP in 100 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 100 mM KCl. The assay was stopped by rinsing the gel with H2O as soon as a yellow band appeared. The band displaying the activity was excised, and the PEH protein was electroeluted using a Bio-Rad Mini Protean II electroeluter in 10 mM Tris, 20 mM glycine, pH 8.5. The PEH protein was then brought to 40% ammonium sulfate using a saturated stock solution and loaded on a FPLC alkyl-Superose HR5/5 column equilibrated in 10 mM TAPS, pH 9.0, 40% [NH4]2SO4. The PEH activity eluted in the middle of a 25-ml gradient of 40-0% [NH4]2SO4. Tryptic maps were obtained for both the 66- and 59-kDa polypeptides to compare their similarity and to obtain tryptic fragments for protein sequence analysis. 600 μg of purified PEH protein was subjected to full reduction and alkylation with iodoacetic acid (18L'Italien J.J. Shively J.E. Methods of Protein Microcharacterization. Humana, Clifton, NJ1986: 279Crossref Google Scholar). The 66- and 59-kDa polypeptides were then separated from each other by electrophoresis on a 3-17% acrylamide gradient SDS-PAGE minigel (Jule, Inc.) run at 30 mA. The two polypeptides were visualized by a brief staining (15 min) in 0.3% Coomassie Blue R-250 in H2O, excised, and electroeluted into 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, and 0.1% SDS (Bio-Rad MiniPROTEAN II electroelution chamber). The eluted polypeptides were dialyzed against H2O for 4 h, precipitated with five volumes of ice cold acetone, resuspended in 0.1 M NaOH at 40°C, and then desalted into 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.1 using a Sephadex G-25 column. The polypeptides were digested with trypsin (1:25 wt/wt) overnight at 37°C, and the tryptic peptides were separated by RP-HPLC, using a Brownlee RP-300 Aquapore C8 column developed with a 0-70% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 60 min. Automated Edman degradation chemistry was used for amino acid sequence analysis. A model 470A gas phase sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) was employed for the degradations using the standard sequencer cycle, 03RPTH (19Hunkapiller M.W. Hewick R.M. Dreyer R.J. Hood L.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The respective PTH-derivatives were identified by RP-HPLC analysis in an on-line fashion employing a model 120A PTH analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) fitted with a 2.1-mm (inner diameter). PTH-C18 column (Brownlee). The plasmid pMON9428 was transformed into E. coli W3110 and grown in a 10-liter fermenter in LB broth at 30°C. The culture was induced for 2 h with 50 μg/ml nalidixic acid and then harvested by centrifugation in a Sharples solid bowl centrifuge. The cell pellet was stored at −20°C until use. One kilogram of paste was thawed and resuspended in 3 liters of 100 mM Tris, pH 8.5, and passed twice through a Manton-Gaulin press at 8,000 p.s.i. with cooling to 15°C. The crude extract was obtained after centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 25 min. Protamine sulfate (pH 8.0) was added dropwise to 0.2% with stirring and nucleic acids removed by centrifugation as above. The PEH protein was precipitated by addition of an equal volume of a saturated solution of ammonium sulfate, harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min, resuspended, and dialyzed into anion exchange buffer (AE buffer) including 10 mM Bis-Tris propane, pH 9.0. A portion of the recovered protein (34 g; the remaining 40 g was frozen at −70°C) was overloaded onto a 5 × 30-cm Q-Sepharose FF (Pharmacia) column equilibrated in AE buffer. The column was washed with AE buffer plus 200 mM KCl and the PEH eluted with a 200-750 mM KCl gradient (4 liters). As a final purification, 5.4 g of protein was brought to 5% ammonium sulfate and loaded on a 5 × 20-cm phenyl-Sepharose column equilibrated in 5% ammonium sulfate, 20 mM Bis-Tris propane, pH 9.0. A gradient of 5-0% ammonium sulfate was formed over 2 liters and the PEH activity eluted with an additional 1 liter of 0% ammonium sulfate buffer. The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed extensively against 20 mM Bis-Tris propane, pH 7.0, and 0.5 mM EDTA. The optimum pH for activity was determined using p-nitrophenyl phenylphosphonate as a substrate. A three-buffer system of constant ionic strength (20Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar) was used, which consisted of 0.052 M MES, 0.052 M HEPES, and 0.1 M diethanolamine. The actual pH values after dilution of the buffer with substrate were recorded. Enzyme was preincubated at each pH for 2 min, and then assays were run for 5 min. Assays were stopped by the addition of diethanolamine base to 0.1 M and the absorbance at 404 nm recorded. A second set of 5-min assays was performed after first incubating the enzyme at various pH values for 12 min at 30°C. The trace metal analysis was performed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy. The samples were prepared into acidic aqueous solutions using a low temperature ashing method. About 1 g of sample was weighed and transferred into a quartz boat. The boat was loaded in a vacuum chamber and ashed by oxygen plasma overnight. The ash residues were digested with 1 ml of concentrated nitric acid on a hot plate at about 150°C. The solution was dried slowly under nitrogen purge to reduce contamination problems. The dry residue was dissolved in 1 ml of 5% nitric acid solution. The solution then was measured by a Jarrell-Ash inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy system. Restriction maps, cloning, Southern blots, and other DNA manipulations were performed using standard techniques (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) except when referenced otherwise. Genomic DNA from PG2982 was prepared as described previously (22Klee H.J. Hayford M.B. Kretzmer K.A. Barry G.F. Kishore G.M. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 1187-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and used as a PCR template, for Southern analysis, and for making a genomic library. PCR was used to amplify gene segments between the sequences encoding the N terminus and the T37 tryptic fragment and the T20 and T37 tryptic fragments. The PCR primers were designed using a codon preference table developed for PG2982 genes. 3G. F. Barry and K. Fincher, unpublished data. The PCR primer, ATC GTA/G GAT CAG TGC CGC GCA GAT TTC ATC CCG CAT CTA ATG, was made from the codons predicted from the N-terminal amino acid sequence. A slash indicates an equimolar mixture of two nucleotides at that position. Two PCR primers, GAA/G GAC/T ATC/T TGG CTN CC and GAA/G GAC/T ATC/T TGG TTA/G CC, were made from the T20 tryptic peptide sequence and mixed 2:1, respectively. A single primer, TGG/ACCG/C GTC/T TCA/G TC, was made from the predicted anti-codons for the T37 tryptic fragment sequence. The PCR reactions were performed with a 40°C annealing step using the Taq polymerase under standard conditions (Perkin Elmer). The 450-bp T20-T37 PCR product was used to screen a PG2982 genomic cosmid library essentially as described (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The PG2982 genomic library was prepared from a partial HindIII digest ligated into the HindIII site of cosmid pHC79 (23Hohn B. Collins J. Gene (Amst.). 1980; 11: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) as described previously (22Klee H.J. Hayford M.B. Kretzmer K.A. Barry G.F. Kishore G.M. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 1187-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). 4G. F. Barry and M. Weldon, unpublished data. Colonies that hybridized to the probe on each of the duplicate filters were further screened (confirmed) by PCR using the T20 and T37 primers. Three cosmid clones were selected and cosmid DNA prepared using a rapid alkaline lysis method (25Birnboim H.C. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (9821) Google Scholar). The cosmid DNA was then digested with BglII, BamHI, ClaI, NcoI, HindIII, and EcoRI, and the pehA gene was mapped by Southern analysis (24Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503Crossref PubMed Scopus (21337) Google Scholar) using the 32P-labeled N-terminal-T37 PCR product as a probe. The results were used to partially construct the restriction map in Fig. 3. The 3-kb NcoI and 2.2-kb HindIII fragments containing the pehA gene were ligated into a pUC118-derived vector (modified to contain a NcoI site in the polylinker) and Bluescript pSK (Clontech), respectively. The NcoI and HindIII fragments were mapped using common restriction enzymes and the data combined to produce the restriction map in Fig. 3. Single-stranded DNA template was used to sequence both strands of the entire pehA gene. Single-strand DNA was produced using the M13 helper phage M13KO7 (Bio-Rad) and purified using a standard protocol (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA sequencing utilized the Sequenase 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Initially, the degenerate PCR primers designed from tryptic fragment sequences were used as sequencing primers. As sequence data became available, new primers were synthesized until a complete set of primers were available every 250 bp for both strands, allowing the gene to be completely sequenced on both strands. The primer, GTAAGCCTCGGAAATAAAGATCTCACCATGGCCAGAAAAAATGTCCTG, was used to insert BglII and NcoI recognition sites at the starting methionine of the pehA gene using Kunkel mutagenesis (11Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4538) Google Scholar). A 5′ NcoI-BamHI fragment of the pehA gene was ligated with a BamHI to SalI 3′ fragment into an E. coli expression vector containing the recA promoter and T7 phage gene10 leader (26Olins P.O. Devine C.S. Rangwala S.H. Kavka K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and the resulting plasmid designated pMON9428. The primer TTGCTCCTGAGCTCAATGGTTGC was used to insert a SacI site just 3′ to the predicted stop codon. To facilitate further cloning, the primers GAAACGCGGATCTCTTGCAGAGGT, ATACGGAAGCTCTCGGCATTGTA, GAGCCTTCCGCCCATGAAAGAACGAGCC, and CAGATTGCTGAACTCATGCGGGTC were used to remove internal BamHI, HindIII, NcoI, and EcoRI sites, respectively. After mutagenesis, the pehA gene resided on a NcoI-SacI fragment cloned into pBluescript SK(+) and was designated pMON9432. The pehA gene was then resequenced with the deoxyinosine reagent set (Sequenase 2.0 kit) to confirm correct mutageneses and activity was verified in E. coli. The 3′-noncoding sequence between the newly introduced SacI site and a vector SacI site was removed from pMON9432 yielding pMON9434, and pehA activity was again confirmed in E. coli by the in situ hydrolysis of XPP. All nucleic acid sequences were analyzed on a VAX using the GCG sequence analysis programs (27Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (67530) Google Scholar). Data base searches were performed using the BLAST algorithm against the non-redundant sequence data bases at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (28Fitzgibbon J. Braymer H.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1988; 54: 1886-1888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme kinetic data were analyzed using the ENZFITTER program (29Leatherbarrow R.J. ENZFITTER. Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, U. K1992Google Scholar). B. caryophilli PG2982 has been previously characterized for its ability to utilize glyphosate as a sole phosphorus source (8Moore J.K. Braymer H.D. Larson A.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1983; 46: 316-320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, PG2982 was observed to utilize glyceryl glyphosate as a sole phosphorus source, suggesting the presence of a phosphonate monoester hydrolase activity. The glyceryl glyphosate phosphonate esterase activity was confirmed by directly demonstrating the conversion of glyceryl glyphosate to glyphosate using in vivo and in vitro radioactive assays. Intact PG2982 cells and crude extracts were incubated with glyceryl [3-14C]glyphosate and the products identified by HPLC anion exchange chromatography. The only radioactively labeled specie formed from glyceryl [3-14C]glyphosate was glyphosate, thereby confirming that hydrolysis of the ester was the first step in the mineralization of glyceryl glyphosate.

https://openalex.org/W2005993502,"The aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates biological responses to planar aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzo[α]pyrene. However, no endogenous physiological ligand for the AhR has been identified. Since the AhR regulates bioactivity to common environmental pollutants, and since it is predicted to play an important physiological function, we have investigated the expression of the AhR during the cell cycle of murine 3T3 fibroblasts. We show here that stimulation of growth-arrested 3T3 cells with serum results in increased expression of AhR protein. Serum-induced expression of AhR in synchronized, serum-stimulated cells occurs at the onset of DNA synthesis (S phase) and is maximal at time points corresponding to late S phase. Transient transfections with an AhR-promoter-luciferase construct demonstrate that reporter gene transcription from the AhR promoter is regulated in a serum-dependent manner. Serum-dependent induction of AhR expression is prevented by an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity. Ligand-activated growth factor receptors (platelet-derived growth factor receptor basic fibroblast growth factor receptor) as well as an ectopically expressed tyrosine kinase (the v-Src oncoprotein) induce AhR expression in the absence of serum. Therefore, tyrosine kinase signaling is both necessary and sufficient for induction of AhR expression. Studies with the G1 blocker sodium butyrate show that the signal transduction pathways mediating serum-stimulated progression through the cell cycle are distinct from those that induce AhR expression. These data suggest that transcriptional regulation of the AhR is important in determining cellular sensitivity to the actions of AhR ligand(s) and that the AhR may play a role during the cellular proliferative response.

Such compounds include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (typified by benzo[α]pyrene, or B[α]P) and halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (typified by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as B[α]P are generated during the combustion of fossil fuels and are present in tobacco smoke and smoked meats. Halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin are formed as contaminants during the manufacture of several commercial products, including the chlorophenols. These chemicals are persistent high level environmental pollutants and cause a variety of toxic and carcinogenic effects that are largely mediated by activation of the AhR (for reviews see 1Poland A. Knutson J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol... 1982; 22: 517-554Google Scholar and 2Whitlock J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

The unliganded AhR exists in the cytosol, in a complex with the 90-kDa heat shock protein (HSP 90). Upon binding to aryl hydrocarbons, the AhR dissociates from HSP 90 and translocates to the nucleus, where it is thought to form a complex with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear transporter (ARNT) protein (3Reyes H. Reisz-Porszasz S. Hankinson O. Science.. 1992; 256: 1193-1196Google Scholar, 4Pollenz R.S. Sattler C.A. Poland A. Mol. Pharmacol... 1993; 45: 428-438Google Scholar). The ligand-activated AhR·ARNT complex binds to specific enhancer sequences (termed xenobiotic-response elements; XREs), present within the promoter region of aromatic hydrocarbon-inducible genes. The most widely studied AhR-responsive genes are the AhR-inducible members of the P450 cytochrome family. Ligand activation of the AhR results in transcriptional activation of genes of the P4501 subfamily, specifically P4501A1/1A2 and P4501B1 (1Poland A. Knutson J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

The DNA-bound AhR·ARNT heterodimer is thought to facilitate the recruitment of other transcription factors to the promoter, thereby promoting transcription (1Poland A. Knutson J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol... 1982; 22: 517-554Google Scholar, 2Whitlock J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol... 1990; 30: 251-277Google Scholar). However, the ligand-activated AhR can also inhibit transcription of certain genes by binding to XREs that overlap other positive regulatory elements (6Krishnan V. Porter W. Santostefano M. Wang X. Safe S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 6710-6719Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The AhR is widely expressed and is postulated to play a role in normal growth and development based upon patterns of AhR expression in developing mouse embryos (7Peters J.M. Wiley L.M. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1995; 134: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 8Abbott B.D. Perdew G.H. Birnbaum L.S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1994; 126: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although it is likely that a physiological ligand for the AhR does exist, no such molecule has yet been identified. Nevertheless, inappropriate activation of the AhR by aromatic hydrocarbons induces a variety of cell-specific effects. These include increased proliferation (e.g. parenchymal cells, epithelial cells of the urinary tract, the intestine, and the interfollicular epidermis), inhibition of differentiation (e.g. the generative cells of the gastric glands) as well as tumor promotion in experimental animals (1Poland A. Knutson J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol... 1982; 22: 517-554Google Scholar and 2Whitlock J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol... 1990; 30: 251-277Google Scholar and references therein). Thus, AhR activation can have profound effects on cell growth and differentiation. These data support the notion that the AhR plays a part in normal growth and development and that deregulation of AhR signal transduction pathways by aromatic hydrocarbons interferes with normal growth processes. Regulation of expression of the AhR is a potentially important mechanism for determining the physiological responsiveness to AhR ligands during normal growth and development. Moreover, regulated expression of the AhR may underlie the cell-specific responsiveness to AhR ligands and may be an important determinant of aryl hydrocarbon-induced toxicity. Here we report that expression of the AhR is stringently regulated during the course of the mammalian cell cycle. These data establish a further link between the AhR and cell proliferation and lend support to other studies implying a role for the AhR during the life cycle of mammalian cells. Murine 3T3 fibroblasts have provided a valuable cell system for the study of growth factor-regulated signal transduction and cell cycle-regulated events (for reviews see 9Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar and 10Rozengurt E. Science. 1986; 234: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). 3T3 fibroblasts are immortal, nontransformed cell lines, originally derived from mouse embryos. The growth properties and growth factor requirements of 3T3 cells have been well characterized. Moreover, much is known regarding the molecular mechanisms that regulate cell cycle progression in these cells. For exponential growth, 3T3 fibroblasts require exogenously added growth factors, usually supplied by supplementation of the growth medium with 10% donor calf serum. Upon serum withdrawal, 3T3 cells undergo growth arrest and remain in a quiescent state termed G0. However, when stimulated with fresh serum or certain defined mitogenic growth factors (such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)), the cells synchronously re-enter the G1 phase of the cell cycle. G1 is defined as the time interval between G0 (or mitosis) and the initiation of DNA synthesis (S phase) and is characterized by a cascade of growth factor-stimulated signaling events including growth factor-induced synthesis of second messenger molecules, activation of small GTP-binding proteins, protein kinase cascades, and the transcriptional activation of “immediate early” and “delayed response” genes whose protein products are thought to be necessary for progression through the cell cycle (reviewed in 9Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar, 10Rozengurt E. Science. 1986; 234: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 11Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev.

Elsevier, Amsterdam1991: 257-293Google Scholar). Thus, the cell cycle comprises a complex program of temporally ordered events that mediate cellular responses to external mitogenic stimuli. We have investigated the expression of the AhR during the 3T3 fibroblast cell cycle. We show here that expression of the AhR is regulated at the transcriptional level in response to serum and purified growth factors during the course of the cell cycle. These data suggest that regulation of AhR expression may be an important mechanism for sensitizing cells to AhR ligands and strengthen the idea that the AhR serves an important function during normal cell growth and development. Swiss 3T3 cells were obtained from the ATCC and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin containing 10% donor calf serum. To induce growth arrest, cells were placed in culture medium containing 0.5% serum for 24 h. v-src-expressing Swiss 3T3 cells were obtained as described previously (13Vaziri C. Faller D.V. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 1244-1253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These experiments were carried out as described previously (13Vaziri C. Faller D.V. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 1244-1253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monolayers of Swiss 3T3 cells in 10-cm culture dishes were rinsed with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The washed monolayers were detached by the addition of 1.5 ml of 10 mM Tris (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA (TNE) for 10 min at room temperature. Detached cells were scraped off the dish, placed in a microcentrifuge tube, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 s. The washed cell pellets were lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 0.25% Nonidet P-40), vortexed vigorously, and incubated on ice for 5 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The resulting supernatants (cytosolic extracts) were removed and frozen at −70°C prior to immunoblotting. Nuclear pellets were resuspended and washed in 200 μl of lysis buffer and then repelleted at 10,000 × g. The washed nuclear pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer containing 2 units of RQ DNase I (Promega). Chromatin was digested on ice for 10 min. Digested nuclei were then frozen at −70°C prior to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All experiments shown were performed with two independently generated antibodies. Dr. Gary Perdew kindly provided us with a monoclonal anti-AhR antibody (clone RPT-1). A polyclonal antibody to recombinant murine AhR was also purchased from Biomol. Both antisera recognized a single 95-kDa band on immunoblots that was blocked by excess recombinant AhR. Identical results were obtained using both antibodies. 25-μg aliquots of each sample were denatured by heating to 90°C in SDS-reducing buffer and were separated by electrophoresis on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After transfer to nitrocellulose, the filters were probed with antisera to murine AhR. The blots were developed using an ECL kit (Amersham Corp.). Exponentially growing cultures of 3T3 cells were transfected with 10 μg of the appropriate plasmid DNA plus 20 μg of salmon sperm carrier DNA by calcium phosphate co-precipitation. After 12 h, the transfection medium was removed and replaced with fresh culture medium. 12 h later, the cells were placed in culture medium containing 10 or 0.5% serum. 18 h later, the transfected monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and detached with TNE as described above. Cell extracts were prepared by detergent lysis and were assayed for luciferase activity using a commercially available kit (Promega). To prepare nuclear extracts, monolayers of 3T3 cells were first rinsed and then scraped into 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. Washed cells (approximately 107) were resuspended in 5 ml of hypotonic ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mM Hepes (pH 7.9), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mM benzamidine, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol), left on ice for 10 min, and then homogenized with 10 up/down strokes of a hand-held glass/glass homogenizer. The lysate was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min. After aspirating the supernatant, the nuclear pellet was resuspended in approximately 0.3 ml of salt extraction buffer (20 mM Hepes (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 420 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mM benzamidine, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol). Extraction of nuclear proteins was carried out by incubation on ice for 20 min. The salt-extracted nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatants containing the salt-extracted nuclear proteins were stored at −70°C prior to EMSA analysis. XRE binding reactions were performed in a volume of 30 μl containing 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.9), 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 5 μg of poly(dI:dC), and 5 μg of nuclear extract protein. All components were incubated on ice for 10 min prior to addition of double-stranded 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe specifying the XRE (14Dolwick K.M. Swanson H.I. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8566-8570Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The incubation was continued for a further 20 min after the addition of the probe. Reaction mixes were loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 200 V. Protein-DNA complexes with retarded electrophoretic mobility were detected by autoradiography of the dried gel. Exponentially growing cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells were placed in fresh growth medium containing 10% serum or were transferred to medium containing reduced (0.5%) serum for 24 h. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of propidium iodide-stained nuclei confirmed that the cells underwent growth arrest following serum starvation, as evident by reduced levels of cells in S and G2+ M relative to cells in 10% serum (Fig. 1A). Immunoblot analysis of detergent lysates from parallel cultures of fibroblasts with two independent anti-AhR antibodies (see “Materials and Methods”) indicated greatly reduced expression of a 95-kDa immunoreactive protein in cytosol from serum-starved cells relative to cells growing in 10% serum (Fig. 1B). Although prolonged development of immunoblots did eventually enable detection of the 95-kDa band in extracts from serum-starved cells (see, for example, Figs. 4, 6, 7, and 8), serum stimulation consistently resulted in 4-10-fold induction of levels of this protein.Fig. 4Kinetics of induction of AhR expression and DNA synthesis following serum-stimulation. Cultures of fibroblasts were made quiescent by starvation in 0.5% serum for 24 h. The growth-arrested cultures were left untreated or were given 10% serum for the indicated times. Cells were assayed for entry into S phase by determinations of [3H]thymidine incorporation (A) or for expression of the AhR by immunoblotting of cytosolic extracts (B).

Exponentially growing 3T3 cells were treated with the AhR ligand B[α]P. Nuclear and cytosolic extracts were prepared at frequent intervals following B[α]P treatment. Cell extracts were then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and probed with anti-AhR antisera (Fig. 2). As would be expected for the AhR, brief (0.5-h) exposure to 1 μM B[α]P resulted in nuclear translocation of the immunoreactive 95-kDa species, and prolonged (4-h) treatment with ligand resulted in complete down-regulation of this protein (Fig. 2). These data are similar to the findings of Swanson and Perdew, who also demonstrated ligand-induced down-regulation of the AhR (15Swanson H.I. Perdew G.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and further confirm the identity of the 95-kDa immunoreactive protein in our experiments as the AhR. We tested whether the growth state-associated changes in AhR expression were of sufficient magnitude to affect the extent of ligand-dependent AhR nuclear translocation. Exponentially growing 3T3 cells (in 10% serum) and serum-starved cells were stimulated for 45 min with B[α]P. Proteins present in nuclear extracts from the cells were tested for XRE binding activity by EMSA. As shown in Fig. 3, nuclear extracts from proliferating cells contained increased amounts of XRE binding activity following B[α]P stimulation relative to growth-arrested fibroblasts. These experiments demonstrate that the state of growth arrest resulting from serum starvation is associated with reduced expression of the AhR and consequent reduced cellular responsiveness to an AhR ligand. We examined the kinetics of AhR induction following readdition of 10% serum to quiescent (serum-starved) cultures of cells. Immunoblot analysis of AhR expression at various time intervals following the addition of serum showed that serum-induced expression of AhR was detectable after a lag period of approximately 13 h and was maximal by 18 h (Fig. 4A). By comparison, the onset of DNA synthesis (determined by measurements of [3H]thymidine incorporation into genomic DNA) began approximately 13 h following serum stimulation of quiescent cells and was complete after 22-24 h (Fig. 4B). Therefore, AhR expression was induced at the G1/S phase boundary and peaked in late S phase. Serum-dependent induction of the AhR protein may have potentially resulted from increases in steady state levels of the AhR mRNA. However, AhR transcripts were undetectable by RNA blot analysis of samples of total RNA from Swiss 3T3 cells, and the inherent difficulties in accurate quantification of oligo(dT)-cellulose-selected transcripts precluded meaningful comparisons between different RNA samples. Therefore, we directly tested whether the increased expression of AhR protein in serum-stimulated Swiss 3T3 cells was due to serum-dependent transcription of the AhR gene using a reporter gene driven by the AhR promoter. Cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with the plasmid p5K600f, which contains 600 base pairs of the promoter region of the murine AhR gene upstream of a luciferase reporter gene (16Schmidt J.V. Carver L.A. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22203-22209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transfected cells were fed with fresh medium containing 10% serum or were placed in culture medium containing 0.5% serum. After 18 h, the cells were harvested, and cytosolic extracts were assayed for AhR promoter-driven luciferase activity. As shown in Fig. 5, extracts from p5K600f-transfected cells maintained in 0.5% serum expressed reduced levels of luciferase activity (greater than 90% reduction) relative to cells that were given 10% serum. By contrast, cytosolic extracts from cultures of cells that were transfected in parallel with a promoterless luciferase construct (pGL2b) or a vector containing the luciferase gene downstream of a strong constitutive promoter (pSV2LUC) did not show such serum-dependent changes in luciferase activity (Fig. 5). These data show that serum-dependent expression of the AhR results, at least in large part, from transcriptional regulation. Serum comprises a poorly defined mixture of growth-stimulatory (as well as growth-inhibitory) factors. Serum-induced mitogenesis in 3T3 cells is thought to result in large part (but not entirely) from the action of polypeptide growth factors (such as PDGF) present in serum (9Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar, 10Rozengurt E. Science. 1986; 234: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Consequently, serum stimulation of fibroblasts results in ligand occupancy and activation of growth factor receptors of the tyrosine kinase family (including the PDGF receptor). Downstream events resulting from ligand activation of growth factor receptors in 3T3 cells include activation of other intracellular tyrosine kinases (members of the src family; see 17Twamley-Stein G. Pepperkok R. Ansorge W. Courtnidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7696-7700Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), as well as elevated levels of signaling molecules (such as diacylglycerol, Ca2+, and cAMP), which mediate activation of appropriate serine/threonine kinases (protein kinase C, calmodulin-dependent kinase, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase, respectively). These intracellular signaling events are thought to contribute to the cellular mitogenic response (reviewed in 9Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar and 10Rozengurt E. Science. 1986; 234: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Since our experiments indicated a correlation between serum-dependent progression through the cell cycle and induction of AhR expression, we investigated the role of these individual signaling events in AhR induction. Quiescent cultures of 3T3 cells were stimulated with 10% serum for 18 h in the absence or presence of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin-A. As shown in Fig. 6, herbimycin-A inhibited serum-induced AhR expression. As expected, the concentration of herbimycin-A used in these experiments (0.5 μg/ml) prevented serum-induced DNA synthesis but did not result in cell death during the course of the experiment (not shown). Therefore, tyrosine kinase signaling was necessary for serum-dependent AhR expression. To directly test whether tyrosine kinase activity could induce AhR expression we ectopically expressed the v-Src oncoprotein in Swiss 3T3 cells. As shown in Fig. 6, the v-Src-expressing Swiss 3T3 cells expressed constitutively high levels of AhR, even under conditions of serum-starvation. By contrast, the parental Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts only expressed high levels of AhR after serum stimulation (Fig. 6). Since protein kinase C, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and calcium/calmodulin-dependent proteins are downstream targets of activated tyrosine kinase receptors (10Rozengurt E. Science. 1986; 234: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar), we investigated the potential role of these effectors in AhR induction. Separate cultures of quiescent fibroblasts were stimulated with 100 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (a protein kinase C activator), 2 μM A23187 (a calcium ionophore that elevates intracellular calcium levels), or a combination of 1.75 mM dibutyryl-cAMP (a cell-penetrant cAMP analogue) and 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (a cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitor). 18 h later, cytosolic extracts were prepared and analyzed for AhR expression by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 6, none of the treatments induced detectable levels of AhR expression, although phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and dibutyryl-cAMP/3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine both elicited a mitogenic response in parallel assays of [3H]thymidine incorporation (data not shown), as has been reported by other investigators (10Rozengurt E. Science. 1986; 234: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Therefore, activation of serine/threonine kinase activity (protein kinase C, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase) was insufficient to induce AhR expression. However, tyrosine kinase signaling was specifically required for induction of AhR expression in response to serum, and a constitutively active tyrosine kinase (v-Src) was sufficient to confer high level expression of AhR in the absence of serum. Since certain defined fibroblast mitogens (PDGF or FGF) activate receptors of the tyrosine kinase family (and are known to activate c-Src, see 17Twamley-Stein G. Pepperkok R. Ansorge W. Courtnidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7696-7700Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), we asked whether they would also induce AhR expression. Separate cultures of serum-starved 3T3 cells were stimulated with serum, PDGF, and bFGF. The mitogen-stimulated cells were then analyzed for AhR expression (by immunoblotting) and for entry into the cell cycle (by measurements of [3H]thymidine incorporation). PDGF and bFGF were effective mitogens, as shown by their ability to induce [3H]thymidine incorporation in serum-starved 3T3 cells (Fig. 7A). Both PDGF and bFGF induced AhR expression, albeit to lesser levels than were induced by serum (Fig. 7B). Therefore, defined fibroblast mitogens were able to induce cytosolic AhR expression. We also performed immunoblot analysis on preparations of washed nuclei from quiescent and serum/growth factor-treated cells. As shown in Fig. 7B, nuclei from mitogen-treated cells also contained increased levels of AhR relative to nuclei from quiescent cells. Therefore, the amount of AhR present in the nuclear compartment may be regulated by serum and mitogens during the course of the proliferative cell cycle. Since our experiments indicated a good correlation between the mitogenic potential of serum/growth factors and their abilities to induce AhR expression, we asked whether progression through the cell cycle was necessary for AhR induction. Therefore, we tested the effect of the cell cycle inhibitor sodium butyrate on cell cycle progression and AhR expression. Cultures of serum-starved 3T3 fibroblasts were stimulated with serum in the presence or absence of 2 mM sodium butyrate and assayed for entry into the cell cycle (by determining [3H]thymidine incorporation) or tested for induction of AhR expression (by immunoblot analysis). As shown in Fig. 8A, 2 mM sodium butyrate abolished serum-stimulated DNA synthesis, indicative of an effective G1 block. Cell viability assays indicated no toxicity or cell death (not shown). However, serum-dependent induction of AhR expression was unaffected by the presence of sodium butyrate (Fig. 8B). Therefore, progression to S phase and G2 was not necessary for serum-dependent induction of AhR expression. These data show that the serum-induced signal transduction pathways necessary for AhR expression can be dissociated from those that are required for cell cycle progression. We have shown here that the expression of the AhR gene is transcriptionally induced by serum in murine 3T3 fibroblasts. Many of the genes induced by serum treatment of 3T3 fibroblasts are essential components of the genetic program resulting in DNA synthesis and cell division, in fibroblasts as well as in other cell types. Serum comprises a mixture of growth-stimulatory as well as growth-inhibitory factors. As with other serum-induced genes (e.g. c-myc, c-fos, c-jun, egr-1), expression of the AhR is also induced by an oncogene (v-src) and by purified fibroblast mitogens such as PDGF and FGF (9Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar, 10Rozengurt E. Science. 1986; 234: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 11Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 12Lau L.F. Nathaniels D. Molecular Aspects of Cellular Regulation: Hormonal Regulation of Gene Transcription. Vol. 6. Elsevier, Amsterdam1991: 257-293Google Scholar). Therefore, AhR induction following serum-stimulation most likely results from mitogenic growth factors present in serum. Indeed, PDGF is known to be a major mitogenic factor in serum. However, cell cycle progression is not required to induce AhR expression, as shown by dissociation of serum-induced AhR expression and cell cycle progression with the G1 inhibitor sodium butyrate. Genes induced by serum growth factors in cultured fibroblasts are broadly categorized as immediate early, delayed early, or late based upon their kinetics of induction following serum/growth factor stimulation of quiescent cells (9Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar, 10Rozengurt E. Science. 1986; 234: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 11Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 12Lau L.F. Nathaniels D. Molecular Aspects of Cellular Regulation: Hormonal Regulation of Gene Transcription. Vol. 6. Elsevier, Amsterdam1991: 257-293Google Scholar). Immediate early genes are induced early in G1 even in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors (e.g. c-myc, c-fos), whereas delayed early genes are expressed later in G1 (but prior to S phase) and require new protein synthesis (e.g.. ornithine decarboxylase). Late genes are those activated at or after the onset of DNA synthesis. The AhR, therefore, must be considered a late gene, since its expression peaks after the onset (and completion) of DNA synthesis. Like the AhR, many other serum/growth factor-induced proteins are transcription factors (e.g. c-myc, c-fos, c-jun). The protein products of many immediate early genes are transcription factors that are themselves thought to mediate expression of delayed early genes and late genes, thereby achieving an ordered sequential program of transcriptional events. Interestingly, the AhR promoter contains binding sites for transcription factors that are expressed earlier in the cell cycle, namely AP-1 (composed of c-fos and c-jun dimers) and c-myc. It is noteworthy that, like the AhR, c-myc expression is elevated in exponentially growing cultures of fibroblasts relative to growth-arrested cells (18Rollins B.J. Morrison E.D. Stiles C.D. Science. 1987; 238: 1269-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 19Dean M. Levine R.A. Ran W. Kindy M.S. Sonenshein G.E. Campisi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9161-9166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is induced in response to serum as well as purified mitogenic growth factors such as PDGF and FGF (20Armelin H.A. Armelin M.C.S. Kelly K. Stewart T. Leder P. Cochran B.B. Stiles C.D. Nature. 1984; 310: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The possibility exists, therefore, that the AhR promoter is a physiologically relevant target for the c-myc proto-oncogene. More detailed analysis of the AhR promoter is under way to identify the cis acting elements and trans-acting factors that mediate serum-dependent transcription of the AhR gene. Induction of AhR expression during the replicative program of 3T3 cells most likely serves to sensitize proliferating cells to the actions of AhR ligands. Indeed, our EMSA analysis demonstrates that B[α]P stimulation results in greater nuclear accumulation of the AhR in proliferating 3T3 cells relative to growth-arrested fibroblasts. Moreover, our finding that the AhR is present in nuclei of serum/growth factor-stimulated cells suggests that nuclear translocation and perhaps even transcription factor activity of the AhR is directly modified by mitogens. Mouse embryos transcribe AhR mRNA (7Peters J.M. Wiley L.M. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1995; 134: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 8Abbott B.D. Perdew G.H. Birnbaum L.S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1994; 126: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and AhR −/−“knockout” mice are reported to be developmentally impaired (21Salguero P.F. Pineau T. Hilbert D.M. McPhail T. Lee S.S.T. Kimura S. Nebert D.W. Rudikoff S. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Science. 1995; 268: 722-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar), although the latter study is now controversial (22McDonnel W.M. Chensue S.W. Askari F.K. Moseley R.H. Science. 1996; 271: 223-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Those studies suggest that the AhR plays an important role in normal growth and development. The 3T3 fibroblasts used in our studies were derived from Swiss mouse embryos. Our finding that expression of the AhR is transcriptionally regulated by mitogenic stimuli (serum and purified growth factors) suggests that this transcription factor may play a role in embryonic cell proliferation and differentiation. Phillips et al. (23Phillips M. Enan E. Liu P.C.C. Matsumara F. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 395-402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have found that the AhR ligand 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin can inhibit terminal adipocyte conversion of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts. Interestingly, the 3T3-L1 fibroblast subline used in the latter study was originally derived from Swiss 3T3 cells (24Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1974; 1: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Therefore, AhR activation can directly influence the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation. It is likely to be significant that this critical growth-regulatory gene is itself subject to stringent transcriptional control. In the living organism, fibroblasts and their proliferation in response to growth factors play important roles in organogenesis, the maintenance of connective tissue, and wound healing. Our finding that the AhR is expressed in a regulated manner in these cells raises the possibility that the AhR is involved in these vital physiological processes. Moreover, many of the serum-induced genes originally identified in fibroblasts are now known to play ubiquitous roles in growth and differentiation. It is likely, therefore, that the findings described here will be of general significance. We thank Drs. Christopher A. Bradfield and Gary Perdew for the generous gifts of the AhR promoter-luciferase construct and anti-AhR antibody, respectively."

We previously demonstrated that >90% of TFPI bound to a single population of low affinity binding sites on hepatoma cells (2 × 106 sites/cell, Kd = 30 nM), and, that following binding, the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) mediated TFPI uptake and degradation. We subsequently reported heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) constitute a second receptor system involved in TFPI catabolism. In the present study, mouse embryonic fibroblasts heterozygous and homozygous-negative for disruption of the LRP gene were used to further examine the roles of LRP and HSPGs in TFPI endocytosis. We demonstrate that LRP is absolutely required for degrading 125I-TFPI. LRP heterozygous and homozygous-negative cells bind 125I-TFPI similarly, and the 39-kDa protein, an inhibitor of all known ligand interactions with LRP, does not alter 125I-TFPI binding to these cells. TFPI can be cross-linked to LRP on [35S]cysteine-labeled hepatoma and LRP-heterozygous cells but not LRP-negative cells. When HSPGs are blocked with protamine, 125I-TFPI binds in a 39-kDa protein-inhibitable manner to 41,000 high affinity sites/hepatoma cell (Kd = 2.3 nM). Blockade of HSPGs with protamine results in significantly more 125I-TFPI degradation by LRP-positive cells. TFPI can be cross-linked to LRP in the absence and presence of protamine. However, in the presence of protamine, relative to the total pool of cross-linked proteins, 5-fold more TFPI is cross-linked to LRP. Finally, we show TFPI inhibits 125I-α2-macroglobulin-methylamine binding to hepatoma cells and that carboxyl-terminal residues 115-319 of the 39-kDa protein inhibit both 125I-TFPI degradation and binding when binding conditions contain protamine.

A 39-kDa protein, also termed receptor-associated protein, copurifies with and binds with high affinity to LRP (1Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev.

Numerous studies have found that exogenously added 39-kDa protein inhibits the binding and/or cellular uptake of all ligands by LRP (1Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). In 1994, an LRP-negative cell line was established from the embryos of LRP-knockout mice (15Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LRP-negative cell lines, in addition to the 39-kDa protein and antibodies directed against LRP, are an extremely useful means of establishing whether LRP functions as a receptor for candidate ligands. low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein tissue factor pathway inhibitor α2-macroglobulin-methylamine heparan sulfate proteoglycans polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis glutathione S-transferase 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) bovine serum albumin phosphate-buffered saline PBS containing 1 mM CaCl2 and 0.5 mM MgCl2. Using hepatoma cells, we previously reported (10Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) that LRP mediated the uptake and cellular degradation of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), a 42-kDa plasma glycoprotein that inhibits both coagulation factor Xa and tissue factor-initiated blood coagulation (16Broze Jr., G.J. Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 159-169PubMed Google Scholar). We also reported that LRP was not the major cell surface TFPI receptor since the 39-kDa protein did not inhibit 125I-TFPI binding (10Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Because 10% of prebound TFPI was degraded via LRP, we speculated that ≤10% of TFPI bound directly to LRP which was then internalized and degraded. We also considered the possibility that after TFPI bound to another molecule, TFPI could be transferred to LRP for uptake and degradation since several previously characterized LRP ligands (7Nykjær A.

Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) appear to play an important role in TFPI catabolism (18Sandset P.M. Abildgaard U. Larsen M.L. Thromb.

Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 942-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Evidence for HSPG involvement has come from the following observations. 1) Plasma TFPI levels increase severalfold in vivo (18Sandset P.M. Abildgaard U. Larsen M.L. Thromb.

Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) following intravenous administration of heparin, an effect attributed to the release of TFPI from endothelial or liver cell HSPG/glycosaminoglycan-binding sites. Further, neutralization of heparin with protamine reduces TFPI levels to preheparin values, presumably by re-exposing TFPI to HSPG/glycosaminoglycan-binding sites (21Harenberg J. Siegele M. Dempfle C. Stehle G. Heene D.L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 942-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). 2) Protamine, which competes for HSPG-binding sites, inhibits TFPI binding to hepatoma cells and prolongs the half-life of 125I-TFPI in mice (19Narita M. Bu G. Olins G.M. Higuchi D.A. Herz J. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24800-24804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). 3) Under conditions where TFPI is unable to bind to HSPGs, the 39-kDa protein inhibits 125I-TFPI binding to hepatoma cells (19Narita M.

The purpose of the present study was to demonstrate a direct interaction between TFPI and LRP, to define this affinity, and to further examine the role of HSPGs in TFPI binding and degradation. Domains on the 39-kDa protein required for inhibiting TFPI degradation and cross-competition studies between TFPI and previously characterized LRP-ligands have been examined. Recombinant human full-length TFPI was produced and purified from Escherichia coli (22Diaz-Collier J.A. Palmier M.O. Kretzmer K.K. Bishop B.F. Combs R.G. Obukowicz M.G. Frazier R.B. Bild G.S.

Recombinant full-length glutathione S-transferase (GST)-39-kDa protein, GST-39-kDa protein constructs, and GST-free 39-kDa protein were produced and purified from E. coli (23Warshawsky I. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22046-22054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α2-Macroglobulin was purified from human plasma and activated with methylamine (to yield α2M*) (23Warshawsky I. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22046-22054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Carrier-free sodium [125I]iodide, [35S]cysteine, Amplify, and Hyperfilm-MP were purchased from Amersham. IODO-GEN and 3,3′dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) (DTSSP) were from Pierce Chemical Co. Protamine sulfate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Triton X-100, sodium deoxycholate, and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were from Sigma. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) (fraction V) was from Calbiochem. Protein A-agarose beads were from Repligen. Tissue culture media were from Life Technologies, Inc. Rat hepatoma MH1C1 cells (24Bu G. Morton P.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15595-15602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts heterozygous (PEA10 cells) and homozygous-negative (PEA13 cells) for disruption of the LRP gene (15Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were grown as described previously. TFPI (50-200 μg) and α2M* (20 μg) were labeled with 125I using the IODO-GEN method (24Bu G. Morton P.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15595-15602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific activities were generally 0.5-4 × 107 cpm/μg of protein. Anti-39-kDa protein (23Warshawsky I. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22046-22054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), anti-TFPI (25Wesselschmidt R. Likert K.M. Girard T.J. Wun T.-C. Broze Jr., G.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2004-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and anti-LRP antibodies (26Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13002-13009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared as described previously. Assay buffers for 125I-TFPI and 125I-α2M* were Earle's minimum essential medium (with glutamine) containing 3% BSA and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 6 mg/ml BSA and 5 mM CaCl2, respectively. Cell binding assays were performed as described previously (10Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, washed cells were incubated with assay buffer containing the indicated concentrations of 125I-ligand in the absence or presence of unlabeled competitor proteins for 2 h at 4°C. The cells were then washed and lysed. Radioactivity of cell lysates was determined in a Packard γ counter. Total 125I-ligand binding was determined in the presence of 125I-ligand alone. Nonspecific 125I-ligand binding was determined in the presence of excess unlabeled ligand as specified in the text. Specific 125I-ligand binding was determined by subtracting nonspecific from total 125I-ligand binding. Cell degradation assays (10Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) were performed by adding assay buffer containing 125I-TFPI in the absence or presence of unlabeled competitor proteins to washed cell monolayers. After incubation at 37°C for 4 h, the overlying media were removed and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Degradation of ligand was defined as the appearance of radioactive ligand fragments in the overlying media that were soluble in trichloroacetic acid. Degradation of 125I-TFPI in parallel dishes that did not contain cells was subtracted from each point. Cells were grown in 10-cm dishes to 80% confluency. After incubation in medium lacking cysteine, metabolic labeling was initiated by the addition of [35S]cysteine for 5 h as specified in the figure legends. Thereafter, monolayers were washed and incubated at 4°C with buffer containing 10 nM 39-kDa protein or 100 nM TFPI in the absence or presence of 100 μg/ml protamine. Cells were then washed with PBS containing 1 mM CaCl2 and 0.5 mM MgCl2 (PBSc). Chemical cross-linking (24Bu G. Morton P.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15595-15602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13002-13009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was performed with 1 mM DTSSP in PBSc for 30 min at 4°C followed by quenching with Tris-buffered saline and solubilization in PBS containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After sonication, cell lysates were centrifuged in a Microfuge, and the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation. As described (24Bu G. Morton P.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15595-15602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13002-13009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cell lysates were mixed with an equal volume of PBS containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and precleared overnight with normal rabbit serum followed by protein A-agarose. The precleared samples were divided into equal portions and incubated with primary antibody. After incubation with protein A-agarose beads, the immunoprecipitates were washed. In some experiments, the protein A-agarose beads were divided into two equal parts for reducing and nonreducing conditions before the final wash. The immunoprecipitated material was released from the beads by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204264) Google Scholar) with or without 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. Samples were analyzed by 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Gels were impregnated with Amplify, dried, and exposed to film. Densitometric scanning of the gels was performed on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Densitometric scanning of nonreduced samples was quantified by adding the amount of radioactivity retained in the stacking gel, at the top of the separating gel, and at the position LRP. For reduced samples, the amount of radioactivity was determined by scanning the gels at the position of LRP. To demonstrate a direct interaction between TFPI and LRP, chemical cross-linking was performed using DTSSP, a thio-cleavable, water-soluble, and membrane-impermeant reagent. In Fig. 1, [35S]cysteine-labeled hepatoma cells were subjected to cross-linking following binding with TFPI or the 39-kDa protein. Cell lysates, immunoprecipitated with anti-TFPI, anti-39-kDa protein, anti-LRP IgGs, or normal rabbit serum were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. When cells were cross-linked to TFPI or the 39-kDa protein, a complex with very high apparent molecular mass was seen under nonreducing conditions following immunoprecipitation with anti-TFPI (Fig. 1A) or anti-39-kDa protein (Fig. 1B) IgG. These high molecular mass bands migrated to the identical position as that seen in cell lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-LRP antibody (Fig. 1, A and B), implying TFPI and the 39-kDa protein are binding to LRP. Under reducing conditions and resultant cleavage of the cross-linker, the ~515-kDa subunit of LRP was observed using anti-TFPI (Fig. 1A), anti-39-kDa protein (Fig. 1B), and anti-LRP IgGs (Fig. 1, A and B). In the absence of cross-linking, no high molecular mass complex was evident with anti-TFPI (Fig. 1A) or anti-39-kDa protein IgG (Fig. 1B). In the absence of cross-linking, LRP was not co-immunoprecipitated with anti-39-kDa protein IgG since immunoprecipitation conditions contain 1% SDS. Immunoprecipitation of non-cross-linked lysates with anti-LRP IgG (Fig. 1, A and B) resulted in the appearance of the ~515-kDa subunit of LRP under both nonreducing and reducing conditions. No proteins are immunoprecipitated under any condition using normal rabbit serum. We next examined whether TFPI could be cross-linked to LRP-heterozygous PEA10 cells. The identical cross-linking experiments were performed on LRP-negative PEA13 cells. Following [35S]cysteine labeling, cells were incubated with unlabeled TFPI and thereafter cross-linked with DTSSP. Fig. 2 demonstrates that LRP is synthesized by PEA10 cells but not by PEA13 cells since the ~515-kDa subunit of LRP is only immunoprecipitated with anti-LRP IgG from PEA10 cell lysates. The ~515-kDa subunit of LRP is also immunoprecipitated with anti-TFPI IgG from PEA10 cell lysates but not from PEA13 cell lysates, demonstrating TFPI binding directly to LRP. To investigate whether LRP-negative cells were capable of mediating the uptake and degradation of 125I-TFPI, PEA10 and PEA13 cells were incubated with 125I-TFPI in the absence or presence of the 39-kDa protein at 37°C, and degradation products were assessed. Fig. 3A shows PEA10 cells actively degrade 125I-TFPI and that the 39-kDa protein inhibits this degradation in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value 2IC50 is defined as the concentration of competitor which inhibits 50% of radioligand binding or degradation as determined by inspection.of ~15 nM. PEA13 cells degrade 125I-TFPI minimally, and the 39-kDa protein has no effect on the amount of 125I-TFPI degraded. The small amount of 125I-TFPI degraded by PEA13 cells (~40 fmol/106 cells/4 h) may represent an LRP-independent process or more likely is the result of pinocytic internalization since mouse fibroblasts nonspecifically pinocytose ligand at a rate of 0.9 μm3/cell/min (28Holtzman E. Lysosomes. Plenum Press, New York1989Crossref Google Scholar). Fig. 3B shows that PEA10 and PEA13 cells bind 125I-TFPI similarly and that the 39-kDa protein does not alter 125I-TFPI binding to either cell line. We previously reported that the majority of 125I-TFPI binding was not to LRP (10Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and that protamine, a competitor for HSPG-binding sites, inhibited 125I-TFPI binding to MH1C1 cells (19Narita M. Bu G. Olins G.M. Higuchi D.A. Herz J. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24800-24804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We also reported that when protamine was included in the binding medium, the 39-kDa protein inhibited 125I-TFPI binding (19Narita M. Bu G. Olins G.M. Higuchi D.A. Herz J. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24800-24804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, under conditions where TFPI was unable to bind to HSPGs, more TFPI was available for binding to LRP. Therefore, to examine the affinity of TFPI binding to LRP, saturation binding experiments were performed with 125I-TFPI in the absence or presence of protamine. As seen in Fig. 4A, in the absence of protamine, 125I-TFPI bound specifically to MH1C1 cells over the concentration range of 0.6-12 nM. Nonspecific binding increased linearly and accounted for 10% of total 125I-TFPI binding. Saturation of specific binding was not reached at a 125I-TFPI concentration of 12 nM. Scatchard analysis (29Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17712) Google Scholar) yielded ~5 × 106 sites/cell with an apparent Kd value of 20 nM (Fig. 4A, inset), similar to our previous study (10Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In Fig. 4B, saturation binding of 125I-TFPI was performed in the presence of 100 μg/ml protamine, a concentration previously shown (19Narita M. Bu G. Olins G.M. Higuchi D.A. Herz J. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24800-24804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) to inhibit 90% of 125I-TFPI binding to MH1C1 cells. In the presence of protamine, 125I-TFPI bound specifically to MH1C1 cells, and saturation of specific binding was observed at a 125I-TFPI concentration of ~7 nM. Protamine reduced 125I-TFPI binding by >90%. Nonspecific binding increased linearly and accounted for ~40% of total binding. Scatchard analysis (29Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17712) Google Scholar) yielded 41,000 sites/cell with an apparent Kd value of 2.3 nM (Fig. 4B, inset). Fig. 4B also shows that in the presence of 100 μg/ml protamine and 500 nM 39-kDa protein, 125I-TFPI binding is inhibited and is identical to nonspecific 125I-TFPI binding. Since 39-kDa protein-inhibitable 125I-TFPI binding was observed in the presence of protamine (Fig. 4B and 19Narita M. Bu G. Olins G.M. Higuchi D.A. Herz J. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24800-24804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that by blocking TFPI from binding to cell surface HSPGs, more TFPI could bind to LRP. Thus, the effect of protamine on 125I-TFPI degradation was examined. In the absence of protamine, the 39-kDa protein inhibited 125I-TFPI degradation in a dose-dependent manner in MH1C1 (Fig. 5A) and PEA10 (Fig. 5B) cells. 1 μM 39-kDa protein inhibited 70-80% of 125I-TFPI degradation by these cell lines. PEA13 cells (Fig. 5B) degrade 125I-TFPI minimally. In the presence of protamine, the amount of 125I-TFPI degraded by MH1C1 (Fig. 5A) and PEA10 (Fig. 5B) cells was approximately doubled and the 39-kDa protein inhibited >95% of this degradation. In contrast to the LRP-positive MH1C1 and PEA10 cells, protamine inhibited 125I-TFPI degradation by LRP-negative PEA13 cells (Fig. 5B), suggesting a minor fraction of 125I-TFPI degradation is mediated by a protamine-sensitive LRP-independent process. The ability of protamine to alter the amount of 125I-TFPI cross-linked to LRP was next examined. In Fig. 6, [35S]cysteine-labeled MH1C1 cells were subjected to cross-linking following binding with TFPI in the absence or presence of protamine. Under nonreducing conditions, a very high apparent molecular mass complex remaining largely in the stacking gel was immunoprecipitated with anti-TFPI antibody when TFPI was cross-linked to cells following binding in the absence (lane 1) and presence (lane 7) of protamine. Densitometric scanning revealed that ~4-fold more radioactivity was retained in the stacking gel in the absence of protamine (lane 1) than in the presence of protamine (lane 7). As expected, essentially equivalent amounts of LRP were immunoprecipitated with anti-LRP antibody in the absence (lane 2) and presence (lane 8) of protamine since incubation of cells with protamine following metabolic labeling should not alter the amount of LRP synthesized or immunoprecipitated. Under reducing conditions, the cross-linked complexes immunoprecipitated with anti-TFPI antibody (lanes 4 and 10) migrated to the identical position as that seen in cell lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-LRP antibody (lanes 5 and 11). In the presence of protamine, 15% more LRP was immunoprecipitated with anti-TFPI antibody, relative to the total amount of LRP immunoprecipitated with anti-LRP antibody (lane 10:lane 11 versus lane 4:lane 5). Finally, the amount of LRP immunoprecipitated with anti-TFPI antibody under reducing conditions relative to the total amount of cross-linked material immunoprecipitated with anti-TFPI antibody under nonreducing conditions was 5-fold greater in the presence of protamine than in the absence of protamine (lane 10:lane 7 versus lane 4:lane 1). Again, equivalent amounts of LRP were immunoprecipitated under reducing conditions with anti-LRP antibody in the absence and presence of protamine and in the absence and presence of cross-linking (lanes 5, 11, and 17). In the absence of cross-linking, LRP was immunoprecipitated with anti-LRP antibody (lanes 14 and 17) and not with anti-TFPI antibody (lanes 13 and 16). No proteins were immunoprecipitated using normal rabbit serum (lanes 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18). To define regions of the 39-kDa protein required for the inhibition of 125I-TFPI interaction with LRP, the ability of a series of GST-fusion proteins encoding distinct regions of the 39-kDa protein to inhibit 125I-TFPI degradation by MH1C1 cells was examined. Fig. 7A shows the GST-fusion protein encoding carboxyl-terminal residues 115-319 of the 39-kDa protein (GST/115-319) inhibits 125I-TFPI degradation identically to the full-length GST-39-kDa protein (GST/1-319). Both GST/1-319 and GST/115-319 inhibited 80% of 125I-TFPI degradation at concentrations of 1 μM. GST/115-319 (500 nM) also inhibited 85% of specific 125I-TFPI binding at 4°C when protamine (100 μg/ml) was included in the binding medium but did not alter 125I-TFPI binding when protamine was omitted (data not shown). Fig. 7A also shows when amino acids 287-319 or 255-319 are removed from GST/115-319, the resulting constructs, GST/115-287 and GST/115-255, do not effectively inhibit 125I-TFPI degradation, suggesting residues 287-319 are important. Fig. 7B demonstrates inhibition of 125I-TFPI degradation by constructs in which amino acids are deleted from the amino-terminal portion of GST/115-319. The order of potency by these constructs is GST/151-319 > GST/187-319 ~ GST/200-319 ~ GST/225-319. The amino-terminal construct GST/1-114 (500 nM) inhibited 40%-50% of 125I-TFPI degradation and binding when the binding medium contained protamine (data not shown). Competition binding experiments on MH1C1 cells were performed to determine whether TFPI could alter the binding of previously characterized LRP-ligands. As seen in Table I, the 39-kDa protein and TFPI inhibit 94% and 85% of specific 125I-α2M* binding, respectively. Each inhibits 125I-α2M* binding with an IC50 value of 20 nM (data not shown). Each also inhibits >95% of 125I-α2M* degradation (data not shown). Neither the 39-kDa protein nor α2M* alters 125I-TFPI binding. Protamine inhibits >95% of 125I-TFPI binding. When the binding medium contains protamine, the 39-kDa protein and α2M* reduce 125I-TFPI binding by 85% and 50%, respectively. Tissue-type plasminogen activator does not alter 125I-TFPI or 125I-α2M* binding (data not shown). Using hepatoma cells, we previously demonstrated that LRP mediates the cellular degradation of 125I-TFPI since degradation was inhibited by antibodies directed against LRP and by the 39-kDa protein (10Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that LRP is required for the degradation of 125I-TFPI since LRP-heterozygous cells, in contrast to LRP-negative cells, actively degrade 125I-TFPI in a 39-kDa protein-inhibitable manner. Fragments of the 39-kDa protein, which differentially regulate α2M* and tissue-type plasminogen activator binding to LRP (23Warshawsky I. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22046-22054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also differentially inhibit 125I-TFPI degradation and HSPG-independent 125I-TFPI binding. The observation that protamine enhances 125I-TFPI degradation by LRP-positive MH1C1 and PEA10 cells is potentially important. While prevention of TFPI from binding to HSPGs may provide additional TFPI for uptake and degradation by LRP, this is unlikely since the absolute concentration of free 125I-TFPI is essentially unchanged in the absence and presence of protamine. An alternative explanation may be that the “effective”125I-TFPI concentration is increased by protamine: protamine may increase the affinity and/or efficiency of TFPI endocytosis by LRP. The finding that 1 μM 39-kDa protein inhibits >95% of 125I-TFPI degradation by LRP-positive cells in the presence of protamine whereas 70-80% is inhibited in the absence of protamine supports this possibility. Further studies will be necessary to specifically define this mechanism. Nonetheless, the use of protamine provides a strategy to dissect the role of LRP in TFPI endocytosis, and together our results suggest that the direct binding of TFPI to LRP, rather than the transfer of TFPI from HSPGs to LRP, is the predominant mechanism by which TFPI endocytosis occurs, i.e. if transfer was an efficient mechanism, protamine should not enhance, and should, in fact, inhibit 125I-TFPI degradation since protamine would prevent 125I-TFPI binding to HSPGs and subsequent transfer to LRP. In addition, if transfer occurred, the 39-kDa protein should inhibit 125I-TFPI degradation to a similar extent in the absence and presence of protamine, unless transfer was a very slow process. Additional data supporting a direct interaction between TFPI and LRP and this mechanism as responsible for TFPI uptake and degradation are seen in our cross-linking experiments. After cross-linking unlabeled TFPI to [35S]cysteine-labeled MH1C1 and LRP-heterozygous cells, LRP is immunoprecipitated using antibodies directed against TFPI. No specific cross-linking of TFPI to any species is observed on LRP-negative cells. Consistent with the hypothesis that more TFPI binds to LRP when HSPGs are blocked with protamine is the observation that relative to the total cohort of cross-linked proteins, 5-fold more TFPI is cross-linked to LRP in the presence of protamine. In other words, in the presence of protamine, substantially less TFPI binds to the cell surface so fewer cell surface proteins would be cross-linked to TFPI. Indeed, under nonreducing conditions and in the presence of protamine, ~4-fold less total radioactivity is immunoprecipitated with anti-TFPI antibody. Under reducing conditions, protamine does not alter the amount of LRP immunoprecipitated with anti-TFPI antibody since saturating concentrations of TFPI (~5 times the Kd value) would saturate LRP in the presence of protamine and would saturate both LRP and the major TFPI binding species in the absence of protamine. Following reduction and SDS-PAGE, the fate of the remaining radioactivity initially retained in the stacking gel under nonreducing conditions in the absence of protamine could be attributed to the fact that when unlabeled TFPI is cross-linked to cell surface proteins, it is cross-linked not only to LRP but also to numerous other species of various molecular masses. Under nonreducing conditions, these cross-linked complexes are retained in the stacking gel, whereas under reducing conditions, the radioactivity from these complexes is widely distributed throughout the gel lane. As stated, 4-fold more radioactivity was retained in the stacking gel under nonreducing conditions in the absence of protamine than in the presence of protamine. Yet, under reducing conditions, only LRP was evident in the absence (and presence) of protamine. In the absence of protamine, it is not clear why the major TFPI binding species was not also apparent following reduction of the cross-linker. One possibility is that the majority of TFPI binding is to a cell surface carbohydrate moiety and will not be cross-linked to TFPI using DTSSP. Another possibility is that free amine groups on the major TFPI binding species are not accessible to cross-linking with DTSSP. It is also conceivable that there are no cysteines available for metabolic labeling within this TFPI binding species. Finally, this molecule may not be solubilized with 1% Triton X-100. Support for this latter explanation comes from a recent study (30Sevinsky J.R. Rao L.V.M. Ruf W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) which reported that endogenous TFPI is bound to the endothelial cell surface by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked receptor that is insoluble in Triton X-100. Another line of evidence supporting a direct interaction between TFPI and LRP comes from our saturation binding experiments on hepatoma cells performed in the absence and presence of protamine. In the absence of protamine, TFPI binds to 2-5 × 106 low affinity sites/cell (Kd = 20-30 nM) (10Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) whereas in the presence of protamine, TFPI binds to 41,000 high affinity sites/cell (Kd = 2.3 nM). Previous reports on ligand binding affinities and numbers of binding sites/cell of LRP-ligands are similar to that of TFPI binding in the presence of protamine. For example, the Kd value for tissue-type plasminogen activator and 39-kDa protein binding to LRP is 3-6 nM (24Bu G. Morton P.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15595-15602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Iadonato S.P. Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Schwartz A.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 867-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) whereas higher affinities, 40 pM and 2 nM, have been reported for α2M* (32Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14011-14017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The number of tissue-type plasminogen activator binding sites on hepatoma cells is 60,000-100,000 (24Bu G. Morton P.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15595-15602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Iadonato S.P. Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Schwartz A.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 867-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, the similarity in affinity and number of binding sites/cell between TFPI in the presence of protamine and previously characterized LRP-ligands is consistent with direct interaction between TFPI and LRP. Finally, the findings that TFPI inhibits 125I-α2M* binding and that α2M* partially inhibits 125I-TFPI binding when HSPGs are blocked with protamine also suggest that at least a fraction of cell surface TFPI binding is directly to LRP since α2M* is known to bind only to LRP. The inability of unlabeled α2M* to alter 125I-TFPI binding supports our hypothesis that only a small fraction of cell surface TFPI binding is to LRP. Our results further suggest TFPI and α2M* may bind to the same site on LRP. Differences in on/off rates for TFPI and α2M* could account for the varying extents of inhibition of binding observed. Alternatively, TFPI and α2M* may function as noncompetitive inhibitors for binding and therefore bind to distinct sites on LRP. Future competition binding experiments between TFPI and α2M* are required to resolve these issues. In summary, we have shown that TFPI binds directly to LRP, that LRP is required for mediating the cellular degradation of TFPI, and that under conditions where TFPI is unable to bind to HSPGs, TFPI binds in a 39-kDa protein-inhibitable manner specifically and with high affinity to the hepatoma cell surface. Thus, binding, uptake, and degradation of TFPI can occur independent of HSPGs. The two receptor systems involved in TFPI catabolism appear to have different functions: LRP serves to remove TFPI from the circulation, whereas HSPGs may anchor TFPI to the cell surface so that TFPI remains in contact with plasma proteins to function as an anticoagulant.

Photoreduction of 4-thio-FMN in the presence of chorismate synthase at pH 7.5 produced a reduced flavin species with an absorbance maximum at λ = 410 nm indicative of monoanionic, reduced 4-thio-FMN.

On the basis of these findings it is concluded that chorismate synthase preferentially binds neutral flavin species, including the protonated reduced form, rather than anionic flavin species in the presence of EPSP or the 6-fluoro-substrate analog.

Analysis of the effect of potential ER-hsp90 interactions in vivo on receptor function is complicated by the fact that hsp90 binds to ER domains required for hormone binding and stable DNA binding. ER chimeras were therefore created by replacing the ER DNA binding domain with that of GAL4. In addition, the N-terminal AF-1 domain of the ER was replaced with the strong constitutive activation domain of VP16 to create VP16-GAL-ERs. These chimeras bind DNA in a ligand-independent manner, but, importantly, are ligand-dependent transactivators, unlike VP16-GAL, which displays strong constitutive activity under the same conditions. Hormone induces transactivation by VP16-GAL-ERs to levels similar to the constitutive activity of VP16-GAL. Glycerol gradient and coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that, unlike the wild-type ER, VP16-GAL-ER chimeras do not interact with hsp90. Deletion analyses indicate that a region of the ER, primarily between amino acids 370 and 470, is responsible for repressed transcription.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2229-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) diluted 1/1000 in Tris-buffered saline-Tween and 1% milk powder. Western analysis of hsp90 was performed using anti-hsp90 monoclonal antibody SPA-835 (Stressgen). Blots were developed using the ECL detection system (DuPont NEN). Gradients were performed as described by Chambraud et al. (5Chambraud B. Berry M. Redeuilh G. Chambon P. Baulieu E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20686-20691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extracts were made in the presence of phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitors and stabilized with 30 mM sodium molybdate. Fractions (150 μl) were collected from the top of the gradient and assayed by scintillation counting. We were interested in constructing functional ER derivatives that would not interact with hsp90 in vitro to analyze the potential role of heat shock proteins in controlling ER activity. Region D of the receptor has been shown to participate in ER-hsp90 interactions in vitro (5Chambraud B. Berry M. Redeuilh G. Chambon P. Baulieu E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20686-20691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since mutation of region D would disrupt stable DNA binding (15Mader S. Chambon P. White J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1125-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), the ER DBD was replaced with that of GAL4 by fusing the GAL4 DBD to the C-terminal portion of the ER from aa 251 to 300 (Fig. 1A). Any hormone-free GAL-ER chimeras, which do not interact with hsp90, would be expected to be nuclear and possibly DNA-bound. Thus, it would be useful to use transactivation as an assay for nuclear localization and DNA binding. However, wild-type ER bound to DNA in the absence of ligand would be hormone-dependent for transactivation, since the transactivating domain AF-1 (Fig. 1A) has been shown to synergize strongly with ligand-bound AF-2 (21Tora L. White J.H. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Therefore, the N-terminal A/B region containing AF-1 was replaced with the strong hormone-independent activating domain of the herpes simplex virus activator VP16 (Fig. 1A), which does not synergize with AF-2 (21Tora L. White J.H. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). In addition, we used a synthetic promoter containing five GAL4 17-mer binding sites (17M5-TATA-luc, Fig. 1A), since VP16 functions highly synergistically when bound to multiple sites. VP16-GAL, which lacks the ER ligand binding domain (LBD), is a strong constitutive activator of 17M5-TATA-luc (Fig. 1B, V-G). This activity is 200-fold higher than that from a promoter containing a single 17-mer binding site (data not shown) and 50-fold higher than the hormone-dependent activity of GAL-ER (Fig. 1B, G-ER), demonstrating the powerful transcriptional activity of VP16. Transactivation by VP16-GAL-ER chimeras on 17M5-TATA-luc in the absence of hormone was 15-35% of that observed with VP16-GAL. Estradiol consistently stimulated transactivation by chimeras 4-fold (with the exception of VP16-GAL-ER281; 3-fold), to levels similar to those observed with VP16-GAL. While this induction is less than the 6-9-fold stimulation observed with the wild-type ER (data not shown), it is striking given that VP16 is a strong constitutive activator. Several Western analyses showed that all recombinants were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 1C and data not shown) and that expression levels were not dependent on the presence of estradiol (Fig. 1B, inset), thus indicating that the reduced level of transactivation by VP16-GAL-ER chimeras in the absence of hormone relative to VP16-GAL was not due to low levels of expression. Glycerol gradients were used to analyze molybdate-stabilized extracts of cells transfected with the wild-type-ER or VP16-GAL-ER chimeras for interaction with hsp90. The wild-type ER displayed a characteristic salt-dependent shift in sedimentation coefficient (5Chambraud B. Berry M. Redeuilh G. Chambon P. Baulieu E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20686-20691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from the 8 S hsp90-containing complex, to the hsp90-free 4 S form (Fig. 2A). In contrast, 4 S, but no 8 S complex formation, was observed in extracts of cells transfected with VP16-GAL-ER258 (Fig. 2B) or VP16-GAL-ER300 (not shown), indicating that they did not interact with hsp90. Western analysis of gradient fractions showed that peak hormone binding corresponds to peaks of intact protein, suggesting that no significant proteolysis of chimeras occurred (Fig. 2B). No interaction of VP16-GAL-ER258 with hsp90 was detected by immunoprecipitation with anti-GAL antibodies of molybdate-stabilized whole cell extracts of transiently transfected COS-7 cells or of the 4 S peak from a glycerol gradient (Fig. 2C, lanes 1-6). Identical results were obtained using anti-ER antibody F3 (not shown). In contrast, immunoprecipitation of HEG0 expressed in COS-7 cells with F3 led to increased coimmunoprecipitation of hsp90 (Fig. 2C, lanes 7-9). These results suggest that interaction with hsp90 does not control hormone-dependent transactivation by the chimeras. Gel retardation assays were also performed to test for hormone-dependent DNA binding. No significant effect of hormone on DNA binding by VP16-GAL-ER258 or VP16-GAL-ER300 was detected in assays performed with extracts made in the presence or absence of estradiol (Fig. 1D and data not shown). In this respect, the chimeras functioned similarly to the wild-type ER (22Metzger D. Berry M. Ali S. Chambon P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 579-591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2H. S. Lee, J. Aumais, and J. H. White, unpublished results. Hormone dependence of VP16-GAL-ER chimeras may be due to interaction with factors, other than hsp90, which repress transcription in the absence of hormone. A series of deletion mutants were created to test which portions of the ER LBD are responsible for the reduced transactivation in the absence of estradiol (Fig. 3A). C-terminal truncations beyond ER aa 553, which disrupt the integrity of the LBD, generated chimeras displaying low levels of constitutive transactivation (Fig. 3B). Significant constitutive activity is recovered, however, with C-terminal deletions beyond aa 430 to aa 370 and further to aa 302. Disruption of the LBD N terminus by deletion past aa 302 to aa 340, 370, or 430 generated chimeras exhibiting low levels of constitutive activity (Fig. 3B). Significant constitutive activation was only recovered by deletion of the N terminus to aa 470. Taken together, these data indicate that a portion of the LBD, primarily sequences between aa 370 and 470, is required for repressed transcription observed in the absence of hormone. Our results suggest that the mechanism of action of the ER is intermediate between that of the GR subfamily of steroid receptors and those of the thyroid hormone/retinoid/vitamin D3 nuclear receptors. The apo-GR is cytoplasmic, and ligand binding leads to its translocation to the nucleus where it binds palindromic DNA sequences as a homodimer (23Pratt W.B. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic location of the aporeceptor would be consistent with its interaction in vitro with hsp90, which is predominantly cytoplasmic. In contrast, the thyroid hormone and related receptors do not interact with hsp90 in vitro (24Dalman F.C. Sturzenbecker L. Levin A.A. Lucas D.A. Perdew G.H. Petkovich P.M. Chambon P. Grippo J.F. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5605-5608Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), are nuclear in the absence of hormone and bind to response elements composed of directly repeated motifs as heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (25Yu V.C. Delsert C. Andersen B. Holloway J. Devary O.V. Naar A. Kim S.Y. Boutin J.-M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1991; 67: 1251-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar, 26Leid M.

The ER, like the GR, recognizes palindromic response elements as a homodimer (1Green S. Chambon P. Trends Genet. 1988; 4: 309-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 2Evans R.M.

Genet. 1991; 25: 89-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have indicated that the full-length ER interacts with hsp90 in vitro, suggesting that similar interactions may occur in vivo. Immunoprecipitation experiments by others have also indicated that the isolated ER LBD interacts weakly with hsp90 (18Scherrer L.C. Picard D. Massa E. Harmon J.M. Simons S.S. Yamamoto K.R. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5381-5386Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, the LBD used contains a Gly400→ Val mutation, which destabilizes its structure (22Metzger D. Berry M. Ali S. Chambon P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 579-591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Tora L. Mullick A. Metzger D. Ponglikitmongkol M. Park I. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1981-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Our glycerol gradient analyses with VP16-GAL-ER chimeras containing a Val400 mutation have shown that, unlike their Gly400 counterparts, these chimeras form salt-sensitive 8 S complexes in vitro (not shown). In vivo studies, including immunocytochemistry and gene transfer experiments, have provided evidence for the presence of homodimers of apo-ER in the nucleus (13Zhuang Y. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Shapiro D.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 457-466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Tzukerman M. Zhang X.-K. Herman T. Wills K.N. Graupner G. Pfahl M. New Biol. 1990; 2: 613-620PubMed Google Scholar), which would be inconsistent with stable interaction with hsp90. Taken together, the above results suggest that if the ER interacts with hsp90 in vivo, this interaction is transient, and that a significant concentration of homodimeric aporeceptor is present in the nucleus. Our results show that ER derivatives, which do not interact with hsp90 in vitro, can function as ligand-dependent transactivators in vivo. This occurs in spite of the fact that the VP16-GAL-ER chimeras contain an acidic activating domain which is strongly constitutively active when not tethered to the ER LBD. These results suggest that interaction with hsp90 in vivo is not essential for controlling ligand-dependent transactivation by the ER. It appears that the chimeras tested here are maintained in a transcriptionally repressed state in the absence of ligand, given that ligand induces transactivation to levels similar to those seen with the constitutive activator VP16-GAL. There are several potential candidates for a repressor. In yeast, HSP70 acts downstream of hsp90 to control ER and GR function (28Bohen S.P. Kralli A. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1995; 268: 1303-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). It is possible that molecules analogous to those that repress the thyroid hormone and retinoic acid receptors (29Hörlein A.J. Näär A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Söderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar, 30Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar) also act on the ER. A repressor may be specific or have a broad spectrum of effects on transcription similar to the yeast factor SSN6 (31McDonnell D.P. Vegeto E. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10563-10567Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Deletion analyses of the ER suggest that a putative repressor would interact with a region of the LBD between aa 370 and 470 (Fig. 3). The obvious function of a putative repressor would be to maintain DNA-bound apo-ER in a transcriptionally silent state. Hormone would stimulate dissociation of bound repressor, freeing the LBD for binding of transcriptional intermediary factors or coactivators (32Le Douarin B. Zechel C. Garnier J.-M. Lutz Y. Tora L.

Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar). In this model, antagonists would either bind the ER and not stimulate repressor dissociation, or bind, stimulate repressor dissociation, but maintain the LBD in a conformation not recognized by transcriptional intermediary factors. Repression of the ER would not only act to block the activity of the LBD but also the AF-1 domain in the N terminus, which can be activated by phosphorylation in the presence of hormone (35Ali S. Metzger D. Bornert J.-M. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1153-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) and which has the capacity to synergize with other classes of transactivators under certain conditions (21Tora L. White J.H. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). The potential activity of AF-1 would be dampened in cells where truncated receptors lacking the LBD display significant levels of constitutive activity (36Berry M. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2811-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). It is also noteworthy that aa 370-470 are adjacent to the region of the LBD (aa 300-330) identified as being important for binding of TATA box-binding protein-associated factor TAFII30, which is required for transactivation by the ER (37Jacq X.

A chemical mechanism has been proposed based on pH studies in which the α-amine of OAS must be unprotonated for optimum binding and formation of the external Schiff base; an enzyme group hydrogen-bonds the acetyl carbonyl to assist in the elimination of acetate, and the active site lysine that originally participated in the internal Schiff base linkage acts as a general base to abstract the α-proton (6Tai C.-H.

The first two cofactors produce active OASS species, whereas pyridoxal 5′-sulfate-reconstituted OASS is inactive. In this study, we make use of spectral probes and activity to study the effects of substitution of the native PLP cofactor with PDMP or 2′-Me-PLP. Spectral and kinetic properties are determined in the presence and absence of amino acid substrates and analogs and compared with those of the native enzyme to obtain further insight into the reaction pathway. Data suggest that subtle changes in the orientation of the bound cofactor can dramatically influence the activity of OASS. Results are consistent with the mechanism proposed for OASS-A (6Tai C.-H.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4776-4783Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The following timing sequence was used for the rapid scanning stopped-flow studies with PDMP-OASS, making use of a total acquisition time of 1.7 s. The 25 scans adhere to the following time points after flow is stopped: 2, 0.017 s; 4, 0.034 s; 6, 0.06 s; 8, 0.094 s; 10, 0.13 s; 12, 0.23 s; 15, 0.38 s; 20, 0.85 s; and 25, 1.7 s. The timing sequence for 2′-Me-PLP-OASS makes use of a total acquisition time of 18.7 s and the following times for the given spectra: 4, 0.034 s; 8, 0.27 s; 10, 0.425 s; 12, 0.94 s; 15, 1.7 s; 18, 4.25 s; 20, 5.95 s; 22, 11.05 s; 25, 18.7 s. All spectra were collected at 25°C as reported by Schnackerz et al. (9Schnackerz K.D. Tai C.-H. Simmons III, J.W. Jacobson T.M. Rao G.S.J. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12125-12160Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Data were fitted using the FORTRAN programs developed by Cleland (24Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar). Individual saturation curves for TNB and OAS obtained as a function of pH were fitted using Equation 1, whereas initial velocity patterns conforming to ping-pong and sequential kinetic mechanism were fitted using Equations 2 and 3, respectively. v=VA/(Ka+A)(Eq. 1) v=VAB/(KaB+KbA+AB)(Eq. 2) v=VAB/(KiaKb+KaB+KbA+AB)(Eq. 3) In Equations 1, 2, 3 v and V are initial and maximum velocities, respectively, A and B are reactant concentrations, Ka and Kb are Michaelis constants for A and B, respectively, and Kia is the inhibition constant for A. Data for the first order plots of ln A470 versus time used to quantitate deacetylase activity were fitted using the equation for a straight line, and the pH dependence of the first order rate constant was fitted using Equation 4. Data for the pH dependence of the log V/KTNB for 2′-Me-PLP-OASS which decreases at high and low pH with limiting slopes of −1 and 1, respectively, were fit using Equation 5.log y = log(C/[H/K1])(Eq. 4) log y = log(C/[1 + H/K1 + K2/H])(Eq. 5) In Equations 4 and 5, y is the observed value of the parameter at any pH, C is its pH-independent value, H is the hydrogen ion concentration, K1 and K2 are the estimated pK values for functional groups on reactant or enzyme. If the intermediate F, generated as a result of transfer of part of A to enzyme in a ping-pong kinetic mechanism, is unstable, the initial velocity pattern obtained in the absence of added inhibitors will intersect to the left of the ordinate, mimicking a sequential kinetic mechanism. Consider Mechanism 6 below where the intermediate F is converted to E at a rate within the time scale of the steady state assay. Derivation of the rate equation for the above was carried out using the method of King and Altman (25King E.L. Altman C. J. Phys. Chem. 1956; 60: 1375-1378Crossref Scopus (752) Google Scholar). The distribution equations for the enzyme forms depicted in Mechanism E6 are as follows: E/Et=k7k9Bk2+k3+k5k8+k9k2+k3/Δ(Eq. 7) EA/Et=k1k5Ak8+k9+k1k7k9AB/Δ(Eq. 8) F/Et=k1k3Ak8+k9/Δ(Eq. 9) FB/Et=k1k3k7AB/Δ(Eq. 10) where Δ is equal to the sum of all of the numerator terms in Equations 7, 8, 9, 10. The initial rate is defined as in Equation 11. v=k9[FB](Eq. 11) Substituting for FB and Δ gives Equation 12. v=k1k3k7k9ABEt/[k5(k8+k9)(k2+k3)+k1A(k8+k9)(k3+k5)+k7k9B(k2+k3)+k1k7AB(k3+k9)](Eq. 12) Note that unlike the normal rate equation for a ping-pong kinetic mechanism, the denominator of the rate equation includes a constant term. Expressions for the kinetic parameters (V/Et)′, (V/KaEt)′, (V/KbEt)′, and V/KiaKbEt are given in Equations 13, 14, 15, 16. For comparison, the same parameters obtained for a ping-pong mechanism in which F is stable on the steady state time scale are provided in italics (the ′ is used to distinguish the rate constants obtained for Mechanism 6). (In all cases, the parameters obtained for Mechanism 6 reduce to those in italics when k5 is set equal to 0.)V/Et′=k3k9/k3+k9 V/Et=k3k9/k3+k9(Eq. 13) V/KaEt′=k1k3/k2+k3 V/KaEt=k1k3/k2+k3(Eq. 14) V/KbEt′=k3k7k9/k8+k9k3+k5 V/KbEt=k7k9/k8+k9(Eq. 15) V/KiaKibEt=k1k3k7k9/k5k8+k9k2+k3 None(Eq. 16) The difference between the two mechanisms lies in the rate constant for the second half-reaction, V/KbEt, and the presence of the V/KiaKbEt term. The rate of the first half-reaction at limiting A is unaffected, since k5 occurs after release of the first product. In addition, V is unaffected, since at an infinite concentration of B, no F is present. The rate of the second half-reaction at limiting B, however, is affected since the amount of F present to combine with B depends on the rate of conversion of F to E via the step represented by k5. The V/KiaKbEt term, on closer inspection, is the product of the V/K values for a ping-pong mechanism with stable F (italic Equations 14 and 15), divided by the rate constant for leakage of F to E. The constant term thus reflects the decrease in the rate when both reactants are limiting as a result of the step denoted by k5 continually regenerating E. As a result, an E term is effectively generated in the denominator of the rate equation in addition to the that represented by the V/Ka in a normal ping-pong mechanism. The product of the (V/K)′ values divided by V/KiaKbEt effectively subtracts out the rate of the normal ping-pong reaction giving the maximum rate of the deacetylase reaction.[(V/KaEt)′][(V/KbEt)′]/[V/KiaKbEt]=Vdeacetylase/Et=k3k5/(k3+k5)(Eq. 17) It is also instructive to look at the expressions for the Michaelis constants. The ratio of V and the V/K of each of the reactants gives the following expressions for the Km values. (Ka)′=Kia(1+k3/k2)(1+k3/k9)Ka=Kia(1+k3/k2)/(1+K3/K9)(Eq. 18) (Kb)′=Kib[(1+k9/k8)/(1+k3/k9)](k3+k5)/k9; Kb=Kib(1+k9/k8)/(1+K3/K9)(Eq. 19) where Kia and Kib are k2/k1 and k8/k7, respectively. As expected, it is Kb that is affected, modified by the ratio (k3+ k5)/k9, and since k5 must, by definition be of the same order of magnitude as k3, k9, (Kb)′ will be greater than Kb. The PDMP-reconstituted OASS-A (PDMP-OASS) is bright yellow-green in color and exhibits a typical PLP enzyme spectrum as shown in Fig. 1A. The λmax for the protonated internal Schiff base band (3Cook P.F. Hara S. Nalabolu S. Schnackerz K.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2298-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) is 418 nm, and A280/A418 is 3.7. Addition of 1 mM OAS results in a decrease in the absorbance at 280 and 418 nm, concomitant with the appearance of new bands at <250, 330 and 478 nm, respectively. The latter two bands signal formation of the α-aminoacrylate intermediate (2Becker M.A. Kredich N.M. Tomkins G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2418-2427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Cook P.F. Hara S. Nalabolu S. Schnackerz K.D.

In both cases, bands are red-shifted by 8-10 nm compared with native enzyme. L-Cysteine addition to PDMP-OASS results in a mixture of species with the absorbance at 418 nm decreased and the appearance of new bands at about 330, 430, and 478 nm, Fig. 1A. A similar phenomenon is observed upon addition of 80 mM L-serine (data not shown). Higher concentrations of cysteine and serine or longer times give no further absorbance changes. Data are summarized in Table I and compared with native (PLP) OASS.Table IComparison ofn the spectral properties of native and cofactor-substituted OASS-AAdditionspHUV-visible absorbanceλmax 1ϵλmax 2ϵM-1 cm-1M-1 cm-1Native(PLP)74127,6001 mM OAS74709,7603206,2504 mMCys9418784040 mM Ser94184,0003304,000PDMP74187,100174788,8003308,5004 mM Cys94306,8004784,00040 mM Ser94306,8004784,0002′-Me-PLP74127,6001 mM OAS74704,3004184,8004 mM Cys94187,840AdditionsFluorescenceλmax 1Rel.

The 2′-Me-PLP-reconstituted OASS-A (2′-Me-PLP-OASS) has a yellow color and exhibits a spectrum identical to the native enzyme, Fig. 1B. Addition of 1 mM OAS, Fig. 1B, or 4 mM L-cysteine give spectral changes identical to those obtained for the native enzyme (9Schnackerz K.D. Tai C.-H. Simmons III, J.W. Jacobson T.M. Rao G.S.J. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12125-12160Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar), while addition of 80 mM L-serine gives no effect. Data are summarized in Table I. As an indicator of cofactor orientation in the cofactor-substituted enzymes, the fluorescence emission spectra of PDMP-OASS were obtained in the absence and presence of 250 mM acetate at pH 8 (the Kd for acetate at pH 8). The fluorescence emission spectrum for PDMP-OASS is shown in Fig. 2A. Both the band for intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (λmax, 337 nm) and the long wavelength band resulting from cofactor ketoenamine fluorescence (λmax, 505 nm) are observed (10Strambini G.B. Cioni P. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8392-8400Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 26McClure Jr., G.D. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1674-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Addition of 250 mM acetate results in an enhancement of the long wavelength band and a blue shift of the maximum fluorescence (λmax, 492 nm) such that F337/F492 is 0.7, Fig. 2A. Excitation at 418 nm also gives a 505 nm emission band with an intensity 4 times that observed upon excitation at 298 nm. The fluorescence emission spectrum for 2′-Me-PLP-OASS, in the absence of acetate, gives a 337 nm emission band, but the long wavelength band is of low intensity and very broad, ranging from <400 to about 550 nm, Fig. 2B. The ratio of F337/F500 is about 13, compared with a value of 8 obtained for native enzyme. Addition of 250 mM acetate results in no enhancement of the long wavelength band. Data are summarized in Table I. The far UV CD of the native OASS (9Schnackerz K.D. Tai C.-H. Simmons III, J.W. Jacobson T.M. Rao G.S.J. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12125-12160Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar) is superimposable on those of the PDMP- or 2′-Me-PLP-OASS (data not shown). The induced CD data obtained for the PDMP-OASS-A are identical to those of native enzyme, Fig. 3A, with a red shift in the λmax values. The sign of the Cotton effect and molar ellipticity of the visible CD spectrum of the free 2′-Me-PLP enzyme are also identical to those of the native enzyme, Fig. 3B (9Schnackerz K.D. Tai C.-H. Simmons III, J.W. Jacobson T.M. Rao G.S.J. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12125-12160Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Addition of OAS gives a significant decrease in the ellipticity at 412 nm, with an increase in the negative ellipticity at 470 nm. However, the change observed at 470 nm is only 25% that obtained with the native enzyme, whereas the absorbance spectrum of the 2′-Me-PLP enzyme in the presence of OAS gives an increase at 470 nm which is 50% that observed with the native or PDMP-substituted enzymes. Data are summarized in Table I. The initial velocity pattern measured for the PDMP enzyme depends on the pH at which it is measured. At all pH values >6.5, the initial velocity pattern intersects to the left of the ordinate, Fig. 4, but at pH 6 the pattern is nearly a series of parallel lines, data not shown. The intersecting initial velocity pattern is indicative of a rapid deacetylase activity for the PDMP-OASS-A compared with the rate of the second half-reaction. The latter will be discussed in detail under the “Discussion.” The PDMP-OASS is a poor enzyme using TNB as the nucleophilic substrate (pH 7), with V/KOAS and V/KTNB values only 23 and 31% those of native OASS-A, while with sulfide as the nucleophilic substrate (pH 6.5), percent V/KOAS and V/Ksulfide values are 11 and 1%, respectively. The value of V using TNB as the nucleophilic substrate is 1% that obtained for the native enzyme. Kinetic parameters are summarized in Table II. In contrast, the V/Et values for the PDMP-aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) is 5% that of native enzyme (15Miura R. Metzler C.M. Metzler D.E. Arch. Biochem.

The 2′-Me-PLP-OASS with TNB as the nucleophilic substrate (pH 7) gives values of 75 and 22% those of native enzyme for V/KOAS and V/KTNB, respectively, whereas with sulfide as the nucleophilic substrate (pH 6.5), V/KOAS and V/Ksulfide values are 0.1 and 0.2%, Table II. The V/KTNB for the PDMP-OASS-A decreases at low pH giving a pK value of about 6.7 (data not shown), with a pH-independent value of about 300 ± 30 M−1 s−1, compared with a value of 1000 M−1 s−1 for native enzyme (5Tai C.-H. Nalabolu S.R. Jacobson T.M. Minter D.E. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6433-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The V/KOAS is pH-independent over the pH range 6-7.5 with a value of about 8.6 ± 0.5 M−1 s−1, Fig. 5, compared with a value of about 100 M−1 s−1 for native enzyme (5Tai C.-H. Nalabolu S.R. Jacobson T.M. Minter D.E. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6433-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The value of V/Et at pH 7 is (5.0 ± 0.2) × 10−3 s−1. Data for the 2′-Me-PLP-OASS-A are qualitatively similar to those reported previously for the native enzyme (6Tai C.-H. Nalabolu S.R. Simmons III, J.W. Jacobson T.M. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12311-12322Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The V/KTNB pH profile is bell-shaped with pK values of 6.0 ± 0.6 and 7.6 ± 0.3, while V/KOAS decreases at low pH over the same pH range as observed for native enzyme (data not shown). pH-independent values of the two kinetic parameters are 200 and 30 M−1 s−1, respectively. The pH dependence of the first order rate constant for the PDMP-OASS-catalyzed deacetylase activity exhibits a limiting slope of 1 at low pH giving an estimated pK of 7.9 ± 0.1, and a pH-independent value of 0.01 ± 0.001 s−1 (data not shown), compared with a value of 0.1 s−1 obtained for native enzyme (3Cook P.F. Hara S. Nalabolu S. Schnackerz K.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2298-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The pH dependence of the deacetylase activity of the 2′-Me-PLP-OASS is qualitatively identical, giving a pK of 8.2 ± 0.2 and a pH-independent value of 0.020 ± 0.002 s−1 for the first order rate constant (data not shown). The deuterium isotope effect on V/KOAS was obtained for both PDMP- and 2′-Me-PLP-OASS-A using α-deuterio-O-acetyl-L-serine stereospecifically deuterated on the α-carbon (8Hwang C.-C. Woehl E.U. Dunn M.F. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6358-6365Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Since it is difficult to maintain TNB saturating because of its high extinction coefficient, and data for both enzymes adhere to a ping-pong kinetic mechanism below 6.5, data were collected at pH 6.09, where values of 1.4 ± 0.2 and 4.7 ± 0.3 were obtained for D(V/KOAS) for PDMP- and 2′-Me-PLP-OASS-A, respectively. Values of 4.3 ± 0.4 and 4.7 ± 0.7 for D(V/KOAS) were also obtained for 2′-Me-PLP-OASS-A at pH 7.02 and 6.47. The secondary deuterium isotope effect measured for PDMP-OASS-A with OAS-3,3-d2 at pH 6.09 is 0.92 ± 0.10 with TNB as the nucleophilic substrate and 0.95 ± 0.03 with sulfide as the substrate, whereas the secondary isotope effect obtained for 2′-Me-PLP-OASS-A at pH 6.09 is 1.12 ± 0.06. Reactions of PDMP-OASS-A with OAS are shown in Fig. 6A, where spectrum 0 is the spectrum for enzyme prior to adding OAS. Upon addition of OAS, the 418-nm absorption band of the free PDMP enzyme resulting from the internal Schiff base (3Cook P.F. Hara S. Nalabolu S. Schnackerz K.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2298-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) is shifted slightly to higher wavelength as seen in the value of the λmax for spectra 6-10 versus spectrum 0, and the lack of a single isosbestic point for the spectra 0-10. The rapid shift in the wavelength reflecting formation of the external Schiff base of OAS (9Schnackerz K.D. Tai C.-H. Simmons III, J.W. Jacobson T.M. Rao G.S.J. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12125-12160Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar) is followed by a decrease in the absorbance at 418-425 with the concomitant appearance of new bands at 330 and 478 nm resulting from formation of the α-aminoacrylate intermediate. Spectrum 25 shows the equilibrium mixture of species after reaction for about 1.7 s. Changes observed at 470 nm give an estimated rate constant of 5 s−1 for formation of the α-aminoacrylate intermediate. The α-aminoacrylate intermediate builds up as the product of the first half-reaction in the absence of the second product, TNB or sulfide. Addition of the second substrate results in a rapid bleaching of the 330- and 470-nm bands (7Woehl E.U. Tai C.-H. Dunn M.F. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4776-4783Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Reactions of 2′-Me-PLP-OASS-A with OAS are shown in Fig. 6B and are qualitatively identical to those shown for PDMP-OASS-A. Spectrum 0 shows mainly the free enzyme absorbing maximally at 412 nm, and spectrum 25 shows the equilibrium mixture of species after reaction for about 18.7 s. The reaction is slow because the concentration of OAS is well below the Km for OAS which is ≥10 mM. There are several pieces of information that indicate how substitution of PDMP for PLP has changed the mechanism of the OASS-A. The V/Et for PDMP-OASS has decreased 100-fold relative to native enzyme using TNB as the nucleophilic substrate, while V/KOAS has decreased only by a factor of 5. Nonetheless, the rapid scanning stopped-flow studies indicate that, just as for native enzyme, the abstraction of the α-proton is rate-determining, and primary and secondary deuterium kinetic isotope effects suggest that the transition state for α-proton abstraction may even be slightly earlier than that of the native enzyme, which exhibits an intrinsic primary deuterium isotope effect of 2.8 and a β-secondary deuterium isotope effect of 1.1 (8Hwang C.-C. Woehl E.U. Dunn M.F. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6358-6365Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). (The observed isotope effects are intrinsic based on the pH dependence of the isotope effects and the demonstrated rate-limitation of α-proton abstraction of the cofactor-substituted enzymes.) Thus, there appears to be only about 1% of the external Schiff base of OAS that is able at any given time to produce the α-aminoacrylate intermediate, in equilibrium with 99% that is not capable of undergoing the α,β-elimination reaction at a given time. 2The assumption is made that the concerted α,β-elimination is synchronous, i.e. that Cβ-O bond cleavage occurs at the same time and to the same extent as Cα-H bond cleavage. The latter is a reasonable assumption if the acetate leaving group is held orthogonal to the forming α,β-double bond, and there is no quinonoid. In support of the lack of quinonoid, the pyridinium nitrogen of the coenzyme is unprotonated and hydrogen-bonded to an enzyme serine, suggesting that the pyridinium does not play a Lewis acid role (P. Burkhard and J. N. Jansonius, unpublished). Leaving group oxygen-18 isotope effects are planned to further define the α,β-elimination reaction. If the transition state is earlier for the PDMP enzyme based on the assumed synchronous concerted reaction, the above data suggest that the α,β-elimination reaction of PDMP-OASS is perhaps even more facile than that catalyzed by native OASS. (Even if the reaction is not completely synchronous it is unlikely to affect the interpretation significantly.) The remaining question is why only 1% of the OAS external Schiff base is converted to product at any given time? The answer likely lies in the only difference between the pH profiles for the PDMP-OASS and the native enzyme, i.e. the lack of a pH dependence of the V/K for OAS at low pH. The mechanism proposed for OASS-A is shown in Scheme 1. The group that interacts with the acetyl side chain of OAS has a pK of about 6.7 in native OASS-A and has been proposed to act by holding acetate orthogonal to the plane of the aldimine, facilitating β-elimination (6Tai C.-H. Nalabolu S.R. Simmons III, J.W. Jacobson T.M. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12311-12322Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The inability of the group to carry out its function in the PDMP-OASS reaction may allow the side chain to be in all orientations, being properly positioned for elimination only 1% of the time. Eventually all of the external Schiff base will produce the α-aminoacrylate intermediate, but only 1% at any given time. Data obtained with the PDMP-OASS-A thus support the role proposed for the enzyme group with a pK of 6.5. The above enzyme group must also be protonated for the second half-reaction and is observed in the V/KTNB pH profile of the PDMP-OASS. Therefore, the second half-reaction likely functions in a manner similar to that of native OASS-A. Finally, the pK of the active site lysine (determined from the pH dependence of the deacetylase activity (3Cook P.F. Hara S. Nalabolu S. Schnackerz K.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2298-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar)) that acts as a general base in the α,β-elimination reaction is within error identical for PDMP-OASS and native enzyme. The 2′-Me-PLP-OASS is kinetically similar to the native enzyme. Although the enzyme still utilizes TNB effectively, the natural reaction with OAS and sulfide is now very poor with V/K values 3 orders of magnitude lower than those of the native enzyme. The difference in the utilization of the bulky aromatic TNB and of the smaller sulfide indicates a change in the binding sites for the two nucleophilic substrates. The decrease in steady state rate discussed above is accompanied by an increase in the primary deuterium isotope effect from a value of 2.8 for the native enzyme to a value of 4.5 for 2′-Me-PLP-OASS. The primary deuterium effect is pH-independent from 6.09 to 7.02. In the case of native OASS-A, the V/KOAS decreases below pH 7 (6Tai C.-H. Nalabolu S.R. Simmons III, J.W. Jacobson T.M. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12311-12322Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), while the value of D(V/KOAS) increases from a value of 1.7 to a value of 2.8 over the same pH range (8Hwang C.-C. Woehl E.U. Dunn M.F. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6358-6365Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The latter indicates that OAS is sticky, 3A sticky substrate is one for which the EA complex favors product formation as opposed to dissociation to free substrate. while the lack of a pH dependence of D(V/KOAS) for the 2′-Me-PLP enzyme indicates that it is not. In agreement with the latter conclusion, rapid-scanning stopped-flow data exhibit a slow formation of the α-aminoacrylate intermediate from the rapidly formed external Schiff base. The secondary isotope effect utilizing OAS-3,3-d2, however, is only 1.1, indicating an early transition state for α-proton abstraction, assuming a synchronous concerted mechanism (8Hwang C.-C. Woehl E.U. Dunn M.F. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6358-6365Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The difference in primary intrinsic deuterium isotope effects of 2.8 for the native enzyme and 4.5 for the 2′-Me-PLP enzyme reflects either a difference in the amount of hydrogen tunneling, nature of the transition state, or both. Since the secondary isotope effect is identical to that obtained for the native enzyme, the increase in the primary deuterium isotope effect likely reflects an increase in hydrogen tunneling resulting from a decrease in the length of the reaction coordinate. The latter may be brought about by a steric effect of the 2′-methyl group of the cofactor, and this aspect is now being investigated. As discussed under “Results,” initial velocity patterns measured for the PDMP enzyme depend on the pH at which it is measured. Above pH 6, the initial velocity pattern intersects to the left of the ordinate, while at pH 6 the pattern is parallel, consistent with the proposed ping-pong mechanism (4Cook P.F. Wedding R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2023-2029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Tai C.-H. Nalabolu S.R. Jacobson T.M. Minter D.E. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6433-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The intersecting initial velocity pattern is indicative of a rapid deacetylase activity for the PDMP-OASS-A relative to the net rate constant for the second half-reaction at limiting concentrations of TNB. As the pH decreases, the rate constant for the deacetylase decreases below a pK of 7.9, and at pH 6 is no longer significant with respect to the rate of the second half-reaction. A calculation of the maximum rate constant for the deacetylase activity, k3k5/(k3+ k5) according to Equation 17, gives values that range from 0.008 to 0.012 s−1 at pH 7. The rate constant k5, which reflects the deacetylase activity, has a pH-independent value of 0.01 s−1, which would give a value of 0.001 s−1 at pH 7. Data would thus suggest that the maximum rate of the deacetylase reaction, obtained by definition at limiting TNB concentration, is limited by the rate of breakdown of F (the α-aminoacrylate intermediate) to pyruvate and ammonia, which is k5. In agreement with the suggested limitation by k5, k3 is estimated at about 5 s−1 from rapid-scanning stopped-flow studies. The latter allows a determination of the rate-limiting step in the overall reaction of OAS and TNB to give acetate and S-CNP-L-cysteine, given by Equation 13, k3k9/(k3+ k9), and estimated as 0.005 s−1, Table I. Since k3 is 5 s−1, k9 must be 0.005 s−1, the limiting step for the overall reaction, which includes nucleophilic attack by TNB on the α-aminoacrylate intermediate to form the S-CNP-cysteine external Schiff base and release of the product amino acid, Scheme 1. It is likely the former that limits the overall rate. Based on the above considerations, the V/K for the second half-reaction given by Equation 15 reduces to k9/KiTNB, where KiTNB is k8/k7. Thus, the deacetylase activity will be important even at the highest concentrations used in these studies (1/6 the Km value for TNB), which gives a value of 0.0008 s−1 compared with the effective value of 0.001 s−1 for the deacetylase rate. The absorbance, fluorescence, and CD spectral properties of the PDMP-OASS are remarkably similar to those of the native enzyme. Data suggest that the gross structure (far UV CD and intrinsic Trp fluorescence) of the cofactor-substituted enzyme and the general symmetry of the bound cofactor (visible CD) are for all intents and purposes identical to those of native (PLP) OASS-A. In addition, the UV-visible absorbance and cofactor fluorescence spectra are qualitatively identical to those of native enzyme. There are slight differences in the extinction coefficients of the spectral bands in the absence and presence of OAS in the PDMP-OASS that indicate a change in the equilibrium distribution of Schiff base tautomers, Table I."

In this study, we demonstrated that the neurofilament-L (NF-L) mRNA and protein levels of these cells were enhanced in accordance with their retinoic acid-induced neural differentiation. Okadaic acid (OA) treatment of the cells markedly suppressed this differentiation-dependent NF-L gene expression increase and neurite outgrowth of the cells. Similar results were obtained when tautomycin was used instead of OA, suggesting that inhibition of protein phosphatase(s) is involved in the suppression of neural differentiation. OA treatment did not affect the NF-L gene transcription level, determined by the nuclear run-on transcription assay, but it did reduce the stability of both the 3.5- and 2.3-kilobase NF-L mRNAs. The expression and activity levels of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and 2B (PP2B) but not protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) in P19 cells increased in accordance with the enhanced NF-L gene expression. The presence of OA in the culture medium during the course of the neural differentiation caused a reduced PP2A activity but not PP1 and PP2B activities of the cell extracts. On the other hand, both PP1 and PP2B activities but not PP2A activity of cell extracts were suppressed by the addition of cyclosporin A or FK506 in the culture medium. However, both cyclosporin A and FK506 treatments affected neither NF-L gene expression nor neurite outgrowth. These results demonstrate that the OA treatment inhibits the differentiation-dependent increase in NF-L gene expression by destabilizing its mRNAs and suggest that PP2A plays key roles in the differentiation-dependent enhanced expression of the NF-L gene and is the point of the action of OA."

Ethylene, a simple organic molecule with complex biological function, has profound and versatile effects on the growth and development of higher plants. These effects include promoting fruit ripening, flower senescence, and petal and leaf abscissions, inhibiting seedling elongation, stimulating root initiation, promoting initiation of the flowering of pineapples, and increasing latex flow in rubber trees (for review, see 1Lieberman M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1979; 30: 533-591Crossref Google Scholar and 2Yang S.F. Hoffman N.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1984; 35: 155-189Crossref Google Scholar). To manipulate the extent of the ethylene effect on these agricultural and horticultural crops, many registered chemical compounds such as aminoethoxyvinylglycine (an inhibitor of ethylene biosynthesis), silver thiosulfate (an inhibitor of ethylene action), and ethephon (an ethylene-releasing compound), were developed (3Maynard J.A. Swan J.M. Aust. J. Chem. 1963; 16: 596-608Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 4Owens L.D. Lieberman M. Kunishi A. Plant Physiol. 1971; 48: 1-4Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

However, elucidation of the ethylene biosynthesis pathway in higher plants and recent successful cloning of the key genes involved in the ethylene biosynthesis have offered a good opportunity to either enhance or repress endogenous ethylene production via genetic engineering.

Mattoo A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6908-6917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The column was mounted onto a medium-pressure fast protein liquid chromatography system (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and run at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The column was calibrated using the native protein markers and blue dextran (2,000 kDa) purchased from the Pharmacia. A molecular mass standard curve was established using the semilog method based on data obtained from the gel filtration analysis of the molecular mass markers. The ACC synthase and ACC oxidase activity assays were performed according to the methods described previously (7Boller T. Herner R.C. Kende H. Planta. 1979; 145: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 8Yu Y. Adams A.D. Yang S.F. Arch. Biochem.

Biochem. 1979; 100: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). Bifunction of the ACSO fusion enzyme is defined as the catalytic activities of both ACC synthase and ACC oxidase present in the same fusion polypeptide. The bifunctional activities of the fusion enzyme were assayed with 10 to 200 μl of the crude or Mono Q column-purified enzyme extract. The reaction was performed at 30°C for 30 min with constant shaking in a 4-ml test tube, which contained, in a total volume of 0.5 ml, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 20 μM PLP, 30 mM sodium ascorbate, 20 mM sodium bicarbonate, 20 μM ferrous sulfate, and 20% glycerol. To make a hybrid enzyme possessing both ACC synthase and ACC oxidase activities, we selected a soybean ACC synthase and a tomato ACC oxidase as the constituents of this hybrid enzyme. Soybean ACC synthase cDNA (GMCACCS1) and tomato ACC oxidase cDNA (LEETHYBR or pCR13) were prepared by PCR. The 1.5-kb PCR product coding for the 484-aa long soybean ACC synthase was first cloned into the 3.9-kb pCR™ II cloning vector (Invitrogen BV, The Netherlands). This chimeric plasmid DNA was then digested by restriction enzymes, EcoRV and BamHI. A 54-nucleotide DNA fragment was cleaved from the 3′ end of the ACC synthase cDNA, which resulted in the deletion of 18 aa from the C terminus of ACC synthase. This double-digested chimeric DNA plasmid DNA was then ligated to a 0.9-kb DNA fragment encoding tomato ACC oxidase and treated with the same two restriction enzymes. This recombinant DNA plasmid (6.25 kb) was then double-digested by NdeI and BamHI. The resultant 2.35-kb recombinant DNA encoding the C-terminal truncated soybean ACC synthase (aa 1-466) and the N-terminal truncated tomato ACC oxidase (aa 4-316) was inserted into an expression vector, pET14b (Novagen, Madison, WI) (Fig. 1A), pretreated with NdeI and BamHI. This insertion created a fusion of a short polypeptide with an array of 6 histidines, His-tag (34Smith M.C. Furman T.C. Ingolia C. Pidgeon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7211-7215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), attached to the N terminus of the hybrid enzyme created by the first fusion of soybean ACC synthase and tomato ACC oxidase (Fig. 1A). The E. coli, BL21(DE3), harboring the pET14b-ACSO chimeric plasmid expressed a 90 ± -kDa fusion polypeptide, as determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blot (Fig. 1B), which was consistent with the expected size of the fusion enzyme (87.8 kDa) calculated from the fusion protein primary sequence. Aside from the dominant form (>90%) of the intact His-tagged ACSO fusion enzyme detected in the crude extract, three minor polypeptides of smaller size were also observed (Fig. 1B). The crude E. coli fusion protein extract possesses both ACC synthase (46 nmol h−1 mg−1) and ACC oxidase activities (0.4 nmol h−1 mg−1). The level of ACSO expression in E. coli was estimated to be less than 1%. Because of the presence of some smaller size polypeptides in the ACSO enzyme extract cross-reacting with the His-tag-binding Ni2+-NTA/alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Fig. 1B, lane 4), the bifunctional activities detected in the crude fusion protein extract could come either from the intact fusion enzyme or from the proteolytically cleaved ACSO fusion enzymes. Using the Mono Q column, the three polypeptides of smaller sizes cross-reacting with Ni2+-NTA/alkaline phosphatase conjugate were removed (Fig. 1B, lane 5). To verify that both ACC synthase and ACC oxidase activities found in the fusion enzyme crude extract were actually from the 90-kDa fusion enzyme, the fusion enzyme in the crude enzyme extract was further analyzed using a gel filtration column (see “Experimental Procedures”). Each fraction (0.4 ml) was assayed for both ACC synthase and ACC oxidase activity. It was found that both ACC synthase and ACC oxidase activities peaked at the same elution position (Fig. 2A). The specific activity of ACC synthase and ACC oxidase in the peak fraction were determined to be 9.9 μmol h−1 mg−1 and 6.0 nmol h−1 mg−1, respectively. The ACC synthase and ACC oxidase specific activity of the partially enriched fusion enzyme increased 214- and 15-fold, respectively, as compared to that in the crude extract. The disparity (14-fold) in enrichment between the two enzyme activities was thought to be the consequence of either the instability of ACC oxidase activity or the increased ACC synthase activity during the purification processes or both. Based on gel filtration, the molecular mass of the native fusion enzyme was determined to be 360 ± 21 kDa, suggesting that the expressed fusion enzyme is oligomeric rather than monomeric (Fig. 2A). To verify whether the fusion polypeptide was indeed present in the fractions of peak activity, we analyzed the enzyme eluant collected from the peak fractions on SDS-PAGE and performed a Western blot analysis of the protein samples using probes of both the Ni2+-NTA/alkaline phosphatase conjugate and the polyclonal antibodies raised against the tomato ACC oxidase. As expected, there was only one 90-kDa polypeptide cross-reacting with the two probes in the peak fractions (Fig. 2B). Thus, the 90-kDa in-frame fusion enzyme is indeed the subunit of the oligomeric ACSO complex, confirming that the oligomeric fusion enzyme is bifunctional. Since the fusion enzyme, ACSO, has both ACC synthase and ACC oxidase activities, we anticipate that the fusion enzyme should be capable of catalyzing the sequential reactions from AdoMet to ethylene via ACC when appropriate cofactors or cosubstrates are supplemented. We first incubated the crude fusion enzyme with 1 mM AdoMet supplemented with all the known cofactors and cosubstrates necessary for both ACC synthase and ACC oxidase activities under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures,” and measured the synthesis of ACC as well as ethylene (Fig. 3) in the test tube. It was found that the concentration of ACC peaked at 5 min (2.6 nmol mg−1) and then declined. At the same time, the ethylene level began to increase (Fig. 3). By 30 min of reaction, 71.0 pmol of ethylene had been produced by 1 mg of the fusion enzyme and the concentration of ACC in the reaction mixture was 3.9 μM. The C terminus of tomato ACC synthase was shown to be dispensable in terms of maintaining activity (32Li N. Mattoo A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6908-6917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We reasoned that addition of a polypeptide to the C terminus of ACC synthase should not result in an inactive enzyme. The experiment conducted here has proven this to be the case. Addition of a stretch of six consecutive histidines (His-tag) to the N terminus of ACC synthase did not abolish the bifunctionality of the fusion enzyme. Since a deletion of N or C termini of ACC synthase affects the enzyme kinetics (32Li N. Mattoo A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6908-6917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Li N. Huxtable S. Yang S.F. Kung S.D. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the possibility that this fusion might change the kinetic properties of both enzymes cannot be ruled out. The actual alteration in enzymatic kinetics of the fusion enzyme awaits further investigation. It is to be noted that specific activity of ACC oxidase is much lower than that of ACC synthase in the fusion enzyme. Such a disparity is consistent with the previous observation that the native ACC oxidase has much lower intrinsic catalytic power than that of ACC synthase (10Dong J.G. Ferná;ndez-Maculet C.J. Yang S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9789-9793Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). For example, the catalytic constants (kcat) for apple ACC synthase and ACC oxidase are 9.2 and 0.013 s−1, respectively (10Dong J.G. Ferná;ndez-Maculet C.J. Yang S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9789-9793Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 16White M.F. Vasquez J. Yang S.F. Kirsch J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, they differ in catalytic power by a factor of about 700. However, this disparity can be partially compensated by the fact that in plant tissues ACC oxidase is several hundred times more abundant than ACC synthase. In apple fruit, it was estimated that the ACC synthase level is about 0.002% of total cellular protein (36Yip W.K. Dong J.G. Yang S.F. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), whereas the ACC oxidase level is about 0.56% (10Dong J.G. Ferná;ndez-Maculet C.J. Yang S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9789-9793Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The enzyme assay conditions for ACC synthase and ACC oxidase have been individually established before (7Boller T. Herner R.C. Kende H. Planta. 1979; 145: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 8Yu Y. Adams A.D. Yang S.F. Arch. Biochem.

To assay for ethylene production of ACSO, the substrate AdoMet, cosubstrate ascorbic acid and cofactors PLP, ferrous iron, and bicarbonate necessary for both ACC synthase and ACC oxidase were added to the reaction mixture. Although the combined reaction mixture has proven to be working (Fig. 3), the optimal reaction conditions for ACSO remains to be worked out. The 360-kDa fusion enzyme complex determined by gel filtration is about 4 times the size of the ACC synthase subunit (90 kDa), suggesting that this fusion enzyme is probably tetrameric. This is unexpected because ACC oxidase was reported to be a monomer (10Dong J.G. Ferná;ndez-Maculet C.J. Yang S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9789-9793Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) whereas ACC synthase could be either a monomer or a dimer (32Li N. Mattoo A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6908-6917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Satoh S. Mori H. Imaseki H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1993; 34: 753-760Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 38Hohenester E. White M.F. Kirsch J.F. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 947-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To clarify this point, we are in a process of purifying this fusion enzyme to homogeneity for further biochemical and biophysical characterization. This ethylene-generating fusion enzyme is anticipated to be useful for research in molecular biology, developmental biology, and biotechnology. Ethylene could also be used as a new class of gaseous reporter for monitoring the gene expression in a heterologous model system because the method for measuring gaseous ethylene is simple, fast, sensitive, and nondestructive (5Abeles F.B.

Human α2-macroglobulin (α2M) 1The abbreviations used are: α2Mα2-macroglobulinRBDreceptor-binding domainEMelectron microscopeDOPdirection of projection. is a plasmatic homotetrameric glycoprotein (720 kDa) assembled from two pairs of disulfide-bridged 180-kDa identical subunits. This molecule inhibits endopeptidases by a “trap mechanism” (1Barrett A.J. Starkey P.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 709-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Proteinases are caught and internalized into α2M after a specific proteolysis of a “bait region” followed by hydrolysis of a β-cysteinyl-γ-glutamyl thiol ester bond (review in 2Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11539-11542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The thiol ester cleavage induces a covalent binding of the protease mainly through ϵ-Lys(proteinase)-γ-Glu(α2M) cross-link and induces an important conformational change of the α2M molecule leading to the transformed state. The transformation is responsible for the exposure of receptor-binding domains (RBDs) (3Van Leuven F. Marynen P. Cassiman J-J. Van den Berghe H. J. Biol.

Biol. 1994; 113: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Several models were proposed to describe the structural transformation of human α2M. A first model described the molecule as a “hollow cylinder” whose bases were supposed to be open and closed in the native and transformed states, respectively (18Feldman S.R. Gonias S.L. Pizzo S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5700-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Despite its didactic quality, this model was partially based on erroneous data. Indeed, the two types of EM views that the model intended to explain did not belong to native and transformed α2M, as suggested by Schramm and Schramm (19Schramm H.J. Schramm W. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1982; 363: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but to the H and end-on views of the transformed molecule, as demonstrated by Tapon-Bretaudière et al. (20Tapon-Bretaudière J. Bros A. Couture-Tosi E. Delain E. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 85-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Stoops et al. (21Stoops J.K. Bretaudière J.P. Strickland D.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 161: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A second model derived from the observation of human α2M blocked at an intermediate stage of transformation by cis-dichlorodiammineplatinium II (22Gonias S.L. Figler N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9565-9570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Marshall L.B. Figler N.L. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6347-6352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that the molecule is subjected to an elongation leading to the exposition of the RBDs. Relying on immunoelectron microscopy (24Delain E. Pochon F. Barray M. van Leuven F. Electron Microsc. Rev. 1992; 5: 231-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), another model proposed that the flat lateral walls result from the unrolling of cylindrical dimeric half-molecules. These models are contradictory and additional information is required to understand the structural transformation of human α2M. In this paper, we present refined three-dimensional reconstructions of native and transformed human α2M that share enough structural elements to align them in common orientations. The comparison of both architectures suggests a new model for the structural transformation. Native human α2M was prepared from fresh frozen plasma (Centre National de Transfusion Sanguine, Paris) by Zn2+ affinity chromatography (25Kurechi T. Kress L.F. Laskowski Sr., M. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 99: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and Ultrogel AcA 22 (Sepracor, Villeneuve la Garenne, France) filtration as a final step of purification. The transformed conformation was obtained by incubation of native α2M for 3 h with 200 mM methylamine, in a 200 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl. The excess of reagent was removed by gel filtration on Ultrogel AcA 34 (Sepracor). The sample was diluted at a concentration of 120 μg/ml in 20 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.2, 50 mM NaCl and applied on a 300-mesh copper grid covered with a thin holey carbon film. After removing excess solution, the grid was rapidly frozen by the blotting method (26Adrian M. Dubochet J. Lepault J. McDowall A.W. Nature. 1984; 308: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar), using liquid ethane as freezing agent. Cryoelectron microscopy was done with a Philips CM12 electron microscope equipped with a low dose kit, an eucentric goniometer, a Gatan cryo-stage, and a Gatan cryotransfer device. Each specimen field was imaged twice, under low dose conditions (less than 10 electrons per Å2) at −2.5-μm defocus, with the grid, respectively, tilted at 45 and 0°. For these experiments, an acceleration voltage of 100 kV was used with Kodak SO163 electron microscope films. The exact magnification of the microscope was estimated to a value of X 42825 on a catalase crystal test grid (27Wrigley N.G. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1968; 24: 454-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Micrographs were digitized on an Optronics P1000 microdensitometer, using a 25-μm square scanning aperture corresponding to 0.584 × 0.584 nm. The windowing of the particle images was performed simultaneously on the tilted (45°) and untilted (0°) digitized micrographs, using an interactive selection program (28Radermacher M. J. Electron Microsc. Techn. 1988; 9: 359-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). At this step, the relative orientations of each pair of micrographs in terms of tilt angle, direction of the tilt axis, and translation were calculated from the coordinates of the particle images. The selected images were submitted to contrast inversion and normalization process as described earlier (8Boisset N. Penczek P. Pochon F. Frank J. Lamy J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The digitized images were processed according to the method of “random conical tilt series” (29Radermacher M. Wagenknecht T. Verschoor A. Frank J. J. Microsc. 1987; 146: 113-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), originally designed to make use of the preferred orientations of single particles on a support carbon film. The untilted-specimen images are only used at a preliminary stage, to determine the in-plane rotation angles of the particles and to select structurally homogeneous image sets by multivariate statistical analysis and automatic clustering. The corresponding tilted-specimen images are used exclusively for the three-dimensional reconstructions. For image processing, we followed the strategy proposed by Penczek et al. (30Penczek P. Radermacher M. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 40: 33-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The whole set of untilted images was subjected first to a reference-free alignment, then homogeneous image classes were determined by correspondence analysis and hierarchical ascendant classification using Ward's merging criterion. All volumes were calculated with the simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique, and the orientations between individual three-dimensional reconstructions were determined by direct search in real space (30Penczek P. Radermacher M. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 40: 33-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The merging of the individual three-dimensional reconstruction volumes, derived from the small homogeneous image classes, led to an average three-dimensional structure. Finally, the “three-dimensional projection alignment” method (31Penczek P. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1994; 53: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) was applied to the whole set of tilted images to produce a refined three-dimensional volume. A tool termed topology sphere was developed in the SIGMA software to visualize the Eulerian angles assigned to the cryo-EM images for the three-dimensional reconstruction (32Taveau J.C. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In this representation, the particle is placed at the center of a sphere and each experimental image is represented on the sphere by a triangle whose spherical coordinates correspond to Eulerian angles φ and θ. The ψ angle is reflected by a rotation of the triangle around the radial axis passing through its center. The best angular distribution is obtained when the sphere is evenly covered by small triangles, but sometimes portions of the sphere remain empty, even after collecting large sets of cryo-EM images under various tilt conditions. For the resolution limit estimation of two-dimensional averages and three-dimensional reconstruction volumes, two classes were randomly drawn from the whole image set. The corresponding two-dimensional averages and three-dimensional volumes were then compared in reciprocal space on increasing radii or spherical shells with the differential phase-residual (33Frank J. Verschoor A. Boublik M. Science. 1981; 214: 1353-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and Fourier shell correlation (34Harauz G. van Heel M. Optik. 1986; 73: 146-156Google Scholar) criteria. The interpretation of the reconstructed three-dimensional volumes was carried out with the help of solid-body surface representations and examination of selected slices. For solid-body surface representations, a threshold leaving apparent 100% of the molecular volume was computed on the basis of a partial specific volume of 0.73 ml/g and a global molecular mass of 730 kDa, corresponding to a molecular volume of 7360 voxels or 1.46 × 106Å3. However, the surface representations corresponding to 100% of the molecular volume show eroded structures. This discrepancy results from the limited resolution of the images that induces small unresolved cavities to be considered as protein and from the contrast transfer function of the electron microscope that at −2.5 μm defocus induces a contrast inversion for features below 28 Å. Another method to determine the threshold leaving apparent all the features of the reconstructed particles is to compute the histogram of densities of the reconstruction volumes (data not shown). Two peaks of densities are always observed, corresponding to vitreous ice (lower densities) and protein (higher densities). Here, for native and transformed α2M, the threshold densities located between the two peaks produce surface representations leaving apparent 180% of the expected molecular volume. In the vitreous ice layer, the native and transformed α2M complexes give characteristic EM views (Figs. 1, A and I). The native molecule produces symmetric (Fig. 1B) and asymmetric (Figs. 1, C and D) lip views, two eye views (Fig. 1, E and F), and two types of padlock views (Fig. 1, G and H). As previously observed (13Larquet E. Boisset N. Pochon F. Lamy J. J. Struct. Biol. 1994; 113: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), the four-petaled flower, and Φ views were rare and could not be taken into account for image processing. Similarly, transformed α2M produces symmetric (Fig. 1J) and asymmetric (Fig. 1K) end-on views, as well as two types of H views (Figs. 1, L and M). Here again, the orientation termed “lateral view” or “L view” was not observed in the ice layer. All the types of EM views shown in Fig. 1, B-H and J-M, are average images of homogeneous images classes, resulting from particle selection, two-dimensional alignment, and automatic clustering of untilted-specimen images. For three-dimensional reconstruction, we used the following strategy. For each homogeneous image class of untilted-specimen images, the corresponding images extracted from the tilted-specimen fields were subjected to three-dimensional reconstruction. Then, for the native and transformed α2M, seven and four primary volumes were calculated from the homogeneous classes of EM views shown in Fig. 1, B-H and J-M, respectively. At this stage, the primary three-dimensional reconstruction volumes corresponding to native and transformed α2M were independently aligned in a common orientation and two merged volumes were calculated. The merged three-dimensional reconstruction volumes were then subjected to three cycles of three-dimensional projection alignment (31Penczek P. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1994; 53: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), a procedure allowing the refinement of the three-dimensional reconstruction volumes by iterative improvements of the contration of the two-dimensional images and of their assigned Eulerian angles. The three-dimensional projection alignment method states that once a reference volume is created, one can submit to the process any additional tilted- or untilted-specimen image corresponding to a projection of this volume. Moreover, the topology spheres help to visualize the directions of projections (DOPs) assigned to these images. Relying on this type of representation, one can remove from the process redundant images (corresponding to the same DOP), or include additional images in the image set to fill the gaps in the angular coverage (DOPs devoid of a corresponding image). Thus, the purpose of the topological selection is to reduce the volume deformations occurring when some types of EM views are missing (e.g. missing cone artifact) or overabundant. Fig. 2 illustrates the refinement procedure applied to the three-dimensional reconstruction of native α2M. For this refinement, we disposed of a reference volume resulting from the merged three-dimensional reconstruction of primary volumes calculated from the tilted-specimen images corresponding to the averages of Fig. 1, B-H. Then, we subjected to a first cycle of angular and translational refinement a set of 4529 additional images (1140 untilted-specimen images and 3389 tilted-specimen images obtained at a tilt angle of 45°) (Fig. 2, A-C). The topology sphere is almost completely covered (Fig. 2, A and B), and the histogram (Fig. 2C) clearly shows that the average number of images per DOP is far above one, especially near the poles of the sphere. At this point, a topological selection reducing the image set from 4529 to 2457 images was carried out to keep a single image per DOP (Fig. 2, D-F). One observes that the topology sphere (viewed from the pole in Fig. 2D and from the equator in Fig. 2E) is almost completely covered except in the equator area corresponding to the Φ view. The histogram of Fig. 2F, giving the average number of images per DOP as a function of the second Eulerian angle (θ), shows that the topological selection has left one image per DOP everywhere except for θ angles in the range of 80° to 110°. After the selection step, the 2457 remaining images were subjected to three additional cycles of angular and translational refinement. At each cycle, a three-dimensional reconstruction volume was computed and used as the reference for the next cycle. The topology spheres and histograms corresponding to the first and third cycles of refinement are shown in Fig. 2, G-I and J-L, respectively. One observes that the Eulerian angles assigned to the images change from cycle to cycle and that a number of images migrate from the equator to the poles (Fig. 2, F, I, andL). The variation of the anglular parameters results from an improvement of the image concentration and of the Eulerian angles at each new refinement cycle. However, the particular migration toward the poles remains unexplained. In fact, most of the variations occurred between the selection (Fig. 2, D-F) and the first refinement cycle (Fig. 2, G-I), and the defect in the angular coverage remained minor. A similar strategy was used for the refinement of the transformed α2M. After topological selection, 912 images remained and were submitted to three cycles of translational and rotational refinement. Here again, we observed a displacement of the images toward the poles of the topology sphere (data not shown). The resolution limits of the refined three-dimensional reconstruction volumes were estimated by differential phase residual and Fourier Shell correlation methods and gave, respectively, 42.3 and 37.8 Å for the native, and 42.3 and 40.2 Å for the transformed α2M. Native α2M—The actual three-dimensional reconstruction volume of native human α2M shares many common features with the previously published structure (13Larquet E. Boisset N. Pochon F. Lamy J. J. Struct. Biol. 1994; 113: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). As visible in the four-petaled flower view (Fig. 3E) the overall molecule comprises two vertical “pillars” on its sides and two “oblique bodies” located at the fore and back planes. Although in a previous report we used the term “oblique arch” (13Larquet E. Boisset N. Pochon F. Lamy J. J. Struct. Biol. 1994; 113: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), we prefer to employ the term oblique body and keep the word “arches” to designate an element of the semicircular sigmoid bridges now visible between the two pillars. The surface representations of Fig. 3 also shows that a single structure explains all the EM views observed in vitreous ice. For example, the molecule oriented in its lip view (Fig. 3A) gives the padlock view when rotated by 45° around an horizontal axis (Fig. 3C) and the four-petaled flower view upon a further 45° rotation (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, from this four-petaled flower view, a 90° rotation around a vertical axis yields the Φ view (Fig. 3G). Three main differences are observed between this three-dimensional reconstruction volume and the volume previously obtained (13Larquet E. Boisset N. Pochon F. Lamy J. J. Struct. Biol. 1994; 113: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). First, two arches that were not resolved at the lower resolution limit of the previous three-dimensional reconstruction are now clearly visible at the front and the back of the lip view (Fig. 3A). Second, the dimensions of the particle that were 18 × 18 × 15 nm in the previous volume are now 21 × 21 × 14 nm, so that the Φ view looks narrower. Third, the oblique bodies that appeared as compact structures with uniform diameter are now composed of two main masses (asterisks in Fig. 3E) separated by a central constriction. Since similar masses, termed “basal bodies,” occurred in the transformed molecule, we keep the same name to designated these substructures. A good agreement exists between the current volume (Fig. 3, B, D, F, andH) and the one previously obtained (8Boisset N. Penczek P. Pochon F. Frank J. Lamy J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The only noticeable difference concerns the dimensions of the particle in its H view (Fig. 3H) that are 15.2 × 23.3 × 13.4 nm, while the previous estimation was 14.4 × 19.3 × 13.0 nm. Due to the new features observed in the three-dimensional reconstruction volume of the native α2M, we aligned the native and transformed structures in common orientations and found that the lip view of the native α2M (Fig. 3A) corresponds to the symmetric end-on view of the transformed molecule (Fig. 3B). In this disposition, the arches locking the front and the back of the native molecule in the lip view (curved arrow in Fig. 3A) are homologous in the transformed molecule to the interwall structures (12Boisset N. Penczek P. Pochon F. Frank J. Lamy J.N. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) (curved arrow in Fig. 3B). Moreover, the small arms bridging the interwall structures to the apex of the transformed molecule, that we termed “apical connections” (arrowheads in Fig. 3B), also have their counterpart in the native form (arrowheads in Fig. 3A). A 45° rotation of the three-dimensional reconstruction volumes around a horizontal axis produces a padlock view in native α2M (Fig. 3C) and an asymmetric end-on view in the transformed molecule (Fig. 3D). In these orientations, two types of apertures are observed in the same locations at the fore and back planes of both structures. We designate the larger channel (native, 78 × 39 Å; transformed, 48 × 29 Å) as “c1” and the smaller (native, 12 × 10 Å; transformed, 27 × 16 Å) as “c2” (arrows in Fig. 3, C and D). A further 45° rotation around an horizontal axis produces the four-petaled flower view in native α2M (Fig. 3E) and the H view in transformed α2M (Fig. 3F). At the front of the particles one observes that two basal bodies are present in both structures (asterisks in Fig. 3, E and F). Although the two particles share common features in this orientation, as a result of the structural transformation, the H view is taller and narrower (23 × 15 nm) than the four-petaled flower view (21 × 21 nm). This lateral squeezing of the transformed molecule, also visible when the particles are subjected to a 90° rotation around a vertical axis (Fig. 3, G and H), is the keystone of the proposed mechanism of the transformation described below. This rotation places native α2M in its Φ view (Fig. 3G), and the transformed molecule in its L view (Fig. 3H). Here again, there is a good agreement between the two structures. Actually, the rhomboid lateral wall of the transformed α2M is equivalent to the vertical pillar of the native structure (Fig. 3G, arrow) plus the upper-left and lower-right basal bodies of the two opposite oblique bodies (Fig. 3G, asterisks). Despite these minor differences, the three 2-fold axes of the two forms are perfectly aligned, as visible in Fig. 3, A and B, E and F, and G and H. The structural relatedness of native and transformed α2M can also be recognized in the inner features of the three-dimensional reconstruction volumes. For this purpose, Fig. 4, Fig. 5 show a series of slices and truncated volumes of the transformed and native molecules cut perpendicularly to their three 2-fold axes with front, central, and back slices in rows 1-3, 4, and 5-7, respectively. A one-voxel thick slice corresponding to the cutting plane is displayed on the right side of each truncated volume. For example, Fig. 4, panel B, 4, contains two images describing the transformed α2M oriented in its H view. The left image contains a surface representation of the volume with the front half removed, while the right image corresponding to the cutting plane is the middle slice of the volume.Fig. 5Internal features of the three-dimensional reconstruction volume of native α2M. The volume is placed in its three orthogonal orientations termed lip view (A), four-petaled flower view (B), and Φ view (C). The volume is seen from above and is gradually truncated from front (row No. 1) to back (row No. 7). For each truncated particle, the cutting plane corresponds to the white zone at the front of the surface representation, and the corresponding slice is shown on its right side. Asterisks represent basal bodies in B, 1 and 7, and white arrowheads signal apical connections in B, 3 and 4. Pairs of high density masses are numbered 1, 3, and 4 in the lateral walls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These are described above in transformed α2M as two semicircular sigmoid bridges. In the end-on view, they form two S-shaped bridges at the front (Fig. 4, panel A, 2) and the back (Fig. 4, panel A, 6) of the molecule. In the H view (Fig. 4B), each interwall structure comprises five building blocks corresponding to an “arch,” two basal bodies, and two apical connections. Considering only the upper half-molecule, we find at the H view fore plane, that the interwall structure starts from the middle of the right lateral wall by a large mass termed “right basal body” (asterisk in Fig. 4, panel B, 1). Then, the arch starting from the basal body ascends toward the apex of the molecule between the two lateral walls (Fig. 4, panel B, 2). The arch, clearly appearing in the central slices as a high-density zone equidistant from the lateral walls (Figs. 4, panel B, 3-5), is linked to the right lateral wall apex by a thin apical connection (white arrowhead in Fig. 4, panel B, 3), then to the left lateral wall apex by a second thin apical connection (white arrowhead in Fig. 4, panel B, 4). Finally, the arch goes downward and reaches the left lateral wall (Fig. 4, panel B, 6) at the level of the left basal body (asterisk in Fig. 4, panel B, 7). These slices (Fig. 4, panel B, 2-6) help to understand why the interwall structures appear as two white dots between the lateral walls in the two-dimensional images of negatively stained transformed α2M. The semicircular shape of the upper arch is clearly visible in the central slice extracted from the molecule"
https://openalex.org/W2047469258,"The interactions of reductants with dopamine β-monooxygenase (DβM) were examined using two novel classes of reductants. The steady-state kinetics of the previously characterized DβM reductant, N,N-dimethyl-1,4-p-phenylenediamine (DMPD), were parallel to the ascorbic acid-supported reaction with respect to pH dependence and fumarate activation. DMPD also displayed pH and fumarate-dependent apparent negative cooperativity demonstrating that the previously reported cooperative behavior of DβM toward the reductant is not unique to ascorbic acid. The 6-OH phenyl and alkylphenyl-substituted ascorbic acid derivatives were more efficient reductants for the enzyme than ascorbic acid. Kinetic studies suggested that these derivatives behave as pseudo bisubstrates with respect to ascorbic acid and the amine substrate. The lack of apparent cooperative behavior with these derivatives suggests that this behavior of DβM is not common for all the reductants. Based on these findings and additional kinetic evidence, the proposal that the apparent negative cooperativity in the interaction of ascorbic acid with DβM was due to the presence of a distinct allosteric regulatory site has been ruled out. In contrast to previous models, where fumarate was proposed to interact with a distinct anion binding site, the effect of fumarate on the steady-state kinetics of these novel reductants suggests that fumarate and the reductant may interact with the same site of the enzyme. In accordance with these observations and mathematical analysis of the experimental data, a unified model for the apparent negative cooperativity and fumarate activation of DβM in which both fumarate and the reductant interact with the same site of all forms of the enzyme with varying affinities under steady-state turnover conditions has been proposed.

The observations that ascorbic acid (AscH2) is an efficient in vitro reductant of DβM and that high levels of AscH2 are present in DβM containing neurosecretory vesicles (4Ingebretsen O.C. Terland O. Flatmark T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 628: 182-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 5Phillips J.H. Neuroscience. 1982; 7: 1595-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) appear to indicate that intragranular AscH2 may provide the necessary reducing equivalents for the DβM reaction in vivo. However, recent studies with chromaffin granule ghosts suggest that extragranular (cytosolic) AscH2 may be involved in the reduction of membrane-bound DβM directly (6Huyghe B.G. Klinman J.P. J. Biol.

Although the hydroxylation site of DβM has been studied in great detail (8Ljones T. Skotland T. Lontie R. Copper Proteins and Copper Enzymes. Vol 2.

Med. 1979; 2: 151-180Google Scholar), the specificity and chemistry of the reduction site of the enzyme is poorly understood. For example, AscH2 has been considered to be the most efficient, structurally optimal reductant for the enzyme, but recent findings from our laboratory (11Wimalasena K. Dharmasena S. Wimalasena D.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that 6-O-phenyl and 6-S-phenyl-L-ascorbic acid derivatives are much more efficient reductants for the enzyme compared with AscH2. In addition, the facile single electron donors such as N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-1,4-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) and N,N-dimethyl-1,4-p-phenylenediamine (DMPD), which have no structural resemblance to AscH2 (Scheme I), are also well behaved efficient reductants for the enzyme (12Wimalasena K. Wimalasena D.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 920-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 13Wimalasena K. Wimalasena D.S. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These findings appear to indicate that either the reduction site of the enzyme is not specific or the enzyme may possess multiple reduction sites with different specificity. The physiological significance of this highly nonspecific nature of the reductant site of the enzyme is not clearly understood at present. Although the precise geometry of the DβM active site is not known, the first evidence for the existence of distinct non-overlapping binding sites for the amine substrate and the reductant has come from the observation that the reduced enzyme-product complex (Erd-P) is the predominant form under steady-state turnover conditions in the presence of excess AscH2 (14Brenner M.C. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4664-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These results were used to propose that under steady-state conditions the Eox-P complex is preferentially reduced prior to the release of the product requiring a distinct reductant binding site that is non-overlapping with the amine binding site (14Brenner M.C. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4664-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This information was incorporated into a working model suggesting that one of the two copper sites in the DβM active site functions strictly as the reduction site, whereas the other copper site is responsible for molecular oxygen activation and insertion into the organic substrate. In addition, the apparent negative cooperativity observed in the interaction of AscH2 with DβM under a variety of experimental conditions was proposed to be due either to the interaction of AscH2 with a specific allosteric regulatory site or due to the existence of multiple reducible forms of the enzyme in the catalytic cycle (15Stewart L.C. Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11537-11543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Halides and organic anions have long been known to activate DβM under steady-state conditions (16Goldstein M. Joh H.T. Garvey III, T.Q. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 2724-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 17Levin E.Y. Lovenberg B. Kaufman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2080-2086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Craine J.E. Daniels G.H. Kaufman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7838-7844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The most efficient activator of the enzyme, the dicarboxylic acid, fumarate, was shown to exert its effect on the steady-state kinetics of the enzyme by (a) increasing the pKa of catalytically important active site residues leading to the optimal activity of the enzyme over a wide pH range and (b) pH-dependent decrease of the rate of dissociation of the amine substrate from the enzyme ternary complex (19Ahn N. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3096-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition to these effects, recent studies have shown that at low AscH2 concentrations fumarate behaves as a reversible inhibitor for the enzyme which is believed to be due to the competitive binding of fumarate to the reduction site of the enzyme. The observation that fumarate is capable of activating DβM even in the presence of saturating levels of AscH2 has been accepted as evidence for the existence of a distinct anion activation site in the enzyme. However, the molecular mechanism of fumarate activation of the enzyme is not clearly understood. In the present study we have examined the interaction of the reductant with DβM using two novel classes of reductants. The steady-state kinetic behavior of the DMPD-mediated DβM reaction was found to parallel the AscH2-supported reaction, especially with respect to pH dependence and fumarate activation. In addition, steady-state kinetics of the reaction with respect to DMPD displayed pH and fumarate-dependent apparent negative cooperative behavior that was parallel to the kinetics of AscH2 demonstrating that the cooperative behavior of DβM is not unique to AscH2. The 6-OH modified AscH2 derivatives (Scheme I), 6-O-phenyl (6OPAscH2), 6-S-phenyl (6SPAscH2), 6-S-benzyl (6SBAscH2), and 6-S-phenylethyl (6SPEAscH2) were found to be much more efficient reductants for the enzyme than AscH2. Detailed kinetic studies have revealed that these derivatives may behave as pseudo bisubstrates for the enzyme with respect to AscH2 and the amine substrate. However, the initial rate kinetics of these AscH2 derivatives (except 6OPAscH2) did not display any significant cooperativity, suggesting that the cooperative behavior of DβM is not common for all of the reductants. Based on these findings the proposal that the observed apparent negative cooperativity with respect to the reductant was due to the presence of a distinct allosteric regulatory site in DβM has been ruled out in favor of the possibility that the observed cooperativity is due to the existence of two reducible steady-state forms of the enzyme with different affinities for the reductants. 4The high degree of negative cooperativity and smaller high Km observed for 6OPAscH2 in comparison to AscH2 (Table I) suggest that 6OPAscH2 possesses an unexpected affinity to the Eox-P form of the enzyme that appears to be inconsistent with the proposed model. These observations are also clearly inconsistent with the existence of a specific regulatory AscH2 site, since AscH2 is expected to interact stronger with such a site than the structurally altered 6OPAscH2. Therefore, a possible explanation for this observation is that the phenyl binding region of the Eox-P form of the enzyme is somewhat loose and allows slight interaction of the phenyl group of the structurally compact 6OPAscH2, in contrast to the other 6-OH derivatives of AscH2 that are structurally extended. In contrast to previous models, where fumarate was proposed to interact with a distinct anion binding site in the enzyme, based on the above findings and the results of the mathematical analysis of the experimental data, we propose that fumarate exerts its effects by interacting with the same reduction site of various steady-state forms of the enzyme with varying affinities. The significance of these findings in relation to the in vivo reduction of DβM and modulation of norepinephrine biosynthesis is discussed. Tyramine hydrochloride, disodium fumarate, and MES were from Sigma. N,N-Dimethyl-1,4-p-phenylenediamine hydrochloride salt and AscH2 were from Aldrich. Beef liver catalase (65,000 units/mg of protein) was from Boehringer Mannheim. The AscH2 derivatives, 6OPAscH2 and 6SPAscH2, were synthesized as previously reported (8Ljones T. Skotland T. Lontie R. Copper Proteins and Copper Enzymes. Vol 2. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1984: 131Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of the highest purity available and were purchased from various sources. Bovine adrenal soluble DβM was isolated and purified (specific activity, 13-30 units/mg) according to the procedures previously described (20Ljones T. Skotland T. Flatmark T. Eur. J.

The concentration of purified enzyme was estimated spectrophotometrically using E280 = 1.24 ml mg−1 cm−1. UV-visible spectroscopic measurements were carried out using an HP-8452A diode array spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature-controlled cell compartment. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian XL-300 (300 MHz) NMR spectrometer using tetramethylsilane or 3-(trimethylsilyl)-1-propanesulfonic acid sodium salt (when D2O was the NMR solvent) as internal standards. Initial rates of steady-state oxygen consumption were measured using a Yellow Springs Model YSI 5300 polarographic oxygen monitor. All the kinetic parameters were apparent and were determined by computer fit of the initial rate data to the hyperbolic form of the Michaelis-Menten equation using the “Enzfit” program. The inhibition constants were determined by direct fit of the data to the Cleland programs (23Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). The pH dependence of the initial rates were analyzed by computer fitting the data to Equation 1.ν=c1+H+/Ka+Kb/H+(Eq. 1) In cases where a significant deviation from the expected kinetic behavior (apparent cooperativity) was observed, the data were analyzed by the general model of Alberty (15Stewart L.C.

The corresponding four Michaelis constants V1 and K1 (at low substrate concentrations) and V2 and K2 (at high substrate concentrations) were estimated by computer fitting of the data to the general kinetic Equation 2.ν=V2+V1K2/1−V1/V2[S]1+K2/1−V1/V2[S]+K1K2/1−V1/V2[S]2(Eq. 2) The initial rates of the DβM reaction under various experimental conditions were determined by the initial rate of oxygen consumption using a polarographic oxygen electrode at 37°C as described previously (13Wimalasena K. Wimalasena D.S. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In these assays, 2-200 mM stock solutions of 6OPAscH2, 6SPAscH2, 6SBAscH2, and 6SPEAscH2 were prepared, and the pH values of 50-200 mM stocks were adjusted to 5.2 or 6.7 with NaOH. All enzymatic reactions were carried out in 50 mM MES buffer adjusted to either pH 5.2 or 6.7 depending on the experiment. The standard reaction mixtures contained 100 μg/ml catalase, 2 μM CuSO4, and 50 mM MES buffer. All the enzymatic reactions were initiated by the addition of tyramine to a final concentration of 10 mM, and the initial turnover rates were measured as the rate of oxygen consumption minus the small background rates due to autooxidation of ascorbic acid (or AscH2 derivative). All kinetic parameters, Vmax, Km, etc. were apparent and were determined at atmospheric oxygen saturation conditions (256 μM). The Vmax values were calculated based on the monomer molecular mass of 70,000 Da for DβM and normalized to a constant maximum specific activity of 30 μmol/min·mg for the purpose of internal comparison (see Table I). Stock solutions of sparingly water-soluble ascorbate derivatives were made in ethanol, and thus the equivalent amounts of ethanol were added to all the assay mixtures to maintain a constant ethanol concentration (maximum 7.5% v/v) throughout the experiment (control experiments indicated that the kinetic parameters or the apparent negative cooperative behavior of AscH2 are not significantly altered by the presence of 7.5% of ethanol in the assay mixture).

Open table in a new tab All enzymatic reactions (except pH dependence experiments) were carried out in 50 mM MES buffer adjusted to either pH 5.2 or 6.7 depending on the experiment. The pH dependence experiments were carried out in either 125 mM sodium acetate buffer or 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer depending on the pH. The standard reaction mixtures contained 100 μg/ml catalase and 0.5-2.0 μM CuSO4 in a total volume of 1.0 ml. DβM concentrations were kept constant for each experiment but varied between 1.2 and 3.2 μg of protein per assay depending on the experiment. The enzymatic reactions were usually initiated with the reductant unless otherwise stated. The rate of increase in absorbance at 515 nm due to the enzyme-mediated formation of the DMPD cation radical at 37°C was measured against a reference identical to the enzymatic reaction mixture but without the enzyme as described previously (13Wimalasena K.

A solution of benzyl mercaptan (1.04 g, 8.4 mmol) in 0.5 M NaOH (16.8 ml) was added slowly to the reaction mixture and stirred at room temperature for 24 h under N2. The reaction mixture was acidified with 1 M HCl to pH 1 and extracted with hexane (2 × 100 ml), and the hexane layer was discarded. The aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 100 ml), and the ethyl acetate layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Evaporation of the ethyl acetate layer under reduced pressure gave a yellow oily compound that was later crystallized from ethyl acetate and hexane. The resultant colorless crystals were dried in a vacuum desiccator. Second recrystallization of this material from ethyl acetate and hexane gave a colorless crystalline product.

The pH dependence of the apparent Vmax/Km ratios for the DMPD-supported DβM hydroxylation of tyramine at a fixed 12.5 mM DMPD concentration in the presence and absence of fumarate is shown in Fig. 1. The analyses of these data by computer fitting to Equation 1 using the Bell program yielded apparent limiting values of 4.9 × 104M−1 s−1 in the presence and 2.5 × 104M−1 s−1 in the absence of fumarate for Vmax/Km, demonstrating that 10 mM fumarate increases the apparent limiting Vmax/Km for tyramine by about a factor of 2 similar to that observed for the AscH2-mediated reaction (19Ahn N. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3096-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These analyses also revealed that at least two ionizable groups with apparent pKa values of 5.3 and 5.9 in the presence and 4.8 and 5.4 in the absence of fumarate are involved in the catalytic cycle of the DMPD-mediated DβM reaction, again very similar to the AscH2-supported reaction (19Ahn N. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3096-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The data presented in Fig. 2, A and B, demonstrate that the initial velocities of the DMPD-mediated DβM hydroxylation of tyramine as a function of DMPD, at a 0.1 to 50 mM concentration range, at pH 5.2, both in the presence and absence of 10 mM fumarate, display a significant deviation from the expected linearity in Eadie-Hofstee plots. At pH 6.7, this deviation was significantly pronounced both in the presence and absence of fumarate (Fig. 2, C and D) similar to the observed behavior for the AscH2-supported DβM reaction. The analysis of the data by fitting to Equation 2 as described under “Materials and Methods” yielded low apparent Km values of 0.70 mM in the absence and 1.56 mM in the presence of fumarate at pH 5.2 (Table I; at pH 6.7 accurate low Km values could not be obtained due to very low turnover rates of the DMPD-mediated DβM reaction). The apparent Km values at high DMPD concentrations were 5.95 mM at pH 5.2 and 47.1 mM at pH 6.7 in the absence of fumarate (Table I). In addition, the corresponding increase in Vmax values were in the 2-3-fold range depending on the experimental conditions (Table I).Fig. 2The steady-state kinetic behavior of the DMPD-mediated DβM reaction as a function of DMPD.
