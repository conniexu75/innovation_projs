https://openalex.org/W2161399617,"A novel human zinc metalloprotease that has considerable homology to human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (40% identity and 61% similarity) has been identified. This metalloprotease (angiotensin-converting enzyme homolog (ACEH)) contains a single HEXXH zinc-binding domain and conserves other critical residues typical of the ACE family. The predicted protein sequence consists of 805 amino acids, including a potential 17-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide sequence and a putative C-terminal membrane anchor. Expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells of a soluble, truncated form of ACEH, lacking the transmembrane and cytosolic domains, produces a glycoprotein of 120 kDa, which is able to cleave angiotensin I and angiotensin II but not bradykinin or Hip-His-Leu. In the hydrolysis of the angiotensins, ACEH functions exclusively as a carboxypeptidase. ACEH activity is inhibited by EDTA but not by classical ACE inhibitors such as captopril, lisinopril, or enalaprilat. Identification of the genomic sequence of ACEH has shown that the ACEH gene contains 18 exons, of which several have considerable size similarity with the first 17 exons of human ACE. The gene maps to chromosomal location Xp22. Northern blotting analysis has shown that the ACEH mRNA transcript is ∼3.4 kilobase pairs and is most highly expressed in testis, kidney, and heart. This is the first report of a mammalian homolog of ACE and has implications for our understanding of cardiovascular and renal function.

Williams T.A. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, London1998: 1066-1076Google Scholar). The predominant physiological function of ACE is in cardiovascular homeostasis through cleavage of the C-terminal dipeptide from angiotensin I to produce the potent vasoconstrictor, angiotensin II (2Skeggs L.T. Kahn J.R. Shumway N.P. J. Exp. Med. 1955; 103: 295-299Crossref Scopus (720) Google Scholar). ACE also inactivates the vasodilator, bradykinin, by the sequential cleavage of two C-terminal dipeptides (3Yang H.Y.T. Erdös E.G. Levine Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 214: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). ACE can also hydrolyze a wide range of other endogenous bioactive peptides (4Rieger K.-J. Saez-Servent N. Papet M.-P. Wdzieczak-Bakala J. Morgat J.-L. Thierry J. Voelter W. Lenfant M. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Two forms of mammalian ACE have been identified to date: the two-domain somatic ACE, containing two catalytic sites and a single domain germinal ACE (5Soubrier F. Alhenc-Gelas F. Hubert C.

A. 1989; 86: 7741-7745Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Both enzymes are derived from the same gene through the use of alternative promoters, and it has been suggested that the ACE gene arose from the duplication of an ancestral gene coding for a single domain enzyme (8Hubert C. Houot A.-M. Corvol P. Soubrier F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15377-15383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Somatic ACE exists as a type I integral membrane protein anchored to the plasma membrane through a transmembrane domain near the C terminus (9Hooper N.M. Keen J. Pappin D.J.C. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, it can also be found in plasma and other body fluids as a soluble enzyme lacking the transmembrane and cytosolic domains (10Das M. Hartley J.L. Soffers R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1316-1319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11El-Dorry H.A. MacGregor J.S. Soffer R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

This form is thought to arise predominantly by post-translational proteolytic cleavage at the cell surface through the action of ACE secretase (9Hooper N.M. Keen J. Pappin D.J.C. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 13Oppong S.Y. Hooper N.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 14Woodman Z.L. Oppong S.Y. Cook S.

ACE-like enzymes have also been found in other non-mammalian species. In particular Musca domestica and Drosophila melanogaster have both been shown to contain single domain, ACE-like proteins (AnCE) (15Lamango N. Isaac R.E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 245Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 16Cornell M.J. Williams T.A. Lamango N.S. Coates D. Corvol P. Soubrier F. Hoheisel J. Lehrach H. Isaac R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13613-13619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and more recently, a second ACE-like protein, termed ACEr, has been identified in D. melanogaster(17Taylor C.A.M. Coates D. Shirras A.D. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 181: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). ACEr and AnCE appear to be alternatively expressed duringD. melanogaster pupal development (18Houard X. Williams T.A. Michaud A. Dani P. Isaac R.E. Shirras A.D. Coates D. Corvol P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), suggesting different roles for the two enzymes. In this study we have identified a novel, single domain, human zinc metalloprotease cDNA (ACEH) whose predicted amino acid sequence has significant similarity with mammalian ACE. Furthermore, the genomic structure of ACEH indicates a remarkable exon size similarity with the first 17 exons of ACE. Expression of a soluble, truncated form of ACEH, lacking the transmembrane and cytosolic domains, produced a 120-kDa glycosylated protein that hydrolyzed the C-terminal residue from angiotensins I and II. The transcript for this cDNA is highly expressed in heart, kidney, and testis, implying that the translated protein may play a role in the regulation of cardiovascular and renal function, as well as fertility. Captopril was a gift from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Enalaprilat (MK422) and lisinopril were gifts from Merck. Other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. A partial cDNA of 2885 nucleotides encoding ACEH was obtained following identification of a zinc metalloprotease with homology to ACE from a proprietary EST data base and subsequent screening of a human lymphoma cDNA library. To establish whether the clone was a full-length cDNA, 5′- and 3′-RACE were carried out on a SUPERSCRIPTTM human kidney cDNA library (Life Technologies, Inc.). Gene-specific primers deduced from the partial cDNA library clone GSP1 (5′CCCCATAGTCCTCATAATGATTTGC3′), GSPr2 (5′CCAGTACTGTAGATGGTGCTC3′), S3RACE1 (5′GGACCTCCTAACCAGCCCCCTGTTTCC3′), S3RACE2 (5′GGATGTCCCGGAGCCGTATCAATGATGC3′), and primers to the pCMVSport Library vector, Csport1 (5′GCTTATAATACGACTCACTATAGGG3′), Csport2 (5′GGGAGAGAGCTATGACGTCGCATGC3′), Csport3 (5′GCTATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAAGG3′), and Csport4 (5′CTATAGAAGGTACGCCTGCAGGTAC3′) were designed. 5′-RACE was carried out with an initial combination of primers Csport3 and GSP1, followed by a nested PCR using primers Csport4 and GSPr2. 3′-RACE was carried out with an initial combination of primer pairs Csport1 and S3RACE2, followed by nested PCR using primers Csport2 and S3RACE1. The DNA products from these RACE reactions were cloned into the PCR-Script™ Amp SK(+) plasmid (Stratagene, Amsterdam Zwidoost, The Netherlands) for sequence analysis. This was carried out by the dideoxy chain termination method using an automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems PRISM 377). The full cDNA sequence of ACEH has been deposited in the GenBankTM data base with accession numberAF241254. The genomic sequence of ACEH was identified by searching the GenBankTM data base with the cDNA sequence encoding ACEH using a FASTA program on the GCG suite. The GCG suite was also used to determine the percentage identities and similarities between the predicted ACEH protein and existing members of the ACE family using the Bestfit program. Hydropathy plots, obtained using the algorithms of Kyte and Doolittle (19Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) and Engelman et al. (20Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Goldman A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar), were also performed using the GCG suite. Multiple tissue mRNA blots were obtained from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). These blots were probed according to the manufacturer's protocol with cDNA fragments encoding ACEH or endothelial ACE (provided by P. Corvol, Paris, France). A 943-nucleotide cDNA fragment of ACEH was obtained by XmnI restriction endonuclease digestion. A 614-nucleotide cDNA fragment of ACE was obtained using aScaI digest. The cDNA fragments were labeled with32P using a random primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The truncated cDNA encoding ACEH was isolated from the human lymphoma cDNA library in plasmid pCMVSport2 which contains cDNA inserts betweenNotI and SalI restriction sites. By using these sites the partial ACEH cDNA was excised from pCMVSport2 and cloned into pBluescript SK(+). This plasmid was designated pBSKACE10. Additional 5′ sequence obtained from 5′-RACE was added to pBSKACE10, using SalI and HindIII to remove the extra sequence from the RACE product in PCRScript and cloning it into the pBSKACE10 construct using the same sites, generating the plasmid pBSKACE10+5′. The cDNA with the additional 5′ sequence was then excised from pBSKACE10+5′ using NotI and SalI restriction sites and cloned into vector pC1-neo (Promega, Southampton, UK) using the same sites. PCR was then carried out using antisense primer SMYCPR (5′CGAGGGCCCGGAAACAGGGGGCTGGTTAGGAGG3′) (nucleotides 2300–2323 which also incorporated an ApaI site) and sense primer NeoT7 (5′GGCTAGAGTACTTAATACGACTCACTATAGG-3′) (nucleotides 1055–1085 of pC1-neo). This gave a truncated cDNA encoding ACEH, which lacks the transmembrane and cytosolic domains. The PCR product was digested with ApaI and XhoI and ligated, in frame, into expression vector pcDNA3.1Myc-His A which was also digested with XhoI and ApaI. This construct, designated pSTMyc-TM7, gave a truncated ACEH cDNA together with an in frame fusion tag encoding the c-Myc epitope and a hexahistidine tag. CHO cells were obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK) and were cultured in Ham's F-12 nutrient mix (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, at 37 °C, with 5% CO2. 24 h prior to transfection cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells per 75-cm2 flask. For transient transfection, the monolayer was washed twice with OPTI-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) before transfection with 3 μg of pSTMyc-TM7 plasmid DNA per flask. LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used as cationic lipid at a ratio of DNA/lipid, 1:10 (w/w). This was added to the flasks in 2.5 ml of Opti-MEM and incubated for 16 h before the addition of Ham's F-12 nutrient mix containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. The medium was removed 24 h after the start of transfection; the monolayer rinsed twice with Opti-MEM, and then 5 ml of Opti-MEM was added to each flask. This was incubated for a further 16 h before harvesting of the medium, containing soluble secreted ACEH protein. The media samples containing protein were concentrated using 4-ml Vivaspin columns (Vivascience, Binbrook, Lincoln, UK). 30 μg of total protein containing soluble secreted ACEH from CHO cell media was incubated overnight at 37 °C with 1 μl of PNGase F (Oxford Glycosystems, Abingdon, Oxford, UK). Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (21Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Assays for ACEH activity were carried out in a total volume of 100 μl, containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 μg of protein and either 100 μm angiotensin I or II or 500 μm bradykinin, Hip-Phe, or Hip-His-Leu as substrates. Where appropriate, inhibitors were added to give final concentrations of 10 μm lisinopril, 10 μmcaptopril, 10 μm enalaprilat, 100 μm benzyl succinate, or 10 mm EDTA. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C, for 2 h and stopped by heating to 100 °C for 5 min followed by centrifugation at 11,600 × g for 10 min. Carboxypeptidase A assays were carried out at room temperature for 30 min, using 0.1 units of enzyme per assay. Peptide hydrolysis products were separated using reverse-phase HPLC (μBondapak C-18 reverse phase column, Waters) with an UV detector set at 214 nm. All separations were carried out at room temperature, with a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Mobile phase A consisted of 0.08% (v/v) phosphoric acid and mobile phase B consisted of 40% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.08% (v/v) phosphoric acid. A linear solvent gradient of 11% B to 100% B over 15 min with 5 min at final conditions, and 8 min re-equilibration was used. The product from angiotensin I cleavage was collected and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, using a 10% resolving gel and a 5% stacking gel according to the method of Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Blotting was carried out as described (23Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) using an anti-Myc-horseradish peroxidase antibody (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands). Bound antibody was detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A partial cDNA encoding ACEH was originally identified as a zinc metalloprotease with homology to ACE, in an EST data base. Following isolation of this partial clone from a human lymphoma cDNA library, the full cDNA encoding ACEH (Fig. 1) was deduced in combination with 3′- and 5′-RACE. Sequence analysis of 5′-RACE DNA products revealed an appropriate product that consisted of 100 nucleotides of extra 5′ sequence. This gave rise to a possible new initiating methionine codon 61 amino acids upstream of the original putative ATG. Two products containing extra 3′ sequence were identified from sequence analysis of 3′-RACE DNA products. The sequence differed at the termination codon of the original clone and downstream from there on. Product 132 contained an extra 207 nucleotides of sequence, including 36 extra codons. Product UB4 contained this sequence plus an additional 774 nucleotides of downstream 3′ sequence, a total of 981 nucleotides of additional sequence. Hence, the cDNA encoding ACEH consists of 3405 nucleotides with 103 nucleotides of 5′-untranslated sequence, 2418 nucleotides of open reading frame, and 884 nucleotides of 3′-untranslated region (Fig. 1). The ATG codon at nucleotide position 104 has been assigned as the initiating methionine as it is preceded by two in-frame termination codons, TAA at nucleotide 26 and TAG at nucleotide 59. A polyadenylation signal is located 24 nucleotides upstream of the poly(A) tract. The open reading frame encodes 805 amino acids, including a potential 17-amino acid N-terminal signal sequence, and has a predicted size of 92.4 kDa. There are 7 potential N-glycosylation sites within the protein sequence. Hydropathy analysis has also revealed a hydrophobic region toward the C terminus of ACEH, indicating that the protein is likely to be membrane-bound. The predicted amino acid sequence exhibits significant homology to existing members of the ACE family with ∼60% similarity and 40% identity to the N- and C-terminal domains of human ACE and ∼56% similarity and 36% identity to AnCE and ACEr. In addition to the conserved zinc metalloprotease consensus sequence, HEXXH, at amino acid positions 374–378, there is also a conserved glutamate residue (Glu-402) predicted to serve as the third zinc ligand (corresponding to Glu-389 and Glu-987 of the N and C domains of ACE, respectively) 24 amino acids downstream from histidine residue 378. Asp-393 and Asp-991 of the N and C domains of ACE, respectively, which have been proposed to function in the positioning of the first histidine ligand (24Williams T.A. Corvol P. Soubrier F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29430-29434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are replaced by a glutamate in ACEH, which may fulfill a similar role. Mutagenesis of the Asp-991 to glutamate in ACE reduces, but does not eliminate, activity (24Williams T.A. Corvol P. Soubrier F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29430-29434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are potential casein kinase II and tyrosine kinase phosphorylation sites in residues 787–790 and 775–781, respectively. The expression of mRNA encoding ACEH and ACE was examined in human tissues. Multiple tissue Northern blots were probed with a 32P-labeled fragment of the cDNA encoding either ACEH or ACE. Autoradiography revealed that expression of ACEH was greatest in kidney, testis, and heart, and moderate levels were also detected in colon, small intestine, and ovary (Fig.2 A). A single mRNA species of ∼3.4 kb was detected in these tissues, and an additional, less abundant, 5.9-kb species was also detected in kidney and testis. Two mRNA species were detected in tissues probed with endothelial ACE, of ∼4.3 and 3.5 kb, corresponding to the previously described alternatively spliced variants of endothelial ACE (25Sugimura K. Tian X.-L. Hoffmann S. Ganten D. Bader M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Expression of ACE mRNA appeared to be more widespread than ACEH, being found in colon, small intestine, ovary, testis, prostate, heart, placenta, liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas, with the highest levels of expression in lung and kidney (Fig. 2 B). The Northern blots were also probed with β-actin as a control (Fig. 2 C). To examine the function of ACEH, we expressed a truncated, secreted form of the enzyme in CHO cells. Expression of the protein without its putative C-terminal membrane binding domain and in conjunction with a C-terminal Myc-His fusion protein allowed detection of the protein by Western blotting (Fig. 3). When subjected to SDS-PAGE, the expressed secreted Myc-His tagged enzyme migrated with a molecular mass of ∼120 kDa (Fig. 3, lane 2), indicating that the protein was glycosylated. Deglycosylation of ACEH with PNGase F resulted in the migration of the protein at the predicted molecular mass of ∼85 kDa (Fig. 3, lane 1). No protein expression was detected in media taken from untransfected CHO cells. Secreted ACEH protein obtained from the medium was also used to identify potential substrates for the enzyme. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to analyze the cleavage products. A parallel preparation taken from the medium of untransfected CHO cells was unable to hydrolyze angiotensin I (Fig. 4 A). However, in the presence of ACEH, angiotensin I (retention time 9.4 min) was hydrolyzed to give a single product with a retention time of 6.7 min (Fig.4 B). Mass spectrometric analysis of the peptide recovered from the product peak gave an observed M r of 1183.9 which indicated that ACEH was acting as a carboxypeptidase to cleave the C-terminal leucyl residue from angiotensin I, producing angiotensin-(1–9). This activity was completely inhibited by 10 mm EDTA (Fig. 4 C), but activity was unaffected by 10 μm lisinopril (Fig. 4 D), enalaprilat, or captopril (data not shown). In addition to angiotensin I, ACEH was also able to hydrolyze angiotensin II (Fig. 4 E) to give products that co-migrated with angiotensin-(1–7) and phenylalanine but was unable to cleave bradykinin (Fig. 4 F) or Hip-His-Leu (data not shown). Identical products were obtained by incubation of angiotensins I or II with carboxypeptidase A. The carboxypeptidase A inhibitor, benzylsuccinate, did not inhibit the hydrolysis of angiotensin I by ACEH under conditions that abolished the hydrolysis by carboxypeptidase A. Hydrolysis of bradykinin or Hip-His-Leu, by ACEH, did not occur even following overnight incubation (data not shown). Overnight incubation of ACEH with the typical carboxypeptidase A substrate, Hip-Phe, resulted in approximately 20% hydrolysis.Figure 4HPLC analysis of the hydrolysis of peptide substrates by ACEH. Potential substrates were incubated with 30 μg of protein from the medium of either untransfected CHO cells (ACEH−) or from CHO cells expressing ACEH (ACEH+). Hydrolysis products were resolved by HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.”A, 100 μm angiotensin I, ACEH−; B,100 μm angiotensin I, ACEH+; C, 100 μm angiotensin I, ACEH+, and 10 mm EDTA;D, 100 μm angiotensin I, ACEH+, and 10 μm lisinopril; E, 100 μmangiotensin II, ACEH+; and F, 500 μmbradykinin, ACEH+.

This was located in a sequence submitted to the data base by the Human Genome Sequencing Center, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX. The sequence, obtained from Genome Systems Human BAC library, was defined as Homo sapiens Xp22, BAC GS-594A7 and has accession number AC003669. The ACEH gene contains 18 exons, interspersed with 17 introns, spans approximately 40 kb, and is localized to chromosome X, position p22. All the intron-exon junction sequences (Table I) follow the GT/AG rule of Breathnach and Chambon (26Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar). Exon sizes range from 59 nucleotides to 981 nucleotides. There is remarkable size similarity between the sizes of exons 1–4 of ACEH and exons 1–4 of ACE and also exons 7–12 of ACEH and 6–11 of ACE (Fig. 5). Exon 9 of ACEH contains the HEXXH zinc metalloprotease consensus sequence, whereas exon 8 contains the first HEXXH motif in the genomic sequence of ACE.Table INucleotide sequence of the intron-exon junctions in the human ACEH geneExon no.

Following the identification of a novel zinc metalloprotease from an EST data base, we have determined its cDNA sequence, expressed it as a soluble protein, and determined its activity toward potentially important physiological substrates. As a single domain enzyme, ACEH is similar to AnCE and ACEr, the insect members of the ACE family. When compared with the human ACE isoforms, ACEH shares considerable homology which is particularly marked around the HEXXH zinc-binding domain. This sequence (HEMGH) is identical in ACE and ACEH. A conserved glutamic acid residue, 24 amino acids downstream of the HEXXH motif in ACEH, aligns with the critical glutamate necessary for the catalytic activity of ACE (24Williams T.A. Corvol P. Soubrier F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29430-29434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This glutamate serves as the third zinc coordinating ligand. ACEH also contains 8 cysteine residues 6 of which are conserved in the N- and C-terminal domains of endothelial ACE and of testicular ACE. ACEH contains 7 potentialN-linked glycosylation sites (compared with 10 and 7 in the N- and C-terminal domains of endothelial ACE, respectively) and is therefore likely to be glycosylated. This is further reinforced by the molecular mass of truncated, expressed ACEH that migrates at ∼120 kDa compared with the deglycosylated polypeptide that migrates at 85 kDa. There is a putative transmembrane domain of 22 amino acids near the C terminus followed by a cluster of charged residues that are likely to constitute a stop-transfer sequence. In contrast, the transmembrane sequence of ACE is predicted to be only 17 amino acids, which is a minimal requirement for a membrane-spanning region. Together with the 17-amino acid signal sequence at the N terminus of ACEH, the enzyme has all the features of a type I integral membrane protein, like ACE. We have shown that a soluble form of ACEH, lacking the transmembrane and cytosolic domains, is secreted from CHO cells and that this form is catalytically active. Surprisingly, ACEH appears to be acting specifically as a carboxypeptidase, rather than as a peptidyl dipeptidase, as it is able to cleave exclusively the C-terminal residues from both angiotensin I and angiotensin II. Bradykinin, which has a C-terminal arginyl residue, is not hydrolyzed, suggesting a carboxypeptidase A-like specificity for ACEH. However, ACEH does not have a typical carboxypeptidase A-like zinc-binding motif (27Vendrall J. Querol E. Avilés F.X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 284-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Several ACE inhibitors (lisinopril, captopril, and enalaprilat) were not able to inhibit the cleavage of angiotensin I by ACEH, although the metal-chelating agent, EDTA, was an effective inhibitor, showing complete inhibition at 10 mm. This reinforces the proposition that ACEH is a metalloprotease, but with a distinct substrate and inhibitor specificity from ACE. It is perhaps not unexpected that the typical ACE inhibitors do not inhibit ACEH as they have been designed to compete with peptides that are hydrolyzed to release C-terminal dipeptides. Hence, positioning of the inhibitors in the active site should not be in the correct conformation to affect the cleavage of a single amino acid from the C terminus of the substrate. The high expression of ACEH mRNA in heart and kidney is of interest as these organs are important contributors to blood pressure homeostasis. The highest expression of ACEH mRNA, however, is in testis. Testicular ACE is known to play a key role in fertility (28Krege J.H. John S.W.M. Langenbach L.L. Hodgin J.B. Hagaman J.R. Bachman E.S. Jennette J.C. O'Brien D.A. Smithies O. Nature. 1995; 375: 146-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar,29Esther Jr., C.R. Howard T.E. Marino E.M. Goddard J.M. Capecchi M.R. Bernstein K.E. Lab. Invest. 1996; 74: 953-965PubMed Google Scholar), and ACEH may also therefore have reproductive functions. The tissue distribution of ACE mRNA is more widespread than ACEH, with both 3.5- and 4.2-kb species present in most of the tissues examined. The genomic sequence of ACEH holds many similarities to the structure of the ACE gene. The sizes of many of the exons are identical. There is, however, a discrepancy at exons 5 and 6 of ACEH, which together appear to correspond with exon 5 of ACE, suggesting a fusion of two exons. The HEXXH motif is therefore located in exon 9 of ACEH but exon 8 of the ACE gene. The ACEH gene is located on the X chromosome (Xp22) which is similar to the location (Xp22.1) of another membrane metalloproteinase, the product of the PEX gene associated with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (30Francis F. Hennig S. Korn B. Reinhardt R. de Jong P. Poustka A. Lehrach H. Rowe P.S.N. Goulding J.N. Summerfield T. Mountford R. Read A.P. Popowska E. Pronicka E. Davies K.E. O'Riordan J.L.H. Econs M.J.

FASEB J. 1997; 11: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings indicate that ACEH is a metalloprotease that may have a significant role not only in cardiovascular homeostasis but also in fertility. However, before the physiological roles of ACEH can be elucidated, further enzyme characterization is needed to identify selective inhibitors and the key residues that distinguish its activity from that of ACE itself.

https://openalex.org/W2077641423,"Here we report the molecular identification of cytosolic glutathione (GSH)-dependent prostaglandin (PG) E2 synthase (cPGES), a terminal enzyme of the cyclooxygenase (COX)-1-mediated PGE2 biosynthetic pathway. GSH-dependent PGES activity in the cytosol of rat brains, but not of other tissues, increased 3-fold after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Peptide microsequencing of purified enzyme revealed that it was identical to p23, which is reportedly the weakly bound component of the steroid hormone receptor/hsp90 complex. Recombinant p23 expressed in Escherichia coli and 293 cells exhibited all the features of PGES activity detected in rat brain cytosol. A tyrosine residue near the N terminus (Tyr9), which is known to be critical for the activity of cytosolic GSHS-transferases, was essential for PGES activity. The expression of cPGES/p23 was constitutive and was unaltered by proinflammatory stimuli in various cells and tissues, except that it was increased significantly in rat brain after LPS treatment. cPGES/p23 was functionally linked with COX-1 in marked preference to COX-2 to produce PGE2 from exogenous and endogenous arachidonic acid, the latter being supplied by cytosolic phospholipase A2 in the immediate response. Thus, functional coupling between COX-1 and cPGES/p23 may contribute to production of the PGE2 that plays a role in maintenance of tissue homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2052315279,"Glucosinolates are natural plant products known as flavor compounds, cancer-preventing agents, and biopesticides. We report cloning and characterization of the cytochrome P450 CYP79B2 from Arabidopsis. Heterologous expression of CYP79B2 in Escherichia coli shows that CYP79B2 catalyzes the conversion of tryptophan to indole-3-acetaldoxime. Recombinant CYP79B2 has a K(m) of 21 microm and a V(max) of 7.78 nmol/h/ml culture. Inhibitor studies show that CYP79B2 is different from a previously described enzyme activity that converts tryptophan to indole-3-acetaldoxime (Ludwig-Muller, J. , and Hilgenberg, W. (1990) Phytochemistry, 29, 1397-1400). CYP79B2 is wound-inducible and expressed in leaves, stem, flowers, and roots, with the highest expression in roots. Arabidopsis overexpressing CYP79B2 has increased levels of indole glucosinolates, which strongly indicates that CYP79B2 is involved in indole glucosinolate biosynthesis. Our data show that oxime production by CYP79s is not restricted to those amino acids that are precursors for cyanogenic glucosides. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that indole glucosinolates have evolved from cyanogenesis. Indole-3-acetaldoxime is a precursor of the plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid, which suggests that CYP79B2 might function in biosynthesis of indole-3-acetic acid. Identification of CYP79B2 provides an important tool for modification of the indole glucosinolate content to improve nutritional value and pest resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2010416572,"The amyloidogenic Aβ peptide is liberated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by two proteolytic activities, β-secretase and γ-secretase. Recently, a type I membrane protein termed BACE (β-site APP cleaving enzyme) with characteristics of an aspartyl protease has been identified as the β-secretase. We undertook a series of biochemical and morphological investigations designed to characterize the basic properties of this protein. Initial studies indicated that BACE undergoes N-linked glycosylation at three of four potential sites. Metabolic pulse-chase experiments revealed that after core glycosylation, BACE is rapidly and efficiently transported to the Golgi apparatus and distal secretory pathway. BACE was also found to be quite stable, being turned over with a t 12 of ∼16 h. Retention of BACE in the endoplasmic reticulum by introduction of a C-terminal dilysine motif prevented complex carbohydrate processing and demonstrated that propeptide cleavage occurs after exit from this organelle. BACE exhibited intramolecular disulfide bonding but did not form oligomeric structures by standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and sedimented as a monomer in sucrose velocity gradients. Immunofluorescence studies showed a largely vesicular staining pattern for BACE that colocalized well with endosomal, but not lysosomal, markers. Measurable levels of BACE were also detected on the plasma membrane by both immunostaining and cell surface biotinylation, and cycling of the protein between the cell membrane and the endosomes was documented. A cytoplasmic dileucine motif was found to be necessary for normal targeting of BACE to the endosomal system and accumulation of the protein in this intracellular site.

Wong C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4170) Google Scholar). The deposition of Aβ is believed by many to initiate the crucial series of pathological events that ultimately lead to neuron loss and dementia (2Selkoe D.J.

The peptide is then thought to form insoluble aggregates, which amass in brain tissue eventually forming the pathognomonic lesions associated with the disease (5Jarrett J.T. Lansbury Jr., P.T.

The seemingly pivotal role played by Aβ in AD pathogenesis underscores the importance of thoroughly characterizing the proteases involved with the generation of the peptide. Presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 have been shown to mediate γ-secretase activity (6De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F.

BACE itself constitutes the predominant β-secretase activity in human brain tissue (12Sinha S. Anderson J.P. Barbour R. Basi G.S. Caccavello R. Davis D. Doan M. Dovey H.F. Frigon N. Hong J.

Furthermore, immunostaining reveals the presence of BACE in endosomes, one of several intracellular sites where Aβ is thought to be produced (9Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A.

Although the evidence that BACE is the Alzheimer's disease β-secretase is quite compelling, little is known about its behaviorin vivo. More specifically, the cellular compartments where BACE is active and presumably interacts with APP remain largely unestablished as does the nature of the interaction between the two proteins. Reports have localized the generation of Aβ to the endosomal system (15Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol.

BACE could presumably act on APP in any or all of these regions. To begin to address these issues more adequately, we undertook a series of biochemical and morphological investigations designed to characterize the basic properties of BACE. In this report, we demonstrate BACE to be a stable, monomeric protein that, after core glycosylation in the ER, is rapidly and efficiently transported to the Golgi apparatus before targeting to the endosomal system. Cycling of BACE between endosomes and the cell surface is shown. We also demonstrate that a dileucine motif on the cytoplasmic tail of BACE plays an important role in the normal trafficking of the protein to endocytic compartments. Wild type BACE was generated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, cloned into pcDNA3.1, and its sequence was confirmed. All other BACE constructs were generated by oligonucleotide-based mutagenesis after which they were T-A-cloned into the pTargetTMeukaryotic expression vector (Promega). Expression in 293 and HeLa cells was obtained using Geneporter transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego CA) with a DNA/Geneporter ratio of approximately 1 μg/10 μl. 293 and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. N-terminal (ETDEEPEEPGRRGSFVEC) and C-terminal (LRQQHDDFADDISLL) BACE peptides were generated and used to produce rabbit polyclonal antisera. BACE constructs containing a C-terminal influenza hemagglutinin antigenic tag (HA) were detected using either a polyclonal (polyclonal antibody HA11; Covance, Richmond, CA) or a monoclonal antibody (mAb HA11; Covance) directed against the HA epitope. Immunoprecipitations and Western blots were performed by standard methods. 293 cells in 6-well plates (∼1 million cells per well) were preincubated in methionine/cysteine-free (starve) medium for 30 min after which they were incubated in starve medium supplemented with 0.5 mCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine per well. For pulse-chase studies, cells expressing BACE-HA were metabolically labeled as described above after which they were quenched in starve medium supplemented with a 100 molar excess of cold methionine/cysteine. The cells were then chased in normal growth medium for a variable amount of time after which they were washed, lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl), and immunoprecipitated with mAb HA11. Conditions were carefully defined to ensure quantitative immunoprecipitations using mAb HA11. Immunoprecipitates were eluted by boiling in 1× Laemmli sample buffer plus 0.34 m β-mercaptoethanol for 3–5 min. Samples were then electrophoresed on 8% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen for 24–48 h. PhosphorImager screens were read on a Storm 860 Scanner and bands were quantified in ImageQuant version 1.11. Immunoprecipitates from pulse-chase experiments were eluted by boiling in 25 μl of 0.1% SDS, 0.1 m BME for 5 min. Each sample was then divided into two 12.5-μl aliquots, one of which was treated with 7.5 μl of 0.5m sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 37.5 μl of H2O, 5 μl of 1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in isopropyl alcohol, and 5 μl of 0.5 units/ml Endo H (Sigma), whereas the other was treated with the same reaction mixture with H2O substituted for Endo H. The digestions were incubated overnight at 30 °C and stopped by the addition of 6× Laemmli sample buffer plus 2m BME. Samples were then electrophoresed on 8% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen for 36–48 h. 293 cells expressing BACE-HA or BACE-HAKK were metabolically labeled for 2.5 h, lysed in RIPA buffer, and immunoprecipitated with mAb HA11. Immunoprecipitates were eluted by boiling in 25 μl of 0.1% SDS, 0.1 m BME for 5 min, and separated into 10-μl aliquots. To each aliquot was then added 3 μl of 0.5 m Tris·Cl, pH 8.6, 5 μl of H2O, 2 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40, and 5 μl of 250 milliunits/ml PNGase F (Glyco). For negative controls, 0.5m Tris·Cl, pH 8.6, was added instead of PNGase F. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for a variable times after which they were stopped by the addition of 6× Laemmli sample buffer plus 2m BME. Samples were then electrophoresed on 8% polyacrylamide gels, dried down, and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen for 36–48 h. 293 cells in 35-mm dishes expressing BACE-HA were lysed in either 1% Triton X-100 or 50 mm CHAPS lysis buffer (each with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA). Lysates were rocked for approximately 1 h on ice after which they were loaded on 5–20% continuous sucrose gradients containing either 0.1% Triton X-100 or 25 mm CHAPS. Gradients were spun in an SW40 ultracentrifuge rotor at 4 °C for 20 h at 40,000 rpm. They were then spit into 15 fractions of roughly 750 μl. 20–30 μl of each fraction were electrophoresed on 8% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with mAb HA11. HeLa cells on coverslips expressing the appropriate BACE construct were fixed and permeabilized in ice-cold methanol. They were then washed with PBS at room temperature and processed with the appropriate primary antibody diluted in PBS supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.02% saponin. BACE-HA was detected with polyclonal antibody HA11. A monoclonal antibody directed against the transferrin receptor was used to detect endosomes (mAb B3/25; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), whereas lysosomes were detected with monoclonal antibodies directed against either LAMP 1 or LAMP 2 (mAb B3/25 or mAb H4B4 respectively; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, the University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). The cells were then incubated with fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies also diluted in PBS with 2% FBS and 0.02% saponin. Secondary antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) and consisted of either the Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit or Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse. After antibody staining, coverslips were mounted on slides with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc., Birmingham, AL) and sealed with nail polish. Fluorescence was examined at 60× with either a Nikon E600 microscope utilizing UV illumination or with a Bio-Rad MCR 1024 confocal microscope. For surface staining, cells expressing the appropriate BACE construct were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde after which they were either permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature or left untreated. The cells were then washed 3 times with PBS and incubated with either mAb HA11 or BN-1 diluted in PBS supplemented with 2% FBS. An Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse secondary was used for these procedures. Coverslips were mounted and observed as described above. Transferrin uptake experiments were performed as follows. Cells expressing BACE-HA were incubated in serum-free medium for 15 min at 37 °C, after which they were treated with the same medium supplemented with biotinylated transferrin (50 μg/ml) for 30 min. Cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized, and treated with the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. BACE-HA was visualized with mAb HA11 while a streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate secondary (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) was used to detect biotinylated transferrin. Unless otherwise stated, all reagents for biotinylation procedures were kept on ice. 293 cells in 35-mm dishes expressing the appropriate BACE construct were placed on ice and washed twice with KRPH buffer (128 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 1.25 mm MgSO4, 5 mmNa2HPO4, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Cells were then incubated in KRPH supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml EZ-LinkTM Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) for 30 min after which they were washed three times with KRPH plus 20 mmglycine. The final wash was allowed to sit for 15 min. The cells were then washed twice more with KRPH, lysed in RIPA buffer, and immunoprecipitated with mAb HA11. Immunoprecipitates were eluted by boiling in 1× Laemmli samples buffer without BME, electrophoresed on 8% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with 125I-streptavidin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were then exposed to a PhosphorImager screen for 24–36 h. For internalization experiments, cells were biotinylated as described above. However, instead of proceeding directly to lysis, the cells were returned to pre-warmed 37 °C growth media for a variable amount of time after which they were washed twice with KRPH and incubated in cleavage buffer (50 mm glutathione (Sigma), 90 mm NaCl, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 1.25 mmMgSO4, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, pH 8.6) for two intervals of 15 min each. After cleavage, the cells were washed twice with KRPH plus 20 mm glycine. The second wash was allowed to sit for 15 min. The cells were then washed twice more with KRPH and lysed in RIPA buffer. For detecting BACE recycling to the cell surface, this procedure was modified slightly. After the final KRPH wash, cells were returned once more to pre-warmed 37 °C growth media for either 30 or 60 min after which they were washed, treated with cleavage buffer, and lysed in a manner identical to internalization experiments. As a control for protein degradation and cell loss, one dish of cells was not treated with cleavage buffer a second time before lysis. Immunoprecipitations and Western blots proceeded as described previously for cell surface biotinylation experiments. BACE is a type I integral membrane protein containing 4 potential N-linked glycosylation sites and 6 extracellular/lumenal cysteine residues potentially involved in inter- or intramolecular disulfide bonding. To facilitate our characterization of BACE, an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigenic tag was introduced to the C terminus of the protein (BACE-HA) (Fig. 1 A). In addition, antisera were raised against N- and C-terminal peptide sequences (Fig. 1 A, BN-1 and BC-1). Both BACE and BACE-HA were found by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to increase Aβ secretion by ∼50% in cells stably expressing APPwt (data not shown), consistent with published reports (9Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jaronsinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burgess T. Louis J.-C. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3271) Google Scholar) and confirming the biological activity of our constructs. For biochemical studies, BACE constructs were expressed transiently in human embryonic kidney 293 cells using pcDNA3 vectors. These cells were used because they are easily transfectable and, due to the absence of the SV40T antigen, yield more modest levels of BACE expression than can be obtained in 293T cells. Immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled BACE from 293 cells with either BN-1, BC-1, or mAb HA11 showed that both BACE and BACE-HA migrated as a tight ∼58-kDa band coupled with a more diffuse ∼66-kDa band (Fig. 1 B). When a dilysine ER retention motif was placed on the C terminus of BACE-HA (BACE-HAKK) (Fig. 1 A), the resulting protein was effectively sequestered in the ER (Fig. 4 B). Immunoprecipitation of BACE-HAKK revealed that the ∼66-kDa band was no longer apparent (see Fig. 1 C, lanes 1 and 3), suggesting that the ∼58-kDa band represents the immature ER resident species, whereas the ∼66-kDa band corresponds to a mature form of BACE that has undergone further modification, most likely in the Golgi apparatus. Previous work has shown BACE to be N-linked glycosylated (9Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jaronsinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burgess T. Louis J.-C. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3271) Google Scholar). We confirmed this finding by subjecting radiolabeled BACE-HA and BACE-HAKK to digestion with peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F), an enzyme that effectively removes all N-linked oligosaccharide side chains from glycoproteins. PNGase F treatment reduced the majority of both BACE-HA and BACE-HAKK down to a single ∼46-kDa species, indicating the presence of N-linked sugars on the translated protein (Fig. 1 C). It should be noted that PNGase F-digested BACE-HA migrated slightly faster than PNGase F-digested BACE-HAKK, which is retained in the ER. The reason for this is not clear, but a previous study has suggested that BACE undergoes a propeptide cleavage event (13Lin X. Koelsch G. Wu S. Downs D. Dashti A. Tang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1456-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that this cleavage occurs only after BACE exits the ER. The number ofN-linked sites on BACE that were core-glycosylated was estimated by treating radiolabeled BACE-HAKK with PNGase F for different amounts of time (Fig. 1 D). BACE-HAKK was used to simplify the banding pattern since this ER-restricted form of BACE exists only as the 58-kDa immature species (Fig. 1 C). SDS-PAGE analysis of the resulting reaction mixtures revealed the presence of four bands, each roughly 4 kDa apart, most likely representing fully glycosylated BACE-HAKK and a triad of deglycosylated species with either one, two, or three oligosaccharide side chains removed. This suggests that three out of four potentialN-linked sites on BACE are utilized during glycosylation in the ER. In order to gain a better understanding of BACE maturation, we performed a series of metabolic pulse-chase experiments. 293 cells transfected with BACE-HA were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine and chased in non-radioactive media for various times up to 24 h. Subsequent cell lysis and quantitative immunoprecipitation with mAb-HA11 followed by SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the ∼58-kDa immature species quickly and efficiently matured into the more diffusely migrating ∼66-kDa species at later time points (Fig.2 A). That the ∼66-kDa species does indeed correspond to a Golgi-modified form of BACE was confirmed by treating radiolabeled protein collected from pulse-chase studies with endoglycosidase H (Endo H), an enzyme that removes immature but not medial Golgi-processed N-linked oligosaccharide side chains. Thus, Golgi modification ofN-linked sugars renders them resistant to Endo H cleavage. We found that while immature ∼58-kDa BACE-HA was sensitive to Endo H, mature ∼66-kDa BACE-HA was resistant (Fig. 2 B). This finding verified our presumption that BACE maturation involves transport to the Golgi apparatus where all three oligosaccharide side chains of the protein are modified. Quantification of pulse-chase data compiled from multiple experiments allowed us to measure the kinetics of BACE maturation and turnover. BACE transport from the ER occurred rapidly and efficiently. Mature Golgi-modified BACE-HA was initially detected at the 30-min time point, and by the 2-h time point constituted ∼75% of total protein (Fig.2 C). By this time, a small amount of immature BACE-HA remained, although it clearly represented a minority species. We also found BACE to be a highly stable protein with a t 12of ∼16 h. The kinetics of BACE turnover was not significantly affected by either lactacystin, a specific proteasome inhibitor, or chloroquine, an agent that disrupts the acidification of endosomes and lysosomes (data not shown). Many cellular and viral membrane proteins form homo- or hetero-oligomeric complexes, the formation of which is a prerequisite for exit from the ER as well as for normal protein function (23Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). Therefore, we considered the possibility that BACE might form stable complexes with itself and/or other proteins. To address this, we conducted a series of investigations designed to isolate higher molecular weight species immunoreactive for BACE. Lysates from 293 cells expressing BACE-HA were analyzed by Western blot with mAb HA11 after incubation at either 37, 55, or 95 °C in the presence or absence of β-mercaptoethanol (BME) (Fig.3 A). In the presence of reducing agent, BACE migrated as the characteristic doublet described previously with no evidence of higher molecular weight complexes, regardless of temperature. In the absence of reducing agent, BACE migrated more quickly as a single band, as would be expected of a protein containing intramolecular disulfide bonds. At lower temperatures, a small amount of BACE migrated as a higher molecular weight species. Although this could reflect the presence of BACE oligomers that exhibit some degree of SDS resistance, it could also be due to SDS-induced aggregation. Therefore, we employed an additional technique to determine if BACE forms oligomeric complexes. Velocity gradient sedimentation was used as an alternative strategy to search for high molecular weight BACE complexes. 293 cells expressing BACE-HA were solubilized in either Triton X-100 or CHAPS lysis buffer. The lysates were then loaded on continuous sucrose velocity gradients, centrifuged for 20 h, and fractionated. Aliquots from each fraction were screened for BACE-HA by Western blot with mAb HA11 (Fig.3 B). In the presence of either Triton X-100 or CHAPS, BACE sedimented in a single, low density peak. The presence of high molecular weight complexes would have led to significant amounts of BACE in higher density fractions. Thus, this result is consistent with BACE existing primarily as a monomer. To characterize accurately the cellular distribution of BACE, we performed a series of immunofluorescence experiments using both conventional and confocal microscopy. HeLa cells expressing a variety of BACE constructs were fixed and permeabilized. They were then stained with either BN-1, mAb-HA11, or a rabbit polyclonal antisera recognizing the HA epitope. Costaining with antibodies directed against a variety of organelle markers was also performed. BACE-HA demonstrated a highly punctate staining pattern reminiscent of vesicular compartments (Fig. 4 A). An identical distribution was observed for BACE lacking the HA antigenic tag (data not shown). By contrast, cells expressing BACE-HAKK exhibited primarily nuclear envelope and ER immunoreactivity (Fig.4 B). BACE-HA staining colocalized well with that of the transferrin receptor, a well known endosomal marker (Fig. 4,D–F). Colocalization with early (Fig. 4, J–L) and late (Fig. 4, M–O) lysosomal markers, however, was much less apparent."

We previously identified several homocysteine-responsive genes in cultured human vascular endothelial cells, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident molecular chaperone GRP78/BiP. Here, we demonstrate that homocysteine induces the ER stress response and leads to the expression of a novel protein, Herp, containing a ubiquitin-like domain at the N terminus. mRNA expression of Herp was strongly up-regulated by inducers of ER stress, including mercaptoethanol, tunicamycin, A23187, and thapsigargin. The ER stress-dependent induction of Herp was also observed at the protein level. Immunochemical analyses using Herp-specific antibodies indicated that Herp is a 54-kDa, membrane-associated ER protein. Herp is the first integral membrane protein regulated by the ER stress response pathway. Both the N and C termini face the cytoplasmic side of the ER; this membrane topology makes it unlikely that Herp acts as a molecular chaperone for proteins in the ER, in contrast to GRP78 and other ER stress-responsive proteins. Herp may, therefore, play an unknown role in the cellular survival response to stress."

We have previously shown that ROC1-CUL1 is a core subassembly within the SCF-ROC1 complex, capable of supporting the polymerization of ubiquitin. This report describes that the CUL1 subunit of the bacterially expressed, unmodified ROC1-CUL1 complex is conjugated with Nedd8 at Lys-720 by HeLa cell extracts or by a purified Nedd8 conjugation system (consisting of APP-BP1/Uba3, Ubc12, and Nedd8). This covalent linkage of Nedd8 to CUL1 is both necessary and sufficient to markedly enhance the ability of the ROC1-CUL1 complex to promote ubiquitin polymerization. A mutation of Lys-720 to arginine in CUL1 eliminates the Nedd8 modification, abolishes the activation of the ROC1-CUL1 ubiquitin ligase complex, and significantly reduces the ability of SCFHOS/β-TRCP-ROC1 to support the ubiquitination of phosphorylated IκBα.

However, little is known about regulation of the enzymatic mechanism through which a polyubiquitin chain is formed and attached onto a given substrate. The ROC1-CUL1 complex was initially identified as a core subassembly within the SCFHOS/β-TRCP-ROC1 E3 ligase complex (4Tan P. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Wu K. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.Q. Mol.

A unique biochemical feature of the ROC1-CUL1 complex is its intrinsic ability to support the polymerization of Ub molecules in the presence of E1 and Cdc34 (4Tan P. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Wu K. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 527-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) or Ubc4/5 (5Ohta T. Michel J.J. Schottelius A.J. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 535-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The Ub conjugates formed appear to correspond to unanchored Ub polymers, suggesting that the Cdc34/ROC1-CUL1 ligase system catalyzes Ub self-ligation. This notion was strongly supported by the observation that (SCFHOS/β-TRCP-ROC1)/Cdc34 synthesized Ub polymers, ranging in size from dimers to octamers, migrated identically to those produced by E2–25K (9Wu K. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Tan P. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1382-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), which has been shown to catalyze the polymerization of Ub free chains (10Chen Z. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21835-21842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism and biological significance of this self-ligation reaction is presently unclear. However, this reaction obviates the requirement for a specific substrate, thus providing a sensitive assay to measure the capacity of Cdc34 and SCFHOS/β-TRCP-ROC1, or ROC1-CUL1, to support Ub polymerization. It has been reported that, in yeast, Rbx1/Hrt1 (ROC1) complexed with either SCF or Cdc53 (CUL1 homologue) alone catalyzed the extensive auto-ubiquitination of Cdc34 (7Skowyra D. Koepp D.M. Kamura T.

It is possible that the high molecular weight Ub ligation products produced by the mammalian Cdc34/ROC1-CUL1 system also contains some auto-ubiquitinated Cdc34 species. The ROC1-CUL1 mediated Ub ligase activity requires an intact ROC1 RING-H2 finger domain, in which eight conserved residues Cys-42, Cys-45, Cys-75, His-77, His-80, Cys-83, Cys-94, and Asp-97 have been identified as being essential for the ligase function (5Ohta T.

Meanwhile, the N terminus is required for binding to Skp1 (9Wu K. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Tan P. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell.

These distinct modules work in tandem to mediate the ubiquitination of the sequestered substrate protein. It has previously been shown that Nedd8 or its orthologue Rub1, small Ub-like proteins, modify several members of the cullin/Cdc53 family (18Hochstrasser M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 901-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 19Liakopoulos D Doenges G. Matuschewski K. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2208-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Studies with budding yeast have shown that deletion of RUB1 alone had no significant growth defect (20Lammer D. Mathias N. Laplaza J.M. Jiang W. Liu Y. Callis J. Goebl M. Estelle M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 914-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). However, when mutations in Cdc34, Cdc53, or Skp1 were combined with the RUB1 deletion, the growth and cell cycle defects of the former group were enhanced significantly (20Lammer D. Mathias N. Laplaza J.M. Jiang W. Liu Y. Callis J. Goebl M. Estelle M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 914-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Recently, Osaka and co-workers (21Osaka F. Saeki M. Katayama S. Aida N. Toh-E A Kominami K. Toda T. Suzuki T. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Kato S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3475-3484Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) have shown that the Nedd8-modifying pathway is essential for cell viability and function of CUL1 in fission yeast (21Osaka F. Saeki M. Katayama S. Aida N. Toh-E A Kominami K. Toda T. Suzuki T. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Kato S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3475-3484Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inactivation of theSMC1 (APP-BP1 homologue) gene, encoding for a subunit of the Nedd8 activating enzyme, caused cells to undergo multiple S phases without intervening mitosis (22Handeli S. Weintraub H. Cell. 1992; 71: 599-611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Nedd8 plays an important regulatory role in cell proliferation and raise an intriguing question as to whether the Nedd8 pathway exerts its regulatory function through its conjugation to cullin/Cdc53 proteins. In this report, we have provided compelling evidence demonstrating that Nedd8 is conjugated to CUL1 at residue Lys-720 and that this modification markedly stimulates the ability of ROC1-CUL1 to support Ub polymerization. These studies illustrate that, although phosphorylation triggers substrate targeting in the SCF-ROC1 pathway, Nedd8 modification provides a means to up-regulate the Ub polymerization activity, leading to efficient degradation of the targeted protein substrates. To construct a plasmid allowing for the simultaneous expression of GST-fused, HA-tagged ROC1 and the C-terminal CUL1 fragment (aa 324–776) tagged with both a six-histidine and a Flag epitopes, the following three cloning steps were used. First, the multi-restriction cloning site from the pET-15b vector (Novagen) was inserted into the pGEX-4T3 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For this purpose, a pair of primers (GACGTCGATCGAGATCTCGATCCCGC (5′) and CCACCTGACGTCTAAGAAACC (3′); with AatII sites in bold letters) were used to amplify the desired pET-15b cloning site-containing fragment, and this segment was then cloned into PCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) using the procedure described previously (9Wu K. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Tan P. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1382-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This was then followed by excising the pET-15b cloning site sequence by restriction digestion using AatII, and the resultingAatII fragment was subsequently inserted into pGEX-4T3 to create the hybrid vector, pGEX-4T3/pET-15b. Second, HA-ROC1 was cloned into pGEX-4T3/pET-15b. To do this, the HA-ROC1 sequence was PCR-amplified using pcDNA-HA-ROC1 (5Ohta T. Michel J.J. Schottelius A.J. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 535-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) as a template with primers GTCGACAGCCAAGCTATGTACCCATACG (5′) and CTAGTGCCCATACTT TTGGAATTC (3′) (with SalI site in bold letters). The PCR fragment was then cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector, and the HA-ROC1 sequence was excised using SalI digestion and inserted into the pGEX-4T3 cloning site on the pGEX-4T3/pET-15b vector. In this manner, GST was fused with HA-ROC1 in frame. This vector is designated as pGEX-4T3/pET- 15b-(GST-HA-ROC1). Finally, to clone the FLAG-CUL1(324–776) sequence into the pGEX-4T3/pET-15b-(GST-HA-ROC1) vector, the DNA was amplified by PCR using pcDNA FLAG-CUL1(324–776) plasmid (9Wu K. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Tan P. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell.

The resulting PCR fragment was cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector, and the FLAG-CUL1(324–776) sequence was excised using NdeI digestion followed by insertion into the pET-15b cloning site on the pGEX-4T3/pET-15b-(GST-HA-ROC1) vector. This insertion also added a six-histidine epitope at the N terminus of FLAG-CUL1(324–776). The final vector is designated as pGEX-4T3/pET-15b-(GST-HA-ROC1)-(His-Flag-CUL1(324–776)). For simplicity, throughout the text, the (GST-HA-ROC1)-(His-Flag-CUL1(324–776)) complex is named GST-ROC1-CUL1324–776, while (HA-ROC1)-(His-Flag-CUL1(324–776)) is called ROC1-CUL1324–776. To construct mutant CUL1(K720R)324–776or CUL1K720R, the QuickChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was employed per manufacturer's instructions using pGEX-4T3/pET-15b-(GST-HA-ROC1)-(His-Flag-CUL1(324–776)) or pCDNA3.1 FLAG-CUL1 as a template with primers CTACTGATTCAGGCGGCGATCGTGAGAATCATGCGCATGAGGAAGGTTCTG and CAGAACCTTCCTCATGCGCATGATTCTCACGATCGCCGCCTGAATCAGTAG. To construct CUL1324–719, the QuickChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was employed using pGEX-4T3/pET-15b-(GST-HA-ROC1)-(His-Flag-CUL1(324–776)) as a template with primers CTACTGATTCAGGCGGCGATCGTGAGAATCATGTAGATGAGGAAGGTTCTG and CAGAACCTTCCTCATCTACATGATTCTCACGATCGCCGCCTGAATCAGTAG, which mutated the sequence coding Lys-720 to a stop codon. Human UBC12 sequence was amplified by PCR from pCDNA3 MYC-UBC12 (kindly provided by Y. Xiong) and inserted into pCR2.1 using the following primers (AGATCTATGATCAAGCTGTTCTCGCTG (5′) and CTATTTCAGGCAGCGC TCAAAG) (with BglII site in bold letters). The UBC12 sequence was then excised using BglII and NotI and inserted into pGEX-4T3 (digested with BamHI andNotI) to create pGEX-4T3-GST-UBC12. pGEX-4T3/pET-15b-(GST-HA-ROC1)-(His-FLAG-CUL1(324–776)) was transformed into BL21 (DE3) and grown in LB (0.5 liter) with 0.4% glucose in the presence of ampicillin at 37 °C. Cultures were then cooled to room temperature when the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.5. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.2 mm was added to induce the culture overnight (12–14 h) at 25 °C. Cells were pelleted at 5,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 1/25 culture volume of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5M NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4 μg/ml antipain, 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 mm DTT). The resuspended material was then sonicated (four repetitive 20-s treatments) and centrifuged at 17,000 rpm in an SS-34 rotor for 30 min, 4 °C. The supernatant was saved. For glutathione affinity purification, indicated amounts of extracts were adsorbed to the beads (20 μl) and excess bacteria proteins were removed by washing the beads three times with lysis buffer followed by two washes with buffer A (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 μg/ml antipain, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) plus 50 mm NaCl. Typically, 10 μl of GST-ROC1-CUL1324–776-containing extracts yielded approximately 5 pmol of the complex bound to the glutathione beads. To generate the ROC1-CUL1324–776 complex, GST-ROC1- CUL1324–776-containing extracts (10 ml) were bound to glutathione beads (0.5 ml). Thrombin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) cleavage was carried out on beads with 35 units in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h at 12 °C. More than 95% of GST-ROC1 was cleaved. This procedure yielded 0.6 mg of ROC1-CUL1324–776 with purity greater than 90% (Fig.1 A). Human E1 was isolated from cytosolic extracts of HeLa cells using a Ub affinity column as described previously (4Tan P. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Wu K. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 527-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Cdc34 was purified from extracts derived from Sf9 cells infected with mCdc34-baculovirus using a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-based affinity column (Qiagen) followed by a Q-Sepharose chromatographic step (4Tan P. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Wu K. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 527-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). GST-UBC12 was transformed into BL21 (DE3) and grown in LB (100 ml) with 0.4% glucose in the presence of ampicillin at 37 °C. Cultures were induced for 3 h, with 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside added when the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.5. Extracts (4 ml) were made using the same method as for GST-ROC1-CUL1324–776, mixed with glutathione beads (0.5 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer, and the mixture was rocked for 1 h at 4 °C. The slurry was then loaded onto a column and washed three times with 2 ml of lysis buffer, followed by washing twice with 2 ml of buffer A-50. GST-UBC12 was eluted with 20 mmglutathione in buffer A-50. 7.5 mg of GST-Ubc12 was obtained with purity greater than 95%. The pET3a-Nedd8 plasmid (kindly provided by C. Pickart) was transformed into BL21 (DE3). It was then expressed and harvested using the same method as GST-UBC12 except the protein was found in the pellet. The protein was solubilized and purified using a published procedure (23Whitby F.G. Xia G. Pickart C.M. Hill C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34983-34991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) with modifications. The inclusion body pellet was resuspended and washed three times with lysis buffer, and two times with centrifugation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 2% sucrose, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4 μg/ml antipain, 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin). The pellet was solubilized in urea buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 8m urea, and 2 mm EDTA) by rocking at room temperature for 30 min. Solubilized material was then clarified using the ultracentrifuge at 100,000 × g for 1 h, 16 °C. The clarified material was thoroughly dialyzed against dialysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mmEDTA, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, and 50 mm NaCl). The refolded protein was then concentrated using anM r 5,000 cut-off filter (Millipore) and passed through Q- and SP-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) columns, pre-equilibrated with dialysis buffer, consecutively. The flow-through from the SP column was then further purified on a Superdex-75 column using a fast protein liquid chromatograph. 3 mg of pure Nedd8 were obtained per 0.5 liter of induced culture. Human APP-BP1/Uba3 was purified from extracts of HeLa cells using a Nedd8 affinity column. To pack a Nedd8 affinity column, Nedd8 protein (4 mg/ml, 3 ml), maintained in 0.1 m NaHCO3 (pH 8.0), 0.5 m NaCl, was mixed with CH-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which was prepared by swelling 0.2 g of dried beads in 2.5 ml of 1 mm HCl, followed by washing the beads with 50 ml of 1 mm HCl. The mixture was rocked at 4 °C for 5 h. The reaction was stopped by removing the supernatant and incubating the beads in 1 m ethanolamine at room temperature for 1 h. Beads were then washed with alternating washes of low and high pH buffers (low: 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.0, 1 m NaCl; high: 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0). The beads were stored in buffer A-50, 4 °C. The estimated capacity is 18 mg of Nedd8/ml of beads. HeLa cell extracts (150 ml, 10 mg/ml), prepared as described previously (24Wobbe C.R. Dean F. Weissbach L. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5710-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), were extensively dialyzed against buffer A-50. Dialyzed extracts were then clarified by ultra centrifugation at 100,000 ×g, 4 °C, for 1 h. The extracts were adjusted to contain 50 mm creatine phosphate, pH 7.7, 10 mmMgCl2, 3 mm ATP, and 6.7 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase. This mixture was allowed to pass through the Nedd8-linked CH-Sepharose column by re-circulating overnight at 4 °C. The column was then washed with 100 ml of lysis buffer, followed by 100 ml of buffer A-50. Proteins were eluted by 20 mm DTT in buffer A-50 (15 ml). To separate APP-BP1/Uba3 from Ubc12, the 20 mm DTT-eluted material was passed on a Q-Sepharose column, pre-equilibrated with buffer A-50. The flow-through was found to contain Ubc12. After extensively washing the column with buffer A-50, the bound protein was eluted with a 10-ml gradient of 50–500 mm NaCl in buffer A. The peak of APP-BP1/Uba3 was eluted around 150 mm NaCl. Approximately 13 μg of APP-BP1/Uba3 were obtained. To sediment APP-BP1/Uba3 by glycerol gradient, Q-Sepharose fraction 21 (130 μl) was loaded onto the top of a 15–30% glycerol gradient (5 ml) containing buffer A plus 0.15 m NaCl. The gradient was run at 45,000 rpm (SW50.1 rotor) for 22 h at 4 °C. 34 fractions were collected. Recombinant GST-ROC1-CUL1324–776, immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose, or ROC1-CUL1324–776, bound to M2-matrix (Sigma), were added to a Ub ligation reaction mixture (30 μl) that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, 10 nm okadaic acid, 2 mm ATP, 0.6 mmDTT, 5 μg of [32P]Ub, 0.6 pmol of E1, and 10 pmol of Cdc34. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min, or otherwise specified. The bound protein was released by boiling the beads with 20 μl of 4-fold concentrated Laemmli loading buffer for 3 min prior to 12.5% SDS-PAGE analysis, followed by autoradiography. For NEDD8 conjugation to CUL1324–776 with HeLa extracts, glutathione bead-coupled GST-ROC1-CUL1324–776 was incubated with 40 mmCrPO4, pH 7.7, 0.5 mm DTT, 35 mmKCl, 0.4 mm EDTA, 3.4% glycerol, 7 mmMgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 50 μg/ml creatine kinase (Sigma), and 92 μg of HeLa extract protein. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. For NEDD8 conjugation to CUL1324–776 with purified components, M2 bead-bound ROC1-CUL1324–776 (1 μg) was incubated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 0.6 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 ng of APP-BP1/Uba3 (Q-Sepharose fraction 19), 0.6 μg of NEDD8 and GST-Ubc12 in amounts indicated. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. To activate the Ub ligase activity of the ROC1-CUL1 complex, glutathione bead-coupled GST-ROC1-CUL1324–776 was incubated with 40 mmCrPO4, pH 7.7, 0.5 mm DTT, 35 mmKCl, 0.4 mm EDTA, 3.4% glycerol, 7 mmMgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 50 μg/ml creatine kinase, and 92 μg of HeLa extract protein. After incubation at 37 °C for 60 min, the beads were washed three times with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.25% Nonidet P-40) and then were washed twice with buffer A-50. The resulting beads were then assayed for Ub ligation as described above. To activate the Ub ligase activity of the ROC1-CUL1 complex with purified NEDD8 conjugation components, M2 bead-bound ROC1-CUL1324–776 was modified by NEDD8 as described above. The treated beads were washed twice with buffer B and then twice with buffer A-50. The washed beads were then assayed for Ub ligation as described above. We have shown recently that the RING-H2 finger protein ROC1 specifically binds to the C terminus of CUL1 (spanning amino acid residues 324–776) in transfected 293T cells and that the resulting ROC1-CUL1324–776 complex is fully active in supporting Ub ligation (9Wu K. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Tan P. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1382-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To identify factors that may regulate the Ub ligase activity of the ROC1-CUL1 complex, we co-expressed GST-ROC1 with CUL1324–776 in E. coli. As shown in Fig.1 A, the two co-expressed proteins formed a complex that was co-purified from a glutathione affinity column (lane 2). The co-eluted ∼33-kDa polypeptides were probably proteolyzed or prematurely terminated products of GST-ROC1 since they reacted with anti-GST antibodies (data not shown). Furthermore, the GST moiety can be removed by thrombin digestion, yielding the ROC1-CUL1324–776 complex (lane 3). The Ub ligase activity of GST-ROC1-CUL1324–776 was measured by the previously established [32P]Ub incorporation assay (4Tan P. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Wu K. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.Q. Mol.

In this system, the bacterial-assembled GST-ROC1-CUL1324–776 complex was coupled to glutathione-beads and the resulting matrix was incubated with E1, Cdc34, and [32P]Ub. The results showed that GST-ROC1-CUL1324–776 converted monomeric Ub molecules into high molecular mass Ub polymers in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B,lanes 1–5). This reaction depended on the presence of Cdc34 as its omission abolished the reaction (lane 6). This result demonstrates that ROC1 and the CUL1324–776 fragment contain all of the essential elements that constitute a Ub polymerization activity. To explore whether the unmodified GST-ROC1-CUL1324–776could be activated, the glutathione beads coupled with the GST-ROC1-CUL1324–776 complex were incubated with HeLa cell extracts in the presence of an ATP regenerating system. Following a brief incubation, excess HeLa proteins were removed by extensively washing the beads. The treated-complex was then incubated with ubiquitination agents to initiate the Ub polymerization reaction. The results showed that the treated complex was significantly more active than the untreated complex in supporting Ub ligation (Fig.1 B, compare lanes 2–5 withlanes 7–10). As shown, the Ub ligase activity of the GST-ROC1-CUL1324–776 complex was increased up to 10-fold when low levels of the complex were used (Fig. 1 B,bottom panel). Of note, at the highest levels of GST-ROC1-CUL1324–776 used, the majority of monomeric Ub had been consumed (lanes 9 and 10), thus limiting the production of high molecular weight Ub conjugates. The depletion of the Ub substrate may have significantly resulted in the underestimation of the degree of activation in the presence of high levels of GST-ROC1-CUL1324–776. Additionally, the results from kinetic analysis indicated that the HeLa extract-treated GST-ROC1-CUL1324–776 promoted the polymerization of Ub molecules more rapidly than the mock-treated complex (data not shown). Subsequent immunoblot analysis revealed that a fraction of CUL1324–776 was conjugated with NEDD8 following incubation with HeLa extracts (Fig.2, upper panel). In contrast, no detectable mobility changes were observed with GST-ROC1 (Fig. 2, bottom panel). Collectively, these results demonstrate that the HeLa extracts catalyze the conjugation of NEDD8 to the CUL1324–776 subunit of the GST-ROC1-CUL1324–776 complex an"
https://openalex.org/W1988827270,"Abstract We show here that the combination of interferon-β (IFN-β) and all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) induces the death of tumor cells. To understand the molecular basis for synergistic growth-suppressive action and to identify the gene products that participate in this process, we have employed an antisense knock-out technique. This approach permits the isolation of cell death-associated genes based on their selective inactivation by overexpression of antisense cDNAs. Because the antisense mRNA inactivates gene expression of death-specific genes, transfected cells survive in the presence death inducers. Several Genes associated with Retinoid-IFN-inducedMortality (GRIM) were identified using this approach. Here we report the isolation of a novel GRIM gene, GRIM-19. This 552-base pair cDNA encodes a 16-kDa protein. Antisense expression of GRIM-19 confers a strong resistance against IFN/RA-induced death by reducing the intracellular levels of GRIM-19 protein. Overexpression of GRIM-19 enhances cell death in response to IFN/RA. GRIM-19 is primarily a nuclear protein whose expression is induced by the IFN/RA combination. Together, our studies identify a novel cell death-regulatory molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2029589204,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, copper ions regulate gene expression through the two transcriptional activators, Ace1 and Mac1. Ace1 mediates copper-induced gene expression in cells exposed to stressful levels of copper salts, whereas Mac1 activates a subset of genes under copper-deficient conditions. DNA microarray hybridization experiments revealed a limited set of yeast genes differentially expressed under growth conditions of excess copper or copper deficiency. Mac1 activates the expression of six S. cerevisiae genes, including CTR1,CTR3, FRE1, FRE7, YFR055w, and YJL217w. Two of the last three newly identified Mac1 target genes have no known function; the third, YFR055w, is homologous to cystathionine γ-lyase encoded by CYS3. Several genes that are differentially expressed in cells containing a constitutively active Mac1, designated Mac1up1, are not direct targets of Mac1.

The ability of cells to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources is dependent on having an active cytochrome oxidase complex, which requires copper ions as cofactors. Oxidative growth requires defense molecules against reactive oxygen intermediates. Superoxide dismutase is a copper-metalloenzyme that functions to disproportionate superoxide anions. A third, key copper-metalloenzyme is Fet3, which is a ferro-oxidase critical for uptake of Fe(II) (1Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). A myriad of other oxidases and oxygenases require Cu(II) as a functional cofactor in other species, so additional copper-metalloenzymes may exist in S. cerevisiae. S. cerevisiae possesses mechanisms to maintain cellular copper levels at adequate but not excessive cellular copper levels. Copper ion homeostasis in yeast is maintained, in part, through copper-regulated expression of genes involved in copper ion uptake and Cu(I) sequestration. Positive and negative copper ion regulation of gene expression is observed, and both effects occur at the level of transcription (2Winge D.R. Jensen L.T. Srinivasan C. Curr. Opin. Chem.

A different subset of genes is transcriptionally activated when the extracellular copper concentration exceeds 1 μm. This is a protective response to counteract the cytotoxicity of copper ions.

In addition to its role in dismuting superoxide anions, Sod1 has a secondary role of contributing to copper buffering in S. cerevisiae (25Culotta V.C. Joh H.D. Lin S.J. Slekar K.H. Strain J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29991-29997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Cu(I) activation of CUP1 expression is mediated by Ace1 inS. cerevisiae (26Buchman C. Skroch P.

Cu(I) ion binding within the copper-regulatory domain of Ace1 stabilizes a specific tertiary fold capable of high affinity interaction with specific DNA promoter sequences. Cu(I) triggering involves formation of a tetracopper thiolate cluster within the regulatory domain (28Winge D.R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 58: 165-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). CUP1,CRS5, and SOD1 contain CuAce1 binding sites within 5′ promoter sequences (20Furst P. Hu S. Hackett R. Hamer D.

To identify other yeast genes that may likewise be important in copper homeostasis, we used DNA microarray technology to evaluate differential expression of genes in cells varying in copper ion status. DNA microarrays containing approximately 6120 genes from S. cerevisiae printed on glass slides were used to identify genes up- or down-regulated by activated Mac1 and Ace1. The yeast strains used, CM66J (MATα, ino1-13, gcn4-101, his3-609, ura3-52, FRE1-HIS3::LEU2) and CM66J-up (MATα , trp1-63, gcn4-101, his3-609, ura3-52, FRE1-HIS3::LEU2, MAC1 up1), were derived from strains 66 (MATα, trp1-63, gcn4-101, his3-609, ura3-52, FRE1-HIS3::LEU2) and CM3262 (MATa, ino1-13, gcn4-101, his3-609, ura3-52, leu2-3, 112, ino1-13), gifts from A.

In both cases, allele status was verified by diagnostic polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Theace1Δ strain was constructed by the one-step gene replacement method mentioned integrating kanMX in theACE1 locus in strain CM66G. The pho4 strain used was W303 containing a pho4::TRP1 locus transformed with pRSMAC1 and pRSMAC1up1. The vector pRSMAC1 was the YCp-based pRS316 (32Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar) containing a 1.7-kilobaseSau3A genomic fragment of MAC1 orMAC1 up1. Yeast strains were cultured in either CM with YNB (Difco) or low copper complete medium (LCCM)1 using copper and iron limiting yeast nitrogen base (Bio101) and lacking the appropriate amino acids to ensure maintenance of plasmid and reporters. Cells were harvested from 300 ml of culture at an A 600 nm of 0.4 or following 60 min of treatment with 100 μm BCS or 30 min of treatment with 100 μm CuSO4. Total RNA was isolated by the hot acid phenol method. Quantitation of RNA was carried out by UV spectroscopy. mRNA was isolated from total RNA using the Poly(A)T tract mRNA Isolation System IV kit from Promega following the manufacturer's instructions. Three types of microarray experiments were conducted. First, wild-type and MAC1 up1 cells were cultured in LCCM. Second, wild-type cells pregrown in LCCM medium to anA 600 nm of 0.4 were incubated in the presence and absence of 100 μm BCS for 30 or 60 min prior to harvesting. Third, wild-type cells pregrown in CM medium to anA 600 nm of 0.4 were incubated in the presence and absence of 100 μm CuSO4 for 30 min. Cy3-dUTP or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was incorporated during reverse transcription of the polyadenylated RNA. The fluorescently labeled product was recovered and hybridized to microarrays, washed, and scanned as described previously (33DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O.

Dancis, contains a 30-bp cassette of theFET3 UAS (−263 to −234) fused to lacZ (36Yamaguchi-iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Plasmid pFC-LM2 is a mutant version of pFC-W containing a mutation in the Aft1 binding site (36Yamaguchi-iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Total RNA isolated from mid-logarithmic cells was hybridized with a32P-labeled, single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide and digested with S1 nuclease. The samples were electrophoresed through a 8% polyacrylamide, 5 m urea gel, and data were quantified by using a Bio-Rad FX Imager and Quantity one software (Bio-Rad Inc.). S1 probes used included 57–75 nucleotides of the 5′ open reading frame sequences of candidate genes, 40 nucleotides of the calmodulin (CDM1) 5′ open reading frame, and 60 nucleotides from thelacZ open reading frame. Cells were harvested, washed twice, and digested for 60 min with 200 μl nitric/perchloric acid mixture (5:2) at 110 °C. Following digestion, the sample volume was adjusted to 1 ml and clarified, prior to analysis, using a Perkin-Elmer Optima 3100 XL ICP. For each element two absorption lines were used, and readings from four independent measurements were taken, averaged, and normalized to cell number. Our strategy to catalog genes activated by Mac1 and Ace1 was to use duplicated DNA microarray experiments as a screen to identify genes consistently up-regulated under activating conditions. In each case, candidate genes were evaluated by secondary tests to verify the differential expression and to determine whether the induction was a direct or indirect effect of Mac1 or Ace1 activation. The strategy used to screen for Mac1-induced genes was 4-fold. First, DNA microarray experiments were conducted with a yeast strain containing a gain-of-function MAC1 up1 allele compared with its isogenic control. MAC1 up1cells are constitutively active in expressing CTR1,CTR3, FRE1, and FRE7 (5Labbe S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol.

Kwon L.F. Kosman D.J. Thiele D.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1917-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). This DNA microarray experiment was carried out in triplicate. The second strategy was to identify genes induced in copper-deficient cells as Mac1 is activated under these conditions. Efficient Mac1 activation is dependent on culturing cells in low copper medium and adding the Cu(I)-specific chelator BCS to further lower the available copper ion pools (5Labbe S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Thus, DNA microarray experiments were carried out on cells treated with BCS for short periods of time to focus on primary effects of copper deficiency. Third, genes differentially expressed both in MAC1 up1 cells and by the addition of BCS were tested for differential mRNA expression by the S1 nuclease protection assay to quantify mRNA levels. Fourth, these genes were evaluated for Mac1 DNA-binding sites in 5′ promoter sequences. The consensus Mac1 binding site is TTTGC(T/G)C(A/G) (17Martins L. Jensen L.T. Simon J.R. Keller G. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 23716-23721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Genes with elevated expression inMAC1 up1 cells and induced by the addition of BCS as determined by both DNA microarray and S1 nuclease analyses and containing at least one Mac1 DNA-binding site were considered candidates for primary Mac1 induced genes. Genes up-regulated inMAC1 up1 cells but not induced by short BCS treatment and lacking a candidate Mac1 binding site were considered candidates for secondary responses. Three DNA microarray experiments were conducted comparing wild-type andMAC1 up1 cells. Duplicate experiments were conducted on mRNA isolated from exponentially growing wild-type andMAC1 up1 cells of S. cerevisiae strain CM66J. Fluorescently labeled cDNA was prepared from mRNA isolated from wild-type cells by reverse transcriptase in the presence of Cy3 (green)-labeled dUTP and from MAC1 up1cells by reverse transcription in the presence of Cy5 (red)-labeled dUTP. The labeled cDNAs were mixed and hybridized to the microarrays. The fluorescence intensities of the Cy3 and Cy5 fluorophores were quantified to provide a quantitative measure of the relative abundance of mRNA levels in the two cell populations. A third microarray experiment was conducted with wild-type andMAC1 up1 cells of strain BR10 grown to late log phase. Table I shows fluorescence ratios of genes differentially expressed in these three experiments. The known Mac1 regulated genes (CTR1, FRE1, andFRE7) were clearly up-regulated in each experiment. Ratios of mRNA levels of CTR1, FRE1, andFRE7 in MAC1 up1 versuswild-type cells exhibited mean values of 4, 7, and 6, respectively. Because strain CM66J contained a FRE1/HIS3 fusion gene, differential expression of HIS3 from the FRE1promoter was also observed. CTR3 was induced 8-fold inMAC1 up1 cells of strain BR10 but was not expressed in strain CM66J. In addition to known Mac1-regulated genes, >50 genes exhibited a moderate (>1.5-fold) induction inMAC1 up1 cells in any given experiment. However, only five new genes were moderately induced in all three experiments. These genes included CUP1, PHO5, and YJL217w.CUP1 expression is likely elevated inMAC1 up1 cells as expression of the high affinity copper transport system is constitutive, resulting in elevated uptake of copper ions (4Hassett R. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 128-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Metal analysis revealed that cellular copper levels were elevated 6-fold in MAC1 up1 cells compared with wild-type cells.Table IGenes up-regulated >1.5 fold in MAC1 up1 arraysMAC1 up1 Experiment 1 (exponential cells)MAC1 up1 Experiment 2 (exponential cells)MAC1 up1 Experiment 3 (stationary)BCS treatment (exponential cells)30 min60 minKnown Mac1-activated genes CTR12.95.54.11.74.1 CTR37.9 FRE16.87.57.62.93.8 FRE74.84.110.01.21.8Genes up-regulated in MAC1 up1 cells CUP12.12.71.70.70.9 HXT174.62.21.41.1 PHO56.93.81.41.41.3 PHO125.13.21.01.20.8 YFR055w3.53.91.11.72.7 YJL217w1.44.53.51.02.6Marginal candidates YBR105c2.51.60.51.62.0 YHR088w1.61.71.31.01.6 YKL005c1.62.20.81.31.8 YKL082c1.61-aFlagged spot.1.01.12.0 YLL062c1.61.92.11-aFlagged spot.1.5Three experiments were conducted comparing expression levels of wild-type cells versus cells containing aMAC1 up1 allele.

In the experiments in which Mac1 was activated by copper-deficient conditions, exponentially growing wild-type cells were incubated in the presence and absence of 100 μm BCS for either 30 or 60 min prior to cell harvest. To determine whether these genes were directly Mac1-induced, we carried out microarray experiments in which wild-type cells cultured in low copper medium were treated with the Cu(I)-specific chelator for either 30 or 60 min. These conditions are known to induce CTR1expression (3Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hassett R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). mRNA was isolated from cells cultured in the presence and absence of BCS, and labeled cDNA was prepared as before for DNA microarray hybridization. As expected, CTR1,FRE1, and FRE7 were up-regulated by short treatments with BCS (Table I). In contrast, neither CUP1 norPHO5 were BCS-induced. Thirty genes showed moderately elevated expression inMAC1 up1 exponentially growing cells. Only 17 of these were also induced by BCS (60-min treatment) (Table I). Two of these genes, YFR055w and YJL217w, showed marked enhancements in expression in MAC1 up1 cells and BCS-treated cells (Fig. 1 A). S1 analysis was performed as an independent verification of differential expression using the same RNA samples used to prepare mRNA for the array experiments. Transcripts of YFR055w and YJL217w were markedly elevated in MAC1 up1 cells and by BCS treatment (60 min BCS) (Fig. 1 A). YFR055w expression was elevated 8-fold inMAC1 up1 cells and 3-fold by 60 min BCS treatment. YJL217w expression was enhanced 6-fold inMAC1 up1 cells (same RNA as in experiment 2) and 2-fold by the 60 min BCS treatment. Maximal expression ofFRE1, FRE7, CTR1, YFR055w, and YJL217w occurred by 60 min of treatment with BCS (data not shown). Neither YFR055w nor YJL217w were induced by BCS in mac1-1 cells, suggesting that copper metalloregulation of these genes is mediated by Mac1 (Fig. 1 B). The four known Mac1-regulated genes contain at least two binding sites for Mac1 activation. However, YFR055w and YJL217w each have one perfect Mac1 consensus DNA-binding site, although additional nonconsensus sites exist that may be functional. Thus, YFR055w and YJL217w satisfy the criteria of being direct target genes of Mac1. A gene divergently expressed from FRE1, YLR213c, was up-regulated in MAC1 up1 cells and induced by BCS in strain BR10. S1 analysis of wild-type BR10 cells treated with 100 μm BCS for 60 min resulted in a 15-fold induction inFRE1 and a weaker 4-fold induction of YLR213c. In contrast, expression of YLR213c in strain CM66J was very low under all conditions. A number of genes in the PHO regulon (PHO5,PHO11, PHO12, and PHO84) were up-regulated in MAC1 up1 cells but not induced by BCS treatment. PHO5 expression was enhanced 7- and 4-fold inMAC1 up1 cells in two array experiments but unaffected by BCS treatment. Evaluation of PHO5 mRNA levels by S1 analysis confirmed the induction inMAC1 up1 cells (13-fold enhancement) and failed to show any induction by BCS treatment. The lack of induction by BCS suggested that PHO5 induction may be a secondary effect of phosphate depletion in MAC1 up1 cells.PHO5 expression is regulated by the Pho4 transcription factor through, in part, cellular phosphate levels.MAC1 up1 cells containing a pho4mutation failed to show a Mac1up1-dependent enhanced expression of PHO5, consistent with the postulate that elevation of the PHO regulon arises from selective depletion of the cellular phosphate pool in MAC1 up1 cells (data not shown). Additional studies were carried out on the remaining marginal candidates listed in Table I. A yeast DNA microarray experiment was repeated at the University of Utah microarray facility comparing wild-type cells to MAC1 up1 cells. None of the marginal candidates were up-regulated in this experiment. Secondly, most of these genes lacked a consensus Mac1 binding site in 5′ DNA sequences. Those containing a candidate Mac1 binding site were tested by S1 analysis. Quantitation of transcripts of YBR105c, YHR088w, and YKL082c revealed no enhancement in MAC1 up1 cells and no induction by BCS. DNA microarrays were also used to screen for genes with diminished expression in MAC1 up1 cells. Two genes,ZRT1 and ZRT2, encoding zinc plasma membrane transporters, were markedly repressed in MAC1 up1cells. S1 analysis confirmed that ZRT1 is markedly inhibited (25-fold) in MAC1 up1 cells, and ZRT"

Although vanadate-containing compounds exert potent toxic effects on a wide variety of biological systems, the mechanisms controlling vanadate-induced adverse effects remain to be elucidated. The present study investigated the vanadate-induced p53 activation and involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in p53 activation as well as the role of p53 in apoptosis induction by vanadate. Exposure of mouse epidermal JB6 cells to vanadate led to transactivation of p53 activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner. It also caused mitochondrial damage, apoptosis, and generated ROS. Scavenging of vanadate-induced H2O2 byN-acetyl-l-cysteine (a general antioxidant) or catalase (a specific H2O2 inhibitor), or the chelation of vanadate by deferoxamine, resulted in inhibition of p53 activation and cell mitochondrial damage. In contract, an increase in H2O2 generation in response to superoxide dismutase or NADPH enhanced these effects caused by vanadate. Furthermore, vanadate-induced apoptosis occurred in cells expressing wild-type p53 (p53+/+) but was very weak in p53-deficient (p53−/−) cells. These results demonstrate that vanadate induces p53 activation mainly through H2O2 generation, and this activation is required for vanadate-induced apoptosis."

Since there are several reports indicating that some viruses influence the tumor suppressor p53 function, we determined the effects of HCV proteins on p53 function and its mechanism determined by use of a reporter assay. Among seven HCV proteins investigated (core, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B), only core protein augmented the transcriptional activity of p53 and increased the expression of p21 waf1 protein, which is a major target of p53. Core protein increased both DNA-binding affinity of p53 in electrophoretic morbidity shift assay and transcriptional ability of p53 itself in a reporter assay. The direct interaction between core protein and C terminus of p53 was also shown by glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein binding assay. In addition, core protein interacted with hTAFII28, a component of the transcriptional factor complex in vivo and in vitro.

More than 170 million persons are reported to be chronically infected worldwide (5World Health Organization 1998 press releases (1998), http://www.who.int/inf-pr-1998/en/pr98-36.html.Google Scholar). HCV, distantly related to the flaviviruses and the pestiviruses of the flavivirus family (6Choo Q.-L. Kuo G. Weiner A.J. Overby L.R. Bradley D.W. Houghton M.

The putative organization of the HCV genome includes in order from the 5′ end the 5′-untranslated region, 3–4 structural proteins (core, E1, E2/p7), 6 nonstructural (NS) proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B), and the 3′-untranslated region (9Choo Q.-L.

However, the effect of these proteins on the function of HCV-infected cells is still not fully understood. The tumor suppressor p53 protein monitors various cellular stresses such as DNA damage, while activated p53 functions via its ability to transactivate gene expression and mediates its downstream events mainly by two major pathways: cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (12Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6673) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that p53 protein functionally interacts with several viral proteins variously. That is, some of these proteins were reported to suppress p53 function (13–25), but other viral proteins were reported to enhance p53 function (26Murono S. Yoshizaki T. Park C.S. Furusawa M.

Then, in this study, we investigated whether HCV proteins (core, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) influence p53 function, with special attention paid to its transcriptional regulation of p21 (37el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

Human hepatoblastoma cells (HepG2), p53-negative human osteosarcoma cells (SAOS-2), monkey kidney cells (COS-7), human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa), and murine embryonic fibroblasts (NIH3T3) were obtained from Riken cell bank (Tsukuba, Japan). HepG2, COS-7, HeLa, and NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaitherburg, MD) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. SAOS-2 cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum. Hep3B cells, p53-negative human hepatoma cells obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD), were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 1% nonessential amino acids. HCV RNA was extracted from the serum of a 50-year-old male patient with chronic hepatitis C type 1b using SepaGene-RV (Sankyo Junyaku, Tokyo, Japan). HCV genotyping was performed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with type-specific primers (39Okamoto H. Sugiyama Y. Okada S. Kurai K. Akahane Y. Sugai Y. Tanaka T. Sato K. Tsuda F. Miyakawa Y. Mayumi M. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). HCV core, NS2, NS3, NS4B, and NS5B regions were amplified by RT-PCR with HCV region-specific primers using the extracted HCV RNA as a template. RT-PCR was performed as described previously (40Kato N. Yokosuka O. Omata M. Hosoda K. Ohto M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1764-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 41Kato N. Yokosuka O. Hosoda K. Ito Y. Ohto M. Omata M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 800-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Type 1b HCV NS4A region was amplified by PCR with NS4A-specific primers using pCMV/N1658–1711 (encoding NS4) (42Tanji Y. Hijikata M. Satoh S. Kaneko T. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1575-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (kindly provided by K. Shimotohno, Kyoto University) as a template. Type 1b HCV NS5A region was amplified by PCR with NS5A-specific primers using pM-NS5A/F5-R5 (encoding NS5A) (43Kato N. Lan K-H. Ono-Nita S.K. Shiratori Y. Omata M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8856-8859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a template. All synthetic primers had aXhoI restriction site for subcloning PCR products, except primers for the NS3 region that had a SalI restriction site. Amplified products were digested with XhoI orSalI and then cloned into the XhoI site of pCXN2 (kindly provided by J. Miyazaki, Osaka University, Japan), a mammalian expression vector having a β-actin-based CAG promoter (44Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene ( Amst .). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4524) Google Scholar), to generate pCXN2-core, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B. pCXN2-core173, which expresses the C-terminal 18 amino acids (aa) truncated core protein, was also prepared from pCXN2-core using PCR amplification of core gene fragments. N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA: YPYDVPDYA)-tagged core protein expression plasmids (pCXN2-HA core and pCXN2-HA-core 173) were constructed by subcloning the XhoI fragment of pCXN2-core and core 173 into the XhoI sites of pCXN2-HA. pCXN2-HA-core 63–191 and pCXN2-HA-core 63–173, which encode the 62-aa N-terminal deleted core protein (aa 63–191 and 63–173, respectively), were also obtained by inserting the PCR products. The pCXN2-p53, a human wild type p53 expression vector was constructed by subcloning the p53 cDNA fragment with a XhoI site into pCXN2, which was amplified by PCR using AdCAp53, a human wild type p53 expression adenovirus described previously (45Ohashi M. Kanai F. Ueno H. Tanaka T. Tateishi K. Kawakami T. Koike Y. Ikenoue T. Shiratori Y. Hamada H. Omata M. Gut. 1999; 44: 366-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), as a template. To generate pCXN2-Gal4BD-p53, p53 cDNA was subcloned intoEcoRI and PstI sites of the pM vector (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA), a mammalian expression vector for generating Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused protein. The Gal4BD-p53 cDNA fragment with a XhoI site was then amplified by PCR and subcloned into pCXN2. To generate pCXN2-Gal4BD-VP16, a Gal4BD fused activation domain of herpesvirus VP16 protein expression vector, Gal4BD-VP16 cDNA fragment with aXhoI site amplified using pM3-VP16 (CLONTECH) was subcloned into pCXN2. For immunoprecipitation of core protein and TFIID, human TATA-binding protein (hTBP) and five TBP-associated factors (hTAFs) expression plasmids were constructed; hTBP cDNA was kindly provided by M. Horikoshi, University of Tokyo, Japan), and N-terminal HA-tagged hTBP (pCXN2-HA-hTBP) was generated by subcloning hTBP cDNA into pCXN2-HA. A mammalian hTAFII32/31 expression vector (phTAFII32/31) having a cytomegalovirus promoter was kindly provided by R. Tjian, University of California, CA). pCXN2-hTAFII32/31 was generated by subcloning hTAFII32/31 cDNA into pCXN2. hTAFII70 cDNA, also kindly provided by R. Tjian was subcloned into pCXN2-HA vector for the generation of N-terminal HA-tagged hTAFII70. hTAFII28, hTAFII20, and hTAFII18 cDNAs, kindly provided by I. Davidson (Collège de France, France), were also subcloned into pCXN2-HA vector for the generation of N-terminal HA-tagged hTAFII28, hTAFII20, and hTAFII18. All cloned plasmids were purified using the Endofree plasmid kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Nucleotide sequencing of constructed plasmids was performed using an autosequencer (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and the dye termination method as described previously (46Togo G. Toda N. Kanai F. Kato N. Shiratori Y. Kishi K. Imazeki F. Makuuchi M. Omata M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5620-5623PubMed Google Scholar) to confirm gene integration. Expression of the cloned genes was confirmed by immunoblotting the cell extracts of COS-7 cells transfected with each plasmid using the corresponding antibody. For in vitro transcription and translation, the HCV core RNA was synthesized from PCR product with an extension at its 5′-end consisting of a T7 promoter using pCXN2-core as a template. In vitrotranscription and translation was carried out using Protein Truncation Test Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The translated core protein was biotinylated and confirmed by immunoblotting with ECL streptavidin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The following vectors containing the Photinus pyralis (firefly) luciferase repoter gene driven by a basic promoter element (TATA box), plus an inducible cis-enhancer element were utilized as reporter plasmids: WWP-luc, containing a 2.4-kilobase pair genomic fragment of the human p21 promoter (37el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7869) Google Scholar), and PG13-luc, containing 13 copies of the p53 binding sequences (47Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1992; 256: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar), both kindly provided by B. Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD); MDM2-luc, containing human MDM-2 promoter kindly provided by C. Prives (Columbia University, New York) (48Friedlander P. Haupt Y. Prives C. Oren M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 19: 4961-4971Crossref Scopus (268) Google Scholar), and pFR-luc, containing five Gal4 DNA binding sequences linked with the luciferase gene (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which was used as a reporter for transcription mediated by Gal4BD fusion proteins. To check transfection efficiency, pRL-TK, a control plasmid to express Renilla reniformis (seapansy) luciferase driven by herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (Toyo Ink, Tokyo, Japan), was used. Approximately 4 × 105 cells were plated onto a 6-well tissue culture plate (Iwaki Glass, Chiba, Japan) 24 h before transfection. Transfection was performed using FuGene6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Unless otherwise specified, the transfection complexes containing a total of 0.6 μg of plasmids (0.39 μg of firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, 0.01 μg of pRL-TK, and 0.2 μg of pCXN2 or various types of expression plasmids) were added to each well of the 6-well plate. Using SAOS-2 cells and Hep3B cells, 0.01 μg of PCXN2-p53 was added to the transfection complexes when necessary. Cells were harvested 36 h after transfection and luciferase assays were carried out with the PicaGene Dual Seapansy System (Toyo Ink). Firefly luciferase activity and seapansy luciferase activity were measured as relative light unit with a luminometer (Lumat LB9507, EG&G Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency based on seapansy luciferase activity. All assays were performed at least in triplicate. To determine the expression levels of p53 and p21, immunoblotting was performed. Cell extracts were adjusted to the same protein concentration by Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Hybond-P; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Rabbit anti-p53 and goat anti-p21 IgG polyclonal antibodies were used for the first antibody, both of which were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). As for the second antibody, anti-rabbit antibody and anti-goat antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and Santa Cruz, respectively. The bound antigen was detected by ECL-plus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To determine the expression levels of core protein, mouse anti-core monoclonal antibody (Austral Biologicals, San Ramon, CA) and anti-mouse antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used. Approximately 2.5 × 106 SAOS-2 cells were plated onto a 10-cm dish (Iwaki Glass). Twenty-four hours later, a total of 3 μg of plasmids (1.5 μg of pCXN2-p53 and 1.5 μg of pCXN2 or pCXN2-core) were transfected into SAOS-2 cells using FuGene6. The cells were harvested 36 h after transfection, and nuclear extracts were prepared according to mini-nuclear extraction methods (49Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). The concentration of the nuclear extracts was determined and adjusted to give equal concentrations. In addition, p53 was immunoblotted to confirm that there was the same amount of expression in pCXN2-p53 transfected cells. DNA binding assay was performed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using p53 NuShift kit (GENEKA, Montréal, Canada) according to the manufacturer's protocol with a minor modification. Briefly, a synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide containing two p53 consensus binding sites (5′-GGACATGCCCGGGCATGTC-3′) was end-labeled with [32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and then incubated with either 3 μg of nuclear extracts or recombinant proteins and binding buffer (4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.05 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)) for 40 min at 4 °C. In order to visualize p53-DNA complexes, 200 ng of p53 monoclonal antibody pAb 421 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) was required (50Woo R.A. McLure K.G. Lees-Miller S.P. Rancourt D.E. Lee P.W.K. Nature. 1998; 394: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 51McLure K.G. Lee P.W.K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3342-3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and added to all mixtures. The specificity of p53 in this assay was tested by adding 100-fold excess of either wild type or mutant competitors (5′-GGATCGCCCCGGGCATGTC-3′), as well as the supershift caused by addition of 300 ng of the anti-p53 antibody (pAb 1801, Calbiochem). Reaction mixtures were loaded onto a 4% polyacrylamide gel using buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 200 mm glycine, pH 8.5, and 1 mm EDTA and then separated by electrophoresis in the same buffer. pGEX4T1-p53, p53N, and p53C, which express three types of p53 protein fused to glutathioneS-transferase (GST) in Escherichia coli, were constructed by subcloning PCR amplified XhoI fragments containing cDNA sequences for the 1–393, 1–71, or 72–393 aa of p53, respectively, into the XhoI site of pGEX4T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). These constructs were expressed inE. coli BL21 (DE3) (Stratagene) and purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads as specified by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 0.6 μg of pCXN2-core was transfected into approximately 4 × 105 COS-7 cells, and the cell lysates were prepared in 200 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% gelatin, 0.02% sodium azide, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. Approximately 10 μg of each fusion protein was bound to glutathione-Sepharose and incubated with 150 μl of the cell lysates or 2 μl of in vitro translated core protein, respectively, at 4 °C overnight. Beads were washed four times with the same buffer and the bound proteins were blotted by either anti-HCV core monoclonal antibody or streptavidin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The expression of GST-hTAFII28 in E. coli was conducted using the same procedures as for GST-p53. pGEX4T1-hTAFII28 was constructed by subcloning hTAFII28 cDNA into pGEX4T1 using PCR amplification and expressed in BL21. Approximately 10 μg of the fusion protein was bound to glutathione-Sepharose and incubated with 3 μl of thein vitro translational mixture containing biotinylated core protein. After washing, the precipitated products were determined by streptavidin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. 4 × 105 COS-7 or SAOS-2 cells were transfected with 0.4 μg of pCXN2-core or pCXN2-HA-core together with 0.4 μg of HA-tagged hTAFIIvectors (pCXN2-HA-hTAFII 18, 20, 28, 70, TBP) or pCXN2-TAFII31/32. Cell extracts were prepared with 200 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer and precipitated by incubation with 0.2 μg of anti-HA polyclonal antibody or anti-core antibody followed by addition of 20 μl of Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After being washed 4 times with immunoprecipitation buffer, the precipitated proteins were revealed by immunoblotting using anti-core antibody or anti-hTAFII31/32 antibody (Santa Cruz). For reference, 10 μl (1/20) of the lysate was used as “input.” The results from assays of luciferase activity were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc Scheffe testing (StatView J, Abacus Concepts Inc., Barkeley, CA). The data represent the mean ± S.D. calculated from three independent experiments. Differences with a value of p < 0.05 were considered significant. To determine the effect of HCV proteins on p53 function, WWP-luc containing the promoter of p21, a well known p53 target gene (37el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7869) Google Scholar), was co-transfected with a fixed level of p53 expression plasmid and each of seven HCV protein expression plasmids into p53-null SAOS-2 cells. Thirty-six hours later, the cells were assayed for luciferase activity. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the relative firefly luciferase activity of WWP-luc/pCXN2-core transfected cell lysates was 5.4 ± 0.7 (mean ± S.D.) times higher than that of WWP-luc/pCXN2-transfected cell lysates. The other HCV proteins, however, did not influence p21 promoter activity. To analyze the effect of HCV core protein on endogenous p53-mediated transcriptional activation in hepatocytes, similar experiments without transfection of the p53 expression plasmid were conducted in HepG2 cells having wild type p53. Relative firefly luciferase activity of WWP-luc/pCXN2-core transfected cell lysates was 3.2 ± 0.5 (mean ± S.D.) times higher than that of WWP-luc/pCXN2 transfected cell lysates (Fig. 1 B). Thus, only core protein among HCV proteins significantly enhanced p21 promoter activity under the presence of either endogenous or exogenous p53 protein. To examine whether core protein also demonstrated the same effect in other cell lines, two cell lines with supposedly intact p53 (HeLa and NIH3T3) and one p53-deficient cell line (Hep3B) (52Bressac B. Galvin K.M. Liang T.J. Isselbacher K.J. Wands J.R. Ozturk M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1973-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) were used. In Hep3B, the experiment was performed by adding pCXN2-p53, while other cell lines were examined in the absence of exogenous p53 protein. The enhancement of the p21 promoter activity by core protein was observed in Hep3B but weakly in NIH3T3 and HeLa cells (Fig. 1 C). To determine whether the enhancement of p21 promoter activity by core protein occurred in a dose-dependent manner, WWP-luc was co-transfected with various amounts of pCXN2-core and a fixed level of pCXN2 or pCXN2-p53 into SAOS-2 cells. Core protein enhanced luciferase activity from the p21 promoter in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of exogenous p53 (Fig. 2 A). However, the enhancement was not observed in the absence of exogenous p53. To analyze the effect of core protein on endogenous p53-mediated transcriptional activation, similar experiments without pCXN2-p53 transfection were performed using HepG2 cells. Core protein also enhanced the endogenous p53-mediated transcriptional activation of the p21 promoter in a dose-dependent manner in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2 B). To elucidate the region of core protein responsible for the enhancement of p21 promoter activity, we constructed the following N-terminal deleted and C-terminal truncated mutants as HA-tagged fusion proteins expression plasmids: pCXN2-HA 1–191 aa (full-length), HA 1–173 aa (C-terminal truncated), HA 63–191 aa (N-terminal deleted), and HA 63–173 aa (both N- and C-terminal deleted). These deleted core protein expression plasmids were used for the luciferase assay with WWP-luc as a reporter plasmid. The results showed that N-terminal deleted core protein had no effect on p21 promoter activity, although the full-length or C-terminal truncated core protein enhanced p21 promoter activity in SAOS-2 cells (Fig. 2 C). As p21 promoter activity was enhanced by core protein in the luciferase assay system, cellular p21 protein expression was examined. Endogenous levels of p21 protein were determined by Western blot analysis using SAOS-2 cell lysates. As shown in Fig.3 A, the levels of endogenous p21 expression increased in relation to the amount of core protein. To examine whether this increase in p21 expression was due to a change in the amount of p53, the expression of p53 was measured by immunoblotting. Although the dose of pCXN2-core increased, the amount of p53 protein from a fixed level of pCXN2-p53 was equivalent under this condition (Fig. 3). These results indicate that the increase of the p21 protein was not due to an increase in p53 protein level.Figure 2Dose dependence of the effects by core protein on the p21 promoter activity. A, SAOS-2 cells were transfected with 0.39 μg of WWP-luc, 0.01 μg of pRL-TK, and indicated amounts of pCXN2-core with or without 0.01 μg of pCXN2-p53.

FlavoHbs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Alcaligenes eutrophus, and Escherichia colishare similar spectra, O2, NO, and CO binding kinetics, and steady-state NO dioxygenation kinetics. Turnover numbers (V max) for S. cerevisiae, A. eutrophus, and E. coli flavoHbs are 112, 290, and 365 NO heme−1 s−1, respectively, at 37 °C with 200 μm O2. The K M values for NO are low and range from 0.1 to 0.25 μm.V max/K M(NO) ratios of 900–2900 μm−1 s−1 indicate an extremely efficient dioxygenation mechanism.

High and roughly equal second order rate constants for O2 and NO association with the reduced flavoHbs (17–50 μm−1 s−1) and small NO dissociation rate constants suggest that NO inhibits the dioxygenase reaction by forming inactive flavoHbNO complexes. Carbon monoxide also binds reduced flavoHbs with high affinity and competitively inhibits NO dioxygenases with respect to O2(K I(CO) = ∼1 μm). These results suggest that flavoHbs and related hemoglobins evolved as NO detoxifying components of nitrogen metabolism capable of discriminating O2 from inhibitory NO and CO.

Further, O2 is required for the robust NO scavenging action of flavoHb both in E. coliand in vitro, and O2 is required for the maximal protection of cells and NO-sensitive aconitases from NO-mediated damage (1Gardner P.R.

FlavoHbs may reduce NO or denitrosylate toxic nitrosothiols formed from NO, sequester NO or reactive heme, or catalyze other beneficial reactions (6Hausladen A. Gow A.J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl.

These additional flavoHb activities and functions require consideration. We have now investigated the NOD activities of flavoHbs isolated fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae, Alcaligenes eutrophus, and E. coli and have compared these activities with other enzymic activities of flavoHbs including NO reductase, NADH oxidase, and FAD reductase activities. Spectra for the various O2, NO, and CO liganded flavoHbs and the transient kinetics for O2, NO, and CO binding are reported for flavoHbs and are discussed in relation to the susceptibility of NOD activity to NO and CO inhibition. The kinetics and stoichiometry of the NOD activity indicate a highly specific and efficient dioxygenase mechanism and function for the flavoHbs. NADPH, FAD, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, andAspergillus niger glucose oxidase (225 units/mg) were purchased from Sigma. NADH, Aspergillus nitrate reductase, and bovine liver catalase (260,000 units/ml) were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (2,700 units/mg) was isolated from E. coli strain DH5α bearing the multi-copy plasmid pD11c (15Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol.

Hemin (99.9%) was obtained from Fluka. Ultra-pure O2 and CO were purchased from Praxair (Bethlehem, PA). NO was obtained from Aldrich. S. cerevisiae flavoHb was prepared from strain JM43. Cultures were grown on YPD-galactose medium and treated with antimycin A as described previously (17Zhu H. Riggs A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5015-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Cells from 6 liters of culture (∼72 g) were resuspended in 2 volumes of 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, containing 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and cells were lysed in a French press. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g, and cell-free extracts were applied to a 2.5 × 10-cm DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column (Sigma). After washing with 5 column volumes of 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, and 50 mm KCl, flavoHb was eluted with a linear gradient of 50–150 mm KCl. Fractions with a 405 nm:280 nm ratio larger than 0.06 were pooled and concentrated on a YM10 membrane (Amicon). FlavoHb was then separated by gel electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide containing 25 mm Tris/192 mmglycine, pH 8.8, at 4 °C. The yellowish flavoHb band was excised and eluted with Electro-Eluter Model 422 (Bio-Rad). A. eutrophusflavoHb was purified from cell pellets provided by Dr. Bärbel Friedrich (University of Berlin, Germany) (14Cramm R. Siddiqui R.A. Friedrich B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7349-7354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described above.E. coli flavoHb was purified from anaerobic nitrate-induced cultures of RB9060 containing the multi-copy plasmid pAlter +hmp (3Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Gardner P.R. Dou Y. Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12581-12589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). E. coli flavoHb was reconstituted with hemin as described (3Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Gardner P.R. Dou Y. Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12581-12589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). FlavoHb purities were judged to be greater than 95% by reverse phase HPLC and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. NOD activity was measured using a NO electrode (World Precision Inst.) at 37 °C in 2 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, containing 100 μm EDTA, 1 μm NO, 1 μm FAD, 200 μm O2, and 100 μm NADH unless specified otherwise (3Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Gardner P.R. Dou Y. Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12581-12589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Saturated NO (2 mm) was prepared as described previously (18Gardner P.R. Costantino G. Szabó C. Salzman A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25071-25076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Saturated CO (1 mm) was prepared by vigorously stirring water in a septum-sealed vial under a stream of 99.99% CO (Praxair) at room temperature (19Rohlfs R.J. Mathews A.J. Carver T.E. Olson J.S. Springer B.A. Egeberg K.D. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3168-3176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures were first scrubbed with 99.999% N2 when the effects of O2 concentration were measured. Saturated O2 solution (1.14 mm) was prepared by vigorously stirring reaction buffer in a rubber septum-sealed vial under 99.99% O2 (Praxair) at room temperature. The effect of FAD and CO on NOD activity was measured following repetitive additions of 2 nmol of NO and the stepwise removal of NO by 0.12–1.2 pmol of flavoHb in a 2-ml reaction at 37 °C. NOD activities were calculated with a correction for background rates of NO decomposition for each assay condition. NADH oxidase activity was followed at 340 nm in a 0.5-ml reaction mix containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 100 μm EDTA, 100 μmNADH, and 1 μm FAD at 37 °C. NO reductase activity was measured using the NO electrode in an anaerobic 2-ml reaction at 37 °C containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 μm FAD, 10 mm glucose, 8 units of glucose oxidase, 260 units of catalase, 100 μmNADH, and 5 μm NO. NO and flavoHb were added following 6 min of O2 depletion, and NO decomposition rates were determined for 1 μm NO. FAD reductase activity was assayed at 450 nm in a 1-ml reaction mixture prepared as described for the measurement of NO reductase activity except that NO was omitted and 20 μm FAD was included. Heme was determined using the alkaline pyridine method (20Appleby C.A. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). FAD was released from flavoHb by boiling for 3 min and was determined from the fluorescence at 520 nm with excitation at 460 nm (21Ioannidis N. Cooper C.E. Poole R.K. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Alternatively, heme and FAD were adsorbed on the reverse-phase C18 HPLC column (SynChrom) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O and were separated with a gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Heme and FAD were eluted with 35–40% and 10–15% acetonitrile, respectively. FAD and heme standards were employed for the analysis. E = 6,220m−1 cm−1 at 340 nm was used for the calculation of NAD(P)H concentration. The percentage of reduction of NAD(P)H preparations was determined from the absorbance ratio for 340 nm and 260 nm using 14,250 m−1cm−1 at 260 nm (22Ross J.B.A. Subramanian S. Brand L. Everse J. Anderson B. Kwan-sa Y. The Pyridine Nucleotide Coenzymes. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1982: 19-49Crossref Google Scholar). NADH and NADPH were ≥95% reduced. Protein was measured using the dye binding assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). All measurements were made at 20 °C in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 0.3 mm EDTA for comparison with previous Mb and Hb studies. Recombinant sperm whale Mb was included as a control. FlavoHb and Mb ligand complexes were prepared, and stopped flow and laser photolysis measurements of ligand binding were made as described previously (3Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Gardner P.R. Dou Y.

O2 consumption was measured with a Clark-type O2 electrode using a value of 200 μm O2 for air-saturated buffer at normal atmospheric pressure and 37 °C (25Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1964; 90: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). NADH oxidation was monitored at 340 nm. Visible light absorbance by FAD and heme confers an orangish brown color on flavoHbs that is altered by reduction and ligand binding. The heme spectra and absorbance maxima are grossly similar for the ligand complexes and redox forms of various flavoHbs (3Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Gardner P.R. Dou Y. Olson J.S. J. Biol.

We measured absorbance spectra of purified S. cerevisiae, A. eutrophus, andE. coli flavoHbs under identical conditions to evaluate the degree of spectral identity. With O2 binding, the NADH-reduced flavoHbs display heme spectra that are typical of oxyHbs (Fig. 1). The flavoHbO2complexes show similar wavelength maxima for the Soret and α,β bands (Table I). Notable differences are observed in the spectra attributable to the oxidized flavin (470 nm) and to the free NADH (340 nm). The E. coli flavoHb/NADH mixture shows greater absorbance at 470 nm and less absorbance at 340 nm; moreover, spectra must be recorded rapidly to observe the E. coli flavoHbO2 complex because of the NADH oxidase activity (3Gardner A.M.

The other flavoHbO2 complexes do not have as high an oxidase activity (see Table V) but still deplete O2 and NADH in minutes at the 1–10 μmflavoHb concentrations used. A. eutrophusflavoHbO2 shows a relatively low absorbance at 625 nm. Spectra for flavoHbNO and CO complexes and the reduced and oxidized forms reveal similar heme absorbance peaks (Table I).

Activities were assayed at 37 °C with 100 μm NADH as described under “Materials and Methods.” NO dioxygenase activities were measured with 1 μm NO and 200 μmO2. Turnover rates for NO dioxygenation, NO reduction, NADH oxidation, and FAD reduction are expressed relative to the heme content of individual flavoHbs. O2 and NO binding kinetics play a critical role in regulating the catalytic rate of the E. coli NOD activity (3Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Gardner P.R. Dou Y. Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12581-12589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined rates of ligand binding to the S. cerevisiae and A. eutrophus proteins and compared these rates with those for E. coli flavoHb and recombinant sperm whale Mb. The NAD(P)H-reduced flavoHbs show rate constants for O2 association in the range of 17–50 μm−1 s−1, which are only slightly greater than those reported for mammalian Mbs (TableII). The O2 dissociation rate constants for all three flavoHbs are very small, 0.2–0.6 s−1, compared with that for MbO2, 15 s−1. The net result is that all three flavoHbs show O2 association equilibrium constants that are 20–200 times greater than that for Mb. The association rate constants for NO binding to reduced flavoHb(Fe2+) and Mb(Fe2+) vary by <3-fold and are in the same range as the rate constants for O2 binding, 10–30 μm−1s−1. Greater differences are seen in the ligand binding rate constants for NO binding to the oxidized flavoHb(Fe3+)s and for CO binding to the reduced proteins. All three flavoHb(Fe3+)s have unusually high NO association rate constants compared with that for Mb(Fe3+). The NO dissociation rate constants are also higher for flavoHb(Fe3+) than Mb(Fe3+). This result suggests that water is not bound or is only weakly coordinated to the Fe3+ atom in the oxidized forms. This conclusion is supported by the positions of the Soret peaks of the Fe3+(met) forms that are all significantly blue shifted compared with those for human metHb and metMb.Table IIKinetic parameters for ligand binding to flavoHbsLigand pairk′kKμm −1 s −1s −1μm −1O2 S.c. flavoHb (Fe2+)170.6 2-aIn the calculation ofk 02 for these proteins, it was assumed that the NADH oxidase activity of the proteins led to depletion of any free O2 because the observed CO replacement rate was independent of the starting O2 concentration and increased only to a small degree in going from ∼600 to 50 μm starting O2concentration in the presence of ∼600 μm NADH.28 A.e. flavoHb (Fe2+)500.2 2-aIn the calculation ofk 02 for these proteins, it was assumed that the NADH oxidase activity of the proteins led to depletion of any free O2 because the observed CO replacement rate was independent of the starting O2 concentration and increased only to a small degree in going from ∼600 to 50 μm starting O2concentration in the presence of ∼600 μm NADH.250 E.c. flavoHb (Fe2+)380.4486 SW Mb (Fe2+)17151.2NO S.c. flavoHb (Fe2+)10–20 2-bThe reactions were biphasic with ≥70% of the reaction occurring rapidly with the bimolecular rate constant shown.NDND A.e. flavoHb (Fe2+)10–20 2-bThe reactions were biphasic with ≥70% of the reaction occurring rapidly with the bimolecular rate constant shown.NDND E.c. flavoHb (Fe2+)26 2-bThe reactions were biphasic with ≥70% of the reaction occurring rapidly with the bimolecular rate constant shown.0.0002130,000 SW Mb (Fe2+)220.0001220,000NO S.c. flavoHb (Fe3+)230 (0.7) 2-cThe reactions was markedly biphasic with ∼50% of the reaction occurring very rapidly and 50% very slowly (rate constant in parentheses).∼2000.0033 A.e. flavoHb (Fe3+)2.41,2000.002 E.c. flavoHb (Fe3+)44∼4,0000.011 SW Mb (Fe3+)0.08120.007CO S.c. flavoHb (Fe2+)0.50.11 2-bThe reactions were biphasic with ≥70% of the reaction occurring rapidly with the bimolecular rate constant shown.4.5 A.e. flavoHb (Fe2+)0.110.08 2-bThe reactions were biphasic with ≥70% of the reaction occurring rapidly with the bimolecular rate constant shown.1.4 E.c. flavoHb (Fe2+)22 2-dAs shown in Fig. 2, the reaction of CO with E. coli flavoHb (Fe2+) is biphasic with the majority of the reaction occurring very rapidly.

Here we describe nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysates and HeLa cell cytoplasmic extracts that reproduce cap-poly(A) synergy in the absence of such competitor RNAs. Extracts were rendered poly(A)-dependent by ultracentrifugation to partially deplete them of ribosomes and associated initiation factors. Under optimal conditions, values for synergy in reticulocyte lysates approached 10-fold. By using this system, we investigated the molecular mechanism of poly(A) stimulation of translation. Maximal cap-poly(A) cooperativity required the integrity of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4G-poly(A)-binding protein (eIF4G-PABP) interaction, suggesting that synergy results from mRNA circularization. In addition, polyadenylation stimulated uncapped cellular mRNA translation and that driven by the encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosome entry segment (IRES). These effects of poly(A) were also sensitive to disruption of the eIF4G-PABP interaction, suggesting that 5′–3′ end cross-talk is functionally conserved between classical mRNAs and an IRES-containing mRNA.

Microbiol. Rev. 1980; 44: 175-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aside from roles in RNA splicing, stabilization, and transport, the cap structure significantly enhances the recruitment of the 40 S ribosomal subunit to the mRNA 5′ end during translation initiation. The latter function requires recognition of the cap by the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)1 4F. The eIF4F holoenzyme complex consists of the cap-binding protein eIF4E and an ATP-dependent RNA helicase (eIF4A) bound toward the N- and C-terminal ends, respectively, of a scaffold molecule eIF4G (for review see Ref. 2Morley S.J. Curtis P.S. Pain V.M. RNA (NY ). 1997; 3: 1085-1104PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of eIF4G also interacts with eIF3, a complex that associates directly with the 40 S ribosomal subunit. Most mRNAs carry a poly(A) tail at their 3′ ends, which determines mRNA stability (for review see Ref. 3Jacobson A. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1996: 451-480Google Scholar) and enhances translation initiation efficiency (4Doel M.T. Carey N.H. Cell. 1976; 8: 51-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, reports concerning the actual extent of enhancement of translation initiation by the poly(A) tail are somewhat contradictory, depending on the system used. Moderate poly(A)-mediated stimulation of translation can occur in the absence of a cap structure or functional eIF4E, but a cap is absolutely required for optimal poly(A)-mediated translation stimulation (5Tarun Jr., S.Z. Sachs A.B. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2997-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 6Preiss T. Hentze M.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Studies performed in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) and other nuclease-treated cell-free extracts demonstrated that the stimulation of translation upon capping and poly(A) tailing were additive phenomena (7Munroe D. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3441-3455Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 8Iizuka N. Najita L. Franzusoff A. Sarnow P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7322-7330Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In contrast, in vivo translation studies have demonstrated that the poly(A) tail and cap interact synergistically to stimulate translation initiation in yeast, plant spheroplasts, and mammalian cells (5Tarun Jr., S.Z. Sachs A.B. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2997-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 6Preiss T. Hentze M.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 9Gallie D.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2108-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Synergy between the cap and poly(A) tail in promoting translation has also been observed in non-nucleased yeast andDrosophila cell-free translation extracts (6Preiss T. Hentze M.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 8Iizuka N. Najita L. Franzusoff A. Sarnow P. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6146-6154Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, synergy was abrogated by disruption of endogenous mRNA translation in yeast cells (9Gallie D.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2108-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar) or by nuclease treatment of yeast cell-free extracts unless such extracts were supplemented with excess competitor mRNAs (6Preiss T. Hentze M.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). It was thus suggested that an RNA requires the poly(A) tail for translation only when it is competing with other capped and polyadenylated RNAs for limiting concentrations of ribosomes or translation factors. Support for this suggestion came from the demonstration that mutations that affect polyadenylation only significantly reduce translation when introduced into yeast strains harboring low concentrations of ribosomal subunits (11Proweller A. Butler S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6004-6010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Biochemical analyses clearly demonstrated that poly(A) tail-mediated translation stimulation involves increased 40 S subunit recruitment to mRNAs and requires the intervention of poly(A) tail-binding protein (PABP) (5Tarun Jr., S.Z. Sachs A.B. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2997-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). PABP was recently demonstrated to interact physically with the N-terminal region of eIF4G from yeast (12Tarun Jr., S.Z. Sachs A.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7168-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) and from mammals (13Imataka H. Gradi A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7480-7489Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Thus, a closed loop model of translation initiation on capped, polyadenylated mRNAs was postulated (3Jacobson A. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1996: 451-480Google Scholar). Formal proof of mRNA circularization via the cap-eIF4E-eIF4G-PABP-poly(A) interaction was provided by atomic force microscopy of mRNAs complexed with purified recombinant proteins (14Wells S.E. Hillner P.E. Vale R.D. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 135-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). However, the functional consequences of mRNA circularization have not been directly addressed experimentally. Since the closed loop model of translation initiation depends upon interactions between the 5′-terminal cap structure and the 3′ poly(A) tail, the subset of eukaryotic and viral mRNAs that are either uncapped or non-polyadenylated are difficult to accommodate within this model. For certain viral mRNAs, an alternative means of closing the loop has already been proposed. For instance, for capped, non-polyadenylated rotaviral mRNAs, the viral non-structural protein NSP3 binds the conserved rotaviral RNA 3′ end and can interact with eIF4G and displace PABP from the eIF4F complex (15Poncet D. Aponte C. Cohen J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3159-3165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Piron M. Vende P. Cohen J. Poncet D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5811-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). However, the case for picornaviral RNAs remains unresolved. Whereas these viral RNAs are polyadenylated, they are uncapped, and translation initiation is independent of the RNA 5′ end. In fact, ribosome entry on these RNAs occurs internally, several hundred nucleotides downstream of the 5′ end, and is driven by a complex RNA signal of some 400–500 nt, coined the IRES (internal ribosome entry segment) (for review see Ref. 17Jackson R.J. Hunt S.L. Gibbs C.L. Kaminski A. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1994; 19: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Here, we describe mammalian cell-free translation systems that exhibit cap-poly(A) synergy in the absence of added competitor mRNAs. These systems, derived from extracts in which IRES-driven translation is routinely studied, were used to examine the molecular mechanism of poly(A) tail-mediated translational stimulation on classical eukaryotic mRNAs and on an mRNA harboring an IRES. Plasmids were derived from the previously described pXLJCon clone (18Borman A. Jackson R.J. Virology. 1992; 188: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), which contains the cDNA for Xenopus laevis cyclin B2 (including the 5′ and 3′-UTRs) under the control of the bacteriophage T7 promoter, followed by a short artificial polylinker and then the cDNA corresponding to a truncated coding region and the 3′-UTR of the influenza virus NS protein. For the present study, the NS-coding region of pXLJCon was replaced by the gene encoding the p24 capsid protein of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-ILAI; see Ref. 19Wain-Hobson S. Sonigo P. Danos O. Cole S. Alizon M. Cell. 1985; 40: 9-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). The different resulting constructs are represented schematically in Fig. 1. In a first step, the NS-coding region and 3′-UTR were excised by digestion with BamHI and EcoRI and replaced by a PCR-generated fragment corresponding to the 150-nt NS 3′-UTR (sense primer, 5′ ATGGATCCCGGGTGAAGAAGTGAGACACAAAC 3′; antisense primer SP6 primer; 30 cycles: 96 °C 30 s, 55 °C 45 s, 72 °C 1 min) to generate pXLinker. In a second step, a PCR fragment containing the entire p24-coding region was generated to contain uniqueNcoI and SmaI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively (PCR primers p24sense 5′ CCATGGATCCTATAGTGCAGAACATA 3′ and p24antisense 5′ TCCCCCGGGCAAAACTCTTGCCTTATG 3′; 30 cycles: 96 °C 30 s, 55 °C 45 s, 72 °C 2 min). Introduction of the NcoI-SmaI-digested PCR product into pXLinker digested with the same enzymes results in the fusion of p24 in frame between the polylinker ATG initiation codon and the TGA stop codon that precedes the NS 3′-UTR, producing pB2Op24. The resulting p24 gene product thus carries 2 amino acid extensions at each of the N and C termini. For the construction of pB2ΔIRESp24, nucleotides 10–547 of the human rhinovirus type 2 5′-UTR were excised from the previously described pXLJ10–547 (18Borman A. Jackson R.J. Virology. 1992; 188: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) by digestion with SalI andBamHI and were inserted into pB20p24 digested with the same enzymes. The monocistronic p0p24 plasmid was constructed by replacing the small SalI-EcoRI fragment of pJCon (18Borman A. Jackson R.J. Virology. 1992; 188: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) with that from pB20p24. To insert the entire EMCV IRES (from the poly(C) tract to nt 848) into p0p24 (to produce pEMCVp24), the in-filledEcoRI-NcoI small fragment from p-CITE (Novagen) was inserted into the in-filled BamHI site of p0p24.Figure 2Development of an RRL-based translation system that exhibits cap-poly(A) synergy.

The Asp718I-SmaI internal fragment of this PCR product that includes the 3′ end of the coding region was then used to replace the full Asp718-SmaI region of the pB20p24 construct. The resulting pB2 construct thus contains the cyclin-coding region, with a 2-amino acid C-terminal extension, fused in frame with the NS stop codon and 3′-UTR (Fig. 1). Versions of all of these constructions carrying poly(A) stretches were constructed by inserting annealed 5′ AATTA50G 3′ and 5′ AATTCT50 3′ oligonucleotides into the uniqueEcoRI site at the 3′ end of the NS 3′-UTR. This gives an A50 followed directly by a unique EcoRI site, 24 nt downstream of the authentic polyadenylation signal. Constructs were verified by automatic sequencing.

Both NSP3 and 2A proteinase were dialyzed against H100 buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol) prior to use. Rabbit anti-eIF4G peptide 7 antiserum (raised against residues 327–342) was a gift of R. Rhoads. Monoclonal antibody 10E10 against human PABP was a gift of M. Görlach. Nuclease-treated RRL was partially depleted of ribosomes by ultracentrifugation. Briefly, 2-ml volumes of flexi-reticulocyte lysate (Promega) were centrifuged at 90,000 rpm for 15–20 min in a Beckman TL-100 benchtop ultracentrifuge. The supernatant was removed, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. The ribosomal pellets were resuspended in 1/10 volume (with respect to the initial volume of lysate) of H100 buffer and frozen at −80 °C. Non-nucleased HeLa cell S10 extracts were prepared exactly as described previously (22Borman A. Howell M.T. Patton J. Jackson R.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 1775-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and were dialyzed overnight against H100 buffer. Translation-competent HeLa cell S10 extracts were prepared and treated with micrococcal nuclease as described (23Molla A. Paul A.V. Wimmer E. Science. 1991; 254: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) except that dialysis was performed against H100 buffer. Ribosome depletion of translation-competent HeLa cell S10 extracts was performed as described above for RRL. In vitro transcriptions and translations were performed as described previously (24Borman A.M. Kirchweger R. Zeigler E. Rhoads R.E. Skern T. Kean K.M. RNA (NY ). 1997; 3: 186-196PubMed Google Scholar) except that artificially capped transcripts were synthesized in the presence of 0.8 mm cap analogue (Ambion Inc.). Transcription reactions included trace quantities of [α-32P]UTP to allow accurate quantification of RNA yields. All RNAs were purified on G-50 Sephadex spin columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to eliminate non-incorporated cap analogue and nucleotides prior to ethanol precipitation and washing with 70% ethanol. In vitro translation reactions were performed in the presence of [35S]methionine. RRL-based reactions contained 50% by volume of flexi-reticulocyte lysate (Promega) or ribosome-depleted RRL and 33% by volume of H100 buffer or non-nucleased HeLa cell S10 extract in H100 buffer, and were programmed with the indicated concentrations of in vitro transcribed mRNAs. Final concentrations, respectively, of added KCl and MgCl2 were 102 and 0.8 mm (for the experiments presented in Fig. 2) and 115 and 0.9 mm in all subsequent reactions. For translation reactions performed in translation-competent HeLa cell extracts, reactions containing 40% of HeLa cell extract were programmed with 6.5 μg/ml of in vitro transcribed mRNAs. In certain experiments, translation reactions were supplemented with ribosomal pellet resuspended in H100 buffer, or purified recombinant proteins (2A proteinase or a fragment of NSP3) also in H100 buffer. Translations were performed for 90 min at 30 °C, and the translation products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (25Dasso M.C. Jackson R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6485-6497Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), using gels containing 20% w/v acrylamide. Dried gels were exposed to Hyperfilm β-max (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) typically for 12–16 h. Densitometric quantification of translation products was as described previously (24Borman A.M. Kirchweger R. Zeigler E. Rhoads R.E. Skern T. Kean K.M. RNA (NY ). 1997; 3: 186-196PubMed Google Scholar) using multiple exposures of each gel to ensure that the linear response range of the film was respected and that low levels of translation could be accurately quantified. In some experiments, the total radioactivity incorporated into proteins was assayed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation exactly as described (26Jackson R.J. Hunt T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 50-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The data presented in each figure are representative of at least three independent translation assays. Quantification of 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits in translation extracts was performed exactly as described previously (27Foiani M. Cigan A.M. Paddon C.J. Harashima S. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3203-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), using 110-μl aliquots of RRL or translation-competent HeLa cell S10 extract (20–30 A 260 units). Translation reactions (200 μl) were incubated with and without recombinant NSP3 for 30 min at 30 °C before immunoprecipitation as described previously (16Piron M. Vende P. Cohen J. Poncet D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5811-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) with 1 μl per reaction of rabbit anti-eIF4G peptide 7 antisera. Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitated proteins was exactly as described (24Borman A.M. Kirchweger R. Zeigler E. Rhoads R.E. Skern T. Kean K.M. RNA (NY ). 1997; 3: 186-196PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated with mouse anti-PABP primary antibody, followed by horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies, and were revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECLplus, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To date, several cell-free translation extracts have been described that reproduce the cap-poly(A) synergistic stimulation of translation previously observed in vivo (6Preiss T. Hentze M.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 8Iizuka N. Najita L. Franzusoff A. Sarnow P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7322-7330Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 10Gebauer F. Corona D.F.V. Preiss T. Becker P.B. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6146-6154Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, synergy was only observed in these cell-free extracts in the presence of competitor mRNAs (6Preiss T. Hentze M.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), which complicates a dissection of the molecular basis of synergy. The primary aim of the study presented here was to develop cell-free extracts from mammals that would exhibit synergy between the cap and poly(A) tail in the absence of added competitor mRNAs, and therefore could be used to examine the molecular mechanism of cap-poly(A) cooperativity. The effects of the poly(A) tail on translation can be measured in two ways: by comparing the translation efficiency of uncapped mRNAs with and without a poly(A) tail, or by examining the synergy obtained upon addition of both poly(A) and a cap to an mRNA (28Tarun Jr., S.Z. Wells S.E. Deardorff J.A. Sachs A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9046-9051Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). To carry out a comprehensive analysis, we compared the translation efficiency of four versions of a given mRNA as follows: neither capped nor polyadenylated (−/−), capped and non-polyadenylated (+/−), uncapped and polyadenylated (−/+), and both capped and polyadenylated (+/+). These were synthesized in vitro from cDNA transcription templates that only differed by an oligonucleotide-derived homopolymer A50 insertion preceding a unique EcoRI site at the end of a 150-nt 3′-UTR (pB2; see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig.1). Thus, the polyadenylated mRNAs described here terminate with an A50- GAAUU tail. It has previously been shown that a short 3′ end heterologous sequence does not affect poly(A) tail-promoted translation (6Preiss T. Hentze M.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and that 50 A residues suffice to demonstrate the roles of the poly(A) tail in translation initiation (9Gallie D.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2108-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 29Preiss T. Muckenthaler M. Hentze M.W. RNA (NY ). 1998; 4: 1321-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). B2 RNAs were first translated in a nuclease-treated RRL in vitro translation system, in the absence of added competitor RNAs (see Fig. 2 A, RRL + 0% HeLaS10 lanes). As expected, translation of capped B2 mRNA in this system was some 30-fold more efficient than that of the uncapped equivalent (compare +/− and −/− lanes). Polyadenylation of uncapped B2 mRNA stimulated its translation approximately 6-fold (compare −/+ and −/− lanes). Moreover, additive stimulation of translation was achieved by polyadenylation and capping (compare the +/+ lane with the sum of the +/− and −/+lanes), in accordance with previous reports (7Munroe D. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3441-3455Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 8Iizuka N. Najita L. Franzusoff A. Sarnow P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7322-7330Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Since poly(A)-mediated synergistic stimulation of translation in nuclease-treated yeast extracts required the presence of competitor RNAs (6Preiss T. Hentze M.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), we next measured the translation activity of the B2 mRNAs in RRL supplemented with increasing amounts of non-nucleased HeLa cell S10 extract. Non-nucleased cell extract was employed rather than purified poly(A) RNA to ensure that physiological cell equivalents of mRNA were added. Global translation efficiency was significantly lowered in such conditions (Fig. 2 A, RRL compare 0, 16.5 and 33 HeLaS10 lanes). Furthermore, the stimulatory effects of addition of a cap or poly(A) tail alone were then reduced (see values for Relative Stimulation, Fig.2 A). In contrast, slight cap-poly(A) synergy (calculated as the relative stimulation of +/+ RNA divided by the sum of the relative stimulations of −/+ and +/− RNAs) was reproducibly observed. This increased concomitantly with the quantity of added competitor but never reached 2-fold. It has been suggested that the concentration of free ribosomesper se determines the magnitude of poly(A)-mediated translation stimulation (11Proweller A. Butler S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6004-6010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, in an attempt to amplify cap-poly(A) synergy in the RRL system, and to circumvent the need for addition of competitor RNAs, RRL was partially depleted of ribosomes by ultracentrifugation (see “Experimental Procedures”). Translation efficiency was dramatically reduced in reactions containing the ultracentrifugation supernatant compared with those based on intact RRL (Fig. 2 A, compare ribosome-depleted RRL andRRL lanes; 0% HeLaS10). The stimulatory effects of capping non-polyadenylated mRNA and polyadenylating uncapped mRNA were also reduced as compared with the reactions performed in standard RRL. However, cap-poly(A) cooperative stimulation of translation was observed (synergy of approximately 3-fold). Whereas the addition of a non-nucleased HeLa cell S10 extract to ribosome-depleted RRL moderately improved global translation efficiency, it did not affect the synergy (see Fig. 2 A, right-hand side), presumably because the positive effects of the added competitor mRNAs in increasing synergy are negated by the free ribosomes and initiation factors present in the HeLa cell extract. Thus, all further studies using the RRL system were performed with ribosome-depleted RRL, without HeLa cell extract supplementation. Sucrose gradient analysis was performed to determine the proportions of 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits present in the different translation systems used (Fig. 2 B). The concentration of 60 S and 40 S ribosomal subunits in ribosome-depleted RRL was below the detection limit of the assay (middle plot), whereas, compared with RRL (upper plot), larger 40 S and 60 S peaks and an additional peak corresponding to 80 S ribosomes could be detected in RRL supplemented with non-nucleased HeLa cell extract (lower plot). As an additional control of the ribosome-depleted sy"

Members of this family may be inactivated by point mutations that favor transition to a polymeric conformation. This polymeric conformation underlies diseases as diverse as α1-antitrypsin deficiency-related cirrhosis, thrombosis, angio-edema, and dementia. The precise structural linkage within a polymer has been the subject of much debate with evidence for reactive loop insertion into β-sheet A or C or as strand 7A. We have used site directed cysteine mutants and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to measure a number of distances between monomeric units in polymeric α1-antitrypsin. We have then used a combinatorial approach to compare distances determined from FRET with distances obtained from 2.9 × 106 different possible orientations of the α1-antitrypsin polymer. The closest matches between experimental FRET measurements and theoretical structures show conclusively that polymers of α1-antitrypsin form by insertion of the reactive loop into β-sheet A. α1-Antitrypsin is the most abundant circulating protease inhibitor and the archetype of the serine protease inhibitor or serpin superfamily.

It is the archetypal member of theserine protease inhibitor or serpin superfamily (1Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar), and like other members of this family it shares a common molecular structure based on a mobile reactive center loop and a five-stranded β-sheet A (2Elliott P.R.

The reactive loop acts as a peptide “bait” for the cognate protease, and after docking the loop is cleaved and the acyl intermediate is inserted into β-sheet A. This major conformational change results in the translocation of the protease to the end of the molecule distal to the initial docking site (6Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol.

Mobility of the reactive loop is essential for inhibitory function but also favors aberrant conformations associated with disease (10Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). In particular the loop is able to insert into the β-sheet of a second molecule to form well ordered polymers that are the basis of the profound plasma deficiency of the Z (11Lomas D.A. Evans D.L.

The polymerized protein accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum of the hepatocyte to form inclusions that are associated with juvenile hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatoocellular carcinoma (14Eriksson S.

The accompanying plasma deficiency predisposes the Z homozygote to early onset emphysema (15Eriksson S. Acta Med. Scand. 1965; 432 (suppl.): 1-85Google Scholar). Loop sheet polymers have also been reported with dysfunctional mutants of C1-inhibitor (16Aulak K.S. Eldering E. Hack C.E. Lubbers Y.P.T. Harrison R.A. Mast A. Cicardi M. Davis III, A.E. J. Biol.

Moreover, this conformational transition occurs spontaneously in plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 and is likely to be important in the control of intracellular proteolysis (20Mikus P. Urano T. Liljeström P. Ny T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 1071-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The precise protein-protein linkage that underlies polymer formation remains unclear. Polymerization of Z α1-antitrypsin can be blocked by peptides that are homologous to the reactive center loop by annealing to β-sheet A (11Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 21Skinner R. Chang W.-S.W. Jin C. Pei X. Huntington J.A. Abrahams J.-P. Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It was therefore proposed that polymers were formed by the insertion of the loop of one molecule into the β-sheet A of another. The crystal structure of an antithrombin dimer revealed another mechanism with the loop of one molecule inserting to replace strand 1 of β-sheet C of a second molecule (3Schreuder H.A. de Boer B. Dijkema R. Mulders J. Theunissen H.J.M. Grootenhuis P.D.J. Hol W.G.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar,4Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R. Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Support for this hypothesis came from the antithrombin variant Rouen VI (18Bruce D. Perry D.J. Borg J.-Y. Carrell R.W. Wardell M.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2265-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and the Mmalton variant of α1-antitrypsin (13Lomas D.A. Elliott P.R. Sidhar S.K.

Epitope mapping of monoclonal antibodies specific to C1-inhibitor also suggested polymer formation via a C-sheet mechanism (22Patston P.A. Hauert J. Michaud M. Schapira M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). More recently the crystal structure of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 has raised the possibility of polymerization in which the reactive loop anneals as strand 7A (5Sharp A.M. Stein P.E.

We have used recombinant α1-antitrypsin with three cysteine variants to determine the structural mechanism of polymer formation. The data show conclusively that α1-antitrypsin polymers form by a reactive loop:β-sheet A linkage. Wild type Pittsburgh α1-antitrypsin (M358R) and three cysteine variants (S121C, D159C, and I360C) were prepared and cloned into the pET16b plasmid as detailed previously (6Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15582-15589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The S121C, D159C, and I360C cysteine variants also carried the C232S mutation, ensuring that all mutants contained only one free cysteine residue. The α1-antitrypsin sequence of each plasmid was confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Each plasmid containing the mutated α1-antitrypsin was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen). The recombinant proteins were expressed and purified from inclusion bodies as detailed previously (6Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15582-15589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Purity was confirmed by SDS and nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the proteins were dialyzed into 50 mm Tris, 50 mmKCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4 and stored at −80 °C until required. SDS and nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, inhibitory activity, and measurement of the rate of polymerization were performed as detailed previously (23Dafforn T.R. Mahadeva R. Elliott P.R. Sivasothy P. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9548-9555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The proteins were labeled with 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein (5-IAF)1 and tetramethylrhodamine-5-iodoacetamide (5-TMRIA) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes Inc.). The labeled protein was separated from unreacted label with a NAP-10 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel filtration column. The 5-IAF labeling of each variant was adjusted to 50% by addition of the corresponding unlabeled mutant. All fluorescence measurements were made using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50B spectrofluorimeter. Spectra were measured at 25 °C using slit widths of 2.5 nm for the excitation beam and 4.0 nm for the emitted beam. The 5-IAF label was excited at 495 nm, and emitted light was measured between 500 and 600 nm. Energy transfer between 5-IAF and 5-TMRIA was measured by recording the decrease in intensity of light emitted from 5-IAF. This method was used instead of measuring changes in acceptor signal, because the signal obtained after subtraction of the appropriate controls was significantly larger. This allowed an increase in the accuracy of the measurement and hence a decrease in the error for later calculations. The efficiency of transfer was calculated using the following relationship. E=1−FD,AFDEquation 1 where F D,A represents the fluorescence of the donor (5-IAF) in the presence of acceptor (5-TMRIA) andFD is the fluorescence of the donor only.F D,A was measured as the emission spectra of a mixture of donor and acceptor labeled protein excited at 490 nm (slit widths were 2.5 nm excitation, 4 nm emission) after incubation at 45 °C for 48 h. The spectrum was normalized for the contribution of non-FRET acceptor emission by subtraction of the spectrum of a polymerized sample containing labeled acceptor and unlabeled donor. F D was obtained by measuring the fluorescence of a solution containing the labeled donor with unlabeled acceptor that had undergone the same incubation. Adjustments were made for the effect of less than 100% of the acceptor being labeled with 5-TMRIA (50% labeling for Cys360 and 20% for Cys159) by adjusting the intensity F D,Ausing the following relationship.FD,A(corrected)=FD,A(observed)−(1−p)FDpEquation 2 where p is the fraction of labeled acceptor.

The quantum yield was measured for each labeling position (121, 159, 232, and 360) and ranged from 0.59 to 0.23 giving R 0 values from 34 to 40 Å. Quenching experiments were carried out on the four fluorescein labeled proteins before and after polymerization. A 0.5 mg/ml solution of each protein was split into two aliquots; one aliquot was incubated at 45 °C for 48 h, and the other was stored at 4 °C. The change in fluorescence of the fluorescein probe on each protein was then measured (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 530 nm) during the addition of 6 m acrylamide to a final concentration of 1 m. Acrylamide was chosen as the quenching agent because its polar quality restricts quenching to fluorophore moieties on the surface of the protein (27Sherwin, S. S., and Leavis, P. C. Methods Enzymol., XLIX, 222–236.Google Scholar, 28Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1999: 237-265Crossref Google Scholar, 29Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). Unlike the charged quenchers such as iodide, acrylamide shows little sensitivity to the electrostatic environment around the fluorophore. The fluorescence changes were then rescaled to take into account any error because of dilution, and the resulting quenched data were plotted. These data were analyzed with respect to the following Stern-Volmer equation (27Sherwin, S. S., and Leavis, P. C. Methods Enzymol., XLIX, 222–236.Google Scholar). I0/I=1+ksv[Q]Equation 5 where I 0 is the initial fluorescence,I is the fluorescence intensity at concentration Q of quenching agent, and kSV is the Stern-Volmer constant. Our recent 2.0 Å structure of α1-antitrypsin (30Elliott P.R. Pei X.Y. Dafforn T.R. Lomas D.A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1274-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) was used as the monomeric unit to construct a polymer. All modeling was performed using Insight II 97.0 and CharmM (MSI, San Diego, CA). An initial approximation of the structure of the polymer was obtained by performing an exhaustive search of all possible polymer structures. This was achieved by searching the six spatial degrees (three translational and three rotational) of freedom that define the relative positions of monomers within a polymer using the following method: 1) A cube was defined with 120 Å long sides positioned on the center of mass of an α1-antitrypsin molecule. 2) The cube was split up into a grid along all three axes with a spacing of 10 Å. 3) A second α1-antitrypsin molecule was translated to a point on the grid. 4) The second α1-antitrypsin was rotated about its center exploring all three axes of rotational space at 30° intervals. 5) For each rotation a new grid was defined with the second α1-antitrypsin at its center. 6) A third α1-antitrypsin molecule was placed using the same translation and rotations that were used to place the second molecule. 7) Steps 5 and 6 were repeated until a 7-mer polymer was created. 8) Theoretical transfer efficiencies (E) were calculated between the fourth monomer in the polymer and all other monomers using Equation 3 and the methods of Miki and Iio (31Miki M. Iio T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 790: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). 9) The totalE value was calculated, and the structure was saved if it matched the experimental values. 10) The procedure was repeated allowing exploration of all possible relative orientations at each grid point. Implementation of this method using translational grid spacings of 10 Å and rotational grid spacings of 30° led to 126(2.9 × 106) conformations being searched. For a conformation to be selected as a candidate for the real polymer structure, five of seven of the theoretical E values calculated for a conformation had to be within 0.05 of the experimental value, and the resulting polymer had to be sterically sensible. The reactive center loop between the P3 and P8 residues was modeled into a β-strand to complement insertion into either β-sheet A or C of the N+1 molecule. A- and C-sheet polymers were built according to the structures proposed previously (2Elliott P.R. Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Abrahams J.-P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 32Chang W.-S.W. Whisstock J. Hopkins P.C.R. Lesk A.M. Carrell R.W. Wardell M.R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Measurements of solvent accessible surface area were carried out using Getarea 1.1 (33Fraczkiewicz R. Braun W. J. Comp. Chem. 1998; 19: 319-333Crossref Scopus (848) Google Scholar) with a probe radius of 1.4 Å. Wild type Pittsburgh α1-antitrypsin (M358R) and the S121C, D159C, and I360C variants were purified to homogeneity and migrated as a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. They were 45, 71, 70, and 77% active, respectively, as inhibitors when assessed against bovine α-chymotrypsin. The polymerization rates of the cysteine variants of α1-antitrypsin in both native and derivatized form (with covalently bound 5-TMRIA) were measured by monitoring changes in both intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and fluorescence of the bound probe (Table I) and were confirmed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The values were similar to those of wild type recombinant α1-antitrypsin (358M), but polymerization of the four variants corresponded to an overall biphasic decrease in fluorescence. This is the reverse of that observed in our previous study using plasma derived protein and other recombinant mutants (23Dafforn T.R. Mahadeva R. Elliott P.R. Sivasothy P. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9548-9555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The difference results from the redox state of Cys-232, which greatly affects the fluorescence signal from polymerization but does not affect the polymerization process itself (unpublished observations). The close proximity of Cys-232 to one of the two tryptophans, Trp-238 (6.5 Å), and the substitution of Cys-232 for a serine in the S121C, D159C, and I360C variants are likely to change the signal. Measurements of the changes in 5-TMRIA fluorescence during polymerization of each variant at 45 °C show that in three of the four variants the derivatization process does not alter the rate of polymerization. However the S121C mutation reduced the polymerization rate by 80%, which suggests that the region around residue 121 is important in the polymerization process.Table IRate of polymerization of the α1-antitrypsin Pittsburgh variants during incubation at 0.1 mg/ml and 45 °CMeasurementRateS121CD159CPittsburgh wild typeI360CWildtype antitrypsins −1Unlabeled intrinsic fluorescence2.62 ± 0.34 × 10−52.37 ± 0.41 × 10−51.43 ± 0.33 × 10−53.65 ± 0.25 × 10−53.65 ± 0.20 × 10−55-TMRIA fluorescence0.51 ± 0.25 × 10−52.10 ± 0.57 × 10−53.17 ± 0.58 × 10−52.85 ± 0.34 × 10−52.70 ± 0.03 × 10−5Rates were obtained by fitting the data to either a double (intrinsic fluorescence) or single exponential function (5-TMRIA) (23Dafforn T.R.

We used the optical phenomenon of fluorescence resonance energy transfer to investigate the orientation of monomeric units within the α1-antitrypsin polymer. α1-Antitrypsin was labeled with fluorophores via cysteines at four locations throughout the protein. These residues were located 1) on the reactive center loop at residue 360, 2) on the C-sheet at residue 232, 3) at the bottom of s2A at residue 121, and 4) on the top of helix F at residue 159 (Fig.1 A). Mixtures were then prepared using protein labeled at 360 and 159 with 5-TMRIA to act as FRET acceptors and protein labeled at 121, 159, 232, and 360 with 5-IAF to act as FRET donors. These mixtures were then polymerized by incubation at 45 °C for 48 h. To ensure that no monomeric material remained in the sample, FRET efficiencies were also measured following incubation at 55 °C for 48 h. The results from this experiment were identical to those carried out at 45 °C. The efficiency of FRET was measured by comparing emission spectra derived from exciting at the FRET donor wavelength of polymerized material with and without an acceptor (Fig. 1 B). Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were also made for each labeled protein to assess whether the labels showed an isotropic distribution and hence that the assumption of a value of 23 for κ 2 was valid. The values obtained ranged from 0.08 for the label on residue 232 to 0.26 for the label on residue 121. Assessment of the effect of the lack of isotropy on the value of R 0 was carried out using the methods of Dale et al. (34Dale R.E. Eisinger J. Blumberg W.E. Biophys. J. 1979; 26: 161-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) and showed that this would affect the accuracy of R 0 by 1.1 Å at most. These data were then used in combination with the respective R 0 to calculate the distances between the labels within the polymer (TableII). The FRET efficiencies for polymerized α1-antitrypsin were well within the region that allowed accurate values for R to be determined for all FRET pairs except 121–159. The measurement of FRET between proteins labeled at 159 and 360 in both directions (159 donor to 360 acceptor and 360 donor to 159 acceptor) provided an internal check of the consistency of FRET measurements. The FRET efficiencies calculated from these 2 pairings were in very close agreement (159 → 360, E = 0.53; 360 → 159, E = 0.47), providing confidence in the accuracy of the measurements.Table IIComparison of FRET efficiencies with those calculated from modeled structuresFRET pairExperimental FRET signalFRET signal calculated from model structuresOriginal A-sheet polymer (2)C-sheet polymer (32)Strand s7A A-sheet polymer (5)12121–3600.55>0.900.100.780.550.57159–3600.53>0.900.30>0.900.830.90232–3600.140.15>0.900.470.180.18360–3600.170.09>0.900.790.120.21121–15900.100.080.080.010.03159–1590.140.340.120.120.030.06232–1590.90>0.90>0.900.640.850.95360–1590.47R values were calculated with respect to a κ2value of 2/3.

Stern-Volmer constants were derived from the linear slopes of fluorescence plotted against increasing acrylamide concentration. In each case the linear fit to the experimental data was achieved with a correlation coefficient (r) of greater than 0.98, thus indicating the presence of only collision quenching (27Sherwin, S. S., and Leavis, P. C. Methods Enzymol., XLIX, 222–236.Google Scholar, 28Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1999: 237-265Crossref Google Scholar, 29Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). Stern-Volmer constants were measured for each labeled mutant before and after polymerization (TableIII and Fig.2). These measurements allowed the change in solvent accessibility of the probe to be assessed during polymer formation. It might be expected that the transition of a protein from monomer to polymer must occlude at least some of the protein surface from solvent. Our measurements of Stern-Volmer constants for each labeled protein showed that in none of the four cases didk sv decrease substantially upon transition to the polymeric form. A decrease in k sv might have been predicted if the probe had become less solvent accessible because of the binding of a neighboring monomer in the polymer. In fact in two cases, following labeling at residues 121 and 360, thek sv increased, which is indicative of the probe becoming more accessible to solvent.Table IIIComparison of Stern-Volmer values calculated from acrylamide quenching experimentsProteinStern-Volmer constantsMonomericPolymericM −1S121C0.350.56D159C0.410.48Pittsburgh wild type (232C)0.540.59I360C0.260.50Stern-Volmer values were calculated for each labeled protein in the monomeric and polymeric form and represent an average of three experiments. Open table in a new tab Stern-Volmer values were calculated for each labeled protein in the monomeric and polymeric form and represent an average of three experiments. Three models were used in the initial assignment of FRET distances (Fig.3 A). These models represented the proposed A- and C-sheet linkages (2Elliott P.R. Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Abrahams J.-P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 32Chang W.-S.W. Whisstock J. Hopkins P.C.R. Lesk A.M. Carrell R.W. Wardell M.R.

Structure. 1999; 7: 111-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Measurements were made between fluorophores in all possible α1-antitrypsin molecules inhabiting three positions within the polymer either side of the monomer containing the donor fluorophore. This allowed for the possibility that helical arrangements of the polymers may bring nonconsecutive units into close contact (like the 1–4 interaction observed between amino acids in an α-helix). Comparison of the values for E determined by FRET and those calculated from the three existing models show distinct differences in each case. For the A-sheet model, the values for the 121–360 and 159–360 pair show significant differences, although there is good agreement with all the values in which 159 acted as acceptor. In contrast the C-sheet model has discrepancies with the transfer efficiency values for all pairings apart from 232–159 and 159–159. Conventional modeling techniques that have been employed in studies of the serpin-protease complex using FRET are not applicable to polymers. The FRET signal produced by a polymeric structure is complicated by the large number of possible positions that donors and acceptors can occupy. This problem can only be solved if the polymer forms a regular extended three-dimensional structure in which FRET only occurs between near neighbors in the polymer. Electron micrographs of serpin polymers show this to be the case (11Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 12Lomas D.A. Finch J.T. Seyama K. Nukiwa T. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15333-15335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This greatly simplifies the situation allowing a solution to be determined by computation. For example, an acceptor molecule on monomer nin an extended polymer may participate in FRET with a donor on then + 1 monomer as well as n + 2, n + 3, etc., and n − 1, n − 2. . . . . We have developed a computational method that automates this analysis. The program CharmM was used to develop an algorithm that performs an exhaustive search of possible conformations of α1-antitrypsin polymers. Calculations of theoretical efficiencies for transfers from n − 3 to n+ 3 were then made for each new conformation, and a total efficiency for the conformation was calculated. This allowed us to test almost 3 million conformations. A heptameric model of the serpin polymer used as initial modeling studies showed that even in the most compact polymer, the FRET from monomers more distant than n + 3 andn − 3 was insignificant. Results from this search show that the parameters imposed by the experimental FRET results were only matched by 11 polymer structures. Closer examination of these structures showed that three could be discarded because they were represented by a polymer of monomers that were spaced too far apart to allow intermolecular linkage. Two structures were discarded as the monomeric units showed extensive overlap. The six remaining structures are shown in Fig. 3 B. In all cases the monomers are arranged such that the RCL of one monomer is in close proximity to the A-sheet of a second monomer. Closer examination of the structures shows that these six candidates can be further classified into two groups: Group 1 contains five structures in which the orientation of the monomers places the RCL of one monomer close to the s7A-s4A position, and Group 2 contains one structure in which the orientation of the monomers places the RCL of one monomer close to the s2A-s3A position. To simplify the analysis of these structures, a representative of each group was analyzed in more detail in Table II. These structures have five of seven FRET efficiency values within 0.05 of those determined by experiment. The other two anomalous FRET efficiency values were measured using experimental values determined using fluorescein attached to residue 159. This may suggest that the position of 159 in the crystal structure of the monomer used to build the polymers is different to the position of 159 in the polymer. Stern-Volmer quenching constants were used to discriminate between s4A and s7A linkage. Perhaps unexpectedly there was no decrease in the solvent accessibility of any of the probes. However, closer examination of the positions of the labeled residues showed that none of them became buried in any of the polymer models. Measurement of the Stern-Volmer constant for protein labeled at position 121 showed an increase in solvent accessibility in the polymeric form. Examination of the positions of this residue in structures of α1-antitrypsin with and without insertions into the s4A position showed that upon insertion into s4A residue 121 becomes 25% more exposed. This demonstrates that the polymer must result from s4A linkage. In summary the measurement of FRET using probes at different points within α1-antitrypsin has allowed an assessment of the viability of all possible structures of the α1-antitrypsin polymer. The results of this search demonstrate that candidate structures cluster into two groups. The use of Stern-Volmer quenching experiments have allowed us to propose that the linkage is by an insertion of the reactive loop of one molecule into s4A of a second. Understanding this linkage provides a firm basis for rational drug design to block reactive center loop-β-sheet A interactions and so ameliorate the associated disease. We thank Dr. E.

Inhibitory neurotransmitters that lower cytoplasmic cAMP levels are expected to negatively regulate neuronal transcription through CREB-dependent mechanisms.

Although the precise functional consequences of this association have not yet been deciphered in detail, it is thought that subunit dimerization promotes proper posttranslational processing, membrane targeting, and assembly into specific signaling matrices in subcellular neuronal specializations (31Couve A.

By means of yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) interaction cloning, biochemical, and functional reporter assays, as well as immunocytochemistry, we now provide evidence that metabotropic GABABRs are also capable of directly interacting with transcription factors and thus may utilize a mechanism for transcriptional regulation unique to membrane receptors. Our mutational analysis indicates that GABABR bind to ATF-4, a transcription factor of the leucine zipper ATF/CREB family, via their C-terminal leucine zipper motifs, which in vivo may result in the regulation of gene transcription upon stimulation. Two independent Y2H assays were used in parallel. Both the MATCHMAKER II (CLONTECH) and the LexA (OriGene Technologies) systems were used to screen rat brain cDNA libraries constructed with the activation domain vectors pAD-GAL4 and pJG4–5, respectively, using amino acids 848–960 of the C-terminal coding region of GABABR1a (18Kaupmann K. Huggel K. Heid J. Flor P.J. Bischoff S. Mickel S.J. McMaster G. Angst C. Bittiger H. Froestl W. Bettler B. Nature. 1997; 386: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar) as bait. C-terminal baits were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a rat brain library and inserted into the DNA-binding domain vector pGBT9 and the galactose-inducible vector pGilda, respectively. Screening with the pGBT9 and pGilda bait yielded colonies that grew on the corresponding selection plates complemented with 10 mm 3-aminotriazole for the MATCHMAKER system and were positive in the β-galactosidase assay. Isolated plasmids were sequenced on both strands using the ABI PRISM sequenase dye terminator kit on an automatic sequencer. For analysis of the interaction site, GABABR1 and ATF-4 deletions were generated by polymerase chain reaction with specific oligonucleotides and subcloned into pGBT9 and pAD-GAL4. Yeast strains HF7c and EGY 48 were cotransformed with 100 ng each of bait and prey vector, streaked out on agar plates lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine (MATCHMAKER), and also lacking uracil (LexA). Colony growth/activation of the HIS3 and LEU reporter genes, respectively, as well as β-galactosidase activity were controlled after 4 days. Rat cerebral cortices were homogenized in a Teflon glass Potter homogenizer with 12 strokes at 900 rpm in 20 ml of ice-cold 0.32 m sucrose, 4 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.3, containing Complete and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 800 × g in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor (DuPont). The resulting pellet was used as crude nuclear fraction (P1). The supernatant was recovered and spun at 27,000 × gfor another 30 min. The resulting pellet (P2) was resuspended in 3 ml of homogenization buffer and frozen until needed. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of GABABR (GST-GBR1 and GST-GBR2) and synaptoporin tail regions (amino acids 198–265) were constructed in pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using specific EcoRI- and SalI-flanked oligonucleotides. Full-length ATF-4 was fused to the C terminus of GST in pGEX-5X-1, and maltose-binding protein (MBP-ATF-4) in pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs) using EcoRI and XhoI sites, and electroporated into Epicurian Escherichia coli BL21 (Stratagene). Expression of fusion protein was induced by 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3–5 h. Cells were broken in a French press in PBS, and soluble protein fractions were recovered in the supernatant after centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h and kept frozen until needed. Glutathione beads (30 μl) were loaded by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C in PBS with 150 μg of GST and the fusion proteins between GST and the C termini of synaptoporin, GBR1 and GBR2. An extract (100 μl) of bacterially expressed MBP-ATF-4 was then added to preloaded beads in binding buffer (PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100, and Complete) and rotated at 4 °C for 3 h. Pelleted beads were washed three times with binding buffer and once with PBS. Bound proteins were eluted using SDS sample buffer and separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. To control for MBP-ATF-4 binding, samples were subjected to Western blotting with rabbit anti-MBP antibodies (1:10,000; New England Biolabs). ATF-4 pull-downs from P1 brain extract were achieved by mixing 100 μl of GST or GST-GBR1 bacterial extracts with 10 mg of brain P1 Triton extract in 10 ml of 10 mmHEPES/NaOH, pH 7.3, containing 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 for 2 h at 4 °C. After incubation, 50 μl of glutathione beads were added and the mixture was incubated for an additional 2 h. Glutathione beads were then recovered by centrifugation and washed three times vigorously with PBST (PBS with 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100). Proteins bound to the beads were eluted by SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-CREB2/ATF-4 antibodies (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Affinity purification of native GABABR1 from the solubilized P2 fraction was performed using an aliquot of the P2 fraction. The P2 (8 mg of protein) fraction was solubilized for 1 h with 1.5% Triton X-100 in a 3-ml final volume of Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors). After ultracentrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h, the supernatant was incubated for 5 h with 30 μl of glutathione beads preloaded with either GST or GST-ATF-4 (150 μg). Bound material was recovered from glutathione beads after washing four times with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100 and one wash with Tris-buffered saline alone. Bound proteins were then eluted with SDS sample buffer. Proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using a polyclonal goat anti-GABABR1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on 6%, 10%, or 12% polyacrylamide gels. For Western blot analysis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). First antibodies were overlaid with goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies, and chemiluminescence was detected using the Pico detection kit (Pierce). The trans PathDetect® reporting system (Stratagene) was used to test if ATF-4 was involved in activating transcriptional expression upon receptor stimulation. For all experiments HEK293-GBR cells were used that had been stably tranfected with GABABR1 and GABABR2 subunits. A fusion transactivator protein between ATF-4 (or constitutively MEKK-activated Jun) and the GAL4 DNA binding domain was constructed and transfected (pFA-ATF-4; 50 ng) into HEK293-GBR cells together with vectors carrying the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the GAL4 promoter (pFR-Luc; 1 μg) and a vector expressing β-galactosidase (50 ng). 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with serum-free medium, and 18 h later lysed with 500 μl of lysis buffer and the supernatant centrifuged to remove cell debris. Luciferase activity was measured with a luminometer (Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay, Roche Diagnostics). For expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes, capped run-off poly(A+) cRNA transcripts were synthesized from GABABR1a, GABABR2, ATF-4, and Kir3.1/3.2 concatemers (32Wischmeyer E. Döring F. Wischmeyer E. Spauschus A. Thomzig A. Veh R. Karschin A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 194-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and ∼3 ng of each injected in defolliculated oocytes. Oocytes were incubated at 19 °C in ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 -7.5), supplemented with 100 μg/ml gentamicin and 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, and assayed 72 h after injection. Two-electrode voltage-clamp measurements were performed with a Turbo Tec-10 C amplifier (npi) and sampled through an EPC9 (Heka Electronics) interface using Pulse/Pulsefit software (Heka). Oocytes were placed in a small volume perfusion chamber and bathed with ND96 or “high K+” solution (96 mm KCl, 2 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4–7.5). Recombinant SFV harboring ATF-4 were engineered and processed as described previously (33Ashery U. Betz A. Xu T. Brose N. Rettig J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In brief, the cDNA of the N-terminally EGFP-tagged fusion protein ATF-4-EGFP was subcloned into pSFV1 (Life Technologies, Inc.). After linearization with SpeI, cDNA was in vitro transcribed using SP6 RNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). BHK21 cells were transfected by electroporation (400 V, 975 microfarads) with a mixture of 10 μg of pSFV/ATF-4-EGFP and pSFV-helper2, respectively. After 24 h supernatant was collected and stored in 450-μl aliquots at −80 °C. Prior to treatment of neuronal cultures, aliquots of virus were activated by 100 μl of chymotrypsin (2 mg/ml). Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons were prepared from 1-day-old rats as described previously (34Bekkers J.M. Stevens C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Hippocampal neurons were cultured in Neurobasal A medium supplemented with B27 (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 12-well plates (2 ml in each well) for 14 days. Half of the medium was removed from each well and stored at 37 °C. For infection, 20–50 μl of activated virus was added per well. After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C, the virus-containing medium was replaced with stored aliquots. Expression of ATF-4-EGFP was observed 12–14 h after infection. For immunostaining, hippocampal neurons were fixed with 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and blocked with 2% (v/v) normal goat serum. Subsequently, neurons were incubated overnight with guinea pig anti-GABABR1 (1:1000; PharMingen) and rat anti-synaptophysin (1:1000; a gift of R. Jahn, Göttingen) antibodies, respectively. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated 1 h with Cy3-conjugated IgG (1:1000; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). Coverslips were washed again with PBS, mounted on slides, and analyzed on a confocal LSM410 microscope (Zeiss). Adult albino rats were anesthetized deeply with halothane and decapitated. Eyes were enucleated and opened along the ora serrata, and the posterior eyecups with the retinae attached were immersion-fixed for 15–30 min in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m PB, pH 7.4. After dissection retinae were cryoprotected in 10% (w/v), 20% (w/v) sucrose in PB for 1 h each and in 30% (w/v) sucrose in PB overnight at 4 °C. Pieces of retinae were mounted in freezing medium (Reichert-Jung, Bensheim, Germany), sectioned vertically at 12-μm thickness on a cryostat, and collected on slides. For double-labeling experiments, guinea pig anti-GABABR1 (1:1000; PharMingen) and rabbit anti-CREB2/ATF-4 antibodies (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used and visualized by red and green fluorescence secondary antibodies, goat anti-rabbit IgG, and goat anti-guinea-pig IgG (Alexa™ 594, Alexa™ 488; 1:500; Molecular Probes). Sections were examined by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (Leica DM IRBE; Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany) using a ×63 objective and special filter settings (Leica TCS SP). Using the Y2H system (35Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar), we sought to isolate candidate proteins that directly interact with and modulate the signaling function of GABAB receptors. Therefore, the complete C-terminal intracellular region of GABABR1a was initially used as bait to screen rat brain cDNA libraries. Two independent screenings of ∼2 × 107 recombinants resulted in the isolation of 27 and 180, respectively, positive clones, the open reading frames of which all encoded regions of the same polypeptide. Data base analysis indicated very high similarity to the mouse transcription factor mATF-4 (36Mielnicki L.M. Pruitt S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19 (-): 6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), also known as C/ATF (37Vallejo M. Ron D. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4679-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) or mTR67 (38Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The complete open reading frame of the rat orthologue (rATF-4) is shown in Fig. 1. rATF-4 is 347 amino acids in length and shares 94% and 86% amino acid identity with mouse ATF-4 and the human ATF-4 (hCREB2/TAXREB67; Refs. 39Karpinski B.A. Morle G.D.

Virol. 1991; 65: 1420-1426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. At the C terminus, rATF-4 harbors a conserved basic leucine zipper (bZIP) dimerization motif that binds CRE and is present in all CREB/ATF proteins. In addition, rATF-4 contains a second heptad repeat of leucines between amino acids 89 and 124 near the N terminus, and a potential phosphorylation site for mitogen-activated protein kinase (amino acid position 164). We performed control experiments (i) with bait or prey vectors missing, (ii) using empty vectors, (iii) using vectors that expressed unrelated proteins such as pRHFM1 encoding the Drosophila bicoid protein homeodomain, and (iv) using vectors that expressed other proteins harboring a bZIP domain, e.g. CREB. All these controls were negative, excluding autoactivation and corroborating the specificity of the interaction between GABABR1 and rATF-4. For a detailed mapping of the interaction domains, deletion mutants of both GABABR1 and ATF-4 were constructed and tested for complementation in the Y2H assay. These experiments showed that deletion constructs in the GABABR1 bait, removing partial sequences from the C terminus, allow binding of rATF-4 (Fig.2 A) until a leucine at amino acid position 915 (Leu-915) is removed (ΔQ914) or exchanged by a glycine (L915G) or serine (L915S) residue (data not shown in the illustration). In contrast, replacement of Gln-916 by an alanine (Q916A) did not disturb the interaction. Further restriction analysis on the 5′ end of GABABR1a assigns the region of interaction to amino acids 887–915. Interestingly, this domain has been recently mapped to likely participate in the obligate assembly of GABABR1 and GABABR2 subunits into heteromeric receptor complexes (23Kuner R. Köhr G. Grünewald S. Eisenhardt G. Bach A. Kornau H.-C. Science. 1999; 283: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 41Kammerer R.A. Frank S. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Lustig A. Engel J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13263-13269Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), suggesting a bifunctional role of this site.Figure 2GAL-4-based Y2H analysis of the interaction between GABABR1 and ATF-4. A, deletion constructs of GABABR1 (amino acid region on theleft) were used as baits for binding ATF-4 as prey. The HIS3 marker was used as reporter in the Y2H assay. B, the equivalent analysis is shown for deletion constructs of rATF-4 used as prey for binding the C terminus of GABABR1. Functional sites depicted in Fig. 1 are boxed in this schematic representation of ATF-4. C, helical wheel diagrams of the putative leucine zipper-based interface between GABABR1 and rATF-4. The view is from the N termini starting from S887 (position a in GABABR1a) and Q299 (a′ in rATF-4). Heptad positions are labeled a–g(a′–g′).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Conversely, deletion constructs in rATF-4 demonstrated that the first leucine zipper an the putative mitogen-activated protein kinase site of rATF-4 were dispensable for binding, whereas the C-terminal leucine zipper (amino acids 301–337) was required for association with GABABR1 (Fig. 2 B). When described in terms of the heptad patterns seen in a helical wheel diagram, the interaction sites between the C termini of ATF-4 and GABABR1 conform with good approximation to classic coiled-coil structures (Fig.2 C). In the bZIP domain of rATF-4, the periodic array of leucines at every seventh position likely interdigitates with that of a matching helix formed by the GABABR1 C terminus to form a zipper-like structure. It has been suggested earlier that bZIP domains not only mediate association between transcription factors prior to DNA binding (42Landschulz W.H. Hohnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar), but also form coiled-coil structures from up to four helices with various other proteins (43Hurst H.C. Protein Profile. 1994; 1: 123-168PubMed Google Scholar). Together with the array of leucines at position d in GABABR1 and d′ in ATF-4, several features are consistent with such an interaction: (i) the β-branched amino acids valine, isoleucine (and alanine) occur at the alternate hydrophobic positions a and a′; (ii) there are highly conserved breaks at these positions caused by polar asparagines; and (iii) the amino acids preceding the alternate juxtaposed hydrophobic residue and following the leucine of the next heptad are often oppositely charged in both proteins to allow electrostatic interactions (38Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Consistent with our pull-down experiments (see below), helical wheel representation of GABABR2, but not the C-terminal splice variant GABABR1d (24Isomoto S. Kaibara M. Sakurai-Yamashita Y. Nagayama Y. Uezono Y. Yano K. Taniyama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), which misses the leucine zipper, does also reveal complementarity to ATF-4 as required for stable dimerization. To verify the interaction between ATF-4 and GABABR1a by an independent assay, we evaluated binding of the respective bacterially expressed fusion proteins. In addition, we have tested the binding of C-terminal regions of GABABR2 and the unrelated synaptic protein synaptoporin (P"

Besides preformed physical and chemical barriers that prevent infection, a wide variety of defense responses is induced only after pathogen attack (1Kombrink E. Somssich I.E. Adv. Bot. Res. 1995; 21: 1-34Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 2Agrios G.N. Plant Pathology. 4th Ed. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1997: 93-114Google Scholar). When these defense responses are triggered rapidly and coordinately, the plant becomes resistant to pathogen invasion. Susceptible plants respond more slowly with their defense mechanisms after infection. Thus, the timely recognition of an invading microorganism, as well as the rapid and effective induction of the defense responses, appears to make a key difference between resistant and susceptible plants (3Yang Y. Shah J. Klessig D.F. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1621-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 4Keller H. Pamboukdjian N. Ponchet M. Poupet A. Delon R. Varrier J.L. Roby D. Ricci P.

Among the many resistance responses induced by microbial pathogen attack, hypersensitive response (HR)1 is one of the most dramatic events in plant-microbe interactions. HR is characterized by rapid and localized death of tissues at the site of microbial attack and is associated with the defense of plants against invading microorganisms (5Gabriel D.W. Rolfe B.G.

Since elicitation of the HR in a nonhost plant and virulence in a host appear to be linked, hypersensitive cell death is considered to be a hallmark of the resistance response. The initial requirement of any defense response is the perception of the pathogen by the plant (11Ebel J. Cosio E.G. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1994; 148: 1-36Crossref Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Specific recognition molecules called elicitors often play an important role in this recognition by the plant. Elicitors involve substances of diverse chemical structure such as polygalacturonides, β-glucans, chitosan, lipids, and proteins. Elicitors have been demonstrated to correlate the interactions between plants and viruses (12Culver N.J. Dawson W.O. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1991; 4: 458-463Crossref Google Scholar), bacteria (4Keller H. Pamboukdjian N. Ponchet M. Poupet A. Delon R. Varrier J.L. Roby D. Ricci P. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 13Wei Z.M. Laby R.J. Zumoff C.H. Bauer D.W. He S.Y. Collmer A. Beer S.V. Science. 1992; 257: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar), and fungi (14Panabieres F. Marais A. Le Berre J.Y. Fournier D. Ricci P. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1995; 6: 996-1003Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 15Kuchitsu K. Kikuyama M. Shibuya N. Protoplasma. 1993; 174: 79-81Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 16Ricci P. Plant-Microbe Interactions. 3. G. Chapman and Hall, New York1997: 53-75Google Scholar). Elicitors have also been categorized as general elicitors, which do not exhibit differences in cultivar sensitivity within a plant species, and specific elicitors, which function only in cultivars carrying matching disease resistance genes (17Boller T. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 189-214Crossref Scopus (424) Google Scholar). These two types of elicitors appear to trigger a common network of signaling pathways that coordinate the overall defense response. The molecular mechanisms of elicitor perception and signal transduction have been studied extensively, and some specific elicitor-binding components have been characterized (18Shibuya N. Kaku H. Kuchitsu K. Maliarik M.J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar,19Umemoto N. Kakitani M. Iwamatsu A. Yoshikawa M. Yamaoka N. Ishida I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the detailed molecular mechanisms of elicitor perception and transduction of the perception signal are not fully understood. Pseudomonas avenae (Acidovorax avenae) is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes a seedling disease characterized by the formation of brown stripes on the sheaths of infected plants (20Kadota I. Ohuchi A. Nishiyama K. Ann. Phytopathol. Soc. Jpn. 1991; 57: 268-273Crossref Google Scholar). The host range of P. avenae is wide among monocotyledonous plants including rice, oats, Italian millet, and maize; however, individual strains of the pathogen infect only one or a few host species (20Kadota I. Ohuchi A. Nishiyama K. Ann. Phytopathol. Soc. Jpn. 1991; 57: 268-273Crossref Google Scholar, 21Nishiyama K. Nishihara N. Ezuka A. Ann. Phytopathol. Soc. Jpn. 1979; 45: 25-31Crossref Google Scholar, 22Kadota I. Mizuno A. Nishiyama K. Ann. Phytopathol. Soc. Jpn. 1996; 62: 425-428Crossref Google Scholar). For example, strains isolated from rice such as H8301 (MAFF 301505) or K1 can infect only rice plant, while the N1141 (MAFF 301141) strain isolated from finger millet cannot infect rice even after being inoculated into rice tissues (20Kadota I. Ohuchi A. Nishiyama K. Ann. Phytopathol. Soc. Jpn. 1991; 57: 268-273Crossref Google Scholar, 21Nishiyama K. Nishihara N. Ezuka A. Ann. Phytopathol. Soc. Jpn. 1979; 45: 25-31Crossref Google Scholar, 23Che F.S. Iwano M. Tanaka N. Takayama S. Minami E. Shibuya N. Kadota I. Isogai A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 1036-1045Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We recently reported that the rice-incompatible strain, N1141, caused rapid cell death, while the rice-compatible strain, H8301, did not induce it (23Che F.S. Iwano M. Tanaka N. Takayama S. Minami E. Shibuya N. Kadota I. Isogai A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 1036-1045Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) showed that DNA cleavage occurred during rapid cell death induced by N1141 strain. Furthermore, the N1141 strain caused cytoplasmic condensation and shrinkage, all of which are important morphological characteristics of programmed cell death (PCD). In contrast, rice cells inoculated by the H8301 strain appeared to cause disruption of the cell wall instead of the above morphological changes associated with PCD. These results indicated that hypersensitive cell death, which is one form of PCD, was induced only in N1141-inoculated rice cells. When cultured rice cells were inoculated with the incompatible N1141 and compatible H8301 strains, several different phenomena other than induction of hypersensitive cell death were observed. The EL2 gene is known to be expressed withN-acetylchitoheptaose, which induces a set of defense reactions in cultured rice cells within 15 min (24Minami E. Kuchitsu K. He D.Y. Kouchi H. Midoh N. Ohtsuki Y. Shibuya N. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25He D.Y. Yazaki Y. Nishizawa Y. Takai R. Yamada K. Sakano K. Shibuya N. Minami E. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1998; 11: 1167-1174Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The accumulation of EL2 mRNA is detectable 3 h after inoculation with the incompatible strain, N1141, whereas in H8301-inoculated cultured cells it is not detected. From these results, we concluded that the N1141 strain causes a defense response in cultured rice cells but that the compatible strain H8301 does not (23Che F.S. Iwano M. Tanaka N. Takayama S. Minami E. Shibuya N. Kadota I. Isogai A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 1036-1045Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, the perception mechanism of the compatible or the incompatible strain by rice and the induction mechanism of the defense response caused by the incompatible strain of P. avenae remain unsolved. Because the resistance response in cultured rice cells, such as hypersensitive cell death, was only induced by the incompatible N1141 strain, we postulated that such induced resistance in rice cells is mediated by the recognition of a specific molecule produced by the incompatible strain of P. avenae. Based on this hypothesis, we undertook studies to identify such a specific elicitor molecule ofP. avenae. We report here that flagellin, which composes the flagellum filament of bacteria, is the specific elicitor molecule and that the resistance response in cultured rice cells is induced by flagellin in incompatible strain N1141 of P. avenae. P. avenaestrains H8301 (MAFF 301505) and K1 isolated from rice and strain N1141 (MAFF 301141) isolated from finger millet (22Kadota I. Mizuno A. Nishiyama K. Ann. Phytopathol. Soc. Jpn. 1996; 62: 425-428Crossref Google Scholar) were maintained on Pseudomonas F agar plates (Difco) at 30 °C (23Che F.S. Iwano M. Tanaka N. Takayama S. Minami E. Shibuya N. Kadota I. Isogai A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 1036-1045Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). N1141 and H8301 strains were cultured in liquid Pseudomonas F (Difco) on a rotary shaker for 3 days at 30 °C. Bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of 0.2 mLiCl, agitated with 710-1, 180-μm glass beads (Sigma) in flasks on a rotary shaker for 2.5 h at 45 °C, and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 30,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C to remove intact bacterial cells and other insoluble debris and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was washed with distilled water (DW) and suspended in a small amount of DW. This sample was named as cell extracts (CE). To obtain strain-specific antibody, rabbit antisera (anti-N1141 and -H8301) were cross-absorbed with whole cells of the other strain according the previously published method (22Kadota I. Mizuno A. Nishiyama K. Ann. Phytopathol. Soc. Jpn. 1996; 62: 425-428Crossref Google Scholar). IgG from cross-absorbed antisera was purified with HiTrap Protein A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (22Kadota I. Mizuno A. Nishiyama K. Ann. Phytopathol. Soc. Jpn. 1996; 62: 425-428Crossref Google Scholar). These antibodies were named as N1141 strain-specific antibody and H8301 strain-specific antibody, respectively. Each CE isolated from strains N1141 and H8301 was separated on 12.5% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gels (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) with a semidry blotter (Bio-Rad). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with skim milk for 1 h. Immunoreactive polypeptides were detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat antibody raised against rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and visualized by reaction with nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and bromochloroindonyl phosphate (Sigma). CEs isolated from N1141 and H8301 strains were separated by SDS-PAGE as above, and electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). After staining with 0.1% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad) in 50% methanol, the 50-kDa bands indicated by N1141 or H8301 strain-specific antibodies were excised. For determination of internal sequence, 50-kDa bands were eluted from SDS-polyacrylamide gel with a microelectroeluter (Centrilutor; Amicon, Beverly, MA) at 100 V for 4 h. Eluted protein was ultrafiltrated by Centricon-10 (Amicon) at 3000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. DW was added to the concentrated protein, and the resuspended sample was centrifuged to remove SDS and other impurities. This sample was digested with lysylendopeptidase or V8 protease (Wako chemical, Osaka, Japan), and the fragments were subjected to reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography on a VP-318-1251 column (46 × 250 mm; Senshukagaku, Tokyo, Japan). The column was eluted with a linear acetonitrile gradient from 20 to 80%, and the peptide fragment fractions were collected. The N-terminal sequences were determined with a pulse liquid-phase protein sequencer (model 492A; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Protein concentrations were determined using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Cells were suspended in 0.85% (w/v) NaCl and prepared essentially as described previously (27Kalmokoff M.L. Jarrell K.F. Koval S.F. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1752-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed on Formvar- and carbon-coated grids with 2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in a 0.1m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). After rinsing the grids with DW, nonspecific binding was blocked with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. The grids were transferred to diluted N1141 strain-specific antibody solution and incubated for 1.5 h. After rinsing, blocking was repeated. Grids were incubated in the secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 15-nm gold particles (Biocell Research Laboratories, Cardiff, UK) for 30 min at 37 °C and rinsed in Tris-buffered saline and DW. The grids were observed under a transmission electron microscope (H-7100; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 75 kV. For purification of flagella from P. avenae, each bacterial strain was grown for 2 days in 500 ml of Pseudomonas F at 30 °C on a rotary shaker. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C and then resuspended in 30 ml of 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl. The flagella were removed from the cells by shearing twice for 1 min in a homogenizer (Ultra F Homogenizer HF-93F; TAITEC, Saitama, Japan). Cells and cell debris were removed by two-step centrifugation at 6000 ×g for 25 min and 16,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were amended with kanamycin (100 μg/ml) and placed at 25 °C overnight to kill contaminating bacteria. Flagella were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, washed three times with DW to remove kanamycin. Suspension cultures of rice cells, line Oc (28Baba A. Hasezawa S. Syono K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1986; 27: 463-472Google Scholar), were grown at 30 °C under light irradiation (28Baba A. Hasezawa S. Syono K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1986; 27: 463-472Google Scholar). The assay for cell death was performed as described previously (23Che F.S. Iwano M. Tanaka N. Takayama S. Minami E. Shibuya N. Kadota I. Isogai A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 1036-1045Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Turner J.G. Novacky A. Phytopathology. 1974; 64: 885-890Crossref Google Scholar). Cultured rice cells were incubated with each flagellin fraction isolated from strains N1141 and H8301 as for the cell death assay. Cultured rice cells were ground in liquid nitrogen, and total RNA was extracted with aurintricarbosylic acid (30Gonzalez R.G. Haxo R.S. Schleich T. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4299-4303Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). RNAs (15 μg) were electrophoresed on a formaldehyde denaturing 1% (w/v) agarose gel in 1× MOPS buffer (20 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.0, 5 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA) and blotted onto Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), according to standard protocols. A full-length cDNA fragment of theEL2 gene (24Minami E. Kuchitsu K. He D.Y. Kouchi H. Midoh N. Ohtsuki Y. Shibuya N. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was labeled with [32P]dCTP and used as a hybridization probe. DNA was isolated from strains N1141 and H8301 using a previously described protocol (31Wilson K Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). For polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to isolate the flagellin genes, one set of oligonucleotide primers was synthesized on the basis of the partial amino acid sequences of purified flagellin. The sequences of the first primer set were 5′-GCCATCCAGGCNGARGTNGG-3′ (FL25-N), which corresponded to the probable N-terminal region sequence AIQAEVGQ and 5′-CCTGCCTGCTGNAGRATYTG-3′ (FV10-C), which corresponded to the probable C-terminal region sequence QILQQAG. Taq-DNA polymerase and buffer (Expand High Fidelity PCR system) were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and used for all PCR experiments. After the DNA had been incubated at 96 °C for 5 min, the flagellin gene was amplified with 30 cycles of 1 min of denaturation at 98 °C, 30 s of annealing at 55 °C, and a 2 min of extension at 72 °C. PCRs were terminated with a 10-min incubation at 72 °C. PCR fragments were cloned using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and 10 clones from each PCR were sequenced with a DNA sequencer (model 377; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). These PCR and cloning procedures were independently repeated twice, and the partial DNA sequences of flagellin were carefully confirmed. The 5′- and 3′-ends of the flagellin genes of strains N1141 and H8301 were amplified using the Takara LA PCR in vitro cloning kit (Takara, Kyoto, Japan) and HindIII cassette according to the standard protocol. Primary 5′-end PCR was performed using cassette primer C1 (5′-GTACATATTGTCGTTAGAACGCGTAATACGACTCA-3′) and specific primer I (5′-CGTCAGCTGGGCACCATAGTTGTTGGTACGGAAGT-3′) with the recommended PCR conditions. After the first PCR, the product was diluted 2000-fold and reamplified using cassette primer C2 (5′-CGTTAGAACGCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGA-3′) and specific primer II (5′-CGTTAGAACGCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGA). For 3′-end sequence analysis, primary PCR was performed using cassette primer C1 and specific primer III (5′-CTGAGCCTGAGCCAGTCGTCGCTCAACACCTCCAT-3′), and secondary PCR was performed using cassette primer C2 and specific primer IV (5′-AACGCCACCAACTCCTCCGGTGACCGGAAGGCCAT-3′). The amplified fragments for 3′-end PCR (0.5 kbp) and for 5′-end PCR (1.2 kbp) were cloned with a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), and 10 independent clones from each PCR were sequenced as described above. These PCR and cloning procedures were independently repeated twice, and DNA inserts were sequenced on both strands to ensure that no mutation had been introduced during amplification. The flagellin (5 mg) fraction from N1141 cells was used to immunize rabbits. Full-length N1141 flagellin DNA was cloned in-frame in the pGEX-3X vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting GST fusion protein was overproduced in the BL21 (DE3) strain of Escherichia coli (Invitrogen) and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The anti-N1141 flagellin antibody was purified by affinity chromatography using a HiTrapN-hydroxysuccimimide-activated Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) immobilizing the recombinant GST-fused N1141 flagellin. To make a flagellin-deficient mutant of P. avenae strains N1141 and K1, insertion mutants were constructed. pBluescript SK(−) (Stratagene, Victoria, Canada) was cleaved with DraI to remove the ampicillin resistance gene. A 1.4-kbpEcoRI–AvaI fragment containing the tetracycline resistance gene from pBR322 (32Soberon X. Gene ( Amst. ). 1977; 2: 95-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3527) Google Scholar) was ligated into the cleaved pBluescript SK(−), generating the plasmid pYN501. Mismatched cohesive termini were blunted before ligation. An internal region of the flagellin genes from N1141 and K1 (nucleotides 62–1097) was amplified by PCR with oligonucleotide primers 5′-AGTCGTCGCTCAACACCTCCAT-3′ and 5′-TCGGACTTGTATTCCACCGT-3′. Each amplified fragment was cloned into pGEM-TEasy (Promega) and then excised by restriction withApaI and SpeI and ligated to theApaI–SpeI site of pYN501. The resulting plasmids pYN107 (containing internal flagellin fragment of N1141) and pYN108 (containing internal flagellin fragment of K1) were electrotransformed into N1141 and K1 cells, and transformants were selected on LB plates supplemented with 20 μg/ml tetracycline and 25 μg/ml ampicillin at 30 °C for 2 days. Integration of the construct into the chromosomes of strains N1141 and K1 were confirmed by PCR analysis followed by sequencing of the PCR production to verify the correct junctions between the interrupted gene and vector. Viable cells can exclude Evans blue dye, but dead cells cannot because of a loss of function of the plasma membrane. Therefore, it can be used to monitor cell death. We first examined whether cell death was induced by CE from P. avenae. After an 8-h co-incubation of exponentially growing cultured rice cells with both N1141 and H8301 CE, cell death in cultured rice cells as detected by Evans blue staining was found to be induced by N1141 CE at the lowest tested dose (10 μl/ml) (Fig. 1). In contrast, 10 μl/ml CE isolated from compatible H8301 cells caused no host cell death and only minimal cell death in comparison with N1141 CE at higher doses (100 and 1000 μl/ml) (Fig. 1). Such specificity of cell death induction in cultured rice cells corresponded to the cell death pattern induced by living bacteria of the N1141 strain (23Che F.S. Iwano M. Tanaka N. Takayama S. Minami E. Shibuya N. Kadota I. Isogai A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 1036-1045Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar), suggesting that cell death induced by N1141 CE was a hypersensitive cell death and that elicitors or elicitor-like substance(s) were present in the N1141 CE but absent from H8301 CE. The cell death induction activity of N1141 CE was inactivated by treatment with trypsin and Proteinase K (data not shown), indicating that the predicted elicitor-like substance(s) in N1141 CE is a protein. The above experiments suggested that the proteinaceous molecule in N1141 CE that elicits hypersensitive cell death is absent from H8301 CE or that there are significant structural differences between some components of N1141 and H8301 CE. To identify which protein(s) in CE are involved, we performed Western blot analysis using two strain-specific antibodies (N1141 strain-specific antibody and H8301 strain-specific antibody; see “Experimental Procedures”). The protein band pattern in CEs visualized with silver staining showed close correlation between strains H8301 and N1141 (Fig.2 A). However, when the blotted membrane was stained with the N1141 strain-specific antibody, a single band of the 50-kDa protein was detected in N1141 CE, and no significant bands were observed in H8301 CE (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, H8301 strain-specific antibody stained a 50-kDa band only in H8301 CE (Fig. 2 A). To obtain N-terminal sequence information of these 50-kDa proteins, the Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250-stained bands corresponding to the 50-kDa proteins were excised from polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and subjected to N-terminal sequencing. The N-terminal sequence was the same for each 50-kDa band, ASTINTNVSSLTAQRNLSLSQSSL, and was highly homologous to the N-terminal amino acid sequences of flagellin that compose a flagellar filament from the Gram-negative bacteria P. aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, and E. coli (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, the internal sequences of peptide fragments obtained by digestion of the H8301 50-kDa protein using lysylendopeptidase and V8 protease (the underlined sequence in Fig. 5 A) also showed high similarity to flagellin from other bacteria (data not shown). To confirm that the 50-kDa protein is P. avenae flagellin, immunogold electron microscopic analysis was performed using N1141 strain-specific antibody. When bacterial cells of strain N1141 were incubated with N1141 strain-specific antibody and gold-conjugated anti-rabbit antiserum, many gold particles were found on the flagellum filament of N1141 strain (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, no gold particles were found on the flagellum filament of strain H8301 (Fig. 2 C). All other control tests, including the omission of primary antibody, yielded negative results (data not shown). These results clearly show that the N1141 strain-specific antibody can recognize N1141 flagellin but not H8301 flagellin and that structural differences exist between N1141 and H8301 flagellins. The experiments using N1141 or H8301 strain-specific antibodies suggested that flagellin is a major bacterial substance with a different structure in strains H8301 and N1141. Therefore, we assumed that flagellin is a candidate for a cell death-inducing specific substance. To clarify this point, the triggering of cell death was studied using flagellin purified from strains N1141 and H8301. The crude flagellin fractions were prepared from both strains by several centrifugation steps. SDS-PAGE analysis of the crude N1141 and H8301 flagellin fractions showed that the main component in these fractions is a 50-kDa protein, which is identified as flagellin. When the N1141 flagellin fraction was added to cultured rice cells, cell death was detected at concentrations greater than 0.1 μm (Fig.3 A), while the cell death induction activity of the H8301 flagellin fractions was much lower than that of the N1141 flagellin fraction (Fig. 3 A). At a concentration of 1 μm, the N1141 flagellin fraction induced cell death within 6 h of treatment, whereas the H8301 flagellin fraction did not cause detectable cell death until 8 h after incubation (Fig. 3 B). To eliminate the possibility that a contaminating protein in the N1141 flagellin fraction could act as an elicitor, flagellin proteins were further purified with preparative electrophoresis. The purified N1141 flagellin (0.1 μm) also caused the cell death of cultured rice cells within 12 h of treatment, whereas the rate of cell death from purified H8301 flagellin was significantly lower than that from N1141 flagellin (data not shown). These data suggest that the flagellin of the incompatible N1141 strain induced hypersensitive cell death in cultured rice cells and that the cultured rice cells have a perception system that can recognize the structural difference between N1141 and H8301 flagellins. To determine the sequence of genomic DNA encoding flagellin in P. avenae, one set of mixed primers (FL25-N and FV 10-C) was synthesized based on the internal amino acid sequences of fragment peptides obtained from digestion using lysylendopeptidase and V8 protease (Fig. 4 A). PCR amplification of DNA from strains N1141 and H8301 using the primers produced products of 1088 bp. The nucleotide sequence of two DNA clones had high homology with other bacterial flagellins (data not shown), suggesting that these clones encode portions of P. avenaeflagellin.

https://openalex.org/W1982298394,"Many signal transduction pathways are mediated by the second messengers cGMP and cAMP, cGMP- and cAMP-dependent protein kinases (cGK and PKA), phosphodiesterases, and ion channels. To distinguish among the different cGMP effectors, inhibitors of cGK and PKA have been developed including the K-252 compound KT5823 and the isoquinolinesulfonamide H89. KT5823, an in vitro inhibitor of cGK, has also been used in numerous studies with intact cells to implicate or rule out the involvement of this protein kinase in a given cellular response. However, the efficacy and specificity of KT5823 as cGK inhibitor in intact cells or tissues have never been demonstrated. Here, we analyzed the effects of both KT5823 and H89 on cyclic-nucleotide-mediated phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) in intact human platelets and rat mesangial cells. These two cell types both express high levels of cGK. KT5823 inhibited purified cGK. However, with both intact human platelets and rat mesangial cells, KT5823 failed to inhibit cGK-mediated serine 157 and serine 239 phosphorylation of VASP induced by nitric oxide, atrial natriuretic peptide, or the membrane-permeant cGMP analog, 8-pCPT-cGMP. KT5823 enhanced 8-pCPT-cGMP-stimulated VASP phosphorylation in platelets and did not inhibit forskolin-stimulated VASP phosphorylation in either platelets or mesangial cells. In contrast H89, an inhibitor of both PKA and cGK, clearly inhibited 8-pCPT-cGMP and forskolin-stimulated VASP phosphorylation in the two cell types. The data indicate that KT5823 inhibits purified cGK but does not affect a cGK-mediated response in the two different cell types expressing cGK I. These observations indicate that data that interpret the effects of KT5823 in intact cells as the major or only criteria supporting the involvement of cGK clearly need to be reconsidered. Many signal transduction pathways are mediated by the second messengers cGMP and cAMP, cGMP- and cAMP-dependent protein kinases (cGK and PKA), phosphodiesterases, and ion channels. To distinguish among the different cGMP effectors, inhibitors of cGK and PKA have been developed including the K-252 compound KT5823 and the isoquinolinesulfonamide H89. KT5823, an in vitro inhibitor of cGK, has also been used in numerous studies with intact cells to implicate or rule out the involvement of this protein kinase in a given cellular response. However, the efficacy and specificity of KT5823 as cGK inhibitor in intact cells or tissues have never been demonstrated. Here, we analyzed the effects of both KT5823 and H89 on cyclic-nucleotide-mediated phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) in intact human platelets and rat mesangial cells. These two cell types both express high levels of cGK. KT5823 inhibited purified cGK. However, with both intact human platelets and rat mesangial cells, KT5823 failed to inhibit cGK-mediated serine 157 and serine 239 phosphorylation of VASP induced by nitric oxide, atrial natriuretic peptide, or the membrane-permeant cGMP analog, 8-pCPT-cGMP. KT5823 enhanced 8-pCPT-cGMP-stimulated VASP phosphorylation in platelets and did not inhibit forskolin-stimulated VASP phosphorylation in either platelets or mesangial cells. In contrast H89, an inhibitor of both PKA and cGK, clearly inhibited 8-pCPT-cGMP and forskolin-stimulated VASP phosphorylation in the two cell types. The data indicate that KT5823 inhibits purified cGK but does not affect a cGK-mediated response in the two different cell types expressing cGK I. These observations indicate that data that interpret the effects of KT5823 in intact cells as the major or only criteria supporting the involvement of cGK clearly need to be reconsidered. cGMP-dependent protein kinase vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein atrial natriuretic peptide mesangial cells cAMP-dependent protein kinase sodium nitroprusside phosphorylated VASP VASP phosphorylated at serine 157 VASP phosphorylated at serine 239 mitogen-activated protein kinase Nitric oxide and cGMP have emerged as important signal transduction mediators of the effects of certain hormones, inter- and intracellular signals, toxins, and drugs (1Walter U.

Intracellular cGMP levels may be increased upon binding of natriuretic peptides to their cognate transmembrane receptors (particulate guanylate cyclases) or indirectly via generation and release of nitric oxide that activates soluble guanylate cyclase (4Foster D.C.

Increased cGMP may modulate cGMP-dependent protein kinases, cGMP-stimulated or -inhibited phosphodiesterases, cGMP-gated ion channels, and under certain conditions cAMP-dependent protein kinases (2Lincoln T.M.

Sci. 1997; 22: 307-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar).To distinguish among these effectors of cGMP in a given cell type, especially to define which of the physiological effects of cGMP-elevating agents are dependent on cGK, several criteria must be fulfilled. These include agonist-induced up-regulation of cGMP, positive expression of at least one of the cGK-isoforms (endogenously or upon microinjection or transfection), specific activation or inhibition by cGK-specific agonists/antagonists, and lack of this activation or inhibition in corresponding cGK-deficient systems (7Smolenski A.

Unfortunately, there are only a few examples that have met all these criteria. Knockout mice lacking endogenous cGK I displayed defective cGMP-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation and of vascular smooth muscle cell contraction (6Pfeifer A. Ruth P. Dostmann W. Sausbier M.

In platelets, cGK-activation has been shown to induce the phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) and to inhibit agonist-evoked calcium transients and activation of platelets (3Lohmann S.M.

VASP is phosphorylated preferentially at Ser239 by cGK whereas upon PKA activation Ser157-VASP is preferentially phosphorylated. However, at very high levels of cyclic nucleotides or their analogs, both phosphorylation sites may be phosphorylated by either protein kinase (15Butt E. Abel K. Krieger M. Palm D. Hoppe V. Hoppe J.

In contrast, cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of VASP is mediated by PKA. In vascular smooth muscle cells, cGK I is thought to counteract the increase in contraction provoked by Ca2+-mobilizing agonists and to inhibit growth factor-induced cell proliferation (20Cornwell T.L.

To inhibit cGK activation, two major groups of drugs have been developed; Rp-stereoisomers of cGMP-phosphorothioates and isoquinolinesulfonamide derivatives, protein kinase inhibitors of the so-called H-series. The cGMP analogs prevent activation of cGK at the cGMP binding site of the regulatory domain (7Smolenski A. Burkhardt A.M. Eigenthaler M. Butt E. Gambaryan S. Lohmann S.M. Walter U.

In vitro, inhibitory constants (K i) of 234 nm (cGK I) and >10 μm (PKA) were determined for KT5823; and for H89, these values are 480 nm (cGK) and 48 nm (PKA) (28Hidaka H. Kobayashi R. Annu. Rev.

Several inexplicable and partially contradicting conclusions have been reported with KT5823 suggesting that this compound may lack specificity for cGK or may even completely fail to inhibit cGK in several intact cell systems. Previously, both activation of and failure to inhibit cGK in neutrophils were demonstrated as well as lack of cGK-specificity in inhibiting inositol triphosphate receptor phosphorylation (42Komalavilas P. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21933-21938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 43Wyatt T.A. Pryzwansky K.B. Lincoln T.M. Res. Commun. Chem. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1991; 74: 3-14PubMed Google Scholar).To investigate whether KT5823 inhibits cGK activation not only in broken cell systems but also in intact cells, we determined cGK agonist-induced phosphorylation of VASP in both human platelets and rat mesangial cells, both expressing high levels of cGK I (9Eigenthaler M. Nolte C. Halbrugge M. Walter U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 44Joyce N.C. DeCamilli P. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Protein Phosphor. Res. 1986; 11: 191-198PubMed Google Scholar). Upon preincubation with KT5823, cGK-mediated phosphorylation of VASP (upon stimulation with SNP, ANP, and 8-pCPT-cGMP) was not inhibited in these cell types but was even further enhanced. Further, activation of PKA by forskolin was also not inhibited in the presence of KT5823 even at high concentrations of inhibitor.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have demonstrated cGK- and PKA-mediated VASP phosphorylation at Ser239 and Ser157 in human platelets and rat mesangial cells. KT5823 did not inhibit and even enhanced cGMP/cGK-mediated VASP phosphorylation. We conclude that KT5823 does not inhibit cGK in two intact cell systems, human platelets and rat mesangial cells, which both express high levels of cGK I.Specific inhibitors of protein kinases are invaluable tools for evaluating physiological and pharmacological cell functions as has been emphasized with respect to cAK inhibitor peptides and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs/ERKs) or stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs, Ref. 54Cohen D.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1997; 117: 291-299Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, no inhibitors of cGK with comparable specificity and activity have been available. To date, an increasing number of reports include KT5823 as a tool to define cGK involvement in intracellular signaling processes. Of a total of more than 160 citations found in the public medical literature databases, more than 95% have used KT5823 in intact cell systems, and frequently involvement of cGK in signaling processes was concluded solely by showing inhibition of these pathways by KT5823. However, although KT5823 inhibited cGK-induced activation in cell-free systems, it did not inhibit and even enhanced cGMP/cGK-mediated phosphorylation of VASP in both intact platelets and rat mesangial cells.The reasons for the failure of KT5823 to inhibit cGK in intact cells may arise from the following: (i) failure to access cGK in intact cells because of compartmentalization of the drug; (ii) effects of KT5823 on enzymes other than those that were investigated resulting in counteracting effects; (iii) longer incubation times (in comparison to broken cell systems) that are necessary to enable diffusion/transport of KT5823 through the cellular membrane; (iv) accumulation of KT5823 within cells resulting in much higher intracellular concentrations than was added to the medium because of the hydrophobicity of the compound; and (v) generation of metabolites of KT5823 (perhaps by P450 oxidases) with differing substrate specificities and perhaps cGK-activating functions that might depend on intact membrane structures.The mechanism of the effects seen with KT5823 is not known though similar inexplicable results have been reported before. KT5823 was shown to induce cellular shape changes in human neutrophils without inhibitory effects on cGK-dependent phosphorylation of vimentin (31Komalavilas P. Shah P.K. Jo H. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 21274-21280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas dibutyryl cGMP-induced activation of p38 MAPK was inhibited by either KT5823 or H89 (56Browning D.D. Windes N.D. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 537-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Others reported inhibition of endothelin- or carbon monoxide-induced neutrophil migration by KT5823 (33Elferink J.G. de Koster B.M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 350: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 57VanUffelen B.E. de Koster B.M. VanSteveninck J. Elferink J.G. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 226: 21-26Google Scholar). In the proximal tubule of rat kidneys, KT5823 not only failed to inhibit ANP- and 8-Br-cGMP-induced Cl− channel activation but acted stimulatory by itself (35Darvish N. Winaver J. Dagan D. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F323-F329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further, KT5823 failed to abolish inhibitory effects of ANP and 8-Br-cGMP on a Ca2+-activated K+ ion channel in kidney cells (36Hirsch J.R. Weber G. Kleta I. Schlatter E. J. Physiol. (Lond. ). 1999; 519: 645-655Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), whereas the same group reported inhibition of cGMP/ATP-activated K+ channels in the basolateral membrane of rat collecting duct by KT5823 (37Hirsch J. Schlatter E. Pflugers Arch. 1995; 429: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In cGK-transfected 293 cells (derived from human embryonic kidney) cGMP-stimulated Ca2+-activated K+(BKCa) channels were inhibited by KT5823 (38Fukao M. Mason H.S. Britton F.C. Kenyon J.L. Horowitz B. Keef K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10927-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and evidence for cGK involvement was provided by showing cGK-specific phosphorylation of BKCaprotein in vitro. Interestingly, whereas sodium nitroprusside-induced channel activity was inhibited by KT5823, a potentiating effect of KT5823 was observed upon stimulation with another nitric oxide donor, DETA/NO making it unlikely that cGK was directly affected by KT5823. Similarily, interferon γ- or plasmin-induced monocyte/macrophage motility, which was mediated by increased nitric oxide release that led to increased cGMP concentrations, was inhibited by KT5823 (34Fukushima T. Sekizawa K. Jin Y. Sasaki H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 10: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 58Syrovets T. Tippler B. Rieks M. Simmet T. Blood. 1997; 89: 4574-4583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but cGK activation was not directly investigated. Inhibition of cGMP-stimulated cell proliferation by KT5823 as well as by Rp-8-pCPT-cGMP was shown in sensory neuron precursor cells as well as in PC12 cells transfected with adenoviral cGK I encoding vectors (32Firestein B.L. Bredt D.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1846-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of cGK rendered rabbit pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells sensitive to inhibition of proliferation and sensitized to NO/cGMP-induced apoptosis, which could be inhibited by KT5823 (30Chiche J.D. Schlutsmeyer S.M. Bloch D.B. de la Monte S.M. Roberts Jr., J.D. Filippov G. Janssens S.P. Rosenzweig A. Bloch K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34263-34271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).In some studies, modulatory effects of cGMP-increasing substances were thought to be mediated via cGK because KT5823 abolished the effects even though cGK expression was not shown and was not observed by other investigators in these cell types. In a recent report for instance, 8-Br-cGMP-induced activation of cardiac l-type Ca2+-channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes was shown to be inhibited by KT5823 (59Jiang L.H. Gawler D.J. Hodson N. Milligan C.J. Pearson H.A. Porter V. Wray D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6135-6143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); however, expression of endogenous cGK in this system was not found by other investigators (60Alioua A. Tanaka Y. Wallner M. Hofmann F. Ruth P. Meera P. Toro L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32950-32956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).Clearly, the use of an inhibitor alone is not sufficient to prove the involvement of particular enzymes like cGK in signaling processes, and data obtained from in vitro experiments cannot prove specificity and efficacy of inhibitors in intact cells. The fact that in both platelets and mesangial cells, KT5823 not only failed to show any inhibitory effect on cGK activation but even enhanced cGK-induced VASP phosphorylation underlines this assumption. Although several processes that may be associated with cGK-activation were abolished upon pretreating cells with KT5823, other processes were not affected or were even further increased. Clearly, the majority of published studies that used KT5823 to prove cGK-dependent effects should be reevaluated considering these new aspects.No perfect inhibitor of cGK has been developed that would be generally applicable for intact cells. The usefulness of membrane-permeable stereoisomers of cGMP analogs such as the Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS may be restricted to some intact cells whereas in others, because of altered membrane and perhaps abundant lipophilic vesicles, they may not work. Because of uncertainties in appropriately adjusting effective intracellular concentrations that would not affect other enzymes such as PKA, as well as inhibitors that compete either for ATP binding or for cGMP binding, it seems generally unlikely that such classes of inhibitors could fulfill the requirements of the “magic bullet” to selectively inhibit cGK.In conclusion, although under well defined conditions and complementary to other assays some of the currently available cGK inhibitors might be useful, at present there is no perfect cGK inhibitor available that would be highly specific and generally applicable. The worst among these inhibitors is KT5823 because this compound completely lacks any cGK-inhibitory effect in intact cells. If KT5823 is used in future investigations with intact cells, data demonstrating selective inhibition of cGK in these systems are required. The development of a new class of cGK-specifc inhibitors that would overcome the current problems would therefore be highly desirable both to avoid future misinterpretations of signaling pathways as well as to develop new drugs that might be useful to study the action of vasodilators and/or modulators of coagulation. Nitric oxide and cGMP have emerged as important signal transduction mediators of the effects of certain hormones, inter- and intracellular signals, toxins, and drugs (1Walter U. Rev. Physiol.

Intracellular cGMP levels may be increased upon binding of natriuretic peptides to their cognate transmembrane receptors (particulate guanylate cyclases) or indirectly via generation and release of nitric oxide that activates soluble guanylate cyclase (4Foster D.C.

Increased cGMP may modulate cGMP-dependent protein kinases, cGMP-stimulated or -inhibited phosphodiesterases, cGMP-gated ion channels, and under certain conditions cAMP-dependent protein kinases (2Lincoln T.M.

To distinguish among these effectors of cGMP in a given cell type, especially to define which of the physiological effects of cGMP-elevating agents are dependent on cGK, several criteria must be fulfilled. These include agonist-induced up-regulation of cGMP, positive expression of at least one of the cGK-isoforms (endogenously or upon microinjection or transfection), specific activation or inhibition by cGK-specific agonists/antagonists, and lack of this activation or inhibition in corresponding cGK-deficient systems (7Smolenski A.

Unfortunately, there are only a few examples that have met all these criteria. Knockout mice lacking endogenous cGK I displayed defective cGMP-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation and of vascular smooth muscle cell contraction (6Pfeifer A. Ruth P. Dostmann W. Sausbier M.

M., and Schnier, J. B., unpublished data). Kinetic experiments reported here show that flavopiridol inhibits GPb with an IC50 = 15.5 μm. The inhibition is synergistic with glucose resulting in a reduction of IC50for flavopiridol to 2.3 μm and mimics the inhibition of caffeine. In order to elucidate the structural basis of inhibition, we determined the structures of GPb complexed with flavopiridol, GPb complexed with caffeine, and GPa complexed with both glucose and flavopiridol at 1.76-, 2.30-, and 2.23-Å resolution, and refined to crystallographic R values of 0.216 (Rfree = 0.247), 0.189 (Rfree = 0.219), and 0.195 (Rfree = 0.252), respectively. The structures provide a rational for flavopiridol potency and synergism with glucose inhibitory action. Flavopiridol binds at the allosteric inhibitor site, situated at the entrance to the catalytic site, the site where caffeine binds. Flavopiridol intercalates between the two aromatic rings of Phe285 and Tyr613. Both flavopiridol and glucose promote the less active T-state through localization of the closed position of the 280s loop which blocks access to the catalytic site, thereby explaining their synergistic inhibition. The mode of interactions of flavopiridol with GP is different from that ofdes-chloro-flavopiridol with CDK2, illustrating how different functional parts of the inhibitor can be used to provide specific and potent binding to two different enzymes.

Recently, it was found that flavopiridol significantly inhibited both rabbit muscle glycogen phosphorylase b (GPb) (IC50 = 1 μm) and glycogen phosphorylasea (GPa) (IC50 = 2.5 μm), but AMP activated GPa was poorly inhibited by flavopiridol. 2A.

These findings raise the possibility that this antitumor drug may also interfere with glucose homeostasis in addition to the effects on the cell cycle through CDK inhibition. GP (EC 2.4.1.1), a key enzyme in the regulation of glycogen metabolism, catalyzes the degradative phosphorolysis of glycogen to glucose 1-phosphate (glucose-1-P). In muscle, glucose-1-P is utilized via glycolysis to generate metabolic energy, but in the liver it is mostly converted to glucose, which is the output for the benefit of other tissues (12Newgard C.B. Hwang P.K. Fletterick R.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1989; 24: 69-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The enzyme exists in two interconvertible forms: the dephosphorylated form, GPb (low activity, low substrate affinity), and the Ser14-phosphorylated form, GPa (high activity, high substrate affinity). Allosteric activators, such as AMP or inhibitors such as ATP, glucose-6-P, glucose, and caffeine can alter the equilibrium between a less active T state and a more active R state orvice versa. The structures of T and R state GP have been characterized (13Johnson L.N. Hajdu J. Acharya K.R. Stuart D.I. McLaughlin P.J. Oikonomakos N.G. Barford D. Herve G. Allosteric Enzymes.

GP contains at least 6 potential regulatory sites: the Ser14-phosphate recognition site, the allosteric site that binds AMP, IMP, ATP, and glucose-6-P, the catalytic site that binds the substrates glycogen and glucose-1-P, and also glucose and glucose analogues, the inhibitor site, which binds caffeine and related compounds, the glycogen storage site, and a new allosteric inhibitor site situated at the dimer interface which binds the potential antidiabetic drug CP320626 (24Oikonomakos N.G.

In order to provide a stereochemical explanation for flavopiridol inhibition of glycogen phosphorylase, we have co-crystallized GPb with flavopiridol, and GPa with both glucose and flavopiridol and determined the structures of the complexes by x-ray crystallographic methods at 1.76- and 2.23-Å resolution, respectively. The structural results show that flavopiridol binds at the inhibitor site, the site where caffeine binds, located 10 Å from the catalytic site. In order to compare the flavopiridol-binding site with the caffeine-binding site we determined the structure of GPb complexed with caffeine at 2.30-Å resolution. The detailed interactions of flavopiridol with the protein provide a structural explanation for understanding the molecular basis of its high affinity for GP and show that flavopiridol is an inhibitor that stabilizes the T state conformation as do caffeine and glucose. We also demonstrate through kinetic studies a strong synergistic inhibition of GPb by the pair flavopiridol/glucose. GPb was isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle according to Fischer and Krebs (25Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Methods Enzymol. 1962; 5: 369-373Crossref Scopus (298) Google Scholar) using 2-mercaptoethanol instead ofl-cysteine and recrystallized at least four times. GPa was prepared and recrystallized as described (23Oikonomakos N.G. Tsitsanou K.E. Zographos S.E. Skamnaki V.T. Goldmann S. Bischoff H.

Glycogen was freed of AMP by the method of Helmreich and Cori (27Helmreich E.J.M. Cori C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 51: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar).

The enzyme was preincubated with glycogen for 15 min at 30 °C before the reaction was started by adding glucose-1-P. Inorganic phosphate released in the reaction was measured and initial velocities were calculated from the pseudo-first order reaction constants as previously (20Oikonomakos N.G. Kontou M.

The GPb-flavopiridol crystals were transferred to a fresh buffer solution (3 mm DTT, 10 mm Bes, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.3 mm flavopiridol, pH 6.7) just before room temperature data collection. The GPa-glucose-flavopiridol crystals were transferred to a fresh buffer solution (3 mm DTT, 10 mm Bes, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mmglucose, 0.3 mm flavopiridol, 0.02% sodium azide, pH 6.7) containing 30% (v/v) glycerol for 15–30 s prior to mounting in a loop, and flash frozen with nitrogen gas at 100 K. Data for GPb-flavopiridol complex were collected from a single crystal, on an image plate on the beamline X31 at Hamburg (λ= 1.05 Å), at a maximum resolution of 1.76 Å followed by data collection at a lower resolution (3.05 Å) to measure the strong low angle reflections. Data for GPa-glucose-flavopiridol complex were collected from a single crystal at a resolution of 2.23 Å on the same beamline station. Data for GPb-caffeine-IMP complex were collected at a resolution of 2.30 Å from a single native GPb crystal soaked in a solution containing 5 mm caffeine, 10 mm Bes, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 6.7, for 80 min, on an Image Plate RAXIS IV mounted on a Rigaku Ru-H3RHB generator with a belt drive rotating anode (λ= 1.5418 Å), at the National Center for Scientific Research “Demokritos” at Athens. Crystal orientation and integration of reflections were performed using DENZO (29Otwinowski Z. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend: Data Collection and Processing.

Inter-frame scaling, partial reflection summation, data reduction, and post-refinement were all completed using SCALEPACK (29Otwinowski Z.

All data between 29.5 and 1.76 Å were included with no ς cut-off. The starting protein structure was the refined model of the room temperature GPb-glucose complex (31Martin J.L. Withers S.G.

A model of flavopiridol generated using the program SYBYL (SYBYL Molecular Modelling Software, Tripos Associates Inc., T.A. St. Louis, 1992) was fitted to the electron density map after small adjustments of the torsion angles of the computed model. Map interpretation was performed using the program O (33Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). Several side chains of the enzyme model were adjusted; water molecules were added to the atomic model and retained only if they met stereochemical requirements by using WATERPICK (in X-PLOR). The final model was refined by the conventional positional and restrained individual B-factor refinement protocol in X-PLOR to give a final R factor value of 21.6% (R free = 24.7%). The structure contained residues 13–251, 259–314, 324–837, and 331 water molecules. There is no electron density for the following residues: 252–258, 315–323, and 838–842. These residues are frequently disordered in GPb structure. A Luzatti plot (34Luzatti V.

Residues where overall <B> factors values (given in parentheses) exceed 60 Å2 include 16–22 (71.1 Å2), 550–556 (69.4 Å2), and 837–838 (75.9 Å2). The structure of GPb in complex with the inhibitor caffeine and the weak activator IMP was solved by difference Fourier methods, starting from the GPb-glucose complex (31Martin J.L. Withers S.G.

World Scientific, Singapore, New Jersey, London, Hong Kong1991Google Scholar) (code 2GPB), T state GPb-glucose complex (31Martin J.L. Withers S.G. Johnson L.N. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10745-10757Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) (code 2GPB), and 100 K GPa-glucose complex (23Oikonomakos N.G. Tsitsanou K.E. Zographos S.E. Skamnaki V.T. Goldmann S. Bischoff H. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1930-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (code 2GPA). Coordinates for T state GPb-flavopiridol, GPb-caffeine-IMP, and 100 K GPa-glucose-flavopiridol complexes have been deposited with the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank (codes 1C8K, 1GFZ, and 1E1Y, respectively). Kinetic experiments with GPb showed that flavopiridol is an inhibitor of the enzyme with an IC50 = 15.5 ± 0.3 μm, measured in the direction of glycogen synthesis, and in the presence of saturating concentrations of glucose-1-P (10 mm), glycogen (1%) and AMP (1 mm), at 30 °C (Fig. 2 A). The IC50 value for glucose was calculated to be 19.7 ± 1.3 mm. Kaiser et al. 2 found an IC50 = 1 μm for flavopiridol inhibition of rabbit muscle GPb, when tested in the direction of glycogen breakdown, in the presence of 0.8 mm AMP, 20 mm phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.1% glycogen, and 25 °C. This difference may well be a consequence of the reaction being measured in the opposite direction of catalysis and the different substrate concentrations used. To investigate the interaction between flavopiridol and glucose binding to GPb, initial velocity studies were carried out by varying flavopiridol and glucose concentrations at fixed concentrations of the substrates glucose-1-P (10 mm) and glycogen (1%). The IC50 values for flavopiridol inhibition of the enzyme were 10.9, 6.5, 4.3, and 2.3 μm, in the presence of 2, 4, 6, and 10 mm glucose, respectively. The kinetic data indicate that flavopiridol inhibition of GPb is synergistic with glucose, suggesting that both flavopiridol and glucose are able to bind to the enzyme at the same time (39Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. Wiley Interscience, New York1975: 465-504Google Scholar). The effect of varying glucose concentration on the IC50 value for flavopiridol is shown in Fig. 2 B. At 10 mm glucose concentration, the relative IC50 value for flavopiridol was decreased by more than 5-fold. Caffeine, a T state inhibitor of the enzyme (with a K i value of 0.1–0.2 mm) is also known to function with glucose in a synergistic mode, with each compound promoting the binding of the other (with an interaction constant α = 0.2) (40Kasvinsky P.J. Shechosky S. Fletterick R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 9102-9106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Madsen N.B. Shechosky S. Fletterick R.J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4460-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The overall architecture of the native T state GPb with the location of the cofactor pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, the catalytic site, the allosteric (or nucleotide) site, the inhibitor (or nucleoside) site, and a new allosteric inhibitor site, identified recently as target for drug interactions, is presented in Fig. 1. The inhibitor site is located at the entrance to the catalytic site, near the domain interface, and comprises residues from both domains 1 (residues 13–484) and 2 (residues 485–842). The site binds a number of aromatic compounds such as caffeine. Crystallographic data collection, processing, and refinement statistics for the co-crystallized GPb-flavopiridol and GPa-glucose-flavopiridol complexes are shown in Table I. For both complexes, the refined 2F o − F celectron density maps indicated that flavopiridol (SchemeFSI) bound strongly at the inhibitor site (Fig. 3), consistent with the kinetic results. In the GPa-glucose-flavopiridol complex, additional density at the catalytic site indicated binding of glucose. The mode of binding and the interactions that glucose makes with GPa, in the presence of flavopiridol, are almost identical with those previously reported for the complex GPa-glucose at 100 K (23Oikonomakos N.G. Tsitsanou K.E. Zographos S.E. Skamnaki V.T. Goldmann S. Bischoff H. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1930-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In particular, Asp283 and Asn284 of the 280s loop are in the same position where they are found in the GPa-glucose complex.

Liberated signal peptides can be further processed, and the resulting N-terminal fragments are released toward the cytosol, where they may interact with target proteins like calmodulin. We show here that the processing of signal peptides requires a protease activity distinct from signal peptidase. This activity is inhibited specifically with a newly developed cysteine protease inhibitor, 1,3-di-(N-carboxybenzoyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl)amino acetone ((Z-LL)2 ketone).

Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Signal sequences are usually released from the precursor protein by signal peptidase during passage of the growing polypeptide chain through the ER membrane. Little is known about the fate of the liberated signal peptides. However, they have been postulated to have important biological functions both in the lumen of the ER as well as in the cytosol (2Martoglio B. Dobberstein B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 410-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Signal peptides, liberated from the precursor protein, can be processed further, resulting in fragments that are released from the membrane (3Klappa P. Dierks T. Zimmermann R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar,4Lyko F. Martoglio B. Jungnickel B. Rapoport T.A. Dobberstein B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19873-19878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the case of the hormone preprolactin (p-Prl) and the human immunodeficiency virus-1 gp160, the N-terminal portion of the respective signal peptide is released into the cytosol and binds to Ca2+/calmodulin in vitro (5Martoglio B. Graf R. Dobberstein B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6636-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These findings imply that processing of liberated signal peptides releases functional peptides that may influence signal transduction pathways in the cell. More recently, a distinct peptide derived from an N-terminal portion of a signal sequence was found to play a crucial role in immune surveillance of healthy cells. The signal peptides of polymorphic major histocompatibility complex class I molecules contain a highly conserved sequence that is capable of binding to so-called non-polymorphic major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (HLA-E in human) (6Braud V. Jones E.Y. McMichael A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1164-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). At the cell surface, this peptide-HLA-E complex specifically interacts with an inhibitory receptor on natural killer (NK) cells, thereby monitoring indirectly the level of class I molecule expression (7Borrego F. Ulbrecht M. Weiss E.H. Coligan J.E. Brooks A.G. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 8Braud V.M. Allan D.S. O'Callaghan C.A. Soderstrom K. D'Andrea A. Ogg G.S.

Presentation of the signal peptide-derived epitope is dependent on the transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP) and is independent of the proteasome (9Bai A. Forman J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2139-2146PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the signal peptide of class I molecules is processed in a manner analogous to the p-Prl signal sequence, leading to release of the epitope-containing portion toward the cytosol. In eukaryotes, proteases involved in the processing of signal peptides have yet to be characterized or identified. Protease IV and oligopeptidase A process signal peptides in Escherichia coli, but homologous proteases have not been found in eukaryotes (10Novak P. Dev I.K. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5067-5075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A new class of metalloproteases that catalyze so-called intramembrane proteolysis has recently been discovered (11Rudner D.Z. Fawcett P. Losick R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14765-14770Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These proteases cleave their substrate proteins within transmembrane regions and promote release of protein domains toward the cytoplasmic or exoplasmic side of the membrane. Signal peptides may be processed by a similar type of protease that cleaves the peptide within the transmembrane region and facilitates release of peptide fragments from the membrane. In the present study, we characterize the processing of the p-Prl signal peptide. By using different types of protease inhibitors, we ascribe signal sequence cleavage and signal peptide processing to distinct proteolytic activities. A new inhibitor is introduced that prevents signal peptide processing efficiently without affecting signal peptidase and other proteases such as the lysosomal cathepsins and the proteasome. We show that processing promotes release of the Ca2+/calmodulin binding signal peptide portion from the membrane into the cytosol. Furthermore, we have determined the cleavage site of the final processing reaction to lie in the center of transmembrane region of the signal peptide. The ketone inhibitor (Z-LL)2 ketone was synthesized in a single step by coupling an excess of commercially available Z-LL-OH with diamino acetone using the coupling reagent HATU and collidine (Fig.1 B). The resulting product was then isolated by column chromatography and identified by NMR and mass spectrometry. The biotin derivative, (Bio-LL)2 ketone, was synthesized as the corresponding di-t-butoxycarbonyl-capped derivative (BOC-LL)2 ketone as described for (Z-LL)2ketone, except that BOC-LL-OH was used in place of Z-LL-OH. The resulting BOC-capped derivative was de-protected by brief trifluoroacetic acid treatment followed by precipitation in ether. The activated, nitrophenyl ester of biotin was used to alkylate both free N termini, resulting in (Bio-LL)2 ketone. The identity of the compound was confirmed by NMR and mass spectrometry. Extracts were prepared from the dendritic cell line DC2.4 and the fibroblast cell line NIH-3T3 by mechanical disruption using glass beads in buffer A (50 mmTris, pH 5.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, 250 mm sucrose) at pH 5.5 (DC2.4 cells) or pH 7.4 (NIH-3T3 cells). Protein concentrations were determined using BCA reagents. Samples of DC2.4 lysates (100 μg of total protein) were incubated with increasing concentrations (as indicated) of the two ketone inhibitors (Bio-LL)2 ketone and (Z-LL)2ketone and the peptide aldehyde leupeptin for 30 min at room temperature. Cysteine proteases were then labeled by the addition of125I-JPM-565 (∼106 cpm/sample) followed by separation by SDS-PAGE and analysis by autoradiography. The same protocol was used for analysis of proteasome activity in NIH-3T3 cells except the peptide aldehyde MG-132 was used instead of leupeptin, and samples were labeled with 125I-NLVS (12Bogyo M.

To prepare mRNA coding for full-length p-Prl, plasmid pGEM3Z/p-Prl was linearized withEcoRI and transcribed in vitro with SP6 RNA polymerase at 42 °C in the presence of 500 μmm7G(5′)ppp(5′)G CAP analogue (New England Biolabs) (14Gilmore R. Collins P. Johnson J. Kellaris K. Rapiejko P. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 223-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To prepare mRNA coding for p-Prl/86, the respective coding region was amplified with polymerase chain reaction usingPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), SP6 primer, and a reverse primer starting at the 5′-end with the triplet that corresponds to the 86th amino acid residue. When translation was supposed to terminate by proper termination of translation at a given residue (e.g. for synthesis of reference peptides), a TAG stop codon was introduced at the relevant position, and a reverse primer starting with 5′-NNNNNNNNNCTA- was used for polymerase chain reaction. Polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA fragments were transcribedin vitro with SP6 RNA polymerase as described above (15Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Translations of mRNA coding for p-Prl were performed in 25 μl of reticulocyte lysate (Promega) containing [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and, where indicated, 1.5 eq of nuclease-treated rough microsomes prepared from dog pancreas (16Walter P.

Samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Samples containing microsomes were next diluted with 25 μl of RM buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 50 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose), and the salt concentration was raised to 500 mm potassium acetate. After incubation for 5 min on ice, membranes were separated by a 3-min centrifugation through a 100-μl sucrose cushion (RM buffer with 500 mm potassium acetate and 500 mmsucrose) at 48,000 rpm and 4 °C in a Beckman TLA100 rotor (4Lyko F.

Samples without microsomes were supplemented with 50 μl of saturated (NH4)2SO4 to precipitate the bulk of proteins. The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation and washed once with 500 μl of 5% trichloroacetic acid and twice with 150 μl of acetone. Membrane and protein pellets were prepared for SDS-PAGE as described below. Truncated mRNA coding for p-Prl/86 was translated for 10 min at 30 °C in 50 μl of reticulocyte lysate containing [35S]methionine and nuclease-treated rough microsomes (3 eq). After translation, samples were diluted with 50 μl of RM buffer, and microsomes were treated with 500 mm potassium acetate and recovered by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion as described above. Microsomes were resuspended in 120 μl of RM buffer, and samples were split in 20-μl aliquots. To one aliquot, 0.5 μl of Me2SO was added, and the sample was placed on ice; to other aliquots, 0.5 μl of 40 μm (Z-LL)2 ketone, 400 μm (Bio-LL)2 ketone, 20 mmcalpain inhibitor I, or 20 mm dichloroisocoumarin (all in Me2SO) was added, and the samples were pre-incubated for 3 min at 22 °C. Nascent chains were released by adding 1 μl of 100 mm puromycin and further incubation at 22 °C for 15 min. Proteins were next either precipitated by adding trichloroacetic acid to 10% and prepared for SDS-PAGE (see below) or membranes were separated by a 10-min centrifugation at 100,000 rpm and 4 °C in a Beckman TLA100 rotor, and the membrane pellet and supernatant were prepared for SDS-PAGE as described below. Translations of mRNAs coding for reference peptides (p-Prl/18, p-Prl/20, p-Prl/25, p-Prl/27, and p-Prl/30) were performed in 25 μl of wheat germ extract containing [35S]methionine (17Martoglio B. Hauser S. Dobberstein B. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 2. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1998: 265-274Google Scholar). To obtain solubilized ER membrane proteins, rough microsomes were first prepared from dog pancreas (17Martoglio B. Hauser S. Dobberstein B. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 2. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1998: 265-274Google Scholar). Associated ribosomes and peripheral membrane proteins were removed by treatment with puromycin/high salt (18Hauser S. Bacher G. Dobberstein B. Lütcke H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5485-5493Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and lumenal proteins were depleted by exposure of microsomes to alkaline pH (19Nicchitta C.V. Blobel G. Cell. 1990; 60: 259-269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Membranes were next resuspended (1–2 eq/μl) by using a Dounce homogenizer in solubilization buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 125 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2% CHAPS. The sample was incubated for 30 min on ice, and non-solubilized proteins were subsequently removed by centrifugation in a TLA100.4 rotor (Beckman Instruments) for 30 min at 75,000 rpm and 4 °C. For the processing assay, 2 μl of p-Prl/30 translation mixture (see above) were added to 35 μl of assay buffer (25 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Where indicated, 1 μl of 40 μm (Z-LL)2ketone was added; 1 μl Me2SO was added to all the other samples. The reaction was started by the addition of 2 μl (2 eq) of rough microsomes, puromycin-treated, and content-depleted microsomes or detergent-solubilized microsomes. After incubation at 30 °C for 1 h, proteins were precipitated by adding trichloroacetic acid to 10%, and samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE (see below). Proteins and peptides were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using Tris-Bicine gels (20Wiltfang J. Smirnov A. Schnierstein B. Kelemen G. Matthies U. Klafki H.W. Staufenbiel M. Huther G. Ruther E. Kornhuber J.

Membrane pellets were solubilized in 12 μl of sample buffer containing 360 mm BisTris, 160 mm bicine, 1% SDS, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 15% sucrose, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 0.004% Serva blue. Supernatants (20 μl) obtained after treatment with puromycin were supplemented with 1 μl of wheat germ extract, and proteins were precipitated by adding trichloroacetic acid to 10%. The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation, washed twice with 150 μl of acetone, and solubilized in 12 μl of sample buffer. All samples were incubated for 20 min at 65 °C. Proteins were finally separated on 14.25% acrylamide, 0.75% bis-acrylamide, 8 m urea gels (70 × 80 × 1 mm). Labeled proteins were visualized by a STORM PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Analysis of the amino acid sequence surrounding the putative intra-membrane cut site of the signal peptide from preprolactin and human immunodeficiency virus-1 gp160 indicated that both contain a cluster of hydrophobic amino acids on either side of the scissile amide bond (Fig.1 A). Based on this information, we designed protease inhibitors that contain a central electrophile surrounded by aliphatic amino acid residues. Previously, Veber and co-workers (21Marquis R.W.

These compounds bind to the enzyme such that the peptide portions of the molecules on either side of the ketone electrophile occupy both the prime and non-prime binding sites. We reasoned that analogs of these compounds might be well suited for mimicking the hydrophobic core of the signal peptide and, therefore, might serve as potent inhibitors of the putative signal peptide peptidase activity. We first synthesized the simple symmetrical di-leucine-containing derivative in which both N termini were capped with the hydrophobic carboxybenzoyl group ((Z-LL)2 ketone; Fig. 1 B). The related compound in which the Z capping group was replaced with at-butoxycarbonyl group was also synthesized. This derivative was de-protected with acid, resulting in a di-free amino derivative that was then alkylated by biotin ((Bio-LL)2 ketone; Fig.1 B). To initially determine the specificity of both the Z and biotin ketone derivatives, we performed competition experiments in crude cellular extracts. Lysates from the dendritic cell line DC2.4 were incubated with increasing concentrations of both (Z-LL)2 ketone and (Bio-LL)2 ketone for 30 min at room temperature (Fig.2). After pre-incubation, a radiolabeled general cysteine protease inhibitor 125I-JPM-565 was added to the extracts. This compound covalently modifies the active site of most of the papain family of cysteine proteases. Intensity of labeling of protease targets serves as readout of enzymatic activity. Thus, prior modification of the active site of the enzyme by either (Z-LL)2 ketone or (Bio-LL)2 ketone is observed as a loss of labeling by 125I-JPM-565. The results from DC2.4 extracts indicated that at low concentrations (0.1–10 μm) neither the Z nor biotin-capped derivatives are reactive toward any of the multiple lysosomal cysteine proteases targeted by the general cysteine protease label125I-JPM-565. The Z compound at high concentrations specifically blocks labeling of a single 25-kDa polypeptide. The general cysteine protease inhibitor leupeptin blocked labeling of most of the JPM-565-reactive proteases, indicating that the assay was an effective readout of lysosomal cysteine protease activity. Therefore, biological effects observed from treatment of samples with low concentrations of the inhibitors (Z-LL)2 ketone and (Bio-LL)2 ketone are not likely due to inhibition of lysosomal proteases. To further establish the reactivity of these ketone derivatives, we performed a similar set of competition experiments in NIH-3T3 extracts using the proteasome label 125I-NLVS as readout. These experiments provided complementary information about the reactivity of the two compounds toward the proteasome. Both the (Z-LL)2ketone and the (Bio-LL)2 ketone showed no modification of the proteasomal active site at concentrations as high as 100 μm (data not shown). Thus, these compounds do not block the action of the multicatalytic proteasome complex. To investigate processing of the p-Prl signal peptide, we used a previously established in vitro assay that includes synchronized entry of short p-Prl chains into ER-derived rough microsomes (5Martoglio B. Graf R. Dobberstein B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6636-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Truncated mRNA coding for the 86 N-terminal residues of p-Prl was translated in the presence of rough microsomes. The resulting p-Prl/86 chains were bound to the ribosomes at their C terminus and inserted into the translocons via their N-terminal signal sequence. Signal sequence cleavage did not occur because the p-Prl/86 chains were too short (Fig.3 A, lane 1). Microsomes were isolated and resuspended in buffer, and p-Prl/86 chains were released from the ribosome by the addition of puromycin. p-Prl/86 chains were translocated, and the signal sequence was cleaved and processed. The liberated, 30-residue signal peptide was seen after a short incubation with puromycin (Fig. 3 A, lane 2), whereas the processed peptide was obtained after longer incubation (Fig. 3 A, lane 3). To distinguish the individual proteolytic steps of signal sequence cleavage and signal peptide processing, we tested several different classes of protease inhibitors. The newly developed cysteine protease inhibitors (Z-LL)2 ketone and (Bio-LL)2 ketone inhibited signal peptide processing without affecting signal peptidase activity (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2 and 3). The apparent IC50 value determined by our assay was ∼50 nm for (Z-LL)2 ketone (Fig. 3 C) and 1–2 μm for (Bio-LL)2 ketone (not shown). Similarly, signal peptide processing was inhibited by calpain inhibitor I, another cysteine protease inhibitor, albeit at much higher concentration (Fig. 3 B, lane 4). In contrast, the serine protease inhibitor dichloroisocoumarin inhibited signal peptidase, thereby blocking release of the signal sequence from the precursor protein (Fig. 3 B, lane 5). These results indicate that signal peptide processing requires at least one protease that is distinct from signal peptidase. We have reported that the N-terminal portion of the p-Prl signal peptide is released into the cytosolin vitro, where it binds to Ca2+/calmodulin upon cleavage and processing (5Martoglio B. Graf R. Dobberstein B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6636-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To determine whether processing is required for release of the N-terminal peptide into the cytosol, we treated microsomes with (Z-LL)2 ketone before release of p-Prl/86 chains with puromycin. After treatment with puromycin, we separated microsomes from the release buffer by centrifugation and analyzed the microsomes and buffer fraction separately. In the presence of (Z-LL)2 ketone, the unprocessed signal peptide is found exclusively in the membrane fraction (Fig.4 A, lane 5). In the control reaction where the inhibitor is omitted, the signal peptide is processed, and the N-terminal fragment is released from the membrane toward the cytosolic side and, hence, found in the supernatant fraction (Fig. 4 A, lane 4). Cytosol facilitates the release of the processed p-Prl signal peptide from the membrane, most likely due to the presence of its target, calmodulin (5Martoglio B. Graf R. Dobberstein B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6636-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To test whether signal peptide processing is required for efficient release of the N-terminal portion, we translated full-length p-Prl in reticulocyte lysate in the presence of microsomes and (Z-LL)2 ketone. Microsomes were extracted with 500 mm salt and sedimented through a sucrose cushion to remove excess cytosolic proteins that interfere with the analysis of small peptides. When (Z-LL)2 ketone was added to the translation mixture, the unprocessed signal peptide was found in the membrane fraction (Fig. 4 B, lane 3). In contrast, no corresponding peptide was obtained in the control reaction without the inhibitor (Fig. 4 B, lane 2). These results show that processing of the p-Prl signal peptide is required for efficient release of the N-terminal peptide portion, even in the presence of cytosol. The p-Prl signal peptide is thought to be processed in the region between the two leucine clusters of its hydrophobic region (4Lyko F. Martoglio B. Jungnickel B. Rapoport T.A. Dobberstein B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19873-19878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To determine the cleavage site, we compared the electrophoretic mobility of the cleavage product with reference peptides. The cleavage product detected must represent the N-terminal fragment, because the p-Prl signal peptide is radioactively labeled at a single methionine residue at its N terminus. Reference peptides were thus easily obtained by in vitro translating mRNAs coding for the N-terminal 18-, 20-, 25-, and 30-amino acid residues of the p-Prl signal sequence (Fig. 5 A). The cleavage product had mobility identical to that of the 20-residue reference peptide (Fig. 5 A, lanes 3 and4), indicating that the p-Prl signal peptide is cleaved in the center of its transmembrane region, where the polar residues serine and asparagine interrupt the hydrophobic segment. Interestingly, a common feature of the transmembrane region of signal peptides is the acquisition of a helix-break-helix structure in an apolar environment (23van Klompenburg W. de Kruijff B. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 162: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The break in the helix structure is thought to facilitate membrane entry at the initial phase of protein translocation and may also make the scissile peptide bond accessible to proteolysis during signal peptide processing. The investigation of signal peptide processing requires ER-derived microsomes that are functional in protein targeting, translocation, and signal sequence cleavage. To analyze processing independently of preceding reactions, we simplified the assay by using the p-Prl signal peptide (p-Prl/30) as the immediate substrate for the cleavage reaction. Because synthetic signal peptides are known to enter the translocon without the aid of cytosolic components (24Simon S.M. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 69: 677-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), p-Prl/30 is expected to enter the translocon and be processed similarly to the signal peptide that enters the translocon by the conventional protein targeting pathway. Indeed, when in vitro translated p-Prl/30 was incubated together with microsomes, we obtained a cleavage identical to the one obtained with the previous assay, where p-Prl/86 chains were inserted into the translocons and cleaved by signal peptidase before the liberated signal peptide could be processed (Fig.5 B, lanes 2 and 3). In an initial attempt to characterize the protease that catalyzes processing of the p-Prl signal peptide, we extracted rough microsomes first with puromycin and 600 mm salt to remove the ribosomes and peripherally associated proteins and then with alkali to wash out lumenal proteins (19Nicchitta C.V. Blobel G. Cell. 1990; 60: 259-269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 25Hamman B.D. Hendershot L.M. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 747-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The resulting PKXRMs were still active and processed p-Prl/30 to the ∼20-residue fragment (Fig.5 B, lane 4). We then solubilized the residual ER membrane proteins with the detergent CHAPS. When p-Prl/30 was incubated with the detergent-solubilized proteins, it was processed to the ∼20-residue fragment, as with intact, untreated microsomes (Fig.5 B, lane 5). (Z-LL)2 ketone inhibited the processing reaction, although a ∼27-residue fragment was obtained instead (Fig. 5 B, lane 7). The latter cut was most likely performed by signal peptidase that, when solubilized, may have access to a second potential consensus site in the C-terminal extension of the p-Prl signal peptide (26von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar). These results indicate that “intramembrane proteolysis” can be re-constituted using detergent-solubilized membranes. The role of signal sequences in protein targeting and membrane insertion is well established (27Stroud R.M. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 754-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The fate of signal peptides beyond cleavage from the pre-protein, however, remains unclear. Degradation may be the immediate destination for most signal peptides that are cleared from the ER membrane by as of yet unidentified proteases. However, in some cases signal peptides have been shown to perform functions downstream of precursor protein processing. Dissecting the pathway followed by signal peptides, as presented here, reveals a possible mechanism for how the ER membrane is cleared from peptides and indicates an approach toward the identification of the distinct components involved in the release process. Cleavage of proteins in transmembrane regions and concomitant release of protein domains or peptides from the membrane, as reported here for the signal peptide of p-Prl, has become increasingly evident and is involved in cellular differentiation, lipid metabolism, and presumably, the unfolded protein response (28Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar, 29Martoglio B. Protoplasma. 1999; 207: 141-146Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The process was named intramembrane proteolysis, assuming that cleavage occurs in the plain of the lipid bilayer, although the proof of proteolysis within the membrane is not provided so far (28Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). In animal cells, at least three proteins undergo intramembrane proteolysis according to the definition given above. These proteins are SREBPs (sterol regulatory element-binding proteins) and Notch, transmembrane proteins of the ER and Golgi/plasma membrane, respectively, whose cytosolic transcription factor domains are liberated upon activation, and APP (β-amyloid precursor protein), which can be processed to the amyloid peptide Aβ suspected to cause Alzheimer's disease (30Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar, 31Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 399 Suppl. 6738: A23-A31Crossref Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). SREBPs and Notch are cleaved close to the cytosolic end of their respective transmembrane regions of type II topology (N in, C out) and type I topology (N out, C in), respectively. In contrast, APP is cleaved in the center of its transmembrane region, which has type I topology. The latter type of cleavage is analogous to the processing of the preprolactin signal peptide, which is also cleaved in the center of the transmembrane region. However, the membrane orientation of the signal peptide is opposite to that of APP. This finding adds a missing link to the group of proteases that perform intramembrane proteolysis: a protease that cleaves in the center of a type II-oriented transmembrane region (29Martoglio B. Protoplasma. 1999; 207: 141-146Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). With the exception of S2P, proteases that promote cleavage in transmembrane regions have not been identified so far. This putative metalloprotease catalyzes cleavage within one of the two membrane anchors of SREBPs and was identified by complementation cloning (32Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T. Chang T.Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Data base searches revealed a family of S2P-like metalloproteases with the common, unusual feature of a HEXXH motive within a transmembrane region, suggesting that intramembrane proteolysis is a process conserved in evolution from bacteria to man (11Rudner D.Z. Fawcett P. Losick R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14765-14770Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Signal peptide processing is inhibited by cysteine protease inhibitors. Inhibition is particularly efficient with the novel (Z-LL)2ketone, designed according to the expected cleavage site within the signal peptide. Metalloprotease inhibitors such as EDTA (≤25 mm) and o-phenanthroline (≤5 mm) have no effect (not shown). These findings suggest that the unidentified signal peptide peptidase belongs to another class of proteases that cleave presumably in the plane of the lipid bilayer (29Martoglio B. Protoplasma. 1999; 207: 141-146Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The molecular identification of signal peptide peptidase remains a challenging task for future research. Intramembrane proteolysis and concomitant release of a functional peptide also occurs in bacteria. The eubacterium Enterococcus faecalis secretes an octapeptide pheromone cAF1 that is derived from a signal sequence (33An F.Y. Sulavik M.C. Clewell D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5915-5921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pheromone is generated from a precursor protein by cleavages at two sites. First the signal sequence, which contains the octapeptide, is cleaved off by signal peptidase at the extracellular side of the plasma membrane. Then the signal peptide is processed within the transmembrane region by a designated protease Eep that resembles S2P (28Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar, 33An F.Y. Sulavik M.C. Clewell D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5915-5921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The processes of SREBP activation and cAF1 release are strikingly similar to the generation of the p-Prl signal peptide fragment described herein. Signal peptidase cleaves the translocating p-Prl chain in the ER lumen and liberates the signal peptide that becomes anchored in the ER membrane. A subsequent cut within the transmembrane region favors the release of the N-terminal peptide portion toward the cytosol. This signal peptide fragment binds to Ca2+/calmodulin in vitro upon release from the membrane, which led to the speculation that the released peptide may influence calmodulin-dependent signal transduction pathways in a cell (5Martoglio B. Graf R. Dobberstein B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6636-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Signal peptides of other proteins may likewise have functions beyond protein targeting and membrane insertion (2Martoglio B. Dobberstein B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 410-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Signal peptide processing could promote the release of these peptides from the ER membrane, as shown here for the preprolactin signal peptide. Liberated into the cytosol or the exoplasmic space, signal peptide fragments can report on the synthesis of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (7Borrego F. Ulbrecht M. Weiss E.H. Coligan J.E. Brooks A.G. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar,8Braud V.M. Allan D.S. O'Callaghan C.A. Soderstrom K. D'Andrea A. Ogg G.S. Lazetic S. Young N.T. Bell J.I. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. McMichael A.J. Nature. 1998; 391: 795-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar) or inducing a mating response (33An F.Y. Sulavik M.C. Clewell D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5915-5921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specific protease inhibitors such as (Z-LL)2 ketone are powerful tools to further elucidate the role of signal peptide processing in vitro and possibly in living cells. Furthermore, such inhibitors may facilitate the biochemical identification of the elusive signal peptide peptidase, particularly in combination with the assay that allows monitoring of signal peptide processing using detergent-solubilized ER membrane proteins. The approach to address intramembrane proteolysis presented here may be applied similarly to identify related proteases such as γ-secretase- and S2P-like proteases.

In response to Wnt, β-catenin is stabilized and translocated into the nucleus where it stimulates gene expression through Tcf/Lef. Here we report a novel protein, designated Duplin (for axis duplication inhibitor), which negatively regulates the function of β-catenin in the nucleus. Duplin was located in the nucleus. Duplin bound directly to the Armadillo repeats of β-catenin, thereby inhibiting the binding of Tcf to β-catenin. It did not affect the stability of β-catenin but inhibited Wnt- or β-catenin-dependent Tcf activation. Furthermore, expression of Duplin in Xenopus embryos inhibited the axis formation and β-catenin-dependent axis duplication, and prevented the β-catenin's ability to rescue ventralizing phenotypes induced by ultraviolet light irradiation. Thus, Duplin is a nuclear protein that inhibits β-catenin signaling. β-Catenin is efficiently phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase-3β in the Axin complex in the cytoplasm, resulting in the down-regulation.

Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2984) Google Scholar). Many binding partners of β-catenin have been found, suggesting that β-catenin has other functions in addition to its role in cell-cell adhesion. Genetic and embryological studies have revealed that β-catenin is a component of the Wnt signaling pathway and that it exhibits signaling functions (2Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar, 3Dale T.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 4Miller J.R. Hocking A.M. Brown J.D.

In the current model, the serine/threonine kinase, GSK-3β1 targets cytoplasmic β-catenin for degradation in the absence of Wnt. As a result, cytoplasmic β-catenin levels are low. When Wnt acts on its cell surface receptor Frizzled, Dvl, a cytoplasmic protein, is activated and it antagonizes the action of GSK-3β. The phosphorylation of β-catenin is reduced and β-catenin is no longer degraded, resulting in its accumulation in the cytoplasm. Accumulated β-catenin is translocated into the nucleus where it binds to Tcf/Lef, a transcription factor, and stimulates gene expression (7Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kühl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D.

In the nucleus, several proteins that bind to Tcf/Lef regulate the complex formation of β-catenin-Tcf-DNA. Therefore, it appears that β-catenin signaling is regulated in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. The mechanism by which the stability of β-catenin is regulated has been increasingly clarified. Discovery and functional analyses of Axin have provided new clues as to how the stability of β-catenin is regulated (9Kikuchi A. Cell.

Thus, Axin is a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway. Further, Axin is phosphorylated by GSK-3β and the phosphorylation stabilizes Axin in contrast to β-catenin (26Yamamoto H. Kishida S.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Further, the B56 subunit of PP2A binds to APC and its expression reduces the levels of cytoplasmic β-catenin in HEK293 cells (31Seeling J.M. Miller J.R. Gil R. Moon R.T. White R. Virshup D.M. Science. 1999; 283: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In the Axin complex, the phosphorylation of β-catenin, APC, and Axin is regulated by GSK-3β, Dvl, and PP2A, and the stability of β-catenin and Axin is controlled by their phosphorylation. Therefore, Axin may be a scaffold protein, in that it binds to several signaling molecules to create a multiprotein complex. Cytoplasmic β-catenin accumulated in response to Wnt is translocated into the nucleus although the mechanism is unknown (32Fagotto F. Gluck U. Gumbiner B.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to Tcf/Lef, β-catenin forms a complex with Pontin52 in the nucleus (33Bauer A. Huber O. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14787-14792Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Pontin52 can be coimmunoprecipitated within a large complex containing β-catenin and Lef-1, but whether Pontin52 affects the β-catenin activity to regulate the gene expression is not known. To understand the molecular mechanism of the β-catenin signaling in the Wnt pathway, we have screened the new binding partners of the components of the Wnt signaling pathway. We isolated a novel protein that binds to Dvl by yeast two-hybrid screening. Although this protein bound to Dvlin vitro, it did not form a complex with Dvl in intact cells. However, during these experiments, we found that this novel protein is located in the nucleus and that it forms a complex with β-catenin in intact cells. We designated this protein as Duplin (for axis duplication inhibitor) and examined its effects on β-catenin signaling. We show here that Duplin inhibits the binding of β-catenin to Tcf and β-catenin-dependent activation of Tcf in mammalian cells and that it inhibits β-catenin-dependent axis duplication inXenopus embryos. pcDNAI/hTcf-4 and pTOPFLASH, and pUC/EF-1α/β-cateninSA were supplied by Drs. H. Clevers (University Hospital, Utrecht, The Netherlands) and A. Nagafuchi (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan), respectively. β-CateninSA is a β-catenin mutant in which the serine and threonine residues of the GSK-3β phosphorylation sites (21Yost C. Torres M.

The cDNA of hDvl-1, the anti-HA antibody, and the anti-GST and anti-MBP antibodies were provided by Drs. B. Dallapiccola (Vergata University, Rome, Italy) (34Pizzuti A. Amati F. Calabrese G. Mari A. Colosimo A. Silani V. Giardino L. Ratti A. Penso D. Calza L. Palka G. Scarlato G. Novelli G. Dallapiccola B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 953-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), Q. Hu (Chiron Corp.), and M. Nakata (Sumitomo Electric Industries, Yokohama, Japan), respectively. MBP- and GST-fused proteins were purified fromEscherichia coli according to the manufacturer's instructions except that GST-Dvl-1 was purified from Spodptera frugiperda 9 cells as described (28Kishida S.

The anti-Duplin and anti-Dvl antibodies were prepared in rabbits by immunization with recombinant fragments of Duplin-(482–668) and Dvl-1-(1–140), respectively. The anti-Myc antibody was prepared from 9E10 cells. L cells (mouse fibroblasts) stably expressing HA-Duplin were generated by selecting with G418 as described (25Kishida M. Koyama S. Kishida S.

Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The anti-GSK-3β and anti-β-catenin antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). [α-32P]dCTP was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Other materials were from commercial sources. Standard recombinant DNA techniques were used to construct the following plasmids, pBTM116HA/hDvl-1-(251–336), pBSKS/Duplin-(1–482), pBSKS/Duplin-(482–749), pBSKS/Duplin (full-length), pCGN/hTcf-4 (full length), pGEX-2T/hTcf-4-(1–80), pMAL-c2/β-catenin, pMAL-c2/Duplin, pMAL-c2/Duplin-(1–276), pMAL-c2/Duplin-(482–749), pMAL-c2/Duplin-(482–668), pMAL-c2/Duplin-(667–749), pGEX-4T-1/Duplin-(482–749), pGEX-4T-1/Duplin-(482–668), pGEX-4T-1/Duplin-(667–749), pBJ-Myc/Duplin, pCGN/Duplin, pCGN/Duplin-(1–482), pCGN/Duplin-(482–749), pCGN/Duplin-(482–668), pCGN/Duplin-(482–564), pCGN/Duplin-(667–749), pCGN/Duplin-(565–668), and pEF-BOS-HA/hTcf-4. The structures of all plasmids were confirmed by restriction analysis and in many cases by DNA sequence analysis across crucial regions. pGEX-derived β-catenin plasmids, pCGN/rAxin, and pGEX-2T/hDvl-1-(1–140) were constructed as described (14Ikeda S.

COS or L cells (two 10-cm diameter dishes) were washed with cold PBS and suspended in 1 ml of homogenizing buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 250 mm sucrose, 3 mmMgCl2, 3 mm CaCl2, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). This suspension was homogenized with a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer at 4 °C and used as the total homogenate. The homogenate was centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The precipitate was washed and resuspended in homogenizing buffer. This suspension was used as the nuclear fraction. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used as the cytoplasmic fraction. The precipitate was washed and resuspended in homogenizing buffer. This suspension was used as the membrane fraction. The volume of all the fractions were normalized to 1 ml. Aliquots (20 μl) of the total homogenate and cytoplasm, membrane, and nuclear fractions were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and probed with the anti-β-catenin and anti-Myc antibodies. SW480 and L cells on coverslips were fixed for 20 min in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were washed with PBS three times, and then permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 12 h. The cells were washed and incubated for 1 h with the anti-HA or the anti-Duplin antibody. After washing with PBS, they were further incubated for 1 h with Alexa 594 labeled-anti-mouse or -anti-rabbit IgG. The coverslips were washed with PBS, mounted on glass slides, and viewed with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (TCS-NT®, Leica-laser-technik GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). To determine whether Duplin interacts with β-catenin in intact cells, COS cells (10-cm diameter dish) transfected with pCGN- and pBJ-derived plasmids were disrupted by sonication in 500 μl of the lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and the homogenate was centrifuged at 100, 000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (150 μg of protein) was immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody, and then the precipitates were probed with the anti-Myc, anti-HA, anti-GSK-3β, anti-β-catenin, and anti-Dvl antibodies. To examine the interaction of Duplin with β-catenin using the purified proteins in vitro, GST-β-catenin and its deletion mutants (0.5 μm) were incubated with MBP-Duplin-(482–749) (30 pmol) immobilized on amylose resin in 100 μl of reaction mixture (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT) for 1 h at 4 °C. MBP-Duplin was precipitated by centrifugation, and then the precipitates were probed with the anti-GST antibody. To show inhibition by Duplin of the binding of Tcf to β-catenin in vitro, the indicated concentrations of GST-Duplin-(482–749) and GST-hTcf-4-(1–80) (0.5 μm) were incubated with MBP-β-catenin (30 pmol) immobilized on amylose resin in 100 μl of reaction mixture. MBP-β-catenin was precipitated by centrifugation, then the precipitates were probed with the anti-GST antibody. To demonstrate the inhibitory action of Duplin in intact cells, wild-type L cells or L cells expressing HA-Duplin (10-cm diameter dish) were transfected with pcDNAI/hTcf-4. At 46 h after transfection, the cells were deprived of serum for 6 h, then treated with Wnt-3a-conditioned medium for 8 h. The cells were disrupted as described above, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-β-catenin antibody. The immunoprecipitates were probed with the anti-HA and anti-β-catenin antibodies. Wild-type L cells or L cells expressing HA-Duplin (35-mm diameter dish) were transfected with pTOPFLASH, pcDNAI/hTcf-4, and pME18S/lacZ (25Kishida M. Koyama S. Kishida S. Matsubara K. Nakashima S.

At 46 h after transfection, the cells were deprived of serum for 6 h, then treated with Wnt-3a conditioned medium for 8 h. When the effect of Duplin on β-catenin-dependent Tcf activation, wild-type L cells were further transfected with pUC/EF-1α/β-cateninSA and pBJ-Myc/Duplin. The cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured using a PicaGene (Toyo B-NET Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and lumiphotometer TD4000 (Futaba Medical, Tokyo, Japan). To standardize the transfection efficiency, pME18S/lacZ carrying SRα promoter linked to the coding sequence of β-galactosidase gene was used as an internal control. The transcriptional activity of the c-fos promoter activated by Ras was measured using luciferase as a reporter gene (35Okazaki M. Kishida S. Murai H. Hinoi T. Kikuchi A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2387-2392PubMed Google Scholar). Duplin, Duplin-(1–482), Duplin-(482–749), Duplin-(482–668), Duplin-(482–564), Duplin-(565–668), Duplin-(667–749), hDvl-1,Xenopus wnt-8 (Xwnt-8), Xenopus β-catenin (Xβ-catenin), and Xenopus globin (Xglobin) cDNAs were individually subcloned into the BglII site of pSP64T. Sense mRNA was obtained by in vitro transcription of linearized templates using SP6-mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion). Fertilized eggs were dejellied using 4.5% cysteine acid, and mRNAs were injected into dorsal or ventral blastomeres at the four-cell stage. After injection, embryos were cultured for 3 days (at stage 40–41). UV light irradiation was performed as described (38Scharf S.R. Gerhart J.C. Dev. Biol. 1980; 79: 181-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The phenotypes of the injected embryos were evaluated by DAI (39Kao K.R. Elinson R.P. Dev. Biol. 1988; 127: 64-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). For RT-PCR, injected embryos were incubated at stage 10.5, and then total RNAs were isolated. Oligo(dT)-primed cDNAs were synthesized using 5 μg of total RNA from 10 embryos. PCR analyses (35 cycles) were performed with ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara). Primers for PCR are: EF-1α, 5′-CAG ATT GGT GCT GGA TAT GC-3′ and 5′-ACT GCC TTG ATG ACT CCT AG-3′; siamois, 5′-AAG ATA ACT GGC ATT CCT GAG C-3′ and 5′-GGT AGG GCT GTG TAT TTG AAG G-3′. To examine whether Duplin is expressed in Xenopus embryos, 20 embryos were extracted in 100 μl of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), and the extracts were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Clear supernatant (50 μg of protein) was probed with the anti-Duplin antibody. Yeast two-hybrid screening was carried out as described (14Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar, 15Yamamoto H. Kishida S. Uochi T. Ikeda S. Koyama S. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2867-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). To obtain a full-length cDNA of Duplin, the clone isolated by the yeast two-hybrid method was labeled with random primers and [α-32P]dCTP and used to screen a λZAP rat brain cDNA library. Northern blot analysis was performed as described (40Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with bovine serum albumin as a standard (41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). To identify a novel protein that is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, we screened a rat brain cDNA library with yeast two-hybrid method using the PDZ domain of Dvl-1 as a bait. Several clones were found to confer both His+ and LacZ+ phenotypes, and a full-length cDNA of one clone was isolated. This clone spanned a distance of 2,503 base pairs and contained an uninterrupted open reading frame of 2,247 base pairs, encoding a predicted protein of 749 amino acids (Fig.1 A). The first ATG was preceded by stop codons in all three reading frames. The neighboring sequence of the first ATG was consistent with the translation initiation start proposed by Kozak (42Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar). Although no protein closely related to this protein was identified, the C-terminal half included several clusters of basic amino acids (Fig. 1, A andB). We designated this protein as Duplin (for axisduplication inhibitor). mRNA of Duplin was expressed ubiquitously in various rat tissues, and two bands were observed, suggesting that two mRNAs are derived from two highly conserved genes or result from alternative splicing of a single gene (Fig. 1 C). The anti-Duplin antibody recognized a protein with a molecular mass of about 110 kDa (p110) (Fig. 1 C). The molecular mass of Myc-Duplin expressed in COS cells was similar to that of p110, indicating that Duplin cDNA encodes this protein. Another protein with a molecular mass of 140 kDa (p140) was recognized in PC12 cells by the antibody, but we do not know the relationship between Duplin and p140. When the cells were divided into cytoplasmic, membrane, and nuclear fractions by subcellular fractionation, Myc-Duplin was present mainly in the nuclear fraction of COS cells (Fig. 1 D). Immunocytochemical analyses also showed that endogenous Duplin and HA-Duplin were located in the nucleus of L cells and SW480 cells (Fig. 1 E). Furthermore, HA-Duplin-(1–482) was present in the cytoplasm, while HA-Duplin-(482–749) was present in the nucleus (Fig. 1 E). In the residues 482–749, the region containing amino acids 482–564 was detected in the nucleus, whereas the region containing amino acids 565–668 was observed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 1 E). HA-Duplin-(667–749) was localized in the cytoplasm (data not shown). Therefore, Duplin is located in the nucleus and the C-terminal region has a nuclear localization signal. Since Duplin was isolated as a binding protein to Dvl by a yeast two-hybrid screening, we examined whether Duplin binds directly to Dvl. To this end, GST-Dvl-1 and various deletion mutants of MBP-Duplin were purified. However, MBP-Duplin-(1–482) could not be purified. GST-Dvl-1 bound to MBP-Duplin-(482–668) but not to MBP-Duplin-(1–276) or MBP-Duplin-(667–749) in vitro (data not shown), while Duplin did not form a complex with Dvl when Myc-Duplin was expressed in COS cells (Fig. 2 A,lanes 1–4). Further, ectopically expressed HA-Duplin or HA-Duplin-(1–487) did not associate with Myc-Dvl-1, either (data not shown). Since Dvl is located in the cytoplasm mainly, the difference between in vitro and intact cell experiments might be due to the difference of their subcellular localizations. Therefore, we did not study the interaction of Dvl with Duplin further. Instead, we found that endogenous β-catenin was precipitated with Myc-Duplin when Myc-Duplin was expressed in COS cells (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1–4). Myc-Duplin did not form a complex with GSK-3β, HA-rAxin, or HA-hTcf-4 (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1–12). To examine whether the interaction of Duplin with β-catenin is direct, MBP-Duplin-(482–749) or MBP was incubated with GST-β-catenin. GST-β-catenin was precipitated with MBP-Duplin-(482–749) but not with MBP (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–4). Regarding residues of 482–749 of Duplin, GST-Duplin-(667–749) but not GST-Duplin-(482–668) bound to MBP-β-catenin (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5–10). To determine which region of β-catenin binds to Duplin, various deletion mutants of GST-β-catenin were incubated with MBP-Duplin-(482–749). MBP-Duplin-(482–749) bound strongly to GST-β-catenin-(1–423) and GST-β-catenin-(132–423) and weakly to GST-β-catenin-(423–781), but not to GST-β-catenin-(1–131) or GST (Fig. 2 C). Since β-catenin-(132–423) contains Armadillo repeats 1–7, these results indicate that the C-terminal region of Duplin binds directly to the region including the Armadillo repeats of β-catenin. Tcf-4 is a nuclear protein that binds to β-catenin, and hTcf-4-(1–80) interacts directly with the Armadillo repeats of β-catenin (7Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kühl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D. Grosschedl R.

GST-Duplin-(482–749) competed with GST-hTcf-4-(1–80) for the binding to MBP-β-catenin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2 D). These results indicate that Duplin binds directly to β-catenin, resulting in inhibition of the binding of β-catenin to Tcf-4. We showed previously that Wnt-3a-conditioned medium induces the accumulation of β-catenin and activates Tcf-4 in L cells and that expression of Axin inhibits these Wnt-3a-dependent responses (25Kishida M.

In the present study, we determined signaling mechanisms upstream of MAPK activation that are involved in ET-1 stimulation and their synergism with stem cell factor (SCF). Pretreatment of cultured NHMC with ETB receptor antagonists, pertussis toxin, a specific phospholipase C inhibitor (U73122), or a protein kinase C inhibitor (calphostine) blocked a transient tyrosine phosphorylation of MAPK induced by ET-1, whereas the addition of a calcium chelator (BAPTA) failed to inhibit that tyrosine phosphorylation of MAPK. Treatment with ET-1 and SCF together synergistically increased DNA synthesis, which was accompanied by synergism for MAPK phosphorylation. The time course of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation revealed that there is no difference in the level of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate stimulated by ET-1 + SCF or by ET-1 alone. Evaluations of the serine phosphorylation of MEK and Raf-1 activity showed a synergistic effect in SCF + ET-1-treated NHMC. Stimulation with SCF + ET-1 induced a more rapid and stronger tyrosyl phosphorylation of proteins corresponding to p52 and p66 Shc than did stimulation with SCF only, and this was accompanied by a stronger association of tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc with Grb2. Interestingly, a more rapid and marked tyrosine phosphorylation of c-kit was also detected in NHMC-treated with SCF + ET-1 than NHMC treated with SCF only. These data indicate that the synergistic cross-talk between SCF and ET-1 signaling is initiated through the pathway of tyrosine phosphorylation of c-kit, which results in the enhanced formation of the Shc-Grb2 complex which leads in turn to the synergistic activation of the Ras/Raf-1/MEK/MAP kinase loop.

Morisaki N. Kimura M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1235-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), which probably provides a basis for the tendency of aged skins to be more sensitive to environmental stimuli and to be easily induced to epidermal hyperpigmentation. SCF is also known as a stimulator for epidermal hyperpigmentation in mastocytosis where mast cells undergo hyperproliferation in response to the soluble type of SCF derived from keratinocytes (4Longley Jr., B.J.

In Waardenburg syndrome type 2, mutation of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor is considered to be a central event leading to the dysfunction or loss of melanocytes (10Read A.P.

Nature Gen. 1996; 14: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Recently, the c-kit signaling pathway was found to be upstream of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor transcription through phosphorylation by MAP kinase (MAPK) (12Hemesath T.J. Price E.R. Takemoto C. Badalian T. Fisher D.E. Nature. 1998; 391: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). In mast cells, many reports (13Tsujimura T. Morii E. Nozaki M. Hashimoto K. Moriyama Y.

Furthermore, a disease termed Shah-Waardenburg syndrome, which combines the Waardenburg type 2 and Hirschsprung phenotypes, shows defects in microphthalmia-associated transcription factor and in the endothelin B receptor (15Edery P.

Thus, it is likely that signaling pathways stimulated by binding of ET-1 and SCF to their corresponding receptors have at least some common pathways and are working in a coordinated fashion to regulate melanocyte function. In relation to this, we have recently found that the proliferation of cultured human melanocytes (NHMC) induced by ET-1 is synergistically enhanced by the concomitant addition of SCF (16Imokawa G. Yada Y. Kimura M. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Endothelins are unique mitogens and melanogens for human melanocytes (1Imokawa G. Yada Y. Miyagishi M. J.

Pigment Cell Res. 1997; 10: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These cellular actions are known to be initiated by binding of ET-1 to G-protein-coupled ETB receptor, followed by sequential signaling processes consisting mainly of protein kinase C (PKC) and MAPK (16Imokawa G. Yada Y. Kimura M. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 17Imokawa G. Kobayashi T. Miyagishi M. Higashi K. Yada Y. Pigment Cell Res. 1997; 10: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). SCF stimulation is important for the survival and proliferation of several cell types in the hematopoietic system (18McNiece I.K. Langley K.E. Zsebo K.M. Exp. Hematol. 1991; 19: 226-231PubMed Google Scholar, 19Zsebo K.M. Wypych J. McNiece I.K. Lu H.S. Smith K.A. Karkare S.B. Sachdev R.K. Yuschenkoff V.N. Birkett N.C. Williams L.R. Cell. 1990; 63: 195-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), where it may function in combination with other growth factors. In human melanocytes, SCF alone is sufficient to sustain proliferation under serum-free conditions (16Imokawa G. Yada Y. Kimura M. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). SCF binding to the c-kit receptor mediates dimerization, activation of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, and autophosphorylation (20Blume-Jensen P. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Zsebo K.M. Westermark B. Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4121-4128Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The activated receptor then phosphorylates various substrates and associates with various signaling molecules, including phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI 3-kinase), the Shc and Grb2 adaptor proteins, and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, SOS, all of which lead to the activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway (21Cutler R.L. Liu L. Damen J.E. Krystal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21463-21465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lennartsson J. Blume-Jensen P. Hermanson M. Ponten E. Carlberg M. Ronnstrand L.

In the epidermis, the most abundant cells which surround melanocytes are keratinocytes, that are known to produce increased amounts of SCF and ET-1 in response to several stimuli (24Hori Y. Hearing V.J. Nakayama J. Imokawa G. Melanogenesis and Malignant Melanoma. Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam1996: 35-48Google Scholar). Therefore, it is of particular value to clarify the cross-talk mechanism between ET-1 and SCF-mediated signaling in human melanocytes because each of those specific signaling pathways has been associated with the physiological stimulation of melanogenesis (16Imokawa G. Yada Y. Kimura M. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The aim of our present study was to evaluate the mechanisms by which ET signaling activates MAPK and its underlying synergism with SCF. We now report that the synergistic cross-talk between SCF and ET-1 signaling is initiated through the pathway of trans-activation of c-kit, including its enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation, during the SCF-induced activation process. This results in an increase in the formation of the Shc-Grb2 complex, which leads in turn to synergistic activation of the Ras/Raf-1/MEK/MAP kinase loop. NHMC were obtained from Morinaga Co. Endothelin derivatives were purchased from Sigma. Anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (New York), αERK1/2, α-phospho-specific ERK1/2, αMEK, α-phospho-specific antibodies from New England Labs Inc., α−c-kit and αGRB2 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotech. Inc., and α-Shc antibodies and anti-phosphotyrosine (clone RC20) from Transduction Lab. All other chemicals were of reagent grade. NHMC were maintained in modified MCDB 153 growth medium supplemented with 1 ng/ml recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor, 5 μg/ml insulin, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 10 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, antibiotics (50 μg/ml gentamycin and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B), 0.5% fetal calf serum, and 0.2% bovine pituitary extract at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. In experiments to evaluate cellular effects or signaling changes, NHMC were seeded in culture trays at a density of 5–8 × 104 cells/ml, and were cultured in keratinocyte-SFM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing bovine pituitary extract for 48 h, then treated with reagents at various concentrations. NHMC cultured in 96-well trays were incubated with ET-1 and/or SCF at concentrations of 0 to 100 nm. Twenty hours later, the cells were labeled for 4 h with 1.0 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were trypsinized and harvested on a glass fiber filter, washed three times with distilled water, and twice with ice-cold ethanol, then dried. The radioactivity on the filter was directly measured using MATRIX 96 (Packard Bioscience Co.). These techniques were performed as reported previously (2Yada Y. Higuchi K. Imokawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18352-18357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, for IP3 assay, cells were seeded in 24-well culture trays at a density of 3 × 104-105 cells/ml and cultured for 24–48 h. The media were aspirated and the MCDB 153 medium containing 10 mm LiCl was added and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C before stimulation. The ligand stimulation was terminated at designed times by adding 10% perchloric acid and the samples were kept on ice for 15 min. After neutralization with ice-cold 1.5 m KOH for 60 min on ice, the samples were centrifuged at 2,000 ×g for 10 min to remove KClO4 precipitate. The supernatants (100 μl each) were subjected to IP3 assay using the IP3 assay kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) (2Yada Y. Higuchi K. Imokawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18352-18357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The content of IP3 in each sample was quantitatively determined from a calibration curve established using the binding protein specific for IP3 and [3H]IP3. Cells were incubated with ET-1 and/or SCF in 60-mm diameter culture dishes, then solubilized in 500 μl of ice-cold RIPA (radioimmunoprecipitation) buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% Na deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mg/ml aprotinin. The mixtures were sonicated briefly and centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations in the supernatants were determined by the BCAassay kit(Pierce Chemical Co.). These techniques were performed as reported previously (25Sakai C. Ollmann M. Kobayashi T. Muller J. Vieira D. Imokawa G. Barsh G.S. Hearing V.J.

Lysates (20 μg/lane) or immunoprecipitated complex were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to Immobilon-P PVDF membranes (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany). Membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (TBS-T) buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.14 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 3 h at room temperature, and then probed with primary antibodies in TBS-T buffer. After washing, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h, and signals were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). These techniques were performed as reported previously (27Kobayashi T. Urabe K. Winder A. Jimenez-Cervantes C. Imokawa G. Brewington T. Solano F. Garcia-Borron J.C. Hearing V.C.

The resultant immune complexes were then precipitated by incubation with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellets were washed three times with RIPA buffer, once with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20%(v/v) glycerol, 4% (w/v) SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue), and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Immunoprecipitated and associated proteins were detected with immunoblotting as described above. Raf-1 was assayed according to the method reported previously (29Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Ashworth A. Cowley S. Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) by its ability to activate MAPK kinase, which was then assayed by the activation of MAPK (29Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Ashworth A. Cowley S. Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). An aliquot of each cell lysate was added to 5 μl of protein G-Sepharose conjugated to 1.0 μg of Raf-1 antibody (Transduction Laboratories) and was incubated for 60 min at 4 °C on a shaking platform. The suspensions were centrifuged for 1 min at 14,000 × g, the supernatants discarded, and the immunoprecipitates washed twice with 1.0 ml of buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 0.27m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and leupeptin 5 μg/ml), twice with 1.0 ml of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.03% Brij 35, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol) and then assayed as described below. Eighteen μl of buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 25 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm PKC inhibitor peptide (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), 0.5 mm PKA inhibitor peptide (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), 5 mm compound R24571 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), 20 mm magnesium chloride, and 0.13 mm ATP) containing 0.2 μg of glutathioneS-transferase-MAPKK1 and 0.7 μg of glutathioneS-transferase-MAPK was added to immunoprecipitates by Raf-1 antibody and, after incubation for 30 min at 30 °C on a shaking platform, a 2-μl aliquot was added to 15 μl of 20 mmMOPS (pH 7.2), 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 25 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, MBP (0.67 mg/ml), 25 mm magnesium chloride, and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (∼1000 Ci/mmol). After incubation for 10 min at 30 °C, the incorporation of phosphate into MBP was determined by autoradiography of MBP separated with SDS-PAGE. When ET-1 and SCF are concomitantly added at constant and varied concentrations, respectively, there is a synergistic stimulation of DNA synthesis in NHMC (Fig.1). At ET-1 and SCF concentrations of 10 nm each, a marked synergistic stimulation of DNA synthesis is elicited with a 62-fold increase relative to the 1.2- and 7.2-fold increases elicited by SCF or ET-1 treatments alone, respectively. In order to clarify whether the activation of MAPK is mediated via the endothelin-binding ETA or ETBreceptor, we looked at the effect of endothelin A and B receptor antagonists, BQ610 and BQ788, respectively, on the tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK2, a hallmark of MAPK activation as assessed by Western blotting using a phosphotyrosine antibody following immunoprecipitation with anti-ERK2. The ETB receptor antagonist BQ788 completely abolishes endothelin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK2 whereas the ETA receptor antagonist BQ610 fails to inhibit the phosphorylation (Fig.2), indicating that the activation of MAPK is mediated through the endothelin B receptor. The addition of 1 μg/ml pertussis toxin abolishes tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK2 (Fig. 3), showing that the Giprotein is associated with endothelin-induced signaling leading to the activation of MAP kinase. Similarly, the phospholipase C inhibitor,U73122, down-regulates tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4), indicating that phospholipase C is also involved in the activation of MAPK during the intracellular signaling initiated by ET and ETB receptor binding. The addition of the calcium chelator, BAPTA, has no effect on the phosphorylation of ERK2 (Fig. 5), showing there is no involvement of calcium mobilization in the activation of MAPK. In contrast, the PKC inhibitor, calphostine, abolishes the phosphorylation of ERK2 (Fig. 6), indicating that activation of PKC is required for the activation of MAPK.Figure 3Pertussis toxin abolishes the tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK2.

In the evaluation of tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK-1 and -2, an indicator of MAPK activation, as assessed by Western blotting using phosphotyrosine antibodies following immunoprecipitation with anti-ERK-1 and -2, we found that there is a synergistic effect on tyrosine phosphorylation in ET-1 + SCF-treated NHMC compared with ET-1 or SCF alone. There were increases both in the duration and intensity of tyrosine phosphorylation, which reached a peak within 10 min after stimulation (Fig. 8). In the evaluation of serine phosphorylation of MEK, an indicator of MAPKK activation, as assessed by Western blotting using a phospho-specific MEK antibody, there is a synergistic effect in SCF + ET-1-treated melanocytes with a peak within 4 min after stimulation (Fig.9). This indicates that the synergy in the activation of MAPKK precedes the observed synergy in MAPK activation in SCF + ET-1-treated NHMC. Analysis of Raf-1 activity, an indicator of MAPKKK, as assessed by the final phosphorylation of MBP, showed that 10 nm ET-1 significantly stimulates Raf-1 activity, which indicates that Raf-1 is at least one convergence point from the PKC pathway to the MAPK pathway. Furthermore, there is a synergistic effect on Raf-1 activity in SCF + ET-1-treated melanocytes (Fig. 10), suggesting the possibility that the synergistic convergence between SCF and ET-1 signaling is located nearby Raf-1.Figure 9Synergistic effect on serine phosphorylation of MEK1/2.

Since Shc involvement in this signaling pathway requires tyrosyl phosphorylation, we compared the effects of SCF only and SCF + ET-1 on tyrosyl phosphorylation of Shc proteins in NHMC. Western blotting with phosphotyrosine antibodies following immunoprecipitation with Shc antibodies (Fig. 11) demonstrates that stimulation with SCF + ET-1 induces a more rapid and a stronger tyrosyl phosphorylation of proteins corresponding to p52 (1.2-fold in densitometric intensity) and p66 Shc than is elicited with SCF alone, and that this reaches a maximum (p52: 2.0-fold in densitometric intensity) within 5 min after stimulation. Upon activation of tyrosine kinase receptors, tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc associates with Grb2 and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS, thereby leading to Ras activation. Therefore, we next examined whether the association of tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc with Grb2 also becomes synergistically marked following treatment with SCF + ET-1 as compared with SCF only. As shown in Fig. 12, more distinct bands corresponding to p52 and p66 Shc are observed in immunoprecipitates from SCF + ET-1-treated melanocytes than from a single SCF stimulation. This shows that upon SCF + ET-1 stimulation, Grb2 associates more strongly in a complex with increased amounts of tyrosyl-phosphorylated Shc than it does upon a single SCF stimulation.Figure 12Synergistic effect on the association of tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc with Grb2. Human melanocytes were stimulated for 2 min with 10 nm ET-1 and/or 10 nm SCF.

Time course experiments assessed by Western blotting (Fig. 13) reveal a rapid and more marked tyrosine phosphorylation of c-kit, which reaches a maximum within 5 min after stimulation, with SCF + ET-1 compared with SCF only. In contrast, a single ET-1 stimulation does not elicit any tyrosine phosphorylation of c-kit, a finding which strongly suggests that ET-1 and ETB receptor binding initiated signaling stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of c-kit only under conditions where c-kit is activated by SCF binding to its receptor. In human melanocytes, it is well established that, after binding to its receptor, ET-1 triggers hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositide, which generates IP3 and diacylglycerol, mobilizing intracellular Ca2+ and activating PKC, respectively, which then stimulate proliferation and melanization (2Yada Y. Higuchi K. Imokawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18352-18357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Imokawa G. Yada Y. Kimura M. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In addition to the PKC pathway, ET has recently been shown to also activate the MAPK cascade in human melanocytes (16Imokawa G. Yada Y. Kimura M. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In other types of cells, such as cardiomyocytes of neonatal rats, a similar activation of MAPK by ET-1 has been reported in relation to mechanical stress-induced cardiac hypertrophy (30Yamazaki T. Issei-Komuro I. Kudoh Sm Zou Y. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T. Maemura K. Kurihara H. Aikawa R. Takano H. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3221-3228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which the Giprotein-coupled ET receptor activates the MAPK cascade is still poorly characterized. The site at which the PKC pathway stimulated by ET signaling enters the tyrosine kinase pathway (including the MAPK cascade) remains to be elucidated in human melanocytes. Such an understanding would provide a basis for cross-talk mechanisms between ET-1 and SCF initiated signaling. Therefore, we have attempted to determine whether the ET signaling cascade, which consists of its receptor binding, G protein, phospholipase C, calcium mobilization, and PKC activation is really associated with the activation of MAPK. The present study demonstrates clearly that ET activates Erk1/2 in a time-dependent manner in NHMC that express the ETB receptor and that the ET-induced activation of Erk1/2 is independent of calcium mobilization, but is largely associated with the PKC pathway via binding to ETB receptor, Giprotein, and the activation of phospholipase C. This strongly suggests that activation of MAPK is involved in the molecular mechanism associated with protein-coupled receptors. In contrast to another study which showed that the formation of the Shc-Grb2 complex can be mediated by G protein activation by ET-1 in astrocytes (31Cazaubon S.M. Ramos-Morales F. Fischer S. Schweighoffer F. Strosberg A.D. Couraud P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24805-24809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we found that Erk1/2 activation by ET alone was not accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and the formation of Shc-Grb2 complexes, whereas the prior sequential activation of MEK and Raf-1 were detectable. Since in other cells, Raf-1 is reported to be a target for PKC (32Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R.

Lovric J. Philipp A. Mischak H. Kolch W. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2921-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), Raf-1 activation, probably via serine/threonine phosphorylation which modifies its catalytic activity, appears to be a convergent point between the PKC and MAPK pathways. Regarding the association between those two pathways, the sum of the above findings indicate that activation of MAPK during the ET signaling pathway is mediated through ETB receptor/Gi protein/phospholipase C/PKC and the Raf-1 loop. SCF and ET-1 binding initiated intracellular signaling that leads to melanization and cell growth of NHMC are transmitted by two major classes of cell surface receptors, tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors (38Rottapel R. Reedijk M. Williams D.E. Lyman S.D. Anderson D.M. Pawson T. Bernstein A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3043-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and G protein-coupled receptors (16Imokawa G. Yada Y. Kimura M. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), respectively. Therefore, it is of interest to determine which signaling pathway is responsible for this synergistic effect. At first, we assumed that the convergence between ET-1 and SCF signaling occurs at the activation of MAPK, because we had previously found that ET-1-induced stimulation of melanization and proliferation in NHMC is associated with the activation of MAPK, a pathway very similar to that mediated by SCF (21Cutler R.L. Liu L. Damen J.E. Krystal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21463-21465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lennartsson J. Blume-Jensen P. Hermanson M. Ponten E. Carlberg M. Ronnstrand L.

In this connection, Western blotting using tyrosyl MAPK antibodies demonstrates that the activation of MAPK occurs synergistically between SCF and ET-1-initiated signaling. Similar synergisms to the activation of MAPK have been reported between ET-1 and angiotensin II in cultured cardiomyocytes (30Yamazaki T. Issei-Komuro I. Kudoh Sm Zou Y. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y.

Zhao Z. Blood. 1998; 92: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in relation to mechanical stress-induced cardiac hypertrophy and expanded erythropoiesis, respectively. Since MAPK activation is generally accompanied by the prior sequential activation of MEK and Raf-1 (40Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar), we determined whether the synergism in the activation of MAPK is reflected by the synergistic activation of MEK and Raf-1. Related experiments using Western blotting and kinase assays revealed that there is a sequential synergistic activation in the MAPK cascade consisting of Raf-1, MEKK, MEK, and MAPK. This suggests that the convergence point between ET-1 and SCF-initiated signaling is located upstream of Raf-1. As we confirmed a role for Raf-1 in the cross-talk mechanism between ET-1-associated PKC and SCF-associated tyrosine kinase pathways, we next determined signaling mechanisms leading to the synergistic Raf-1 activation by examining the influence of SCF on the ET-1-dependent PKC pathway. The formation of IP3 following stimulation is a hallmark for evaluation of PKC activation because IP3 and the protein kinase C activator, diacylglycerol, are simultaneously generated at an equimolar ratios. The time course of formation of IP3 following SCF and ET-1 treatment revealed that there is no difference in the raised level of IP3 induced by ET-1 + SCF or ET-1 alone, indicating no synergy occurs in the PKC pathway. The mechanism of tyrosine kinase receptor-stimulated mitogenic signaling involves the formation between complexes of the guanine nucleotide exchange protein SOS, and the SH2 and SH3 domain-containing adaptor protein Grb2 with another tyrosine-phosphorylated adaptor protein Shc (21Cutler R.L. Liu L. Damen J.E. Krystal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21463-21465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lennartsson J. Blume-Jensen P. Hermanson M. Ponten E. Carlberg M. Ronnstrand L.

Recent studies have shown that some G protein-coupled receptors utilize the same effectors as the tyrosine kinase receptor pathway (e.g. Shc-Grb-SOS), resulting in Ras and MAPK activation (41Dabrowski A.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9284-9287Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, it has been suggested that the pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi-coupled receptors utilize a pathway that induces Ras activation in a PKC-independent manner (44Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Koch W.J.

In this study, the synergism between ET-1 and SCF was found to be accompanied by synergistic tyrosyl phosphorylation of proteins corresponding to p52 and p66 Shc, leading to synergistic association of tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc with Grb2. It has also been shown that ET-1 signaling through heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors stimulates MAPK activity in primary cultures of astrocytes (46Cazaubon S. Parker P.J. Strosberg A.D. Couraud P.O. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) via an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, which is followed by its stable association with Grb2 (31Cazaubon S.M. Ramos-Morales F. Fischer S. Schweighoffer F. Strosberg A.D. Couraud P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24805-24809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Those studies suggested that ET-1-induced MAPK activation is a G protein-coupled pathway that involves Shc, Grb2, and probably Raf-1. Thus, the Shc-Grb2 complex may be involved in activation of the MAPK pathway, not only by several receptor tyrosine kinases but also by heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors, such as ET-1 receptors. In contrast to those studies using astrocytes, our study using human melanocytes showed that ET-1 does not stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with Grb2 even at its mitogenic and melanogenic concentrations. Interestingly, Western blotting analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation of c-kit upstream of Shc-Grb2 association revealed that this synergistic activation with adaptor molecules is initiated by the synergistic tyrosine phosphorylation of the SCF receptor, c-kit. Again, it should be noted that in human melanocytes the combination of ET-1 and SCF (but not ET-1 alone) enhances tyrosine phosphorylation of c-kit. A similar activation of receptor tyrosine kinases through intracellular signal cross-talk with ET-1-associated G-protein-coupled receptors has been documented for the epidermal growth factor receptor of Rat-1 cells (47Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar) and of smooth muscle cells (48Iwasaki H. Eguchi S. Ueno H. Marumo F. Hirata Y. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4659-4668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in which only ET-1 can stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor. In conclusion, the sum of the above findings indicates that synergistic cross-talk between SCF and ET-1 signaling is initiated through the pathway of tyrosine phosphorylation of c-kit. This results in the synergistically enhanced formation of Shc-Grb2 complex, which leads to the synergistic activation of the Ras/Raf-1/MEK/MAPK loop. ET-1 associated activation of PKC probably plays a role in the enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-kit although the detailed mechanism is not clear. Thus, our results demonstrate a role for the c-kit tyrosine kinase receptor as a downstream mediator in synergistic mitogenic signaling induced by ET-1 + SCF and suggest a ligand-independent mechanism for c-kit activation through a synergistic intracellular signal cross-talk."

For example, anti-H hemagglutinins or fucose-specific lectins (fucolectins) have been found in eel serum and extracts of certain plant seeds and widely used for blood typing (4Jonsson B. Acta Pathol.

Reflecting these needs, a variety of lectins with different specificities are now commercially available including the above mentioned fucolectins (i.e. eel serum lectins, asparagus seed lectins, and gorsethree seed lectins). Concerning the eel serum lectins, however, their structures have not been determined. Determination of their cellular origin is also crucial for understanding their physiological significance. While attempting to identify proteins specifically expressed in either freshwater or seawater eels, we cloned a group of 20-kDa proteins from seawater eels and named them osmoregulins, but later they turned out to be fucose-binding lectins present in both freshwater and seawater eels and considered to play important roles against microbial invasion. A literature survey indicated that, although eel fucolectins have a long history of research and practical applications (4Jonsson B. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Scand.

Steril. 1996; 65: 843-851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), their primary structures have not been determined yet. We therefore decided to isolate corresponding cDNA clones. Characterization of the clones indicated that the fucolectins are a group of proteins with at least seven members. This heterogeneity or multiplicity may have evolved to provide a means for effective defense against a wide variety of pathogenic bacteria and appears to be consistent with their primary functions in innate immunity (1Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway C.A. Ezekowitz R.A. Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis and immunohistochemistry suggested that 1) eel serum fucolectins are of hepatic origin and 2) gill mucus cells also produce fucolectins in an exocrine fashion. A data base search revealed the presence of an interesting molecule in Drosophila, a chimeric protein of fucolectin and selectin. Japanese eels (Anguilla japonica) were obtained from a dealer and blood was collected from the ventral aorta or caudal vein into tubes containing 0.5 m EDTA (final concentration, 10 mm), which was then centrifuged to obtain plasma. Immobilized pH gradient (IPG)1 polyacrylamide gel or Immobiline DryStrip (13 cm) and IPG buffer (pH 4–7) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane was from Millipore; lysyl endopeptidase Achromobacterprotease I was from Takara, Kyoto, Japan; l-fucose agarose was from Seikagaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan; Radiochemicals were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Eel plasma proteins were precipitated with three volumes of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid in acetone containing 0.07% 2-mercaptoethanol. After incubation at −20 °C for 1 h, pellets were collected by centrifugation and washed with cold acetone containing 0.07% 2-mercaptoethanol. Air-dried pellets were dissolved in rehydration solution containing 8m urea, 2% CHAPS, 2% IPG buffer, bromphenol blue, and 65 mm dithiothreitol. An IPG strip was rehydrated overnight at room temperature in 250 μl of rehydration solution containing plasma proteins extracted from 100 μl of eel plasma. It was then subjected to isoelectric focusing in a Multiphor II system with an EPS 3500 XL electrophoresis power supply (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The gel was run with the following voltage program: pre-focusing at 300 V for 1 min and focusing at 3500 V for 16 h. After soaking in equilibration buffer (1% SDS, 35% glycerol, 1% dithiothreitol, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) for 10 min, the gel strip was loaded on a second-dimension 12.5% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The amino acid sequences of protease-digested fragments of the protein were determined by the method of Iwamatsu et al. (17Iwamatsu A. Yoshida-Kubomura N. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Following two-dimensional electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, separated proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The spots corresponding to the proteins of interest were cut, reduced, and digested with the lysyl endopeptidaseAchromobacter protease I (Takara, Kyoto, Japan), and the fragments released (AP fragments) were collected. The peptides remaining on the membrane were further incubated with trypsin (Takara), and the digests (TP fragments) were collected. The proteolytic fragments generated were separated by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography on a μBondasphere column (5-μm C18; 100 Å, 3.9 × 150 mm, Waters) using a linear gradient generated between solvents A (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in water) and B (0.02% trifluoroacetic acid in 2-propanol/acetonitrile (7:3, v/v)) in 30 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and applied to a gas-phase peptide sequencer (PPSQ-21, Shimadzu) for their amino acid sequences. For the determination of the N-terminal sequences, proteins were sequenced directly from the PVDF blots. To isolate a partial cDNA probe, PCR amplification was performed using eel gill and liver cDNA as templates using ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara) and the following oligonucleotide primers: 5′-CCNAAYMGNTAYATHCARGARAAYGT-3′ (S1, sense primer corresponding to the N-terminal sequence), and 5′-TTNGGNARRTANACNGTNAC-3′ (AS2, antisense probe corresponding to tryptic fragment 2 (TP-2) in Fig. 3). The PCR was run for 35 cycles by repeating denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 45 °C for 1 min, and polymerization at 72 °C for 2 min. A specific PCR product of 360 bp was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified, and subcloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript II (Stratagene) and sequenced.Figure 3Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of eel fucolectin cDNA.

Takashima A. Kashiwagi M. Hagiwara H. Takei Y. Hirose S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For construction of a liver cDNA library, total RNA was prepared from eel livers by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method and mRNA was isolated using an oligo(dT)-cellulose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). An eel liver cDNA library was constructed in λZAP II phage vector (Stratagene) using an oligo(dT) primer and other reagents from the SuperScript Choice System (Life Technologies, Inc.). Approximately 2 × 105 recombinant phage were obtained. The eel gill and liver cDNA libraries were plated out at a density of 3 × 104 plaque-forming units/150-mm plate. Plaques were lifted onto nitrocellulose filters (Shleicher & Schuell), and the filters were prehybridized in 5× SSPE (SSPE: 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm phosphate, pH 7.4), 50% formaldehyde, 5× Denhardt's solution (Denhardt's: 0.1% each Ficoll, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and bovine serum albumin), and 0.5% SDS for 2 h at 42 °C. The above cDNA probe was labeled with [32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol) using random primers. Hybridization was performed for 16 h at 42 °C in the same solution. Ten and five positive clones were isolated from the gill and liver cDNA libraries, respectively. Total RNA was isolated from various tissues of eel by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method. Total RNA (5 μg or 20 μg) was electrophoresed in 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to Magna MT nylon membrane (Micron Separations) by capillary blotting overnight. Eel fucolectin and β-actin cDNAs were labeled with [α-32P]CTP using random primers and hybridized in 6× SSPE, 50% formaldehyde, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 1% SDS for 16 h at 42 °C. After hybridization, membrane was washed twice with 2× SSC (SSC: 0.15m NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0) and 0.1% SDS at room temperature, washed with 1× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 1 h at 55 °C and twice with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 1 h at 55 °C, and exposed to imaging plate (Fuji Film) in a cassette for 1 week. The result was analyzed using a Fujix BAS2000 bio-imaging analyzer (Fuji Film). Five micrograms of eel genomic DNA were digested with restriction enzymes (BamHI,BglII, EcoRI, EcoRV,HindIII, KpnI, and PstI), separated in a 1.0% agarose gel, and transferred to the Hybond N+membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was prehybridized in PerfectHyb hybridization solution (Toyobo) at 68 °C for 1 h. The full-length eel fucolectin cDNA was labeled with [α-32P]CTP using random primers and hybridized in the same solution at 68 °C for 16 h. The membrane was washed twice at 68 °C for 5 min with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS and once at 68 °C for 1 h with 0.5× SSC and 0.1% SDS. After washing, the membrane was exposed to imaging plate in a cassette for 1 day. The result was analyzed using a Fujix BAS2000 bio-imaging analyzer. Eel plasma (10 ml) was diluted 10 times with TBS (0.15 m NaCl, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and filtered through a 0.22-μm filter (Millex-GV, Millipore). The diluted plasma was applied to a column containing l-fucose agarose (5 ml), and washed with 10 volumes of TBS. The bound eel serum fucolectin was eluted with 50 mml-fucose in TBS and dialyzed against three changes of 150 mm NaCl. Purified eel fucolectin was applied to a Superdex 75 (HR 10/30, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and equilibrated with TBS at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Reference proteins for molecular weight determination were transferrin (M r = 81,000), ovalbumin (43,000), chymotrypsinogen A (25,000), and RNase (13,700). Antiserum to eel fucolectin was prepared in a Japanese White rabbit. The purified eel serum fucolectin was emulsified with TiterMax Gold adjuvant (CytRx Corp.) and injected intramuscularly three times. Eel gill was homogenized in five volumes of TBS and aliquots were dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8); eel plasma was diluted 1:100 with Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE using 12.5% acrylamide gel and electroblotted to a PVDF membrane. After blocking in 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 5% nonfat milk for 30 min at room temperature, the membranes were incubated with anti-fucolectin antiserum, preimmune serum, or preabsorbed antiserum at 1:1000 dilution overnight at 4 °C. Preabsorption was carried out by incubating 10 μl of the antiserum with 40 μg of purified fucolectin in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C. The immune complexes on the filter were then reacted with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG at 1:3000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. The bound secondary antibody was detected with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium chloride as chromogenic substrate. Eels were acclimated in a 1-ton freshwater tank for more than 1 week before use. Seawater eels were acclimated in a 0.5-ton seawater tank for more than 2 weeks. Water in the tank was continuously filtered, aerated, and thermo-regulated at 18 ± 0.5 °C. Eels were not fed after purchase. They weighed 190 ± 20 g (n = 5) at the time of experiments. Eels were cannulated into the ventral aorta for injections and blood sampling. After anesthesia in 0.1% tricaine methanesulfonate for 10 min, a polyethylene tube (outer diameter, 0.8 mm) was inserted into the ventral aorta as reported previously (19Takei Y. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1988; 91A: 293-297Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The catheters in the aorta were connected to plastic syringes filled with 0.9% NaCl solution. After more than 18 h post-operatively, eels were injected with LPS (20 μg/eel/0.2 ml of saline), and the catheter was flushed with 50 μl of saline. A small volume of blood (150 μl) was collected before and 1, 3, 6, and 10 h after injection into a chilled syringe containing 10 μl/ml blood of 2Na-EDTA. Isolation and culture of eel hepatocytes were carried out according to Hayashi and Ooshiro (20Hayashi S. Ooshiro Z. Bull. Jpn. Soc. Sci. Fish. 1985; 51: 765-771Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and Hayashi and Komatsu (21Hayashi S. Komatsu M. Doyle A. Griffiths J.B. Newell D.G. Cell & Tissue Culture. John Wiley & Sons, New York1998: 23A:2.1-23A:2.10Google Scholar). Liver was excised from an anesthetized eel and perfused with Ca2+-free Ringer solution (120 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.4 mmCaCl2, 1.25 mm MgSO4, and 23 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.4), Ringer solution containing collagenase (15 mg/50 ml) at room temperature for 30 min, and then Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Ringer solution containing 2 mm EDTA. The liver was minced with scissors and filtrated through a 200-mesh grid. Filtrated liver cells were collected by centrifugation at 50 × g for 1.5 min, resuspended with Ringer solution, and centrifuged again. This washing procedure was repeated three times. Isolated cells were seeded on a polyl-lysine-coated dish (55 cm2, Iwaki) at a density of 3 × 105 cells/cm2 and incubated at 28 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Medium consisted of William's E medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 0.16 μm insulin from bovine pancreas, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. The medium was changed to a fresh one after 2 days and the culture was further continued for 3 days before LPS treatment. After the 3-day culture mentioned above, LPS (final concentration, 1 μg/ml) was added to the medium, and 20 μl of medium was collected every 3 h and analyzed for secreted fucolectin levels by Western blotting. At 6-h intervals over a 24-h period, cells were harvested and analyzed for fucolectin mRNA levels by Northern blotting. Eel gill and liver were fixed in 0.1m phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, and frozen in Tissue-Tek OCT compound. Frozen sections were cut in a cryostat, washed in TBS containing 1 mm CaCl2, and fixed in methanol containing 3% H2O2 to inactivate endogenous peroxidase for 30 min at room temperature and washed again in TBS containing 1 mm CaCl2. The sections were incubated with 2% (v/v) normal goat serum for 30 min at room temperature, then with anti-eel fucolectin antiserum, preimmune serum, or preabsorbed antiserum at 1:1000 (liver) or 1:5000 (gill) dilution overnight at room temperature, and treated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG and the avidin-biotin-conjugated peroxidase (Vectastain Elite ABC kit; Vector Laboratories) for 1 h each at room temperature. The bound antibodies were visualized using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and 0.02% H2O2 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. When plasma samples of a freshwater eel and a seawater eel were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, a band of −20 kDa was found to vary in its intensity between the samples (Fig.1 A). Although later analysis using an increased number of samples indicated that this variance is due to individual difference rather than the osmolarity difference, we were interested in its nature and decided to determine the N-terminal amino acid sequence. Sequencing of the 20-kDa band, after transferring it to PVDF membrane, gave multiple peaks of phenylthiohydantoin-amino acids in each Edman degradation cycle, indicating that it represents a mixture of proteins of the same size. We therefore performed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to separate the constituents of the 20-kDa band according to their isoelectric points (Fig. 1 B) and sequenced three major spots of 20 kDa. Two of them (spots a and b) gave the same N-terminal sequence (ADVPNRYIQENVAVRGKATQ, Fig. 3) and the third one (spot c), a slightly different sequence (ADIPEGYIQENVALRGRATQ). We further obtained internal amino acid sequences by digesting spot awith trypsin or lysyl-endospecific Achromobacter protease I, isolating the proteolytic fragments by high performance liquid chromatography, and sequencing them (Fig. 3, AP-1,TP-1, and TP-2). Several combinations of PCR primers were designed based on the above amino acid sequence information and used for amplification of cDNA encoding the 20-kDa protein. One combination (primers AS2 and S1 described under “Experimental Procedures”) yielded a prominent PCR band of −360 bp from gill and liver cDNA, whose identity was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing, namely the amino acid sequence deduced contained the sequence corresponding to that of tryptic fragment 1. Fig. 2 shows Northern blots of eel total RNA prepared from various eel tissues and probed with the PCR product labeled with 32P. A very strong signal was seen in the liver sample and weak signals, in the gill and intestine preparations. The gill message appeared to be longer (−850 nucleotides) than that of the liver (700–850 nucleotides). We therefore decided to screen, as described below, both liver and gill cDNA libraries for full-length cDNA clones. cDNA libraries were constructed from liver and gill poly(A)+ RNA and screened with the same probe used for the Northern analysis. Fifteen positive clones were isolated and sequenced (Figs.3 and 4). Sequence analysis revealed the presence of seven types of clones that code for similar but distinct proteins of −180 amino acid residues (Fig. 4): three clones from the liver (eFL-1–3) and four from the gill (eFL-4–7). Their nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were deposited into the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™ data base (accession nos.AB037867–AB037873), one of which is shown in Fig. 3 as a typical example. The cDNA clones from the eel liver and gill were mutually exclusive, suggesting that they are encoded by a separated group of genes whose promoters are active in either liver cells or gill cells. Most of the cDNA clones were almost identical in their length of the 5′-noncoding region but differed in that of the 3′-noncoding region, providing an explanation for the difference in the mRNA size seen in the Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2). The overall sequence similarities among the seven proteins are about 70% but they shared a highly conserved core sequence of about 11 amino acids (residues 98–108, Fig. 4). A data base search indicated that the nucleotide and amino acid sequences determined here are weakly but significantly similar to those of tachylectin-4 (22Saito T. Hatada M. Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30703-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), a horseshoe crab lectin with binding specificity to O-antigen of bacterial lipopolysaccharides, to the N-terminal domain of the Xenopus homologue of pentraxin 1, XL-PXN1, which consists of the N-terminal domain of unknown function and the C-terminal pentraxin domain (23Seery L.T. Schoenberg D.R. Barbaux S. Sharp P.M. Whitehead A.S. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1993; 253: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and to the N-terminal domain ofDrosophila fw protein whose C-terminal domain is similar to selectin (Fig. 4, gray boxes in lower four lines; Fig. 10). This similarity raised the possibility that the −20-kDa proteins cloned here are the eel serum lectins known as anti-H hemagglutinins (4Jonsson B. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Scand.

We therefore characterized the −20-kDa proteins and established their identities as eel fucolectins as described below. To confirm the identity of the −20-kDa proteins as fucolectins, we first performed affinity chromatography of eel serum on fucose-agarose (Fig.5 A). When eel serum was applied to a fucose-agarose column, the −20-kDa proteins were specifically bound to and eluted from the column. The molecular size of the eluate was estimated to be −80 kDa by gel filtration on Superdex 75 (data not shown). On mild SDS-PAGE (i.e. without reduction and heat treatment), it migrated as a band of −80 kDa (Fig.5 B, lane 6); on heat treatment, it gave a band of −40 kDa (lane 5); and on reduction, its size was further reduced to −20 kDa (lane 4). These results are essentially identical to those reported by previous investigators (11Horejsi V. Kocourek J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 538: 215-299Google Scholar, 13Kelly C. Biochem. J. 1984; 220: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) in the binding specificity to fucose and the tetrameric subunit structure consisting of two noncovalently associated dimers whose constituent monomers are linked by disulfide bonds ((20 kDa)-SS-(20 kDa))2. Furthermore, the partial N-terminal sequence of eel lectin determined by Horejsi et al. (11Horejsi V. Kocourek J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 538: 215-299Google Scholar) and Kelly (13Kelly C. Biochem. J. 1984; 220: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) is very similar to one of our sequences (Fig. 4). We therefore named the −20-kDa proteins “eel fucolectin-1 to −7.” A unique property we found is that the tetrameric structure of eel fucolectins is very stable and persists even in the presence of SDS if not heated (Fig.5 B, lane 6). Total Southern blot showed multiple bands even under highly stringent conditions using fucolectin-5 cDNA as a probe (Fig. 6). The multiple bands seen in Fig. 6 are consistent with the fact that there are at least seven closely related members in the eel fucolectin family. Serum and glandular lectins play important roles in innate immunity by directly binding to pathogenic bacteria and usually do not undergo large changes in their levels. We were, however, interested in whether the plasma levels of eel fucolectins increase during bacterial infections since we observed, at the initial stage of this study, large variations in their levels in individual eels. To determine the changes, catheters were inserted into the ventral aorta for blood sampling and LPS injection. Blood samples were collected at 0, 1, 3, 6, and 10 h after LPS treatment, and the fucolectin levels were determined by measuring the density of the 20-kDa band on SDS-PAGE. Results were, however, negative; in four eels having low or high levels of fucolectins, no significant changes were observed (data not shown). We next determined the effects of LPS on the expression of the fucolectin genes using primary culture of eel hepatocytes since the lack of response mentioned above might be due to effective inactivation of the infused LPS by circulating fucolectins. Hepatocytes were prepared from eel livers by collagenase digestion, mechanical dispersion, and passage through a mesh. Time course of their response to LPS was followed by measuring the amounts of fucolectins accum"

Expression of the yeastGSH1 gene, encoding the first enzyme involved in glutathione biosynthesis, γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, is regulated by oxidants and the heavy metal cadmium at the level of transcription. We present evidence that the transcription factors involved in controlling the network of sulfur amino acid metabolism genes are also responsible for regulating GSH1 expression in response to cadmium.

Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5947) Google Scholar). Glutathione can act as as a free radical scavenger, with the redox-active sulfhydryl group reacting with oxidants to produce oxidized glutathione (GSSG). In response to oxidative stress caused by compounds such as H2O2 and superoxide anion-generating agents (for example menadione), the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae induces stress responses that result in protection against subsequent toxic levels of oxidants (2Jamieson D.J.

In addition to its role as an antioxidant, there is also evidence that glutathione can act as a storage compound for both sulfur and nitrogen (11Elskens M.T. Jaspers C.J. Penninckx M.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Mehdi K. Penninckx M.J. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 1885-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It is also apparent that much of the regulation of the oxidative adaptive stress responses in yeast appears to be at the level of transcription (4Jamieson D.J. Rivers S.L. Stephen D.W.S. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 3277-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 13Stephen D.W.S. Rivers S.L. Jamieson D.J. Mol.

We have previously demonstrated (13Stephen D.W.S. Rivers S.L. Jamieson D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) that exposure of yeast cells to oxidants results in an increase in the steady state level of GSH1 mRNA, which encodes γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, the first enzyme in the GSH biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, expression of the GSH1gene has also been shown to be dependent upon the transcription factor Yap1 (13Stephen D.W.S. Rivers S.L. Jamieson D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 16Wu A.-L. Moye-Rowlely W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of the gene encoding yeast glutathione reductase (GLR1) has also been shown to be regulated by oxidants and dependent upon the Yap1 protein (17Grant C.M. Collinson L.P. Roe J.-H. Dawes I.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The pattern of gene expression controlled by the Yap1 protein has also been investigated using microarrays and high resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (18DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. O'Brown P. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3690) Google Scholar, 19Godon C. Lagniel G. Lee J. Buhler J.-M. Kieffer S. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Toledano M. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22480-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). We reported that GSH1 gene expression was also inducible by the heavy metal cadmium (20Stephen D.W.S. Jamieson D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Glutathione is known to be important in countering cadmium toxicity; indeed, gsh1 mutants are hypersensitive to cadmium (21Glaeser H. Coblenz A. Kruczek R. Ruttke I. Ebert-Jung A. Wolf K. Curr. Genet. 1991; 19: 207-213Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22Kistler M. Summer K.H. Eckardt F. Mutat. Res. 1986; 173: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Moreover, yap1 mutants are defective in regulation ofGSH1 expression and are also sensitive to cadmium (16Wu A.-L. Moye-Rowlely W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wemmie J.A. Wu A.-L. Harshman K.D. Parker C.S. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14690-14697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is also clear evidence for a direct link between metal ions and oxidant resistance/sensitivity. Mutations in a number of genes give rise to either resistance or hypersensitivity toward toxic levels of both metal ions and oxidants, reviewed by Santoro and Thiel (6Santoro N. Thiel D.J. Hohmann S. Mager W.H. Yeast Stress Responses. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1997: 171-211Google Scholar), although exposure of yeast cells to cadmium has been demonstrated to lead to the production of reactive oxidants (24Brennan R.J. Schiestl R.H. Mutat. Res. 1996; 356: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The link between oxidant stress and metal ion homeostasis has been reinforced by the observation that, by altering metal ion homeostasis, it is possible to suppress the oxidant sensitivity of sod1 mutants (25Liu X.F. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7037-7045Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Moreover, the close link between metal ions and oxidative stress seems to make biological sense, given the role of metal ions, such as Cu+ and Fe2+, in the production of oxidants, and as a result a coordinated response to both metals and oxidant stress would be desirable. In view of the link between glutathione and cadmium, we wished to investigate the cadmium-induced regulation of GSH1expression. We have identified sequences additional to the Yap1-binding sequence in the GSH1 promoter that regulate gene expression in response to cadmium. Moreover, we show that the genes involved in regulating sulfur amino acid biosynthesis also regulate GSH1expression. Standard yeast methods and growth media were as described by Rose et al. (26Rose M.D. Winston F. Heiter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 155-159Google Scholar). SD media, containing 2% glucose (w/v), 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco) was used throughout and supplemented where indicated with 0.1% (w/v) casamino acids (Difco) or amino acids at 40 μg/ml.

To fine map the cadmium-responsive promoter regions three overlapping complementary pairs of oligonucleotides were synthesized each containing BamHI andXhoI sticky ends at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively (oligonucleotides 11 and 12, 13 and 14, and 15 and 16), and these were ligated into BglII- and XhoI-digested pyDJ75 to fuse these regions of the GSH1 promoter to the basalCYC1 promoter. Integrative vectors containing variousGSH1-lacZ gene fusions were digested withBcuI to excise the 2-μm origin of replication, gel-purified, and religated.

Yeast cells were grown aerobically at 30 °C in 500 ml of SD (plus appropriate supplements) to early exponential growth phase (A 600 = 0.1–0.2). Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed once and resuspended in 200 μl of ice-cold breaking buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol (v/v), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine HCl). Cells were lysed by vortexing with 100 μl glass beads. Binding reactions (30 μl) were performed in binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 2 μg poly(dI-dC)·(dI-dC), 1 μl of32P-labeled DNA probe (approximately 0.33 ng), and 30 μg of yeast protein extract. DNA probes were end-labeled using [γ-32P]dATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified on Sephadex G-50 spin columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In some cases probes were labeled by tailing with terminal transferase and digoxigenin-dUTP according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Binding reactions were incubated at room temperature for 15 min. For competition reactions approximately 100 times excess of unlabeled DNA probe (33.3 ng) was added to the reaction mixture. Binding reactions were electrophoresed at 4 °C on pre-run (1 h) 4% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE buffer. After electrophoresis, gels were fixed, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. In the case of digoxigenin-labeled probes, the gels were electroblotted to nylon membranes, and protein complexes were identified following chemiluminescent detection on x-ray film. Chromatin was digested by micrococcal nuclease (MNase) in permeabilized yeast spheroplasts and analyzed by indirect end labeling as described previously (29Kent N.A. Tsang J.S.H. Crowther D.J. Mellor J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5229-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The indirect end label for GSH1 was derived from a 1283-bp Alw44I/PvuI fragment (spanning −584 to +699 bp) prepared by PCR using primers 5′-TGCACACGCCTGTTACTTCT-3′ and 5′-ATCGTAGATGGAGTCATCCG-3′. The PCR product was cut with HincII to release the 339-bpPvuI/HincII probe. We had previously shown that the GSH1 gene was transcriptionally regulated by the heavy metal cadmium (20Stephen D.W.S. Jamieson D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).GSH1 expression was also shown to be dependent upon the transcription factor Yap1 (16Wu A.-L. Moye-Rowlely W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Stephen D.W.S. Jamieson D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, while characterizing theGSH1 promoter we observed that elements other than the Yap1-binding site were also required for cadmium regulation. We created a set of GSH1 promoter deletion mutations, which were fused to the non-regulated basal CYC1 promoter (to provide basal promoter function) and the reporter gene lacZ. Yeast harboring these plasmids were exposed to inducing levels of cadmium, and the level of expression was determined (Fig.1). More detailed examination revealed that the promoter fragment in plasmid pyDJ81 (−379 to −100) was capable of inducing gene expression in response to cadmium, whereas the sequence present in pyDJ80 (−343 to −100) was not (TableIII). The reduced levels of expression observed with pyDJ81 and 80, compared with pyDJ73, were found to be due to the absence of the Yap1-binding site in these constructs (−384 to −379). Notwithstanding the lower level of expression, it is evident that there is an element in the GSH1 promoter, between nucleotides −379 and −343, which is responsible for cadmium-mediated gene expression. To characterize further this cadmium-responsive element, we synthesized three pairs of oligonucleotides whose sequences divide the region between nucleotides −379 and −343 into three portions. These were then fused to the basal CYC1 promoter and the lacZ gene. Yeast containing these three plasmids were exposed to inducing levels of cadmium to determine which contained the cadmium-responsive element. All of these plasmids possessed higher basal levels of expression compared with the larger promoter fragment in pyDJ81, suggesting that a repressor element may have been deleted. Nevertheless, two of the constructs displayed cadmium-regulated gene expression (Table IV). Given the high basal levels of gene expression observed, we were concerned that the presence of the cadmium-responsive element on episomal vectors could give misleading results. To counter this possibility we integrated the constructs into the yeast genome. Essentially identical results were obtained with the integrated constructs, indicating that the cadmium-responsive element lies between nucleotides −360 and −352 (Table IV).Table IIICd-responsive element lies between nucleotides −379 and −343PlasmidRegion GSH1 promoterUnits β-galactosidase activity, treatmentNo stressCadmiumInduction-foldpyDJ79−497 to −1009.5 ± 1.237 ± 3.14pyDJ81−379 to −1001.9 ± 0.48.1 ± 0.84pyDJ80−343 to −1000.9 ± 0.20.8 ± 0.51The GSH1-lacZ gene fusions were transformed into wild type (S150–2B).

Int, plasmids were integrated at the ura3 locus. To complement the reporter gene assays we also examined protein-DNA interaction on the GSH1 promoter using an EMSA. A portion of theGSH1 promoter (from −497 to −198) covering the putative cadmium-regulatory element was used as a probe in an EMSA with protein extracts from yeast. We observed a specific complex binding to this region of the GSH1 promoter (Fig.2 A, lane 2). In order to determine the specific region of the GSH1promoter to which this protein complex was binding, various lengths of the GSH1 promoter were used in competition assays. Gel retardation experiments were performed with a labeled section of theGSH1 promoter (from nucleotides −497 to −198). Excess amounts of shorter unlabeled GSH1 promoter fragments generated by PCR were mixed in with the labeled probe in binding reactions (Fig. 2 C). These experiments mapped the protein-binding site of the complex on the GSH1 promoter to nucleotides −379 to −341 (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3–5). Further gel retardation experiments narrowed down the binding sequence yet further to the region between −379 and −361 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and 4). The sequence identified by the EMSA experiments showed a perfect match to a sequence found in centromeric sequences (the CDEI motif) that occurs in the promoters of some methionine-regulated genes (Fig.3) (30Mellor J. Rathjen J. Jiang W. Barnes C.A. Dowell S.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2961-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The GSH1 promoter region contains two potential CDEI-binding sites (−370 to −363) and (−108 to −102). However the sequence between nucleotides −108 and −102 is not bound by the protein complex (data not shown). The CDE1 sequence element has been shown to be bound by the protein Cbf1. To determine whether the complex contained or at least required the Cbf1 protein for formation, gel retardation experiments were performed using extracts prepared from a strain containing a cbf1 null mutation. These extracts did not produce a specific protein-DNA complex in the EMSA experiments (Fig. 4,lane 4).Figure 4The cbf1 protein is important for complex formation. The GSH1 promoter from −497 to −198 was amplified by PCR and end-labeled. This was added to binding reactions containing extracts from either wild type (S150–2B) and acbf1 null mutant (DJY169). Binding reactions were electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels as described under ”Materials and Methods.“ Competition experiments contained approximately 100-fold excess of unlabeled probe DNA.

The expression of aGSH1-lacZ gene fusion was assayed in acbf1 null mutant. The results of these experiments indicated that the Cbf1 protein does not appear to play a role in regulating the expression of the GSH1 gene in response to H2O2 (data not shown). However, thecbf1 null mutant did show elevated levels of basalGSH1 expression, compared with wild type (TableV). Indeed the elevated expression levels seen in the cbf1 mutant were similar to those seen in the wild type induced by cadmium, although no cadmium induction was observed in the cbf1 mutant.Table VMethionine regulatory genes regulate GSH1 expressionStrainRelevant genotypeUnits β-galactosidase activity, treatmentNo stressCadmiumInduction-foldS150–2BWild type0.815 ± 0.138.77 ± 0.511DJY169Δcbf17.38 ± 0.75.9 ± 0.80.8H313–10Amet41.3 ± 0.22.2 ± 0.31.7CC845–1AΔmet31/met321.5 ± 0.21.86 ± 0.51.2The GSH1-lacZ gene fusion pyDJ95 was transformed into wild type (S150–2B) as follows: a Δcbf1 mutant (DJY169), a met4 mutant (H313–10A), and amet31/met32 double mutant (CC845–1A).

After this time β-galactosidase assays were performed as described under “Materials and Methods,” and the results shown are the means of duplicate assays from three independent cultures. A closer examination of the sequences required for cadmium induction revealed the presence of the following sequence CAACTGTGGC, corresponding to the binding site for the transcription factors Met-31 and Met-32 (31Blaiseau P.-L. Isnard A.-D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Thomas D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3640-3648Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Both Met-31 and Met-32 function as part of a large complex, which also includes Met-4 and Cbf1, to regulate expression of the methionine biosynthetic genes (32Blaiseau P.-L. Thomas D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6327-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We tested whetherGSH1 expression and cadmium induction in particular also required these factors. A GSH1-lacZ gene fusion was transformed into a met4 and amet31/met32 double mutant, and GSH1expression levels were measured. It was evident that there was no cadmium induction in either the met4 or themet31/met32 double mutant (Table V), supporting the hypothesis that these transcription factors play a role in regulating GSH1 gene expression in response to cadmium. This effect was specific to cadmium as induction of GSH1 by H2O2 still occurred in the met4mutant (data not shown). We next asked whether Cbf1 binds to the GSH1 promoterin vivo, by examining the accessibility of theGSH1 promoter to micrococcal nuclease digestion in spheroplasts from wild type and cbf1 mutant yeast (Fig.5). In the absence of Cbf1 an additional nuclease hypersensitive site is evident in the region of the A-CDEI (Fig. 3) element of the GSH1 promoter, demonstrating that the promoter chromatin accessibility is altered by binding of the Cbf1 protein. As glutathione is known to be important in countering cadmium toxicity, we examined the effect of the cbf1 mutation upon the cadmium sensitivity of yeast. We reasoned that as the levels of GSH1gene expression in the cbf1 mutant were almost as high as those seen following cadmium induction that the cbf1 mutant would be more resistant to cadmium. This was indeed the case, with thecbf1 null mutant displaying considerably increased resistance to cadmium (Fig. 6). In view of the central importance of glutathione in countering environmental stress caused by reactive oxidants and heavy metals, we have studied the regulation of glutathione biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae. We have found that expression of the GSH1gene, encoding the first and rate-limiting step in the GSH biosynthetic pathway, γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, is regulated by reactive oxygen species, such as H2O2, superoxide anion generators, and the heavy metal cadmium (13Stephen D.W.S. Rivers S.L. Jamieson D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 20Stephen D.W.S. Jamieson D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our results point to a direct link between sulfur amino acid metabolism and glutathione biosynthesis. We show that the genes regulating the methionine biosynthetic pathway are also responsible for the cadmium-mediated induction of GSH1 expression. A series of promoter deletions enabled us to identify the region of theGSH1 promoter responsible for cadmium-mediated regulation of gene expression. In vitro experiments demonstrated that this sequence appeared to be bound by a specific protein complex, whereas subsequent sequence analysis of the promoter region bound by this complex revealed a sequence with a perfect match to the CDE1 box found in yeast centromeres and in the promoters of some genes involved in methionine biosynthesis (30Mellor J. Rathjen J. Jiang W. Barnes C.A. Dowell S.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2961-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 33Hieter P. Pridmore D. Hegemann J.H. Thomas H. Davis R.W. Philippsen P.

Biol. 1992; 12: 1719-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This sequence is known to bind a general transcription factor, the 39.4-kDa protein (Cbf1). A considerable amount of previous work, involving the methionine biosynthetic genes, has demonstrated that the Cbf1 protein can act as a recruitment factor for other transcription factors, such as Met-4 and Met-28 (35Kuras L. Cherest H. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Thomas D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2519-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 36Kuras L. Barby R. Thomas D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2441-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that suggests that Cbf1 can modulate chromatin structure to facilitate transcription factor binding (29Kent N.A. Tsang J.S.H. Crowther D.J. Mellor J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5229-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Our data strongly suggest that the Cbf1 protein binds to this sequence in the GSH1 promoter both in vivo andin vitro. Mutants lacking Cbf1 have considerably higher basal levels of GSH1 expression and also display enhanced resistance toward cadmium. Taken together these results support the idea that the Cbf1 protein has a repressive role on transcription from the GSH1 promoter. The sequence responsible for mediating cadmium induction was found to be identical to that bound by the Met-31 and Met-32 proteins (31Blaiseau P.-L. Isnard A.-D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Thomas D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3640-3648Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The Met-31 and Met-32 proteins are zinc finger DNA-binding proteins that function to recruit the transcription factor Met-4 to the promoters of some of the methionine biosynthetic genes and are required for expression of these genes (32Blaiseau P.-L. Thomas D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6327-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Neither Met-31 nor Met-32, individually or together, are capable of activating transcription, and these proteins require the trans-activation function of the Met-4 protein to activate transcription (32Blaiseau P.-L. Thomas D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6327-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). By using both met4 andmet31/met32 mutants, it was evident that cadmium induction also required all three proteins. One likely scenario is that Met-31 and or Met-32 recruits the Met-4 protein to the GSH1promoter; whether the Met-28 protein is also involved in this complex is not yet known. The role of the Cbf1 protein in the cadmium induction process is still poorly understood. The cbf1 mutant shows no significant cadmium induction of GSH1 expression; however, this may be because the rate of transcription is already maximal in this mutant. The link between sulfur amino acid metabolism and GSH biosynthesis is particularly interesting as it has been suggested that GSH can act as a sulfur storage compound (11Elskens M.T. Jaspers C.J. Penninckx M.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This previous study showed that starvation for sulfur resulted in a depletion of the cellular GSH pool, largely through the action of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase. A more recent report also highlighted the role of GSH as a source of sulfur and suggested a direct link between GSH depletion and SO4accumulation in yeast (37Miyake T. Sammoto H. Kanayama M. Tomochika K.-I. Shinoda S. Ono B.-I. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1449-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It seems reasonable to suppose that in response to GSH depletion through starvation for sulfur, cellular GSH levels will eventually need to be replenished. Equally, in the presence of excess methionine as a sulfur source, little GSH depletion would occur and therefore there would be little need for new synthesis. The transcription factor Yap1 is clearly also very important in regulating GSH1 gene expression and in conferring cellular resistance toward cadmium (13Stephen D.W.S. Rivers S.L. Jamieson D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 16Wu A.-L. Moye-Rowlely W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Stephen D.W.S.

Biol. 1992; 12: 1719-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Nevertheless our results show that other transcription factors are also involved. At present the relationship between the Yap1 protein and the Met-4·Met-31 (32Blaiseau P.-L. Thomas D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6327-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) complex is unclear, nor is the physiological reason that this complex is involved in cadmium regulation of gene expression understood. Further work is required to understand the physiological relationship between the Yap1 and sulfur regulatory pathways. We are indebted to Dr. D. Thomas and Dr. H. Mountain for kindly providing strains. We are also grateful to Drs. E. Ellis and R. C. Schuurink for suggestions and critical reading of the manuscript.

The formation of theS-[(Z)-2-aminovinyl]-d-cysteine structure can then be explained by the addition of the thiol group of the C-terminal enethiol to didehydroalanine at position 19 formed by the dehydration of a serine residue. EpiD has a wide substrate specificity, and most of the peptides with the sequence (V/I/L/(M)/F/Y/W)-(A/S/V/T/C/(I/L))-C at the C terminus are substrates of EpiD, as elucidated by analysis of the reaction of EpiD with single peptides and peptide libraries (7Kupke T. Kempter C. Jung G. Götz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11282-11289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).A decarboxylation reaction of a cysteine residue also occurs in the pathway for the biosynthesis of coenzyme A. Coenzyme A is required for synthetic and degradative reactions in intermediary metabolism and is the principal acyl group carrier in all living cells (10Abiko Y. Greenburg D.M. Metabolic Pathways. Academic Press, Inc., New York1975: 1-25Google Scholar). The synthesis of coenzyme A is a multiple step process. β-Alanine is synthesized from l-aspartate by the panD gene product, an aspartate-1-decarboxylase. Then β-alanine combines with pantoate to form pantothenate. This is converted in a two-step process in bacteria to (R)-4′-phospho-N-pantothenoylcysteine (PPC)1 (11Jackowski S. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 687-694Google Scholar). The cysteine residue of PPC is then decarboxylated to the reactive cysteamine residue of 4′-phosphopantetheine (PP), a reaction that was attributed to a pyruvoyl-dependent enzyme (12Yang H. Abeles R.H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4076-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). PP is the precursor of coenzyme A and the prosthetic group of the acyl carrier protein. PP is converted in two steps to coenzyme A by the enzymes phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase and dephospho-CoA kinase (11Jackowski S. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 687-694Google Scholar).In this study, we characterized the molecular basis of the action of flavoenzyme EpiD in order to elucidate the function of homologous proteins, which are present in all kingdoms of life. This work first led to identification of a new flavin coenzyme binding motif and to identification of the active-site residues of EpiD. By homology we proposed that the Dfp proteins from eubacteria and archaea also catalyze a decarboxylation reaction and/or have peptidylcysteines as substrates. Based on the obtained data for EpiD, we then elucidated the previously unknown function of bacterial Dfp proteins, and we demonstrated that these flavoenzymes catalyze the decarboxylation of (R)-4′-phospho-N-pantothenoylcysteine to 4′-phosphopantetheine. We also present data that indicate that EpiD, Dfp, and all other homologous proteins are homododecamers, and therefore we introduce the name HFCD (homododecamericflavin-containing Cysdecarboxylases) proteins for them. Lantibiotics such as nisin, epidermin, mersacidin, and cytolysin are a group of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified antibiotic peptides (1Schnell N. Entian K.-D. Schneider U. Götz F. Zähner H. Kellner R. Jung G. Nature. 1988; 333: 276-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) that are produced by and act on Gram-positive bacteria. Recently, it has been shown that the antimicrobial activity of nisin arises due to its binding to the membrane-anchored cell wall precursor lipid II and subsequent permeabilization of the plasma membrane (2Breukink E. Wiedemann I. van Kraaij C. Kuipers O.P. Sahl H.-G. de Kruijff B. Science. 1999; 286: 2361-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). The main focus of current research is the characterization of the novel posttranslational modification reactions involved in lantibiotic biosynthesis, such as dehydration of serine and threonine residues, thioether formation, and the formation of d-alanine residues from l-serine residues (reviewed in Ref. 3Sahl H.-G. Bierbaum G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 41-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Currently, only the function of flavoenzyme EpiD has been described. This enzyme binds one FMN molecule and is involved in the formation of the C-terminalS-[(Z)-2-aminovinyl]-d-cysteine residue (4Allgaier H. Jung G. Werner R.G. Schneider U. Zähner H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1985; 24: 1051-1053Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar) of epidermin, a lantibiotic that is produced byStaphylococcus epidermidis Tü3298. EpiD catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of the C-terminal cysteine residue of epidermin precursor peptide EpiA to a (Z)-enethiol structure (5Kupke T. Stevanovic S. Sahl H.-G. Götz F. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5354-5361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kupke T. Kempter C. Gnau V. Jung G. Götz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5653-5659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kupke T.

Two reducing equivalents from the C-terminal cysteine residue of EpiA are removed; a double bond is formed; the coenzyme FMN is reduced to FMNH2, and then the C-terminal carboxyl group is removed. The unusual enethiol structure has been confirmed by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy (8Kempter C. Kupke T. Kaiser D. Metzger J.W. Jung G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

The NH2-terminal region of the AdhE protein is highly homologous to aldehyde:NAD+ oxidoreductases, whereas the COOH-terminal region is homologous to a family of Fe2+-dependent ethanol:NAD+oxidoreductases. This fusion protein also functions as a pyruvate formate lyase deactivase. E. coli cannot grow aerobically on ethanol as the sole carbon and energy source because of inadequate rate of adhE transcription and the vulnerability of the AdhE protein to metal-catalyzed oxidation. In this study, we characterized 16 independent two-step mutants with acquired and improved aerobic growth ability on ethanol. The AdhE proteins in these mutants catalyzed the sequential oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde and to acetyl-CoA. All first stage mutants grew on ethanol with a doubling time of about 240 min. Sequence analysis of a randomly chosen mutant revealed an Ala-267 → Thr substitution in the acetaldehyde:NAD+ oxidoreductase domain of AdhE. All second stage mutants grew on ethanol with a doubling time of about 90 min, and all of them produced an AdhEA267T/E568K. Purified AdhEA267T and AdhEA267T/E568K showed highly elevated acetaldehyde dehydrogenase activities. It therefore appears that when AdhE catalyzes the two sequential reactions in the counter-physiological direction, acetaldehyde dehydrogenation is the rate-limiting step. Both mutant proteins were more thermosensitive than the wild-type protein, but AdhEA267T/E568K was more thermal stable than AdhEA267T. Since both mutant enzymes exhibited similar kinetic properties, the second mutation probably conferred an increased growth rate on ethanol by stabilizing AdhEA267T.

The fermentation products include ethanol, formate, acetate, glycerol, d-lactate, succinate, CO2, and H2 (1Wood W.A. Gunsalus I.C. Stainer R.Y. The Bacteria. Academic Press, New York1961Google Scholar, 2Clark D.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1989; 63: 223-234Crossref Google Scholar). As indicated by Reactions 1 and 2 below, ethanol arises from acetyl-CoA by two sequential NADH-dependent reductions catalyzed by the multifunctional ethanol oxidoreductase (the adhE gene product) comprising 891 amino acids (Refs. 3Goodlove P.E. Cunningham P.R. Parker J. Clark D.P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 85: 204-209Google Scholar and 4Kessler D. Herth W. Knappe J. J. Biol.

The NH2-terminal region of this protein is highly homologous to the family of aldehyde:NAD+ oxidoreductases, whereas the COOH-terminal region is homologous to the family of Fe2+-dependent alcohol:NAD+oxidoreductases (3Goodlove P.E.

Despite the fact that both AdhE-catalyzed reactions are reversible, E. coli fails to grow on ethanol as a sole carbon and energy source apparently for two main reasons. First, the adhE gene is insufficiently expressed under aerobic conditions (6Clark D.P. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 144: 179-184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Chen Y.M. Lin E.C.C. J.

Second, the catalytic half-life of the AdhE protein is shortened during aerobic metabolism by a metal-catalyzed oxidation (MCO)1 cycle. In this disabling process, the amino acid chains of AdhE are thought to be covalently attacked by the highly reactive hydroxyl radicals locally generated by the Fe2+ bound to the active site of the alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase domain. In fact, AdhE has been identified as one of the major targets of protein oxidation in E. coli (9Cabiscol E. Aguilar J. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6592-6597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Tamarit J. Cabiscol E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3027-3032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The case of the adhE gene product and its role in general fermentation is analogous to that of the fucO gene product and its role in specific l-fucose fermentation (11Cocks G.T. Aguilar J. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 118: 83-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike AdhE, FucO is not a fusion protein but a simple enzyme that belongs to the family of Fe2+-dependent alcohol:NAD(P)+ oxidoreductases and catalyzes physiologically the reduction of l-lactaldehyde tol-1,2-propanediol (11Cocks G.T. Aguilar J. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 118: 83-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sridhara S. Wu T.T. Chused T.M. Lin E.C.C. J.

Like AdhE, FucO also fails to serve as a dehydrogenase for aerobic growth, because the gene is inadequately expressed, and the enzyme is highly susceptible to MCO during aerobic metabolism. We have previously characterized E. coli mutants that acquired aerobic growth ability onl-1,2-propanediol by recruiting FucO to serve as a dehydrogenase (Ref. 14Lu Z. Cabiscol E. Obradors N. Tamarit J. Ros J. Aguilar J. Lin E.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8308-8316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar and references therein). Two kinds of mutations contributed to such an ability. First, an IS5 insertion occurred in the fucO promoter that resulted in high constitutive expression of the fucAO operon (15Chen Y.M. Lu Z. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6097-6105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, a missense mutation occurred that conferred resistance of FucO to MCO (9Cabiscol E. Aguilar J. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6592-6597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lu Z. Cabiscol E. Obradors N. Tamarit J. Ros J. Aguilar J. Lin E.C.C. J. Biol.

Acta. 1981; 672: 98-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A mutant that grew on ethanol as sole carbon and energy source was previously reported (6Clark D.P. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 144: 179-184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the nature of the mutation(s) responsible for the ethanol+ phenotype was not definitively determined. Here we report the isolation of 16 series of independent ethanol+ mutants and the characterization of the genetic changes at the molecular level. Our results showed that the evolution of AdhE as a dehydrogenase followed a strategy that differs from that of FucO. The relevant characteristics and sources of bacterial strains, plasmids, and phages used in this study are given in TableI. Luria Bertani (LB) medium containing 0.1 m MOPS and 0.2% glucose was adjusted to pH 7.4 (LB-glucose medium). Minimal medium was prepared as described previously (10Tamarit J. Cabiscol E. Ros J. J.

Solid media contained 1.5% Bacto-agar (Difco). Culture absorbance (A 600) was determined in a DU640 Beckman spectrophotometer. Aerobic 10-ml cultures were grown at 37 °C in 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask shaken at 250 rpm. Anaerobic cultures were grown at 37 °C in 100-ml flasks filled to the brim. For anaerobic growth on solid media, a Gas-Pak system was used.

Aguilar J. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 320-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cell pellets were suspended in four times their wet weight in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm NAD, and protease inhibitors 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, and 1 μm pepstatin A. The suspended cells were disrupted by sonication. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used for assays. To determine the level of AdhE activities, the cells were grown on glucose or ethanol minimal mineral medium. Ethanol dehydrogenase activity was assayed in 1.5 methanol, 2.5 mm NAD, and 300 mm potassium carbonate at pH 10.0. Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase activity was assayed in 100 mm acetaldehyde (10 mm for purified enzymes), 2.5 mm CoASH, 2.5 mm NAD, and 300 mm potassium carbonate at pH 10.0 (18Gupta S. Mat-Jan F. Latigi M. Clark D.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 182: 51-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rates of both dehydrogenase reactions were monitored by the formation of NADH at 340 nm (19Racker E. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 1: 500-503Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Acetyl-CoA reductase activity was assayed in 1 mmacetyl-CoA, 0.25 mm NADH, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5).

In all of the assays 1 activity unit corresponds to 1 μmol of substrate converted per min. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed as described previously by Miller (20Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). 6 liters of anaerobic cultures were grown overnight at 37 °C in minimal medium containing 0.2% glucose. Cultures were centrifuged and disrupted by two 1-min cycles of sonication with 1-min intervals of resting on ice. Cell-free extracts were obtained by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Ammonium sulfate was slowly added to the extracts being stirred and chilled on ice until 20.6% saturation was reached. The mixture was left chilled for 30 min and then centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C at 15,000 ×g. The supernatant fraction was recovered, and ammonium sulfate was added until 30% saturation while being stirred and chilled on ice. After 30 min of equilibration, the mixture was again centrifuged, as described above. This time the pellet was recovered and resuspended in 2.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) (approximately 30–35 mg of protein/ml). The sample was applied to an Ultrogel AcA44 gel filtration column (IBF Biotechnics, Paris, France) pre-equilibrated with 100 mm KCl, 50 mmMOPS-KOH at pH 7.65. Elution with the same buffer was carried out at a flow rate of 1.4 ml/min. Fractions showing significant AdhE activity were pooled and diluted (1:1 v/v) with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5). The sample was then loaded into a DEAE-15HR column (Waters Associates, Milford, MA) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) and 50 mm NaCl. After a washing step of 30 min with the same buffer, elution was carried out by a linear gradient of 50–200 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 5 ml/min for 20 min. Peak AdhE elution occurred at approximately 15 min. Purity of the samples was examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (21Laemli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as standard. Purified wild-type and mutant AdhE proteins (0.14 mg/ml) were incubated at 37 °C. Samples were withdrawn at different time intervals for assay of ethanol dehydrogenase activity. Purified wild-type and mutant AdhE proteins (0.14 mg/ml) were incubated at 15 °C either in the presence of 1 mm NADH or 2 mm ascorbate plus 50 μm FeCl3 (23Levine R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 107: 370-376Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Samples were withdrawn at different time intervals for assay of ethanol dehydrogenase activity. Genetic crosses were performed by P1vir-mediated transduction (20Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Standard methods were used for restriction endonuclease digestion and ligation of DNA (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 25Simons R.W. Howner F. Kleckner N. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 53: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was isolated by using the QIAprep system, and the DNA fragments were isolated from agarose gels with the QIA quick kit (Qiagen). Bacteria were transformed with plasmid DNA electroporation (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with an E. coli Pulser (Bio-Rad). Polymerase chain reaction amplifications were carried out in a Minicycler (MJ Research), using Pfu DNA polymerase from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Oligonucleotides were custom-synthesized (DNA Integrated Technologies). Sequence determination of adhE alleles was carried out by amplifying four different fragments (A, B, C, and D) of theadhE gene using the following primers: A5 (5′-ATCACAGTGAGTGTGAGCGCGAGTAAGC-3′), A3 (5′-GCCAACTGCACGTTTGATATCAGC-3′), B5 (5′-GGTTTAAGCCGCATACAGCTCCGG-3′), B3 (5′-GCCATCAGTAATCACTTCATCC-3′), C5 (5′-CTCGCACCTTCCCTGACTCTGGG-3′), C3 (5′-CGTCCAAGACCACCGAAAGCACCACAGGG-3′), D5 (5′-CCTGGTTATGGACATGCCGAAG-3′), and D3 (5′-GAAGGGGCCGTTTATGTTG-3′). Each polymerase chain reaction fragment was subjected to automated DNA sequencing at the CORE facility at Harvard Medical School. Construction of plasmid pJMADH1 was described previously (26Membrillo-Hernández J. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7571-7579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis in theadhE-coding region was performed with the QuickChange kit (Stratagene). Primers T5 (5′-GTGAACGTTTTACAACCCACGGCGGC-3′) and T3 (5′-GCCGCCGTGGGTTGTAAAACGTTCAC-3′) were used to introduce the Ala-267 → Thr mutation in pJMADH4. Primers K5 (5′-GGAAACTCACTCGAAAAGCTGGCGCTGCGC-3′) and K3 (5′-GCGCAGCGCCAGCTTTTCGAGTGGAGTTTCC-3′) were used to introduce the Glu-568 → Lys mutation in pJMADH5. Plasmid pJMADH6, containing both mutations, was constructed by using plasmid pJMADH4 as a template with primers K5 and K3. Confirmation of the sequences of all the inserts was performed by automated DNA sequencing (CORE Facility at Harvard Medical School). The plasmids pJMADH1, pJMADH4, pJMADH5, and pJMADH6 were digested with restriction enzymesBamHI and EcoRI to yield 3.8-kb fragments that contain a full-length adhE operon. These fragments were then ligated using T4 DNA ligase (Promega, Madison, WI) with wild-type λ DNA cut with the same enzymes. The ligation mixtures were assembled into complete phage particles by using the Gigapack Gold Lambda packaging extract (Stratagene, La Jolla. CA). Phage particles were used to transduce strain ECL3999 (adhE::kan). Single copy insertions of the adhE operon were confirmed by Southern blots probed with adhE fragments at both ends of the adhE sequence. Since direct selection on minimal ethanol medium failed to yield the desired mutants, we used a two-step approach. About 100 cells of the merodiploid strain ECL4000 (adhE + Φ[adhE-lacZ]) were spread on each of 100 MacConkey base agar (Difco) plates containing 2% ethanol. The plates were then sealed with parafilm to retard evaporation and then incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Up to this time, all the colonies were semi-transparent and colorless. After 6 days of incubation under sealed conditions, red papillae appeared on many colonies. On 5 control plates without ethanol, no red papillae appeared. Among about 104 colonies screened on the MacConkey-ethanol agar, 1425 colonies presented red papillae. At least one papilla from each of these 1425 colonies was streaked on the same kind of agar for purification. A single red colony from each streak was then tested for growth ability on agar containing mineral medium and 2% ethanol. For reasons undetermined, only 31 red clones were found to have an ethanol+ phenotype. Sixteen independent ethanol+ mutants were adopted for further study. The doubling time of all these mutants in liquid mineral medium containing 2% ethanol was about 240 min at 37 °C. A phage P1 lysate was then prepared from each of the mutants to transduce strain ECL4000 and selected for aerobic growth on ethanol. One ethanol+transductant (first stage mutants) from each transduction experiment was subjected to an additional 100 generations of selection in the same ethanol liquid medium. A sample of the cells from each line of selection was then plated again on ethanol agar, and one colony that clearly exhibited an increased growth rate was isolated. A phage P1 lysate was then prepared from each of the 16 clones with improved growth rate on ethanol to transduce strain ECL4000, and the transductants were selected for aerobic growth on ethanol. All back-crosses gave rise to the large colony size phenotype. When each of these back-crossed strains (second stage mutants) were grown at 37 °C in liquid mineral medium containing 2% ethanol, all showed a doubling time of about 90 min. These results indicate that the first and second mutations are transductionally linked. A first stage mutant, JE46, and a second stage mutant, JE52, were picked as representatives for both genetic and biochemical characterizations (TableII).Table IIβ-Galactosidase and ethanol dehydrogenase activities of cell extracts from strains ECL400, JE46, and JE52 under different growth conditionsStrainEthanol dehydrogenase activity 2-aAdhE-specific activity is expressed as units/mg total protein.β-Galactosidase activity 2-bLacZ activity is expressed in Miller units (20).Glucose + O2Glucose − O2Ethanol + O2Glucose + O2Glucose − O2Ethanol + O2ECL40000.08 ± 0.040.95 ± 0.04970 ± 509700 ± 240JE460.43 ± 0.101.61 ± 0.200.78 ± 0.10580 ± 307000 ± 160540 ± 40JE520.61 ± 0.101.98 ± 0.300.89 ± 0.10520 ± 405300 ± 130500 ± 602-a AdhE-specific activity is expressed as units/mg total protein.2-b LacZ activity is expressed in Miller units (20Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab For a preliminary cis/trans test for the two mutations, we took advantage of the adhEΦ(adhE-lacZ) merodiploid background. A cismutation in adhE should primarily increase the ethanol dehydrogenase activity level, whereas a trans-positive regulatory mutation should elevate the expression of bothadhE and Φ(adhE-lacZ). When wild-type and mutant cells were grown aerobically on glucose, ethanol dehydrogenase activities were found to be 5.3-fold elevated in strain JE46 and 7.6-fold elevated in strain JE52 when compared with the wild-type level. The levels of the dehydrogenase activity were even more elevated when the mutant cells were grown aerobically on ethanol (possibly because of substrate stabilization). Curiously, the β-galactosidase activity levels were found to be 40% lower in strain JE46 and 46% lower in strain JE52 when compared with the wild-type level (Table II). In any event, the increase in ethanol dehydrogenase level without concomitant increase in β-galactosidase activity level would suggest that both mutations acted in cis. According to Leonardo and co-workers (8Leonardo M.R. Cunningham P.R. Clark D.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 870-878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the change of β-galactosidase activity levels in a direction opposite to that of ethanol dehydrogenase is best explained as follows. A cis mutation was responsible for elevating the dehydrogenase activity levels in the mutants JE46 and JE52. The increase in this activity (consumption of NADH coupled with the reduction of acetyl-CoA) during aerobic growth on glucose would raise the cellular redox potential. Such a state would in turn cause a decrease in the synthesis of β-galactosidase under the direction of the adhE promoter. The adhE promoters ofAerobacter aerogenes (now classified as Klebsiella pneumoniae) and E. coli are thought to be activated by low cellular redox states, as reflected by high NADH/NAD ratios (7Chen Y.M. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 8009-8013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Leonardo M.R. Dailly Y. Clark D.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6013-6018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,29Berlyn M.K.B. Low B.K. Rudd K.E. Neidhartd F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1715-1902Google Scholar). To confirm that the mutations in JE46 and JE52 were cis to the adhE locus situated at min 27.8 (31Clark D.P. Cronan J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 177-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we prepared a P1vir lysate from each of the mutants to transduce strain CAG12169 that bearszci-506::Tn10 insertion at min 28 (31). If the mutation(s) responsible for the increase of adhEexpression is indeed cis, then all of the transductants selected for the ability to grow on ethanol should lose the closely linked transposon Tn10 that confers tetracycline resistance. When 2000 ethanol+ transductants, obtained from each of the two P1vir lysates, were analyzed for the drug resistance, all were found to be Tets, affirming that the mutation(s) was in cis. There are several ways by which a mutationcis to adhE can increase the ethanol dehydrogenase activity level. For example, a regulatory mutation could increase the rate of transcription or translation of the gene, or a structural gene mutation may occur that enhances the catalytic activity or the half-life of the protein. To locate the mutations, we sequenced each entire mutant gene from 1 kb upstream of the ATG codon to the end of the open reading frame (see “Experimental Procedures”). As expected, the promoter region of strains JE46 and JE52 was identical to that of the wild-type sequence previously reported (32Kessler D. Leibrecht I. Knappe J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 281: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the coding region of theadhE gene in strain JE46 showed an A to G transition at position 799 from the A of the initiation codon ATG. This change converts amino acid residue 267 from Ala to Thr and is located inside the acetaldehyde dehydrogenase domain (Fig.1). The coding region of theadhE gene in strain JE52 showed two base changes as follows: the same substitution found in strain JE46, plus an A to G transition at position 1702 that converts the amino acid residue 568 from Glu to Lys, which is located inside the ethanol dehydrogenase domain. Strikingly, when the 15 other independently isolated second stage mutants were also subjected to DNA sequence analysis, the same pair of mutations present in strain JE52 was found. It might be noted that the presence of the mutations considerably downstream of the sequence specifying the RBS site also makes translational control an unlikely mechanism for the increased ethanol dehydrogenase activity level in the mutant strains. To demonstrate that the mutations identified in strains JE46 (adhE A267T) and JE52 (adhE A267T/E568K) are sufficient to account for their phenotypes, we prepared λ phage bearing wild-type or each of the two mutant alleles (see “Experimental Procedures”) to lysogenize strain ECL3999 (adhE::kan). The control lysogen ECL4063 (adhE::kanλatt::adhE +) showed aerobic and anaerobic levels of AdhE activity indistinguishable from those of the wild-type strains MC4100 and ECL4000. When strain ECL4064 (adhE::kanλatt::adhE A267T) was tested, the activity levels were similar to those of strain JE46, and the cells grew on ethanol as a sole carbon and energy source at a rate similar to that of cells of JE46. Similarly, strain ECL4066 (adhE A267T/E568K) showed the same phenotypes as strain JE52 (data not shown). Starting from an acetate auxotroph (aceF10, defective in dihydrolipoyltransacetylase component E2p), DC48, Clark and Cronan (6Clark D.P. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 144: 179-184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) isolated a nitrosoguanidine-induced mutant, DC81, that acquired the ability to use ethanol as a substitute of acetate. Strain DC81 also grew on ethanol as sole carbon and energy source. When grown aerobically on glucose and acetate, DC81 exhibited an ethanol dehydrogenase activity level more than 20-fold higher than that of DC48. It was suggested on the basis of genetic analysis that the mutation in DC81 altered a transcriptional site of the adh gene at min 27 (6), later referred to as the promoter constitutive mutation adhC (27McPhedran P. Sommer B Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1961; 81: 852-857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strain DC272, re-examined in this study, was an ac"
https://openalex.org/W2069813732,"β-Defensins are broad spectrum antimicrobial peptides expressed at epithelial surfaces. Two human β-defensins, HBD-1 and HBD-2, have been identified. In the lung, HBD-2 is an inducible product of airway epithelia and may play a role in innate mucosal defenses. We recently characterized rat homologs (RBD-1, RBD-2) of the human genes and used these sequences to identify novel mouse genes. Mouse β-defensin-4 (MBD-4) was amplified from lung cDNA using polymerase chain reaction primers designed from conserved sequences of RBD-2 and HBD-2. A full-length cDNA was cloned which encodes a putative peptide with the sequence MRIHYLLFTFLLVLLSPLAAFTQIINNPITCMTNGAICWGPCPTAFRQIGNCGHFKVRCCKIR. The peptide shares ∼40% identity with HBD-2. MBD-4 mRNA was expressed in the esophagus, tongue, and trachea but not in any of 20 other tissues surveyed. Cloning of the genomic sequence of MBD-4 revealed two nearly (>99%) identical sequences encoding MBD-4 and the presence of numerous additional highly similar genomic sequences. Radiation hybrid mapping localized this gene to a region of chromosome 8 near several other defensins, MBD-2, MBD-3, and α-defensins (cryptdins)-3 and -17, consistent with a gene cluster. Our genomic cloning and mapping data suggest that there is a large β-defensin gene family in mice. Identification of murine β-defensins provides an opportunity to understand further the role of these peptides in host defense through animal model studies and the generation of β-defensin-deficient animals by gene targeting."

Here we show that the fifth S. cerevisiae nudix hydrolase gene, PCD1 (ORF YLR151C) on chromosome XII, encodes a protein with an entirely new enzyme activity: a peroxisomal coenzyme Adiphosphatase, Pcd1p, that cleaves 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-monophosphate (3′,5′-ADP) from coenzyme A and CoA derivatives. Oxidized CoA disulfide (CoASSCoA) is preferred to CoA as a substrate. Pcd1p also appears to be only the second documented S. cerevisiae protein to have an N-terminal PTS2 peroxisomal targeting signal. S. cerevisiae strain INVSc1 (MATα, his3-D1, leu2, trp1–289, ura3–52) was from Invitrogen. All nucleotides and nucleotide derivatives were from Sigma. Calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase, and restriction enzymes were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The Escherichia coli expression vector, pET 17b(+) was from Novagen, and the pPGY1 yeast centromere vector was a gift from L.D. Barnes. Rhodamine B hexyl ester was from Molecular Probes. Rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The yeast-enhanced green fluorescent protein (yEGFP) fusion vectors pUG35 and pUG36 were a gift from J. H. Hegemann. A rabbit polyclonal antibody to yeast 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase (Fox3p) was kindly donated by W.-H Kunau. The PCD1 coding region was amplified from genomic DNA using the polymerase chain reaction and the 36-mer oligonucleotide forward and reverse primers d(AGAAAAGAATTCATGATATTAAGTCAGAGGAGGATG) and d(ATCTCTCTCGAGTATTGTTAGGCAACGCATTATACC). The synthesized primers provided an EcoRI restriction site at the start of the amplified ORF and a XhoI site at the end. After amplification with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), the DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction, digested withEcoRI and XhoI, and the gel-purified restriction fragment ligated between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of both pET17b(+) and pPGY1. The resulting pET151C construct (from pET17b) yielded an N-terminal fusion of the T7 tag sequence and Pcd1p under the control of the T7 promoter while the pPGY151C construct (from pPGY1) generated the ATG initiator downstream of GAL1p, a galactose-inducible promoter, and yielded native Pcd1p when expressed in yeast. Both plasmids were used to transform E. coliXL1-Blue cells for propagation. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was transformed with pET151C. A single colony was picked from an LB agar plate containing 60 μg/ml ampicillin and inoculated into 10 ml of LB medium containing 60 μg/ml ampicillin. After overnight growth, the cells were transferred to 1 liter LB medium containing 60 μg/ml ampicillin and grown to anA 600 of 0.6. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 0.4 mm and the cells induced for 4 h. The induced cells (4.2 g) were harvested, washed, and resuspended in 50 ml of sonication buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1m NaCl). The cell suspension was sonicated and the inclusion bodies recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 20 min. After washing by resuspension in sonication buffer containing 2.5 m urea, the inclusion bodies were dispersed in 27 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 8m urea, 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and the extract centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was applied in 1-ml aliquots to a Mono Q HR 5/5 anion exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously equilibrated in Buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 m urea) and the protein eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 mNaCl in Buffer A. Homogeneous Pcd1p eluted at 0.27 m NaCl. Fractions containing the protein were dialyzed extensively against phosphate-buffered saline and used to generate a rabbit anti-Pcd1p polyclonal antiserum by standard procedures. S. cerevisiae strain INVScI was transformed with pPGY151C. A single colony was picked from an SC-Ura (synthetic complete medium without uracil) agar plate and inoculated into 40 ml of SC-Ura medium supplemented with 5% glucose. After 36 h the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 4 liters of SC-Ura + 5% glucose and grown for another 24 h. The cells were again recovered by centrifugation, resuspended in 4 liters of SC-Ura + 2% galactose, 1% raffinose, and grown for 24 h to fully induce expression of Pcd1p. The induced cells (26.84 g) were harvested, washed, and resuspended in 50 ml of breakage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μm trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane, 1 mm benzamidine).

Solid (NH4)2SO4 was added to the pooled fraction to a final concentration of 1 m and the sample was loaded at 1.5 ml/min on to a 15 × 50-mm column of Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously equilibrated in Buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 1 m(NH4)2SO4. After removal of unbound protein, a 100-ml reverse linear gradient from 1 to 0 m(NH4)2SO4 in Buffer C was applied. Fractions containing Pcd1p were identified by immunoblotting and pooled (52 ml) before dialysis against 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 10 μm CaCl2. The dialysate was applied at 1 ml/min to a 100 × 7.8-mm Bio-Gel HPHT column (Bio-Rad) and the protein eluted with a 30-ml linear gradient from 10 to 350 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, containing 10 μm CaCl2. Homogenous Pcd1p eluted at 300 mm sodium phosphate, and fractions containing the pure protein were dialyzed extensively against 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl prior to assay. Expression plasmids encoding C-terminal and N-terminal fusions of Pcd1p to yEGFP (11Cormack B.P. Bertram B. Egerton M. Gow N.A.R. Falkow S. Brown A.J.P. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) were constructed by amplification of the PCD1 coding region from genomic DNA using the polymerase chain reaction and either the 36-mer oligonucleotide primers described above to give PCR product C, or the 36-mer forward and reverse primers d(AGAAAAGAATTCATGATATTAAGTCAGAGGAGGATG) and d(CAGTTTCTCGAGCCAAAGCGAGCGGCACTCCAGCAG) to give product N. After amplification with Pfu DNA polymerase, both DNA products were recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and digested withEcoRI and XhoI. The digested and gel-purified PCR product C was ligated between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pUG36 to give pyEGFP-PCD1 while PCR product N was ligated between the EcoRI and SalI sites of pUG35 to give pPCD1-yEGFP. Both plasmids were propagated by transformation ofE. coli XL1-Blue cells. For microscopy, S. cerevisiae strain INVScI was transformed with either pyEGFP-PCD1 or pPCD1-yEGFP and grown in liquid or solid SC-Ura medium containing 2% glucose. For staining of mitochondria in living cells, cultures of exponentially growing transformed INVScI were resuspended in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5% (w/v) glucose, 100 nm rhodamine B hexyl ester and incubated at 20 °C for 30 min. For immunofluorescence microscopy, INVScI cells transformed with pPCD1-yEGFP were first grown in SC-Ura + 2% glucose to mid log phase followed by growth for 18 h in SC-Ura + 0.1% oleic acid, 0.02% Tween 40. Fixation and immunocytochemical staining were as described (12Erdmann R. Yeast. 1994; 10: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) using anti-3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase (dilution 1:3000) followed by rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:50). Cells were viewed by conventional and confocal fluorescence microscopy on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope with a 100 × 1.4 numeric aperture objective. Potential substrates were screened by measuring the Pi released by co-incubation of nucleotides with Pcd1p and either inorganic pyrophosphatase or alkaline phosphatase as described previously (9Cartwright J.L. McLennan A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8604-8610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,13Gasmi L. Cartwright J.L. McLennan A.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 331-337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction products generated from substrates were identified by high performance anion-exchange chromatography. Reaction mixtures (100 μl) containing 50 mm 1, 3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane-HCl, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm substrate, and 0.125 μg of Pcd1p were incubated for up to 10 min at 37 °C and applied to a 1-ml Resource-Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 2 ml/min in 5% buffer E. The elution system comprised Buffer D (0.045m CH3COONH4, adjusted to pH 4.6 with H3PO4) and Buffer E (0.5 mNaH2PO4, adjusted to pH 2.7 with CH3COOH) (14Kim J.S. Kim W.Y. Rho H.W. Park J.W. Park B.H. Han M.K. Kim U.H. Kim H.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), with a gradient of 5–70% Buffer E over 10 min. Substrates requiring reducing conditions (CoA and 3′-dephospho-CoA) were pre-incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with DTT before addition to the assay. The final assay concentration of DTT was 1 mm. Peaks were identified with the aid of standards and quantified by area integration for kinetic analysis. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (9Cartwright J.L. McLennan A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8604-8610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were estimated by the Coomassie Blue binding method (15Peterson G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 91: 95-119Crossref Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). The intronless PCD1 gene contains an open reading frame, YLR151C, that potentially encodes a 39,758-Da protein containing a nudix box (Fig. 1 A). Initial and various attempts to express soluble Pcd1p to a high level inE. coli were unsuccessful, with all the recombinant protein being found in inclusion bodies. Resolubilization of this material also failed to produce protein with discernible enzyme activity. It was therefore decided to use the protein isolated from inclusion bodies to raise a polyclonal rabbit antibody that could then be used in an immunoassay for the purification of the overexpressed protein from yeast. The YLR151C ORF was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA and the PCR product inserted into the yeast centromere vector, pPGY1. The resulting plasmid, pPGY151C, was transformed into S. cerevisiae strain INVScI and expression of the insert induced by growth on galactose. By following the major immunoreactive species on Western blots of chromatographic fractions, the protein product ofPCD1 was purified to homogeneity from extracts of the induced cells. The purified protein had a molecular mass of 38 kDa according to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 B). Throughout the purification, the immunoblots revealed more clearly than the gels that the overexpressed Pcd1p actually comprised two species of very similar size (Fig. 1 C). N-terminal sequencing of the two bands excised from these blots showed the upper and lower species to have the sequences MLSSKQLI and LSSKQLI, respectively, suggesting that Pcd1p may have undergone some N-terminal processing with the loss of either 7 or 8 amino acids (Fig. 1 A). Nucleotides were tested as potential substrates for Pcd1p using a spectrophotometric assay. No activity was found with the following compounds: (deoxy)nucleoside 5′-triphosphates, nucleoside 5′-di- or monophosphates, diadenosine polyphosphates, nucleoside 5′-diphosphosugars, cytidine 5′-diphosphoalcohols, NAD+, NADH, or FAD. However, substantial activity was found with CoA and some CoA derivatives (Table I). HPLC analysis of the products of CoA hydrolysis showed that the enzyme was a CoA diphosphatase, cleaving the diphosphate linkage in CoA to give 3′,5′-ADP and 4′-phosphopantetheine (Fig.2 A). Pcd1p is the first nudix hydrolase to be described with such a substrate specificity. TheK m and k cat for CoA were 280 μm and 4.6 s−1, respectively, while the corresponding values for oxidized CoA disulfide (CoASSCoA) were 24 μm and 5.0 s−1, respectively. Thus, the enzyme has a 13-fold higherk cat/K m ratio for CoASSCoA compared with CoA. These kinetic parameters were calculated by non-linear regression analysis of the data in Fig.3 A. The reciprocal plots in Fig. 3 B clearly show that the enzyme follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics with these two substrates. The initial products of CoASSCoA hydrolysis were 3′,5′-ADP and what is presumed to be CoASSP, the mixed disulfide of CoA and 4′-phosphopantetheine,i.e. CoASSCoA lacking a single 3′,5′-ADP moiety (Fig.2 B). Significant accumulation of this product was observed with time before it too was degraded, presumably to 3′,5′-ADP and the dimer of 4′-phosphopantetheine, suggesting that CoASSP is not as efficient a substrate as CoASSCoA. When measured at a single fixed substrate concentration, moderate activity was also obtained with several short chain acyl-CoA esters while 3′-dephospho-CoA was a very poor substrate (Table I). Thus, the 3′ phosphate on the adenosine moiety appears to be important for substrate recognition. Attempts to demonstrate enzyme activity in crude yeast extracts proved impossible due to 3′ dephosphorylation of the CoA substrates. The mixed CoA-glutathione disulfide, which may exist in vivo but which is more usually found as an extraction artifact (16King M.T. Reiss P.D. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 146: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 17Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 866-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), was also a relatively poor substrate. Therefore, recognition of CoASSCoA as a good substrate must involve more than just the disulfide bond.Table ISubstrate utilization by Pcd1pSubstrateActivity%CoASSCoA100.0CoA63.9Succinyl-CoA20.53-Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA16.3Acetyl-CoA14.3CoA-glutathione disulfide6.13′-Dephospho-CoA0.8Activity with CoA and CoA derivatives was determined by high performance liquid chromatography at a fixed substrate concentration of 0.5 mm as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are expressed as percentage of degradation rate obtained with CoASSCoA determined from progress curves with incubation times up to 10 min. 100% represents a rate of 7.5 μmol·min−1·mg−1.

Pcd1p was optimally active at pH 7.0 with 5 mmMg2+ ions. Mn2+ at 300 μmsupported 83% of the activity observed with 5 mmMg2+ ions. Like all other nudix hydrolases tested, Pcd1p was very sensitive to inhibition by fluoride ions with an IC50 of 22 μm using CoASSCoA as substrate (data not shown). A likely subcellular location for an enzyme with the properties described would be the mitochondria or peroxisomes, as these contain the major cellular CoA pools. The latter organelle is the sole site of fatty acid β-oxidation in yeast. The N-terminal 30–40 amino acids of Pcd1p are rich in Lys, Arg, Ser, and Thr, suggesting they may comprise a mitochondrial targeting signal (Fig. 1 A) (18Hartl F.U. Pfanner N. Nicholson D.W. Neupert W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 1-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Indeed, the PSORT algorithm suggests a possible mitochondrial location (19Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar) while a hydrophobic transmembrane segment following the potential leader sequence that could anchor the imported protein in the inner mitochondrial membrane is predicted by the TMpred (20Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 347: 166-174Google Scholar) and TMHMM (21Sonnhammer E.L.L. von Heijne G. Krogh A. Glasgow J. Littlejohn T. Major F. Lathrop R. Sankoff D. Sensen C. Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology. AAAI Press, Menlo Park, CA1998: 175-185Google Scholar) algorithms (Fig. 1 A). The sequence of Pcd1p does not contain a typical C-terminal tripeptide peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1) (22de Hoop M.J. Ab G. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 657-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar); however, the sequence RRMLSSKQL in the N-terminal region (Fig. 1 A) is a close match to the PTS2 N-terminal peroxisomal matrix targeting signal consensus (R/K)(L/V/I)X 5(Q/H)(L/A) (22de Hoop M.J. Ab G. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 657-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 23Subramani S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Thus, Pcd1p could be either mitochondrial or peroxisomal. The similarity in peroxisomal and mitochondrial N-terminal targeting signals has been noted before (24Osumi T. Tsukamoto T. Hata S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In order to determine the true subcellular location of Pcd1p, yeast cells were transformed with expression vectors encoding Pcd1p fused to either the C terminus (pyEGFP-PCD1) or the N terminus (pPCD1-yEGFP) of yeast-enhanced green fluorescent protein (yEGFP) (11Cormack B.P. Bertram B. Egerton M. Gow N.A.R. Falkow S. Brown A.J.P. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) and then examined by confocal microscopy. Cells transformed with pyEGFP-PCD1 showed a diffuse cytoplasmic fluorescence with no clear subcellular localization (Fig. 4, A and B) while cells transformed with pPCD1-yEGFP showed a clear punctate fluorescence characteristic of peroxisomes (Fig. 4 C). The same cells stained with the mitochondrial-specific dye rhodamine B hexyl ester revealed a quite distinct pattern of mitochondrial staining (Fig. 4 D). Superimposition of the latter two images showed only limited coincidence of green and red emissions due to physical overlap of some organelles (Fig. 4 E). The structural integrity of the cells was apparent under bright field conditions (Fig.4 F). The peroxisomal location of Pcd1p in cells transformed with pPCD1-yEGFP (Fig. 4 G) was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using an antibody to 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase (Fox3p), a known peroxisomal enzyme (12Erdmann R. Yeast. 1994; 10: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 25Erdmann R. Kunau W.-H. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and a rhodamine-conjugated second antibody (Fig. 4 H). Both signals were clearly coincident (Fig. 4 I). These results show that the N-terminal sequence of Pcd1p directs the enzyme to peroxisomes, most probably via the PTS2-like sequence RRMLSSKQL, but not to the mitochondria. Thus, Pcd1p is only the second protein identified inS. cerevisiae to be imported into peroxisomes by virtue of a PTS2 signal, the first being Fox3p (26Geraghty M.T. Bassett D. Morrell J.C. Gatto G.J. Bai J.W. Geisbrecht B.V. Hieter P. Gould S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2937-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interestingly, purified Fox3p has been reported to lack its 5 N-terminal amino acids (25Erdmann R. Kunau W.-H. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) while purified Pcd1p appears to have lost 7 or 8 amino acids from its predicted sequence. This would lend support to the suggestion that the PTS2 signal in yeast may undergo specific proteolytic processing after import into the peroxisomes (25Erdmann R. Kunau W.-H. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Structure 1 shows the possible sites of proteolytic processing (arrowed) within the putative PTS2 sequences of Fox3p and Pcd1p (boxed).Figure 4Subcellular localization of Pcd1p by fluorescence confocal microscopy.

This motif has the sequence LLTXR(SA)X 3RX 3GX 3FPGG and is present in a variety of related bacterial, fungal, animal, and plant putative protein sequences in the GenBank™/EMBL non-redundant and expressed sequence tag data bases, some examples of which are shown in Fig. 5. Animals (mouse, rat, human, and Caenorhabditis elegans) have pairs of related sequences. The mouse gene sequences, Nudt7 and Nudt8, encode two 26-kDa proteins that share 34% sequence identity with each other and 26% and 20% sequence identity with Pcd1p, respectively. The Nudt7gene product is also a peroxisomal CoA diphosphatase with a C-terminal tripeptide targeting signal, SKL. 4L. Gasmi, J. L. Cartwright, and A. G. McLennan, unpublished observations. Therefore, the UPF0035 motif may be a determinant of CoA substrate specificity among the nudix hydrolases. Since it overlaps with the predicted transmembrane segment, the latter may not be genuine. An additional sequence feature is the substitution of the usual glutamate residue in the nudix box (marked with * in Fig. 5) by either aspartate or glutamine and the inclusion of an extra amino acid in several cases between this residue and the invariant alanine (marked with † in Fig. 5). Thus, the consensus nudix box in this family of potential CoA diphosphatases is GX 5DX 6AXREXXEEXGU. Pcd1p represents a new class of nudix hydrolase and a new class of enzyme. The existence of such an activity has been inferred previously but it has not been isolated. In E. coli, and presumably in other cells, regulation of the concentration of CoA includes turnover to form 3′,5′-ADP and 4′-phosphopantetheine, the latter being formed directly or by transfer to and removal from acyl carrier protein (27Vallari D.S. Jackowski S. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3961-3966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The former route would require a CoA diphosphatase. CoA diphosphatase has also been proposed as an activity associated with the 400-kDa CoA synthesizing protein complex from S. cerevisiae in which it forms part of an alternative pathway for CoA biosynthesis that differs from the principal route of 3′-dephospho-CoA and CoA synthesis by this complex (28Bucovaz E.T. Macleod R.M. Morrison J.C. Whybrew W.D. Biochimie. 1997; 79: 787-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This CoA/4′-phosphopantetheine cycle also includes hydrolysis of CoA to 3′,5′-ADP and 4′-phosphopantetheine, which then reacts with ATP to give 3′-dephospho-CoA, and then CoA. At the moment we do not know if Pcd1p is responsible for this activity. A recent comprehensive two-hybrid analysis of protein-protein interactions inS. cerevisiae revealed no interacting partners for Pcd1p (29Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney D. Mansfield T.A. Judson R.S. Knight J.R. Lockshon D. Narayan V. Srinivasan M. Pochart P. Qureshi-Emili A. Li Y. Godwin B. Conover D. Kalbfleisch T. Vijayadamodar G. Yang M. Johnston M. Fields S. Rothberg J.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3915) Google Scholar). However, stable interactions requiring three or more partners would not have been detected. Alternatively, the high activity of Pcd1p toward oxidized CoA disulfide and its peroxisomal location suggest a function that may be more in keeping with the proposal that a major role of the nudix hydrolases is the elimination of toxic nucleotides. Oxidative stress generates increased levels of several of the substrates for nudix hydrolases,e.g. 8-oxo-dGTP for the MutT protein (30Sekiguchi M. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A) for Ap4A hydrolase (31Bochner B.R. Lee P.C. Wilson S.W. Cutler C.W. Ames B.N.

J. 1999; 344: 331-337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many of the oxidative reactions in peroxisomes generate hydrogen peroxide and the resultant oxidizing environment would be expected to increase the CoA disulfide/CoA ratio (cf. the oxidized glutathione/glutathione ratio). Indeed, some organisms such asStaphylococcus aureus use a thiol/disulfide redox system based on CoA, CoA disulfide, and a CoA disulfide reductase instead of the more common glutathione system to maintain a reducing environment (33delCardayré S.B. Davies J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5752-5757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the probable absence of a specific CoA disulfide reductase to regenerate CoA within the yeast peroxisomes (33delCardayré S.B. Davies J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5752-5757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), accumulation of CoA disulfide could lead to a reduction in the ability to oxidize fatty acids, hence the need for Pcd1p. Since the S. cerevisiae NPY1 NADH diphosphatase is also peroxisomal,3 both enzymes may participate in the maintenance and protection of essential nucleotide pools for β-oxidation. Although preliminary experiments with a yeast strain disrupted for PCD1 have failed to show any substantial deficiency in growth on oleic acid,3 more detailed investigations are under way to determine the precise function of Pcd1p and the consequences of PCD1 disruption. In conclusion, a nudix hydrolase with a previously undescribed enzyme activity has been characterized in yeast. It is the first nudix hydrolase to be shown to be peroxisomal and only the second protein known in S. cerevisiae to be targeted by a PTS2 signal sequence. It will be of interest to determine if a deficiency in the human orthologue is associated with impaired peroxisomal function and disease. We thank M. C. Wilkinson for N-terminal sequencing and L. D.

These events are often accompanied by a reciprocal exchange between the interacting molecules (termed “crossing over”). This association suggests that the two types of events could be mechanistically related. We have analyzed the repair, by homologous recombination, of a broken chromosome in yeast. We show that gene conversion can be uncoupled from crossing over when the length of homology of the interacting substrates is below a certain threshold. In addition, a minimal length of homology on each broken chromosomal arm is needed for crossing over. We also show that the coupling between gene conversion and crossing over is affected by the mismatch repair system; mutations in the MSH2 or MSH6 genes cause an increase in the crossing over observed for short alleles.

Recombination results in the transfer of genetic information from one DNA molecule to a homologous one (gene conversion) and in the reciprocal exchange of DNA fragments between chromosomes (crossing over). The association between gene conversion and crossing-over events has led to the assumption that they are mechanistically related (Refs. 1Petes T.D. Malone R.E. Symington L.S. Broach J.R. Pringle J.R.

One of the characteristic features of most eukaryotic genomes is the presence of large amounts of repetitive DNA. Reciprocal recombination between dispersed repeats may result in chromosomal aberrations, such as deletions, translocations, etc., that can affect the reproductive fitness of an organism or lead to cancer. Therefore, to maintain the genome integrity, crossing over must be prevented during recombinational repair of DNA lesions involving dispersed repeats. Double-strand breaks (DSBs)1in the DNA of living organisms occur as a consequence of the natural cell metabolism, or they can be created by exogenous sources such as chemical agents or radiation. If left unrepaired, DSBs result in broken chromosomes and cell death (6Bennett C.B. Lewis A.L. Baldwin K.K. Resnick M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5613-5617Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Mitotic recombination plays an important role in the repair of this damage. In addition, DSBs are generated during certain developmental processes such as meiosis (7Zenvirth D. Arbel T. Sherman A. Goldway M. Klein S. Simchen G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3441-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and mating-type switch in yeast (8White C.I. Haber J.E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In different experimental systems, it was found that the level of association between gene conversion and crossing over varies, from no coupling (e.g. mating-type switch (8White C.I. Haber J.E.

Penney J. Pal S. Engels E.R. Gloor G.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1613-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) and the DSB repair model (4Szostak J.W. Orr-Weaver T.L. Rothstein R. Stahl F.W. Cell. 1983; 3: 725-738Google Scholar), recombination is initiated by the creation of a DSB in one of the two participating DNA duplexes (Fig. 1). Although the mechanism suggested by the SDSA model accounts mainly for gene conversion events, the DSB in the second model leads to the formation of an intermediate, which can be resolved either as a gene conversion event or as a gene conversion accompanied by a crossover (4Szostak J.W. Orr-Weaver T.L. Rothstein R. Stahl F.W. Cell. 1983; 3: 725-738Google Scholar). The dispersed repeated sequences in the genome can serve as a source of homology to repair broken chromosomes. If the recombinational repair results in a crossover, however, a deleterious aberration may occur; hence, regulating the coupling between gene conversion and crossing over is crucial to the maintenance of genome integrity. The mechanism that determines the coupling, however, is still unknown. In this paper, we dissect the rules that determine the association between gene conversion and crossing over in vegetative cells under conditions in which the initiation of the recombinational event is not limiting. All of the yeast strains used in this study are isogenic derivatives of strain OI27 (MATa-inc ura3-HOcs-inc ade3::GALHO ade2-1 leu2-3, 112 his3-11, 15 trp1-1 can1-100) (13Inbar O. Kupiec M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4134-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The ura3-HOcs alleles were created by inserting a 39-bp oligonucleotide (14Sweetser D.B. Hough H. Whelden J.F. Arbuckle M. Nickoloff J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3863-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) at the NcoI site of the 5.6-kb BamHI fragment containing the URA3gene. The different alleles used were subclones of this fragment inserted at a HpaI site within LYS2 sequences in the integrative plasmid pOI5 (TRP1 LYS2 URA3). These alleles were integrated into the yeast chromosome IIby a two-step replacement method, selecting first for Trp+transformants and then plating on 5-FOA plates to obtain Trp−Ura− derivatives, which have replaced theLYS2 allele on chromosome II by the appropriatelys2::ura3-HOcs allele. All of the strain configurations were checked by Southern blot analysis. The ura3 fragments present on chromosome II in the strains used are as follows: strain OI70 carries a 5.6-kbBamHI DNA fragment; MK187 carries a BamHI toSmaI 4.7-kb fragment; MK186 carries a SnaBI toBamHI 4.1-kb insert; OI87 has aSnaBI-HincII 2.9-kb fragment; OI86 and MK201 carry 1.9- and 1.7-kb AseI-Asp700 fragments, respectively; OI90 carries anAseI-HincII 1.2-kb allele; MK29 has a 1.2-kbHindIII-HindIII insert; OI92 carries anAseI-HincII 1-kb fragment; OI30 has aPstI-StuI 0.5-kb allele; OI91 carries a 4.1-kbBamHI-AccI fragment; and OI94 has a 2.9-kbNdeI-PvuII allele. In this last strain, a PCR fragment carrying 923 bp to the right of the 5.6-kb fragment was added to the cloned ura3 allele before integrating it at theLYS2 locus. Deletion of the MMR genes were created by one- or two-step transplacement using plasmids pSR211 for PMS1, pSR453 forMLH1, pSR395 for MSH2, pRK366 forMSH3, and pRK465 for MSH6 (15Alani E. Reenan R.A.G. Kolodner R.D. Genetics. 1994; 137: 19-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Datta A. Hendrix M. Lipsitch M. Jinks-Robertson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9757-9762Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). All of the configurations were checked by Southern blot analysis. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were grown at 30 °C. Standard YEP medium (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone) supplemented with 3% glycerol (YEPGly), 2% galactose (YEPGal), or 2% dextrose (YEPD) was used for nonselective growth. 1.8% Bacto-agar was added for solid media. Single colonies were resuspended in rich YEPGly medium, grown to logarithmic phase, centrifuged, and resuspended in YEPGal or YEPD medium. DNA was extracted from samples at timely intervals and subjected to Southern blot analysis usingURA3 or LYS2 sequences as probes. Two Southern blot analyses were performed. In the first one, the probe could detect the presence of a parental band or of the broken chromosome. The repaired chromosome appeared as a band of the same size as the parental one (see Fig. 2 B). In the second Southern blot, the same DNA samples were digested withBamHI or EcoRI. This blot allowed monitoring of the parental allele, which was not cut by these restriction enzymes (e.g. Fig. 3). In all of the experiments presented, by 12 h after transfer to galactose less than 5% of the DNA retained its parental configuration (was not cut byBamHI or EcoRI). The blots were also hybridized to a probe carrying the LEU2 gene. This gene is located on a separate chromosome and remained unchanged during the course of the experiments, serving as a loading control. The blots were quantified with a Fujix BAS1000 phosphorimager.Figure 3The broken chromosome is repaired by gene conversion. A, strain OI70. Lanes 1–3 show DNA from cells taken at 0, 2, or 10 h after transfer to galactose-containing medium. The DNA was digested with SphI and XbaI and probed with a fragment of chromosomeV carrying the URA3 gene. The reference band comes from the unbroken chromosome V, which is used to estimate the amount of DNA in each lane. Two hours after transfer, most cells show broken chromosomes. Ten hours after transfer, the DSB bands disappeared, and the parental band reappeared (together with the products of translocation). Lanes 4 and5 show the same DNA samples digested with NcoI and BamHI. The presence of the BamHI transferred during the gene conversion can be monitored (a similar analysis was carried out to detect the transfer of the EcoRI site). The parental band seen 10 h after transfer accounts for 1.2% of the DNA and represents the maximal estimate of repair events that did not involve the transfer of the BamHI site. Thus, ∼99% of the cells have repaired the DSB by gene conversion 10 h after transfer to galactose. B, strain OI29; similar to A, except that the probe is a fragment from the LYS2 gene on chromosome II. The DNA was digested with BglII (lanes 1–3) or BglII and BamHI (lanes 4 and 5). The reference bands represent adjacent fragments on chromosome II. The parental band remaining 10 h after transfer represent 0.9% of the DNA implying, again, that 99% of the cells of OI29 repaired the broken chromosome by gene conversion. No bands indicative of reciprocal recombination could be detected (asterisks denote the place where they would have been found).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For each strain tested, the experiment was repeated at least three times. Survival was assayed by plating at different times during the experiment. The survival of all strains was usually ∼90%. Individual colonies were also subjected to PCR and restriction digestion withBamHI or EcoRI, to confirm the transfer of information from the donor chromosome in individual colonies. Reciprocal translocations were also monitored by Southern blot analysis from independently obtained colonies grown on galactose. To study the way crossing over is associated with gene conversion, we have developed an assay for DSB-initiated interchromosomal recombination (Ref. 20Sugawara N. Paques F. Colaiacovo M. Haber J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9214-9219Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar; Fig.2 A). Haploid strains of the yeast S. cerevisiaebear two copies of the URA3 gene. One of these strains, on chromosome II, carries the recognition site for the yeast HO site-specific endonuclease (8White C.I. Haber J.E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 17Nickoloff J.A. Singer J.D. Heffron F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1174-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) inserted as a short oligonucleotide (ura3-HOcs). The second copy, located on another chromosome (V), carries a similar site containing a single-bp mutation that prevents recognition by the endonuclease (ura3-HOcs-inc(17Nickoloff J.A. Singer J.D. Heffron F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1174-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)). In addition, the two ura3 alleles differ at two restriction sites, located to the right and to the left of theHOcs-inc insertion; these polymorphisms are used to follow the transfer of information between the chromosomes. In these strains, the HO gene is under the transcriptional control of theGAL1 promoter (18Sandell L.L. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Upon transfer of the cells to galactose-containing medium, the HO endonuclease is produced at high levels. The enzyme creates a DSB that is repaired by recombination in essentially the whole cell population. The repair is carried out by copying the HOcs-inc information, together with the flanking markers, resulting in a gene conversion event. During repair, the donor chromosome remains unchanged. When the gene conversion event is accompanied by a crossover, a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes II and V is created. The region around the break is completely homologous with the unbroken allele, so as to avoid production of nonhomologous tails, which might affect the recombinational repair (19Paques F. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6765-6771Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 20Sugawara N. Paques F. Colaiacovo M. Haber J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9214-9219Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Because there is no genetic selection for recombination, repair is monitored in the entire cell population (Fig. 2 A). During the course of the experiment, cell viability remains high (∼90%). The kinetics of recombination of a strain carrying 5.6 kb of shared homology between the twoura3 alleles (OI70) was followed. DNA samples taken at intervals were subjected to two different restriction digestions followed by Southern blot analysis. In the first blot (Fig.2 B), we monitored the appearance and disappearance of the DSB. Induction of the HO endonuclease created a chromosomal break, which could be followed by the appearance of two new bands and the concomitant decrease in intensity of the parental band. Repair of the broken chromosome led to the disappearance of the small DSB bands and the creation of a band of the same size as the parental. To distinguish between the parental band and the recombinant products, the same DNA samples were subjected to a second Southern blot analysis. In this blot, the conversion products were recognized by the presence ofEcoRI or BamHI sites transferred during the repair of the DSB (data not shown and Fig. 3 A). Only unbroken chromosomes that have not been repaired by gene conversion give a parental band. Fig. 3 A shows that most of the population has undergone a gene conversion event by 10 h. The results of the two blots can be integrated in a quantitative way (Fig. 2 C). As a reference point in each lane, we used the intensity measured for either the band created by hybridization to the unbroken chromosome V or to the LEU2 gene on chromosome III, which does not participate in the repair event (the results were identical). Within 30 min after transfer, two new bands were seen, representing the broken chromosome arms. One hour after transfer, a broken chromosome II could be detected in almost the entire cell population. Most of the cells remained with unrepaired chromosomes for another hour, and then the break was repaired by gene conversion in a process that lasted ∼2.5 h. Repair of the broken chromosome led to the disappearance of the small DSB bands and the creation of a band of the same size as the parental. The repair involved the transfer of the BamHI andEcoRI restriction site polymorphisms from chromosomeV to chromosome II. The transfer was confirmed by a second Southern blot analysis (using these restriction enzymes) of both whole cell populations (Fig. 3 A) and of 24 individual cells that had undergone the repair process. Concomitantly with the gene conversion, there was an accumulation of the bands created by the associated crossing over, which reached a maximal level of 12.4% (Fig.2, B and C), in agreement with the level of association seen in previous mitotic studies (1Petes T.D. Malone R.E. Symington L.S. Broach J.R. Pringle J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Genome Dynamics, Protein Synthesis and Energetics.

Strathern J.A. Curr. Genet. 1993; 23: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). An analysis of individual recombinant colonies confirmed the presence of reciprocal translocations between chromosomes II andV (data not shown). When a strain carrying only 1.2 kb of shared homology between the twoura3 alleles (OI29) was analyzed, the DSB was repaired in the entire cell population by gene conversion (Fig. 2 B). Surprisingly, however, no crossing-over products could be detected in Southern blot analyses. By quantitative PCR, we estimated that crossing over in OI29 occurred only in 0.09% of the cells; this level of crossing over is lower by two orders of magnitude than that seen in the strain with the longer homologous substrates (12.4%). Hence, in both strains the DSB was efficiently repaired by gene conversion, but an uncoupling of crossing over from gene conversion occurred during recombination in the strain with shorter substrates. To further study how homology size affects the coupling between gene conversion and crossing over, we tested a series of yeast strains carrying ura3-HOcs alleles of different lengths (Fig.4). Gene conversion was very efficient (>90% of the cells) independently of the length of the shared homology. Even short alleles (e.g. OI30, 496 bp) were efficiently repaired by gene conversion. In contrast, crossing over could not be detected by Southern analysis for alleles shorter than 1.7 kb (Fig. 4). These results are consistent with the existence of a homology length threshold. In strains that bear alleles sharing homology longer than the threshold, the coupling of crossing over to gene conversion increased with the overall length of homology between the recombining DNA molecules. Fig. 4 shows that the coupling does not depend only on overall homology length; a minimal region of homology in each broken arm is necessary to obtain crossing over. For example, strains OI91 and MK186 each bear 4.1 kb of shared homology between the ura3 alleles. Although the first strain, carrying 139 bp of homology on one arm, failed to show any crossing over (below the level of detection of Southern blot analysis, ∼0.5% of the DNA), MK186, with 2.5 and 1.6 kb of shared homology on the broken arms, showed 4.5% crossing over (Fig. 4). The mismatch repair (MMR) system has been implicated in the prevention of recombination between diverged sequences in many organisms (15Alani E. Reenan R.A.G. Kolodner R.D. Genetics. 1994; 137: 19-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Datta A. Hendrix M. Lipsitch M. Jinks-Robertson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9757-9762Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 23Rayssiguier C. Thaler D.S. Radman M. Nature. 1989; 342: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 24Datta A. Adjiri A.

Biol. 1998; 18: 6525-6537Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The MMR gene products thus are good candidates for proteins that may affect the association between gene conversion and crossing over. We inactivated the MMR system by introducing mutations in the MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, and PMS1 genes in strain OI29 (1.2 kb of shared homology). Although repair by gene conversion was not affected in the quadruple mutant, crossing over was elevated 24-fold in comparison with the wild type strain; 2.2% of the mutant cells showed a crossover associated with the gene conversion (Fig.5 A). Thus, MMR proteins play a role in uncoupling crossing over from gene conversion. Analysis of strains bearing mutations in individual MMR genes revealed that the increased crossing over can be seen in the absence of the Msh2 or Msh6 proteins, but not when the MSH3 or PMS1 genes are deleted (Fig. 5 B). Although in the figure the double mutantmsh2 msh6 shows slightly higher levels of crossing over than the individual msh2 or msh6 mutants (2.5versus 1.8 and 1.7% of the total DNA), this difference does not seem to be significant, as it was not seen in other Southern blots. We conclude that the MSH2 and MSH6 genes operate in the same pathway. The Msh2 protein was shown to form heterodimers with both Msh3p and Msh6p (26Iaccarino I. Palombo F. Drummond J. Totty N.F.

The Msh2-Msh6 heterodimer shows affinity for both base pair mismatches and single nucleotide insertion/deletions (26Iaccarino I. Palombo F. Drummond J. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. Modrich P. Jiricny J.

Lately, the Msh2/Msh6 protein complex has been shown to bind directly to Holliday junctions, providing a possible mechanism for linking the mismatch repair system to recombination (30Marsischky G.T. Lee S. Griffith J. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7200-7206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). When a chromosome is broken, homologous sequences present in the genome can be used as templates for its repair by recombination. The transfer of genetic information to the broken DNA molecule during recombinational repair prevents mutagenesis by restoring information that may have been eliminated at the site of the DNA damage. In addition, repair by recombination ensures the restoration of the original chromosomal structure when a chromosome is fragmented. On the other hand, recombinational repair of DNA damage using repetitive sequences as templates may result in deleterious chromosomal aberrations when it results in crossing over of the interacting molecules. Repetitive DNA sequences are abundant in the genomes of most eukaryotes. Hence, it is important to understand how crossing over involving dispersed repeats can be prevented. The study of the mechanism of homologous recombination is hampered by the fact that it usually requires the selection of rare genetic products. This selection introduces biases into the type of events analyzed and precludes an understanding of the processes that take place in the majority of the cells. To overcome these problems, we have developed a recombination system that allows monitoring of the fate of a cell population that has suffered a chromosomal break, without the need to select for recombinants. The repair of the broken chromosome is carried out in the whole cell population by a gene conversion event. This event may or may not be associated with a crossover. We have systematically investigated the rules that govern this coupling. We have found that gene conversion can take place efficiently between sequences that share a short stretch of homology (250 bp on each broken arm, OI30). The coupling to crossing over, in contrast, requires a minimal homology length of about 1.7 kb (MK201). Below this threshold, the level of association decreases by two orders of magnitude. In agreement with these results, the repair of a chromosomal DSB by gene conversion in mouse ES cells carrying alleles that share 1.1 kb of homology was not associated with crossing over (31Richardson C. Moynahan M.E. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3831-3842Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The coupling between gene conversion and crossing over does not depend only on overall homology length; to obtain a crossover, the template allele must share a minimal amount of homology with both broken chromosomal arms. When one of the arms shares only a short stretch of homology, no crossing over is observed, even when a large region of the other arm is homologous (Fig. 4). Among the strains that exhibit crossing over, we found a correlation between the total homology length and the level of associated crossing over (r 2 = 0.75). This linear relationship, however, is not necessarily the best function to describe the relationship between homology length and associated crossover (see for example Ref. 32Fujitani Y. Yamamoto K. Kobayashi I. Genetics. 1995; 140: 797-809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, a similar correlation between the length of the homologous partners and the level of associated crossing over was seen in a system that monitored spontaneous interchromosomal recombination (5Jinks-Robertson S Michelitch M. Ramcharan R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3937-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In a different study, the level of crossing over showed a correlation with the length of the conversion tract (33Aguilera A. Klein H. Genetics. 1989; 123: 683-694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results were interpreted to mean that crossing over requires the formation of a long heteroduplex intermediate; alleles sharing short homology length would be unable to create such an intermediate and therefore to produce crossovers. Our results agree with those obtained for spontaneous recombination. When monitoring spontaneous recombination, however, the nature and location of the initiating lesion is unknown. In our strains, the initiating lesion is of a defined nature (a DSB) and is always at the same location. The results we have obtained thus provide direct evidence that under conditions in which the initiation is not limiting, efficient gene conversion takes place even between very short homologous regions, whereas crossing over requires a larger minimal length. We propose the following model to explain the mechanism that determines coupling between gene conversion and crossing over in recombination (Fig. 6). It incorporates features from both currently held recombination models, the DSB repair (4Szostak J.W. Orr-Weaver T.L. Rothstein R. Stahl F.W. Cell. 1983; 3: 725-738Google Scholar) and the SDSA (12Nassif N. Penney J. Pal S. Engels E.R. Gloor G.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1613-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 34Formosa T.

Nickoloff J.A. Genetics. 1998; 148: 59-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) models (Fig. 1). The first model assumes that both broken arms invade the donor DNA molecule, whereas the different versions of the SDSA model propose that recombination is initiated by the invasion by only one of the DNA ends. We have observed that during repair, genetic information is always transferred to both broken arms of chromosome II. In 22 of 24 cases analyzed, the restriction site polymorphisms located to the right as well as to the left of the DSB were co-transferred. This observation could be explained by one-ended models, but it would require making several assumptions. A simpler and more parsimonious model assumes that recombination takes place by the invasion of the two broken arms, either concomitantly or sequentially. We present the following model, which incorporates features from the two types of models discussed, to explain the mechanism that determines the coupling between gene conversion and crossing over in recombination (Fig. 6). After the formation of the break, a 5′ to 3′ resection of ssDNA exposes 3′ ends (Fig. 6 a), that can invade the homologous DNA (Fig. 6 b). At this stage, the mismatches present in the short DNA duplex created by the invasion are repaired. This repair is directional; the invading DNA strand is always corrected using the information present in the invaded DNA (Fig. 6 c). Evidence for a fast, directional repair was obtained for recombination at theMAT locus (38Haber J.E. Ray B.L. Kolb J.M. White C.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3363-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The repair could be carried out by the 3′ to 5′ proofreading activity of the DNA polymerase itself (19Paques F. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6765-6771Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 39Holmes A.M. Haber J.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 415-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), which would then proceed with DNA synthesis. Recombination can then continue by two different pathways; in one of them, the invading DNA strands complete DNA synthesis, resulting in the formation of a double Holliday junction (Fig. 6 d), which can now be resolved to give either a gene conversion event or a gene conversion event accompanied by a crossover (Fig. 6, e and f) (4Szostak J.W. Orr-Weaver T.L. Rothstein R. Stahl F.W. Cell. 1983; 3: 725-738Google Scholar). In the second pathway, the intermediate shown in Fig. 6 c is disassembled, and the newly synthesized DNA molecules re-anneal to each other, resulting in a gene conversion event that is never accompanied by a crossover (Fig. 6 e) (12Nassif N. Penney J. Pal S. Engels E.R. Gloor G.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1613-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 34Formosa T. Alberts B.M. Cell. 1986; 47: 793-806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 35Belmaaza A. Chartrand P. Mutat. Res. 1994; 314: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 36Paques F.

The choice of pathway determines whether there is a coupling between gene conversion and crossing over (9Nasmyth K.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1982; 16: 439-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 11Klein L.H. Nature. 1984; 310: 748-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We suggest that the choice is dependent on the stability of the key intermediate depicted in Fig. 6 c. Hence, the correlation between homology length and crossing over association reflects the increasing stability of this intermediate, in agreement with results obtained when spontaneous recombination was monitored (5Jinks-Robertson S Michelitch M. Ramcharan R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3937-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 33Aguilera A. Klein H. Genetics. 1989; 123: 683-694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The choice between the pathways could be regulated in an active way to allow the uncoupling to crossing over in response to specific conditions such as limited homology on either of the invading DNA ends (Fig. 4). Specific proteins may recognize the recombination intermediate and influence its stability. Good candidates for such proteins are the members of the MMR system, which have been shown to play an anti-recombinational role in many systems (23Rayssiguier C. Thaler D.S. Radman M. Nature. 1989; 342: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). We have shown that the MMR proteins play a role in uncoupling crossing over from gene conversion; mutations in the MSH2 or MSH6 genes allow the detection of crossing over in strains bearing short homologous alleles. Our results suggest that the Msh2-Msh6 heterodimer may be responsible for preventing crossing over after strand invasion, either by recognizing mismatches in the newly formed heteroduplex or by destabilizing the Holliday junction. Consistent with our results, the conversion tracts were found in a recent study to be larger in MMR mutants compared with the wild type (25Chen W. Jinks-Robertson S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6525-6537Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The presence of bound MMR proteins may destabilize the intermediate depicted in Fig.6 c, for example, by affecting the direction of branch migration, leading to the resolution of the intermediate (15Alani E. Reenan R.A.G. Kolodner R.D. Genetics. 1994; 137: 19-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The annealing of the newly synthesized strands would result in a gene conversion event not associated with crossing over (Fig.6 e). In the absence of the Msh2 or Msh6 proteins, the intermediate is not destabilized, resulting in an increased level of crossing over (Fig. 5). It should be noted that in contrast to their effect on crossing over, our results imply that the MMR proteins are not required to carry out gene conversion events during mitotic recombinational repair of DSBs (40Porter G.

Msh2p and Msh3p, however, do seem to play a role in DSB-induced gene conversion, when nonhomologous genetic information has to be removed from the broken chromosomal ends (13Inbar O. Kupiec M. Mol.

The ability of yeast cells to find homology and use it to repair the break is essential for their survival. The presence of repetitive sequences in the genomes of most eukaryotes presents a challenge; if a chromosome breaks close to a member of a repetitive sequence family, recombinational repair may produce chromosomal aberrations. The mechanism that allows the cells to deal with this challenge involves uncoupling gene conversion from crossing over when repeated sequences are identified through their limited homology length and/or sequence divergence.

https://openalex.org/W2155723421,"Given the roles proposed for gap junctional intercellular communication in neuronal differentiation and growth control, we examined the effects of connexin43 (Cx43) expression in a neuroblastoma cell line. A vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSVG)-pseudotyped retrovector was engineered to co-express the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and Cx43 in the communication-deficient neuro-2a (N2a) cell line. The 293 GPG packaging cell line was used to produce VSVG-pseudotyped retrovectors coding for GFP, Cx43, or chimeric Cx43·GFP fusion protein. The titer of viral supernatant, as measured by flow cytometry for GFP fluorescence, was approximately 2.0 × 107 colony form units (CFU)/ml and was free of replication-competent retroviruses. After a 7-day treatment with retinoic acid (20 μm), N2a transformants (N2a-Cx43 and N2a-Cx43·GFP) maintained the expression of Cx43 and Cx43·GFP. Expression of both constructs resulted in functional coupling, as evidenced by electrophysiological and dye-injection analysis. Suppression of cell growth correlated with expression of both Cx43 or Cx43·GFP and retinoic acid treatment. Based on morphology and immunocytochemistry for neurofilament, no difference was observed in the differentiation of N2a cells compared with cells expressing Cx43 constructs. In conclusion, constitutive expression of Cx43 in N2a cells does not alter retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation but does enhance growth inhibition.

The fundamental structural unit of the gap junction is the connexin (Cx)1 subunit. To clarify the role of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) in neural development, the temporal and cellular expression of connexins has been studied. Cx43 is present in neurons in vivo (4Nadarajah B. Thomaidou D. Evans W.H. Parnavelas J.G. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 376: 326-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and in vitro (5Rozental R.

Several studies have demonstrated that neuronal GJIC decreases during differentiation (8Kandler K. Katz L.C. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that Cx43-mediated GJIC decreases with neuronal differentiation (7Bani-Yaghoub M. Bechberger J.F. Naus C.C. J. Neurosci.

Given the multiple roles proposed for Cx43-mediated GJIC in development and differentiation, many studies have been undertaken to alter Cx43 expression both in vitro through transfection (11Naus C.C.

Science. 1995; 267: 1831-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). The major limitations to transfection approaches have been efficiency and time required to obtain stable gene expression. The recent advent of retroviral vectors to efficiently deliver genes for stable expression overcomes these limitations (16Burns J.C. Friedmann T. Driever W. Burrascano M. Yee J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8033-8037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar, 17Aboody-Guterman K.S. Pechan P.A. Rainov N.G. Sena-Esteves M. Jacobs A. Snyder E.Y. Wild P. Schraner E. Tobler K.

Retroviral vectors enable efficient gene transfer and stable gene expression in cells that are not readily susceptible to transfection, such as primary cells, cells in vivo, and neuronal cell lines (18Frederick M.A. Roger B. Robert E.K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 9.9-9.14Google Scholar). However, the titer of most current retroviral supernatants is too low (<107 particles/ml) to achieve acceptable clinical results (19Galipeau J. Li H. Paquin A. Sicilia F. Karpati G. Nalbantoglu J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2384-2394PubMed Google Scholar). To overcome this deficit, more recently developed retrovectors pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSVG) protein have become the gene delivery tool of choice (16Burns J.C. Friedmann T. Driever W. Burrascano M. Yee J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8033-8037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). VSVG-pseudotyped retrovectors have advantages over the current viral vectors in terms of high titer, complement resistance, particle stability and tumor specificity (19Galipeau J. Li H. Paquin A. Sicilia F. Karpati G. Nalbantoglu J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2384-2394PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, the VSVG-pseudotyped retrovector enabled efficient stable expression of Cx43 and Cx43·GFP. Cell growth was suppressed but neuronal differentiation was unaffected. The C6 astrocytoma cell line (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA; CCL-107) and neuro-2a mouse neuroblastoma cell line (ATCC, CCL-131) were maintained as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, Inc., Burlington, ON) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C, in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. The 293 GPG retroviral packaging cell line (20Ory D.S. Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. Richard C. Mulligan (Children's Hospital, Boston, MA). 293 GPG cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in 293 medium consisting of DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.3 μg/ml G418 (Mediatech, Herndon, VA), 2.0 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma Chemical Co.), and 1.0 μg/ml tetracycline (Fisher Scientific, Nepean, Ontario, Canada) at 37 °C, in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. The AP2 retroviral vector (19Galipeau J. Li H. Paquin A. Sicilia F. Karpati G. Nalbantoglu J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2384-2394PubMed Google Scholar) was used in these studies. Two genes including an inserted cDNA and the enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter gene can be expressed from this single bicistronic, nonsplicing murine plasmid retrovector (Fig. 1 A) (19Galipeau J. Li H. Paquin A. Sicilia F. Karpati G. Nalbantoglu J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2384-2394PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA fragment coding for IRES and EGFP was removed from the plasmid backbone by single endonuclease digestion withNotI, and the resulting fragment was religated together as outlined below. The resulting plasmid was designated NAP2 (Fig.1 B). The Cx43 cDNA (1.45 kilobases) (43Beyer E.C. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2621-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. E. Beyer, Washington University, School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO) and the Cx43·GFP chimeric cDNA (2.25 kilobases) was removed from the pEGFPN1Cx43 plasmid (44Jordan K. Solan J.L. Dominquez M. Sia M. Hand A. Lampe P.D. Laird D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2033-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) was inserted into the NAP2 vector. The resulting plasmids were designated NAP2Cx43 and NAP2Cx43·GFP (Fig. 1,C and D). To produce pseudotype retroviral vectors, 293 GPG cells were plated at 2 × 106 cells per 60-mm dish the night before transfection in 293 media. They were then transiently transfected with AP2, NAP2Cx43, and NAP2Cx43·GFP plasmid retrovectors by the LipofectAMINE PLUSTM (Life Technologies, Inc.) procedure according to the manufacturer's instructions. Serum-free DMEM medium with tetracycline (1 μg/ml) was used for all of the transfection processes. After a 6-h incubation of cells in the incubator, an additional 2 ml of the 293 medium was added for transfection. The following morning, the medium was replaced with fresh 293 medium. On the next day, the 293 medium was removed from cells and replaced with 3 ml of DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum. On the next day, the supernatants were collected about every 12–24 h for 1 week. All culture supernatants were filtered through 0.45-μm syringe-mounted filters (Gelman Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI). The filtered culture supernatants were used as infectious viral stock for subsequent experiments. Aliquots of 1.0 ml were also frozen at −80 °C for later use. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to determine the titer of the viral supernatant as measured by GFP fluorescence. In brief, 2 × 105 C6 cells/well were plated in 6-well tissue culture plates the night before infecting the cells with the retrovirus. The next day, cells from 3 wells were trypsinized and counted to determine the average number of cells per well at the time of exposure to retrovirus. Serial dilutions (1:10) of the viral supernatant in a final volume of 1 ml of DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum were prepared and added to each well. The following day, 2.0 ml of medium were added, and cells were incubated for 2 more days. Three days after viral infection, the transduced C6 cells were trypsinized and resuspended in 2 ml of DMEM for flow cytometric analysis assay. Analysis was performed on a FACStarPlusTM(Becton Dickinson). Live C6 cells were gated based on scatter/side scatter profile and analyzed for GFP fluorescence to determine the percentage of GFP-positive cells. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using CELLQuestTM software (Becton Dickinson). The titer (colony-forming units (CFU) per ml) was calculated as: (% GFP-positive cells × cell number at initial viral exposure)/viral volume (ml) applied when transduction was not saturated (19Galipeau J. Li H. Paquin A. Sicilia F. Karpati G. Nalbantoglu J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2384-2394PubMed Google Scholar). C6 cells infected with GFP were passed in culture for 6 weeks (15 passages) to allow for spread of RCR that might be present. 3 ml of culture supernatant from these C6 cells was then used to infect 106naı̈ve C6 cells, and 48 h later, the newly infected naı̈ve cells were evaluated by detecting GFP-fluorescent cells. Both undifferentiated and differentiated N2a wild-type and transformant cell cultures were washed twice with PBS and scraped off the plates in lysis buffer (0.05 m Tris, pH 6.8, 0.1% SDS) with a rubber policeman. The protein concentration of the cell lysate was determined in each case using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Protein samples from an equal number of cells (2.5 × 105 each) were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) at 5 watts overnight. Membranes were stained with Ponseau S to control for protein loading and transfer. The membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk (NFDM) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, incubated with monoclonal anti-Cx43 primary antibody overnight at 4 °C in PBS with 1% NFDM, washed with PBS, and incubated 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody in PBS with 1% NFDM at room temperature. Finally, membranes were incubated with Supersignal substrate working solution (Pierce) for 5 min and exposed to autoradiographic film for 2–10 min. For this study the following primary antibodies were used: 1) affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-Cx43 CT-360 (21Laird, D. W., and Revel, J. P. (1990) J. Cell Sci. 97, Part 1, 109–117.Google Scholar) (5 μg/ml); 2) affinity-purified mouse monoclonal anti-Cx43 (1 μg/ml, Chemicon, Temecula, CA); 3) affinity-purified mouse monoclonal anti-neurofilament 200 (phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated, 1 μg/ml, Sigma). Secondary antibodies were obtained from Dimension Laboratories (Mississauga, ON), and included goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (1 μg/ml) and goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Cy3 (1 μg/ml). Cells were grown to confluence on glass, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (w/v) for 10 min at 4 °C, washed with PBS, pH 7.4, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature, blocked in PBS with 10% (v/v) normal goat serum (Dimension Laboratories) and 1.0% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 30 min, and then incubated for 1 h with primary antibody(s) in PBS with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The coverslips were washed with PBS and then incubated for 1 h with the secondary antibody(s) in PBS with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Coverslips were again washed and were mounted on slides in PBS containing 50% (v/v) glycerol and 1% (w/v)p-phenylenediamine (Fisher Scientific) to minimize quenching of the fluorescent signal. Fluorescence was visualized on a Zeiss Axiophot photomicroscope (Zeiss, North York, ON). Samples incubated without primary antibody served as negative controls. Monolayers of undifferentiated and differentiated N2a, N2a-Cx43, and N2a-Cx43·GFP cells grown on coverslips were placed in a bath chamber containing culture medium at room temperature (∼22 °C) and viewed with a Leica DMIRB inverted microscope with a × 20 phase-contrast objective. Glass microelectrodes were prepared from microcapillary tubing (World Precision Instruments (WPI), Kwik-Fill, no. 1B100F-3) with a Narishige vertical microelectrode puller. After backfilling with 1 mKCl, the electrodes had tip resistances of 40–80 megohm. They were mounted on mechanical micromanipulators (Leica) and connected by chlorinated silver wires to electrometers (WPI, Intra 767). The bath was grounded using a copper wire connected to the bath chamber. Two independent electrodes were used, one to pass current into a cell and the other to record changes in membrane potentials at various distances, i.e. 25, 100, and 400 μm respectively. Electrotonic potentials were generated by passing hyperpolarizing pulses of current (50 nA; 100 ms) down one electrode from a stimulus-isolating instrument (WPI, A310 Accupulser). Membrane and electrotonic potentials were recorded on a Gould RS 3200 two channel recorder. In cell coupling experiments, each measurement of the electrotonic voltage at a given interelectrode distance required that both the electrodes obtain and maintain the full cell membrane potential. Upon insertion of a microelectrode into a cell, a sharp drop in the electrometer reading (identified as the resting membrane potential) was noted. Current pulsing was initiated shortly after gaining a stable membrane potential at the injecting electrode; after 4–5 pulses, the electrode was removed. Upon removal of the electrode from the cell, the measured potential returned to zero: recordings that did not return to within 10% of the baseline were assumed to be ruptured cells, and these recordings were discarded. Three interelectrode distances were used: 25 μm (the distance to an adjacent cell), 100 μm, and 400 μm. Clusters of N2a wild-type and N2a transformants that had been infected with retrovector encoding Cx43 or Cx43·GFP were pressure injected with 10 mmcarboxyfluorescein (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in distilled water using an Eppendorf microinjection system (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). In all cases, it took up less than one minute for carboxyfluorescein to pass to adjacent cells after 0.5-s pressure injection. To be regarded as coupled, at least one adjacent cell received the dye from the injected donor cell. N2a wild-type and transformants from confluent cultures were seeded at 2.0 × 105cells per 6-well culture plate. The growth analysis was carried out in the absence and present of retinoic acid (RA) (20 μm). The cell viability was determined by trypan blue staining. At day 0, 3, 5, and 12 after plating, triplicate plates were dissociated with 0.25% trypsin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1 mm EDTA (BDH) in PBS, pH 7.4 and counted in a COULTER COUNTER® Z1 Series Particle Counter (Coulter Electronics, Burlington, ON). Statistical analysis involving testing for significance of differences for quantitative observations was performed. First, all sets of data were subjected to a one-way analysis of variance to determine significant difference between any two sets. Subsequently, the sets of data were subjected to Student'st test to determine whether significant differences existed between the individual samples. The data was analyzed with Prism (Graphpad Inc. Software, San Diego, CA). Cells were evaluated with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope equipped with a filter set for fluorescein (exciter filter BP 485, banner filter 515–565 nm) and for Cy3 (exciter filter BP 546, banner filter BP 590) using × 40 or × 63 Plan-Neufluor objectives. The images were captured using Sensicontrol 4.02 (The Optikon Corporation Ltd., Kitchener, ON). Once all of the digital images were captured, they were imported and compiled into final figures using Adobe Photoshop 5.0 (Adobe Systems Incorporated, San Jose, CA) and Corel Draw 8.0 (Corel Co., Ottawa, ON). C6 cells were chosen for titering retrovector supernatant as C6 cells divide rapidly and are easily infected. Using GFP as a reporter protein allowed the rapid titration of retroviral supernatant. The supernatant containing AP2 retrovector was sequentially collected, filtered, and serially diluted in a final volume of 1 ml and added to 3.28 × 105 C6 cells/well in a 6-well plate. Three days after a single application of retrovector, the infected C6 cells were analyzed by flow cytometric analysis to determine the percentage of cells expressing the GFP reporter protein (Fig.2). The titer extrapolated from these experiments was about 2.0 × 107 CFU/ml, calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This titer is at least 1,000 times higher than that of NIH 3T3-based retroviral packaging cell lines (22Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar). C6 cells infected with viral supernatant containing AP2 retrovectors demonstrated strong GFP fluorescence for at least 15 passages over a 6-week period (Fig.3). Naturally or because of recombination events, viruses that contain all of the cis-acting viral elements and genes coding for necessary viral structural proteins are “replication-competent” (18Frederick M.A. Roger B. Robert E.K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 9.9-9.14Google Scholar). To test for RCR, 3 ml of culture supernatant from these C6 cells was then used to infect 106 naı̈ve C6 cells. 48 h later the newly infected naı̈ve cells were evaluated by detecting GFP-fluorescent cells. Retroviruses produced from 293 GPG packaging cells were free of detectable RCR upon long term cultivation as demonstrated by the failure of GFP fluorescence to be transferred from virally transduced C6 cells to naı̈ve C6 cells (data not shown). Communication-deficient N2a cells were infected with retrovector encoding for Cx43 and Cx43·GFP to determine their ability to express full-length Cx43 and Cx43·GFP chimeric protein after differentiation. Wild-type N2a and N2a-GFP cells were used as controls. The synthesis of Cx43 and Cx43·GFP protein was investigated by Western blot analysis of total cell lysates from wild-type N2a cells, N2a-GFP, N2a-Cx43, and N2a-Cx43·GFP transformants under differentiated conditions. Differentiated N2a-Cx43 and N2a-Cx43·GFP cells expressed Cx43 protein (42–44 kDa) and Cx43·GFP protein (72–74 kDa) (Fig.4). As expected Cx43 was not detected in wild-type N2a cells or N2a-GFP expressing cells. The C6–13 cells which were transfected with Cx43 were used as a positive control, and contain multiple bands of immunoreactivity, which represents phosphorylated and unphosphorylated species of Cx43 (23Musil L.S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2077-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). The low amount of phosphorylated species in N2a cells infected with wild-type Cx43 or Cx43·GFP cDNAs may reflect poor post-translational processing of Cx43 in this cell line. To determine the localization of Cx43 in N2a-Cx43, N2a-Cx43·GFP, N2a-GFP, or wild-type N2a cells, differentiated or undifferentiated cells were either immunolabeled with anti-Cx43 antibodies or directly examined for GFP fluorescence (Fig.5). In both undifferentiated and differentiated N2a-Cx43 and N2a-Cx43·GFP cells, Cx43 was localized to areas of cell-cell contact as well as in punctate structures within the cytoplasm (Fig. 5, A,B, E, and F). As control, GFP fluorescence was located throughout the cytoplasm in N2a-GFP cells (Fig. 5, C and G) and no fluorescence was detected in wild-type N2a cells immunolabeled for Cx43 (Fig. 5,D and H). In all cases, the undifferentiated N2a and N2a transformants were not neurofilament positive (data not shown). An induction of neurofilament protein (200 kDa, phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated) was apparent in processes of wild-type N2a cells and all three N2a transformants (N2a-GFP, N2a-Cx43 and N2a-Cx43·GFP) after 20 μm RA treatment for 7 days (Fig. 5,I, J, K, and L). On average, 90% of the cells were neurofilament positive after exposure to 20 μm RA for 7 days. There was no apparent difference in neurofilament staining between wild-type N2a, N2a-Cx43 and N2a-Cx43·GFP cells. To determine whether Cx43 and Cx43·GFP formed functional gap junction channels in N2a cells before and after differentiation, communication-deficient N2a cells and N2a-Cx43 and N2a-Cx43·GFP transformants were examined for electrical coupling. For undifferentiated N2a-Cx43 cells, electrotonic spread of injected current, resulting in a membrane potential change at the second electrode, could be detected 400 μm from the injecting electrode (n = 8). For undifferentiated N2a-Cx43·GFP cells, potential deflections were detected at 25 μm (n = 8) but only twice in six attempts at 100 μm and never at 400 μm (n = 8). Conversely, undifferentiated N2a cells displayed no electrical coupling at any distance tested (n = 9). In differentiated N2a-Cx43 cells, potential defections were detected at 400 μm (n = 4). Also, potential deflections were detectable in differentiated N2a-Cx43·GFP cells at 25 μm (n = 3) but not at 100 μm (n = 2) or 400 μm (n = 4). Thus, both N2a-Cx43 and N2a-Cx43·GFP cells formed gap junctional channels that were electrically coupled. In addition, the N2a-Cx43·GFP cells appeared less adherent (i.e. they were easily pulled off the coverslip by the microeletrodes, which may account for the differences in coupling between Cx43 and Cx43·GFP cells. To examine the dye-coupling capacity of Cx43 or Cx43·GFP-mediated GJIC, both undifferentiated and differentiated N2a wild-type and transformants were microinjected with 10 mm carboxyfluorescein (CF). Undifferentiated and differentiated N2a-Cx43·GFP cells (Fig.6, A and B,asterisk), N2a-Cx43 cells (Fig. 6, E andF, asterisk) and N2a wild type (Fig. 6,I and J, asterisk) were injected with CF. CF spreads rapidly to adjacent cells in both differentiated and undifferentiated N2a-Cx43·GFP and N2a-Cx43 cells within a minute (Fig. 6, A, B, E, andF). The gap junctional plaques formed by Cx43·GFP were seen as punctate fluorescent spots between adjacent cells (Fig. 6,A and B, arrows). N2a-Cx43 and N2a-Cx43·GFP cells effectively transferred CF to neighboring cells in more than 70% of cases under undifferentiated conditions and in greater than 50% after neuronal differentiation (TableI).Table ISummary of dye injection assayCellsNo. of injections 1-aThe number of injected cells that resulted in CF transfer is expressed as percent.% coupledNo. of orders 1-bThe number of orders indicates the number of cells from the injected cell to the farthest cell containing detectable CF.Undifferentiated wild-type N2a2000Undifferentiated N2a-Cx4365756Undifferentiated N2a-Cx43·GFP70726Differentiated wild-type N2a2500Differentiated N2a-Cx4368553Differentiated N2a-Cx43·GFP725221-a The number of injected cells that resulted in CF transfer is expressed as percent.1-b The number of orders indicates the number of cells from the injected cell to the farthest cell containing detectable CF. Open table in a new tab Furthermore, CF was extensively transferred to at least the 6th order of neighboring undifferentiated Cx43 or Cx43·GFP expressing cells (Fig. 6, A and E), although this was reduced to the 2nd to 3rd order when the same cells were differentiated with retinoic acid (Fig. 6, B and F). As a control, communication-deficient wild-type N2a cells exhibited no dye coupling before or after differentiation (Fig. 6, I andJ). Under the normal culture condition, Cx43 and Cx43·GFP exhibited no growth inhibition in N2a cells (data not shown). In the presence of 20 μm of RA, however, the growth rate of N2a-Cx43 and N2a-Cx43·GFP cells was significantly decreased (Fig. 7) at every time point when compared with wild-type N2a or N2a-GFP cells. There were no significant differences between N2a-Cx43 and N2a-Cx43·GFP transformants or between wild-type N2a and N2a-GFP cells (Fig. 7). By virtue of its intrinsic fluorescence, GFP is readily detected in living cultured cells, and the efficiency of transduction can be rapidly and directly determined. GFP fluorescence provides a visual assessment for rapidly determining the viral titer by flow cytometric analysis, which is consistent with a direct test of viral-mediated transfer of drug resistance to host cells (24Bagley J. Aboody-Guterman K. Breakefield X. Iacomini J. Transplantation. 1998; 65: 1233-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this study, the titer of the AP2 retrovector determined by flow cytometric analysis of GFP fluorescence was about 2.0 × 107 CFU/ml which is similar to other studies (19Galipeau J. Li H. Paquin A. Sicilia F. Karpati G. Nalbantoglu J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2384-2394PubMed Google Scholar). The efficient gene transduction of high titer viral supernatant eliminates the need to generate stable transformed cell lines, which requires months of selection and characterization. Therefore, the AP2 retroviral gene delivery system is well suited for quickly examining expression of exogenous gene(s)in vitro. Many connexins are differentially expressed during neuronal differentiation. During development, neuroblasts are highly coupled, with a loss or reduction of GJIC during terminal differentiation (8Kandler K. Katz L.C. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar,25Cepeda C. Walsh J.P. Peacock W. Buchwald N.A. Levine M.S. Cereb. Cortex. 1993; 3: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A similar decrease in the connexin expression level and GJIC has been reported during in vitro differentiation of two neuronal stem cells, i.e. the P19 mouse embryonal carcinoma cell line (9Bani-Yaghoub M. Underhill T.M. Naus C.C. Dev. Genet. 1999; 24: 69-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the NT2 human teratocarcinoma cell line (6Belliveau D.J. Bechberger J.F. Rogers K.A. Naus C.C. Dev. Genet. 1997; 21: 187-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 7Bani-Yaghoub M. Bechberger J.F. Naus C.C. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In our study, N2a neuroblastoma cells provide an ideal in vitro model to examine the putative role of Cx43-mediated GJIC in neuronal differentiation and growth control because they are of neuronal origin, do not express any known connexins (26Veenstra R.D. Wang H.Z. Westphale E.M. Beyer E.C. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 1277-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and exhibit no detectable gap junctional intercellular coupling. Retroviral gene transduction, Western blot analysis, and immunocytochemistry revealed that N2a cells were able to maintain the expression of Cx43 and Cx43·GFP protein after neuronal differentiation. Cx43 and Cx43·GFP were localized as punctate staining in the cytoplasm and in the membrane between apposed cells. About 90% of the N2a cells overexpressing Cx43 and Cx43·GFP could be differentiated into mature neurons, similar to wild-type cells. These results suggest that Cx43-mediated GJIC does not alter neuronal differentiation of N2a cells. It is possible that in their undifferentiated state, N2a cells have already gone through a possible GJIC-dependent differentiation stage because undifferentiated N2a cells express a certain level of the neuronal marker microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) (27Wang L.J. Colella R. Yorke G. Roisen F.J. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 139: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Gap juctions are known to provide a channel for the intercellular flow of essential electrical signals and small molecules (28Spray D.C. Harris A.L. Bennett M.V. J. Gen. Physiol. 1981; 77: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The current flow through gap junctions is important in the rapid and synchronous activation of excitable tissues (29Spray D.C. Bennett M.V. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 281-303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our studies, all N2a-Cx43 and N2a-Cx43·GFP cells were electrically coupled both before and after neuronal differentiation. However, the cells expressing Cx43·GFP exhibited lower levels of electrical coupling than cells expressing Cx43. Because the carboxyl-terminal region of Cx43 is presumably involved in the regulation of channel gating (1Bruzzone R. White T.W. Paul D.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar), fusion of GFP to this portion of the connexin may interfere with channel function. Using dual whole-cell patch clamp recording, Bukauskas et al. (30Bukauskas F.F. Jordan K. Bukauskiene A. Bennett M.V. Lampe P.D. Laird D.W. Verselis V.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2556-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) have reported some alterations in transjunctional voltage gating for N2A cells transfected with Cx43 or Cx43·GFP but offered no explanation for this difference. We have also noted that N2A cells transfected with Cx43 or Cx43·GFP are less dye coupled after differentiation. This result is consistent with the in vivo studies, which have indicated that electrotonic junctions are wide spread between mammalian neurons in many areas, including neocortex, hippocampus, inferior olive, locus coeruleus, hypothalamus, striatum, and retina (3Dermietzel R. Spray D.C. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 186-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 31Dudek F.E. Andrew R.D. MacVicar B.A. Snow R.W. Taylor C.P. Jasper H. van Gelder N. Basic Mechanisms of Neuronal Hyperexcitability. A. R. Liss, New York1983: 31-73Google Scholar,32Cook J.E. Becker D.L. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1995; 31: 408-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). From our dye-coupling analysis, undifferentiated N2a-Cx43 and N2a-Cx43·GFP cells were found to be coupled on average to 6th order neighbors. After differentiation, however, the coupling decreased on average to 2nd or 3rd order. One possibility is that the differentiated cells bear long processes, and their spatial arrangement differs from undifferentiated cells. Therefore, the dye must pass a similar distance but involves fewer cells. It is also possible that the functional dye-coupling capacity of Cx43 and Cx43·GFP does decrease with neuronal differentiation. Our studies demonstrate for the first time highly coupled differentiated neuronal cells, which provide a suitable model to further investigate the electrotonic junction between mature neurons both in vitro and in vivo. One of the major characteristics of neoplastic cells is their uncontrolled rapid growth. Extensive aspects of tumor growth have been studied, including the implication that loss or lack of gap junctional communication is associated with tumor development (33Loewenstein W.R. Kanno Y. Nature. 1966; 209: 1248-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 34Mesnil M. Yamasaki H. Mol. Carcinogen. 1993; 7: 14-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 35Holder J.W. Elmore E.

The introduction and overexpression of connexin cDNAs in tumor cell lines by transfection has demonstrated a reduced growth rate (38Mesnil M. Krutovskikh V. Piccoli C. Elfgang C. Traub O. Willecke K.

C6 cells transfected with Cx43 cDNA exhibited a decrease in cell growth both in vitro and in vivo (11Naus C.C. Zhu D. Todd S.D. Kidder G.M. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1992; 12: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 12Zhu D. Caveney S. Kidder G.M. Naus C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast to C6-Cx43 cells which grow slower than the parental C6 cells, the N2a-Cx43 and N2a-Cx43·GFP transformants demonstrated no significant decrease in growth rate in vitro when undifferentiated. It appears that the establishment of GJIC in communication-deficient tumor cells does not always lead to growth inhibition. It has been demonstrated that certain connexin genes exert a growth control effect whereas others do not (38Mesnil M. Krutovskikh V. Piccoli C. Elfgang C. Traub O. Willecke K. Yamasaki H. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 629-639PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, gap junctions composed of different connexins demonstrate some molecular transport selectivity (42Elfgang C. Eckert R. Lichtenberg-Frate H. Butterweck A. Traub O. Klein R.A. Hulser D.F. Willecke K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 805-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). In the presence of retinoic acid (20 μM), however, the growth of N2a-Cx43 and N2a-Cx43·GFP was significantly inhibited. This finding suggests that growth inhibition in N2a transformants may be because of the RA treatment and related transjunctional molecule(s) rather than Cx43 itself. This study constitutes the first report of an in vitrogeneration of highly coupled mature neurons obtained using retroviral delivery of connexin constructs. Recent therapeutic applications have employed retroviral delivery of the Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene to brain tumors, with limited success (19Galipeau J. Li H. Paquin A. Sicilia F. Karpati G. Nalbantoglu J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2384-2394PubMed Google Scholar). Given the potential tumor suppressor effects of connexins, as well as the role of GJIC in mediating some aspects of the “bystander effect” associated with Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase expression and combined pro-drug (i.e. ganciclovir) treatment, we propose that retroviral delivery of connexin genes may be therapeutically relevant."

Ferguson S.J. Moir J.W.B. Richardson D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1232: 97-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The reaction is catalyzed by periplasmic dissimilatory nitrite reductases, of which two types are known (2Averill B.A. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2951-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 3Cutruzzolà F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 231-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The first type comprises the copper nitrite reductases. These are trimeric enzymes, each monomer containing one type I copper center that acts as an electron acceptor from donor proteins and a type II copper center as the active site (3Cutruzzolà F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 231-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The other type of dissimilatory nitrite reductase is a heme enzyme, cytochrome cd 1. This enzyme is a dimer, each monomer containing one c-type cytochrome center that accepts electrons from soluble donor proteins (c-type cytochromes and cupredoxins) and oned 1-heme (3Cutruzzolà F.

High resolution x-ray crystallographic structures have been obtained for cytochrome cd 1 from Paracoccus pantotrophus (formerly Thiosphaera pantotropha (10Rainey F.A. Kelly D.P. Stackebrandt E.

Remarkably, upon reduction Met-106 replaces His-17 as axial ligand to the cheme, and Tyr-25 is displaced from the d 1-heme, leaving it penta-coordinate and able to bind substrate. Ligands to both hemes in the oxidized enzyme, His-17 and Tyr-25, are connected by a very short amino acid loop, and there is evidence that they bind the hemes cooperatively (12Koppenhöfer A. Turner K.L. Allen J.W.A. Chapman S.K. Ferguson S.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4243-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 13Allen J.W.A. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Nat. Struct.

Distances are such that electron transfer across the dimer interface cannot occur on a catalytically relevant time scale (11Fülöp V. Moir J.W.B. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J.

There has been considerable speculation about the role of these unprecedented structural changes in the enzyme during the physiological reduction of nitrite (9Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Garman E.F.

The product of this one-electron reaction is nitric oxide, which is known to have a high affinity for heme (particularly ferrous heme). It is generally believed that product NO dissociates from the ferric state of the d 1heme of nitrite reductase (for example see Refs. 2Averill B.A. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2951-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 3Cutruzzolà F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 231-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 4Silvestrini M.C.

A model has been proposed involving displacement of NO from thed 1-heme by Tyr-25 rebinding to the heme during each catalytic cycle (11Fülöp V. Moir J.W.B. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Cell. 1995; 81: 369-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Further, it has been postulated (9Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F.W. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Nature. 1997; 389: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) that axial ligand switching at the c heme between His/Met and His/His coordination may provide a method of gating reduction potentials to prevent formation of an all ferrous enzyme with NO bound. In the case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa cd 1, such a species was formed in the presence of excess reductant and nitrite and showed no further activity (4Silvestrini M.C. Tordi M.G. Musci G. Brunori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11783-11787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we report the first rapid reaction study of the reduction of nitrite by P. pantotrophus cytochromecd 1. We have employed the novel approach of stopped-flow Fourier transform infrared (SF-FTIR)1 spectroscopy (17George S.J. Ashby G.A. Wharton C.W. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 6450-6451Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 18Thorneley R.N.F. George S.J. Triplett E.W. Prokaryotic Nitrogen Fixation: A Model System for the Analysis of a Biological Process. Horizon Scientific Press, Wymondham, UK2000: 81-91Google Scholar), which is a method ideally suited to detecting transient heme-NO intermediates that are difficult to observe by other techniques. We have combined this with visible absorption stopped-flow and freeze-quench EPR methodologies. We show that the following reaction between reduced enzyme and nitrite in the absence of excess reductant, ad 1-heme Fe(II)-NO complex forms rapidly. There follows a redistribution of electrons between the heme centers of the enzyme over 100 ms, resulting in formation of a mixture ofd 1Fe(II)-NO+ andd 1Fe(II)-NO complexes. This state of the enzyme is stable on a time scale of minutes. Implications for the mechanism of the enzyme are discussed. Cytochromecd 1 was purified from the periplasm of P. pantotrophus, grown under denitrifying conditions, according to the method of Moir et al. (19Moir J.W.B. Baratta D. Richardson D.J. Ferguson S.J.

The concentration of cytochrome cd 1was determined using the extinction coefficients 285 mm−1 cm−1 at 406 nm, for the oxidized dimer (21Kobayashi K. Koppenhöfer A. Ferguson S.J. Tagawa S.

All enzyme and substrate solutions used in this study were made in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0, unless otherwise stated. Fully reduced enzyme, in the absence of excess reductant, was prepared in an anaerobic cabinet (<5 ppm O2). Enzyme at approximately double the final desired concentration was reduced with an excess of sodium dithionite or with electrochemically reduced methyl viologen. The mixture was passed down a desalting column containing P6-DG resin (Bio-Rad). Dithionite reduced eluent was tested for the absence of excess reductant using papers pre-soaked in methyl viologen, which turn blue on contact with dithionite. When viologen was used as reductant, the dark green reduced enzyme was observed to clearly separate from the blue reducing agent on the desalting column. Enzyme thus prepared was immediately transferred to a stopped-flow machine or gas tight vessel. The UV-visible absorption spectrum of the reduced enzyme was identical using each reductant, and the visible region of the spectrum was as reported by Koppenhöfer et al.(20Koppenhöfer A. Little R.H. Lowe D.J. Ferguson S.J. Watmough N.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4028-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), who used ascorbate and hexaamineruthenium(III) chloride to reduce the enzyme. SF-FTIR experiments were performed using an adapted Bruker IFS 66/S spectrometer (Bruker UK Ltd., Coventry, UK) fitted with a liquid nitrogen cooled mercury cadmium telluride detector. The stopped-flow circuit and cell are home-built and essentially those described by Wharton and co-workers (23White A.J. Drabble K. Wharton C.W. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The drive system and stopped-flow cell are entirely housed within an anaerobic dry glove box (<2 ppm O2) (Belle Technology, Portesham, Dorset, UK) as detailed elsewhere (18Thorneley R.N.F. George S.J. Triplett E.W. Prokaryotic Nitrogen Fixation: A Model System for the Analysis of a Biological Process. Horizon Scientific Press, Wymondham, UK2000: 81-91Google Scholar). The cell had pathlength of approximately 50 μm. For these experiments the instrument collected data across a range of 200 cm−1. Typically, for an infrared resolution of 4 cm−1, the time resolution was 25 ms per spectrum, and the dead time before detection was 18 ms. Exact sample conditions are given in the figure legends. Stopped-flow kinetic experiments were performed using a Hi-Tech SF-61 DX2 double mixing stopped-flow spectrometer interfaced with a CU-61 control unit (Hi-Tech Scientific). The drive syringes and optical cell were entirely housed in an anaerobic glove box (Faircrest Ltd) (<10 ppm O2). Both the glove box atmosphere and drive system were thermostatted to give a sample temperature of 25 °C. The optical flow cell had a pathlength of 10 mm. The dead time before detection was ∼2 ms. This work used the instrument in both single wavelength photomultiplier or diode array detection modes. In diode array mode the maximum time resolution was 2.25 ms/spectrum. Data were analyzed using the KinetAsyst 2.2 software package (Hi-Tech Scientific). EPR spectra were recorded on a X-band Bruker 200D spectrometer (Bruker UK Ltd., Coventry, UK) interfaced to an ESP 1600 computer and fitted with an Oxford Instruments ER900 liquid helium cooled flow cryostat (Oxford Instruments Ltd., Abingdon, UK). Samples were prepared by mixing enzyme and substrate and freezing in liquid isopentane (−140 °C) on a millisecond time scale, using the freeze quench apparatus previously described (24Bray R.C. Lowe D.J. Capeillère-Blandin C. Fielden E.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1973; 1: 1067-1072Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Instrument settings are given in the figure legends. The aim of this study of the kinetics of reduction of nitrite by cytochrome cd 1 was to characterize the formation of the nitric oxide product as well as other intermediates of the catalytic cycle and possibly to detect a product release step. The experiment chosen was to mix reduced cytochromecd 1 with substrate, in the absence of excess reductant and under strictly anaerobic conditions. Fully reduced enzyme was mixed in equal volume with a buffered solution of Na14NO2 in the SF-FTIR apparatus. Solutions were prepared using D2O to provide a wide infrared window in the predicted region of interest. Within the first second a single band could be detected at 1913 cm−1 (Fig.1). No other feature was observed at any time between 2200 and 1750 cm−1. The band was sharp, with a half-height width of 7.7 cm−1. Use of isotopically substituted 15N nitrite caused this band to shift some 37 cm−1 to 1876 cm−1 (Fig. 1, spectrum b). This shift is consistent with the 34.3 cm−1expected for NO and thus conclusively demonstrates that this peak arises from bound NO. The energy of this peak is consistent with the ν(NO) fundamental stretching mode of NO bound to ferric heme (25Ozawa S. Sakamoto E. Ichikawa T. Watanabe Y. Morishima I. Inorg. Chem. 1995; 34: 6362-6370Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar,26Ding X.D. Weichsel A. Anderson J.F. Shokhireva T.Kh. Balfour C. Pierik A.J. Averill B.A. Montfort W.R. Walker F.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 128-138Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar). (The observed complex is in fact more accurately described as a heme-Fe(II)-NO+ species. 2In this paper we used1 Fe(II)-NO+ to describe the ferricd, heme-NO2 complex we observe by SF-FTIR rather than the isoelectronic species d1 Fe(III)-NO. In general, when NO binds to a metal in a high oxidation state, the NO ligand can donate charge to the metal, resulting in a complex with appreciable NO+ character. This typically results in a linear metal-N-O geometry and an elevated v(NO) stretching frequency, implying that the NO bond order has increased. Thev(NO) of 1913 cm−1 we observe is higher than that of free NO (1876 cm−1) and substantially higher than those of ferrous heme-NO complexes (1690–1590 cm−1 (26Ding X.D. Weichsel A. Anderson J.F.

This suggests that the notation d1 Fe(II)-NO+we use here is more correct than d1 Fe(III)-NO when describing the ferric d1 heme-NO complex.) Repeating the experiment using H2O buffers did not cause any significant shift in this band, suggesting that any hydrogen bonding interactions to the bound NO must arise from nonexchangeable protons. Wang and Averill (27Wang Y.N. Averill B.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 3972-3973Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar) reported similar spectra when NO was mixed with oxidized cytochrome cd 1 from Pseudomonas stutzeri. They observed peaks at 1910 cm−1(14NO) and 1874 cm−1 (15NO), with half-height widths of 7 cm−1. In contrast to their experiment, the species we detected was unequivocally the product of enzymatic reduction of substrate nitrite. We could not produce a species where NO bound to oxidized, “as isolated” P. pantotrophus cd 1 despite extensive attempts to do so. Presumably the Tyr-25 ligand to the d 1 heme cannot be displaced under such conditions. The energy of the peak we observed by infrared is also in close agreement with those recorded for model compounds of d 1 heme, with ferric iron coordinated by NO and N-methylimidazole (25Ozawa S. Sakamoto E. Ichikawa T. Watanabe Y. Morishima I. Inorg. Chem. 1995; 34: 6362-6370Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We were able to measure the rate of formation of the peak observed by SF-FTIR; the experiment was conducted as above, in H2O buffer at pH 7.0, using Na14NO2 as substrate. Spectra were recorded approximately every 25 ms for 5 s. The intensity of the base-line corrected peak observed at 1913 cm−1 is shown in Fig. 2, as a function of time (longer time points are taken from the experiment described in Fig. 1; see figure legends). The superimposed curve in Fig. 2 is a calculated single exponential with a rate constant of 38 s−1. It is apparent that the Fe(II)-NO+species we detect substantially formed within 100 ms; the peak was still intense 15 min after reaction.Figure 5EPR spectrum of reduced P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd 1freeze-quenched 5 ms after mixing with nitrite in the absence of excess reductant.

It is not immediately obvious whether this bound nitric oxide species is the first or the second to be formed following mixing of the enzyme with nitrite. It should be recalled that in the fully reduced enzyme each polypeptide bears two electrons, one on each heme. Thus in principle, the first turnover at the d 1 heme might have been so fast as to escape detection in the experiment shown in Fig. 2 a. Insight into this issue was sought using visible absorption stopped-flow spectrophotometry, under conditions very similar to those used for the FTIR measurements. Using visible spectrophotometry, three phases of reaction were apparent following mixing of reduced enzyme with nitrite. The starting material had an identical spectrum to that previously reported (20Koppenhöfer A. Little R.H. Lowe D.J. Ferguson S.J. Watmough N.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4028-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) for reduced P. pantotrophus cytochromecd 1 (Fig.3 a). After 4 ms both thed 1 heme and c heme contributions had changed (Fig. 3 b). In particular, thed 1 heme peak and shoulder at 652 nm had been replaced by a broader less intense feature centered at about 642 nm, whereas the d 1 Söret region was bleached. Figs. 3 b and 4 ashow that 4 ms after reaction, the c-type cytochrome center was largely oxidized. The rate constant for this oxidation is estimated to be at least 500 s−1. Simulation shows that thec-type center was oxidized by 87% during this phase, which largely occurred within the dead time of the stopped-flow apparatus. The most straightforward interpretation of these spectral changes is that after 4 ms a reduced form of nitrite, presumably NO, was coordinated to the d 1heme. The second phase of the reaction was apparent approximately 5 ms after mixing enzyme with substrate, as the c heme started to become re-reduced (Fig. 4 a). This was evident from the doublet around 550 nm in the α-band region of the spectrum, which is characteristic of reduced c heme in cytochromescd 1 (15Zumft W.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 533-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2916) Google Scholar). By 100 ms a stable state was reached (Fig. 3 c), in which 45% of the c-type center (in the bulk sample) was ferrous. Re-reduction of the c-type center correlated with the appearance a new visible absorption band at 632 nm, which we assign to the d 1 heme center. This developed with a concomitant reduction in intensity at 670 nm. Example time courses illustrating the first two phases (from 2 to 250 ms after reaction) are presented in Fig. 4. These were recorded at 629 nm (d 1-heme) and from the c heme α-band doublet around 550 nm. Indicated are the starting intensities from the unreacted ferrous enzyme (●). Note that the c heme time course is a difference time course designed to eliminate background contributions from the d 1-heme (see the figure legend). Between 10 and 250 ms both curves can be fitted to the same single exponential process with a monophasic rate constant of 38 s−1 (broken lines in Fig. 4). This rate curve also correlates well with the appearance of thed 1Fe(II)-NO+ species observed by SF-FTIR (Fig. 2). These kinetic data strongly imply that the same (or coupled) processes were being observed by visible spectroscopy at both the c and d 1 hemes and by SF-FTIR. Varying the concentration of nitrite in the reaction mixture between 200 and 5 mm for 15 μm enzyme did not significantly change these time courses. The third phase of the reaction was slow, taking many hours to complete in the dark. It was also photosensitive. It was, for example, photocatalyzed by the high light intensity incident on the sample in the diode array apparatus, which caused the reaction to complete within a few minutes. 3Although the spectra in Fig. 3 are by necessity from a diode array stopped-flow experiment, the time courses in Fig. 4were recorded using a single wavelength instrument. We found that the substantially lower light intensity incident on the sample in single wavelength measurements avoided any photochemical effects. This phase involved the loss of the new band at 632 nm and essentially complete oxidation of thec heme. The spectrum of the final product of the reaction (Fig. 3 d) was not that of the “ferric enzyme” as isolated. The high spin d 1 heme α-band at 702 nm was absent; this feature is characteristic of Tyr-25 ligation to the heme (28Cheesman M.R. Ferguson S.J. Moir J.W.B. Richardson D.J. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16267-16276Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, we postulate that the final reaction product was an all ferric form of the enzyme with nitrite bound to thed 1 heme. The position of the Söret band was similar to that in intermediates observed in recent studies that were proposed to have His/Met coordinated ferric c heme (13Allen J.W.A. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar,20Koppenhöfer A. Little R.H. Lowe D.J. Ferguson S.J. Watmough N.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4028-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). When near stoichiometric heme-d 1:nitrite ratios were used, the reaction did not show this third phase; this strongly suggests that it arises from further turnover by the enzyme. We have also studied the reaction of stoichiometrically reducedcd 1 with nitrite using EPR spectroscopy. As expected, all-ferrous nitrite reductase did not exhibit any EPR signal (data not shown); in general it is ferric heme that exhibits intense EPR signals, because it is a non-integer spin paramagnet. The X-band EPR spectrum of a sample of reduced nitrite reductase freeze-quenched 4 ms after the addition of excess nitrite showed three prominent features (Fig. 5). It was dominated by a sharp band at g = 2.01, which can be assigned to a ferrous heme-NO species (29Johnson M.K. Thomson A.J. Walsh T.A. Barber D. Greenwood C. Biochem. J. 1980; 189: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the case of heme-NO complexes it is the ferrous heme that is EPR active, with the ferric heme EPR silent, as the unpaired electron on NO delocalizes onto the metal. The other significant signals in the spectrum were observed at g= 2.93 and 2.32. By analogy with the P. pantotrophuscytochrome cd 1-oxygen and hydroxylamine complexes, we assign these to oxidized heme-c with His-Met coordination (13Allen J.W.A. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Koppenhöfer A. Little R.H. Lowe D.J. Ferguson S.J. Watmough N.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4028-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These EPR signals were also apparent in samples frozen at longer times. However their intensities fell rapidly, having approximately halved by 110 ms. Fig. 6 is a plot of the intensities of the ferrous heme-NO and heme-c EPR signals superimposed on a portion of the optical stopped-flow time courses recorded for the 632 and 550 nm absorption features, respectively. There is a clear correspondence between the growth of the 632 nm band and the decay of the ferrous heme-NO EPR signal. Similarly, the intensity of the ferric heme-c EPR band can be plotted over the changes in the 550 nm doublet. In samples frozen in liquid nitrogen after reacting for longer times (between 2 and 11 min), the intensity of the ferrous heme-NO band attenuated further, whereas the ferric heme-c spectrum was seen to increase slowly (data not shown), correlating with the slow third phase of the reaction observed by absorption spectroscopy. We note that the bis-His form of ferric heme-c in native enzyme exhibits an EPR signal withg = 3.05 (28Cheesman M.R. Ferguson S.J. Moir J.W.B. Richardson D.J. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16267-16276Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). At no time did we see any indication that the heme-c was reverting to bis-His coordination. 4In"

To gain insight into this effect, we examined the microenvironments of the eight lysines in the 22-kDa fragment of apoE3 (residues 1–191) in the lipid-free and lipid-associated states. As shown by 1H,13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence nuclear magnetic resonance, lysine resonances in the lipid-free fragment were poorly resolved over a wide pH range, whereas in apoE3·dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) discs, the lysine microenvironments and protein conformation were significantly altered. Sequence-specific assignments of the lysine resonances in the spectrum of the lipidated 22-kDa fragment were made. In the lipid-free protein, six lysines could be resolved, and all had pK avalues above 10. In apoE3·DMPC complexes, however, all eight lysines were resolved, and the pK a values were 9.2–11.1. Lys-143 and Lys-146, both in the receptor binding region in helix 4, had unusually low pK a values of 9.5 and 9.2, respectively, likely as a result of local increases in positive electrostatic potential with lipid association. Shift reagent experiments with potassium ferricyanide showed that Lys-143 and Lys-146 were much more accessible to the ferricyanide anion in the apoE3·DMPC complex than in the lipid-free state. The angle of the nonpolar face of helix 4 is smaller than the angles of helices 1, 2, and 3, suggesting that helix 4 cannot penetrate as deeply into the DMPC acyl chains at the edge of the complex and that its polar face protrudes from the edge of the disc. This increased exposure and the greater positive electrostatic potential created by interaction with DMPC may explain why lipid association is required for high affinity binding of apoE to the low density lipoprotein receptor.

The C-terminal domain contains the major lipid binding region. The N-terminal domain exists in the lipid-free state as a four-helix bundle of amphipathic α-helices and contains the LDLR binding region (amino acids 136–150 in helix 4), which coincides with a heparin binding site (2Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein. Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of apoE to the LDLR is thought to involve ionic interaction between acidic residues in the ligand binding domain of the LDLR and a cluster of basic residues in the receptor binding region of apoE. Replacing these basic residues with neutral residues reduces receptor binding affinity (12Zaiou M. Arnold K.S. Newhouse Y.M. Innerarity T.L. Weisgraber K.H. Segall M.L. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. J.

High resolution x-ray crystallography of the 22-kDa N-terminal thrombolytic fragment of apoE in the lipid-free state has provided detailed information about molecular features of the α-helices (see Fig. 1).

Purif. 1999; 16: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out with pfu DNA polymerase. Plasmid DNA was prepared with a Qiagen plasmid maxi kit, and DNA gel extractions were done with a Qiagen QIAEX II gel extraction kit. The mutation, sequence, and cDNA orientation were confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis and double-stranded DNA sequencing. The expression host, E. coli BL21 (DE3), is deficient in some proteases and has the T7 RNA polymerase gene under the control of thelacUV5 promoter. Upon induction with isopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, the lacrepressor is inactivated, leading to T7 RNA polymerase synthesis and to induction of the target gene in the plasmid. To express protein (12Zaiou M. Arnold K.S. Newhouse Y.M. Innerarity T.L. Weisgraber K.H. Segall M.L. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1087-1095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a glycerol stock of the E. coli was streaked on a Luria-Bertani medium plate containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and incubated at 37 °C overnight. A single colony from the plate was cultured at 37 °C in a G24 environmental incubator shaker (New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ) to an absorbance (660 nm) of 0.4–0.6. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation (3,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C), and the pellet was used to inoculate 6 liters of Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. When the absorbance (660 nm) reached 0.4–0.6, 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside was added, and the bacteria were cultured for 2 h. This culture was centrifuged at 3,500 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 90 ml of ice-cold buffer (150 mmNaCl, 20 mm Na2HPO4, 25 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1% aprotinin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sonicated on ice to lyse the bacteria (6–10 min, 50% pulse cycle). The bacterial debris was removed by centrifugation (40,000 × g, 20 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant containing the apoE was dialyzed overnight against 2.5 mm Tris, 2.0 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, at 4 °C. DMPC (650 mg) was dispersed in 45 ml of ice-cold 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, sonicated on ice (cycles of 5.0 min on, 2.0 min off) until translucent. The DMPC small unilamellar vesicle preparation was then mixed with the supernatant containing the expressed apoE at a DMPC/protein ratio of 3.75/1 (w/w). KBr was added to the DMPC/protein mixture to increase the density to 1.21 g/ml, and the solution was centrifuged at 302,000 × g for 48–72 h at 15 °C. The top lipid layer was removed from the tubes, dialyzed against 2.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, at 4 °C overnight and lyophilized. This preparation of apoE·DMPC complexes was delipidated, and the apoE pellet was dissolved in 6 m guanidine HCl, pH 7.2, containing 1% β-mercaptoethanol. The apoE was isolated by gel filtration chromatography on a Sephacryl S-300 column. Analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the apoE was ≥ 95% pure. If necessary, the apoE was purified further by ion exchange or heparin-Sepharose chromatography. The 22-kDa fragment of apoE3 was combined with DMPC and isolated by gel filtration chromatography as follows. DMPC (40 mg) was dried from chloroform/methanol solution under nitrogen to a thin film on the walls of a 15-ml glass conical centrifuge tube (Corex). The residue in the tube was redissolved in 1–2 ml of benzene, shell frozen with dry ice, and lyophilized. The lipid was incubated with 5 ml of buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm disodium EDTA, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6) for at least 30 min at room temperature and then sonicated for 45 min at 24 °C in a Branson 350 sonicator fitted with a tapered tip (5 min on, 2 min off). The mixture was then centrifuged at low speed to remove titanium released from the sonicator tip. The slightly translucent solution of DMPC vesicles was kept at room temperature. A 10-mg aliquot of the 22-kDa fragment was dissolved in 0.1 m NH4HCO3, pH 8.1, to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml and pipetted into a plastic tube. Intermolecular disulfide bonds were reduced by adding β-mercaptoethanol (0.5 μl/100 μg of protein) and incubating the mixture for 30 min at room temperature. DMPC vesicles were added, and the mixture was recycled three times through the gel-liquid crystal transition temperature of DMPC (23.5 °C) by warming to ∼30 °C and cooling to ∼15 °C. The apoE3 22-kDa·DMPC complexes were separated from uncomplexed protein and lipid by gel filtration chromatography. The complex (10 mg of apoE3 22-kDa in a 5-ml volume) was applied to a calibrated Superdex 200 Prepgrade column with a fast protein liquid chromatography system. Fractions (1 ml each) were collected, and the absorbance of each fraction was monitored at 280 nm to locate the protein peak and estimate the particle diameter. Fractions containing the complexes were pooled and dialyzed against saline/EDTA before characterization and reductive methylation. The13C label was introduced into the DMPC-associated 22-kDa fragment by reductive methylation of lysines with [13C]formaldehyde as described elsewhere (18Lund-Katz S. Ibdah J.A. Letizia J.Y.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23008-23015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reducing agent (sodium cyanoborohydride) was maintained at 5–10-fold molar excess over the lysines, whereas the molar ratio of formaldehyde to lysine was kept at 10/1. This allowed maximal labeling of the lysines, which was reproducible to ± 3%. The level of incorporation of label was monitored by doping the [13C]formaldehyde with [14C]formaldehyde and determining the 14C specific activity of the mixture. The degree of labeling estimated from 13C incorporation (NMR) agreed closely with the value from 14C incorporation determined by liquid scintillation counting. This labeling procedure did not cause apoprotein degradation, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. No labeling of lipid occurred because no 14C radioactivity could be extracted into chloroform/methanol. 1H,13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) two-dimensional NMR spectra of the 13C-labeled apoE3 22-kDa·DMPC complexes were obtained with a Bruker DMX400 wide bore spectrometer equipped with a SGI 02 computer and a 5-mm inverse broad band probe. The spectra were correlated by using double INEPT transfer (21Bodenhausen G. Ruben D.J. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1980; 69: 185-189Crossref Scopus (2434) Google Scholar) and gradient pulses for coherence selection. The temperature for the two-dimensional NMR spectra was set at 310 K. The two-dimensional1H,13C HSQC spectra were recorded with carbon decoupling during acquisition. The time proportional phase increment method (22Marion D. Wyllie A.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar) was used to obtain phase-sensitive spectra. Chemical shifts and line widths for lipid-protein complexes were measured as described elsewhere (18Lund-Katz S. Ibdah J.A. Letizia J.Y. Thomas M.T. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13831-13838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1130-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 24Lund-Katz S.

Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 472-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The pseudocontact shifts observed when K3FeCN6 was added to the aqueous phase were used to explore the exposure of (13CH3)2 lysines to the aqueous medium (18Lund-Katz S. Ibdah J.A. Letizia J.Y. Thomas M.T. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13831-13838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chemical shifts ofε(13CH3)2 lysine andα(13CH3)2-terminal amino residues of apoE3 22-kDa·DMPC complexes were determined as a function of pH. Reductively methylated apoE3 22-kDa·DMPC complexes (sample volume was typically 2.0 ml, 2.0 mg of apoE3 22-kDa/ml) were introduced into a 5-mm NMR tube. The pH of the solution was adjusted before each experiment by adding micromolar amounts of concentrated NaOH or HCl. Two samples were used, one for titration from pH 10.0 to 12.5 and the other for titration from pH 5.5 to 10.0. At each pH, and before each two-dimensional NMR experiment, a one-dimensional13C spectrum was obtained with proton composite pulse decoupling. The pK a values of the13C-labeled dimethyl lysines were obtained by nonlinear regression fitting of the chemical shifts at different pH values to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with the GraphPad Prism computer program (GraphPad Software). The sigmoidal equation is Y = (U + W × 10(X− Xc))/(10(X− Xc) + 1) where Y is the chemical shift, U is the lower limit of the shift, W is the upper limit, X is pH, and Xc is pK a. Protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry procedure (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipid content was monitored by phosphorus analysis (27Sokoloff L. Rothblat G.H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1974; 146: 1166-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Negative staining electron microscopy (28Forte T.M. Nordhausen R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 442-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) was used to measure the size of the apoE3 22-kDa·DMPC discs.14C radioactivity was assessed by standard liquid scintillation procedures. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8–25% gradient) in either the presence or absence of SDS was performed using a Pharmacia Phast Electrophoresis System to monitor the purity of the apoE3 22-kDa fragment or determine the size of DMPC discs. Circular dichroism spectra were obtained on a Jasco J600 spectropolarimeter equipped with a temperature-controlling device and interfaced with a computer. The α-helical content of each apoE3 22-kDa·DMPC preparation was derived from the molar ellipticity at 222 nm by established procedures (20Lund-Katz S. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23008-23015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25830-25839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apoE3 22-kDa fragment (residues 1–191) rather than the full-length apoE3 was employed to evaluate the microenvironments of the lysines because there are only 8 lysines in the fragment compared with 12 in the intact molecule, simplifying the resolution and assignment of the resonances in the NMR spectrum. It is important to note that the apoE3 22-kDa fragment adopts a receptor-active conformation when complexed with DMPC and binds to the LDLR with an affinity similar to that of full-length apoE3 (30Innerarity T.L. Friedlander E.J. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12341-12347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structural motif adopted by the apoE3 22-kDa fragment in the lipid-free state is the four-helix bundle (31Dong L.M. Parkin S. Trakhanov S.D. Rupp B. Simmons T. Arnold K.S. Newhouse Y.M. Innerarity T.L. Weisgraber K.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and it has been demonstrated that the bundle undergoes a conformational change in which it opens, exposing the hydrophobic faces of the helices when binding to DMPC (14Lu B. Morrow J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20775-20781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of the lipid-free apoE3–22-kDa molecule (Fig.1) shows that the receptor binding region in helix 4 contains a cluster of basic amino acids including Lys-143 and Lys-146 located on the polar face. To gain insight into the conformational change that gives rise to high affinity binding of apoE to the LDLR, we used multidimensional1H,13C HSQC NMR to examine individual lysines in the 22-kDa fragment of apoE3 in the lipid-free state and in a complex with DMPC, as applied by Zhang et al. (32Zhang M. Huque E. Vogel H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5099-5105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to calmodulin. In our previous 13C NMR studies of apoE (20Lund-Katz S. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23008-23015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and amphipathic α-helical peptides (33Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Mishra V.K. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9219-9226Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), methylation had no effect on lipid binding affinity (20Lund-Katz S. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23008-23015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or on the pK a values of the lysines (15Jentoft N. Dearborn D.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Dimethylation of lysines in apoE does decrease receptor binding activity (34Weisgraber K.H. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 9053-9062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) because some of the lysines are directly involved in the receptor binding domain. However, this decrease does not result from a structural perturbation of apoE induced by the dimethylation or a significant change in the pK avalues of the lysines. Rather, it probably reflects the ∼10% reduction in ion pair energy caused by lysine dimethylation (35Mavri J. Vogel H.J. Proteins. 1994; 18: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the reduced hydrogen bonding capability of dimethyl lysine, or both. The spectrum of the 22-kDa fragment of apoE3 in the lipid-free state showed a well resolved N-terminal α-amino group with a13C chemical shift of 41.0 ppm at pH 10.0 (Fig.2). Theε(13CH3)2 resonances from the eight lysines were relatively poorly resolved. Six resonances with 13C chemical shifts of 43.1–43.9 ppm and1H chemical shifts of 2.1–2.5 ppm were detected. The existence of multiple (13CH3)2lysine resonances reflects ordered structures because only a single resonance is obtained when apoE is present in a disordered state in 8m urea solution (20Lund-Katz S. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23008-23015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The spectrum of the apoE3·DMPC complex showed striking differences in the lysine resonances, indicating significant changes in the lysine microenvironments and in protein conformation (Fig. 2). The 13C resonances from the DMPC molecules in the lipid-protein complex have been described before (20Lund-Katz S. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23008-23015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apoE3 22-kDa·DMPC discs were homogeneous in size, with a hydrodynamic diameter of ∼16 nm as judged by their elution from a calibrated Superdex 200 gel filtration column. Volumetric calculations indicated that each disc contained about 750 DMPC molecules and seven apoE3 22-kDa molecules. Sequence-specific assignments of the eight lysine resonances in the spectrum of the lipidated 22-kDa fragment of apoE3 were made by producing a series of recombinant variants in which each lysine was individually mutated to glutamine. To ensure that these mutations did not affect the properties of the apoE3 22-kDa fragment, we compared the properties of the mutants and the wild-type molecule. As shown by circular dichroism, the α-helical content of each mutant protein in the lipid-free state was ∼55 ± 5%, which is similar to that of the wild-type fragment (36DePauw M. Vanloo B. Weisgraber K.H. Rosseneu M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10953-10960Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 37Raussens V. Fisher C.A. Goormaghtigh E. Ryan R.O. Ruysschaert J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25825-25830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). When the mutants were complexed with DMPC, their α-helical content increased by 10–15%, in good agreement with the increase exhibited by the wild-type protein. Furthermore, the mutations did not affect the lipid binding capacity of the protein, and the mutants interacted with DMPC to form complexes identical in size and lipid-to-protein ratio to those formed with the wild-type fragment. Fig. 3 demonstrates how the resonance from Lys-143 was assigned. Comparison of the two spectra reveals that the resonance at 13C-δ = 43.30 ppm and1H-δ = 2.26 ppm in the spectrum of the wild-type protein is missing in the spectrum o"

To address this, we established mammalian cell lines expressing Neurospora crassa UV damage endonuclease (UVDE), which introduces a SSB with a 3′-OH immediately 5′ to UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers or 6–4 photoproducts and initiates an alternative excision repair process. Xeroderma pigmentosum group A cells expressing UVDE show UV resistance of almost the wild-type level. In these cells SSBs are produced upon UV irradiation and then efficiently repaired. The repair patch size is about seven nucleotides, and repair synthesis is decreased to 30% by aphidicolin, suggesting the involvement of a DNA polymerase δ/ε-dependent long-patch repair. Immediately after UV irradiation, cellular proteins are poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated. The UV resistance of the cells is decreased in the presence of 3-aminobenzamide, an inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Expression of UVDE in XRCC1-defective EM9, a Chinese hamster ovary cell line, greatly sensitizes the host cells to UV, and addition of 3-aminobenzamide results in almost no further sensitization of the cells to UV. Thus, we show that XRCC1 and PARP are involved in the same pathway for the repair of SSBs.

SSBs cause double-strand breaks when replication forks encounter SSBs and, thus, result in chromosomal rearrangements and instability (1Paulovich A.G. Toczyski D.P. Hartwell L.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 315-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Despite the potentially harmful effects of SSBs, however, little is known about the details of the repair mechanisms and cellular responses to SSBs in mammalian cells. This may be due to the experimental difficulty to produce SSBs alone. Genotoxic agents that produce SSBs (ionizing radiation, oxidizing agents, and alkylating agents) generate a variety of DNA lesions (2Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). For instance, ionizing radiation and bleomycin produce not only SSBs but also base lesions and double-strand breaks (2Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar, 3Povirk L.F. Wubker W. Kohnleim W. Hutchinson F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 3580-4573Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar). One of the immediate responses to SSBs in mammalian cells is thought to be the activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). PARP binds to SSBs and is activated (4Chatterjee S. Berger N.A. Nickoloff J.A. Hoekstra M.F. DNA Damage and Repair. 2. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 487-515Google Scholar). Although PARP has been considered to be involved in the repair of SSBs, especially in replicating cells (4Chatterjee S. Berger N.A. Nickoloff J.A. Hoekstra M.F. DNA Damage and Repair. 2. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 487-515Google Scholar), its precise role is still not well understood. Another player in the response to SSBs may be XRCC1, which binds to DNA ligase III and DNA polymerase β (5Kubota Y. Nash R.A. Klungland A. Schär P. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6662-6670Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), and is thought to be involved in a base excision repair (BER) pathway. Recently it was reported that XRCC1 is also involved in an S-phase-specific repair pathway of SSBs (6Taylor R.M. Moore D.J. Whitehouse J. Johnson P. Caldecott K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Since XRCC1 binds to PARP (7Masson M. Niedergang C. Schreiber V. Muller S. de Murcia J.M. de Murcia G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar) and some phenotypic characteristics of XRCC1-deficient cells are similar to those of PARP-deficient cells (8Thompson L.H. West M.G. Mutat. Res. 2000; 459: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), both proteins may be involved in the S phase-specific mode of SSB repair. However, the functional relationship between PARP and XRCC1 is unknown and remains to be elucidated. In addition to nucleotide excision repair (NER) for UV-induced DNA damage, the filamentous fungus, Neurospora crassa, and the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, possess an alternative excision repair mechanism, which is initiated by an endonuclease called UV damage endonuclease (UVDE) and is referred to as UVDE-initiated excision repair (9Takao M.

UVDE introduces a SSB immediately 5′ to UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6–4 photoproducts, leaving 3′-hydroxyl and 5′-phosphoryl groups at the site of cleavage (9Takao M. Yonemasu R. Yamamoto K. Yasui A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1267-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 10Bowman K.K. Sidik K. Smith C.A. Taylor J.-S. Doetsch P.W. Freyer G.A.

Until now UVDE has been found only in some eukaryotic microorganisms and in some bacteria including Bacilus subtilis (9Takao M. Yonemasu R. Yamamoto K. Yasui A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1267-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and Dienococcus radiodurans (15White O. Eisen J.A. Heidelberg J.F. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H.

To understand the cellular responses and repair of SSBs in mammalian cells, we have made use of UVDE. We introduced the N. crassaUVDE gene into a human and a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines and analyzed the responses of the transfected cells to UV. Using these unique systems, we found the following. 1) Judging from the UV resistance of xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XPA) cell line expressing UVDE, UVDE-initiated alternative excision repair in human cells works almost as efficiently as NER. 2) The UVDE-initiated repair is mediated mainly by aphidicolin-sensitive DNA polymerase(s), and the repair patch size is about seven nucleotides. 3) XRCC1 and PARP cooperate and contribute to cell survival after SSBs are produced. A human cell line derived from an XPA patient, XP12ROSV, was obtained from Dr. K. Tanaka (Osaka University) and used as the host cell for complementation of UV sensitivity by the introduced UVDE gene. The CHO cell line EM9 was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. Plasmid pCY4B, a derivative of the one described by Niwa et al. (16Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene. 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4562) Google Scholar), contains a chicken β-actin promoter (obtained from Dr J. Miyazaki, Osaka University). This plasmid was used for expression of the N. crassa UVDE gene in XPA cells and EM9 cells. pCY4B-UVDE was made by inserting the EcoRI fragment carrying the UVDE-coding region into the EcoRI site of pCY4B. XP12ROSV cells and EM9 cells were transfected with pCY4B-UVDE together with a plasmid harboring a G418 resistance marker by Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfectants were selected in medium containing 200 μg/ml (in the case of XPA cells) or 400 μg/ml (in the case of EM9 cells) of G418. Stable transfectants of XP12ROSV and EM9 expressing UVDE were obtained and named XPA[UVDE] and EM9[UVDE], respectively. The transfectant of XP12ROSV expressing wild-type XPA cDNA (17Miyamoto I. Miura N. Niwa H. Miyazaki J. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12182-12187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. K. Tanaka. This cell line is referred to as XPA[cXPA] in this paper. A XP12ROSV cell line transfected with the vector pCY4B plasmid was designated as XPA[Vector]. An EM9 clone transfected with the vector was designated as EM9[Vector]. Human cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Nissui) containing 10% fetal calf serum, whereas CHO cells were grown in 10% fetal calf serum-supplemented Dulbecco's modified medium (Nissui). Whole cell extracts were prepared from cultured cells by homogenizing cell pellets in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 m KCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease inhibitors (protease inhibitor mixture tablets, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After centrifugation of the homogenate at 100,000 × g, supernatants were recovered and used for immunoblot analysis as well as for the incision assay described below. Western analysis was done by standard methods using whole cell extracts (20 μg of protein of each), fluorotrans membrane (PALL Gelman Laboratory), and an antibody raised against N. crassa UVDE (18Kanno S. Iwai S. Takao M. Yasui A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3096-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (1:500 dilution). Immune complexes were detected by using an ECL plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For detection of poly(ADP-ribose) (pADPr), cells were harvested from 35-mm culture dishes just before reaching confluence. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and irradiated with 2.5, 7.5, and 20 J/m2 UV. After UV irradiation, cells were incubated for various periods of time at room temperature. After incubation, cell extracts were prepared by adding 400 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer (1% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.5), and 0.05% bromphenol blue) to each dish. In another experiment, cells were preincubated in medium containing 2 mm 3-aminobenzamide (3AB, Sigma) for 2 h before UV irradiation. The cells were then washed with PBS containing 2 mm 3AB, irradiated with UV, incubated, and lysed as above. The extracts thus obtained were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm (18,000 × g) for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were recovered after centrifugation, resolved by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to the fluorotrans membrane. To detect pADPr bound to proteins, the membrane was probed with monoclonal antibodies to pADPr (1:500 dilution; Trevigen, Inc.) and peroxidase-labeled goat antibodies to mouse IgG (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc.). We used actin as the control (monoclonal antibody to actin, clone C4, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Nicking activity of UVDE was measured as described (18Kanno S. Iwai S. Takao M. Yasui A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3096-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The whole cell extracts (40 μg of protein of each), and the synthetic oligonucleotides containing CPD were used. 5 × 103 exponentially growing XPA cells were plated per 100-mm culture dish (9.3 × 102 cells per 60-mm dish for CHO cells) and incubated in culture medium. 9 h after plating, cells were washed with Hanks' solution (Nissui) and irradiated with UV at various doses. The cells were then cultured for 12 days (8 days for CHO cells) in either the regular medium or medium containing 2 mm 3AB. Cells grown on glass microscope slides in culture dishes were irradiated with 7.5 J/m2 and 15 J/m2 UV and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in medium supplemented with 10 μCi/ml of [3H]dThd (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The dishes were then washed with cold PBS. The cells on the microscope slides were fixed with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, washed with ethanol, and dried at room temperature. The slides were dipped in NR-M2 emulsion (Konica, diluted 1:1 with H2O), dried, and exposed for 7 days at 4 °C in a light-tight plastic box. The slides were then developed and counter-stained with 3% Giemsa stain (Merck). About 150 nuclei with fewer than 100 silver grains were counted for each slide. The results were shown as a percentage histogram for each slide. Repair synthesis was taken to be the difference between the percentage values of corresponding irradiated and non-irradiated samples. DNA repair synthesis was measured essentially as described by Smith et al. (19Smith C.A. Cooper P.K. Hanawalt P.C. Friedberg E.C. Hanawalt P.C. DNA Repair: A Laboratory Manual of Research Procedures. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1981: 289-305Google Scholar). XPA[UVDE] cells were grown in 150-mm culture dishes in medium containing 0.4 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 5 days and then subcultured in non-radioactive medium for 2 days before to UV irradiation. Then the cells were incubated for 2 h in the medium with FdUrd (1 μm, Sigma), BrdUrd (10 μm, Sigma), and hydroxyurea (2.5 mm, Sigma), washed twice with PBS, and irradiated with 20 J/m2 and 40 J/m2 UV. Cells were then incubated for 3 h in medium containing FdUrd, BrdUrd, hydroxyurea, and 5 μCi/ml [3H]dThd supplemented or not with 10 μg/ml aphidicolin. Cells were then washed with PBS and lysed as described by Smithet al. (19Smith C.A. Cooper P.K. Hanawalt P.C. Friedberg E.C. Hanawalt P.C. DNA Repair: A Laboratory Manual of Research Procedures. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1981: 289-305Google Scholar). DNA solutions thus obtained were subjected to neutral CsCl gradient sedimentation and fractionated, then assayed for radioactivity. The fractions containing unreplicated (parental-density) DNA were pooled and used for alkaline CsCl gradient sedimentation. Repair synthesis was taken to be specific incorporation (3H/32P) in the parental-density DNA of the alkaline rebanding. The ratio of repair synthesis sensitive to aphidicolin was calculated as (repair synthesis in the presence of aphidicolin/repair synthesis in the absence of aphidicolin). Repair patch size was also measured as described by Smithet al. (19Smith C.A. Cooper P.K. Hanawalt P.C. Friedberg E.C. Hanawalt P.C. DNA Repair: A Laboratory Manual of Research Procedures. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1981: 289-305Google Scholar). XPA[UVDE] cells were prelabeled with32P, incubated in medium containing FdUrd, BrdUrd, and hydroxyurea for 2 h, and irradiated with 20 J/m2 UV as described above. Cells were then incubated in medium containing FdUrd, BrdUrd, hydroxyurea, and [3H]dThd for 3 h, then lysed. The parental-density DNA was purified by two successive neutral CsCl gradient sedimentation processes. Two kinds of DNA were prepared for use as markers as follows. 32P-Prelabeled DNA was prepared from cells immediately before irradiation with UV. Fully BrUra-substituted hybrid DNA was prepared from unirradiated cells that were incubated for 3 h in medium containing FdUrd, BrdUrd, and [3H]dThd. The isolated parental-density DNA was sonicated. The size distribution of the fragments of the sonicated DNA was determined by electrophoresis in a denaturing polyacrylamide gel as described (20Bowman K.K. Smith C.A. Hanawalt P., C. Mutat. Res. 1997; 385: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). From the data, the number-average molecular size of the fragments was calculated as described (21Lehman A.R. Friedberg E.C. Hanawalt P.C. DNA Repair: A Laboratory Manual of Research Procedures. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1981: 471-485Google Scholar). The size of the repair patches was measured in alkaline CsCl gradients using the parental-density DNA sonicated to a number-average molecular size of 188 nucleotides. The gradients were fractionated, and the radioactivity of each fraction was measured. The repair patch size was calculated as follows. First, the distance between the 32P-prelabeled DNA distribution and that of the3H-repair label distribution was measured. This distance was then compared with the separation between the peak of the32P-prelabeled DNA and that of the 3H-labeled fully BrUra-substituted DNA, which was determined from a separate analysis of DNA markers in a similar gradient. The ratio of these two distances was then multiplied by the average fragment size to give the average repair patch size. In another experiment, [3H]BrdUrd (Moravek) was used as the isotopic label in place of [3H]dThd. Hydroxyurea was not used. The number-average molecular size of the sonicated parental-density DNA was 211 nucleotides in this case, and the experiment was performed in the same way as above. The relative number of SSBs in the genomic DNA from cells collected at various periods of time after UV irradiation was determined by using alkaline gel analysis. Briefly, cells were prelabeled with [32P]orthophosphate, washed with Hanks' solution, and irradiated or unirradiated with 20 J/m2 UV. Cells were incubated in medium for various periods at 37 °C. In a separate experimental series, measurements over a smaller time scale from 0.5 min to 40 min were done. In this case, after UV irradiation, cells were incubated in Hanks' solution at room temperature. At appropriate periods of time, cells were lysed by incubating in 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml proteinase K (Wako), 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8) at 37 °C overnight. Genomic DNA was isolated by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Each 5-μg DNA sample was mixed with alkaline loading buffer (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: B.24Google Scholar) and electrophoresed in a 3.5% alkaline-agarose (Agarose H, Wako) gel. A set of 5′-end 32P-labeled DNA fragments (Marker 8GT; Nippon Gene) was prepared by using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara) and [γ-32P]ATP (NEN™ Life Science Products, Inc.). These size markers were electrophoresed in an alkaline gel containing the DNA sample. The gel was dried and analyzed using FLA-2000 (Fujifilm). As a measure of the relative amount SSBs, we took the following ratio: the radioactivity from the 5.6- to14.3-kilobase area/the total radioactivity. cDNA ofN. crassa UVDE was introduced behind the chicken β-actin promoter and was introduced into a human XPA cell line. Cell lines transfected with UVDE (XPA[UVDE]), wild-type XPA cDNA (XPA[cXPA]), and pCY4B vector (XPA[Vector]) were obtained. Immunoblotting using polyclonal anti-Neurospora UVDE antibody shows a single band only in XPA[UVDE] cells (Fig.1 A). The nicking activity of the extract prepared from XPA[UVDE] cells to UV damage is shown in Fig. 1 C. The extract introduced an incision immediately 5′ to the CPD, as judged by the decrease of a 49-mer band and concomitant strong appearance of the 20-mer band. This incision activity is the same as previously reported for recombinant UVDE (18Kanno S. Iwai S. Takao M. Yasui A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3096-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These data indicated that XPA[UVDE] cells express UVDE and retain its nicking activity. The colony-forming ability of the XPA transfectants after UV irradiation was assessed. XPA[Vector] cells were extremely sensitive to UV irradiation, whereas XPA[cXPA] cells exhibited UV resistance (Fig. 2). XPA[UVDE] cells showed almost the same level of UV resistance as XPA[cXPA] cells at low UV doses (Fig. 2). As the UV dose increased, XPA[cXPA] cells became more UV-resistant than XPA[UVDE] cells (Fig.2). Thus, the alternative excision repair found in eukaryotic microorganisms provided NER-deficient human cells with UV resistance of almost wild-type level. Now the question is how UV-induced DNA damage is repaired in these cells. To examine whether SSBs are actually produced after UV irradiation in XPA[UVDE] cells, we conducted alkaline gel electrophoresis analysis of the genomic DNA of UV-irradiated XPA[UVDE] cells. After 20 J/m2 UV irradiation, cells were incubated in buffer for various periods of time before genomic DNA was isolated and electrophoresed on an alkaline-agarose gel. Unirradiated DNA migrated as a discrete band near the origin, whereas the DNA isolated after UV irradiation showed a broad smeared band on the gel (Fig. 3 A). These results indicate that the SSBs are actually produced by UVDE in intact XPA[UVDE] cells immediately after UV irradiation. To quantify the SSBs, we measured the amount of DNA between 5.6- and 14.3-kilobase DNA. The amount of smeared DNA gradually increased up to 40 min after UV irradiation and reached a plateau level (Fig.3 A). Two hours after UV irradiation, the amount of the SSBs was significantly decreased (Fig. 3 B), indicating repair of SSBs. Under the conditions used, no significant difference in the extent of the smear was observed in XPA[Vector] and XPA[cXPA] cells (Fig. 3 B). These data suggest that in XPA[UVDE], SSBs are produced by UVDE, which initiates an alternative excision repair in human cells. First we characterized the repair synthesis in XPA[UVDE] cells after UV irradiation. Unscheduled DNA synthesis after UV irradiation was observed in XPA[UVDE] cells but not in XPA[Vector] cells (Fig. 4). The unscheduled DNA synthesis in XPA[UVDE] was slightly less than unscheduled DNA synthesis determined in HeLa cells and increased with UV doses (Fig.4). We next examined the sensitivity of the repair synthesis to aphidicolin, a specific inhibitor of DNA polymerase α, δ, and ε. We measured repair synthesis using the BrdUrd density shift technique (see “Experimental Procedures”). Exponentially growing cells were exposed to 20 J/m2 and 40 J/m2 UV. Hydroxyurea was added to the growth medium to reduce the level of semi-conservative DNA synthesis. At both doses used, most of UV-induced repair synthesis was aphidicolin-sensitive (Table I). These data suggest that repair synthesis is mediated mainly by aphidicolin-sensitive DNA polymerase(s): presumably by DNA polymerase δ and/or ε (see “Discussion”).Table IBuoyant density shift measurement of repair synthesis after UV irradiation in XPA [UVDE] cells in the presence or absence of aphidicolineUV doseRepair synthesisStimulation of repair synthesis−Aphidicoline+AphidicolineJ/m 2200.320.10.31400.390.080.21XPA[UVDE] cells prelabeled with 32P were irradiated with 20 J/m2 and 40 J/m2 UV and incubated for 3 h in medium containing [3H]dThd, BrdUrd, and hydroxyuea (2.5 mm) supplemented or not with aphidicoline (10 μg/ml). DNA of parental density was isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Repair synthesis was taken to be specific incorporation (3H/32P) in the parental-density DNA of alkaline rebanding. Open table in a new tab XPA[UVDE] cells prelabeled with 32P were irradiated with 20 J/m2 and 40 J/m2 UV and incubated for 3 h in medium containing [3H]dThd, BrdUrd, and hydroxyuea (2.5 mm) supplemented or not with aphidicoline (10 μg/ml). DNA of parental density was isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Repair synthesis was taken to be specific incorporation (3H/32P) in the parental-density DNA of alkaline rebanding. The measurement of repair patch size is an extension of the method used to measure the repair synthesis. 32P-Prelabeled XPA[UVDE] cells were irradiated with 20 J/m2 UV and incubated in medium containing [3H]dThd, hydroxyurea, and BrdUrd for 3 h. Parental-density DNA was isolated by two successive processes of neutral CsCl gradient sedimentation. This DNA was sonicated to an average size of 188 nucleotides and then centrifuged to equilibrium in alkaline CsCl gradients. Under these conditions, the increase in density of DNA fragments that contain repair patches (synthesized in the presence of BrdUrd) is large enough to be measured and can be compared with the increase in density of DNA completely substituted with BrUra. Gradients were fractionated, and the radioactivity profiles of 3H and 32P were determined (Fig.5). The density of the DNA molecules containing repair patches (shown by the profile of 3H) was clearly larger than that of bulk genomic DNA (shown by the profile of32P) (Fig. 5). Based on the shift between the profiles of3H and 32P and referring to the position of fully BrUra-substituted DNA, the patch size was determined as 8 ± 2 nucleotides. In the second experiment we did not add hydroxyurea, and [3H]BrdUrd was used as the isotopic label. In this case, the patch size was determined as 7 ± 2 nucleotides (radioactivity profiles were not shown). We further investigated whether PARP and XRCC1 are involved in the repair process. In the presence of 3AB, a widely used inhibitor of PARP, enhanced lethality after UV irradiation was observed in XPA[UVDE] cells (Fig. 2). By contrast, in XPA[Vector] cells and XPA[cXPA] cells, no significant increase in sensitivity to UV was observed in the presence of 3AB (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate the involvement of PARP in the repair of the SSBs introduced by UVDE. By immunoblot analysis with monoclonal antibody to pADPr, we examined whether the activation of PARP occurs in XPA[UVDE] in response to UVDE-induced SSBs. Thirty seconds after 20 J/m2 UV irradiation in XPA[UVDE] cells, a significant amount of pADPr was synthesized (Fig. 6). This is consistent with the result that the SSBs had already been introduced in the genomic DNA of XPA[UVDE] after 30 s of 20 J/m2 UV irradiation (Fig. 3 A). A peak for the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of cellular proteins was found only 2 min after UV irradiation in the cells. After 10 min, no significant pADPr was observed (Fig.6 A) even in the presence of considerable SSBs at this time (Fig. 3). Under the conditions used, no significant pADPr was detected in XPA[cXPA] cells (Fig. 6 A) and XPA[Vector] cells (data not shown) until 10 min after UV irradiation. In the presence of 3AB, the inhibition of pADPr synthesis in XPA[UVDE] cells occurred (Fig.6 A). Thus, these results indicate that PARP is activated in XPA[UVDE] cells in response to the SSBs produced by UVDE and the activation of PARP is transient in the case of irradiation with high doses of UV. The amount of pADPr synthesis in XPA[UVDE] cells is dependent on UV dose, and 7.5 J/m2 irradiation was necessary to detect pADPr synthesis in our assay (Fig.6 B). Since XRCC1 is thought to be involved in the processing of SSBs, we investigated whether XRCC1 is actually necessary for repair of SSBs introduced by UVDE. TheNeurospora UVDE gene was introduced into the CHO cell line EM9, which is mutated in the XRCC1 gene (23Shen M.R. Zdzienicka M.Z. Mohrenweiser H. Thompson L.H. Thelen M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1032-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The obtained transfectant was designated as EM9[UVDE]. Anti-Neurospora UVDE antibody detected UVDE expression in EM9[UVDE] cells (data not shown). The colony-forming ability of the CHO transfectants after UV irradiation was assessed. EM9[UVDE] cells were much more sensitive to UV than EM9[Vector] cells (Fig. 7). This indicates the involvement of XRCC1 in the repair of UVDE-introduced SSBs. In the presence of 3AB, only a very slight increase in sensitivity to UV was observed in EM9[UVDE] cells (Fig. 7). Thus, the inhibition of PARP activation does not influence the survival of EM9 cells, which lack active XRCC1 protein. We established mammalian cell lines, which enabled us to examine the repair characteristics and cellular responses of SSBs produced by a foreign UV endonuclease, UVDE. UVDE introduces a nick immediately 5′ to UV-induced CPDs and 6–4 photoproducts and initiates an alternative excision repair in several eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorganisms. The first interesting question was how much of the UV sensitivity of NER-deficient human cells is complemented by the expressed UVDE. We previously found that UVDE-initiated repair is a rapid global genome repair and is effective for most UV-induced DNA damage before NER occurs in S. pombe cells (24Yasuhira S. Morimyo M. Yasui A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26822-26827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, NER-deficient human host cells acquired the UV resistance of the wild-type level. This is the first example of an extensive complementation of UV sensitivity in NER-deficient human cells by a foreign repair protein. As previously reported, pyrimidine dimer DNA glycosylase only partially complements the UV sensitivity of NER-deficient human cells (25Valerie K. Green A.P. de Riel J.K. Henderson E.E. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 2967-2971PubMed Google Scholar), far less than UVDE shown here. This different efficiency of complementation between UVDE and pyrimidine dimer DNA glycosylase is explained by the different structures of SSBs produced by the endonucleases. UVDE produces 3′-OH ends, which are common intermediates during DNA replication, repair, and recombination processes and constitute appropriate primer terminus for DNA polymerases. However, 3′-unsaturated aldehyde termini produced by pyrimidine dimer DNA glycosylases have to be removed before repair synthesis. Another explanation is that pyrimidine dimer DNA glycosylase repairs only CPDs, whereas UVDE can repair both CPDs and 6–4 photoproducts (14Yasui A. McCready S.J. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Only at higher UV doses were XPA[cXPA] cells more UV-resistant than XPA[UVDE]. This difference may be due to the lack of transcription coupling in UVDE-initiated repair or due to the increase of UV-induced DNA lesions other than CPDs or 6–4 photoproducts, which are not recognized by UVDE but repaired by NER. This may also be due to the incomplete processing of the SSBs excessively produced by UVDE during the short time span. We showed that a large number of SSBs are introduced in XPA[UVDE] after irradiation with a high dose of UV within half a minute, and considerable SSBs remain to be repaired even 2 h after irradiation (Fig. 3). The next interesting question is how the UVDE-initiated repair proceeds in human cells. The repair synthesis was shown to be mostly dependent on aphidicolin-sensitive DNA polymerase, and the determined patch size of the repair was about seven nucleotides. Since the repair patch size of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen-dependent pathway of BER has been reported as between 7 and 14 nucleotides (26Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F. Raspaglio G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Abbondandolo A. Dogliotti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9573-9578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), or less than 10 nucleotides in length (27Pascucci B. Stucki M. Jonsson Z.O. Dogliotti E. Hübscher U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33696-33702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 28Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Hurwitz J. Gary R. Levin D.S. Tomkinson A.E. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33703-33708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), the patch size for UVDE-initiated excision repair fits in reasonably well with that of the BER pathway. It has also been reported that the repair synthesis of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen-dependent pathway is not catalyzed by DNA polymerase α (29Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and is catalyzed by DNA polymerase δ or ε (27Pascucci B. Stucki M. Jonsson Z.O. Dogliotti E. Hübscher U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33696-33702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 28Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Hurwitz J. Gary R. Levin D.S. Tomkinson A.E. Park M.S. J. Biol.

Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). By in vitro assays with purified recombinant proteins, we and other groups (30Yoon J.H. Swiderski P.M. Kaplan B.E. Takao M. Yasui A. Shen B. Pfeifer G.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4809-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 31Alleva J.L. Zuo S. Hurwitz J. Doetsch P.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 14: 2659-2666Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) show that the SSBs produced by UVDE became substrates for cleavage by FEN1 (flap endonuclease 1), which has already been shown to be a factor involved in the proliferating cell nuclear antigen-dependent BER pathway (27Pascucci B. Stucki M. Jonsson Z.O. Dogliotti E. Hübscher U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33696-33702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 28Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Hurwitz J. Gary R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 4354-4363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, the SSBs produced by UVDE in XPA[UVDE] cells may be processed by DNA polymerase δ and/or ε and components that are common with long patch repair pathway of BER. The third interesting question about UVDE-initiated repair of UV damage concerns the cellular responses to the induced SSBs in mammalian cells. Western blot analysis showed that immediately after irradiation with a high dose of UV, cellular proteins were poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated in XPA[UVDE] cells (Fig. 6). This is in contrast to the response in XPA[cXPA] cells, which showed no significant synthesis of pADPr (Fig.6 A). By adding 3AB, a competitive inhibitor of PARP, to XPA[UVDE] cells, pADPr synthesis was suppressed (Fig. 6 A). These results give additional clear evidence for PARP activation by SSBs in human cells. 10 min after UV irradiation, pADPr was no longer observed (Fig. 6 A). This is explained by reports that, after excessive activation of PARP, pADPr has a short half-life close to 1 min (34Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Althaus F.R. Mutat. Res. 1989; 218: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and the levels of NAD, which is a substrate of PARP, are depleted (4Chatterjee S. Berger N.A. Nickoloff J.A. Hoekstra M.F. DNA Damage and Repair. 2. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 487-515Google Scholar). We have shown here that 3AB enhanced the UV lethality of XPA[UVDE], whereas 3AB did not make any significant difference to survival in XPA[cXPA] cells, indicating the involvement of PARP in the repair of the SSBs. These results are consistent with reports that cells treated with alkylating agents and x-rays, which are known to produce SSBs in cells, are sensitive to 3AB (4Chatterjee S. Berger N.A.

The lethal effect of 3AB on cells treated with these agents is known to be maximal in S phase (35Boorstein R.J. Pardee A.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 120: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 36Ben-Hur E. Utsumi H. Elkind M.M. Radiat. Res. 1984; 97: 546-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), suggesting that PARP is a survival factor playing an essential role during recovery from SSBs in S phase. PARP is known to interact directly with XRCC1 (7Masson M. Niedergang C. Schreiber V. Muller S. de Murcia J.M. de Murcia G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). It has been reported that S-phase-specific repair of SSBs mediated by XRCC1 is indispensable for resistance to alkylating agents in CHO cells (6Taylor R.M. Moore D.J. Whitehouse J. Johnson P. Caldecott K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therefore, to link the effect of 3AB on XRCC1, we introduced the UVDE gene into a CHO cell line, EM9, that is defective in the XRCC1 gene. We showed that EM9 cells expressing UVDE (EM9[UVDE]) are extremely sensitive to UV, indicating the involvement of XRCC1 in repair of the SSBs (Fig. 7). The addition of 3AB results in almost no increase in the UV sensitivity of EM9[UVDE] (Fig. 7). This result suggests that PARP and XRCC1 play essential roles in the same pathway, probably in the same S-phase-specific recovery pathway for SSBs. It has been shown that nuclear foci of XRCC1 co-localize with Rad51 (6Taylor R.M. Moore D.J. Whitehouse J. Johnson P. Caldecott K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, PARP and XRCC1 may function in concert with a homologous recombination pathway in the processing of SSBs as well as double-strand breaks, which are produced from SSBs during the replication process. Recent molecular and genetic analyses of repair-deficient strains from various organisms suggest that SSBs are one of the major risk factors for genome instability induced by oxidative DNA damage. We consider that UVDE-expressing cell lines offer a unique experimental system for the analysis of the cellular response to SSBs in mammalian cells. We thank Dr. H. Tohda for useful discussions.

https://openalex.org/W2055069386,"We studied the sequential topology of the NH(2) and COOH termini of apoB during translocation by expressing, in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and HepG2 cells, an apoB42 construct with c-Myc and hemagglutinin (HA) tags at 2 and 41% (relative to apoB100) of its amino acid sequence. We conducted similar studies using monoclonal antibodies against the NH(2) and COOH termini of apoB100 in HepG2 cells. After radiolabeling, microsomes were immunoisolated from transfected CHO cells using anti-c-Myc or anti-HA antibodies. Throughout a 60-min chase in the presence of N-acetyl-leucyl-norleucinal, more than 90% of microsomes were isolated by anti-HA antibodies, whereas less than 10% were isolated by anti-c-Myc antibodies. Proteinase K digestion of total microsomes consistently generated two fragments ( approximately 70 and approximately 120 kDa) of apoB42 containing the NH(2) terminus throughout the chase; no fragments containing the COOH terminus were detected. Immunofluorescent studies of transfected CHO cells were consistent with results from the labeling studies. Essentially identical results were obtained from pulse-chase studies in both native and apoB42-transfected HepG2 cells. The present studies support a model in which, in the absence of adequate core lipid synthesis, there is partial translocation of apoB leading to cytosolic exposure, ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation directly from the original translocation channel."

Complex and simple retroviruses have evolved different systems to overcome this problem. Complex retroviruses encode a viral regulatory protein as the RNA exporter, whereas simple retroviruses utilize cellular RNA-exporting proteins. In both cases, the recognition of the viral unspliced RNA depends on cis-acting viral RNA motifs present in the virus genome but absent from the completely spliced subgenomic RNA. HIV Rev is the prototypical viral RNA exporter. It contains a lencine-rich nuclear export signal (NES)1 and utilizes the nuclear export pathway mediated by cellular protein CRM-1 (3Fornerod M.

Lencine-rich NES-containing proteins access the CRM-1 pathway through specific interactions among NES, RanGTP, and CRM-1 proteins. Such interactions can be disrupted by the drug leptomycin B. (8Wolff B. Sanglier J.J. Wang Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, Rev/RRE-mediated HIV RNA export is leptomycin B-sensitive (8Wolff B. Sanglier J.J. Wang Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Even though cellular mRNA export in mammalian cells appears to be different from the Rev/RRE pathway and thus CRM-1-independent (9Saavedra C. Felber B. Izaurralde E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar,10Pasquinelli A.E. Ernst R.K. Lund E. Grimm C. Zapp M.L. Rekosh D. Hammarskjöld M.L. Dahlberg J.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7500-7510Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), studies in yeast suggest that the export of a subset of yeast mRNA may also utilize the CRM-1 pathway (11Murphy R. Wente S.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). A recent study inXenopus oocytes also showed that LR-NES could compete for nuclear export of some cellular mRNA (12Pasquinelli A.E. Powers M.A. Lund E. Forbes D. Dahlberg J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14394-14399Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the CRM-1 pathway is conserved from yeast to human, but in mammalian cells where greater amounts and more complex RNA/protein cargoes exist, it has evolved into a more specialized export pathway. A well studied RNA export motif of the simple retroviruses is theconstitutive transport element (CTE) of type D retroviruses (13Bray M. Prasad S. Dubay J.W. Hunter E. Jeang K.T. Rekosh D.

CTE is proposed to interact directly with cellular factor(s) to function and presumably utilize the export pathway of a subset of cellular mRNAs. Two CTE-binding proteins have been identified. The first candidate CTE co-factor is RNA helicase A (RHA), which binds to wild-type but not functionally impaired mutants of CTE. RHA also shuttles constantly between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, despite its steady-state nuclear localization (1Tang H. Gaietta G.M. Fischer W.H. Ellisman M.H. Wong-Staal F. Science. 1997; 276: 1412-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This shuttling ability was later shown to be conferred by a bidirectional nuclear transportdomain (NTD) localized at the carboxyl terminus of the protein (17Tang H. McDonald D. Middlesworth T. Hope T.J. Wong-Staal F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3540-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The functional significance of CTE-RHA interaction is underscored by microinjection experiments in which injection of an anti-RHA antibody blocked CTE-mediated gene expression in human cells (18Li J. Tang H. Mullen T.M. Westberg C. Reddy T.R. Rose D.W. Wong-Staal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Recently, RHA was shown to associate with pre-mRNA in vivo, suggesting a possible role in cellular mRNA processing/export (19Zhang S Herrmann G. Grosse F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1055-1064PubMed Google Scholar). Human Tap (herpesvirus saimiri Tip-associatedprotein) is identified as another CTE-binding protein (2Grüter P. Tabernero C. von Kobbe C.

Its yeast homologue, Mex67p, was previously shown to be involved in poly(A) RNA export in yeast. Mutation of Mex67 results in the nuclear accumulation of poly(A) RNA (21Segref A. Sharma K. Doye V. Hellwig A. Huber J. Lührmann R. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3256-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Functional studies of bothXenopus oocytes and somatic cells further validate the role of Tap in the nuclear export of CTE-containing RNA. However, there are still conflicting reports regarding the minimal domains in Tap required to assist in CTE function (22Bear J. Tan W. Zolotukhin A. Tabernero C. Hudson E.A. Felber B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6306-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 23Braun I.C. Rohrbach F. Schmitt C. Izaurralde E.

Tap also binds to RNA nonspecifically in vitro and associates with a nucleoporin, Nup214, again suggesting a general role in cellular mRNA export (25Katahira J. Strässer K. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Jung J.U. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2593-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 26Bachi A. Braun I.C. Rodrigues J.P. Panté N. Ribbeck K. von Kobbe C. Kutay U. Wilm M. Görlich D. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. RNA. 2000; 6: 136-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Here, we report the interaction between these two CTE-binding proteins, RHA and Tap. Interactions are detected in vitro by GST pull-down and in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Binding domains are mapped to the amino termini of both proteins. The possible functional relevance of this interaction in CTE function is also addressed. pGST-Tap-(1–619) and pGST-Tap-(61–619) were generous gifts from Dr. B. Felber. The GST-Tap carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants were constructed by direct digestion of GST-Tap-(1–619) with appropriate restriction enzymes and reclosing the parental plasmid by blunt-end ligation. The DNA fragments encoding amino acids 319–619 and 505–619 of Tap were amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to make GST-Tap-(319–619) and GST-Tap-(505–619). pc-RHA, GFP-CTD, and PK-NTD were described previously (1Tang H. Gaietta G.M. Fischer W.H. Ellisman M.H. Wong-Staal F. Science. 1997; 276: 1412-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 17Tang H. McDonald D. Middlesworth T. Hope T.J. Wong-Staal F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3540-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Carboxyl-terminal deletions of RHA were constructed by digesting pcRHA with appropriate restriction enzymes and re-closing the parental plasmid by blunt-end ligation. The amino-terminal deletion plasmid pcRHA-(640–1269) was constructed by cloning the 2.0-kilobase Afl-II and XhoI fragment of pcRHA (encoding amino acids 640–1269 of RHA) back into pcDNA3 by blunt-end ligation. A consensus Kozak sequence and ATG start codon downstream of the AflII site facilitated the translation of the carboxyl-terminal half of RHA. The Tap expression plasmid pc-myc-Tap was constructed by cloning aBamHI/EcoRI fragment from pGST-Tap-(1–619) containing the full-length Tap cDNA into the BamHI andEcoRI sites of Myc-NPc-TNLS (27Michael W.M. Eder P.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3587-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The coding sequence for Tap-(61–619) was obtained by PCR and cloned into theBamHI/EcoRI sites of Myc-NPc-TNLS. Tap-X was constructed by digesting pc-myc-Tap with XhoI and reclosing the parental plasmid, thus removing the carboxyl-terminal sequence (amino acids 584–619) downstream of the XhoI site of Tap cDNA. Tap-X-NTD was constructed by cloning a PCR fragment encoding the NTD of RHA into the XhoI site of Tap-X. TheXhoI site engineered onto the PCR fragment ensured that NTD was in frame with the rest of the Tap sequence. A stop codon was introduced after the NTD. pDM138CTE, pDM138CTE-antisense, and pSV-gagpol-MPMVCTE (gagpol-CTE) were all described previously (13Bray M. Prasad S. Dubay J.W. Hunter E. Jeang K.T.

Virology. 1997; 228: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells, HeLa cells, and d-17 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Qcl-3 cells were maintained in M199 medium containing 4% fetal calf serum and 1% chicken serum (29Cullen B.R. Skalka A.M. Ju G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2946-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). COS-1 and HeLa cells were transfected by conventional calcium phosphate precipitation method, andd-17 and Qcl-3 cells were transfected with the Effectene transfection reagents (Qiagen). CAT assays, p24 assays, Western blotting, and heterokaryon assays were performed as described (17Tang H. McDonald D. Middlesworth T. Hope T.J. Wong-Staal F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3540-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Li J. Tang H. Mullen T.M. Westberg C. Reddy T.R. Rose D.W. Wong-Staal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Co-immunoprecipitation was done as follows: 293T cells were transfected with pc-myc-Tap, cells were collected and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 10% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS) 48 h post-transfection. The cell lysate was then incubated with normal rabbit serum-coated agarose beads for 1 h to block nonspecific interactions. The beads were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was then incubated with either a rabbit pre-immune serum or a rabbit polyclonal antibody against RHA for 1 h. Protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were then added, and the mixture was further incubated at room temperature for another 3 h and then washed four times with the lysis buffer. The precipitated proteins were separated on a 10% gel, and a monoclonal antibody, 9E10, was used to detect themyc-tagged Tap protein. The immunodepletion assay was done with the same cell lysate. After incubating with RHA antibody and protein A/G beads, the supernatant was analyzed by immunoblotting with the appropriate antibodies. The same cell lysate was also subject to RNA selection assays with biotinylated-CTE RNA as described (20Yoon D.W Lee H. Seol W. DeMaria M. Rosenzweig M. Jung J.U. Immunity. 1997; 6: 571-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The RNA was omitted from the reaction in the control experiment. In vitrotranscription/translation of the RHA and its deletion mutants were performed with a single-tube protein (STP3) kit from Novagen according to the instruction manual. Plasmids serving as templates were extracted with phenol and chloroform and precipitated with ethanol to remove any contaminating RNase in the plasmid preparation. GST, GST-Tap, and its mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and bound to glutathione-beads. 20 μg of HeLa nuclear extracts or 30 ng of recombinant RHA was then incubated with the beads in the binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5% glycerol) for 3 h at room temperature before being washed four times with the binding buffer. The beads were then re-suspended in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis buffer and boiled for 5 min before loading onto an 8% gel. For Western blotting, RHA was detected by a rabbit polyclonal antibody as described (1Tang H. Gaietta G.M. Fischer W.H. Ellisman M.H. Wong-Staal F. Science. 1997; 276: 1412-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In the case of radioactively labeled proteins, 40 μl of thein vitro transcription/translation products were incubated with GST-beads, and the gel was dried and exposed to an x-ray film overnight to visualize the protein bands. GST pull-down experiments were performed to test the interaction between RHA and Tap. A HeLa nuclear extract was used as a convenient source of RHA. Extracts were incubated with column-bound GST and GST-Tap to form protein complexes. After extensive washing, the bound proteins were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. RHA was identified by a polyclonal antibody on a Western blot. As shown in Fig.1 A, GST-Tap specifically pulled down RHA, whereas GST did not show any binding to RHA (lanes 4 and 7). Because both RHA and Tap are RNA-binding proteins, we treated the nuclear extracts with RNase before the binding reaction, to rule out the possibility that some cellular RNA was bridging the observed interaction. The RNase treatment did not affect the binding (lanes 11 and 13), suggesting that RNA does not play a bridging role. An interaction was also observed between GST-Tap and recombinant RHA protein (lane 16), indicating that the interaction is direct. To test the in vivo interaction between Tap and RHA, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. Amyc-tagged form of Tap was expressed in 293T cells by transfecting the Tap expression plasmid pc-myc-Tap. Total cellular proteins were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-RHA antibody. The precipitated proteins were separated, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with a monoclonal antibody 9E10, which recognizes the myc tag. Pre-immune rabbit serum was used as a negative control for the immunoprecipitation reaction. Myc-Tap was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated by the ant-RHA antibody, whereas the control serum did not produce any signal (Fig.1 B, left panel). It is noteworthy that this in vivo interaction was detected in the absence of any expression of CTE. Co-expression of CTE RNA with Tap did not enhance the binding (data not shown). To confirm that RHA and Tap are present in the same complex in vivo, an immunodepletion experiment was carried out to deplete RHA from the cell extracts containing the transfected Myc-Tap. Incubation with an anti-RHA antibody depleted 80% of RHA from the extract. (Fig. 1 B, left). Similar depletion of Myc-Tap was also observed in the same extract (Fig. 1 B, middle). In contrast, the level of a control cellular protein, MEK-1, was not affected (Fig. 1 B, right). To demonstrate that CTE, Tap, and RHA can form a complex in vivo, the same cell lysate used for the co-immunoprecipitation and immunodepletion experiments was subject to RNA selection with biotinylated CTE RNA prepared byin vitro transcription. CTE RNA selected RHA and Myc-Tap from the cell extract simultaneously, suggesting that both proteins are in a complex with CTE RNA (Fig. 1 C). We next examined whether the NTD of RHA is required for the binding of RHA to Tap. RHA and deletion mutants of RHA were produced by in vitro transcription/translation and labeled with 35S. The proteins were then subjected to GST pull-down assays by GST-Tap. β-Galactosidase was also translated and used in the binding as a negative control. Like the endogenous RHA, thein vitro translated full-length RHA bound to GST-Tap. β-Galactosidase did not show any binding to GST-Tap under the same condition (Fig. 2 A), demonstrating the specificity of the interaction. Next, truncation mutants of RHA with deletions from both the amino and the carboxyl termini of the protein were made and tested for binding to GST-Tap. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the minimal Tap-binding domain on RHA is mapped to the amino terminus of the protein (amino acids 1–257), indicating that the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein, which contains the NTD, is not necessary for its binding to Tap. The original Tap cDNA isolated by Yoon et al.(20Yoon D.W Lee H. Seol W. DeMaria M. Rosenzweig M. Jung J.U. Immunity. 1997; 6: 571-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) encoded 559 amino acids. Later, an additional sequence of 60 amino acids was found to reside upstream of this original cDNA. Both reverse transcriptase-PCR and Western analysis indicated that the longer cDNA represents the true full-length Tap cDNA (23Braun I.C. Rohrbach F. Schmitt C. Izaurralde E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1953-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 24Kang Y. Cullen B.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1126-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We also used this longer version of Tap, designated Tap-(1–619), in our experiments for binding to RHA. To map the RHA-binding domain on Tap, we generated deletion mutants truncating from both ends of the Tap cDNA. These mutants were made as GST-fusion proteins and assayed for their abilities to pull down RHA from the HeLa nuclear extract. The Tap mutants containing the amino-terminal extension (amino acids 1–61) all produced significant degradation products upon purification fromE. coli, whereas mutants lacking the first 61 amino acids were more stable. However, Tap-(1–619) is very stable when expressed in 293T cells (Fig. 1), indicating the instability of the full-length Tap is result of a bacteria-specific degradation event, which was not investigated further. Despite the degradation in E. coli, we were able to obtain a sufficient amount of full-length recombinant Tap proteins to perform the GST pull-down experiments (Fig. 2 C). The carboxyl terminus of Tap is dispensable for RHA binding. Although the amino-terminal 60-amino acid extension of Tap contributes to the binding, its removal did not completely abrogate RHA binding. Tap-(61–619) retained weak (about 20% of the full-length Tap) RHA binding (Fig. 2 C, right panel). The amino-terminal half (amino acids 1–444) of the full-length Tap is sufficient to bind to RHA in vitro. To explore the possible cross-talk between RHA and Tap in assisting CTE function in vivo, we tested whether RHA or its mutants had any effects on CTE function in a system in which CTE function is dependent on Tap. In the Qcl-3 cell line, which is such a system, CTE-mediated gene expression is dependent on the co-expression of a functional cDNA of human Tap (24Kang Y. Cullen B.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1126-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We first validated the requirement of human Tap for CTE function in these quail cells. The CAT gene expression from the CTE reporter construct pDM138CTE was low and comparable with that from the control plasmid pDM138CTE-antisense, in which CTE was expressed in the antisense orientation (Fig. 3 A, left panel). In the canine cell line d-17, CAT expression from pDM138CTE was at least 10 time higher than from pDM138CTE-antisense (Fig. 3 A, left panel). CTE also functioned very well in HeLa cells (Fig. 3 A, left panel). We then co-transfected the Tap cDNA expression plasmid (pc-myc-Tap) with CTE reporter constructs. In Qcl-3 cells, Tap was found specifically to enhance CTE-mediated gene expression but had no effect on the CTE antisense reporter (Fig. 3 A, right panel). However, in our hands, the transactivation effect of Tap was limited to 2–3-fold, in contrast to the >14-fold enhancement reported by Kang and Cullen (24Kang Y. Cullen B.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1126-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) using essentially the same CAT reporter constructs. Varying the amount of co-transfected Tap plasmid from 50 to 500 ng did not raise the transactivation effect of Tap more than 3-fold (data not shown). The reason for this discrepancy is not clear at this time. We continued to explore other reporter systems to obtain a higher level of transactivation by Tap on CTE in Qcl-3 cells. Using the HIV gagpol-CTE reporter plasmid, pSV-gagpol-MPMVCTE (13Bray M. Prasad S. Dubay J.W. Hunter E. Jeang K.T. Rekosh D. Hammarskjöld M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1256-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), we found that co-transfecting 100 ng of pc-myc-Tap resulted in a 7–10-fold increase in p24 gag expression from a functional CTE (Fig.3 B). Interestingly, Tap-(61–619) is only minimally functional in these experiments. An average of less a than 2-fold increase of p24 gag was observed with this Tap mutant (Fig.3 B). Tap-(61–619) is as stable as Tap-(1–619) expressed in quail cells and more stable than Tap-(1–619) as bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins (Figs. 2 C and3 C). A bi-directional transport domain (NTD) was identified at the carboxyl terminus of RHA (17Tang H. McDonald D. Middlesworth T. Hope T.J. Wong-Staal F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3540-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). When overexpressed in mammalian cells in which CTE is fully functional, NTD exerted a modest inhibitory effect on CTE-mediated reporter gene expression (data not shown). This low level of inhibition may be a result of the high endogenous level of RHA and/or Tap in these cells. We then tested the effect of NTD on CTE activity in Qcl-3 cells where CTE-mediated gene expression can be manipulated by controlling the amount of co-transfected Tap. As shown in Fig. 3 D (upper left panel), in this system, excess NTD exerted a significant transdominant negative effect on CTE function. This inhibition was specific to CTE, as no effect was seen when a pCAT reporter or a Rev/RRE reporter system (pDM128) was used (Fig. 3 D, middle and lower left panels). To control for possible promoter competitions, an irrelevantmyc-tagged protein, NPc-TNLS, expressed from the same promoter was used in parallel experiments (Fig. 3 C, right panels). We next examined whether a transdominant Tap mutant can interfere with the ability of RHA to up-regulate CTE function in permissive cells (18Li J. Tang H. Mullen T.M. Westberg C. Reddy T.R. Rose D.W. Wong-Staal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We deleted the carboxyl-terminal 36 amino acids of Tap and generated Tap-X. A similar mutant of Tap was reported to have a transdominant negative effect on wild-type Tap in Qcl-3 cells (24Kang Y. Cullen B.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1126-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Here, we show that Tap-X could also inhibit CTE function significantly in permissive cell lines such asd-17 and HeLa cells (Fig.4 A, compare CTE alone and with Tap-X). The up-regulation of CTE function by over-expression of RHA in HeLa cells was also completely abolished by co-transfecting an equal amount of Tap-X expression plasmid (Fig. 4 A), suggesting that this Tap mutant interferes with RHA function in vivo. Again, no inhibition was seen with the pCAT reporter (Fig.4 B). A nuclear export signal of Tap was reported to reside at the carboxyl terminus of the Tap protein (24Kang Y. Cullen B.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1126-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). However, this carboxyl-terminal domain was later shown to be important for the nuclear rim association and to interact with components of the nuclear pore complex (22Bear J. Tan W. Zolotukhin A. Tabernero C. Hudson E.A. Felber B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6306-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 25Katahira J. Strässer K. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Jung J.U. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2593-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 26Bachi A. Braun I.C. Rodrigues J.P. Panté N. Ribbeck K. von Kobbe C. Kutay U. Wilm M. Görlich D. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. RNA. 2000; 6: 136-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), a distinct nuclear export domain was mapped to amino acids 83–110 of the protein (22Bear J. Tan W. Zolotukhin A. Tabernero C. Hudson E.A. Felber B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6306-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The inability of Tap-X to transactivate CTE in quail cells is thus probably a result of a defect in its interaction with the nuclear pore complex rather than the lack of nuclear export per se. Because NTD contains a nuclear export signal and can be incorporated into the nuclear pore complex (Ref. 1Tang H. Gaietta G.M. Fischer W.H. Ellisman M.H. Wong-Staal F. Science. 1997; 276: 1412-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar; data not shown), we examined whether NTD could replace the carboxyl domain of Tap that is missing in Tap-X. To this end, we constructed an expression plasmid, Tap-X-NTD, in which NTD was fused to the carboxyl terminus of Tap-X. Proper expression of Tap, Tap-X, and Tap-X-NTD in transfected cells was verified by Western blot using an anti-Myc antibody that recognized the amino-terminal myc tag of all three proteins (Fig.5 A). Tap-X-NTD was then tested for its ability to transactivate the CTE function in Qcl-3 cells. Surprisingly, fusion of NTD to Tap-X not only did not rescue Tap function, it also further increased the inhibitory effect of Tap-X (Fig. 5, B and C). Tap-X typically inhibited the CTE activity by 50%, whereas Tap-X-NTD consistently inhibited more than 90% of the Tap-mediated CTE activity. When the above experiments were repeated in the CTE-permissive cell line d-17, identical inhibition profiles were observed for Tap-X and Tap-X-NTD (Fig. 5 D). In this cell line, the transactivation by human Tap is minimal because CTE is fully functional. We propose that Tap-X-NTD exerts a greater inhibitory effect by combining the inhibitory effect of Tap-X and NTD. Both Tap-X and Tap-X-NTD were able to shuttle in heterokaryon assays (Ref. 14Ernst R.K. Bray M. Rekosh D. Hammarskjöld M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar; data not shown). Post-transcriptional regulation is an important aspect of the tight control of retroviral gene expression. A unique feature of this process is the nuclear export of the unspliced retroviral mRNA, because normally only fully spliced mRNA can exit the nucleus. The CTE motif enables the type D retroviruses to access cellular RNA export pathways that normally would not be accessible to the unspliced RNA. In this study, we show that two CTE-binding proteins, RHA and Tap, can interact with each other and that a transdominant negative mutant of one interferes with the function of the other. The reciprocal inhibition by these mutants suggests that functional cross-talk exists between RHA and Tap in mediating CTE function in vivo. The CTE export pathway overlaps with the cellular mRNA export pathway and is CRM-1-independent (9Saavedra C. Felber B. Izaurralde E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 10Pasquinelli A.E. Ernst R.K. Lund E. Grimm C. Zapp M.L. Rekosh D. Hammarskjöld M.L. Dahlberg J.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7500-7510Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The NTD of RHA has also been shown to export through a leptomycin B-insensitive pathway, which is thus distinct from the CRM-1-dependent pathway (17Tang H. McDonald D. Middlesworth T. Hope T.J. Wong-Staal F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3540-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Similarly, the carboxyl-terminal domain of Tap did not interact with CRM-1 in vitro, and Tap-mediated transactivation of the CTE reporter gene was not inhibited by a nucleoporin mutant that inhibits the CRM-1 export pathway (24Kang Y. Cullen B.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1126-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), indicating that Tap also utilizes an export receptor distinct from CRM-1. The fact that the RHA NTD is dispensable for Tap binding suggests that RHA is not “piggybacking” on Tap for export. The reverse cannot be proved or disproved at this time, as the real location of the nuclear export signal in Tap is still controversial (22Bear J. Tan W. Zolotukhin A. Tabernero C. Hudson E.A. Felber B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6306-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 23Braun I.C. Rohrbach F. Schmitt C. Izaurralde E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1953-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 24Kang Y. Cullen B.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1126-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In any case, it is likely that Tap and RHA use similar or overlapping nuclear export pathways, as NTD can interfere with both RHA and Tap function in vivo. Because both Tap and RHA have been implicated in the nuclear export of subtypes of cellular mRNA, it is also possible that the RHA-Tap interaction contributes to the processing/export of these cellular mRNA. The finding that the first 60 amino acids of Tap are required for optimal binding to RHA is interesting. This fragment was found to be dispensable for CTE binding both in vitro and in vivo. In Xenopus oocytes, Tap-(61–619) was sufficient to enhance CTE export from the nucleus when CTE was placed in an intron and exported as an excised intron lariat (2Grüter P. Tabernero C. von Kobbe C. Schmitt C. Saavedra C. Bachi A. Wilm M. Felber B.K. Izaurralde E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). However, the same investigators later reported that the domains of Tap required to stimulate CTE-mediated nuclear export of an excised intron lariat or of U6 RNA are very different (26Bachi A. Braun I.C. Rodrigues J.P. Panté N. Ribbeck K. von Kobbe C. Kutay U. Wilm M. Görlich D. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. RNA. 2000; 6: 136-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The data with U6-CTE is more consistent with data from somatic cells. Whether Tap-(61–619) is active in the U6-CTE system was not addressed in the more recent study. In the quail cell line Qcl-3, Tap-(61–619) was found to be less active than Tap-(1–619) in transactivation of CTE-mediated CAT gene expression, even though the CTE binding activities of the two proteins were comparable (24Kang Y. Cullen B.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1126-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that Tap-(61–619) is only marginally active in promoting CTE-mediated HIV Gag expression in quail cells. Because Tap-(61–619) retains full CTE binding, nuclear export, and nuclear pore association activities and is as stable as full-length Tap in quail cells, our data suggest that the defect of Tap-(61–619) to enhance CTE-mediated gene expression in quail cells results from its diminished binding to RHA. We consistently observed a high level of transactivation of CTE function in quail cells when a CTE-Gag reporter (pSV-gagpol-CTE) was used instead of a CTE-CAT reporter (pDM138CTE). We also observed a very high background level of “leaky” CAT expression by the pDM138 reporter constructs in the quail cells, possibly contributing to the poor transactivation by Tap when these constructs were used. Multiple RNA processing steps that can contribute to the function of CTE and its co-factors likely exist in vivo. Emerging evidence suggests that several aspects of RNA processing are tightly linked in vivo. Releasing RNA from the splicing complex, polyadenylation of the pre-mRNA, translocation across the nuclear pore complex, releasing the RNA exporter from the RNA-protein complex in the cytoplasm, and finally, recycling the exporter back to the nucleus are all related and possibly coupled steps of RNA processing after transcription and splicing. Recently, cis-acting RNA elements from three intron-less transcripts, mouse histone H2agene, HSV TK gene, and HBV RNA, were found to suppress a cryptic splicing event, enhance polyadenylation, and promote RNA export (30Huang Y. Wimler K.M. Carmichael G.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1642-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). RNA helicases have been found to play a role in these steps (31Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Cell. 1998; 92: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar, 32Ohno M. Shimura Y. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 33Ono Y.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5761-5777Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). RHA potentially can play similar roles in multiple steps of the post-transcriptional processing of both specific subtypes of cellular mRNA and retroviral mRNA. Different partners may facilitate different aspects of RHA function. A novel shuttle protein, HAP95, was recently identified as interacting with RHA in the yeast two-hybrid assay and as up-regulating CTE function when co-expressed with a CTE reporter gene (39Westberg C. Yang J. Tang H. Reddy T.R. Wong-Staal F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21396-21401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because there is no obvious yeast homologue of RHA, it may be difficult to determine the specific roles of RHA in these individual processes using genetic means. In this regard, it is interesting to note that CTE is not functional in yeast cells to promote the nuclear export of unspliced RNA. 2H. Tang and F. Wong-Staal, unpublished data. In addition to mediating CTE function, RHA was also found to be essential for the Rev/RRE function in vivo as microinjection of an anti-RHA antibody abolished Rev-dependent reporter gene expression from an RRE reporter construct (18Li J. Tang H. Mullen T.M. Westberg C. Reddy T.R. Rose D.W. Wong-Staal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The putative role that RHA plays in the Rev/RRE system is probably not at the export level, as NTD utilizes an export pathway that is distinct from the CRM-1-mediated export pathway used by Rev (17Tang H. McDonald D. Middlesworth T. Hope T.J. Wong-Staal F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3540-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, NTD and Tap-X-NTD had little inhibitory effect on Rev/RRE function. Rev/RRE also functions well in the Qcl-3 cell line, which is nonpermissive for CTE function, indicating that Tap is not required for Rev/RRE to function. We thank Dr. B. Felber for GST-Tap plasmids and Dr. B. Cullen for Qcl-3 cells. We also acknowledge Silvestre Ramos for his excellent technical support."

The reasons for the covalent attachment are not understood.

In combination with previous work showing that an AXXAH variant of cytochrome c 552 is much less stable than the CXXCH form, it can be concluded that covalent attachment of heme via either of thioether bonds is sufficient to confer considerable stability and that these bonds contribute little to the setting of the reduction potential. The absence of AXXCH or CXXAH heme-binding motifs from bacterial cytochromesc may relate to the coexistence of the assembly pathway with that for formation of disulfide bonds in the bacterial periplasm.

Moore G.R Cytochromes c: Evolutionary, Structural and Physicochemical Aspects. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990Google Scholar). Less well known is that in certain protozoan species the heme attachment is to an AXXCH motif (2Pettigrew G.W Nature. 1973; 241: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 3Pettigrew G.W FEBS Lett. 1972; 22: 64-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This attachment has also been achieved by mutagenesis of the gene for human mitochondrial cytochromec followed by expression in yeast (4Tanaka Y. Kubota I. Amachi T. Yoshizumi H. Matsubara H J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1990; 108: 7-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The single attachment mode has also been observed in mitochondrial cytochromesc 1 from protozoa (5Mukai K. Yoshida M. Toyosaki H. Yao Y. Wakabayashi S. Matsubara H Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 178: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 6Priest J.W. Hajduk S.L J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20188-20195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but has to date not been found in a bacterial c-type cytochrome. It is still not clear what advantage accrues to a c-type cytochrome through having the heme covalently attached (7Barker P.D. Ferguson S.J Structure. 1999; 7: R281-R290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the covalent attachment is a device to prevent heme loss by dissociation (8Wood P.M FEBS Lett. 1983; 164: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It has also been argued that the thioether bonds increase binding affinity of methionine to the ferrous iron and thus contribute to the relatively high reduction potentials of somec-type cytochromes (9Schejter A. Plotkin B Biochem. J. 1998; 255: 353-356Google Scholar). Recently, the effects of losing both the covalent bonds to heme have been described in studies where the cytochrome c552 from a thermophileHydrogenobacter thermophilus was converted into ab-type cytochrome as a result of mutation of the sequence CXXCH to AXXAH (10Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Expression of theb-type derivative of cytochrome c552was achieved in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli, which is where, most unusually, the holo form of cytochromec552 can be expressed without the aid of the cytochrome c biogenesis apparatus that functions in the periplasm (11Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 12Sinha N. Ferguson S.J FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 161: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is currently thought (10Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) that the apo polypeptide adopts a sufficient state of preorganization to bind heme and then to adopt the final fully folded structure, accompanied in the case of polypeptide with the CXXCH sequence by the spontaneous and stereo-specific formation 1P. D. Barker, unpublished results. of the two thioether bonds. The AXXAH variant of H. thermophilus cytochromec 552 is less stable than the wild type CXXCH protein, and the reduction potential is lowered by 75 mV (10Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Understanding of the contributions of the two thioether bonds to the properties of this cytochrome c 552clearly requires comparative data for proteins with a single thioether bond. The successful formation of the b-type cytochrome derivative of the H. thermophilus cytochromec 552 prompted us to investigate whether it was possible to produce one or both of the single cysteine attached forms of cytochrome c552. A successful outcome, reported here, means that we are able to for the first time to assess the contribution of each thioether bond to the physiochemical properties of a c-type cytochrome. Surprisingly, it is found that loss of either of the thioether bonds has only a marginal effect on the stability of the cytochrome. This result raises questions as to why the AXXCH motif rarely and the CXXAH never occurs in vivo. In the bacteria, as opposed to mitochondria, the AXXCH motif has never been reported, supporting the idea that the bacterial biogenesis machinery for a c-type cytochromes has co-evolved alongside the system for forming disulfide bonds (7Barker P.D. Ferguson S.J Structure. 1999; 7: R281-R290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This implies that the two cysteines of CXXCH may form a disulfide bond before heme is attached (7Barker P.D. Ferguson S.J Structure. 1999; 7: R281-R290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out using E. coli strain XL1-Blue from Stratagene. Cultures for protein expression were grown in 2TY medium (16 g/liter bacteriological peptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract, and 5 g/liter sodium chloride) in 2.5-liter flasks. Cultures were grown at 37 °C in an orbital incubator, shaking at 200 rpm. All other cultures were grown in LB. DNA was prepared using Promega Wizard minipreps. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by PerkinElmer Life Sciences and supplied to ReadyPure specifications. Mutagenesis was carried out by polymerase chain reaction, first using pKHC12, which contains the cytochromec552 gene without a periplasmic targeting sequence (11Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), as a template and oligonucleotides EJT3 (5′-GCATGAATTCATGAATGAACAGCTTGCCAAGCAAAAGGGCGCCATGGCTTGCCACGATCT-3′) and EJT5 (5′-CGTCAGAAGCTTTTACTTTATGGAGAGTATCC-3′). The resulting 250-base pair fragment was digested with EcoRI andHindIII and cloned into the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech expression vector pKK223-3 to yield pEST201, which has an AXXCH heme-binding motif and an introduced NcoI site at the first mutation site. Further polymerase chain reaction using pEST201 as the template and oligonucleotides EJT4 (5′-GCGCCATGGCTGCACACGATCTGAAAGCTAAGAAGG-3′) and EJT5 gave a fragment that was digested with NcoI and HindIII and cloned into pEST201. This gave pEST202, which contained mutations of both wild type cysteines to alanines. A final round of polymerase chain reaction used pEST202 as the template and oligonucleotides EJT10(5′-GCATGAATTCATGAATGAACAGCTTGCCAAGCAAAAGGGCTGTATGGCTGCACACGATCTG-3′) and EJT5. The resulting fragment was digested with EcoRI andHindIII and cloned into pKK223-3 to yield pEST203, which has a CXXAH heme-binding motif. All plasmids were sequenced to ensure that only the required mutations were present. 6 ml of an overnight culture of E. coli XL1-Blue containing a cytochrome expression plasmid in 2TY with 100 mg ml−1ampicillin was used to inoculate 600 ml of 2TY with 100 mg ml−1 ampicillin in a 2.5-liter flask. When the optical density of the culture at 550 nm had reached 0.8, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the culture was incubated for a further 6 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation. Expressed cytochrome was purified as described previously (13Mukai K. Wakabayashi S. Matsubara H J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1989; 106: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) using ion exchange chromatography on CM52 Sepharose followed by gel filtration using G50 Sephadex. The N-terminal amino acid sequences up to residue 16 were determined for each protein and shown to be correct. Protein concentrations were determined using the method of Bradford, and the theoretical extinction coefficient was at 280 nm. These were measured by equilibrium potentiometry as described by Dutton (14Dutton P.L Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Visible spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda 2 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Pyridine hemochrome spectra were obtained according to the method of Bartsch (15Bartsch R.G Methods Enzymol. 1971; 23: 344-363Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism spectra were taken using a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter with a fused quartz cuvette of 1-mm pathlength and protein concentrations of 25–30 μm in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7. All spectra were recorded at 25 °C unless otherwise stated. Acid butanone extraction of heme was carried out according to the method of Teale (16Teale F.W. J Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 35: 543-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). Unfolding of proteins in guanidine hydrochloride was carried out by appropriate dilution of an 8 m stock solution before addition to concentrated protein solution, yielding a final protein concentration of 30 μm in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3. Samples were equilibrated at 25 °C for 2 h before spectra were measured. Wild type protein unfolding was monitored by the change in 419 nm for the oxidized form and 417 nm for the reduced form. Unfolding of the AXXCH and CXXAH proteins was monitored by the change in absorbance at 412 nm for the oxidized forms and 422 nm for the reduced forms. This facilitates following the unfolding ofc-type cytochromes as, because of the covalent attachment of the heme to the polypeptide, only the methionine ligand is lost, resulting in a red shifted Soret band of increased intensity (17Nall B.T. Landers T.A Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5403-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) rather than a loss of the Soret as for b-types. All solutions for unfolding studies under reduced conditions were degassed and, together with the cuvettes, flushed with argon. Determination of stability to pH was carried out by diluting a concentrated protein stock solution with a solution containing the following buffers to a final concentration of 10 mm each: acetate, HEPES, MES,2 CAPS, CHES, and Tris-HCl. The pH was adjusted with hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide as appropriate. Changes in the Soret region were monitored at 413 nm for the AXXCH and CXXAH proteins and 410 nm for the wild type cytochrome c 552. Expression from either plasmid pEST201 or plasmid pEST203 gave red cytoplasmic proteins, which after purification proved to have covalently attached heme and thus could be regarded asc-type cytochromes. A lower yield was obtained for the CXXAH protein (Table I). Also shown in Table I, for comparison, are the yields of the CXXCH and AXXAH proteins. Direct protein sequencing confirmed the presence of the AXXCH and CXXAH sequence motifs, respectively. Visible absorption spectra of the reduced forms of the two single cysteine proteins, with the wild type for comparison, are shown in Fig.1. Table IIshows that the α-band maxima were at 558 and 556 nm for the AXXCH and CXXAH proteins, respectively, but the pyridine hemochrome was at 553 nm for both proteins in contrast to 550 nm for the CXXCH protein (Table II). The 695 nm charge transfer band in the wild type, reflecting the methionine ligation of the iron, is also red shifted in both single alanine mutants (TableII). By comparison, the band is shifted to 720 nm in the AXXAH protein (Table II), similar to the value previously reported for cytochrome b562, which also has histidine/methionine coordination of the heme iron (18Moore G.R. Williams R.J. Peterson J. Thompson A.J. Mathews F.S Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 829: 83-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These spectroscopic characteristics for the single alanine derivatives of cytochrome c552 are very similar to those observed with forms of mitochondrial cytochrome c that have the AXXCH-binding motif (19Pettigrew G.W. Aviram I. Schejter A Biochem. J. 1975; 149: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The far UV CD spectra of the two single alanine mutants are essentially identical to that of the wild type protein as shown in Fig. 2. Measurement of CD spectra at 400–450 nm indicated that the heme had attached to the proteins in essentially one conformation. In neither case was the reduction potential affected more than 20 mV by the loss of one thioether bond (Table II).Table IYields of purified cytochromeYield of cytochromemg/literCXXCH5.6AXXCH8.5AXXAH6.0CXXAH2.2Relative amounts of cytochrome purified per liter of culture, grown for 8 h after induction.

Losses during purification were less than 5% of total cytochrome in each case. Comparison of reduction potentials and visible absorption spectra for oxidized, reduced, and pyridine hemochrome forms of cytochromec 552 and the heme binding site mutants. Samples of purified AXXCH protein analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained for heme showed small amounts of heme on the dye front. This could have been due to either degradation of the protein yielding a small heme-containing peptide or the presence of some noncovalently bound heme in the sample. A small percentage of noncovalently bound heme would not be readily detectable in the pyridine hemochrome spectrum. Acidified butanone was used to extract any b-type heme from purified samples of the holo proteins and the ratio of the reduced Soret maximum:absorbance at 280 nm compared before and after such treatment. Only the ratio ofA 422(red):A 280(ox) in the AXXCH mutant was changed, falling from 3.85 to 3.31. This result suggests that approximately 14% of the holo AXXCH cytochrome contained noncovalently attached heme. No heme could be extracted from the CXXAH mutant, demonstrating that the heme is 100% covalently attached to the polypeptide with this binding motif. It has previously been observed that the loss of two thioether bonds so as to generate a b-type cytochrome from cytochromec552 resulted in a substantial destabilization with respect to chemical and thermal denaturation (10Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Remarkably, both the proteins incorporating the single alanine substitutions were only slightly less stable than the native protein (see Fig. 4). In the case of thermal denaturation no change in visible absorption of the oxidized AXXCH or CXXAH proteins could be observed up to 70 °C, whereas in CD spectroscopy only at 90–95 °C was there evidence for partial unfolding (data not shown). These observations are identical to those for the wild type. The midpoints for guanidine hydrochloride induced unfolding are shown in Table III; the AXXCH protein was less stable in both the oxidized and reduced forms than the wild type or CXXAH protein. In contrast, the oxidized form of the CXXAH protein had similar stability to the wild type, whereas the reduced form was somewhat less stable. The CXXAH protein is also the only one of the four proteins (Table I) to show no alteration in the far UV CD spectrum on reduction; the wild type, AXXCH, and AXXAH proteins all showed increased α-helical content on reduction (data not shown).Table IIIMidpoints of guanidine hydrochloride induced unfoldingOxidized G1/2/mReduced G1/2/mCXXCH4.1Not fully unfolded in 7 mAXXCH2.63.5AXXAH0.51.4CXXAH3.44.5Values for the wild type and double alanine mutants of cytochromec 552 are included for comparison. Open table in a new tab Values for the wild type and double alanine mutants of cytochromec 552 are included for comparison. The stabilities of the two single alanine proteins to variations in pH were very similar to the wild type protein, with no change at high pH and significant unfolding only below pH 3. The CXXAH protein showed some decrease in the Soret absorbance between pH 4 and pH 3 (Fig. 3), thus distinguishing it from the other forms of the protein. The guanidine hydrochloride induced unfolding profiles for oxidized and reduced wild type and single alanine mutant proteins are shown in Fig.4 and the midpoints given in Table III. Both the wild type and CXXAH protein gave smooth unfolding profiles with good agreement between data obtained by visible absorption spectroscopy, using the change in the Soret or α-bands, and by CD spectroscopy, monitoring changes at 222 nm. This was not the case for the AXXCH protein, which is discussed below. At low guanidine hydrochloride concentrations (0–1.5 m) and before the start of the main unfolding transition, the oxidized AXXCH protein showed a 15% decrease in the intensity of the Soret band with no concomitant change in the α-band region. The unfolding of oxidized AXXCH monitored by CD spectroscopy showed no change over this range of guanidine hydrochloride concentration. The different unfolding profiles are illustrated in Fig. 5. Guanidine hydrochloride induced unfolding of the reduced AXXCH protein showed similar profiles when Soret and α-band changes were monitored, but these profiles indicated complex behavior. The α-band maxima of the reduced protein moved from 556 to 558 nm and increased in intensity, and the peak became symmetrical over the range of 0–2.6m guanidine hydrochloride (Fig.6). The Soret band intensity also increased over the same range.Figure 6The increase and blue shift in the α-band of reduced AXXCH protein in 0, 0.5, 1, 1.8, and 2 m guanidine hydrochloride. All samples contained 25 μm protein in 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The small changes in the oxidized visible spectra, which are not mirrored by changes in the CD spectra, may indicate subtle alterations in the heme environment at low denaturant concentrations. They were not seen for the wild type CXXCH or mutant AXXAH and CXXAH proteins and may be related to the small percentage of noncovalently attached heme. To date it has not been possible to prepare the AXXCH protein free of noncovalently bound heme. We have argued previously that the unusual formation of holoH. thermophilus cytochrome c552 in the cytoplasm of E. coli is a consequence of the apo form of the protein being able to adopt sufficient structure that noncovalent binding of heme is followed by spontaneous thioether bond formation. Recently, this view has been supported by the finding that ab-type cytochrome derivative of cytochromec552 can be formed in the E. colicytoplasm if the CXXCH heme-binding motif is changed to AXXAH (10Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It ought, therefore, to be possible to form the corresponding single cysteine variants in the cytoplasm, and this is confirmed in the present work. Just as in the case of the wild type CXXCH protein, it has not strictly been proved that the single cysteine proteins are formed completely spontaneously. For example, either the cysteines or the heme might in principle be modified in some way before the covalent attachment can occur. However, the possibility of a transient disulfide bond formation, in the cytoplasm and independent of the periplasmic cytochrome cbiogenesis apparatus, between the two cysteines of the CXXCH motif can now be largely disregarded, given the successful formation of the single cysteine derivatives. The fact that for the monocysteine proteins the heme is found in only one of the two possible orientations suggests that as for the wild type protein, any initial heme binding in the wrong orientation must be followed by dissociation and reassociation before covalent bond formation can occur. The present work also shows that in principle either of the thioether bonds can be formed first in the assembly of a c-type cytochrome. A second example of a c-type cytochrome that can form in the cytoplasm of E. coli is cytochromec552 from Thermus thermophilus. In this case a mixture of products is found. In the present context it is of interest that in one study (20Wittung-Stafshede P Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) but not in the other (21Keightley J.A. Sanders D. Todaro T.R. Pastuszyn A. Fee J.A J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12006-12016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), there was evidence for attachment to only one cysteine of the CXXCH motif. It is difficult to understand why the second thioether bond did not form. It has never before been possible to study the physicochemical effects of losing one thioether bond from a c-type cytochrome. Pettigrew (2Pettigrew G.W Nature. 1973; 241: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) measured the reduction potentials for the AXXCH species from Euglena gracilis andCrithidia oncopelti but could only compare them with horse heart cytochrome c. Thus, it could not be concluded with certainty that the relatively small changes in reduction potential seen for the AXXCH proteins reflected the loss of a thioether bond and/or compensations from differences in overall structure and heme environment between the protozoan AXXCH and horse heart cytochrome c proteins. In the present work we find that the loss of one thioether bond on going from CXXCH to AXXCH or CXXAH has only a small effect on the reduction potential. Although this could mean that the consequence of loss of the thioether bond is coincidentally balanced by other changes in the heme environment, the fact that the stability toward thermal and chemical denaturation is very similar for the CXXCH, AXXCH, and CXXAH proteins suggests, as do far UV CD spectra, that there is little change in overall structure. In turn this suggests that the larger change in reduction potential previously observed on going from the CXXCH to the AXXAH protein (10Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) may be substantially correlated with a general change in heme environment, correlating with the loss of stability toward thermal and chemical denaturation, rather than with the loss of the thioether bonds. Thus overall the results of our work suggest that the formation of thioether bonds in c-type cytochromes is not for the purpose of tuning reduction potential, as previously discussed by Barker and Ferguson (7Barker P.D. Ferguson S.J Structure. 1999; 7: R281-R290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). There seems to be no particular major disadvantage of the AXXCH species relative to the CXXCH. Broadly the same conclusion was drawn by Pettigrew et al. (19Pettigrew G.W. Aviram I. Schejter A Biochem. J. 1975; 149: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) in respect of the naturally occurring AXXCH protein inEuglena. We are left with the questions of why do some protozoa have the single cysteine attachment mode and why it apparently does not occur in vivo in bacteria? The answer to the latter may relate to the biogenesis mechanism in the latter, which seems to have evolved to involve the participation of a disulfide (22Page M.D. Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 103-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In the present work the CXXAH variant of H. thermophilus cytochrome c552 differs little from the wild type CXXCH protein. On the other hand, the AXXCH variant does show some differences, not only in being slightly less stable but also in having some tendency to distortion in the heme region. Thus, contrary to what has been observed in protozoan species, the present work suggests that CXXAH rather than AXXCH might occur naturally. However, the single cysteine variants of the cytochrome c552 studied here are artifacts, and no evolutionary selection elsewhere in the polypeptide has occurred to give enhanced stability. In this context it is notable that the known c 1 proteins with a single cysteine attachment all have the heme-binding motif FAPCH (6Priest J.W. Hajduk S.L J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20188-20195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the protozoan cytochromes c have AXQCH (1Pettigrew G.W. Moore G.R Cytochromes c: Evolutionary, Structural and Physicochemical Aspects. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990Google Scholar), suggesting some structural compensation for the loss of one heme-binding cysteine. Nevertheless, the Euglena cytochromec 558 was noted (19Pettigrew G.W. Aviram I. Schejter A Biochem. J. 1975; 149: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) to be subjected to a high spin transition on heating that is not normally observed under comparable conditions with the double cysteine proteins, indicative of a correlation between loss of a thioether bond and some decrease in overall stability. It is instructive to compare the present work in which the properties of CXXCH, AXXCH, CXXAH, and AXXAH variants of H. thermophilus cytochromec552 are described with that of Arnesanoet al. (23Arnesano F. Banci L. Bertini I. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Woodyear T.D. Johnson C.M. Barker P.D Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1499-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), in which the consequences of introducing a thioether bond into the heme-binding site of cytochromeb562 were studied. The latter workers also found that introduction of the thioether bond conferred a significant extra stability toward denaturation by both heat and guanidine hydrochloride. Arguably, the widespread occurrence of heme attachment to two cysteines in a CXXCH motif in c-type cytochromes reflects an enhanced stability toward extreme conditions of pH and temperature that are not identified in the present work but that were present at an important stage in the evolution of c-type cytochromes.

Hammarstrom S. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4275-4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). While considerable interest has focused attention on the leukotriene pathway of arachidonate metabolism within cells, the initial 5-HpETE intermediate can also be converted into 5-HETE and further metabolized into 5-oxo-ETE by an NADP+-dependent dehydrogenase (6Powell W.S.

The discovery that 5-oxo-ETE is chemotactic for eosinophils, and to a lesser extent to the human polymorphonuclear leukocyte, has raised interest in this eicosanoid because of the suggested role of eosinophils in diseases such as asthma (8Butterfield J.H.

Since termination of biological activity of all eicosanoids is largely a result of metabolic conversion to inactive products, an understanding of metabolic pathways within biosynthetic cells and tissues of origin has been of interest. Previous metabolic studies of 5-oxo-ETE have suggested that cytochrome P450 dependent ω-oxidation in the neutrophil (15Powell W.S. Gravel S. Halwani F. Am. J. Respir. Crit.

We describe here that an alternative major route of 5-oxo-ETE biotransformation exists within a tissue-derived macrophage that results in a profoundly chemotactic eicosanoid. 5-Oxo-ETE and [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-2H8]5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (D8-5-HETE) were purchased from Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, MI).

Hanks' balanced salt solution was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Indo-1/AM was obtained from Calbiochem. NBD-phallicidin (N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)phallicidin) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All solvents were HPLC grade and obtained from Fisher. Elicited peritoneal macrophages were obtained from the peritoneal cavity of ICR mice following injection of 1 ml of thioglycolate (10%) into the peritoneum 3 days prior and cells isolated as described previously (17Fadok V.A. Savill J. Campbell P.A. Haslett C. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 4029-4035PubMed Google Scholar). After adherence of cells to plastic plates, the cells were gently suspended in 3 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution (1.3 × 107 cells). 5-Oxo-ETE, [2H7]5-oxo-ETE, and [3H7]5-oxo-ETE (0.6 μCi) were incubated with the cells at a concentration of 14 μm and with a D0/D7 ratio of the unlabeled substrate to stable isotope of 2:1. Incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 3 h followed by centrifugation and separation of metabolites present in the supernatant using solid phase extraction technique (18Wheelan P. Hankin J.A. Bilir B. Guenette D. Murphy R.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 288: 326-334PubMed Google Scholar). Reversed phase HPLC of the solid phase extracted metabolites was carried out using mobile phase A containing 8.3 mm acetic acid buffered to pH 5.7 with NH4OH and mobile phase B solvent B composed of acetonitrile:methanol (65:35, v/v) and a Columbus 5-μm C18 column 150 × 2.0 mm (Phenomenex, Rancho Pales Verdes, CA). HPLC effluent was monitored using a photodiode array detector and fractions collected at 1-min intervals from the column eluted at 200 μl/min with a linear gradient from 15% solvent B to 55% solvent B in 10 min to 80% solvent B in 25 min to 100% solvent B in 30 min and then held at 100% solvent B for a further 5 min. Chemotaxis of neutrophils and eosinophils were carried out in a Zigmond chamber (19Zigmond S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 162: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were adhered to a glass slide inverted over a bridge between two wells where the concentration gradient was formed. The movement of cells were monitored under a microscope with TV video taping when a field contained seven to nine cells. Analysis of direction and velocity graphically assessed at 3-min intervals for 30 min. The test solution containing either buffer or 5-oxo-ETE, FOG7, and fMLP in one well of the chamber at the concentrations indicated and six to seven individual cells were monitored. Selection of cells for vector analysis only required that the cells remain in the field of view for the first 10 min of videotaping. Actin polymerization was assessed by flow cytometry as described previously (20Howard T.H. Oresajo C.O. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Neutrophils or eosinophils were incubated with the test compound for 30 s, and cells were then fixed with lysoformalin for 5 min at 37 °C. NBD-phallicidin was added to the fixed cells for 10 min at 37 °C prior to flow cytometry. A control experiment was run without test substance present for background fluorescence binding. Intracellular cytosolic calcium was assessed by incubation of neutrophils (107 cells/ml) loaded with the acetoxymethyl ester of Indo-1 as described previously (21Grynkiewicz G.M. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Before the addition of each test substance, CaCl2 and MgCl2 were added to the cell suspensions at 1 mm final concentration to 3 × 106 neutrophils in a 4-ml cuvette. The Kd of 250 nm for the Indo-1 Ca2+ complex was used to calculate the intracellular calcium concentration and a Fmax determined by the addition of digitonin at 0.1%, and Fmin was determined by the addition of 7.8 mm EGTA in Tris buffer. Addition of glutathione (2 mm) to 5-oxo-ETE (10 μm) was carried out at pH 9.5 aqueous buffer for 4 h at 37 °C. Reversed phase HPLC purification and LC/MS and LC/MS/MS analysis was carried out using identical conditions described above. The most abundant eicosanoid backbone cleavage ion occurred at m/z 348 corresponding to cleavage between carbon atoms 9 and 10. This 1,6 Michael addition product also had a UV spectrum with absorption maximum at 262 nm consistent with α/β-unsaturated ketone (22Blackburn M.L. Ketterer B. Meyer D.J. Juett A.M. Bull A.W. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1364-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Direct liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry was carried out on a Sciex API-III+ triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (PE-Sciex, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada). A 1.0 x 150-mm Ultramex-3 C18 reversed phase HPLC column (Phenomenex) was used with the same gradient solvent system for the metabolite separation, but at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. A mass range of m/z 172–700 was scanned at the rate of 3 s/scan with a spray voltage of −2800 volts and orifice voltage maintained at −50 volts with a collisional offset potential of 15 eV. Collision-induced decomposition (CID) was performed with a collision gas thickness (argon) of 150 × 1013 molecules/cm2. To learn more about the metabolism of 5-oxo-ETE in tissues, murine peritoneal macrophages were incubated with 5-oxo-ETE containing both radiolabeled and stable isotope labeled tracers. Following incubation at 37 °C for 3 h, metabolites were separated by reversed phase HPLC and fractions collected to assess elution of radiolabeled metabolites. Several metabolites were observed (Fig.1 A) including several minor metabolites which retained UV chromophores. The structures of these metabolites will be described separately. However, the most abundant metabolite did not absorb light in the UV region and yielded a molecular anion [M − H]− at m/z 624 by negative ion electrospray LC/MS. Metabolism of the stable isotope labeled D7-5-oxo-ETE yielded a corresponding [M − H]− anion at m/z 630 indicating the retention of only six deuterium atoms, suggesting loss of a single deuterium atom during the biochemical conversion. Collisional activation of metabolite A following negative ion electrospray ionization yielded an abundant product ion (Fig. 1 A, inset) at m/z306, consistent with the addition of glutathione to 5-oxo-ETE by a Michael addition reaction (18Wheelan P. Hankin J.A. Bilir B. Guenette D. Murphy R.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 288: 326-334PubMed Google Scholar, 22Blackburn M.L. Ketterer B. Meyer D.J. Juett A.M. Bull A.W. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1364-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 23Raftery M.J. Thorne C.G. Orkiszewski R.S. Gaskell S.J. Biomed. Environ. Mass Spectrom. 1990; 19: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To assess the position of glutathione covalent attachment on the 5-oxo-ETE backbone, this metabolite was analyzed by positive ion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using an ion trap mass spectrometer. Collisional activation of the [M + H]+cation at m/z 626 yielded an abundant product ion at m/z 497, which corresponded to the loss of the γ-glutamyl portion of the glutathione adduct. This product ion has been observed in the collisional activation of other glutathione adducts of arachidonic acid. Subsequent collisional activation of m/z497, which was possible in the ion trap mass spectrometer as an MS3 experiment, yielded an exceptionally rich product ion spectra as shown in Fig. 1 B. Abundant ions were observed corresponding to cleavage of the carbon-sulfur bond with product ions m/z 319 and 179, consistent with a cysteinyl glycine adduct. The product ion at m/z 367 was particularly relevant, since it corresponded precisely to cleavage of the arachidonate carbon backbone between carbon 6 and 7. This fragmentation would be expected if a carbon-sulfur thioether bond was formed at carbon 7, which would facilitate formation of a delocalized carbonium ion and loss of the first six carbon atoms of arachidonic acid. This MS3collisional spectrum was consistent with the addition of glutathione to 5-oxo-ETE in a 1,4 Michael addition reaction. Comparison of chromatographic and mass spectral data of this metabolite with the nonenzymatically synthesized 1,6 Michael addition product of glutathione to 5-oxo-ETE as well as the isobaric eicosanoid, LTC4, clearly revealed that the 5-oxo-ETE metabolite was a novel glutathione adduct of 5-oxo-ETE. Thus, the most abundant metabolite of 5-oxo-ETE made by the murine peritoneal macrophage corresponded to the compound 5-oxo-7-glutathionyl-8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid, which we abbreviate as FOG7 (SchemeFS1). A curious feature of this 5-oxo-ETE metabolite was that it is isobaric to LTC4, both having a molecular mass of 625 daltons. In general, the glutathione conjugation of reactive chemical entities such as dieneones is a mechanism to reduce the potential cellular toxicity of such agents (24Talalay P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1989; 28: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, in the case of LTA4, this leads to the formation of a potent biologically active substance LTC4 (5Murphy R.C. Hammarstrom S. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4275-4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to investigate whether or not this novel glutathione adduct of 5-oxo-ETE was also biologically active. The ability of the metabolite to induce neutrophil and eosinophil chemotaxis was tested using a Zigmond chamber that could assess both chemotaxis and chemokinesis over a concentration gradient (19Zigmond S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 162: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). When eosinophils were present in the chemotactic chamber (Fig. 2 A), both 5-oxo-ETE and FOG7 at concentrations of 10 nm and 100 nm induced cellular movement toward each respective chemotactic agent as compared with buffer control. Neutrophils were also found to be chemotactic for FOG7 at 10 nm, similar to that observed for 5-oxo-ETE (Fig. 2 B). Calculation of the velocity of cellular migration (TableI) revealed that FOG7 was more potent than 5-oxo-ETE in chemotactic velocity. Significantly, FOG7 retained the chemotactic and chemokinetic activities of the metabolic precursor 5-oxo-ETE, revealing that processing by this pathway did not lead to inactivation of chemotactic properties of 5-oxo-ETE.Table IChemotaxis parameters for human eosinophils and human neutrophils exposed to 5-oxo-ETE, FOG 7 , and fMLP in a Zigmond chamber (19Zigmond S.H.

The biological activity of FOG7 was also compared with 5-oxo-ETE and fMLP for inducing actin polymerization in the human polymorphonuclear leukocyte. Using NBD-phallicidin to assess formation of F-actin (20Howard T.H. Oresajo C.O. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), eosinophils or neutrophils were incubated for 30 s following fixation and analyzed by flow cytometry. Actin polymerization in neutrophils was induced by fMLP as expected. 5-Oxo-ETE as well as FOG7 also elicited a significant shift in fluorescence, indicating the rapid formation of F-actin (Fig.3). Eosinophils yielded similar results (data not shown). These data supported the chemotaxis data by showing that FOG7 was able to polymerize actin in both neutrophils and eosinophils. Another reported activity of 5-oxo-ETE was the elevation of intracellular calcium in both neutrophils or eosinophils as assessed using Indo-1/AM fluorescence (21Grynkiewicz G.M. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). As shown previously, 5-oxo-ETE (10 nm) (12Czech W. Barbisch M. Tenscher K. Schöpf E. Schröder J.-M. Norgauer J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 108-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) as well as fMLP (10 nm) (25Gelfand E.W. Cheung R.K. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11520-11523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) induced in a dose-dependent manner, a significant elevation of intracellular calcium ion in the human neutrophil (Fig.4). However, FOG7 did not induce calcium mobilization in the neutrophil, even at concentrations as high as 320 nm. A similar lack of response was observed for eosinophils loaded with Indo-1/AM. The 5-oxo-ETE glutathione adduct was thus not effective in elevating intracellular calcium ion as opposed to the parent 5-oxo-ETE. Since 5-oxo-ETE may activate more than one receptor (11O'Flaherty J.T. Cordes J. Redman J. Thomas M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 13O'Flaherty J.T. Taylor J.S. Kuroki M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3345-3352Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 26Powell W.S. Gravel S. MacLeod R.J. Mills E. Hashefi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9280-9286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that FOG7could signal only through a subset of these receptors. More likely, however, these two eicosanoids may exert their effects through separate receptors. Together, these results indicated that a major route of 5-oxo-ETE processing in the peritoneal macrophage was through conjugation with glutathione in a 1,4 Michael addition reaction even though the 1,6-adduct was the more likely product. While this metabolic process may reduce the chemical reactivity of 5-oxo-ETE, it nonetheless did not terminate the biological activity of this eicosanoid. Rather the glutathione adduct, FOG7, was profoundly active in eliciting chemotaxis and chemokinesis of both the human neutrophil and eosinophil. There is, furthermore, a striking biochemical parallel in the formation of this glutathione adduct of 5-oxo-ETE and the glutathione adduct of LTA4 termed LTC4. Both conjugation reactions result in the formation of the only known glutathione adducts which are biologically active. Conjugation of glutathione profoundly alters both chemical and biochemical properties of precursor eicosanoids as well as subsequent metabolic decomposition reactions. This is particularly true in chemical partition properties of these glutathione adducts. Both precursor eicosanoids, LTA4 and 5-oxo-ETE, are highly lipophilic and likely have difficulty in exiting synthetic cells without the assistance of carrier protein substances to promote movement from the lipid-membrane environment. The attachment of a hydrophilic tripeptide (glutathione) to these substances alters this substantially. In this respect, glutathione conjugation of a reactive eicosanoid intermediate, as exemplified by LTC4 and FOG7, may be a mechanism by which cells can alter distribution of biologically active eicosanoids, direct their actions to specific tissue targets, and possibly prolong efficacy in vivo."

This gene has been previously identified as a regulator of the cell cycle and involved in nitrogen sensing. It is shown that the transcription levels ofSIT4 are induced by low concentrations of Li+in a time-dependent manner. Na+ and K+ at high concentrations, but not sorbitol, also induce transcription. As a response to Na+ or Li+stress, yeast cells lower the intracellular K+ content. This effect is enhanced in cells overexpressing SIT4, which also increase 86Rb efflux after the addition of Na+ or Li+ to the extracellular medium. Another feature of SIT4-overexpressing cells is that they maintain a more alkaline pH of 6.64 compared with 6.17 in the wild type cells. It has been proposed that the main pathway of salt tolerance in yeast is mediated by a P-type ATPase, encoded by PMR2A/ENA1. However, our results show that in a sit4 strain, expression of ENA1 is still induced by monovalent cations, and overexpression of SIT4 does not alter the amount ofENA1 transcript. These results show that SIT4acts in a parallel pathway not involving induction of transcription ofENA1 and suggest a novel function for SIT4 in response to salt stress.

Its antimanic and antidepressant effects require days to weeks to appear, and several reports indicate that chronic administration of lithium affects gene expression (3Manji H.K. Potter W.Z. Lenox R.H. Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 1995; 52: 531-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In this work we have used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an eukaryotic cell model to study new possible targets of lithium action. Homeostasis of Li+ in yeast is maintained by multiple transport pathways that also transport Na+. The route of entry of both cations has not been clearly defined. It has been proposed to be through the K+ transporter Trk1p (4Gómez M.J. Luyten K. Ramos J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 135: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). When yeast cells are subjected to Na+ stress, its uptake is inhibited by increasing K+ import through Trk1p. However, this does not inhibit completely Na+ entry (4Gómez M.J. Luyten K. Ramos J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 135: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 5Mulet J.M. Leube M.P. Kron S.J. Rios G. Fink G.R. Serrano R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3328-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Two transport systems pump out Na+ that has entered the cell as follows: a cluster of up to five P-ATPases PMR2A/ENA1-4 (6Haro R. Garcı́adeblas B. Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 7Wieland J. Nitsche A.M. Strayle J. Steiner H. Rudolph H.K.

From the cluster of P-ATPases, Ena1p is the most highly expressed (6Haro R. Garcı́adeblas B. Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 7Wieland J. Nitsche A.M. Strayle J. Steiner H. Rudolph H.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3870-3882Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). These two transport systems are differently regulated. ENA1 is induced by osmotic stress, starvation, or high extracellular pH (10Garcı́adeblas B. Rubio F. Quintero F.J. Bañuelos M.A. Haro R. Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). NHA1 increases sodium and lithium tolerance at an acidic or neutral pH of the external medium (11Bañuelos M.A. Sychrová H. Bleykasten-Grosshans C. Souciet J.L. Potier S. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2749-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The expression of PMR2A/ENA1 is regulated by several protein phosphatases and kinases. Deletion of the genesPPZ1 and PPZ2 coding for protein phosphatases increases expression of ENA1 (12Posas F. Camps M. Arino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13036-13041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), whose expression, on the contrary, is reduced by the deletion of the protein phosphatase calcineurin, causing hypersensitivity to sodium and high accumulation of lithium (13Mendoza I. Rubio F. Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8792-8796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of a protein encoded bySIS2/HAL3 suppresses salt sensitivity in a calcineurin-deleted strain and stimulates transcription of thePMR2A/ENA1 gene (14Ferrando A. Kron S.J. Rı́os G. Fink G.R. Serrano R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5470-5481Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Hal3p acts as an inhibitory subunit of Ppz1p regulating its function on salt tolerance (15de Nadal E. Clolet J. Posas F. Serrano R. Gomez N. Ariño J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Yeast. 1991; 7: 651-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and YJL165c/HAL5 causes salt and pH sensitivity apparently as a result of deficient Trk1p and Trk2p activation (5Mulet J.M. Leube M.P. Kron S.J. Rios G. Fink G.R. Serrano R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3328-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Other regulatory pathways of ion homeostasis, which do not regulate expression of ENA1, have recently been described. A mutant strain lacking the transcriptional activator Imp2p was described as being hypersensitive to a variety of oxidative agents and also to Na+ and Li+. Imp2p does not increasesENA1 expression (17Masson J.Y. Ramotar D. Genetics. 1998; 149: 893-901PubMed Google Scholar). In this work we have searched for proteins that when overexpressed confer lithium tolerance to S. cerevisiae. We have identified SIT4, a type 2A/type 2A-related protein phosphatase, involved in the cell cycle. SIT4 is required for the late G1 expression of cyclins and transcription factors essential for the execution of START and is also required for bud emergence (18Arndt K.T. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1989; 56: 527-537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 19Sutton A. Immanuel D. Arndt K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2133-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). SIT4 is also involved in the response to nitrogen starvation by controlling the ceramide-induced Tor-signaling pathways (20Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T.N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 21Jiang Y. Broach J.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2782-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 22Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). In this work we have assigned a novel function to this protein. We demonstrate that its transcription is induced by monovalent cations and that it affects K+homeostasis and cytoplasmic pH when overexpressed. Escherichia coli strainXL1-Blue was used for plasmid construction. S. cerevisiae strains R757 (MATa, his4-15, ura3-52, lys9, hol1) and FY833 (MATa, his3Δ200, ura3-52, leu2Δ1, lys2Δ202, trp1Δ63, GAL2+ ), kindly provided by Dr. M. Ghislain, were used. Wild type strain R757 was transformed with an expression cDNA library under control of a galactose-inducible promoter (23Liu H. Krizek J. Bretscher A. Genetics. 1992; 132: 665-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformed cells were plated in minimal medium (YNB-gal) containing YNB 6.7 g/liter, galactose 2%, His, Ura, Lys, and methionine 0.003% and 30 mm LiSO4. Only six recombinants expressing a protein conferring lithium resistance were able to overcome the lithium stress. The plasmid from the selected colonies was isolated, and the DNA insert was subcloned in pBlueScript SK+ and sequenced using AutoRead Sequencing Kit and ALF DNA Sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The sequence was compared with the known open reading frames from the SGData base. The DNA insert of the selected clone was subcloned in the expression vector pRN93 (kindly donated by Dr. C.W. Slayman from Yale University), which contains a GAL4 promoter. This plasmid was named pRN93-SIT4. Both pRN93 and pRN93-SIT4 were used to transform strain FY833 by the lithium acetate method (24Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of the entire coding region of SIT4 in FY833 strain was carried out using the one-step gene replacement using the HIS3MX6 module (25Wach A. Brachat A. Pohelmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA from selected sit4 strain was examined for disruption by PCR1 and Southern blot analysis. The relative quantity of mRNA was determined by quantitative RT-PCR. Quantitative PCR analyses have been used to study mRNA levels for different transcripts (26Chelly J. Kaplan J.C. Maire P. Gautron S. Kahn A. Nature. 1988; 333: 858-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 27Wang A.M. Doyle M.V. Mark D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9717-9721Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown in the indicated media to exponential phase and harvested. 10 μg of total RNA (28Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar) were treated with 2.5 units of DNase I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 10 min at 37 °C and further incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. First strand cDNA was synthesized using the First Strand cDNA synthesis kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and oligonucleotide NotI-(dT)18 was used as primer. The cDNA was diluted 40 times. PCRs were performed with 2.5 μl of the diluted cDNA, 1.25 units of Taqpolymerase, 0.2 mm dNTP, 0.5 μm of each primer, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2 in a total volume of 25 μl. cDNA was amplified using the PCR program: 95 °C, 1 min; 53 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 2 min; and a final step of 72 °C for 5 min. The primers used were as follows: ACT1f, 5′TACGTTTCCATCCAAGCCGTT3′; ACT1r, 5′AACATACGCGCACAAAAGCAGA3′; SIT4f, 5′CGGGATCCATGCCTTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCTGTATCTAGAGGCCCCGACGAA3′; SIT4r, 5′CGGAATTCTTATAAGAAATAGCCGGCTCT3′; ENA1f, 5′AATTTTCGATGGGCGAAGGA3′; and ENA1r, 5′ACCGACCTTCACCAGACAAAT3′. The amplification of ACT1 mRNA was exponential between 17 and 22 cycles, SIT4 between 23 and 29 cycles, andENA1 between 22 and 28 cycles. The optimal parameters used for the PCR in our conditions were 20 cycles for ACT1, 25 for SIT4, and 25 for ENA1. The amplified DNA samples were separated on a 1.2% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed. The DNA was quantified by scanning the photograph using the Quantiscan software from Biosoft. Relative quantities of SIT4 and ENA1 transcripts were calculated by using ACT1 PCR product as an internal standard. Yeast cells were grown in minimal medium (YNB-gal) to exponential phase (A 600 nm 0.8–1.0) and harvested. Cells were washed once with water and resuspended to a concentration of 0.5 g of cells per ml of water. Yeast cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. 50 mg of cells (wet weight) were diluted in 1 ml of a medium containing 10 mm MES buffer (pH 6.0) and the indicated concentrations of NaCl or LiCl. After the indicated time cells were harvested immediately and resuspended at 4 °C in 1 ml of 20 mm MgCl2 and sorbitol to the same osmolarity as the incubation medium. Cells were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min two times in this medium. Yeast cells were broken with 2 mmcetyltrimethylammonium bromide for 10 min at room temperature and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 2 min. The supernatant was diluted 1:10 in distilled water and analyzed in a flame photometer. Intracellular pH was determined as described previously (29Peña A. Ramı́rez J. Rosas G. Calahorra M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown in minimal medium with galactose (YNB-gal) to the exponential phase (A 600 nm 1.0–1.4) and harvested. Cells were washed twice with water and incubated for 18 h at 4 °C with agitation in 50 mm86RbCl (270 cpm/nmol) at concentration of 0.1 g of cells per ml. Afterward cells were washed twice with water and resuspended to a concentration of 0.5 g of cells/ml. 86RbCl-loaded cells (100 mg) were incubated in 1 ml of a medium containing 10 mmMES-triethanolamine buffer (pH 6.0) and 500 mm NaCl or 500 mm LiCl. At the indicated time a sample of 100 μl was collected by vacuum filtration through a 0.45-μm pore size nitrocellulose filter (Millipore HAWP) and washed with 10 ml of 100 mm KCl by filtration. Filters were dried and transferred to a scintillation mixture, and radioactivity was monitored in a scintillation counter. Changes in membrane potential were estimated with the fluorescent dye dithiocarbocyanine (DiSC3(3)) (30Peña A. Uribe S. Pardo J.P. Borbolla M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 231: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 31Peña A. Ramı́rez J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1068: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), obtained from Molecular Probes. The fluorescence of the molecule at a concentration of 0.25 μm was recorded at room temperature at 540–600 nm in a spectrofluorometer with a magnetic stirrer in the sample compartment. Plasma membrane of S. cerevisiaeand the vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity were measured as described (32Masuda C.A. Montero-Lomelı́ M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 78: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae cells are able to adapt to a salt stress in a medium containing glucose as the carbon source. However, tolerance diminished when grown on galactose (Fig.1). For strains R757 and FY833 the Li+ lethal growth dosage was 250 mm in glucose, and in galactose medium it was 30 mm. We took advantage of this observation and screened an expression cDNA library under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter for clones that conferred lithium resistance in YNB galactose medium. Among six lithium-tolerant clones from R757 strain, we identified the gene SIT4. This gene is involved in progression of the cell cycle from G1into S phase (19Sutton A. Immanuel D. Arndt K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2133-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). It encodes the catalytic subunit of a serine-threonine protein phosphatase (19Sutton A. Immanuel D. Arndt K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2133-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) with homology to the Ser/Thr protein phosphatase PP6 from mammalian cells (33Bastians H. Ponstingl H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2865-2874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We isolated the open reading frame SIT4 from the library plasmid and subcloned it into plasmid pRN93 under control of the galactose promoter that was used to transform another wild type strain named FY833. As shown in Fig.2 A, overexpressedSIT4 also conferred resistance to lithium in this different strain. A characteristic effect of Li+ is that at sublethal concentrations growth is arrested after the first duplication. After a period of adaptation of about 10 h cells recover growth. This growth arrest was not seen when SIT4 was overexpressed (Fig.2 B). The entire coding region of SIT4 was deleted to abolish protein activity. Previous results showed that deletion causes a slow growth phenotype and larger cells (19Sutton A. Immanuel D. Arndt K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2133-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Our results showed thatsit4 strain was able to grow on galactose, provided that rich medium was used. The sit4 strain did not grow in galactose nitrogen base minimal media. We tested if sit4strain was able to adapt to Li+ stress. In contrast to overexpression, sit4 strain (Fig. 2 B) recovered growth after the arrest period induced by lithium. This result indicates that SIT4 is not essential for Li+adaptation, and other genes might perform overlapping functions in response to lithium stress. In Fig. 2 C we show the results of comparing the growth rate of the wild type, sit4-deleted cells and SIT4-overexpressing cells in the presence of different LiCl concentrations after the arrest period induced by Li+. We found that the latter is more resistant to Li+. It is interesting that resistance induced by overexpression of SIT4 was specific for Li+, as overexpression did not increase tolerance to Na+, K+, sucrose, or sorbitol (data not shown). SIT4 is situated on chromosome IV. Its intergenic region contains 1558 base pairs, and a preliminary analysis of this region for putative consensus with the STRE sequence shows that it contains six STRE elements. This element mediates the activation of transcription in response to a wide type of stresses such as osmotic stress, heat shock, nitrogen starvation, oxidative stress, low external pH, and ethanol stress. Some of these responses are dependent on the high osmolarity glycerol pathway, but some are independent (34Varela J.C.S. Mager W.H. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 721-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We investigated whether SIT4 expression was induced by different monovalent cations. SIT4 was found to have a very low basal level of expression, and it was induced upon a stress by Li+, Na+, K+, and to a lesser degree by sorbitol (Fig. 3 A). In order to test the dependence on sublethal concentrations of LiCl, we measured SIT4 induction in 15 mm LiCl. A 2-fold induction was observed after 5 h of Li+ stress (Fig.3 C). This time period correlates with the arrest period of growth. These results suggest that overexpression of SIT4might be a physiological response to salt stress, and further work on the SIT4 promoter is required to identify the motifs that are responsible for induction of expression by salt. One of the main proteins controlling Na+/Li+ resistance is the P-type ATPase encoded by PMR2A/ENA1. The level of PMR2A/ENA1transcription is modulated by a variety of phosphatases, and its promoter has been well studied (35Proft M. Serrano R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, Aand B, the levels of PMR2A/ENA1 transcript were induced by Li+, Na+, K+, and to a lower extent by sorbitol. These results agree with published results (6Haro R. Garcı́adeblas B. Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 7Wieland J. Nitsche A.M. Strayle J. Steiner H. Rudolph H.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3870-3882Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 36Marquez J.A. Serrano R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The comparison of A and B show thatSIT4 and PMR2A/ENA1 are concomitantly induced. With the aim to investigate whether SIT4 is a part of the mechanism by which PMR2A/ENA1 is induced, we measured by RT-PCR the relative quantity of PMR2A/ENA1 transcript on a strain where SIT4 is overexpressed and upon a Li+ or Na+ stress on a sit4 strain (Fig. 4). The relative quantity ofPMR2A/ENA1 transcript was not altered by overexpression ofSIT4 (Fig. 4 B). However,PMR2A/ENA1 transcription level is still induced after a shock with 0.8 m NaCl or 0.8 m LiCl on asit4 strain (Fig. 4 C). These results show that induction of PMR2A/ENA1 expression by Li+, Na+, and K+ is independent ofSIT4. When yeast cells are subjected to a Na+ stress they undergo accumulation of osmotically active solutes such as glycerol and trehalose (37Reed R.H. Chudek J.A. Foster R. Gadd G.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1987; 53: 2119-2123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Blomberg A. Adler L. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1087-1092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether overexpression ofSIT4 changes the intracellular concentrations of the monovalent cations K+, Na+, and Li+, we determined their concentration after incubation for 30 min with increasing concentrations of NaCl or LiCl. In Fig.5 we show the total monovalent cationic level; interestingly, overexpression of SIT4 leads to a lower intracellular accumulation of monovalent cations. The level of Na+ or Li+ uptake did not change under these conditions by overexpression of SIT4 as shown in Fig.6; however, the relative amount of K+ inside the cell was diminished in relation to control conditions. These results indicate that overexpression ofSIT4 causes a greater extrusion of K+ upon Na+ or Li+ stress and that a K+transport system might be involved. In order to test this hypothesis we measured 86Rb+ efflux in cells that had been previously starved and preloaded with 86RbCl. The results showed that in SIT4-overexpressing cells86Rb+ efflux in the presence of 500 mm NaCl or LiCl was highly increased (Fig.7). sit4 strain showed the same kinetics as the wild type strain (data not shown).Figure 6Effect of overexpression of SIT4on K+, Na+, and Li+ content under salt stress. FY833 (●), FY833-pRN93 (▴), and FY833-SIT4 (■) were incubated with increasing concentrations of NaCl or LiCl for 30 min. The relative amount of K+ and the total amount of Na+ or Li+ entry were calculated by determination of internal cation concentrations.

Data represent mean values and S.D. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We explored if the change on K+ homeostasis induced by overexpression of SIT4 could induce an alteration of the membrane potential or internal pH. We observed that overexpression ofSIT4 did not alter the changes in membrane potential produced by the addition of Na+ or Li+ (Fig.8), but the intracellular pH changed from 6.17 (±0.04) in wild type cells to 6.64 (±0.03) inSIT4-overexpressing cells. The sit4 strain did not show any significant alteration in pH as compared with the wild type strain. The alkalinization of the cytoplasm was not caused by an altered function of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase, since the specific activity of this enzyme in purified plasma membranes fromSIT4-overexpressing cells and wild type cells was the same (0.338 and 0.373 nmol/min/mg of protein at pH 5.5, respectively). Cellular processes are highly regulated by a wide variety of signal transduction pathways. Protein kinases and phosphatases mediate these events. SIT4 encodes a protein with homology to the catalytic subunits of mammalian PP6 protein phosphatases (33Bastians H. Ponstingl H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2865-2874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and regulates the cell cycle (19Sutton A. Immanuel D. Arndt K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2133-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Our sit4 strains are viable and show an increased abundance of unbudded cells (21Jiang Y. Broach J.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2782-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). However,sit4 is lethal in ssd1 (a gene of unknown function) deletant, whereas temperature-conditional alleles ofSIT4 arrest in G1 when shifted to the nonpermissive temperature (19Sutton A. Immanuel D. Arndt K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2133-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). It has been recently reported thatsit4 mutants of the yeast Kluyveromyces lactisregulate drug resistance (39Chen X.J. Bauer B.E. Kuchler K. Clark-Walker G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14865-14872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In this work we demonstrate for the first time that SIT4 plays a role in monovalent cation homeostasis. Our results show that growth was arrested by sublethal Li+ concentrations, but after an adaptation period wild type cells were able to recover growth. Diverse regulatory mechanisms must be turned on during the period of adaptation to Li+stress. Our results point out that induction of expression ofSIT4 is a regulatory mechanism, because on overexpression, lithium did not cause this growth arrest. This idea is reinforced by the fact that SIT4 transcript is induced by low lithium concentrations and that its time-dependent expression correlates with the arrest period induced by lithium. The results obtained with overexpression of SIT4 might represent physiological changes during adaptation to Li+ stress. ENA1is a P-type ATPase that has been proved to be involved in the main pathway of Na+/Li+ tolerance (6Haro R. Garcı́adeblas B. Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 7Wieland J. Nitsche A.M. Strayle J. Steiner H. Rudolph H.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3870-3882Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). A link has been suggested between SIT4 and ENA1, mediated bySIS2/HAL3. Ferrando et al. (14Ferrando A. Kron S.J. Rı́os G. Fink G.R. Serrano R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5470-5481Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) reported thatSIS2/HAL3 suppressed salt sensitivity in a calcineurin-deleted background by stimulating transcription of thePMR2A/ENA1 gene. On the other hand, SIS2/HAL3 is also a suppressor of the lethal sit4-ssd1 phenotype described above (19Sutton A. Immanuel D. Arndt K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2133-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). These results led us to test if SIT4was essential for PMR2A/ENA1 induction of transcription. We found that overexpression of SIT4 did not mimic the effect of SIS2/HAL3 as it does not increase PMR2A/ENA1expression. We have also shown that PMR2A/ENA1 is still induced by Na+ and Li+ in a sit4strain. These data indicate clearly that transcription ofENA1 is induced by salt in a pathway independent ofSIT4. To date the role of internal monovalent cations in cellular physiology is not known. K+ and Na+ regulate the activity of many enzymes, but the effect of altered monovalent cation homeostasis has not been studied. On the other hand, it has been shown that high extracellular K+ concentrations alleviate Na+/Li+ stress (5Mulet J.M. Leube M.P. Kron S.J. Rios G. Fink G.R. Serrano R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3328-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Upon Na+ stress yeast cells undergo accumulation of solutes to overcome turgor pressure (37Reed R.H. Chudek J.A. Foster R. Gadd G.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1987; 53: 2119-2123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Blomberg A. Adler L. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1087-1092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and also undergo an increase of intracellular Na+and a decrease of intracellular K+ (40Norkrans B. Kyklin A. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 100: 836-845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Sunder S. Singh A.J. Gill S. Singh B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 158: 121-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact thatSIT4 regulates total cation content upon an Na+or Li+ stress by lowering the intracellular content of K+ indicates that the regulation of homeostasis bySIT4 is mediated via a K+ efflux transporter. The increased K+ loss does not lead to a change of the electrical membrane potential, but it maintains the total monovalent cation content low after a Na+ or Li+ stress. One intriguing physiological response of overexpression ofSIT4 is the elevated cytoplasmic pH. Further work is necessary to test if this effect leads to altered K+homeostasis or if it is involved in another function regulated bySIT4, as cell cycle control (19Sutton A. Immanuel D. Arndt K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2133-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). However, it is possible that the efflux may proceed through one of the cation/H+exchange systems reported before (8Prior C. Potier S. Souciet J.L. Sychrová H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 42Ramı́rez J. Peña A. Montero-Lomelı́ M. Biochim. Biophys.

Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5860-5865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) Two homologs of SIT4 have been found in mammalian tissues. PP6 expression was preferentially found in the human testis, heart, and skeletal muscles, whereas in the mouse PPV was found in the brain (33Bastians H. Ponstingl H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2865-2874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our work in yeast leads to the proposal that the involvement of these mammalian genes during lithium treatment should be studied.

Two 150-mm dishes per condition were scraped into 700 μl of lysis buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 8 at 4 °C, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μm Na3VO4, 1 μm microcystin LR). Cells were lysed by incubation on ice for 30 min. Supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and precleared by incubation for 30 min with a 20-μl bed volume of Gamma Bind Plus-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HA-RSK2 and HA-RSK2/MK2 proteins were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C from precleared supernatant with 25 μg of 12CA5 antibody for 1 h. Gamma Bind Plus-Sepharose beads (30-μl bed volume) were incubated with the supernatant for 1 h on a Nutator rocker. The beads were pelleted by brief centrifugation, washed once with 500 μl of lysis buffer B, washed twice with 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, and then processed for Western analysis. BHK-21 (C-13) cells were transfected with 25 μg of pK3H·RSK2, pK3H·RSK2/MK2, pK3H, or pEFMYC·MAPKAPK2 as described previously (5Poteet-Smith C.E. Smith J.A. Lannigan D.A. Freed T.A. Sturgill T.W. J.

The cells were treated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for 30 min and NaCl (300 mm) for 15 min (or the appropriate vehicle) and were harvested as described. HA-tagged WT-RSK2 and RSK2/MK2 chimera were immunoprecipitated with 25 μg of 12CA5, and MYC-tagged WT-MAPKAPK2 was immunoprecipitated with 25 μg of 9E10 as described. The tagged proteins were eluted from the antibody by incubation with HA peptide (686 μm) or MYC peptide (629 μm) for 16 h in an Eppendorf Thermomixer at 4 °C with shaking at 1300 rpm. Eluted WT-RSK2, RSK2/MK2 chimera, or WT-MAPKAPK2 (3 μl) was incubated in kinase mix (47 μl; 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4, 3.75 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm MgCl2, 6 μm protein kinase A inhibitor peptide, 6 μm protein kinase C inhibitor peptide, 150 μm Na3VO4, 1 μm microcystin LR, 300 μm S6 peptide (RRRLSSLRA) for WT-RSK2 and RSK2/MK2 chimera or 75 μmglycogen synthase peptide (KKLNRTLSVA) for WT-MAPKAPK2, 150 μm ATP, and [γ-32P]ATP (∼2000 cpm/pmol)) at 30 °C for 10 min. Each assay was performed in triplicate. Phosphate incorporation into peptide substrate was determined using phosphocellulose P-81 paper as described previously (10Smith J.A. Poteet-Smith C.E. Malarkey K. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2893-2898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Duplicates of eluted proteins were processed for Western analysis with anti-HA or anti-MYC antibody. The intensity of each immunoblot band from numerous exposures of film was quantitated in the linear range of detection, and the relative amount of tagged protein was determined using NIH Image 1.61. Specific activity was normalized for the amount of immunoprecipitated protein (pmol/min/unit HA-tagged or MYC-tagged enzyme) and was plotted as percent increase in activation relative to basal kinase activity. BHK-21 (C-13) cells were co-transfected with 13 μg of HEGO DNA (estrogen receptor) and 13 μg of either pK3H·RSK2, pK3H·RSK2/MK2, pK3H·RSK2/MK2-K100A, or pK3H DNA as described. 45 h post-transfection, all cells were serum-deprived in the presence of 50 μm PD 98059, and a subset of cells was also treated with 10 μm SB 203580 or Me2SO (vehicle) for 3 h. Cells were then treated with NaCl (300 mm) or vehicle for 15 min. Two 150-mm dishes per condition were scraped into 700 μl of lysis buffer C (50 mm Tris, pH 8 at 25 °C, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm NaF, 10 mm Na2MoO4, 2 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol, 2 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm microcystin LR, and 100 units/ml DNase). Cells were lysed as above. Supernatant was clarified and precleared as above. The ER was immunoprecipitated at 4 °C from precleared supernatant with anti-ER (EVG α78) antibody for 1 h. Gamma Bind Plus-Sepharose beads (30-μl bed volume) were incubated with the supernatant for 1 h on a Nutator rocker. The beads were pelleted by brief centrifugation and washed three times with 1 ml of wash buffer 1 (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2 at 25 °C, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, 10 mm Na2MoO4, 1 mmNa3VO4, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol, and 1 μm microcystin LR) and once with 1 ml of wash buffer 2 (10 mm Tris, pH 7.2 at 25 °C, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10% glycerol, and 1 μmmicrocystin LR). The samples were electrophoresed on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, processed for Western analysis, and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-Ser-167 ER antibody. To determine whether the putative docking sites interact with MAPK, GST fusion proteins containing the identified regions of MSK1/2, MNK1/2, and MAPKAPK2 (Fig. 2 A) were incubated with kinase-defective ERK2 (K52R) or inactive p38 MAPK. The isolated carboxyl-terminal tails of the MAPKAPKs formed complexes with MAPK (Fig. 2 B), whereas a GST fusion protein containing a randomized RSK1 ERK docking site, RSK1-(RANDOM), and a GST fusion protein containing the carboxyl-terminal tail of RSK1 lacking the ERK docking site, RSK1-(672–715), did not interact with either ERK or p38 MAPK. The data indicate that these regions of the MAPKAPKs are indeed interaction sites for the upstream activators. RSK1-(716–735) specifically interacts with ERK (10Smith J.A. Poteet-Smith C.E. Malarkey K. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2893-2898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that MAPKAPK2-(377–400) and MSK1-(734–750) specifically interacted with p38 MAPK, whereas MSK2-(721–737), MNK1-(385–415), and MNK2-(385–412) interacted with both ERK and p38 MAPK. Thus, the isolated MAPK docking sites demonstrate a similar specificity for ERK or p38 MAPK as reported for the full-length proteins. MSK1 is activated by both ERK and p38 MAPK (14Scimeca J.C. Nguyen T.T. Filloux C. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17369-17374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, under these conditions the isolated MSK1 MAPK docking site, MSK1-(734–750), did not interact with ERK in vitro. To examine whether the p38 MAPK docking site of MAPKAPK2 acts as a docking site in the context of a full-length protein, the carboxyl-terminal 23 amino acids of RSK2 were replaced with the carboxyl-terminal 35 amino acids of MAPKAPK2 containing the putative bipartite nuclear localization signal of MAPKAPK2 (RSK2/MK2 chimera) (Fig. 3 A). HA-tagged RSK2/MK2 chimera and WT-RSK2 were immunoprecipitated from BHK cells in which either ERK or p38 MAPK was co-expressed. The RSK2/MK2 chimera co-immunoprecipitated with p38 MAPK but not with ERK, whereas WT-RSK2 co-immunoprecipitated only with ERK (Fig. 3 B). One explanation for interaction of the chimera with p38 MAPK in vivo is that replacement of the RSK2 tail with that of MAPKAPK2 may result in co-localization of the chimera with p38 MAPK, whereas WT-RSK2 is co-localized with ERK. To address this question, purified His-tagged ERK and His-tagged p38 MAPK were combined and incubated with immunoprecipitated WT-RSK2 or RSK2/MK2 chimera. The chimera formed a complex only with p38 MAPK, whereas WT-RSK2 preferentially bound to ERK above levels observed with empty vector immunoprecipitates (Fig.3 C). Thus, replacing the carboxyl-terminal tail of RSK2 with that of MAPKAPK2 is sufficient to switch specificity for the upstream MAPK. Alignment of the MAPK docking sites of RSK2 and MAPKAPK2, which bind exclusively to ERK and p38, respectively, reveals a distinction in the number of contiguous basic amino acids. The RSK2 MAPK docking site contains two adjacent basic residues, whereas that of MAPKAPK2 contains five. Specificity for the upstream activator may be dictated by the number of contiguous basic amino acids within the MAPK docking sites such that the number of basic residues is inversely related to the affinity for ERK and directly related to the affinity for p38 MAPK. To address this question, the number of basic residues in the isolated MAPK docking site of MAPKAPK2 and RSK2 was decreased and increased, respectively, to determine whether specificity for the upstream activator could be altered (Fig.4 A). Reducing the number of basic residues in the p38 MAPK docking site of MAPKAPK2 to mimic the ERK docking site of RSK2 attenuated p38 MAPK binding (Fig.4 B). These data indicate the necessity of basic residues for interaction with p38 MAPK as has been reported for interaction of RSK with ERK (10Smith J.A. Poteet-Smith C.E. Malarkey K. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2893-2898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 11Gavin A.C. Nebreda A.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 281-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, the mutant p38 MAPK docking site of MAPKAPK2 did not interact with ERK (not shown). Therefore, whereas the basic residues are essential for interaction with the upstream activator, additional specificity determinants must exist within the isolated MAPK docking sites. However, the number of basic residues, in combination with the additional specificity determinants, may indeed be inversely proportional to ERK affinity because increasing the number of basic residues in the ERK docking site of RSK2 decreased the affinity for ERK (Fig. 4 B); as in the case of the mutant p38 MAPK docking site, mutation of the ERK docking site did not increase the affinity for p38 MAPK (not shown), supporting the role for additional determinants of specificity. To examine whether interaction between the RSK2/MK2 chimera, and p38 MAPK resulted in activation of the chimera in vivo, ectopically expressed WT-RSK2, RSK2/MK2 chimera and MAPKAPK2 were immunoprecipitated from BHK cells treated with inhibitors or stimulants of the MAPK pathways. The enzymes were eluted from the immune complex, and kinase activity toward S6 or MAPKAPK2 substrate peptides was measured. NaCl stimulation of the p38 pathway resulted in an ∼130% increase in RSK2/MK2 chimera activity compared with the activity observed when cells were treated with SB 203580, whereas WT-RSK2 activity was unchanged by NaCl treatment (Fig.5 A). SB 203580 is an ATP analog that specifically inhibits catalytic activity of p38 MAPK (15Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar) and eliminates activation of components downstream of p38 MAPK. SB 203580 pretreatment abrogated NaCl-stimulated activity of the RSK2/MK2 chimera (Fig. 5 A). The wild type MAPKAPK2 (WT-MAPKAPK2) control was also activated by NaCl, and this stimulation was inhibited by pretreatment with SB 203580 (not shown). Thus, a stress-activated kinase was created by replacing the carboxyl-terminal 23 amino acids of RSK2 with the carboxyl-terminal 35 amino acids of MAPKAPK2. S6 peptide kinase activity of WT-RSK2 from cells treated with EGF, which activates the ERK pathway, was ∼290% greater than that from cells treated with the MAPK-ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD 98059 (Fig.5 B). PD 98059 specifically inhibits activation of MEK1/2 (16Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar), the upstream activator of ERK, thereby reducing phosphorylation and activation of the downstream components. EGF treatment increased kinase activity of the immunoprecipitated RSK2/MK2 chimera by only 76% compared with that of RSK2/MK2 chimera immunoprecipitated from cells pretreated with PD 98059. However, this activity is likely due to cross-talk between the mitogen- and stress-activated pathways because EGF treatment also resulted in a 70% increase in WT-MAPKAPK2 activity (Fig. 5 B). The RSK2/MK2 chimera and WT-MAPKAPK2 EGF-stimulated activities were inhibited by pretreatment with PD 98059 (Fig. 5 B) but not by pretreatment with SB 203580 (not shown). Thus, replacing the carboxyl-terminal tail of RSK2 with that of MAPKAPK2 removes the enzyme from the ERK pathway. To examine whether expression of the RSK2/MK2 chimera resulted in p38 MAPK-regulated phosphorylation of a physiological RSK substrate, the α isoform of the human estrogen receptor (ERα) was co-expressed in BHK cells with either WT-RSK2 or RSK2/MK2 chimera. RSK phosphorylates Ser-167 of the ERα (17Joel P.B. Smith J. Sturgill T.W. Fisher T.L. Blenis J. Lannigan D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1978-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). A phospho-specific Ser-167 antibody revealed that overexpression of either RSK2/MK2 chimera or WT-RSK2 resulted in phosphorylation of ERα (Fig.6 A). ERα immunoprecipitated from NaCl-treated cells co-expressing the RSK2/MK2 chimera was phosphorylated 2.8-fold more on Ser-167 than ERα immunoprecipitated from SB 203580-treated cells co-expressing RSK2/MK2 chimera, whereas NaCl did not increase Ser-167 phosphorylation of ERα in cells co-expressing WT-RSK2 (Fig. 6 A). Pretreatment of cells co-expressing the RSK2/MK2 chimera and ERα with SB 203580 eliminated the NaCl-induced phosphorylation of Ser-167 (Fig. 6 A), indicating that in vivo phosphorylation of the RSK substrate by the RSK2/MK2 chimera is a p38 MAPK-regulated event. As stated above, the amino-terminal catalytic domain of RSK phosphorylates exogenous substrates. Mutation of the critical lysine (Lys-100) in the catalytic core to an alanine eliminates kinase activity. ERα immunoprecipitated from cells co-expressing the kinase-defective RSK2/MK2 chimera (K100A chimera) exhibited no Ser-167 phosphorylation (Fig. 6 B). Therefore, the p38-MAPK-regulated phosphorylation of ERα requires catalytic activity of the RSK2/MK2 chimera. These data indicate that the signaling pathway in which a MAPKAPK functionsin vivo is dictated by the MAPK docking site in the carboxyl-terminal tail of the MAPKAPK. Herein we demonstrate that specific MAPK docking sites are located in the carboxyl-terminal tails of the MAPKAPKs. Determinants for specificity of interaction with the upstream MAPK are contained within the isolated MAPK docking sites. Replacing the ERK docking site of RSK with the p38 MAPK docking site of MAPKAPK2 results in an enzyme that complexes with p38 MAPK instead of ERK in vivo, relocating the enzyme from the ERK pathway to the p38 MAPK pathway and creating a stress-activated kinase that phosphorylates a RSK substrate in vivo. Thus, complex formation of MAPKs with the MAPK docking site of the MAPKAPKs is a general feature important for specific regulation of these MAPK-targeted kinases in vivo and dictates the signal transduction pathway in which a MAPKAPK is involved. The MAPK docking site is not limited to MAPKAPKs. The transcription factor Elk-1 has overlapping but distinct interaction sites for ERK and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (18Yang S.H. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1740-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), and recently the tyrosine phosphatase PTP-SL was shown to contain a MAPK docking site (19Zúñiga A. Torres J. Ubeda J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21900-21907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In addition, specific docking sites are not limited to MAPKs. The retinoblastoma protein has a sequence similar to the MAPK docking sites that targets it as a substrate for the proline-directed cyclin-dependent kinase (20Adams P.D. Li X. Sellers W.R. Baker K.B. Leng X. Harper J.W. Taya Y. Kaelin W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1068-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Each of these interaction motifs is required for efficient phosphorylation of the substrate by the proline-directed kinases. Thus, it is clear that substrate specificity of the proline-directed kinases involves docking sites in the downstream targets that are distinct from the consensus phosphorylation sequence. In addition, docking sites may enable co-localization of a specific proline-directed kinase with a specific target in signaling complexes where they collaborate to elicit physiological responses of pathway activation. Upon the elucidation of the determinants for specificity of the docking sites, the amino acid sequence would be a useful tool for identifying novel substrates. We thank Dr. Ian G. Macara for critical review of the manuscript. We are indebted to Corky Harrison for excellent administrative support."

Antibodies to type I collagen and to the carboxyl terminus of α1or α2 chains inhibit chemotaxis. The chemoattractant is the propeptide trimer carboxyl-terminal to type I collagen, and its activity is lost upon reduction. These data illustrate a previously unknown function for the carboxyl-terminal trimer, possibly relevant in promoting endothelial cell migration and vascularization of tissues producing collagen type I. During the second phase of osteogenesis in vitro, rat osteoblasts secrete inducer(s) of chemotaxis and chemoinvasion of endothelial and tumor cells. We report here the characterization and purification from mature osteoblast conditioned medium of the agent chemotactic for endothelial cells. The chemoactive conditioned medium specifically induces directional migration of endothelial cells, not affecting the expression and activation of gelatinases, cell proliferation, and scattering.

During the formation of long bone, there is transformation of the perichondrium around the cartilage model to a periosteum with bone being laid down at the midshaft region. At the outer surface of the cartilage model, near its center, blood vessels invade the calcified cartilage that is eroded, opening up a marrow cavity. Epiphyseal growth cartilages are then established to promote endochondral ossification, and angiogenesis occurs at the growth plate. Vascularization in endochondral ossification of the growth plates has been shown to depend on the function of VEGF1 (1Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol.

We here report that products secreted by rat osteoblasts activate directional migration, specifically, in endothelial cells via a Go/Gi protein-dependent pathway. Chemotaxis requires the function of metalloproteinases 2 and 9 and of integrins α1, β1, and β3 and is inhibited in presence of the corresponding specific antibodies. We have purified the chemotactic agent for endothelial cells produced by rat osteoblasts as a 120-kDa protein and obtained from it two sequences that coincide with those of the α1 and α2 C-terminal chains of procollagen type I, starting from the NH2 terminus produced by the action of procollagen C-proteinase (also bone morphogenetic protein-1; Refs. 10Hojima Y.

Differentiation medium was Coon's modified F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Seromed, Italy), ascorbic acid (100 μg/ml), and β-glycerolphosphate (10 mm). Osteoblasts were metabolically labeled for 5 h in methionine and cysteine and serum-free medium with Tran35S-labeled amino acids (ICN) at 200 μCi/ml. EA hy926 endothelial cells (from Dr. M. Soria, Milan, Italy), primary keratinocytes (from Dr. M. De Luca, Roma, Italy) and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (from Dr. G. Gaudino, Novara, Italy) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (from Dr. De Filipppi, Torino, Italy) were cultured on a coating of 0.1% gelatin from bovine skin, in M199 medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml of endothelial cell growth supplement, and 100 μg/ml heparin. 1G11 (from Dr. A. Vecchi, Milano, Italy) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, 1% of essential amino acids, 20 mm HEPES, 100 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement, and 100 μg/ml heparin. Conditioned media (CM) were collected from mature osteoblasts in the second phase of osteogenesis (7–10 days) in vitro from ROB propagatedin vitro. After rinsing the monolayer two times with warm phosphate-buffered saline, the cultures were incubated for 5 h in serum-free medium (SFM), and the CM was harvested, centrifuged to remove cells and debris, and immediately utilized or kept frozen. When indicated, tunicamicin (5 μg/ml) was added to the culture at 6 days of differentiation and maintained for 20 h in medium containing serum and for the following 5 h in SFM during collection of CM. We have measured the induction of chemotaxis in a Boyden chamber assay (17Dejana E. Languino L.R. Polentarutti N. Balconi G. Ryckewaert J.J. Larrieu M.J. Donati M.B. Mantovani A. Marguerie G. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), measuring the migration of target cells through gelatin (5 ng/ml)-coated polycarbonate polyvinylpyrrolidone-free filters (12-nm pore size; Nucleopore, Italy). Standard conditions for Boyden chamber assays utilized human endothelial line EA hy926, 12 × 104 cells/upper compartment and 17 μg of DNA equivalent of CM/lower compartment of each chamber. Incubation was for 6 h. The upper side of filters was scraped, and the migrated cells were fixed in ethanol, stained with toluidine blue (2%), and quantitated microscopically at a × 20 magnification. Five random fields were counted. 100 cells/field corresponded to 15% of the total cells. When indicated, other cell lines were tested in the same conditions. Each experiment was in duplicate and was repeated at least three times. The effect of pH variation on the chemotactic activity of CM was tested at room temperature under stirring for 3 min by the addition of NaOH or HCl in predetermined amounts to obtain the desired pH, followed by neutralization before use in a biological assay. The effect of EDTA or β-mercaptoethanol was tested by adding it to CM that was then directly utilized in a chemotactic assay. Heat lability was tested by setting 1 ml of CM in a preheated bath for 15 min under stirring, followed by chilling in ice. Trypsin (4.1 mm) digestion was for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by soy bean inhibitor (4.1 mm). Chondroitinase (1 unit/ml) digestion was for 60 min at 37 °C. Heparin (10 μg/ml or 50 μg/ml) was added directly to CM. Antisera against human fibronectin (from Prof. G. Tarone, Torino, Italy) or rat type I collagen (Pasteur, Lyon, France) or α1 and α2 carboxyl-terminal propeptides of collagen type I (from Dr. A. Veis, Chicago) or goat IgG (Pasteur) were added to CM before utilizing in a Boyden assay. All of the concentrations of the antisera utilized to test their effects on endothelial cell migration in Boyden assays were also tested in SFM and showed no effects on cell migration or viability. The scattering effect of osteoblast CM at various dilutions was tested on Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, human keratinocytes, and EA hy926 colonies over 18 h and estimated by microscopy. As a positive control, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF; from Dr. P. Comoglio, Torino, Italy) was used. During Boyden chamber assay in standard conditions, EA hy926 were added with pertussis toxin, antisera against metalloproteinase 2 or 9 (from Dr. Stettler-Stevenson), or blocking antibodies against integrins α1 (anti-rat 3A3; from Dr. C. Damsky), α2 (anti-human; Chemicon), β1 (anti-human BV7 and AIIB2; from Dr. Tarone), and β3 (anti-human, from Dr. Tarone) at the dilutions indicated in the figures. Endothelial cell CM was collected after incubation for 6 h from the upper compartment of Boyden chambers. The lower compartments contained, respectively, CM SFM, from osteoblasts, or purified C3. EA hy926 conditioned media were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-acrylamide gels containing 2.8 mg/ml gelatin in a water-refrigerated box. After electrophoresis, the gels were washed twice for 30 min each time in 2.5% Triton X-100, incubated overnight at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 1 mm ZnCl2, 0.02% NaN3. Proteolytic activity was visualized as clear bands against the blue background after staining the gels in 0.2% Coomassie Blue R-250 in 40% methanol and 10% acetic acid, followed by destaining in 40% methanol and 10% acetic acid. CM were collected for 5 h from propagated ROB (46–70 passages in vitro) in SFM differentiation medium. Molecular weight fractionation of CM was performed by centrifugation in Centriplus (Millipore Corp.) tubes, fitted with molecular sieve filters, according to the instructions of the manufacturer. 1–10 ml of CM or fractions recovered from Centriplus were loaded, after extensive dialysis at 4 °C against 50 mm Tris-HCl, on a 2.5-ml column of heparin-Sepharose and eluted stepwise or with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–1 m) in Tris-HCl 50 mm, pH 7.5, at 4 °C. The fractions were dialyzed against SFM at 4 °C 16 h before testing for chemotactic activity or concentrated by ethanol precipitation before gel electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Purification for sequencing purposes was done from 500 ml of CM, and the above procedure was scaled up accordingly. Preparative gels were electrotransferred on ProBlottTM membrane (Applied Biosystems), and proteins were revealed by Coomassie staining. Excised bands were directly sequenced by automated Edman degradation on a Procise Protein Sequencer, model 492, equipped with a 140C Microgradient system from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The EMBL data bank was utilized for sequence assignment. Type I collagen α1 chain has accession number Z78279.1, and the α2 chain has accession number AF121217.1. All data were the average of at least duplicate samples. Experiments were repeated at least twice. All chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise specified. During the osteogenic differentiation, in vitropropagated ROB populations express transiently a chemotactic activity for endothelial cells (Fig.1 A). By the checkerboard test we show that the major component of the activity is chemotactic, with only a minor chemokinetic component (Fig. 1 B). Biological tests do not identify scattering (TableI) and mitogenic (not shown) activities in chemotactic CM at the concentration that is inductive of migration. Presence or absence of serum is irrelevant to the effect of CM on proliferation of EA hy926, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and 1G11 cells of murine lung endothelium. The chemotactic response is specific for endothelial cells, among the normal cells tested (Fig.1 C).Table IScattering testMDCKEA hy926Human keratinocytesHGF (0.8 units/ml)+−NDHGF (0.16 units/ml)+−NDHGF (0.08 units/ml)−−NDHGF (0.016 units/ml)−−NDCM undiluted−−−CM (75%)−−−CM (50%)−−NDCM (25%)−−NDThe addition of SFM containing HGF or CM to cell colonies was followed by incubation at 37 °C.

The response of endothelial cells to the chemoattractant is inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by pertussis toxin (PTX) (Fig. 2 A) by blocking monoclonal antibodies to α1, β1integrins and by a polyclonal antiserum against β3integrin (Fig. 2 B). Antibodies against MMP-2 and MMP-9 also inhibit migration in chemotaxis assay (Fig. 2 C) Analysis of the chemico-physical parameters of the chemoattractant shows loss of activity upon short treatment at acid pH and upon reduction (Table II). Chemotaxis induced by CM is unaffected by the addition of heparin (Fig.3 A), and the activity is independent from glycosylation of osteoblast proteoglycans (Fig. 3,B and C).Table IIHeat lability, pH, and EDTA and reducing agent sensitivity of chemoattractantTreatmentInhibition%50 °C2165 °C8480 °C91pH 330pH 535pH 80pH 107β-Mercaptoethanol (1 mm)21β-Mercaptoethanol (5 mm)38β-Mercaptoethanol (10 mm)44β-Mercaptoethanol (20 mm)59EDTA (20 mm)0.2EDTA (100 mm)0The effect of pH on chemotactic activity was tested by the addition to CM, for 3 min under stirring, of NaOH or HCl in amounts predetermined to obtain the desired pH, followed by neutralization before use in Boyden chamber assay.

All of the above chemico-physical and biological characteristics are distinguished from those of all known chemoattractants for endothelial cells (VEGF/VP, fibroblast growth factors, insulin-like growth factors, platelet derived-endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor-β, tumor necrosis factor-α, angiotropin, HGF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and angiopoietin-1).Table IIIFractionation of osteoblasts CM by molecular size and chromatographic affinity on heparin-SepharoseMolecular sizeCells/fieldNaClCells/fieldm<30 kDa10 ± 50.1030–50 kDa42 ± 10.591 ± 450–100 kDa38 ± 11.012 ± 3>100 kDa109 ± 41.516 ± 2Unfractionated104 ± 52.017 ± 2SFM30 ± 3Fractionation of CM by molecular size was obtained by centrifugation in Centriplus tubes fitted with molecular sieve filters of the indicated molecular size cut.

Purification of the chemoactive substance from the osteoblast CM has been performed by molecular sieve fractionation, followed by heparin-Sepharose chromatography with elution with a linear gradient of NaCl. The fractions have been tested for inducing chemotaxis of EA hy926 cells in the standard assay in a Boyden chamber; active fractions eluted between 0.42 and 0.58 m NaCl. The average yield of protein after the purification was 1.5% of the starting amount. Fig.4 A illustrates the purification by heparin-Sepharose chromatography of a preparation of CM metabolically labeled with Tran35S-labeled amino acids, and Fig. 4 B shows that the single band at about 120 kDa obtained by gel electrophoresis from the unreduced sample splits into two bands at 33 and 35 kDa upon reduction. In large scale preparations, after purification the reduced preparative gels show a single large band spanning 33–35 kDa. This has been sequenced twice and yielded consistently a double amino-terminal sequence; amino acid residues have been attributed to each sequence, taking advantage of the different amount. The major sequence has provided clearly identifiable residues up to position 20, whereas the minor sequence has been identified up to residue 12. The first sequence corresponds in the EMBL data bank to rat type I procollagen α1 chain, starting at position 1208, and the second sequence corresponds to rat type I procollagen α2 chain, starting at position 1126 (Fig. 4 C). The amino termini of both sequences overlap with those produced in the processing of type I procollagen in physiological conditions and in vitro by procollagen C-proteinase (bone morphogenetic protein-1). The α1 and α2 chain carboxyl termini contain, respectively, 246 and 247 amino acid residues, compatible with the molecular weights observed when the purified fraction is run on reduced SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular size of the active purified protein is compatible with it being a trimer of two α1 and one α2 carboxyl-terminal portions of collagen type I. The loss of the chemotactic activity observed in CM by treatment with reducing agents shows that the conservation of intramolecular S–S bonds is required for preservation of the activity. Hence, the biologically active molecule is the trimeric form of the carboxyl propeptide of type I collagen (C3). In agreement with the identification of the chemoattractant as C3, the chemotaxis of endothelial cells is inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by the addition to CM of antibodies against collagen type I and by antibodies directed to α1 and α2carboxyl-terminal propeptides of type I collagen, while no significant inhibition is determined by antibodies against fibronectin and by an aspecific IgG (Fig. 5). No changes of the pattern of cell-associated and secreted metalloproteinases expressed by EA hy926 nor of their activation state are detected upon exposure to CM or C3 (Fig. 6). MMP-2 and MMP-9 are secreted by the endothelial cells, and their activated derivatives at 69, 62, and 59 kDa, respectively, for MMP-2 and 82 kDa for MMP-9 are detected. Also, expression of MMP-14, the membrane metalloproteinase at 66 kDa, is unchanged, regardless of chemoinduction, in the cell lysates analyzed by zymography on gelatin.Figure 6Chemoinduction by osteoblast CM and purified C3 is not dependent on induction of gelatinases in EA hy926. Gelatin zymograms of conditioned media (lanes 1–3) and lysates (lanes 4–6) of EA hy926 were collected after exposure, for 6 h in Boyden chamber, to osteoblast chemoattractant CM (lanes 1 and4), to serum-free medium (lanes 2 and5), and to purified chemoattractant (C3, lanes 3 and 6).

During osteogenesis in vitro, C3 molecules are generated as a by-product of collagen biosynthesis by mature osteogenic cells, and chemoattractant activity in CM is detectable in concomitance with maximum expression and deposition of collagenous matrix by mature osteoblasts and decrease at mineralization of the cultures (6Stringa E.

We also detected a similar pattern of chemoattractant expression by analysis of the chemotaxis of endothelial cells induced by CM collected during in vitro osteogenesis of normal and transformed human osteoblasts. 2D. Palmieri, V. Ulivi, and P. Manduca, unpublished observation. The chemotactic response of endothelial cells requires the activation of Go/Gi-proteins, the functionality of integrins α1, β1, and β3, and the functionality of metalloproteinases 2 and 9. G protein signaling events activated by chemoattractants have been described, and it was suggested that G-proteins can generally act as mediators of the cellular response to chemotactic stimuli (18Parent C.A.

G-proteins are known to synergize in the cellular response to growth factors, cytokines, and integrins, through a mechanism as yet unknown. Synergy with other receptors might be involved also in the chemotactic response to C3, and β1 integrin receptors are likely candidates. α1β1 and α2β1integrins were shown to interact with collagen carboxyl propeptides (19Davies D.

Benes J.E. Perruzzi C.A. Sergiou A.P. Detmar M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 13612-13617Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). We demonstrate an inhibitory effect on migration of endothelial cells using antibodies to α1 and β1 integrins, not present with antibodies against α2 integrin. Since we have utilized only one blocking monoclonal antibody against α2 integrin, this last finding is not conclusive about the relevance of α2 integrin for endothelial cell directional migration. The inhibitory effect of blocking antibodies to α1β1 integrin on the migration of endothelial cells induced by osteoblast CM suggests that α1β1 integrin could be involved in the recognition of the chemoattractant by endothelial cells. Nonetheless, endothelial cells might require α1β1integrin to cross into the gelatin coating the filters, and further testing is required to discriminate between these possibilities. The expression of β3 integrin is required for the osteoblast CM-induced migration of endothelial cells. Morphogenesis of vessels in vitro, as well as VEGF-induced and VEGFR2-mediated activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and proliferation of endothelial cells, require the expression of β3 integrin (27Brooks P.C. Clark R.A. Cheresh D.A. Science. 1994; 264: 569-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (2750) Google Scholar, 28Soldi R. Mitola S. Strasly M. Defilippi P. Tarone G. Bussolino F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 882-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). We do not presently know what role β3 integrin might play in the induction of migratory response by C3. Metalloproteinases are also required for endothelial cell migration induced by osteoblast CM. Expression of MMP-14, the membrane metalloproteinase-1, was shown to be required for endothelial cell invasion of fibrin gels in vivo and in vitroindependently from MMP-2 expression (29Hiraoka N. Allen E. Apel I.J. Gyetko M.R. Weiss S.J. Cell. 1998; 95: 365-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). In EA hy926, the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, and of the membrane gelatinase MMP-14 are constitutive and are not changed by exposure of the cells to chemoattractant CM from osteoblasts and to purified C3. Also, the activation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 occur constitutively, suggesting that the proteases required for EA hy926 migration are not under the control of the chemotactic stimulus. Their inhibition will anyhow result in hindrance to migration through the gelatin on the filter. Unlike in the case of EA hy926, osteoblast CM induces MMP-9 expression in melanoma, breast, and prostatic carcinoma cells; in these last cases, induction of urokinase-type plasminogen activator was also detected (8Giunciuglio D.

Albini A. Bologna M. Oncol. Res. 1999; 11: 17-31PubMed Google Scholar). C3 is not mitogenic in vitro at the concentrations inductive of chemotaxis, and we are presently testing concentrated CM for mitogenic activity. Nonetheless, synergism of function of different angiogenic stimuli was reported (1Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10931-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Montesano R.

Denhardt D.T. Noda M. J. Bone Mineral Res. 1999; 14: 1004Google Scholar), angiopoietin-1 (31Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Acheson A. Compton D.L. Jain V. Ryan T.E. Bruno J. Radziejewski C.

Endothelial cells might therefore findin vivo in the bone extracellular matrix the stimuli required for proliferation and morphogenesis. In summary, previous evidence pointed primarily to a role of C3 as feedback regulator of type I procollagen synthesis in homeostasis during bone development and metabolism (33Aycock R.S. Raghow W.R.

Chem. 1993; 268: 6107-6114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and our results show that C3 has an additional role in promoting specifically directional migration of endothelial cells. Production of C3 is specifically associated with the mature osteoblastic phenotype, and the chemotactic activity of C3 might have a role in promoting in vivo localized vascular invasion in the areas of newly formed bone during embryogenesis. Since the factors required for the angiogenic invasion of the growth plate are not required for the initial vascularization at the diaphyseal bone collar and for the formation of the bone marrow cavity (4Gerber H.P. Vu T.H. Ryan A.M. Kowalski J. Werb Z. Ferrara N. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar, 5Vu T.H. Shipley J.M. Bergers G. Berger J.E. Helms J.A. Hanahan D. Shapiro S.D. Senior R.M. Werb Z. Cell. 1998; 93: 411-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar), it is likely that other mechanisms are involved in determining the vascular invasion in the collagen type I-based extracellular matrix deposed by osteoblasts and periosteal cells at this site. Production of C3 might represent the initial chemotactic event to orient endothelial cells toward the bone collar in the long bone. The role of osteoblasts and periosteal cells in promoting vascular invasion in vivorequires investigation. The finding that a metabolically produced fragment of collagen type I may have a specific biological role is not so unexpected in view of the fact that specific roles were already reported for fragments physiologically produced from various collagens (12O'Reilly M.S.

For example, endostatin from collagen type XVIII, restin from collagen type XV, and canstatin from collagen type IV are involved in the control of vascularization. In general, the multiple functions of collagen molecules might be therefore the outcome of a selection during evolution, which allows structural multidomain proteins to maintain homeostasis of the vascularization (and growth?) of tissues.

Using anti-Spc2p antibodies, we show here that this heterotetrameric complex associates with Sbh1p and Sbh2p, the β-subunits of the Sec61p complex and the Ssh1p complex, respectively. Depletion of Spc2p decreased the enzymatic activity of the SPC in vitro, led to a loss of Spc1p, and led to a down-regulation of the amount of Sec11p and Spc3p in the endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, the deletion of Spc2p also decreased the expression level of Sbh2p. These data implicate that Spc2p not only enhances the enzymatic activity of the SPC but also facilitates the interactions between different components of the translocation site.

In both cases the central component of the translocation site is a heterotrimeric Sec61 complex, which consists of an α-subunit, spanning the membrane 10 times, and two small single spanning proteins, the β-subunit and the γ-subunit. The complex forms the hydrophilic channels through which the protein translocation occurs and is responsible for the signal sequence recognition in the ER membrane. During co-translational translocation, the Sec61 complex is also responsible for the tight binding of the ribosome to the translocation site. In yeast, two different types of ribosome-bound Sec61 complexes exist, which most likely are involved in the co-translational pathway: the Sec61p complex and the Ssh1p complex. The two complexes differ in both their α-subunits (Sec61p and Ssh1p) and β-subunits (Sbh1p and Sbh2p), but contain the same γ-subunit (Sss1p) (3Deshaies R.J. Schekman R. J.

In addition, yeast contains a Sec complex consisting of the Sec61p complex and the Sec62/63 subcomplex which is essential and sufficient for post-translational translocation (4Panzner S. Dreier L. Hartmann E. Kostka S. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 561-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Deletion of SEC61,SSS1, SEC62, or SEC63 results in a massive accumulation of precursors of secretory proteins and is lethal (3Deshaies R.J. Schekman R. J.

Additionally, the β-subunits of the Sec61-like complexes, Sbh1p and Sbh2p, are not essential for the function of the respective translocation sites. However, cells lacking both proteins accumulate precursors of secretory proteins in the cytoplasm, and their growth at elevated temperatures is severely impaired (5Finke K Plath K. Panzner S. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. Sommer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1482-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Another component of the ER translocation site is the signal peptidase complex (SPC), which removes signal sequences from the nascent chains during the transport process. In yeast, the SPC consists of four different polypeptides named Spc1p, Spc2p, Spc3p, and Sec11p (8YaDeau J.T. Klein C. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Spc3p and Sec11p have single transmembrane spans with the majority of the protein being located in the ER lumen. Both proteins are essential for yeast viability. Deletion of either protein leads to the loss of signal peptidase activity both, in vivo and in vitro(9Bohni P.C. Deshaies R.J. Schekman R.W. J.

Mullins C. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11519-11525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Nothing is known so far about the function of Spc1p and of Spc2p. Their mammalian homologues Spc12 and Spc25 probably span the membrane twice with only very few residues facing the ER lumen. Based on this topology, it was suggested that these proteins may also perform functions independent from the actual proteolytic activity of the SPC (15Kalies K.U. Hartmann E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3925-3929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This idea is supported by the fact that chicken Spc12 and Spc25 are not needed for the proteolytic activity of the SPC in vitro (16Lively M.O. Walsh K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9488-9495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, yeast SPC1 andSPC2 are not essential for the survival of the cells at temperatures below 38 °C. However, at 42 °C Δspc2mutants display an accumulation of precursors of secretory proteinsin vivo and a reduced cell viability (17Fang H. Panzner S. Mullins C. Hartmann E. Green N. J. Biol.

In addition, depletion of Spc2p decreases the expression levels of other SPC components and of Sbh2p. Immunoprecipitation also demonstrates that Spc2p is in complex with Sbh1p and Sbh2p, the β-subunits of Sec61-like complexes. Together, these data implicate that a major function of the Spc2p is to facilitate the interactions between different components of the translocation site.

The plasmid pHM3 used for complementation of the Δspc2 mutation was constructed as follows. SPC2 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using a forward oligonucleotide (ATGAGTTCTGCTAAACCTATTATG) starting from the start codon of SPC2 and a reverse primer (CAAGGTACCGAAGATGTTATCAAAG), which is located 680 base pairs downstream of the SPC2 stop codon. The product was digested withKpnI and the resulting fragment was cloned into a pRS414 (20Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at SmaI/KpnI site.

Cells of the strain HFY403 that harbored the plasmid pHM3 were preincubated overnight in YPGal medium (10Meyer H.A. Hartmann E. J. Biol.

After a 1-h incubation at 30 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and were resuspended in the same volume YPD medium. After 6 h, the culture was diluted again from 0.7 OD600 to 0.1 OD600 with YPD medium.

The final conditions of the assay were 50 mmtriethanolamine, pH 8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4 mg/ml phosphatidylcholine, 0.01% SDS (from the SDS pre-treatment of the prepro-α-factor), 120 mm potassium acetate, 0.2% digitonin, and protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml chymostatin). The added prepro-α-factor was synthesized in a reticulocyte system in the presence of [35S]methionine. After 2 h at 23 °C, the samples were precipitated and precursor and product were separated by SDS-PAGE. The ratio between precursor and product was determined by measuring the amount of the radioactivity using a Fuji BAS 2000 bioimager.

For quantification35S-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used in the immunoblots followed by analysis using a Fuji BAS 2000 bioimager. Membrane fractions from wt and Δspc2 (HFY403) strains were solubilized in extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 375 mm potassium acetate, 10% glycerol, 1.5% digitonin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml chymostatin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin) at a final concentration of 50 eq/ml. Lysates were centrifuged at 200,000 ×g in a TLA100.3 rotor for 60 min to divide off ribosomes, ribosome-bound proteins, and unsolubilized material. The supernatants were diluted with four volumes of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1.5% digitonin, and immunoprecipitation was performed using affinity-purified antibodies against Spc1p and Spc2p, covalently coupled to Protein A-Sepharose beads. After incubation for 8 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed eight times with 20 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm potassium acetate, 2.5% glycerol, 1.5% digitonin and the bound material was eluted with SDS-sample buffer. Equal amounts corresponding to the starting volume of the clarified lysates, the immunoprecipitates and the supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies against Sec61p, Sec62p, Spc3p, Spc2p, and Spc1p. For the identification of Sbh1p and Sbh2p in the samples, Tricine gel electrophoresis (16.5% T, 6% C) and immunoblotting procedure were used as described (23Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal.

Immunodecorated proteins were visualized using Protein A-coupled horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) and enhanced chemiluminescence. Membrane fractions from wt and Δspc1Δspc2 (HFY404) strains were solubilized in extraction buffer (50 mm triethanolamine, pH 8.0, 375 mm potassium acetate, 10% glycerol, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 1.5% digitonin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml chymostatin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin) at a final concentration of 0.25 eq/μl. After a centrifugation step (174,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C in a TLA100.3 rotor), the supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μl of concanavalin A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After washing of the concanavalin A-Sepharose beads (three times with the extraction buffer described above), the proteins were eluted with SDS-sample buffer. Equal amounts corresponding to the starting volume of the bound and unbound material were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies against Sec11p, Spc2p, and Spc3p. In vivo analysis of Δspc2 strains revealed an accumulation of precursors of secretory proteins at 42 °C (18Mullins C. Meyer H.A. Hartmann E. Green N. Fang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29094-29099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To investigate whether this effect of theSPC2 deletion is directly linked to the activity of the SPC, we set out to analyze the enzymatic activity of Spc2p-free SPC in vitro. Signal peptidase cleavage was assayed as described in Ref.10Meyer H.A. Hartmann E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13159-13164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar using digitonin solubilized membranes from the Δspc2strain and prepro-α-factor as a substrate. As a control we included membranes derived from a wild-type strain, a Δspc1 strain, and a strain with a Δspc1/Δspc2 double deletion. The amount of digitonin extract added was calibrated to the same amount of Sec11p and Spc3p. We found that the deletion of Spc1p had no effect on the signal peptidase activity (Fig.1 A). In contrast, deletion of Spc2p reduced the activity by a factor of 2. A Δspc1/Δspc2 double deletion resulted in no further reduction of the signal peptidase activity. We wondered whether the decreased signal peptide cleavage could be due to a direct effect on the catalytic center of the SPC or a diminished stability of the complex. To test whether the stability is altered in a Δspc1/Δspc2 strain, a digitonin extract was bound to concanavalin A. In wild-type cells yeast SPC does not dissociate into its subunits in the presence of digitonin (18Mullins C. Meyer H.A. Hartmann E. Green N. Fang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29094-29099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition to the glycosylated Spc3p, the bound material contained the unglycosylated Sec11p, indicating that also in the absence of Spc1p and Spc2p the two remaining subunits did not dissociate (Fig.1 C). To confirm these results, we repeated the cleavage assay in the presence of saponin using membranes from wild-type cells and a Δspc1/Δspc2 mutant strain. These conditions are probably more gentle for the enzyme, because integral membrane proteins like the SPC are not released from the lipid bilayer. Again, the activity of the SPC from the double deletion strain was only half that of wild-type SPC (data not shown). Together these data indicate that Spc2p is modulating the peptidase activity of the yeast SPC. Next we wanted to analyze the SPC composition of the deletion strains in more detail. Membranes purified from a Δspc1 strain, a Δspc2 strain, a Δspc1/Δspc2 strain, and a corresponding wild-type strain were calibrated using to the same amount of Sec62p as a measure of the number of translocation sites. The amount of the different SPC subunits was analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig.1 B). We found that membranes of a Δspc2 strain did not contain Spc1p. Spc1p was also not detectable if complete cell lysates were analyzed. Nevertheless, there was no reduction in the expression of Spc1p mRNA detectable, indicating that the regulation was at the level of protein synthesis or degradation (data not shown). Moreover, we observed that strains depleted of Spc2p expressed a lower amount of Sec11p and Spc3p in relation to Sec62p (Fig.1 B). To confirm that the differences between the wild-type strain and the deletion strains were not due to differences in the genetic background, we repeated the experiment using a Δspc2 strain that contained SPC2 on a plasmid under control of a Gal10 promotor. Cells were first grown on galactose-containing medium. Under these conditions Spc2p expression is induced. The cells were then shifted to glucose for 10 h to inhibit Spc2p synthesis and finally re-shifted on galactose to reinduce the Spc2p synthesis. At different time points, cells were collected and a crude ER membrane fraction was prepared. The samples were calibrated to the same amount of Sec62p as a measure of the number of translocation sites. The amount of Sec62p per OD of membranes was in all samples nearly identical, indicating that the density of translocation sites did not change significantly during the experiment (data not shown). The different samples were then analyzed for their signal peptidase activity in vitro. Upon induction of Spc2p, the cleavage activity of the strain was identical to that of an isogenic wild-type strain (Fig.2 A). Depletion of Spc2p led to a decrease of signal peptidase activity to at least one fourth of original values (Fig. 2 A). Please note that the more dramatic decrease in signal peptidase activity compared with Fig.1 A is due to differences in the calibration of the samples. Whereas in the experiment shown in Fig. 2 A the samples were calibrated to the same amount of Sec62p, samples in Fig. 1A were calibrated to the amounts of Sec11p and Spc3p. As expected, depletion of Spc2p also caused the loss of Spc1p and a decrease of Spc3p and Sec11p to half compared with the level of Sec62p (Fig. 2 B). Re-induction of Spc2p reversed these effects. In contrast to Spc1p, Spc2p is therefore crucial for the composition and the steady-state level of the SPC in the ER membrane.Figure 2Analysis of the SPC composition and signal peptidase activity using a conditional spc2mutant. A Δspc2 strain (HFY403) transformed with the plasmid pHM3 expressing Spc2p under control of an Gal10 promotor was preincubated in YPGal medium allowing the expression of Spc2p. The cells were then shifted to YPD medium to repress the Spc2p synthesis. After 10 h cells were shifted back to YPGal medium to reinduce the Spc2p synthesis. Aliquots of cells were removed at the time points indicated, and microsomes were prepared. wt membranes were isolated from the SEY62.10 strain.

Quantification of proteins with 35S-labeled secondary antibody was performed as described above (Fig. 1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although the Sec62p level roughly paralleled the overall amount of ER membranes, one cannot exclude that Sec62p is up-regulated when Spc2p is depleted. Therefore, we repeated the experiment and assayed the amount of other components of the translocation apparatus in the ER by immunoblotting (Fig.3 A). As for Sec62p, the amount of Sec72p, another component of the Sec62/63 complex, did not change in response to alterations of the Spc2p level. Similarly, the amount of components of the Sec61p complex Sec61p and Sbh1p, and the amount of Ssh1p, the α-subunit of the Ssh1 complex, did not change. However, the level of Sbh2p (the β-subunit of the Ssh1p complex) decreased to about one fifth following depletion of Spc2p and returned to the wild-type level, after re-initiation of synthesis of Spc2p (Fig.3 A). These differences in the expression level of Sbh2p were also detected if membranes of a Δspc2 strain that carried noSPC2 plasmid were compared with membranes of an isogenic wild-type strain (Fig. 3 B). Deletion of SPC1 did not decrease the Sbh2p level (Fig. 3 B). The observed effect of Spc2p on the stability of Sbh2p could be explained by a physical interaction of these two proteins in the membrane. In order to test this hypothesis, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments. Yeast rough membranes were solubilized with digitonin and depleted of ribosome-associated Sec61-like complexes by centrifugation. In addition to the components of the SPC complex, antibodies raised against Spc2p were able to precipitate both Sbh2p and Sbh1p from this extract (Fig.4). The amount of Sbh1p and Sbh2p molecules associated to the SPC under these conditions was in the order of 5–10% of the whole population. Other components of the translocation machinery like Sec62p or Sec61p were not precipitated under these conditions. The same result was obtained using antibodies raised against Spc1p. No precipitation was observed if membranes of a Spc2p deletion strain were used. This shows that the SPC is in a complex with Sbh1p and Sbh2p. Several data indicate that the mammalian SPC is located close to ribosome-associated translocation channels that are active in co-translational protein translocation. Signal peptides of nascent chains are cleaved off by the SPC subunits while being translocated (24Perara E. Rothman R.E. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1986; 232: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Chemical cross-linking experiments have revealed that mammalian SPC25 is in the vicinity of Sec61β in the presence of translocating ribosomes (25Kalies K.U. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, so far, no complex between the SPC and components of the Sec61 complex has been purified. It was therefore possible that the observed proximity between SPC and the Sec61 complex is only mediated by a simultaneous interaction of both complexes with membrane-bound ribosomes. We now show that in yeast the SPC is associated with the β-subunits of the Sec61 complexes in the absence of ribosomes. We could not demonstrate that the SPC-associated β-subunits are also associated to Sec61p or Ssh1p. Moreover, antibodies raised against the amino termini of Sbh1p and Sbh2p immunoprecipitate Sec61-like complexes but not SPC components. Besides the possibility of technical limitations, these findings could also indicate that the population of Sbh1p and Sbh2p that is associated with the SPC is different from that found in the Sec61 complexes. In contrast to Sbh1p, Sbh2p becomes unstable in vivo, when not able to associate with an α-subunit such as Ssh1p or Sec61p (5Finke K Plath K. Panzner S. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. Sommer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1482-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 26Biederer T. Volkwein C. Sommer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2069-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Therefore, the fact that the depletion of Spc2p results in a comparable decrease in the steady state level of Sbh2p confirms the existence of complexes between the SPC and Sbh2p. Moreover, it indicates that interaction between the SPC and the β-subunits of the Sec61complexes is mediated by the Spc2p. Cross-linking experiments in mammals also point toward a direct interaction between SPC25 and Sec61β (25Kalies K.U. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We speculate that Spc2p and Sbh1p or Sbh2p form an interface for the association between the SPC and the Sec61 complexes. The Spc1p/SPC12 and Spc2p/SPC25 are components of the signal peptidase that are not found in procaryotic organisms. Although chicken SPC depleted of SPC12 and SPC25 has signal peptidase activity in vitro, the in vivo analysis of a SPC2deletion mutant showed a weak phenotype resulting in an accumulation of precursors of secretory proteins at 42 °C (18Mullins C. Meyer H.A. Hartmann E. Green N. Fang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29094-29099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Protease protection assays revealed that the precursors are located within the ER lumen, indicating that the accumulation is not caused by a lower translocation efficiency (e.g. due to the lower amount of Sbh2p in these cells) (data not shown). The biochemical analysis of these mutants now demonstrates that the in vivo phenotype is probably a result of two effects. First, the depletion of Spc2p significantly reduces the amount of SPC per translocation site in the ER membrane. Second, SPCs that have no Spc2p and no Spc1p show a diminished cleavage activityin vitro at least for the substrate used in the assay. Deletion of Spc1p alone has no influence on the activity of the SPC. Interestingly, the analysis of the conditional spc2 mutant indicates that SPCs which are only depleted of the Spc2p show also no decreased activity (Fig. 3 A; compare 4 and 6 h after shift to glucose). To this end, it is not clear how the presence of Spc2p (and perhaps also Spc1p) enhances the activity of the catalytic subunit Sec11p. One possibility is that the membrane-spanning regions of Spc1p and Spc2p help to form the binding pocket for the hydrophobic substrate of the protein. Thus, they may maintain structural flexibility or stability of SPC needed for effective processing of signal peptides. We thank A. Wittstruck and B. Nentwig for technical assistance and P.

In an effort to develop an αvβ3 inhibitor that down-regulates the actual level of αvβ3, we developed an antisense strategy to inhibit αvβ3 expression in vitro. β3 antisense expressed in endothelial cells specifically down-regulated αvβ3 and inhibited capillary tube formation, with the extent of down-regulation correlating with the extent of tube formation inhibition. This inhibition was matrix-specific, since tube formation was not inhibited in Matrigel. These findings support the notion that αvβ3is required for an essential step of angiogenesis in fibrin, namely capillary tube formation. These results suggest that pseudogenetic inhibition of β3 integrins using antisense techniques may ultimately provide a therapeutic means to inhibit angiogenesis in vivo. αvβ3antagonists are potent angiogenesis inhibitors, and several different classes of inhibitors have been developed, including monoclonal antibodies, synthetic peptides, and small organic molecules.

While no drug is entirely selective, antisense has a theoretical advantage over antibodies, inhibitory peptides, or organic molecules in that the drug does not bind directly to the receptor. Furthermore, αvβ3 expression can theoretically be targeted specifically, unlike the pleiotypic effects seen with certain cytokines such as transforming growth factor β or interferon γ (29Sepp N.T.

Dermatol. 1992; 99: 683-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. Edwin W. Ades (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA). HMEC-1 cells were grown in MCDB-131, 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Collaborative Biomedical Products), 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Unless otherwise indicated, cell culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. All expression vectors were transfected into HMEC-1 cells using Lipofectin (Life Technologies) as per the manufacturer's instructions, using 12 μl of Lipofectin for 2 μg of DNA. The DNA and Lipofectin were incubated with HMEC-1 cells in serum-free medium for 16 h, and the medium was then replaced with complete serum-containing medium. After 48 h, 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Life Technologies) was added to the medium to select for stable transfectants. Selective pressure was maintained throughout the culture of the transfectants, and clones were used for only 4–6 passages not only because of the potential loss of the vector but also because of the potential for gradual loss of the antisense effect, despite stable transfection (34Bolen J.B.

Cells were prepared for flow cytometry by detaching HMEC-1 cells with 5 mm EDTA in PBS (137 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4). Cells were rinsed twice with PBS, resuspended in 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in PBS, and incubated with primary antibody, either anti-αv (P3G8; Chemicon), anti-αvβ3 (LM609; Chemicon) (25Cheresh D.A.

Cells were rinsed in PBS, resuspended in 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in PBS, and incubated with fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit F(ab′)2 fragment to mouse IgG (ICN) at a 1:33 dilution for 20 min at 4 °C. Cells were rinsed in PBS and resuspended in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Cells were analyzed using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson), and 10,000 cells were counted per sample. Expression of the β3 sense and antisense fragments in HMEC-1 cells was confirmed by RT-PCR. Cytosolic RNA was isolated from 5 × 106 to 1 × 107 cells using an RNeasy RNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. RNA yields were quantified by spectrophotometry. Reverse transcription and PCR were performed using forward primer 5′-CGG GGT ACC GAT GAG GCC CTG CCT CTG GGC TCA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CGC GGA TCC CAC CTG CCG CAC TTG GAT GGA GAA-3′. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was used as an internal positive control using the forward primer 5′-TTA GCA CCC CTG GCC AAG G-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CTT ACT CCT TGG AGG CCA TG-3′. RT-PCR was performed in a single tube using Titan One-tube RT-PCR (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The final reaction was composed of 1× RT-PCR buffer, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm (each) deoxynucleotide, 10 units of RNAsin (Promega), and the supplied enzyme mix containing avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and Expand High Fidelity PCR enzyme. The reverse transcription was performed on a PTC-200 Thermocycler (MJ Research) for 30 min at 55 °C followed by inactivation at 94 °C for 4 min, initiating the denaturation step for PCR. The following steps were performed for 28 cycles: 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 55 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min (7 min during the final cycle). RNA samples were assessed for genomic contamination by performing the PCR without reverse transcription using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs). pCEP-4 containing the 240-bp antisense fragment was used as a positive control. Cell extracts were prepared from HMEC-1 cells by solubilizing 10-cm plates of cells at 4 °C with 1 ml of 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 1 μm leupeptin, 0.1 mm n-ethylmaleimide, 1 μmpepstatin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce), and equal amounts of extracted cell proteins were loaded on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose (40Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44643) Google Scholar) at 0.65 V/cm2 for 4 h at 4 °C. The nitrocellulose blots were probed with either anti-αv rabbit polyclonal antisera (AB 1950; Chemicon) or anti-β3 rabbit polyclonal antisera (AB 1952; Chemicon), using a goat anti-rabbit IgG/horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) as the secondary antibody. Bands were developed using a chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal West Femto; Pierce) and photographed using a digital camera (Alpha Innotech Corp.). As a control for loading and transfer, parallel blots were stained for total protein with 0.1% Ponceau S, 1% acetic acid and scanned using an Epson Perfection 636 scanner. Plasminogen-free human fibrinogen (Calbiochem) was further purified by DEAE-column chromatography as described previously (41Finlayson J.S. Suchinsky R.T. Dayton A.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1960; 39: 1837-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 42Falls L.A. Farrell D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14251-14256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Peak γA/γA and γA/γ′ fractions were pooled separately, precipitated with 0.234 g/ml ammonium sulfate, and resuspended in 137 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2 for storage at −70 °C. γA/γA fibrinogen was used for all experiments. Fibrinogen was dialyzed into PBS and sterile-filtered using a 0.2-μm filter for use in capillary tube formation assays. A modification of the method of Nehls and Drenckhahn (43Nehls V. Drenckhahn D. Microvasc. Res. 1995; 50: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) was used to measure endothelial cell capillary tube formation in a three-dimensional fibrin-based matrix. HMEC-1 cells were grown to confluence on Cytodex-3 microcarriers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2–3 days in spinner flasks at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Confluent HMEC-1 cell-coated microcarriers were rinsed three times and resuspended in tube formation assay medium: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 20% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 200 kallikrein-inactivating units/ml aprotinin (Bayer). HMEC-1 cell-coated microcarriers were added to sterile-filtered solutions containing 1.5 mg/ml fibrinogen in PBS with 200 kallikrein-inactivating units/ml aprotinin and 30 ng/ml bFGF (R & D Systems). The concentration of bFGF was the same as that used by Nehls and Drenckhahn (43Nehls V. Drenckhahn D. Microvasc. Res. 1995; 50: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) for stimulating endothelial cell capillary tube formation. Higher doses of bFGF (up to 3-fold) had no additional effect on capillary tube formation. 50-μl aliquots containing ∼15–20 HMEC-1-coated microcarriers were added to wells of a 96-well plate. Human α-thrombin (0.625 NIH units/ml, 3000 NIH units/mg; obtained from Dr. Walter Kisiel, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM) was immediately added and incubated for 30 min to induce fibrin clot formation. Abciximab (obtained from Dr. Mark Kozak, Penn State University, Hershey, PA), LM609, JB1a, or PBS as a control was dissolved in assay medium, and 50 μl was added on top of the clot and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 1 h. An additional 50 μl of tube formation assay medium was then added, and plates were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 2–5 days. Cell nuclei were stained for 2 h with 50 μg/ml bisbenzimide (Sigma). After inverting the plate, cell sprouts, defined as projections containing a minimum of three nuclei (43Nehls V. Drenckhahn D. Microvasc. Res. 1995; 50: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), were counted using fluorescence microscopy. The mean number of sprouts per microcarrier was determined in triplicate, and each assay was performed a minimum of three times. Photomicrographs were taken using an Olympus B-Max 50 epifluorescence microscope with a Paultek cooled charge-coupled device camera interfaced with a Scion LG3 framestore board mounted in a Macintosh Centris 650 computer and running Adobe Photoshop. Transmission electron microscopy was performed using a modification of the method of Karnovsky (44Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1965; 27 (abstr.): 137Google Scholar). Capillary tube formation assays were performed as described up to the point of bisbenzimide staining. HMEC-1 cells were then rinsed three times with 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.3, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 0.5 mg/ml CaCl2, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.3, for 2 h at 4 °C. HMEC-1 cells were rinsed three times at 5-min intervals in sodium cacodylate, pH 7.3, and postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.3, at 4 °C overnight. Specimens were rinsed three times at 5-min intervals with 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.3, dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, and embedded in 49% EM bed-812, 30% dodecenyl succinic anhydride, 20% nadic methyl anhydride, 1.4% 2,4,6-tri(dimethylaminomethyl)phenol for sectioning. 60–90-nm thin sections were cut with a Diatome diamond knife mounted in a Porter-Blum MT-2B ultramicrotome. Thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead citrate. Photographs were taken using a Philips TEM 400 electron microscope. Wells of a 96-well plate were coated with Matrigel as per the manufacturer's instructions (Collaborative Biomedical Products) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. HMEC-1 cells were detached with 0.25% trypsin, 1 mmEDTA, sedimented by centrifugation for 5 min, and resuspended in cell culture medium. HMEC-1 cells were added to Matrigel-coated wells and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 16 h. Photomicrographs were taken with Eastman Kodak Co. T-Max 400 film at × 100 magnification using an Olympus OM-2 camera attached to a Nikon TMS inverted phase-contrast microscope. To down-regulate αvβ3 expression, the β3integrin subunit mRNA was targeted with RNA antisense. The region of a cDNA that yields effective antisense RNA cannot be predicted with certainty; therefore, four different β3 antisense constructs were tested from different regions of the β3cDNA. The sequences selected for antisense targeting were designed to avoid regions of high homology among β subunits (45Pytela R. Suzuki S. Breuss J. Erle D.J. Sheppard D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 420-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (Fig.1, hatched bars), with the exception of β3 419. A 130-bp β3antisense cDNA fragment (β3 130 antisense) from nucleotides 1–130 preceded the first homologous domain and included one intron/exon boundary and the translational start site; a 240-bp β3 antisense cDNA fragment (β3 240 antisense) from nucleotides 180–419 between the first and second homologous domains included two intron/exon boundaries; a 419-bp β3 antisense cDNA fragment (β3 419 antisense) from nucleotides 1–419 included the same region as β3 130 antisense, but extended through the first homologous domain and ended before the second domain, and contained three intron/exon boundaries; and a 426-bp β3 antisense cDNA fragment (β3 426 antisense) from nucleotides 1068–1493 between the seventh and eighth homologous domains included two intron/exon boundaries. These sequences were amplified using PCR and inserted in a sense or antisense orientation into the mammalian expression vector pCEP-4/hygromycin. The HMEC-1 human microvascular endothelial cell line was chosen for transfection with these constructs rather than primary endothelial cells, since it is difficult, if not impossible, to isolate stable transfectants from primary microvascular endothelial cells in culture. Transfectants that are isolated from such primary cells have often undergone phenotypic changes and have a limited lifespan prior to senescence. In contrast, the HMEC-1 cell line is a diploid cell line that retains the characteristics of microvascular endothelial cells during prolonged culture in vitro and does not dedifferentiate (46Xu Y. Swerlick R.A. Sepp N. Bosse D. Ades E.W. Lawley T.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 102: 833-837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). β3 sense and antisense constructs, as well as a full-length β3/pCEP-4 construct and the pCEP-4 vector alone were stably transfected into HMEC-1 cells. Eight to ten individual clones were isolated for each construct, since vector copy number can alter gene expression in any particular clone. The relative levels of αvβ3 on transfected and nontransfected HMEC-1 cell clones were determined using flow cytometry. β3 130 antisense and β3 419 antisense transfectants had reductions in αvβ3 levels of 28–62% and up to 33%, respectively (data not shown). However, these transfectants also had comparable decreases in β1levels that could complicate the analysis of the specific role of αvβ3 and therefore were not characterized further. In contrast, β3 240 antisense transfectants had reductions in αvβ3 levels of 0–49% with no concomitant changes in β1 levels and showed no significant changes in αvβ5 levels (TableI). β3 426 antisense transfectants had somewhat smaller reductions in αvβ3 levels than the β3 240 antisense transfectants, 2–29% (Table I), and were therefore not characterized further. HMEC-1 cells transfected with pCEP-4 alone or the β3 240 fragment in the sense orientation had levels of αvβ3, β1, and αvβ5 that were comparable with nontransfected HMEC-1 cells (Table I). HMEC-1 cells transfected with full-length β3 in the sense orientation also showed no significant changes in αvβ3 levels (TableI). Cells transfected with the β3 240 fragment in the sense or antisense orientation expressed the appropriate sense or antisense RNA, as detected by semiquantitative RT-PCR, whereas these transcripts were undetectable in wild-type HMEC-1 cells (Fig.2). Although the primers will also amplify the endogenous mRNA for β3, bands from the endogenous mRNA were not visible in wild-type HMEC-1 cells under the conditions used to amplify the sense and antisense fragments, consistent with the higher expression levels of the fragments from the viral promoters in the pCEP-4 expression vector.Table IIntegrin levels of HMEC-1 transfectantsHMEC-1 Transfectantαvβ3 levelβ1levelαvβ5 level%%%B pCEP4104 ± 597 ± 491 ± 12E pCEP4102 ± 9100 ± 597 ± 6L pCEP496 ± 6116 ± 6108 ± 102 pCEP4100 ± 5103 ± 2101 ± 43 pCEP4*93 ± 6103 ± 6A β3 240 sense101 ± 7105 ± 7103 ± 51 β3 240 sense103 ± 6104 ± 199 ± 132 β3240 sense106 ± 292 ± 1100 ± 93 β3 240 sense97 ± 4105 ± 1107 ± 29 β3 240 sense99 ± 3111 ± 9113 ± 12W β3 240 antisense69 ± 6103 ± 398 ± 92 β3 240 antisense60 ± 4105 ± 793 ± 610 β3 240 antisense51 ± 4104 ± 4103 ± 817 β3 240 antisense100 ± 4100 ± 395 ± 820 β3 240 antisense*76 ± 5104 ± 1102 ± 46 β3 426 sense*100 ± 68 β3 426 sense*100 ± 7A β3 426 antisense*98 ± 2C β3 426 antisense*92 ± 41 β3 426 antisense*85 ± 53 β3 426 antisense*71 ± 71 β3full-length*98 ± 62 β3full-length*104 ± 33 β3full-length100 ± 68 β3 full-length99 ± 2107 ± 8104 ± 217 β3full-length101 ± 419 β3full-length*105 ± 5Flow cytometry was conducted using either anti-αvβ3 (LM609), anti-β1 (JB1a), or anti-αvβ5 (P1F6) as primary antibody.

The most biologically active pool of TFPI is associated with the vascular endothelium, however, the biochemical mechanisms responsible for its cellular binding are not entirely defined. Proposed cellular binding sites for TFPI include nonspecific association with cell surface glycosaminoglycans and binding to glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins. Here, we report that TFPI binds specifically and saturably to thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) purified from platelet α-granules with an apparentKDof ∼7.5 nm. Binding is inhibited by polyclonal antibodies against TFPI and partially inhibited by the B-7 monoclonal anti-TSP-1 antibody. TFPI bound to immobilized TSP-1 remains an active proteinase inhibitor. Additionally, in solution phase assays measuring TFPI inhibition of factor VIIa/tissue factor catalytic activity, the rate of factor Xa generation was decreased 55% in the presence of TSP-1 compared with TFPI alone. Binding experiments done in the presence of heparin and with altered forms of TFPI suggest that the basic C-terminal region of TFPI is required for TSP-1 binding. The data provide a mechanism for the recruitment and localization of TFPI to extravascular surfaces within a bleeding wound, where it can efficiently down-regulate the procoagulant activity of tissue factor and allow subsequent aspects of platelet-mediated healing to proceed.

TF is a 50 kDa membrane associated protein that binds to plasma factor VII·VIIa forming a catalytic complex that initiates the blood coagulation cascade through activation of factors IX and X, which lead to thrombin generation and fibrin formation. TF procoagulant activity is regulated, in part, by tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). TFPI is a trivalent, Kunitz-type serine proteinase inhibitor that inhibits the active site of factor Xa with the second Kunitz domain and the active site of the factor VIIa·TF catalytic complex with the first Kunitz domain. The third Kunitz domain does not have an identified function (1Girard T.J. Warren L.A. Novotny W.F. Likert K.M. Brown S.G. Miletich J.P. Broze Jr., G.J. Nature. 1989; 338: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Following the third Kunitz domain, TFPI has a highly basic C-terminal region that is required for rapid inhibition of factor Xa by the second Kunitz domain (2Wesselschmidt R. Likert K. Girard T.

Invest. 1995; 95: 1773-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although antithrombin has also been shown to inhibit factor VIIa in vitro (6Kondo S. Kisiel W. Thromb. Res. 1987; 46: 325-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), TFPI is the only proteinase inhibitor that down-regulates TF procoagulant activity at physiologically relevant rates (7Lawson J.H.

When used as a therapeutic agent, TFPI has been shown to prevent disseminated intravascular coagulation and death from Escherichia coli sepsis in baboons (10Creasey A.A. Chang A.C. Feigen L. Wun T.C. Taylor Jr., F.B. Hinshaw L.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2850-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) and to attenuate endotoxin-induced coagulation in humans (11de Jonge E. Dekkers P.E.

It appears that the majority of TFPI is produced by endothelial cells and remains associated with the endothelial surface (12Ameri A. Kuppuswamy M.N. Basu S. Bajaj S.P. Blood. 1992; 79: 3219-3226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ott I. Miyagi Y. Miyazaki K. Heeb M.J. Mueller B.M. Rao L.V. Ruf W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 874-882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This pool of TFPI contains an intact basic C-terminal region and is thought to be localized and oriented on the cell surface in a manner that allows it to simultaneously inhibit factor VIIa and factor Xa prior to dissociation of the newly activated factor X from the factor VIIa·TF catalytic complex (14Baugh R.J. Broze Jr., G.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4378-4386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that TFPI is most effective as a surface-bound inhibitor of blood coagulation. However, the mechanisms responsible for TFPI binding to the endothelium are not entirely defined. Because heparin infusion results in a 2- to 10-fold increase in the circulating TFPI concentration (15Sandset P.M. Abildgaard U. Larsen M.L. Thromb. Res. 1988; 50: 803-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 16Novotny W.F. Brown S.G. Miletich J.P. Rader D.J. Broze Jr., G.J.

Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), nonspecific interactions with glycosaminoglycans are often cited as a primary mode of cell surface association. However, there is a growing body of evidence indicating that a portion of endothelial-associated TFPI is bound to glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins in a manner that is not dependent on glycosaminoglycans or altered by heparin (13Ott I.

We have previously shown that glypican-3, a GPI-anchored proteoglycan, binds specifically to TFPI and that the binding is likely mediated by its protein core (20Mast A.E. Higuchi D.A. Huang Z.F.

In addition to being associated with the endothelium, TFPI is also present in circulating plasma and within platelets. The plasma form of TFPI is largely associated with lipoproteins and is variably C-terminally truncated (21Broze Jr., G.J. Lange G.W. Duffin K.L. MacPhail L. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 5: 551-559PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the reduced anticoagulant activity of circulating TFPI, it is not thought to be an importantin vivo inhibitor of TF initiated coagulation (21Broze Jr., G.J. Lange G.W. Duffin K.L. MacPhail L. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 5: 551-559PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hansen J.B. Huseby K.R. Huseby N.E. Ezban M. Nordoy A. Thromb. Res. 1997; 85: 413-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The TFPI in platelets represents about 8% (8 ng/ml) of the total TFPI in whole blood and is released after platelet activation. Platelet TFPI has an intact basic C-terminal region and may account for the increasing TFPI concentrations found in blood samples obtained from the site of a template bleeding time wound (23Novotny W.F. Girard T.J. Miletich J.P. Broze Jr., G.J. Blood. 1988; 72: 2020-2025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because TFPI is thought to be a surface-associated inhibitor of coagulation, we investigated the mechanisms through which TFPI may down-regulate factor VIIa·TF catalytic activity in the extravascular space after vascular injury. We examined the interaction of TFPI with platelet α-granule proteins and found that TFPI binds specifically and saturably to thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1). TSP-1 accounts for about 25% of the protein within platelet α-granules and is secreted when platelets are activated at sites of vascular injury (24Baenziger N.L. Brodie G.N. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2723-2731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After secretion, TSP-1 is a transient component of the inflammatory extracellular matrix of healing wounds (25Raugi G.J. Olerud J.E. Gown A.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1987; 89: 551-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26DiPietro L.A. Nissen N.N. Gamelli R.L. Koch A.E. Pyle J.M. Polverini P.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 1851-1860PubMed Google Scholar) and also binds to several cell surface integrins (27Lawler J. Hynes R.O. Blood. 1989; 74: 2022-2027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lawler J.

J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1513-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The binding interaction between TFPI and TSP-1 described here suggests that TSP-1 released from platelet α-granules also acts to localize TFPI to surfaces within the extravascular space, where it can efficiently down-regulate TF-initiated coagulation after vascular injury. Recombinant full-length human TFPI produced inEscherichia coli was a gift of the Chiron Corp. (Emeryville, CA) and the Searle Corp. (Skokie, IL). TFPI-160, an altered form of TFPI truncated after Gly-160, was produced in E. coli and purified as described previously (5Warshawsky I. Bu G. Mast A. Saffitz J.E. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1773-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal and 2H8 monoclonal anti-TFPI antibodies and K1K2C, an altered form of TFPI containing the first two Kunitz domains and the basic C-terminal region, were gifts of Dr. George Broze, Jr. (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Specifically, the K1K2C form of TFPI contains a Met-Ala-Asp-Ser sequence connected to Glu-15 at the N terminus. The protein is then truncated at Gly-150 following the second Kunitz domain, and the basic C-terminal region (amino acids from Phe-243 to Met-276) is attached. Rabbit polyclonal anti-TSP-1 antibodies were from NeoMarkers (Freemont, CA). The anti-TSP-1 B-7 monoclonal antibody and rabbit polyclonal anti-fibronectin antibodies were from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Human factors VIIa and X were from Enzyme Research (South Bend, IN). RecombiPlasTin recombinant TF was from Ortho Diagnostic Systems Inc. (Raritan, NJ). Bovine serum albumin (A3912) was from Sigma. Thrombin was from Hematologic Technologies (Essex Junction, VT). Human Type I collagen was a gift of Dr. David Brand, Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Memphis, TN). Fresh frozen plasma was obtained from the Memphis Veterans Affairs Hospital Blood Bank. Platelet α-granule proteins were obtained by thrombin stimulation of 6-day-old (freshly outdated) apheresis platelets (LifeBlood, Memphis, TN) as described by Frazier and Santoro (32Santoro S.A. Frazier W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In brief, the platelets were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5.5 mm glucose at 23 °C and resuspended in the same buffer at a concentration of 1 × 1010 platelets/ml. Thrombin was added to 0.5 unit/ml, and the platelets were rocked gently. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to 1 mm final concentration immediately after visual observation of platelet aggregation, which typically occurred 1–2 min after the addition of thrombin. Calcium chloride was added to 1 mm final concentration, and the secreted α-granule proteins were separated from the activated platelets by ultracentrifugation at 25,000 rpm in a SW40Ti rotor (56,000 × g) for 1 h at 4 °C. TSP-1 was purified from the α-granule preparations by gelatin agarose, heparin agarose, and gel filtration chromatography as described (32Santoro S.A. Frazier W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In some experiments TSP-1 purchased from Hematologic Technologies was used. Proteins were analyzed using continuous 5–15% linear gradient gels in the 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol/glycine/HCl buffer system described by Bury (33Bury A. J. Chromatogr. 1981; 213: 491-500Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Prior to electrophoresis, some samples were mixed with sample buffer containing 1% SDS but not boiled or reduced, whereas others were boiled for 3 min in the presence of 1% SDS and 50 mm dithiothreitol as indicated. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH) and incubated in 3% (w/v) non-fat milk reconstituted in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h to block nonspecific protein binding sites. TFPI was added to a final concentration of 20 nm and incubated for 2 h at 23 °C. The nitrocellulose was washed three times in the above buffer and then incubated for 2 h with a 1/1000 dilution of the polyclonal anti-TFPI antibody. After washing, the nitrocellulose was incubated for 1 h with anti-(rabbit-IgG)-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) and then reacted with hydrogen peroxide and diaminobenzidine (Sigma) to develop color. This assay has been described and characterized in detail previously (20Mast A.E. Higuchi D.A. Huang Z.F. Warshawsky I. Schwartz A.L. Broze Jr., G.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327(Pt 2): 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Samples of TSP-1 (100 μl), prepared as described for SDS-PAGE, were blotted on nitrocellulose with a Minifold II slot-blot system (Schleicher & Schuell). After blotting, the nitrocellulose was incubated in 3% (w/v) non-fat milk and TFPI binding was detected as described above for the TFPI ligand blots. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunostained with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. Proteins were visualized using hydrogen peroxide and diaminobenzidine or ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK). TFPI, was iodinated using either Iodobeads or Iodogen according to instructions provided by the manufacturer (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL). The concentration of the 125I-TFPI was determined by titration with factor Xa and comparison to a stock of unlabeled TFPI of known concentration. A microtiter plate assay was developed to measure direct binding of TFPI to purified proteins and to further characterize the interaction between TFPI and TSP-1. The recombinant TFPI produced in E. coli used in these experiments binds nonspecifically to a wide variety of laboratory plastics. Therefore, this assay was extensively characterized to minimize nonspecific binding to the microtiter plate. Nonspecific binding to the plate was prevented by performing all binding assays in a non-tissue culture, polystyrene 96-well plate (Costar, Corning, NY) in the presence of 5% BSA. Under the conditions of the assay, 95% of the nonspecific125I-TFPI binding was blocked. This concentration of BSA was more effective than either 5% non-fat milk or 10% fetal calf serum, which blocked only 63% and 65% of the nonspecific binding, respectively. Fluid phase 125I-TFPI bound to wells coated with passively adsorbed TSP-1 in amounts ∼10-fold higher than the background binding observed in wells coated with 5% BSA. The background binding of 125I-TFPI to 5% BSA was measured in each experiment and subtracted from the total bound to determine the specific TFPI bound in all data presented. The interaction between TFPI and TSP-1 was characterized by adsorbing 0.2 ml of TSP-1 or human Type I collagen at 4 μg/ml for 2 h at 37 °C, to a non-tissue culture-treated, 96-well polystyrene plate in Hepes-buffered saline with 1 mm calcium chloride, pH 7.4 (HBS). In some experiments 0.2 ml of non-diluted plasma was adsorbed to the plate. The plate was washed three times with HBS and blocked for 1 h with HBS containing 5% BSA. 125I-TFPI was added at the indicated concentrations for 2 h at 37 °C in HBS buffer containing 5% BSA. In experiments using antibodies, the antibodies directed against TSP-1 and fibronectin were added to the reaction mixture to a final dilution of 1:10 of the material supplied by the manufacturer. The anti-TFPI polyclonal antibody was used at a 1:10 dilution of non-purified, immune rabbit serum. The anti-TFPI 2H8 monoclonal antibody was used at a final concentration of 800 μg/ml. In some experiments 5 mm EDTA, various concentrations of heparin (Fujisawa USA, Deerfield, IL), unlabeled TFPI, TFPI-160, K1K2C, or TSP-1 were added to the reaction mixture. TFPI inhibition of factor VIIa·TF activity was measured using a two-step assay similar to that described by others (14Baugh R.J. Broze Jr., G.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4378-4386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 34Wojtukiewicz M.Z. Zacharski L.R. Rucinska M. Zimnoch L. Jaromin J. Rozanska-Kudelska M. Kisiel W. Kudryk B.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 1659-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 35Pendurthi U.R. Rao L.V. Williams J.T. Idell S. Blood. 1999; 94: 579-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TFPI activity was measured both after binding to immobilized TSP-1 in the microtiter plate assay and in solution in the presence and absence of soluble TSP-1. In both assays, recombinant tissue factor, prepared according to manufacturer's instructions and diluted 1:10,000 to make a working stock, 0.2 nm human factor VIIa, and 20 nm human factor X were mixed in the presence of 50 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% BSA (pH 7.4) and allowed to generate factor Xa for 30 min. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 100 mm EDTA after 30 min. The amount of factor Xa generated from this reaction was measured by monitoring cleavage of 500 μm Spectrozyme Xa (methoxycarbonyl-d-cyclohexylglycyl-glycyl-arginine-p-nitroanilide acetate; American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT). When the activity of TFPI bound to immobilized TSP-1 was measured, the plate was prepared with non-radiolabeled TFPI (2 nm) bound as described for the microtiter plate assay. In the assays using soluble proteins, 5 nm TFPI and the indicated concentrations of TSP-1 were added. Platelet activation and the secretion of α-granule proteins is a key component of hemostasis and vascular wound healing. We hypothesized that one or more platelet α-granule proteins may function to localize TFPI to extravascular surfaces after vascular injury. TFPI ligand blots of platelet α-granule proteins separated by non-reducing, non-boiled SDS-PAGE demonstrated that TFPI bound to several high molecular weight proteins present in the platelet α-granule preparations (Fig.1, lane 2). In a control experiment, Western analysis of the platelet α-granule preparations for TFPI did not demonstrate any bands, indicating that the proteins identified in the ligand blot did not represent platelet TFPI, which is also secreted from thrombin-stimulated platelets (23Novotny W.F. Girard T.J. Miletich J.P. Broze Jr., G.J. Blood. 1988; 72: 2020-2025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). In an initial attempt to identify the protein(s) binding to TFPI, platelet α-granule proteins were applied to heparin agarose and eluted with a 0.15–2 m NaCl gradient. When the column fractions were analyzed, a single band, eluting at ∼0.5 mNaCl and migrating with an apparent molecular mass of >200,000 Da, bound to TFPI in the ligand blot assay while the lower molecular weight proteins eluted with the column flow-through (data not shown). Because TSP-1 is a high molecular weight α-granule protein that elutes from heparin agarose at ∼0.5 m NaCl, Western analysis of the platelet α-granule proteins using a polyclonal antibody for TSP-1 was performed. This revealed a pattern of high molecular mass bands nearly identical to that seen in the TFPI ligand blot (compare lanes 2 and 3 in Fig. 1) and indicated that TFPI bound to full-length TSP-1 as well as fragments of TSP-1 that lack the N-terminal, heparin binding domain. Because there are multiple platelet α-granule proteins that did not bind to TFPI in the ligand blot assay (compare lanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 1), these data suggest that TSP-1 is the primary TFPI binding protein in the platelet α-granule preparations. It is possible that a second high molecular weight protein with a migration pattern similar to TSP-1 also bound to TFPI, however, no proteins other than TSP-1 were detected in TFPI ligand blot analysis of platelet α-granule proteins fractionated by either heparin agarose or ion exchange (MonoQ) chromatography (data not shown). When the TFPI ligand blot was repeated using purified TSP-1, binding of TFPI was again observed (Fig.2 A, lane 4). Purified TSP-1, under reducing and non-reducing conditions, is shown inlanes 1 and 2 of Fig. 2 A to demonstrate that there are no detectable contaminating proteins that migrate similar to non-reduced TSP-1 present in the purified material. Thus, the binding of TFPI to non-reduced TSP-1 observed in lane 4 is not due to a contaminating protein. When the ligand blot was performed under reducing conditions, TFPI binding was not reliably detected. To determine the effect of reduction and SDS treatment, TFPI binding to purified TSP-1 after various treatments was measured in a slot blot assay (Fig. 2 B). In this assay, binding to reduced and reduced and boiled TSP-1 was consistently observed, whereas binding to reduced TSP-1 in 1% SDS was greatly reduced. Thus, it appeared that TFPI bound to the reduced subunits of TSP-1 but not in the presence of SDS. When increasing amounts of125I-TFPI are added to wells containing immobilized TSP-1, binding appeared to saturate at ∼40 nm (Fig.3 A). Analysis of these data with a double reciprocal plot yielded an estimated apparentKD of 26.9 nm (data not shown). However, this assay tends to underestimate the apparent KDdue to dissociation of TFPI during washing steps. Therefore, the binding of 5 nm125I-TFPI was measured in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled TFPI. A significant reduction in binding of 125I-TFPI was observed in the presence of 10 nm unlabeled TFPI. The apparentKD, estimated from the point where binding of125I-TFPI was decreased by 50%, is ∼7.5 nm(Fig. 3 B). Binding of 2.5 nm125I-TFPI to immobilized TSP-1 was compared with that of immobilized plasma and immobilized human Type I collagen. As shown in Fig.4 A, significantly more (5- to 10-fold) 125I-TFPI binding occurs in the TSP-1-coated wells than to either collagen- or plasma-coated wells. Binding of TFPI to plasma proteins was further investigated by performing slot blot analysis of plasma fractionated by Superose 6 gel filtration chromatography and TFPI ligand blot analysis of plasma proteins separated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. These assays did not demonstrate any proteins present in plasma that bound exogenously added TFPI. Endogenous plasma TFPI bound to plasma lipoproteins was detected in these assays (data not shown). These findings are consistent with the low binding of 125I-TFPI to plasma observed in the microtiter plate assay and the very low concentration of TSP-1 present in circulating blood. When purified TSP-1 was added to plasma and the mixture separated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE, TFPI bound to TSP-1 in the ligand blot assay (data not shown). Binding of 125I-TFPI was confirmed using TSP-1 purchased from Hematologic Technologies. No differences in binding were observed between TSP-1 purified in our laboratory and the commercially prepared material (data not shown). Polyclonal anti-TFPI antibodies and the monoclonal 2H8 anti-TFPI antibody blocked the binding of 5 nm125I-TFPI to TSP-1 in the microtiter plate assay by 71% and 57%, respectively. Polyclonal anti-TSP-1 antibodies did not block binding, however, the monoclonal B7 anti-TSP-1 antibody reduced 125I-TFPI binding by 33% (Fig.4 B). A 100-fold molar excess of soluble TSP-1 reduced the binding of 125I-TFPI to immobilized TSP-1 by 51% (Fig.4 B). Because TSP-1 undergoes a conformational change upon binding to calcium, 1 mm calcium chloride was included in all buffers used in the microtiter plate assay. When the binding interaction was examined in the presence of 5 mm EDTA,125I-TFPI binding was not affected (data not shown). Because both TFPI and TSP-1 are heparin binding proteins, the binding of 125I-TFPI to TSP-1 in the presence of varying heparin concentrations was measured. As demonstrated in Fig.5, 125I-TFPI binding in the presence of heparin concentrations ranging from 0.0001 to 0.1 unit/ml was not significantly different from that observed in the absence of heparin. However, in the presence of 1 unit/ml heparin, binding was reduced to 20%, and 10 units/ml heparin reduced binding to slightly below the background binding observed in the presence of 5% BSA with no TSP-1 adsorbed to the plate. The ability of heparin to block binding suggests that the basic C-terminal region of TFPI is required for binding to TSP-1. Two altered forms of TFPI were used to further investigate the role of the C-terminal domain. TFPI-160 is truncated after Gly-160 and contains the first two Kunitz domains but lacks the third Kunitz domain and the C-terminal region, whereas K1K2C contains the first two Kunitz domains and the C-terminal region but lacks the third Kunitz domain. SDS-PAGE of full-length TFPI, TFPI-160, and K1K2C is shown in Fig. 6 A. Western analysis, using an antibody that recognizes only the C-terminal region of TFPI, confirmed that the full-length TFPI and K1K2C contain the C-terminal region, whereas the TFPI-160 does not (Fig.6 A). The K1K2C has a larger predicted molecular weight than TFPI-160, but it migrates more rapidly in SDS-PAGE. The reason for this behavior is not known. A 100-fold molar excess of TFPI-160 had no effect on the binding of 125I-TFPI to TSP-1, whereas a 100-fold molar excess of K1K2C decreased binding to 15% (Fig.6 B), demonstrating that the C-terminal region of TFPI has a critical role in the binding of TFPI to TSP-1. The microtiter plate assay was performed using unlabeled TFPI. In these experiments the relative amount of TFPI bound to either immobilized TSP-1 or BSA was measured using the TF inhibition assay. In wells coated with TSP-1, there was a 60% reduction in the amount of factor Xa generated compared with wells coated with 5% BSA (data not shown). These data demonstrate that the TFPI binding to TSP-1 observed in the microtiter plate assays is not an artifact induced by the radiolabeling of TFPI and, importantly, they indicate that TFPI bound to immobilized TSP-1 remains an active proteinase inhibitor. To determine the effect of soluble TSP-1 on TFPI inhibitory activity, rates of factor Xa generation by factor VIIa·TF were measured in the presence of 5 nm TFPI and a range of TSP-1 concentrations from 0 to 100 nm (TableI). When TSP-1 and TFPI were at equimolar (5 nm) concentration, there was no effect on the rate of factor Xa generation. However, when TSP-1 was present at 50 nm, the rate of factor Xa generation decreased by over 50%. This appeared to be a saturating amount of TSP-1, because the rate of factor Xa generation did not slow further in the presence of 100 nm TSP-1.Table IRate of factor VIIa · TF-mediated generation of factor Xa in the presence of TFPI and various concentrations of TSP-1TFPITSP-1Factor Xa generated/minnMpmol0056501004055024.35526.655010.7510011.1Average of duplicate measurements. Open table in a new tab Average of duplicate measurements. TSP-1 is a 450-kDa protein with affinity for cell surfaces and extracellular matrix proteins. It consists of three identical 150-kDa subunits linked by disulfide bonds. Each subunit is made up of a linear series of functional domains, including an ∼30-kDa N-terminal heparin binding domain, regions homologous to procollagen, properdin, and epidermal growth factor, a calcium binding domain, and a C-terminal domain (36Bornstein P. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3290-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Cultured endothelial cells (37Mosher D.F. Doyle M.J. Jaffe E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), fibroblasts (38Jaffe E.A. Ruggiero J.T. Leung L.K. Doyle M.J. McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 998-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and monocytes (39Jaffe E.A. Ruggiero J.T. Falcone D.J. Blood. 1985; 65: 79-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) synthesize and secrete TSP-1. In vivo, it is transiently expressed in skin wounds and is incorporated into the extracellular matrix of healing tissues (25Raugi G.J. Olerud J.E. Gown A.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1987; 89: 551-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26DiPietro L.A. Nissen N.N. Gamelli R.L. Koch A.E. Pyle J.M. Polverini P.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 1851-1860PubMed Google Scholar). As a result of its complex structure and properties, multiple potential functions have been proposed for TSP-1. We have demonstrated that TFPI binds to TSP-1 purified from platelet α-granules in three separate assays, a ligand blot after SDS-PAGE, a slot blot assay, and a microtiter plate assay. Additionally, TFPI bound to immobilized TSP-1 remains functionally active and soluble TSP-1 enhances the ability of TFPI to inhibit factor Xa generation by the factor VIIa·TF catalytic complex. Although we cannot absolutely rule out binding to another high molecular weight α-granule protein, the data suggest that TSP-1 is the only TFPI binding protein present in either platelet α-granules or plasma. In plasma, a C-terminally truncated form of TFPI circulates associated with lipoproteins. However, exogenously added, full-length TFPI does not bind to plasma lipoproteins with high affinity (40Valentin S. Nordfang O. Bregengard C. Wildgoose P. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1993; 4: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and we could not identify any plasma protein to which TFPI binds in the ligand blot after SDS-PAGE, slot blot, or microtiter plate assays. Additionally, TFPI does not bind to human Type I collagen, a prominent protein in the extracellular matrix that could potentially compete with TSP-1 for binding TFPI. The affinity of TFPI for numerous other extracellular matrix proteins remains to be determined. The binding of TFPI to immobilized TSP-1 is saturable with an estimated apparent KD of ∼7.5 nm. This KD indicates that TFPI binds to TSP-1 more avidly than it does to its cellular degradation receptor on hepatocytes, the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, (apparent KD ∼30 nm) (41Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and is within the physiological range of TFPI concentration that would be present at the site of a vascular wound. The binding of 125I-TFPI to immobilized TSP-1 is readily blocked by both polyclonal anti-TFPI antibodies and the monoclonal 2H8 anti-TFPI antibody. However, anti-TSP antibodies are much less effective at blocking binding. This suggests that TFPI may preferentially bind to surface-associated TSP-1, perhaps via a cryptic epitope of TSP-1 that is fully exposed after surface binding. This hypothesis is supported by the high concentration of soluble TSP-1 (500 nm) required to block 50% of the binding of 5 nm TFPI to immobilized TSP-1 (Fig. 4 B) and the 50-fold excess of TSP-1 necessary for accelerated inhibition of factor Xa generation by TFPI in the solution phase TF inhibition assay (TableI). Experiments were performed to define structural characteristics of TSP-1 and TFPI that are important for the binding interaction. Although TSP-1 undergoes a distinct conformational change upon binding calcium (42Lawler J. Chao F.C. Cohen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12257-12265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Lawler J. Simons E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12098-12101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 125I-TFPI binding was not affected when the microtiter plate assay was performed in 5 mm EDTA. This is similar to the binding of plasminogen, fibrinogen, and fibronectin to TSP-1 which also are not dependent on calcium (44Silverstein R.L. Leung L.L. Harpel P.C. Nachman R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 1625-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 45Lahav J. Lawler J. Gimbrone M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 145: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) but different from TSP-1 binding to cellular binding sites, which tend to be calcium-dependent (28Lawler J. Weinstein R. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2351-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). It appears that TFPI binds to the individual 150-kDa subunits of TSP-1, because TFPI bound to reduced TSP-1 in the slot blot assay, however, the binding domain on TSP-1 remains to be localized. Heparin, at concentrations above 0.1 unit/ml, greatly reduced the binding of 125I-TFPI to TSP-1 in the microtiter plate assay. This is likely due to heparin blocking an interaction between the basic C-terminal region of TFPI and TSP-1 based on the following interpretation of the data. First, the experiments with the altered forms of TFPI strongly indicated that the C-terminal region of TFPI was required for binding to TSP-1. K1K2C, a form of TFPI that is missing the third Kunitz domain but has the C-terminal region, competed with 125I-TFPI for binding to TSP-1 in the microtiter plate assay, whereas TFPI-160, a form of TFPI that is missing both the third Kunitz domain and the C-terminal region, did not (Fig. 6 B). Second, it appeared that the heparin binding domain of TSP-1 was not required for binding to TFPI. In the TFPI ligand blot of platelet α-granule proteins, TFPI bound to partially degraded forms of TSP-1 (Fig. 1). However, none of the degraded forms of TSP-1 bound to heparin agarose, suggesting that the thrombin used to activate the platelets cleaved the N-terminal, heparin binding domain of these fragments (46Lawler J.W. Slayter H.S. Thromb. Res. 1981; 22: 267-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 47Dixit V.M. Grant G.A. Santoro S.A. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10100-10105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, a portion of TSP-1, other than the heparin binding domain, is likely involved in binding TFPI. Although it appears that the majority of endogenously bound TFPI on cultured endothelial cells is associated with a GPI-anchored protein and is not released from the cell surface with heparin (13Ott I. Miyagi Y. Miyazaki K. Heeb M.J. Mueller B.M. Rao L.V. Ruf W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 874-882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), TSP-1 is made by endothelial cells in culture and TFPI bound to endothelial TSP-1 may account for a portion of the TFPI released into the circulation after heparin infusion. It is well established that TFPI is a key regulator of TF-induced coagulation in vivo. The in utero death of mice lacking the first Kunitz domain of TFPI due to disseminated intravascular coagulation demonstrates that TFPI has a critical role in maintaining the anticoagulant properties of the endothelium (48Huang Z.F. Higuchi D. Lasky N. Broze Jr., G.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 944-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The intravascular function of TFPI is likely down-regulation of factor VIIa·TF activity transiently present on endothelial cells or monocytes that have been stimulated by inflammatory cytokines. However, under normal conditions, TF is predominantly expressed in extravascular locations surrounding the blood vessels where TFPI is not typically located. Because plasma TFPI is largely truncated at the C terminus and a poor inhibitor of blood clotting (21Broze Jr., G.J. Lange G.W. Duffin K.L. MacPhail L. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 5: 551-559PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hansen J.B. Huseby K.R. Huseby N.E. Ezban M. Nordoy A. Thromb. Res. 1997; 85: 413-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), down-regulation of extravascular TF initiated coagulation by TFPI most likely requires the release of TFPI from activated platelets or the transfer of endothelial associated TFPI into the extravascular space. Because TSP-1 accounts for approximately 25% of the platelet α-granule protein secreted at sites of vascular injury (24Baenziger N.L. Brodie G.N. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2723-2731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that TSP-1 contributes to hemostasis within the wound site, but its exact role is not clear. TSP-1-deficient mice do not have bleeding diatheses, and their platelets aggregate normally in response to thrombin (49Lawler J. Sunday M. Thibert V. Duquette M. George E.L. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 982-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). However, TSP-1 is involved in the early organization of the extracellular matrix of healing wounds (25Raugi G.J. Olerud J.E. Gown A.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1987; 89: 551-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26DiPietro L.A. Nissen N.N. Gamelli R.L. Koch A.E. Pyle J.M. Polverini P.J. Am. J.

We propose that TSP-1 secreted by platelets plays an important role in recruiting and localizing TFPI to surfaces within the extravascular matrix. Once localized, it can efficiently down-regulate the procoagulant activity of TF, which initiates blood clotting within the wound, and allow subsequent aspects of platelet-mediated healing to proceed. As mentioned above, TSP-1 is an adhesive, multifunctional protein with many proposed functional roles. The in vitro data presented here indicate that a binding interaction between TFPI and TSP-1 likely occurs at the site of a bleeding wound and that binding to TSP-1 enhances TFPI inhibitory activity. Further characterization of itsin vivo importance is warranted."

To further explore this working model, we have investigated the regulation of host and recombinant DLK in NIH3T3 and COS-1 cells undergoing apoptosis. Using calphostin C, a potent and selective inhibitor of protein kinase C and a recognized apoptosis inducer for various cell types, we demonstrate, by immunoblot analysis, that DLK protein levels are rapidly and dramatically down-regulated during the early phases of apoptosis. Down-regulation in calphostin C-treated cells was also accompanied by the appearance of SDS- and mercaptoethanol-resistant high molecular weight DLK immunoreactive oligomers. Experiments aimed at elucidating the mechanism(s) underlying DLK oligomerization revealed that the tissue transglutaminase (tTG) inhibitor monodansylcadaverine antagonized the effects of calphostin C almost completely, thereby suggesting the involvement of a tTG-catalyzed reaction as the root cause of DLK down-regulation and accumulation as high molecular weight species. In support of this notion, we also show that DLK can serve as a substrate for tTG-dependent cross-linking in vitro and that this covalent post-translational modification leads to the functional inactivation of DLK.

Once activated, these signal-transducing kinases transit from their primary subcellular location to the nucleus where they phosphorylate specific Ser-Pro and Thr-Pro motifs on transcription factors, which in turn regulate the expression of prescribed sets of downstream effector genes. Phosphorylation of transcription factors by members of the JNK family is an integrative and dynamic process, capable of eliciting an up- or down-regulation of gene expression, depending on the transcription factor(s) targeted (1Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar, 2Leppa S. Bohmann D.

Like the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 subfamilies of MAPKs, the activation of JNKs requires the phosphorylation of two conserved threonine and tyrosine residues in subdomain VIII of their catalytic domains: a process catalyzed by the dual specificity MAPK kinases (MKKs) MKK4 (4Lin A.

The latter are themselves substrates for activation by upstream MAPK kinase kinases (MKKKs). Examples of JNK MKKKs identified in mammalian cells include the MAPK/ERK kinase kinases (MEKKs), transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase, tumor progression locus-2, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, and the mixed lineage kinases (MLKs) (7Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Widmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar).The MLK family of MKKKs is composed of five distinct members, designated MLK1, MLK2, MLK3, DLK (also known as MUK and ZPK), and LZK, which share several unique structural features. These include a “hybrid” catalytic domain bearing amino acid and structural motifs found in serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases and two leucine/isoleucine zipper motifs and a proline-rich carboxyl-terminal domain surmised to be intimately involved in facilitating protein/protein interactions (8Dorow D.S.

Other motifs important for protein binding have also been identified in the MLK family members. For example, MLK2 and MLK3 both contain a Src homology 3 domain in their respective amino-terminal regions. These domains bind the GTPase dynamin and the Ste20-related protein kinase HPK1, respectively (18Rasmussen R.K. Rusak J. Price G. Robinson P.J. Simpson R.J. Dorow D.S. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar,19Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Both kinases also possess functional Cdc42/Rac interactive binding motifs that mediate association with Cdc42 and Rac1 in a GTP-dependent manner (20Nagata K. Puls A. Futter C. Aspenstrom P. Schaefer E. Nakata T. Hirokawa N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 21Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Miyata H. Igishi T. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27225-27228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Examples of other proteins capable of interacting with the carboxyl-terminal region of MLK2 have recently been identified using the yeast two-hybrid system and include the Ca2+-binding protein hippocalcin, 14-3-3ε protein, and several members of the kinesin family of microtubule motor proteins (20Nagata K. Puls A. Futter C. Aspenstrom P. Schaefer E. Nakata T. Hirokawa N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The biological significance of these associations, however, remains to be determined.Despite our increasing knowledge regarding the involvement of MLKs in the JNK signaling cascade, relatively little is known about their physiological roles in mammalian cells or about the mechanisms responsible for their regulation in response to various stimuli. In this regard, recent studies from our laboratory have provided evidence in support of a role for the MLK family member DLK in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation, particularly during the process of tissue remodeling. This working model was originally formulated following the observation that DLK expression is not ubiquitously distributed during mouse embryogenesis, but is highest and apparently restricted to tissues where terminal cell differentiation is ongoing or where cell proliferation has strongly declined (22Nadeau A. Grondin G. Blouin R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Subsequent reports have further revealed a strong correlation between DLK expression and tissue regeneration (23Matsui N. Sarkar G. Shuto T. Marrs J. Bronk J.T. Mizuno K. Bolander M.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 24Douziech M. Grondin G. Loranger A. Marceau N. Blouin R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In more recent studies, transfection and overexpression of DLK was shown to induce dramatic growth inhibition in several cell types, including fibroblasts (25Bergeron P. Douziech M. Daigle N. Blouin R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 153-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and primary cultured human keratinocytes (26Germain, L., Fradette, J., Robitaille, H., Guignard, R., Grondin, G., Nadeau, A., and Blouin, R. (2000) J. Invest. Dermatol., in press.Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the latter case, the ectopic expression of DLK led to the induction of terminal differentiation (26Germain, L., Fradette, J., Robitaille, H., Guignard, R., Grondin, G., Nadeau, A., and Blouin, R. (2000) J. Invest. Dermatol., in press.Google Scholar). Although DLK, like most other signaling molecules, might carry out different functions depending on cellular context and microenvironment, these data, when considered in sum, strongly support a role for this kinase during such pivotal biological processes as cell growth, cell differentiation and/or cell survival.In the present report, we investigated this working notion further by studying the regulation of DLK activity during apoptosis. To this end, cultures of NIH 3T3 and DLK-transfected COS-1 cells were exposed to calphostin C, a potent and selective inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC) (27Bruns R.F. Miller F.D. Merriman R.L. Howbert J.J. Heath W.F. Kobayashi E. Takahashi I. Tamaoki T. Nakano H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Calphostin C exposure concurrently leads to activation of JNK (28Ozaki I. Tani E. Ikemoto H. Kitagawa H. Fujikawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5310-5317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and induces apoptotic cell death in various cellular backgrounds (29Ikemoto H. Tani E. Matsumoto T. Nakano A. Furuyama J. J. Neurosurg. 1995; 83: 1008-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 30Zhu D.M. Narla R.K. Fang W.H. Chia N.C. Uckun F.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 2967-2976PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrate that calphostin C-mediated apoptosis is characterized, in both cellular backgrounds, by a rapid and dramatic down-regulation of DLK during the early phases of cell death, that this event is paralleled by the accumulation of high molecular weight DLK polymers, and that the formation of DLK oligomers is almost completely antagonized by monodansylcadaverine, a specific inhibitor of the Ca2+-dependent cross-linking enzyme tissue transglutaminase (tTG) (31Chen J.S. Mehta K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 817-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 32Melino G. Piacentini M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We also show that DLK oligomers can be generated in vitro in the presence of purified tTG and that transglutamination results in altered kinase activity.DISCUSSIONAlthough advances over the past few years have contributed to our general understanding of how the mixed lineage kinase DLK regulates JNK signaling, little is currently known about the mechanisms affecting its own regulation, about the proteins it is most likely to interact with within the cell, and about its physiological function(s). However, the documented involvement of JNK-dependent signaling events during cell growth and apoptosis implies equally important, or at the very least, supportive roles for involvement of DLK in the regulation of these cellular processes. In order to verify this working hypothesis, we chose to investigate candidate mechanisms for the regulation of DLK activity in cultured cells induced to undergo apoptosis following exposure to calphostin C. We provide evidence that calphostin C induces a rapid and dramatic decrease in the levels of the 150-kDa membrane/Golgi-associated form of DLK in NIH 3T3, Neuro-2a, and AtT-20 cells as well as in COS-1 cells transiently transfected with a functional DLK expression vector. We also demonstrate that the ability of calphostin C to down-regulate DLK expression is encountered during the early phases of the apoptotic response, namely during that time period preceding activation of JNK phosphorylation and caspase-3 cleavage. We also describe, for the first time, that down-regulation of DLK levels in response to calphostin C is accompanied by the appearance of SDS and mercaptoethanol-resistant high molecular weight DLK species, that this shift in DLK molecular weight is partially suppressed by the tTG inhibitor monodansylcadaverine, that DLK can serve as a substrate for tTG-catalyzed cross-linking reactions in vitro andin vivo, and that transglutamination of DLK leads to a shut-down of its catalytic activity. These findings, therefore, lead us to propose that the mixed lineage kinase DLK is subjected to tTG-dependent post-translational modification during the early phases of apoptosis.Like all transglutaminases, tTG is a Ca2+-dependent cross-linking enzyme that catalyzes the post-translational modification of proteins by transamidation of specific polypeptide-bound glutamines (31Chen J.S. Mehta K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 817-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 32Melino G. Piacentini M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This activity commonly results in the formation of γ-glutamyl-ε-lysine isopeptide bonds within or between polypeptides chains that are of great physiological interest because of their exceptional stability and resistance to mechanical breakage and chemical attack. Although the precise biological functions of tTGs are not fully understood, recent reports from several laboratories have suggested a participative role for protein polymers formed via tTG-catalyzed cross-links during apoptosis (31Chen J.S. Mehta K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 817-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 32Melino G. Piacentini M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In fact, it has been shown that expression and activity of tTG are both substantially increased at the onset of apoptosis in numerous cell types (47Melino G. Draoui M. Bellincampi L. Bernassola F. Bernardini S. Piacentini M. Reichert U. Cohen P. Exp. Cell. Res. 1997; 235: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 48Oliverio S. Amendola A. Rodolfo C. Spinedi A. Piacentini M. J. Biol.

Biotechnol. 1998; 62: 129-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under these circumstances, the activation of tTG in dying cells leads to the formation of specific cross-linked protein polymers that are thought to be involved in some as yet unspecified way during the early and late stages of the apoptotic process (31Chen J.S. Mehta K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 817-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 32Melino G. Piacentini M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Although some of the tTG substrates might presumably be involved in committing cells to apoptosis, others have been found to participate in the assembly of a detergent-insoluble cross-linked protein scaffold that prevents the leakage of macromolecules and inflammatory substances in the surrounding tissues (31Chen J.S. Mehta K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 817-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 32Melino G. Piacentini M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Thus, the up-regulation of tTG activity observed in vitro and in vivo in apoptotic cells might conceivably constitute one of the key elements characterizing or contributing to this particular type of cell death. To our knowledge, the results presented here add, for the first time, a cell survival regulatory protein kinase to the list of known cellular proteins that serve as substrates for tTG in dying cells. Examples of cross-linked protein polymers formed by tTG in cells undergoing programmed cell death include actin, annexin, troponin, involucrin, fibronectin, histone H2B, and the retinoblastoma protein (32Melino G. Piacentini M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 50Autuori F. Farrace M.G. Oliverio S. Piredda L. Piacentini M. Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 1998; 62: 129-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to most of these intracellular proteins, which have also been found to be substrates of the thiol protease caspases and calpains in dying cells (31Chen J.S. Mehta K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 817-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 32Melino G. Piacentini M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), our data indicate that tTG is the major effector element of the apoptotic response acting on the processing of DLK following exposure to calphostin C.The finding that DLK undergoes tTG-dependent polymerization shortly after exposure to calphostin C raises the intriguing possibility that this post-translational modification may constitute a biochemical event implicated in the instructive phase of the apoptotic response. In mammalian cells, initiation of apoptosis usually involves the participation of a series of intracellular signaling molecules among which distinct families of serine/threonine protein kinases, namely MAPKs, PKC, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A, and protein kinase B or Akt, are important components (51Cross T.G. Scheel-Toellner D. Henriquez N.V. Deacon E. Salmon M. Lord J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Although the role played by each of these protein kinases during the regulation of apoptosis is largely influenced by the cell context and the nature of the death stimulus, their involvement can be tentatively categorized as either pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic based on their respective abilities to promote or prevent apoptosis following activation (51Cross T.G. Scheel-Toellner D. Henriquez N.V. Deacon E. Salmon M. Lord J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). With respect to the MAPKs, for example, it is generally assumed that activation of the JNK and p38 kinases promotes apoptosis, whereas induction of ERK activity has been shown to inhibit apoptosis and favor survival (52Jarpe M.B. Widmann C. Knall C. Schlesinger T.K. Gibson S. Yujiri T. Fanger G.R. Gelfand E.W. Johnson G.L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Interestingly, many serine/threonine kinases reported to have either pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic properties have been found to act as caspase substrates during the apoptotic response induced by a wide range of stimuli (53Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 54Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The caspase-dependent cleavage of these proteins triggers the activation of pro-apoptotic kinases, such as MEKK1, PKCδ, or p21-activated kinase (54Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 55Emoto Y. Manome Y. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R.

Science. 1997; 276: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), and the inactivation of anti-apoptotic kinases, such as Akt, PKCζ, or Raf-1 (53Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 57Frutos S. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10765-10770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), an upstream activator of the ERKs. Our demonstration that DLK serves as a substrate for tTG, both in vivo andin vitro, is, therefore, consistent with the possibility that protein polymerization induced by tTG in dying cells could represent another effective way of regulating the activity of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic kinases. Our data showing that the tTG-dependent oligomerization of DLK in vitro is paralleled by its functional inactivation strongly support this notion. Since there is presently no information in the literature concerning the role of DLK during programmed cell death, it is tempting to speculate that the modulation of DLK activity by cross-linking represents an important in vivo mechanism by which tTG regulates cellular growth and apoptosis. Moreover, by virtue of its localization to the Golgi apparatus in NIH 3T3 cells (33Douziech M. Laberge G. Grondin G. Daigle N. Blouin R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), it seems equally plausible that the tTG-dependent oligomerization of DLK in this locale might engender a form of trafficking stress stimulus in this organelle which results in apoptosis. The presence on Golgi membranes of several signaling molecules implicated in the regulation of secretory traffic, cellular growth control and/or apoptosis, including Cdc42, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, PKC, and Fas (58Erickson J.W.

Science. 1998; 282: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), supports the notion that the Golgi complex might function as a sensor and/or integrator for several varieties of stress stimuli (62Mancini M.

Cell. 2000; 101: 693-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).Although the molecular details surrounding DLK oligomerization and catalytic inactivation by tTG remain to be fully defined, it is not unreasonable to suspect that select glutamine and lysine residues located within or in close structural proximity to the catalytic and/or regulatory domains may serve as potential acceptor sites for transglutamination by tTG. The kinase domain of DLK actually contains 7 glutamine and 14 lysine residues, which may act as acyl donors and acceptor substrates, respectively, for tTG-catalyzed reactions.In summary, this report provides strong in vivo and in vitro evidence that the mixed lineage kinase DLK serves as a substrate for tTG in cells undergoing programmed cell death. To our knowledge, these studies also provide the first demonstration that the tTG-dependent oligomerization of a protein kinase exerts a modulatory effect on its activity. Further studies are currently under way to investigate the relevance of these phenomena in an in vivo setting. A variety of extracellular “stress” stimuli responsible for the induction of growth arrest and apoptosis in multicellular organisms are transduced from the cell membrane to the nucleus via a phosphorylation cascade involving members of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)1 subgroup of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (1Ip Y.T.

Once activated, these signal-transducing kinases transit from their primary subcellular location to the nucleus where they phosphorylate specific Ser-Pro and Thr-Pro motifs on transcription factors, which in turn regulate the expression of prescribed sets of downstream effector genes. Phosphorylation of transcription factors by members of the JNK family is an integrative and dynamic process, capable of eliciting an up- or down-regulation of gene expression, depending on the transcription factor(s) targeted (1Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar, 2Leppa S. Bohmann D.

Like the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 subfamilies of MAPKs, the activation of JNKs requires the phosphorylation of two conserved threonine and tyrosine residues in subdomain VIII of their catalytic domains: a process catalyzed by the dual specificity MAPK kinases (MKKs) MKK4 (4Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar) and MKK7 (5Tournier C. Whitmarsh A.J.

The latter are themselves substrates for activation by upstream MAPK kinase kinases (MKKKs). Examples of JNK MKKKs identified in mammalian cells include the MAPK/ERK kinase kinases (MEKKs), transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase, tumor progression locus-2, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, and the mixed lineage kinases (MLKs) (7Fanger G.R.

Pit-1 and Pit-1β constitute such a pair of transcription factor isoforms. Pit-1 enhances the Ras signaling pathway to the prolactin promoter, and Pit-1β represses basal prolactin promoter activity as well as Ras signaling to the prolactin promoter in pituitary cells. We have previously demonstrated that the β-domain amino acid sequence dictates the transcriptional properties of Pit-1β. Here, we show that five hydrophobic β-domain residues are required for Pit-1 isoform-specific repression of Ras signaling, and we demonstrate that sodium butyrate and trichostatin A, pharmacological inhibitors of histone deacetylation, as well as viral Ski protein, a dominant-negative inhibitor of recruitment of N-CoR/mSin3 histone deacetylase complexes, specifically reverse β isoform-specific repression of Ras signaling. Moreover, we directly demonstrate, with a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, that the Pit-1β isoform alters the histone acetylation state of the proximal prolactin promoter. This differential analysis of Pit-1/Pit-1β isoform function provides significant insights into the structural determinants that govern how different transcription factors with identical DNA sequence specificity can display opposite effects on target gene activity.

The molecular mechanisms, by which related transcription factor isoforms with identical DNA sequence specificity mediate distinct transcription responses, remain an area of active investigation. Pit-1 is a pituitary-specific POU homeodomain transcription factor that governs both anterior pituitary cell identity and hormone gene expression (reviewed in Ref. 7Pickett C.A. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Wierman M.E. Diseases of the Pituitary: Diagnosis and Treatment. 3. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 1-31Google Scholar). Pit-1 occurs in vertebrates, including humans, as two principal splice isoforms (Fig. 1). The β isoform arises from an alternative splice-acceptor sequence at the end of the first intron resulting in a 26-amino acid insertion, the β-domain, at position 48 in the TAD, between the first and second exons, TAD1 and TAD2 (Fig. 1) (5Theill L.E. Hattori K. Domenico D. Castrillo J.L. Karin M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2261-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 6Konzak K.E. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The β isoform differs from Pit-1 only in the TAD and displays identical DNA sequence specificity with respect to the prolactin (PRL) promoter (5Theill L.E. Hattori K. Domenico D. Castrillo J.L. Karin M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2261-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) but has dramatically different transcriptional properties than Pit-1, and these differences are dictated by the unique amino acid sequence of the β-domain TAD insertion (8Diamond S.E. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28925-28932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The β-domain insertion causes Pit-1β to act as a pituitary-specific repressor of both of basal transcription of the rat (r) PRL and of Ras signaling to the rPRL promoter gene (reviewed in Ref. 8Diamond S.E. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28925-28932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Additionally, the β-domain blocks functional interaction with Ets-1 (9Bradford A.P. Conrad K.E. Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell.

Guell A. Castrillo J.L. Aranda A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) in nonpituitary cells. Nevertheless, this same 26-amino acid insertion endows Pit-1β with even greater potency with regard to mediation of protein kinase A signaling to the rPRL promoter (8Diamond S.E.

A, the various pRSV HA Pit-1 constructs were introduced into GH4 cells by electroporation. In order to achieve equal levels of protein expression for the various HA Pit-1 constructs, varying amounts of each pRSV Pit-1 DNA were introduced, with pRSV levels held constant by the addition of pRSV β-globin. After 24 h cells were harvested and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot (see “Experimental Procedures”). Lanes were loaded as follows: No pRSV HA Pit-1 (lane 1); 10 μg of pRSV HA Pit-1 (lane 2); 25 μg of pRSV HA Pit-1β (lane 3); 20 μg of pRSV HA Pit-1-ES1 (lane 4); 20 μg of pRSV HA Pit-1-ES2 (lane 5); 10 μg of pRSV HA Pit-1-ES3 (lane 6); 10 μg of pRSV HA Pit-1-ES4 (lane 7); 20 μg of pRSV HA Pit-1-ES5 (lane 8); and 30 μg of pRSV HA Pit-1-ES6 (lane 9). B, mutant and wild-type pRSV Pit-1 constructs were introduced into HeLa nonpituitary cells by electroporation with 3 μg of pA3 PRL luc-425. pRSV HA Pit-1 plasmid DNA amounts were adjusted for equal protein expression. Total pRSV plasmid amount was maintained constant with pRSV β-globin DNA.

We have utilized an epitope-scanning approach to replace sequentially 6 amino acid blocks of the β-domain in order to identify a limited subset of functionally important residues. Replacement of each of these residues with alanine identified five hydrophobic residues that are required for the β-domain to act as a transcriptional repressor of Ras signaling to the rPRL promoter. Moreover, we demonstrate that the β-domain does not simply disrupt TAD structure but functions as an active repression domain, which modifies the acetylation state of the proximal PRL promoter in a manner dependent upon an N-CoR/mSin3-containing histone deacetylase complex (HDAC). Thus, analysis of the Pit-1/Pit-1β isoform pair provides significant insight into the structural determinants of transcription activation versus repression mediated by two nearly identical transcription factor isoforms. Monolayer cultures of HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells and GH4T2 rat pituitary tumor cells (12Conrad K.E. Gutierrez-Hartmann A.

The medium was changed 16–18 h before each transfection. Cells used for transfections were harvested at approximately 60–80% confluence using 0.05% trypsin and 0.5 mm EDTA. The rat PRL promoter luciferase expression vector, pA3 PRL luc, contains the firefly luciferase coding region under the control of a 498-bp fragment (−425 to +73) of the rPRL promoter downstream of three polyadenylation termination sites in pA3 luc (12Conrad K.E.

All mutant β-domain constructs were constructed by nested PCR mutagenesis of the Pit-1 transactivation domain as described previously (8Diamond S.E. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. J. Biol.

The pRSV HA Pit-1 plasmid was used as a substrate for PCR mutagenesis in which the 26-amino acid β-domain was substituted with six different epitope-scanning sequences (see Table I) or nine different alanine-scanning sequences (Table II), and an HA epitope tag was retained at the N terminus of all of the Pit-1 constructs.

Approximately 2–3 × 106 enzymatically dispersed cells were mixed with plasmid DNA in a sterile gene-pulse chamber and exposed to a controlled electrical field of 500 microfarads at 220 V, as described previously (15Keech C.A. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 832-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cells from individual transfections were then maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 15% horse serum, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, and 50 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin at 37 °C. The nonspecific effects of the RSV or CMV promoters upon transcription factor availability was controlled by including amounts of pRSV or CMV β-globin plasmid DNA in all assays to render the total pRSV or CMV DNA concentration constant. Transient transfections were performed in triplicate, in at least three separate experiments. After incubation for 24 h, cells were harvested with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3 mm EDTA, pelleted, and resuspended in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 1 mmdithiothreitol. Cells were lysed by three cycles of freeze-thawing and by vortexing between thaws. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used for subsequent assays. Luciferase activity in the supernatant was assayed as described previously (12Conrad K.E. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1279-1286PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were measured in duplicate using a Monolight 2010 Luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratories, San Diego, CA). Relative light units for each transfection were calculated by normalizing for total protein. Protein assays were performed according to the method of Bradford (16Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211906) Google Scholar) using commercially available reagents (Bio-Rad). Results are expressed as the fold activation of the rPRL promoter ± S.E. for at least three experiments, each in triplicate. Transient transfections were performed as above. Cells were harvested with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3 mm EDTA, pelleted, and resuspended in a triethanolamine/SDS solubilization buffer (55 mm triethanolamine, 111 mm NaCl, 2.2 mm EDTA, and 0.44% SDS) (17Ottaviano Y. Gerace L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 624-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lysed extracts were passed through a 25-gauge needle seven times. The protein content of each extract was assayed according to the method of Lowry et al.(18Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using commercially available reagents (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts (100 μg) of protein from each extract were separated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P (polyvinylidene difluoride) membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The HA-tagged Pit-1 proteins were detected with a mouse monoclonal anti-HA primary antibody (BAbCO, Richmond, CA), secondary sheep anti-mouse HRP-conjugated antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and ECL media (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Dilutions of 1:1,000 of the primary anti-HA monoclonal antibody and of 1:10,000 of the secondary sheep anti-mouse antibody preparation were used. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed according to the protocol for the acetyl-histone H4 ChIP Assay Kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), as modified by Lambert and Nordeen (19Lambert J.R. Nordeen S.K. Lieberman B. Methods in Steroid Receptor Molecular Biology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000Google Scholar). Transient transfections were performed as above. Twenty four hours after transfection, 2 × 107 GH4cells were cross-linked by addition of formaldehyde into the medium at a final concentration of 1% and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 500 μl of ChIP Lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with protease inhibitors). The lysates were sonicated utilizing a Branson Sonifier 450 at power setting 2 with three 10-s pulses at duty cycle 90 and diluted to 3 ml with ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 167 mm NaCl). 1 ml of each sample was precleared by incubating with 80 μl protein A-agarose beads for 30 min at 4 °C with rotation. 5 μl of anti-acetyl histone H4 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) was added, and immunoprecipitation was done overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Immune complexes were collected with 60 μl of protein A-agarose and washed once with 1 ml each of the following buffers in sequence: Low Salt Wash Buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl), High Salt Wash Buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1500 mm NaCl), LiCl Wash Buffer (250 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0); and twice with TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). Immune complexes were eluted, and cross-links were reversed by heating at 65 °C and subjected to proteinase K treatment. DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation and was used as a template for PCR (25 cycles) using pA3 −425 PRL Luc promoter-specific commercially synthesized deoxyoligonucleotides (Life Technologies, Inc.) that contain a PRL promoter-specific sequence, GCCTTTCTTTATGTTTTTGGC, and a luciferase-specific sequence, GACTCAAGATGTCAGTCAGC. In addition, internal control PCRs were performed with pSV Ras plasmid-specific commercially synthesized deoxyoligonucleotides (Life Technologies, Inc.) that contain an SV40 promoter-specific sequence, GCATCTCAATTAGTCAGC, and a Ha-Ras-exon-1-specific sequence, ACCAGCTTATATTCCGTC. Control reactions were performed to ensure that all PCR assays took place in the linear range of response to input DNA. PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and bands were imaged and quantified on an Alpha Imager 2000 Gel Documentation System (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). We have previously demonstrated that the β-domain insertion converts Pit-1 from a co-activator to a repressor of Ras signaling to the rPRL promoter (9Bradford A.P. Conrad K.E. Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2849-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 20Conrad K.E. Oberwetter J.M. Vallaincourt R. Johnson G.L. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1553-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have shown that the amino acid sequence of the β-domain dictates this repression (8Diamond S.E. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28925-28932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar,11Diamond S.E. Chiono M. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 228-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). One possible mechanism for β-domain-specific repression of Ras signaling would be that β-domain residues disrupt secondary or tertiary structures within the Pit-1 TAD that are important for Ras signaling. A prediction of this hypothesis would be that a particular Pit-1 TAD structure should be necessary for Ras signaling. In order to test this prediction, HA-tagged wild-type Pit-1, Pit-1β, and Pit-1 ΔTAD, which is deleted for amino acids 1–80 (Fig.1), were introduced into GH4pituitary cells by electroporation in the presence of a rPRL promoter-driven luciferase reporter and pSV Ras (Fig.2). As documented previously, co-transfection with wild-type Pit-1 constructs enhanced the Ras response from 3-fold in its absence to 10–13-fold in its presence, and co-transfection of the Pit-1β isoform not only failed to enhance the Ras response but actually reduced it by more than one-third. The deletion of the Pit-1 TAD, on the other hand, did not significantly interfere with enhancement of Ras signaling by Pit-1 but, in fact, enhanced the response to 9-fold. These data thus demonstrate that the TAD itself is not required for Pit-1 mediation of Ras signaling to the rPRL promoter. In order to identify β-domain residues that are functionally important for repression of Ras signaling, we took a two-step approach. In order to identify small regions required for repression, we sequentially altered overlapping 6 amino acid blocks of the β-domain (TableI). Individual residues in functionally important regions identified were then subjected to alanine-scanning mutagenesis (see below). We specifically chose the AU1 epitope (21Lim P. Jensen L. Cowsert Y. Nakai L. Lim X. Sundberg J. J. Infect. Dis. 1990; 162: 1263-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) to replace 6 amino acid stretches of the β-domain because it did not affect the ability of mutant Pit-1β to function as a transcription factor when part of a β-domain substitution mutant (8Diamond S.E. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28925-28932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Each mutant β-domain is of the same size and in the same position as the wild-type β-domain and differs from the wild type by at most 6 amino acids. The mutant and wild-type constructs were each N-terminally tagged with an HA epitope (8Diamond S.E. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28925-28932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, all constructs expressed proteins that contained the same epitope in the same relative position to allow for their detection by Western blot analysis regardless of possible alterations of protein structure by the β-domain substitutions. It has been previously shown that wild-type Pit-1 and Pit-1β constructs express protein at different levels in transient transfection experiments (6Konzak K.E. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar,8Diamond S.E. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28925-28932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In order to exclude the effect of differences in protein expression level on transcription potency, we carried out a series of transfection experiments to find levels of input DNA that would yield similar levels of protein expression from the wild-type and mutant Pit-1 vectors. In a preliminary experiment, 10 μg of each of the pRSV HA Pit-1 constructs were introduced into HeLa nonpituitary cells and GH4pituitary cells by electroporation. Extracts f"

Thyroid hormones are derived from the degradation of a very large precursor, thyroglobulin (Tg)1, and to produce the final product Tg must first be iodinated by the thyroid-specific enzyme thyroperoxidase (TPO) (1Taurog A. Braverman L.E. Utiger R.D. The Thyroid: Fundamental and Clinical Text. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, New York1996: 47-81Google Scholar). Hence Tg and TPO, as well as thyrotropin receptor and sodium/iodide symporter, are markers of thyroid differentiation (2Dumont J.E. Lamy F. Roger P. Maenhaut C. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 596-611PubMed Google Scholar, 3Damante G. Di Lauro R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Studies on the transcriptional regulation of these thyroid differentiation markers have resulted in the identification of a set of transcription factors crucial for the maintenance of the thyroid differentiation state. These factors include thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), thyroid transcription factor 2 (TTF-2), and Pax 8 (3Damante G. Di Lauro R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Each is expressed in a very restricted number of cell types, but their combined expression is limited to follicular cells of the thyroid gland. Their role in thyroid differentiation has been identified by targeted gene disruption in mice. Inactivation of any of the three transcription factors affects normal thyroid development. Null mice for the TTF-1 gene (4Kimura S. Hara Y. Pineau T. Fernandez-Salguero P. Fox C.H. Ward J.M. Gonzales F.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar), as well as for the TTF-2 gene (5De Felice M. Ovitt C. Biffali E. Rodriguez-Mallon A. Arra C. Anastassiadis K. Macchia P.E. Mattei M.G. Mariano A. Scholer H. Macchia V. Di Lauro R. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), die in utero and, in addition to having other developmental defects, do not develop a thyroid gland. Pax 8−/− mice develop a reduced thyroid gland with normal calcitonin-producing parafollicular C cells but lacking differentiated follicular cells (6Mansouri A. Chowdhury K. Gruss P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Whereas TTF-1 is therefore required for the proper development of the thyroid gland and for the differentiation of both follicular and parafollicular cell types, Pax 8 is required only for the differentiation of the thyroxin-producing follicular cells. A direct correlation has been reported between the neoplastic transformation and dedifferentiation and the activity of the thyroid-specific transcription factors (7Francis-Lang H. Zannini S. De Felice M. Berlingieri M.T. Fusco A. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5793-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Thyroid cells transformed with a variety of activated oncogenes lose hormonal control of the cell cycle, and the differentiation markers are suppressed. Such a role has been reported for v-ras, v-src, v-raf, and v-mos (8Fusco A. Berlingieri M.T. Di Fiore P.P. Portella G. Greco M. Vecchio G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3365-3370Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Particularly interesting is the activity of the adenovirus E1A gene because it blocks the thyrocyte differentiation, but the neoplastic phenotype is achieved only after cooperation with other oncogenes (9Berlingieri M.T. Santoro M. Battaglia C. Greco M. Fusco A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 249-255PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with its role in thyroid-specific gene expression and follicular differentiation, Pax 8 activity and expression have been correlated with thyrocyte transformation and oncogenic mediated dedifferentiation. In rat thyroid epithelial cells, the expression of RET/PTC1 oncogene as well as of polyoma middle T blocks tissue-specific gene expression, and in both cases Pax 8 gene expression is down-regulated (10De Vita G. Zannini M. Cirafici A.M. Melillo R.M. Di Lauro R. Fusco A. Santoro M. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 97-103PubMed Google Scholar, 11Pasca M. Zannini M. J. Endocrinol. Invest. 1997; 20 Suppl. 5: 1Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that exogenous over-expression of Pax 8 in thyroid cells transformed by polyoma middle T reactivates the entire differentiated program (11Pasca M. Zannini M. J. Endocrinol. Invest. 1997; 20 Suppl. 5: 1Google Scholar). Pax 8 belongs to the family of Pax genes constituting important developmental regulators characterized by a highly conserved paired domain at the amino terminus (12Mansouri A. Hallonet M. Gruss P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 851-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Together with Pax 2 and Pax 5, Pax 8 forms a subfamily of the pax genes characterized by an activation domain and an inhibitory domain at the carboxyl-terminal end and by the presence of a partial homeodomain (12Mansouri A. Hallonet M. Gruss P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 851-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar,13Dorfler P. Busslinger M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1971-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In thyrocytes, Pax 8 has been recognized as a positive trans-acting factor in Tg and TPO gene promoters (14Fabbro D. Pellizzari L. Mercuri F. Tell G. Damante G. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 21: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15Zannini S. Francis-Lang H. Plachov D. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4230-4241Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it activates TPO and sodium/iodide symporter enhancers (16Esposito C. Miccadei S. Saiardi A. Civitareale D. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 17Ohno M. Zannini S. Levy O. Carrasco N. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2051-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that all the Pax 8 binding sites largely overlap the binding site of TTF-1 and that the binding of the two factors, in vitro, is mutually exclusive (15Zannini S. Francis-Lang H. Plachov D. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4230-4241Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). We have decided to focus on the role of Pax 8 in thyrocyte-specific transcription. Given the critical role played by Pax 8 in thyrocyte differentiation, an understanding of how this factor mediates transcription activation is essential if its role in establishing the thyroid follicular cell lineage and thyrocyte-specific transcription is to be understood. In this respect, nothing is known concerning the molecular requirements for Pax 8 transcriptional activation. Increasing evidence of the trans-activation requirements of several transcription factors has established the crucial role of a class of proteins, termed co-activators or co-factors, that are not able to bind DNA directly but via multiple protein-protein interactions bridge the DNA-bound transcription factor to the RNA polymerase II complex, facilitating its recruitment on the promoter and thus transcription initiation (18Guarente L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 517-521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 19McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 367-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). p300 and CBP (CREB-binding protein) are the most widely characterized co-activator proteins (20Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Ekner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 21Shikama N. Lyon J. La Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). They are ubiquitously expressed phosphoproteins and show an identity of 63% at the amino acid level. Although some differences in their activity have been reported (22Kawasaki H. Eckner R. Yao T. Taira K. Chiu R. Livingston D.M. Yokoyama K.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), they are generally considered to be functionally homologous (23Giles R.H. Peters D. Breuning M.H. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 178-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). p300 was cloned through its interaction with E1A of adenovirus, and CBP was first identified through its interaction with CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein) (24Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 25Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar). These co-activators have been shown to potentiate the activity of several transcription factors, including the nuclear hormone receptors, AP-1, c-Myb, signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT), NF-κB, and p53 and to interact also with basal transcription factors such as TF-IIB and the TATA-binding protein (TBP); see Refs.20Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Ekner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 21Shikama N. Lyon J. La Thangue N.B.

Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 178-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar for additional examples of partners of these co-activators in protein-protein interactions. p300 and CBP are functionally conserved transcriptional co-activators that not only bind to histone acetyltransferase (P/CAF) but also show intrinsic acetyltransferase activity (26Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar, 27Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T.

Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar). Thus, they activate transcription by acting as multifunctional adaptor proteins and through acetylation of chromatin. We searched for factors that might act as Pax 8 co-activators by testing candidate molecules for their ability to cooperate. We report here that p300 acts as a Pax 8 co-activator on the TPO gene promoter by a mechanism involving an interaction between the amino-terminal and CH3 domains of p300 and the carboxyl-terminal domain of Pax 8. TPO-pGL3 plasmid, termed also TPO-Luc, has been constructed by inserting the SacI-PvuII fragment from p420TPOL (29Francis-Lang H. Price M. Polycarpou-Swarz M. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) in pGL3 Basic (Promega) digested with SacI and NcoI; theNcoI site was blunted with Klenow enzyme. TPO-Pm-pGL3 was constructed in the same way using the SacI-PvuII fragment from p420TPOL-Pm (29Francis-Lang H. Price M. Polycarpou-Swarz M. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). To prepare pBlu-Pax8 plasmid, the Pax 8 gene was amplified from the plasmid C27B (32Plachov D. Chowdhury K. Walther C. Simon D. Guenet J. Gruss P. Development. 1990; 110: 643-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by polymerase chain reaction using oligo(A) (5′-GCGGATCCCATGCCTCACAACTCGATC-3′) and oligo(B) (5′-GCGGATCCTGACAACTACAGATGGTC-3′). The amplified fragment was digested with BamHI and cloned in pBluescript KS (Stratagene) digested with BamHI. pGAL 4-Pax 8 was constructed inserting the EcoRI-XbaI fragment from pBlu-Pax 8 in pm vector (CLONTECH). pGAL 4-Pax8dl1–313, also termed pGAL 4-Pax 8dl1, was prepared by digesting pGAL 4-Pax 8 with PstI and religating the deleted vector. pGAL 4-Pax 8dl331–457, also termed pGAL 4-Pax 8dl2, was constructed by excision of theSacI-XbaI fragment from pGAL 4-Pax 8 plasmid followed by religation of the expression vector; the vector termini were blunted with T4 DNA polymerase. The new constructs were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestions. The ability to express the fusion proteins was tested by band-shift assays with the GAL 4 binding site and nuclear extracts of HeLa cells transfected with pGAL 4-Pax 8dl331–457 or pGAL 4-Pax8dl1–313 (data not shown). HeLa cells were transfected by Effectrene reagent (Qiagen) following the protocol suggested by the manufacturer. The following amounts of the indicated plasmids were transfected: 0.4 μg, luciferase reporter plasmids; 10 ng, pCMV-Pax 8; 10 ng, E1A-expressing vector; 10 ng, the vector encoding for the E1A deletion mutant lacking the amino acids 2–36; 5 ng, pCMVβp300; 5 ng, p300dl33; and 10 ng, the plasmids encoding for the GAL 4 binding domain fusion proteins. The efficiency of transfection was assayed with 10 ng of pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid. 48 h after transfections cell extracts were prepared. The luciferase activity was measured according to the Luciferase Assay System (Promega), and β-galactosidase assay was performed with the chlorophenol red-β-galactopyranoside substrate as previously reported (33Hollon T. Yoshimura F.K. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The values obtained for luciferase assays were corrected for transfection efficiency with the β-galactosidase assay. Transfection experiments were done in duplicate or in triplicate and repeated at least three times. For each experiment we report the mean of three independent experiments, and the standard deviations are shown. Quick cell extracts were prepared from transfected HeLa cells. Briefly, the transfected cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in TEN (50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mmNaCl), and resuspended in 5 volumes of the packed cell volume in buffer A (30 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 5% glycerol). Two cycles of freezing and thawing were performed, and NaCl was added to a final concentration of 450 mm. Extracts were incubated for 40 min on ice, centrifuged for 30 min in the cold room at 14,000 rpm in a Biofuge. Supernatant was collected, and protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad Assay using bovine serum albumin as standard. The affinity column with the double strand oligonucleotide containing the GAL 4 binding site, 5′-GGATCGGAGGACAGTACTCCGCTAG-3′, was prepared as reported in Ref. 34Rutberg S.E. Ronai Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar and equilibrated in buffer A plus 80 mm NaCl. The cell extracts were diluted with buffer A to decrease the NaCl concentration to 80 mm; 0.3 μg of poly(dI-dC) were added per μg of proteins and incubated for 15 min on ice. The affinity column (0.5-ml bed volume) was inoculated with the cell extract proteins and washed with 4 column volumes of buffer A plus 80 mm NaCl; the step elution was performed with 2 ml of buffer A plus 1 m NaCl. The flow-through, wash, and step elution fractions were concentrated on Centricon 30 and assayed in band-shift assays. The band-shift assays were performed as previously reported (16Esposito C. Miccadei S. Saiardi A. Civitareale D. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) using the double strand oligonucleotide with the Pax 8 binding site from the Tg promoter, oligo C (35Civitareale D. Lonigro R. Sinclair A.J. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2537-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). To obtain a protein fraction enriched for Pax 8 binding activity from the cell extract of HeLa cells over-expressing Pax 8, we loaded this cell extract on an affinity column with the double strand oligonucleotide C. This affinity column was processed as described above for the affinity column with the Gal 4 oligonucleotide. The fractions eluted from the oligo C affinity column were tested with band-shift assays with oligo C. Pax 8 binding activity was identified in the fraction of the elution step (data not shown). To study the Pax 8 requirements in transcriptional trans-activation, we used the strong activity shown by this factor on the TPO promoter in non-thyroid HeLa cells (15Zannini S. Francis-Lang H. Plachov D. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4230-4241Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, co-transfection of a plasmid containing the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the TPO gene promoter (TPO-Luc) with the Pax 8 encoding plasmid, results in strong activation of TPO promoter activity. Co-transfection of p300 and TPO-Luc results in very weak reporter gene expression, whereas the combined activity of p300 and Pax 8 results in cooperative activation of TPO gene promoter activity. We can demonstrate that this synergism requires Pax 8 to be bound on the promoter because the mutated TPO promoter, TPO-Pm (29Francis-Lang H. Price M. Polycarpou-Swarz M. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), cannot be activated by Pax 8, and the co-expression of p300 and Pax 8 does not affect TPO-Pm promoter activity (data not shown). To establish whether p300 and Pax 8 form a complex, we used the two-hybrid protocol in mammalian cells. Because Pax 8 is itself a transcription factor with its own trans-activation domain, our experiment is more similar to the one-hybrid experiment in HeLa cells (30Strubin M. Newell J.W. Matthias P. Cell. 1995; 80: 497-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2 A we show that the GAL 4-dependent promoter is activated by the GAL 4-p300 fusion protein, as has been reported by Yuan et al. (31Yuan W. Condorelli G. Caruso M. Felsani A. Giordano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9009-9013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). These authors have identified two trans-activation domains in the p300 molecule. We now show that although Pax 8 alone has no activity on the GAL 4-dependent promoter, GAL4-p300 is able to recruit Pax 8 on the promoter, resulting in a strong and synergic stimulation of the transcription of the reporter gene. This experiment therefore suggests that p300 and Pax 8 interact. To identify the domain of p300 involved in the interaction with Pax 8, we have used a panel of deletion mutants of GAL 4-p300 in a one-hybrid experiment in HeLa cells. To quantify the ability of the GAL 4-p300 deletion mutants to bind Pax 8, we introduce the Recruitment Index (RI) in Fig.2 B. RI is obtained by dividing the fold of activation obtained by the combined activity of Pax 8 and Gal4-p300 by the sum of the fold of activation obtained when Gal4-p300 and Pax 8 are over-expressed alone. An RI > 1 indicates that the Gal4-p300 wild type or deletion mutant is able to bind and recruit Pax 8 on the promoter. As shown in Fig. 2 B, three GAL 4-p300 deletion mutants have an RI > 1. They identify two domains of p300 able to recruit Pax 8 on the promoter: a fragment of p300 including the amino acids 1514–1922, corresponding to the CH3 domain, and a fragment containing the amino acids 1–242 of p300. The ability of these two domains to recruit Pax 8 on the GAL 4-dependent promoter is much weaker than that of the full-length p300 protein, suggesting that the two domains in the intact protein could cooperate in Pax 8 binding or that a third domain of interaction, not identified with the p300 deletion mutants shown in Fig. 2 B, exists. We show that the Gal4-p300 deletion mutant 964–1922, containing the CH3 domain, does not interact with Pax 8. We envisage the amino-terminal portion of this mutant as masking the CH3 domain or inducing a misfolding of it. However, the crucial role of the CH3 domain of p300 is also demonstrated by the experiment shown in Fig. 2 C, in which the p300 deletion mutant, lacking the CH3 domain and encoded by the plasmid p300dl33, does not cooperate with Pax 8 in TPO promoter activation. Therefore, the CH3 domain of p300 is crucial for its cooperative activity with Pax 8. To identify the Pax 8 domain involved in the interaction with p300, we performed the one-hybrid assay in HeLa cells using deletion mutants of Pax 8 fused in frame with the GAL 4 binding domain. Two Gal 4-Pax 8 deletion mutants, Gal 4-Pax 8 dl1 and Gal 4-Pax 8 dl2, were used as “bait” in the one-hybrid assay in HeLa cells. We show that GAL 4-Pax 8 dl2, containing amino acids 331–457 of Pax 8, is able to interact with p300 because it recruits the co-activator on the Gal 4-dependent promoter. Thus, the two trans-activation domains of p300 (31Yuan W. Condorelli G. Caruso M. Felsani A. Giordano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9009-9013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), recruited on the promoter by Gal 4-Pax 8 dl2, increase the promoter activity (Fig.3 B). Therefore, we demonstrate that the Pax 8/p300 interaction is mediated by the last 126 amino acids of the carboxyl-terminal end of Pax 8 and by two p300 domains, the first 242 amino acids at the amino terminus and the CH3 domain. To provide further evidence of Pax 8 and p300 interaction, we used a biochemical approach. Protein extracts prepared from HeLa cells transfected either with the plasmid encoding GAL 4-p300 or with the plasmid expressing Pax 8 were mixed with each other and used as the input of an affinity column with the double strand DNA oligonucleotide containing the GAL 4 binding site. We collected three fractions from the affinity column: the flow-through, the wash, and the elution step at 1 m NaCl. They were subsequently used in a band-shift assay to identify the fraction containing Pax 8. As shown in Fig.4, lane 6, Pax 8 was identified in the elution step at high salt concentration. As a marker of the Pax 8/oligo C complex, we show in Fig. 4, lane 7 the band-shift assay of Pax 8 purified from the cell extract of HeLa cells over-expressing Pax 8. The arrow shown in Fig. 4 indicates the Pax 8 complex with oligo C, and the same complex is present in the band-shift assay with the elution step fraction shown in lane 6. Therefore, in the presence of GAL 4-p300, Pax 8 binds the GAL 4 affinity column. In a control experiment where the same affinity column with the Gal 4 oligonucleotide had been loaded with the cell extract prepared from HeLa cells over-expressing Pax 8 (hence in the absence of GAL 4-p300), the binding activity of Pax 8 was identified in the flow-through fraction (data not shown). Thus, this experiment shows that, although Pax 8 does not bind the GAL 4 affinity column, in the presence of GAL 4-p300 it complexes on the column. This suggests, once more, the formation of a complex between Pax 8 and p300.Figure 4In vitro interaction of Pax 8 and p300.Band-shift assay of the input protein cell extracts and fractions of the GAL 4 affinity column. The probe used in this assay was the double strand DNA oligonucleotide C containing the Pax 8 binding site (34Rutberg S.E. Ronai Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).Lane 1 is with proteins extracted from HeLa cells over-expressing GAL 4-p300. Lane 2 is the control probe.Lane 3 represents the band-shift assay in the presence of the proteins extracted from HeLa cells over-expressing Pax 8. We have found that the same strong band, shown in lanes 1 and3, is also present in a band-shift assay performed with oligo C and a cell extract of HeLa cells (data not shown); therefore we consider this complex as unspecific and not related to Pax 8.Lanes 4, 5, and 6 are the flow-through, the wash, and the elution step, respectively, of the GAL 4 affinity column. Lane 7 shows the band-shift assay with the Pax 8 purified fraction (see “Experimental Procedures”). Thus, the enriched band of lane 7, indicated by thearrow, is the Pax 8/oligo C complex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because it has been shown that E1A activity blocks the thyrocyte differentiation (9Berlingieri M.T. Santoro M. Battaglia C. Greco M. Fusco A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 249-255PubMed Google Scholar) and that E1A binds the p300 CH3 domain (24Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar), we envisaged E1A and Pax 8 as competing for the binding of p300. To test this hypothesis we have over-expressed E1A and Pax 8 in the same assay. As shown in Fig.5, E1A inhibits Pax 8 trans-activation activity, whereas the E1A deletion mutant (E1A-M), lacking the p300 interaction domain, does not affect Pax 8 activity. In this experiment we have used the plasmid encoding for E1A 12S; however, we have obtained a similar down-regulation of Pax 8 activity transfecting the E1A 13S-encoding plasmid (data not shown). In this study we show that the paired domain-containing transcription factor Pax 8 can associate with the transcriptional co-activator p300 both in vivo and in vitro. This interaction involves the trans-activation domain of Pax 8 and both the amino-terminal domain and the CH3 domain of p300. We demonstrate that Pax 8/p300 interaction results in a synergic activation of TPO gene promoter activity. Therefore we suggest that p300 plays a crucial role in thyroid-specific gene expression and differentiation. In agreement with this hypothesis are results indicating that E1A is able to abrogate thyroid follicular cell differentiation with down-regulation of thyroid-specific gene expression. We now provide evidence of the mechanism of this repression. We show that E1A can repress the activation function of the most important transcription factor for TPO promoter activity. We suggest that repression by E1A results from the sequestration of a protein, p300, required for Pax 8-mediated activation. A similar mechanism has been proposed for the inhibition by E1A of the activity of several transcription factors, for example c-FOS (36Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4758-4762Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) and STAT6 (37Gingras S. Simard J. Groner B. Pfitzner E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2722-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), in which p300/CBP is sequestered from the transcription factor by the adenoviral protein. The results presented in this study indicate in the Pax8/p300 interaction a new critical event in TPO gene promoter activation. Although p300 is a pleiotropic protein, it shows two most relevant roles: the ability to acetylate, directly or indirectly, specific proteins and the ability to function as a bridging factor. More experiments are needed to clarify the molecular role of p300 on the TPO gene promoter; however, it is worth discussing an interesting correlation here. It has recently been reported that Pax 5, which belongs to the same subfamily of Pax genes as Pax 8, interacts directly with TBP (38Eberhard D. Busslinger M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59 (suppl.): 1716-1725Google Scholar). This interaction involves the rudiment of the homeodomain of Pax 5. As stated above, the same partial homeodomain is present also in the other elements of the Pax subfamily, Pax 2 and Pax 8 (12Mansouri A. Hallonet M. Gruss P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 851-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Therefore, we could envisage Pax 8 interacting with TBP. Because p300 binds TBP (31Yuan W. Condorelli G. Caruso M. Felsani A. Giordano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9009-9013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), the formation of a complex with Pax 8/p300/TBP is likely. These multiple interactions would result in a stronger stabilization of the complex on the TPO gene promoter and therefore in its activation. Although p300/CBP adaptor proteins are widely expressed, their concentration appears to be limiting (23Giles R.H. Peters D. Breuning M.H. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 178-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), thus enabling them to integrate signals in the nucleus from different extracellular stimuli. It has been shown that TPO gene expression is regulated by Pax 8 (15Zannini S. Francis-Lang H. Plachov D. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4230-4241Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) and by hormonal stimuli (39Gererd C. Lefort A. Christophe D. Libert F. Van sande J. Dumont J. Vassart G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 2110-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). TPO mRNA is very sensitive to thyrotropin regulation (2Dumont J.E. Lamy F. Roger P. Maenhaut C. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 596-611PubMed Google Scholar, 3Damante G. Di Lauro R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The induction of TPO gene transcription is rapid, cyclic AMP-dependent, and does not require protein synthesis (39Gererd C. Lefort A. Christophe D. Libert F. Van sande J. Dumont J. Vassart G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 2110-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In contrast to the vast majority of cases, this induction is not mediated by CREB, because the TPO gene promoter lacks the cAMP-response element (3Damante G. Di Lauro R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 29Francis-Lang H. Price M. Polycarpou-Swarz M. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In this respect, our results suggest an interesting correlation. Because it has been shown that p300/CBP mediates cyclic AMP response (40Chakravarti D. LaMorte V. Nelson M.C. Nakajiama T. Schulman I.G. Juguilon H. Montminy M. Evans R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar) and because we now show that p300 cooperates with Pax 8 to activate the TPO gene promoter, we envisage thyrotropin regulation of TPO gene expression being mediated by p300. Consistent with this hypothesis, it has been shown that Pax 8 gene expression is increased by cyclic AMP (41Van Renterghem P. Vassart G. Cristophe D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1307: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); the higher concentration would favor Pax 8 in p300 recruitment and result in TPO gene expression activation.

Using isothermal titration microcalorimetry we have studied the binding of human cardiac troponin C (cTnC) and its isolated domains to human cardiac troponin I (cTnI). We provide the first binding data for these proteins while they are free in solution and unmodified by reporter groups. Our data reveal that the C-terminal domain of cTnC is responsible for most of the free energy change upon cTnC·cTnI binding.

Changes in the affinity of cTnI for cTnC and its isolated C-terminal domain in response to ionic strength support this finding, with both following similar trends.

The troponin complex consists of three proteins: the Ca2+ binding subunit, troponin C (TnC),1 the inhibitory subunit, troponin I (TnI), and troponin T (TnT) which anchors the troponin complex to the thin filament. The binding of Ca2+to TnC results in conformational changes and altered interactions within the thin filament which ultimately lead to muscle contraction (1Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Central to the transmission of the Ca2+ signal are altered interactions between TnC and TnI. Skeletal and cardiac TnC share ∼70% sequence identity and consist of two globular domains (N- and C-terminal) connected by a central helix (2Herzberg O. James M.N.G. Nature. 1985; 313: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Both proteins have four EF hand divalent cation binding sites, sites I and II in the N-terminal domain and sites III and IV in the C-terminal domain. All four sites bind Ca2+ in skeletal TnC (skTnC), but in cardiac TnC (cTnC) site I is unable to bind divalent cations (3Van Eerd J.-P. Takahashi K. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1171-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Sites I and II of skTnC and site II of cTnC are low affinity Ca2+-specific binding sites (K a(Ca) = 5 × 106m−1 and 2 × 106m−1 for skTnC and cTnC, respectively) (4Potter J.D. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4628-4635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Holroyde M.J. Robertson S.P. Johnson D.J. Solaro J.R. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11688-11693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is Ca2+ binding to these sites which is proposed to act as the trigger for the initiation of muscle contraction. In skTnC this involves an “opening” of the structure with increased exposure of an extensive hydrophobic patch to which skeletal troponin I (skTnI) binds, ultimately relieving inhibition on actin (6Gagne S.M. Tsuda S. Li M.X. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Nature Struct. Biology. 1995; 2: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). There is, however, evidence that the details of interaction between TnC and TnI may differ in cardiac and skeletal muscle as the Ca2+-saturated N-terminal domain of cTnC exists in a closed conformation (7Sia S.K. Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Gagne S.M. Liu W. Putkey J.A. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18216-18221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and a recent report suggests that the binding of cTnI147–163 is required for the “opening” of this domain (8Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Sites III and IV in cTnC are high affinity Ca2+ binding sites that can also bind Mg2+ with a lower affinity (K a(Ca) = 3 × 108m−1 andK a(Mg) = 3 × 103m−1) (5Holroyde M.J. Robertson S.P. Johnson D.J. Solaro J.R. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11688-11693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions these sites are always occupied by Mg2+ or Ca2+. The C-terminal domain of TnC has been proposed as a Ca2+-independent structural binding site for TnI and TnT, helping to anchor the troponin complex to the thin filament (9Malnic B. Farah C.S.

Several lines of evidence indicate that TnI lies antiparallel to TnC and that the two proteins interact at several sites along their length (1Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The structures of skTnC bound to skTnI1–47 and cTnC C-domain bound to the equivalent region of cTnI (residues 33–80) show this region of TnI to be α-helical and to bind to the hydrophobic pocket of the C-terminal domain of TnC by both polar and Van der Waals interactions (15Vassylyev D.G.

Both of these studies were carried out with Ca2+-saturated TnC, although it has not been determined if the C-terminal sites are bound with Mg2+ at all times, or if the increase in [Ca2+] on activation is of sufficient duration to displace Mg2+ in the contractile state. In relaxed muscle, at low [Ca2+], interactions of the C-terminal domain of TnC with the N-terminal region of TnI will still persist, but the inhibitory region of TnI (residues 104–115 in skTnI, residues 136–147 in cTnI) and a region C-terminal to this (residues 140–148 in skTnI, residues 152–199 in cTnI) are thought to bind to actin, inhibiting the actomyosin ATPase. On activation, when the regulatory site(s) of TnC are occupied by Ca2+, these sites on TnI bind to TnC, relieving inhibition (for review, see Ref. 17Perry S.V. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 190: 9-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although much is known about the interaction of TnI with TnC, further information is required for us to understand fully their role in muscle regulation. In this study isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC) has been used to investigate the interaction of cTnI with cTnC and its isolated domains. We have for the first time investigated the effect of ionic strength and Ca2+ on the free energy, enthalpy, and entropy changes associated with the binding of cTnC and its isolated domains to cTnI. Our results suggest that the C-terminal domain of cTnC may play a more important role in cardiac muscle regulation than previously thought. Restriction endonucleases, DNA-modifying enzymes, and deoxynucleotides were purchased from New England Biolabs,Taq polymerase was purchased from Roche Diagnostics Ltd., and oligonucleotide primers were produced by Alta Bioscience, University of Birmingham. pET11c(cTnC) and pET11c(cTnI) DNA constructs were kindly provided by Dr. E. Al-Hillawi. Inorganic chemicals were of Analar quality from BDH Laboratory Supplies. DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow, CM-Sepharose Fast Flow, and Superdex 75 were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. BCA protein assay reagent (bicinchoninic acid) was obtained from Pierce Chemical Company and used as per the manufacturer's instructions. Polymerase chain reaction was used to generate DNA fragments encoding the isolated N-terminal domain of cTnC (cTnC N-domain, residues 1–91 inclusive of N-terminal Met), and cTnC C-domain (residues 91–161). The 5′-polymerase chain reaction primer (5′-GGGAATTCATATGGATGACATCTACAAGGCTGC-3′) for the cTnC N-domain was designed to amplify pET11c(cTnC) DNA from the first amino acid and also encoded an NdeI restriction site. The 3′-primer (5′-AAGGATCCCTACCCTTTGCTGTCGTCCTT-3′) corresponded to amino acids 86–91 and also encoded a stop codon upstream of a BamHI site. To generate the cTnC C-domain a 5′-amplification primer (5′-GGGAATTCATATGGGGAAATCTGAGGAGGAG-3′) was designed to amplify the pET11c(cTnC) DNA sequence from Gly-91 to the 3′-end of the coding sequence. This 5′-primer also encoded an NdeI restriction site. The 3′-primer (5′-GGGGATCCCTACTCCACACCCTTCATGAAC-3′) was complementary to pET11c(cTnC) DNA encoding the C terminus of cTnC; this primer also encoded a stop codon and BamHI site. The resulting polymerase chain reaction products were purified to a single band by gel electrophoresis on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and electroeluted. The clean products were digested with NdeI and BamHI, ligated into NdeI/BamHI-digested pET11c vector, and used to transform competent Escherichia coli JM101 cells. Successful clones were screened for by restriction analysis and verified by DNA sequencing and by amino acid sequencing of the first 10 residues of the purified protein. The cTnC, cTnC N-domain, and cTnC C-domain pET11c constructs were transformed into and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. The cells were grown at 37 °C in NZCYM medium with 0.3 mm ampicillin until they reached anA 600 of 0.8-1. They were then induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and incubated for a further 4–5 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 ×g for 10 min. Harvested cells were homogenized into 25 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.5, 8 murea, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The homogenate was then sonicated for 9 × 20 s at power level 6 using a Heatsystems Inc. sonicator. Insoluble cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 75,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. The cell extract was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (2.5 × 20 cm), equilibrated with 25 mmtriethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.5, 8 m urea, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol buffer, and eluted with a linear 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient. The fractions containing cTnC or its domains were identified by absorption at 280 nm and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These fractions were dialyzed against 1 mm ammonium bicarbonate and freeze dried. The lyophilized protein was dissolved in 25 mmtriethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, loaded on a Superdex-75 column (2.5 × 50 cm), and eluted in the same buffer. The fractions containing cTnC or its domains were pooled and dialyzed against 1 mmammonium bicarbonate, freeze dried and stored at −20 °C. The isolated proteins were judged to be ∼95% pure by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. The expression of cTnI was as described by Al-Hillawi et al. (18Al-Hillawi E. Minchin S.D. Trayer I.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Ammonium sulfate (30% w/v) was added to cTnI cell extract in 25 mmtriethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.5, 8 m urea, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol buffer, and the solution was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The cTnI remained in the supernatant and was dialyzed against 25 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.5, 8 murea, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The cTnI was then loaded onto a CM-Sepharose Fast Flow column (2.5 × 20 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer and eluted with a linear 0–0.5m NaCl gradient. The fractions containing cTnI were identified by absorption at 280 nm and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, pooled, dialyzed against 1 mm HCl, freeze dried, and stored at −20 °C. 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels were run at 35 mA and stained with Coomassie Blue (19Weeds A.G. Hall R. Spurway N.C. FEBS Lett. 1975; 49: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). DNA and N-terminal protein sequencing were carried out on Applied Biosystems 373A and 437A automated sequencers respectively by Alta Bioscience, School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method calibrated with bovine serum albumin (Pierce Chemical Company). Experiments were carried out using a Microcal Inc. isothermal titration microcalorimeter. Proteins were dialyzed extensively against 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, ± 1 mm CaCl2, with 0–0.3m KCl and experiments performed at 30 °C. Protein samples were clarified by centrifugation at 86,000 × gfor 20 min with a TL-100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments Co.) prior to protein concentration determination. The sample cell was filled with 1.4 ml of cTnI solution and titrated with cTnC, cTnC N-domain, or cTnC C-domain. Protein concentrations were 3 μm (+Ca2+) or 6 μm(−Ca2+) cTnI solution in the cell titrated with 60 μm (+Ca2+) or 160 μm(−Ca2+) cTnC or cTnC C-domain. When cTnI was titrated with cTnC N-domain in the presence of Ca2+ concentrations were 6 and 160 μm, respectively. The injection size was 5 μl, with duration of 10 s, at 210-s intervals with stirring at 350 rpm. Control titrations of buffer with cTnC or its isolated domains and titrations of cTnI with buffer indicated that heats of dilution were small and constant. In each experiment the heat of dilution was obtained from additional injections following complete saturation and was subtracted from the binding isotherm. OriginTM ITC data analysis software (Microcal Inc.) was used in the “one set of sites” mode to analyze all binding isotherms. These studies were performed with a model E analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments Co.) equipped with Raleigh interference optics. The method used was the long column meniscus depletion technique as described by Chervenka (20Chervenka C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 34: 24-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). An AN-D rotor was used together with a 12-mm double-sector synthetic boundary cell fitted with sapphire windows. All of the samples were dialyzed overnight against a buffer containing 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA ± 1 mm CaCl2 and either 0, 0.05, 0.1, or 0.3m KCl. Protein samples were centrifuged at 86,000 ×g for 20 min with a TL-100 ultracentrifuge prior to analytical ultracentrifugation. Ultracentrifugation data were obtained with a rotor speed of 35,000 rpm at 30 °C over a range of cTnI concentrations from 10 to 30 μm. The interference patterns were photographed on Kodak TSK 400 film. The developed film was then read on a Nikon two-dimensional microcomparator. The fringe displacement as a function of radial distance was then measured for two fringes and the average obtained. Equilibrium was established when no further fringe displacement occurred with time and was attained after a 6-h ultracentrifugation. The average molecular mass for the whole solution was calculated from the slope of the plot of the natural logarithm of the fringe displacement (lnf) against the distance from the center of rotation squared (r 2). All fringe displacements greater than 100 μm were included in the least squares analysis. The relationship between the Mr and slope of the lnf versus r 2 plot is given by Equation 1, mr=2RT/ω2(1−νρ)·dlnf/dr2Equation 1 where R is the gas constant expressed as 8.313 J K−1 mol−1, ω is the angular velocity (2π/60 * rpm (rad. s−1)), ρ is the solvent density, and ν the partial specific volume of the protein (0.72 g ml−1). The ν was calculated from the known amino acid composition of cTnI (21Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids and Peptides. Reinhold Publishing Corporation, New York1943: 370-381Google Scholar). The density ρ was estimated using standard tables (22Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, pp. 79.Google Scholar). To determine the optimum temperature at which to monitor cTnC·cTnI binding, the effect of temperature on the binding enthalpy was studied between 16 and 37 °C (Fig.1). In the absence of Ca2+(but in the presence of Mg2+) the ΔH was +4 kJ mol−1 at 16 °C. As the temperature was increased, ΔH decreased linearly to −46 kJ mol−1 indicating exothermic binding at physiological temperatures. The slope of this plot yields ΔCp , the heat capacity of the binding process. ΔCp was −2.4 ± 0.1 kJ mol−1 K−1 in the absence of Ca2+. These results also indicate that the minimum temperature at which ΔH was large enough to obtain good data in the absence of Ca2+ was 30 °C. This temperature was therefore used for all further experiments. In the presence of Ca2+ the binding process was considerably more exothermic across the entire temperature range, although ΔCp was similar (−2.2 ± 0.1 kJ mol−1 K−1). The large negative value of ΔCp upon cTnC·cTnI binding is probably accounted for by a decrease in the solvent-exposed nonpolar surface area (23Spolar R.S. Recordm Jr, M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). This could be the result of movement of apolar residues within cTnC and/or cTnI on interaction or, more probably, the burial of hydrophobic residues at the binding interface. The fact that ΔCp is very similar in the presence and absence of Ca2+ is consistent with the binding of the cTnC N-domain binding to cTnI being thermally neutral under these conditions (see Fig. 5 a). This suggests that the area of nonpolar residues buried at the cTnC C-terminal domain/cTnI interface is similar in the presence of Mg2+ or Ca2+.Figure 1The temperature dependence of ΔH associated with cTnC binding to cTnI. The ΔH for cTnC binding to cTnI was measured at eight temperatures. Assay conditions were 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.3 m KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, in the absence or presence of 1 mmCaCl2.

For conditions, see the legend to Fig. 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) If the cTnC·cTnI binding process results in a net release or absorption of protons then an equivalent number of protons must be absorbed or released by the buffer. This process will contribute to the observed ΔHfor cTnC·cTnI binding and therefore has to be accounted for. To assess whether there is a significant absorption or release of protons upon cTnC·cTnI complex formation ΔH was measured in experiments using buffers with enthalpies of ionization ranging from −2.35 to +36.51 kJ mol−1 (cacodylate, Pipes, MOPS, and imidazole) (24Christensen J.J. Hansen L.D. Handbook of Proton Ionization Heats. Wiley, New York1976Google Scholar). The results in Fig.2 show that the observed ΔHchanged very little, either in the presence or absence of Ca2+, and was not dependent on the buffer, demonstrating that there was little or no net release or absorption of protons during binary complex formation. Initially the experiments were performed in the presence of 0.3 m KCl to allow comparison with previous work (25Al-Hillawi E. Bhandari D. Trayer H.R. Trayer I.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 962-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 26Dong W.J. Chandra M. Xing J. She M.D. Solaro R.J. Cheung H.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6754-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The result of a typical ITC experiment is illustrated in Fig. 3. A trace of the calorimetric titration of cTnI with cTnC in the absence of Ca2+ is shown (Fig. 3 a). The negative peaks show that the interaction is exothermic. Each deflection represents the heat released by cTnC binding to cTnI with each injection. The binding isotherm derived from these data is plotted in Fig. 3 b. This graph shows the integrated heats for each cTnC injectionversus the molar ratio of cTnC to cTnI. From these data the stoichiometry (n), binding constant (Ka ) and enthalpy (ΔH) of binding were obtained directly, and the changes in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) and entropy (TΔS) of binding were calculated using Equation 2. ΔG=−RT ln Ka=ΔH−TΔSEquation 2 The average Ka , ΔH, ΔG, and TΔS values from a minimum of five independent ITC binding experiments are given in TableI. As expected, theKa was ∼ 6-fold higher (17.4 × 107m−1) in the presence of Ca2+ than in the absence of Ca2+(2.7 × 107m−1). The binding stoichiometry was essentially 1:1 under both sets of conditions.Table IBinding parameters for complexation between cTnI and cTnC or cTnC C-domainSpecies bound to cTnIK a × 10−7nΔHΔGTΔSm −1kJ mol −1kJ mol −1kJ mol −1cTnC (−Ca2+)2.7 (±0.3)0.91 (±0.02)−34.6 (±1.4)−43.18.5cTnC (+Ca2+)17.4 (±1.6)0.79 (±0.02)−92.5 (±2.0)−47.8−44.6cTnC C-domain (−Ca2+)1.2 (±0.2)0.89 (±0.05)−39.5 (±2.4)−41.11.6cTnC C-domain (+Ca2+)10.0 (±2.5)0.79 (±0.05)−76.6 (±5.2)−46.4−30.2The binding parameters were obtained from data similar to those shown in Fig. 3.

Open table in a new tab The binding parameters were obtained from data similar to those shown in Fig. 3. The parameters are given as the mean ± S.E. obtained from a minimum of five independent determinations. Assay conditions were: 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.3 m KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA (−Ca2+), with or without 1 mm CaCl2 (+Ca2+). 6 μm (−Ca2+) or 3 μm (+Ca2+) cTnI was titrated with 5 μl of 160 μm (−Ca2+) or 60 μm (+Ca2+) cTnC or cTnC C-domain. Initial studies of the binding of the cTnC N- and C-domains were carried out under conditions identical to those employed for intact cTnC. The results summarized in Table I show striking similarities for the thermodynamic properties of whole cTnC and cTnC C-domain binding to cTnI. The large negative enthalpy change drives complex formation in both cases although there is a small entropic contribution in the absence of Ca2+. The affinities of cTnC and cTnC C-domain for cTnI were very similar in the presence of Ca2+ but higher than those in the absence of Ca2+. This indicates that the C-terminal domain of cTnC is the major contributor to the overall binding affinity of cTnC to cTnI. We find that Ca2+-saturated cTnC C-domain binds to cTnI with an 8 fold higher affinity than the Mg2+-saturated cTnC C-domain. Control binding assays with increased concentrations of Mg2+ (up to 10 mm) gave binding parameters identical to assays performed under standard conditions, indicating that the cTnC C-domain was fully saturated with Mg2+ in the presence of 3 mm Mg2+. Attempts to monitor the binding of the isolated cTnC N-domain to cTnI in the presence of Ca2+ proved unsuccessful in the presence of 0.3 m KCl, even at different temperatures (data not shown). Consequently studies were undertaken to investigate the effect of ionic strength on the binding of whole cTnC, cTnC N- and C-domains to cTnI. The effect of increasing ionic strength on the binding of cTnC to cTnI is shown in Fig.4 a. In the absence of Ca2+ (Mg2+ only) the affinity of cTnC for cTnI decreased as the ionic strength was increased, whereas in the presence of Ca2+ the affinity increased as ionic strength was increased. Similar trends were observed when cTnI was titrated with cTnC C-domain (Fig. 4 b). In the absence of Ca2+the affinity of the cTnC C-domain for cTnI decreased dramatically as the ionic strength was increased, and in the presence of Ca2+ the affinity of cTnC C-domain for cTnI increased slightly as ionic strength was increased. cTnC N-domain bound to cTnI in both the presence and absence of Ca2+ in the 0–0.1 m KCl range. In the presence of Ca2+, binding of the cTnC N-domain to cTnI was exothermic, equimolar, decreased slightly as ionic strength was increased, and was ∼8-fold weaker than that of the cTnC C-domain under similar conditions (Fig. 4 b). In the absence of Ca2+, binding was endothermic and therefore must be entropically driven. However, conditions could not be found to increase the cTnC N-domain/cTnI stoichiometry much beyond ∼0.5, making the data difficult to interpret. The endothermic binding of cTnC N-domain to cTnI in the absence of Ca2+ also appeared to contribute to the binding of whole cTnC to cTnI, at concentrations of KCl less than 0.1 m, giving rise to a two-site binding curve that was difficult to interpret, hence these data are not shown. The effect of varying the ionic strength on ΔH and TΔS of cTnC and its isolated domains binding to cTnI resulted in the linear plots shown in Fig. 5, a and b, respectively. The thermodynamic parameters of cTnC C-domain binding to cTnI closely paralleled those obtained with whole cTnC both in the presence and absence of Ca2+ and were quite dissimilar to those observed for the cTnC N-domain. The ΔH observed for cTnC N-domain binding to cTnI approached zero as the ionic strength was increased. Because ITC monitors the heat change as a result of complex formation a very small ΔH made it difficult to measure cTnC N-domain/cTnI binding affinities at ionic strengths greater than 0.1 m. The ΔH and TΔSresults show that changes in enthalpy were the driving force for the interaction between cTnC and cTnC C-domain with cTnI both in the presence and absence of Ca2+, as both ΔH andTΔS values were negative over most of the range of salt concentrations studied. The interaction between cTnC N-domain and cTnI is entropically favorable at low salt concentrations and entropy would be the only driving force at physiological ionic strength (as determined from extrapolation of Fig. 5, a andb). Because of the potential of cTnI to aggregate it was important to show that aggregation was not the cause of differences in cTnC·cTnI binding observed at different ionic strengths. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were therefore performed on cTnI under the conditions used for ITC. A typical plot illustrating the relationship between the lnf and the square of the distance from the axis of rotation (r 2) is shown in Fig.6. The linear relationship of this analysis over the entire length of the solution column demonstrates that the cTnI is monodisperse in solution. Furthermore, this linearity was observed over all of the KCl and protein concentrations used and in the presence and absence of Ca2+. The estimated molecular mass obtained for cTnI by sedimentation equilibrium, by averaging the molecular mass at all KCl conditions, was 22.6 ± 1.1 kDa (S.E.)."

We have developed an in vitro assay to study the mechanism of dinucleotide repeat expansion. The primer-template resembles a base excision repair substrate with a single nucleotide gap centered opposite a tract of nine CA repeats; nonrepeat sequences flank the dinucleotide repeats. DNA polymerases are expected to repair the gap, but further extension is possible if the DNA polymerase can displace the downstream oligonucleotide. We report here that the wild type bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase carries out gap and strand displacement replication and also catalyzes a dinucleotide expansion reaction. Repeat expansion was not detected for an exonuclease-deficient T4 DNA polymerase or for Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. The dinucleotide repeat expansion reaction catalyzed by wild type T4 DNA polymerase required a downstream oligonucleotide to “stall” replication and 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity to remove the 3′-nonrepeat sequence adjacent to the repeat tract in the template strand. These results suggest that dinucleotide repeat expansion may be stimulated in vivo during DNA repair or during processing of Okazaki fragments.

DNA polymerases replicate DNA with high fidelity except for certain DNA sequences, the so-called “slippery” DNAs, which are tracts of simple repeat sequences (reviewed in Ref. 1Kunkel T.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 207-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The lengths of tracts of mono-, di-, and trinucleotide repeats are unstable, which can easily be detected as repeat-length polymorphisms in microsatellite sequences or as mutation hot spots, such as the classical frameshift hot spots identified by Benzer in the bacteriophage T4 rIIgenes (2Benzer S. Genetics. 1960; 47: 403-415Google Scholar), which are tracts of six A nucleotides (3Pribnow D. Sigurdson D.C. Gold L. Singer B.S. Napoli C. Brosius J. Dull T.J. Noller H.F. J. Mol.

Hypermutability in repeat tracts can have serious consequences for human health as observed for an inherited mutation in the humanAPC gene, which converts the wild type sequence AAATAAAA to the A8 mononucleotide tract (4Laken S.J.

This “slippage” intermediate is usually repaired by postreplication mismatch repair as revealed by the dramatic increase in repeat instability when this repair pathway is inactivated (6Levinson G.

The number of repeats can be amplified several hundred-fold by a variety of DNA polymerases, but most of the synthetic DNA substrates used are composed exclusively of repeat sequences. One objective of our studies was to develop an improvedin vitro assay utilizing a DNA substrate that more closely resembles genomic DNA in which the repeat tract is flanked by nonrepeat sequences. A second objective was to use the more natural DNA substrate to probe the mechanism of DNA polymerase slippage. Both objectives were achieved with a DNA substrate in which a single nucleotide gap was positioned opposite the center of the dinucleotide repeat sequence (AC)9. The AC dinucleotide repeat was chosen because poly(AC/GT)10–30 is the most common simple repeat in many eukaryotic genomes (15Hamada H. Petrino M.G. Kakunaga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6465-6469Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Nonrepeat sequences were positioned on both sides of the (AC)9 dinucleotide tract, as found in genomic DNA. The nonrepeat sequences also allowed precise annealing of the template and primer strands. A single nucleotide-gapped substrate is produced in vivo during base excision repair. A similar substrate is also produced when DNA polymerases have nearly completed repair synthesis of the larger gaps formed by nucleotide excision repair and postreplication mismatch repair and during lagging strand replication when the replicating DNA polymerase reaches the RNA primer of the next Okazaki fragment. We examined replication of the single nucleotide-gapped DNA substrate by wild type and exonuclease-deficient T4 DNA polymerases and byEscherichia coli DNA polymerase I. Dinucleotide expansion was detected only for the wild type T4 DNA polymerase. While many previous in vitro assays detected repeat expansion by exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerases, our studies demonstrate that not only does the wild type T4 DNA polymerase, which has a potent 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity, catalyze repeat expansion, but that the exonuclease activity stimulates the expansion reaction. We have proposed a model for repeat expansion based on our new findings. Purifications of the bacteriophage T4 wild type and the exonuclease-deficient D112A/E114A-DNA polymerases have been described (16Reha-Krantz L.J. Nonay R.L. J. Biol.

E. coli DNA polymerase I and Klenow fragment were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The DNA substrates used in this study are described in Fig. 1. The oligonucleotides were synthesized using standard procedures by the DNA synthesis facility in the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Alberta. Two types of hydrolysis-resistant oligonucleotides were prepared. A 3′-phosphate was introduced by using a phosphate-derivatized CPG (Glen Research, Sterling, VA). A 3′-phosphate prevents both DNA polymerase nucleotide incorporation and 3′→5′ exonuclease activities. Hydrolysis activity was prevented specifically at the 3′-end of the primer strand by a nonbridging phosphorothioate (Sp isomer). The phosphorothioate modification inhibits 3′→5′ exonuclease activity, but the phosphorothioate-modified primer still supports the nucleotide incorporation reaction. Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides were prepared using a sulferizing reagent (Glen Research). Two diastereomers,Rp and Sp, are produced in about equal amounts, but the Rp-phosphorothioate oligonucleotide is degraded by the 3′→5′ exonuclease activity of T4 DNA polymerase while leaving the exonuclease-resistant Sp-oligonucleotide (18Gupta A.

The appropriate bands were cut from the gels, and the DNA was eluted from the gel slices and further purified by chromatography through Sep-Pak cartridges (Waters). The primer or template strands were labeled at the 5′-end by T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The template and primer strands were annealed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 25 mm NaCl. The32P-labeled oligonucleotide was present at 50 nm, and unlabeled oligonucleotides were present in 2-fold excess at 100 nm. The solution was heated at 80 °C for 5 min and slow cooled to room temperature (90 min). Reaction mixtures (50 μl) contained 5 nm DNA substrate, 50 nm DNA polymerase, 67.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 100 μm dNTPs, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 mm EDTA. The mixtures were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and then reactions were started by the addition of MgCl2 (final concentration, 8 mm). Reactions were stopped at various times by removing 5-μl samples and mixing with an equal volume of gel loading buffer, which contained formamide and gel buffer. Denaturing gel electrophoresis in 15% polyacrylamide plus 8 m urea was used to separate the reaction products. The 32P-labeled products were visualized by using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). 32P-Labeled reaction products were cut from preparative polyacrylamide gels and purified as described above. The Maxam and Gilbert sequencing procedure was followed (20Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (9015) Google Scholar). In vitro replication of the AC repeat-containing template strand was first measured in a primer extension assay. The 32P-labeled primer was annealed to the template strand (Fig. 1 a). T4 DNA polymerase extended the primer to produce full-length 30-mer product within the first 15 s of reaction (Fig.2 A). No products longer than the 30-mer were detected. A single nucleotide gap was created by annealing the 32P-labeled primer plus a second, “downstream” oligonucleotide that is complementary to the 5′-end of the template strand (Fig. 1 b). A time course for replication of the gapped DNA substrate by T4 DNA polymerase is shown in Fig.2 B. After 15 s of replication, the primer was extended by one nucleotide to fill in the gap (14-mer), but longer 15-mer, 16-mer, and 18-mer products as well as high amounts of full-length 30-mer product were also produced. Synthesis of products longer than 14 nucleotides indicates that the T4 DNA polymerase can displace the downstream oligonucleotide. At later time points, the amounts of the shorter 14-, 15-, and 16-mer products decreased, while replication products longer than the full-length 30-mer were produced. By 1 min, and more clearly at 10 min, products were synthesized that appeared to be longer than 30 nucleotides by the addition of dinucleotide units, the gel bands indicated as +2, +4, +6, etc. At 10 min, repeat expansion products represented about 13% of the replication products that were full-length or longer. The band indicated at the +2-position (Fig. 2 B) was excised from a preparative gel and sequenced by the Maxam and Gilbert chemical sequencing method (20Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (9015) Google Scholar); the sequencing gel is shown in Fig.3. The primary sequence for the +2 product has 10 GT repeats instead of the nine expected from the nine AC repeats in the template strand. The 10 GT repeats are followed by the nonrepeat ACCCCACC sequence. A faint secondary sequence with an additional GT repeat can also be seen in the region of the bracket (Fig. 3), which is due to the presence of a second minor DNA product. For the longer apparent +4, +6 products, etc., there are 11, 12, etc. GT repeats, respectively, which are followed by the nonrepeat sequence (data not shown). Thus, wild type T4 DNA polymerase catalyzes a dinucleotide expansion reaction, which is followed by accurate replication of the nonrepeat template sequence.Figure 2Primer extension and dinucleotide expansion by the wild type T4 DNA polymerase. Primer extension (A) and gap repair assays (B) were done with the DNA substrates described in Fig. 1, a and b, respectively.

The same primer and downstream oligonucleotides were used, which produced a single-stranded gap of 23 nucleotides. Dinucleotide expansion by the wild type T4 DNA polymerase was detected with the longer DNA substrate to the same extent as observed with the shorter DNA substrate (data not shown). Experiments reported in Fig. 2 with the wild type T4 DNA polymerase were repeated with the exonuclease-deficient D112A/E114A-DNA polymerase. No dinucleotide repeat expansion was detected for the exonuclease-deficient T4 DNA polymerase with either the primer extension (Fig. 4 A) or the single nucleotide-gapped DNA substrate (Fig. 4 B). Displacement synthesis was more rapid by the exonuclease-deficient T4 DNA polymerase compared with the wild type enzyme, since little pausing to produce the gap-filled 14-mer product or other products shorter than full-length was observed (Fig. 4 B, 15 s). A product apparently one nucleotide longer than the full-length product (+1) was detected at 10 min, which is probably due to the nontemplated extension of the primer strand that is observed for many exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerases at the ends of duplex DNA. Since dinucleotide expansion was not detected for the exonuclease-deficient T4 DNA polymerase, expansion by the wild type enzyme must require 3′→5′ exonuclease activity at some step in the expansion reaction. Dinucleotide expansion was detected for the exonuclease-deficient T4 DNA polymerase, however, if only two of the four dNTPs, dGTP and dTTP, were supplied (Fig. 5 B), but not for the wild type T4 DNA polymerase (Fig. 5 A). Replication terminated for the wild type DNA polymerase once replication of the repeat region was completed (22-mer). For the exonuclease-deficient T4 DNA polymerase, a major product with an extra GT repeat (+2) was detected within the first minute of reaction. With longer reaction times, the amount of +2 product decreased, while the amount of +4 and longer products increased. Thus, elongation of misaligned primer-termini by the exonuclease-deficient T4 DNA polymerase produces relatively stable replication products. The absence of dinucleotide expansion products (longer than the 22-mer) for the wild type T4 DNA polymerase indicates that exonucleolytic proofreading efficiently corrects any expansion products. The presence or absence of the downstream oligonucleotide had no effect on reactions with dGTP and dTTP. In order to determine at what step exonuclease activity is needed for the dinucleotide expansion catalyzed by the wild type T4 DNA polymerase, the three 3′-ends present in the gapped DNA substrate were modified. Besides the primer terminus, the downstream oligonucleotide and the template strand have 3′-ends that are potential substrates for the T4 DNA polymerase 3′→5′ exonuclease activity. A nonbridging phosphorothioate (Sp isomer) was placed at the 3′-terminal phosphodiester bond in the primer strand to protect the primer from exonuclease digestion, while still allowing the primer to be used for nucleotide incorporation. Dinucleotide expansion was detected with the phosphorothioate-modified primer (Fig.6, lane 1) and when the downstream oligonucleotide was also modified with a 3′-phosphate, which prevents both exonuclease and nucleotide incorporation reactions (Fig. 1 c; Fig. 6, lane 4). Protection of the 3′-ends of the primer and downstream oligonucleotide from exonuclease digestion increased the expansion reaction. About 21% of the full-length and longer replication products in Fig. 6, lane 1, were expansion products and 56% in Fig. 6, lane 4, but only 13% of the replication products were expansion products in the absence of any 3′-protection after a 10-min reaction (Fig.2 B). Dinucleotide expansion was reduced to an almost undetectable level by phosphorylation of the 3′-end of the template strand (Fig. 1,d and e; Fig. 6, lanes 2 and3, respectively). These results demonstrate that exonuclease trimming at the 3′-end of the template strand is required for production of high amounts of expansion products. The extent of exonuclease digestion of the template strand required to support dinucleotide expansion was determined by placing nonbridging phosphorothioates at various positions at the 3′-end of the template strand. Dinucleotide expansion was restored only if the phosphorothioate was placed so that T4 DNA polymerase 3′→5′ exonuclease activity could remove the 3′-terminal nonrepeat sequence in the template strand. This point was demonstrated by constructing a template strand without the nonrepeat sequence and with anSp phosphorothioate at the 3′-end to prevent further exonuclease trimming (Fig. 1 f); a strong dinucleotide expansion reaction (83% expansion product compared with 17% full-length) was observed (Fig. 6, lane 5). Also note that without the 3′-terminal nonrepeat sequence in the template strand, there was some imprecise annealing of the primer strand, which produced a few products shorter than the full-length 30-mer. Removal of the nonrepeat sequence, however, still did not allow the exonuclease-deficient T4 DNA polymerase to carry out the expansion reaction. Since the exonuclease-deficient T4 DNA polymerase may extend the phosphorothioate-modified DNA and resynthesize the nonrepeat sequence, the experiment was repeated with a DNA substrate in which the 3′-end of the template strand was protected with a 3′-phosphate, which prevents both degradation and extension (Fig. 1 g). Products longer than full length were detected for the wild type (Fig.7 A) and 3′→5′ exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerases (Fig. 7 B). The distinctive dinucleotide expansion ladder was detected for the wild type T4 DNA polymerase but not for the exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerase; instead, products longer than the full-length template strand increased in length by apparent single nucleotide extensions, +1, +2, +3, etc. The single nucleotide extensions were probably produced by a combination of dinucleotide expansion followed by an untemplated primer extension, which is catalyzed by exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerases (Fig. 4). Products shorter than the full-length 30-mer were also observed (indicated byasterisks). These products appear to be due to imprecise primer annealings in which there may be base pairing between the G residues in the nonrepeat sequence of the primer strand and the C residues in the repeat tract in the template strand. The exonuclease trimming of the template strand suggested to us that DNA replication may also be taking place at the 3′-end of the template strand. This proposal was tested by using the same DNA substrate that supports dinucleotide expansion of the primer (Fig. 1 c), except that the 5′-end of the template strand was labeled with32P (Fig. 1 h). Dinucleotide expansion in the template strand was detected only if the downstream oligonucleotide was present (Fig. 8), as observed for expansion in the primer strand (Fig. 2 B). The apparent +2template product was sequenced (Fig.9). An extra dinucleotide repeat (AC) was present, and the repeat sequence was followed by the adjacent nonrepeat sequence.Figure 9DNA sequence of the template +2 dinucleotide expansion product. Products of chemical reactions to detect modified G, modified T, modified A+G, and modified C by the Maxam and Gilbert procedure (20Maxam A.M. Gilbert W.

There are 10 AC dinucleotides that are flanked by the nonrepeat sequences.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The experiments with the primer extension and gapped DNA substrates were repeated withE. coli DNA polymerase I and Klenow fragment. No dinucleotide expansion was detected (data not shown). Rapid displacement replication was observed for both bacterial DNA polymerases, as observed for the exonuclease-deficient T4 DNA polymerase (Fig. 4). We have demonstrated that the wild type T4 DNA polymerase, which has a potent 3′→5′ exonuclease activity (16Reha-Krantz L.J. Nonay R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27100-27108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), can catalyze a dinucleotide expansion reaction with a single nucleotide-gapped DNA substrate with nine AC repeats in the template strand in the presence of all four dNTPs (Fig. 2 B). Since the dinucleotide repeats are embedded between nonrepeat sequences, this assay allows us to study dinucleotide expansion under conditions that may occur naturally in the cell during repair of gaps produced by various DNA repair activities and when lagging strand replication reaches the primer for the next Okazaki fragment. The expansion products have extra dinucleotide repeats that are followed by the adjacent nonrepeat sequence (Fig. 3). Thus, this assay detects both the strand misalignment phase of the expansion reaction and the switch to accurate replication of the nonrepeat template sequence. The critical step for repeat expansion was the requirement that DNA replication be hindered within the repeat tract. We combined results from in vitro dinucleotide expansion reactions with in vivo observations to formulate the following models for repeat expansion. The first step in the repeat expansion reaction is DNA polymerase pausing and dissociation during replication of a repeat tract, which was forced in our assay due to the presence of a downstream oligonucleotide (Fig. 10 A). Although our experiments were with the T4 DNA polymerase and not the highly processive T4 DNA polymerase holoenzyme, rapid dissociation for the holoenzyme is also observed when replication is barred under conditions that mimic an encounter with the 5′-end of an Okazaki fragment (21Hacker K.J. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24221-24228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, results presented in this report are consistent with the proposal by others that frameshift mutagenesis is stimulated by DNA polymerase dissociation and reassociation (13Kunkel T.A. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6830-6834Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 22Kroutil L.C. Frey M.W. Kaboord B.F. Kunkel T.A. Benkovic S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We have extended these findings by demonstrating that DNA polymerase encounters with downstream DNA stimulate repeat expansion (Fig. 2, compareA and B). Furthermore, dramatic expansion may result if repeat expansion can take place on both strands (Figs. 6 and8). These results suggest that DNA damage resulting in strand breaks on both strands within a repeat tract, as illustrated in Fig.10 A, has the potential, if acted on by DNA polymerases, to greatly expand the length of the repeat tract. The second step is continued primer extension with displacement of the downstream strand. This step may involve several cycles of DNA polymerase dissociation and reassociation. Displacement of the 5′-end of the downstream strand creates a “flap” of unpaired single-stranded DNA (Fig. 10 A). The 5′-flap structure may be in equilibrium with a structure in which the 3′-end of the primer strand is unpaired (3′-flap). The 3′-flap structure may spontaneously convert to a structure with a base-paired primer terminus but with one or more internal repeats not base-paired. Alternatively, the DNA polymerase may facilitate strand misalignment by binding the 3′-end of the single-stranded flap directly in the exonuclease active center (23Bloom L.B. Otto M.R. Eritja R. Reha-Krantz L.J. Goodman M.F. Beechem J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7576-7586Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) but then occasionally transferring the primer end to the polymerase active center in a misaligned configuration (24Hadjimarcou M.I. Construction and in Vivo Characterization of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA Polymerase Delta Exonuclease Mutant. M.S. thesis. University of Alberta, 1999Google Scholar,25Fujii S. Akiyama K. Sugaya Y.

Kokoska, T. D. Petes, and L. J. Reha-Krantz, manuscript in preparation. In either case, extension of the misaligned primer strand results in expansion of the repeat tract. The proposed role of a 5′-flap structure in repeat expansion is supported by the finding that deletion of the RAD27 gene inSaccharomyces cerevisiae increases repeat length instability, primarily to expand repeat tracts (26Johnson R.E. Kovali G.K. Prakash L. Prakash S. Science. 1995; 269: 238-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 27Tishkoff D.X. Filosi N. Gaida G.M. Kolodner R.D.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2779-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). TheRAD27 gene encodes a flap endonuclease. If this activity is missing, then persistent flap structures may increase the opportunity to produce the misaligned DNA structures illustrated in Fig.10 A. Several points in this model warrant further discussion. First, there was greater dinucleotide expansion activity with the in vitro assay than would be expected in vivo. Dinucleotide expansion may be limited in vivo if the optimal conditions for expansion are not met. For example, strand breakage in both strands within or near a repeat tract (Fig.10 A) is probably a rare event. Rapid DNA ligation or binding of other proteins to strand discontinuities would prevent DNA polymerase binding. The cell may also selectively utilize DNA polymerases for gap repair that are less prone to frameshift infidelity than T4 DNA polymerase, such as E. coli DNA polymerase I, which does not catalyze detectable repeat expansion in our in vitro reaction. The 5′→3′ exonuclease activity of E. coli DNA polymerase I would prevent formation of a 5′-flap and, thus, reduce opportunity for strand misalignment. Another point to explain is the low level of dinucleotide expansion by the exonuclease-deficient T4 DNA polymerase in our in vitroassays (Figs. 4 and 7) but the high amount of repeat length instability detected for exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerases in vivo, such as for the exonuclease-deficient yeast DNA polymerase δ (29Morrison A. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Sugino A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1467-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and for the T4 D112A/E114A-DNA polymerase. 2L. J. Reha-Krantz, unpublished data. There are two reasons why exonuclease deficiency reduces repeat expansion in our assay. First, there is little expansion detected if the nonrepeat sequence at the 3′-end of the template strand cannot be removed by exonuclease degradation (Fig. 6, lanes 2 and 3). Second, the short downstream oligonucleotide was displaced and dislodged too readily by the exonuclease-deficient T4 DNA polymerase, which means that primer elongation within the repeat tract was not hindered as much for the exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerase as for the wild type enzyme. When primer elongation was confined to the repeat tract, however, as forced in reactions in which only dGTP and dTTP were supplied, the exonuclease-deficient T4 DNA polymerase catalyzed a strong expansion reaction (Fig. 5 B). Exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerases may increase misalignment mutagenesis in vivo because of increased ability to displace downstream DNA. The exonuclease-deficient T4 DNA polymerase is more proficient at displacement replication than the wild type T4 DNA polymerase (compare Figs. 2 and 4, 15-s time points) because the elongating primer strand is not subject to proofreading by the mutant. A synergism between DNA polymerase proofreading and removal of RNA primers and 5′-flap structures has been observed in yeast; a haploid strain with an exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerase δ and no flap endonuclease is not viable (28Kokoska R. Stefanovic L. Tran H.T. Resnick M.A. Gordenin D.A. Petes T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2779-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The lethal phenotype of the double mutant may be due to the higher production of 5′-flap structures due to increased strand displacement replication by the exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerase δ compared with the wild type enzyme, which could lead to persistent strand discontinuities and/or intolerable levels of misalignment mutagenesis (error catastrophe). Exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerases may also be more prone to misalignment errors at sites of DNA damage than exonuclease-proficient DNA polymerases. DNA damage presents a severe block to replication (Fig. 10 B). Exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerases may synthesize extra copies of the repeat as was observed in the reaction with dGTP and dTTP (Fig. 5 B) and as illustrated in Fig.10 B. The wild type T4 DNA polymerase did not catalyze dinucleotide expansion when just dGTP and dTTP were supplied (Fig.5 A) because of correction by exonucleolytic proofreading; hence, less repeat expansion at DNA damage sites is expected for proofreading-proficient DNA polymerases. In conclusion, we have identified conditions in an in vitroassay that stimulate dinucleotide expansion by a wild type DNA polymerase that functions in chromosome replication. The primary instigator of DNA polymerase-catalyzed expansion is that DNA replication is hindered within a repeat tract. The assay provides a starting point to further probe the mechanism(s) of DNA polymerase-catalyzed repeat expansion.

Nishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15388-15393Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the overproduction of Ntf2p confers the ts+ phenotype to Δmog1 cells. Ntf2p is also essential for nuclear protein import (15Moore M.S. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10212-10216Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 16Paschal B.M. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 129: 925-937Crossref Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In order to clarify the function of Mog1p in the Ran GTPase cycle, recombinant Mog1p was produced in Escherichia coli and purified. Interestingly, recombinant Mog1p releases a nucleotide from GTP-Gsp1p but not from GDP-Gsp1p. It did not interfere with Prp20p, theS. cerevisiae RCC1 homologue, or with Rna1p, the S. cerevisiae RanGAP1 homologue. Yrb1p, the S. cerevisiaeRanBP1 homologue which inhibits the RCC1-stimulated nucleotide release, also inhibited the Mog1p-stimulated nucleotide release from GTP-Gsp1p but not from GTP-Gsp1ΔC. Gsp1ΔC lacks the final eight amino acids of the C terminus, and for this reason, the interaction between Yrb1p and Gsp1ΔC was strongly reduced. However, Gsp1ΔC still binds to Mog1p, with an efficiency higher than when wild-type (wt)1 Gsp1p binds to Mog1p. The strong interaction between Mog1p and Gsp1ΔC should be a clue toward clarifying Mog1p function in the Ran GTPase cycle, which is as yet unknown. S. cerevisiae wild-type strain, YPH499, and E. coli strains, BL21(DE3) and XL1-blue, were used for producing recombinant proteins and for plasmid engineering, as described previously (17Kuhlmann J. Macara I. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12027-12035Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The media used for yeast and bacteria have also been described previously (18Nishiwaki H.

The deletion of the C terminus of Gsp1p was accomplished using polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis to introduce a stop codon and remove the final 8 amino acid residues of the open reading frame. The coding region of the GSP1 gene was amplified using as primers 5′-CAT TTA TAT TTA TCC ATG GCT GCC CCA G-3′ and 5′-CCC TTA TAA ATCA GCA TAA GCT TAA TCT TAC AAT GGC AAA GCA G-3′. The resulting GSP1 C DNA was digested with the restriction enzymes NcoI and HindIII and then inserted into the NcoI/HindIII sites of pGEX-KG. The E. coli strains, BL21 (DE3)/pGEX-MOG1, BL21(DE3)/pGEX-PRP20, BL21 (DE3)/pGEX-YRB1Δ1-9, and BL21(DE3)/pGEX-RNA1, were each cultured individually in 750 ml of SB medium at 30 °C up to an OD660 of 0.4, treated with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration 0.2 mm) for 4 h, and then collected by centrifugation at 3,200 rpm for 15 min. Cells were lysed, and GST-fused proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (9Noguchi E. Hayashi N. Azuma Y. Seki T. Nakamura M. Nakashima N. Yanagida M. He X. Mueller U. Sazer S. Nishimoto T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5595-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). GST-fused proteins were eluted by reduced glutathione as described (20Noguchi E. Saitoh Y. Sazer S. Nishimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1999; 125: 574-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or else treated with thrombin as described (9Noguchi E. Hayashi N. Azuma Y. Seki T. Nakamura M. Nakashima N. Yanagida M. He X. Mueller U. Sazer S. Nishimoto T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5595-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). After digestion with thrombin, GST beads were spun down. The resulting supernatant was adjusted to the MonoQ column buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mm KPi (pH 7.4), and 1 mm DTT) and then charged onto a MonoQ column. Both Mog1p and Prp20p were eluted between 300 and 400 mmNaCl, whereas Yrb1p and Rna1p were eluted between 100 and 200 mm and between 400 and 500 mm NaCl, respectively. The E. coil strains, BL21 (DE3)/pGEX-wtGSP1 or GSP1ΔC, were cultured in 7.5 liters of SB medium at 30 °C up to an OD660 of 0.4, treated with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration 0.2 mm) for 4 h, and then collected by centrifugation at 3,200 rpm for 15 min. After cell lysis, GST-fused Gsp1p was purified in the presence of 1 mm GTP or GDP, using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (20Noguchi E. Saitoh Y. Sazer S. Nishimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1999; 125: 574-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After digestion with thrombin, GST beads were spun down. The resulting supernatant containing Gsp1 proteins was incubated with 1 mm GTP or GDP, adjusted to 25 mm Pipes (pH 6.5), 10 mm KPi (pH 6.5), 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and charged onto the SO3− column. GTP-Gsp1p and GDP-Gsp1p were eluted at between 500 and 600 mm and between 150 and 250 mm NaCl, respectively. Recombinant wtGsp1p and Gsp1ΔC were loaded with [γ-32P]GTP (30 Ci/mmol nucleotide; 2.0 mCi/ml; usually in a 40-μl volume) or [α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol nucleotide; 10 mCi/ml; usually in a 15-μl volume) in loading buffer (total 500 μl) as described (19Noguchi E. Hayashi N. Nakashima N. Nishimoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Uncharged free nucleotides were removed with NAP™5 (Sephadex™ G-25 DNA Grade (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 10 pmol of [γ-32P]- or [α-32P]GTP-wtGsp1p and Gsp1ΔC were suspended in GAP buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT and 1 mm CHAPS) (total 200 μl), incubated at 30 °C for 5 min, and then given Rna1p and Mog1p. After incubation at 30 °C for the indicated time, the reaction was stopped by the addition of the ice-cold stopping buffer (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 25 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl), and the mixture was then filtered through a nitrocellulose filter (0.45 μm, BA85, Schleicher & Schuell). The filters were dried, and the radioactivity remaining with proteins on the filter was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. The amount of32P bound at t = 0 was defined as 100%, these being 12,000–42,000 dpm ([γ-32P]GTP-wtGsp1p), 300,000–500,000 dpm ([γ-32P]GTP-Gsp1ΔC), 670,000–710,000 dpm ([α-32P]GTP-wtGsp1p), and 910,000–1,020,000 dpm ([α-32P]GTP-Gsp1ΔC) in different experiments. The radioactivity remaining on Gsp1p was estimated as described (19Noguchi E. Hayashi N. Nakashima N. Nishimoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed in triplicate, unless otherwise indicated. The mean value and the error bar calculated were shown. 5 μl of the [α-32P]GTP-Gsp1p mixture were boiled, spotted on PEI-cellulose F (Merck) to be separated in TLC buffer (1m LiCl and 1 m formic acid) for 90 min, and then analyzed by autoradiography (21Bochner B.R. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9759-9769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant wtGsp1p and Gsp1ΔC were loaded with [3H]GDP or -GTP (25–50 Ci/mmol nucleotide, 1.0 mCi/ml; usually in a 25-μl volume) in loading buffer (500 μl) as described (19Noguchi E. Hayashi N. Nakashima N. Nishimoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Ten pmol of [3H]GDP- or [3H]GTP-wtGsp1p and -Gsp1ΔC were preincubated in guanine nucleotide exchange factor buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm CHAPS, and 2 mm GDP or GTP) (total 200 μl). After incubation at 30 °C for 5 min, Mog1p and Prp20p were added to start the reaction. The reaction was stopped by the addition of the ice-cold stopping buffer (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 25 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl), and the mixture was then filtered through a nitrocellulose filter (0.45 μm, BA85, Schleicher & Schuell). The filters were dried, and the radioactivity remaining with proteins on the filter was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. The amount of3H bound at t = 0 was defined as 100%, these being 17,000–21,000 dpm ([3H]GDP-wtGsp1p), 12,000–15,000 dpm ([3H]GTP-wtGsp1p), 150,000–180,000 dpm ([3H]GDP-Gsp1ΔC), and 130,000–160,000 dpm ([3H]GTP-Gsp1ΔC), in different experiments. The radioactivity remaining on Gsp1p was estimated as described (19Noguchi E. Hayashi N. Nakashima N. Nishimoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed in triplicate, unless otherwise indicated. The mean value and the error bar calculated were shown. Eighty pmol of GTP-Gsp1p, Mog1p, and Yrb1p were mixed in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT). After incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, the mixtures were filtrated in HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200-pg (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Each fraction was separated by 11.25% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes that were stained with the antibodies to Gsp1p (19Noguchi E. Hayashi N. Nakashima N. Nishimoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), Mog1p (11Oki M. Nishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15388-15393Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and Yrb1p (22Schlenstedt G. Wong D.H. Koepp D.M. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5367-5378Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Real time interaction analysis was performed with a BIAcore 2000 biosensor instrument (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden) (23End P. Gout I. Fry M.J. Panayotou G. Dnand R. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10066-10075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CM5 sensor chips and amine coupling kits were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The monoclonal antibody to the GST (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was immobilized on the CM5 sensor chip as recommended by the manufacturers, and then 0.2 μmGST-fused Mog1p or Yrb1p were injected to be trapped on the sensor chip through the mAb to the GST. Binding experiments were performed through the injection of purified recombinant GTP-wtGsp1p or Gsp1ΔC in buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.005% Tween 20. Evaluation and calculation of the binding parameters were carried out according to the manual Bia evaluation 2.1 software. Since Mog1p specifically binds to GTP-Gsp1p (11Oki M. Nishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15388-15393Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we first examined whether Mog1p stimulates the activity of RanGAP. In order to address this issue, recombinant GST fusion proteins of Mog1p and Rna1p were produced inE. coli, and highly purified by glutathione-Sepharose columns, before being cleaved to remove the GST through incubation with thrombin. The resulting Mog1p and Rna1p were further purified over MonoQ columns to become a single band stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (data not shown). Ten pmol of [γ-32P]GTP-wtGsp1p were mixed with both Rna1p and Mog1p and, as a control, Rna1p, Mog1p, or buffer alone. After incubation at 30 °C for the indicated time, the radioactivity remaining on Gsp1p was quantified using a liquid scintillation counter. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the RanGAP activity of Rna1p was enhanced by the addition of Mog1p. After incubation for 10 min, about 80% of the radioactivity of [γ-32P]GTP-Gsp1p was released, compared with 40% in the case of Rna1p alone. Surprisingly, the radioactivity of [γ-32P]GTP-wtGsp1p was significantly reduced by the addition of only Mog1p, although [γ-32P]GTP-wtGsp1p was stable following incubation in buffer alone. In order to confirm further the effect of Mog1p on GTP-Gsp1p, we used another substrate, Gsp1ΔC, that lacks the final eight amino acid residues of the C terminus, instead of wtGsp1p. When 10 pmol of [γ-32P]GTP-Gsp1ΔC were incubated with the same dose of Rna1p and Mog1p, the radioactivity was strongly reduced. For this reason, the doses of Rna1p and Mog1p, which reduced the radioactivity of [γ-32P]GTP-Gsp1ΔC by around 40–60% after incubation for 10 min, were used for a comparison. As shown in Fig.1 B, the RanGAP activity of Rna1p was enhanced by the addition of Mog1p. Furthermore, the radioactivity of [γ-32P]GTP-Gsp1ΔC was reduced by the addition of Mog1p alone at a concentration 3-fold less than in the case of wtGsp1p. In order to confirm the effect of Mog1p on Gsp1p, 10 pmol of [γ-32P]GTP-wtGsp1p or Gsp1ΔC were mixed with the increasing doses of Mog1p and then incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. At the doses of Mog1p higher than 10 pmol corresponding to the concentration of Gsp1p, the radioactivity of both wtGsp1p and Gsp1ΔC was significantly reduced (Fig. 1 C). Similar to the case of Rna1p, Gsp1ΔC is more sensitive to the action of Mog1p, compared with wtGsp1p. The radioactivity of [γ-32P]GTP-wtGsp1p and Gsp1ΔC was not reduced by the degradation of wtGsp1p and Gsp1ΔC, since the amount of wtGsp1p and Gsp1ΔC, which was estimated by immunoblotting analysis, was not changed by the addition of Mog1p during the incubation (Fig. 1 D). The above results indicated that Mog1p has either the ability to activate the GTPase of Gsp1p or to stimulate the nucleotide release from GTP-Gsp1p. In order to address this issue, we used [α-32P]GTP instead of [γ-32P]GTP. Ten pmol of [α-32P]GTP-wtGsp1p or Gsp1ΔC were mixed with increasing doses of Rna1p and, as a control, Mog1p. After incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, the radioactivity remaining on wtGsp1p or Gsp1ΔC was quantified using a liquid scintillation counter. As expected from the function of RanGAP that activates the hydrolysis of GTP-Ran (24Bischoff F.R. Klebe C. Kretschmer J. Wittinghofer A. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), the radioactivity of [α-32P]GTP-wtGsp1p or Gsp1ΔC was not reduced by the addition of Rna1p (Fig.2 A). To the contrary, it was significantly reduced by the addition of Mog1p at doses higher than 10 pmol (Fig. 2 B), as observed in Fig. 1 C. These results indicate that Mog1p has the activity to release a nucleotide from GTP-Gsp1p, rather than to activate Gsp1pGTPase. We further confirmed this finding with TLC analysis. Ten pmol of [α-32P]GTP-wtGsp1p and Gsp1ΔC were mixed with 100 fmol of Rna1p, at which dose the radioactivity of α-32P was not reduced (Fig. 2 A), and with 300 pmol of Mog1p, at which dose the radioactivity remaining on [α-32P]GTP-wtGsp1p and Gsp1ΔC was reduced to less than 20% of the original value (Fig. 2 B). After incubation for 10 min at 30 °C, the reaction mixtures were boiled, and the remaining nucleotides were separated by thin layer chromatography. As a control, the original mixtures without incubation were also boiled in order to analyze the nucleotides bound to wtGsp1p and Gsp1ΔC. The radioactivity of [α-32P]GTP and [α-32P]GDP was analyzed by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 2 C, all of the [α-32P]GTP bound to wtGsp1p or Gsp1ΔC was changed to [α-32P]GDP upon incubation with Rna1p (Fig. 2 C, wtGsp1p, lanes 3 and 4; Gsp1ΔC, lanes 9 and10). In contrast, the amount of GDP was not increased by incubation with Mog1p, indicating that Mog1p has no ability to activate Gsp1pGTPase. Thus far, only RCC1 has been known to have the ability to exchange the nucleotide on Ran (6Ribbeck K. Lipowsky G. Kent H.M. Stewart M. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6587-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 11Oki M. Nishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15388-15393Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). RCC1 stimulates a nucleotide release from GTP- or GDP-Ran (25Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Nature. 1991; 354: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). In this regard, we addressed the question of whether or not Mog1p also stimulates a nucleotide release from GDP-Gsp1p. Ten pmol of [3H]GDP-wtGsp1p or Gsp1ΔC and, as a control, [3H]GTP-wtGsp1p or Gsp1ΔC were mixed with increasing doses of Mog1p. After incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, the radioactivity remaining on Gsp1p was quantified using a liquid scintillation counter. The radioactivity of [3H]GDP-wtGsp1p did not decrease, whereas the radioactivity of [3H]GTP-wtGsp1p was clearly reduced by the same preparation of Mog1p (Fig. 3). The radioactivity of [3H]GDP-Gsp1ΔC was reduced at the doses of Mog1p greater than 100 pmol, although the reduction in the radioactivity of [3H]GDP-Gsp1ΔC was far less than in the case of [3H]GTP-Gsp1ΔC. These findings taken together led to the conclusion that Mog1p efficiently releases a nucleotide from GTP-Gsp1p but not from GDP-Gsp1p. The result of Gsp1ΔC may indicate that Mog1p can release a nucleotide from GDP-Gsp1p under certain conditions. We examined the possible functional interaction between Prp20p and Mog1p by kinetic analysis. Prp20p is the S. cerevisiaeRCC1 homologue. Ten pmol of [3H]GDP-wtGsp1p were mixed with both Prp20p (0.1 pmol) and Mog1p (60 pmol) and, as a control, with Prp20, Mog1p, or buffer alone. After incubation at 30 °C for the indicated time, the radioactivity remaining on Gsp1p was quantified using a liquid scintillation counter (Fig.4). As reported (19Noguchi E. Hayashi N. Nakashima N. Nishimoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the radioactivity of [3H]GDP-wtGsp1p was reduced by the addition of Prp20p (Fig. 4 A). The remaining radioactivity of [3H]GDP-wtGsp1p was almost identical between the mixture containing both Prp20p and Mog1p and the mixture containing Prp20p alone. This was not due to the inactivation of Mog1p, since the same preparation of Mog1p released nucleotide from [3H]GTP-wtGsp1p (Fig. 4 B). Upon the addition of Prp20p, the Mog1p-stimulated nucleotide release from [3H]GTP-wtGsp1p was further enhanced. The identical results were obtained by using [3H]GDP- and GTP-Gsp1ΔC as substrates (Fig. 4, C and D). In the case of Gsp1ΔC, we used 20 pmol as the dose of Mog1p for comparison, as described in Fig. 1. We thus concluded that Mog1p does not interfere with the Prp20-stimulated nucleotide release from GDP-Gsp1p or GTP-Gsp1p. Both Mog1p and Prp20p additively enhanced a nucleotide release from GTP-Gsp1p. RanBP1 has been known to inhibit RCC1-stimulated nucleotide release (26Bischoff F.R. Krebber H. Smirnova E. Dong W. Ponstingl H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In addition, the S. cerevisiae RanBP1 homologue, Yrb1p, also inhibits the Prp20p-stimulated nucleotide release (19Noguchi E. Hayashi N. Nakashima N. Nishimoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Based on these previous reports, we examined the functional relationship between Yrb1p and Mog1p. Ten pmol of [α-32P]GTP-wtGsp1p were mixed with 100 pmol of Mog1p and increasing doses of Yrb1p. After incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, the radioactivity remaining on Gsp1p was quantified using a liquid scintillation counter. At the doses of Yrb1p, higher than 10 pmol corresponding to the concentration of [α-32P]GTP-wtGsp1p, Yrb1p completely inhibited the Mog1p-stimulated nucleotide release from GTP-Gsp1p (Fig.5, open circles). This finding indicates that the interaction between Yrb1p and GTP-wtGsp1p is important for Yrb1p to inhibit Mog1p-stimulated GTP release. Ran lacking the C-terminal amino acids conserved in the Ran family is unable to bind tightly to RanBP1 (17Kuhlmann J. Macara I. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12027-12035Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27Vetter I.R. Nowak C. Nishimoto T. Kuhlmann J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1999; 398: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 28Richards S.A. Lounsbury K.M. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14405-14411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). If this is the case regarding the interaction between Yrb1p and Gsp1p, then the C-terminal amino acids of Gsp1p may be essential for Yrb1p to inhibit the Mog1p-stimulated nucleotide release. Indeed, when GTP-Gsp1ΔC was used as a substrate instead of GTP-wtGsp1p, the activity of Yrb1p for inhibiting the Mog1p-stimulated nucleotide release was almost completely abolished (Fig. 5, closed circles). For a comparison, we used the dose of Mog1p that released 60% of the nucleotides from [α-32P]GTP-wtGsp1p or [α-32P]GTP-Gsp1ΔC. Even at 10 pmol of Yrb1p, which corresponds to the concentration of GTP-Gsp1ΔC, there was no activity of Yrb1p for inhibiting Mog1p-stimulated nucleotide release, suggesting that Yrb1p inhibits Mog1p-stimulated nucleotide release from Gsp1p by directly binding to Gsp1p. Since RanBP1 makes a complex consisting of RCC1, Ran, and RanBP1 (26Bischoff F.R. Krebber H. Smirnova E. Dong W. Ponstingl H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), another possibility is that Yrb1p may inhibit the Mog1p-stimulated nucleotide release by making the Yrb1p·Gsp1p·Mog1p complex. In order to address this question, Mog1p and Yrb1p were mixed with GTP-Gsp1p. As controls, Mog1p was mixed with Yrb1p or GTP-Gsp1p, and Yrb1p was mixed with GTP-Gsp1p as shown in Fig.6. Those mixtures and the solution containing a single component were subjected to gel filtration analysis. Proteins contained in the resulting fraction were detected by immunoblotting analysis. Gsp1p, molecular mass of 25 kDa, eluted with a peak in fraction 57 (molecular mass of 27 kDa), and Mog1p, molecular mass of 24 kDa, eluted with a peak in fraction 55 (molecular mass of 32 kDa) (Fig. 6, A and B). In contrast, Yrb1p, molecular mass of 23 kDa, eluted with a peak in fraction 50 (molecular mass of 48 kDa) (Fig. 6 C), indicating that Yrb1p may behave as a dimer in solution, as reported for RanBP1 (26Bischoff F.R. Krebber H. Smirnova E. Dong W. Ponstingl H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). When mixed, the complex comprising Mog1p, Yrb1p, and Gsp1p was not detected. Instead, the Mog1·Gsp1p complex eluted with a peak in fraction 43 (molecular mass of 84 kDa (Fig. 6, A and B), the stoichiometry of which is either 2:1 or 1:2). The Yrb1p·Gsp1p complex eluted with a peak in fraction 46 (molecular mass of 66 kDa) (Fig.6 C). The stoichiometry of Yrb1p·Gsp1p complexes appears to be 2:1. It is noticeable that most of the Yrb1p bound to Gsp1p, when Yrb1p was mixed with Gsp1p alone or with Gsp1p plus Mog1p (Fig. 6,A and C). This is consistent with the fact that the formation of the Mog1p·Gsp1p complex was strongly reduced by the addition of Yrb1p (Fig. 6 B). These results suggested that the Yrb1p·GTP-Gsp1p complex is more stable than the Mog1p·GTP-Gsp1p complex, and thereby Yrb1p inhibited the interaction between Mog1p and GTP-Gsp1p at doses higher than that corresponding to the concentration of GTP-Gsp1p. The above results indicated that Mog1p was able to bind to GTP-Gsp1ΔC, whereas the same deletion of mammalian Ran is reported to reduce the affinity between GTP-Ran and RanBP1 by approximately 8,000-fold (17Kuhlmann J. Macara I. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12027-12035Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In order to confirm the interaction between Mog1p and GTP-Gsp1ΔC, we performed real time protein-protein interaction analysis using BIAcore (Fig.7). The monoclonal antibody (mAb) to glutathione S-transferase was immobilized on the sensor chip of the BIAcore to trap GST-fused Mog1p and, as a control, GST-fused Yrb1p. The interaction of Mog1p or Yrb1p with GTP-Gsp1ΔC and, as a control, GTP-wtGsp1p, was then determined by injecting increasing doses (μm) of GTP-Gsp1ΔC or GTP-wtGsp1p. The relative response units obtained with the GST alone were subtracted as a background from those of GST-fused Mog1p and Yrb1p. The interaction between Yrb1p and GTP-Gsp1p was abolished by the disruption of the final eight amino acids of the C terminus, as reported for RanBP1 (Fig.7, C and D) (17Kuhlmann J. Macara I. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12027-12035Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27Vetter I.R. Nowak C. Nishimoto T. Kuhlmann J. Wittinghofer A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14405-14411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In contrast, Mog1p bound to both GTP-Gsp1ΔC and GTP-wtGsp1p. Gsp1ΔC rather efficiently bound to Mog1p, compared with wtGsp1p (Fig. 7, A andB). The calculated association constants (k a, m−1s−1) of the interaction of Mog1p and Yrb1p with wtGsp1p or Gsp1ΔC are as follows: Mog1p/GTP-wtGsp1p, 0.97 + 0.47 × 104; Mog1p/GTP-Gsp1ΔC, 1.40 + 0.90 × 104; Yrb1p/GTP-wtGsp1p, 1.33 + 0.70 × 104. Mog1p is a novel protein binding to GTP. It is required for nuclear protein imports but not for mRNA export (11Oki M. Nishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15388-15393Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This study found that Mog1p can release a nucleotide from GTP-Gsp1p, but not from GDP-Gsp1p, in a dose-dependent manner. In this context, Mog1p differs from a guanine nucleotide exchange factor of Gsp1p, RCC1 which releases a nucleotide from both GTP-Gsp1p, and GDP-Gsp1p (29Klebe C. Prinz H. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). During the preparation of this manuscript, Steggerda and Paschal (30Steggerda S. Paschal B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23175-23180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) reported that murine Mog1p has no nucleotide exchange activity on Ran, whereas it releases GTP from GTP-Ran similar to S. cerevisiae Mog1p. Mog1p does not interfere with the activities of Rna1p and Prp20p. Rather, it functions additively for both Rna1p and Prp20p. It is unknown whether or not Mog1p functionally interacts with Rna1p and Prp20p in vivo. The exact localization of Mog1p has not yet been defined, except that Mog1p is localized within the nucleus when overproduced (11Oki M. Nishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15388-15393Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Murine Mog1 is also localized in the nucleus (30Steggerda S. Paschal B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23175-23180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm, Mog1p could help to reduce the concentration of GTP-Gsp1p, maintaining the gradient of GTP-Gsp1p concentration from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Within the nucleus, on the other hand, Mog1p may be harmful for cell survival since it may reduce the nuclear concentration of GTP-Gsp1p. However, high level expression of Mog1p induced by the GALpromoter does not inhibit the growth of S. cerevisiae (data not shown). Yrb1p is localized within the cytoplasm, possessing a nuclear export signal. The mutant of Yrb1p lacking the nuclear export signal accumulates within the nucleus (28Richards S.A. Lounsbury K.M. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14405-14411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), suggesting that Yrb1p may have a role to play in the nucleus. One of the possibilities is that the nuclear Yrb1p inhibits the Mog1p-stimulated nucleotide release from GTP-Gsp1p in order to maintain the high nuclear concentration of GTP-Gsp1p. RanBP1, the mammalian homologue of Yrb1p, is reported to inhibit completely the RCC1-stimulated nucleotide release from GTP-Ran, at doses greater than that corresponding to the concentration of GTP-Ran (31Hayashi N. Yokoyama N. Seki T. Azuma Y. Ohba T. Nishimoto T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 247: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In a similar manner, Yrb1p inhibited Mog1p-stimulated nucleotide release from Gsp1p. However, there does not seem to be any direct interaction between Mog1p and Yrb1p (Fig. 6). The formation of the Mog1p·GTP-Gsp1p complex seems to be inhibited by the addition of Yrb1p, probably due to the fact that GTP-Gsp1p binds to Yrb1p more stably than to Mog1p (Fig. 7). Thus, Yrb1p may inhibit the interaction between Mog1p and GTP-Gsp1p by depleting the GTP-Gsp1p. This is consistent with the finding that the Mog1p-stimulated nucleotide release from the Gsp1ΔC was not inhibited by the addition of Yrb1p. It is possible that Yrb1p inhibits Mog1p-stimulated nucleotide release by making a complex of Mog1p·Gsp1p·Yrb1p, since Mog1p was coprecipitated with overexpressed GST-Yrb1p in vivo (data not shown), and murine Mog1 is reported to make a trimeric complex of Mog1·Ran·RanBP1 (30Steggerda S. Paschal B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23175-23180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Both Yrb1p and Mog1p bind to GTP-Gsp1p. However, upon the C-terminal deletion of Gsp1p, the ability of Yrb1p to bind to GTP-Gsp1ΔC was profoundly reduced. In contrast, the interaction between Mog1p and Gsp1ΔC was somewhat strengthened, compared with that between Mog1p and wtGsp1p. These results indicate that Mog1p binds to GTP-Gsp1p in a manner different from that of Yrb1p. The method by which Mog1p binds to GTP-Gsp1p may reflect the biological function of Mog1p that still remains to be investigated. Mog1p is conserved in S. pombe(DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM accession number AL031179) and probably in humans (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM accession numberN48015), indicating that Mog1p plays some important role in the Ran GTPase cycle. The present results provide us with the first clue toward clarifying the function of Mog1p. We thank Drs. P. Silver, E. Noguchi, and N. Nakashima for the antibodies to Yrb1p and the pGEX plasmids.

Its significance as such is especially relevant in light of the role the MOM plays in cellular glycerolipid synthesis. The three enzymes that mediate this process in the MOM are acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS), glycerophosphate acyltransferase (GAT), and monoacylglycerophosphate acyltransferase. ACS initiates the first step of the pathway via production of activated fatty acids in the form of fatty acyl-CoAs. GAT mediates the committed step of glycerolipid synthesis by converting the fatty acyl-CoAs to lysophosphatidic acid (1Kornberg A. Pricer Jr., W.E. J. Biol.

The participation between the mitochondrial, microsomal, and peroxisomal enzymes and the cytosolic pool is facilitated by the carrier proteins acyl-CoA-binding protein (15Rasmussen J.T. Rosendal J.

This level of interplay suggests that the orientation of these enzymes in their respective membranes would be such as to maximize this interaction.In this present work, we investigated the topography of GAT in the MOM.

Chem. 1991; 266: 23834-23839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of mitochondrial GAT are well established; however, there is only limited characterization of the structural qualities of the enzyme. Previous studies offer indirect evidence of the orientation of the protein in the MOM. In intact mitochondria, GAT has been shown to be resistant to trypsin and chymotrypsin (18Carroll M.A. Morris P. Grosjean C.D. Anzalone T. Haldar D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 214: 12-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 19Grosjean C.D. Haldar D.

FEBS Lett. 1979; 101: 262-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); however, activity of the enzyme can be abolished by proteinase K or subtilisin treatment, indicating that the GAT has a cytosolic domain (25Hesler C.B. Carroll M.A. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7452-7456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, when right-side-out trypsin-loaded MOM vesicles are generated, the activity of the enzyme is also diminished, suggesting that there are portions of GAT exposed at the inner aspect of the MOM as well (25Hesler C.B. Carroll M.A. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7452-7456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results argue that, at the very least, rat mitochondrial GAT must possess one transmembrane domain.There also are some empirical data regarding the topography of mitochondrial GAT. The cDNA of rat mitochondrial GAT (GenBank™ accession nos. U36771 and AF021348) was previously isolated and mapped (26Nikonov A.V. Morimoto T. Haldar D. Pandalai S.G. Recent Research Developments in Lipids Research. 2, Part II. Transworld Research Network, Trivandrum, India1998: 207-222Google Scholar, 27Bhat B.G. Wang P. Kim J.H. Black T.M. Lewin T.M. Fiedorek F.T. Coleman R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Computer analysis of the derived amino acid (aa) sequence revealed the presence of several hydrophobic regions that may interact with the MOM (Fig. 1). However, only two of these regions (aa 473–493 and 574–594) are characteristic of transmembrane domains. Dependent on the orientation of these putative transmembrane domains, the 80 aa between the two transmembrane domains (aa 494–573) may be exposed at the cytosolic surface of the MOM (while the N- and C-terminal regions are sequestered at the inner leaflet of the MOM) or face the inter-membrane space (N- and C-terminal regions exposed to the cytosol). The earlier of the two models was preferred as more likely since the controlled protease digestion data (25Hesler C.B. Carroll M.A. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7452-7456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggest only a limited presence of GAT at the cytosolic surface of the MOM.In the present investigation, we have employed immunological methods as well as green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins to elucidate the topography of GAT in the MOM. The results suggest aa 473–493 and 574–594 do serve as transmembrane domains, while the 80 aa between them (aa 494–573) are exposed on the cytosolic face of the MOM. Additionally, protease digestion of the GFP fusion protein constructs reveal that both the N- and C-terminal regions of rat mitochondrial GAT are sequestered on the inner side of the MOM.DISCUSSIONIn the present investigation, immunological experiments have established that aa 473–493 and 574–594 serve as transmembrane domains in rat mitochondrial GAT and the region between the two (aa 494–573) is exposed on the cytosolic surface of the MOM (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). Additionally, protease digestion of GFP fusion proteins demonstrates that the N and C termini of GAT are sequestered on the inner surface of the MOM (Fig. 6).These findings corroborate the proposed “(aa 1–472)in-out(aa 494–573)-in(aa 595-)” topographical model of GAT (Fig.1 B), whose design was based on hydrophobicity analysis of the derived amino acid sequence of rat mitochondrial GAT (Fig.1 A) as well as previous biochemical experiments (25Hesler C.B. Carroll M.A. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7452-7456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this model contains only two transmembrane domains (Fig.1 A, boxes 3 and 5), although the hydrophobicity plot indicates that there are four other hydrophobic regions in GAT that may be potential transmembrane domains (Fig. 1 A, boxes 1, 2,4, and 6). These regions were excluded as transmembrane domains for various reasons. The hydrophobic regions, aa 176–196 and 235–255 (Fig. 1 A, boxes 1 and 2, respectively), were not considered as possible transmembrane regions based on their hydrophobicity scores obtained from TopPred2 analysis. In comparison to the established transmembrane regions, aa 473–493 and 574–594, which received scores of 1.080 and 1.293, respectively, aa 176–196 and 235–255 only received scores of 0.728 and 0.683, respectively. To be consistent with the findings presented in this paper, both or neither of these segments would have to be transmembrane domains. If only one was a transmembrane domain, the antigenic site for IM1GAT (aa 420–435) and the N-terminal region would be on opposite sides of the membrane. In view of the relatively low hydrophobicity scores for both these segments, we conclude that neither of them is a transmembrane domain. More likely, these hydrophobic regions are probably closely associated with the inner leaflet of the MOM.The hydrophobic region, aa 551–571 (Fig. 1 A, box 4), was rejected as a possible transmembrane domain based on the results of the immunological data. In intact mitochondria, CYTGAT was able to bind to its antigenic site (aa 543–559), which overlaps this hydrophobic region. If this region were a transmembrane domain, more than half of the CYTGAT binding site would be masked by the MOM leading to the inability of the antibody to bind, which is not the case (Figs. 2 and 4). Additionally, if aa 551–571 were a transmembrane domain, the antigenic site recognized by IM2GAT would not be on the inner side of the MOM as demonstrated (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5), but instead would be present on the cytosolic surface of the MOM. The last hydrophobic region, aa 721–741 (Fig. 1 A, box 6), was discounted as a possible transmembrane domain from the results of the protease digestion of the GFP fusion protein consisting of GFP fused to the C terminus of GAT. The GFP domain of this protein was resistant to protease digestion in intact mitochondria (Fig. 6,upper panel, lane 3) and becomes susceptible after solubilization of the mitochondria (Fig. 6,upper panel, lane 4), which implies that the C terminus of GAT is sequestered inside the mitochondria. If aa 721–741 did serve as a transmembrane region, then the GFP domain would be present on the outer surface of the mitochondria and would be susceptible to trypsin digestion.TopPred2 hydrophobicity analysis of GAT from other species was also performed, and the predicted transmembrane domains were compared with those of rat mitochondrial GAT to determine if any topographical information of these other enzymes may be inferred (data not shown). Murine mitochondrial GAT is greater than 97% identical to rat GAT and possesses the identical transmembrane domains. GAT from the nematode worm, Caenorhabditis elegans, only exhibits one possible transmembrane region (aa 407–427), which contains 44.4% identical residues with the first transmembrane region of rat GAT (aa 473–493).Escherichia coli GAT is also predicted to have only one transmembrane domain (aa 610–630), which exhibits nearly 20% identical residues, and over 75% similar residues with the second transmembrane domain of rat GAT (aa 574–594). Mycobacterium tuberculosis GAT is predicted to have two transmembrane domains (aa 294–314 and 480–500), although neither is significantly similar to those in rat GAT. Nevertheless, the presence of putative transmembrane regions in GAT of several different species indicates that membrane insertion may be a conserved characteristic among them and might even be necessary for proper function of the enzymes. In the case of rat mitochondrial GAT, for example, the transmembrane domains impart a specific topography to the enzyme, which may be crucial in the orientation of its catalytic site.Previous studies using immobilized substrates have shown that the catalytic site of rat mitochondrial GAT is present on the cytosolic surface of the MOM (31Chakraborty T.R. Vancura A. Balija V.S. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29786-29790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The identification of aa 494–573 as a cytosolic domain of GAT may implicate this region as the location of the catalytic site. Indirectly, there may be some evidence to support this hypothesis. In intact and solubilized mitochondria, immunoreaction with the CYTGAT antibody results in a drastic inhibition (50% and 75%, respectively) of GAT activity in comparison to the effects of IM1GAT and IM2GAT antibodies (Figs. 2 and 3). This may indicate that the cytosolic region of GAT where CYTGAT binds (aa 543–559) may be structurally significant or in close proximity to the catalytic site. However, the possibility that CYTGAT binding, in comparison to IM1GAT and IM2GAT binding, simply produces a greater conformational change in GAT resulting in the large inhibition of activity cannot be completely dismissed. Clearly, further studies are needed to directly establish that this cytosolic domain of GAT is truly the location of the catalytic site.The cytosolic domain of GAT may also be essential in modulation of enzyme activity. Recently, AMP-activated protein kinase was shown to phosphorylate and inhibit mitochondrial GAT in vivo (32Mudio P.M. Seefeld K. Witters L.A. Coleman R.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 783-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, protein kinase C and tyrosine kinase have been shownin vitro to potently stimulate GAT activity in intact rat liver mitochondria. 3T. R. Chakraborty, V. S. Balija, A. V. Nikonov, and D. Haldar, manuscript in preparation. The size of AMP-activated protein kinase, protein kinase C, and tyrosine kinase prevents their passage across the MOM, which implies that these phosphorylation sites are on the cytosolic domain of GAT as well. The mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM)1 is the demarcatory barrier between the mitochondrial interior and cytosol. Its significance as such is especially relevant in light of the role the MOM plays in cellular glycerolipid synthesis. The three enzymes that mediate this process in the MOM are acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS), glycerophosphate acyltransferase (GAT), and monoacylglycerophosphate acyltransferase. ACS initiates the first step of the pathway via production of activated fatty acids in the form of fatty acyl-CoAs. GAT mediates the committed step of glycerolipid synthesis by converting the fatty acyl-CoAs to lysophosphatidic acid (1Kornberg A. Pricer Jr., W.E. J. Biol.

The lysophosphatidic acid produced can be further acylated by monoacylglycerophosphate acyltransferase to produce phosphatidic acid (1Kornberg A. Pricer Jr., W.E. J. Biol.

The participation between the mitochondrial, microsomal, and peroxisomal enzymes and the cytosolic pool is facilitated by the carrier proteins acyl-CoA-binding protein (15Rasmussen J.T. Rosendal J.

This level of interplay suggests that the orientation of these enzymes in their respective membranes would be such as to maximize this interaction. In this present work, we investigated the topography of GAT in the MOM. The biochemical characterization (6Haldar D. Tso W.W. Pullman M.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 23834-23839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of mitochondrial GAT are well established; however, there is only limited characterization of the structural qualities of the enzyme. Previous studies offer indirect evidence of the orientation of the protein in the MOM. In intact mitochondria, GAT has been shown to be resistant to trypsin and chymotrypsin (18Carroll M.A. Morris P. Grosjean C.D. Anzalone T. Haldar D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 214: 12-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 19Grosjean C.D. Haldar D.

FEBS Lett. 1979; 101: 262-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); however, activity of the enzyme can be abolished by proteinase K or subtilisin treatment, indicating that the GAT has a cytosolic domain (25Hesler C.B. Carroll M.A. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7452-7456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, when right-side-out trypsin-loaded MOM vesicles are generated, the activity of the enzyme is also diminished, suggesting that there are portions of GAT exposed at the inner aspect of the MOM as well (25Hesler C.B. Carroll M.A. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7452-7456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results argue that, at the very least, rat mitochondrial GAT must possess one transmembrane domain. There also are some empirical data regarding the topography of mitochondrial GAT. The cDNA of rat mitochondrial GAT (GenBank™ accession nos. U36771 and AF021348) was previously isolated and mapped (26Nikonov A.V. Morimoto T. Haldar D. Pandalai S.G. Recent Research Developments in Lipids Research. 2, Part II. Transworld Research Network, Trivandrum, India1998: 207-222Google Scholar, 27Bhat B.G. Wang P. Kim J.H. Black T.M. Lewin T.M. Fiedorek F.T. Coleman R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Computer analysis of the derived amino acid (aa) sequence revealed the presence of several hydrophobic regions that may interact with the MOM (Fig. 1). However, only two of these regions (aa 473–493 and 574–594) are characteristic of transmembrane domains. Dependent on the orientation of these putative transmembrane domains, the 80 aa between the two transmembrane domains (aa 494–573) may be exposed at the cytosolic surface of the MOM (while the N- and C-terminal regions are sequestered at the inner leaflet of the MOM) or face the inter-membrane space (N- and C-terminal regions exposed to the cytosol). The earlier of the two models was preferred as more likely since the controlled protease digestion data (25Hesler C.B. Carroll M.A. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7452-7456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggest only a limited presence of GAT at the cytosolic surface of the MOM. In the present investigation, we have employed immunological methods as well as green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins to elucidate the topography of GAT in the MOM. The results suggest aa 473–493 and 574–594 do serve as transmembrane domains, while the 80 aa between them (aa 494–573) are exposed on the cytosolic face of the MOM. Additionally, protease digestion of the GFP fusion protein constructs reveal that both the N- and C-terminal regions of rat mitochondrial GAT are sequestered on the inner side of the MOM. DISCUSSIONIn the present investigation, immunological experiments have established that aa 473–493 and 574–594 serve as transmembrane domains in rat mitochondrial GAT and the region between the two (aa 494–573) is exposed on the cytosolic surface of the MOM (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). Additionally, protease digestion of GFP fusion proteins demonstrates that the N and C termini of GAT are sequestered on the inner surface of the MOM (Fig. 6).These findings corroborate the proposed “(aa 1–472)in-out(aa 494–573)-in(aa 595-)” topographical model of GAT (Fig.1 B), whose design was based on hydrophobicity analysis of the derived amino acid sequence of rat mitochondrial GAT (Fig.1 A) as well as previous biochemical experiments (25Hesler C.B. Carroll M.A. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7452-7456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this model contains only two transmembrane domains (Fig.1 A, boxes 3 and 5), although the hydrophobicity plot indicates that there are four other hydrophobic regions in GAT that may be potential transmembrane domains (Fig. 1 A, boxes 1, 2,4, and 6). These regions were excluded as transmembrane domains for various reasons. The hydrophobic regions, aa 176–196 and 235–255 (Fig. 1 A, boxes 1 and 2, respectively), were not considered as possible transmembrane regions based on their hydrophobicity scores obtained from TopPred2 analysis. In comparison to the established transmembrane regions, aa 473–493 and 574–594, which received scores of 1.080 and 1.293, respectively, aa 176–196 and 235–255 only received scores of 0.728 and 0.683, respectively. To be consistent with the findings presented in this paper, both or neither of these segments would have to be transmembrane domains. If only one was a transmembrane domain, the antigenic site for IM1GAT (aa 420–435) and the N-terminal region would be on opposite sides of the membrane. In view of the relatively low hydrophobicity scores for both these segments, we conclude that neither of them is a transmembrane domain. More likely, these hydrophobic regions are probably closely associated with the inner leaflet of the MOM.The hydrophobic region, aa 551–571 (Fig. 1 A, box 4), was rejected as a possible transmembrane domain based on the results of the immunological data. In intact mitochondria, CYTGAT was able to bind to its antigenic site (aa 543–559), which overlaps this hydrophobic region. If this region were a transmembrane domain, more than half of the CYTGAT binding site would be masked by the MOM leading to the inability of the antibody to bind, which is not the case (Figs. 2 and 4). Additionally, if aa 551–571 were a transmembrane domain, the antigenic site recognized by IM2GAT would not be on the inner side of the MOM as demonstrated (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5), but instead would be present on the cytosolic surface of the MOM. The last hydrophobic region, aa 721–741 (Fig. 1 A, box 6), was discounted as a possible transmembrane domain from the results of the protease digestion of the GFP fusion protein consisting of GFP fused to the C terminus of GAT. The GFP domain of this protein was resistant to protease digestion in intact mitochondria (Fig. 6,upper panel, lane 3) and becomes susceptible after solubilization of the mitochondria (Fig. 6,upper panel, lane 4), which implies that the C terminus of GAT is sequestered inside the mitochondria. If aa 721–741 did serve as a transmembrane region, then the GFP domain would be present on the outer surface of the mitochondria and would be susceptible to trypsin digestion.TopPred2 hydrophobicity analysis of GAT from other species was also performed, and the predicted transmembrane domains were compared with those of rat mitochondrial GAT to determine if any topographical information of these other enzymes may be inferred (data not shown). Murine mitochondrial GAT is greater than 97% identical to rat GAT and possesses the identical transmembrane domains. GAT from the nematode worm, Caenorhabditis elegans, only exhibits one possible transmembrane region (aa 407–427), which contains 44.4% identical residues with the first transmembrane region of rat GAT (aa 473–493).Escherichia coli GAT is also predicted to have only one transmembrane domain (aa 610–630), which exhibits nearly 20% identical residues, and over 75% similar residues with the second transmembrane domain of rat GAT (aa 574–594). Mycobacterium tuberculosis GAT is predicted to have two transmembrane domains (aa 294–314 and 480–500), although neither is significantly similar to those in rat GAT. Nevertheless, the presence of putative transmembrane regions in GAT of several different species indicates that membrane insertion may be a conserved characteristic among them and might even be necessary for proper function of the enzymes. In the case of rat mitochondrial GAT, for example, the transmembrane domains impart a specific topography to the enzyme, which may be crucial in the orientation of its catalytic site.Previous studies using immobilized substrates have shown that the catalytic site of rat mitochondrial GAT is present on the cytosolic surface of the MOM (31Chakraborty T.R. Vancura A. Balija V.S. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29786-29790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The identification of aa 494–573 as a cytosolic domain of GAT may implicate this region as the location of the catalytic site. Indirectly, there may be some evidence to support this hypothesis. In intact and solubilized mitochondria, immunoreaction with the CYTGAT antibody results in a drastic inhibition (50% and 75%, respectively) of GAT activity in comparison to the effects of IM1GAT and IM2GAT antibodies (Figs. 2 and 3). This may indicate that the cytosolic region of GAT where CYTGAT binds (aa 543–559) may be structurally significant or in close proximity to the catalytic site. However, the possibility that CYTGAT binding, in comparison to IM1GAT and IM2GAT binding, simply produces a greater conformational change in GAT resulting in the large inhibition of activity cannot be completely dismissed. Clearly, further studies are needed to directly establish that this cytosolic domain of GAT is truly the location of the catalytic site.The cytosolic domain of GAT may also be essential in modulation of enzyme activity. Recently, AMP-activated protein kinase was shown to phosphorylate and inhibit mitochondrial GAT in vivo (32Mudio P.M. Seefeld K. Witters L.A. Coleman R.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 783-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, protein kinase C and tyrosine kinase have been shownin vitro to potently stimulate GAT activity in intact rat liver mitochondria. 3T. R. Chakraborty, V. S. Balija, A. V. Nikonov, and D. Haldar, manuscript in preparation. The size of AMP-activated protein kinase, protein kinase C, and tyrosine kinase prevents their passage across the MOM, which implies that these phosphorylation sites are on the cytosolic domain of GAT as well. In the present investigation, immunological experiments have established that aa 473–493 and 574–594 serve as transmembrane domains in rat mitochondrial GAT and the region between the two (aa 494–573) is exposed on the cytosolic surface of the MOM (Figs.
