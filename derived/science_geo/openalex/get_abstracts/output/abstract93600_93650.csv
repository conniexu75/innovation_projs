https://openalex.org/W1965371391,"Cultured human lymphocytes and rat hepatoma cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and the insulin receptor subunits identified by immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. In both cell types the 95,000-dalton (β) subunit of the insulin receptor was selectively phosphorylated. Phosphorylation was specifically stimulated by insulin in a dose-dependent fashion after 1 and 15 minutes of hormone treatment, whereas human growth hormone was without effect. This phosphorylation may be a very early event in insulin action."
https://openalex.org/W2024152221,"Osteonectin is a 32,000 dalton bone-specific protein that binds selectively to both hydroxyapatite and collagen. When osteonectin is bound to insolubilized type I collagen, the resultant complex binds synthetic apatite crystals and free calcium ions. The osteonectin-collagen complexes also nucleate mineral phase deposition from metastable balanced salt solutions, Antibodies to osteonectin cross-react with bone and, to a lesser extent, dentin, but not with other tissues. The protein is localized to mineralized bone trabeculae and occurs at higher levels in the matrix than in the cells of bone. These studies suggest that osteonectin is a tissue-specific protein, linking the bone mineral and collagen phases, perhaps initiating active mineralization in normal skeletal tissue."

The membrane comprises a top layer of a silicone elastomer and a bottom layer of a porous cross-linked network of collagen and glycosaminoglycan. The bottom layer can be seeded with a small number of autologous basal cells before grafting. No immunosuppression is used and infection, exudation, and rejection are absent. Host tissue utilizes the sterile membrane as a culture medium to synthesize neoepidermal and neodermal tissue. A functional extension of skin over the entire wound area is formed in about 4 weeks."

https://openalex.org/W2005115290,"The complete sequences of the yeast a mating-type locus, MATa, and of the silent α cassette, HMLα, have been determined. A segment of 642 nucleotides is unique to MATa, and a corresponding segment of 747 nucleotides is unique to MATα. The major mRNAs (a1, a2, α1 and α2) encoded by MATa and MATα have been aligned with the DNA sequence. The a1 mRNA is encoded entirely within the a-specific DNA sequence. The a2 mRNA, which is transcribed divergently from a1 mRNA, is encoded in a region common to both Mata and Matα. The α1 and α2 mRNAs are also transcribed divergently and have their 5′ starts about 240 nucleotides apart within the α-specific sequence. The amino acid sequences of the MAT proteins have been predicted from the DNA sequences. An unanticipated conclusion is that the a1 protein, containing 148 amino acids, results from readthrough of a UGA at codon 45. Polymorphic forms of the homologous outer segments of the HMLα, MATα, MATa and HMRa sequences suggest that the boundaries of the segments involved in mating-type switching are immediately adjacent to the a-specific and α-specific sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1482516139,Theoretical conformational energy calculations show that large changes in the width of the binding-site cleft in the L-arabinose-binding protein involve only modest changes in the protein internal energy. Solvation energy changes associated with such variations of the cleft width and with protein-ligand interactions are estimated to be significantly larger than the internal energy changes. These results indicate that the binding-site cleft is open in the unliganded protein and is induced to close upon ligation. This picture is consistent with experimental data on the structure and binding kinetics of the L-arabinose-binding protein and provides a physical framework for interpreting such data.
https://openalex.org/W2011414304,"Sympathetic nervous system activity was assessed in experimental and control subjects who were exposed to graded orthostatic and isometric stress during monthly hospital visits. After the first session, the experimental subjects practiced a technique that elicited the relaxation response. Their concentrations of plasma norepinephrine during subsequent graded stresses were significantly higher. No such changes were noted in the control group. These results were than replicated in the control group in a crossover experiment. The groups did not differ in their heart rate and blood pressure responses. These observations are consistent with reduced norepinephrine end-organ responsivity after regular elicitation of the relaxation response."
https://openalex.org/W2053469492,"We have developed a quantitative method to study the interaction of radiolabeled clathrin triskelions with membranes from brain coated vesicles. Clathrin triskelions do not bind to coated vesicles unless these are stripped of their clathrin coat. The binding of triskelions is of high affinity (KD ≅ 2 × 10−9 M), is saturable and depends on vesicle concentration. Triskelions bind to protein-sensitive structures of the stripped vesicles. Polypeptides of about 110,000 daltons appear to be involved in the binding structure. The association of triskelions to stripped vesicles was confirmed by electron microscopy."

https://openalex.org/W1862849703,"We have measured turnover times for alveolar surfactant phosphatidylcholine in rabbits at 3 and 10 days of age and in adult rabbits. To generate accurate estimates of the turnover time of surfactant phosphatidylcholine from lamellar bodies into the alveolar space, large numbers of rabbits at each age were injected with radiolabeled choline, palmitic acid, and phosphate. Phosphatidylcholine was isolated from lamellar body and surfactant fractions from each rabbit. Curves of specific activity versus time were analyzed using the Zilversmit equations for a two compartment precursor-product model. The curves for each labeled precursor at each age were consistent with the lamellar bodies being the sole precursors of surfactant phosphatidylcholine. The same equations were used to calculate turnover times for surfactant phosphatidylcholine; these were 8-10 h in 3- and 10-day-old rabbits but only 3 h in adult rabbits. From estimates of surfactant phosphatidylcholine pool sizes and turnover times, the flux of surfactant phosphatidylcholine was estimated to be 3.4 mumol/h in adult and 0.48 mumol/h in 3-day-old rabbits; however, the flux expressed/kg of body weight is 2.4 times larger in 3-day-old than in adult rabbits. Finally, the conservation of the radiolabeled precursors in phosphatidylcholine implies reutilization of phosphatidylcholine after synthesis and secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2042124331,"The coding section of the apocytochrome b gene (cobA) of the mitochondrial DNA of Aspergillus nidulans has been completely sequenced. The gene comprises two exons of 507 and 654 bp separated by one intron of approximately 1.1 kb. The derived amino acid sequence shows 61% homology with that of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and 51% homology with the cognate human sequence. Comparison of these sequences indicates that UGA codes for tryptophan in the A. nidulans mitochondrial system. The intron is in exactly the same place as intron 13 of the apocytochrome b gene of ""long"" strains of S. cerevisiae. Other introns present in ""long"" strains (I1 and I2) are absent in A. nidulans. Introns 14 and 15 present both ""long"" and ""short"" strains of yeast are also absent. This is particularly significant in view of the involvement of 14 in the splicing of both cob and oxi3 (coding for cytochrome oxidase subunit 1) mRNA precursors in S. cerevisiae. The partial sequence of the A. nidulans intron shows an open reading frame for at least the first 200 bp, and shows the intron to be closed in all frames at the carboxyl terminus."
https://openalex.org/W1620178743,"In Escherichia coli, quinolinic acid, a precursor of NAD+, is synthesized from L-aspartate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. This synthesis requires two enzymes, a FAD-containing and an protein. The B protein has been purified 500-fold from E. coli cells. The enzyme behaves as an L-aspartate oxidase. In the absence of A protein, it converts L-aspartate to oxaloacetate. To our knowledge, no enzyme with this activity has been described previously. The enzyme displays some unusual properties. In its role as B protein in quinolinic acid synthetase, product formation (quinolinic acid) is linear with protein concentration; however, when it functions as an L-aspartate oxidase, product formation (oxaloacetate) is a parabolic function of protein concentration. The L-aspartate oxidase activity also shows marked substrate activation at substrate concentrations above 1.0 mM. The L-aspartate oxidase and B protein activities of the enzyme are inhibited by NAD+, which is competitive with FAD. The immediate reaction product of the enzyme has the same characteristics (rate of decay to oxaloacetate, and condensation with dihydroxyacetone phosphate to form quinolinate) as the unstable reaction product (iminoaspartate) formed from D-aspartate oxidase. A reaction mechanism for the A protein-catalyzed condensation of dihydroxyacetone phosphate and iminoaspartate to form quinolinate is presented."
https://openalex.org/W2076500719,"We have investigated the organization and regulation of a 13.3 kb region of the Aspergillus nidulans genome that is preferentially expressed during conidiophore development. This cloned DNA segment codes for six polysomal poly(A)+ RNAs present in dormant asexual spores (conidia) at from 8 to 50 copies per cell. The genes encoding these RNAs occur once per haploid genome, are separate and distinct, appear to be colinear with their mature RNA products and are present in both polarities. Two of the genes have short regions of homology near their 5′ ends, but otherwise the segment is internally unique. All of the RNAs are absent from or present at very low levels in wild-type somatic cells (hyphae) and developing cultures of asporogenous mutant strains. In synchronously conidiating wild-type cultures, each of the RNAs can first be detected at a time coinciding with the appearance of mature spores. Thus this region comprises a cluster of tightly linked, discrete genes, which are all expressed at the same time, but not to the same extent, in a single differentiating cell type."

https://openalex.org/W1555638067,"A mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that was selected for resistance to carbon catabolite repression also had reduced hexokinase activity. Hexokinase isoenzymes were purified from mutant and wild type cells. The specific glucokinase and hexokinase isozyme PI were present at normal levels in mutant and wild type, but no hexokinase isozyme PII activity was detected in the mutant. Staining for enzyme activity after electrophoresis of crude extracts also indicated that hexokinase PII was absent in the mutant. Mutant and wild type segregants gained by tetrad analysis were investigated electrophoretically. Staining for enzyme activity confirmed that catalytically inactive hexokinase PII and the defect in carbon catabolite repression always co-segregated. The results support the hypothesis that hexokinase PII might mediate carbon catabolite repression."

https://openalex.org/W1540170673,"During the conversion of yeast cells to protoplasts, about half of the yeast chitinase was liberated into the medium, an indication that this portion of the enzyme is located in the periplasmic space. At least part of the remaining chitinase appears to be enclosed in vacuoles or in vesicle that co-purify with them, as indicated by a 14-fold enrichment of the enzymatic activity in a vacuole fraction isolated from a protoplast lysate. When protoplasts were incubated in growth medium, part of the chitinase was liberated in growth medium, part of the chitinase was liberated into the medium. It is concluded that yeast chitinase is a secretory enzyme, like invertase and acid phosphatase. The enzyme appears to be stored in vesicles as a prelude to its secretion into the periplasmic space. The possible function of yeast chitinase in cell division is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2092537024,"The tyrT locus of E. coli contains a 208 bp spacer region that separates two copies of sequence encoding tRNATyr1. The spacer includes a 120 bp sequence that is homologous to a sequence that is repeated three times in the distal portion of the tyrT locus. The tyrT locus possesses a graded set of transcription termination sites that are spaced at 180 base intervals, corresponding to the distal repeated gene structure. The major termination site occurs within the second repeat unit, 225 bases beyond the mature tRNA sequences. In the presence of a temperature-sensitive rho protein there is increased read-through at this site to a termination site located 180 bases downstream in the third repeat and to several termination sites even further downstream. The primary native transcript, in the region distal to the second tRNA, carries the information for a low molecular weight, extremely basic protein. Although analogous coding sequences are present in the spacer and other repeat units, because of single base substitutions these sequences are pseudogenes. The parallel between the tyrT and TyrU gene clusters is discussed in relation to dual function transcripts that specify both tRNA and protein."

The modification examined is not a function of polypeptide synthesis, but rather occurs on the histones subsequent to deposition. The log phase yeast histones are neither rapidly acetylated nor rapidly deacetylated. Acetylation and deacetylation rates for histones H3 and H4 are on the order of hours, indicating that, during log phase, these histones are maintained in the hyperacetylated form. The acetate turnover rate for H2B is somewhat increased over that observed for H3 and H4."

https://openalex.org/W2110090252,"Although chemoreceptor methylation in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli has been shown to be at the core of the chemotactic phenomenon, mutants in the gene (cheR) that codes for the methylating enzyme still respond and adapt to repellent stimuli. Analyses of receptor methylation and transferase activity show that this behavior is not due to residual transferase activity. That receptor methylation is not absolutely required for chemotactic sensory processing is confirmed by the isolation of cheR pseudorevertants that remain defective in receptor methylation, yet are able to respond to gradients on semi-solid tryptone agar. A detailed comparison of cheR and wild-type responses indicates that chemotaxis is mediated by at least two interdependent adaptation systems, only one of which involves receptor methylation. The interaction of these two systems produces the full response in wild-type cells. Methylation-deficient mutants exhibit a partial response and retain some chemotactic ability."
https://openalex.org/W1505136621,"Ribonucleotide reductase from mammalian cells consists of two nonidentical components which are both required for enzymatic activity. It was found that the addition of the effector-binding component (dye fraction) to cell-free extracts of Ehrlich tumor cells stimulated CDP reductase activity. The decrease in CDP reductase activity which accompanied the decrease in Ehrlich tumor cell proliferation in vivo could be correlated with the decrease in the dye fraction component. In regenerating liver, the reductase activity was increased maximally at 36 h following partial hepatectomy. This activity could be further stimulated by exogenous tumor cell dye fraction. The non-heme iron component (Tris fraction) was isolated and quantitated from the liver extracts of regenerating livers. The maximal increase on the Tris fraction component was observed in the 24-h regenerating liver. These data provide evidence that the components making up the active ribonucleotide reductase species are not coordinately increased at the time of the increase in reductase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1657505779,"The gene 5 protein.fd DNA complex, which is an intermediate in the life cycle of fd bacteriophage, was isolated from fd-infected cells. After ultraviolet irradiation, approximately 10% of the gene 5 protein was covalently linked to fd DNA via the sulfhydryl group of the single cysteine residue at position 33 in the gene 5 protein. When intact, infected cells were first irradiated with ultraviolet light and the gene 5 protein.DNA complex subsequently isolated, less than 1% of the bound protein in the complex was found to be cross-linked. While these results agree with our previous findings based on irradiation of the gene 5 protein.fd DNA complex formed from purified gene 5 protein and fd DNA, they differ from the results of Lica and Ray ((1977) J. Mol. Biol. 115, 45-59) who found high yields of cross-linked gene 5 protein.fd DNA complex after ultraviolet irradiation of intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W1488861957,"We have developed two Escherichia coli strains for the production of specifically labeled amino acids suitable for high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. The 13C atoms from the enriched carbon sources, [1-13C]lactate, [1,4-13C2]succinate, and [1-13C]-acetate, are incorporated into the amino acids producing multilabeled molecules with relatively few instances of adjacent enriched carbons. This greatly simplifies the resultant spectra as compared to the extensively spin-coupled spectra of uniformly enriched samples. No isotopic enrichment was found at carbon positions expected to be unenriched by consideration of the major biosynthetic pathways. Utilizing 90% enriched precursors, most positions were enriched to approximately 85% except for those positions derived from acetate and those affected by the carbon interchange of the pentose phosphate shunt. In both of these cases, the enrichment level fell to 70%. The only result enrichment at the delta-methyl carbon of isoleucine. For the bacterial strain in question, the main pathway of isoleucine biosynthesis appears not to be from threonine but from an alternate precursor, possibly glutamate."

https://openalex.org/W1973161108,"Several open reading frames exist in the region of the tRNATyr/1 gene of the E. coli genome. One such sequence encodes a polypeptide 33 amino acids in length that, on the basis of size and amino acid sequence, bears a striking resemblance to the protamines found in trout sperm. DNA from the transducing phage phi 80 tRNATyr/1 su3+ directs in vitro synthesis of two small basic proteins that are not made when homologous DNA containing a deletion that overlaps both the su3+ gene and the gene for the putative protamine-like protein is used. DNA from phage that have regained the parental su3+ phenotype again direct in vitro synthesis of the basic proteins. Synthesis of basic protein is inhibited by the presence of ppGpp, as would be expected if the mRNA is part of a large RNA transcript that starts at the promoter for the tRNATyr/1 gene."

https://openalex.org/W1504079901,"The condensation reaction of phosphoenolpyruvate and shikimate 3-phosphate catalyzed by 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase is thought to proceed by an addition-elimination mechanism in which C-3 of phosphoenolpyruvate transiently becomes a methyl group in the enzyme-bound intermediate. Results obtained from reactions conducted in H2O, 2H2O, and 3H2O, using unlabeled, [3-2H2]-, or [3-3H,2H]phosphoenolpyruvate, are consistent with the addition-elimination pathway and show that the transient methyl group rotates rapidly. There is substantial discrimination against heavy hydrogen isotopes in both the protonation and deprotonation steps. These results demonstrate the feasibility of determining the stereochemical course of the synthase reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1506864927,"An assay procedure, utilizing high pressure liquid chromatography, has been designed which allows both reactions catalyzed by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase to be monitored simultaneously. Using this procedure and the theories described by Huang (Huang, C. V. (1979) Methods. Enzymol. 63, 486-500) for alternate substrate kinetic analysis, we have determined that purified hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase from yeast catalyzes the formations of both IMP and GMP through the use of an Ordered Bi Bi kinetic mechanism, and that guanine is highly preferred over hypoxanthine as substrate in the forward reaction. This proposed kinetic mechanism has been confirmed using flow dialysis experiments in which a binary enzyme-5-phosphoribosyl-alpha-1-pyrophosphate complex was characterized but where enzymic complexes, with either guanine or hypoxanthine, were not detected. Also consistent with this kinetic mechanism was our observation that an exchange of label between [14C]guanine or [14C]hypoxanthine and their respective nucleotides (GMP and IMP) was not catalyzed by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. However, a significant exchange of label between [32P]pyrophosphate and 5-phosphoribosyl-alpha-1-pyrophosphate is observed upon incubation with this enzyme, suggesting that hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase may exist, in part, as a phosphoribosyl-enzyme complex in the presence of 5-phosphoribosyl-alpha-1-pyrophosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1554600107,We have estimated the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of ATP-citrate lyase by two methods. Isolated hepatocytes incorporate extracellular 32P into [gamma-35P] ATP and immunoprecipitated ATP-citrate lyase to steady state levels by 1 h. The content of acid-stable 32P in hepatocyte ATP-citrate lyase at steady state is 0.33 +/- 0.038 mol of P/mol (tetrameric) holoenzyme. Insulin (1 milliunit/ml) increases the 32P content of immunoprecipitated lyase 2- to 3-fold in 10 min. Over 90% of acid-stable 32P on lyase is 32P-serine in enzyme isolated from both control and insulin-treated cells. ATP-citrate lyase isolated from hepatocytes contains 0.95 +/- 0.1 mol of alkali-labile phosphate/mol of holoenzyme. Insulin treatment of hepatocytes (1 milliunit/ml for 10 min) increases the alkali-labile P content by 45%. Evidence is presented which indicates that the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation does not arise by intramolecular migration from the catalytic phosphoenzyme intermediate. These observations support the conclusion that insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of ATP-citrate lyase is mediated either by an insulin-induced increase in the activity of lyase kinase and/or decrease in a lyase phosphatase. The functional role of the substoichiometric phosphorylation of ATP-citrate lyase remains unknown.
https://openalex.org/W1679078180,"Four nuclear thermosensitive mutants have been obtained in which induction of up 100% cytoplasmic petite mutants (rho-) is observed upon cell incubation at 36 degrees C. For a given incubation time at 36 degrees C, the percentage of rho- is increased by preliminary gamma-ray irradiation. Under these conditions, the induction of rho- is a linear function of the irradiation dose. The retention of genetic information by rho- and of mitochondrial DNA synthesis in vivo and in vitro exclude that the mutants are deficient in the replication of mitochondrial DNA. The degradation of mitochondrial DNA labeled with [3H]dTTP in isolated mitochondria, has been monitored at 26 degrees C and at 36 degrees C after addition of 0.5% Triton X-100 in the presence or in the absence of ethidium bromide. In assays carried out at 26 degrees C, the degradation of mitochondrial DNA is similar in the parental strain and in the mutant gamma s rho 2. However, at 36 degrees C, the degradation of mitochondrial DNA is slower in the mutant. We have shown that a mitochondrial membrane deoxyribonuclease acting on double-stranded DNA at acid pH is thermosensitive in the mutant. Analysis of the meiotic segregants of a tetrad issued from the cross of the mutant with an isogenic parental strain shows co-segregation of rho- induction and of nuclease thermosensitivity in a 2:2 Mendelian pattern. These results suggest that a mitochondrial deoxyribonuclease is involved in the repair of damages caused to mitochondrial DNA by elevated temperature and by x-rays."

Protein sequencing through eight cycles of the Klenow large fragment yields a unique sequence corresponding to residues 324 to 331 from the translated DNA sequence and defines the subtilisin cleavage site for formation of the large and small fragments as Thr323-Val324. Site-specific cleavage of whole enzyme and large fragment at cysteines and sizing of the resulting fragments verify the location of the two cysteines at residues 262 and 907 as assigned by the DNA sequencing. Isolation of tryptic peptides derived from DNA polymerase I yielded unique peptides whose composition exactly corresponded to theoretical tryptic peptides derived from the translated DNA sequence. Identification of the expected carboxyl-terminal tryptic peptide and carboxypeptidase digestion of whole enzyme and large fragment confirm histidine-928 as the carboxylterminus.

https://openalex.org/W1572540799,"The translocation of the mRNA in relation to the ribosome during peptide synthesis represents an example for a mechanochemical reaction in which the chemical bond energy of GTP is transformed into coordinated motion. We demonstrate here that translocation can be explained simply by binding equilibria between the tRNA, the mRNA, and their binding sites on the ribosome. The presence of two cognate tRNAs shifts the association constant for the 70 S ribosome . AUGU3 complex from 6.8 x 10(5) to 2.2 x 10(8) M-1. The elongation factor G and GTP or guanosine-5'-(beta,gamma-methylene)triphosphate GMP-PCP) displace the methionine tRNAs which can be formylated (tRNAfMet) from the quaternary complex 70 S .

AcPhe-tRNAPhe, (N alpha-acetylphenylalanyl-tRNA) an analogue of a peptidyl-tRNA exhibits a 20-fold higher affinity to the peptidyl-tRNA binding site (P site) (K a = 3.5 x 10(6) M-1) as against the A site (K a = 1.8 x 10(6) M-1) at 8 mM Mg2+. Compared to aminoacyl-tRNA and tRNA, peptidyl-tRNA shows a 3- to 15-fold higher affinity toward complementary oligonucleotides both in the binary complex and in the presence of 70 S ribosomes (UUCA . AcPhe-tRNAPhe: K a = 1.9 x 10(5) M-1), UUCA . tRNAPhe:K a = 3.2 x 10(4) M-1). This indicates a stabilization of the peptidyl-tRNA . mRNA complex during translocation. Our data support a concept of mRNA translocation in which the removal of the deacylated tRNA from the P site requires GTP energy and a peptidyl-tRNA . mRNA complex diffuses from its low affinity site (A) to its high affinity binding site (P)."
https://openalex.org/W1554071050,"Alterations in RNA polymerase structure can be detected using initial trypsin cleavage rates as a conformational probe. Both template (poly[d(A-T) . d(A-T)] and the RNA polymerase inhibitor, heparin, alter the rates at which the subunits of the enzyme are cleaved. However, while the presence of poly[d(A-T) . d(A-T)] slows the cleavage of subunits beta, sigma, and alpha by trypsin, heparin accelerates the cleavage of beta and sigma. Furthermore, the presence of heparin does not prevent the effect of poly[d(A-T) . d(A-T)] on the beta and sigma cleavage rates. Thus, heparin does not eliminate the interaction between DNA and RNA polymerase. That heparin does alter the nature of this interaction is demonstrated by the fact that template decreases the trypsin cleavage rate of subunit alpha in the absence, but not in the presence, of heparin. Like heparin, the addition of RNA to the reaction increases the accessibility of beta and sigma to trypsin. Hence the interaction of heparin with RNA polymerase may mimic the product, rather than the template, interaction."
