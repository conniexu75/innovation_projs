https://openalex.org/W3084879098,"Limited knowledge is available on the relationship between antigen-specific immune responses and COVID-19 disease severity. We completed a combined examination of all three branches of adaptive immunity at the level of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell and neutralizing antibody responses in acute and convalescent subjects. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were each associated with milder disease. Coordinated SARS-CoV-2-specific adaptive immune responses were associated with milder disease, suggesting roles for both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in protective immunity in COVID-19. Notably, coordination of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific responses was disrupted in individuals ≥ 65 years old. Scarcity of naive T cells was also associated with aging and poor disease outcomes. A parsimonious explanation is that coordinated CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, and antibody responses are protective, but uncoordinated responses frequently fail to control disease, with a connection between aging and impaired adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2."
https://openalex.org/W3087103626,"Neurological complications are common in patients with COVID-19. Although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal pathogen of COVID-19, has been detected in some patient brains, its ability to infect brain cells and impact their function is not well understood. Here, we investigated the susceptibility of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived monolayer brain cells and region-specific brain organoids to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that neurons and astrocytes were sparsely infected, but choroid plexus epithelial cells underwent robust infection. We optimized a protocol to generate choroid plexus organoids from hiPSCs and showed that productive SARS-CoV-2 infection of these organoids is associated with increased cell death and transcriptional dysregulation indicative of an inflammatory response and cellular function deficits. Together, our findings provide evidence for selective SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism and support the use of hiPSC-derived brain organoids as a platform to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility of brain cells, mechanisms of virus-induced brain dysfunction, and treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3091425478,"Although treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can produce remarkably durable responses, most patients develop early disease progression. Furthermore, initial response assessment by conventional imaging is often unable to identify which patients will achieve durable clinical benefit (DCB). Here, we demonstrate that pre-treatment circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and peripheral CD8 T cell levels are independently associated with DCB. We further show that ctDNA dynamics after a single infusion can aid in identification of patients who will achieve DCB. Integrating these determinants, we developed and validated an entirely noninvasive multiparameter assay (DIREct-On, Durable Immunotherapy Response Estimation by immune profiling and ctDNA-On-treatment) that robustly predicts which patients will achieve DCB with higher accuracy than any individual feature. Taken together, these results demonstrate that integrated ctDNA and circulating immune cell profiling can provide accurate, noninvasive, and early forecasting of ultimate outcomes for NSCLC patients receiving ICIs."
https://openalex.org/W3086214339,"Summary Infants born by vaginal delivery are colonized with maternal fecal microbes. Cesarean section (CS) birth disturbs mother-to-neonate transmission. In this study (NCT03568734), we evaluated whether disturbed intestinal microbiota development could be restored in term CS-born infants by postnatal, orally delivered fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). We recruited 17 mothers, of whom seven were selected after careful screening. Their infants received a diluted fecal sample from their own mothers, taken 3 weeks prior to delivery. All seven infants had an uneventful clinical course during the 3-month follow-up and showed no adverse effects. The temporal development of the fecal microbiota composition of FMT-treated CS-born infants no longer resembled that of untreated CS-born infants but showed significant similarity to that of vaginally born infants. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that the intestinal microbiota of CS-born infants can be restored postnatally by maternal FMT. However, this should only be done after careful clinical and microbiological screening."
https://openalex.org/W3091245808,"Cancer genomes often harbor hundreds of somatic DNA rearrangement junctions, many of which cannot be easily classified into simple (e.g., deletion) or complex (e.g., chromothripsis) structural variant classes. Applying a novel genome graph computational paradigm to analyze the topology of junction copy number (JCN) across 2,778 tumor whole-genome sequences, we uncovered three novel complex rearrangement phenomena: pyrgo, rigma, and tyfonas. Pyrgo are ""towers"" of low-JCN duplications associated with early-replicating regions, superenhancers, and breast or ovarian cancers. Rigma comprise ""chasms"" of low-JCN deletions enriched in late-replicating fragile sites and gastrointestinal carcinomas. Tyfonas are ""typhoons"" of high-JCN junctions and fold-back inversions associated with expressed protein-coding fusions, breakend hypermutation, and acral, but not cutaneous, melanomas. Clustering of tumors according to genome graph-derived features identified subgroups associated with DNA repair defects and poor prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W3089879296,"The control over the extent and timing of G protein signaling is provided by the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins that deactivate G protein α subunits (Gα). Mammalian genomes encode 20 canonical RGS and 16 Gα genes with key roles in physiology and disease. To understand the principles governing the selectivity of Gα regulation by RGS, we examine the catalytic activity of all canonical human RGS proteins and their selectivity for a complete set of Gα substrates using real-time kinetic measurements in living cells. The data reveal rules governing RGS-Gα recognition, the structural basis of its selectivity, and provide principles for engineering RGS proteins with defined selectivity. The study also explores the evolution of RGS-Gα selectivity through ancestral reconstruction and demonstrates how naturally occurring non-synonymous variants in RGS alter signaling. These results provide a blueprint for decoding signaling selectivity and advance our understanding of molecular recognition principles."
https://openalex.org/W3089960120,"Collective metastasis is defined as the cohesive migration and metastasis of multicellular tumor cell clusters. Disrupting various cell adhesion genes markedly reduces cluster formation and colonization efficiency, yet the downstream signals transmitted by clustering remain largely unknown. Here, we use mouse and human breast cancer models to identify a collective signal generated by tumor cell clusters supporting metastatic colonization. We show that tumor cell clusters produce the growth factor epigen and concentrate it within nanolumina-intercellular compartments sealed by cell-cell junctions and lined with microvilli-like protrusions. Epigen knockdown profoundly reduces metastatic outgrowth and switches clusters from a proliferative to a collective migratory state. Tumor cell clusters from basal-like 2, but not mesenchymal-like, triple-negative breast cancer cell lines have increased epigen expression, sealed nanolumina, and impaired outgrowth upon nanolumenal junction disruption. We propose that nanolumenal signaling could offer a therapeutic target for aggressive metastatic breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W3090830885,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the global pandemic of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic disease, but little is known about variations in species susceptibility that could identify potential reservoir species, animal models, and the risk to pets, wildlife, and livestock. Certain species, such as domestic cats and tigers, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, while other species such as mice and chickens are not. Most animal species, including those in close contact with humans, have unknown susceptibility. Hence, methods to predict the infection risk of animal species are urgently needed. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is critical for viral cell entry and infection. Here we integrate species differences in susceptibility with multiple in-depth structural analyses to identify key ACE2 amino acid positions including 30, 83, 90, 322, and 354 that distinguish susceptible from resistant species. Using differences in these residues across species, we developed a susceptibility score that predicts an elevated risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for multiple species including horses and camels. We also demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is nearly optimal for binding ACE2 of humans compared to other animals, which may underlie the highly contagious transmissibility of this virus among humans. Taken together, our findings define potential ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 residues for therapeutic targeting and identification of animal species on which to focus research and protection measures for environmental and public health."
https://openalex.org/W3090798164,"Several HIV-1 and SIV vaccine candidates have shown partial protection against viral challenges in rhesus macaques. However, the protective efficacy of vaccine-elicited polyclonal antibodies has not previously been demonstrated in adoptive transfer studies in nonhuman primates. In this study, we show that passive transfer of purified antibodies from vaccinated macaques can protect naive animals against SIVmac251 challenges. We vaccinated 30 rhesus macaques with Ad26-SIV Env/Gag/Pol and SIV Env gp140 protein vaccines and assessed the induction of antibody responses and a putative protective signature. This signature included multiple antibody functions and correlated with upregulation of interferon pathways in vaccinated animals. Adoptive transfer of purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) from the vaccinated animals with the most robust protective signatures provided partial protection against SIVmac251 challenges in naive recipient rhesus macaques. These data demonstrate the protective efficacy of purified vaccine-elicited antiviral antibodies in this model, even in the absence of virus neutralization."
https://openalex.org/W3091614932,"Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is an aggressive variant of prostate cancer that either develops de novo or arises from prostate adenocarcinoma as a result of treatment resistance. Although the prostate basal cells have been shown to directly generate tumor cells with neuroendocrine features when transduced with oncogenic signaling, the identity of the cell-of-origin for de novo NEPC remains unclear. We show that the TACSTD2high human prostate luminal epithelia cells highly express SOX2 and are relatively enriched in the transition zone prostate. Both TACSTD2high and TACSTD2low luminal cells transduced by constitutively activated AKT1 (caAKT1), and c-Myc can form organoids containing versatile clinically relevant tumor cell lineages with regard to the expression of AR and the neuroendocrine cell markers Synaptophysin and Chromogranin A. Tumor organoid cells derived from the TACSTD2high luminal cells are more predisposed to neuroendocrine differentiation along passaging and are relatively more castration-resistant. Knocking down TACSTD2 and SOX2 both attenuate neuroendocrine differentiation of tumor organoid cells. This study demonstrates de novo neuroendocrine differentiation of the human prostate luminal epithelial cells induced by caAKT1 and c-Myc and reveals an impact of cellular status on initiation of lineage plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W3084651314,"Rapid endovascular thrombectomy, which can only be delivered in specialist centres, is the most effective treatment for acute ischaemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion (LVO). Pre-hospital selection of these patients is challenging, especially in remote and rural areas due to long transport times and limited access to specialist clinicians and diagnostic facilities. We investigated whether combined transcranial ultrasound and clinical assessment (“TUCA” model) could accurately triage these patients and improve access to thrombectomy. We recruited consecutive patients within 72 hours of suspected stroke, and performed non-contrast transcranial colour-coded ultrasonography within 24 hours of brain computed tomography. We retrospectively collected clinical information, and used hospital discharge diagnosis as the “gold standard”. We used binary regression for diagnosis of haemorrhagic stroke, and an ordinal regression model for acute ischaemic stroke with probable LVO, without LVO, transient ischaemic attacks (TIA) and stroke mimics. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and performed a sensitivity analysis. We recruited 107 patients with suspected stroke from July 2017 to December 2019 at two study sites: 13/107 (12%) with probable LVO, 50/107 (47%) with acute ischaemic stroke without LVO, 18/107 (17%) with haemorrhagic stroke, and 26/107 (24%) with stroke mimics or TIA. The model identified 55% of cases with probable LVO who would have correctly been selected for thrombectomy and 97% of cases who would not have required this treatment (sensitivity 55%, specificity 97%, positive and negative predictive values 75% and 93%, respectively). Diagnostic accuracy of the proposed model was superior to the clinical assessment alone. These data suggest that our model might be a useful tool to identify pre-hospital patients requiring mechanical thrombectomy, however a larger sample is required with the use of CT angiogram as a reference test."

This paper presents a novel method of dynamically modeling and forecasting the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia with a high degree of accuracy and in a timely manner using limited data; a valuable resource that can be used to guide government decision-making on societal restrictions on a daily and/or weekly basis. The “partially-observable stochastic process” used in this study predicts not only the future actual values with extremely low error, but also the percentage of unobserved COVID-19 cases in the population.

https://openalex.org/W3090105595,"Brucella ceti infections have been increasingly reported in cetaceans, although a very limited characterization of Mediterranean Brucella spp. isolates has been previously reported and relatively few data exist about brucellosis among cetaceans in Italy. To address this gap, we studied 8 cases of B. ceti infection in striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) stranded along the Italian coastline from 2012 to 2018, investigated thanks to the Italian surveillance activity on stranded cetaceans. We focused on cases of stranding in eastern and western Italian seas, occurred along the Apulia (N = 6), Liguria (N = 1) and Calabria (N = 1) coastlines, through the analysis of gross and microscopic findings, the results of microbiological, biomolecular and serological investigations, as well as the detection of other relevant pathogens. The comparative genomic analysis used whole genome sequences of B. ceti from Italy paired with the publicly available complete genomes. Pathological changes consistent with B. ceti infection were detected in the central nervous system of 7 animals, showing non-suppurative meningoencephalitis. In 4 cases severe coinfections were detected, mostly involving Dolphin Morbillivirus (DMV). The severity of B. ceti-associated lesions supports the role of this microbial agent as a primary neurotropic pathogen for striped dolphins. We classified the 8 isolates into the common sequence type 26 (ST-26). Whole genome SNP analysis showed that the strains from Italy clustered into two genetically distinct clades. The first clade comprised exclusively the isolates from Ionian and Adriatic Seas, while the second one included the strain from the Ligurian Sea and those from the Catalonian coast. Plotting these clades onto the geographic map suggests a link between their phylogeny and topographical distribution. These results represent the first extensive characterization of B. ceti isolated from Italian waters reported to date and show the usefulness of WGS for understanding of the evolution of this emerging pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W3091730256,"Traditional methods to measure spatio-temporal variations in biomass rely on a labor-intensive destructive sampling of the crop. In this paper, we present a high-throughput phenotyping approach for the estimation of Above-Ground Biomass Dynamics (AGBD) using an unmanned aerial system. Multispectral imagery was acquired and processed by using the proposed segmentation method called GFKuts, that optimally labels the plot canopy based on a Gaussian mixture model, a Montecarlo based K-means, and a guided image filtering. Accurate plot segmentation results enabled the extraction of several canopy features associated with biomass yield. Machine learning algorithms were trained to estimate the AGBD according to the growth stages of the crop and the physiological response of two rice genotypes under lowland and upland production systems. Results report AGBD estimation correlations with an average of r = 0.95 and R2 = 0.91 according to the experimental data. We compared our segmentation method against a traditional technique based on clustering. A comprehensive improvement of 13% in the biomass correlation was obtained thanks to the segmentation method proposed herein."
https://openalex.org/W3089497979,"Background Precisely engineered mesoporous silica has been shown to induce weight loss in mice, but whether it is safe to use in humans have not investigated. Objective The aim was to determine whether oral dosing, up to 9 grams/day, of precisely engineered mesoporous silica as a food additive can be used safely in male humans. Design This single blinded safety study consisted of two study arms including 10 males each (18–35 years). One arm consisted of participants with normal weight and one with obesity. After a placebo run-in period, all subjects were given porous silica three times daily, with increasing dose up to 9 grams/day (Phase 1). Subjects with obesity continued the study with highest dose for additional 10 weeks (Phase 2). Results All participants completed Phase 1 and 90% completed Phase 2, with approximately 1% missed doses. Participants reported no abdominal discomfort, and changes in bowel habits were minor and inconsistent. The side effects observed were mild and tolerable, biomarkers did not give any safety concern, and no severe adverse events occurred. Conclusion Mesoporous silica intake of up to 9 grams/day can be consumed by males without any major adverse events or safety concerns."

https://openalex.org/W3091247271,"Topical application of extracellular calreticulin (eCRT), an ER chaperone protein, in animal models enhances wound healing and induces tissue regeneration evidenced by epidermal appendage neogenesis and lack of scarring. In addition to chemoattraction of cells critical to the wound healing process, eCRT induces abundant neo-dermal extracellular matrix (ECM) formation by 3 days post-wounding. The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanisms involved in eCRT induction of ECM. In vitro, eCRT strongly induces collagen I, fibronectin, elastin, α-smooth muscle actin in human adult dermal (HDFs) and neonatal fibroblasts (HFFs) mainly via TGF-β canonical signaling and Smad2/3 activation; RAP, an inhibitor of LRP1 blocked eCRT ECM induction. Conversely, eCRT induction of α5 and β1 integrins was not mediated by TGF-β signaling nor inhibited by RAP. Whereas eCRT strongly induces ECM and integrin α5 proteins in K41 wild-type mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), CRT null MEFs were unresponsive. The data show that eCRT induces the synthesis and release of TGF-β3 first via LRP1 or other receptor signaling and later induces ECM proteins via LRP1 signaling subsequently initiating TGF-β receptor signaling for intracellular CRT (iCRT)-dependent induction of TGF-β1 and ECM proteins. In addition, TGF-β1 induces 2-3-fold higher level of ECM proteins than eCRT. Whereas eCRT and iCRT converge for ECM induction, we propose that eCRT attenuates TGF-β-mediated fibrosis/scarring to achieve tissue regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3091103116,"Background The burden of HPV-associated premalignant and malignant cervical lesions remains high in HIV+ women even under ART treatment. In order to identify possible underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, we studied activation and HIV co-receptor expression in cervical T-cell populations in relation to HIV, HPV and cervical lesion status. Methods Cervical cytobrush (n = 468: 253 HIV- and 215 HIV+; 71% on ART) and blood (in a subset of 39 women) was collected from women in Mbeya, Tanzania. Clinical data on HIV and HPV infection, as well as ART status was collected. T cell populations were characterized using multiparametric flow cytometry-based on their expression of markers for cellular activation (HLA-DR), and memory (CD45RO), as well as HIV co-receptors (CCR5, α4β7). Results Cervical and blood T cells differed significantly, with higher frequencies of T cells expressing CD45RO, as well as the HIV co-receptors CCR5 and α4β7 in the cervical mucosa. The skewed CD4/CD8 T cell ratio in blood of HIV+ women was mirrored in the cervical mucosa and HPV co-infection was linked to lower levels of mucosal CD4 T cells in HIV+ women (%median: 22 vs 32; p = 0.04). In addition, HIV and HPV infection, and especially HPV-associated cervical lesions were linked to significantly higher frequencies of HLA-DR+ CD4 and CD8 T cells (p-values < 0.05). Interestingly, HPV infection did not significantly alter frequencies of CCR5+ or α4β7+ CD4 T cells. Conclusion The increased proportion of activated cervical T cells associated with HPV and HIV infection, as well as HPV-associated lesions, together with the HIV-induced depletion of cervical CD4 T cells, may increase the risk for HPV infection, associated premalignant lesions and cancer in HIV+ women. Further, high levels of activated CD4 T cells associated with HPV and HPV-associated lesions could contribute to a higher susceptibility to HIV in HPV infected women."
https://openalex.org/W3090342684,"Objectives To assess the effects of different types of cataract surgeries and intraocular lenses on generic as well as vision related quality of life of cataract patients, using EQ-5D and IND-VFQ 33 instruments respectively. Methods An observational, longitudinal study of patients undergoing cataract surgery was carried out at three ophthalmology centres. Patients were prospectively admitted for surgery for age-related cataract. Generic quality of life was assessed by using Euroqol’s EQ5D-5L questionnaire and vision related quality of life was assessed by the IND-VFQ-33 questionnaire. Data pertaining to vision function and quality of life were collected pre surgery and 4 weeks after the surgery. Results Out of total patients (n = 814) recruited for the study, 517 patients were interviewed for both pre-surgery and post-surgery for EQ5D and 519 patients were interviewed for both pre-surgery and post-surgery for IND VFQ 33 tool. The combined data from all three centres showed that Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gains observed in patients undergoing phacoemulsification with foldable lens implantation (2.25 QALY) were significantly higher (0.57 QALY) as compared to Small Incision Cataract Surgery (SICS) with PMMA lens implantation (1.68 QALY). Highest improvement however, in all three subscales of IND-VFQ-33 tool were clearly observed for SICS with PMMA lens implantation. Conclusions The study has elicited the Health related and vision related Quality of Life scores for cataract surgeries and subsequent lens implantation. This study also offers Health State Utility Values along with visual outcomes for different surgical procedures, lenses and for the combination of surgery with lens implantation for cataract procedures providing a useful resource for future economic evaluation studies."

https://openalex.org/W3091371334,"BACKGROUND Companionship during delivery is an important feature of compassionate and respectful maternity care. It has a positive impact on delivery and birth outcomes. In low resource countries like Ethiopia lack of companionship discourages women from accessing facility-based delivery care. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the utilization of companionship during delivery and associated factors. METHODS Health facility-based cross-sectional study design was done from October to November 2019. Interviewer administered questionnaires were used to collect the data from 418 study participants. The data were entered with Epi data version 4.4 and exported to Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25.0 for analysis. Binary logistic regression was done. Statistical significance was declared at P- values < 0.05 with a 95% confidence level. RESULTS The finding of the study showed that only 13.8% of mothers utilize companionship during delivery. Variables such as having a desire to have companionship during delivery in the health facilities (AOR = 5.17, CI 95% 2.63, 10.16), having complication during the labor and delivery (AOR = 3.48, CI 95%, 1.81, 6.70), and being primipara (AOR = 2.05, CI 95% 1.09, 3.87) were the independent factors associated with companionship utilization. CONCLUSIONS The finding of the study showed that the utilization of companionship during delivery was low. Permitting women to have a companion of choice during labor and childbirth can be a cost-effective intervention to improve the quality of maternity care, facing complications during delivery, having a desire to have companionship during delivery and primiparous women were more likely to utilize companionship. To improve this low utilization of companionship institutions and care providers should provide information about companionship during antenatal care attendance. Besides, there is a need for clear guidelines to govern the practice of companions."
https://openalex.org/W3089856378,"Binary classification has numerous applications. For one, lie detection methods typically aim to classify each tested person either as “liar” or as “truthteller” based on the given test results. To infer practical implications, as well as to compare different methods, it is essential to assess the diagnostic efficiency, such as demonstrating the number of correctly classified persons. However, this is not always straightforward. In Concealed Information Tests (CITs), the key predictor value (probe-irrelevant difference) for “truthtellers” is always similar (zero on average), and “liars” are always distinguished by a larger value (i.e., a larger number resulting from the CIT test, as compared to the zero baseline). Thereby, in general, the larger predictor values a given CIT method obtains for “liars” on average, the better this method is assumed to be. This has indeed been assumed in countless studies, and therefore, when comparing the classification efficiencies of two different designs, the mean difference of “liar” predictor values in the two designs were simply compared to each other (hence not collecting “truthteller” data to spare resources). We show, based on the meta-data of 12 different experimental designs collected in response time-based CIT studies, that differences in dispersion (i.e., variance in the data, e.g. the extent of random deviations from the zero average in case of “truthtellers”) can substantially influence classification efficiency–to the point that, in extreme cases, one design may even be superior in classification despite having a larger mean “liar” predictor value. However, we also introduce a computer simulation procedure to estimate classification efficiency in the absence of “truthteller” data, and validate this procedure via a meta-analysis comparing outcomes based on empirical data versus simulated data."
https://openalex.org/W3090265644,"Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are chronic, progressive, parenchymal lung diseases with high morbidity and mortality. In recent studies, the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with ILD has been reported to be high. However, the prevalence and predictive factors of OSA in Korean ILD patients are not well defined. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and predictive factors of OSA in Korean patients with ILD. Clinical data from 86 patients with ILD enrolled from December 2017 to April 2019 at Haeundae-Paik Hospital, Busan, South Korea, were retrospectively analyzed. OSA was monitored with a level 4 portable device and defined as an apnea-hypopnea index of more than 5 per hour of sleep. The median follow-up period was 7 months. The mean age was 69.8 years, and 64% of participants were men. Among the ILDs, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) was the most common (66.3%), followed by connective tissue disease-associated ILD (16.3%) and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (5.8%). Forty-six ILD patients (53.5%) were diagnosed with OSA, and IPF patients had OSA more frequently (64.9% vs. 31.0%, p = 0.003) than those with other ILDs. Older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.11, 95% CI 1.04-1.19, p = 0.002), higher body weight (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.10, p = 0.012), and diabetes mellitus (OR 4.03, 95% CI 1.26-12.91, p = 0.019) were independent risk factors for OSA in the multivariable logistic regression analysis. In the multivariable Cox analysis, an IPF diagnosis was a significant risk factor for one-year mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 7.92, 95% CI: 1.01-61.83, p = 0.048) in ILD patients; however, OSA was not. In conclusion, half of Korean patients with ILD had OSA. Older age, higher body weight, and diabetes mellitus were risk factors for OSA in patients with ILD."
https://openalex.org/W3089455781,"Background Rotavirus is the most common cause of fatal diarrhoeal disease among children under the age of five globally and is responsible for millions of hospitalizations each year. Although nutritional status and environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) are recognized as important predictors of susceptibility to diarrhoeal disease, no research to date has examined the mechanisms by which undernutrition and EED may protect against prevalence of rotavirus infection. Methods We utilized data collected from a study evaluating the effectiveness of Rotarix™ vaccine against severe gastroenteritis among children under the age of 5 in Zambia. The prevalence of malnutrition, wasting, and stunting at the time of study enrollment was calculated using WHO child growth standards. Commercial ELISA kits were used to assess levels of faecal biomarkers for EED: alpha-1-antitrypsin and myeloperoxidase, and calprotectin. Separate multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine each measure of nutritional status and rotavirus diarrhoea including and excluding adjustment for EED. Results In models that did not include adjustment for EED, malnourished children had 0.66 times the odds of having rotavirus diarrhoea compared to children with normal nutritional status (95% CI: 0.42, 1.0; p = 0.07). EED severity score was significantly higher among controls asymptomatic for diarrhoeal disease compared to cases with rotavirus diarrhoea (p = 0.02). Conclusion The morphological changes associated with EED may confer protection against rotavirus infection and subsequent diarrhoeal disease among children. Further research is critically needed to better understand the complex mechanisms by which nutritional status and EED may impact susceptibility to rotavirus in early life."
https://openalex.org/W3089474136,"Objective It is increasingly common to find patients affected by a combination of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), dyslipidemia (DLP) and periodontitis (PD), which are chronic inflammatory diseases. More studies able to capture unknown relationships among these diseases will contribute to raise biological and clinical evidence. The aim of this study was to apply association rule mining (ARM) to discover whether there are consistent patterns of clinical features (CFs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) relevant to these diseases. We intend to reinforce the evidence of the T2DM-DLP-PD-interplay and demonstrate the ARM ability to provide new insights into multivariate pattern discovery. Methods We utilized 29 clinical glycemic, lipid and periodontal parameters from 143 patients divided into five groups based upon diabetic, dyslipidemic and periodontal conditions (including a healthy-control group). At least 5 patients from each group were selected to assess the transcriptome by microarray. ARM was utilized to assess relevant association rules considering: (i) only CFs; and (ii) CFs+DEGs, such that the identified DEGs, specific to each group of patients, were submitted to gene expression validation by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Results We obtained 78 CF-rules and 161 CF+DEG-rules. Based on their clinical significance, Periodontists and Geneticist experts selected 11 CF-rules, and 5 CF+DEG-rules. From the five DEGs prospected by the rules, four of them were validated by qPCR as significantly different from the control group; and two of them validated the previous microarray findings. Conclusions ARM was a powerful data analysis technique to identify multivariate patterns involving clinical and molecular profiles of patients affected by specific pathological panels. ARM proved to be an effective mining approach to analyze gene expression with the advantage of including patient’s CFs. A combination of CFs and DEGs might be employed in modeling the patient’s chance to develop complex diseases, such as those studied here."
https://openalex.org/W3090685120,"Foraging animals have to evaluate, compare and select food patches in order to increase their fitness. Understanding what drives foraging decisions requires careful manipulation of the value of alternative options while monitoring animals choices. Value-based decision-making tasks in combination with formal learning models have provided both an experimental and theoretical framework to study foraging decisions in lab settings. While these approaches were successfully used in the past to understand what drives choices in mammals, very little work has been done on fruit flies. This is despite the fact that fruit flies have served as model organism for many complex behavioural paradigms. To fill this gap we developed a single-animal, trial-based decision making task, where freely walking flies experienced optogenetic sugar-receptor neuron stimulation. We controlled the value of available options by manipulating the probabilities of optogenetic stimulation. We show that flies integrate reward history of chosen options and forget value of unchosen options. We further discover that flies assign higher values to rewards experienced early in the behavioural session, consistent with formal reinforcement learning models. Finally, we also show that the probabilistic rewards affect walking trajectories of flies, suggesting that accumulated value is controlling the navigation vector of flies in a graded fashion. These findings establish the fruit fly as a model organism to explore the genetic and circuit basis of reward foraging decisions."
https://openalex.org/W3091145889,"When infants observe a human grasping action, experience-based accounts predict that all infants familiar with grasping actions should be able to predict the goal regardless of additional agency cues such as an action effect. Cue-based accounts, however, suggest that infants use agency cues to identify and predict action goals when the action or the agent is not familiar. From these accounts, we hypothesized that younger infants would need additional agency cues such as a salient action effect to predict the goal of a human grasping action, whereas older infants should be able to predict the goal regardless of agency cues. In three experiments, we presented 6-, 7-, and 11-month-olds with videos of a manual grasping action presented either with or without an additional salient action effect (Exp. 1 and 2), or we presented 7-month-olds with videos of a mechanical claw performing a grasping action presented with a salient action effect (Exp. 3). The 6-month-olds showed tracking gaze behavior, and the 11-month-olds showed predictive gaze behavior, regardless of the action effect. However, the 7-month-olds showed predictive gaze behavior in the action-effect condition, but tracking gaze behavior in the no-action-effect condition and in the action-effect condition with a mechanical claw. The results therefore support the idea that salient action effects are especially important for infants' goal predictions from 7 months on, and that this facilitating influence of action effects is selective for the observation of human hands."

https://openalex.org/W3089455173,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is characterized by a change in brain function after an external force or sudden movement to the head. TBI is associated with risk-taking, impulsivity, psychological distress, substance abuse, and violent crime. Previous studies have also linked problem gambling to TBI, but these studies have not controlled for possible confounding variables such as mental health problems and hazardous drinking which are also linked to TBI. This study examines the relationship between problem gambling and TBI among adolescents. Data were obtained from the 2011, 2013 and 2015 cycles of the OSDUHS, a biennial cross-sectional school-based study of children in grades 7 to 12 (N = 9,198). Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (AOR) in controlled and uncontrolled analyses. Adjusting for sex and grade only, problem gambling was associated with a history of TBI (AOR = 2.8). This association remained significant after adjusting for hazardous drinking and suicidality (AOR = 2.0). In addition, problem gambling had a statistically significant relationship with being male (AOR = 4.7), hazardous drinking (AOR = 4.5), and suicidality (AOR = 3.1). This study provides further data to suggest a link between TBI and problem gambling. However, research is needed on the causal relationship between these variables and the potential implications for treatment and prevention."
https://openalex.org/W3089607205,"Background Hemodynamic monitoring during digestive endoscopy is usually minimal and involves intermittent brachial pressure measurements. New continuous noninvasive devices to acquire instantaneous arterial blood pressure may be more sensitive to detect procedural hypotension. Purpose To compare the ability of noninvasive continuous monitoring with that of intermittent oscillometric measurements to detect hypotension during digestive endoscopy. Methods In this observational prospective study, patients scheduled for gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy under sedation were monitored using intermittent pressure measurements and a noninvasive continuous technique (ClearSight™, Edwards). Stroke volume was estimated from the arterial pressure waveform. Mean arterial pressure and stroke volume values were recorded at T1 (prior to anesthetic induction), T2 (after anesthetic induction), T3 (gastric insufflation), T4 (end of gastroscopy), T5 (colonic insufflation). Hypotension was defined as mean arterial pressure < 65 mmHg. Results Twenty patients (53±17 years) were included. Six patients (30%) had a hypotension detected using intermittent pressure measurements versus twelve patients (60%) using noninvasive continuous monitoring (p = 0.06). Mean arterial pressure decreased during the procedure with respect to T1 (p < 0.05), but the continuous method provided an earlier warning than the intermittent method (T3 vs T4). Nine patients (45%) had at least a 25% reduction in stroke volume, with respect to baseline. Conclusion Noninvasive continuous monitoring was more sensitive than intermittent measurements to detect hypotension. Estimation of stroke volume revealed profound reductions in systemic flow. Noninvasive continuous monitoring in high-risk patients undergoing digestive endoscopy under sedation could help in detecting hypoperfusion earlier than the usual intermittent blood pressure measurements."
https://openalex.org/W3090499886,"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected vector-borne disease associated with socioeconomic and environmental issues. In Brazil, epidemics of VL have occurred in major cities since 1980. Applied models for medical and epidemiological research have been used to assess the distribution and characteristics of disease endpoints and identify and characterize potential risk factors. This study described the demographic features of VL and modeled the spatio-temporal distribution of human VL cases and their relationship with underlying predicitve factors using generalized additive models. We conducted an ecological study covering an 18-year period from the first report of an autochthonous case of VL in Campo Grande, state of Mato Grosso do Sul, in 2001 to 2018. The urban area of the city has 74 neighborhoods, and they were the units of analysis of our work. Socioeconomic and demographic data available from Brazilian public databases were considered as covariables. A total of 1,855 VL cases were reported during the study period, with an annual mean incidence rate of 13.23 cases per 100,000 population and a cumulative crude incidence of 235.77 per 100,000 population. The results showed the rapid transition from epidemic to endemic and the centrifugal dispersal pattern of the disease. Moreover, the model highlighted that the urban quality of life index, which is calculated based on income, education, housing conditions, and environmental sanitation data, plays a role in VL occurrence. Our findings highlighted the potential for improving spatio-temporal segmentation of control measures and the cost-effectiveness of integrated disease management programs as soon as VL is difficult to control and prevent and has rapid geographical dispersion and increased incidence rates."
https://openalex.org/W3090895385,"Bacterial phytopathogen Xylella fastidiosa specifically colonizes the plant vascular tissue through a complex process of cell adhesion, biofilm formation, and dispersive movement. Adaptation to the chemical environment of the xylem is essential for bacterial growth and progression of infection. Grapevine xylem sap contains a range of plant secondary metabolites such as phenolics, which fluctuate in response to pathogen infection and plant physiological state. Phenolic compounds are often involved in host-pathogen interactions and influence infection dynamics through signaling activity, antimicrobial properties, and alteration of bacterial phenotypes. The effect of biologically relevant concentrations of phenolic compounds coumaric acid, gallic acid, epicatechin, and resveratrol on growth of X. fastidiosa was assessed in vitro. None of these compounds inhibited bacterial growth, but epicatechin and gallic acid reduced cell-surface adhesion. Cell-cell aggregation decreased with resveratrol treatment, but the other phenolic compounds tested had minimal effect on aggregation. Expression of attachment (xadA) and aggregation (fimA) related genes were altered by presence of the phenolic compounds, consistent with observed phenotypes. All four of the phenolic compounds bound to purified X. fastidiosa lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major cell-surface component. Information regarding the impact of chemical environment on pathogen colonization in plants is important for understanding the infection process and factors associated with host susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W3089584307,"Introduction Diuretic resistance (DR) is a common condition during a heart failure (HF) hospitalization, and is related to worse prognosis. Although the risk factors for DR during a HF hospitalization are widely described, we do not know whether the risk of chronic DR could be predicted during admission. Material and methods We conducted a multicenter, prospective observational study between July 2017 and July 2019. All patients admitted for acute HF with intravenous diuretic treatment and at least one criterion of congestion on admission were invited to participate. Patients on renal replacement therapy, under intravenous diuretic treatment for >72 hours before screening and those who were unable to sign the informed consent were excluded. We monitored decongestion (physical exam, hemoconcentration, NTproBNP change and lung ultrasound) and DR (diuresis and weight loss per unit of 40mg furosemide and fractional excretion of sodium) on the fifth day of admission. Chronic DR was evaluate two months after hospitalization and was defined as persistent signs of congestion despite ≥80 mg furosemide per day. We compared variables from the hospitalization between patients with and without chronic DR. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to find predictors of chronic DR. Results A total of 105 patients were included in the study. Mean age was 74.5±12.0 years, 64.8% were male and mean LVEF was 46±17%. In the two months follow-up, five patients have died and one patient has had a heart transplant. Of the 99 remaining patients, 21 patients (21.2%) had chronic DR. The dose of furosemide before admission and the decrease in NT-proBNP ≤30% during admission were predictors of chronic DR in the multivariate analysis. Conclusions We can predict during a HF hospitalization which patients will develop chronic DR. The dose of furosemide before admission and the change in NT-proBNP are independent predictors of chronic DR."

https://openalex.org/W3090801177,"To evaluate the impact of Birdshot-Retinochoroidopathy (BSRC) and Serpiginous Choroiditis (SC) on depression, anxiety, and vision-related quality of life. 72 individuals (BSRC: n = 28, SC: n = 8; healthy control group (HC): n = 36) completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and the Visual Function Questionnaire (VFQ-25). Multivariate linear regression models were used to analyze different subscales of the PHQ-9, the GAD-7 and the VFQ-25. The results showed that the mean of PHQ-9 was significantly higher while the mean of the VFQ-25 and its´ subscales were consistently lower in the disease group compared to HC. The mean of GAD-7 was not significantly lower in the disease group compared to HC. Stratification for different disease severity stages and duration of disease did not reveal any differences in sum scores of PHQ-9, GAD-7, and VFQ-25, whereas there were significant differences in some subscales of the VFQ-25. We conclude that BSRC and SC patients show higher levels of depression and a reduced visual quality of life due to imminent loss of vision. Because depression and quality of life are adversely affected by lack of social contacts and functioning, psychological treatment should enable patients to maintain their independence and ability to social interaction. Psychosomatic care should be taken in account for the treatment of BSRC and SC."
https://openalex.org/W3090863674,"Background Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is widely used in the treatment of malaria, rheumatologic disease such as lupus, and most recently, COVID-19. These uses raise concerns about its safe use in the setting of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, especially as 11% of African American men carry the G6PD A- variant. However, limited data exist regarding the safety of HCQ in this population. Study design and methods Recently, we created a novel “humanized” mouse model containing the G6PD deficiency A- variant (Val68Met) using CRISPR technology. We tested the effects of high-dose HCQ administration over 5 days on hemolysis in our novel G6PD A- mice. In addition to standard hematologic parameters including plasma hemoglobin, erythrocyte methemoglobin, and reticulocytes, hepatic and renal function were assessed after HCQ. Results Residual erythrocyte G6PD activity in G6PD A- mice was ~6% compared to wild-type (WT) littermates. Importantly, we found no evidence of clinically significant intravascular hemolysis, methemoglobinemia, or organ damage in response to high-dose HCQ. Conclusions Though the effects of high doses over prolonged periods was not assessed, this study provides early, novel safety data of the use of HCQ in the setting of G6PD deficiency secondary to G6PD A-. In addition to novel safety data for HCQ, to our knowledge, we are the first to present the creation of a “humanized” murine model of G6PD deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W3090969440,"The pandemic has impacted every scientist differently. Many negative impacts are frequently discussed. Here we highlight unexpected positives that we have found and hope will persist: improved access to experts; deeper and broader human engagement among colleagues, collaborators, and competitors; and significant democratization of research. The pandemic has impacted every scientist differently. Many negative impacts are frequently discussed. Here we highlight unexpected positives that we have found and hope will persist: improved access to experts; deeper and broader human engagement among colleagues, collaborators, and competitors; and significant democratization of research. Since early March, it has felt like we are attending a worldwide lab meeting for the largest shared research project ever conducted. Our perspectives are those of a professor directing a global collaboration for SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics and a postdoctoral fellow in her laboratory who is focused on illumination of viral targets by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). Meetings of the Coronavirus Immunotherapy Consortium (CoVIC) mean that the alarm rings for one of the authors (Saphire) at 5:15 a.m. and the coffee pot perks to commence the twice weekly 5:30 a.m. phone conferences on standards and models needed for SARS-CoV-2 research. The timing is punishing to those on both sides of the Pacific, but scientists and stakeholders at all time zones are present and commenting on novel data. Our experience now and with Ebola is that a pandemic brings out the worst in some people but the best in many others. The best is particularly evident in these international troubleshooting sessions when ideas and materials are offered freely and eagerly, more agnostic to competitive and physical boundaries than at other times. We report and receive weekly updates and input from colleagues whom we would typically see just once or twice in other years, and would see only in more formal settings. The greater frequency of interaction with our national and international colleagues amplifies the greater urgency and greater shared purpose. Equally overworked experts around the world frequently share an hour of rare stolen Saturday mornings, or stay late on Friday nights to catch up and advise on questions of the CoVIC, wishing each other well and offering needed reagents. Up to 20 other meetings per week by Zoom, Teams, Webex, BlueJeans, FaceTime, and a few other formats have made the width of the country and the breadth of the oceans dissolve. The extent and speed of our united efforts on COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 projects worldwide have been breathtaking. Data, analyses, and predictions from thousands of labs, representing many different disciplines in all parts of the world, are pouring into our consciousness daily from preprint servers, social media, podcasts, and discussion boards. One of the authors (Saphire) hasn’t had a workday less than 12 hours since February, with her spouse picking up all of the slack at home. The other (Arturo) is juggling childcare along with experiments to be done in the lab. All bench biologists are navigating biological experiments that rarely adhere to set schedules being further complicated by the sometimes odd working hours used to achieve sufficient physical distancing in a busy and crowded lab. This new routine is exhausting, and we can’t yet afford to slow down. Immunity for the masses, delivered safely by biomedical advances, is needed before most of the world can emerge from our houses and continue safely with human endeavors. It is the worst of times, the most pressing, and the most urgent, but it’s also the most illuminating and vitalizing to the fields of virology and immunology. We knew them to be essential, but now the questions of whether we will have immune memory and antibody activity are on everyone’s minds. Changes in space and connection are felt within our own lab as well. We used to be on top of each other, elbow to elbow. Now, we are distanced in time and space, with many writing, reading, and processing data at home amid distractions that are different from those of the laboratory. We use video conferencing to coordinate with one another to make more efficient use of our respective time in the lab to keep joint projects flowing smoothly. One might expect that the physical distance and lack of “face time” among colleagues would lead to a mental distance as well, but we have found the opposite. One-on-one meetings via video conference with the PI or with lab mates are more focused, more natural, and more personal. Since we haven’t seen each other in a while, this time is more special and enjoyable. It’s not just another thing to tick off in the day, before sidestepping each other in crowded corridors while juggling flasks and to-do lists. Lab meetings are by Zoom with the 30 of us Brady-bunch style in a photo grid. When the speaker begins, we see the data better on our own screens than we did in the typical lab meeting conference room. When shelter-in-place directives were first issued, many of us had to end our lab work and transition almost entirely to work from home. While at home, many structural biologists used the opportunity to get up to speed with new technology developments. Cryo-EM technologies, for example, are in constant development, putting users under perpetual pressure to adapt to changes in the algorithms, image processing, and the software required to obtain better structural information. Many of us are self-taught in key aspects, but self-teaching can be cautious and slow, which may not be options during a pandemic. To learn better and faster, we need continued access to experts that in-person workshops, now canceled, had previously provided. We are pleased to have found that the lockdown of the pandemic did not make us more isolated from experts, but instead gave us greater access to them. The cryo-EM centers supported by the National Institutes of Health Common Fund have recently made lecture material from workshops freely available online and also provided small-group “roundtable” discussions and one-on-one “office hours.” In this program, EM scientists from both the National Center for CryoEM Access & Training (NCCAT, New York) and the Pacific Northwest CryoEM Center (PNCC, Portland) have been available by Zoom to discuss individuals’ datasets. This provision for highly personalized coaching in data analysis and processing is different from an experience at a workshop with sometimes quite large classes, and the need to travel from home to attend them. Outside lockdown, these scientists are usually overrun with demands for their time and are overseeing a fully booked facility. The availability of office hours during the pandemic were a boon. In other examples, the COVID-19 Open Structures Platform and the Coronavirus Structural Task Force are collaborative projects driven by structural biologists volunteering time and resources to the structural biology of COVID-19. These volunteers audit and refine the rapidly growing collections of protein structures and offer expert advice and collaboration for more rapid completion of data analysis and model building of COVID-19-related proteins. One participant produces and publishes online videos using Twitch where anyone can watch the inspection, refinement, and rebuilding of previously deposited or predicted structures related to this virus. These presentations provide a previously uncommon opportunity to see how experts build and refine models as they do it. Access to a variety of professional group meetings is now immensely easier to pursue in spite of, or because of, the pandemic’s limitations on travel and congregating. For example, the California-based Cryo-EM Center at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) recently held their 3-day cryo-EM workshop via Zoom with over 300 participants at the lectures and 60 students enrolled to engage in the practical course using cloud-based resources to perform computations in real time with the speaker. The speaker and moderators fielded over 150 questions per lecture, with each question and answer maintained in text and available via transcript later on for future reference. Pre-pandemic, a quiet newcomer might not muster up the courage or be so lucky to catch the attention of the speaker to ask a question, let alone two, in a room where at least half the participants each also had a question. This new format allowed questions to flow to the chat box during the presentation where a moderator arranged and relayed them in a rational way at various points during the workshop. If one didn’t catch the answer, one could expect to find the answer, in a searchable format, along with the recording soon after the organizers would post it alongside the speaker’s slides. No conferences pre-pandemic that we know of had ever featured a comprehensive record of all questions and answers that were discussed after a lecture. We have also participated in several other meetings initially planned as in-person events but then turned virtual, including the Spotlight Sessions of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB) and the Collaborative Computational Project for Electron Microscopy (CCP-EM) Spring Symposium. Questions were answered by the speakers either live or in text after their presentation. Again, the in-text answers were particularly useful relative to the shorter Q&A sessions that typically follow in-person conference sessions. In the lab, our schedules have changed in many ways. We no longer overlap physically as extensively as we once did; several of us have shifted our lab time to start at 6 a.m., while others begin their day in the lab at 6 p.m. Others with family obligations that further complicate their schedules are welcome and able to work on a flexible schedule throughout all or any days of the week. The flexibility in number of hours devoted to lab work per day or on any given week has often been a positive aspect of academic science, but it is now a critical feature of our current lives. Despite the period of adjustment to the new schedule, productivity seems positively affected by allowing more personal choice in how and when work is done in the laboratory. Our staggered hours have also pushed us to communicate more often, more precisely, and sometimes more personally with colleagues, which has led to a deeper appreciation for one another and greater efficiency. We have also found that the necessity of video conferences (whether it’s among lab colleagues or with collaborators around the world) has blurred work-life boundaries and humanized us all: life for anyone, no matter their pedigree, job title, career stage, or age, can be messy, artsy, full of children and other distractions, and accented by blank walls or eccentric backdrops. The need to physically travel to attend workshops and conferences had previously limited participation for some scientists. Labs without travel funding can now more freely attend workshops and conferences. Those with disabilities that limit physical travel can also now attend and interact with speakers and colleagues around the world. One author (Arturo) was able to participate in the aforementioned ASBMB, CCP-EM, and SLAC meetings, plus two dissertation defenses on topics related to her work, one in the UK, one on a remote California campus, while supervising at-home learning for her sixth- and fourth-grade children. Overall, hands raised online are now more equal—you don’t have to have a big name, a loud voice, or significant funds or time for travel to join the conversation. Whereas before we would only see an industry expert at a conference in a hotel ballroom, now we know what board games their family plays (we have those games too). We venture to predict that this format for workshops and conferences is here to stay. For years, climate activists had been advocating for conference organizers to broadcast live sessions in parallel with or instead of in-person meetings in order to reduce fossil fuel use associated with travel, while advocates for people with disabilities had been clamoring for telecast live meetings to make the meetings more widely accessible. Parents of children who had also previously struggled with the overlap of typical lab working hours with school-related activities are exploring more flexible schedules. These trials in virtual conference meetings and staggered work hours will help us sort out how to make these accommodations and allowances for one another a permanent feature of scientific workflow. Scientists the world over have indeed been impressively productive, creative, collaborative, and resilient under the circumstances, and we highlight only a few examples here. However, it’s important to acknowledge how exhausted we have become, what little promise there is of upcoming respite, and how much more vulnerable we are to a variety of societal ailments as a result of this seemingly endless research project. When the first conferences and in-person meetings were canceled beginning in early March, many of us felt a momentary relief as we watched our travel calendars clear up. For some of us now, our schedules are becoming even more crunched. But perhaps we’re getting better at all of this, more efficient and more appreciative of one another and of our own abilities to adapt and make something permanently good out of a difficult situation. We reflect on these positive aspects—greater access to experts and a greater and newer sense of camaraderie—in hopes that these features of the scientific workflow can be further developed even when a raging pandemic is no longer driving them."

Isolates of V. parahaemolyticus from clinical samples (n = 54) and environmental samples (n = 38) in Huzhou were analyzed by serological typing, virulence gene detection, antibiotic resistance testing, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) for molecular typing. O3:K6 was the main serotype and tlh+tdh+trh- was the most frequently detected virulence genotype in clinical strains. O2:Kut was the main serotype and tlh+tdh-trh- was the most frequently detected virulence genotype in environmental strains. Antibiotic resistance testing indicated that the isolates were highly resistant to ampicillin (90.76%), followed by gentamicin and tetracycline. Following the restriction enzyme NotI digestion, the 91 strains yielded 81 PFGE patterns, and 16 clones had similarity values of > 85.00%, indicating a high level of diversity. Finally, there may be cross-contamination between freshwater and seawater products, so it is necessary to strengthen supervision of food processing."
https://openalex.org/W3089724393,"Objective Placental malaria is a known risk factor for small for gestational age (SGA) neonates. However, currently utilized international and African birthweight standards have not controlled for placental malaria and/or lack obstetrical ultrasound dating. We developed a neonatal birthweight standard based on obstetrically dated pregnancies that excluded individuals with clinical malaria, asymptomatic parasitemia, and placental malaria infection. We hypothesized that current curves underestimate true ideal birthweight and the prevalence of SGA. Study design Participants were pooled from two double-blind randomized control trials of intermittent preventive therapy during pregnancy in Uganda. HIV-negative women without comorbidities were enrolled from 12–20 weeks gestation. Gestational age was confirmed by ultrasound dating. Women were followed through pregnancy and delivery for clinical malaria, asymptomatic parasitemia, and placental malaria. Women without malaria, asymptomatic parasitemia, or placental malaria formed the malaria negative cohort and generated the Ugandan birthweight standard. The Ugandan standard was then used to estimate the prevalence of SGA neonates in the malaria positive cohort. These findings were compared to international (Williams, World Health Organization (WHO), and INTERGROWTH-21st) and regional standards (Tanzanian and Malawi). Results 926 women had complete delivery data; 393 (42.4%) met criteria for the malaria negative cohort and 533 (57.6%) were malaria positive. The Ugandan standard diagnosed SGA in 17.1% of malaria positive neonates; similar to the INTERGROWTH-21st and Schmiegelow curves. The WHO curve diagnosed SGA in significantly more neonates (32.1%, p = <0.001), and the Malawi curve diagnosed SGA in significantly fewer neonates (8.3%, p <0.001). Conclusion Exclusion of women with subclinical placental malaria in malaria-endemic areas created birth weight norms at higher values and increased the detection of SGA. Birth weight standards that fail to account for endemic illness may underestimate the true growth potential of healthy neonates."
https://openalex.org/W3090256863,"Evidence of risk assessment procedures is scarce and inconclusive. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of risk assessment on aggression and the use of coercive interventions in an acute psychiatric admission setting. In addition, we evaluated nurse behaviour before and after the use of risk assessment. To take the fluctuations with regard to aggression and coercive interventions into account, we allowed 26 weeks for baseline measurements, followed by a 26 weeks steady-state period after the implementation of the risk assessment instrument. Contrary to expectations, no positive effects of risk assessment were found on aggression or on coercive interventions. Time spent in seclusion increased significantly with more than 10 hours on average after implementation. Furthermore, there were only negative effects on nurse behaviour and experiences. Among other things, they felt more stressed, spent more time on administration tasks and spent less time with patients after the implementation. In conclusion, there is insufficient evidence to use structured short-term risk assessment to reduce aggression or coercive interventions."

https://openalex.org/W3090398784,"Lesion mimic (Lm) mutants display hypersensitive responses (HR) without any pathogen attack; their symptoms are similar to those produced by a pathogen and result in cell death. In wheat, such mutants have been reported to be resistant against leaf rust due to their biotrophic nature. However, Lm mutants tend to encourage spot blotch (SB) disease caused by Bipolarissorokiniana since dead cells facilitate pathogen multiplication. In this study, 289 diverse wheat germplasm lines were phenotyped in three consecutive growing seasons (2012–2015). Genotype data was generated using the Illumina iSelect beadchip assay platform for wheat germplasm lines. A total of 13,589 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected andused for further association mapping. Lm was positively associated with Area Under Disease Progress Curve (AUDPC) for SB but negatively with glaucous index (GI), leaf tip necrosis (Ltn) and latent period (LP). Ltn had a negative association with AUDPC and Lm but a positive one with LP. In a genome-wide association study (GWAS), 29 markers were significantly associated with these traits and 27 were an notated. Seven SNP markers associated with Lm were on chromosome 6A; another on 1B was found to be linked with Ltn. Like wise, seven SNP markers were associated with GI; one on chromosome 6A with the others on 6B. Five SNP markers on chromosomes 3B and 3Dwere significantly correlated with LP, while nine SNP markers on chromosomes 5A and 5B were significantly associated with AUDPC for SB. This study is the first to explore the interaction in wheat between Lm mutants and the hemibiotrophic SB pathogen B.sorokiniana."
https://openalex.org/W3089911479,"Despite considerable evidence demonstrating that waist circumference (WC) is independently associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and/or all-cause mortality, whether the addition of WC improves risk prediction models is unclear. The objective was to evaluate the improvement in risk prediction with the addition of WC, alone or in combination with BMI, to the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and a population specific model. 34,377 men and 9,477 women aged 20 to 79 years who completed a baseline examination at the Cooper Clinic (Dallas, TX) during 1977–2003 and enrolled in the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study (ACLS). WC was measured at the level of the umbilicus and expressed as a continuous variable. Deaths among participants were identified using the National Center for Health Statistics National Death Index. A total of 728 fatal cardiovascular disease (CVD) events occurred over a mean follow-up period of 13.1 ± 7.5 years. WC was significantly higher in CVD decedents (P = .002). The FRS C-statistic for fatal CVD in men was 0.836 (0.816–0.855) and 0.883 (0.851–0.915) in women. The addition of WC did not improve the C-statistic in men (0.831 (0.809–0.853)) or women (0.883 (0.850–0.916)). Similar findings were observed for non-fatal CVD and all-cause mortality, and when WC was added to a population specific model. Upon adding WC, the net-reclassification index was 0.024 with an integrated discrimination improvement of -0.0004. The addition of WC, alone or in combination with BMI, did not substantively improve risk prediction for CVD or all-cause mortality compared to the Framingham Risk Score or a population specific model."

Specifically, we design, analyze and implement AnyCase, a proof-of-concept prototype system on the Ethereum platform. We focus on the establishment of a sybil-resistant voting protocol used for reaching agreement and the development of a tokenized economy that incentivizes participation. Our preliminary analysis indicates that, besides being decentralized, AnyCase has the potential to compete with existing centralized systems in several other aspects."
https://openalex.org/W3090914951,"Modulation of gene activity by creating mutations has contributed significantly to the understanding of protein functions. Oftentimes, however, mutational analyses use overexpression studies, in which proteins are taken out of their normal contexts and stoichiometries. In the present work, we sought to develop an approach to simultaneously use the CRISPR/Cas9 and Cre-Lox techniques to modify the endogenous SAT1 gene to introduce mutant forms of the protein while still under the control of its natural gene promoter. We cloned the C-terminal portion of wild type (WT) SAT1, through the transcriptional stop elements, and flanked by LoxP sites in front of an identical version of SAT1 containing point mutations in critical binding sites. The construct was inserted into the endogenous SAT1 locus by Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) after a CRISPR/Cas9 induced DNA double strand break. After validating that normal function of SAT1 was not altered by the insertional event, we were then able to assess the impact of point mutations by introduction of Cre recombinase. The system thus enables generation of cells in which endogenous WT SAT1 can be conditionally modified, and allow investigation of the functional consequences of site specific mutations in the context of the normal promoter and chromatin regulation."

Through social media and our reviewer networks, we met some early-career stem cell investigators impacted by the closures. Here, they introduce themselves and their research to our readers. COVID-19 has unfortunately halted lab work, conferences, and in-person networking, which is especially detrimental to researchers just starting their labs. Through social media and our reviewer networks, we met some early-career stem cell investigators impacted by the closures. Here, they introduce themselves and their research to our readers. It was early March and after 6 months of renovation, my tissue culture room was finally complete. As stem cell biologists we know we will spend hours in this room and have to get it right. I had a research assistant, cells ready to be cultured, and my own ideas to test when our institute shutdown the very next day. Reality had set in, and I felt that I had all of this momentum but nowhere to go. I tried to channel that energy into anything productive, but the next few months felt unfulfilling. I had worries about balancing working from home and virtual learning for the kids, the fear of a second shutdown if I started experiments, and wondering if grant reviewers would understand if I had no preliminary data. Thankfully, our institute provided both well-being and research support during this time, and it has helped me feel optimistic and that we are not alone. As we restart lab operations, I am excited to think about my scientific goals again. Our lab aims to uncover cell-type-specific contributions to neurological disease, especially from a glial perspective. Glial cells are fascinating. These are the most abundant cell types in the brain and have numerous roles in development and maintaining homeostasis. They have been implicated in multiple diseases for which there are few answers. With the ability to generate subsets of these cells more rapidly from pluripotent stem cells, we are currently working with clinicians and engineers to develop meaningful platforms to integrate patient data toward understanding the role glia play in neurodevelopmental disorders. Adult neural stem cells (ANSCs) persist in specific locations of the brain of most mammals where they produce neurons that integrate into existing neuronal networks to modulate brain function. ANSCs are inactive—or quiescent—until receiving the right activation stimuli. They also have a limited ability to self-renew, meaning that their activation is tightly coupled with exhaustion. Stem cell numbers rapidly decline with age, halting neurogenesis and causing symptoms characteristic of neural disorders such as dementia and depression. Although adult neurogenesis can be modulated by exercise, diet, or stress, the specific signals by which those stimuli regulate ANSCs or the molecular pathways they activate are largely unknown. We use transgenic mice and in vitro tools to elucidate how systemic stimuli influence the transition of ANSCs between quiescence and activation, with the ultimate goal of devising strategies to prevent stem cell exhaustion during aging. The pandemic hit us right when our very long experiments were starting to kick off and coincided with several changes in the group. Contrary to what I feared, we actually came closer together as a team, which makes me extremely proud of the people I have the pleasure to work with. My personal experience of the COVID-19 crisis is mixed with that of becoming a working parent and I am finding it hard to tell their influences apart. Despite the many challenges ahead, I look forward to navigating the era of the “new normal,” where scientific collaborations and science communication are more important than ever. My laboratory, established just a little over 3.5 years ago at the University of California, Los Angeles, focuses on developing organoid models of disease to investigate cancer onset, progression, and response to therapy. Patient-derived organoids can be easily developed from a variety of normal tissues and tumors; they are invaluable models to investigate the biology of healthy and diseased organs. We are particularly interested in using patient-derived organoids to investigate tumor evolution and heterogeneity in rare cancers. While some rare cancers are well characterized, the majority remains understudied, with some having no approved first line therapy and little information on drug sensitivities. We are working to implement our personalized organoid screening platform to identify actionable information for rare cancers. This was supposed to be our most productive year yet; I was looking forward to travel more than ever before. All came to an abrupt stop in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 3 months we spent at home during the first shutdown have been incredibly challenging, as we juggled novel professional and personal obstacles. We are now back in the lab at reduced capacity; we have found ways to become differentially productive and resume our work on rare tumors. Nonetheless, the consequences of the pandemic will be long-lived, with a catastrophic impact on many early-career researchers, women, and parents. I hope that the challenges of the past few months will inspire better, more just, and equitable ways to practice science and support vulnerable researchers moving forward. Beautiful movies of cells and tissues produced in labs every day are casting a fundamental question for theoreticians: can we ever “understand” any of this? Our group in RIKEN (Kobe, Japan) studies multicellular dynamics and cell fate decisions by combining live cell imaging experiments and theoretical physics. We have so far been working on elucidating the effect of cytoskeleton chirality in the collective cell flow and developing theories related to chromatin dynamics and phase separation in cells. With help from our excellent collaborators, we are currently migrating more toward the intracellular world, with keen interest in the physical mechanism behind the robustness of cell differentiation. Thanks to our five lab members who smoothly adapted to the new situation, the damage caused by the prolonged work-from-home period was less significant for us. It also helped that most of us had dry work on our hands, some of which has turned into exciting theory projects. Within the institute, the positive impact was the regulations on office hours and working locations getting swiftly removed, which will hopefully trigger policy reforms for RIKEN to be more inclusive for women and international members. The online seminars and science on social media are also positive developments in this challenging period. Although the all-online scheme has a lot of benefits, it has unexpectedly led to substantial regional effects due to time and language differences. We are now seeking to maintain opportunities especially for young researchers in Japan to connect with the rest of the world. After 10 years of training in stem cells, neuroscience, and engineering at Harvard, Scripps, and MIT, I am excited to launch my independent career at the Icahn School of Medicine. COVID-19 has imposed many challenges and delayed the opening of my lab, but it has also afforded more time to pursue funding, recruit talent, and build collaborations. Since childhood I’ve been intrigued by why some people experience cognitive impairments with age and others remain cognitively normal into their nineties and beyond. When my lab opens next fall, we will investigate how genetics, diet, and traumatic injury influence susceptibility of the human brain to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s. To achieve this, we combine engineering with stem cell biology to reconstruct human brain tissue in vitro that incorporates vasculature, myelination, and neuro-immune systems. Our tractable 3D models enable us to replay disease pathogenesis to dissect how genetic, diet, and environmental factors impact neurodegeneration. We complement our in vitro analysis with studies on post-mortem human brain tissue and animal models. Through this interdisciplinary approach, we aim to generate pathogenic maps detailing the molecular and cellular events preceding end-stage pathology found in human brains, target and modulate these pathways as potential therapeutic strategies, and establish pioneering technology to unravel complex genetic and cellular interactions in the human brain. Our ultimate goal is to facilitate a precision medicine approach to understanding and treating neurodegenerative diseases. During my Ph.D. studies in Peking University, I mainly focused on germline cycle, single-cell -omics technology (e.g., the development of the scCOOL-seq method) and data mining. In September 2019, I was thrilled to start my independent lab in Southern Medical University (Guangzhou, China). We focus on the life cycle of germline cells and will continue our research on developing/applying single-cell multi-omics technology in the germline cycle. We also aim to extend these techniques to better understand developmental disorders. Moreover, we will investigate -omics interactions (e.g., transcriptome, genetic, and epigenetic) and molecular mechanisms involved in the development and progression of disorders or diseases. We hope to identify the phase-specific regulatory elements or factors that control cell-fate transitions and investigate their functional mechanism using in vivo/in vitro models. After busy preparation to get everything ready in my lab, COVID-19 arrived. My lab shut down shortly after we opened. None of the students could come to school to see the lab or meet lab members, which limited the training of my new team. Luckily, everyone is healthy and safe. As a young researcher, I am thankful for supportive collaborators that have provided some data to analyze as we work from home. Our students are also hardworking. Everyone reads papers about a topic at home, which we then discuss online. After a long time at home, thinking and planning, my team and I are well-prepared to come back to the lab and work together to write a new chapter in germline cells."
