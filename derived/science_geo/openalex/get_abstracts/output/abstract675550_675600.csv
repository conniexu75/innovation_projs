https://openalex.org/W3172812363,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is continuing to evolve around the world, generating new variants that are of concern on the basis of their potential for altered transmissibility, pathogenicity, and coverage by vaccines and therapeutic agents1–5. Here we show that serum samples taken from twenty human volunteers, two or four weeks after their second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine, neutralize engineered SARS-CoV-2 with a USA-WA1/2020 genetic background (a virus strain isolated in January 2020) and spike glycoproteins from the recently identified B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2, B.1.618 (all of which were first identified in India) or B.1.525 (first identified in Nigeria) lineages. Geometric mean plaque reduction neutralization titres against the variant viruses—particularly the B.1.617.1 variant—seemed to be lower than the titre against the USA-WA1/2020 virus, but all sera tested neutralized the variant viruses at titres of at least 1:40. The susceptibility of the variant strains to neutralization elicited by the BNT162b2 vaccine supports mass immunization as a central strategy to end the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic globally. Samples of serum from individuals immunized with the BNT162b2 vaccine show neutralization activity against engineered SARS-CoV-2s bearing the spike mutations from B.1.617 and other variants."

Shugar et al. describe the cascade of events that led to this disaster. A massive rock and ice avalanche roared down a Himalayan valley, turning into a deadly debris flow upstream from the first of the two hydropower plants. The sequence of events highlights the increasing risk in the Himalayas caused by increased warming and development. Science , abh4455, this issue p. 300"

One relatively promising option under study involves reductive formation of lithium nitride, which can be protonated to ammonia. However, the ethanol used to date as a local proton source in these studies may degrade under the reaction conditions. Suryanto et al. report the use of a tetraalkyl phosphonium salt in place of ethanol (see the Perspective by Westhead et al. ). This cation can stably undergo deprotonation–reprotonation cycles and, as an added benefit, it enhances the ionic conductivity of the medium.

https://openalex.org/W3167239942,"Despite their ionic nature, many layered diatomic crystals avoid internal electric polarization by forming a centrosymmetric lattice at their optimal anti-parallel van-der-Waals stacking. Here, we report a stable ferroelectric order emerging at the interface between two naturally-grown flakes of hexagonal-boron-nitride, which are stacked together in a metastable non-centrosymmetric parallel orientation. We observe alternating domains of inverted normal polarization, caused by a lateral shift of one lattice site between the domains. Reversible polarization switching coupled to lateral sliding is achieved by scanning a biased tip above the surface. Our calculations trace the origin of the phenomenon to a subtle interplay between charge redistribution and ionic displacement, and our minimal cohesion model predicts further venues to explore the unique ""slidetronics"" switching."

Here, we introduce a comprehensive platform for multispectral imaging and mapping of multiple parameters in tumor tissue sections with high-fidelity single-cell resolution. Image analysis and data handling components were drawn from the field of astronomy. Using this ""AstroPath"" whole-slide platform and only six markers, we identified key features in pretreatment melanoma specimens that predicted response to anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)-based therapy, including CD163+PD-L1- myeloid cells and CD8+FoxP3+PD-1low/mid T cells. These features were combined to stratify long-term survival after anti-PD-1 blockade. This signature was validated in an independent cohort of patients with melanoma from a different institution."
https://openalex.org/W3170819454,"Turning down tolerance Persister cells, which are found in abundance in biofilms, adopt a quiescent state and survive antimicrobial treatments, seeding disease recurrence and incubating new resistance mutations. Building on work implicating the reactive small-molecule hydrogen sulfide in bacterial defense against antibiotics, Shatalin et al. conducted a structure-based screen for inhibitors of a bacterial hydrogen sulfide–producing enzyme and found a group of inhibitors that act through an allosteric mechanism (see the Perspective by Mah). These inhibitors potentiated bactericidal antibiotics in vitro and in mouse infection models. They also suppressed persister bacteria and disrupted biofilm formation. This strategy of taking out persister cells may be promising for treating recalcitrant infections and holding the line against drug-resistant bacteria.

https://openalex.org/W3169034483,"Mass vaccination has the potential to curb the current COVID-19 pandemic by protecting individuals who have been vaccinated against the disease and possibly lowering the likelihood of transmission to individuals who have not been vaccinated. The high effectiveness of the widely administered BNT162b vaccine from Pfizer–BioNTech in preventing not only the disease but also infection with SARS-CoV-2 suggests a potential for a population-level effect, which is critical for disease eradication. However, this putative effect is difficult to observe, especially in light of highly fluctuating spatiotemporal epidemic dynamics. Here, by analyzing vaccination records and test results collected during the rapid vaccine rollout in a large population from 177 geographically defined communities, we find that the rates of vaccination in each community are associated with a substantial later decline in infections among a cohort of individuals aged under 16 years, who are unvaccinated. On average, for each 20 percentage points of individuals who are vaccinated in a given population, the positive test fraction for the unvaccinated population decreased approximately twofold. These results provide observational evidence that vaccination not only protects individuals who have been vaccinated but also provides cross-protection to unvaccinated individuals in the community. New data from a large healthcare organization in Israel reveal a reduction in new infections in an unvaccinated population in communities with rapid vaccination rollouts, suggesting that mass vaccination strategies confer cross-protection of unvaccinated individuals."

However, these theories are often difficult to distinguish from each other and offer limited improvement in accounting for patterns in decision-making over earlier theories. Peterson et al. leverage machine learning to evaluate classical decision theories, increase their predictive power, and generate new theories of decision-making (see the Perspective by Bhatia and He). This method has implications for theory generation in other domains. Science , abe2629, this issue p. 1209 ; see also abi7668, p. 1150"
https://openalex.org/W3172646184,"How eukaryotic cells assess and maintain sizes specific for their species and cell type remains unclear. We show that in the Arabidopsis shoot stem cell niche, cell size variability caused by asymmetric divisions is corrected by adjusting the growth period before DNA synthesis. KIP-related protein 4 (KRP4) inhibits progression to DNA synthesis and associates with mitotic chromosomes. The F BOX-LIKE 17 (FBL17) protein removes excess KRP4. Consequently, daughter cells are born with comparable amounts of KRP4. Inhibitor dilution models predicted that KRP4 inherited through chromatin would robustly regulate size, whereas inheritance of excess free KRP4 would disrupt size homeostasis, as confirmed by mutant analyses. We propose that a cell cycle regulator, stabilized by association with mitotic chromosomes, reads DNA content as a cell size-independent scale."
https://openalex.org/W3117661772,"The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 has become a global pandemic in a very short time span. Currently, there is no specific treatment or vaccine to counter this highly contagious disease. There is an urgent need to find a specific cure for the disease and global efforts are directed at developing SARS-CoV-2 specific antivirals and immunomodulators. Ayurvedic Rasayana therapy has been traditionally used in India for its immunomodulatory and adaptogenic effects, and more recently has been included as therapeutic adjuvant for several maladies. Amongst several others, Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha), Tinospora cordifolia (Guduchi) and Asparagus racemosus (Shatavari) play an important role in Rasayana therapy. The objective of this study was to explore the immunomodulatory and anti SARS-CoV2 potential of phytoconstituents from Ashwagandha, Guduchi and Shatavari using network pharmacology and docking. The plant extracts were prepared as per ayurvedic procedures and a total of 31 phytoconstituents were identified using UHPLC-PDA and mass spectrometry studies. To assess the immunomodulatory potential of these phytoconstituents an in-silico network pharmacology model was constructed. The model predicts that the phytoconstituents possess the potential to modulate several targets in immune pathways potentially providing a protective role. To explore if these phytoconstituents also possess antiviral activity, docking was performed with the Spike protein, Main Protease and RNA dependent RNA polymerase of the virus. Interestingly, several phytoconstituents are predicted to possess good affinity for the three targets, suggesting their application for the termination of viral life cycle. Further, predictive tools indicate that there would not be adverse herb-drug pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic interactions with concomitantly administered drug therapy. We thus make a compelling case to evaluate the potential of these Rasayana botanicals as therapeutic adjuvants in the management of COVID-19 following rigorous experimental validation."
https://openalex.org/W3171076461,"Viruses are ubiquitous pathogens of global impact. Prompted by the hypothesis that their earliest progenitors recruited host proteins for virion formation, we have used stringent laboratory evolution to convert a bacterial enzyme that lacks affinity for nucleic acids into an artificial nucleocapsid that efficiently packages and protects multiple copies of its own encoding messenger RNA. Revealing remarkable convergence on the molecular hallmarks of natural viruses, the accompanying changes reorganized the protein building blocks into an interlaced 240-subunit icosahedral capsid that is impermeable to nucleases, and emergence of a robust RNA stem-loop packaging cassette ensured high encapsidation yields and specificity. In addition to evincing a plausible evolutionary pathway for primordial viruses, these findings highlight practical strategies for developing nonviral carriers for diverse vaccine and delivery applications."
https://openalex.org/W3172623273,"Estimating resilience in complex systems Resilience is an important concept in the study of critical transitions and tipping points in complex systems and is defined by the size of the disturbance that a system can endure before tipping into an alternative stable state. Nevertheless, resilience has proved resistant to measurement. Arani et al. show how the mathematical concept of mean exit time, the time it takes for a system to cross a threshold, can help to solve this problem and characterize the resilience of complex systems. They derived a model approach to estimate exit time from time series data and applied it to examples from a grazed plant population model, lake cyanobacterial data, and Pleistocene-Holocene climate data. This approach may improve our understanding of the dynamical properties of complex systems under threat. Science , aay4895, this issue p. eaay4895"
https://openalex.org/W3172488186,"Imaging polariton dynamics Two-dimensional (2D) materials can confine light to volumes much shorter than the wavelength, and, together, the long propagation lengths make them attractive materials for developing nanophotonic platforms. Characterizing the spatiotemporal control of 2D polariton wave packets has been hindered for the same reasons that make their potential applications exciting: They have extremely small wavelengths and are strongly confined inside the material. Kurman et al. developed a new pump-probe technique based on electron emission that provides access to the spatiotemporal dynamics of 2D polaritons. The nanometric spatial resolution and femtosecond temporal resolution will be useful for probing the excitation dynamics of these materials. Science , abg9015, this issue p. 1181"

Exactly where each stem cell is positioned can determine what type of neurons it generates. Delgado et al. show that neural stem cells are also choosy about what sorts of glia they make and when (see the Perspective by Baldwin and Silver). Injury or selective deletion of platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ) from the stem cells kicked them into overdrive and revealed their selectivity with respect to gliogenesis. An unusual type of glial progenitor cell, intraventricular oligodendrocyte progenitors, are found nestled between the cilia of ependymal cells derived from tight clusters of PDGFRβ-expressing stem cells.

https://openalex.org/W3166089476,"X-inactive specific transcript (Xist) RNA directs the process of X chromosome inactivation in mammals by spreading in cis along the chromosome from which it is transcribed and recruiting chromatin modifiers to silence gene transcription. To elucidate mechanisms of Xist RNA cis-confinement, we established a sequential dual-color labeling, super-resolution imaging approach to trace individual Xist RNA molecules over time, which enabled us to define fundamental parameters of spreading. We demonstrate a feedback mechanism linking Xist RNA synthesis and degradation and an unexpected physical coupling between preceding and newly synthesized Xist RNA molecules. Additionally, we find that the protein SPEN, a key factor for Xist-mediated gene silencing, has a distinct function in Xist RNA localization, stability, and coupling behaviors. Our results provide insights toward understanding the distinct dynamic properties of Xist RNA."
https://openalex.org/W3168160256,"With the COVID-19 pandemic still raging and the vaccination program still rolling out, there continues to be an immediate need for public health officials to better understand the mechanisms behind the deep and perpetual divide over face masks in America. Using a random sample of Americans ( N = 615), following a pre-registered experimental design and analysis plan, we first demonstrated that mask wearers were not innately more cooperative as individuals than non-mask wearers in the Prisoners’ Dilemma (PD) game when information about their own and the other person’s mask usage was not salient. However, we found strong evidence of in-group favouritism among both mask and non-mask wearers when information about the other partner’s mask usage was known. Non-mask wearers were 23 percentage points less likely to cooperate than mask wearers when facing a mask-wearing partner, and 26 percentage points more likely to cooperate than mask wearers when facing a non-mask-wearing partner. Our analysis suggests social identity effects as the primary reason behind people’s decision whether to wear face masks during the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3166188114,"Hedgehog proteins govern crucial developmental steps in animals and drive certain human cancers. Before they can function as signaling molecules, Hedgehog precursor proteins must undergo amino-terminal palmitoylation by Hedgehog acyltransferase (HHAT). We present cryo-electron microscopy structures of human HHAT in complex with its palmitoyl-coenzyme A substrate and of a product complex with a palmitoylated Hedgehog peptide at resolutions of 2.7 and 3.2 angstroms, respectively. The structures reveal how HHAT overcomes the challenges of bringing together substrates that have different physiochemical properties from opposite sides of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane within a membrane-embedded active site for catalysis. These principles are relevant to related enzymes that catalyze the acylation of Wnt and of the appetite-stimulating hormone ghrelin. The structural and mechanistic insights may advance the development of inhibitors for cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3168222379,"Objective Some researchers have studied about early prediction and diagnosis of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), but their accuracies were not high. Therefore, this paper proposes a soft voting ensemble classifier (SVE) using machine learning (ML) algorithms. Methods We used the Korea Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry dataset and selected 11,189 subjects among 13,104 with the 2-year follow-up. It was subdivided into two groups (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction NSTEMI), and then subdivided into training (70%) and test dataset (30%). Third, we selected the ranges of hyper-parameters to find the best prediction model from random forest (RF), extra tree (ET), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and SVE. We generated each ML-based model with the best hyper-parameters, evaluated by 5-fold stratified cross-validation, and then verified by test dataset. Lastly, we compared the performance in the area under the ROC curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score. Results The accuracies for RF, ET, GBM, and SVE were (88.85%, 88.94%, 87.84%, 90.93% ) for complete dataset, (84.81%, 85.00%, 83.70%, 89.07% ) STEMI, (88.81%, 88.05%, 91.23%, 91.38% ) NSTEMI. The AUC values in RF were (98.96%, 98.15%, 98.81%), ET (99.54%, 99.02%, 99.00%), GBM (98.92%, 99.33%, 99.41%), and SVE ( 99.61% , 99.49% , 99.42% ) for complete dataset, STEMI, and NSTEMI, respectively. Consequently, the accuracy and AUC in SVE outperformed other ML models. Conclusions The performance of our SVE was significantly higher than other machine learning models (RF, ET, GBM) and its major prognostic factors were different. This paper will lead to the development of early risk prediction and diagnosis tool of MACE in ACS patients."
https://openalex.org/W3171968441,"Fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) has rapidly spread in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and has emerged as a major pest of maize and sorghum in the continent. For effective monitoring and a better understanding of the bioecology and management of this pest, a Community-based Fall Armyworm Monitoring, Forecasting, Early Warning and Management (CBFAMFEW) initiative was implemented in six eastern African countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi). Over 650 Community Focal Persons (CFPs) who received training through the project were involved in data collection on adult moths, crop phenology, cropping systems, FAW management practices and other variables. Data collection was performed using Fall Armyworm Monitoring and Early Warning System (FAMEWS), a mobile application developed by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. Data collected from the CBFAMFEW initiative in East Africa and other FAW monitoring efforts in Africa were merged and analysed to determine the factors that are related to FAW population dynamics. We used the negative binomial models to test for effect of main crops type, cropping systems and crop phenology on abundance of FAW. We also analysed the effect of rainfall and the spatial and temporal distribution of FAW populations. The study showed variability across the region in terms of the proportion of main crops, cropping systems, diversity of crops used in rotation, and control methods that impact on trap and larval counts. Intercropping and crop rotation had incident rate 2-times and 3-times higher relative to seasonal cropping, respectively. The abundance of FAW adult and larval infestation significantly varied with crop phenology, with infestation being high at the vegetative and reproductive stages of the crop, and low at maturity stage. This study provides an understanding on FAW bioecology, which could be vital in guiding the deployment of FAW-IPM tools in specific locations and at a specific crop developmental stage. The outcomes demonstrate the relevance of community-based crop pest monitoring for awareness creation among smallholder farmers in SSA."
https://openalex.org/W3172162326,"Sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum) is an economically important allotetraploid (2n = 4x = 48) herb whose global production is threatened by downy mildew disease caused by the obligate biotrophic oomycete, Peronospora belbahrii. Generation of disease resistant cultivars by mutagenesis of susceptibility (S) genes via CRISPR/Cas9 is currently one of the most promising strategies to maintain favored traits while improving disease resistance. Previous studies have identified Arabidopsis DMR6 (Downy Mildew Resistance 6) as an S gene required for pathogenesis of the downy mildew-causing oomycete pathogen Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis. In this study, a sweet basil homolog of DMR6, designated ObDMR6, was identified in the popular sweet basil cultivar Genoveser and found to exist with a high copy number in the genome with polymorphisms among the variants. Two CRISPR/Cas9 constructs expressing one or two single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting the conserved regions of ObDMR6 variants were generated and used to transform Genoveser via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. 56 T0 lines were generated, and mutations of ObDMR6 were detected by analyzing the Sanger sequencing chromatograms of an ObDMR6 fragment using the Interference of CRISPR Edits (ICE) software. Among 54 lines containing mutations in the targeted sites, 13 had an indel percentage greater than 96% suggesting a near-complete knockout (KO) of ObDMR6. Three representative transgene-free lines with near-complete KO of ObDMR6 determined by ICE were identified in the T1 segregating populations derived from three independent T0 lines. The mutations were further confirmed using amplicon deep sequencing. Disease assays conducted on T2 seedlings of the above T1 lines showed a reduction in production of sporangia by 61-68% compared to the wild-type plants and 69-93% reduction in relative pathogen biomass determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR). This study not only has generated transgene-free sweet basil varieties with improved downy mildew resistance, but also contributed to our understanding of the molecular interactions of sweet basil-P. belbahrii."
https://openalex.org/W3169500233,"Standardized collection of predictors of pediatric sepsis has enormous potential to increase data compatibility across research studies. The Pediatric Sepsis Predictor Standardization Working Group collaborated to define common data elements for pediatric sepsis predictors at the point of triage to serve as a standardized framework for data collection in resource-limited settings.A preliminary list of pediatric sepsis predictor variables was compiled through a systematic literature review and examination of global guideline documents. A 5-round modified Delphi that involved independent voting and active group discussions was conducted to select, standardize, and prioritize predictors. Considerations included the perceived predictive value of the candidate predictor at the point of triage, intra- and inter-rater measurement reliability, and the amount of time and material resources required to reliably collect the predictor in resource-limited settings.We generated 116 common data elements for implementation in future studies. Each common data element includes a standardized prompt, suggested response values, and prioritization as tier 1 (essential), tier 2 (important), or tier 3 (exploratory). Branching logic was added to the predictors list to facilitate the design of efficient data collection methods, such as low-cost electronic case report forms on a mobile application. The set of common data elements are freely available on the Pediatric Sepsis CoLab Dataverse and a web-based feedback survey is available through the Pediatric Sepsis CoLab. Updated iterations will continuously be released based on feedback from the pediatric sepsis research community and emergence of new information.Routine use of the common data elements in future studies can allow data sharing between studies and contribute to development of powerful risk prediction algorithms. These algorithms may then be used to support clinical decision making at triage in resource-limited settings. Continued collaboration, engagement, and feedback from the pediatric sepsis research community will be important to ensure the common data elements remain applicable across a broad range of geographical and sociocultural settings."
https://openalex.org/W3117168932,"The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has spread into a pandemic since its emergence in Wuhan, China in December of 2019. This has been facilitated by its high transmissibility within the human population and its ability to remain viable on inanimate surfaces for an extended period. To address the latter, we examined the effect of simulated sunlight on the viability of SARS-CoV-2 spiked into tissue culture medium or mucus. The study revealed that inactivation took 37 minutes in medium and 107 minutes in mucus. These times-to-inactivation were unexpected since they are longer than have been observed in other studies. From this work, we demonstrate that sunlight represents an effective decontamination method but the speed of decontamination is variable based on the underlying matrix. This information has an important impact on the development of infection prevention and control protocols to reduce the spread of this deadly pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W3169010583,"The societal norm in India is such that adolescents are expected to respect and follow traditional values and view early sexual debut as undesirable and deviant from the social mores. However, a dramatic shift in attitudes towards sex before marriage has been observed in India. We in this study, aim to study the factors associated with early sexual debut among unmarried adolescents.The study used data from the Understanding the lives of adolescents and young adults (UDAYA) survey conducted in 2016 with 15,388 adolescents aged 10-19 years from two Indian states. Bivariate and logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the associated factors.Adolescent boys (9%) were more prone to early sexual debut compared to girls (4%). Both boys (17.2%) and girls (6%) who were school dropouts had significantly higher chances of early sexual debut. Boys who had rare [OR: 2.28; CI: 1.12-4.64] or frequent media exposure [OR: 2.70; CI: 1.36-5.32] were significantly more likely to report early sexual debut than those who had no media exposure. Further, the likelihood of early sexual debut was significantly higher among boys [OR: 3.01; CI: 2.34-3.87] and girls [OR: 1.87; CI: 1.12-3.12] who had exposure to pornography compared to their counterparts. The odds of early sexual debut were higher among boys [OR: 1.89; CI: 1.19-3.01] and girls [OR: 1.77; CI: 1.30-2.41] who had moderately-severe/severe depressive symptoms compared to their counterparts.The results highlight that Indian unmarried adolescents demand the appropriate knowledge to promote safer sexual behavior and lead a responsible and healthy lifestyle. The preventive efforts must be multifaceted with involvement at the individual and parental levels. Especially, interventions appear advantageous to be parents-focused emphasizing family life education that can prevent risky sexual behaviors among adolescent boys and girls. And the public programs should focus on sexual health promotion considering the physical and psychosocial changes during early ages of sex life."

https://openalex.org/W3172627911,"The Hippo pathway is an evolutionarily conserved kinase cascade involved in the control of tissue homeostasis, cellular differentiation, proliferation, and organ size, and is regulated by cell-cell contact, apical cell polarity, and mechanical signals. Miss-regulation of this pathway can lead to cancer. The Hippo pathway acts through the inhibition of the transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ through phosphorylation. Among the various signaling mechanisms controlling the hippo pathway, activation of G12/13 by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) recently emerged. Here we show that a GPCR, the ghrelin receptor, that activates several types of G proteins, including G12/13, Gi/o, and Gq, can activate YAP through Gq/11 exclusively, independently of G12/13. We revealed that a strong basal YAP activation results from the high constitutive activity of this receptor, which can be further increased upon agonist activation. Thus, acting on ghrelin receptor allowed to modulate up-and-down YAP activity, as activating the receptor increased YAP activity and blocking constitutive activity reduced YAP activity. Our results demonstrate that GPCRs can be used as molecular switches to finely up- or down-regulate YAP activity through a pure Gq pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3169290569,"Fast and accurate taxonomic identification of invasive trans-located ladybird beetle species is essential to prevent significant impacts on biological communities, ecosystem functions, and agricultural business economics. Therefore, in this work we propose a two-step automatic detector for ladybird beetles in random environment images as the first stage towards an automated classification system. First, an image processing module composed of a saliency map representation, simple linear iterative clustering superpixels segmentation, and active contour methods allowed us to generate bounding boxes with possible ladybird beetles locations within an image. Subsequently, a deep convolutional neural network-based classifier selects only the bounding boxes with ladybird beetles as the final output. This method was validated on a 2, 300 ladybird beetle image data set from Ecuador and Colombia obtained from the iNaturalist project. The proposed approach achieved an accuracy score of 92% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.977 for the bounding box generation and classification tasks. These successful results enable the proposed detector as a valuable tool for helping specialists in the ladybird beetle detection problem."

A buffer with the ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 at the time of sample collection could simplify and expand testing for COVID-19 to non-conventional settings. Methods We evaluated a guanidium thiocyanate-based buffer, eNAT ™ (Copan) as a possible transport and inactivation medium for downstream Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing to detect SARS-CoV-2. Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 in eNAT and in diluted saliva was studied at different incubation times. The stability of viral RNA in eNAT was also evaluated for up to 7 days at room temperature (28°C), refrigerated conditions (4°C) and at 35°C. Results SARS-COV-2 virus spiked directly in eNAT could be inactivated at &gt;5.6 log 10 PFU/ml within a minute of incubation. When saliva was diluted 1:1 in eNAT, no cytopathic effect (CPE) on VeroE6 cells was observed, although SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected even after 30 min incubation and after two cell culture passages. A 1:2 (saliva:eNAT) dilution abrogated both CPE and detectable viral RNA after as little as 5 min incubation in eNAT. SARS-CoV-2 RNA from virus spiked at 5X the limit of detection remained positive up to 7 days of incubation in all tested conditions. Conclusion eNAT and similar guanidinium thiocyanate-based media may be of value for transport, stabilization, and processing of clinical samples for RT-PCR based SARS-CoV-2 detection."
https://openalex.org/W3171207083,"The core competencies in disaster nursing, nurses’ roles in disaster management and the potential barriers are assessed with a view to developing disaster nursing in Slovenia. Despite training and experience, many indicators show nurses are deficient in skills involving emergency and disaster-preparedness competencies. Nurses report little familiarity with disaster-planning skills, the implementation of disaster guidelines and assessment of patients subject to a disaster circumstance. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted based on data collected through an online survey. 118 registered nurses from different clinical settings in Slovenia participated in the study. Data were collected according to the Slovenian version of the Disaster Nursing Core Competencies Scale (Sl-DNCC-Scale). The scale was limited to a 7-point Likert response format (from 1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree). The results show the registered nurses perceive the core competencies of disaster nursing to be important to their preparedness for disaster situations (median = 161; range 74–189). Registered nurses who work in nursing homes and nurse managers are more aware of the importance of acquiring the listed competencies for unexpected events (p = 0.011 and 0.060 respectively) and the importance of their active role in disaster management (p = 0.027 and p = 0.004, respectively). To effectively deal with a disaster, nurses must be well prepared for unexpected events and more actively involved in disaster management. This study demonstrates that nurses regard the core disaster nursing competencies as important and greatly needed in various healthcare facilities. Future studies in this area should focus on ways to implement these competencies in nursing education."

Relative to the mild disease cohort, the moderate and severe disease cohorts also demonstrated significantly increased risk of developing AKI (66%, 85%), both with p values of P = 0.0001.Clinically severe SARS-CoV 2 infection is associated with greater risk of acute kidney injury and greater decline in renal allograft function at 90 days post infection, compared to mild disease."
https://openalex.org/W3168869477,"Caenorhabditis elegans has emerged as a powerful model organism for drug screening due to its cellular simplicity, genetic amenability and homology to humans combined with its small size and low cost. Currently, high-throughput drug screening assays are mostly based on image-based phenotyping with the focus on morphological-descriptive traits not exploiting key locomotory parameters of this multicellular model with muscles such as its thrashing force, a critical biophysical parameter when screening drugs for muscle-related diseases. In this study, we demonstrated the use of a micropillar-based force assay chip in combination with a fluorescence assay to evaluate the efficacy of various drugs currently used in treatment of neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases. Using this two-dimensional approach, we showed that the force assay was generally more sensitive in measuring efficacy of drug treatment in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and Parkinson's Disease mutant worms as well as partly in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis model. These results underline the potential of our force assay chip in screening of potential drug candidates for the treatment of neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases when combined with a fluorescence assay in a two-dimensional analysis approach."

https://openalex.org/W3168713392,"The Brazilian lancehead (Bothrops moojeni) has a wide distribution in Brazil and represents a serious public health hazard. Previous works reported that the symptoms of snakebites caused by B. moojeni juveniles' bites were mainly related to coagulation, while those caused by adults' bites had a more prominent local damage. In this work, we analyzed the venoms of B. moojeni at different life stages to better understand the ontogeny shift in this species. Snakes were grouped by age and sex, and venom pools were formed accordingly. Compositional analyses by one-dimensional electrophoresis (1-DE), chromatography, and mass spectrometry revealed that ontogenetic changes might be mostly related to phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and metalloproteases. Regarding the venoms functional aspect, proteolytic, L-amino acid oxidase, PLA2, and coagulant in vitro activities were assayed, but only the first and the last ones showed age-related changes, with the venom of snakes up to 1 year-old displaying lower proteolytic and higher coagulant activities, while those from 2 years-old onward presented the opposite relation. The venoms of 3 years-old snakes were exceptions to the compositional and functional pattern of adults as both venoms presented profiles similar to neonates. Sex-related differences were observed in specific groups and were not age-related. In vivo experiments (median lethal dose and hemorrhagic activity) were statistically similar between neonates and adults, however we verified that the adult venom killed mice faster comparing to the neonates. All venoms were mostly recognized by the antibothropic serum and displayed similar profiles to 1-DE in western blotting. In conclusion, the Brazilian lancehead venom showed ontogenetic shift in its composition and activities. Furthermore, this change occurred in snakes from 1 to 2 years-old, and interestingly the venom pools from 3 years-old snakes had particular characteristics, which highlights the importance of comprehensive studies to better understand venom variability."
https://openalex.org/W3169597299,"Rickettsioses are neglected and emerging potentially fatal febrile diseases that are caused by obligate intracellular bacteria, rickettsiae. Rickettsia (R.) typhi and R. prowazekii constitute the typhus group (TG) of rickettsiae and are the causative agents of endemic and epidemic typhus, respectively. We recently generated a monoclonal antibody (BNI52) against R. typhi. Characterization of BNI52 revealed that it specifically recognizes TG rickettsiae but not the members of the spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae. We further show that BNI52 binds to protein fragments of ±30 kDa that are exposed on the bacterial surface and also present in the periplasmic space. These protein fragments apparently derive from the cytosolic GroEL protein of R. typhi and are also recognized by antibodies in the sera from patients and infected mice. Furthermore, BNI52 opsonizes the bacteria for the uptake by antigen presenting cells (APC), indicating a contribution of GroEL-specific antibodies to protective immunity. Finally, it is interesting that the GroEL protein belongs to 32 proteins that are differentially downregulated by R. typhi after passage through immunodeficient BALB/c CB17 SCID mice. This could be a hint that the rickettsia GroEL protein may have immunomodulatory properties as shown for the homologous protein from several other bacteria, too. Overall, the results of this study provide evidence that GroEL represents an immunodominant antigen of TG rickettsiae that is recognized by the humoral immune response against these pathogens and that may be interesting as a vaccine candidate. Apart from that, the BNI52 antibody represents a new tool for specific detection of TG rickettsiae in various diagnostic and experimental setups."
https://openalex.org/W3172887089,"Skeletal muscle mass loss has been associated with decreased physical performance; however, the body composition characteristics in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are not well understood. We investigated body composition parameters, focusing on skeletal muscle mass, in patients with PSP and compared them with those of healthy older adults.This retrospective cross-sectional study included 39 patients with PSP and 30 healthy older adults (control group). Using a multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis, we measured the skeletal mass index (SMI), basal metabolism, extracellular water/total body water ratio (ECW/TBW), and body fat percentage and examined the relationship between SMI and age, body mass index (BMI) and other body composition parameters.The PSP group had a higher rate of low muscle mass (56.4%) than the control group (10.0%), although the ages and BMIs were similar. The leg SMI was lower for the PSP group, while the ECW/TBW was higher for the PSP group. The basal metabolism was lower for the PSP group than for the controls but only in the women. The basal metabolism and BMI showed a significant correlation with SMI in the PSP group. There was a significant correlation between SMI and age, ECW/TBW, and body fat percentage in the PSP group but only in the women.This study is the first to show that a high proportion of patients with PSP have low muscle mass. We showed differences in terms of sex in muscle mass loss in women with PSP, which was associated with inactivity and aging."
https://openalex.org/W3168083033,"The ratings of physician-patient communication are an important indicator of the quality of health care delivery and provide guidance for many important decisions in the health care setting and in health research. But there is no gold standard to assess physician-patient communication. Thus, depending on the specific measurement condition, multiple sources of variance may contribute to the total score variance of ratings of physician-patient communication. This may systematically impair the validity of conclusions drawn from rating data.To examine the extent to which different measurement conditions and rater perspectives, respectively contribute to the variance of physician-patient communication ratings.Variance components of ratings of physician-patient communication gained from 32 general practitioners and 252 patients from 25 family practices in Germany were analyzed using generalizability theory. The communication dimensions ""shared decision making"", ""effective and open communication"" and ""satisfaction"" were considered.Physician-patient communication ratings most substantially reflect unique rater-perspective and communication dimension combinations (32.7% interaction effect). The ratings also represented unique physician and rater-perspective combinations (16.3% interaction effect). However, physicians' communication behavior and the observed communication dimensions revealed only a low extent of score variance (1% physician effect; 3.7% communication dimension effect). Approximately half of the variance remained unexplained (46.2% three-way interaction, confounded with error).The ratings of physician-patient communication minimally reflect physician communication skills in general. Instead, these ratings exhibit primarily differences among physicians and patients in their tendency to perceive shared decision making and effective and open communication and to be satisfied with communication, regardless of the communication behavior of physicians. Rater training and assessing low inferential ratings of physician-patient communication dimensions should be considered when subjective aspects of rater perspectives are not of interest."
https://openalex.org/W3170788016,"Background Men with a newly diagnosed prostate cancer are often treated by surgery. The time window between cancer diagnosis and surgery causes high levels of uncertainty and stress, which negatively impact quality of life (QoL). We previously reported a larger intervention pilot study which demonstrated that participation in a community-based pre-operative exercise programme significantly improved physical fitness and health-related quality of life in men with prostate cancer prior to surgery. The aim of the current pilot study was to get an insight into men’s perceptions of wellbeing and QoL following completion of the pre-operative exercise programme. Methods From November 2017 to June 2018, men scheduled for prostate cancer surgery were recruited and took part in a prescribed community-based pre-operative exercise programme in the time available between referral and surgery. Following completion of the pre-operative exercise programme (within 1 week before surgery), participants took part in one semi-structured interview which explored four broad QoL domains: physical, psychological, social, and spiritual wellbeing. Data were analysed using thematic analysis (a bottom up/inductive analysis). Results Eleven men were recruited: mean standard deviation (SD) age was 60 ± 7 years. Data supported four main themes. Participation in the community-based pre-operative exercise training programme (over a mean (SD) of 4 ± 2 weeks) provided participants with: 1) a teachable moment; 2) a journey of preparation; 3) a sense of optimism; and 4) social connectedness prior to surgery. Conclusion This study provides an insight into how the exercise programme impacted wellbeing and QoL in men preparing for prostate cancer surgery. These findings highlight the important role that exercise prehabilitation plays for men preparing for prostate cancer surgery. Such exercise programmes can be easily implemented into standard cancer pathways by establishing relationships between hospital teams and community exercise programmes."

This study, therefore focuses on social development inequalities among steel industry workers in one development zone (Badami Bagh area and along Sheikhupura road of Lahore) of Pakistan. A total of 225 workers were interviewed randomly following the stratified random sampling technique. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique was used to construct the socioeconomic score (SES) index. Five categories of socioeconomic index were measured using multinomial logistic regression model. A correlation matrix was calculated for PCA. Results revealed that type/size of industry has negative relation while skill level has positive relation with SES. Job status and transport facility did not reflect a significant impact to SES of workers. Correlation matrix depicted that age, experience and medical treatment have positive relation while formal education, number of dependents and distance to job showed a negative trend in relation with SES."
https://openalex.org/W3167861293,"Given the climate crisis and its cumulative impacts on public health, effective communication strategies that engage the public in adaptation and mitigation are critical. Many have argued that a health frame increases engagement, as do visual methodologies including online and interactive platforms, yet to date there has been limited research on audience responses to health messaging using visual interventions. This study explores public attitudes regarding communication tools focused on climate change and climate-affected Lyme disease through six focus groups (n = 61) in rural and urban southern Manitoba, Canada. The results add to the growing evidence of the efficacy of visual and storytelling methods in climate communications and argues for a continuum of mediums: moving from video, text, to maps. Findings underscore the importance of tailoring both communication messages and mediums to increase uptake of adaptive health and environmental behaviours, for some audiences bridging health and climate change while for others strategically decoupling them."
https://openalex.org/W3169291781,"Systemic arterial hypertension (SAH), a global public health problem and the primary risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, has a significant financial impact on health systems. In Brazil, the prevalence of SAH is 23.7%, which caused 203,000 deaths and 3.9 million DALYs in 2015.To estimate the cost of SAH and circulatory system diseases attributable to SAH from the perspective of the Brazilian public health system in 2019.A prevalence-based cost-of-illness was conducted using a top-down approach. The population attributable risk (PAR) was used to estimate the proportion of circulatory system diseases attributable to SAH. The direct medical costs were obtained from official Ministry of Health of Brazil records and literature parameters, including the three levels of care (primary, secondary, and tertiary). Deterministic univariate analyses were also conducted.The total cost of SAH and the proportion of circulatory system diseases attributable to SAH was Int$ 581,135,374.73, varying between Int$ 501,553,022.21 and Int$ 776,183,338.06. In terms only of SAH costs at all healthcare levels (Int$ 493,776,445.89), 97.3% were incurred in primary care, especially for antihypertensive drugs provided free of charge by the Brazilian public health system (Int$ 363,888,540.14). Stroke accounted for the highest cost attributable to SAH and the third highest PAR, representing 47% of the total cost of circulatory diseases attributable to SAH. Prevalence was the parameter that most affected sensitivity analyses, accounting for 36% of all the cost variation.Our results show that the main Brazilian strategy to combat SAH was implemented in primary care, namely access to free antihypertensive drugs and multiprofessional teams, acting jointly to promote care and prevent and control SAH."
https://openalex.org/W3170717106,"The high power of the eye and optical components used to image it result in ""static"" distortion, remaining constant across acquired retinal images. In addition, raster-based systems sample points or lines of the image over time, suffering from ""dynamic"" distortion due to the constant motion of the eye. We recently described an algorithm which corrects for the latter problem but is entirely blind to the former. Here, we describe a new procedure termed ""DIOS"" (Dewarp Image by Oblique Shift) to remove static distortion of arbitrary type. Much like the dynamic correction method, it relies on locating the same tissue in multiple frames acquired as the eye moves through different gaze positions. Here, the resultant maps of pixel displacement are used to form a sparse system of simultaneous linear equations whose solution gives the common warp seen by all frames. We show that the method successfully handles torsional movement of the eye. We also show that the output of the previously described dynamic correction procedure may be used as input for this new procedure, recovering an image of the tissue that is, in principle, a faithful replica free of any type of distortion. The method could be extended beyond ocular imaging, to any kind of imaging system in which the image can move or be made to move across the detector."
https://openalex.org/W3172050856,"Encouraging citizens to use health checkup services is a health promotion strategy. In nations with aging populations, ensuring equitable use of health check-ups by senior citizens is a public health concern. The objective of this research was to quantify income-related inequality and its effect on the use of health checkup services in Taiwan during the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. We used the 2005 and 2009 datasets of the Taiwan National Health Interview Surveys to assess how income-related inequality influenced health check-up use among older adults in Taiwan during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Corrected concentration indices (CCIs) were calculated and decomposed to determine the influences of explanatory variables. The dependent variable was whether participants had used free senior health check-ups in the past year, and the determinant factors were health behavior, health situation, socioeconomic and demographic factors, and area health care resources accessibility factors. The study assessed 2,460 older adults from the 2005 dataset and 2,514 such individuals from the 2009 dataset. The utilization of health check-ups increased from 21.6% in 2005 to 34.0% in 2009. Income-related inequality in the use of health check-up services was generally tilted toward the higher income individuals among both women and men in 2005 and 2009, and income-related inequality decreased among women group and increased among men group with non significantly from 2005 to 2009 (women: CCI decreased from.0738 in 2005 to.0658 in 2009; men: CCI increased from.1068 in 2005 to.1256 in 2009). We analyzed the effect of explanatory factors on men's and women's intention to use health check-ups by using a probit model. After controlling for other factors, we determined that income significantly influenced women's health check-up service use in 2005 and men's in 2005 and 2009. Positive health behavior significantly increased health check-up services use among men and women group after the financial crisis, and negative health behavior significantly reduced health check-ups use among men across financial crisis. The 2008 global financial crisis strengthened the effect on health check-ups use of income-related inequality of elderly men, especially in older adults with negative health behaviors. Elderly men with negative health behaviors tended to contribute more income-related inequality in use health check-up services after the financial crisis. Health promotion initiatives should focus their efforts on elderly men with negative health behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W3173059636,"The objective of this work was to analyze the structural changes of the pancreatic islets in rats, after 6 month consuming regular and light cola for 6 months. Also, we have analyzed the possible role of PDX-1 in that process. Finally, with the available knowledge, we propose a general working hypothesis that explains the succession of phenomena observed. Previously, we reported evidence showing that chronic cola consumption in rats impairs pancreatic metabolism of insulin and glucagon and produces some alterations typically observed in the metabolic syndrome, with an increase in oxidative stress. Of note It is worth mentioning that no apoptosis nor proliferation of islet cells could be demonstrated. In the present study, 36 male Wistar rats were divided into three groups to and given free access to freely drink regular cola (C), light cola (L), or water (W, control). We assessed the impact of the three different beverages in on glucose tolerance, lipid levels, creatinine levels and immunohistochemical changes addressed for the expression of insulin, glucagon, PDX-1 and NGN3 in islet cells, to evaluate the possible participation of PDX-1 in the changes observed in α and β cells after 6 months of treatment. Moreover, we assessed by stereological methods, the mean volume of islets (Vi) and three important variables: the fractional β -cell area, the cross-sectional area of alpha (A α-cell) and beta cells (A β-cell), and the number of β and α cell per body weight. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's multiple t-test or by Kruskal-Wallis test, then followed by Dunn's test (depending on distribution). Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. Cola drinking caused impaired glucose tolerance as well as fasting hyperglycemia (mean:148; CI:137-153; p<0.05 vs W) and an increase of in insulin immunolabeling (27.3±19.7; p<0.05 vs W and L). Immunohistochemical expression for PDX-1 was significantly high in C group compared to W (0.79±0.71; p<0.05). In this case, we observed cytoplasmatic and nuclear localization. Likewise, a mild but significant decrease of in Vi was detected after 6 months in C compared to W group (8.2±2.5; p<0.05). Also, we observed a significant decrease of in the fractional β cell area (78.2±30.9; p<0.05) compared to W. Accordingly, a reduced mean value of islet α and β cell number per body weight (0.05±0.02 and 0.08±0.04 respectively; both p<0.05) compared to W was detected. Interestingly, consumption of light cola increased the Vi (10.7±3.6; p<0.05) compared to W. In line with this, a decreased cross-sectional area of β-cells was observed after chronic consumption of both, regular (78.2±30.9; p<0.05) and light cola (110.5±24.3; p<0.05), compared to W. As for, NGN3, it was negative in all three groups. Our results support the idea that PDX-1 plays a key role in the dynamics of the pancreatic islets after chronic consumption of sweetened beverages. In this experimental model, the loss of islets cells might be attributed to autophagy, favored by the local metabolic conditions and oxidative stress."

Sixty-eight college students (32 males, 36 females; age: 23.65 ± 3.21 years old; weight: 69.98 ± 8.15 kg; height: 1.74 ± 0.08 m) were enrolled in the study. Ground reaction forces and moments were collected using two force platforms. The participants completed three trials under each of the following random conditions: no-load (NL), waist uniformly distributed load (WUD), shoulder uniformly distributed load (SUD), waist stance foot load (WST), shoulder stance foot load (SST), waist swing foot load (WSW), and shoulder swing foot load (SSW). The paired Hotelling's T-square test was used to compare the experimental conditions. The center of pressure (COP) time series were significantly different for the SUD vs. NL, SST vs. NL, WST vs. NL, and WSW vs. NL comparisons. Significant differences in COP time series were observed for all comparisons between waist vs. shoulder conditions. Overall, these differences were greater when the load was positioned at the shoulders. For the center of mass (COM) time series, significant differences were found for the WUD vs. NL and WSW vs. NL conditions. However, no differences were observed with the load positioned at the shoulders. In conclusion, only asymmetrical loading at the waist produced significant differences, and the higher the extra load, the greater the effects on COP behavior. By contrast, only minor changes were observed in COM behavior, suggesting that the changes in COP (the controller) behavior are adjustments to maintain the COM (controlled object) unaltered."

To test this, we activated the olfactory bulbs with blue light in mice expressing channelrhodopsin in the olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and assessed the relevance of stimulus duration on olfactory perception using foot shock associated active avoidance behavioral task on a ""two-arms maze"". Our behavior data demonstrate that the stimulus duration plays an important role in olfactory perception and the associated behavioral responses."
