https://openalex.org/W1600871831,"A new miniaturized protein and peptide sequenator has been constructed which uses gas phase reagents at the coupling and cleavage steps of the Edman degradation. The sample is embedded in a matrix of Polybrene dried onto a porous glass fiber disc located in a small cartridge-style reaction cell. The protein or peptide, though not covalently attached to the support, is essentially immobile throughout the degradative cycle, since only relatively apolar, liquid phase solvents pass through the cell. This instrument can give useful sequence data on as little as 5 pmol or protein, can perform extended sequence runs (greater than 30 residues) on subnanomole quantities of proteins purified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and can sequence hydrophobic peptides to completion. The sequenator is characterized by a high repetitive yield during the degradation, low reagent consumption, low maintenance requirements, and a degradative cycle time of only 50 min using a complete double cleavage program."

Developmental feminization of males is associated with inability to breed as adults and may explain the highly skewed sex ratio and reduced number of male gulls breeding on Santa Barbara Island in southern California."
https://openalex.org/W1524114939,"Rat and human alpha 1-acid glycoproteins contain 5 and 6 acidic asparagine-linked sugar chains in 1 molecule, respectively. The structures of these sugar chains were studied by sequential exoglycosidase digestion in combination with methylation analysis after being released from the polypeptide back bone by hydrazinolysis. All oligosaccharides obtained from both glycoproteins contain N-acetylneuraminic acid. Sialidase digestion of the acidic oligosaccharides from rat sample released three biantennary complex type sugar chains and three triantennary complex type sugar chains, the outer chains of which are composed of Gal beta 1 leads to 3GlcNAc and/or Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc. In the original acidic oligosaccharides, sialic acids occur as three type linkages: NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 3Gal, NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6Gal, and Gal beta 1 leads to 3(NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6)GlcNAc. In addition to the five sugar chains reported by Fournet, B., Montreuil, J., Strecker, G., Dorland, L., Haverkamp, J., Vilegenthart, J. F. G., Binette, J. P., and Schmid, K. ((1978) Biochemistry 17, 5206-5214), the structures of three new sugar chains of human alpha 1-acid glycoprotein were elucidated."

https://openalex.org/W1483256491,"Aortic proteoglycans (PG) were isolated from human aorta intima-media preparations with 4 M guanidine hydrochloride in the presence of protease inhibitors. The extracted PG mixture comprised 67% of the total aortic PG and was composed of 65% chondroitin sulfate, 22% dermatan sulfate, 8% heparan sulfate, and 4% hyaluronate. Attempts at isolation and purification of PG monomers using isopycnic CsCl gradient centrifugation under associative and dissociative conditions resulted in appreciable loss of PG through associations with co-extracted aortic proteins. The addition of a gel chromatographic step on Sepharose CL-4B under dissociative conditions resulted in separation of PG from the majority of co-extracted proteins. In addition, the procedure resulted in a separation of the PG into a population (PG-I) eluting near the column V0 and one (PG-II) included with a Kav of 0.38. Hyaluronic acid co-eluted with PG-I. The major glycosaminoglycan in PG-I was chondroitin sulfate, (85 to 95%). No dermatan sulfate was detected in PG-I, but this glycosaminoglycan was the predominant glycosaminoglycan in PG-II (50 to 70%). Heparan sulfate was present in small amounts in both PG-I and PG-II. Data presented support the proposal of at least three species of PG monomers in the aortic wall. Chromatographic studies under dissociative and associative conditions indicated that PG comprising PG-I but not PG-II were capable of associations with hyaluronic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1511658123,"The interactions of a chondroitin sulfate-dermatan sulfate proteoglycan with serum very low (VLDL), low (LDL), and high density (HDL3) lipoproteins were studied with special reference to the nature of the interaction of LDL and the proteoglycan. The proteoglycan formed insoluble complexes with VLDL and LDL, but no complex was formed with HDL3. The proteoglycan (40 micrograms/ml) converted 98% of added LDL (150 micrograms of cholesterol/ml) into insoluble complex at a Ca2+ concentration of 30 mM. Physiologic concentrations of albumin inhibited insoluble complex formation with VLDL and LDL by 61.5 and 40.7%, respectively. The proteoglycan formed soluble complexes with LDL even in the absence of Ca2+. Optimum soluble complex formation occurred when the medium contained 66.6 micrograms of proteoglycan and 166.6 micrograms of LDL cholesterol/ml. Specific modifications of the lysine and/or arginine residues of LDL prevented complex formation with the proteoglycan, thus indicating the requirement of the positive charges of the protein moiety of LDL in the interaction. Removal of the protein core or the glycosaminoglycan chains of the proteoglycan prevented interaction with LDL. Desulfation of the proteoglycan molecule also inhibited complex formation with LDL. Thus, the native state of the arterial proteoglycan molecule confers optimum charge density for specific interaction with serum apoprotein B-containing lipoproteins."

(1978) 91, 533-544) in rat liver, one in mitochondria and another one in peroxisomes. 2. Treatment of rats with clofibrate increases the activities of the 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductases in both cell organelles. 3. Isolated peroxisomes metabolize 4-cis-decenoyl-CoA, a metabolite of linoleic acid, via the 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase pathway. 4. From these results it is concluded that peroxisomes have the enzymatic apparatus necessary for the degradation of unsaturated fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W1503596186,"The four subunits (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) of the acetylcholine receptor from Torpedo californica have been isolated by preparative gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. After removal of the sodium dodecyl sulfate by dialysis of the polypeptides against a cholate-containing buffer, the alpha subunit, but not the other chains, binds 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin in a saturable manner. The binding affinity, 0.1-0.2 microM, is approximately 10(4)-fold lower than that observed for native acetylcholine receptor. For three preparations of alpha subunit, 1 mol of subunit bound 0.87, 0.38, and 0.33 mol of 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin at saturation. The binding was inhibited by cholinergic ligands, although the apparent affinities of these ligands for alpha were 50-100-fold lower than that found for the native receptor. These results indicate that at least part of the alpha-bungarotoxin binding site resides on the alpha subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1562576059,"After incubating cultured chondrocytes from the Swarm rat chondrosarcoma for 30 min with [3H]serine, a labeled macromolecule was found predominantly as Mr = approximately 370,000 species which was subsequently identified as a core protein precursor to cartilage proteoglycan from the following properties: (a) it was immunoprecipitated along with completed proteoglycan from cell extracts by an antiserum to the complex of hyaluronic acid-binding region, link protein, and hyaluronic acid. Its immunoprecipitation could be inhibited completely by the addition of purified hyaluronic acid-binding region to the extracts, indicating the presence of common antigenic determinants with this region of the proteoglycan core protein. (b) the core protein precursor was able to interact with the hyaluronic acid and link protein in proteoglycan aggregates added as carrier to extracts to form mixed aggregates of high buoyant density in associative CsCl density gradients. Labeled core protein precursor and link protein were subsequently isolated from the mixed aggregates from the top of dissociative CsCl density gradients. (c) radioactivity in core protein precursor after a 30-min pulse of [3H]serine disappeared after inhibiting further protein synthesis with cycloheximide concurrent with the appearance of label in completed proteoglycan molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1989595044,"Hippocampi of seizure-sensitive and seizure-resistant Mongolian gerbils were examined in search of structural correlates of seizure behavior. In animals with well-established seizure histories, differences were found in both presynaptic and postsynaptic structures. Seizing animals had less dense dendritic spines, a greater proportion of mossy tuft area devoted to presynaptic vesicles, and a smaller proportion devoted to spines. The possible relationship of these findings to epilepsy is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1995159288,"A new technique has been developed for identifying, in humans, dynamic spatiotemporal electrical patterns of the brain during purposive behaviors. In this method, single-trial time-series correlations between brain macropotentials recorded from different scalp sites are analyzed by distribution-independent mathematical pattern recognition. Dynamic patterns of correlation clearly distinguished two brief visuomotor tasks differing only in type of mental judgment required (spatial or numeric). These complex patterns shifted in the anterior-posterior and left-right axes between successive 175-millisecond intervals, indicating that many areas in both cerebral hemispheres were involved even in these simple judgments. These patterns were not obtainable by conventional analysis of averaged evoked potentials or by linear analysis of correlations, suggesting that the new technique will advance the study of human brain activity related to cognition and goal-directed behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W1533297891,"The interaction between spinach ferredoxin and ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase was studied by varying pH and oxidation-reduction state. The Kd of the oxidized ferredoxin . ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase complex increases with increasing pH in the range from pH 6 to pH 8; the Kd is pH-independent above pH 9. These data are interpreted as showing 1 proton binding/complex at neutral pH. The extent of association of the complex was also varied by manipulation of salt concentration, was also varied by manipulation of salt concentration, and of concentration of the individual proteins. Increased association accompanied a negative shift in potential of ferredoxin relative to that of ferredoxin: NADP+ reductase. Oxidation-reduction titrations showed that the oxidation-reduction potential of ferredoxin is reduced to above -510 mV when in complex with ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase, a change of about -90 mV; the potential of ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase is changed little (no more than +20 mV). Conversely, these data also showed that the oxidation-reduction state of ferredoxin strongly affected its association with the flavoprotein, increasing the Kd at least 30-fold on reduction of ferredoxin."
https://openalex.org/W1585200247,"We have used the chick embryonic heart to study the regulation of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor in vivo. Sustained activation of the muscarinic receptor in vivo with the cholinergic agonist carbachol decreases muscarinic receptor number as much as 87% as measured by the specific binding of the potent muscarinic receptor in antagonist [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate. The decrease in receptor number is both dose and time dependent. After carbachol-induced down regulation, the receptor number recovers to control levels when further receptor activation is blocked by the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine. When receptor number is decreased 50% in vivo, isolated atria require a 12-fold greater concentration of carbachol than controls to arrest spontaneous beating in an organ bath. Analysis of the binding of carbachol to the muscarinic receptor indicates that this shift in the dose response of atria is accompanied by a change in the relative fraction of the high and low affinity forms of the muscarinic receptor with no change in their respective affinities for carbachol. In addition, this analysis suggests that the low agonist affinity form of the cardiac muscarinic receptor is the physiologically active form."
https://openalex.org/W1672883562,"17 beta-N,N-Diethylcarbamoyl-4-methyl-4-aza-5 alpha-androstan-3-one (DMAA) is a potent reversible inhibitor of 5 alpha-reductase. The inhibition by DMAA of the conversion of testosterone to 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone by rat prostate 5 alpha-reductase is competitive with testosterone, the apparent Ki being 5 nM, and uncompetitive with NADPH, DMAA inhibited both membrane-bound and solubilized 5 alpha-reductase. DMAA has moderate affinity for the prostate cytosol androgen receptor: 3 X 10(-6) M gives 50% inhibition of the binding of 10(-9) M 5 alpha-[3H]dihydrotestosterone to this receptor. This affinity to the androgen receptor is 1,000-, 500-, 120-, and 40-fold lower than that of 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone, testosterone, spironolactone, and cyproterone acetate, respectively, and 7-fold higher than that of cimetidine. After incubation of [3H]testosterone with minced prostate, more than 90% of the radioactivity extracted from the nuclei co-chromatographed with 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone and the rest with testosterone. DMAA at low concentrations decreased the ratio of 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone to testosterone in the nuclei without significantly reducing the total uptake. DMAA at high concentrations also reduced the total radioactivity in the nuclei. This differential effect may reflect a higher affinity of DMAA for 5 alpha-reductase than for the androgen receptor. When 5 alpha-[3H]dihydrotestosterone was used in the tissue incubations, all radioactivity extracted from nuclei co-chromatographed with 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone, regardless of whether or not DMAA was present. This nuclear uptake of 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone is inhibited only by high concentrations of DMAA. In a cell-free system, the nuclear uptake of 5 alpha-[3H]dihydrotestosterone prebound to the cytosol receptor was not inhibited by DMAA. These results suggest that DMAA may inhibit nuclear uptake of 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone by inhibiting the receptor binding. Sucrose gradient centrifugation of the radioactive KCl nuclear extracts prepared from the tissue incubations showed that the nuclear [3H]testosterone-receptor complex has a greater rate of dissociation than does the nuclear 5 alpha-[3H]dihydrotestosterone-receptor complex. [3H]Testosterone prebound to the prostate cytosol receptor also dissociates faster than 5 alpha-[3H]dihydrotestosterone prebound to the cytosol receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1532668225,"Changes in rates of ovalbumin and conalbumin gene transcription and mRNA levels were monitored during an entire cycle of estrogen withdrawal and restimulation. Correlations of transcription rates with nuclear estrogen receptor levels in this experiment and in dose-response experiments reveal that conalbumin gene transcription is directly proportional to nuclear receptor levels, whereas ovalbumin gene transcription is related to receptor levels in a way that suggests cooperative interactions among receptors. Conalbumin mRNA accumulation and transcription are transiently inhibited by administration of progesterone to estrogen-stimulated chicks, whereas ovalbumin gene transcription is stimulated by this regimen. This puzzling observation can be rationalized if a single receptor binding site is involved in conalbumin gene regulation and multiple sites are involved in ovalbumin gene regulation. These ideas are combined with our recent observations that protein synthesis inhibitors and butyrate selectively, but reversibly, inhibit ovalbumin and conalbumin gene transcription. We describe a new hypothesis of how steroid hormones regulate egg white gene transcription in the chick oviduct."
https://openalex.org/W1526469700,"Abstract Arylazido-beta-alanyl NAD+ (A3'-O-(3-[N-(4-azido-2-nitrophenyl)amino]propionyl) NAD+) is a potent competitive inhibitor with respect to NADH (apparent Ki, 1.7-2.7 microM) for the purified mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase (EC 1.6.99.3). Upon photoirradiation of the dehydrogenase in the presence of arylazido-beta-[3-3H]-alanyl NAD+, radioactivity was found to be associated with the Mr = 57,000 subunit without significant labeling of what are considered to be the enzyme's two smaller subunits. This labeling could be prevented by the presence of NADH during photoirradiation. In contrast to arylazido-beta-alanyl NAD+, arylazido-beta-alanyl NADP+ (N3'-O-(3-[N-(4-azido-2-nitrophenyl)amino]-propionyl) NADP+) did not inhibit dehydrogenase activity nor did photoirradiation of the enzyme in the presence of the radiolabeled analogue (arylazido-beta-[3-3H]alanyl NADP+) result in radioactivity being incorporated into the enzyme. It is concluded that the Mr -- 57,000 subunit contains the pyridine nucleotide-binding site of the mitochondrial NADH electron transport system."
https://openalex.org/W1479720671,"We have examined the specificity and kinetics of endocytosis of iodinated glycopeptides and glycoproteins by isolated rat reticuloendothelial cell preparations. All of the probes which were recognized by this system contain within their oligosaccharide moiety the following common structural unit which we hypothesize to be the minimum required structure for binding and endocytosis: GlcNAc beta 1,6 or Man alpha 1,6 Man alpha 1,6[Man alpha 1,3]Man beta 1,4GlcNAc beta 1,4GlcNAc beta Asn. Desialyzed tetra-antennary complex oligosaccharides contain this minimum structure but are not endocytosed until after removal of the beta 1,4-linked terminal Gal residues by Diplococcal beta-galactosidase. Further degradation by Diplococcal beta-hexosaminidase removes only the beta 1,2-linked GlcNAc residues resulting in a product which still contains the minimum structure and can be taken up by this system. Desialyzed triantenary and biantenary complex oligosaccharides are not endocytosed following treatment with Diplococcal beta-galactosidase and beta-hexosaminidase. High mannose type oligosaccharides which contain the minimum structure are endocytosed, whereas hybrid structures are not, indicating that the presence of a beta 1,4-linked GlcNAc on the beta-linked core mannose inhibits endocytosis. The Michaelis-Menten kinetic constants are similar for glycopeptides and glycoproteins, ranging from 1.1-6.4 X 10(-7) M for all ligands recognized by this system. In the range of 50-150 X 10(3) ligand binding sites per cell are estimated to be on the cell surface with a capacity to internalize from 13-80 X 10(3) molecules per min per cell at 37 degrees C. All of the structural information required for binding and internalization resides in the oligosaccharide moiety itself."
https://openalex.org/W192517361,"Delipidated bacteriorhodopsin has been reconstituted with endogenous polar lipids from Halobacterium halobium. The vesicle (diameter, 250-500 A) formed are very stable, relatively homogeneous in bacteriorhodopsin and lipid content, and almost optically clear; a minor turbid fraction can be separated by gel filtration. Bacteriorhodopsin in the reconstituted vesicles has an inside out orientation and, on illumination, translocates protons efficiently from the medium to the interior of the vesicles in the presence of the ionophore valinomycin. In the absence of the latter, both the rate and the extent of light-dependent proton uptake by the vesicles are decreased 3-6- and 5-15-fold, respectively, depending on the salt in the assay medium. Both the stimulation by valinomycin and the proton-translocating activity are higher in NaCl than in KCl. Bacteriorhodopsin in these vesicles as in purple membrane, undergoes light adaptation as indicated by a red shift (7-8 nm) of the absorption maximum. At low pH, the absorption maximum of reconstituted protein shows a 50-nm red shift, possibly due to protonation of an ionizable group which interacts with the chromophore. The latter group appears to be accessible only from the external medium."
https://openalex.org/W1553648546,"The mitochondrial nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase enzyme (EC 1.6.1.1) is inhibited by treatment with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or diethylpyrocarbonate. Both inhibitions are pseudo first order with respect to incubation time, and both reaction orders with respect to inhibitor concentration are close to unit, indicating that in each case inhibition results from the binding of one inhibitor molecule per active unit of the transhydrogenase enzyme. In the presence of either inhibitor, both the energy-linked and the nonenergy-linked transhydrogenation reactions are inhibited at about the same rate. The water-soluble carbodiimide, N-ethyl-N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide, showed no inhibition, however, NAD(H) and reduced or oxidized 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide protected the enzyme against inhibition by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, while NADP (but not NADPH) appeared to increase the rate of inhibition. Substrates did not protect the enzyme against inhibition by diethylpyrocarbonate. [14C]dicyclohexylcarbodiimide labeled the transhydrogenase enzyme in submitochondrial particles. Treatment of labeled particles with trypsin resulted in fragmentation of the transhydrogenase enzyme and loss of a labeled polypeptide of Mr = approximately 100,000 as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis."

https://openalex.org/W180798749,"Crocodilian hemoglobin has a high intrinsic oxygen affinity but does not react with those organic phosphate esters that normally control the oxygen affinity of blood in higher vertebrates. Instead, its oxygen affinity is greatly lowered by CO2. The present study was undertaken to determine the nature of the CO2 binding to the hemoglobin of a crocodilian species, the Caiman, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The following parameters were measured: (a) carbamino compounds of deoxy- and oxyhemoglobin, (b) the effect of CO2 (at constant pH) on the oxygen affinity of Caiman hemoglobin, (c) total CO2 concentration of hemoglobin solutions at different pH and pCO2 values, and (d) the effect of CO2 on CD spectra of Caiman aquomethemoglobin. An analysis of the results of these measurements revealed that CO2 binding in the form of carbamate was not oxygen-linked and cannot, therefore, mediate the CO2 effect on the oxygen affinity. It was found, however, that 2 mol of bicarbonate can be bound/hemoglobin tetramer and that the association constant of the bicarbonate anion greatly depends upon the state of ligation. At pH 7.02 and 25 degrees C, a numerical value of 2.0 X 10(3) M-1 was obtained for deoxyhemoglobin, while for oxyhemoglobin no significant bicarbonate binding could be observed. At more alkaline pH (pH greater than or equal to 7.5), the association constant for deoxyhemoglobin decreases. Circular dichroism of Caiman aquomethemoglobin decreased considerably in the 287-nm region upon addition of CO2 at constant pH, an effect very similar to the one caused by inositol hexaphosphate in human aquomethemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1500300036,"A H+ gradient (intravesicular greater than extravesicular), in the absence of a Na+ gradient (extravesicular greater than intravesicular) stimulated phosphate uptake by renal brush border membrane vesicles and provided the driving force to effect the transient accumulation of phosphate against its concentration gradient. The H+ gradient-dependent uptake of phosphate had an absolute requirement for Na+. The rates of uptake and peak accumulation were functions of the delta pH and the concentration of H+ in the intravesicular medium. The H+ gradient-energized Na+-phosphate cotransport system was not affected by valinomycin- or carbonyl cyanide p-fluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone-induced ion diffusion potentials. Therefore, it was independent of the membrane potential, i.e. an electroneutral process. Amiloride, which inhibited the H+-Na+ exchange reaction and prevented the efflux of H+ from the intravesicular medium, enhanced the uptake of phosphate. A model is proposed by which the H+ gradient mediates the uphill transport of phosphate. It is suggested that a similar process may operate in more physiologically intact preparations and may provide one mechanism by which acid-base balance regulates renal phosphate transport."
https://openalex.org/W1562882173,"The precursor for rat liver ornithine transcarbamylase (EC 2.1.3.3) synthesized in vitro was converted to an apparently mature form of the enzyme by isolated rat liver mitochondria. The processed product was recovered in the sedimented mitochondria and was not extracted from the mitochondria with 1 M KCl. The processed product could be extracted with digitonin. The concentration of digitonin required was higher than that for the intermembrane space enzyme, adenylate kinase (EC 2.7.4.3), but lower than that for endogenous ornithine transcarbamylase, which is localized in the matrix space. The processed product sedimented on a sucrose gradient with an S20, omega value of 6.7 S, which is close to that of the mature enzyme (6.0 S), and assembly to the active trimer appeared to occur. The processing of the precursor by the isolated mitochondria was strongly inhibited by both 0.1 mM dinitrophenol and 1 microM carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. However, neither KCN nor NaN3 markedly inhibited the processing. Rat kidney mitochondria, which lack ornithine transcarbamylase, could also import and process the precursor to the mature form of the enzyme. The results indicate that the precursor for ornithine transcarbamylase is transported deeply into the isolated mitochondria, although not completely to the matrix space, in association with the proteolytic processing to the mature enzyme. The transport-processing system was found to be sensitive to uncouplers and to be common to several mitochondrial matrix proteins."

To determine the structure of the more complex members of this series, a mixture of oligosaccharides was prepared from a carboxyl-reduced glycophosphoceramide concentrate by alkali-catalyzed hydrolysis and alkaline phosphatase treatment. A combination of reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (Wells, G. B., and Lester, R. L. (1979) Anal. Biochem. 97, 184-190), normal-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and thin layer chromatography were used to resolve several oligosaccharides as acetylated derivatives. Products of methylation analysis, CrO3 oxidation, and deacetylation-deamination were identified using chemical ionization mass spectrometry to give the following novel structures. A major tetrasaccharide was completely characterized as Gal(alpha 1 leads to 4)GlcNAc(alpha 1 leads to 4)GlcUA(alpha 1 leads to 2)myoinositol. An additional structure of a minor tetrasaccharide was partially characterized as GlcNAc(alpha 1 leads to 4)GlcUA(alpha 1 leads to ?)myoinositol(O leads from 1 alpha)Man. These are representatives of a class of acidic glycolipids from plants, possibly analogous to the acidic gangliosides found in animal cell membranes."
https://openalex.org/W94212796,Polyadenylated RNA has been isolated from maize leaves at various times during greening of etiolated seedlings and used to prime the wheat germ cell-free translation system. Levels of translatable messenger RNA for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase increase with the length of the illumination period. The pattern of the increase in translatable mRNA for the enzyme is similar to that of the increase in phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase protein previously observed in intact tissues. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase synthesized in vivo migrates as a doublet band on gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. A similar doublet has been seen occasionally with the products of cell-free translation.
https://openalex.org/W1516490262,"Liver and kidney of the teleost cod, Gadus morhua, contained oxygen- and NADPH-dependent monooxygenase which mediated the oxidation of trimethylamine (TMA) to trimethylamine oxide (TMAO). The microsomal monooxygenase of liver was partially characterized. The rate of enzymic TMA oxidation had its maximum at pH 8.2 and at 24 degrees C. The enzyme displayed Michaelis-Menten kinetics; the apparent Km value for TMA being 11 microM. All N,N-dimethyl-n-alkylamines with up to 8 carbons in the side chain were oxidized at almost the same rate. The oxidation of TMA was stimulated by octylamine and tyramine, and its ws inhibited by the –SH reagents N-ethylmaleimide and p-chloromercurybenzoate. Lack of inhibition by carbon monoxide and stimulation by FAD indicated that the enzyme was a cytochrome P-450-independent flavoprotein. [14C]TMA injected intraperitoneally into cod was oxidized to [14C]TMAO. After its compartmentation the [14C]TMAO produced was excreted at a rate of approximately 0.5%/day in cod fed a TMAO-rich diet. It was inferred that high stability of body TMAO and a surplus amount of TMAO in their natural diet can explain the lack of endogenous TMAO synthesis encountered in many TMAO-containing marine fish."

Similar effects of the inhibitors on hydrolysis of the two substrates indicate that the quaternary ammonium group of acetylcholine and the neopentyl group of 3,3-dimethylbutyl acetate bind at the same subsite. Comparison of (CH3)3+NCH2CH2CH2COCH3 (Compound I), Ki = 0.02 mM, and its tertiary homologue, (CH3)2-+NHCH2CH2CH2COCH3 (Compound V), Ki = 0.75 mM, with a secondary isomer of Compound I, 3-oxo-(N-tert-butyl)-butanaminium, (CH3)3C+NH2CH2CH2COCH3 (Compound II), Ki = 0.15 mM, and its lower homologue, (CH3)2CH+NH2CH2CH2COCH3 (Compound IX), Ki = 2 mM, attests to the importance of the branched trimethyl structure and the smaller effect of hydrophobicity of the quaternary ammonium structure. This is supported by competitive inhibition by tert-butyl ammonium, (CH3)3C+NH3 (Compound IV), Ki = 0.45 mM, compared with mixed inhibition by its quarternary isomer, (CH3)4+N (Compound VII), Ki = 1.5 mM, and choline (Compound VI), Ki = 1.0 mM.

The native proteins have the same molecular weight of 105,000 by gel filtration and sedimentation velocity on sucrose density gradients. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels have a molecular weight of 104,000, indicating that the two forms are monomers. Hexokinase Ia had a pI of 6.2 to 6.3 pH units while hexokinase Ib had a pI of 5.7 to 5.8 pH units by isoelectric focusing. The two enzymes were specific for Mg.ATP and Mg.ITP as the nucleotide substrates. Several hexoses could be phosphorylated by hexokinase Ia and Ib with different affinities."
https://openalex.org/W1571896927,"The collagen mRNA population of cultured chick chondrocytes was examined during a 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine-induced shift in the type of collagen synthesized. When a cell-free protein-synthesizing system was used, it was found that an increase in the translatable mRNA for type I collagen [alpha 1 (I)]2 alpha 2 was correlated with the onset of the synthesis of this collagen type by intact cells. It was also found, both in vivo and in vitro, that a normal 2:1 ratio of type I subunits is not synthesized at early times in the type II to type I shift but that the alpha 1 (I) subunit is found in excess. It would appear, therefore, that the expression of these complementary subunits is not tightly coordinated."

https://openalex.org/W1520511617,"The structures of FL4b and of two other related amino acid fucosides have been determined by a combination of methylation analysis and enzymatic digestion. Additionally, the anomeric configurations of the carbohydrate moieties of FL4a, previously shown to be glucosyl(1 leads to 3)fucosyl 1 leads to threonine (Steiner, S., Via, D. P., Klinger, M., Larriba, G., Sramek, S., and Laine, R. (1978) in Glycoproteins and Glycolipids in Disease Processes (Walborg, E. F., Jr., ed) pp. 378-403, American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.) have been determined by enzymatic digestion. The results indicate that the structures are: FL3a, fucosyl alpha 1 leads to threonine; FL3b, fucosyl alpha 1 leads to serine; FL4a, glucosyl beta 1 leads to 3 fucosyl alpha 1 leads to threonine; and FL4b, glucosyl beta 1 leads to 3 fucosyl alpha 1 leads to serine. FL4a, which appears to have the same structure as a component from human urine (Hallgren, P., Lundblad, A., and Svensson, S. (1975) J. Bil. Chem. 250, 5312-5314), and FL4b are highly unusual in that they contain fucose in a nonterminal position. The fucosyl-serine linkage found in compounds FL3b and FL4b is a novel structure."
https://openalex.org/W1535122062,"This study provides evidence for the occurrence of a biochemical function for the polyamines, spermidine and spermine, in bovine epididymal spermatozoa. Methods are described for the detection and isolation of a protein kinase from spermatozoa which catalyzed transfer of phosphate from [gamma-32P]ATP to a unique endogenous protein of Mr = 70,000 in a reaction that was polyamine-dependent. Enzymatic phosphorylation of the 70,000-dalton protein by the purified protein kinase was sharply activated, at times more than 80-fold, by the polyamines, spermidine and spermine. Spermidine and spermine, together in equimolar combination, synergistically activated the protein kinase when compared with all other possible combinations of putrescine, spermidine, or spermine. The polyamine-dependent protein kinase was resolved by phosphocellulose chromatography into a catalytic component of Mr = 19,000 and a complex comprised of the catalytic component associated with the natural phosphate-acceptor protein of Mr = 70,000. This protein kinase was not activated by cyclic nucleotides or calcium ion."

https://openalex.org/W1487082744,"A number of factors which lower the oxygen affinity of hemoglobins are also known to produce shifts of the absorption band maxima of the oxyheme. We have studied the variation of the absorption spectra of oxygenated alpha SH and beta SH subunits of human Hb A as a function of their state of association (i.e. alpha, alpha 2, beta, beta 4, alpha beta, or alpha 2 beta 2), and have attempted to correlate the spectral changes with changes to O2 affinity. These studies were carried out under solution conditions (0.1 M Tris, 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM Na2EDTA, pH 7.4, 10 degrees C) where detailed thermodynamic data for subunit association and oxygen binding are available (Ackers, G. K. (1980) Biophys. J. 32, 331-346). Concentration-difference spectra reveal that the visible and Soret absorption band maxima of beta O2 are slightly red shifted relative to beta 4O8. A unique feature of this spectral change is that the red shift is accompanied by an increase in the ratio of the peak absorbances of the visible alpha and beta spectral bands. By measuring the spectral change as a function of concentration, an association constant of 6.4 +/- 1.9 X 10(15) M-3 was determined for the 4(beta O2) in equilibrium beta 4O8 equilibrium. In contrast, no spectral differences were found between alpha O2 and alpha 2O4 or between oxy alpha beta dimers and oxyHb. Mixing experiments show that the spectrum of oxyHb differs from the average of either alpha O2 + beta O2 or alpha O2 + beta 4O8, but is closer to the former. A comparison between these spectral data and the reported O2 affinities of these species shows that affinity and oxyheme spectra are not correlated."
https://openalex.org/W1571692970,"The 20,000-dalton light chain of cardiac muscle myosin can be specifically digested and thereby removed from the rest of the myosin molecule by incubation with a myofibrillar protease (Malhotra, A., Huang, S., and Bhan, A. (1979) Biochemistry 18, 461-467). In order to study the effects of phosphorylation of the 20,000-dalton myosin light chain, experiments were carried out with cardiac muscle myosin that was made deficient in this light chain following proteolysis. Both the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated isolated 20,000-dalton myosin light chain of cardiac muscle myosin were found to bind to light chain-deficient myosin. Prior to readdition of the isolated light chains, this light chain-deficient myosin was found to have a higher MgATPase activity in the presence and absence of actin, than native myosin. Binding of the unphosphorylated myosin light chain restored the MgATPase activity of light chain-deficient myosin to that of native cardiac myosin. In contrast, the binding of 2 mol of the previously phosphorylated myosin light chain did not lower the actin-activated MgATPase activity. The results suggest that while phosphorylation of the 20,000-dalton light chain of cardiac muscle myosin is not essential for the actin-activated MgATPase activity, it may have a modulatory role."

Rabbit antiserum to these three proteins was used to examine various rat tissues for the presence of these antigens. Immunological specificity of the antiserum was assessed using quantitative microcomplement fixation assay or by visualization of the immunoreactive complexes with peroxidase-antiperoxidase procedure after transferring the electrophoretically separated proteins to nitrocellulose sheets. The immunoreactivity was localized with the three proteins p39, p49, and p56 in Novikoff hepatoma. The p56 protein was found to be present in normal rat liver, 24-h regenerating rat liver, fetal rat liver, or kidney, albeit in much smaller amounts as found in Novikoff hepatoma. the p49 and p39 antigens were specific for Novikoff hepatoma. Immunoabsorption experiments confirmed the specificity of this antiserum. Assessment of various subcellular fractions of Novikoff hepatoma revealed that the p39, p49, and p56 protein antigens are present in the cytoplasmic fractions as well as in isolated chromatin."

J., Jr., Parish, E. J., Pascal, R. A., Jr., and Kandutsch, A. A. (1980) J. Lipid Res. 21, 571-584). In the present study, we have found that both sterols have a second, but distinct, site of action, distal to the formation of mevalonic acid. 14 alpha-Hydroxymethyl-5 alpha-cholest-7-ene-3 beta, 15 alpha-diol has been found to be a potent inhibitor of the synthesis of digitonin-precipitable sterols from labeled mevalonate in cell-free preparations of rat liver. This inhibition was accompanied by a striking accumulation of labeled lanosterol and 24,25-dihydrolanosterol. The latter sterols were fully characterized by the results of chromatographic and co-crystallization experiments. In contrast, 14 alpha-hydroxymethyl-5 alpha-cholest-6-ene-3 beta, 15 alpha-diol had only a slight effect on the synthesis of digitonin-precipitable sterols from labeled mevalonate in cell-free rat liver preparations. The delta 6-3 beta, 15 alpha, 32-triol had no apparent effect on the metabolism of lanosterol and 24,25-dihydrolanosterol but caused a substantial accumulation of labeled 5 alpha-cholest-8-en-3 beta-ol which was fully characterized by the results of chromatographic and co-crystallization experiments. These findings are compatible with a specific inhibition of the metabolism of lanosterol and 24,25-dihydrolanosterol by the delta 7-3 beta, 15 alpha, 32-triol and a specific inhibition of the delta 8 leads to delta 7 isomerase by the delta 6-3 beta, 15 alpha, 32-triol. [2,4]3H]14 alpha-Hydroxymethyl-5 alpha-cholest-7-ene-3 beta, 15 alpha-diol, prepared by chemical synthesis, was not convertible to cholesterol upon incubation, under aerobic conditions, with a cell-free homogenate preparation of rat liver. The labeled delta 7-3 beta, 15 alpha, 32-triol was, however, metabolized to several polar compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1514981998,"The enzymatic modification of tryptophan residues in Trp-Leu, Leu-Trp, Leu-Trp-Leu, and yeast mating hormone (alpha-factor), a tridecapeptide containing Trp-1 and Trp-3, has been investigated with tryptophan side chain oxidase I crystallized previously from Pseudomonas and tryptophan side chain oxidase II recently isolated from the same organism. With Trp-Leu as substrate, threo- and erythro-beta-hydroxytryptophan residues were identified as primary products and the former perferentially underwent second step dehydrogenation to give beta-ketotryptophan. Free threo- and erythro-beta-hydroxytryptophan, hitherto undescribed tryptophan derivatives, were isolated after enzymatic hydrolysis, identified, and characterized. Leu-alpha, beta-dehydrotryptamine, a new biochemical entity, was a sole main product of Leu-Trp. With Leu-Trp-Leu, diastereoisomeric Leu-beta-hydroxyl-Trp-Leu and Leu-alpha, beta-dehydro-Trp-Leu were formed simultaneously, the pH and ionic strength being determinants of the ratio of these products. Leu-threo-beta-hydroxy-Trp-Leu was also converted to Leu-beta-keto-Trp-Leu, but, distinct from NH2-terminal beta-hydroxytryptophan, both diastereoisomers underwent acid-catalyzed dehydration to give Leu-alpha, beta-dehydro-Trp-Leu. Thus, the mode of modification was shown to be prescribed by the site of tryptophan in peptides and the results were the same with either tryptophan side chain oxidase I or II, except that the latter was almost inactive on Trp-Leu. With any substrate, 3-indolecarboxaldehyde was a sole detectable by-product."

On the other hand, the NH2-terminal segment of H1 histone protected 20 base pairs of linker DNA adjacent to the nucleosome core particle. These data provide strong evidence that the NH2-terminal portion and the carboxyl-terminal portion of H1 histone interact with 20 base pairs of linker DNA and the core DNA of the nucleosome, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1662284281,"Direct immunotitrations of rat liver fatty acid synthetase in crude tissue homogenates with monospecific rabbit anti-rat liver fatty acid synthetase antibody enabled us to make a comparison of fatty acid synthetase protein and activity (percentage of maximal activity) as a function of the nutritional state in normal, diabetic, and insulin- and glucagon-insulin treated animals. Previous results, in which large changes in fatty acid synthetase activity were related to protein synthesis and degradation rather than to enzyme activation, were confirmed. It was also shown that fatty acid synthetase activation does not occur immediately on synthesis but follows the synthesis of fatty acid synthetase protein. In order to characterize the enzymatically inactive protein found on immunotitration and to develop an in vitro system for fatty acid synthetase activation, conditions were sought to obtain large amounts of fatty acid synthetase protein free from, or low in, activity. It was found that treatment of hypophysectomized rats with triiodothyronine meets these requirements, yielding milligram quantities of inactive fatty acid synthetase protein with less than 2% of maximal activity. A part of the inactive fatty acid synthetase was found to be the apoenzyme as indicated by beta-ketoreductase and thioesterase activities, by its ability to incorporate label from [G3H]CoA, and by its partial in vitro activation, which led to an increase in overall synthetase activity in crude and partially purified cell-free systems. The components required for activation include magnesium ion and a transferase fraction prepared from livers of 48-h fasted, 12-h refed rats."
https://openalex.org/W1586399928,"The effects of various metabolic inhibitors on cell-surface receptors for diphtheria toxin were studied. Incubation of Vero cells at 37 degrees C with fluoride, azide, salicylate, and, to a lesser degree, with deoxyglucose resulted in an apparent loss of receptors for the toxin. With some drugs the loss was rapid (half-time approximately 8-9 min) while with others considerably longer time periods were required (half-time greater than or equal to 40 min). The loss of toxin receptors could also be induced by the drugs at 4 degrees C. Washing out the drugs and incubating the cells at 37 degrees C led to a complete restoration of receptors to control numbers. Restoration did not occur if cells were incubated at 4 degrees C. The regain of binding capacity was not dependent on RNA or protein synthesis. It is suggested that metabolic inhibitors may block a continuous process required to maintain toxin receptors in a functional state at the cell surface."

One of the components yielded, upon mild acid treatment (20 mM HCl, 100 degrees C, 20 min), a low molecular weight water-soluble component (PO), which contained most of the 32P label associated with the parental lipid-oligosaccharide. PO was periodate-negative, ninhydrin-negative, and permanganate-positive. The phosphate group was stable to strong acid, which converted PO to a single, 32P-labeled product, but the phosphate was readily released by incubation under mild alkaline conditions. Strong alkali produced a product reactive with periodate, ninhydrin, and fluorescamine. When dephosphorylated PO was hydrolyzed with acid and the products were converted to the alditol acetate derivatives, gas chromatography revealed a single major component. Gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy of this compound showed it to be the derivative of a 2-acetamido-2-deoxytetrose. That 2-acetamido-2-deoxytetrose is glycosidically bound in PO is indicated by the fact that PO must be hydrolyzed by strong acid before reduction with NaBD4 is able to incorporate deuterium into the tetrose."
