https://openalex.org/W1981906600,"Approximately 20 percent of the membrane-bound protein of erythrocyte ghosts can be solubilized and obtained free of other membrane components by dialysis against adenosine triphosphate and 2-mercaptoethanol. This protein forms one major band on polyacrylamide gels and a single boundary in free-boundary electrophoresis, and it undergoes polymerization in the presence of divalent cations to form coiled filaments visible by electron microscopy. Antibodies to this membrane protein react specifically with red blood cells or their membrane ghosts but do not react with serum, erythrocyte cytoplasm, or other blood cells. The functional role of this protein is unknown, but it appears to be involved in maintaiining the structure of the red cell membrane. We suggest that this protein be called Spectrin since it is obtained from membrane ghosts."

Accompanying this is a rise in pH and the precipitation of Ca(++) ion from solution. The Ca(++) is not precipitated as CaCO(3) but instead as a mixture of calcium fatty acid salts or soaps with from 14 to 18 carbon atoms. This can be explained by the thermodynamic instability of CaCO(3) relative to Ca soaps in the presence of excess free fatty acid. It is suggested that some ancient CaCO(3) concretions, especially those enclosing fossils of soft-bodied organisms, may have formed rapidly after death in the form of natural Ca soap (adipocere) which was later converted to CaCO(3)."

The receptive fields and the response characteristics observed upon stimulation of the contralateral eye are very similar to those observed upon stimulation of the ipsilateral eye; the two monocular receptive fields of a given cell lie in corresponding points of heteronymous halves of the visual field in close contact with the vertical meridian, thus adding in visual space and forming a binocular receptive area which crosses the vertical meridian and extends equally on either side of it."
https://openalex.org/W1975524802,"Reduction of sulfate to sulfide in waterlogged soils was dependent on soil redox potential and pH. Little or no sulfide accumulated with a redox potential above -150 millivolts, or with a pH outside the range 6.5 to 8.5."

https://openalex.org/W2067136639,"If ion exchange on clay minerals regulated the cationts in the primitive ocean as it does in the present ocean, the pH would have been 8 and the K(+) concentration 0.01M. Since NH(4)(+) and K(+) are similar in their claymineral equilibria, the maximum NH(4) (+) concentration in the primitive ocean would also have been 0.01M. An estimate of the minimum NH(4)(+) concentratin is 1 x 10(-3)M, based on the reversible deamination of aspartic acid and the assumption that aspartic acid is necessary for the origin of life. The rate of this nonenzymic deamnination is rapid on the geological time scale."
https://openalex.org/W2094955600,"The structure of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic phosphate has been determined by single-crystal x-ray diffraction. The two molecules in the asymmetric unit show different conformation about the glycosidic bond, while other structural details are essentially the same. The furanose rings are puckered with the C(4') atom out of the best four-atom plane. The bond lengths and angles appear to be normal."
https://openalex.org/W2015780677,"Acetylation of histones takes place along the salivary gland chromosomes of Chironomus thummi when RNA synthesis is active. It can be observed but not measured quantitatively by autoradiography of chromosome squashes. The ""fixatives"" commonly used in preparing squashes of insect chromosomes preferentially extract the highly acetylated ""arginine-rich"" histone fractions; the use of such fixatives may explain the reported absence of histone acetylation in Drosophila melanogaster."
https://openalex.org/W2124766464,"A binuclear ion ([NH(3))5RuN(2)Ru(NH(3))(5)](5)+ is formed by the direct reaction of N(2) with an aqueous solution of (NH(3))(5)RuOH(2)(2+) at room temperature. The binuclear ion is also formed by the reversible reaction of (NH(3))5RuOH(2)(2+) with (NH(3))(5)RuN(2)(2+). Solid [(NH(3))(5)RuN(2)Ru(NH(3))(5)] (BF(4))(4) has been prepared, and its ultraviolet and infrared spectra are reported."
https://openalex.org/W1997799222,"Working at pressures of up to 2000 atmospheres, more than ten times higher than in previous gas chromatography, we used the solvent power of dense gases to enable migration of chromatographic substances of molecular weights as high as 400,000. Carotenoids, corticol steroids, sterols, nucleosides, amino acids, carbohydrates, and several polymers have been caused to migrate, separated, and detected in NH(3) and CO(2) carrier gases at temperatures of 140 degrees and 40 degrees C, just above the respective critical points. Previously such compounds either defied separation by gas chromatography or had to be chromatographed as their more volatile derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W1967664598,Estimates of the probability that nearby explosions of supernovae have occurred during the earth's history and the biologic effects of the radiation therefrom are presented. They suggest that cosmic radiation from supernovae could have caused the extinction of many exposed animals without the simultaneous extinction of plant life. This suggests that supernovae should be considered as one possible mechanism by which fauna become extinct.
https://openalex.org/W2041974012,"Metabolic rates of unstimulated, minced preparations of red and white muscles from two species of Pacific tuna fishes (Katsuwonus pelamis and Thunnus obesus) were determined from respirometric measurements of oxygen consumption. Ratios of mean metabolic rates for red muscles to those of white muscles averaged 6.2 at five temperatures over the range of 5 degrees to 35 degrees C. Temperature coefficients (Q10's) for mean metabolic rates for both types of muscle were between 1.0 and 1.2 over the entire temperature range. Metabolic rates of tuna red muscles were equal to those of preparations of mixed red and white muscle from the white rat at 25 degrees and 35 degrees C, and were higher than the mammalian rates at lower temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W2018815695,The fluorescence of cattle rod outer segments (dried) and of rhodopsin in solution lies in the range of 575 to 600 millimicrons with a quantum efficiency of 0.005 if excitation is in the visible band near 500 millimicrons. The emission is abolished by bleaching at -196 degrees C but can be reversibly regenerated by irradiation with light of longer wavelength (600 millimicrons). This behavior reflects the known interconversion of rhodopsin to prelumirhodopsin at this temperature.
https://openalex.org/W2069553395,"Metabolism of ethanol-1-C(14) was assessed in a group of alcoholic and nonalcoholic male subjects. All subjects were screened for absence of physical derangement. Subjects were also carefully matched by dietary, social, and environmental criteria. No differences in rate of output of C(l4)CO(2) were detected after ingestion of alcohol which produced concentrations of 50 to 60 milligrams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood. These data do not support the hypothesis that alcoholics metabolize ethanol more rapidly than nonalcoholics do."
https://openalex.org/W2055115530,"Moths of the genus Celerio, hovering and feeding from blossoms, have been observed to react vigorously to high-pitched sounds. The acoustic receptor appears to involve the labial palps. Its characteristics have been determined from responses made, when the moth is exposed to artificial sound pulses, by an interneuron originating in its head. These responses have been found only in 4 out of 19 sphingid species tested."
https://openalex.org/W2038388880,"A variant of hemoglobin A, named Hb Hijiyama, found in two generations of a Japanese family living in Hiroshima, Japan, has a higher anodal electrophoretic mobility than hemoglobin A; a gain of two negative charges per molecule is indicated. Fingerprinting and amino acid analysis showed the biochemical anomaly to be in the beta chain at residue 120, where lysine is replaced by glutamic acid. In the heterozygote carriers of the abnormal hemoglobin there is no apparent association with clinical or hematologic abnormalities."
https://openalex.org/W1998701251,"Cysteamine present during x-irradiation protects synchronized Chinese hamster cells in culture against lethal damage at all stages of the cell cycle. The effect is greatest for cells irradiated at sensitive stages such as G(1) and least for resistant cells; for example, late S (dose-modifying factors 4.2 and 2.7, respectively). The effect of 50 millimolar cysteamine is to render almost invariant the normally variant x-ray age response for lethality. This suggests that there are two components of x-ray damage, only one of which is age dependent, and it is against this component that cysteamine protects the cell. Cystamine, however, has no protective effect upon these cells at any stage of the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2011910386,"A chemical search for a natural activator of propylure, the sex pheromone of the pink bollworm moth, revealed that the female moths produce N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide, an outstanding insect repellent synthesized commercially and never before reported from natural sources. The compound occurs in fairly large amount in female adults and in much lesser amount in female pupae, but it is completely absent in female larvae and in all stages of the male insect. Its role in the life of the insect has not yet been definitely determined."
https://openalex.org/W2022606325,"The results of an experiment on serial-choice reaction time, specifically designed as a critical test of the Information Hypothesis, lead to rejection of the hypothesis; information is found to be neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition to account for the data. Where previously information had been interpreted as a determinant of reaction time, it was usually confounded with the probability of nonrepetition of a signal. Thus, to the extent that this confounding is present in previous experiments, the inference attributing an increase in reaction time to an increase in information is logically invalid."
https://openalex.org/W2030183114,Afferent activity from dissected filaments of nerves to the adrenal gland was recorded. Firing rates of single fibers followed changes in systemic blood pressure. Chemically and mechanically induced changes in blood pressure were reflected by an appropriate directional change in unit activity.
https://openalex.org/W2060558577,"By use of intracranial stimulation as reinforcement, fixed-ratio performance could be established directly from continuous reinforcement by gradual reduction of the train duration of the stimuli contingent on all but the terminal response in the desired ratio. Furthermore, stimuli of subreinforcement strength enhanced ratio performance when introduced after training by the conventional method."
https://openalex.org/W2055486379,"Nitrogen isotope fractionation in the Hoering-Moore experiment, injection of N2 into CO2 carrier and flow through sandstone, is due to diffusion in the gas phase rather than to surface interaction. This process, called ""carrier diffusion,"" produces a characteristic fractionation pattern relative to a fraction coordinate, with points of zero fractionation at 16 and 84 percent and heavy isotope enrichment between these points. Carrier diffusion is an efficient enrichment process for low-abundance isotopes lighter than the abundant species and for helium and hydrogen in gas mixtures."

https://openalex.org/W2061401957,"There is a series of pits in the scales of the rostrum and posterior portion of the lower lips in some pythons and boas. In the Australian python Morelia spilotes, these pits are innervated by the maxillary and mandibular branches of the trigeminal nerve. Structural and neurophysiological evidence indicate that in the pits there are receptors that function as detectors of radiant heat flux."
https://openalex.org/W2091758508,"Development of a rapid screening test for atypical cholinesterase in serum enabled large-scale surveys of populations. The frequency of the heterozygous trait among Greeks, Yugoslavs, and East Indians was similar to that among United States Caucasians (2.8 to 3.3 percent). In trait frequency, U.S. Negroes were intermediate (1.05 percent) between Congolese Africans (0.29 percent) and U.S. Whites (3.3 percent). The gene was absent from or very rare in populations originating in East Asia (Taiwanese, Japanese, Filipinos, and Eskimos). Prolonged apnea during anesthesia from administration of succinylcholine caused by homozygosity for this gene, is expected to be extremely rare among populations of Negroes and East Asians."
https://openalex.org/W2023468409,Infection of adult BALB/c mice with Friend disease virus results in a leukemia-like disease characterized by erythropoietic changes and splenomegaly. A marked depression of formation of cellular and serum antibody occurs in infected animals. Electron-microscopic examination of the ultrastructure of spleen sections from infected mice with depressed immunity revealed that virus particles can be detected only in immature blastlike lymphoid cells and not in plasmocytes characteristic of the immune response in spleens of noninfected mice immunized with sheep erythrocytes.
https://openalex.org/W2070247180,"In the indigo snake, a pattern of undulating lines on the surface of the skin, formed by the junction of rows of cells, acts as a two-dimensional optical diffraction grating to produce the play of colors. The distance between repetitive units of the pattern measured from observations made with an electron microscope are in agreement with those found by spectrometric analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2073773496,"Brief stimulation of the upper lip with the tip of a nylon thread frequently produces an "" afterglow"" sensation that may persist as long as several minutes after cessation of stimulation. The duration of afterglow is increased by strong suggestion, and decreased by vibration of the skin prior to stimulation. The afterglow may be followed by a period of acute ""awareness"" of the area, distincty different from the stimulus and afterglow sensations. The afterglows produced by a warm stimulator applied to the back often well up into a painful sting."
https://openalex.org/W2008588915,"Ovulation induced in the immature rat by pregnant mare's serum can be prevented by chlorpromazine. Coitus induces ovulation in such animals, and ovulation so induced may result in pregnancy. Both implantation and pregnancy appear to be normal although the duration of gestation may be prolonged. Decidual response also is produced in the immature rat after coitus-induced ovulation. We suggest that the reflex release of luteinizing hormone may occur in Primates after coitus."
https://openalex.org/W2117160524,"The chemical composition of lyophilized venom from Vejovis spinigerus is reported. At least 13 distinct bands were obtained on disc electrophoresis; on Sephadex G-50, four major peaks were found. The lethal activity was associated with the second peak. The intravenous lethal dose, median (lethal for 50 percent of inoculated group), of the crude venom was 4.87 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. Neither the crude venom nor its fractions had a deleterious effect on neuromuscular transmission, reflex discharge, or antidromic inhibition. Crude venom evoked simultaneous changes in systemic arterial, venous, and cisternal pressures."

https://openalex.org/W1986260064,"The mathematical physicist Hermann Weyl (2) has claimed that, unless machines can accomplish an infinite sequence of distinct operations in a finite time, the standard mathematical theory of motion is beset by one of Zeno's kinematical paradoxes. Hence I have compared the kinematics of several such ""infinity machines"" to the kinematics of the continuous motion of Achilles. And I have argued that, while some designs for infinity machines are indeed inconsistent, others are not impossible on purely kinematical grounds. This argument was coupled with several reasons for denying Zeno's and A. N. Whitehead's allegation of paradox against the mathematical, description of the motion of Achilles."

Release of the tritium generated by a power economy, if the nuclear power were all fusion, would result in unacceptable worldwide dosages by the year 2000."
