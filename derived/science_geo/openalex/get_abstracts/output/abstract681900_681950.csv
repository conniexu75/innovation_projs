https://openalex.org/W3204811749,"Abstract Telomeres, the end fragments of chromosomes, play key roles in cellular proliferation and senescence. Here we characterize the genetic architecture of naturally occurring variation in leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and identify causal links between LTL and biomedical phenotypes in 472,174 well-characterized UK Biobank participants. We identified 197 independent sentinel variants associated with LTL at 138 genomic loci (108 new). Genetically determined differences in LTL were associated with multiple biological traits, ranging from height to bone marrow function, as well as several diseases spanning neoplastic, vascular and inflammatory pathologies. Finally, we estimated that, at the age of 40 years, people with an LTL &gt;1 s.d. shorter than the population mean had a 2.5-year-lower life expectancy compared with the group with ≥1 s.d. longer LDL. Overall, we furnish new insights into the genetic regulation of LTL, reveal wide-ranging influences of LTL on physiological traits, diseases and longevity, and provide a powerful resource available to the global research community."
https://openalex.org/W3203889005,"Fine-mapping to plausible causal variation may be more effective in multi-ancestry cohorts, particularly in the MHC, which has population-specific structure. To enable such studies, we constructed a large (n = 21,546) HLA reference panel spanning five global populations based on whole-genome sequences. Despite population-specific long-range haplotypes, we demonstrated accurate imputation at G-group resolution (94.2%, 93.7%, 97.8% and 93.7% in admixed African (AA), East Asian (EAS), European (EUR) and Latino (LAT) populations). Applying HLA imputation to genome-wide association study data for HIV-1 viral load in three populations (EUR, AA and LAT), we obviated effects of previously reported associations from population-specific HIV studies and discovered a novel association at position 156 in HLA-B. We pinpointed the MHC association to three amino acid positions (97, 67 and 156) marking three consecutive pockets (C, B and D) within the HLA-B peptide-binding groove, explaining 12.9% of trait variance. A high-resolution reference panel based on whole-genome sequencing data enables accurate imputation of HLA alleles across diverse populations and fine-mapping of HLA association signals for HIV-1 host response."
https://openalex.org/W3201831237,"Higher-order chromatin structure regulates gene expression, and mutations in proteins mediating genome folding underlie developmental disorders known as cohesinopathies. However, the relationship between three-dimensional genome organization and embryonic development remains unclear. Here we define a role for bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) in genome folding, and leverage it to understand the importance of genome folding in neural crest progenitor differentiation. Brd4 deletion in neural crest results in cohesinopathy-like phenotypes. BRD4 interacts with NIPBL, a cohesin agonist, and BRD4 depletion or loss of the BRD4-NIPBL interaction reduces NIPBL occupancy, suggesting that BRD4 stabilizes NIPBL on chromatin. Chromatin interaction mapping and imaging experiments demonstrate that BRD4 depletion results in compromised genome folding and loop extrusion. Finally, mutation of individual BRD4 amino acids that mediate an interaction with NIPBL impedes neural crest differentiation into smooth muscle. Remarkably, loss of WAPL, a cohesin antagonist, rescues attenuated smooth muscle differentiation resulting from BRD4 loss. Collectively, our data reveal that BRD4 choreographs genome folding and illustrates the relevance of balancing cohesin activity for progenitor differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W3202963999,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, higher educational institutions worldwide switched to emergency distance learning in early 2020. The less structured environment of distance learning forced students to regulate their learning and motivation more independently. According to self-determination theory (SDT), satisfaction of the three basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence and social relatedness affects intrinsic motivation, which in turn relates to more active or passive learning behavior. As the social context plays a major role for basic need satisfaction, distance learning may impair basic need satisfaction and thus intrinsic motivation and learning behavior. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between basic need satisfaction and procrastination and persistence in the context of emergency distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic in a cross-sectional study. We also investigated the mediating role of intrinsic motivation in this relationship. Furthermore, to test the universal importance of SDT for intrinsic motivation and learning behavior under these circumstances in different countries, we collected data in Europe, Asia and North America. A total of N = 15,462 participants from Albania, Austria, China, Croatia, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Japan, Kosovo, Lithuania, Poland, Malta, North Macedonia, Romania, Sweden, and the US answered questions regarding perceived competence, autonomy, social relatedness, intrinsic motivation, procrastination, persistence, and sociodemographic background. Our results support SDT's claim of universality regarding the relation between basic psychological need fulfilment, intrinsic motivation, procrastination, and persistence. However, whereas perceived competence had the highest direct effect on procrastination and persistence, social relatedness was mainly influential via intrinsic motivation."

Recently, several publications on COVID-19 outcomes in this patient population appeared, but knowledge on optimal treatment, mortality, outcomes, and appropriate risk predictors is limited. A retrospective analysis was performed in a German high-volume lung transplant center between 19 th March 2020 and 18 th May 2021. Impact of COVID-19 on physical and psychological health, clinical outcomes, and mortality were analyzed including follow-up visits up to 12 weeks after infection in survivors. Predictive parameters on survival were assessed using univariate and multivariate proportional hazards regression models. Out of 1,046 patients in follow-up, 31 acquired COVID-19 during the pandemic. 12 of 31 (39%) died and 26 (84%) were hospitalized . In survivors a significant decline in exercise capacity (p = 0.034), TLC (p = 0.02), and DLCO (p = 0.007) was observed at follow-up after 3 months. Anxiety, depression, and self-assessed quality of life remained stable. Charlson comorbidity index predicted mortality (HR 1.5, 1.1–2.2; p = 0.023). In recipients with pre-existing CLAD, mortality and clinical outcomes were inferior. However, pre-existing CLAD did not predict mortality. COVID-19 remains a life-threatening disease for lung transplant recipients, particularly in case comorbidities. Further studies on long term outcomes and impact on pre-existing CLAD are needed."

https://openalex.org/W3203933001,"Wildlife-vehicle collisions are one of the main causes of mortality for wild mammals and birds in the UK. Here, using a dataset of 54,000+ records collated by a citizen science roadkill recording scheme between 2014–2019, we analyse and present temporal patterns of wildlife roadkill of the 19 most commonly reported taxa in the UK (84% of all reported roadkill). Most taxa (13 out of 19) showed significant and consistent seasonal variations in road mortality and fitted one of two seasonal patterns; bimodal or unimodal: only three species (red fox Vulpes vulpes , European polecat Mustela putorius and Reeves’ muntjac deer Muntiacus reevesi ) showed no significant seasonality. Species that increase movement in spring and autumn potentially have bimodal patterns in roadkill due to the increase in mate-searching and juvenile dispersal during these respective time periods (e.g. European badger Meles meles ). Unimodal patterns likely represent increased mortality due to a single short pulse in activity associated with breeding (e.g. birds) or foraging (e.g. grey squirrels Sciurus carolinensis in autumn). Importantly, these patterns also indicate periods of increased risk for drivers, potentially posing a greater threat to human welfare. In addition to behaviour-driven annual patterns, abiotic factors (temperature and rainfall) explained some variance in roadkill. Notably, high rainfall was associated with decreased observations of two bird taxa (gulls and Eurasian magpies Pica pica ) and European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus . By quantifying seasonal patterns in roadkill, we highlight a significant anthropogenic impact on wild species, which is important in relation to conservation, animal welfare, and human safety."
https://openalex.org/W3203476773,"Accumulation of aggregated alpha-synuclein (α-syn) is believed to play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies. As a key constituent of Lewy pathology, more than 90% of α-syn in Lewy bodies is phosphorylated at serine-129 (pS129) and hence, it is used extensively as a marker for α-syn pathology. However, the exact role of pS129 remains controversial and the kinase(s) responsible for the phosphorylation have yet to be determined. In this study, we investigated the effect of Polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2) inhibition on formation of pS129 using an ex vivo organotypic brain slice model of synucleinopathy. Our data demonstrated that PLK2 inhibition has no effect on α-syn aggregation, pS129 or inter-neuronal spreading of the aggregated α-syn seen in the organotypic slices. Instead, PLK2 inhibition reduced the soluble pS129 level in the nuclei. The same finding was replicated in an in vivo mouse model of templated α-syn aggregation and in human dopaminergic neurons, suggesting that PLK2 is more likely to be involved in S129-phosphorylation of the soluble physiological fraction of α-syn. We also demonstrated that reduction of nuclear pS129 following PLK2 inhibition for a short time before sample collection improves the signal-to-noise ratio when quantifying pS129 aggregate pathology."
https://openalex.org/W3203242309,"The taste stimulus glucose comprises approximately half of the commercial sugar sweeteners used today, whether in the form of the di-saccharide sucrose (glucose-fructose) or half of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). Therefore, oral glucose has been presumed to contribute to the sweet taste of foods when combined with fructose. In light of recent rodent data on the role of oral metabolic glucose signaling, we examined psychopharmacologically whether oral glucose detection may also involve an additional pathway in humans to the traditional sweet taste transduction via the class 1 taste receptors T1R2/T1R3. In a series of experiments, we first compared oral glucose detection thresholds to sucralose thresholds without and with addition of the T1R receptor inhibitor Na-lactisole. Next, we compared oral detection thresholds of glucose to sucralose and to the non-metabolizable glucose analog, α-methyl-D-glucopyranoside (MDG) without and with the addition of the glucose co-transport component sodium (NaCl). Finally, we compared oral detection thresholds for glucose, MDG, fructose, and sucralose without and with the sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT) inhibitor phlorizin. In each experiment, psychopharmacological data were consistent with glucose engaging an additional signaling pathway to the sweet taste receptor T1R2/T1R3 pathway. Na-lactisole addition impaired detection of the non-caloric sweetener sucralose much more than it did glucose, consistent with glucose using an additional signaling pathway. The addition of NaCl had a beneficial impact on the detection of glucose and its analog MDG and impaired sucralose detection, consistent with glucose utilizing a sodium-glucose co-transporter. The addition of the SGLT inhibitor phlorizin impaired detection of glucose and MDG more than it did sucralose, and had no effect on fructose, further evidence consistent with glucose utilizing a sodium-glucose co-transporter. Together, these results support the idea that oral detection of glucose engages two signaling pathways: one that is comprised of the T1R2/T1R3 sweet taste receptor and the other that utilizes an SGLT glucose transporter."
https://openalex.org/W3203914278,"Plant species represent the hierarchical expression of vegetation as it is affected by various environmental gradients. We explored the plant species composition, distribution pattern, communities formation and their respective indicators under the influence of various environmental factors in the Dhirkot region, Azad Jammu and Kashmir. It was hypothesized that different environmental factors were responsible for the formation of various plant communities each with a distinct indicator. Quantitative ecological techniques were used for the sampling of vegetation. A total of 114 quadrats were established in 13 selected sampling sites. Phytosociological attributes were calculated for each plant species at each quadrat. Soil samples were collected and analyzed using different standard protocols. All the collected data were analyzed using Cluster Analysis, Indicator Species Analysis and Canonical Correspondence Analysis of PCORD and CANOCO software, respectively. A total of 145 plant species were recorded belong to 62 different families. Asteraceae and Lamiaceae were the dominant families, represented by 12 species each (8.27%). Cluster Analysis classify all the stations and plants into four major plant communities as 1) Olea-Desmodium-Prunilla community. 2) Abies-Zanthoxylum-Pteracanthus community 3) Cedrus-Elaeagnus-Hypericum community 4) Alnus-Myrsine–Ranunculus community. Soil pH, electrical conductivity, soil saturation, organic matter and altitude were the significant environmental factors that play its essential role in the plant species distribution, composition, formation of major plant communities and their respective indicators in the region. It is recommended that the identified indicator and rare plant species of the investigated area can further be grown for conservation and management purposes in in-situ environment."
https://openalex.org/W3203003754,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic inflammatory disorders characterized by relapsing intestinal inflammation, but many details of pathogenesis remain to be fully unraveled. Glucocorticoid (GC)-induced leucine zipper (GILZ) is a mediator of the anti-inflammatory effects of GCs, the most powerful drugs for IBD treatment, but they cause several unwanted side effects. The fusion protein TAT-GILZ has been successfully used in some pre-clinical models of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. To test the efficacy of TAT-GILZ for treating dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and explore its impact on the gut microbiome, colitis was induced by DSS in C57BL/6J mice and treated with TAT-GILZ or dexamethasone. Various hallmarks of colitis were analyzed, including disease activity index, gut permeability, and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and tight junction proteins. TAT-GILZ treatment showed a therapeutic effect when administered after the onset of colitis. Its efficacy was associated with improved gut permeability, as evidenced by zonula occludens-1 and CD74 upregulation in inflamed colonic tissue. TAT-GILZ also ameliorated the changes in the gut microbiota induced by the DSS, thus potentially providing an optimal environment for colonization of the mucosa surface by beneficial bacteria. Overall, our results demonstrated for the first time that TAT-GILZ treatment proved effective after disease onset allowing restoration of gut permeability, a key pathogenic feature of colitis. Additionally, TAT-GILZ restored gut dysbiosis, thereby contributing to healing mechanisms. Interestingly, we found unprecedented effects of exogenous GILZ that did not overlap with those of GCs."
https://openalex.org/W3203238527,"Emotional sensations and inferring another’s emotional states have been suggested to depend on predictive models of the causes of bodily sensations, so-called interoceptive inferences. In this framework, higher sensibility for interoceptive changes (IS) reflects higher precision of interoceptive signals. The present study examined the link between IS and emotion recognition, testing whether individuals with higher IS recognize others’ emotions more easily and are more sensitive to learn from biased probabilities of emotional expressions. We recorded skin conductance responses (SCRs) from forty-six healthy volunteers performing a speeded-response task, which required them to indicate whether a neutral facial expression dynamically turned into a happy or fearful expression. Moreover, varying probabilities of emotional expressions by their block-wise base rate aimed to generate a bias for the more frequently encountered emotion. As a result, we found that individuals with higher IS showed lower thresholds for emotion recognition, reflected in decreased reaction times for emotional expressions especially of high intensity. Moreover, individuals with increased IS benefited more from a biased probability of an emotion, reflected in decreased reaction times for expected emotions. Lastly, weak evidence supporting a differential modulation of SCR by IS as a function of varying probabilities was found. Our results indicate that higher interoceptive sensibility facilitates the recognition of emotional changes and is accompanied by a more precise adaptation to emotion probabilities."

We aimed to explore how healthcare workers experienced the preparedness period of COVID-19 pandemic, in order to ascertain the perceived weaknesses and strengths.Interviews were conducted with 17 participants encompassing senior physicians, residents, and nurses. They were audio-recorded, and the transcription was verbatim. We used thematic analysis.We identified four themes, with subsequent subthemes: dealing with the unknown, human versus doctors, sense of helplessness, and a bridge to heaven, which explore how healthcare workers experienced the lack of knowledge, their feeling of losing control, and how they managed their internal fights. The disappointment provoked by the authorities and their colleagues was further evaluated. We identified factors involved in their well-being.COVID-19 pandemic represented and will still pose a challenge for healthcare workers (HCWs) from all over the world. They felt unprepared for such a crisis. Further measures should be implemented in every hospital to maintain HCWs awareness and to prevent physical imbalance. Appropriate standards of care should be further stated by the authorities so that the healthcare providers may find easier a balance between their safety and their patients' needs. Conducting qualitative research involving HCWs during pandemic times may help in informing more significant policy decisions."
https://openalex.org/W3203876879,"Rationale Chronic airway infection and inflammation resulting in progressive, obstructive lung disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis. Understanding the lower airway microbiota across the ages can provide valuable insight and potential therapeutic targets. Objectives To characterize and compare the lower airway microbiota in cystic fibrosis and disease control subjects across the pediatric age spectrum. Methods Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from 191 subjects (63 with cystic fibrosis) aged 0 to 21 years were collected along with relevant clinical data. We measured total bacterial load using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize bacterial communities with species-level sensitivity for select genera. Clinical comparisons were investigated. Measurements and main results Cystic fibrosis samples had higher total bacterial load and lower microbial diversity, with a divergence from disease controls around 2–5 years of age, as well as higher neutrophilic inflammation relative to bacterial burden. Cystic fibrosis samples had increased abundance of traditional cystic fibrosis pathogens and decreased abundance of the Streptococcus mitis species group in older subjects. Interestingly, increased diversity in the heterogeneous disease controls was independent of diagnosis and indication. Sequencing was more sensitive than culture, and antibiotic exposure was more common in disease controls, which showed a negative relationship with load and neutrophilic inflammation. Conclusions Analysis of lower airway samples from people with cystic fibrosis and disease controls across the ages revealed key differences in airway microbiota and inflammation. The divergence in subjects during early childhood may represent a window of opportunity for intervention and additional study."
https://openalex.org/W3204582052,"Background Understanding risk factors for short- and long-term COVID-19 outcomes have implications for current guidelines and practice. We study whether early identified risk factors for COVID-19 persist one year later and through varying disease progression trajectories. Methods This was a retrospective study of 6,731 COVID-19 patients presenting to Michigan Medicine between March 10, 2020 and March 10, 2021. We describe disease progression trajectories from diagnosis to potential hospital admission, discharge, readmission, or death. Outcomes pertained to all patients: rate of medical encounters, hospitalization-free survival, and overall survival, and hospitalized patients: discharge versus in-hospital death and readmission. Risk factors included patient age, sex, race, body mass index, and 29 comorbidity conditions. Results Younger, non-Black patients utilized healthcare resources at higher rates, while older, male, and Black patients had higher rates of hospitalization and mortality. Diabetes with complications, coagulopathy, fluid and electrolyte disorders, and blood loss anemia were risk factors for these outcomes. Diabetes with complications, coagulopathy, fluid and electrolyte disorders, and blood loss were associated with lower discharge and higher inpatient mortality rates. Conclusions This study found differences in healthcare utilization and adverse COVID-19 outcomes, as well as differing risk factors for short- and long-term outcomes throughout disease progression. These findings may inform providers in emergency departments or critical care settings of treatment priorities, empower healthcare stakeholders with effective disease management strategies, and aid health policy makers in optimizing allocations of medical resources."
https://openalex.org/W3204702423,"Xylo-oligosaccharide (XOS), which is considered as a potential prebiotic, exhibits multiple beneficial effects on modulation of gut microbiota, strength of intestinal barrier, and inhibition of intestinal inflammation. The objective of this study is to investigate whether XOS protects against Salmonella infection by modulating gut microbiota, enhancing the intestinal barrier, and resisting colonization. C57BL/6 male mice received water supplementation with 5% XOS for 14 days before Salmonella Typhimurium infection. The results showed that XOS suppressed the Salmonella-induced inflammation, but had limited effects on tight junction molecules and mRNA expression of mucus proteins, except for claudin-1 in the colon. Data of 16S rDNA sequencing indicated that XOS modulated gut microbiota composition by significantly stimulating Bifidobacterium animalis (B. animalis), and reducing Salmonella counts. Therefore, the potential protective effects of B. animalis against Salmonella challenge were investigated as well. Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis BB-12 (BB12), which could markedly increase in XOS, was selected to treat mice. Similarly, Salmonella-induced inflammatory reactions were alleviated by BB12 but tight junction molecules and mucin proteins in the colonic tissues were not affected. Administration of BB12 remarkably decreased the copies of Salmonella in cecal digesta post Salmonella infection. Additionally, the decrease concentrations of cecal propionate and total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in Salmonella-infected mice were reversed by BB12 treatment, and propionate performed a strong inhibitory effect on Salmonella growth in vitro. Besides that, BB12 could directly restrict Salmonella proliferation in vitro. Moreover, BB12 reduced the adhesion ability of Salmonella on the Caco-2 cells model. Our results suggest that XOS could be considered as a candidate of functional food to protect against Salmonella infection by stimulating Bifidobacterium, which then resists Salmonella colonization by maintaining the intestinal SCFAs levels and suppressing adhesibility."
https://openalex.org/W3202954343,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic disrupted medical student education, particularly in New York City (NYC). We aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical students' residency choices.The authors conducted a cross-sectional survey of medical students in all years of study at four NYC medical schools (Columbia, Cornell, NYU, and SUNY Downstate). The survey was fielded from 19 Aug 2020 to 21 Sep 2020. Survey questions included items assessing COVID-19 impact on residency choices, personal impact of COVID-19, residency/specialty choices, and factors influencing these choices.A total of 2310 students received the survey, with 547 (23.7%) providing partial responses and 212 (9.2%) providing valid responses for our primary analysis. 59.0% of participants thought that COVID-19 influenced their choice of residency/specialty, with 0.9% saying the influence was to a great extent, 22.2% to some extent, and 35.8% very little. On multivariable analysis, factors that were independently associated with COVID-19 impacting residency choice included low debt ($1 to $99,999: adjOR 2.23, 95%CI 1.02-5.03) compared with no debt and Other race/ethnicity (adjOR 0.26, 95%CI 0.10-0.63) compared with White race/ethnicity. On secondary analysis of all participants answering survey items for logistic regression regardless of survey completion, direct personal impact of COVID-19 was significantly associated with COVID-19 impacting specialty choice (adjOR 1.90, 95%CI 1.04-3.52). Moreover, 24 students (11.6%) reported a change in their top residency choice from before to during/after COVID-19, citing concerns about frontline work, work-life balance, and risk of harm.Our study found that 3 in 5 (59.0%) participants felt that COVID-19 impacted their residency choice, with 11.6% of respondents explicitly changing their top specialty choice. Investigating the impact of the pandemic on medical student residency considerations is crucial to understand how medical career outlooks may change in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3203987729,"Background Despite recent advances in the development and provision of mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) in humanitarian settings, inadequate supervision remains a significant barrier to successful implementation. The present study sought to incorporate broad stakeholder engagement as part of the first phase of development of a new Integrated Model for Supervision (IMS) for use within MHPSS and protection services in humanitarian emergencies. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 26 global mental health professionals. Data was analysed thematically, using a combination of inductive and deductive methods. Codes and themes were validated through co-author cross-checks and through a webinar with an expert advisory group. Results Results reinforce the importance of effective supervision to enhance the quality of interventions and to protect supervisees’ wellbeing. Participants generally agreed that regular, supportive supervision on a one-to-one basis and as a separate system from line management, is the ideal format. The interviews highlight a need for guidance in specific areas, such as monitoring and evaluation, and navigating power imbalances in the supervisory relationship. Several approaches to supervision were described, including some solutions for use in low-resource situations, such as group, peer-to-peer or remote supervision. Conclusion An integrated model for supervision (IMS) should offer a unified framework encompassing a definition of supervision, consolidation of best practice, and goals and guidance for the supervisory process."

https://openalex.org/W3201322086,"Some evidence suggests that people behave more cooperatively and generously when observed or in the presence of images of eyes (termed the ‘watching eyes’ effect). Eye images are thought to trigger feelings of observation, which in turn motivate people to behave more cooperatively to earn a good reputation. However, several recent studies have failed to find evidence of the eyes effect. One possibility is that inconsistent evidence in support of the eyes effect is a product of individual differences in sensitivity or susceptibility to the cue. In fact, some evidence suggests that people who are generally more prosocial are less susceptible to situation-specific reputation-based cues of observation. In this paper, we sought to (1) replicate the eyes effect, (2) replicate the past finding that people who are dispositionally less prosocial are more responsive to observation than people who are more dispositionally more prosocial, and (3) determine if this effect extends to the watching eyes effect. Results from a pre-registered study showed that people did not give more money in a dictator game when decisions were made public or in the presence of eye images, even though participants felt more observed when decisions were public. That is, we failed to replicate the eyes effect and observation effect. An initial, but underpowered, interaction model suggests that egoists give less than prosocials in private, but not public, conditions. This suggests a direction for future research investigating if and how individual differences in prosociality influence observation effects."
https://openalex.org/W3202237787,"Proteolytic ectodomain shedding of membrane proteins is a fundamental mechanism to control the communication between cells and their environment. A key protease for membrane protein shedding is ADAM17, which requires a non-proteolytic subunit, either inactive Rhomboid 1 (iRhom1) or iRhom2 for its activity. While iRhom1 and iRhom2 are co-expressed in most tissues and appear to have largely redundant functions, the brain is an organ with predominant expression of iRhom1. Yet, little is known about the spatio-temporal expression of iRhom1 in mammalian brain and about its function in controlling membrane protein shedding in the nervous system. Here, we demonstrate that iRhom1 is expressed in mouse brain from the prenatal stage to adulthood with a peak in early postnatal development. In the adult mouse brain iRhom1 was widely expressed, including in cortex, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum. Proteomic analysis of the secretome of primary neurons using the hiSPECS method and of cerebrospinal fluid, obtained from iRhom1-deficient and control mice, identified several membrane proteins that require iRhom1 for their shedding in vitro or in vivo. One of these proteins was 'multiple-EGF-like-domains protein 10' (MEGF10), a phagocytic receptor in the brain that is linked to the removal of amyloid β and apoptotic neurons. MEGF10 was further validated as an ADAM17 substrate using ADAM17-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Taken together, this study discovers a role for iRhom1 in controlling membrane protein shedding in the mouse brain, establishes MEGF10 as an iRhom1-dependent ADAM17 substrate and demonstrates that iRhom1 is widely expressed in murine brain."
https://openalex.org/W3202712095,"The jaguar ( Panthera onca ) is one of the most threatened carnivores in the Americas. Despite a long history of research on this charismatic species, to date there have been few systematic efforts to assess its population size and status in most countries across its distribution range. We present here the results of the two National Jaguar Surveys for Mexico, the first national censuses in any country within the species distribution. We estimated jaguar densities from field data collected at 13 localities in 2008–2010 (2010 hereafter) and 11 localities in 2016–2018 (2018 hereafter). We used the 2010 census results as the basis to develop a National Jaguar Conservation Strategy that identified critical issues for jaguar conservation in Mexico. We worked with the Mexican government to implement the conservation strategy and then evaluated its effectivity. To compare the 2010 and 2018 results, we estimated the amount of jaguar-suitable habitat in the entire country based on an ecological niche model for both periods. Suitable jaguar habitat covered ~267,063 km 2 (13.9% of the country’s territory) in 2010 and ~ 288,890 km 2 (~14.8% of the country’s territory) in 2018. Using the most conservative density values for each priority region, we estimated jaguar densities for both the high and low suitable habitats. The total jaguar population was estimated in ~4,000 individuals for 2010 census and ~4,800 for the 2018 census. The Yucatan Peninsula was the region with the largest population, around 2000 jaguars, in both censuses. Our promising results indicate that the actions we proposed in the National Jaguar Conservation Strategy, some of which have been implemented working together with the Federal Government, other NGO’s, and land owners, are improving jaguar conservation in Mexico. The continuation of surveys and monitoring programs of the jaguar populations in Mexico will provide accurate information to design and implement effective, science-based conservation measures to try to ensure that robust jaguar populations remain a permanent fixture of Mexico’s natural heritage."
https://openalex.org/W3203468823,"Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a rare genetic disorder caused primarily by mutations in the histone modifier genes KMT2D and KDM6A. The genes have broad temporal and spatial expression in many organs, resulting in complex phenotypes observed in KS patients. Hypotonia is one of the clinical presentations associated with KS, yet detailed examination of skeletal muscle samples from KS patients has not been reported. We studied the consequences of loss of KMT2D function in both mouse and human muscles. In mice, heterozygous loss of Kmt2d resulted in reduced neuromuscular junction (NMJ) perimeter, decreased muscle cell differentiation in vitro and impaired myofiber regeneration in vivo. Muscle samples from KS patients of different ages showed presence of increased fibrotic tissue interspersed between myofiber fascicles, which was not seen in mouse muscles. Importantly, when Kmt2d-deficient muscle stem cells were transplanted in vivo in a physiologic non-Kabuki environment, their differentiation potential is restored to levels undistinguishable from control cells. Thus, the epigenetic changes due to loss of function of KMT2D appear reversible through a change in milieu, opening a potential therapeutic avenue."
https://openalex.org/W3204524517,"Octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4) is a core regulator in the retention of stemness, invasive, and self-renewal properties in glioma initiating cells (GSCs) and its overexpression inhibits the differentiation of glioma cells promoting tumor cell proliferation. The Pit-Oct-Unc (POU) domain comprising POU-specific domain (POU S ) and POU-type homeodomain (POU HD ) subdomains is the most critical part of the Oct4 for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells from somatic cells that lead to tumor initiation, invasion, posttreatment relapse, and therapeutic resistance. Therefore, the present investigation hunts for natural product inhibitors (NPIs) against the POU HD domain of Oct4 by employing receptor-based virtual screening (RBVS) followed by binding free energy calculation and molecular dynamics simulation (MDS). RBVS provided 13 compounds with acceptable ranges of pharmacokinetic properties and good docking scores having key interactions with the POU HD domain. More Specifically, conformational and interaction stability analysis of 13 compounds through MDS unveiled two compounds ZINC02145000 and ZINC32124203 which stabilized the backbone of protein even in the presence of linker and POU S domain. Additionally, ZINC02145000 and ZINC32124203 exhibited stable and strong interactions with key residues W277, R242, and R234 of the POU HD domain even in dynamic conditions. Interestingly, ZINC02145000 and ZINC32124203 established communication not only with the POU HD domain but also with the POU S domain indicating their incredible potency toward thwarting the function of Oct4. ZINC02145000 and ZINC32124203 also reduced the flexibility and escalated the correlations between the amino acid residues of Oct4 evidenced by PCA and DCCM analysis. Finally, our examination proposed two NPIs that can impede the Oct4 function and may help to improve overall survival, diminish tumor relapse, and achieve a cure not only in deadly disease GBM but also in other cancers with minimal side effects."
https://openalex.org/W3204881076,"Islet transplantation is being considered as an alternative treatment for type 1 diabetes. Despite recent progress, transplant recipients continue to experience progressive loss of insulin independence. Cyanidin-3-O-Glucoside (C3G) has shown to be protective against damage that may lead to post-transplant islet loss. In this study, human islets cultured with or without C3G were treated with human amylin, Aβ 1-42 , H 2 O 2 , or rapamycin to mimic stresses encountered in the post-transplant environment. Samples of these islets were collected and assayed to determine C3G’s effect on cell viability and function, reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative stress, amyloid formation, and the presence of inflammatory as well as autophagic markers. C3G treatment of human islets exposed to either amylin or Aβ 1-42 increased cell viability (p&lt;0.01) and inhibited amyloid formation (p&lt;0.01). A reduction in ROS and an increase in HO-1 gene expression as well as in vitro islet function were also observed in C3G-treated islets exposed to amylin or Aβ 1-42 , although not significantly. Additionally, treatment with C3G resulted in a significant reduction in the protein expression of inflammatory markers IL-1β and NLRP3 (p&lt;0.01) as well as an increase in LC3 autophagic marker (p&lt;0.05) in human islets treated with amylin, Aβ 1-42 , rapamycin, or H 2 O 2 . Thus, C3G appears to have a multi-faceted protective effect on human islets in vitro , possibly through its anti-oxidant property and alteration of inflammatory as well as autophagic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W3201694989,"Candida is an opportunistic pathogen and a common cause of fungal infections worldwide. Anti-fungal use against Candida infections has resulted in the appearance of resistant strains. The limited choice of anti-fungal therapy means alternative strategies are needed to control fungal infectious diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the inhibition of Candida biofilm formation by Hedera rhombea (Korean name: songak) extract. Biofilm formation was assessed using the crystal violet assay which showed a dose dependent reduction in the presence of extract with the biofilm formation inhibitory concentration of C . albicans (IC 50 = 12.5μg/ml ) , C . tropicalis var . tropicalis (IC 50 = 25μg/ml), C . parapsilosis var . parapsilosis (IC 50 = 6.25μg/ml), C . glabrata (IC 50 = 6.25μg/ml), C . tropicalis (IC 50 = 12.5μg/ml), and C . parapsilosis (IC 50 = 12.5μg/ml) without directly reducing Candida growth. Treatment with 6.25μg/mL of extract increased the antifungal susceptibility to miconazole from 32% decreasing of fungal growth to 98.8% of that based on the fungal growth assay. Treatment of extract dose-dependently reduced the dimorphic transition of Candida based on the dimorphic transition assay and treatment of 3.125μg/mL of extract completely blocked the adherence of Candida to the HaCaT cells. To know the molecular mechanisms of biofilm formation inhibition by extract, qRT-PCR analysis was done, and the extract was found to dose dependently reduce the expression of hyphal-associated genes ( ALS3 , ECE1 , HWP1 , PGA50 , and PBR1 ), extracellular matrix genes ( GSC1 , ZAP1 , ADH5 , and CSH1 ), Ras1-cAMP-PKA pathway genes ( CYR1 , EFG1 , and RAS1 ), Cph2-Tec1 pathway gene ( TEC1 ) and MAP kinases pathway gene ( HST7 ). In this study, Hedera rhombea extract showed inhibition of fungal biofilm formation, activation of antifungal susceptibility, and reduction of infection. These results suggest that fungal biofilm formation is good screen for developing the antifungal adjuvant and Hedera rhombea extract should be a good candidate against biofilm-related fungal infection."
https://openalex.org/W3202342324,"Objectives We investigated whether perceived social support among adolescent students moderated the association between violence exposure and internalising symptoms in São Paulo city, Brazil. Methods We tested the stress-buffering model using data from the cross-sectional school-based, survey São Paulo Project on the Social Development of Children and Adolescents. Internalising symptoms were measured using an adapted version of the Social Behaviour Questionnaire; serious victimisation, being bullied once/week, school violence and community violence, friend and teacher support were scales adapted by the research team; the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire measured parenting style. Linear mixed-effects models were used to quantify moderation effects of (i) social support between violence exposure and internalising symptoms and (ii) gender between violence exposure and internalising symptoms across schools. Results Across schools, being bullied once/week, school violence, and community violence were associated with a significant ( p&lt; 0.001) increase in internalising symptoms (e.g., bullied b = 5.76, 95% CI 2.26, 9.26; school violence b = 0.48, 95% CI 0.30, 0.67; community violence b = 0.36; 95% CI 0.22, 0.50). Males exposed to all types of violence had significantly lower ( p&lt; 0.01) internalising symptoms compared to females (e.g., serious victimisation: b = -1.45; 95% CI -2.60, -0.29; school violence b = -0.27; 95% CI -0.30, -0.24; community violence b = -0.23; 95% CI -0.25, -0.20). As a main effect, social support was associated with a significant ( p&lt; 0.01) decrease in internalising symptoms across schools (e.g., positive parenting b = -2.42; 95% CI -3.12, -1.72; parent involvement b = -2.75; 95% CI -3.32, -2.17; friend support b = -1.05; 95% CI -1.74, -0.34; teacher support b = -0.90; 95% CI -1.58, -0.22). Social support did not moderate the association between violence exposure and internalising symptoms. Conclusions Adolescent students in São Paulo exposed to violence have a higher likelihood of internalising symptoms, compared to those who are not. Support from parents, friends, and teachers, independent of violence, appear to be protective against internalising symptoms, pointing to potential programmes that could improve adolescent mental health."
https://openalex.org/W3204666094,"Abstract RNF6 is a RING finger protein with oncogenic potential. In this study, we established colon-specific RNF6 transgenic (tg) mice, and demonstrated that RNF6 overexpression accelerated colorectal carcinogenesis compared to wild-type littermates in a chemically induced colorectal cancer (CRC) model. To understand whether transcriptional activity of RNF6 underlies its oncogenic effect, we performed integrated chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing and RNA-sequencing analysis to identify splicing factor 3b subunit 2 (SF3B2) as a potential downstream target of RNF6. RNF6 binds to the SF3B2 promoter and the overexpression of RNF6 activates SF3B2 expression in CRC cells, primary CRC organoids, and RNF6 tg mice. SF3B2 knockout abrogated the tumor promoting effect of RNF6 overexpression, whereas the reexpression of SF3B2 recused cell growth and migration/invasion in RNF6 knockout cells, indicating that SF3B2 is a functional downstream target of RNF6 in CRC. Targeting of RNF6-SF3B2 axis with SF3B2 inhibitor with pladienolide B suppressed the growth of CRC cells with RNF6 overexpression in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) plus pladienolide B exerted synergistic effects in CRC with high RNF6 expression, leading to tumor regression in xenograft models. These findings indicate that tumor promoting effect of RNF6 is achieved mainly via transcriptional upregulation of SF3B2, and that RNF6-SF3B2 axis is a promising target for CRC therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3204669460,"Bird nests in natural history collections are an abundant yet vastly underutilized source of genetic information. We sequenced the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer to identify plant species used as nest material in two contemporary (2003 and 2018) and two historical (both 1915) nest specimens constructed by Song Sparrows ( Melospiza melodia ) and Savannah Sparrows ( Passerculus sandwichensis ). A total of 13 (22%) samples yielded single, strong bands that could be identified using GenBank resources: six plants (Angiospermae), six green algae (Chlorophyta), and one ciliate (Ciliophora). Two native plant species identified in the nests included Festuca microstachys , which was introduced to the nest collection site by restoration practitioners, and Rosa californica , identified in a nest collected from a lost habitat that existed about 100 years ago. Successful sequencing was correlated with higher sample mass and DNA quality, suggesting future studies should select larger pieces of contiguous material from nests and materials that appear to have been fresh when incorporated into the nest. This molecular approach was used to distinguish plant species that were not visually identifiable, and did not require disassembling the nest specimens as is a traditional practice with nest material studies. The many thousands of nest specimens in natural history collections hold great promise as sources of genetic information to address myriad ecological questions."
https://openalex.org/W3202166425,"Purpose Albumin has been shown to be safe and effective in clinical practice for a wide variety of indications. The purpose of this medication use evaluation is to quantify the use of albumin in the community hospital setting based on indication and prescribing department. Methods This study is a retrospective, single-center, chart review over a 6-month period of 186 patients aged 18 and older who were treated with IV human albumin 5% or 25% at a single 202-bed community hospital setting from February 1, 2020, to August 1, 2020. A chart review was completed for each patient and the data collected included date of albumin administration, the ordering provider, the specialty of the provider, the indication for albumin as stated in the order, patient notes, crystalloid therapy use prior to albumin, albumin strength, the presence of acute or chronic renal, hepatic or respiratory disorders, and lab values denoting renal and hepatic function. Appropriate albumin use was determined utilizing criteria which included FDA labeled indications, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, and existing literature. Results A total of 186 patients received albumin 5% or 25% IV solution at least once during the study period. The study population was 52.2% female, and the average age was 68 years. Of the patients selected for the study, 23 (11.6%) had chronic hepatic disease, and 37 (18.7%) had chronic renal disease. The top indications for which albumin was administered were sepsis or septic shock (25.3%), hypotension or hypovolemia (19.4%), intra-dialytic hypotension (13.4%), fluid support in surgery (10.8%), and nephrosis or nephropathy (10.8%). The departments with highest albumin use during this study period were critical care (41%), nephrology (28%), and surgery (17%). Overall, albumin was used for an appropriate indication in 126 out of 186 patients (67.7%). Conclusion We found that albumin was most utilized for sepsis and septic shock, hypovolemia and hypotension, and intradialytic hypotension in our community hospital setting and it was most frequently ordered by critical care, nephrology, and surgical departments. Further research could determine if this trend is seen in other community hospital settings."
https://openalex.org/W3203309024,"With the advent of high-throughput technologies, life sciences are generating a huge amount of varied biomolecular data. Global gene expression profiles provide a snapshot of all the genes that are transcribed in a cell or in a tissue under a particular condition. The high-dimensionality of such gene expression data ( i . e ., very large number of features/genes analyzed with relatively much less number of samples) makes it difficult to identify the key genes (biomarkers) that are truly attributing to a particular phenotype or condition, (such as cancer), de novo . For identifying the key genes from gene expression data, among the existing literature, mutual information (MI) is one of the most successful criteria. However, the correction of MI for finite sample is not taken into account in this regard. It is also important to incorporate dynamic discretization of genes for more relevant gene selection, although this is not considered in the available methods. Besides, it is usually suggested in current studies to remove redundant genes which is particularly inappropriate for biological data, as a group of genes may connect to each other for downstreaming proteins. Thus, despite being redundant, it is needed to add the genes which provide additional useful information for the disease. Addressing these issues, we proposed Mutual information based Gene Selection method ( MGS ) for selecting informative genes. Moreover, to rank these selected genes, we extended MGS and propose two ranking methods on the selected genes, such as MGS f —based on frequency and MGS rf —based on Random Forest. The proposed method not only obtained better classification rates on gene expression datasets derived from different gene expression studies compared to recently reported methods but also detected the key genes relevant to pathways with a causal relationship to the disease, which indicate that it will also able to find the responsible genes for an unknown disease data."
https://openalex.org/W3203749651,"Mitochondrial changes such as tight coupling of the mitochondria have facilitated sustained oxygen and respiratory activity in haemoglobin-less icefish of the Channichthyidae family. We aimed to characterise features in the sequence and structure of the proteins directly involved in proton transport, which have potential physiological implications. ATP synthase subunit a (ATP6) and subunit 8 (ATP8) are proteins that function as part of the F0 component (proton pump) of the F0F1complex. Both proteins are encoded by the mitochondrial genome and involved in oxidative phosphorylation. To explore mitochondrial sequence variation for ATP6 and ATP8 we analysed sequences from C. gunnari and C. rastrospinosus and compared them with their closely related red-blooded species and eight other vertebrate species. Our comparison of the amino acid sequence of these proteins reveals important differences that could underlie aspects of the unique physiology of the icefish. In this study we find that changes in the sequence of subunit a of the icefish C. gunnari at position 35 where there is a hydrophobic alanine which is not seen in the other notothenioids we analysed. An amino acid change of this type is significant since it may have a structural impact. The biology of the haemoglobin-less icefish is necessarily unique and any insights about these animals will help to generate a better overall understanding of important physiological pathways."
https://openalex.org/W3204317086,"The most important precondition for correction of the affected forearm using data from the contralateral side is that the left and right bone features must be similar, in order to develop patient-specific instruments (PSIs) and/or utilize computer-assisted orthopedic surgery (CAOS). The forearm has complex anatomical structure, and most people use their dominant hand more than their less dominant hand, sometimes resulting in asymmetry of the upper limbs. The aim of this study is to investigate differences of the bilateral forearm bones through a quantitative comparison of whole bone parameters including length, volume, bowing, and twisting parameters, and regional shape differences of the forearm bones. In total, 132 bilateral 3D radii and ulnae 3D models were obtained from CT images, whole bone parameters and regional shape were analyzed. Statistically significant differences in whole bone parameters were not shown. Regionally, the radius shows asymmetry in the upper section of the central part to the upper section of the distal part. The ulna shows asymmetry in the lower section of the proximal part to the lower section of the central part. Utilizing contralateral side forearm bones to correct the affected side may be feasible despite regional differences in the forearm bones of around 0.5 mm."
https://openalex.org/W3204687112,"Large-scale ecological sampling can be difficult and costly, especially for organisms that are too small to be easily identified in a natural environment by eye. Typically, these microscopic floral and fauna are sampled by collecting substrates from nature and then separating organisms from substrates in the laboratory. In many cases, diverse organisms can be identified to the species-level using molecular barcodes. To facilitate large-scale ecological sampling of microscopic organisms, we used a geographic data-collection platform for mobile devices called Fulcrum that streamlines the organization of geospatial sampling data, substrate photographs, and environmental data at natural sampling sites. These sampling data are then linked to organism isolation data from the laboratory. Here, we describe the easyFulcrum R package, which can be used to clean, process, and visualize ecological field sampling and isolation data exported from the Fulcrum mobile application. We developed this package for wild nematode sampling, but it can be used with other organisms. The advantages of using Fulcrum combined with easyFulcrum are (1) the elimination of transcription errors by replacing manual data entry and/or spreadsheets with a mobile application, (2) the ability to clean, process, and visualize sampling data using a standardized set of functions in the R software environment, and (3) the ability to join disparate data to each other, including environmental data from the field and the molecularly defined identities of individual specimens isolated from samples."
https://openalex.org/W3204954389,"The current study used RNA sequencing to determine transcriptional profiles of equine endometrium collected 14, 22, and 28 days after ovulation from pregnant mares. In addition, the transcriptomes of endometrial samples obtained 20 days after ovulation from pregnant mares, and from non-pregnant mares which displayed and failed to display extended luteal function following the administration of oxytocin, were determined and compared in order to delineate genes whose expressions depend on the presence of the conceptus as opposed to elevated progesterone alone. A mere fifty-five transcripts were differentially expressed between samples collected from mares at Day 22 and Day 28 of pregnancy. This likely reflects the longer-term exposure to a relatively constant, progesterone-dominated environment with little change in factors secreted by the conceptus that would affect endometrial gene expression. The complement system was amongst the canonical pathways significantly enriched in transcripts differentially expressed between Day 14 and Day 22/28 of pregnancy. The expression of complement components 7 and 8 was confirmed using in situ hybridization. The expression of SERPING1, an inhibitor of the complement system, was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. In line with the resumed capacity of the endometrium to produce prostaglandin, prostaglandin G/H synthase 1 was expressed at higher levels at Days 22 and 28 than at Day 14 of pregnancy. Our data suggest that this up-regulation is enhanced by the presence of the conceptus; samples obtained from mares at Day 20 of pregnancy had significantly higher levels of prostaglandin G/H synthase 1 transcript than mares with extended luteal function."
https://openalex.org/W3202283393,"As life expectancy has increased, a growing number of people experience conditions, including cancers, that carry complex health and social needs. Palliative care services have the potential to address these needs but face significant obstacles. One major obstacle is suboptimal interprofessional collaboration. This study’s goal was an in-depth exploration of interactional and organizational barriers and supports of collaboration in palliative care in Switzerland. We sought the perspectives of health care professionals, patients’ family members and leaders and experts in oncology/palliative care delivery (key informants) through interviews and focus groups with fifty HPs and key informants and ten patients’ family members. Qualitative analyses of interviews and focus groups used framework analysis. We identified three major themes of interaction: personal characteristics, communication, and connectedness with other health care professionals; and three major organizational themes: service characteristics, standardized communication and processes, and service coordination and promotion. Based on our findings, we recommend that health care professionals consider strategies to increase their collaboration and communication skills and opportunities to interact. We advocate the implementation of methods for coordinating services, standardization of consultation/referral procedures and communication between health care professionals, and the promotion of underutilized services to foster successful, sustainable collaboration."
https://openalex.org/W3203608337,"This study aimed to investigate the association among self-evaluations—such as self-esteem and self-efficacy—self report of depression, and perceived stress among Korean individuals with disabilities. Data from the second wave of the Panel Survey of Employment for the Disabled (collected from 2016–2018) were used. In 2016 and the follow-up in 2018, 4,033 participants were included. We estimated the annual change in both independent variables and the probability of self-report of depression and stress. Generalized estimating equation model and chi-square test were used. Compared with those whose self-esteem and self-efficacy scores were ≥30, those with scores ≤19 were, respectively, 5.825 (95% Confidence Interval [ CI ]: 4.235–8.011; p &lt; .0001) and 1.494 times (95% CI : 1.233–1.810; p &lt; .0001) more likely to have self-report of depression. The perceived stress of those with self-esteem scores ≤19 or ranging from 20–24 were, respectively, 2.036 (95% CI : 1.510–2.747; p &lt; .0001) and 1.451 times higher (95% CI : 1.269–1.659; p &lt; .0001) than those with self-esteem scores ≥30. There exists an inverse correlation between self-evaluations, such as self-efficacy and self-esteem, and mental health in people with disabilities. The results of this study can be used as a basis for developing interventional strategies and training and intervention programs for people with disabilities. Future research is needed to investigate potential mediating factors among Korean individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3203979233,"In Borneo, oil palm plantations have replaced much of natural resources, where generalist species tend to be the principal beneficiaries, due to the abundant food provided by oil palm plantations. Here, we analyse the distribution of the Asian water monitor lizard ( Varanus salvator ) population within an oil palm-dominated landscape in the Kinabatangan floodplain, Malaysian Borneo. By using mark-recapture methods we estimated its population size, survival, and growth in forest and plantation habitats. We compared body measurements ( i . e . body weight and body length) of individuals living in forest and oil palm habitats as proxy for the population’s health status, and used general least squares estimation models to evaluate its response to highly fragmented landscapes in the absence of intensive hunting pressures. Contrary to previous studies, the abundance of lizards was higher in the forest than in oil palm plantations. Recruitment rates were also higher in the forest, suggesting that these areas may function as a source of new individuals into the landscape. While there were no morphometric differences among plantation sites, we found significant differences among forested areas, where larger lizards were found inhabiting forest adjacent to oil palm plantations. Although abundant in food resources, the limited availability of refugia in oil palm plantations may intensify intra-specific encounters and competition, altering the body size distribution in plantation populations, contrary to what happens in the forest. We conclude that large patches of forest, around and within oil palm plantations, are essential for the dynamics of the monitor lizard population in the Kinabatangan floodplain, as well as a potential source of individuals to the landscape. We recommend assessing this effect in other generalist species, as well as the impact on the prey communities, especially to reinforce the establishment of buffer zones and corridors as a conservation strategy within plantations."
https://openalex.org/W3204695807,"During the early months of the current COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing measures effectively slowed disease transmission in many countries in Europe and Asia, but the same benefits have not been observed in some developing countries such as Brazil. In part, this is due to a failure to organise systematic testing campaigns at nationwide or even regional levels. To gain effective control of the pandemic, decision-makers in developing countries, particularly those with large populations, must overcome difficulties posed by an unequal distribution of wealth combined with low daily testing capacities. The economic infrastructure of these countries, often concentrated in a few cities, forces workers to travel from commuter cities and rural areas, which induces strong nonlinear effects on disease transmission. In the present study, we develop a smart testing strategy to identify geographic regions where COVID-19 testing could most effectively be deployed to limit further disease transmission. By smart testing we mean the testing protocol that is automatically designed by our optimization platform for a given time period, knowing the available number of tests, the current availability of ICU beds and the initial epidemiological situation. The strategy uses readily available anonymised mobility and demographic data integrated with intensive care unit (ICU) occupancy data and city-specific social distancing measures. Taking into account the heterogeneity of ICU bed occupancy in differing regions and the stages of disease evolution, we use a data-driven study of the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo as an example to show that smart testing strategies can rapidly limit transmission while reducing the need for social distancing measures, even when testing capacity is limited."
https://openalex.org/W3204748641,"The misalignment of eating time and the endogenous circadian rhythm impairs the body's ability to maintain homeostasis. Although it is well established that children and growing animals differ from adults in their energy metabolism and behavioral patterns, little is known about how mistimed feeding disturbs the diurnal rhythms of behavior and metabolism in children and growing diurnal animals. In this study, growing pigs (diurnal animal) were randomly assigned to the daytime-restricted feeding (DRF) and nighttime-restricted feeding (NRF) groups for 5 weeks. Compared with observations in the DRF group, NRF disrupted the diurnal rhythm of behavior and clock genes and lowered the serum ghrelin, dopamine, and serotonin levels during the daytime and nighttime. Microbiome analysis results suggested that NRF altered the diurnal rhythm and composition of the gut microbiota, and increased log-ratios of Catenibacterium:Butyrivibrio and Streptococcus:Butyrivibrio. Based on the serum proteome, the results further revealed that rhythmic and upregulated proteins in NRF were mainly involved in oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, immunity, and cancer biological pathways. Serum physiological indicators further confirmed that NRF decreased the concentration of melatonin and fibroblast growth factor 21 during the daytime and nighttime, increased the diurnal amplitude and concentrations of very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, and total cholesterol, and increased the apolipoprotein B/ApoA1 ratio, which is a marker of metabolic syndrome. Taken together, this study is the first to reveal that mistimed feeding disrupts the behavioral rhythms of growing pigs, reprograms gut microbiota composition, reduces the serum levels of hormones associated with fighting depression and anxiety, and increases the risk of lipid metabolic dysregulation."
https://openalex.org/W3202083525,"Comparison of the severity, frequency and self-reporting of pollution incidents by water and sewerage companies is made difficult by differences in environmental and operational conditions. In England, the deterioration in pollution incident performance makes it important to investigate common trends that could be addressed to improve pollution management. This study presents the first external analysis of available national pollution incident data, obtained through Environmental Information Regulations 2004 requests to the English Environment Agency. The study aimed to assess and compare the pollution incident performance of water and sewerage companies in England. Results indicated that there were significant variations in numbers of pollution incidents reported and the severity of the impact on the water environment for different asset types (operational property). There were significant positive relationships between the self-reporting percentages and total numbers of reported pollution incidents per 10,000 km sewer length for pumping stations and sewage treatment works. These results indicate that in at least these asset types, an estimated 5% of pollution incidents could go unreported. Pollution events that go unreported can lead to more severe impacts to the water environment, so rapid and consistent reporting of incidents is crucial for limiting damage. The results have significance for the water industry internationally, because the issues presented here are not restricted to England. In the short-term, research should focus on investigating best practice and standardising reporting of pollution incidents, so that an accurate baseline of the number of pollution incidents occurring can be determined."
https://openalex.org/W3202270808,"To date, little attempt has been made to develop new treatments for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), although the community is aware of the shortage of treatments for H. pylori. In this study, we developed a 192-tandem-microwell-based high-throughput assay for ammonia that is a known virulence factor of H. pylori and a product of urease. We could identify few drugs, that is, panobinostat, dacinostat, ebselen, captan, and disulfiram, to potently inhibit the activity of ureases from bacterial or plant species. These inhibitors suppress the activity of urease via substrate-competitive or covalent-allosteric mechanism, but all except captan prevent the antibiotic-resistant H. pylori strain from killing human gastric cells, with a more pronounced effect than acetohydroxamic acid, a well-known urease inhibitor and clinically used drug for the treatment of bacterial infection. This study offers several bases for the development of new treatments for urease-containing pathogens and to study the mechanism responsible for the regulation of urease activity."
https://openalex.org/W3203100760,"A new IoT (Internet of Things) analysis platform is designed based on edge computing and cloud collaboration from the perspective of organizational behavior, to fundamentally understand the relationship between enterprise career maturity and career planning, and meet the actual needs of enterprises. The performance of the proposed model is further determined according to the characteristic of the edge near data sources, with the help of factor analysis, and through the study and analysis of relevant enterprise data. The model is finally used to analyze the relationship between enterprise career maturity and career planning through simulation experiments. The research results prove that career maturity positively affects career planning, and vocational delay of gratification plays a mediating role in career maturity and career planning. Besides, the content of career choice in career maturity is influenced by mental acuity, result acuity and loyalty. The experimental results indicate that when the load at both ends of the edge and cloud exceeds 80%, the edge delay of the IoT analysis platform based on edge computing and cloud collaboration is 10s faster than that of other models. Meanwhile, the system slowdown is reduced by 36% while the stability is increased when the IoT analysis platform analyzes data. The results of the edge-cloud collaboration scheduling scheme are similar to all scheduling to the edge end, which saves 19% of the time compared with cloud computing to the cloud end. In Optical Character Recognition and Aeneas, compared with the single edge-cloud coordination mode, the model with the Nesterov Accelerated Gradient algorithm achieves the optimal performance. Specifically, the communication delay is reduced by about 25% on average, and the communication time decreased by 61% compared with cloud computing to the edge end. This work has significant reference value for analyzing the relationship between enterprise psychology, behavior, and career planning."

The dataset contains baseline patient characteristics, breathing support required, pharmacological treatment received and multiple markers on daily resolution. Patients in the dataset were treated with hydroxychloroquine (N = 108), azithromycin (N = 72), favipiravir (N = 9), convalescent plasma (N = 7), dexamethasone (N = 4) and remdesivir (N = 3), often in combination. To explore association between treatments and patient outcomes we performed multiverse analysis, observing how the conclusions change between defensible choices of statistical model, predictors included in the model and other analytical degrees of freedom. Weak evidence to constrain the potential efficacy of azithromycin and favipiravir can be extracted from the data. Additionally, we performed external validation of several proposed prognostic models for Covid-19 severity showing that they mostly perform unsatisfactorily on our dataset."
https://openalex.org/W3204221145,"Introduction Myelomeningocele is a severe type of spina bifida, resulting from improper closure of the neural tube. This condition drastically affects the structures of the spinal cord resulting in deficiencies. The combination of these deficiencies results in an overall decrease in mobility and functional participation amongst this population. Physiotherapy plays an essential role in rehabilitating people with MMC. The current literature shows that resources such as photobiomodulation (PBM) may support the rehabilitation of neurological conditions. The aim of the proposed study is to evaluate the effects of photobiomodulation (PBM) combined with physical therapy on functional performance in children with low lumbosacral myelomeningocele. Materials and methods This is a protocol randomized clinical blind study, that will include 30 individuals of both sexes, aged between 5 to 8 years, diagnosed with low and sacral lumbar myelomeningocele and capable of performing the sit-to-stand task. The participants will be randomly assigned into two treatment groups: PBM + physiotherapeutic exercises and sham PBM + physiotherapeutic exercises. Irradiation will be carried out with light emitting diode (LED) at a wavelength of 850 nm, energy of 25 J per point, 50 seconds per point and a power of 200 mW. The same device will be used in the placebo group but will not emit light. Muscle activity will be assessed using a portable electromyograph (BTS Engineering) and the sit-to-stand task will be performed as a measure of functioning. Electrodes will be positioned on the lateral gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior and rectus femoris muscles. The Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory will be used to assess functional independence. Quality of life will be assessed using the Child Health Questionnaire—Parent Form 50. Changes in participation will be assessed using the Participation and Environment Measure for Children and Youth. The data will be analyzed with the aid of GraphPad PRISM.

https://openalex.org/W3204771450,"To choose exercise over alternative behaviours, subjective reward evaluation of the potential choices is a principal step in decision making. However, the selection of exercise intensity might integrate acute visceral responses (i.e. pleasant or unpleasant feelings) and motives related to goals (i.e. enjoyment, competition, health). To understand the factors determining the selection of exercise in its intensity and evaluation as a modality, we conducted a study combining exercise training and evaluative conditioning. Evaluative conditioning was performed by using a novel technique using a primary reinforcer (sweetness) as the unconditioned stimulus and physical strain i.e. heart rate elevation as the conditioned stimulus during interval training, using a randomized control design (N = 58). Pre, post-three weeks interval training w/o conditioning, and after 4 weeks follow-up, participants were tested on self-paced speed selection on treadmill measuring heart rate, subjective pleasantness, and effort levels, as well as delay-discounting of exercise and food rewards. Results revealed that the selection of exercise intensity was significantly increased by adaptation to training and evaluative conditioning, revealing the importance of visceral factors as well as learned expected rewards. Delay discounting rates of self-paced exercise were transiently reduced by training but not affected by evaluative conditioning. In conclusion, exercise decisions are suggested to separate the decision-making process into a modality-specific cognitive evaluation of exercise, and an exercise intensity selection based on acute visceral experience integrating effort, pleasantness, and learned rewards."
https://openalex.org/W3201702335,"Introduction This article presents the Louisiana Hepatitis C Elimination Program’s evaluation protocol underway at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center–New Orleans. With the availability of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents, the elimination of Hepatitis C (HCV) has become a possibility. The HCV Elimination Program was initiated by the Louisiana Department of Health (LDH) Office of Public Health (OPH), LDH Bureau of Health Services Financing (Medicaid), and the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections (DPSC) to provide HCV treatment through an innovative pricing arrangement with Asegua Therapeutics, whereby a fixed cost is set for a supply of treatment over five years. Materials and methods A cross-sectional study design will be used. Data will be gathered from two sources: 1) an online survey administered via REDCap to a sample of Medicaid members who are receiving HCV treatment, and 2) a de-identified data set that includes both Medicaid claims data and OPH surveillance data procured via a Data Use Agreement between LSUHSC-NO and Louisiana Medicaid. Discussion The evaluation will contribute to an understanding of the scope and reach of this innovative treatment model, and as a result, an understanding of areas for improvement. Further, this evaluation may provide insight for other states considering similar contracting mechanisms and programs."
https://openalex.org/W3202158931,"Background As population aging progresses, volunteers in health field are expected to play a key role in health promotion and disease prevention, which may improve community residents’ health and well-being and at the same time help slow the growth of healthcare cost. The objective of this study is to examine the effects of self-oriented motives and altruistic motives as explanatory factors for Japanese Community Health Workers (CHWs)’ desire to continue their service. Unraveling the relative effects of these two types of motivation on CHW retention may lead to policy and practical implications for recruiting, training, and supporting CHWs in Japan. Haddad (2007) observed that citizens in Japan generally have a sense of governmental and individual responsibility for dealing with social problems. Applying these insights to CHWs, we hypothesize that altruistic motives have more potent influence on volunteers’ willingness to continue to serve than self-oriented motives. Methods Three cities in Shiga prefecture, Japan agreed to participate in the study. Anonymous, self-administered questionnaire was mailed to all CHWs who work in the three communities. The survey data were collected in March and April, 2013. A total of 417 questionnaires were mailed to CHWs, of which 346 were completed and returned (response rate 83.0%). Nine questionnaires missing response to the question concerning willingness to continue serving were removed from the analysis. The final analysis used 337 questionnaires (effective response rate 80.8%). Results One hundred ninety-nine (59.1%) of the respondents answered the question about willingness to continue CHW affirmatively, and 138 (40.9%) negatively. Controlling for other relevant factors, those with self-oriented motives in serving as CHWs were more likely to state they are willing to continue to serve (OR:1.54, confidence interval 1.00–2.37) than those without such motives. Those with altruistic motives were also more likely to say they want to continue their service (OR 1.56, confidence interval 1.08–2.27) than those without such motives. Contrary to our hypothesis, the two motives, altruistic and self-oriented, were shown to have nearly equal degree of influence on respondents’ willingness to continue serving as CHWs. Conclusion One practical implication of the research is that learning more about the twin motives, self-oriented and altruistic, of volunteers and tailoring the content of CHW training by municipal health professionals to address those motives may be beneficial."
https://openalex.org/W3202298204,"To investigate whether dental status, represented by the DMFT score, was affected by the presence of NCDs and determined the NCDs that had a greater impact on the DMFT score. This retrospective cross-sectional study included a total of 10,017 individuals. The presence of NCDs was investigated based on self-reported medical history recorded on each patient’s dental hospital record. Individual DMFT score was evaluated on the basis of the dental records and panoramic radiographs. The data were further analyzed using multiple regression analysis and chi-squared automatic interaction detection (CHAID) analysis. A total of 5,388 individuals had more than one NCD among hypertension (HT), diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and osteoporosis. The average DMFT score was 8.62 ± 7.10 in the NCD group, significantly higher than that in those without NCD (5.53 ± 5.48) ( P &lt; 0.001). In the regression analysis, age, NCDs, and psychiatric problems were selected as risk factors of DMFT score. In the CHAID decision tree analysis, age was the risk factor that most influenced the DMFT score. HT was the most influential factor in a newly generated decision tree excluding age, and osteoporosis, DM, and CVD were important risk factors acting in the subgroups. Patients with NCD had worse dental conditions than those who did not, and some combinations of NCDs related highest risk for a dental caries-related index. In clinical practice, dentists should provide meticulous care for dental caries in elderly patients with NCDs, especially when certain diseases, such as HT, osteoporosis, DM, and CVD, are present together."
https://openalex.org/W3204515373,"Background Oxytocin is recommended as an affordable and effective drug in the prevention of postpartum hemorrhage—one of the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income countries, however, there are concerns about its proper use and quality. This study builds on earlier work conducted in a South-Western state in Nigeria. Objective The study assessed the knowledge around oxytocin, usage, storage practices and perceived quality of oxytocin used by healthcare providers that directly administer oxytocin for the prevention of postpartum hemorrhage across Nigeria. Methods This was a descriptive cross-sectional study that surveyed a representative sample of 6,299 healthcare providers who offer obstetrics and gynecological services and recruited from 1,894 healthcare facilities in Public and Private sectors in 12 states across Nigeria. Data were collected using an electronic questionnaire, analyzed using SPSS, and presented in frequencies and percentages. Results Only forty-six percent of respondents (52.8% in private; 40.0% in public sector) had proper knowledge that oxytocin storage is in the refrigerator. Proper knowledge also varied by professional cadre, doctors (71.2%); nurses (46.6%); Community Health Workers (28.4%) and by years of experience, less than 10 years (51.4%); more than 10 years (40.8%). Only 34% of the respondents (41% in private and 27.5% in public sector) reported good practices that oxytocin is stored in the refrigerator in their facilities. Most healthcare providers used oxytocin for prevention of PPH (77.9%). Oxytocin was also used for augmentation (66.7%) and induction of labor (52.6%). Half of respondents used above the WHO-recommended oxytocin dose of 10IU for prevention of PPH. Twenty-three percent of respondents reported experiencing oxytocin failure in PPH prevention of whom, 54.3% changed to another uterotonic and 37.1% doubled the dose of oxytocin for their patients. Conclusion Our study findings should be used to establish clinical guidelines and trainings for healthcare providers to improve their knowledge and storage practices and use to safeguard the quality of these lifesaving medicines."
