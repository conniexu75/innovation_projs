Here we describe the genome of the best-studied member of this group, Dictyostelium discoideum. The gene-dense chromosomes of this organism encode approximately 12,500 predicted proteins, a high proportion of which have long, repetitive amino acid tracts. There are many genes for polyketide synthases and ABC transporters, suggesting an extensive secondary metabolism for producing and exporting small molecules. The genome is rich in complex repeats, one class of which is clustered and may serve as centromeres. Partial copies of the extrachromosomal ribosomal DNA (rDNA) element are found at the ends of each chromosome, suggesting a novel telomere structure and the use of a common mechanism to maintain both the rDNA and chromosomal termini. A proteome-based phylogeny shows that the amoebozoa diverged from the animal-fungal lineage after the plant-animal split, but Dictyostelium seems to have retained more of the diversity of the ancestral genome than have plants, animals or fungi."

Here we present the sequence and preliminary characterization of a protein that is a cadmium-containing carbonic anhydrase from the marine diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii. The existence of a cadmium enzyme in marine phytoplankton may indicate that there is a unique selection pressure for metalloenzymes in the marine environment, and our discovery provides a long-awaited explanation for the nutrient-like behaviour of cadmium in the oceans."
https://openalex.org/W2027924835,"Every successful pregnancy requires proper embryo implantation. Low implantation rate is a major problem during infertility treatments using assisted reproductive technologies. Here we report a newly discovered molecular influence on implantation through the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor LPA3 (refs 2-4). Targeted deletion of LPA3 in mice resulted in significantly reduced litter size, which could be attributed to delayed implantation and altered embryo spacing. These two events led to delayed embryonic development, hypertrophic placentas shared by multiple embryos and embryonic death. An enzyme demonstrated to influence implantation, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) (ref. 5), was downregulated in LPA3-deficient uteri during pre-implantation. Downregulation of COX2 led to reduced levels of prostaglandins E2 and I2 (PGE2 and PGI2), which are critical for implantation. Exogenous administration of PGE2 or carbaprostacyclin (a stable analogue of PGI2) into LPA3-deficient female mice rescued delayed implantation but did not rescue defects in embryo spacing. These data identify LPA3 receptor-mediated signalling as having an influence on implantation, and further indicate linkage between LPA signalling and prostaglandin biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2013520054,"Genetic interaction analysis,in which two mutations have a combined effect not exhibited by either mutation alone, is a powerful and widespread tool for establishing functional linkages between genes. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ongoing screens have generated >4,800 such genetic interaction data. We demonstrate that by combining these data with information on protein-protein, prote in-DNA or metabolic networks, it is possible to uncover physical mechanisms behind many of the observed genetic effects. Using a probabilistic model, we found that 1,922 genetic interactions are significantly associated with either between- or within-pathway explanations encoded in the physical networks, covering approximately 40% of known genetic interactions. These models predict new functions for 343 proteins and suggest that between-pathway explanations are better than within-pathway explanations at interpreting genetic interactions identified in systematic screens. This study provides a road map for how genetic and physical interactions can be integrated to reveal pathway organization and function."

This inhibition can be overcome by overexpression of the Rheb GTPase. Rheb binds directly to the amino-terminal lobe of the mTOR catalytic domain, and activates mTOR kinase in a GTP-dependent manner. Herein we show that the binding of Rheb to endogenous and recombinant mTOR is reversibly inhibited by withdrawal of all extracellular amino acids or just leucine.

Moreover, the binding of mTOR to Rheb mutants that are unable to bind guanyl nucleotide in vivo is also inhibited by amino withdrawal. The inhibitory effect of amino acid withdrawal is exerted through an action on mTOR, at a site largely distinct from that responsible for the binding of Rheb; deletion of the larger, carboxyl-terminal lobe of the mTOR catalytic domain eliminates the inhibitory effect of amino acid withdrawal on Rheb binding, without altering Rheb binding per se.

IntroductionThe target of rapamycin (TOR) 1The abbreviations used are: TOR, target of rapamycin; mTOR, mammalian TOR; PKB, protein kinase B; TSC, tuberous sclerosis complex; S6K, S6 kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; D-PBS, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HA, hemagglutinin; GMPPNP, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate. is the founding member of the phosphatidylinositol 3′-OH kinase-related protein (Ser/Thr) kinase (PIKK) family (1Jacinto E. Hall M.N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The TOR polypeptides in Drosophila and mammalian cells are now known to be major regulators of cell growth in part through their ability to phosphorylate and control the activity of the translational regulators, the p70 S6 kinases (S6Ks), and the 4E-BPs. TOR signaling is effected by two TOR-containing complexes; TOR phosphorylation of these translational regulators is mediated by a rapamycin-sensitive complex of TOR with the polypeptides LST8 and raptor, known as TOR complex 1 (2Martin D.E. Hall M.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 2: 158-166Crossref Scopus (440) Google Scholar). LST8 binds to and stimulates the kinase activity of the TOR catalytic domain (3Kim Do-Hung. Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Latek R.R. Guntur K.V.P. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar), whereas raptor binds the TOR substrates 4E-BP and p70 S6K and is critical for their effective phosphorylation by the TOR catalytic domain in vivo (4Nojima H. Tokunaga C. Eguchi S. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Yoshino K. Hara K. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15461-15464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). In turn, signaling by TOR is controlled by multiple upstream inputs provided by receptor tyrosine kinases, through their control of PtdIns 3′OH kinase and the protein kinase B (PKB), by energy sufficiency through regulation of the AMP-activated protein kinase, and by amino acid sufficiency, whose effectors in this pathway are as yet unknown (5Hay N. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1926-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3398) Google Scholar, 6Li Y. Corradetti M.N. Inoki K. Guan K-L. Trends Biochem.

Dev. 2005; 15: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Genetic evidence from Drosophila, fortified by genetic and biochemical data in mammalian systems, identified the critical regulators situated between PKB and TOR as the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), an obligatory heterodimer of the polypeptides Hamartin (TSC1) and Tuberin (TSC2), and Rheb, a Ras-like small GTPase. Rheb is a positive regulator of TOR signaling in vivo; the action of Rheb is opposed by the TSC complex, by virtue of the ability of the TSC complex to act as a Rheb GTPase activator, directly promoting the conversion of Rheb-GTP to Rheb-GDP. The inhibitory action of the TSC complex on Rheb is attenuated by PKB-catalyzed TSC2 phosphorylation, whereas the TSC-Rheb-GTPase activator activity is enhanced by AMP-activated protein kinase-catalyzed TSC2 phosphorylation (5Hay N. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1926-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3398) Google Scholar, 6Li Y. Corradetti M.N. Inoki K. Guan K-L. Trends Biochem.

Dev. 2005; 15: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus the TSC complex is a major site at which RTKs and energy sufficiency control TOR signaling.As regards the mechanisms by which Rheb acts as a positive regulator of TOR signaling, we recently demonstrated (8Long X. Lin Y. Ortiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar) that Rheb binds directly to the smaller, amino-terminal lobe of the mTOR catalytic domain, and the kinase activity of the TOR polypeptides bound to Rheb is determined by the state of Rheb nucleotide charging. TOR polypeptides bound to mutant Rhebs that are unable to bind any guanyl nucleotide are essentially devoid of protein kinase activity; conversely, TOR polypeptides bound to RhebQ64L, a mutant that is 90% GTP-bound in vivo (9Li Y. Inoki K. Guan K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7965-7975Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), exhibit greater kinase activity than TOR polypeptides bound to wild type Rheb. Thus the mTOR polypeptide itself is a direct target of the Rheb GTPase. These findings do not preclude the operation of other Rheb effectors that may promote mTOR signaling indirectly, e.g. as by increasing intracellular amino acid levels. Notably, we also observed Rheb to be capable of interacting with LST8 and with raptor, independent of its ability to bind to TOR; this finding raised the possibility that, in addition to its ability to promote TOR catalytic activity, Rheb may also play a role in configuring TOR complex 1.The mechanisms and site of action of amino acids in the control of TOR signaling and its relation to the mechanisms of Rheb action are poorly understood. Withdrawal of extracellular amino acids inhibits TOR signaling in vivo (10Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q-P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1101) Google Scholar), as reflected by the progressive dephosphorylation of specific sites on p70 S6K (especially Thr412, a major site of direct phosphorylation by mTOR; Ref. 11Isotani S. Hara K. Tokunaga C. Inoue H. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34493-34498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and 4E-BP, over a period of 1–2 h. Although this response suggests an inhibition of TOR kinase activity, mTOR immunoprecipitates from amino acid-deprived cells exhibit kinase activity in vitro indistinguishable from that of mTOR isolated from amino acid-replete cells. Moreover, mutations of p70 S6K that eliminate the binding of the S6K polypeptide to raptor (when combined with a deletion of the S6K psuedosubstrate/autoinhibitory domain) render it resistant to dephosphorylation after amino acid depletion (as well as to rapamycin) (10Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q-P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that amino acid withdrawal may not alter TOR catalytic activity but rather may interfere with the ability of the TOR catalytic domain to phosphorylate raptor-bound substrates. Whatever the mechanism by which amino acid withdrawal inhibits TOR signaling, this inhibition can be overcome by excess active (i.e. GTP-charged) Rheb. Thus, overexpression of recombinant Rheb can restore the phosphorylation of p70 S6K and 4E-BP despite the lack of extracellular amino acids; this effect of Rheb is inhibited by rapamycin (12Saucedo L.J. Gao X. Chiarelli D.A. Li L. Pan D. Edgar B.A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2003; 5: 566-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 13Stocker H. Radimerski T. Schindelholz B. Wittwer F. Belawat F. Daram P.

Signal. 2004; 10: 1105-1112Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar).In view of the finding that Rheb can interact directly with the components of TOR complex 1, we examined whether the interaction of Rheb with any of these elements is affected by amino acid sufficiency. Herein we show that the binding of recombinant Rheb to the mTOR catalytic domain in vivo is strongly inhibited by withdrawal of extracellular amino acids.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents, antibodies, and all DNA constructs except mTOR-(2148–2300) and -(2148–2430) were described previously (8Long X. Lin Y. Ortiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 10Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q-P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C.

The latter two mTOR constructs were created by introduction of stop codons after the residues indicated into the mTOR-(2148–2549) construct. The anti-S6K (phospho-Thr412) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, anti-FLAG M2 antibody from Sigma, and anti-GST monoclonal antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.Cell culture, transfection, and the procedures for amino acid or leucine withdrawal and readdtion are also described by Hara et al. (10Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q-P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1101) Google Scholar); D-PBS contains the following components: CaCl2 (0.1 g/liter), KCl (0.2 g/liter), KH2PO4 (0.2 g/liter), MgCl2 + 6H2O (0.1 g/liter), NaCl (8 g/liter), Na2HPO4 + 7H2O (2.16 g/liter). Estimation of protein-protein interaction during transient expression and the measurement of Rheb guanyl nucleotide charging were performed are described by Long et al. (8Long X. Lin Y. Ortiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWithdrawal of extracellular amino acids results in the dephosphorylation of recombinant p70 S6K α1 at threonine 412 (equivalent to Thr389 in p70 S6K α2). Overexpression of wild type Rheb with S6K restores the phosphorylation of S6K(Thr412) in a dose-dependent fashion, despite the withdrawal of extracellular amino acids (Fig. 1A). The ability of Rheb to restore S6K(Thr412) phosphorylation requires that Rheb have an intact switch 1 and switch 2 domain and be capable of GTP charging in vivo (8Long X. Lin Y. Ortiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Moreover the effect of Rheb is sensitive to inhibition by rapamycin (Fig. 1B).We recently showed that recombinant Rheb can bind directly to mTOR and that the protein kinase activity of mTOR is positively regulated by Rheb-GTP (8Long X. Lin Y. Ortiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Although the specific mechanism by which Rheb-GTP activates the mTOR kinase is not known, we inquired whether amino acid sufficiency affects the interaction of Rheb with mTOR. Recombinant GST-Rheb binds the endogenous mTOR complex 1 (Ref. 8Long X. Lin Y. Ortiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar and Fig. 2A); here we show that prior amino acid withdrawal substantially reduces the recovery of endogenous mTOR with GST-Rheb; replacement of the usual medium, DMEM plus 10% serum, with D-PBS for 1.5 to 2 h greatly reduces the recovery of endogenous (Fig. 2A) or recombinant (Fig. 2B) mTOR with Rheb; removal of serum alone has no effect on the recovery of HA-mTOR with GST-Rheb (Fig. 2B, compare lane 1 with lane 3), whereas the addition of an amino acid mixture alone to D-PBS is sufficient to fully restore the Rheb-bound mTOR to the levels recovered from cells in DMEM plus 10% serum (Fig. 2B, compare lane 1 with lane 4). Recombinant Rheb binds to the carboxyl-terminal region of mTOR, specifically to the mTOR catalytic domain; moreover, independently of its ability to bind to mTOR, Rheb also binds directly to LST8 and to the carboxyl-terminal WD domains of raptor (8Long X. Lin Y. Ortiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). We therefore compared the effect of amino acid withdrawal on the binding of GST-Rheb to these three polypeptides (Fig. 2C). Notably, whereas the binding of GST-Rheb to the mTOR carboxyl-terminal segment 2148–2549 is strongly inhibited by prior amino acid withdrawal, the binding of Rheb to LST8 and the raptor carboxyl terminus is unaffected. We showed previously that although removal of each of the nineteen amino acids gives some inhibition of mTOR signaling to p70 S6K, the most substantial inhibition seen upon withdrawal of a single amino acid occurs with removal of leucine, and removal of arginine is only slightly less inhibitory (10Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q-P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Similarly we observe that the inhibitory effects on the Rheb-mTOR interaction caused by removal of all amino acids is largely reproduced by removal of leucine alone (Fig. 2D); a similar response is observed with arginine withdrawal (data not shown). As with its effect on mTOR signaling, the inhibitory effect of amino acid withdrawal on the Rheb-mTOR interaction is reversible; readdition of amino acids 30 min prior to harvest largely restores mTOR binding to Rheb (Fig. 2D). A similar reversibility is observed with regard to leucine regulation of Rheb-mTOR binding (Fig. 2D). Thus the amino acid regulation of the Rheb-TOR association displays a specificity similar to the amino acid regulation of mTOR signaling.Fig. 2Binding of Rheb to mTOR is reversibly inhibited by withdrawal of extracellular amino acids (AA) or leucine.A, HEK293T cells were transfected with pEBG (lane 1) or pEBG-Rheb wild type (lanes 2 and 3). Forty hours later, some cells (lane 3) were transferred to D-PBS, and all cells were harvested 2 h thereafter. Cells were extracted, and the GST fusion proteins were purified on GSH-Sepharose. The GSH eluates and aliquots of the extract were analyzed by immunoblot for mTOR (top two panels). A Coomassie Blue stain of the GSH eluate is in the bottom panel. B, pEBG-Rheb was cotransfected with pcDNA1-HA-mTOR in HEK293 cells. Forty hours later, some of the cells were transferred to D-PBS (lane 2) or DMEM without serum (lane 3) or to D-PBS containing 2× amino acid mixture (Invitrogen) (lane 4); the asterisk identifies cells incubated in DMEM. Cells were harvested 2 h later; GST-Rheb was isolated on GSH-Sepharose. After washing, the bound polypeptides (top and bottom panels), and aliquots of the cell extracts (middle panel) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and anti-HA immunoblot (top and middle panels) and Coomassie Blue stain (bottom panel). C, the effect of amino acid withdrawal on Rheb binding to raptor carboxyl-terminal segment 1009–1335, to LST8, and to the mTOR carboxyl-terminal segment 2148–2549. Transfection of pEBG-Rheb and pCMV5-FLAG constructs, extraction, GSH-Sepharose purification, and analysis were performed as described for B; some of the HEK293T cells were transferred from DMEM plus 10% fetal calf serum to D-PBS 2 h prior to harvest (lanes 2, 4, and 6). D, a comparison of the effect of withdrawal of leucine or all amino acids on Rheb binding to mTOR-(2148–2549). HEK293T cells were transfected with pCMV5-FLAG-mTOR-(2148–2549) and pEBG (lane 1) or pEBG-Rheb (lanes 2–8). After 40 h, some plates were transferred to D-PBS (lanes 3, 5, and 6) or to D-PBS containing a mixture of amino acids at a concentration equivalent to those present in DMEM, minus leucine (1× amino acids – leucine) (lanes 4, 7, and 8). Cells were harvested 1.5 h (lanes 5 and 7) or 2 h thereafter (lanes 3, 4, 6, and 8). At 1.5 h after medium change, some cells incubated in D-PBS were refed with all amino acids (lane 6), whereas some of those incubated in “1× amino acids – leucine” were refed with leucine (lane 8) for another 30 min before harvest. Extraction, GSH-Sepharose purification, and analysis were performed as described for B. Y, yes; N, no.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A novel feature of the binding of Rheb to its effector mTOR, and one that contrasts with the interaction of other Ras-like GTPases with their known effectors, is that the Rheb-mTOR interaction does not require Rheb GTP charging (8Long X. Lin Y. Ortiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Moreover nucleotide-deficient Rheb polypeptides bind more tightly to mTOR than does nucleotide-replete Rheb, and Rheb-GTP charging, although it promotes mTOR kinase activity in vivo, actually diminishes the strength of the Rheb-mTOR interaction in vivo and in vitro (8Long X. Lin Y. Ortiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Notably, amino acid withdrawal interferes with the ability of mTOR to bind to wild type Rheb and to the nucleotide-deficient, switch 1 and switch 2 mutants of Rheb to a similar extent (Fig. 3A); in addition, the binding of these nucleotide-deficient Rheb mutants to the mTOR fragments (2148–2549) is also potently inhibited by amino acid withdrawal (supplemental Fig. 1). Reciprocally, amino acid withdrawal also diminishes the binding of mTOR to Rheb(Q64L), a mutant that exhibits nearly 90% GTP charging in vivo (Fig. 3A). This indicates that the effect of amino acid withdrawal is not mediated by changes in Rheb guanyl nucleotide charging. In fact, amino acid withdrawal does not appreciably alter the fractional guanyl nucleotide charging of wild type recombinant Rheb (Fig. 3B) as observed by Zhang et al. (15Zhang Y. Gao X. Saucedo L.J. Ru B. Edgar B.A. Pan D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), but in contrast to the findings of Smith et al. (16Smith E.M. Finn S.T. Tee A.R. Browne G.J. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18717-18727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar).Fig. 3The inhibitory effect of amino acid (AA) withdrawal on the binding of HA-mTOR to Rheb is not due to a change in Rheb GTP charging.A, pcDNA1 encoding HA-mTOR was coexpressed with wild type or mutant Rhebs, each expressed as a GST fusion protein. After 40 h, some of the cells were transferred to D-PBS (lanes 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, and 14); all plates were extracted 2 h later. The GST-Rheb polypeptides were purified and washed on GSH-Sepharose and the eluates (top and bottom panels), and aliquots of the extracts (middle panels) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and anti-HA immunoblot (top and middle panels) or Coomassie Blue stain (bottom panels). B, Rheb GTP charging during transient expression. Amino acid withdrawal was accomplished by transfer to D-PBS with 32Pi 2 h prior to harvest. The insets show images obtained from a single immunoblot of the GST-Rheb polypeptides analyzed for each of the treatments indicated. Y, yes; N, no.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next examined the effect of further deletion of the mTOR carboxyterminal fragment on the ability of amino acids to regulate Rheb binding; the mTOR fragments 2148–2430 and 2148–2300 each bind wild type Rheb comparably with to mTOR-(2148–2549); however, the binding of Rheb to the 2148–2300 fragment is not inhibited by prior amino acid withdrawl, whereas the binding of Rheb to the other two mTOR fragments shows similar inhibition by amino acid withdrawal (Fig. 4A). This result establishes that the regulation of the mTOR-Rheb interaction by amino acid sufficiency is exerted primarily and perhaps exclusively through an effect on mTOR, through the segment 2301–2430, which corresponds to the larger, carboxyl-terminal lobe of the mTOR catalytic domain. We next inquired as to whether the ability of amino acid sufficiency to regulate the ability of the mTOR-(2148–2549) fragment to bind Rheb is retained in vitro. FLAG-tagged mTOR-(2148–2549) was expressed in HEK293 cells, a portion of which were subjected to amino acid withdrawal prior to harvest. The cells were extracted in the presence of 0.1 m NaF; after anti-FLAG immunoaffinity purification, the extensively purified preparations of FLAG-mTOR-(2148–2549) were incubated with immobilized GST or GST-Rheb charged with GMPPNP. After brief washing, the retained FLAG-mTOR polypeptides were analyzed by FLAG immunoblot. As shown in Fig. 4B, GST-Rheb binds FLAG-mTOR-(2148–2549) specifically, however, in equal amounts whether the mTOR polypeptides are extracted from amino acid-replete or -deficient cells. Thus the ability of amino acid withdrawal to inhibit the ability of mTOR-(2148–2549) to bind to Rheb is not due to a stable modification of the mTOR polypeptide that survives cell extraction.Fig. 4The inhibitory effect of amino acid (AA) withdrawal on Rheb-TOR interaction is exerted on TOR through a site that is distinct from the amino-terminal lobe of TOR catalytic domain.A, HEK293T cells were cotransfected with pCMV5-FLAG-mTOR-(2148–2549) (lanes 1–3 and 7–9) or -(2148–2430) (lanes 4–6) or -(2148–2300) (lanes 10–12) and pEBG (lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10) or pEBG-Rheb (lanes 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, and 12). After 40 h, some plates were transferred to D-PBS (lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12). Extraction, GSH-Sepharose purification, and analysis were preformed as described in the legend to Fig. 2B. B, the FLAG-tagged mTOR fragment 2148–2549 was expressed in HEK293T cells; some cells were starved for leucine (lanes 3, 6, and 9) for 2 h before harvest. The mTOR fragment was extracted using 0.1 m NaF, immunopurified, and eluted from immobilized anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. Aliquots of FLAG-mTOR-(2148–2549) were incubated in vitro with GSH-Sepharose-immobilized GST (lanes 4–6) or GST-Rheb (lanes 7–9) also purified after transient expression and charged in vitro with GMPPNP. After washing, the polypeptides retained on GSH-Sepharose were analyzed by anti-FLAG immunoblot (upper panel) and Coomassie Blue stain (lower panel).

As with mTOR kinase activity (10Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q-P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1101) Google Scholar), the failure of the inhibitory effect of amino acid withdrawal to survive cell disruption argues against a mechanism that involves stable modifications of the mTOR polypeptide. Rather, this behavior suggests that the in vivo inhibition of mTOR signaling and the Rheb/mTOR interaction caused by amino acid withdrawal is due to the generation of an inhibitor that binds to the mTOR catalytic domain and interferes by a noncovalent mechanism with the mTOR-catalyzed S6K phosphorylation within the TOR complex 1, as well as with the ability of mTOR to bind Rheb. The putative inhibitor is lost on cell disruption, thereby restoring the mTOR kinase activity assayed in vitro, as well as the ability of the mTOR catalytic domain to bind added Rheb in vitro. The inhibitory effect of amino acid withdrawal on mTOR signaling may be due directly to the inhibition of Rheb binding to mTOR; if so the ability of overexpressed Rheb to overcome the inhibitory effect of amino acid withdrawal may be due simply to flooding the cell with an excess of Rheb-GTP that is sufficient to overcome the effect of the inhibitor. The ability of Rheb to bind to raptor and LST8, the other components of the TOR complex 1, may also be relevant to the mechanism of Rheb action within the TORC1. Amino acid withdrawal has been reported previously to increase the association of raptor with mTOR but only in complexes that contain LST8 (3Kim Do-Hung. Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Latek R.R.

IntroductionThe target of rapamycin (TOR) 1The abbreviations used are: TOR, target of rapamycin; mTOR, mammalian TOR; PKB, protein kinase B; TSC, tuberous sclerosis complex; S6K, S6 kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; D-PBS, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HA, hemagglutinin; GMPPNP, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate. is the founding member of the phosphatidylinositol 3′-OH kinase-related protein (Ser/Thr) kinase (PIKK) family (1Jacinto E. Hall M.N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The TOR polypeptides in Drosophila and mammalian cells are now known to be major regulators of cell growth in part through their ability to phosphorylate and control the activity of the translational regulators, the p70 S6 kinases (S6Ks), and the 4E-BPs. TOR signaling is effected by two TOR-containing complexes; TOR phosphorylation of these translational regulators is mediated by a rapamycin-sensitive complex of TOR with the polypeptides LST8 and raptor, known as TOR complex 1 (2Martin D.E. Hall M.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 2: 158-166Crossref Scopus (440) Google Scholar). LST8 binds to and stimulates the kinase activity of the TOR catalytic domain (3Kim Do-Hung. Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Latek R.R. Guntur K.V.P. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar), whereas raptor binds the TOR substrates 4E-BP and p70 S6K and is critical for their effective phosphorylation by the TOR catalytic domain in vivo (4Nojima H. Tokunaga C. Eguchi S. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Yoshino K. Hara K. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15461-15464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). In turn, signaling by TOR is controlled by multiple upstream inputs provided by receptor tyrosine kinases, through their control of PtdIns 3′OH kinase and the protein kinase B (PKB), by energy sufficiency through regulation of the AMP-activated protein kinase, and by amino acid sufficiency, whose effectors in this pathway are as yet unknown (5Hay N. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1926-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3398) Google Scholar, 6Li Y. Corradetti M.N. Inoki K. Guan K-L. Trends Biochem.

Dev. 2005; 15: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Genetic evidence from Drosophila, fortified by genetic and biochemical data in mammalian systems, identified the critical regulators situated between PKB and TOR as the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), an obligatory heterodimer of the polypeptides Hamartin (TSC1) and Tuberin (TSC2), and Rheb, a Ras-like small GTPase. Rheb is a positive regulator of TOR signaling in vivo; the action of Rheb is opposed by the TSC complex, by virtue of the ability of the TSC complex to act as a Rheb GTPase activator, directly promoting the conversion of Rheb-GTP to Rheb-GDP. The inhibitory action of the TSC complex on Rheb is attenuated by PKB-catalyzed TSC2 phosphorylation, whereas the TSC-Rheb-GTPase activator activity is enhanced by AMP-activated protein kinase-catalyzed TSC2 phosphorylation (5Hay N. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1926-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3398) Google Scholar, 6Li Y. Corradetti M.N. Inoki K. Guan K-L. Trends Biochem.

Dev. 2005; 15: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus the TSC complex is a major site at which RTKs and energy sufficiency control TOR signaling.As regards the mechanisms by which Rheb acts as a positive regulator of TOR signaling, we recently demonstrated (8Long X. Lin Y. Ortiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar) that Rheb binds directly to the smaller, amino-terminal lobe of the mTOR catalytic domain, and the kinase activity of the TOR polypeptides bound to Rheb is determined by the state of Rheb nucleotide charging. TOR polypeptides bound to mutant Rhebs that are unable to bind any guanyl nucleotide are essentially devoid of protein kinase activity; conversely, TOR polypeptides bound to RhebQ64L, a mutant that is 90% GTP-bound in vivo (9Li Y. Inoki K. Guan K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7965-7975Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), exhibit greater kinase activity than TOR polypeptides bound to wild type Rheb. Thus the mTOR polypeptide itself is a direct target of the Rheb GTPase. These findings do not preclude the operation of other Rheb effectors that may promote mTOR signaling indirectly, e.g. as by increasing intracellular amino acid levels. Notably, we also observed Rheb to be capable of interacting with LST8 and with raptor, independent of its ability to bind to TOR; this finding raised the possibility that, in addition to its ability to promote TOR catalytic activity, Rheb may also play a role in configuring TOR complex 1.The mechanisms and site of action of amino acids in the control of TOR signaling and its relation to the mechanisms of Rheb action are poorly understood. Withdrawal of extracellular amino acids inhibits TOR signaling in vivo (10Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q-P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1101) Google Scholar), as reflected by the progressive dephosphorylation of specific sites on p70 S6K (especially Thr412, a major site of direct phosphorylation by mTOR; Ref. 11Isotani S.

Although this response suggests an inhibition of TOR kinase activity, mTOR immunoprecipitates from amino acid-deprived cells exhibit kinase activity in vitro indistinguishable from that of mTOR isolated from amino acid-replete cells. Moreover, mutations of p70 S6K that eliminate the binding of the S6K polypeptide to raptor (when combined with a deletion of the S6K psuedosubstrate/autoinhibitory domain) render it resistant to dephosphorylation after amino acid depletion (as well as to rapamycin) (10Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q-P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that amino acid withdrawal may not alter TOR catalytic activity but rather may interfere with the ability of the TOR catalytic domain to phosphorylate raptor-bound substrates. Whatever the mechanism by which amino acid withdrawal inhibits TOR signaling, this inhibition can be overcome by excess active (i.e. GTP-charged) Rheb. Thus, overexpression of recombinant Rheb can restore the phosphorylation of p70 S6K and 4E-BP despite the lack of extracellular amino acids; this effect of Rheb is inhibited by rapamycin (12Saucedo L.J. Gao X. Chiarelli D.A. Li L. Pan D. Edgar B.A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2003; 5: 566-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 13Stocker H. Radimerski T. Schindelholz B. Wittwer F. Belawat F. Daram P.

Signal. 2004; 10: 1105-1112Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar).In view of the finding that Rheb can interact directly with the components of TOR complex 1, we examined whether the interaction of Rheb with any of these elements is affected by amino acid sufficiency. Herein we show that the binding of recombinant Rheb to the mTOR catalytic domain in vivo is strongly inhibited by withdrawal of extracellular amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1965688832,"Chronic exposure of many human hepatoma cell lines to a low dose (LD) of doxorubicin induced a senescence-like phenotype (SLP) accompanied by enlargement of cells and increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity. LD doxorubicin-induced SLP was preceded by multinucleation and downregulation of multiple proteins with mitotic checkpoint function, including CENP-A, Mad2, BubR1, and Chk1. LD doxorubicin-treated cells eventually underwent cell death through mitotic catastrophe. When we investigated whether LD doxorubicin-induced cell death shares biochemical characteristics with high dose (HD) doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in Huh-7 cells, we observed that externalization of phosphatidyl serine and release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol was associated with both types of cell death. However, propidium iodide exclusion assays showed that membrane integrity was lost in the initial phase of LD doxorubicin-induced cell death through mitotic catastrophe, whereas it was lost during the late phase of HD doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, HD doxorubicin-induced apoptosis but not LD doxorubicin-induced mitotic catastrophe led to transient activation of NF-κB and strong, sustained activations of p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and caspases. Collectively, these results indicate that different doses of doxorubicin activate different regulatory mechanisms to induce either apoptosis or cell death through mitotic catastrophe."
https://openalex.org/W2021710604,"Despite its importance in terms of energy homeostasis, the role of AMP-activated protein kinase in adipose tissue remains controversial. Initial studies have described an anti-lipolytic role for AMP-activated protein kinase, whereas more recent studies have suggested the converse. Thus we have addressed the role of AMP-activated protein kinase in adipose tissue by modulating AMP-activated protein kinase activity in primary rodent adipocytes using pharmacological activators or by adenoviral expression of dominant negative or constitutively active forms of the kinase. We then studied the effects of AMP-activated protein kinase activity modulation on lipolytic mechanisms. Finally, we analyzed the consequences of a genetic deletion of AMP-activated protein kinase in mouse adipocytes. AMP-activated protein kinase activity in adipocytes is represented mainly by the α1 isoform and is induced by all of the stimuli that increase cAMP in adipocytes, including fasting. When AMP-activated protein kinase activity is increased by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-riboside, phenformin, or by the expression of a constitutively active form, isoproterenol-induced lipolysis is strongly reduced. Conversely, when AMP-activated protein kinase activity is decreased either by a dominant negative form or in AMP-activated protein kinase α1 knock-out mice, lipolysis is increased. We present data suggesting that AMP-activated protein kinase acts on hormone-sensitive lipase by blocking its translocation to the lipid droplet. We conclude that, in mature adipocytes, AMP-activated protein kinase activation has a clear anti-lipolytic effect.

AMPK is a heterotrimeric complex consisting of a catalytic (α) and two regulatory (β and γ) subunits (1Hardie D.G. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 5179-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). For each subunit, several isoforms have been identified, although the exact function of the different isoforms remains unclear. Numerous studies have shown that AMPK is activated by stresses that increase the AMP/ATP ratio into the cell such as hypoxia, exercise, and long term starvation (1Hardie D.G. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 5179-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 2Carling D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 18-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). AMPK is activated by phosphorylation of the threonine residue 172 within the activation loop of the α catalytic subunit by an AMPK kinase. AMPK kinase has been recently identified as LKB1, a tumor suppressor mutated in humans with Peutz-Jeger syndrome. This disorder is associated with increased risk of colon, stomach, and lung carcinomas (3Woods A. Johnstone S.R. Dickerson K. Leiper F.C. Fryer L.G. Neumann D. Schlattner U. Wallimann T. Carlson M.

The activation of AMPK leads to the phosphorylation of a number of proteins that results in increased glucose uptake and metabolism as well as fatty acid oxidation and simultaneously in an inhibition of hepatic lipogenesis, cholesterol synthesis, and glucose production (1Hardie D.G. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 5179-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). AMPK is also responsible for increased fatty acid oxidation in response to the adipocyte-derived hormones, leptin and adiponectin (6Minokoshi Y. Kim Y.B. Peroni O.D. Fryer L.G. Muller C. Carling D.

Because AMPK activation would have beneficial metabolic consequences for diabetic patients, AMPK has emerged as a potential target for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes (8Winder W.W. Hardie D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E1-10PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ruderman N. Prentki M. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 340-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that two classes of anti-diabetic drugs, metformin and thiazolidinediones, could act at least in part through an activation of AMPK in liver and muscle (10Zhou G. Myers R. Li Y. Chen Y. Shen X. Fenyk-Melody J. Wu M. Ventre J. Doebber T. Fujii N. Musi N. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Moller D.E. J. Clin.

Whereas the function of AMPK in liver and muscle has been well illustrated, its role in adipose tissue remains poorly documented and controversial. Adipose tissue is an important actor for the preservation of energetic homeostasis. The breakdown of triglycerides through lipolysis during fasting is a major function in adipocytes. Previously, Sullivan et al. (12Sullivan J.E. Brocklehurst K.J. Marley A.E. Carey F. Carling D. Beri R.K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) reported that prior activation of AMPK by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-riboside (AICAR) in isolated rat adipocytes inhibits isoproterenol-induced lipolysis. However, recently, a study performed in the 3T3-L1 adipocyte cell line has reached the opposite conclusion. Based on the fact that β-adrenergic agents activate AMPK activity in adipocytes and that lipolysis is lower in the presence of a dominant negative form of the kinase, it was proposed in this latter study (13Yin W. Mu J. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43074-43080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) that AMPK stimulates the lipolytic pathway. To clarify the role of AMPK, we have modulated the activity of the kinase in primary rodent adipocytes and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes using pharmacological activators or with adenoviruses expressing either dominant negative or constitutively active forms of the kinase and have studied the effects of these manipulations on lipolytic mechanisms. We have also analyzed the consequences of genetic deletion of AMPK activity in mouse adipocytes. Animals—Animal studies were conducted according to the French guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-300-g body weight) and male CBA mice (25-35 g) were obtained from Charles River Laboratory (L'Arbresle, France). All of the experiments were performed on adipocytes isolated from epididymal fat pads. The AMPK α1 knock-out (KO) mice were as previously described (14Jorgensen S.B. Viollet B. Andreelli F. Frosig C. Birk J.B. Schjerling P. Vaulont S. Richter E.A. Wojtaszewski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1070-1079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Epididymal and inguinal fat pads of 5-month-old wild type (WT) and AMPK α1 KO mice were used in this study. Animals were housed in cages at a constant temperature (22 °C) with light from 7-19 h and free access to water and laboratory chow (UAR, France). For the fasting/refeeding experiments, rats were fasted for 12 or 24 h and then refed for 1 or 3 h with a high carbohydrate diet (72% carbohydrate, 1% fat, and 27% protein (% energy)). Adipocyte Isolation and Determination of Fat Cell Size and Number—Mature adipocytes were isolated by collagenase treatment of epididymal fat pads according to Rodbell (15Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The diameter of adipocytes was measured using a light microscope fitted with a camera and Perfect-Image software (Clara Vision). A frequency distribution plot of cell diameters was used to determine the mean fat cell diameter and mean ± S.D. Both mean fat cell volume and surface area were then determined using standard equations. Mean fat cell weight was calculated from cell volume, assuming that the density of lipid is equal to that of triolein (0.915 g/liter). After determination of triglyceride concentration (Kit Infinity triglyceride reagent, Sigma Diagnostics, St Quentin Fallavier, France) in the cell suspension, fat cell number was calculated by dividing the lipid content of the cell suspension by the mean fat cell weight. 3T3-L1 Culture—3T3-L1 cells (a kind gift from Dr. J. Pairault, Paris, France) were cultured in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (PAA, Les Mureaux, France) and antibiotics. At confluence, adipocyte differentiation was induced by adding methyl-isobutylxanthine (100 μm), dexamethasone (0.25 μm), and insulin (1 μg/ml) for 2 days. Cells were cultured in high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum and insulin for an additional 5 days and then maintained in high-glucose DMEM only supplemented with 10% calf serum. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used for experiments 8-10 days after differentiation and treated as described below for mature adipocytes. Short Term Incubation of Adipocytes and AMPK Assay—After isolation, adipocytes (∼3 × 106 cells) were incubated in Krebs Ringer Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) supplemented with 2% BSA in a 95% O2, 5% /CO2 atmosphere for 30 min. Cells were then washed three times with Hanks' buffer to remove BSA and then incubated for 1 h in Hanks' buffer in a 95% O2, 5%/CO2 atmosphere in the presence or absence of the different AMPK activators. Following treatment, adipocytes were disrupted in buffer A, 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (Complete protease inhibitor, Roche Applied Science) supplemented with 1% Triton X-100. The cellular debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was recovered, adjusted to 10% polyethylene glycol 8000, and incubated 45 min at 4 °C. Following further centrifugation (18000 × g, 15 min), the pellet of proteins was resuspended in buffer A. Aliquots were used to assay the AMPK activity using AMARA peptide in the presence of saturating concentrations of 5′-AMP (200 μm) as described previously (16Foretz M. Carling D. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14767-14771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of AMPK Complexes—AMPK complexes were immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of adipocyte proteins by incubation with either anti-α1, anti-α2, or anti-α1 + anti-α2 antibodies bound to protein G-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4°C. Antibodies against rat α1 and α2 catalytic subunits were kindly provided by Prof. D. G. Hardie (University of Dundee, United Kingdom). Recombinant AMPK α1 proteins (AMPK-DN and AMPK-CA) were immunoprecipitated from adipocyte lysates using an anti-Myc (clone 9E10) antibody bound to protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Orsay, France). Immune complexes were collected by brief centrifugation and washed extensively in buffer A. AMPK activity in the immune complex was determined by phosphorylation of the AMARA synthetic peptide substrate as described previously (16Foretz M. Carling D. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14767-14771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Infection of Adipocytes with Adenovirus—Adenoviruses encoding a constitutively active form (Ad AMPK-CA) and a dominant negative form (Ad AMPK-DN) of AMPK were as previously described (17Woods A. Azzout-Marniche D. Foretz M. Stein S.C. Lemarchand P. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Carling D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6704-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). An adenovirus of which the expression cassette contains the major late promoter with no exogenous gene was used as control (Ad null). Adenoviruses were propagated in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, purified by cesium chloride density centrifugation, and stored at -80 °C. Adipocytes (∼106 cells) were transduced in 2 ml of DMEM with various titers of adenovirus (from 100 to 200 pfu/cells) for 4 h at 37 °C. Culture medium was subsequently adjusted to 4 ml with DMEM supplemented with 25 mm glucose, 1% fetal calf serum, 2% BSA, and antibiotics. The efficacy of infection was estimated by the presence of green fluorescent protein in adipocytes, which is produced from an independent promoter by the Ad AMPK-CA. Infection efficiency was always higher than 50%. Adipocytes were infected for 24 h with the Ad AMPK-DN and for 48 h with the Ad AMPK-CA prior to the lipolysis assay. Western Blot Analysis—Samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond ECL, Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0, 05% (v/v) Tween 20) containing 5% (w/v) low-fat milk powder. Following a 2-h incubation with primary antibody at room temperature, the blots were washed with TBST buffer and incubated with the appropriate second antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase. After washing, blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal, Pierce). The recombinant AMPK-CA and AMPK-DN proteins contain a N-terminal Myc epitope (17Woods A. Azzout-Marniche D. Foretz M. Stein S.C. Lemarchand P. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Carling D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6704-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) and were detected using an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (clone 9E10, Roche Applied Science). Anti-phosphohormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) (Ser-565) antibody and total HSL antibody were provided by Prof. D. G. Hardie and Dr. C. Holm (University of Lund, Lund, Sweden), respectively. Anti-phospho-acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) (Ser-79) and antiphospho-CREB (Ser-133) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Milton Keynes, United Kingdom). Anti-phospho-AMPK (Thr-172) and anti-β-actin antibodies were supplied by Cell Signaling (New England Biolabs) and Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Quentin Fallavier, France), respectively. Antibody against perilipin was obtained from Progen (Progen Biotechnik, Heidelberg, Germany). Total ACC was detected using streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). Lipolysis Assay—Isolated fat cells were infected with AMPK adenovirus or treated with AMPK activators as described above. Adipocytes (106 cells) were then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in 2. 5 ml of Krebs Ringer bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 4% BSA with or without 1 μm isoproterenol in an atmosphere of 95% O2, 5%CO2 in stoppered Nalgene vials. Prior to lipolysis assay, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated in Krebs Ringer bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 4% BSA for 3 h. They then were treated for 1 h with AICAR or phenformin followed by a 1-h treatment with or without 10 μm isoproterenol. Subsequently, 1 ml of the incubation medium of rat adipocytes or 3T3-L1 adipocytes was removed, acidified with 100 μl of 30% trichloroacetic acid. The mixture was vigorously shaken and then centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. A volume of 700 μl of supernatant was collected and neutralized with 80 μl of 10% KOH and assayed for glycerol content (Glycerol Kit, Enzytec, Diffchamb, France). Measurement of Cellular ATP Content—Isolated fat cells were infected with AMPK adenovirus or treated with AMPK activators as described above. The incubation medium was then removed, and cells were disrupted in perchloric acid solution (7% v/v final). After centrifugation (3000 × g, 10 min), the acidic cell extract was neutralized with KOH and the ATP concentration was measured using a spectrophotometric procedure. Isolation of Lipid Droplets—Lipid droplets were isolated according to Yu et al (18Yu W. Cassara J. Weller P.F. Blood. 2000; 95: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adipocytes were resuspended in 2 ml of disruption buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors). Cells were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation at 800 p.s.i. for 10 min at 4 °C. The cavitate was collected, mixed with an equal volume of disruption buffer containing 1.08 m sucrose, and overlaid sequentially with 2 ml of 0.27 m sucrose buffer, 2 ml of 0.135 m sucrose, and 2 ml of “top” buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA. Following centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 90 min, different fractions (1.5 ml each) were collected from the top (fraction containing lipid droplets) to the bottom of the tube (cytosol, microsome, and nuclei). The lipid droplets were then washed with top buffer and centrifuged at 3500 × g for 15 min at 10 °C. Protein Assay—Protein concentration was measured according to Bradford with BSA as standard. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. The level of significance in the difference between groups was calculated by Student's unpaired t test with the exception of AMPK activity (Figs. 1 and 8) and lipolysis (Fig. 8) in which statistical significance was calculated by the Student's paired t test.Fig. 8Analysis of adipocyte cell size and lipolysis in the adipose tissue of AMPK α1 KO mice. A, α1 and α2 AMPK activities were measured from lysates of inguinal fat pads of WT and AMPK α1 KO mice after immunoprecipitation. *** shows statistical difference at p < 0.001 when compared with AMPK α1 activity measured in adipocytes of WT mice. B, adipocytes were isolated from the inguinal and epididymal fat pads of four WT and four AMPK α1 KO mice and pooled for each fat pad. The number and the size of adipocytes were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results presented show the frequency distribution of adipocyte cell size in WT and KO mice. C, adipocytes from epididymal fat pads were preincubated for 1 h in the absence or the presence of 500 μm AICAR, and then 1 μm isoproterenol was added within 1 h to activate lipolysis. Results are the mean ± S.E. from two independent experiments. In each independent experiment, the adipose tissues of four mice were pooled. Each experimental condition has been performed in triplicate. ** shows statistical difference at p < 0.01 when compared with conditions with isoproterenol. ## shows statistical difference at p < 0.01 when compared with similar lipolytic conditions in WT mice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Adipocytes Express AMPK Complexes Containing the α1 Catalytic Subunit—Because AMPK complexes contain one of the two catalytic subunits (α1 or α2) that respond differently to various stimuli (6Minokoshi Y. Kim Y.B. Peroni O.D. Fryer L.G. Muller C. Carling D. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2002; 415: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar, 19Minokoshi Y. Alquier T. Furukawa N. Kim Y.B. Lee A. Xue B. Mu J. Foufelle F. Ferre P. Birnbaum M.J. Stuck B.J. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2004; 428: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar), we first determined the nature of the catalytic subunit accounting for AMPK activity in adipose tissue. Isolated rat adipocytes were incubated for 1 h in the absence or presence of AICAR, a cell-permeable activator of AMPK. Western blot analysis of adipocyte lysates revealed the preponderance of the α1 catalytic subunit (Fig. 1A). To confirm this trend, AMPK complexes were immunoprecipitated from lysates using antibodies against α1 or α2 subunits or a mixture of α1 and α2 to measure total activity. Total AMPK activity was stimulated 2-fold by AICAR (Fig. 1B). In basal as well as in AICAR-stimulated conditions, the activity of α1-containing AMPK complexes is predominant and accounts for >90% total AMPK activity measured (Fig. 1, B and C). Although the activity of α2 containing AMPK complexes is extremely low, it is also significantly stimulated by AICAR. cAMP-generating Agents and Fasting Induce AMPK Activity in Adipocytes—Treatment of isolated adipocytes with isoproterenol, a β-adrenergic agonist, or BRL 37344, a specific agonist of the β3-adrenergic receptor, is followed by a robust increase of total AMPK activity (Fig. 2A) as previously described (13Yin W. Mu J. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43074-43080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 20Moule S.K. Denton R.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Forskolin, which activates adenylate cyclase independently of the β-agonist receptor, and Bt2cAMP have also a stimulatory effect on AMPK activity. Thus AMPK activity is stimulated under conditions of increased cAMP concentrations. Because fasting induces a β-adrenergic stimulation of adipocytes, we have compared AMPK activity in the epidydimal fat pad of fasted and refed rats. AMPK activity is 2-fold higher in fasted compared with refed rats (Fig. 2B). This is associated with an increase of the phosphorylation state of Ser-79 of ACC, a known target of AMPK, whereas total ACC content is not modified in these conditions. Activation of AMPK Activity Inhibits Lipolysis in Adipocytes—Because AMPK activity is increased during fasting, a state in which lipolysis is strongly induced, we next investigated the relationship between AMPK and lipolytic activity. In isolated rat adipocytes, the lipolytic rate is increased 10-fold in the presence of isoproterenol (Fig. 3A). Short-term incubations of adipocytes with AICAR or phenformin, a closely related analog of metformin, activate AMPK as shown by the increase of the phosphorylation state of AMPK Thr-172 (Fig. 3B) and strongly inhibit the isoproterenol-induced lipolysis (Fig. 3A) in a parallel manner. To demonstrate that the inhibitory effects of AICAR and phenformin on lipolysis are not linked to an impairment of the protein kinase A pathway, we examined whether the presence of AICAR or phenformin depleted the ATP concentration in adipocytes. As shown previously by others (21Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar, 22Merrill G.F. Kurth E.J. Hardie D.G. Winder W.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E1107-E1112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), AICAR does not modify ATP concentration in adipocytes (48 ± 3 nmol of ATP/106 cells in non-treated adipocytes versus 45.3 ± 2.7 in AICAR-treated adipocytes). Phenformin decreases ATP concentration in adipocytes (34.3 ± 0.6 nmol of ATP/106 cells). However, neither AICAR nor phenformin interferes with the phosphorylation on serine 133 of CREB in the presence of isoproterenol. This demonstrates that activation of lipolysis is not impaired in the presence of these compounds (Fig. 3C). AICAR and phenformin are not specific activators of AMPK. Thus to verify that their inhibitory effects on the lipolytic pathway were indeed mediated by AMPK, we overexpressed AMPK-CA in adipocytes. The AMPK-CA corresponds to a truncated catalytic α1 subunit in which the phosphorylation site (Thr-172) has been mutated to an acidic amino acid in order to mimic phosphorylation (17Woods A. Azzout-Marniche D. Foretz M. Stein S.C. Lemarchand P. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Carling D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6704-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Overexpression of AMPK-CA does not affect adipocyte viability, because after 36 h of infection, the number of adipocytes is very similar in Ad null (0.71 ± 0.11 × 106) or in Ad AMPK-CA (0.84 ± 0.02 × 106) infected adipocytes. ATP concentration into adipocytes is not statistically modified in the presence of the AMPK-CA (82.0 ± 0.65 nmol of ATP/106 cells in Ad null-treated cells versus 71.6 ± 4.1 in AMPK-CA-treated cells). Overexpression of the AMPK-CA in mature adipocytes leads to an increased AMPK activity similar to that measured in adipocytes treated for 1 h with AICAR and induces the phosphorylation of ACC on Ser-79 to the same extent than AICAR (Fig. 4A). This specific increase of AMPK activity inhibits the isoproterenol-induced lipolysis (Fig. 4B). This confirms the results obtained using AICAR and phenformin and shows that the anti-lipolytic effect of these agents was mediated at least in part by AMPK. Inhibition of AMPK Activity Using a Dominant Negative Form of AMPK Increases Lipolysis—The results shown above suggest that, when AMPK is activated, it inhibits the lipolytic pathway. If this is true, the blockade of AMPK activity in adipocytes should increase the isoproterenol-induced lipolytic rate. To test this hypothesis, we overexpressed AMPK-DN in adipocytes (17Woods A. Azzout-Marniche D. Foretz M. Stein S.C. Lemarchand P. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Carling D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6704-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The overexpression of AMPK-DN does not affect cell viability after 24 h of infection (1.10 ± 0.01 106 adipocytes in Ad null conditions versus 1.16 ± 0.05 106 adipocytes in Ad AMPK-DN conditions) and ATP concentration (62.3 ± 9.6 nmol of ATP/106 Ad null cells versus 55.10 ± 2.2 nmol of ATP/106 Ad AMPK-DN cells). The dominant negative form of the α1 subunit is effective, because it impairs the activation of AMPK by AICAR and isoproterenol as well as the phosphorylation of ACC on Ser-79 in response to AICAR and isoproterenol (Fig. 5A). Finally, the inhibition of AMPK activity, which has a small and non-significant inhibitory effect on basal lipolysis, stimulates the isoproterenol-induced lipolysis (Fig. 5B), confirming that, in lipolytic conditions, the role of AMPK is to limit the lipolytic rate. Phosphorylation of HSL by AMPK Reduces Its Translocation toward the Lipid Droplet—HSL is the key enzyme controlling lipolysis in adipocytes. The activity of HSL is regulated acutely by several mechanisms including reversible phosphorylation by a number of protein kinases and translocation from the cytosol to the surface of the lipid droplet (23Yeaman S.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). It has been previously reported that the phosphorylation of HSL on Ser-565 has no effect on HSL activity per se but abolishes the activating phosphorylation of protein kinase A on the adjacent Ser-563 (24Garton A.J. Campbell D.G. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Colbran R.J. Yeaman S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), thus finally decreasing HSL activity. Thus we have analyzed the effects of AMPK stimulation on HSL phosphorylation and translocation to the lipid droplet. Treatment of adipocytes with AICAR or expression of the AMPK-CA induces the phosphorylation of HSL on Ser-565 (Fig. 6A). A 10-min incubation of adipocytes in the presence of isoproterenol induces the translocation of HSL from the cytosol (Fig. 6B, lane 1 versus 2) to the lipid droplet (Fig. 6B, lane 5 versus 6). Prior activation of AMPK by treatment with AICAR or phenformin strongly impaired the mobilization of HSL to the droplet (Fig. 6B, lane 2 versus lanes 3 and 4 and lane 6 versus lanes 7 and 8). To assess that the default in HSL translocation after AICAR treatment is indeed mediated by AMPK, we overexpressed the AMPK-DN form to block endogenous AMPK activity. In Ad null-infected cells,"

IGF-1R is necessary for embryonic development and differentiation and is critical for normal postnatal growth. Tissue growth is centrally mediated by growth hormone causing local release of IGF-1 in the peripheral tissues, which in turn activates the IGF-1R (1Adams T.E. Epa V.C. Garrett T.P. Ward C.W.

In addition, the IGF-1R is crucial for development and growth of malignant cells (4Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 249-252PubMed Google Scholar, 5Baserga R. Hongo A. Rubini M. Prisco M.

The IGF-1R is a tetramer consisting of two ligand-binding extracellular α-subunits and two β-subunits involving a transmembrane domain, an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain and a C-terminal domain (8LeRoith D.

The mechanisms behind the regulation of IGF-1R in tumor cells are still poorly understood. Recent studies have reported an intriguing linkage between p53 and the IGF-1R pathway (6Girnita L.

This connection is interesting because it builds a bridge between a nuclear suppressor oncogene and a highly tumor-relevant tyrosine kinase at the cell surface. Recently we demonstrated that MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, whose most established role is to target and degrade p53, is associated with and ubiquitinates the IGF-1R (12Girnita L. Girnita A. Larsson O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8247-8252Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Under conditions where expression of p53 was inhibited, MDM2 was redistributed and caused ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of the IGF-1R (12Girnita L. Girnita A. Larsson O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8247-8252Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).Although MDM2 is mostly known for its role in interaction with p53, it also binds to and interacts with other molecules (13Shenoy S.K.

An interesting example is its interaction with the β-arrestins, which function as adaptor proteins for agonist-occupied G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) that are phosphorylated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (13Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Activation of the prototypic GPCR, the β2-adrenergic receptor, results in ubiquitination of both β-arrestin and the receptor. Ubiquitination of β-arrestin is required for endocytosis of β2-adrenergic receptor by clathrin-coated pits. In cells lacking MDM2, β-arrestin ubiquitination does not occur, and receptor internalization is impaired, although receptor degradation is not (13Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). The nature of the ligase(s) ubiquitinating the β2-adrenergic receptor is still unknown.Unexpectedly, β-arrestin has been demonstrated to bind to ligand-stimulated IGF-1R and promote IGF-1R internalization (18Lin F.T. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31640-31643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The role of β-arrestin in this context is unknown. Accordingly, in the present study we sought to investigate the potential role of β-arrestins in the MDM2-dependent ubiquitination and regulation of the IGF-1R.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Polyclonal IGF-1R antibodies (N-20, C-20, and H-60) and a monoclonal antibody to phosphotyrosine (PY99) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against β-arrestin 1/2 were generated in the Lefkowitz laboratory. A mouse monoclonal antibody against the human IGF-1R, a mouse monoclonal antibody to MDM2, and the proteasome inhibitor MG 132 were from Calbiochem. All other reagents unless stated otherwise were from Sigma.Cell Cultures—The human melanoma cell lines BE and DFB have been described elsewhere (6Girnita L. Girnita A. Brodin B. Xie Y. Nilsson G.

The R-(IGF-1R knock-out) and P6 (IGF-1R overexpressing) mouse cell lines (19Rubini M. Hongo A. D'Ambrosio C. Baserga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) were gifts from Dr. Renato Baserga (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). Mouse embryonic fibroblast were cultured as described elsewhere (13Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar).Small Interfering RNAs (siRNAs)—Chemically synthesized, double-strand siRNAs, with 19-nucleotide duplex RNA and 2-nucleotide 3′-dTdT overhangs were purchased from Xeragon (Germantown, MD) in deprotected and desalted form. The siRNA sequences targeting human β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 have been reported previously (20Ahn S. Nelson C.D. Garrison T.R. Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1740-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and were used to deplete endogenous β-arrestin levels in BE and DFB cell lines. The siRNA sequences targeting mouse β-arrestin 1 and 2 are 5′-AAAGCCUUCUGUGCUGAGAAC-3′ and 5′-AAGGACCGGAAAGUGUUCGUG-3′. A non-silencing RNA duplex (5′-AAUUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU-3′), as the manufacturer indicated, was used as a control for both human and mouse cells.Transfections—40–50% confluent cells in 25-cm2 flasks, split 24 h before transfection, were transfected with siRNA (see above) using the Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the modified manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 10 μl of transfection reagent was added to 300 μl of serum-free medium, while RNA mixtures containing 12 μlof20 μm (3.5 μg) RNA, and 188 μl of medium were prepared. Both solutions were allowed to stand 5–10 min at room temperature and mixed by inversion. After a 10–20-min incubation at room temperature, the entire transfection mixture was added to cells in a flask containing 3–4 ml of fresh, serum-free medium. After cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, the medium was replaced with normal (serum-containing) growth medium. After additional incubation for 24 h, cells were divided into two flasks or 6-well plates for further experiments. All assays were performed at least 2 days after siRNA transfection. Transfections with pcDNA3 β-arrestin 1 and 2 and MDM mutants were performed as described elsewhere (13Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation—The isolated cells were lysed as described elsewhere (21Girnita L. Wang M. Xie Y. Nilsson G. Dricu A. Wejde J. Larsson O. Anti-Cancer Drug Des. 2000; 15: 67-72PubMed Google Scholar). To detect IGF-1-stimulated ubiquitination in the absence of MG132 incubation, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide was added to the lysis buffer. Fifteen μl of protein G plus-A/G-agarose and 1 μg of antibody were added to 1 mg of protein material. After overnight incubation at 4 °C on a rocker platform, the immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 2,500 rpm for 2 min. The supernatant was discarded, whereupon the pellet was washed and then dissolved in a sample buffer for SDS-PAGE.SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Protein samples were dissolved in a sample buffer containing 0.0625 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, bromphenol blue, and dithiothreitol. Samples corresponding to 50–100 μg of cell protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with a 7.5 or 10% separation gel. Molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad) were run simultaneously. Following SDS-PAGE the proteins were transferred overnight to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and then blocked for 1 h at room temperature in a solution of 5% (w/v) skimmed milk powder and 0.02% (w/v) Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.5). Incubation with the appropriate primary antibodies was performed for 1 h at room temperature. This was followed by washes with phosphate-buffered saline and incubation with either a horseradish peroxidase-labeled or a biotinylated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. Following the biotinylated secondary antibody, incubation with streptavidin-labeled horse peroxidase was performed. The detection was made with either ECL (Amersham Biosciences) or by Supersignal West Pico reagents (Pierce). The films were scanned by Fluor-S (Bio-Rad).In Vitro Ubiquitination—In vitro ubiquitination of IGF-1R was performed essentially as described (22Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-MDM2 and -β-arrestin 1 (pGEX-4T1) constructs and His6-β-arrestin 2 (13Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar) were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using glutathione-Sepharose (Pierce). IGF-1R was isolated from P6 cells by immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal rabbit antibody directed against β-subunit (H60) and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). IGF-1R-Sepharose beads were mixed with or without GST-MDM2, rabbit E1 (Calbiochem), E2 bacterial recombinant UbcH5B (Calbiochem), His6-ubiquitin (Calbiochem), and with or without β-arrestins, in a 30-μl reaction. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Reaction products were loaded on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and detected using either antibody against IGF-1R (C20) or an anti-ubiquitin antibody (Santa Cruz).Analysis of IGF-1R Degradation—After the indicated experimental procedures, cells were transferred to methionine-free medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μCi/ml l-[35S]methionine (specific activity > 1,000 Ci/mm, Amersham Biosciences) for 24 h. The cells were carefully washed and transferred to radioactive-free methionine-containing medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for the indicated time periods. Cells were then quickly washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing dissolved protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Diagnostics). An equal amount of protein from each sample was immunoprecipitated with antibodies for the IGF-1R β-subunit (H-60) collected by protein A-Sepharose, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography.RESULTSIdentification of Domains in MDM2 Required for IGF-1R Ubiquitination—We have previously identified MDM2 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that can ubiquitinate the IGF-1R (12Girnita L. Girnita A. Larsson O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8247-8252Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To identify the regions involved in IGF-1R ubiquitination, we tested different deletion mutants of MDM2 for their ability to ubiquitinate IGF-1R. We transfected P6 cells (mouse cells overexpressing human IGF-1R) and BE cells (human melanoma cells) with wild type MDM2 (MDM21–491) and the C-terminal truncated variants MDM21–400 and MDM21–161. The former mutant contains the β-arrestin binding site but lacks the ligase domain, whereas MDM21–161 lacks both of these domains. The expression of the three different MDM2 variants, along with endogenous MDM2, was confirmed in Fig. 1A.We then investigated whether any of the MDM2 constructs could induce IGF-1R ubiquitination. Transfected P6 and BE cells either remained untreated or were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 before harvesting. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated for IGF-1R, and the same amounts of the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1B, bottom panels) were fractionated and immunoblotted with an ubiquitin antibody. As seen in Fig. 1B, there is a basal level of ubiquitination of IGF-1R in the control cells. The expression of MDM21–161 did not affect this ubiquitination level, whereas MDM21–491 clearly increased it (especially in P6 cells). In the presence of proteasome inhibitor MG132 the level of ubiquitinated IGF-1R clearly increased suggesting that ubiquitinated IGF-1R is targeted for degradation by the proteasome system. The high molecular (90–190 kDa) ubiquitin smears are typical for polyubiquitinated IGF-1R (12Girnita L. Girnita A. Larsson O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8247-8252Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 23Vecchione A. Marchese A. Henry P. Rotin D. Morrione A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3363-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 24Shan Y.X. Yang T.L. Mestril R. Wang P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45492-45498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cells transfected with MDM21–400 did not show any IGF-1R ubiquitination at all (Fig. 1B).We also investigated the effects of the three MDM2 constructs in their ability to bind the IGF-1R and on IGF-1R expression. Immunoprecipitation of MDM2 (using an antibody recognizing the N-terminal part of MDM2) followed by detection of the IGF-1R β-subunit was carried out. Fig. 1C confirms that MDM2 is associated with IGF-1R in the untransfected P6 and BE control cells. The MDM2/IGF-1R association in cells expressing MDM21–161 was unaffected. This association was significantly increased in MDM21–400-expressing cells (p < 0.005 in both cell lines) (Fig. 1C, graph panels), whereas it was unaffected or abolished in cells overexpressing wild type MDM2. These observations, taken together with the findings that expression of IGF-1R was reduced or deleted (Fig. 1C, bottom panels) and IGF-1R ubiquitination increased (Fig. 1B) in cells transfected with MDM21–491, suggests that full-length MDM2 associates with, ubiquitinates, and degrades the IGF-1R. Because cells transfected with MDM21–400, in contrast to MDM21–161, did not show any IGF-1R ubiquitination at all (Fig. 1B) and “stabilized” IGF-1R (Fig. 1C), it appears to produce a dominant negative effect in this context.Involvement of β-Arrestin in MDM2-dependent IGF-1R Ubiquitination and Down-regulation—The impact of the β-arrestin binding site on MDM2-dependent ubiquitination suggests a role of β-arrestins in this process. Therefore we now investigated whether β-arrestins can associate with IGF-1R and MDM2. Lysates of cultured BE cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation of β-arrestin 1 or 2 or MDM2. The obtained immunoprecipitates were analyzed for the β-subunit of IGF-1R (Fig. 2, upper panel). Both β-arrestin immunoprecipitates contained clearly detectable levels of IGF-1R. However, the IGF-1R β-subunit appears to be more associated with β-arrestin 1 than with β-arrestin 2 (Fig. 2, upper panel). The IGF-1R·β-arrestin 1 complex was expressed at higher levels in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor. It is also confirmed in this panel that MDM2 is associated with IGF-1R but only in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor. The middle panel of Fig. 2 shows that β-arrestin 1 and 2 as well as IGF-1R immunoprecipitates contain MDM2. Finally, the IGF-1R and MDM2 immunoprecipitates contain both β-arrestin isoforms (Fig. 2, bottom panel). Together, these data suggest that β-arrestins bind to both IGF-1R and MDM2 at the same time.Fig. 2β-Arrestins are associated with IGF-1R and MDM2. BE cells were harvested with or without a prior 6-h treatment with proteasome inhibitor (PI) MG 132 (50 μm). Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with β-arrestin 1 or 2 antibodies (here denoted β1 and β2) or antibodies against MDM2 and then detected for β-subunit of IGF-1R (upper panel), or subjected to immunoprecipitation with β-arrestin 1 or 2 antibodies or antibodies against IGF-1R β-subunit and detected for MDM2 (middle panel), or immunoprecipitated with an IGF-1R or MDM2 antibody and detected for β-arrestin 1 and 2 (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As mentioned above the region 161–400 of MDM2, which appears essential for IGF-1R ubiquitination, contains the earlier reported β-arrestin binding domain. This and the fact that β-arrestin can be recruited to IGF-1R (Fig. 2) raises the possibility of the involvement of β-arrestin in mediating IGF-1R ubiquitination. We investigated this possibility using an in vitro assay. We utilized recombinant MDM2, β-arrestin 1 and 2, and IGF-1R immunoprecipitated from P6 cells. All samples, which were also supplied with ligase E1 and E2, were analyzed by Western blotting for ubiquitin. The addition of MDM2 to an IGF-1R containing sample induced a clearly detectable polyubiquitination (Fig. 3A). When the β-arrestin isoforms 1 or 2 were added, the ubiquitin signals increased substantially. β-Arrestin 1 was almost 4-fold more efficient than β-arrestin 2 in this respect (Fig. 3A, lower panel). As also seen in Fig. 3A, MDM2 could, in the absence of exogenous β-arrestin, still mediate some ubiquitination of the IGF-1R. This could be explained by its interaction with endogenous β-arrestin. Consistently, we found that β-arrestin immunodepleted IGF-1R, which should be devoid of co-purifying endogenous β-arrestin, did not exhibit any ubiquitin signals when MDM2 was added (Fig. 3A, first lane from the right). In the absence of IGF-1R but in the presence of MDM2, β-arrestins, and all other reagents, no ubiquitination occurred (Fig. 3A, first lane from left). Taken together, these data strongly suggest involvement of β-arrestin in MDM2-dependent ubiquitination of IGF-1R.Fig. 3Involvement of β-arrestins in IGF-1R ubiquitination. A, in vitro ubiquitination of IGF-1R. Sepharose beads of IGF-1R, isolated from P6 were mixed with ubiquitin (Ubiq) reagents with or without GST-MDM2 or with or without GST-β-arrestin 1 or His6-β-arrestin 2 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Similar procedures were undertaken for R-(IGF-1R knock-out) as negative controls (first lane). To delete any co-purifying β-arrestins in the IGF-1R immunoprecipitate, immunodepletion using β-arrestin antibodies was performed. This β-arrestin-immunodepleted IGF-1R immunoprecipitate is shown in the last lane (on the right, marked –/– for β-arrestin). Equal amounts of the IGF-1R immunoprecipitates (IP, verified in the middle panel) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and finally detected by Western blotting using an antibody to ubiquitin. The bottom panel shows quantifications of ubiquitin signals (mean values and S.D.). All experiments were repeated four times with similar results. B, BE and DFB cells were treated with β-arrestin 1 or 2 siRNA (here denoted -β1 and -β2) for 72 h. The upper panel shows that siRNA had reduced β-arrestin 1 or 2 specifically at this time point. Separate cultures were treated with the proteasome inhibitor for additional 3 h. Equal amounts of immunoprecipitated IGF-1R were subjected to Western blot. Detection was made by ubiquitin antibodies. The bottom panel depicts quantification of the ubiquitin signals. IB, immunoblot. C, P6, BE and DFB cells were transfected with β-arrestin 1 and 2 (here denoted +β1 and +β2). Expression of each β-arrestin type (indicated as β-arr 1 and β-arr 2) is compared with wild type expression (upper panels) and effects on expression of IGF-1R β-subunit (lower panels). The untreated control cells were incubated with transfection reagents. The quantified IGF-1R signals are shown in the lower panel. All experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, we investigated whether β-arrestin was also required for IGF-1R ubiquitination in cultured cells. For this purpose we employed the siRNA technique to down-regulate the expression of endogenous β-arrestin 1 and 2 in BE and DFB cells. Analysis of the expression of β-arrestin 1 and 2 in the cell lysate confirmed that it was specifically decreased by siRNA (Fig. 3B, upper panel). The densitometry of three different determinations revealed that the decrease was 66 ± 6 and 72 ± 4% for β-arrestin 1 and 72 ± 6 and 68 ± 5% for β-arrestin 2 in BE and DFB cells, respectively. The lower panels of Fig. 3B show the effects of β-arrestin 1 and 2 siRNA on the ubiquitination of IGF-1R. The inhibition of β-arrestin 1 or 2 decreased IGF-1R ubiquitination. The signals were dramatically stronger when cells were incubated in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor before assay, suggesting that the ubiquitinated proteins are rapidly degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner. In DFB cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor, β-arrestin 1 siRNA had a stronger inhibitory effect (p < 0.01) on the ubiquitination of IGF-1R compared with siRNA against β-arrestin 2 (Fig. 3B, bottom panel). In BE cells there was no significant difference in this respect.In Fig. 3C the effect of overexpression of β-arrestin 1 or 2 on IGF-1R expression in P6, BE, and DFB cells is shown. In Fig. 3C, upper panel, the increased expression of the respective β-arrestin isoform is confirmed. The highest overexpression of the β-arrestins was seen in P6 cells. In all the three cell lines β-arrestin 1 and 2 transfections decreased the IGF-1R expression, suggesting that overexpression of β-arrestin accelerates ubiquitination and degradation of the receptor.Taken together the results presented in Fig. 3 suggest that β-arrestin functions as a cofactor or adaptor for MDM2 in ubiquitination of the IGF-1R, and in this way it can affect the expression levels of the receptor. To further elucidate the effect of β-arrestin on IGF-1R expression, we analyzed its possible influence on degradation of the receptor using pulse-chase labeling with [35S]methionine. As seen in Fig. 4,[35S]methionine-labeled IGF-1R of control BE and DFB cells (incubated in the presence of transfection reagents and control siRNA) exhibited a gradual decrease, and after 24 h ∼60% of the receptor had degraded in both cell lines. After reduction of β-arrestin 1, or both isoforms, there was almost no degradation of IGF-1R (Fig. 4). This stabilizing effect on IGF-1R was confirmed to be strongly significant in both cell lines (p < 0.005). The reduction of β-arrestin 2 in DFB cells did not affect IGF-1R degradation, which thus was comparable with the control. However, in β-arrestin 2 siRNA-treated BE cells there was a strongly accelerated decrease that significantly exceeded the control (Fig. 4B). In this experiment it was confirmed that siRNA decreased the levels of endogenous β-arrestin 1 and 2 adequately, substantially, and equally (65–76%) (data not shown).Fig. 4Role of β-arrestins in degradation of IGF-1R under basal conditions. A, BE and DFB, were treated with β-arrestin 1 or β-arrestin 2 siRNA (here denoted -β-arr 1 and -β-arr 2) or transfection reagents (control, C) for 72 h. During the last 24 h of this period, the cells were labeled with [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml). The cells were then washed and transferred to radioactive-free methionine-supplemented medium containing β-arrestin 1 or 2 siRNA or control siRNA for 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. IGF-1R β-subunit was immunoprecipitated and resolved by SDS-PAGE, and finally visualized by autoradiography. B, shows the densitometry data. The results are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload"

Nuclear receptors also have a DNA binding domain (C domain), a variable hinge (D domain), and C-terminal F regions. Ligand activation of class 1 steroid hormone receptors induces homo- or heterodimer formations, which interact with consensus or nonconsensus palindromic response elements. In contrast, class 2 receptors form heterodimers with the retinoic X receptor as a common partner, whereas class 3 and 4 orphan receptors act as homodimers or monomers and bind to direct response element repeats or single sites, respectively. The DNA binding domains of nuclear receptors all contain two zinc finger motifs that interact with similar half-site motifs; however, these interactions vary with the number of half-sites (1 or 2), their orientation, and spacing. Differences in nuclear receptor action are also determined by their other domains, which dictate differences in ligand binding, receptor dimerization, and interaction with other nuclear cofactors. Most orphan receptors were initially cloned and identified as members of the nuclear receptor family based on their domain structure and endogenous or exogenous ligands have subsequently been identified for many of these proteins (5Enmark E.

These studies are examples of ligand-independent pathways where Nur77 expression is induced and/or Nur77 protein undergoes intracellular translocation, because ligands for this receptor have hitherto not been reported. This report shows that 1,1-bis(3′-indolyl)-1-(p-substitutedphenyl)methanes containing trifluoromethyl, hydrogen, and methoxy substituents induce Nur77-dependent transactivation in Panc-28 pancreatic and other cancer cell lines. Nur77 agonists also induce typical cellular signatures of apoptosis, including PARP cleavage and induction of TRAIL, and both ligand-dependent transactivation and induction of apoptosis were associated with the action of nuclear Nur77. This study shows for the first time that ligand-dependent activation of the orphan receptor Nur77 induces apoptosis in cancer cells, suggesting that Nur77 agonists represent a new class of anticancer drugs.

The GAL-4-coactivator fusion plasmids pMSRC1, pMSRC2, pMSRC3, pMDRIP205, and pMCARM-1 were kindly provided by Dr. Shigeaki Kato (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). For RNA interference assays, we used a nonspecific scrambled (iScr) oligonucleotide as described (23Abdelrahim M. Samudio I. Smith R. Burghardt R. Safe S. J. Biol.

Leptomycin B (LMB) was obtained from Sigma, and caspase inhibitors were purchased from BD Pharmingen. The following oligonucleotides were prepared by IDT (Coralville, IA) and were used in gel mobility shift assays; NBRE, 5′-GAT CCT CGT GCG AAA AGG TCA AGC GCT A-3′; NurRE, 5′-GAT CCT AGT GAT ATT TAC CTC CAA ATG CCA GGA-3′. Transfection Assays—Transfection assays were essentially carried out as previously described using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen), and luciferase activities were normalized to β-galactosidase activity. For RNA interference studies, cells were transfected with small inhibitor RNAs for 36 h to ensure protein knockdown prior to the standard transfection and treatment protocols (22Qin C. Morrow D.

Results are expressed as means ± S.E. for at least three replicate determinations for each treatment group. Mammalian Two-hybrid Assay—Panc-28 cells were plated in 12-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/well in DMEM/F-12 media supplemented with 2.5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. After growth for 16 h, various amounts of DNA, i.e. Gal4Luc (0.4 μg), β-gal (0.04 μg), VP-Nur77(E/F) (0.04 μg), pMSRC1 (0.04 μg), pMSRC2 (0.04 μg), pMSRC3 (0.04 μg), pMDRIP205 (0.04 μg), and pMCARM-1 (0.04 μg) were transfected by Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 5 h of transfection, the transfection mix was replaced with complete media containing either vehicle (Me2SO) or the indicated ligand for 20-22 h. Cells were then lysed with 100 ml of 1× reporter lysis buffer, and 30 μl of cell extract was used for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays. Lumicount was used to quantitate luciferase and β-galactosidase activities, and the luciferase activities were normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Cell Growth and Apoptosis Assays—The different cancer cell lines were cultured under standardized conditions. Panc-28 cells were grown in DMEM/Ham's F-12 media containing 2.5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum, and cells were treated with Me2SO and different concentrations of test compounds as indicated. For longer term cell survival studies, the media was changed every second day, and values were presented for a 4-day experiment. For all other assays, cytosolic, nuclear fractions, or whole cell lysates were obtained at various time points, analyzed by Western blot analysis, and bands were quantitated as previously described (22Qin C.

Immunocytochemical analysis was determined using Nur77 antibodies as previously reported (23Abdelrahim M. Samudio I. Smith R. Burghardt R. Safe S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28815-28822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Gel Shift Assay—Cells were seeded in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 2.5% charcoal-stripped serum and treated with 10 μm DIM-C-pPhOCH3 for 30 min. Nuclear extracts were obtained using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce Chemical Co.). Oligonucleotides were synthesized, purified, and annealed, and 5 pmol of specific oligonucleotides was 32P-labeled at the 5′-end using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Nuclear extracts were incubated in HEPES with ZnCl2 and 1 μg of polydeoxyinosine-deoxycytidine for 5 min; 100-fold excess of unlabeled wild-type or mutant oligonucleotides were added for competition experiments and incubated for 5 min. The mixture was incubated with labeled DNA probe for 15 min on ice. The reaction mixture was loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide gel and ran at 150 V for 2 h. The gel was dried, and protein-DNA complexes were visualized by autoradiography using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Annexin-V Staining—Detection of phosphatidylserine on the outside of the cell membrane, a unique and early marker for apoptosis, was performed using a commercial kit (Vybrant Apoptosis Assay Kit #2, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Panc-28 cells were cultured as described above, and treated with 10 μm DIM-C-pPhOCH3 or camptothecin for 6, 12, and 24 h. Binding of annexin V-Alexa-488 conjugate and propidium iodide (PI) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. After binding and washing, cells were observed under phase contrast and epifluorescent illumination using a 495 nm excitation filter and a 520 nm absorption filter for annexin V-Alexa 488 and a 546 nm excitation filter and a 590 nm absorption filter for PI. Healthy cells were unstained by either dye; cells in early stages of apoptosis were stained only by annexin V, whereas dead cells were stained by annexin V and PI. The assay was repeated on three separate Panc-28 cell preparations. Quantitative Real-time PCR—cDNA was prepared from the Panc-28 cell line using a combination of oligodeoxythymidylic acid (Oligo-d(T)16), and dNTP mix (Applied Biosystems) and Superscript II (Invitrogen). Each PCR was carried out in triplicate in a 20-μl volume using Sybr Green Mastermix (Applied Biosystems) for 15 min at 95 °C for initial denaturing, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 1 min in the ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System. The ABI Dissociation Curves software was used following a brief thermal protocol (95 °C 15 s and 60 °C 20 s, followed by a slow ramp to 95 °C) to control for multiple species in each PCR amplification. Values for each gene were normalized to expression levels of TATA-binding protein. The sequences of the primers used for reverse transcription-PCR were as follows: TRAIL forward, 5′-CGT GTA CTT TAC CAA CGA GCT GA-3′, reverse, 5′-ACG GAG TTG CCA CTT GAC TTG-3′; and TATA-binding protein forward, 5′-TGC ACA GGA GCC AAG AGT GAA-3′, reverse, 5′-CAC ATC ACA GCT CCC CAC CA-3′. Xenograft Experiment—Male athymic nude mice (BALB/c, ages 8-12 weeks) were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). The mice were housed and maintained in laminar flow cabinets under specific pathogen-free conditions. Panc-28 cells were harvested from subconfluent cultures by trypsinization and washed. Panc-28 cells (2 × 106) were injected subcutaneously into each mouse on both flanks using a 30-gauge needle. The tumors were allowed to grow for 11 days until tumors were palpable. Mice were then randomized into two groups of seven mice per group and dosed by oral gavage with either corn oil or DIM-C-pPhOCH3 every second day. The volume of corn oil was 75 μl, and the dose of DIM-C-pPhOCH3 was 25 mg/kg/day. The mice were weighed, and tumor areas were also measured every other day. Final body and tumor weights were determined at the end of the dosing regiment, and selected tissues were further examined by routine H & E staining and immunohistochemical analysis for apoptosis using the TUNEL assay. Nur77 Expression and Structure-dependent Activation by C-substituted DIMs—Studies in this laboratory have been investigating the anticarcinogenic activities of a series of ring-substituted 3,3′-diindolylmethanes (DIMs) and methylene (C)-substituted DIMs, and many of these compounds were active in vivo and in cell culture assays (22Qin C.

Some members of a series of C-substituted DIMs activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) but not PPARα, retinoic acid receptor, retinoic X receptor, estrogen receptor α, or the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. Previous studies have linked Nur77 to decreased cell survival and activation of cell death pathways by apoptosis-inducing agents in some cancer cell lines (15Li H. Kolluri S.K. Gu J. Dawson M.I.

Fig. 1A summarizes Western blot analysis of Nur77 in whole cell lysates from 12 different cancer cell lines derived from pancreatic, prostate, breast, colon, and bladder tumors. Only the 253 JB-V-33 bladder cancer cell line exhibited relatively low expression of Nur77, and the antibodies and electrophoretic conditions gave two immunostained bands as previously reported in other studies. Western blot analysis of the other NGFI-B proteins showed variable expression of Nurr1, and Nor1 was not detectable in these cancer cell lines (data not shown). Similar results were also obtained in Jurkat T-cell leukemia cells (data not shown). Structure-dependent activation of Nur77 by a series of eleven C-substituted DIMs was investigated in Panc-28 cells transfected with a GAL4-Nur77 (full-length) chimera and a reporter construct containing five GAL4 response elements linked to a luciferase reporter gene (pGAL4). The results (Fig. 1B) showed that three compounds containing p-trifluoromethyl (DIM-C-pPhCF3) and methoxy (DIM-C-pPhOCH3) substituents or the unsubstituted phenyl group (DIM-C-Ph) activated luciferase activity. Similar results were also obtained in Panc-28 cells transfected with a construct containing a Nur response element (NurRE) (Fig. 1C), and these same compounds also activated GAL4-Nur77/pGAL4 and NurRE in MiaPaCa-1 pancreatic, HCT-15 colon, and MCF-7 breast cancer cells (data not shown). The structure-dependent activation of Nur77 was also investigated using DIM-C-pPhOCH3 as a model, and the position of the methoxyl group was changed to the meta (DIM-C-mPhOCH3) and ortho (DIM-C-oPhOCH3) positions (Fig. 1D). Only the para-substituted compound was active. We also investigated N-methyl and 2-methyl indole ring-substituted analogs of DIM-C-pPhOCH3, DIM-C-Ph, and DIM-C-pPhCF3, and these compounds did not activate Nur77 (data not shown). These results demonstrate that activation of Nur77 by C-DIMs was structure-dependent and sensitive to substitution on the phenyl and indole rings. Thus, at least three C-substituted DIMs activate Nur77; one of these compounds (DIM-C-pPhCF3) also activates PPARγ (22Qin C. Morrow D. Stewart J. Spencer K. Porter W. Smith III, R. Phillips T.

Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 5994-6001Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), whereas DIM-C-pPhOCH3 and DIM-C-Ph are PPARγ-inactive (22Qin C. Morrow D. Stewart J. Spencer K. Porter W. Smith III, R. Phillips T. Abdelrahim M. Samudio I. Safe S. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). DIM-C-pPhOH was inactive in both transactivation assays and, at higher concentrations, decreased activity lower than observed in solvent (Me2SO) control. Characterization and Interactions of C-DIMs That Activate and Inhibit Nur77-mediated Transactivation—The role of the LBD or E/F region in ligand-induced transactivation of Nur77 was investigated in Panc-28 cells transfected with pGAL4 and a chimeric GAL4-Nur77(E/F) construct containing only the E/F domain of Nur77. Treatment of Panc-28 cells with different concentrations (5-15 μm) of DIM-C-pPhCF3, DIM-C-pPhOCH3, and DIM-C-Ph induced luciferase activity, whereas no response was observed in cells treated with Nur77-inactive DIM-C-pPhOH (Fig. 2A). These results are the first to identify a series of compounds that directly activate Nur77(LBD)-dependent transactivation in Panc-28 or any other cancer cell line. The role of Nur77 in mediating transactivation was further investigated in Panc-28 cells treated with 10 or 20 μm DIM-C-pPhOCH3 or DIM-C-Ph and transfected with pNurRE, a nonspecific “scrambled” small inhibitory RNA (iScr), or small inhibitory RNA for Nur77 (iNur77). The results (Fig. 2B) showed decreased Nur77 protein in whole cell lysates and a 90-100% decrease in ligand-induced transactivation over the different concentrations of compounds, thus confirming the role of Nur77 in mediating this response. As noted above, one compound that contained a p-hydroxy substituent (DIM-C-pPhOH) did not induce activity (Fig. 1B) and DIM-C-pPhOH was further investigated as a potential Nur77 antagonist. Panc-28 cells were transfected with GAL4-Nur77/pGAL4 and cotreated with DIM-C-pPhOH and Nur77 agonists DIM-C-pPhCF3, DIM-C-pPhOCH3, and DIM-C-pH (Fig. 2C). The results show that DIM-C-pPhOH antagonizes activation of Nur77 by all three C-DIM compounds. The structural specificity of Nur77 antagonists was further investigated using meta-hydroxy (DIM-C-mPhOH) and ortho-hydroxy (DIM-C-oPhOH) analogs. DIM-C-mPhOH (10 or 20 μm) did not inhibit DIM-C-pPhOCH3- or DIM-C-Ph-induced transactivation (Fig. 2D). DIM-C-oPhOH also did not exhibit Nur77 antagonist activity (Fig. 2E); however, high doses (20 μm) of both Nur77 agonists and DIM-C-oPhOH were toxic. Thus, activation of Nur77 by C-DIMs was E/F domain-dependent and Nur77 activation was inhibited by DIM-C-pPhOH; moreover, both activation and inhibition of Nur77-mediated transactivation was dependent on the structure of the C-DIM compounds. Nur77 DNA Binding and C-DIM-induced Nur77-coactivator Interactions—Incubation of nuclear extracts from Panc-28 cells treated with Me2SO or DIM-C-pPhOCH3 with 32P-labeled NBRE and NurRE (lanes 1 and 2, and 5 and 6, respectively) gave retarded bands in EMSA assays (Fig. 3A). Retarded band intensities were decreased after incubation with 100-fold excess NurRE (lane 3) or NBRE (lane 7) but not by mutant NurRE (lane 4) or mutant NBRE (lane 8) oligonucleotides. These results show that nuclear extracts containing Nur77 bind NurRE and NBRE as dimers and monomers, respectively, and this corresponds to their migration in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Extracts from cells treated with Nur77-active C-substituted DIMs gave retarded band intensities similar to those observed for solvent-treated extracts suggesting minimal ligand-dependent loss of nuclear Nur77 in these cells. The retarded band pattern corresponds to that observed in previous studies using nuclear extracts from cells or in vitro translated Nur77 (27Philips A. Lesage S. Gingras R. Maira M.H. Gauthier Y.

Ligand-induced Nur77-coactivator interactions were determined using a construct (pGAL4) containing 5 GAL4 response elements. Coactivators used in this study include SRC-1, SRC-2 (TIFII), SRC-3 (AIB1), PGC-1, TRAP220, and CARM-1. A GAL4-repressor (SMRT) chimera was also included in the assay. All three ligands induced transactivation in cells transfected with GAL4-SRC-1, GAL4-PGC-1, and GAL4-TRAP220 chimeras. DIM-C-pPhOCH3-induced transactivation in cells transfected with GAL4-SRC-3 and GAL4-CARM-1 was slightly activated by DIM-C-pPhOCH3 and DIM-C-pPhCF3. The results demonstrate that there were some ligand-dependent differences in transactivation observed for GAL4-"

https://openalex.org/W2156646628,"The importance of inflammation in initiating the sequence of events that lead to liver fibrosis is increasingly recognized. In this study, we tested the effects of SC-236, a selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor, in rats with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver fibrosis. Livers from CCl4-treated rats showed increased COX-2 expression and 15-deoxy-prostaglandin (PG)J2 (15d-PGJ2) formation, as well as decreased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma expression. In these animals, SC-236 reduced liver fibrosis as revealed by histological analysis and by a reduction in hepatic hydroxyproline levels, metalloproteinase-2 activity, and alpha-smooth muscle actin expression. Interestingly, SC-236 normalized 15d-PGJ2 levels and restored PPARgamma expression in the liver of CCl4-treated rats. In isolated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs)--the major player in liver fibrogenesis--and Kupffer cells--the cell type primarily responsible for increased hepatic COX-2-SC-236 exhibited remarkable pro-apoptotic and growth inhibitory properties. Of interest, SC-236 decreased HSC viability to a similar extent than the PPARgamma ligand rosiglitazone. Moreover, SC-236 significantly induced PPARgamma expression in HSCs and acted as a potent PPARgamma agonist in a luciferase-reporter trans-activation assay. These data indicate that, by mechanisms involving non-parenchymal cell apoptosis and PPARgamma activation, the selective COX-2 inhibitor SC-236 might have therapeutic potential for prevention of liver fibrosis."

Thus, BACH1 likelyplays a critical role in DSBR in a manner dependent on its association withBRCA1. Genetic importance of BACH1 helicase deficiency in the promotion of breastcancer was suggested by the identification of two females among a cohort of 65women with early-onset breast cancer who carried germ line sequence changes inthe BACH1 coding region and normal genotypes for BRCA1 andBRCA2 (9Cantor S.B.

Theclinically relevant BACH1 mutations were shown to interfere with itsDNA unwinding function by either completely eliminating catalytic activity(P47A) or significantly reducing the ability of mutant BACH1 enzyme (M299I) tounwind a long (100 bp) M13 partial duplex substrate(10Cantor S.

Taken together, theevidence linking BACH1 with the hereditary breast cancer gene BRCA1and the identification of patients with mutations in the BACH1 geneitself are consistent with the hypothesis that BACH1 helicase functions intumor suppression. Although BACH1 was shown previously to unwind partial duplex DNA substrateswith very long ssDNA tails(10Cantor S. Drapkin R. Zhang F. Lin Y. Han J. Pamidi S. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S. A. 2004; 101: 2357-2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), little was known aboutBACH1 DNA interactions or the substrate preference of the enzyme. To determinewhich features of the DNA substrates are important for BACH1 to initiate theunwinding reaction efficiently, we systematically evaluated the ability ofpurified recombinant BACH1 to unwind a panel of related DNA substrates withdistinct tail variations including single-stranded versusdouble-stranded character, tail length, or backbone continuity. In addition,we have assessed the ability of BACH1 to catalytically unwind DNA structuresproposed to be key intermediates of cellular DNA metabolism. The results fromthese unwinding studies provide a platform to investigate the molecularinteractions of the BACH1 helicase with its protein partners in DSBR byhomologous recombination. Proteins—Baculovirus encoding BACH1 (wild-type or mutantK52R) with a C-terminal FLAG tag was used to infect High Five insect cells,and the recombinant BACH1 protein was purified as described previously(10Cantor S.

Briefly, High Fiveinsect cells were infected with baculovirus encoding recombinant BACH1 with aC-terminal FLAG tag. After cell lysis, recombinant BACH1 was bound to FLAGantibody resin and eluted with FLAG peptide. Purified recombinant BACH1protein predominantly migrated as a single band of the predicted size (130kDa) on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (supplemental Fig. 1), as reportedpreviously (10Cantor S.

Helicasereactions were initiated by the addition of BACH1 and then incubated at 30°C for 15 min unless otherwise indicated. Reactions were quenched with theaddition of 20 μl of 2× Stop buffer (17.5 mm EDTA, 0.3%SDS, 12.5% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 0.02% xylene cyanol). For standardduplex DNA substrates, a 10-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide with thesame sequence as the labeled strand was included in the quench to preventreannealing.

Reactions were quenched and resolved on nativepolyacrylamide gels as described above. Percent helicase substrate unwound wascalculated as described above. Typically, ∼60% of the tracker –27helicase substrate was unwound in reactions lacking competitor DNA molecule.Helicase data (% control) was expressed relative to the control reactionslacking the competitor DNA. DNA Binding Assays—Protein/DNA binding mixtures (20 μl)contained the indicated concentrations of BACH1 and 0.5 nm of thespecified 32P-end-labeled DNA substrate in the same reaction bufferas that used for helicase assays (see above) containing 2 mmATPγS or no nucleotide. The binding mixtures were incubated at 24 °Cfor 30 min after the addition of BACH1. After incubation, 3 μl of Loadingdye (74% glycerol, 0.01% xylene cyanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue) was added toeach mixture, and samples were loaded onto native 5% (19:1acrylamide:bisacrylamide) polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed at 200 V for2 h at 4 °C using 1× TBE as the Running buffer. The resolvedradiolabeled species were visualized using a Phosphor-Imager and analyzed withImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Although BACH1 helicase was shown previously to unwind linearized M13partial duplex DNA with a 5′ to 3′ directionality(10Cantor S. Drapkin R. Zhang F. Lin Y. Han J. Pamidi S. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S. A. 2004; 101: 2357-2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), the BACH1 helicase DNAsubstrate preference had not been examined previously. To determine the DNAsubstrate requirements for efficient unwinding of double-stranded DNA by BACH1helicase, we have tested a series of related DNA substrates. Moreover, wetested several key intermediates of recombination as well as standard B-formduplex DNA substrates that represent intermediates of DNA replication andrepair. BACH1 Preferentially Unwinds a Forked Duplex DNASubstrate—Initially, we tested BACH1 on a simple duplex DNAsubstrate of 19 bp flanked by a 5′ ssDNA tail of 26 nt(Table II, substrate 6). BACH1was able to unwind an increasing percentage of the substrate with greaterconcentrations of BACH1 helicase (Fig.1A). However, only 40% substrate was unwound at thehighest BACH1 concentration tested (Fig.1D). DNA unwinding studies indicate that certain DNAhelicases preferentially unwind forked duplex substrates(15Brosh Jr., R.M. Waheed J. Sommers J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23236-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar,18Ahnert P. Patel S.S. J.Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32267-32273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,19Kaplan D.L. J. Mol.Biol. 2000; 301: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar); therefore, we examinedBACH1 helicase activity on a related forked duplex substrate that was flankedby 5′ and 3′ ssDNA tails of 26 and 25 nt, respectively(Table II, substrate 15). BACH1efficiently unwound the forked duplex substrate, achieving 50% substrateunwinding at a BACH1 concentration of 0.6 nm(Fig. 1, B andD). In contrast, only 13% substrate was unwound with 0.6nm BACH1 on the 5′-tailed duplex substrate(Table II, substrate 6)(Fig. 1D). At 4.8nm BACH1, ∼80% of the forked duplex substrate was unwoundcompared with 40% of the 5′-tailed duplex substrate. These resultsindicate that BACH1 preferentially unwinds a forked duplex substrate with3′ and 5′ ssDNA arms compared with a substrate flanked by only a5′ ssDNA tail. To confirm that the unwinding activity detected was truly dependent onBACH1 and not because of contaminants in the preparation of the BACH1 protein,helicase assays were conducted on the wild-type and mutant BACH1-K52R proteinspurified in an identical manner. In the BACH1-K52R mutant protein, theinvariant lysine residue of the conserved motif I (Walker A ATPase site) ofDNA helicases was replaced with an arginine(9Cantor S.B. Bell D.W. Ganesan S. Kass E.M. Drapkin R. Grossman S. Wahrer D.C. Sgroi D.C. Lane W.S. Haber D.A. Livingston D.M. Cell. 2001; 105: 149-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). On the forked duplex(Table II, substrate 15),wild-type BACH1 unwound ∼80% of the substrate molecules in 15 min(Fig. 1, B andD), whereas no unwinding of the forked duplex byBACH1-K52R was detected (supplemental Fig. 2). The inability of the K52R BACH1mutant to unwind the forked duplex is consistent with those data previouslypublished for a 19-bp M13 partial duplex substrate(10Cantor S. Drapkin R. Zhang F. Lin Y. Han J. Pamidi S. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S. A. 2004; 101: 2357-2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), indicating that thepurified recombinant BACH1 used for the helicase analyses was enzymaticallypure. Recently the human DNA helicase CHL1 was shown to unwind with both a5′ to 3′ and 3′ to 5′ directionality of movement withrespect to the single-stranded DNA residing between the duplexes(20Hirota Y. Lahti J.M. NucleicAcids Res. 2000; 28: 917-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BACH1 shares 48%sequence homology with CHL1(10Cantor S. Drapkin R. Zhang F. Lin Y. Han J. Pamidi S. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S. A. 2004; 101: 2357-2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar,21Skibbens R.V. Genetics. 2004; 166: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar); therefore, we addressedthe possibility that BACH1 might unwind with a 3′ to 5′directionality. However, we found that BACH1 poorly unwound the substrate witha 3′ ssDNA tail of 25 nt (TableII, substrate 10) (Fig. 1,C and D), and BACH1 unwinding efficiency was notimproved with increasing BACH1 concentration. These results confirm that BACH1helicase unwinds with a 5′ to 3′ directionality(10Cantor S. Drapkin R. Zhang F. Lin Y. Han J. Pamidi S. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S. A. 2004; 101: 2357-2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The inability of BACH1to unwind with a 3′ to 5′ directionality suggests that thisactivity does not contribute to the preferential unwinding of the forkedduplex substrate by BACH1. BACH1 Preferentially Binds a Forked Duplex—The preference ofBACH1 to unwind the forked duplex substrate raised the possibility that BACH1might bind this DNA substrate more stably compared with the less efficientlyunwound DNA substrate with only a 5′ ssDNA tail. To address this, weperformed gel mobility shift assays with BACH1 and the correspondingradiolabeled DNA substrates used for the helicase assays. A shift of theforked duplex substrate (TableII, substrate 15) to a more slowly migrating species was detectedon a native 5% polyacrylamide gel in a BACH1 concentration-dependent manner.BACH1 retained its ability to shift the forked duplex in the presence ofATPγS (Fig. 2A)and also in the absence of nucleotides (data not shown). In contrast, no shiftof the duplex DNA substrate with only a 5′ ssDNA tail(Table II, substrate 6) wasdetected in the presence of BACH1 (Fig.2B, lane 6). Moreover, a reduced shift of the5′-tailed substrate compared with the forked duplex was observed atlower BACH1 concentrations (data not shown). The DNA substrate with only a3′ ssDNA (Table II,substrate 10) was bound least efficiently by BACH1(Fig. 2B, lane4). These results suggest that BACH1 preferentially binds forked duplexcompared with simpler substrates with either a 5′ or 3′ ssDNAtail, and that the binding preference may contribute to the helicase substratepreference of BACH1. BACH1 Helicase Sequestration Studies—The results from gelmobility shift assays suggested that BACH1 more stably binds the forked duplexsubstrate compared with the DNA molecules flanked by either a 5′ or3′ ssDNA tail. If BACH1 preferentially binds the forked duplex,preincubation of BACH1 helicase with unlabeled forked duplex should sequesterBACH1 and prevent it from unwinding a labeled forked duplex tracker substrate.To test this possibility, we performed helicase sequestration studies with DNAmolecules containing a 3′ ssDNA, 5′ ssDNA, or both 3′ and5′ ssDNA arms. When BACH1 was preincubated with the unlabeled forkedduplex as a competitor, significant inhibition of BACH1-catalyzed unwinding ofthe tracker substrate (TableIII, substrate 34) was observed(Fig. 3A). At allconcentrations of forked duplex molecules tested, BACH1 helicase activity onthe tracker substrate was inversely related to the amount of competitor DNApresent in the preincubation step. Preincubation of BACH1 with 1.5nm forked duplex DNA resulted in nearly a 50% reduction of BACH1helicase activity on the tracker substrate. At 6.25 nm forkedduplex, BACH1 helicase activity was reduced by ∼80% of the controlreactions lacking unlabeled forked duplex competitor(Fig. 3, A andD). Preincubation of BACH1 with the DNA duplex flanked byonly a 3′ ssDNA tail as a competitor exerted a minor effect on BACH1unwinding of the tracker substrate with only 15% inhibition at 3.12nm 3′-tailed duplex compared with ∼70% inhibition at thesame concentration of forked duplex (Fig.3, C and D). Preincubation of BACH1 with the5′-tailed duplex resulted in an intermediate level of inhibition ofBACH1 helicase activity on the tracker substrate. With a 5′-tailedduplex concentration of 3.12 nm, a 36% inhibition was detected.With a 5′-tailed duplex concentration of 12.3 nm, a 69%inhibition was detected (Fig. 3, Band D). Throughout the range of 0.75–25nm competitor DNA, the forked duplex more effectively sequesteredBACH1 than the 5′-tailed duplex. However, the 5′-tailed duplex wasable to trap BACH1 to some extent as it was more effective than the3′-tailed duplex throughout the competitor DNA titration(Fig. 3D). Theseresults suggest that BACH1 was preferentially"
https://openalex.org/W2006206972,"It is widely thought that the major patterns of distribution of tetrapods are known. New species crop up from time to time, but typically in remote tropical regions, and only rarely are they novel lineages. Amphibians appear to be exceptions: a new frog species reported in Nature (425, 711–714; 2003) was so distinct that it was placed in a new family — though it was also from an understudied tropical region in India. But the discovery of a new salamander species in the North Temperate region comes as a major surprise. Found in South Korea, the new species resembles North American genera of the Plethodontidae family. The presence of plethodontids in Asia has many phylogenetic and biogeographic implications. Nearly 70% of the 535 species of salamanders in the world are members of a single family, the Plethodontidae, or lungless salamanders1. The centre of diversity for this clade is North and Middle America, where the vast majority (99%) of species are found. We report the discovery of the first Asian plethodontid salamander, from montane woodlands in southwestern Korea. The new species superficially resembles members of North American genera, in particular the morphologically conservative genus Plethodon. However, phylogenetic analysis of the nuclear encoded gene Rag-1 shows the new taxon to be widely divergent from Plethodon. The new salamander differs osteologically from putative relatives, especially with respect to the tongue (attached protrusible) and the derived tarsus2,3,4,5,6. We place the species in a new genus on the basis of the morphological and molecular data. The distribution of the new salamander adds to the enigma of Old World plethodontids, which are otherwise restricted to the western Mediterranean region7,8, suggesting a more extensive past distribution of the family."

https://openalex.org/W1979661793,"Mitochondrial (mt) DNA depletion syndromes can arise from genetic deficiencies for enzymes of dNTP metabolism, operating either inside or outside mitochondria. MNGIE is caused by the deficiency of cytosolic thymidine phosphorylase that degrades thymidine and deoxyuridine. The extracellular fluid of the patients contains 10-20 microM deoxynucleosides leading to changes in dTTP that may disturb mtDNA replication. In earlier work, we suggested that mt dTTP originates from two distinct pathways: (i) the reduction of ribonucleotides in the cytosol (in cycling cells) and (ii) intra-mt salvage of thymidine (in quiescent cells). In MNGIE and most other mtDNA depletion syndromes, quiescent cells are affected. Here, we demonstrate in quiescent fibroblasts (i) the existence of small mt dNTP pools, each usually 3-4% of the corresponding cytosolic pool; (ii) the rapid metabolic equilibrium between mt and cytosolic pools; and (iii) the intra-mt synthesis and rapid turnover of dTTP in the absence of DNA replication. Between 0.1 and 10 microM extracellular thymidine, intracellular thymidine rapidly approaches the extracellular concentration. We mimic the conditions of MNGIE by maintaining quiescent fibroblasts in 10-40 microM thymidine and/or deoxyuridine. Despite a large increase in intracellular thymidine concentration, cytosolic and mt dTTP increase at most 4-fold, maintaining their concentration for 41 days. Other dNTPs are marginally affected. Deoxyuridine does not increase the normal dNTP pools but gives rise to a small dUTP and a large dUMP pool, both turning over rapidly. We discuss these results in relation to MNGIE."

To complicate matters,the S17N mutant of Rap1A, which a priori should behave like RasS17N,is unable to inhibit the activation of Rap1A by its exchange factor, C3G,in vitro (11van den Berghe N.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).Understanding at the molecular level how a dominant negative Ras functionsshould shed light on its cellular role and help in designing new tools todissect the signaling of Ras and other small G-proteins. Because it inhibitsthe activation of endogenous Ras, dissecting the action of a dominant negativeRas should also better our understanding of the reaction of nucleotideexchange. So far, the structure of a dominant negative Ras complex is lackingin the literature. The substitution of alanine for glycine at position 60 in v-H-Ras,v-H-RasG60A, generated a dominant negative mutant that completely abolishedthe ability of v-H-Ras to transform NIH 3T3 cells, to induce germinal vesiclebreakdown in Xenopus oocytes, and to activate the Ser/Thr kinaseRaf-1. Moreover, v-H-RasG60A inhibits the ability of v-H-Ras to induce oocytegerminal vesicle breakdown when co-injected(12Sung Y.J. Carter M. Zhong J.M. Hwang Y.W.

Biochemical characterization showed that theG60A mutation does not alter the apparent affinity of v-H-Ras or c-H-Ras forGDP, GTP, the Saccharomyces cerevisae exchange factor SDC25C, or forGAP and NF-1. However, the mutation moderately reduced the ability of SDC25Cto stimulate v-H-Ras exchange and abolished the ability of GAP or NF-1 toaccelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis. In addition, the G60A mutation slightlyattenuated the binding of Ras to Raf but severely reduced the binding toRalGDS (14Hwang M.C. Sung Y.J. Hwang Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8196-8202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). How RasG60Areverts the transforming ability of constitutively active Ras is still unclearbut conceptually, this reversion is likely to occur through sequestration ofGEFs and/or downstream effectors into nonproductive complexes. In the present work, we have undertaken the structural and biochemicalanalysis of RasG60A to understand the origin of its dominant negative effects.We show that this mutant adopts a novel open conformation in the GppNp-boundform that bears similarities to the structure of nucleotide-free Ras bound tothe catalytic domain of Sos(15Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Our structural andbiochemical results suggest a new mechanism for the unique dominant negativeeffect of RasG60A. Crystallization and Structure Determination—Wild-type Rasand RasG60A mutant (residues 1–166) were expressed as His-taggedproteins (pProEX-HTb vector) in the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain(30Hall B.E.

Proteins were purifiedon a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen) followed by a Q-Sepharose (Sigma) and a gelfiltration column. The GDP-bound nucleotide was exchanged to GppNp(31John J. Sohmen R. Feuerstein J.

For diffractionexperiments, crystals were grown at 20 °C by mixing 4 μl of 20 mg/mlRasG60A (in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 10mm MgCl2) and 4 μl of a reservoir solution. For theGDP-bound form of RasG60A, the reservoir consisted of 30% (w/v) PEG4000, 0.2m magnesium sulfate, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. For theGppNp-bound form of RasG60A, the reservoir consisted of 30% (w/v) PEG2000mme,0.15 m magnesium sulfate, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.0, and 0.3%hydrogen peroxide. The GDP-bound form crystallized in space group R32(a = 93.6 Å, c = 121.6 Å) with one copy in theasymmetric unit. The GppNp-bound form crystallized in space group I222(a = 34.3 Å, b = 81.4 Å, c = 121.3Å) with one copy in the asymmetric unit.

One-dimensional 31P NMR spectra were collectedat 5 °C in a 5-mm broadband probe on a Bruker Avance 700 spectrometer at aphosphorous resonance frequency of 283.42 MHz; 16,384 or 47,104 transientswere recorded after excitation with a 45° pulse at a repetition rate of 2s per transient. A 10-Hz exponential apodization function was applied beforeFourier transformation. The data were processed with the spectrometersoftware. Rate of Nucleotide Exchange—1 μm Ras wasincubated in a solution containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.15m NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mmEDTA, 5 μm N-methylanthraniloyl (mant)-nucleotide(Molecular Probes) in a quartz cuvette. The reaction was adjusted to 10mm MgCl2 for 5 min and the decrease in fluorescence wasmonitored following the addition of 500 μm unlabeled GTP. Totalreaction volume was 120 μl; all reactions were conducted at 25 °C, andfluorescence was monitored at each step with an excitation wavelength of 355nm and an emission wavelength of 438 nm (5 nm slit widths on a PerkinElmerLS-50B luminescence spectrometer). For the mant-GTP experiment, change in fluorescence was monitored after theaddition of MgCl2, without addition of unlabeled nucleotide. Forthe Sos-catalyzed reactions, 1 μm of the purified catalyticdomain of Sos (residues 564 to 1049) in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.15m NaCl, and 5% glycerol was added immediately after the unlabeledGppNp. Rate of GTP Hydrolysis—100 μl of 1 mm Ras wasdiluted to 1 ml in a buffer consisting of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.15m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm GTP for 20 min at room temperature.Samples were placed on ice for 5 min, then brought to 20 mmMgCl2 and immediately desalted into 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5,0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2 on a AmershamBiosciences 26/10 fast desalting column at 4 °C. Samples were concentratedto 1 ml at 4 °C, placed on ice, and divided into 20 aliquots. The GTPasereaction was started by placing the samples at 37 °C. Each 50-μlreaction was stopped at the appropriate time point by the addition of 5 μlof 0.25% perchloric acid for 30 s, followed by a pH adjustment with 5 μl of0.5 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5. Final sample pH was measured at∼5.5. Samples were centrifuged to remove denatured protein, loaded on a4.6 mm × 25-cm Beckman ultrasphere C18 column equilibrated in 50mm KH2PO4, pH 6.5, 5 mmtetrabutylammonium bromide, 1 mm sodium azide, 6.5% acetonitrile,and eluted isocratically at 1 ml/min. Eluant was monitored between 220 and 320nm and GTP/GDP peaks were identified by comparison with nucleotidestandards. Ras Activation Assay—COS1 cells were transiently transfectedwith the indicated pCGN (37Corbalan-Garcia S. Margarit S.M. Galron D. Yang S.S. Bar-Sagi D. Mol. Cell.

Cells were rinsed withphosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and incubatedwith phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1mCi/ml 32PO4 (ICN) for 4 h prior to harvest.

Clarified cell lysate was incubated with activated charcoal for 5min on ice. Ras proteins were immunoprecipitated for 40 min at 4 °C withanti-hemagglutinin antibody (12CA5) precoupled to protein A-Sepharose beads.Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed six times inbuffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1%Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.005% SDS. Boundnucleotides were eluted in 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.2% SDS for 20 min at 68 °C. Nucleotides wereresolved by thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates(Machery-Nagel) in 0.75 m KH2PO4, pH 3.4, andquantified with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Percentage GTP wascalculated with the formula [(GTP/3)/[(GTP/3) + (GDP/2)]] × 100, toaccount for differences in 32P incorporation withinnucleotides. Raf-RBD Pull-down Assay—100 nm GST-RafRBD (Raf-1residues 51–131) was incubated with Ras proteins at the concentrationsshown in Fig. 7 in 1 ml of asolution containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 2mm β-mercaptoethanol for 20 min at room temperature withgentle agitation. Glutathione-agarose beads (50 μl of a 50% slurry; Sigma)were added to each tube for an additional 20 min. Beads were pelleted andwashed twice with 1 ml of buffer, then loaded on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. Blotswere probed with pan-Ras antibody (Santa Cruz FL-189, 1:2000) and horseradishperoxidase-labeled anti-rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz SC-2004, 1:400) for Rasand with anti-GST (Santa Cruz SC-138, 1:800) and horseradishperoxidase-labeled anti-mouse antibody (Southern Biotech 1010–05) forRafRBD. Blots were developed with ECL Plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences) andexposed on a Kodak Image Station 440CF. Sos Pull-down Assay—Assays were performed as with theRaf-RBD pull-downs with the following changes. His6-Sos (100nm) was incubated with Ras at the concentrations shown inFig. 7. Samples were incubatedwith 50 μl of 50% Ni-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen). Blots were probed as abovefor Ras, then re-probed with His probe antibody (Santa Cruz SC-804, 1:400) andhorseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz SC2004,1:1000) for His6-tagged Sos. Comparison of GppNp-bound RasG60A and Wild-type Ras— We havesolved the crystal structure of the RasG60A mutant bound to the slowlyhydrolysable GTP analog, GppNp. The final model is refined to 1.84-Åresolution with low crystallographic indicators and excellent stereochemistry(Table I). A section of theelectron density around the GppNp is shown inFig. 1A. Glycine 60 in Ras is located in the conserved57DXXG60 motif of switch 2 that is part of asharp flexible turn (L4) connecting strand β3 and helix α2(16Pai E.F. Krengel U. Petsko G.A. Goody R.S. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2351-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Flexibility in thismotif, which is important for Mg2+ ion coordination andγ-phosphate stabilization(16Pai E.F. Krengel U. Petsko G.A. Goody R.S. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2351-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar,17Milburn M.V. Tong L. de Vos A.M. Brünger A. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Kim S.H. Science. 1990; 247: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), is essential for theproper cycling of Ras. Whereas the overall structures of the GppNp-bound formsof wild-type Ras (hereafter WT-Ras) and RasG60A superpose well outside theswitch regions, switch 2 is extensively reorganized and represents a newconformation that has not been previously observed in structural studies ofGDP- or GTP-bound Ras (Fig.1B). Although switch 2 is poorly ordered in WT-Ras, itsconformation is well defined in RasG60A. Residue 60 seems to be the initiatorof the switch 2 restructuring. The (φ,Ψ) dihedral angles of thisresidue change from (-80°, -10°) in the WT-Ras structure to (-58°,153°) in the RasG60A structure. The same rotation for residue 60 has beenobserved in the RasA59G mutant, which mimics the structure of an intermediatefor GTP hydrolysis (18Hall B.E. Bar-Sagi D. Nassar N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12138-12142Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thischange does not disturb only the immediate surroundings of position 60 butpropagates to the next eight residues (Gly60 to Arg68),which also undergo large shifts in their dihedral angles. One immediateconsequence of switch 2 restructuring is the displacement of switch 2 residuesaway from the nucleotide (Fig.1B). For example, the Cα of residuesGln61 and Ala66 are shifted by 4.8 and 7.3 Å,respectively, relative to their positions in WT-Ras. Another consequence is alarge change in solvent accessibility of switch 2 residues(Fig. 1, C andD). For example, Tyr64 is not solventprotected as in the wild-type structure, but is totally solvent exposed. Theobserved conformation of switch 2 is stabilized by a network of hydrogen bondsbetween the guanidinium group of Arg68 and an anion hole formed bythe main chain carbonyls of Ala59, Ala60, andGlu63. In addition, a water molecule mediates the interaction ofArg68 with the main chain amide of Ser65. Consistentwith previous reports (18Hall B.E. Bar-Sagi D. Nassar N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12138-12142Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar),our results demonstrate that Gly60 serves as a pivot for switch 2conformational changes and rationalize the conservation of a glycine at thisposition in all GTPases. An unexpected feature of the GppNp-bound structure of RasG60A is theremodeling of switch 1 to a conformation that completely pulls it away fromthe nucleotide into the solvent (Fig.2A). For example, the Cα of Phe28, theresidue that normally stabilizes the guanine ring by stacking interactions inall nucleotide-bound forms of Ras, has moved 13.1 Å from its position inWT-Ras. Thr35, which coordinates the Mg2+ ion and theγ-phosphate in all GTP-bound structures of Ras, has also moved 3.5Å (Cα) from the position it occupies in WT-Ras. This movementpropels Thr35 into the solvent(Fig. 1D) and preventsit from directly coordinating the Mg2+ ion and theγ-phosphate. The temperature factors of switch 1 residues 30 to 37 areamong the highest in the final model (50 Å2 versusan average of 28 Å2) but the electron density of this regionis clear enough to trace it. The observed conformation of switch 1 isstabilized by hydrophobic interactions between the phenyl group ofPhe28 and apolar residues provided by crystal packing and by thestrong hydrogen bonds Glu37 makes with Ala59 (2.9Å) and Ser65 of switch 2 (2.6 Å), which are not presentin WT-Ras. The strong interaction between Glu37 andSer65 maintains the C terminus of switch 1 (residues 38–40)in a conformation similar to that of WT-Ras (Figs.1B and2E). Thus, the presentconformation of switch 1 shows that when it adopts an open conformation, Rashas evolved a Phe28- and Thr35-independent way ofstabilizing the nucleotide and the Mg2+ ion. The remodeling of switch 1 and 2 affects nucleotide stabilization andMg2+ ion coordination in an unprecedented way. Specifically, thenucleotide is more solvent exposed in RasG60A than in the wild-type structure(Fig. 1C). Surfaceaccessibility calculations(19Hubbard S.J. Thornton J.M. NACCESS computer program. Department of Biochemistryand Molecular Biology, University College London, 1993Google Scholar) show that thesurface-exposed area of the GppNp has more than doubled between the RasG60A(191 Å2) and the wild-type structure (85Å2). The position of the phenyl group of Phe28 isreplaced in the RasG60A·GppNp structure by Lys147 of theconserved 145SAK147 motif(20Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). The long aliphatic sidechain of Lys147, which stabilizes the phenyl group ofPhe28 by stacking interactions in WT-Ras, now occupies the voidleft by the displacement of Phe28. Consequently, the guanine basein RasG60A is stacked between the long side chains of Lys117 andLys147 (Fig. 1, B andC). The interactions of Asn116 andAsp119 with the guanine base are conserved between WT-Ras andRasG60A. The ribose hydroxyls no longer interact with the protein main chaincarbonyls, instead the OH2′ is within hydrogen-bond distance with theside chain amino group of Lys147(Fig. 1B). As aconsequence, the ribose is more solvent exposed in RasG60A. The α- andβ-phosphates have conserved interactions with the protein(16Pai E.F. Krengel U. Petsko G.A. Goody R.S. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2351-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar) with the exception thatthey are more solvent accessible (Fig.1C). The γ-phosphate, which in WT-Ras makes directhydrogen bonds to Lys16 of the P-loop, Thr35 of switch1, and Gly60 of switch 2 is more solvent exposed, does not interactwith Thr35, and interacts with the main chain amide ofAla60 through a water molecule(Fig. 2C). Inaddition, there is no equivalent in the RasG60A structure for the watermolecule responsible for the nucleophilic attack on the γ-phosphate(16Pai E.F. Krengel U. Petsko G.A. Goody R.S. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2351-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). The Mg2+ ionmakes conserved interactions in RasG60A with one important exception. Thehydroxyl group of Thr35 is not coordinating the metal ion, as isthe case in all known GTP-bound structures of Ras, but is 6.4 Å from itsposition in WT-Ras. Instead, a water molecule completes the octahedralcoordination of the Mg2+ (Fig.2D). Thus, the G60A mutation, which confers a dominantnegative characteristic for v-H-Ras, prevents Ras from adopting an activeconformation and results in improper Mg2+-coordination. Comparison of RasG60A·GppNp with Nucleotide-freeRas— The structure of the RasG60A mutant is reminiscent ofnucleotide-free Ras (hereafter NF-Ras) in complex with Sos(15Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), which corresponds to astable intermediate on the path for the catalyzed guanine nucleotide exchangereaction. In both structures, switch 1 adopts an “open”conformation that destabilizes the Phe28/guanine base interactionand the coordination of the Mg2+ ion by Thr35, whereasswitch 2 is displaced from the γ-phosphate. In addition,Tyr64 and Tyr71, which are at the heart of the Ras/Sosinterface, adopt positions that are close to their positions in NF-Ras.However, the conformations of the switch regions in NF-Ras and RasG60Astructures are not identical (Fig.2). In particular, Phe28 and Thr35 are moredistant from the nucleotide-binding site in NF-Ras than in the RasG60Astructure (Fig. 2A).The side chain of Ala59, which in NF-Ras sterically hinders thepositioning of the Mg2+ ion to its binding site, has a wild-typeconformation in the RasG60A structure (Fig.2B). Met67, which is buried at the Ras/Sosinterface, is displaced 4.9 Å in the RasG60A structure from its positionin NF-Ras. Very likely, the presence of the catalytic domain of Sos, whichextensively interacts with residues of both switch regions, is responsible forthe observed differences in the switch regions between RasG60A and NF-Ras. Structure of RasG60A·GDP—To find out whetherthe switch regions adopt an open conformation in the inactive form of RasG60A,we solved its crystal structure. The RasG60A·GDP structure superposeswell on the WT-Ras·GDP including the switch regions(17Milburn M.V. Tong L. de Vos A.M. Brünger A. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Kim S.H. Science. 1990; 247: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar)(Table I). The GDP and theMg2+ ion make conserved interactions with RasG60A including thePhe28/guanine-ring stacking interaction. This observation showsthat the open conformation is only characteristic of the triphosphate-boundform of the nucleotide and not the diphosphate. Solution Studies—To further establish that the differencesin the conformations of the switch regions between WT-Ras and RasG60A exist insolution and are not caused by crystal packing or other artifacts, we comparedthe one-dimensional 31P NMR solution spectra of GppNp-bound WT-Rasand RasG60A. The 31P resonances are sensitive to the environment ofthe bound GppNp and thus should provide information on the conformation of theswitch regions. Fig.3A shows that in the case of the wild-type protein, thereare three distinct resonances for the α- and β-phosphates and asingle resonance for the γ-phosphate. The data are consistent with atleast three distinct states of the nucleotide-protein complex that exist inslow exchange. In the case of RasG60A, there is only a single resonance foreach of the α-, β-, and γ-phosphates. The integratedintensities of the α-, β-, and γ-phosphate resonances areequal. The data are consistent with either one static conformation of thebound GppNp or multiple conformations in fast exchange. The comparison betweenthe two NMR spectra suggests that in solution a large conformational changearound the α- and β-phosphates of the GppNp takes place because ofthe glycine to alanine mutation. One plausible explanation for the observeddifferences in the 31P NMR spectra is that in solution, the switchregions of WT-Ras and RasG60A adopt different conformations. To confirm further that the difference in the switch conformations existsin solution, we used the fluorescent nucleotide derivative mant-GTP. The mantmoiety, which is attached to the ribose hydroxyls, is located in proximity ofthe polypeptide Phe28 to Tyr32. We predicted from theGTP- and GDP-bound"

https://openalex.org/W2003218477,"The continuous need for miniaturization and increase in device speed1 drives the electronics industry to explore new avenues of information processing. One possibility is to use electron spin to store, manipulate and carry information2. All such ‘spintronics’ applications are faced with formidable challenges in finding fast and efficient ways to create, transport, detect, control and manipulate spin textures and currents. Here we show how most of these operations can be performed in a relatively simple manner in a hybrid system consisting of a superconducting film and a paramagnetic diluted magnetic semiconductor (DMS) quantum well. Our proposal is based on the observation that the inhomogeneous magnetic fields of the superconducting film create local spin and charge textures in the DMS quantum well, leading to a variety of effects such as Bloch oscillations and an unusual quantum Hall effect. We exploit recent progress in manipulating magnetic flux bundles (vortices) in superconductors3,4 and show how these can create, manipulate and control the spin textures in DMSs."

Because a region near the N terminus of DnaA is required for self-oligomerization and the loading of DnaB helicase at oriC, we asked if these functions are separable or interdependent by substituting many conserved amino acids in this region with alanine to identify essential residues. We show that alanine substitutions of leucine 3, phenylalanine 46, and leucine 62 do not affect DnaA function in initiation. In contrast, we find on characterization of a mutant DnaA that tryptophan 6 is essential for DnaA function because its substitution by alanine abrogates self-oligomerization, resulting in the failure to load DnaB at oriC. These results indicate that DnaA bound to oriC forms a specific oligomeric structure, which is required to load DnaB helicase.

Chromosomal DNA replication origins function as sites where enzymes assemble to form the replication fork machinery. In Escherichia coli, DnaA directs the assembly process by first recognizing and binding to DnaA box motifs as well as to I sites within the chromosomal origin, oriC (1Fuller R.S. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5817-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 2McGarry K.C. Ryan V.T. Grimwade J.E. Leonard A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2811-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Complexed to ATP, DnaA next unwinds a region within oriC and then recruits the replicative helicase, DnaB, to form the prepriming complex (3Bramhill D. Kornberg A.

After DnaB translocates to the apex of each replication fork, the helicase both unwinds the parental DNA and interacts transiently with primase (5Fang L. Davey M.J. O'Donnell M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 541-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 6Carr K.M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44919-44925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Primers synthesized by primase are then extended by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme under a bidirectional mode of DNA replication. In S. cerevisiae, the ORC proteins (Orc1–6) perform an analogous function, recognizing the replication origin to recruit Mcm2–7, the eukaryotic counterpart to E. coli DnaB (reviewed in Ref. 7Bell S.P. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 659-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The remarkable similarity of the three-dimensional structure of a truncated form of DnaA protein from Aquifex aeolicus to the corresponding region of archaeal Cdc6/Orc1 (8Erzberger J.P. Pirruccello M.M. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4763-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and their function at initiation suggest that all organisms utilize a common biochemical pathway. Because of the critical importance of DnaA in initiating chromosomal replication and regulating this event, structure-function studies have been performed to understand its activities (reviewed in Refs. 9Messer W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 355-374PubMed Google Scholar and 10Kaguni J.M. Lennarz W.J. Lane M.D. Encyclopedia of Biological Chemistry. 1. Academic Press, Amsterdam2004: 761-766Google Scholar). These studies reveal that DnaA comprises several functional domains (Fig. 1A). Some of these domains have been mapped to the predicted three-dimensional structure of a portion of E. coli DnaA, obtained by homology modeling to the crystal structure of the corresponding C-terminal two-thirds of A. aeolicus DnaA (8Erzberger J.P. Pirruccello M.M. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4763-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This structure lacks the N-terminal third of DnaA, which functions to recruit DnaB helicase to oriC (4Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Sutton M.D. Carr K.M. Vicente M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34255-34262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and to oligomerize DnaA during initiation (12Simmons L.A. Felczak M. Kaguni J.M. Mol. Microbio. 2003; 49: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Several studies support the conclusion that the N-terminal region of DnaA is needed for self-oligomerization. In one study, mutations mapping to the N-terminal region were defective in autoregulation of dnaA expression (13Sutton M.D. Kaguni J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 546-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Because autoregulation appears to require DnaA oligomerized at the dnaA promoter region (14Lee Y.S. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 83-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), these alleles are apparently defective in this function. In support, a separate study showed that this region (residues 2–86) could replace the dimerization domain of bacteriophage λCI repressor in transcriptional repression of the λ PR promoter (15Weigel C. Schmidt A. Seitz H. Tungler D. Welzeck M. Messer W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A third report identified specific amino acids in a predicted α-helix proximal to the N terminus (Fig. 1B) that functions in self-oligomerization, using a genetic assay measuring complementation between two inactive dnaA alleles (12Simmons L.A. Felczak M. Kaguni J.M. Mol. Microbio. 2003; 49: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These findings show that self-oligomerization of DnaA at oriC is essential for initiation. Amino acid sequence comparison of homologous DnaAs identified moderately and more highly conserved residues in the N-terminal region of DnaA (Fig. 1B), suggesting their functional importance. We undertook a mutational approach to identify amino acids that are critical for function and to ask if the functions of DnaB retention at oriC and self-oligomerization are separable. Biochemical characterization of a particular mutant DnaA carrying an alanine substitution of tryptophan at the sixth position of the primary sequence (W6A) shows that these activities are coupled. Because leucines are unusually abundant in the N-terminal 70 amino acids (Fig. 1), we also asked whether many of these leucines are functionally important. Specifically, we explored whether some of these form a variant of the leucine-rich repeat motif, because inspection did not reveal the signature motif (LXXLXLXX(N/C)XL, where X is any amino acid) involved in protein-protein interactions (reviewed in Ref. 16Kobe B. Kajava A.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Because of proteolysis of specific mutant DnaAs, it is not clear whether the leucines examined are essential for function. Replication Proteins—Wild type DnaA protein fused at its N terminus to polyhistidine (His-Tag®; Novagen) was purified from an overproducing strain carrying pKC597 (see below) as described (17Carr K.M. Kaguni J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1307-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but the step of heparin-agarose chromatography was substituted by metal chelation chromatography. Monomeric His-tagged DnaA is essentially identical to wild type DnaA in oriC plasmid replication in either a reconstituted or crude enzyme system, in binding to oriC or ATP, and in unwinding of oriC. The mutant DnaA carrying the W6A substitution was purified essentially as described above. For simplicity, the His tag modification has been omitted from the protein nomenclature of wild type DnaA and W6A. As a precaution prior to purification of W6A, DNA sequence analysis of the dnaA coding region and the upstream region confirmed the sole presence of the missense mutation in plasmid DNA isolated from a portion of the culture. Scanning densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels showed that purified monomeric W6A, obtained by Superose 12 chromatography, was 80–85% pure. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis established that the major contaminant is GroEL. We assume that GroEL in the preparation of W6A does not affect the results obtained. DnaAΔ62, which lacks the N-terminal 62 amino acids of DnaA and does not carry a His tag, was purified as described (11Sutton M.D. Carr K.M. Vicente M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34255-34262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Other replication proteins, including a crude enzyme fraction deficient in DnaA protein, have been described (4Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hwang D.S. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10633-10640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

To facilitate purification of the mutant DnaA carrying the W6A substitution, the corresponding missense mutation was introduced into pKC597 by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene). Missense mutations in the dnaA gene were also introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into pRB100 as the DNA template where dnaA is expressed from the natural dnaA promoters (20Braun R.E. O'Day K. Wright A. Cell. 1985; 40: 159-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). DNA sequence analysis of the dnaA gene and the upstream regulatory region was performed to confirm the introduction of the respective mutation and no others. M13oriC2LB5 (21Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 17918-17923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) are described in the respective references. DNA fragments carrying oriC or oriV from plasmid RK2 were prepared by cleavage of M13oriC2LB5 with EcoRI or of pSP6 with EcoRI and HincII endonucleases, respectively. Radioactive labeling of these DNAs was by end-filling with the large fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I (New England Biolabs) and [α-32P]dATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Glutaraldehyde Cross-linking—Protein cross-linking was performed at room temperature for the times indicated as described (12Simmons L.A. Felczak M. Kaguni J.M. Mol. Microbio. 2003; 49: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) in 25 μl containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 mm NaCl unless otherwise indicated, 200 ng of wild type DnaA, W6A, or DnaAΔ62 and, where indicated, 0.01% (v/v) glutaraldehyde. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 5 μlof50% glycerol, 0.2 m Tris, 1% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. After incubation at 86 °C for 5 min, the samples were electrophoresed in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (8%) and transferred to a membrane (Protran; Schleicher & Schuell). The appearance on the membrane of prestained molecular weight markers (myosin H-chain, 203.5 kDa; phosphorylase b, 101.4 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 69.5 kDa; and ovalbumin, 44.1 kDa; Invitrogen) co-electrophoresed in the gel confirmed protein transfer. Immunodetection was with M43 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes an epitope within residues 133–141 of DnaA (25Marszalek J. Zhang W. Hupp T.R. Margulies C. Carr K.M. Cherry S. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18535-18542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), or with rabbit antiserum that recognizes the C-terminal 89 amino acids to detect DnaAΔ62. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Bio-Rad), chemiluminescence (Supersignal; Pierce) was detected with x-ray film (X-Omat, Eastman Kodak Co.). Genetic Analysis of the N-terminal Region of DnaA—We investigated the function of 10 amino acid residues contained within an N-terminal region of DnaA (see Fig. 1), asking whether these residues are essential. As previous results implicate the function of this region in self-aggregation (12Simmons L.A. Felczak M. Kaguni J.M. Mol. Microbio. 2003; 49: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we also wondered whether those leucines found to be essential form a variant of the leucine rich motif, which is involved in protein-protein interactions (16Kobe B. Kajava A.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). By site-directed mutagenesis, the respective codons were altered to encode alanine, the missense mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis of the dnaA gene and the upstream regulatory region, and the alleles carried in pBR322 were analyzed for their ability to maintain an oriC plasmid upon its transformation. To exclude the contribution of the chromosomal dnaA gene, the host strain (MS3898, see genotype in the legend to Fig. 2) lacked the chromosomal dnaA locus. As a control, we included the P28L allele that we characterized previously (26Sutton M.D. Kaguni J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Its partial activity appears to be consistent with earlier observations that P28L is active at 30 °C but less so at 42 °C. The results indicate that L3A, F46A, and L62A were comparable or nearly comparable with wild type dnaA in supporting DNA replication of the oriC plasmid, whereas L10A was about 3-fold reduced in activity. Compared with previous studies of an L10S substitution (27Mima S. Makise M. Koterasawa M. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 881-887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which showed no effect on DnaA function in initiation, substitution of leucine 10 by alanine caused a modest reduction in activity. The remaining alleles either failed to maintain the oriC plasmid, or were greatly reduced in function as with L38A. In interpreting the phenotypes of the alleles, we were concerned that an amino acid substitution may alter protein conformation to increase the susceptibility of a mutant DnaA to proteolysis. Consequently, the inactive phenotype of an allele may arise from a partially proteolyzed protein, which is nonfunctional, or an inadequate steady-state level for oriC plasmid maintenance. To address this concern, we performed immunoblot analysis to approximate roughly the levels of the mutant proteins relative to DnaA+ and to determine whether any were proteolyzed. Compared with DnaA+, we found that L3A, F46A, and L62A were indistinguishable in size, and their steady-state levels were similar or elevated severalfold (Fig. 2). For these mutants, we conclude that the amino acid substitution does not impair DnaA function in initiation, although F46A is apparently slightly defective. L10A was comparable in size to DnaA+, but its relative abundance was greatly reduced, which may explain its partial activity in maintaining the oriC plasmid. In contrast, we failed to detect L13A with either a monoclonal antibody that recognizes an epitope within residues 133–141 of DnaA (Fig. 2) (25Marszalek J. Zhang W. Hupp T.R. Margulies C. Carr K.M. Cherry S. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18535-18542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) or an antibody that binds to the C-terminal 89 amino acids of DnaA (data not shown). These results suggest that L13A is rapidly degraded. A portion of the remaining mutant DnaAs was partially proteolyzed, supporting the idea that these appear inactive not because the substitution affects function but because proteolyzed forms interfere with the activity of the intact protein at oriC. Because we detected similar partially proteolyzed forms with either antibody (Fig. 2; data not shown), these results suggest that proteolytic cleavage is within the N-terminal 133 residues. Tryptophan 6 Is Required for DnaA Function at oriC—Because tryptophan 6 is highly conserved, we focused among the defective mutants on characterizing the mutant DnaA carrying the W6A substitution in initiation at oriC. To discern whether the inability of W6A to maintain the oriC plasmid is from the mutation itself or arises from interference by a proteolyzed form, we undertook a biochemical approach, purifying the intact protein from an overproducing strain. Interestingly, we found no evidence of proteolysis after induced expression of the mutant DnaA or at various steps of purification (see comments under “Discussion”). We then characterized purified W6A in several biochemical assays. In measuring its activity in oriC plasmid replication, we found that W6A was almost inert (Fig. 3A). Because the oligomerization of DnaA at oriC is required for initiation (12Simmons L.A. Felczak M. Kaguni J.M. Mol. Microbio. 2003; 49: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), W6A added to reactions containing wild type DnaA should inhibit oriC plasmid replication if the defect of a single W6A protomer inactivates the function of the DnaA oligomer. If W6A is inactive in self-oligomerization, the mutant DnaA should not inhibit DnaA+ activity in initiation. To distinguish between these possibilities, we added increasing amounts of the mutant DnaA to reactions containing a near optimal but subsaturating amount of DnaA+ protein (50 ng). At the lowest level of W6A (25 ng), the modest stimulation most likely reflects experimental variability because the level of DNA synthesis is comparable with that obtained with no additional DnaA+ protein (Fig. 3B). Compared with these levels of DNA synthesis, the relative inhibition observed with W6A at higher amounts was similar to that seen with DnaA+. Thus although W6A is essentially inactive by itself, it apparently does not severely interfere with initiation by wild type DnaA, suggesting that W6A may fail to oligomerize with DnaA+ bound to oriC. Interestingly, the inactivity of W6A in initiation with a supercoiled oriC plasmid contrasts with its activity with a single-stranded DNA carrying a DnaA box in a hairpin structure (Fig. 3C). With this DNA, DnaA binds to the DnaA box hairpin to recruit DnaB helicase, which in turn interacts with primase to synthesize primers for DNA replication (22Masai H. Nomura N. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15134-15144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Carr K.M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39815-39822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These primers are extended by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme to convert the single-stranded DNA to duplex form. These results indicate that the deficiency of W6A is specific for oriC and that the substitution does not affect either helicase recruitment or sequence-specific DNA binding, the latter activity for which we confirm directly below. W6A Is Active in Binding to the DnaA Boxes of oriC and RK2 oriV—Because the DNA binding domain of DnaA is contained in its C-terminal 94 amino acids (29Roth A. Messer W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2106-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we expected that recognition of the DnaA box sequence by W6A would be unimpaired. To confirm our expectation, gel mobility shift analysis was done with a DNA fragment carrying oriC (Fig. 4A). We substantiated previous observations that wild type DnaA forms six discrete complexes, which reflect the binding of DnaA to the individual DnaA boxes within oriC and the different affinities of DnaA to these sites (30Margulies C. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17035-17040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). W6A bound comparably to this DNA fragment as DnaA+, and the small differences of the mutant DnaA compared with the control arise from experimental error based on a comparison of this experiment to others like it. These results indicate that the amino acid substitution does not alter sequence-specific DNA binding. We also measured DNA binding to the RK2 plasmid replication origin (oriV) (Fig. 4B), which has four DnaA boxes organized as two sets of inverted repeats (31Konieczny I. Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Blasina A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20173-20178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). At a low ratio of DnaA to oriV, previous gel mobility shift analyses showed that a complex named Complex I is never seen in the absence of Complex II (24Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Konieczny I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17918-17923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Complex I of greater electrophoretic mobility than Complex II is retarded compared with the unbound oriV fragment. These results suggest that DnaA molecules bound to individual DnaA boxes interact to form Complex II. In support, DNA binding is sequential if the rightmost DnaA box is inverted. Because of recent evidence that residues in an N-terminal region of DnaA function in self-oligomerization (12Simmons L.A. Felczak M. Kaguni J.M. Mol. Microbio. 2003; 49: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and the possibility that Complex II formation at oriV may involve cooperative binding, we examined W6A in gel mobility shift assays with an oriV-containing DNA. At lower DnaA+ levels, we confirmed that Complex I was not detected without Complex II. W6A was essentially identical to DnaA+ in binding to this DNA, indicating that the W6A substitution does not affect the binding to oriV. W6A Is Active in ATP Binding and ATP Hydrolysis—High affinity ATP binding by DnaA protein is required for initiation at oriC (32Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1987; 50: 259-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). To find if the W6A substitution affected ATP binding, we performed nitrocellulose filter binding assays, which showed that the mutant DnaA bound ATP with an affinity comparable to DnaA+ (KD of 0.14 and 0.1 μm, respectively; Fig. 5A). The ratio of ATP bound per monomer was also similar (0.29 ATP/W6A; 0.24 ATP/DnaA+). DnaA is also a weak ATPase (32Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1987; 50: 259-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). ATPase assays revealed that the rate of ATP hydrolysis by W6A, as indicated by the appearance of W6A complexed to ADP, was similar to DnaA+ (Fig. 5B). After 30-min incubation, the greater amount of DnaA complexed to ADP compared with W6A-ADP appears to be from the increased amount of ATP bound by DnaA+ than by W6A at the onset of this experiment. Summarizing the above results, the inactivity of W6A in oriC plasmid replication is not from defects in nucleotide hydrolysis or in binding to ATP or the DnaA box sequence. W6A Is Defective in Self-oligomerization—In a recent overlapping study, we examined the function of consecutive amino acids (Leu5, Trp6, Gln7, Gln8, and Cys9) in a predicted α-helix next to the N terminus and showed genetically that all except Gln7 are required for self-oligomerization (12Simmons L.A. Felczak M. Kaguni J.M. Mol. Microbio. 2003; 49: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We also presented preliminary evidence that W6A is defective in self-oligomerization in a glutaraldehyde cross-linking assay. To extend these observations, we investigated the experimental conditions that are important to measure self-oligomerization and describe these results below. We found that cross-linked complexes of wild type DnaA were detectable in buffer supplemented with 0.1 m sodium chloride but not with 0.3 m or greater (Fig. 6A), suggesting the importance of ionic interactions in self-oligomerization. In 0.1 m sodium chloride, cross-linking of W6A was reduced compared with DnaA+. In 0.2 m sodium chloride, cross-linking of DnaA+ increased with incubation time, but this was much less so with W6A (Fig. 6B). These results clearly indicate that tryptophan 6 functions in self-oligomerization. However, its substitution by alanine reduces but does not abolish cross-linking, prompting us to test whether other residues located in the N-terminal region account for the residual level of crosslinking. When we examined a truncated DnaA lacking the N-terminal 62 amino acids, we detected a negligible amount of cross-linked protein between the 101- and 203-kDa markers or above the latter, compared with those complexes observed with DnaA+ (Fig. 6C). The paucity of cross-linked DnaAΔ62 contrasts with the complexes formed by W6A, albeit at a reduced rate. Thus, it appears that additional residues within the N-terminal 62 amino acids participate in cross-linking. In Fig. 6C, we also note a species at or below the 101-kDa marker for both DnaA+ and DnaAΔ62, respectively, which increases in abundance upon glutaraldehyde treatment. These are likely to be dimers, which happen to have resisted the reduced and denaturing conditions of the analysis in the absence of the cross-linker. Their comparable increase in amount after cross-linking with both proteins suggests the involvement of a region separate from the N-terminal region implicated above. W6A Fails to Retain DnaB at oriC—Because the loading of DnaB at oriC requires that DnaA first oligomerizes at this locus (19Felczak M.M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51156-51162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the results of Fig. 6 predict that W6A should fail to retain DnaB helicase at oriC. To test this prediction, we incubated W6A, DnaB, and DnaC with an oriC plasmid under conditions optimal to form the prepriming complex. DnaC must accompany DnaB in the DnaB-DnaC complex to assemble the prepriming complex, after which DnaC departs (33Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2469-2475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To measure formation of the prepriming complex by the retention of DnaB on the oriC plasmid, we separated the plasmid DNA and proteins bound to it from unbound proteins by gel filtration chromatography and performed quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays on the isolated complex (Table I). We calculated a ratio of about two W6A monomers and near background levels of DnaB per oriC plasmid, indicating that the mutant protein's defect in self-oligomerization leads to the failure to recruit DnaB to oriC. When we assembled the prepriming complex with DnaA+ instead, the ratio of about six DnaA monomers per plasmid DNA is generally consistent with previous results and is lower than the expected ratio of 10 monomers per oriC (6Carr K.M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44919-44925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 19Felczak M.M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51156-51162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The ratio of close to 11 DnaB monomers per plasmid DNA substantiates observations that two DnaB hexamers are positioned at oriC, one for each replication fork to sustain bidirectional DNA replication (5Fang L.

Once loaded at oriC, DnaB helicase can unwind the oriC plasmid. In the presence of DNA gyrase to remove the positive superhelicity that accumulates in the duplex portion of the plasmid, a highly negatively supercoiled DNA results, which can be detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. On comparison of W6A to DnaA+, we found that the mutant was far less active (Fig. 7). Thus tryptophan 6 functions in self-oligomerization, which is required to load DnaB at oriC. Mutational Analysis of the N-terminal Region of DnaA Protein—Previous studies indicate that the N-terminal region of DnaA is essential, apparently needed both to retain DnaB at oriC (11Sutton M.D. Carr K.M. Vicente M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34255-34262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and to support the association between and/or among DnaA monomers (12Simmons L.A. Felczak M. Kaguni J.M. Mol. Microbio. 2003; 49: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To explore whether these functions are separate or interdependent, we undertook a mutational approach by substituting alanine for conserved residues in the N-terminal region and then measuring oriC plasmid maintenance in a host strain lacking the chromosomal dnaA gene. The analysis identified mutant DnaAs that appeared to be inactive in initiation. At the onset, we were concerned that an alanine substitution may alter the structure of the respective mutant protein to increase its susceptibility to proteolysis, reducing its steady-state level to be insufficient to support initiation. Alternatively, proteolyzed forms, which retain a subset of functions, may fail to support initiation but interfere with the activity of the intact protein, thus complicating the interpretation of results. To address these concerns, we performed immunoblot analysis of the mutant DnaAs expressed in a dnaA null host (E. coli MS3898) and found that L13A was undetectable, and W6A, L17A, P28L, L38A, L40A and I59A were partially proteolyzed. For the latter set, we cannot determine whether their phenotypes result from the respective substitution or from proteolyzed forms that interfere with the activity of the intact protein. Proteolysis of W6A was strain-dependent because it was not observed in derivatives of E. coli C600, MC1061, or in BL21(DE3) from which it was purified after overproduction. 1M. M. Felczak, L. A. Simmons, and J. M. Kaguni, unpublished results. Proteolysis of L17A and P28L also appeared to be strain-dependent because it was not observed in C600 or MC1061, whereas degradation of L38A, L40A, and I59A appeared to be strain-independent. In contrast, L3A, L62A, and F46A were not proteolytically unstable, and their ability to maintain the oriC plasmid indicates that these residues are not functionally important. The Loading of DnaB at oriC Depends on Oligomerized DnaA—This report and recent findings (12Simmons L.A. Felczak M. Kaguni J.M. Mol. Microbio. 2003; 49: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) show by the independent methods of chemical cross-linking, prepriming complex formation, and allelic complementation that DnaA oligomerizes via a predicted α-helix nearest the N terminus and that oligomerization is necessary to load DnaB at oriC. Leucine 17 in an unstructured region near the end of this predicted α-helix also appears to function in oligomerization (27Mima S. Makise M. Koterasawa M. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 881-887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A separate study showed that a conserved motif (Box VII) of DnaA, which is shared by ATPases of the AAA+ family (35Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is required for initiation and that an alanine substitution for arginine 281 within this motif inactivates DnaA function because the mutant DnaA fails to oligomerize (19Felczak M.M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51156-51162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As with W6A, this defect leads to the inability of DnaA to recruit DnaB to oriC. Hence self-oligomerization involves two regions of DnaA. We confirmed in Fig. 4 earlier observations that DnaA binds to the DnaA boxes within oriC in an ordered manner, which arises from the different affinities of DnaA (R4 > R1 > R2 > R3) for these sites (30Margulies C. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17035-17040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although the high affinity DnaA boxes R1 and R4 are identical, DnaA interacts with flanking sequences that influence binding affinity (36Fujikawa N. Kurumizaka H. Nureki O. Terada T. Shirouzu M. Katayama T. Yokoyama S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2077-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), leading to preferential binding to R4 over R1. The remaining DnaA boxes are similar but not identical to explain their lesser affinities and surface plasmon resonance measurements of the affinities of DnaA to R4 (KD = 0.6 ± 0.2 nm) and R2 (KD = 5.0 ± 1.0 nm) support these results (37Blaesing F. Weigel C. Welzeck M. Messer W. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We suggest that after DnaA binds sequentially to the DnaA boxes of oriC, it oligomerizes to form a specific stable complex. Despite the strong affinities of DnaA to DnaA boxes R1 and R4, DnaA rapidly dissociates from them (37Blaesing F. Weigel C. Welzeck M. Messer W. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 38, Margulies, C. A. (1997) The Influence of IHF and FIS on the Ordered Binding of DnaA Protein to oriC, the E. coli Chromosomal Origin. Ph.D thesis, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MIGoogle Scholar). Thus, although the caging effect of the polyacrylamide gel (39Vossen K.M. Fried M.G. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 245: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 40Fried M.G. Liu G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5054-5059Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) appears to stabilize W6A bound to the individual DnaA boxes of oriC in gel mobility shift assays, self-oligomerization of DnaA is essential to retain DnaA at oriC and in the prepriming complex (Ref. 19Felczak M.M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51156-51162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar and this work). That DnaA self-oligomerizes correlates well with DnaA as a member of the AAA+ family of oligomeric ATPases (35Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is attractive to consider that the DnaA oligomer assembled at oriC is required to load DnaB, itself a hexameric oligomer, the loading of DnaB by DnaA bound to the DnaA box contained in a hairpin structure of a single-stranded DNA does not require the oligomeric form of DnaA (Ref. 19Felczak M.M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51156-51162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar and this work), so this replication system somehow bypasses this requirement."

The gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, and membranes from the expression strain of E. coli but not from a control strain of E. coli were shown to convert phosphoribose diphosphate and decaprenyl phosphate into decaprenylphosphoryl-5-phosphoribose. Neither UDP-galactose nor GDP-mannose was active as a sugar donor. The enzyme favored polyprenyl phosphate with 50–60 carbon atoms, was unable to use C-20 polyprenyl phosphate, and used C-75 polyprenyl phosphate less efficiently than C-50 or C-60.

The Rv3806c gene encoding 5-phospho-α-d-ribose-1-diphosphate:decaprenyl-phosphate 5-phosphoribosyltransferase is known to be essential for the growth of M. tuberculosis, and the tuberculosis drug ethambutol inhibits other steps in arabinan biosynthesis.

Thus the Rv3806c-encoded enzyme appears to be a good target for the development of new tuberculosis drugs. The cell wall core of Mycobacterium tuberculosis consists of an inner peptidoglycan layer and an outer lipid mycolic acid layer (1Crick D.C. Brennan P.J. McNeil M.R. Rom W.N. Garay S.M. Tuberculosis. 2nd Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2004: 115-134Crossref Google Scholar). These two layers are connected by the polysaccharide arabinogalactan (1Crick D.C. Brennan P.J. McNeil M.R. Rom W.N. Garay S.M. Tuberculosis. 2nd Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2004: 115-134Crossref Google Scholar). The structure of arabinogalactan is conveniently divided into three regions, namely the linker region (2McNeil M. Daffe M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18200-18206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a d-galactofuranosyl region (3Daffe M. Brennan P.J. McNeil M. J. Biol.

Rv3806c, which shows homology to the noeC gene of A. caulinodans, was hypothesized to be the 5-phospho-α-d-ribose-1-diphosphate:decaprenyl-phosphate 5-phosphoribosyltransferase gene because of its transmembrane domains and its homology to prenyl transferases. Hence, efforts to clone and express this gene and characterize the protein product are reported here. PCR—The forward primer sequence was 5′-CATATGAGTGAAGATGTGGTGACTCAACC-3′; an NdeI restriction site was included at the 5′ end (bases underlined). The reverse primer sequence was 5′-GGATCCCTAGCCGAAGGCAACAGCGGC; a BamHI restriction site was included at the 5′ end (bases underlined), and the stop codon was located adjacent to the BamHI site. M. tuberculosis H37Rv chromosomal DNA and Vent DNA polymerase (Bio-Lab, Inc.) were used in the PCR reactions. The thermocycler parameters were initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, 25 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, primer annealing at 60 °C for 1 min, extension at 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR-generated DNA was purified with QIAEX II agarose gel extraction kit (Qiagen) from the agarose gel. Cloning and Expression—The purified PCR DNA fragment was ligated to pSTBlue-1 plasmid (blunt vector) using the Perfectly Blunt cloning kit (Novagen, Inc., San Diego, CA). DH5α (Invitrogen)-competent cells were then transformed with 1 μl of the ligation mixture. Single colonies were isolated, and a correct plasmid (Rv3806c:pST-Blue-1) was identified by restriction digests followed by DNA sequencing. The gene was then cloned into pET16b by digestion of Rv3806c: pSTBlue-1 with NdeI and BamHI, followed by ligation into the pET16b vector to yield pET16b:Rv3806c. Because of the high frequency of mutation of Rv3806c during cloning, this plasmid was also sequenced before transformation into the expression cells. For expression, pET16b:Rv3806c was transformed into the Escherichia coli strains BL21(DE3) (Novagen), BL21(DE3) codon plus (Novagen), ER2566 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), C41(DE3) (12Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar), and BL21(DE3) containing pKJE7 (Takara Mirus Bio Inc., Madison WI), which encodes for the chaperones DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE. The E. coli ER2566, which yielded active expression, is the ER2566 genotype F– λ– fhuA2 [lon] ompT lacZ::T7 gene1 gal sulA11 Δ(mcrC-mrr)114::IS10 R(mcr-73::miniTn10-TetS)2 R(zgb-210::Tn10)(TetS) endA1 [dcm]. For expression, the cell cultures were induced using 0.4 mm isopropyl-1thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at room temperature for 4 h. The cells were harvested, resuspended in buffer A (50 mm MOPS (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and sonicated or treated with a French press to break the cells. The cells were then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min to separate the supernatant and pellet. When preparing membranes, the supernatant was then ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the resulting membrane-enriched pellet was then removed and homogenized in a small amount of buffer A. SDS-PAGE was run using 12% gels, and proteins were visualized by Western blot or silver staining. Before loading to the gel, the membrane proteins were treated at 45 °C for 10 min in loading buffer rather than boiled, as is commonly done. The lower temperature incubation in loading buffer was absolutely essential for the detection of expressed Rv3806c protein by SDS-PAGE. For Western blots, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were used, and monoclonal anti-polyhistidine (mouse IgG2a isotype; Sigma) followed by anti-mouse-IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma) were used as primary and secondary antibodies. Phosphoribose Transferase Assay—The phospho[14C]ribosyl diphosphate (p[14C]Rpp) substrate was prepared enzymatically from [14C]glucose as described (10Scherman M.S. Kalbe-Bournonville L. Bush D.

Each standard 30-μl reaction contained 0.18 nmol (45 nCi) of HPLC p[14C]Rpp, 4 μg of decaprenyl phosphate (DP), 5 μg of membrane protein, and 0.25 or 1% CHAPS in buffer A. The DP was initially dissolved in 7.5% CHAPS, which allowed for its reproducible addition to the reaction mixtures. This procedure set a practical lower limit of 0.25% CHAPS (final concentration). To determine lipid specificity, geranylgeranyl monophosphate (C-20), C-60-prenyl monophosphate, or C-75-prenyl monophosphate were used instead of DP. Other changes in the reagents or concentrations were as described in the legends to Figs. 2 and 5 as shown in Figs. 5, 6, 7, 8. After incubation at 37 °C (for 30 min unless specified otherwise), the reactions were quenched by adding 560 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1) and 64 μl of water. In the experiment showing the conversion of DPPR to DPR, the initial incubation was for 10 min followed by the addition of 20 units of alkaline phosphatase and further incubation for 30 min before the addition of the organic solvents. For the determination of the apparent Km of pRpp, the reaction time was reduced to 5 min, and various amounts of non-radioactive pRpp (MP Biomedicals, Aurora, OH) were added. After separation of the organic layer from the aqueous layer, a portion of the organic phase was counted. For thin layer chromatography (TLC) analysis, the remaining organic phase was evaporated to dryness and then resuspended in chloroform/methanol/ammonia hydroxide (1 m) (65:25:4). Samples were loaded on an aluminum-backed silica gel (60 F254; Merck) TLC plate, and the plate was run in chloroform/methanol/water/concentrated ammonia hydroxide/ammonium acetate (1m) (180:140:23: 9:9). Autoradiography was carried out by exposing X-OMAT AR film (Kodak) to the TLC plate for a couple of days at –80 °C.Fig. 5A, the activity of DPPR synthase in various amounts of CHAPS detergent.

Instead the membranes containing the decaprenylphosphoryl-5-phospho[14C]ribose were isolated by 100,000 × g centrifugation and then treated with buffer A only (control) or buffer A containing 5 mm inorganic pyrophosphate. After 15 min of incubation the membranes were removed by ultracentrifugation, and the supernatant was analyzed for p[14C]Rpp by HPLC (10Scherman M.S. Kalbe-Bournonville L. Bush D. Xin Y. McNeil M. J.

Characterization of the Product of DPPR Synthase—The organic phase from the phosphoribose transferase assay was dried and then hydrolyzed for 30 min with 0.2 m trifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C. After removal of the acid by evaporation and two evaporations with methanol, an aliquot of the sample was analyzed by ion exchange using a PA-1 column as described (10Scherman M.S.

The remainder was treated with alkaline phosphatase (10 units in buffer A) and then analyzed by ion exchange on the PA-1 column using the conditions for neutral sugars (10Scherman M.S.

Identification of Rv3806c as a Candidate for the Gene Encoding 5-Phospho-α-d-ribose-1-diphosphate:Decaprenyl-phosphate 5-Phosphoribosyltransferase—Earlier studies by some of us revealed that A. caulinodans d-arabinofuranosylated the nod factor produced by this nitrogen-fixing symbiotic organism (11Mergaert P. D'Haeze W. Fernandez-Lopez M. Geelen D. Goethals K. Prome J.C. Van Montagu M. Holsters M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 13Mergaert P. Ferro M. D'Haeze W. Van Montagu M. Holsters M. Prome J.C. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1997; 10: 683-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a gene cluster responsible for this arabinosylation was identified by knock-out experiments.3 The gene cluster contained four genes named noeC (11Mergaert P. D'Haeze W. Fernandez-Lopez M. Geelen D. Goethals K. Prome J.C. Van Montagu M. Holsters M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), noeH, noeO, and noeP. BLAST search analyses revealed that the first three genes had significant homology to genes in mycobacteria, whereas the last gene, noeP, did not. The proteins encoded by noeH and noeO both showed homology to oxido-reductase enzymes and, thus, were suspected as being involved in the epimerization of the ribosyl residue to the arabinosyl residue; indeed, we have now shown that this epimerization is a two step process and that a keto-pentosyl intermediate is involved.2 In contrast, a BLAST search of the protein encoded by noeC and its homolog in M. tuberculosis, Rv3806c, revealed a conserved domain found in prenyl transferase enzymes (COG0382, UbiA, 4-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferase domain (14Marchler-Bauer A. Bryant S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W327-W331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar); Rv3806c showed a score of 103 and an E-value of 3e-23), suggesting a polyprenyl phosphate binding domain as would be required for 5-phospho-α-d-ribose-1-diphosphate:decaprenylphosphate 5-phosphoribosyltransferase (now referred to more simply as DPPR synthase). Also, homologs to Rv3806c were found in all mycobacteria that have been sequenced and, in an insertional mutagenesis study of M. tuberculosis, Rv3806c was found to be an essential gene (15Sassetti C.M. Boyd D.H. Rubin E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar). The search for a phosphoribose transferase domain was inconclusive. There was some homology to Pribosyltran, a phosphoribosyl transferase domain (Pfam accession number PF00156.11), but this overlapped the area identified as the polyprenyltransferase domain. Analysis by the SOSUI prediction system for membrane proteins (16Hirokawa T. Boon-Chieng S. Mitaku S. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 378-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar) revealed nine transmembrane-spanning domains of the protein, again consistent with what was expected for DPPR synthase. Although the bioinformatics data were far from conclusive, they were suggestive enough that Rv3806c was deemed to be a suitable DPPR synthase gene candidate, and efforts to confirm this hypothesis were undertaken. Cloning and Expression of M. tuberculosis Rv3806c—The general cloning strategy involved PCR, ligation into pST-Blue-1, excision of the gene followed by cloning into pET16b, and transformation into an expression strain. In early experiments, PCR products ligated into pSTBlue-1 with the correct sequence were later found to have mutations after amplification in our hands in the NovaBlue cloning strain. Finally, it was recognized that for this gene the use of DH5α as the cloning strain allowed such mutations to be avoided. Several expression strains of E. coli were then tested including BL21(DE3), C41(DE3), BL21(DE3) codon plus, BL21(DE3): pKJE7 (pKJE7 expresses chaperones), and ER2566. The results with BL21(DE3) were variable and unreliable, and recovery of the plasmid showed a tendency for mutations to occur. No improvement was seen using the codon plus BL21 strain nor with the C41(DE3) strain. No colonies at all could be obtained after transformation into BL21(DE3):pKJE7, the chaperone-producing strain. In contrast, transformation into the strain ER2566 resulted in membranes with robust enzymatic activity. Western blots and silver-stained gels (Fig. 1) revealed the expressed protein in the membrane fraction prepared from ER2566 pET16b:Rv3806c. The 3806c protein as cloned has a predicted molecular mass of 33 kDa and runs slightly faster than the 33-kDa standard under the SDS-PAGE conditions used. Demonstrating DPPR Synthase Activity and the Putative DPPR Product—The reaction catalyzed by DPPR synthase is illustrated in Fig. 2A, and the time-dependent conversion of the 14Cinp[14C]Rpp into organic soluble material after incubation with E. coli membranes containing the Rv3806c protein is shown in Fig. 2B (only background reactivity was found in the organic phase using a control strain of E. coli transformed with empty pET 16b vector). TLC analysis (Fig. 2C) shows a major product in the organic material migrating the same way on TLC plates as authentic DPPR and a minor product co-migrating with DPR. The DPR is postulated to be due to transformation of the initial product, DPPR, to DPR by endogenous E. coli phosphatases. The identity of the DPPR was confirmed by several characterizations. Treatment of the presumed DPPR with alkaline phosphatase yielded DPR as shown in Fig. 3A. Acid hydrolysis of the presumed DPPR enzyme product with 0.2 m trifluoroacetic acid released ribose-5-phosphate (Fig. 3B). Further treatment of the released ribose-5-phosphate with alkaline phosphatase yielded free ribose (Fig. 3C). Finally, the structure of the product was confirmed by converting it back to pRpp (Fig. 4) in the presence but not the absence of PPi using the DPPR synthase in the reverse direction (see Fig. 2).Fig. 4Demonstration of the formation of pRpp from DPPR as catalyzed by the protein product of Rv3806c. Initially p[14C]Rpp was incubated with DP and the Rv3806c protein for 7 min in duplicate samples to form DPR as shown in Fig. 2. However, instead of organic extraction the membranes containing both the Rv3806c protein and the DPPR product were centrifuged at 100,000 × g. One pellet was then resuspended in buffer containing PPi and the other in buffer only. After a 15-min incubation the reactions were recentrifuged, and the supernatants from the PPi-containing incubation (A) and non-PPi-containing incubation (B) were analyzed by ion exchange chromatography for the presence of radioactive pRpp.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Characterization of DPPR Synthase, Including Detergent, Divalent Cations, pH Optimum, and Temperature—CHAPS detergent was required to observe enzymatic activity. However, as shown in Fig. 5A, concentrations >0.25% resulted in diminished enzymatic activity. Testing concentrations <0.25% was not practical because of the requirement of using 7.5% CHAPS to reliably solubilize the exogenous DP substrate. When the 10 mm Mg2+ in the buffer used to resuspend the membranes was replaced with 5 mm EDTA, no enzymatic activity was present (Fig. 5B). The activity was almost fully recovered by adding 20 mm Mg2+ to the EDTA-containing buffer; 20 mm Ca2+ and 20 mm Mn2+ resulted in only 13 and 22% of the activity found with Mg2+ (Fig. 5B). Thus, a divalent cation is required for activity. The enzyme showed a pH optimum of pH 7.5–8 (Fig. 5C). Finally, the enzyme was found to be rather temperature stable as shown in Fig. 5D. Higher temperatures than those shown resulted in protein precipitation. Substrate Specificity and Concentration Dependences—The enzyme was tested for specificity with respect to the polyprenyl phosphate as shown in Fig. 6. These data revealed a strong preference for polyprenyl phosphates near C-50, with no reactivity seen with C-20 and weak reactivity seen with C-75. The effect of DP concentration on enzyme activity is shown in Fig. 7. Obtaining reproducible data required pre-solubilization of the DP in CHAPS as described under “Materials and Methods.” From these data an apparent Km of 22.4 ± 4.6 μm was obtained by nonlinear regression using the program Grafit 5.0. No close substrate analog of pRpp was available to test the specificity for this substrate, although GDP-mannose and UDP-galactose, not surprisingly, were not utilized by the enzyme. The effect of pRpp concentration on the rate of the enzyme is illustrated in Fig. 8. From these data an apparent Km for pRpp was calculated by nonlinear regression to be 120 μm (± 16 μm) using the program Grafit 5.0. The biosynthesis of d-arabinofuranose has proven challenging to study in mycobacteria, in part because it is essential for mycobacterial viability and, thus, many genetic methods are difficult to apply. Early work was hampered by the expectation of a sugar nucleotide of arabinose, and much effort was expended in this and other laboratories to identify such. All reproducible results now suggest that no sugar nucleotide of d-arabinofuranose is present in mycobacteria. The initial clue as to the precursors of d-arabinose came from feeding hexoses labeled in specific carbons to mycobacteria (9Scherman M. Weston A. Duncan K. Whittington A. Upton R. Deng L. Comber R. Friedrich J.D. McNeil M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 7125-7130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which strongly suggested that the d-arabinose five-carbon skeleton was formed in the pentose shunt. A major step forward (10Scherman M.S. Kalbe-Bournonville L. Bush D. Xin Y. McNeil M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29652-29658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) then followed when it was recognized that membrane fractions of M. smegmatis were capable of converting pRpp to decaprenylphosphoryl-d-arabinose and, furthermore, that DPPR was an intermediate. Attempts in our laboratory to purify and sequence the responsible enzymes from membrane preparations have been unsuccessful. The necessary breakthrough came when those of us working on Azorhizobium, one of the few groups of organisms outside Actinomycetales to synthesize d-arabinofuranose, were able to identify a d-arabinose operon by gene knock-out studies3 (11Mergaert P. D'Haeze W. Fernandez-Lopez M. Geelen D. Goethals K. Prome J.C. Van Montagu M. Holsters M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These studies helped by allowing the precise pathway from pRpp to decaprenylphosphoryl-d-arabinose to be determined2 and, as shown here, to identify and express the gene encoding the first enzyme in the pathway, a new phosphoribosyl transferase that transfers ribose-5-phosphate to decaprenyl phosphate. The enzyme was found to be difficult to express but ultimately was well expressed in E. coli ER2566, although the reason for success in that particular strain is unclear. The expressed enzyme is found in the membrane fraction consistent with the SOSUI prediction of nine transmembrane domains. The enzyme was found to require Mg2+ for activity and also, as expressed, required CHAPS detergent. It has a pH optimum of 7.5–8 and apparent Km values for pRpp and DP of 120 and 22 μm, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4 and earlier (9Scherman M. Weston A. Duncan K. Whittington A. Upton R. Deng L. Comber R. Friedrich J.D. McNeil M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 7125-7130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the reactions catalyzed by DPPR synthase are reversible as one sugar phosphate bond is replaced by another; however the next biosynthetic step, the removal of the phosphate from C-5 to form DPR, is not reversible. Not surprisingly, this enzyme has been shown to be essential for mycobacterial growth in vitro (15Sassetti C.M. Boyd D.H. Rubin E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar). Thus, DPPR synthase has potential as a target for new tuberculosis drugs given the following: 1) its essentiality; 2) the fact that ethambutol is a known drug that inhibits arabinan formation; and 3) that it catalyzes a reaction not found in humans. One concern is that many important phosphoribosyl transferases are present in humans; however, the lack of a clear pRpp binding site as is found in such enzymes is encouraging. Site-directed mutagenesis studies are ongoing to identify amino acids involved in substrate binding and catalysis. We gratefully acknowledge the gift of E. coli strain C41 (DE3) from Dr. Herb Schweitzer. We also very gratefully acknowledge the suggestion from one of the members of the JBC editorial board of treating E. coli membranes containing Rv3806c protein at 45 °C instead of boiling for SDS-PAGE analysis."

Insulin is accumulated in large dense core vesicles within the pancreaticβ cell and is released by exocytosis when glucose concentrations rise(1Rutter G.A. Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 1861-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Triggering of secretionappears to involve increases in intracellular ATP concentrations (or ATP/ ADPratio), closure of ATP-sensitive K+ channels, and Ca2+influx through voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels(1Rutter G.A. Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 1861-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because secretion inresponse to nutrient secretagogues is usually biphasic, with a rapid earlyphase followed by a subsequent second or sustained phase(2Burr I.M. Balant L. Stauffacher W. Renold A.E. Grodsky G. Lancet. 1969; 2: 882-883Abstract PubMed Google Scholar), it has been proposed thatfunctionally distinct groups of vesicles may exist and represent“reserve,” “readily releasable,” and“intermediate” pools(3Bratanova-Tochkova T.K.

Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). At present, however, themechanisms through which vesicles are recruited to the readily releasablepool, proposed to correspond to a subset of the “morphologicallydocked” (4Rorsman P. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) vesicles atthe cell surface, are still incompletely understood(1Rutter G.A. Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 1861-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachmentprotein receptors(SNAREs) 1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, solubleN-ethylmaleimidesensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor;EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; mRFP, monomeric red fluorescentprotein; NPY, neuropeptide Y; TIRF, total internal reflectionfluorescence. are believedto be required for the trafficking of insulin and other secretory hormonesfrom the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, Golgi and trans-Golginetwork to the plasma membrane, and finally exocytosis of mature vesicles(5Rothman J.E.

Dense core vesicletrafficking to the plasma membrane can itself be divided into three stages:transport of insulin vesicles to the plasma membrane, their first interactionwith the plasma membrane (docking or tethering), and then subsequent fusion atthe plasma membrane (exocytosis). Although SNARE proteins are believed toregulate the final fusion step in β cells(7Gut A. Kiraly C.E. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Wollheim C.B. Lang J. J.

Six of the secgene products, Sec3p, Sec5p, Sec6p, Sec8p, Sec10p, and Sec15p, have beendescribed in the vesicle transport complex, and mammalian homologues have beenidentified(12Hsu S.C. Hazuka C.D.

Neuroscience. 2003; 119: 73-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Suchfindings suggest that the exocyst complex may serve as part of vesicle-dockingmachinery at sites of regulated as well as constitutive exocytosis(12Hsu S.C. Hazuka C.D. Foletti D.L. Scheller R.H.

At present, however,functional data supporting or refuting such a role in mammalian cells isunavailable. In this study, we examined the role of the exocyst complex in regulatedinsulin secretion. We show that SEC6 is concentrated on insulin-containingdense core vesicles, whereas SEC5 and SEC8 are concentrated in the cytoplasmand on the plasma membrane, respectively. Although dominant-negativesuppression of SEC8 and SEC10 function decreased the density of vesicles atthe plasma membrane, overexpression of truncated SEC8 or SEC10 did not affectthe kinetics of single exocytotic events. These data are compatible with amodel in which the exocyst complex (a) forms as dense core vesiclesapproach the cell surface, (b) is then involved in the docking ofvesicles at the plasma membrane by presently undefined mechanisms, but(c) is not involved in the final fusion step.

Generation of Truncated sec6 and sec8 Adenoviruses—cDNAsencoding C-terminal truncation mutants of rat sec6 (residues1–333, Ad-sec6CT) or rat sec8 (residues1–426, Ad-sec8CT) were amplified by PCR, subclonedinto pCR2 (Invitrogen), and sequenced on both strands.

Imaging was performed inmodified Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRB: 125 mm NaCl, 3.5 mmKCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mmNaH2PO4, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 3mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mmNaHCO3, pH 7.4, equilibrated with O2/CO2(19:1)). Stimulation with KCl was achieved by perfusion of 50 mmKCl containing KRB (NaCl was reduced to maintain osmolarity). To monitor exocytosis of NPY-mRFP constructs at the single vesicle level,we used a TIRF microscope similar to that described previously(22Tsuboi T. da Silva Xavier G. Leclerc I. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52042-52051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar,28Pinton P. Tsuboi T. Ainscow E.K. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Rutter G.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 47115-47124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) with minor modifications.We used an objective lens with a numerical aperture of 1.45 (PlanAPO×100/1.45 TIRFM, Olympus) to monitor single vesicle exocytosis. Toobserve the pIRES2-EGFP and NPY-mRFP fluorescence images, a 488-nm laser(argon ion laser, 30 milliwatts, Spectra-Physics) was used for total internalreflection illumination with a long pass filter (515 nm for EGFP, 600 nm formRFP). Images were collected with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (640× 480 pixels, IMAGO, Till Photonics; operated with TillvisION software,Till Photonics). Images were acquired every 300 ms with 50 ms of exposure. Toanalyze the data, fusion events were manually selected, and the averagefluorescence intensity of individual vesicles in a 1 × 1-μm squareplaced over the vesicle center was calculated. The critical angle of our 1.45 numerical aperture objective lens is63.56°, and the widest possible angle is 71.39° (when measured at therim of the lens). We introduced the laser beam in the middle of these angles.We calculated the decay length of evanescent field (d) theoreticallyusing the formula,d=λ4πη22sin2θ−η12(Eq. 1) where θ is the angle of incidence, λ the wavelength of light,n1 and n2 the refractive indices ofwater (1.33) and glass (1.53). For θ = 67.5° and λ = 488 nm,decay constant (d) becomes 81.1 nm, and effectively, a layer of100–200 nm is the reach of the evanescent light. Confocal Imaging—To assess the density of the vesicles inexocyst complex mutant-expressing cells, we employed a confocal microscope(Leica TCS-AOBS laser-scanning confocal microscope). Before monitoring vesicledensity, the bottom of the cell was located by inspection in confocal mode.The focal plane was then moved up by 1 μm using a piezo motor, which drovethe objective lens as controlled by the system software. Generation and Purification of Polyclonal Anti-SEC5Antibody— Antibodies were raised in sheep against residues1–100 of the human SEC5 (GenBank™ accession number: NP_060773)sequence, encompassing the Ral-binding domain. The mouse SEC5 protein isidentical in this region apart from residue 83, where arginine is replaced bylysine in the murine sequence. The relevant part of the coding region ofSEC5 was inserted as a BamHI/EcoRI fragment into the vector pET28a.The resultant fusion protein, bearing an N-terminal hexahistidine tag, wasexpressed in E. coli and purified by chromatography onnickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. Antibodies were purified from theanti-serum by chromatography on a column of the fusion protein, immobilized onCNBr-activated Sepharose CL-4B. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were fixed with paraformaldehydeand permeabilized with Triton X-100 as described in detail elsewhere(22Tsuboi T. da Silva Xavier G. Leclerc I. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52042-52051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Monoclonal SEC6(Calbiochem, 9H5, diluted 1:200), SEC8 (Calbiochem, 2E9, 1:200), oranti-α-tubulin (Sigma, Poole Dorset, UK; 1:1000) polyclonal antibodiesto SEC5 (1:100) or insulin (Dako, 1:500) were diluted in blocking buffer andapplied to cells for 2 h at 4 °C. After five washes in blocking buffer,Alexa 488 and Alexa 568 (Molecular Probes, diluted 1:500) were applied for 1 hat 4 °C. Samples were then observed under a Leica TCS-AOBS laser-scanningconfocal microscope using a krypton/argon laser with 488-nm (Alexa 488) and568-nm (Alexa 568) laser lines. Insulin Secretion Assay—MIN6 cells (5 × 105cells/well) were seeded in 6-well microtiter plates and infected with null(control), truncated sec6, and truncated sec8 adenoviruses.Culture was continued for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumcontaining 25 mm glucose and then at 3 mm glucose foranother 16 h. Cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline andincubated in KRB medium and 3 mm glucose, 30 mm glucose,or 50 mm KCl. Incubations were performed for 30 min at 37 °C ina water bath. Total insulin was extracted in acidified ethanol(30Ainscow E.K. Zhao C. Rutter G.A. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1149-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Total and secretedinsulin were measured using radioimmunoassay by competition with125I-labeled rat insulin (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO)according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data Analysis—Data are given as means ± S.E.Comparisons between means were performed using one-way analysis of variancewith GraphPad Prism™ (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) software. The Exocyst Complex Is Associated with Insulin-containingVesicles—The exocyst complex has been shown to be present in highconcentrations in developing brain and is believed to play a role insynaptogenesis (12Hsu S.C. Hazuka C.D. Foletti D.L. Scheller R.H. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 150-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar,31Hazuka C.D. Foletti D.L. Hsu S.C. Kee Y. Hopf F.W. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1324-1334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the cellularlocalization of the complex in pancreatic β cells, formaldehyde-fixedpancreatic MIN6 β cells were probed with antibodies against the threeexocyst complex subunits (SEC5, SEC6, and SEC8). Confocal images revealed that SEC5, SEC6, and SEC8 immunoreactivitydisplayed a markedly different subcellular localization(Fig. 1). SEC5immunofluorescence was observed largely as diffuse, cytosolic fluorescence,although some punctate staining, partially colocalized with insulin, wasapparent (Fig. 1,A–C). In contrast, SEC6 was found as punctatelabeling, closely colocalized with insulin-positive vesicles(Fig. 1, D–F).SEC8 was mainly found on the plasma membrane of the cells(Fig. 1, G–I).These observations are similar to those made previously in PC12 cells(18Vik-Mo E.O. Oltedal L. Hoivik E.A. Kleivdal H. Eidet J. Davanger S. Neuroscience. 2003; 119: 73-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and suggest that theexocyst complex might regulate vesicle docking or fusion in pancreatic MIN6β cells. Truncated Exocyst Component Decreases the Number of Docked Vesicles onthe Plasma Membrane—To determine the significance of exocystcomplex function in insulin vesicle recruitment or docking, MIN6 cells werecotransfected with NPY-mRFP and either pIRES2-EGFP-sec8-ΔN orpIRES2-EGFP-sec10-ΔC. The pIRES2-EGFP plasmid is a bicistronicvector that allows the expression of both EGFP and an exocyst subunit mutantas two separate proteins. NPY-mRFP was used here as a surrogate for insulin(22Tsuboi T. da Silva Xavier G. Leclerc I. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52042-52051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar,29Tsuboi T. McMahon H.T. Rutter G.A. J. Biol.

Tsuboi and G. A. Rutter, unpublished results.(28Pinton P. Tsuboi T. Ainscow E.K. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37702-37710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cotransfected MIN6 cellswere identified as those containing diffuse cytosolic EGFP fluorescence andpunctate NPY-mRFP fluorescence. We then counted the number of intracellularand plasma membrane-docked NPY-mRFP vesicles by TIRF and confocal microscopy,respectively (Fig. 2,A–F). All of the cells examined that overexpressedtruncated exocyst components showed a significant 40–50% decrease in thenumber of docked vesicles at the plasma membrane (control, 1.36 ± 2.2vesicles/μm2, n = 12; sec8-ΔN, 0.86± 2.8 vesicles/μm2, n = 7;sec10-ΔC, 0.65 ± 1.1 vesicles/μm2,n = 12) (Fig.2G, open squares). In contrast, cellsoverexpressing sec8-ΔN or sec10-ΔC showed anon-significant ∼10% decrease in the number of intracellular vesicles(Fig. 2G, filledsquares). We also performed adenoviral infection of Ad-sec6CT orAd-sec8CT to observe the effect on the number ofintracellular and plasma membrane-docked NPY-mRFP vesicles. Cells adenovirallyinfected with truncated exocyst components also displayed a significant 30%decrease in the number of docked vesicles at the plasma membrane (control,1.43 ± 1.2 vesicles/μm2, n = 6;Ad-sec6CT, 0.91 ± 1.8 vesicles/μm2,n = 6; Ad-sec8CT, 0.88 ± 1.7vesicles/μm2, n = 6). However, there was no significantdecrease in the number of intracellular vesicles in eitherAd-sec6CT- or Ad-sec8CT-infected MIN6cells (control, 1.54 ± 2.2 vesicles/μm2, n = 6;Ad-sec6CT, 1.47 ± 2.1 vesicles/μm2,n = 6; Ad-sec8CT, 1.51 ± 2.1vesicles/μm2, n = 6). To further validate the above observations, we measured the total cellularinsulin content. Adenoviral infection with Adsec6CT orAd-sec8CT decreased insulin levels by only 10% (control,821.4 ± 22.2 ng/105 cells; Ad-sec6CT,725.4 ± 31.3 ng/105cells; Ad-sec8CT,740.1 ± 21.8 ng/105cells). These observations are consistentwith above confocal imaging measurements. We next measured the impact of overexpression of the exocyst complex onglucose- or high K+ (depolarization)-induced insulin secretion.Insulin secretion was stimulated ∼2.5-fold by 30 mm(versus 3 mm) glucose and 4-fold by high (50mm) K+ in control cells(Fig. 2H). InAd-sec6CT- or Ad-sec8CT-infected MIN6cells, glucose- or high K+-induced insulin secretion was decreasedby ∼40% (Fig. 2H).Taken together, these data suggest that the exocyst complex inhibits thedocking step of insulin vesicle delivery to the plasma membrane, thus reducingthe number of vesicles available for immediate release. Effect of Overexpression of Exocyst Complex on VesicleFusion—To determine whether the apparent inhibition of dockingobserved above might be due to the exocyst complex decreasing the rate atwhich individual vesicles fused, thus causing a potential“bottleneck” that prevented subsequent fusion events, the dynamicsof single vesicle exocytosis were analyzed in single NPY-mRFP-expressingvesicles. Although as expected, exocytotic events were detected lessfrequently in sec8-ΔN- and sec10-ΔC-expressingcells than in cells transfected with empty vector control(Fig. 2E), thekinetics of individual fusion events were identical in each case(Fig. 3D). Thus,stimulation with 30 mm glucose caused NPY-mRFP-expressing vesiclesto brighten and spread suddenly during the release of the fluorescent peptide(22Tsuboi T. da Silva Xavier G. Leclerc I. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52042-52051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar,29Tsuboi T. McMahon H.T. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47115-47124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar,32Tsuboi T. Rutter G.A. Curr.Biol. 2003; 13: 563-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) with an identical timecourse in control (Fig.3A), sec8-ΔN-overexpressing cells(Fig. 3B), orsec10-ΔC-overexpressing cells(Fig. 3C). Nodifference was observed in the mean values for the rise time, half-widths, ordecay time of fluorescence intensity between control andsec8-ΔN- or sec10-ΔC-overexpressing cells (datanot shown). These data thus indicate that the exocyst complex does not alterthe kinetics of individual insulin exocytosis events but rather regulates thedocking step of insulin vesicles to the plasma membrane. Effect of Overexpression of Exocyst Complex on Total Number of theVesicles on the Plasma Membrane—We next measured the dynamicchanges in the number of insulin vesicles docked at the plasma membrane duringstimulation with glucose. During glucose stimulation of control cells(Fig. 4, A andD, open circles), the total number of dockedvesicles slightly increased by up to 110% of the initial value, consistentwith previous observations(33Ohara-Imaizumi M. Nakamichi Y. Tanaka T. Ishida H. Nagamatsu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3805-3808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This apparentrecruitment of new vesicles to docking sites might thus contribute to therefilling of the docked vesicle pool (possibly equivalent to a readilyreleasable pool) during the second phase of glucose-induced insulin secretion.In contrast, in either sec8-ΔN- orsec10-ΔC-overexpressing cells, the total number of dockedvesicles during glucose stimulation remained low, with no appreciableappearance of newly recruited vesicles to the plasma membrane(Fig. 4, B andC). As a result, in cells expressingsec8-ΔN or sec10-ΔC, the total number of dockedvesicles decreased by 10–40% of the initial number after 10 min ofstimulation with high glucose concentrations(Fig. 4D, closedsquares and triangles). Truncated Exocyst Component Does Not Affect MicrotubuleDynamics—To determine whether the effects of the dominant-negativesec constructs on vesicle distribution may be due to alterations inmicrotubule dynamics, the latter were assessed by monitoring the distributionof α-tubulin in null- or sec mutant-expressing cells. Nodifferences were apparent in α-tubulin distribution in cells expressingany of the interfering sec constructs as assessed by confocalmicroscopy (Fig. 5). Thus,microtubule rearrangements would seem unlikely to explain the decreasedvesicle recruitment to the cell surface. We show here that the exocyst complex is present in significantconcentrations in pancreatic MIN6 β cells. Unexpectedly, we observed verydifferent patterns of immunofluorescence staining for intracellular SEC5,SEC6, and SEC8. Thus, SEC5 immunofluorescence was predominantly seen diffuselythroughout the cytoplasm in MIN6 cells. In contrast, SEC6 and SEC8immunofluorescence were predominantly localized to insulin vesicles and theplasma membrane, respectively (Fig.1). Thus, it would appear that the exocyst complex does not existchiefly as a preformed unit but that instead, formation of the holo-complexmay accompany translocation of vesicles to docking (pre-exocytosis) sites atthe plasma membrane. Several studies in epithelial cells have shown that aportion of the exocyst complex exists in a partially assembled state with someof the protein being found dissociated from SEC6(34Grindstaff K.K.

Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 251-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) showed that thelocalization of SEC8 to the plasma membrane at sites of polarized exocytosisis dependent on the accumulation of all other protein subunits of the complexin yeast. It therefore seems possible that SEC8 may be recruited to sites onthe plasma membrane, probably in conjunction with a subset of other exocystcomponents prior to assembly of the whole exocyst complex. This may occurduring docking of insulin-containing vesicles bearing SEC6 and possibly otherexocyst subunits. Recently, several studies have shown that the exocystcomplex interacts with active Ral GTPase(39Brymora A. Valova V.A. Larsen M.R. Roufogalis B.D. Robinson P.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 19875-19881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)showed that point mutations in both RalA and the sec5 subunit, whichabolish RalA-SEC5 interaction, also abolish the inhibition of GTP-dependentexocytosis in PC12 cells. In contrast, the cleavage of a SNARE protein byBotulinum neurotoxin blocks both GTP- and Ca2+-dependentexocytosis. Therefore, the above authors(42Wang L. Li G. Sugita S. J.Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19875-19881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) concluded that RalA andthe exocyst complex are essential for GTP-dependent exocytosis, whereas thefinal fusion steps are SNARE-dependent. These data are fully compatible withthe present findings. We also analyzed here the docking and fusion of insulin vesicles inpancreatic MIN6 cells overexpressing truncated exocyst components. Our resultsshowed that: 1) inhibition of the exocyst complex inhibited insulin secretionin response to cell depolarization or to glucose; 2) the kinetics of insulinsecretion were identical in either control or truncated exocystcomponent-overexpressing cells; 3) the supply of vesicles and/or the abilityto retain them on plasma membrane were impaired, resulting in a decrease inthe number of docked insulin vesicles (to ∼50% of that in normal MIN6cells; Fig. 2D). In conclusion, we present direct evidence that the exocyst complexcontributes to the docking step of insulin vesicles on the plasma membrane inpancreatic β cells and may be involved in the recruitment of vesiclesfrom a reserve to a readily releasable pool at the plasma membrane. Changes inthe efficiency of the docking process may therefore play a role in the normalcontrol of insulin release under conditions where secretion is stronglystimulated, such as during chronic hyperglycemia or during treatment withsulfonylureas. Because such alterations might conceivably contribute toinsulin secretory deficiency in some form of type 2 diabetes, exocyst complexcomponents may provide potential therapeutic targets in this disease.

Traffic. 2001; 2: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).Organization of the plasma membrane into discrete compartments determined bylipid content provides additional regulation for protein-protein andprotein-lipid interactions. The primary classes of lipids that reside in theplasma membrane are glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and membrane-activesterols (5Edidin M. Annu. Rev. Biophys.Biomol. Struct. 2003; 32: 257-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar).Glycerophospholipids contain two acyl chains, one of which is oftenunsaturated. In contrast, sphingolipids contain two acyl chains, which areboth larger and saturated. Membrane-active sterols, mainly represented bycholesterol in mammals, are defined by a flat fused-ring system. Cholesterolhas a greater affinity for the saturated acyl chains of sphingolipids and itsincorporation into membranes provides rigidity via its fourring structure. Thehigher concentration of cholesterol within sphingolipids also leads to strongvan der Waals interactions between lipid acyl chains, which decreases membranepermeability and stabilizes the lipid packing. These properties result in adistinct membrane compartment characterized by a higher ordering of the lipidmembrane, as opposed to disordered, unsaturated, acyl-containing membranedomains (6Ohvo-Rekila H.

B lymphocyte responses to similar stimuli differ dramatically at discretestages of maturation and in different microenvironments. Notably, bone marrowand peripheral immature B cells are not activated by signals generated throughthe BCR but rather undergo apoptosis (deletion) or receptor modification(editing) (12Sandel P.C.

Wespeculated that this phenomenon might be related to differential membranecomposition. Because of the unique function of cholesterol to facilitatemembrane microdomain formation within the plasma membrane, we have comparedcholesterol levels between transitional immature and mature B cells and havedetermined the association of membrane cholesterol levels to BCR proximalsignaling and lipid raft compartmentalization. Isolation and Definition of Mature and Transitional Immature B CellSubsets—Transitional immature B cells were isolated from spleens of6- to 10-week-old sublethally irradiated, auto-reconstituting BALB/c mice 14days post sub-lethal irradiation at 500 rads, as described previously(18Allman D.M. Ferguson S.E. Cancro M.P. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2533-2540PubMed Google Scholar). The same protocol wasapplied to non-irradiated mice to isolate a population enriched in mature Bcells. For these studies, the isolated populations ranged between 94 and 98% Bcells, as assessed by B220 expression. Non-sorted mature populations generallycontain 10–15% transitional immature B cells(19Allman D.M. Ferguson S.E. Lentz V.M. Cancro M.P. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4431-4444PubMed Google Scholar). The non-sortedtransitional immature populations used in these studies were devoid ofdetectable mature B cells, as assessed by the absence of sIgMpos,B220pos, and AA4.1lo cells. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting and Filipin Staining—Todetermine the amount of membrane-associated cholesterol in each cell type, 1× 106 cells were fixed in 120 μl of 4% paraformaldehyde atroom temperature for 12 min, washed three times with PBS, and incubated withfilipin (1:100 of 25 mg/ml stock, Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. Samples of cellswere also simultaneously analyzed for expression of B220, CD23 (both BDPharmingen), AA4.1, and level of filipin binding and fluorescence. The cellswere subject to flow cytometric analysis, and the filipin binding levels ofmature (B220pos, AA4.1lo, and CD23pos), T1(B220pos, AA4.1hi, and CD23neg), and T2(B220pos, AA4.1hi, and CD23pos) weredetermined. Gas Chromatography—Mature and transitional immature B cellswere purified as described above. To each of the samples of purified B cells,a known amount of cholesteryl methyl ether was added as an internal standardfor the gas-liquid chromatographic assay, and then each group was subject to aBligh-Dyer lipid extraction(20Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can.J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). 4 × 107B cells of each type were suspended in 0.8 ml of PBS to which 3 ml ofCHCl3/MeOH (1:2) was added, and the samples were vigorouslyvortexed. Then, 1 ml of CHCl3 alone was added, and the samples werevortexed, followed by the addition of 1 ml of H2O and vortexing.The samples were then spun at 3000 rpm to separate the phases, and the lowerCHCl3 phase was retained, split into aliquots, and dried undernitrogen. The amount of free and total cholesterol in each sample was thendetermined by gas chromatography as previously described(21Klansek J.J. Yancey P. St Clair R.W. Fischer R.T. Johnson W.J. Glick J.M. J. LipidRes. 1995; 36: 2261-2266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of Cholesterol to Cells—Transitional immature Bcells (1 × 107 cells/ml) were incubated in RPMI containingeither cholesterol alone (300 μg/ml) or cholesterol (150 or 300 μg/ml)plus 5 mm MβCD. These samples were incubated at 37 °C for30–120 min as indicated in individual experiments. The cells were thenincubated with filipin as previously described to determine their relativemembrane cholesterol content. Immunofluorescence and Microscopy—Purified B cells (2× 106 in 200 μL of PBS) were placed in the wells of a 96well plate and incubated at 37 °C. Cells were stimulated with a goatF(ab′)2 anti-BCR antibody (IgG- and liquidchromatography-directed, Jackson Laboratories) for 5 min, and the reaction wasstopped by addition of cold PBS/0.1% bovine serum albumin/0.02% azide. Cellswere fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/0.1% glutaraldehyde, followed by washing andresuspension in 0.5 mg/ml sodium borohydride to stop fixation. Cells were thenincubated in staining buffer containing both a Cy3-conjugated secondaryantibody directed to the anti-BCR primary antibody and filipin at 4 °C.The cells were adhered to glass slides by centrifugation at 800 rpm using aCytospin centrifuge (Shandon) and then mounted with Prolong (Molecular Probes)anti-fade agent. BCR-expressing, filipin-binding cells were visualized using aZeiss Axiovert 200M inverted epifluorescence microscope equipped with aSensicam QE high performance camera. Images were captured and analyzed usingSlidebook image analysis software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations). The NoNeighbors deconvolution module of the software was used to remove out-of-focuslight. Cells were scored according to the following criteria: 1) Cells were onlycounted if they were not in contact with other cells. 2) The BCR was scored asaggregated when the BCR polarized on less than half the circumference of thecell. 3) Co-polarization of the BCR aggregates and cholesterol were scoredwhen peak cholesterol intensity overlapped with a BCR aggregate. 4) At least35 cells were scored for each condition per experiment. For representativecells in Figs. 1 and3, relative filipindistribution was determined by calculating the sum pixel intensities at thepoles of each cell. For cells that have been stimulated with anti-BCR, thehalves were determined using the BCR cap as a reference point. Forunstimulated cells that lacked this point of reference, the cell was dividedarbitrarily.Fig. 3Methyl-β-cyclodextrin-mediated addition of cholesterol to themembranes of transitional immature B cells. A, for this study, Bcells were prepared from the spleens of BALB/c mice 14 days after irradiation(transitional immature, green) or of non-irradiated BALB/c mice(mature, blue). Transitional immature B cells (T1 and T2 combined)were then incubated for different amounts of time in RPMI containing 5mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) and varying amount ofcholesterol (Rx, red). Cells were then fixed with paraformaldehydeand allowed to bind to filipin. The left panel depicts the results offilipin binding data for mature B cells and untreated transitional B cells.The second panel depicts transitional B cells incubated withcholesterol alone, and the last three panels depict transitional Bcells incubated with MβCD and varying amounts of cholesterol fordifferent amounts of time. The dotted lines indicate the relativefilipin binding of untreated transitional immature and mature B cells.B, silver stain analysis of Triton X-100 detergent-insoluble anddetergent-soluble domains of mature B cells (mat., 23% total proteinin DI fraction), transitional immature B cells (trans., 6% totalprotein in DI fraction), and transitional immature B cells incubated at 37°C for 90 min in RPMI containing 5 mm MβCD and 300μg/ml cholesterol (trans.+chol, 26% total protein in DIfraction). Samples were run on an 8–16% gradient gel, and the size rangeis from 250 kDa at the top to 10 kDa at the bottom of thegel. C, representative transitional immature B cells are shown(red, BCR; green, cholesterol). Both the BCR and cholesterolwere evenly distributed on unstimulated MβCD/cholesterol-treatedtransitional immature B cells (top panel). After 5 min of anti-BCRstimulation, the BCR formed an aggregate on one pole of the cell (bottompanel). Cholesterol was enriched within this BCR aggregate. Relativefilipin distribution was determined as described inFig. 1. Filipin binding thatappeared internal in the cells was not included in the quantitationcalculations. Cells are representative of three experiments whereco-polarization was tabulated from at least 35 cells per sample for eachexperiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Detergent-soluble and Detergent-insoluble Domain Isolation for SilverStaining—Cells (20–30 × 106 cells) werepelleted and then lysed in 200 μl of 1% Triton X-100/25 mmMES/150 mm NaCl/1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/1mm vanadate/protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) onice for 15 min. Lysates were homogenized in a 1-ml Dounce homogenizer for 10strokes. Lysates were then centrifuged at 500 × g for 7 min at4 °C. The post nuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 60 min at 4 °C. The resultant supernatant was removed andlabeled the detergent-soluble fraction (DS). The 100,000 × gpellet was resuspended in 200 μl of 50 mmβ-octylglucopyranoside (Sigma)/20 mm Tris/500 mmNaCl/protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), kept on ice for 15min, and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 12 min at 4 °C.The resultant supernatant was removed and labeled as the Triton X-100detergent-insoluble fraction (DI). Equivalent amounts for each cell fractionwere subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were detected with Bio-Rad SilverStain Plus (Bio-Rad) per the manufacturer's instructions. Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation and ImmunoblotAnalysis—CH27, untreated WEHI-231, andMβCD/cholesterol-treated WEHI-231 (5–10 × 107cells/ml in PBS) cells were incubated at 37 °C. Cells were eitherunstimulated or stimulated with anti-BCR for 2 min at 37 °C. Cells werepelleted and lysed in 1% Triton X-100/25 mm MES/150 mmNaCl/1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/1 mmvanadate/protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) on ice for 15 min.Equal amounts of protein in 1 ml of lysis buffer were combined with 1 ml of80% sucrose in MES-buffered saline and overlaid with 2 ml of 30% sucrose inMES-buffered saline, followed by 1 ml of 5% sucrose in MES-buffered saline.Sucrose gradients were subject to ultracentrifugation (Beckman) at 43,000 rpmfor 18 h at 4 °C. Gradients were divided into 12 fractions, and thefractions were separated by 9% SDS-PAGE. After transfer onto nitrocellulose,immunoblots were probed with anti-IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch) andanti-transferrin receptor (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and detected by ECL. Northern Blot Analysis—RNA was extracted using TRIzol(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA wassubjected to Northern blot analysis on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel. The RNAwas transferred to Hybond-N (Amersham Biosciences) by capillary action.Northern blots were probed with actin and c-myc inserts radioactivelylabeled to high specific activity with a Prime-It II kit and hybridized inQuikHyb, both according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). BCR Aggregates Co-polarize with Cholesterol in Mature BCells—We have previously shown that anti-BCR-induced BCR aggregatesin mature B cells (B220pos, CD23pos, andAA4.1lo) co-polarize with the lipid raft marker GM1 to asignificantly greater extent than do those in transitional immature B cells(B220pos and AA4.1hi)(14Chung J.B. Baumeister M.A. Monroe J.G. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 736-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Because cholesterol is akey component in lipid rafts, we wanted to determine if anti-BCR-induced BCRaggregates localized to areas relatively enriched in unesterified cholesterolin transitional immature and mature B cells. We used filipin as a marker forunesterified (free) cholesterol(22Hassall D.G. Graham A. Cytometry. 1995; 21: 352-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 23Katzenstein I.P. Spielvogel A.M.

Cytometry. 1984; 5: 42-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).In both unstimulated mature and transitional immature B cells, cholesterol andthe BCR were evenly distributed around the cells. Anti-BCR-induced BCRaggregates in mature B cells co-polarized with cholesterol in 48 ± 4%of observed cells (Fig.1A, top panel, andTable I). Anti-BCR-induced BCRaggregates in transitional immature B cells copolarized with cholesterol in 16± 3% of observed cells (Fig.1B, bottom panel, andTable I). Therefore, inagreement with the observed co-polarization of BCR aggregates with GM1, BCRaggregates co-polarized with cholesterol to a greater extent in mature B cellscompared with transitional immature B cells.Table IFrequency of B cells exhibiting BCR/lipid raft co-localizationMatureTrans immatureTrans immature pluscholaCells were incubated with 300 μg/ml cholesterol in media containing 5mm MβCD at 37 °C for 90 min.Unstim.anti-BCRUnstim.anti-BCRUnstim.anti-BCRNo capping1003 ± 31006 ± 21009 ± 5Capped097 ± 3094 ± 2091 ± 5Co-capped048 ± 4016 ± 3047 ± 3a Cells were incubated with 300 μg/ml cholesterol in media containing 5mm MβCD at 37 °C for 90 min. Open table in a new tab Cholesterol Content of Transitional Immature B Cell Subsets IsEquivalent and Different from Mature Splenic B Cells—We next wantedto determine if the relative inability of BCR aggregates to co-polarize withcholesterol in transitional immature B cells was due to lower levels ofcholesterol in their plasma membrane. In the studies to follow, thefluorescence emission of filipin bound to cholesterol was utilized to detectfree cholesterol in fixed cells while allowing for the simultaneousmeasurement of other markers by flow cytometry, thereby permittingsubpopulation analysis in heterogeneous populations. Cholesterol levels were first determined by filipin binding to transitionalimmature and mature B cells (Fig.2A). We observed that the mature population binds∼2–3 times the amount of filipin as the transitional immaturepopulation. Notably, filipin binding to mature B cells was bimodal. Subsequentgating and phenotypic analysis of the lower intensity peak indicated that thispeak represents the transitional immature B cells that are found normally inthe adult mouse spleen (10–15% of B220pos cells)(Fig. 2, B andC). Populations designated mature in all subsequentstudies will contain this small, defined population of transitional immature Bcells. Furthermore, transitional immature B cells can be divided intosub-populations based upon CD23 expression (T1, CD23neg, andAA4.1hi; and T2, CD23pos, and AA4.1hi). TheT1 and T2 sub-populations exhibit the same level of relative filipin binding(Fig. 2C). Lastly,cytometric light scatter analysis was performed on all of the populations tocompare their cell size. The forward scatter of all the populations wasindistinguishable (Fig.2D). Therefore, differences in the cholesterol contentbetween these populations are not likely attributable to differences in plasmamembrane area. Of note, the total BCR expression (IgM and IgD combined) areequivalent for mature and transitional immature and mature B cells (data notshown). Importantly, in all our studies we are stimulating through BCR usingan antibody that reacts with the light chain component common to both isoformsso that all surface BCR complexes are engaged. The result depicted in Fig.2A indicates that transitional immature B cells containless unesterified cholesterol than do mature B cells. To corroborate thisfinding more quantitatively and to address the issue that the cholesterolcontent of the plasma membrane in these cells may not be at equilibrium, wedetermined the relative levels of unesterified (free) and total cholesterol bygas-liquid chromatography from both populations(Table II). Esterifiedcholesterol does not have the ability to bind to the plasma membrane, and itis typically found in cells such as hepatocytes that store cholesterol(25Gamble W. Vaughan M. Kruth H.S. Avigan J. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 1068-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lymphocytes do notcontain appreciable amounts of esterified cholesterol(26Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J.

Cytometry. 1984; 5: 42-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we observed a closeagreement in the cholesterol levels determined by biochemical analysis andfilipin binding. Regardless of whether the results were normalized to cellnumber or protein level, the mature B cells contained 2–3 times theamount of cholesterol relative to that found in transitional immature B cells.In addition, this analysis confirmed that total and free cholesterol poolswere identical, indicating that all the cholesterol in these cells isunesterified. Therefore, the cholesterol levels quantitated by filipin bindinglevels represent plasma membrane or plasma membrane precursor pools andstrongly support the interpretation that the cholesterol content of thetransitional immature B cell plasma membranes is reproducibly lower than inmature B cells.Table IIDifferences in unesterified membrane cholesterol content distinguishmature and transitional immature B cellsMatureTransitional immatureFreeaUnesterified cholesterol (micrograms).Per 106 cells0.31 ± 0.020.10 ± 0.01Per mg protein13.62 ± 1.007.02 ± 0.76TotalbUnesterified plus esterified cholesterol (micrograms).Per 106 cells0.29 ± 0.030.11 ± 0.02Per mg protein13.45 ± 1.207.21 ± 1.21a Unesterified cholesterol (micrograms).b Unesterified plus esterified cholesterol (micrograms). Open table in a new tab Manipulation of the Cholesterol Content of Transitional Immature BCells Facilitates Anti-BCR Induced Co-localization of Cholesterol-enrichedCompartments with Aggregated BCR Complexes—MβCD is acarbohydrate that binds selectively and reversibly to cholesterol. Moststudies have utilized MβCD to deplete plasma membrane cholesterol.However, it can also be used to transfer cholesterol from a highcholesterol-containing medium into the relatively low cholesterol-containingplasma membrane. Fig.3A shows the effect of incubating transitional immature Bcells with varying levels of extracellular free cholesterol at 37 °C inthe presence of MβCD at various times of incubation at each condition.The results depicted in Fig.3A indicate a dose-dependent increase inmembrane-associated cholesterol, as determined by filipin binding. At 5mm MβCD with 300 μg/ml cholesterol, transitional immaturecells exhibited similar filipin binding to mature cells. This addition ofcholesterol was dependent upon the presence of MβCD, because transitionalcells treated with cholesterol alone showed no increase in filipin binding(second panel from left). To determine if the filipin bindinganalyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting was at the limit of detection,we added cholesterol to mature B cells in the presence of MβCD. Theresults showed that the cholesterol level of mature cells could be detectablyincreased (data not shown). Therefore, the identical filipin binding ofMβCD/cholesterol-treated transitional immature cells and untreated maturecells was not due to the limit of detection of filipin binding. Furthermore,we noted no detectable change in the level of BCR expression on transitionalimmature B cells after cholesterol addition (data not shown). One characteristic of cholesterol-enriched domains is that they areresistant to solubilization in 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C. We next determinedif the addition of MβCD/cholesterol to transitional immature B cellsaffected the distribution of proteins in 1% Triton X-100-soluble and-insoluble domains. Primary mature, transitional immature, and transitionalimmature B cells treated with MβCD/cholesterol were lysed in 1% TritonX-100. The cells were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 hat 4 °C, and the resultant supernatant was labeled DS. The 100,000 ×g pellet was resuspended in octylglucoside and then centrifuged at10,000 × g for 12 min at 4 °C. The resultant supernatantwas labeled Triton X-100 DI. Equivalent cell amounts were loaded ontoSDS-PAGE, and the proteins were detected with silver stain.Fig. 3B indicates thatthe protein profile in the DS fraction is similar in each sample tested.However, there is less protein detected in transitional immature DI fractionthan the mature DI fraction. MβCD/cholesterol treatment of transitionalimmature B cells resulted in a similar protein profile in the DI fraction ascompared with the mature DI fraction. We next wanted to determine if MβCD/cholesterol treatment oftransitional immature B cells resulted in greater co-polarization ofcholesterol with anti-BCR-induced BCR aggregates. Anti-BCR-induced BCRaggregates in MβCD/cholesterol-treated transitional immature B cellsco-polarized with cholesterol in 47 ± 3% of observed cells(Fig. 3C andTable I). Together, these datasuggest that MβCD/cholesterol treatment of transitional immature B cellsresults in similar content and distribution of protein in DI fractions andsimilar BCR aggregate co-polarization with cholesterol as compared with matureB cells (47 ± 3% versus 48 ± 4%). Addition of Cholesterol to the Immature WEHI-231 B Cell Line PromotesLocalization of BCR to Detergent-insoluble Membrane Fractions—It isnot possible to recover the BCR from primary B cells on sucrose gradientsafter stimulation, owing to its strong association with the cytoskeleton.However, it has previously been shown that the BCR in the mature B cell lineCH27 is present in the detergent-insoluble raft fractions afteran"

Although this increase can beattributed in part to increased transcriptional activity, posttranscriptionalmechanisms have also been implicated in the high levels of AChE mRNA inmyotubes.

RNA-electrophoreticmobility shift assays (REMSAs) performed with a full-length AChE 3′-UTRprobe and the AU-rich element revealed that the intensity of RNA-bindingprotein complexes increased as myogenic differentiation proceeded.

Given the functionalsignificance of AChE in the nervous system, it thus becomes important toidentify the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating its expression indeveloping tissues as well as in neurons and skeletal muscle cells placedunder a variety of conditions known to markedly affect AChE expression. AChE is encoded by a single gene that is alternatively spliced to producecatalytic subunits that can be assembled into different molecular forms.

J.Neurobiol. 1973; 4: 343-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar,18Fernandez H.L. Stiles J.R. Neurosci.

Neurochem. 1976; 27: 1347-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).However, AChE is also known to be regulated during myogenic differentiation,at times preceding the occurrence of nerve-muscle interactions(22Prives J.M. Paterson B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3208-3211Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 23Fuentes M.E. Taylor P.

Biol. 1987; 120: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar).Under these conditions, however, there is relatively little informationavailable concerning the nature of the molecular mechanisms that control AChEexpression. In a recent study, we have shown that an increase in the transcriptionalactivity of the AChE gene could partially account for the initialincrease in AChE transcript levels observed in differentiating muscle cellsgrown in culture (25Angus L.M. Chan R.Y. Jasmin B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17603-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In thislatter study, the contribution of E- and N-box motifs located within the firstintronic region, along with their respective transcription factors, myogeninand GA-binding protein α and -β, was shown to be involved inmediating this transcriptional induction. More recent studies performed byothers have also highlighted the contribution of specific 5′-regulatoryregions in the AChE gene during myogenesis, including Sp1, Egr-1, andcAMP response elements (26Mutero A. Camp S. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1866-1872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar,27Siow N.L. Choi R.C. Cheng A.W. Jiang J.X. Wan D.C. Zhu S.Q. Tsim K.W. J. Biol.Chem. 2002; 277: 36129-36136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In our earlier study,however, we noted a clear discrepancy between the observed increase intranscription and the overall induction in AChE transcripts, therebysuggesting that transcription alone could not fully account for the increasein AChE expression seen at later stages of differentiation(25Angus L.M. Chan R.Y. Jasmin B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17603-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In agreement with aprevious report (23Fuentes M.E. Taylor P. Neuron. 1993; 10: 679-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), ourresults indicated that posttranscriptional events also participate inregulating the abundance of AChE mRNAs in differentiating muscle cells(19Boudreau-Lariviere C. Chan R.Y. Wu J. Jasmin B.J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2250-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Despite the implicationof posttranscriptional mechanisms, the nature of the specific trans- andcis-acting elements involved in these regulatory events remains unclear. Withthis in mind, we have therefore initiated a series of experiments in anattempt to characterize the posttranscriptional mechanisms that regulate AChEtranscripts in differentiating muscle cells. Cell Culture—Mouse C2C12 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) werecultured on culture dishes (6-well and 100-mm) coated with Matrigel(Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA) in Dulbecco's modifiedEagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 292ng/ml l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin in ahumidified chamber at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Myogenicdifferentiation and fusion was induced by replacing the growth medium onconfluent myoblasts with differentiation medium containing low serum (2% horseserum). Culture medium was changed every 48 h. Plasmid Construction and Transfection Studies—The3′-untranslated region (UTR) of the mouse ∼2.4-kb AChE mRNA wasisolated and subcloned into a Renilla luciferase reporter constructdriven by the thymidine kinase promoter (phRG-TK from Promega, Madison, WI) asdescribed previously (19Boudreau-Lariviere C. Chan R.Y. Wu J. Jasmin B.J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2250-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,28Deschenes-Furry J. Belanger G. Perrone-Bizzozero N. Jasmin B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5710-5717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The shorter 3′-UTRwas chosen for these studies because the first polyadenylation site ispredominantly used in differentiating C2C12 cells(23Fuentes M.E. Taylor P. Neuron. 1993; 10: 679-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To generate the AChE3′-UTR fragment without the AU-rich element (ARE), we employed aPCR-based protocol described elsewhere and used to delete the ARE from theGAP-43 mRNA (29Beckel-Mitchener A.C. Miera A. Keller R. Perrone-Bizzozero N.I. J. Biol.Chem. 2002; 277: 27996-28002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, theAChE 3′-UTR cDNA was used as a template, and two rounds of PCRamplification were first performed with the following primers:5′-CGAGCCCCTAGCAGGGCTGGGATATAATACGACCGA-3′ and the flanking primer5′-AGGTCTCGGATCCTTTATTGGCGGCCCAGAGGGGCGAAGG-3′ (reaction 1); andthe flanking primer 5′-AGGTCTCTCTAGACCCCTTGGGGAC CCCAG-3′ andprimer 5′-TATCCCAGCCCTGCTAGGGGCTCGGGCAGGGCGGCA-3′ (reaction 2). Toremove the internal ARE region (21 nucleotides), we performed a third round ofPCR with the reaction 1 and reaction 2 PCR products using the two flankingprimers listed above to yield a product containing the AChE 3′-UTRwithout the ARE region as confirmed by sequencing. The mouse HuR coding region was amplified by PCR from mouse muscle cDNAusing primers designed from the available mouse HuR sequence that spans theentire coding region. The resultant PCR product was subcloned into the pCI-neovector (Promega) driven by the cytomegalovirus enhancer/promoter. Theresulting vector (pHuR) product was sequenced and used to stably transfectC2C12 cells that were selected for G418 resistance resulting in a mouse HuRoverexpressing C2C12 stable cell line pool. Plasmid DNA was prepared using the Mega-Prep procedure (Qiagen,Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). DNA pellets were resuspended in 10mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Transfections were performed with theLipofectamine reagent kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer'sinstructions. Briefly, C2C12 myoblasts at 80% confluency were transfected witha total of 2 μg of plasmid DNA (1.0 μg of either the reporter constructor the parental vector and 1.0 μg of the vector used for transfectionefficiency). Transfection efficiency was monitored by co-transfecting thebasic firefly luciferase construct (pGL3) or the basic LacZ reporter vector(30Chan R.Y. Boudreau-Lariviere C. Angus L.M. Mankal F.A. Jasmin B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 1999; 96: 4627-4632Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Transfected myoblastswere collected 24–48 h after transfection or were induced todifferentiate and collected 48–72 h later. To determine reporter gene activity, transfected myoblasts and myotubeswere washed with cold 1× PBS, scraped, and lysed in 1× reporterlysis buffer (Invitrogen) followed by several freeze-thaw cycles. The extractswere centrifuged (12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and theresulting supernatant was used for the luciferase assays (Renilla andfirefly) or for β-galactosidase assays using the appropriate kits andaccording to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Values obtained forthe AChE reporter luciferase and control parental (phRG-TK) constructs werestandardized to the values obtained with firefly luciferase or withβ-galactosidase, thereby controlling for transfection efficiency. HuR siRNA and Transfection Studies—The HuR normal and mutantsiRNA duplexes (target sequence, 5′-AAAAGUCUGUUCAGCAGCAUUGG-3′,and mutant sequence, 5′-AAAAGUCAAUUCAUCAGCAAUGG-3′) were obtainedfrom Dharmacon RNA Technologies. C2C12 myoblasts were transfected with siRNAduplexes designed to mouse HuR sequence using the RNAiFect transfection kit(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected myoblastswere harvested within 24–48 h, and RNA was extracted (see below) andused for reverse transcription (RT)-PCR (see below). Adenoviral Construct and Infection Studies—An adenoviralconstruct containing the human HuD sequence (AdLS5a) was generated using theHuD sequence subcloned from the previously described pcHuD vector(31Mobarak C.D. Anderson K.D. Morin M. Beckel-Mitchener A. Rogers S.L. Furneaux H. King P. Perrone-Bizzozero N.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3191-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). AdLS5a contains thehuman HuD cDNA under the regulation of the cytomegalovirus promoter and bovinegrowth hormone polyadenylation sequence. In these viruses, the HuD expressioncassette replaces the early region 1, and transcription is directed leftward,relative to the conventional human adenovirus serotype 5 map. A control virus,Ad-lacZ, contains the Escherichia coli β-galactosidase geneunder the regulation of the murine cytomegalovirus promoter and simian virus40 polyadenylation sequence, and transcription from the expression cassette isdirected rightward. The early region 1-deleted, first generation adenoviralvectors used in these studies were constructed using a combination ofconventional cloning techniques and RecA-mediated recombination(32Chartier C. Degryse E. Gantzer M. Dieterle A. Pavirani A. Mehtali M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4805-4810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,33He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3245) Google Scholar). Recombinant adenoviralhelper viruses were grown and titered on 293 cells as described previously(34Ng P. Graham F.L. MethodsMol. Med. 2002; 69: 389-414Google Scholar). 293 cells(35Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russell W.C. Nairn R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (3494) Google Scholar) were grown in monolayerin minimum essential medium supplemented with 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100mg of streptomycin/ml, 2.5 mg of fungizone/ml, and 10% fetal bovine serum(complete medium). All cell culture media and reagents were obtained fromInvitrogen. Confluent C2C12 myoblasts were infected with 9.5 × 107particles of the adenoviral construct in a volume of 100 μl of culturemedium, with a multiplicity of infection of 475. At this multiplicity ofinfection, almost all of the cells on the plate wereinfected. 2R. J. Parks, unpublished observations. The cellswere placed in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 1h before the addition of a supplementary growth medium. During this period,the cell culture plates were agitated every 15 min to ensure that the HuDadenoviral construct was in contact with all of the cells in the dish. Theculture medium was changed 24 h later, and myogenic differentiation wasinduced with a low serum culture medium. Infected myoblasts and myotubes werewashed with 1× PBS 24–72 h following infection, and RNA wasextracted and used for RT-PCR as described below. RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted frommyoblasts and differentiating myotubes using 1.0 ml of TRIzol reagent(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and as describedpreviously (25Angus L.M.

RNAfrom each sample was quantified using the Amersham Biosciences Gene Quant IIRNA/DNA spectrophotometer and adjusted to a final concentration of 50ng/μl. Reverse transcription of 4 μl of RNA (200 ng) was performed using theOmniscript reverse transcription kit (Qiagen) as recommended by themanufacturer. Briefly, the RNA was reverse transcribed in a final volume of 20μl of RT master mix, 0.5 mm concentration of each dNTP, 10 unitsof RNase inhibitor (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 1 μmrandom hexamers (Applied Biosystems), and 4 units of Omniscript reversetranscriptase. RT was carried out at 37 °C for 60 min. Negative controlsconsisted of the same RT mixture in which the RNA was replaced with RNase-freewater. All of the samples were prepared using the same RT master mix. PCR was used to amplify the cDNAs corresponding to AChE, HuR, and S12ribosomal protein (S12 hereafter) mRNAs. The primers for AChE, S12 (used as aninternal control), and HuR (5′-primer CAGAGGTCATCAAAGATGC and3′-primer ATCCCACTCATGTGATCTAC) were synthesized based on availablesequences and amplified products of 670, 368, and 394 bp, respectively(16Jasmin B.J.

All of the samples were prepared using the samePCR master mix. PCR cycling parameters consisted of an initial activation stepat 95 °C for 15 min followed by denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min;annealing at 70 °C (for AChE), 54 °C (for S12), and 57.5 °C (forHuR) for 1 min each; and extension at 70 °C (for AChE) for 2 min and 72°C (for S12 and HuR) for 1 min followed by a 10-min elongation step at 72°C. PCR amplification was stopped during the linear range of amplification(16Jasmin B.J. Lee R.K. Rotundo R.L. Neuron. 1993; 11: 467-477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar,17Michel R.N. Vu C.Q. Tetzlaff W. Jasmin B.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Typically, the cyclenumbers were 35 cycles for AChE, 24 cycles for S12, and 24 cycles for HuR. PCRproducts were visualized on ethidium bromide-stained 1.5% agarose gels andquantified using the fluorescent dye VistraGreen (Amersham Biosciences) in1.5% agarose gels. Quantification was performed using the Storm PhosphorImagerand the accompanying ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). The valuesobtained for AChE and HuR were standardized relative to the correspondinglevel of S12 in the same sample. In Vitro Stability Assay—Poly(A)+ RNA wasisolated from a total RNA extract obtained from mouse brain using OligotexmRNA mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Cytoplasmic protein fractions were prepared as described previously(39Misquitta C.M. Iyer V.R. Werstiuk E.S. Grover A.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 224: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) from C2C12 cells stablytransfected with the HuR cDNA (pHuR cells) or from cells stably transfectedwith the empty vector (pCI-neo) as control. Briefly, C2C12 cell pellets werehomogenized in MOPS buffer (10 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.2, 200mm sodium chloride, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate) with 100μm dithiothreitol, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, and 1 Complete Mini, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail tablet asper the manufacturer's recommendations (Roche Applied Science). Homogenateswere centrifuged (10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C), and theresulting supernatants were stored until further use. After optimization ofprotein and RNA concentrations, 2.5 ng/μl poly(A)+ RNA wereincubated with 0.2 μg/μl protein extracts in MOPS buffer containing 1mm ATP, 0.1 mm spermine, 2 mm dithiothreitol,and 1 unit/μl SUPERa-sin (Ambion, Austin, TX) in a final volume of 180μl and incubated at 37 °C. At intervals of 0, 15, and 30 min, aliquotsof 40 μl were removed, and the reaction stopped by adding 200 μl ofice-cold phenol/chloroform. De-proteination and precipitation of the RNA wasthen carried out in the presence of yeast tRNA (10 μg) as a carrier. AChEmRNA was detected by RT-PCR as described above. In Vitro Transcription—cDNAs encoding for the AChEfull-length 3′-UTR, the ARE region alone, and the AChE 3′-UTRminus the ARE were obtained by PCR amplification of thepGL3–3′-UTR plasmid as described previously(19Boudreau-Lariviere C. Chan R.Y. Wu J. Jasmin B.J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2250-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,28Deschenes-Furry J. Belanger G. Perrone-Bizzozero N. Jasmin B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5710-5717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This cDNA was used as thetemplate for the in vitro transcription of the 3′-UTR. Invitro transcription was performed with the T7 in vitrotranscription system (Promega) as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly 0.5μg of cDNA, 5 μCi of [α-32P]UTP, nucleotides, RNaseinhibitor, and T7 polymerase were used to synthesize radiolabeled transcripts.The template PCR was digested with DNase I for 20 min at 37 °C. Theresulting radiolabeled RNA was purified using the RNase-free G-25 RNApurification column (Roche Applied Science). The integrity of the RNA wasverified by gel electrophoresis. Biotin-labeled transcripts (AChE 3′-UTRwith or without the ARE, and with the ARE region alone) were obtained usingthe same method except that 0.5 μm bio-11-CTP (Sigma) was usedinstead of the radiolabeled UTP. Unlabeled probes were generated by the samemethod and used in competition assays. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay andSupershift—RNA-based electrophoretic mobility shift assays (REMSAs)and supershift assays were performed with total protein extracts obtained frommyoblasts and myotubes. The cells were washed with 1× PBS, scraped, andlysed in 500 μl of homogenization buffer (0.3 m sucrose, 60mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA)supplemented with protease inhibitors (mini-complete protease inhibitor, RocheApplied Science) followed by several freeze-thaw cycles. The samples werecentrifuged (15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C), and theresulting supernatants were stored at –80 °C in 20–100-μgaliquots to be used for REMSAs and other assays. The total amount of proteinpresent in the extracts was determined with the Coomassie protein assay kit(Pierce). REMSAs were performed as described previously(28Deschenes-Furry J. Belanger G. Perrone-Bizzozero N. Jasmin B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5710-5717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In brief, 20 μg ofprotein extract were incubated with 2 × 105 cpm of32P-labeled AChE 3′-UTR or the ARE region in the presence ofyeast tRNA (0.2 μg/μl) and heparin (2.5 mg/ml) for 20 min at roomtemperature. The mixture was separated by 5% native PAGE with 0.5× Trisborate-EDTA running buffer. The gels were subsequently dried and exposed tofilm at –80 °C. Competition assays were performed by incubating anexcess of cold probe with the protein for 10 min prior to the incubation withthe radiolabeled RNA. Supershift assays were performed by incubating theprotein in the binding buffer with 0.5 μg of mouse monoclonal antibodydirected against HuR (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) or a nonspecific antibodyat room temperature for 1 h prior to the addition of the radiolabeledtranscripts. Immunoprecipitation and AChE mRNAAnalysis—Immunoprecipitation of HuR from myoblasts and myotubes wasperformed as previously described with some modifications(28Deschenes-Furry J. Belanger G.

Myoblast and myotubeprotein extracts obtained as described above were precleared with 5 μg ofnormal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and 30 μl ofparamagnetic protein G Dynabeads (Dynal Biotech, Oslo, Norway) in 300 μl ofimmunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% IgepalCA-630, 1% bovine serum albumin fraction V, 2 mm EDTA, 3mm magnesium acetate, 100 μm ZnCl2, 1μg/ml yeast tRNA) for 1 h at room temperature with constant mixing. Theprecleared protein extracts were then incubated with 2 μg of a mousemonoclonal antibody directed to HuR (Molecular Probes) or normal mouse IgG(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature with constant mixing.The protein antibody solution was incubated with 30 μl of prewashedparamagnetic protein G Dynabeads for 1 h at room temperature with constantmixing. The protein G Dynabeads were washed with immunoprecipitation bufferthree times, and the protein and mRNA were extracted with 0.5 ml of TRIzolaccording to the manufacturer's instructions. The mRNA was precipitated in thepresence of 10 μg of RNase-free glycogen (GenHunter, Nashville, TN) andsubsequently used for RT-PCR. The protein pellet was solubilized in 1×PBS with 1% SDS and used for Western blotting (see below). mRNA-binding Protein Pull-down Assay—Myoblast and myotubeprotein extracts (100 μg) were incubated with 2 μg of biotin-labeledAChE 3′-UTR with and without the ARE or with the ARE region alone, in1× binding buffer as used in REMSAs (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm potassium acetate, 1mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 5% glycerol,0.2 mg/ml yeast tRNA) for 30 min at room temperature with intermittent mix"
https://openalex.org/W1985801436,"A new mouse mutant line, Clapper, identified from N-ethyl-N-nitrosurea (ENU)-mutagenized mice, develops a dominant lamellar cataract. The cataract blocks the image of retinal fundus and transmits a fuzzy fluorescein image of retinal vasculature during angiography. The cataractous lens opacity decreases as the mice age. The Clapper mutation has been identified to be a missense mutation of the γB-crystallin gene that replaces the 4th isoleucine residue with a phenylalanine (γB-I4F). Unlike wild type γB, the γB-I4F mutant protein binds to α-crystallin to form high molecular weight complexes in vivo and in vitro. Circular dichroism measurements indicate that γB-I4F protein is less stable than wild type γB at high temperature. Darkly stained aggregates, enlarged interfiber spaces, and disorganized and smaller inner mature fibers were found in the regions of the cataract in homozygous Clapper mutant lenses. Thus, the lamellar cataract is likely due to the light-scattering effects of the enlarged interfiber spaces and protein aggregates caused by γB-I4F mutant proteins interacting with α-crystallin in the lens.

Transparency and a high refractive index are essential features for the function of the lens (1Bloemendal H. De Jong W. Jaenicke R. Lubsen N.H. Slingsby C. Tardieu A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2004; 86: 407-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Age-related cataracts, clinically named for lens opacities in elderly people, are one of the major causes for vision impairment in the world. Abnormal protein modifications and/or morphological changes in the lenses are associated with this disease, but the causative mechanism is not well understood.The vertebrate lens consists of bulk elongated fibers covered with a monolayer of epithelial cells on the surface of the anterior hemisphere. A thick basement membrane called the lens capsule, mainly consisting of collagens, wraps both the lens epithelium and fibers. The center core of the lens consists of primary fibers differentiated from the posterior cells of the lens vesicle at an early embryonic stage. The rest of the lens fibers are secondary fibers differentiated from equatorial epithelial cells. The newly formed secondary fibers lay on the top of the previous generation of fibers in a concentric manner at the peripheral equatorial region of the lens. These fibers eventually eliminate their intracellular organelles to become mature fibers in the inner region of the lens (2Bassnett S. Mataic D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).Lens proteins are mainly composed of three groups of crystallins, α, β, and γ (1Bloemendal H. De Jong W. Jaenicke R. Lubsen N.H. Slingsby C. Tardieu A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2004; 86: 407-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). The α-crystallins form high molecular complexes (∼300-1000 kDa), consisting of three isoforms, αA, αAins, and αB, encoded by the CryaA and CryaB gene, respectively. They are members of the small heat shock protein family and act as protein chaperones to prevent the aggregation of misfolded proteins in the lens (3Horwitz J. Exp.

Genetic studies show that mutations in either CryaA or CryaB cause dominant or recessive cataracts in humans and mice. In CryaA, two missense mutations (αA-R49C and αA-R116C) in humans and one missense mutation (αA-V124E) in mice result in dominant nuclear cataracts (5Litt M. Kramer P. LaMorticella D.M. Murphey W.

Giblin F.J. Wawrousek E.F. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 2924-2934PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, αA-crystallin is essential for lens transparency, whereas the role of αB-crystallin is not clear. Based on in vitro biochemical assays, both αA and αB mutations cause either a decrease of chaperone activity of the protein or an increase of protein insolubility and/or instability.Both β- and γ-crystallins are lens structural proteins and belong to the members of a related β/γ-superfamily that shares a common structural character: a Greek key domain (1Bloemendal H. De Jong W. Jaenicke R. Lubsen N.H. Slingsby C. Tardieu A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2004; 86: 407-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). These crystallins are most likely evolved from a duplication of an ancestral protein folded like a Greek key. Six members of the β-crystallin family are divided into two subgroups, the more acidic (βA-) and the more basic (βB-) proteins. Each subgroup is encoded by three genes: CrybA1, CrybA2, and CrybA3, or CrybB1, CyrbB2, and CrybB3. Also, CrybA1 encodes two proteins, βA1 and βA3. Mutations of CrybA1/A3, CrybB1, and CrybB2 have been reported to cause dominant cataracts in humans and mice (14Qi Y. Jia H. Huang S. Lin H. Gu J. Su H. Zhang T. Gao Y. Qu L. Li D. Li Y. Hum.

However, it is not known whether β- and γ-crystallins play additional functions besides acting as necessary structural components for lens transparency.Many mutations of different γ-crystallins have been reported to cause various types of cataracts in humans and mice (22Mackay D.S. Andley U.P. Shiels A. Mol. Vis. 2004; 10: 155-162PubMed Google Scholar, 23Shentu X. Yao K. Xu W. Zheng S. Hu S. Gong X. Mol. Vis. 2004; 10: 233-239PubMed Google Scholar, 24Graw J. Neuhauser-Klaus A. Klopp N. Selby P.B. Loster J. Favor J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 1202-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The γ-crystallin family has seven members, γA, γB, γC, γD, γE, γF, and γS, encoded by its own gene (CrygA-F and CrygS). CryA-F genes are located in a cluster at 32 cm on mouse chromosome 1 or at the long arm region (q33-35) on human chromosome 2. CrygS is located on mouse chromosome 16 or on human chromosome 3. Missense mutations of CrygC and CrygD and an activation of pseudo-CrygE gene cause dominant cataracts in humans (25Heon E. Priston M. Schorderet D.F. Billingsley G.D. Girard P.O. Lubsen N. Munier F.L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 65: 1261-1267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). At least 22 mutations of different Cryg isoforms have been reported to cause a broad range of lens phenotypes in mice (24Graw J. Neuhauser-Klaus A. Klopp N. Selby P.B. Loster J. Favor J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 1202-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).In vitro biochemical and structural studies of different γ-crystallin mutants have verified that the mutations can cause the conformation changes of their protein structure and initiate abnormal protein-protein interactions to form water-insoluble aggregates (26Jaenicke R. Slingsby C. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 36: 435-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and these aberrant protein aggregates could cause the light scattering in the lens. However, in vivo results show that different γ-crystallin mutations cause these unique lens phenotypes via distinct mechanisms. One report showed that the crystallization of γD-R36S mutant protein is the mechanism for its unique cataract formation (27Kmoch S. Brynda J. Asfaw B. Bezouska K. Novak P. Rezacova P. Ondrova L. Filipec M. Sedlacek J. Elleder M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1779-1786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Pande A. Pande J. Asherie N. Lomakin A. Ogun O. King J. Benedek G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6116-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In a mouse γB mutation, a substitution of the C-terminal 27 amino acid residues by 6 new amino acid residues in γB-crystallin caused the formation of large inclusions in the nuclei of lens fiber cells (29Sandilands A. Hutcheson A.M. Long H.A. Prescott A.R. Vrensen G. Loster J. Klopp N. Lutz R.B. Graw J. Masaki S. Dobson C.M. MacPhee C.E. Quinlan R.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6005-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This γB mutation was hypothesized to disrupt nuclear function, which causes lens phenotypes. Therefore, we hypothesize that some of the γ-crystallin mutant proteins cause cataracts by specifically perturbing their unknown in vivo functions that are essential for lens development or transparency.Here we report a dominant lamellar cataractous mouse line that was identified from a screen for lens phenotypes of ENU-induced mouse germ line mutations. The causative gene is a new point mutation of the CrygB gene with the 4th isoleucine substituted by a phenylalanine. This mutation presents a novel model to study a unique lamellar cataract that decreases with age. We have investigated the molecular basis for how γB-I4F mutation specifically leads to its distinctive lens phenotype.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESENU-induced Mouse Mutations, Genomic Linkage Analysis, and Causative Gene Identification—The ENU-mutagenized mice were produced as reported previously (30Hoebe K. Du X. Georgel P. Janssen E. Tabeta K. Kim S.O. Goode J. Lin P. Mann N. Mudd S. Crozat K. Sovath S. Han J. Beutler B. Nature. 2003; 424: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). Mouse breeding and genomic linkage analysis of this study were performed using an identical approach described previously (31Du X. Tabeta K. Hoebe K. Liu H. Mann N. Mudd S. Crozat K. Sovath S. Gong X. Beutler B. Genetics. 2004; 166: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The dominant mutation Clapper, mouse line L10 at C57BL/6J (B6) strain background, was crossed with wild type C3H/HeN mice to produce affected G1 hybrid mice that were further crossed with wild type C3H/HeN animal again to produce secondary generation (G2) mice. The G2 mice were phenotyped and tailed for genomic DNA that was used for a genome-wide linkage analysis by using a total of 59 microsatellite markers (31Du X. Tabeta K. Hoebe K. Liu H. Mann N. Mudd S. Crozat K. Sovath S. Gong X. Beutler B. Genetics. 2004; 166: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Based on the chromosomal location, causative gene candidates were identified from the mouse genome data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information web site. DNA sequencing was performed on DNA products generated from the transcripts of causative gene candidates by reverse transcription PCR and/or from the exons of mutant genomic DNA by PCR. The primers used for DNA sequencing analysis of different γ-crystallin genes are listed in Table I. Two sets of primers were used to sequence the exons of the γB-crystallin gene of the genomic DNA samples isolated from the tails of the Clapper homozygous mutant and wild type mice at B6 background, respectively.Table IPCR primers used for sequencing and cloning murine Cryg genesDesignated genesPrimer nameSequence (5′-3′)FragmentcDNA or exonStart/stopAnnealing temperaturebp°CCrygaFCryGa-LGACCATTTGCTGTCAACAAC571cDNA−2155CrygaRCryGa-R2TGGGCTGTAACAAGCAAAAG25Crygb (exon 1,2)FCryGB-1CAGCAGTCATGACAGCTATA520Exon 1,2−8155Crygb (exon 1,2)RCryGB-4CACCCACTCTTTGCTCTAGA98Crygb (exon 3)FCryGB-2aTGAATTGCCAGAGACTATGG567Exon 3−26055Crygb (exon 3)RCryGB-3aCTAGAGGAGGAAAGTAGAGT31CrygbFCryGBO-FCGGGCATCTCTTACTCTAG616CDNA−2455CrygbRCryGb-RGCCAGAATCATAAGCTAC64CrygcFCryGc-LACGGGTCAGCCAGCCATG606CDNA−1555CrygcRCryGc-R2TGCCAACAATACAGACTAAA66CrygdFCryGd-LTCCCATCCGACCTGCCAA618CDNA−2655CrygdRCryGd-R2GCCAGGAACACACAGAAAAT67CrygeFCryGe-LCAACAGCACTATCCCATCCG613CDNA−3755CrygeRCryGe-R2TATTACTGTCCAGATGGAGA41Cryge (exon 1,2)FCrygEG1FCAGACCTCCTGCTATATAGA538Exon 1,2−8055Cryge (exon 1,2)RCrygEG1RCACAGAACCAGAGGAAGGTG115Cryge (exon 3)FCrygEF2TGGCATAGAAAAGCTAGGGA497Exon 3−18455Cryge (exon 3)RCryGe-R2TATTACTGTCCAGATGGAGA41CrygfFCryGf-leftACAGCACCATCCCATCTGAC590CDNA−3555CrygfRCryGf-RCCAAATGATGAAAGGGCAGA30Mutant CrygbFCryGbhindIII-leftAGAAGCTTGCGAGATGGGAAAGTTCACC605CDNA−1355Mutant CrygbRCryGb-rightGCCAGAATCATAAGCTACAT64Wild type CrygbFCryGbbamhI-leftATGGATCCGCGAGATGGGAAAGATCACC605CDNA−1355Wild type CrygbRCryGb-rightGCCAGAATCATAAGCTACAT64 Open table in a new tab Cloning and Expression of Recombinant Wild Type and Mutant γB-Crystallin—Two sets of the DNA primers, one for wild type cDNA (CryGbhindIII-left and CryGb-right) and one for mutant cDNA (CryGbbamhl-left and CryGb-right), were designed to clone wild type and mutant γB-crystallin genes, respectively (Table I). The 5′-end primer for wild type γB gene contained the translational initiation site ATG with a HindIII site for cloning, whereas the 5′-end primer for γB mutant contained the mutated nucleotide (T) for encoding phenylalanine and a BamHI site for cloning. A common 3′-end primer was used in both sets of reverse transcription PCR reactions. A kit (first-strand synthesis system for reverse transcription PCR, catalogue number 11904-018; Invitrogen) was used to synthesize the first-strand cDNA from total RNA isolated from the lenses of B6 mice, and then the Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase kit (catalogue number 11708-039; Invitrogen) was used to amplify the full-length of cDNA, 605-bp fragments, of wild type and mutant γB. Both cDNA fragments were subcloned into the PCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector from the Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit (catalogue number K2800-20; Invitrogen).Phenotypic Screening, Fundus Pictures, and Fluorescein Angiography—Mouse pupils were dilated by using 1% phenylephrine with 1% atropine before mice were visually examined for the clarity of the lens through a slit lamp and for the retinal fundus by using an indirect ophthalmoscope. The cataract was directly imaged from living animals by a slit lamp (Nikon-FS3) with a camera. Fresh lenses, dissected from enucleated eyeballs of wild type and mutant mice, were imaged under a Leica MZ16 dissecting scope using a digital camera.Fluorescein angiography protocol was as follows. Fundus pictures of mouse retina were taken by a Genesis small animal fundus camera (Kuwa) that was specially designed for mice (32Hawes N.L. Smith R.S. Chang B. Davisson M. Heckenlively J.R. John S.W. Mol. Vis. 1999; 5: 22PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescein angiography was taken by the same instrument with one specifically manufactured power pack linked with a camera containing a barrier filter. Mice were intraperitoneally injected with sodium fluorescein at a dose of 0.01 ml (25% pharmaceutical grade sodium fluorescein; Akorn Inc.)/5 g body weight. The retinal vasculature was filled with dye in less than a minute after sodium fluorescein administration, and the photos were taken by using Kodak elite2 200 ASA color slide films for fundus images and 800 ASA for angiography. A timer on the power pack was used for recording elapsed time, in seconds, on each photo.SDS Gel Electrophoresis, Coomassie Blue Staining, Western Blotting—Analysis of lens total protein was as follows. Fresh lenses were dissected from enucleated eyeballs and quickly weighed for their wet weight. Lenses were then homogenized based on the ratio of 40 mg lens wet weight/ml of sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.0001% bromphenol blue). Homogenates were sonicated before loading into the gels. Analysis of lens water-insoluble proteins was as follows. One fresh lens was homogenized in 0.5 ml of 0.1 m NaCl and 50 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 7.2) buffer, and then the lens homogenate was centrifugalized to collect the insoluble pellet at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. The pellet was washed with the same buffer twice and then dissolved in 50 μl of sample buffer. Equal volume of the samples was loaded into a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel for separation, and then proteins were detected by Coomassie Blue staining or Western blotting. At least three independent experiments of lenses from different mice were carried out for the quantification of these biochemical assays.Expression and Purification of Recombinant Wild Type and Mutant γB (I4F)—Wild type γB and mutant γB-I4F cDNAs were subcloned into a bacterial expression plasmid and prepared as described previously (33Horwitz J. Huang Q.L. Ding L-L. Bova M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; : 365-383Google Scholar). Recombinant wild type γB-crystallin were expressed as soluble proteins, but γB-I4F mutant proteins were exclusively in the inclusion bodies as insoluble proteins. Small amounts of soluble γB mutant proteins were obtained by solubilizing the inclusion bodies in 8 m urea followed by stepwise dialysis against buffer as described before (34Mayer M. Buchner J. Methods Mol. Med. 2004; 94: 239-254PubMed Google Scholar). The α-crystallin was prepared from bovine lenses and purified as described (35Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1732) Google Scholar).Gel Filtration Chromatography, Two-dimensional Electrophoresis (2-DE), and Circular Dichroism (CD)—An Amersham Biosciences Superose 6 HR 10/30 column connected to the AKTA FPLC system was used for gel filtration analysis of lens water-soluble homogenates and the mixtures of bovine α-crystallin and recombinant γB-crystallin. 2-DE 1The abbreviation used is: 2-DE, two-dimensional electrophoresis. was performed based on a protocol provided by Bio-Rad using PROTE-AN-IEF Cell with 11-cm IPG strips, pH 3-10 (Bio-Rad), and 8-16% linear gradient precise gels were used for the second dimensional analysis. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. CD studies were performed by using a JASCO model J-810 Spectropolarimeter with the Peltier temperature control system (JASCO-PTC-348WI).Morphological and Immunohistochemical Analysis—Standard histology was as follows. Enucleated eyeballs were fixed in Canoy's fixative solution, a mixture of ethanol and acetic acid (3:1), for overnight before processing using a standard histological method for paraffin-embedded samples. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Thin sectional analysis under light and electron microscopy was as follows. Anterior chambers of enucleated eyeballs of 3-week-old mice were opened immediately after enucleation and then immersed in a fixative solution containing 2% glutaraldehyde and 2.5% formaldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) at 30 °C for 2 days and thereafter at room temperature for an additional 3 days. This fixative procedure was modified from a method described previously to prevent protein aggregation caused by “cold” cataract (36Lo W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9926-9930Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Eye cups were postfixed in 1% aqueous OsO4, stained en bloc with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate, and then dehydrated through graded acetone. Samples were embedded in eponate 12-araldyte 502 resin (Ted Pella, Redding, CA). Thin sections (1 μm) across the equatorial plane were collected on glass slides and stained with Toluidine blue. Bright field images were acquired via a Zeiss Axiovert 200 light microscope with a digital camera. Ultrathin sections (60 nm) were collected and stained with Sato's triple lead solution before being examined under a JEOL JEM-1200EX II electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). Immunohistochemical staining was as follows. A previously described method was used for the immunohistological analysis (37Gong X. Li E. Klier G. Huang Q. Wu Y. Lei H. Kumar N.M. Horwitz J. Gilula N.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 833-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Fluorescent images were collected under a Zeiss Axiovert 200 fluorescent microscope with an Axiocam camera.RESULTSClapper Mutation Develops a Unique Lamellar Cataract—A female founder of the Clapper mutation (also called mouse line L10) was identified from ENU-induced F1 mutant mice in the C57BL/6J (B6) strain by slit lamp examination. This mutation develops cataracts similar to human hereditary lamellar cataracts (Fig. 1A). The cataracts can be observed in both heterozygous and homozygous mutant mice at weaning age. The homozygous lenses show a much denser opacity than the heterozygous lenses (Fig. 1B). The cataract in 3-week-old homozygous mutant mice occupies the inner region and covers ∼75% of the lens, reaching about 675 ± 5 μm radius distance from the lens center where the lens radius is ∼900 μm. The lens periphery, ∼25% of the lens and ∼225 ± 5 μm radius distance from the lens capsule, remains clear.Because of the nuclear cataract (Fig. 1E2), the retinal vasculature of the homozygous mutant mice at age 3 weeks cannot be seen through the fundus imaging (Fig. 1C2), but the fluorescein angiography shows a fuzzy image of its retinal vasculature (Fig. 1D2). We have also found that this cataract decreases in opacity as homozygous Clapper mice grow old (Fig. 1E3) and that retinal vessels could be seen in the fundus examination (Fig. 1C3). Moreover, a focused angiography was obtained from old homozygous Clapper mice (Fig. 1D3). The images of retina fundus, angiography, and the lens of a wild type mouse are shown as the controls (Fig. 1, C1, D1, and E1).CrygB-I4F Is the Causative Gene Mutation—Using 48 meioses from a backcross between heterozygous Clapper (L10) mice at C57BL/6J strain background and wild type C3H/HeJ mice, we have mapped the Clapper mutation to chromosome 1 near the linkage marker D1Mit380 with a Lod score of 4.6 by a genome-wide linage analysis (Fig. 2A). After searching the mouse genome data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information, we found crystallin Cryg gene cluster encodes six γ-crystallin isoforms, γA, γB, γC, γD, γE, and γF, in close proximity to this marker. Previous studies have shown that mutations in different Cryg members cause cataracts in humans and mice. Therefore, a DNA sequencing analysis was performed to verify the coding regions of these six γ-crystallin genes by using either reverse transcription PCR of their lens transcripts or PCR of their exons from the genomic DNA of homozygous mutant mice. We have found a missense mutation (A → T) in the CrygB gene. This point mutation results in a mutated γB-crystallin in which the 4th isoleucine, a conserved residue in members of the Cryg family, is substituted with a phenylalanine (Fig. 2B). No additional mutation was detected in the other five members (γA, γC, γD, γE, and γF) in the cluster (data not shown).Fig. 2Mapping and sequencing of the γB-crystallin gene mutation. A, a genome-wide linkage analysis mapped the Clapper (L10) mutation to chromosome 1 near marker D1Mit380 with a Lod score of 4.6 at the y-axis. Selective linkage markers are indicated along the x-axis. B, DNA sequencing result shows an A → T nucleotide change in the CrygB gene of Clapper mutation, so the 4th amino acid residue isoleucine is substituted by phenylalanine in the γB-crystallin mutant protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)γB-I4F Mutant Subunits Bind to α-Crystallin to Form High Molecular Weight Complexes—Gel filtration analysis shows an obvious reduction of both the α-crystallin peak and the γ-crystallin peak in the lens water-soluble protein fraction of heterozygous or homozygous mutant mice when compared with that of wild type mice (Fig. 3A, a). The changes of the α-crystallin peak are similar for heterozygous and homozygous lenses, whereas the γ-crystallin peak is obviously more reduced in the homozygous mutant compared with the heterozygous mutant. The β-crystallin peak seems unchanged in all the samples. The eluted α-crystallin peaks were collected and further analyzed by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels, Western blotting, and 2-DE. A representative Coomassie Blue-stained gel shows that the α-crystallin peak of heterozygous mutant lens contained normal αA-, αAINS-, and αB-crystallins, plus additional protein bands that could be recognized by an anti-γ-crystallin polyclonal antibody (Fig. 3A, b and c). Similar results were obtained from the homozygous lens samples (data not shown). Thus, the altered α-crystallin peak contains γ-crystallin.Fig. 3A, the interaction between γB-I4F and α-crystallin. a, gel filtration graphs show a reduction of α- and γ-crystallin in lens water-soluble fractions of both heterozygous (I4F/+) and homozygous (I4F/I4F) mice when compared with that of wild type (+/+) mice at the age of 3 weeks. b, the α-crystallin peaks were collected and examined by SDS gel with Coomassie Blue staining. Results show additional bands (indicated by arrowheads) in the α-crystallin peak of heterozygous (I4F/+) lenses compared with wild type (+/+) control, which consists of three α-crystallin subunits, αA (bottom band), αB (middle band), and αAins (upper band). c, Western blotting shows these additional bands in panel B are recognized by a rabbit polyclonal anti-γ-crystallin antibody. The αB-crystallin, recognized by anti-αB antibody, is shown as a reference. d, gel filtration chromatograms show that the α-crystallin peak becomes larger with high molecular weight components in the mixture of native bovine α-crystallin with recombinant γB-I4F mutant proteins, but not in the mixture with recombinant wild type γB. The mixtures of 0.4 mg of bovine α-crystallin and 0.4 mg of recombinant (wild type or mutant) γB-crystallin at the ratio of 1:1 at the 1.6 mg/ml concentration were treated at 45 °C for 30 min before being loaded into the size filtration column. B, biochemical changes of the Clapper lenses. a-d, 2-DE results of the α-crystallin peak (panel a, 1, αA-crystallin; 2, αAins; 3, αB-crystallin; 10 μg of proteins loaded) collected after a gel filtration analysis of the lens water-soluble proteins (panel b, 15 μg of proteins loaded) of 3-week-old wild type mice and of α-crystallin peak (panel c, 10 μg of proteins loaded) collected after a gel filtration analysis of the lens water-soluble proteins (panel d, 15 μg of proteins loaded) of 3-week-old homozygous Clapper mice.

https://openalex.org/W2063866084,"The tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2) is known to antagonize matrix metalloproteinase activity and to suppress tumor growth, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. We analysed the methylation status of the CpG island in the TIMP-2 promoter region by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) in hematopoietic cell lines. TIMP-2 promoter hypermethylation in the lymphoma cell line Raji and the leukemia cell line KG1a was associated with transcriptional repression. Treatment with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine resulted in TIMP-2 upregulation in both cell lines. TIMP-2 was expressed in the cell lines HL60, U266 and XG1, which carry an unmethylated promoter region. MSP analysis of primary patient samples revealed aberrant methylation of TIMP-2 in 33/90 (36.7%) cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), but not in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in nonmalignant bone marrow and lymph nodes. The frequency of TIMP-2 methylation was slightly higher in aggressive NHL subtypes compared to those with an indolent subtype (38.6 versus 33.3%). In contrast, TIMP-2 was not hypermethylated in any of the 40 cases of acute myelogenous leukemia examined. We conclude that promoter hypermethylation of TIMP-2 is a novel epigenetic event in the pathogenesis of lymphoid malignancies and may contribute to a more aggressive NHL phenotype."

We have illustrated a functional interaction between TRPC1 channels and RyR1 for the regulation of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) initiated after releasing calcium from a caffeine-sensitive intracellular calcium pool. RNA interference experiments directed to reduce the amount of TRPC1 protein indicate that RyR1 associates to at least two different types of store-operated channels (SOCs), one dependent and one independent of TRPC1. In contrast, bradykinin-induced SOCE is completely dependent on the presence of TRPC1 protein, as we have previously illustrated. Removing the foot structure from RyR1 results in normal caffeine-induced release of calcium from internal stores but abolishes the activation of SOCE, indicating that this structure is require for functional coupling to SOCs. The footless RyR1 protein shows a different cellular localization when compared with wild type RyR1. The later protein shows a higher percentage of colocalization with FM-464, a marker of plasma membrane. The implications of the foot structure for the functional and physical coupling to TRPC and SOCs is discussed.

Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar, 2Putney Jr., J.W. McKay R.R. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Although SOCE appears to be ubiquitous in non-excitable cells, recent experimental evidence indicates that SOCE is also present in skeletal muscle (3Kurebayashi N. Ogawa Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 533: 185-199Crossref Scopus (238) Google Scholar), smooth muscle (4Albert A.P. Large W.A. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and neurons (5Antaramian A. Vaca L. Rec. Res. Dev. Neurochem. 2001; 3: 47-59Google Scholar, 6Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 2003; 34: 339-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that store-operated calcium entry is a mechanism present in excitable and non-excitable cells, although it has been more extensively explored in the latter (5Antaramian A. Vaca L. Rec. Res. Dev. Neurochem. 2001; 3: 47-59Google Scholar). Because our original finding demonstrating that the trp gene from Drosophila melanogaster encoded a calcium-permeable cationic channel activated upon depletion of the ER (7Vaca L. Sinkins W.G. Hu Y. Kunze D.L. Schilling W.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1501-C1505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), many members of the TRP superfamily have been identified in a wide variety of organisms, from yeast to humans (for review see Refs. 8Clapham D.E. Nature. 2003; 426: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar, 9Putney Jr., J.W.

Nephrol. 2004; 15: 1690-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The plethora of mechanisms modulating TRP channel function has made the study of the physiological role of many of these channels difficult (8Clapham D.E. Nature. 2003; 426: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar, 11Harteneck C. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, the activity of some of the members from the TRPC subfamily appears to be linked to the depletion of the ER via interactions with inositol triphosphate (IP3R) receptors (12Kiselyov K. Mignery G.A. Zhu M.X. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 13Putney Jr., J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. 2000; 350: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). All members of the TRPC subfamily possess sequences at their carboxyl-terminal domain that bind selectively IP3R (17Tang J. Lin Y. Zhang Z. Tikunova S. Birnbaumer L. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21303-21310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have shown recently functional interactions between peptides corresponding to the amino-terminal domain of IP3R and TRPC1 channels (18Vaca L. Sampieri A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42178-42187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The conformational coupling hypothesis was proposed to explain the communication between the TRPC channel at the plasma membrane and the IP3R at the ER, a system homologous to the coupling between the dihydropyridine receptor and the ryanodine receptor (RyR) in skeletal muscle (19Protasi F. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 650-658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle cells, the RyR is an essential player in the excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling mechanism. The RyR associates to the dihydropyridine receptor localized at the plasma membrane via protein-protein interactions (19Protasi F. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 650-658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This association is responsible for coupling the depolarization at the plasma membrane with the activation of the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) and the concomitant release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Interestingly, it has been recently shown that activation of RyR opens human TRPC3 channels (hTRPC3) in HEK293 cells (20Kiselyov K.I. Shin D.M. Wang Y. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 421-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), suggesting a functional coupling between RyR and hTRPC3 similar to what has been previously reported for hTRPC3 and IP3R (21Boulay G. Brown D.M. Qin N. Jiang M. Dietrich A. Zhu M.X. Chen Z. Birnbaumer M. Mikoshiba K. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14955-14960Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Furthermore, depletion of the ER via activation of RyR in cells lacking IP3R initiates SOCE, illustrating functional coupling between RyR and store-operated channels (SOCs) in the absence of IP3R (22Kiselyov K. Shin D.M. Shcheynikov N. Kurosaki T. Muallem S. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Depletion of the sarcoplasmic reticulum stimulates calcium influx in skeletal muscle (3Kurebayashi N. Ogawa Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 533: 185-199Crossref Scopus (238) Google Scholar), similar to the activation of calcium influx in non-excitable cells. The physiological role of SOCE in skeletal muscle remains to be uncovered. Nevertheless, recent experimental evidence suggests that altered regulation of TRPC channels may play a role in muscle disease (23Vandebrouck C. Martin D. Colson-Van Schoor M. Debaix H. Gailly P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1089-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In the present work functional association is demonstrated between the depletion of internal calcium stores via activation of skeletal muscle RyR (RyR1) and activation of SOCE in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with RyR1 constructs. Furthermore, it is shown that the foot structure from the RyR1 is required for functional coupling between RyR1 activity and SOC channel activation. The footless RyR1 (RyR-COOH) protein shows a different cellular localization when compared with wild type RyR1. The later protein shows a higher percentage of co-localization with FM-464, a marker of plasma membrane. In addition, we also show that part of the SOC requires TRPC1 channels, since elimination of TRPC1 with RNA interference significantly reduces SOCE induced by the depletion of the ER via activation of RyR1. The remaining SOC activity is inhibited by lanthanum, whereas the TRPC1-dependent SOC activity is insensitive to this trivalent cation. Based on this evidence, RyR1 appears to associate to at least two different types of SOCs; one requires TRPC1 protein, whereas the other does not. Eliminating the foot structure prevents functional associations between RyR-COOH and all SOCs. Reagents and Solutions—All salts used were analytical grade purchased from Sigma), with the exception of xestospongin C and BAPTA-AM, which were purchased from A. G. Scientific (San Diego, CA). FM-464 was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The phosphate-buffered saline (extracellular) solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 HEPES mm adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH. For patch clamp experiments the intracellular (pipette) solution contained 140 mm potassium aspartate, 10 mm CsCl, 5 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, adjusted with NaOH. The CsCl and tetraethylammonium chloride were used to eliminate endogenous outward potassium currents, which interfere with the measurements of currents via TRP1 and SOC channels. Cell Culture—CHO cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in culture using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 1% antibiotics, 2 mm glutamine, and 10% bovine fetal serum (Invitrogen). Cells were grown on plastic Petri dishes and maintained with 5% CO2 in a humidity-controlled incubator (Nuaire, Plymouth, MN), as previously described (18Vaca L. Sampieri A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42178-42187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Stable Expression of RyR1 Constructs in CHO Cells—The full-length cDNA encoding the rabbit RyR1 and the amino-terminal domain containing the pore region (RyR1-COOH) lacking amino acids 280-3661 were cloned into the in-house-produced lIRES-NEO expression vector. The expression of the RyR1 constructs is driven by the immediate early promoter from the cytomegalovirus, which was followed by a polyhistidine tag for Western blotting analysis using an anti-histidine antibody. After the multiple cloning site, the vector contains an internal ribosome entry site cloned from the encephalomyocarditis virus and followed by the neomycin resistance gene and a polyadenylation sequence. Individual colonies obtained from cells transfected with these constructs were collected after 3 weeks in culture in the continuous presence of 1 mg/ml G418. Colonies were expanded and tested by PCR for the RyR1 constructs and used for Western blotting and confocal microscopy analysis. Double-stranded RNA Interference—Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) from TRPC1 was produced as previously described (18Vaca L. Sampieri A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42178-42187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, a fragment from isolated CHO cells and corresponding to TRPC1 was cloned in pBlueScript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and linearized with BamHI to produce a single-stranded RNA using the MEGAscript kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) with the T3 polymerase. In a separated experiment the vector with the insert was linearized with EcoRV to produce the complementary RNA strand with the T7 polymerase. Equal amounts of both single-stranded RNA products were mixed and heated at 60 °C and let cool down slowly for 30 min until room temperature was reached. 5 μg of dsRNA were mixed with Lipofectamine plus (Invitrogen), and the mixture was placed on 60-mm Petri dishes containing 50% confluent CHO cells. 48 and 72 h later the same cells were transfected again with 5 μg of dsRNA each time. Control cells were transfected with 5 μg of dsRNA obtained from the enhanced green fluorescence protein (N1 vector, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). CHO cells were transfected three times with the dsRNA using a similar procedure to the one described above. Cellular Fractionation—Membrane fractionation of CHO cells was performed as reported previously (24Antaramian A. Butanda-Ochoa A. Vazquez-Martinez O. Diaz-Munoz M. Vaca L. Cell Calcium. 2001; 30: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were sonicated and homogenized in 10 volumes of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mm KCl, 0.5% CHAPS, 1 mm EGTA, and one tablet of the complete peptidase-inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). After a centrifugation at 650 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 120,000 × g for 90 min to obtain the total membrane fraction. The total membrane fraction was resuspended in 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, in the presence of the peptidase inhibitors. [3H]Ryanodine and [3H]IP3 Binding Assays—[3H]Ryanodine was incubated for 12-14 h at room temperature with 100-150 μg of the total membrane fraction from control and CHO cells expressing RyR1 constructs in 0.25 ml of binding buffer containing 200 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 100 μm CaCl2, 300 mm KCl, 2.5 mg of bovine serum albumin, and 3 nm [3H]ryanodine. Nonspecific binding was obtained using 10 μm unlabeled ryanodine. At the end of the incubation time, samples were filtered in Whatman GF/F glass fiber filters using a multifilter harvester (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD). The filters were rinsed with 5-ml aliquots of ice-cold KCl 300 mm, and the radioactivity contained on them was quantified in a liquid scintillation counter after the addition of 5 ml of Tritosol (24Antaramian A. Butanda-Ochoa A. Vazquez-Martinez O. Diaz-Munoz M. Vaca L. Cell Calcium. 2001; 30: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). [3H]IP3 was incubated for 30 min at 0 °C with 100 μg of the total membrane fraction from control and CHO cells expressing RyR1 constructs in 120 μl of binding buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 5 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm EDTA, 250 μm dithiothreitol, and 4 nm [3H]IP3. Nonspecific binding was defined with 10 μm unlabeled IP3. The samples were filtered through Whatman GF/F glass fiber filters using a multifilter harvester (Brandel). The filters were then washed with five 5-ml aliquots of a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm NaHCO3, and 1 mm EDTA and counted in a liquid scintillation counter after the addition of 5 ml of Tritosol. Western Blotting Analysis—Total membrane extracts from control cells and RNA interference (RNAi)-treated cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose paper as previously reported (18Vaca L. Sampieri A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42178-42187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Antibody antihistidine (Clontech Laboratories) was diluted 1:300 in buffer A containing 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, the nitrocellulose sheets were washed 5 times for 15 min each time with buffer A and incubated for 30 min with luciferase-labeled mouse anti-rabbit antibody diluted 1:1000 (Sigma). After a second washing period, bound antibody was visualized with Supersignal Ultra chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce). Analysis of the Expression of mTRPC1 mRNA by RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from wild type cells and cells transfected with mTRPC5 and the mTRPC5 mutants using the TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen). Approximately 500 ng of total RNA was used as the template for RT-PCR, which was carried out using the ONEStep system with superscript II (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocols. The primers used for TRPC1 produced a 428-bp product and were previously published (18Vaca L. Sampieri A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42178-42187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession number AF448492). Confocal Microscopy—CHO cells were platted on glass coverslips at low confluence. Coverslips were mounted on an inverted microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY) attached to the confocal system (Bio-Rad). An oil-immersed 60× objective was used for all observations (Nikon). When indicated, cells were incubated for 2 min with brefeldin-rhodamine conjugate (Molecular Probes) and 10 min with ryanodine-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (Molecular Probes). Cells were washed 5 times to remove free reagents before the observations. Data analysis and reconstructions of three-dimensional optical sections was performed with Image-pro plus and three-dimensional constructor (Media Cybernetics, San Diego, CA). Simultaneous Measurements of Free Cytosolic Calcium and Electrophysiology in Single Cells—Simultaneous measurements of free calcium in CHO cells were monitored using an imaging system consisting of Image-pro plus 5 and a CCD camera (Media Cybernetics) attached to an inverted microscope (Nikon). The microscope contained emission (535 nm) and excitation (488 nm) filters for Fluo-4 fluorescence, and the light source was a 250-watt halogen lamp coupled to the microscope via fiber optics. Cells were loaded with 5 μm Fluo-4 (Molecular Probes) as previously described (18Vaca L. Sampieri A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42178-42187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The perforated patch clamp technique was used to monitor simultaneous whole-cell currents using an EPC-9 amplifier (HEKA Instruments, Southborough, MA). The reference electrode was an Ag-AgCl plug connected to the bath solution via a 100 mm KCl agar bridge. Nystatin was dissolved in methanol (10 mg/ml stock solution) and added to the pipette solution at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. Cell capacitance was monitored using a continuous voltage pulse of 1 mV for 50 ms until electrical access into the cell was gained. At this point the simultaneous measurements of calcium and whole cell currents initiated. The cell membrane potential was maintained at -100 mV for the duration of the experiment. The cell fluorescence reported in the figures represents the total single cell fluorescence after background and autofluorescence subtraction (ΔF/ΔFo). All drugs were applied to the cell via a Picospritzer II (General Valve, Houston, TX) using a multi-barrel glass tip. Functional Expression of RyR1 Constructs—Cells stably expressing the full-length type 1 ryanodine receptor from rabbit skeletal muscle (RyR-WT) or the construct missing the foot structure (Δ280-3661 amino acids) and containing the carboxyl-terminal (pore) domain (RyR-COOH) were analyzed by Western blot to determine the presence of both proteins. Fig. 1A illustrates a representative Western blot illustrating the presence of the human type 2 bradykinin receptor (lane 1), RyR-WT (lane 3), or the RyR-COOH (lane 4). Lane 2 shows the Western blot obtained from cells not transfected with any of the constructs mentioned above (wild type CHO cells). The right side of panel A shows the two constructs used in this study. A polyhistidine sequence (histidine tag) was inserted at their amino-terminal ends to facilitate the identification of the proteins by Western blotting using a commercial antibody (“Materials and Methods”). The RyR-WT expressed in CHO cells show a typical RyR pharmacology (Fig. 1B). The binding of [3H]ryanodine increased with the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue AMP-PCP by more than 2-fold. This binding was inhibited by 5 μm ruthenium red (RuR). As expected, [3H]ryanodine binding was stimulated with 5 mm caffeine (+CAFF) in the presence of low calcium (50 nm). Fig. 1C shows [3H]IP3 binding from the same cells expressing RyR-WT. The [3H]IP3 binding was inhibited by heparin (1 mg/ml) and was not affected by the IP3R inhibitor xestospongin C(5 μm). This result was expected since heparin interferes with the IP3 binding site in the IP3R, whereas Xestospongin C does not (26Wilcox R.A. Primrose W.U. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 467-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Simultaneous Measurements of Intracellular Calcium and Electrophysiology—Fig. 2 shows a typical experiment where simultaneous measurements of intracellular calcium (Fig. 2A) and whole-cell currents (B) were obtained in real time in response to 50 nm Bk. All experiments described in this manuscript followed the same procedure; first the cell was exposed to Bk or caffeine in the absence of extracellular calcium with the intention of releasing calcium from intracellular storage compartments. In all cases this initial maneuver resulted in a rapid increment in fluorescence followed by a decline of fluorescence to a basal level similar to the one observed before the stimulation. During this part no changes in whole-cell currents were observed, consistent with the notion that this initial maneuver stimulates release of calcium from intracellular stores. After calcium reached a new steady state level near base line, extracellular calcium was reincorporated in the bath solution to initiate influx of calcium. This later maneuver resulted in a new increment in fluorescence and activation of inward currents, which reflected the influx of calcium from the extracellular space via SOCs. The second increment in fluorescence was also transient, slowly declining toward base-line levels. In all experiments, the inward current declined too, following a similar time course of that observed for the changes in fluo-4 fluorescence. Depletion of Intracellular Calcium Stores via IP3R or RyR1 Initiates Calcium Influx and Activates SOC—Using the experimental procedure described in the legend to Fig. 2, we proceeded to explore the role of RyR1 activation in the initiation of calcium influx via SOCs. Activation of SOCs after depletion of intracellular calcium stores via stimulation of RyR1 has been previously reported. A previous study showed functional interactions between RyR1, the human TRPC3 channel (hTRPC3), and Icrac channels (20Kiselyov K.I. Shin D.M. Wang Y. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 421-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A illustrates a typical experiment using Bk to release calcium from the ER and monitor calcium influx after the addition of calcium to the extracellular solution. Fig. 3B shows the effect of incubating the cell with the IP3R selective inhibitor, xestospongin C (Xestos C). As illustrated in the figure, incubating the cell for 5 min with Xestos C (2 μm) inhibited completely the release of calcium from the ER induced by Bk. The addition of calcium to the extracellular solution failed to induce calcium influx. This behavior is expected since SOCs are only activated upon depletion of intracellular calcium stores, and it has been extensively shown that maneuvers that interfere with the release of calcium from the ER prevent activation of SOCs. To further demonstrate that the effect observed was the result of interfering with IP3R activity, we used a structurally and mechanistically different IP3R inhibitor, heparin. Because heparin does not cross the plasma membrane, this type of experiment was not conducted in the perforated patch mode (like all the experiments described in this report) but in the whole-cell configuration, and heparin (1 mg/ml) was included in the pipette solution. Heparin was also very effective in preventing release of calcium from internal stores initiated by Bk (Fig. 3C). Similarly to the results obtained with Xestos C, heparin also prevented the activation of SOCs, as indicated by the absence of calcium influx and whole-cell currents after the addition of calcium to the extracellular solution (Fig. 3C). Because we obtained indistinguishable results with both IP3R inhibitors, we decided to use Xestos C (2 μm) for the rest of the study. This decision was based on two facts; (a) there is abundant evidence in the literature showing diverse effects of heparin other than inhibiting IP3R (in this regard Xestos C is a cleaner IP3R inhibitor), and (b) using heparin as IP3R inhibitor would imply working in the whole-cell mode, and we wanted to reduce the interference of the pipette solution on the intracellular milieu. Because Xestos C is membrane-permeable, we could conduct all experiments in the perforated patch mode. We next explored the effect of caffeine in control CHO cells (RyR1-, cells not expressing the RyR constructs). In these cells, 5 mm caffeine (CAF) was ineffective in inducing release of calcium from internal stores and failed to activate SOCs, as illustrated in the representative experiment shown in Fig. 3D. In contrast, CHO cells expressing the full-length type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1+) showed a typical transient elevation of intracellular calcium in response to 5 mm CAF in the absence of extracellular calcium (reflecting release of calcium from internal stores). The addition of calcium resulted in a second increment in fluo-4 fluorescence, reflecting a transient elevation of intracellular calcium. Simultaneous activation of inward currents was observed that followed a similar time course to the fluorescence. To eliminate any possible contribution of IP3R to the increments in intracellular calcium and currents induced with caffeine, RyR1+ cells were incubated with 2 μm Xestos C. Under these experimental conditions Bk stimulation failed to induce changes in intracellular calcium (Fig. 3F) as expected since the IP3R was inhibited by 2 μm Xestos C. However, CAF stimulation induced a typical transient increment in intracellular calcium. The subsequent addition of calcium to the extracellular solution produced a transient calcium influx and concomitant activation of inward currents. These results show that release of calcium from internal stores via activation of RyR1 is sufficient to induce SOC activity and calcium influx in cells where the IP3R is inhibited and, therefore, does not contribute significantly to the release of calcium under these conditions. This result shows a functional interaction between RyR1 and SOC in CHO cells expressing the skeletal muscle type 1 ryanodine receptor. A similar interaction has been previously reported for hTRPC3 and for the calcium-release activated calcium current (Icrac) (20Kiselyov K.I. Shin D.M. Wang Y. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 421-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Depletion of Internal Calcium Stores via IP3 or Caffeine—To evaluate if bradykinin (via the production of IP3) and caffeine were equally effective in depleting internal calcium stores, we performed experiments utilizing the calcium ionophore, ionomycin. Fig. 4A shows the effect of increasing concentrations of Bk on calcium release and influx measured as increments in fluorescence. A dose-dependent effect of Bk was observed for release of calcium from internal stores and calcium influx. As illustrated in Fig. 4B, both release and influx reached a maximum value at the same Bk concentrations; the half-activation constant (Kac) was 56 ± 8 nm for the release and 62 ± 12 (n = 14) for the influx. This type of experiment could not be performed with caffeine since the response of RyR1 to caffeine is not linear, and with higher caffeine concentrations the RyR1 activity decays. However, as illustrated in Fig. 4, C-D, the Bk concentration that produced the maximum release and influx (100 nm) was equally effective in releasing calcium from internal stores as 5 mm caffeine. After application of 100 nm Bk or 5 mm CAF, a second application of 1 μm ionomycin produced a second release of calcium with similar magnitudes (Fig. 4D). Under these conditions a third ionomycin application failed to release further calcium from internal stores, indicating that the stores were emptied of all releasable calcium.

(1991) Biochemistry 30, 230-238). To study further the role of this [2Fe-2S] cluster in proton translocation of the bc1 complex, Rhodobacter sphaeroides mutants expressing His-tagged cytochrome bc1 complexes with mutations at the histidine ligands of the [2Fe-2S] cluster were generated and characterized. These mutants lacked the [2Fe-2S] cluster and possessed no bc1 activity. When the mutant complex was co-inlaid in phospholipid vesicles with intact bovine mitochondrial bc1 complex or cytochrome c oxidase, the proton ejection, normally observed in intact reductase or oxidase vesicles during the oxidation of their corresponding substrates, disappeared. This indicated the creation of a proton-leaking channel in the mutant complex, whose [2Fe-2S] cluster was lacking. Insertion of the bc1 complex lacking the head domain of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein, removed by thermolysin digestion, into PL vesicles together with mitochondrial bc1 complex also rendered the vesicles proton-permeable. Addition of the excess purified head domain of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein partially restored the proton-pumping activity. These results indicated that elimination of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in mutant bc1 complexes opened up an otherwise closed proton channel within the bc1 complex. It was speculated that in the normal catalytic cycle of the bc1 complex, the [2Fe-2S] cluster may function as a proton-exiting gate.

The cytochrome bc1 complex, also known as ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase or complex III, is the central segment of the energy-conserving, electron transfer chain of the mitochondria and many respiratory and photosynthetic bacteria (1Trumpower B.L. Gennis R.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 675-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). This enzyme complex catalyzes electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c (c2 in bacteria) with concomitant translocation of protons across the membrane to generate a proton electrochemical gradient required for ATP synthesis by ATP synthase. The cytochrome bc1 complexes from all species contain three core subunits, cytochrome b, cytochrome c1, and Rieske iron-sulfur protein (ISP), 1The abbreviations used are: ISP, Rieske iron-sulfur protein; [2Fe-2S], Rieske iron-sulfur cluster; PL, phospholipid; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; ISF, Rieske iron-sulfur fragment; CcO, cytochrome c oxidase; Q0C10BrH2, 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-bromodecyl-1,4-benzoquinol; ICM, intra-cytoplasmic membrane; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; DM, n-dodecyl β-d-maltopyranoside; TM, transmembrane; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: ISP, Rieske iron-sulfur protein; [2Fe-2S], Rieske iron-sulfur cluster; PL, phospholipid; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; ISF, Rieske iron-sulfur fragment; CcO, cytochrome c oxidase; Q0C10BrH2, 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-bromodecyl-1,4-benzoquinol; ICM, intra-cytoplasmic membrane; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; DM, n-dodecyl β-d-maltopyranoside; TM, transmembrane; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. that house two b-type cytochromes (b566 and b562), one c-type cytochrome (c1), and a high potential Rieske [2Fe-2S] cluster, respectively. However, the number of non-redox group containing subunits, also called supernumerary subunits, in the complex varies from species to species. Recently, the three-dimensional crystal structures of mitochondrial bc1 complexes from bovine (2Xia D. Yu C.-A. Kim H. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J.

The structures of the cytochrome b6f complex, a complex analogous to the cytochrome bc1 complex that provides an electronic connection between photosystems I and II, have also been established for the thermophilic cyanobacterium Mastigocladus laminosus (6Kurisu G.

Strong evidence in support of this movement has been reported (4Zhang Z.L. Huang L.S. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y.I. Kim K.K. Huang L.W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.H.

Acta. 1983; 723: 202-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) has been favored for describing electron and proton translocation in the cytochrome bc1 complex. The key feature of this model is the presence of two separate ubiquinol/ubiquinone-binding sites as follows: a ubiquinol oxidation site (Qo) near the P side (inter-membranes space) of the mitochondrial inner membrane, and a ubiquinone reduction site (Qi) near the N side (matrix). Because of a lack of information on the binding of ubiquinol at the putative Qo site from the three-dimensional structures, the detailed bifurcation of ubiquinol oxidation, the key step in the Q-cycle mechanism is difficult to establish. Several models of the bifurcated oxidation of ubiquinol at the Qo site have been proposed (22Link T.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 23Brandt U. Okun J.G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 13535-13541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It has been established that for every electron transferred through the bc1 complex, two protons are translocated across the membrane. This 2H+/e- stoichiometry has been verified in a wide variety of species, in vitro, by studying bc1 complexes in phospholipid (PL) vesicles. Proton pumping by the bc1 complex inlaid PL vesicles requires an intact membrane that prevents nonspecific proton leakage. Any compromise of membrane integrity results in loss of the proton electrochemical gradient, as is observed when an uncoupler like carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) is added to either intact mitochondria or PL vesicles harboring electron transfer complexes. The integrity of the membrane is maintained by its protein and lipid components. Although the proton translocation pathway in the cytochrome bc1 complex is not fully understood, the involvement of the [2Fe-2S] cluster of ISP has been suggested. When bovine mitochondrial bc1 complex is illuminated with a projector light in the presence of hematoporphyrin under aerobic conditions, the complex becomes inactivated as the [2Fe-2S] cluster in the treated complex is destroyed (29Miki T. Yu L. Yu C.-A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). When the photo-inactivated bc1 complex is co-inlaid in PL vesicles with intact bovine bc1 complex, no proton ejection is detected during ubiquinol oxidation. These findings suggest that a proton-permeable channel is created in the photo-inactivated complex. However, because the hematoporphyrin-promoted photo-inactivation site in the bc1 complex is not specific, the formation of a proton-leaking channel in the photo-inactivated complex may result from the oxidation of key amino acid residues in the bc1 complex, rather than from destruction of the [2Fe-2S] cluster alone. Therefore, in order to establish unambiguously the involvement of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in the proton transfer pathway, a bc1 complex either lacking the cluster or possessing a damaged one is necessary. We think that such a bc1 complex can be obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of the histidine residues His-131 and His-152 of the ISP, which serve as ligands to the [2Fe-2S] cluster. Here we report the generation and characterization of Rhodobacter sphaeroides strains expressing cytochrome bc1 complexes with substitutions at one or both the histidine ligands of the [2Fe-2S] cluster. The proton-pumping activities of the protein-PL vesicles containing intact bovine mitochondrial bc1 complex, or cytochrome c oxidase, and the mutant complex were determined and compared with those of protein-PL vesicles containing intact mitochondrial bc1 complex or cytochrome c oxidase and wild-type bacterial bc1 complex. Restoration of proton-pumping activity was explored by adding excess amounts of ISP head domain containing the [2Fe-2S] cluster to proton-leaking PL vesicles embedding mitochondrial bc1 complex and thermolysin-digested bacterial bc1 complex. Materials—Cytochrome c (horse heart, type III), carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, and thermolysin were from Sigma. Asolectin was obtained from Associate Concentrate and purified according to the method of Racker and Kagawa (30Kagawa Y. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5477-5487Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). n-Dodecyl β-d-maltoside and n-dodecyl β-d-glucoside were from Anatrace. Ni-NTA gel and Qiaprep Spin Miniprep kit were from Qiagen. 2,3-Dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-bromodecyl-1,4-benzoquinol (Q0C10BrH2) was prepared in our laboratory as reported previously (11Tian H. White S. Yu L. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7146-7152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available. Generation of R. sphaeroides Strains Expressing the His6-tagged bc1 Complexes with Mutation at the Histidine Ligand of the [2Fe-2S] Cluster of ISP—Mutations were constructed with the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene using a supercoiled double-stranded pGEM7Zf(+)-fbcFB as template and a forward and reverse primer for PCR amplification. The pGEM7Zf(+)-fbcFB plasmid (31Xiao K. Liu X. Yu C.-A. Yu L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1488-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) was constructed by ligating the EcoRI-XbaI fragment from pSELNB-3503 into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of the pGEM7Zf(+) plasmid. The primers used were as follows: H131C(F), GCGTCTGCACCTGCCTCGGCTGCGTGC, and H131C(R), GCACGCAGCCGAGGCAGGTGCAGACGC; H152C(F), GTTCTGCCCCTGCTGCGGATCGCACTACG, and H152C(R), CGTAGTGCGATCCGCAGCAGGGGCAGAAC; F and R in parentheses denote forward and reverse primers, respectively. The Eco-RI-XbaI fragment from the pGEM7Zf(+)-fbcFmB plasmid was ligated into the pRKD418-fbcFBKmCHQ plasmid to generate the pRKD418-fbcFmBCHQ plasmid. A plate-mating procedure was used to mobilize the pRKD418-fbcFmBCHQ plasmid from Escherichia coli S17-1 cells into R. sphaeroides BC-17 cells, as described previously (32Mather M.W. Yu L. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28668-28675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The presence of the engineered mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing, before and after semi-aerobic growth of the cells. The expression plasmid, pRKDfbcFmBCHQ, was purified from an aliquot of semi-aerobically grown culture using the Qiagen Plasmid Mini Prep kit. Because R. sphaeroides cells contain four types of endogenous plasmids, the isolated plasmids lacked the purity and concentration needed for direct sequencing. Therefore, a 2-kb pair DNA segment containing the mutation sequence was amplified from the isolated plasmids by PCR and sequenced. DNA sequencing and oligonucleotide syntheses were carried out at the Recombinant DNA/Protein Core Facility at Oklahoma State University. Growth of Bacteria—E. coli cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium. For semi-aerobic growth of the plasmid-bearing R. sphaeroides BC-17 cells, an enriched Sistrom's medium (33Sistrom W.R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1960; 22: 778-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) supplemented with 20 amino acids and extra-rich vitamins were used. Cells harboring the mutated fbc genes on the pRKDfbcFmBCHQ plasmid were grown semi-aerobically for only one or two serial passages, in order to minimize any pressure for reversion. The semi-aerobic cultures were grown in 800 ml of enriched Sistrom's medium in 2-liter Bellco flasks with vigorous shaking (150 rpm) for about 26 h at 30 °C in the dark. The inoculation volumes used for semi-aerobic growth were at least 5% of the total volume. Antibiotics were added to the following concentrations: ampicillin (125 μg/ml), kanamycin sulfate (30 μg/ml for E. coli and 20 μg/ml for R. sphaeroides), tetracycline (10 μg/ml for E. coli and 1 μg/ml for R. sphaeroides), and trimethoprim (100 μg/ml for E. coli and 30 μg/ml for R. sphaeroides). Enzyme Preparations and Activity Assay—Chromatophores and intra-cytoplasmic membranes (ICMs) were prepared as described previously (10Tian H. Yu L. Michael W. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and stored at -80 °C in the presence of 20% glycerol. The His6-tagged cytochrome bc1 complexes were purified from frozen ICMs or chromatophores by the method of Tian et al. (10Tian H. Yu L. Michael W. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Purified cytochrome bc1 complexes were stored at -80 °C in the presence of 10% glycerol. To assay ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity, membrane preparations or purified cytochrome bc1 complexes were diluted with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 200 mm NaCl and 0.01% n-dodecyl β-d-maltopyranoside (DM) to a final cytochrome b concentration of 1 μm. 5 μl of the diluted samples were added to 1 ml of assay mixture containing 100 mm of sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.3 mm EDTA, 50 μm ferricytochrome c, and 25 μm Q0C10BrH2. Activities were determined by measuring the reduction of cytochrome c, by following the increase in the absorbance at 550 nm, in a Shimadzu UV-2101 PC spectrophotometer at 23 °C using a millimolar extinction coefficient of 18.5 mm-1 cm-1 for calculations. The non-enzymatic oxidation of Q0C10BrH2, determined under similar conditions in the absence of the enzyme, was subtracted during calculations for the specific activity. Potassium cyanide was added to a final concentration of 30 μm in the assay mixture to inhibit cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) when determining the bc1 activity in ICMs or chromatophores. Preparation of Electron Transfer Complex Inlaid PL Vesicles—Protein-PL vesicles were prepared by the cholate dialysis method of Kagawa and Racker (30Kagawa Y. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5477-5487Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Bovine heart ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase or CcO, either singly or in combination with R. sphaeroides wild-type or mutant bc1 complex, was mixed with 1 ml of asolectin micellar solution to give an asolectin (mg)/protein (mg) ratio of 40. The asolectin micellar solution was prepared by sonicating 200 mg of acetone-washed asolectin in 4 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2% sodium cholate and 100 mm KCl (for use in preparation of bc1 complex-PL vesicles), and in 4 ml of 100 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.3, containing 10 mm KCl and 2% sodium cholate (for use in preparation of CcO-PL vesicles), in an ice-water bath. Sonication was performed in an anaerobic environment by continually passing argon into the vessel. The bc1 complex-PL mixtures were incubated at 0 °C for 30 min before overnight dialysis at 4 °C against 100 volumes of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm KCl with three changes of buffer. The mixture was then dialyzed against 100 volumes of 150 mm KCl for 3-4 h. The CcO-PL mixture was dialyzed against 100 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.3, containing 10 mm KCl for 4 h followed by 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.3, containing 50 mm KCl and 50 mm sucrose with one change of buffer for 12 h each. Subsequently, the vesicles were dialyzed against two changes of 50 μm Hepes-KOH buffer, pH 7.3, containing 55 mm KCl and 55 mm sucrose, for 12 and 4 h (34Kannt A. Soulimane T. Buse G. Becker A. Bamberg E. Michel H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Determination of Proton Translocating Activity of bc1 Complex-PL Vesicles—Proton translocation coupled to electron flow through the bc1 complex-PL vesicles was measured at room temperature using an Accumet model 10 pH meter and a model 13-620-96 combination pH electrode. Twenty five nanomoles of Q0C10BrH2 was added to the 1.6-ml reaction mixture containing 150 mm KCl, 4 μm ferricytochrome c, 1 μm valinomycin, and an appropriate amount of bc1-PL vesicles (30-50 μl). Electron flow was initiated by the addition of 5 nmol of ferricyanide, which oxidizes the cytochrome c, and thus provides an electron acceptor for the complex. Electron flow under conditions where no transmembrane ΔpH formed was measured in an identical manner except that the protonophore, CCCP, was present at a concentration of 2 μm to make the vesicles permeable to protons. Proton pumping (H+/e-) was calculated as the ratio of the decrease in pH upon ferricyanide addition to bc1-PL vesicles before and after treatment with CCCP. Determination of Proton-pumping Activity of CcO-PL Vesicles—Proton-pumping experiments involving CcO-PL vesicles were conducted at 23 °C in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer from Applied Photophysics, SX.18MV. Reaction vessel A contains 2 μm CcO-PL vesicles, 110 μm phenol red, 2 μm valinomycin in 50 μm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.3, and 55 mm KCl. Reaction vessel B contains 30 μm horse heart ferrocytochrome c in the same buffer (34Kannt A. Soulimane T. Buse G. Becker A. Bamberg E. Michel H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Electron flow was initiated by mixing equal volumes of the reaction components in vessels A and B. Proton pumping was measured by monitoring the absorbance changes of phenol red at 556.6 nm. At this wavelength, the absorption change due to cytochrome c is minimal as it is the isosbestic point for cytochrome c. Because the pH of the components of vessels A and B were the same, no nonspecific absorbance changes should be observed. Preparation of the Head Domain of ISP (ISF) from R. sphaeroides bc1 Complex—The method used for the preparation of ISF from the mitochondrial bc1 complex (35Link T.A. Saynovits M. Assman C. Iwata S. Ohnishi T. Von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was adapted to prepare the ISF from wild-type R. sphaeroides bc1 complex. Two μm wild-type R. sphaeroides bc1 complex was suspended in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 100 mm NaCl. 0.2 μm thermolysin was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 3 h. Thermolysin digestion of the bc1 complex was stopped by the addition of 10 mm EDTA. The EDTA-containing reaction mixture was dialyzed overnight against 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, with one change of buffer. The dialyzed sample was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 3 h. The precipitate was discarded, and the supernatant was applied to a calcium phosphate-cellulose column (36Lee G.Y. He D.-Y. Yu L. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6193-6198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) equilibrated with 150 mm NaCl and 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Calcium phosphate was prepared according to Jenner (37, Jenner, E. R. (June 5, 1973) U. S. Patent 3737516Google Scholar) and mixed at a 3:1 ratio with cellulose powder, prior to use in column chromatography, for enhancement of the flow rate. The ISF did not bind to the column under these conditions and was recovered in the column effluent, which was then concentrated to about 0.5 mg/ml using Centriprep YM-3 from Amicon. The concentrated ISF was applied to a Mono-Q column (from Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm MOPS, pH 6.2, containing 20 mm NaCl. Thermolysin was not absorbed by the column and was therefore removed in the effluent. The ISF-absorbed column was subjected to a stepwise NaCl gradient wash, and ISF was eluted at 100 mm NaCl. The complete removal of thermolysin in the ISF-containing fractions was ensured by the absence of protease activity, assayed using casein as substrate. Other Biochemical and Biophysical Techniques—Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (38Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytochrome b (39Berden J.A. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 1986; 852: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) concentrations were determined according to published methods. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemelli (41Laemelli V.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad Mini-protean dual slab vertical cell. The polypeptides separated in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel were transferred electrophoretically to a 22-μm nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting. Polyclonal antibodies generated against ISP of the R. sphaeroides bc1 complex were used as the primary antibody to detect their respective antigens (10Tian H. Yu L. Michael W. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Protein A conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, from Bio-Rad, was used as the second antibody. The [2Fe-2S] cluster of ISP was determined by EPR, using a Bruker EMX spectrometer equipped with an Air Products flow cryostat, and by circular dichroism (42Link T.A. Hatzfied O. Unalkat P. Shergill J.K. Cammack R. Mason J.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7546-7552Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 43Crofts A.R. Ugulava N.B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), using a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter. Instrument settings are detailed in the legends of the relevant figures. Characterizations of Mutants Carrying Mutations at the Histidine Ligands of [2Fe-2S] Cluster in ISP—Four R. sphaeroides mutants expressing His6-tagged bc1 complexes with mutations at the histidine ligands of [2Fe-2S] cluster were generated for this study. They are three single mutants, H131N, H152N, and H131C, and a double mutant, H131C/H152C. For mutants to be useful for this study, the resulting mutant complexes must lack the [2Fe-2S] cluster but have protein and redox components similar to those in the wild-type complex. When aerobically dark grown wild-type and mutant cells were inoculated into enriched Sistrom's medium at mid-log phase and subjected to anaerobic photosynthetic growth conditions, all four mutants did not grow. However, these mutants grew aerobically and semi-aerobically at rates comparable with that of wild-type cells. These results indicated that the four mutants have a defective cytochrome bc1 complex, because this complex is absolutely required for photosynthetic growth of this bacterium. When ICMs were prepared from semi-aerobically grown mutant cells and assayed for ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity, none was detected in the four mutant membranes. Absorption spectral analysis revealed that the content and absorption spectral properties of cytochrome b and cytochromes (c1 + c2) in all these mutant membranes were similar to those in the complement chromatophores or ICM (see Table I), indicating that the mutation did not affect the assembly of cytochrome b and c1 into the membrane. EPR analysis revealed that these four mutant membranes contained no [2Fe-2S] cluster of ISP, indicating that the mutation resulted in an inability of the [2Fe-2S] cluster to be ligated to apo-ISP, thereby leading to loss of bc1 activity. Western blot analysis using antibodies against R. sphaeroides ISP showed that H131N, H152N, H131C, and H131C/H151C mutant ICMs had 9, 58, 64, and 98% of the apo-ISP in the wild-type chromatophores, respectively (see Table I). Apparently, the stability of apo-ISP was affected by the type of amino acid substituting for the histidine ligand and whether the alteration was at His-131 or His-152. The finding that the H152N mutant ICM had more apo-ISP than did the H131N mutant membrane was similar to observations in yeast mutants of H161R and H181R (44Graham L.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22485-33492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it differed from reports on mutation at histidine ligands of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in R. capsulatus, in which less than 3% of the apo-ISP was found in the mutant membranes (45Davidson E. Ohnishi T. Tokiti M. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3351-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Table"
https://openalex.org/W2024667274,"Expression of the lactate dehydrogenase A subunit (ldh-A) gene is controlled through transcriptional as well as post-transcriptional mechanisms. Both mechanisms involve activation of protein kinase A (PKA) into its subunits and subsequent phosphorylation and activation of several key regulatory factors. In rat C6 glioma cells, post-transcriptional gene regulation occurs through PKA-mediated stabilization of LDH-A mRNA and subsequent increase of intracellular LDH-A mRNA levels. Previous studies (Tian, D., Huang, D., Short, S., Short, M. L., and Jungmann, R. A. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 24861-24866) have demonstrated a cAMP-stabilizing region (CSR) located in the LDH-A 3′-untranslated region which, in combination with several phosphorylated CSR-binding proteins (CSR-BP), regulates the PKA-mediated stabilization of LDH-A mRNA. However, the mechanistic details of interaction of CSR with proteins as they pertain to mRNA stabilization by PKA are so far largely unknown. In this study we tested the hypothesis that ribosomal protein extracts (RSW) from glioma cells contain PKA regulatory (RII) and catalytic (C) subunits that, in combination with a protein kinase A anchoring protein (AKAP 95) and CSR-BPs participate in forming CSR-protein complexes that are responsible for mRNA stability regulation. To demonstrate the importance of CSR-protein complex formation, the PKA subunits and AKAP 95 were removed from the RSW by immunoprecipitation, and the antigen-deleted RSW were subjected to CSR binding analysis using gel mobility shift and UV cross-linking. It was shown that AKAP 95 as well as RII formed a direct linkage with CSR during CSR-protein complex formation. In contrast, the catalytic subunit formed part of the CSR-protein complex but did not bind to CSR directly in a covalent linkage. To determine whether formation of CSR complexes that included C, RII, and AKAP 95 constituted a functional event and was necessary for mRNA stabilization, cell-free decay reactions were carried out with RSW extracts, and the kinetics of decay of LDH-A mRNA was determined. Depletion of PKA subunits and AKAP 95 from RSW extracts by immunoprecipitation resulted in a marked loss of mRNA stabilization activity indicating that the presence of the PKA regulatory and catalytic subunits as well as AKAP 95 in the CSR-protein complexes was absolutely necessary to achieve LDH-A mRNA stabilization.

Lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) is a tetrameric protein consisting of four subunits of two different types designated the A and B subunits. Genetic evidence shows that they originate from two separate genes located on different chromosomes and are regulated by different molecular mechanisms. The lactate dehydrogenase A subunit (LDH-A) 1The abbreviations used are: LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; 3′-UTR, 3′-untranslated region; CSR, cAMP-stabilizing region; CSR-BP, cAMP-stabilizing region-binding protein; (Sp)-cAMPS, adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate; PKA, protein kinase A; RII, regulatory subunit II of protein kinase A; C, catalytic subunit of protein kinase A; AKAP, PKA-anchoring protein. 1The abbreviations used are: LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; 3′-UTR, 3′-untranslated region; CSR, cAMP-stabilizing region; CSR-BP, cAMP-stabilizing region-binding protein; (Sp)-cAMPS, adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate; PKA, protein kinase A; RII, regulatory subunit II of protein kinase A; C, catalytic subunit of protein kinase A; AKAP, PKA-anchoring protein. gene is a delayed early serum responsive gene whose expression can be modulated at the transcriptional level by a number of effector agents (1Jungmann R.A.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6658-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar), which have no regulatory effects on LDH-B gene expression. The intracellular level of LDH-A mRNA, however, does not entirely reflect the effector agent-induced increased rate of gene transcription (1Jungmann R.A. Kelley D.C. Miles M.F. Milkowski D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5312-5318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), implying that its steady-state level is concomitantly regulated by the ability of cells to modulate LDH-A mRNA stability. Indeed, the relatively short half-life LDH-A mRNA (t½ ≈ 55 min) increases markedly in response to activators of the PKA signal transduction pathway (1Jungmann R.A. Kelley D.C. Miles M.F. Milkowski D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5312-5318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Huang D. Jungmann R.A. Mol.

As a consequence, the cellular isoenzyme pattern is shifted in favor of LDH-5 altering the aerobic/anaerobic metabolic status of cells. Under anaerobic conditions, cells may thus cover a potential energy deficit through an increased conversion of pyruvate to lactate by LDH-5. A number of reports have demonstrated the existence of cis domains primarily in the 3′-UTR of a number of mRNAs as well as trans-acting regulatory factors that act in combination and are critical in mediating post-transcriptional control of gene expression (8Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AU-rich regions and in particular multiple repeats of AUUUA motifs located within the 3′-UTR of mRNA function as elements determining the stability/instability of mRNA of a number of genes (9Caput D. Beutler B. Hartog K. Thayer R. Brown-Shimer S. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1670-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar, 10Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3115) Google Scholar). Moreover, several examples of regulated mRNA stability in eukaryotic cells have been reported indicating that cis/trans-acting factors of the mRNA decay system can be subject to regulation through signal transduction pathways. For instance, LDH-A mRNA, whose stability is regulated via cAMP by PKA (1Jungmann R.A. Kelley D.C. Miles M.F. Milkowski D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5312-5318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), contains a number of U-rich (48%) motifs clustered in a 3′-UTR region (nucleotides 1286-1549) of ∼99 bases (2Matrisian L.M. Rautmann G. Magun B.E. Breathnach R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 711-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 11Tian D. Huang D. Short S. Short M.L. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24861-24866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Mutational and deletion analysis have shown that at least three of the AU-rich sequence domains within this region are responsible for the relatively rapid rate of LDH-A mRNA turnover (11Tian D. Huang D. Short S. Short M.L. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24861-24866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Interestingly, whereas cAMP does not alter the destabilizing action of two of the three domains, one region consisting of bases 1472 through 1501 (cAMP-stabilizing region; CSR) is critically required for cAMP-mediated LDH-A mRNA stabilization (11Tian D. Huang D. Short S. Short M.L. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24861-24866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, for the functional effect of CSR to manifest itself, binding of four proteins (CSR-binding proteins; CSR-BP) is required whose CSR binding and mRNA stabilizing activities require their phosphorylative modification by PKA (12Tian D. Huang D. Brown R.C. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28454-28460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The participation of PKA in the stabilizing events suggests that it may be targeted to specific substrates (such as CSR-BPs) through its interaction with cellular “anchoring proteins” (13Dell'Acqua M.L. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12881-12884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 14Bauman A.L. Scott J.D. Nat.

The experiments described here were designed to identify the potential role of the PKA subunits in CSR-protein complex formation and in the control of LDH-A mRNA stability following PKA activation. Because the mechanism of PKA activation involves dissociation of the holoenzyme into the regulatory and catalytic subunits whose intracellular loci of action may be selected by PKA anchoring protein(s) (AKAP), we additionally investigated a putative interaction of AKAP(s) with CSR and its role in mRNA stabilization. Materials—Nucleic acid-modifying enzymes, acrylamide, and nucleoside triphosphates were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Radiochemicals were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences or ICN Radiochemicals. Other reagents were of molecular biology grade and purchased from Sigma. Adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate, Sp-isomer ((Sp)-cAMPS), was from Calbiochem. Antisera were obtained from Calbiochem or Santa Cruz Biotechnology. AKAP 95 was a rabbit polyclonal IgG prepared from an epitope corresponding to amino acids 542 mapping to an internal region of AKAP 95 of rat origin. Two polyacrylamide-purified synthetic RNA oligonucleotides (wild-type and mutated base sequence 1472-1501) were purchased from Dharmacon Research, Inc. Lafayette, CO. Ht-31 and Ht-31-P were obtained from Promega. Previously Described Experimental Procedures—Cell culture methodology and preparation of protein extracts for the various RNA-protein binding assays were previously described (11Tian D. Huang D. Short S. Short M.L. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24861-24866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Similarly, RNA gel mobility shift assays and UV RNA-protein cross-linking assays were described before (12Tian D. Huang D. Brown R.C. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28454-28460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cell Stimulation—Rat C6 glioma cells (American Type Culture Collection CCL 107) were grown to about 90% confluence. Serum was withdrawn for an 18-h period after which fetal calf serum (final concentration, 15%) was added. Four hours after the addition protein extracts were prepared. Preparation of Purified RII Subunit—RII was purified from glioma cell cytosol by affinity chromatography on 8-(6-aminohexyl)amino-cAMP-Sepharose 4B as described (16Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Leiser M. Rubin C.S. Erlichman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1904-1908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Synthesis of Labeled LDH-A 3′-UTR Transcripts—In the first labeling method, plasmid pLDH-5 containing the 510-nucleotide 3′-untranslated region of LDH-A mRNA (corresponding to nucleotides 1103-1610) (2Matrisian L.M. Rautmann G. Magun B.E. Breathnach R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 711-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) was constructed as previously described (11Tian D. Huang D. Short S. Short M.L. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24861-24866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A NaeI/BsmI fragment containing the entire 3′-UTR region was used for the transcription of a wild-type LDH-A 3′-UTR fragment from the T7 promoter site using the Ambion MAXIscript in vitro transcription kit with biotin as label. To synthesize the LDH-A 3′-UTR fragment containing the mutated bases shown below, a correspondingly mutated NaeI/BsmI fragment was used for transcription. In the second method, a wild-type and mutated 74-base 3′-UTR fragment, consisting of LDH-A mRNA bases 1453-1527 (12Tian D. Huang D. Brown R.C. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28454-28460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), were synthesized with [α-32P]UTP using the Ambion MAXIscript transcription kit as described above. The labeled RNA probes were purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and used for UV/protein cross-linking analysis. The 74-base fragment contained the following 30-base CSR wild-type fragment (bases 1472-1501): 5′-CUACAGGAUAUUUUCUGUAUUAUAUGUGCU- 3′ (bases forming the CSR region are underlined) and mutated fragment: 5′-CUACAGGAUAUUUUgacgAUUAUAUGUGCU-3′ (mutated bases in small print). For gel shift analysis the oligonucleotides were synthesized, 5′-32P-end labeled, and tested for RNA binding activity. For affinity chromatography, the 30-base sequences were synthesized and biotinylated at the 5′ end with an 18-atom spacer arm. The biotinylated fragments were coupled to magnetic beads with conjugated streptavidin (M-280 streptavidin-coupled Dynabeads). Gel Mobility Shift Assays—Cell extracts (5-10 μg of protein) were incubated in RNA binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 40 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 μg/μl of heparin, and 0.5 μg/μl of yeast tRNA) with 32P-labeled RNA probe (bases 1472-1501) (50,000 cpm) on ice for 1 h in a total volume of 25 μl. Electrophoresis was carried out on 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels 1472-1501 (molar ratio of acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 60:1) in 45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, and 1.2 mm EDTA buffer, pH 7.4, for 4 h at 4 °C. Gels were dried and exposed to Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Biosciences) film for autoradiography or to a PhosphorImager plate (Fuji imaging plate, type BAS-III) for quantitation. UV RNA/Protein Cross-Linking—RNA/protein binding reactions were carried out in 96-well tissue culture dishes. The binding conditions were identical as described for the gel mobility shift with the exception that the randomly 32P-labeled wild-type and mutated 74-nucleotide fragments (50,000 cpm) were used as probes. Samples were placed on ice and exposed to 600 mJ of ultraviolet light (5-cm distance for 15 min using a 254-nm ultraviolet lamp, model R-52G, UVP, Inc.). After irradiation, RNase A (0.2 μg/μl) and RNase T1 (40 units/μl) were added, and samples were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The irradiated samples were adjusted to 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol and heated to 90 °C for 2 min. An aliquot was subjected to electrophoresis on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel along with prestained protein molecular size markers (rainbow marker; U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The gels were fixed for 2 h in 50% methanol, followed by 2 h in 10% acetic acid, and 1 h in 5% methanol, 7% acetic acid after which the gels were dried. Gels were exposed to film for autoradiography or to an imaging plate for quantitation as described above. Western Immunoblot Analysis—RSW extracts (20-30 μg of protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blots were processed using the Western Breeze chromogenic or chemiluminescent immunodetection system (Invitrogen) with the appropriate antisera as described in the text following the manufacturer's protocol. Assay of in Vitro mRNA Decay—mRNA decay reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 μl at 37 °C using 5.0 μg/μl of RSW protein in 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.6, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol and equal amounts (160 ng/reaction) of a biotin-labeled LDH-A mRNA fragment (bases 1103-1610). RNA was analyzed after various decay times by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels and subsequently transferred onto BrightStar-Plus nylon membrane. RNA was detected using the nonisotopic chemiluminescent BrightStar BioDetect kit from Ambion. Band density was quantified using the NIH/Image J 1.30v program (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij). The half-life of LDH-A mRNA was calculated by a nonlinear regression analysis of the results using the InPlot program (GraphPAD Software, San Diego, CA). Photoaffinity Labeling of RII with 8-Azido-[32P]cAMP—Photoaffinity labeling was carried out using the procedure of Laks et al. (18Laks M.S. Harrison J.J. Schwoch G. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 87758785Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (final volume, 100 μl) contained 1 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.2, 5 μm 8-azido-[32P]cAMP (50 Ci/mmol), 90 μg of RSW protein or regulatory subunit RIIα in the absence and presence of 20 μm competitor nonradioactive cAMP. The mixture was placed on ice for 60 min in the dark. The incubation was followed by a 10-min irradiation (254 nm) period at a distance of 8.5 cm with a UV lamp (UV Products R-52) rated at 1200 μW/cm2 at a distance of 15 cm. Samples were cooled on ice and unreacted 8-azido-[32P]cAMP was removed by centrifugal filtration on ultra free-MC 0.45-μm Amicon filter units (Millipore). Assay for RII Binding Activity by the Overlay Procedure—The overlay binding assay was performed as described (16Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Leiser M. Rubin C.S. Erlichman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1904-1908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blots were probed with 32P-labeled RII using 5 × 106 cpm of 32P radioactivity/ml and RII-binding proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Affinity Purification of CSR-binding Proteins—5′-Biotinylated 30-base wild-type and mutated CSR with an 18-atom spacer arm were linked to magnetic M-280 streptavidin-coupled Dynabeads according to the instructions given in the Dynal Technical Handbook (Dynal Biotech). To remove most of the nonspecifically binding proteins, RSW extracts were first incubated with beads carrying mutated CSR in Hepes buffer (150 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on a rotary shaker for 1 h at 20 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation. The supernatant fraction was subsequently similarly incubated with beads carrying the wild-type CSR. To reduce nonspecific binding, 0.5 μg/0.25 μl of poly(A) were added to the incubation mixture. After incubation beads were washed three times with incubation buffer. CSR-binding proteins were subsequently dissociated from the bead-linked CSR with high-salt buffer (incubation buffer containing 0.4 m potassium acetate). Identification of the Catalytic and Regulatory RII Subunit of PKA as Components of the CSR-Protein Binding Complex—We have recently identified a 30-nucleotide base CSR (nucleotides 1472 through 1501) within the 3′-UTR of LDH-A mRNA, which in combination with four as yet uncharacterized 96-, 67-, 52-, and 50-kDa CSR-BP is required to achieve LDH-A stabilization in response to PKA activation (11Tian D. Huang D. Short S. Short M.L. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24861-24866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 12Tian D. Huang D. Brown R.C. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28454-28460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As part of this process, CSR together with CSR-BP forms multiple ribonucleoprotein complexes whose formation requires a reversible phosphorylation cycle involving PKA and as yet unknown protein phosphatases. The precise mechanism of participation of PKA in complex formation is unknown. One can speculate that based on a size comparison the regulatory subunit RII might be identical with either one or the other of the 52- or 50-kDa CSR-BPs. Thus, it is conceivable that the catalytic and RII subunits of PKA may also participate, in concert with other proteins, in the formation of functional CSR-multiple protein complexes that modulate mRNA stability. First, to ascertain the presence of RIIα in glioma cell RSW extracts, we probed the extracts by photoaffinity labeling with 8-azido-[32P]cAMP. The resulting data confirm the presence of regulatory subunit RII by photoaffinity labeling (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2). The specificity of RII photoaffinity labeling was demonstrated by the competition of radioactive label with nonradioactive cAMP (lane 3) and lack of 32P labeling after deletion of RII from RSW by immunoprecipitation (lane 4). Immunoprecipitated RII extracted from protein A-agarose could successfully be photoaffinity-labeled demonstrating the efficiency of immunoprecipitation and presence of RII in the RSW extract (lane 5). To investigate the presence of PKA subunits in CSR-multiprotein complexes and to identify a potential direct binding of the subunits RII and C to CSR, we carried out electrophoretic band-shift analysis and UV cross-linking assays as described in a previous publication (12Tian D. Huang D. Brown R.C. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol.

For gel shift, the labeled fragments were incubated with RSW extracts prepared from untreated and (Sp)-cAMPS-treated cells and subjected to nondenaturing electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 2A (lanes 2 and 3), incubation of both extracts gave a positive gel shift resulting in two protein complexes of different mobility (arrows 2 and 3). The intensity of the shifted bands was slightly increased in the RSW extract from (Sp)-cAMPS-treated cells (lane 3). Moreover, an additional complex of slower mobility can be identified in the extract (lane 3, arrow 1). Whereas the above studies allowed us to identify the presence of RSW proteins that exhibit binding affinity for CSR, it is necessary to ascertain the specificity of CSR-protein complex formation. In detailed previous studies (not shown here but see Ref. 12Tian D. Huang D. Brown R.C. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28454-28460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) that identified four CSR-BPs in RSW, we allowed complexes to form in the presence of a 32P-labeled CSR probe and different unlabeled nonspecific competitor LDH mRNA fragments. Under these conditions, 32P-CSR-protein complex formation was competitively eliminated by increasing molar concentrations of unlabeled CSR but not by nonspecific unlabeled RNA fragments indicating the specificity of complex formation of CSR to four RSW proteins. To test whether the catalytic subunit was required for complex formation, we incubated the extracts from (Sp)-cAMPS-treated cells with anti-PKA catalytic Cγ antibody. Following removal of the immunoprecipitate with protein A-agarose, the subunit-depleted cell extract was examined for CSR-protein complex formation by gel mobility shift. Under these conditions, formation of the three CSR-protein complexes was markedly reduced (Fig. 2A, lane 4). Incubation of [32P]CSR with a preincubated combination of highly purified C and RII subunits in the absence of RSW and (Sp)-cAMPS did not produce shifted band(s) (lane 5) indicating the lack of direct binding affinity of catalytically inactive PKA holoenzyme for the CSR. The need for active PKA C subunit was convincingly confirmed by the fact that addition of C to the C-depleted RSW partially restored at least two of the faster moving CSR/protein complexes (Fig. 2A, lane 7). The slower moving complex (arrow 1) was not restored suggesting the need of an as yet unknown auxiliary component for complex formation to occur. Furthermore, in several gel shift experiments we tested the specificity of the observed CSR-protein complex formations and immunodepletion experiments. To that effect we incubated [32P]CSR with 7 units of C subunit in the absence of RSW (lane 6) and with preimmune serum alone (lane 8). In neither experiment could CSR-protein complexes be identified. In contrast, incubation of [32P]CSR with preimmune serum in the presence of RSW from unstimulated or (Sp)-cAMPS-treated cells allowed identification of the CSR-protein complexes as shown in lanes 2 and 3. These experiments clearly show the specificity of the immunodepletion reactions and identify a selectivity of CSR-protein complex formation. A similar pattern of CSR-protein complex formation was obtained when the binding characteristics of the regulatory subunit RIIα were examined by gel shift analysis. The typical band shift patterns seen in Fig. 2A were also observed with RSW from untreated and (Sp)-cAMPS-treated cells (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3). After treatment of RSW extract from (Sp)-cAMPS-stimulated cells with anti-RIIα, antiserum and protein A-agarose complex formation was markedly reduced (lane 4) indicating that RII was required for complex formation. Addition of 0.5 μg of purified RIIα to the RIIα-depleted RSW restored two of the faster migrating complexes (lane 5, arrows 2 and 3) but not the slowest moving one (arrow 1) similar to the restored banding pattern in Fig. 2A (lane 7) suggesting that this complex contains a component that is required for its formation with RII and C but is removed by immunoprecipitation and cannot be restored by addition of either subunit to the immunodepleted RSW. Incubation of RII with CSR in the absence of RSW did not result in complex formation (lane 6) showing that the regulatory subunit RII itself exhibits no direct binding affinity for CSR as analyzed by gel shift. It is, nevertheless, part of and required for CSR-protein complex formation conceivably mediated through interaction with protein(s) that bind directly to CSR. As we discuss below, a PKA anchoring protein required for complexing RII (and C) to CSR might be removed from the extract by immunoprecipitation together with the subunits. Our failure to identify by gel shift a direct binding of the subunits to CSR raises the question whether the use of different methodology, e.g. UV cross-linking, which results in a covalent linkage might be successfully applied to demonstrate direct linkage of the subunits to CSR. Covalently linked RNA-protein complexes can be formed by irradiation of cell extracts with UV light (19Greenberg J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 5685-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Using competition assays, we previously demonstrated that the technique can be applied with great specificity to the study of CSR/protein interaction (12Tian D. Huang D. Brown R.C. Jungmann R.A. J.

To determine whether either the RII and/or C subunit could be linked to the CSR base sequence, we performed a series of experiments similar to the ones previously described (12Tian D. Huang D.

Nonetheless, they have not been detected unesterified in the free form, presumably because of their marked reactivity. A2/J2-IsoPs, similar to other electrophilic lipids such as 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 and 4-hydroxynonenal, contain a highly reactive α,β-unsaturated carbonyl, which allows these compounds to react with thiol-containing biomolecules to produce a range of biological effects. We sought to identify and characterize in rats the major urinary metabolite of 15-A2t-IsoP, one of the most abundant A2-IsoPs produced in vivo, in order to develop a specific biomarker that can be used to quantify the in vivo production of these molecules. Following intravenous administration of 15-A2t-IsoP containing small amounts of [3H4]15-A2t-IsoP, 80% of the radioactivity excreted in the urine remained in aqueous solution after extraction with organic solvents, indicating the formation of a polar conjugate(s). Using high pressure liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, the major urinary metabolite of 15-A2t-IsoP was determined to be the mercapturic acid sulfoxide conjugate in which the carbonyl at C9 was reduced to an alcohol. The structure was confirmed by direct comparison to a synthesized standard and via various chemical derivatizations. In addition, this metabolite was found to be formed in significant quantities in urine from rats exposed to an oxidant stress. The identification of this metabolite combined with the finding that these metabolites are produced in in vivo settings of oxidant stress makes it possible to use this method to quantify, for the first time, the in vivo production of cyclopentenone prostanoids."

Subsequently, in the α1 GlyR a single mutation has also been identified that converts the selectivity of this channel (19Galzi J.L. Devillers-Thiery A. Hussy N. Bertrand S. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D. Nature. 1992; 359: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar).MOD-1 offered an advantage to test the basis for anion selectivity over previously studied LGICs because it is a homomeric receptor of identical subunits (1Ranganathan R. Cannon S.C. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 2000; 408: 470-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We analyzed the basis for ionic selectivity of MOD-1 using different mutants that explored the roles of the extra- and intra-cellular rings of charge. A minimal substation sufficient to convert the selectivity from anionic to cationic was identified at A270E. In addition, we also demonstrated that in MOD-1 the triplet of mutations not only induced a conversion in charge selectivity but also gave rise to a highly K+-selective channel (Fig. 1).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSite-directed Mutagenesis—Complementary DNA encoding the wild type (WT) MOD-1 was subcloned into the pGEMHE expression vector (22Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Site-directed point mutations were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed PCR mutagenesis using Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene). The mutations were confirmed by sequencing with at least two different primers.Expression in Vitro—-For transcription, the expression construct was first linearized by PST1. RNA transcripts encoding MOD-1 and mutants were synthesized from linearized constructs using the T7 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The quality of RNA was confirmed by agarose gel analysis. Stage V oocytes were removed from adult female Xenopus laevis frogs and prepared as described previously (23Goldin A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 487-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Oocytes were incubated in ND-96 medium that consisted of 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml gentamycin and 0.55 mg/ml pyruvate. RNA encoding WT or mutant versions of the MOD-1 channel was injected at ∼50 ng/oocyte. Oocytes were incubated at 18 °C for >24hin ND-96 medium before voltage clamp experiments.Two-electrode Recordings—Oocytes were placed in the recess of a small chamber and continuously superfused by gravity-driven flow (10 ml/min) with control or test solutions selected by computer-controlled solenoid valves (ALA-VM8; ALA Instruments). Currents activated by 5-HT were recorded from oocytes using a two-electrode voltage clamp (Warner OC-725C). Electrodes were made from borosilicate glass, pulled with a Sutter P-87 puller, and filled with a filtered 3 m KCl solution. All experiments were performed at room temperature.The reversal potential (Erev) was measured by continuously recording the membrane current as the voltage was ramped from –70 mV to +50 mV over 50 ms and then back again. This triangular voltage stimulus was applied repeatedly as the agonist (1 μm 5-HT) was washed over the oocytes. Ligand-activated channel opening results in more current flow whenever the membrane potential is away from its reversal value. Thus the Erev of 5-HT-activated channels was readily apparent from a superposition of current responses before and after the application of 5-HT. The data in Figs. 2 and 3 show MOD-1-specific currents, computed by subtracting the total current recorded before application of 5-HT. Ionic selectivity was determined by measuring shifts in Erev as the anionic composition of the bath was altered. Bath solutions contained 100 mm of the test ions (NaCl, KCl, choline chloride, or sodium gluconate) plus 0.2 mm calcium gluconate and 5 mm HEPES. The relative permeability of two cations, a and b (or two anions), was estimated from the shift in the reversal potential according to the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation shown here as Equation 1,PbPa=[a]o[b]oexp{FRT(Erev b−Erev a)}eq.1 where R, T, and F have their usual meaning, Erev a is the reversal potential obtained with external solution a, and Erev b is obtained with solution b. This computation assumes that the permeability of the counter ion to a or b is negligible.Fig. 2Current-voltage relationship for WT MOD-1.Traces show individual responses recorded during voltage ramps from –70 to +50 mV in different external bath solutions. For each trace, the background current recorded in the absence of agonist was subtracted from the response in the presence of 1 μm 5-HT.

The peak current was measured in response to brief (5 s) applications of 5-HT beginning at 0.03 μm, followed by a 5-min wash and then subsequent test concentrations up to 1 μm. Complete recovery from desensitization was verified by repeating the measurement at 1 μm after a 20-min wash. Finally, a single response at 3, 10, or 30 μm 5-HT was measured, but no additional concentrations could be tested because of desensitization. The responses for each egg were normalized to an amplitude of 1 at a 5-HT concentration of 1 μm. Equation 2, shown here,I=Imax([5−HT]/([5−HT]+EC50))eq.2 was fitted with normalized data pooled from multiple eggs. Finally, the data were renormalized by dividing by Imax to generate the amplitude-normalized curves shown in Fig. 5. Data were analyzed using Clampfit (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and Origin (MicroCal, Northampton, MA), and all parameter estimates are given as the mean ± S.E. for n independent experiments.RESULTSDeterminants of Ionic Selectivity for MOD-1 Are Conserved Among the LGIC Family Members—WT MOD-1 and the mutants were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and characterized by recording 5-HT-gated whole-cell current in a two-electrode voltage clamp. To compare the ionic selectivity of the WT and mutant receptors, we measured current-voltage relationships in a number of different extracellular solutions, namely 100 mm NaCl, KCl, sodium gluconate, choline chloride, and, for mutant 3, N-methyl-d-glucamine. Sample traces illustrating current-voltage relations for WT MOD-1 channels in 100 mm external NaCl, KCl, choline chloride, and sodium gluconate are shown in Fig. 2. The mean and S.E. of the Erev values measured in these four different external solutions are given in Table II. The changes in Erev demonstrate that MOD-1 is a chloride-permeant anion channel. The reversal potential of WT MOD-1 was relatively insensitive to the external cation; Erev was –27.5 ± 1.1 mV (n = 11) for NaCl, –31.9 ± 2.1 mV (n = 11) for KCl, and –24.3 ± 2.1 mV (n = 11) for choline chloride. All of these values nearly matched the typical equilibrium potential for Cl in oocytes of about –25 mV in 100 mm external Cl–. In contrast, switching from NaCl to sodium gluconate shifted Erev by +66 mV. The interpretation is that MOD-1 is much more permeable to Cl– than gluconate (20Keramidas A. Moorhouse A.J. Pierce K.D.

Galzi et al. (19Galzi J.L. Devillers-Thiery A. Hussy N. Bertrand S. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D. Nature. 1992; 359: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) showed that a triplet of mutations (Fig. 1) is required to change the selectivity of the α7 nAChR channel from cationic to anionic. We tested the hypothesis that the inverse mutation in the anion-selective channel MOD-1 will convert this channel into a cation-selective one. Fig. 3 shows I-V relationships measured for the selectivity triple mutant (mutant 1) using different external solutions, and the mean Erev values are listed in Table II. As expected, mutation 1 converted the selectivity from an anionic to a cationic channel. Quite unexpectedly, however, mutant 1 was highly selective for K+ over other cations (Fig. 3). The reversal potential was insensitive to an extracellular anion (Erev for NaCl was –68.8 ± 1.8 mV, n = 8; for sodium gluconate Erev was –70.4 ± 1.4 mV, n = 8) and remained near –70 mV for sodium or choline used as the cation, but it shifted to –6.0 ± 1.1 mV (n = 8) for KCl. Based on this 70-mV shift in Erev, the relative permeability for PK+/PNa+ or PK+/Pcholine is 12:1. This observation was surprising, because the comparable mutation in GlyR channels results in a cation non-selective channel (25Keramidas A. Moorhouse A.J. French C.R. Schofield P.R. Barry P.H. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 247-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Table IIonic selectivity of chimeric mutations in the MOD-1 M2 segment Open table in a new tab As has been observed in other LIGCs (15Imoto K.

Schmieden V. Bormann J. Betz H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4223-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), the internal and external rings of charge were not primary determinants of cation versus anion permeability. Mutant MOD-1 receptors in which the positively charged lysine in the inner ring was replaced by negatively charged aspartate remained anion-permeant and impermeant to cations (Fig. 3, Mutant 6). One difference from WT channels was that the Erev in sodium gluconate was more positive by 15 mV (Table II), which implies that the selectivity for chlorine over gluconate is increased in mutant 6. The external ring of charge in MOD-1 is positive because of Lys-292, whereas in cation-selective channels this residue is negative (Asp or Glu; Fig. 1). The introduction of a negative charge in the external ring of MOD-1 (K292D, mutant 7) did not change the selectivity from anion to cation. The reversal potentials remained relatively insensitive to external cations, whereas for anions switching from NaCl to sodium gluconate the Erev shifted by +90 mV (Table II). Thus, in comparison to WT, replacing the positive charge in either the inner (mutant 6) or the outer (mutant 7) ring by inserting a negative aspartate residue increases the selectivity for chlorine over gluconate. The permeability ratio for PCl–/PGluc is 12 for WT, 30 for mutant 6, and 34 for mutant 7.A Minimal Set of Mutations for Determining Anion/Cation Selectivity—Mutational studies of nAChR channels identified a triplet of substitutions required to convert selectivity from cationic to anionic (19Galzi J.L. Devillers-Thiery A. Hussy N. Bertrand S. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D. Nature. 1992; 359: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). More recently, Keramidas et al. have shown in the GlyR that part of this triplet, a single Ala-to-Glu mutation in the intermediate ring of charge in M2, is sufficient to change selectivity from anionic to cationic (20Keramidas A. Moorhouse A.J. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. Barry P.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We constructed subsets of the selectivity triple mutant (mutants 2, 3, 4, and 5 in Table I) to look for the minimal set of residues in MOD-1 required to determine anion/cation selectivity. First, we eliminated the polar to hydrophobic change of the triple mutant. The resulting double mutant at the intermediate ring (ΔPro-269/A270E, mutant 2 in Table I) was cation-permeant but, unlike the triple selectivity mutant, was not K+-selective (Fig. 3). The modest 7-mV shift of Erev in switching from NaCl to sodium gluconate shows that the permeability to chlorine is relatively low. Conversely, the –36 mV shift of Erev from NaCl to choline chloride demonstrates substantial sodium permeability. Mutant 2 does not strongly discriminate cations tested in these experiments, and the Erev values show a permeability sequence of potassium ≈ sodium > choline. We interpret these data as evidence that mutant 2 is a non-selective cation channel. The complementary mutation, wherein Pro-269 and Ala-270 remained unchanged but the third element of the triple selectivity mutant (T284V) was studied in isolation, did not alter the ionic selectivity from that of WT MOD-1 channels (mutant 5; Table II).Differences in the intermediate ring of charge between anion-permeant and cation-permeant LGICs are totally conserved. In MOD-1 and all other anion permeant channels, a PA occurs at this ring (Fig. 1). For cation-permeant LGICs the proline is absent and Ala is replaced by Glu. Deletion of this proline alone in MOD-1 (mutant 4) resulted in nonfunctional channels with no detectable 5-HT-activated current. The charge substitution alone, A270E (mutant 3), produced a cation-permeant channel as demonstrated by a negative Erev of –38.5 ± 0.2 mV (n = 2) in a N-methyl-d-glucamine bath. Mutant 3 did not discriminate between Na+ and K+ and was only modestly less permeant to choline (Table II).Mutations in the M2 Selectivity Filter Affect Gating but Not Ligand Sensitivity—The view that ion channels are built from modular assemblies of ion-conducting and channel-gating domains is a useful first approximation, but detailed examination of channel function or a mutational analysis often show interactions between permeation and gating. Therefore, we examined the macroscopic current kinetics and sensitivity to 5-HT of the different mutants. Representative examples of currents recorded in response to prolonged application of 1 μm 5-HT are shown in Fig. 4. MOD-1 rapidly desensitized under these conditions, whereas the cation-permeant mutants desensitized more slowly and with a single exponential decay (Fig. 4). Quite remarkably, the single Ala-to-Glu mutation in the inner ring (the minimal change sufficient to convert MOD-1 to cation-permeant) produced a non-desensitizing receptor. No decay in 5-HT-activated current was detected even after 20 min (Fig. 4). For each of these mutations that slowed desensitization, the rate of activation appeared to be slowed as well (Fig. 4); but this measurement was limited by the sluggishness of whole-oocyte perfusion. Mutations in the inner or outer rings of charge did not affect the desensitization rate. When either of these Lys residues in MOD-1 was mutated to Asp (mutants 6 and 7), the 5-HT activated current rapidly desensitized, similarly to WT. The EC50 values for mutant channels were within a factor of 3, higher or lower, than that of WT channels (Table I) and did not show a pattern between change in selectivity and relative change in EC50.Fig. 4Alterations in gating produced by mutations in the M2 segment.A, traces show individual currents elicited by 1 μm 5-HT applied under continuous flow for several minutes to oocytes clamped at –70 mV. WT MOD-1 channels have biphasic rapid and slowly desensitizing components. The triple selectivity mutant (mutant 1) lacks a rapidly desensitizing component. The minimal mutation to convert MOD-1 to cation-selective, A270E (mutant 3), does not desensitize in 1 μm 5-HT, and mutant 7 shows a slow desensitizing component.

Wang F. Nakai J. Mishina M. Numa S. Sakmann B. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1991; 244: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The organic cation permeability has been demonstrated to be dependent on the size and charge of these residues (29Wang F. Imoto K. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1992; 250: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and, furthermore, an adjacent ring of polar amino acids affected the monovalent cation permeation (30Villarroel A. Herlitze S.

J. 1992; 62: 196-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The relation between gating and accessibility to M2 residues in the aqueous inner vestibule of the pore has been demonstrated by cysteine-scanning mutagenesis coupled with cross-linking by thiol reagents (27Wilson G.G. Karlin A. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1269-1281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 28Pascual J.M. Karlin A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 717-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).In more recent work on the focus of cation/anion selectivity, Keramidas et al. (20Keramidas A. Moorhouse A.J. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. Barry P.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) demonstrated that introducing both a negative charge (mutation A251E) and a conformational change to displace the positively charged residue Arg-252 caused primarily by the Pro-250 deletion in this constricted region was required to induce a selectivity change in the GlyR and that even the T265V mutation may not be required. The A270E mutation was enough to convert the selectivity of the GlyR, suggesting that the introduced negatively charged glutamic acid residue overrode the adjacent positively charged arginine and confirming the relevance of the electrostatic effect in charge selectivity. In our experiments we showed that, like the GlyR, the charge selectivity conversion was achieved by mutations made in the intermediate ring of the MOD-1R. Our results demonstrated that two adjacent point mutations (ΔPro-269 and A270E) produced a channel selective for cations. The proline residue had been shown to be implicated in local geometrical change to the pore constriction in the α7 nAChR triple mutant (19Galzi J.L. Devillers-Thiery A. Hussy N. Bertrand S. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D. Nature. 1992; 359: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 24Cohen B.N. Labarca C. Czyzyk L. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 99: 545-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or in WT GlyR (32Saul B. Kuner T. Sobetzko D. Brune W. Hanefeld F. Meinck H.M. Becker C.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 869-877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We thus can hypothesize that the deletion of this residue has induced modifications in the pore region at the conducting state level of the channel. Cation permeation should be provided by a suitable electrical potential and geometric environment, allowing the substituted glutamate (Ala-270) to be exposed to cationic ions (19Galzi J.L. Devillers-Thiery A. Hussy N. Bertrand S. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D. Nature. 1992; 359: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Because the single mutation A270E produced a cation selective channel but the P269D failed to form functional channels, we can conclude that electrostatic properties and pore geometry are mainly responsible for the conversion of selectivity. The introduction of a negatively charged residue (A270E) is also necessary for obtaining a functional cationic channel.The mutant 3 was a cationic non-selective channel for small cation ions. More precisely, we noticed that the selectivity was higher for"
