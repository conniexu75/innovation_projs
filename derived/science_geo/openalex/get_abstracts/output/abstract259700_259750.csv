https://openalex.org/W1966116761,"Cellular expression of Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, is tightly regulated. Recently, Bcl-2 expression was shown to be regulated by microRNAs, small endogenous RNA molecules that regulate protein expression through sequence-specific interaction with messenger RNA. By analogy, we reasoned that Mcl-1 expression may also be regulated by microRNAs. We chose human immortalized, but non-malignant, H69 cholangiocyte and malignant KMCH cholangiocarcinoma cell lines for these studies, because Mcl-1 is dysregulated in cells with the malignant phenotype. By in silico analysis, we identified a putative target site in the Mcl-1 mRNA for the mir-29 family, and found that mir-29b was highly expressed in cholangiocytes. Interestingly, mir-29b was downregulated in malignant cells, consistent with Mcl-1 protein upregulation. Enforced mir-29b expression reduced Mcl-1 protein expression in KMCH cells. This effect was direct, as mir-29b negatively regulated the expression of an Mcl-1 3' untranslated region (UTR)-based reporter construct. Enforced mir-29b expression reduced Mcl-1 cellular protein levels and sensitized the cancer cells to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) cytotoxicity. Transfection of non-malignant cells (that express high levels of mir-29) with a locked-nucleic acid antagonist of mir-29b increased Mcl-1 levels and reduced TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Thus mir-29 is an endogenous regulator of Mcl-1 protein expression, and thereby, apoptosis."

We identified seven risk variants, five of them previously undescribed, spanning 430 kb and each independently predicting risk for prostate cancer (P = 7.9 x 10(-19) for the strongest association, and P < 1.5 x 10(-4) for five of the variants, after controlling for each of the others). The variants define common genotypes that span a more than fivefold range of susceptibility to cancer in some populations. None of the prostate cancer risk variants aligns to a known gene or alters the coding sequence of an encoded protein."
https://openalex.org/W2038582574,"NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) regulates expression and coordinated induction of a battery of chemoprotective genes in response to oxidative and electrophilic stress. This leads to protection against oxidative stress and neoplastic diseases. Nuclear import and export of Nrf2 play a significant role in control of nuclear levels of Nrf2 and thus the expression of Nrf2 down-stream genes. Tyrosine kinase Fyn phosphorylates tyrosine 568 of Nrf2 that leads to the nuclear export of Nrf2. In this study, we investigated the upstream factor(s) in regulation of Fyn and Fyn-mediated nuclear export of Nrf2. The investigations shed light on a novel mechanism of Nrf2 regulation in response to oxidative stress. We demonstrate that GSK-3β acts upstream of Fyn kinase in control of nuclear export of Nrf2. Chemical and short interfering RNA-mediated inhibition of GSK-3β led to nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 and transcriptional activation of the Nrf2 downstream gene nqo1. Chemical and short interfering RNA inhibition of GSK-3β and Fyn individually and in combination revealed that both kinases follow the same pathway to regulate nuclear export of Nrf2. We further demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide phosphorylates tyrosine 216 of GSK-3β. This leads to activation of GSK-3β. The activated GSK-3β phosphorylates Fyn at threonine residue(s). Phosphorylated Fyn accumulates in the nucleus and phosphorylates Nrf2 at tyrosine 568. This leads to nuclear export, ubiquitination, and degradation of Nrf2.

Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1199-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). This induction involves a mechanism essential for cellular protection against oxidative and electrophilic stress and neoplastic diseases (1.Jaiswal A.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1199-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). Nrf2-null mice are born normal and viable, indicating that Nrf2 is not required for development and growth of mice (2.Chan K. Lu R. Chang J.C. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13943-13948Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Nrf2-null mice express significantly lower levels and no induction of chemoprotective proteins that include NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), glutathione S-transferase Ya subunit (GST-Ya), γ-glutamylcysteinyl synthetase, and heme oxygenase (HO-1) (1.Jaiswal A.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1199-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). These mice demonstrate slower wound healing and pulmonary emphysema in response to exposure to tobacco smoke (3.Braun S. Hanselmann C. Gassmann M.G. auf dem Keller U. Born-Berclaz C. Chan K. Kan Y.W.

Investig. 2004; 114: 1248-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar).A cytosolic inhibitor of Nrf2, INrf2 (inhibitor of Nrf2) or Keap1, retains Nrf2 in the cytoplasm (5.Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2714) Google Scholar, 6.Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The INrf2-Nrf2 complex serves as cellular sensor of oxidative and electrophilic stress (1.Jaiswal A.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1199-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). The cellular exposure to oxidants, antioxidants, and radiations antagonizes this interaction and leads to the release of Nrf2 from INrf2 (1.Jaiswal A.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1199-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). Nrf2 translocates into the nucleus and induces the expression of chemoprotective proteins. Electrophilic adduction of selected cysteines in INrf2 and PKC phosphorylation of Nrf2 are known to contribute to the release of Nrf2 from INrf2 (1.Jaiswal A.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1199-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). Disruption of INrf2 in mice leads to postnatal death, probably from malnutrition resulting from hyperkeratosis in the esophagus and forestomach, presumably because of excessive nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 (7.Wakabayashi N. Itoh K. Wakabayashi J. Motohashi H. Noda S. Takahashi S. Imakado S. Kotsuji T. Otsuka F. Roop D.R. Harada T. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Therefore, sustained nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 is lethal to the cells. Indeed, longer retention of Nrf2 in the nucleus leads to apoptotic cell death (8.Strachan G.D. Ostrow L.A. Jordan-Sciutto K.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 336: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).The abundance of Nrf2 inside the nucleus is tightly regulated by positive and negative factors that control nuclear import, binding to ARE, export, and degradation of Nrf2 under normal and stress (chemical/radiation) conditions (9.Bloom D.A.

The early response to stress leads to nuclear import of Nrf2 resulting in coordinated activation of chemoprotective genes. The delayed response to stress is Fyn-mediated phosphorylation of Nrf2Y568 inside the nucleus (13.Jain A.K. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12132-12142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Tyrosine 568 phosphorylation leads to nuclear export of Nrf2 (13.Jain A.K. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12132-12142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, upstream events that control signal transduction from oxidative and electrophilic stress to Fyn that phosphorylates Nrf2Y568 leading to nuclear export of Nrf2 remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the upstream factors that regulate Fyn and nuclear export and degradation of Nrf2.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstruction of Plasmids−The construction of pGL2B-NQO1-ARE and pcDNA-Nrf2 has been described previously (14.Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40134-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The construction of pcDNA-Nrf2-V5, pcDNA-Nrf2Y568A-V5, and pCMV-FLAG-mINrf2 was also described previously (11.Jain A.K. Bloom D.A. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29158-29168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Modified pCMV vectors were used to clone the FLAG-tagged Fyn protein. Mouse Fyn cDNA was amplified from the IMAGE clone obtained from ATCC using the following primers: forward 5′-GCGCTCTAGAGAATTCGTCGAGACCATGGGCTGTGTG-3′ and reverse 5′-CGCGGATCCGATATCCAGGTTTTCACCAGGTTGGTA-3′. The PCR-amplified DNA contained XbaI and BamHI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ end, respectively. The amplified DNA was digested with XbaI and BamHI and subcloned into the FLAG vector digested with similar enzymes. The resultant plasmid was designated as pCMV-FLAG-mFyn. The pCMV-HA-Ub was received as a generous gift from Dr, Shigeki Miyamoto (Department of Pharmacology, University of Wisconsin Medical School).Cell Culture, Co-transfection of Expression Plasmids, and Luciferase Reporter Assay−Human hepatoma (HepG2) cells were grown in monolayer cultures in 6-well plates in minimum essential medium-α supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections were done in cells grown to ∼50% confluence using the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Cells were co-transfected with 0.2 μg of reporter construct (human NQO1-ARE-Luc) and 10 times less quantities of firefly Renilla luciferase encoded by plasmid pRL-TK. Renilla luciferase was used as the internal control in each transfection. To analyze the effect of GSK-3β inhibitors on NQO1-ARE activity, the transfected cells were treated for 12 h with the indicated inhibitor (lithium chloride or TDZD-8 or PP2) in the concentrations as indicated in the figures. Lithium chloride was purchased from Sigma, and TDZD-8 and PP2 were purchased from Calbiochem and were the highest purity available. After the treatment for the specified times, the cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1× Passive lysis buffer from the Dual-Luciferase® reporter assay system kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The luciferase activity was measured using the procedures described previously (15.Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jain A.K. Bloom D.A. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16891-16900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar).siRNA Transfection−Mouse GSK-3β siRNA, Fyn siRNA, and Lamin A/C siRNA (control) were purchased from Dharmacon and were transfected using Lipofectamine transfection reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. For luciferase assay, mouse Hepa-1 cells were co-transfected with 0.2 μg of reporter construct (human NQO1-ARE-Luc) and 10 times less quantities of firefly Renilla luciferase encoded by plasmid pRL-TK as described above along with the indicated amounts of GSK-3β or Fyn siRNA. The luciferase analysis was done as described above. For Western analysis, Hepa-1 cells in 100-mm plates were transfected with siRNA in different doses, and subcellular fractionation and immunoblotting were done as described below.Subcellular Fractionation and Western Blotting−HepG2/Hepa1 cells, seeded in 100-mm plates and treated/transfected as displayed in the figures, were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in phosphate-buffered saline using a rubber policeman, and centrifuged at 500 rpm for 5 min. Biochemical fractionation of the cells was done using the nuclear extract kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. For making total cell lysate, the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm sodium vanadate supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures I and II (Sigma)). The protein concentration was determined using the protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). 100 μg of total cell lysate or cytosolic or nuclear fractions were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, Western-blotted, and probed with anti-Nrf2 antibody, anti-Fyn antibody (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-GSK-3β antibody (Cell Signaling), anti-Tyr(P)-GSK-3 antibody (BIOSOURCE), anti-FLAG-HRP antibody (Sigma), or anti-NQO1 antibody (11.Jain A.K. Bloom D.A. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29158-29168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To confirm the purity of subcellular fractionations, the extracts were Western-blotted with cytoplasm-specific anti-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) and nuclear specific anti-Lamin B antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The levels of protein on a Western blot were quantitated by using QuantityOne Image software (ChemiDoc XRS, Bio-Rad) and normalized against proper loading controls.RT-PCR−RNA was prepared from Hepa-1 cells transfected with GSK-3β siRNA or treated with LiCl using “RNeasy mini kit” (Qiagen). 100 ng of RNA was used for amplification in an RT-PCR using the “Superscript One-step RT-PCR kit” (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The primers used were as follows: Nrf2 forward 5′-GAGATGAGCTTAGGGC-3′, Nrf2 reverse 5′-GTTTTTCTTTGTATCTGGCTTCTTG-3′; NQO-1 forward 5′-ATGGCGGCGAGAAGAGCCCTG-3′, NQO1 reverse 5′-TTATTTTCTAGCTTTGATCTGGTTGTC-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase forward 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reverse 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′. The amplified products were analyzed by resolving on a 2% agarose gel.Phosphorylation Analysis−HepG2 cells were seeded in 100-mm plates and transfected with 0.5 μg of pCMV-FLAG-mFyn plasmid. 24 h after transfection, the cells were pretreated with LiCl/PP2 for 8 h followed by treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) ± LiCl/PP2 for 1 and 4 h. At the end of treatment, the cells were harvested, and biochemical fractionation was done following the procedures described above. To analyze tyrosine phosphorylation of GSK-3β, 100 μg of total cell lysate was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with phosphospecific (Tyr(P))-GSK-3 antibody (BIOSOURCE). The same membrane was reprobed with anti-GSK-3β and anti-β-actin antibodies. To analyze the Fyn phosphorylation, 1 mg of nuclear extract was used to immunoprecipitate either with anti-Thr(P) antibody (Cell Signaling) or anti-FLAGM2 beads (Sigma). Briefly, nuclear extract supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) was incubated with 2.5 μg of antibody overnight at 4 °C with shaking. 40 μl of washed protein A beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with shaking. The slurry was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 s, and the supernatant was discarded. The beads were washed twice with RIPA buffer. 25 μl of SDS sample dye was added to the beads and boiled, and immunoprecipitates were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by immunoblotting with anti-Ser(P) or anti-FLAG-HRP antibody.In Vitro Kinase Assay−Purified GSK-3β, phospho-GSK-3 peptide, and Fyn kinase were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. His-Nrf2 was purified from bacterial lysates using His-Trap columns (GE Healthcare). 100 ng of GSK-3 peptide, Fyn kinase, or His-Nrf2 were incubated with active GSK-3β in the kinase assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm ATP, and 1.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) for 30 min at 30 °C. Phospho-GSK-3 peptide (3 kDa) was used as a positive control for in vitro GSK-3β kinase reaction. Reaction was stopped by adding 2× SDS-gel loading dye followed by boiling for 5 min. The samples were then resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by autoradiography.Ubiquitination of Nrf2−HepG2 cells were seeded in 100-mm plates and co-transfected either with pcDNA-Nrf2-V5 (1.0 μg), pCMV-HA-Ub (0.5 μg), or pCMV-FLAG-mINrf2 (0.25 μg) in different combinations as indicated in the figure. The transfected cells were treated with either Me2SO or 50 mm GSK-3β inhibitor LiCl or 20 μm proteasomal inhibitor MG132 for 5 h. The cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, and 100 μg of protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and probing with anti-V5, anti-FLAG, and β-actin antibodies. In a similar experiment, 1 mg of protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 antibody and immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody.RESULTSAfter a series of experiments, we found that siRNA against GSK-3β inhibited GSK-3β and led to nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 as analyzed by immunoblotting and probing with anti-GSK3β and anti-Nrf2 antibodies (Fig. 1A). The blots were reprobed with anti-LDH (cytosol-specific) and anti-Lamin B (nuclear specific) antibodies to confirm the purity of cytosolic and nuclear fractions. GSK-3β is a serine/threonine kinase that regulates vital processes of cell division and apoptosis (16.Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). Interestingly, siRNA-mediated inhibition of GSK-3β also led to stabilization of Nrf2 (Fig. 1B) and induction of the Nrf2 down-stream gene nqo1 ARE-luciferase expression (Fig. 1C, right panel). The nuclear accumulation and stabilization of Nrf2 was GSK-3β siRNA concentration-dependent. Nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 after GSK-3β siRNA transfection resulted in higher NQO1 protein levels (Fig. 1D, left panel). This increase in NQO1 protein was because of Nrf2-mediated increased NQO1 transcription as analyzed by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1E). The increased nuclear accumulation and stability of Nrf2 was not because of increased transcription of Nrf2 as Nrf2 transcript levels did not change after GSK-3β siRNA transfection (Fig. 1E). In a related set of experiments, the treatment of cells with chemical based GSK-3β inhibitors, lithium chloride (LiCl) and TDZD-8, showed similar results as observed with GSK-3β siRNA (Fig. 2). Both inhibitors enhanced nuclear accumulation and stabilization of Nrf2 in total cell lysates and increased ARE-luciferase activity (Fig. 2, A and B). Lithium chloride-mediated inhibition of GSK-3β enzyme activity also led to increased NQO1 protein (Fig. 2C) and gene expression without affecting Nrf2 transcription (Fig. 2D). These results suggested that a decrease in GSK-3β protein or inhibition of GSK-3β activity led to nuclear accumulation and stabilization of Nrf2 without affecting its transcription. The nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 in response to GSK-3β inhibitors is because of blocking of nuclear export of Nrf2 as reported previously (17.Salazar M. Rojo A.I. Velasco D. de Sagarra R.M. Cuadrado A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14841-14851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Inhibition of GSK-3β by chemical inhibitors leads to nuclear accumulation and stabilization of Nrf2. A and B, Western analysis. HepG2 cells were treated with LiCl or TDZD-8 for 2 h in concentrations as indicated. The cells were harvested, subjected to subcellular fractionation to prepare cytosolic and nuclear extracts (Nuc Ext), or lysed to prepare total cell lysate. The cytosolic and nuclear extracts (A and B, left panels) and total cell lysate (A and B, middle panels) were analyzed by Western blotting and probing with anti-Nrf2 antibody. The blots were also probed with anti-Lamin B (nuclear specific), anti-LDH (cytosol-specific) and anti-actin (equal loading) antibodies. A and B, right panels, ARE-luciferase assay. HepG2 cells were co-transfected with NQO1-ARE luciferase reporter and firefly Renilla luciferase as described under “Materials and Methods.” Thirty six h after transfection, the cells were treated with either TDZD-8 (10, 25 or 50 μm in top panel) or lithium chloride (10, 25, or 50 mm, bottom panel) for 8 h. Cells were harvested, lysed, and analyzed for the luciferase activity. The results are presented as ± S.E. of three independent experiments, and each experiment was done in triplicate. C, Western analysis. Hepa1 cells were treated with GSK-3β inhibitor; LiCl were lysed in RIPA buffer as in B and analyzed for NQO1 protein levels by immunoblotting. D, RT-PCR. In a similar experiment, total RNA was prepared from Hepa1 cells treated as in C, and RT-PCR was done as described in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Earlier, we have shown that Fyn kinase-mediated phosphorylation of Nrf2Y568 is essential for the nuclear export of Nrf2 (13.Jain A.K. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12132-12142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Therefore, the treatment of human hepatoblastoma (HepG2) cells with the Fyn inhibitor PP2 led to nuclear accumulation and stabilization of Nrf2 due to blocking of nuclear export of Nrf2 (13.Jain A.K. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12132-12142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The inhibition of GSK-3β also led to nuclear accumulation and stabilization of Nrf2 due to the inhibition of nuclear export of Nrf2 (Fig. 1). This raised questions if GSK-3β is upstream to Fyn because Fyn directly phosphorylated Nrf2Y568 or GSK-3β and Fyn regulated nuclear export of Nrf2 by two independent mechanisms? We performed experiments to determine whether GSK-3β inhibitor LiCl and Fyn inhibitor PP2 act independent of each other or in concert leading to nuclear accumulation of Nrf2. HepG2 cells were treated with different doses of either LiCl or PP2 or both in combination; cytosol and nuclear fractions were prepared and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting, and probing with Nrf2 antibody (Fig. 3A). The blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-LDH (cytosolic marker) and anti-Lamin B (nuclear marker) antibodies. The cytosolic fractions had undetectable amounts of Nrf2, therefore not shown. The results demonstrated that Nrf2 accumulated in the nucleus in a PP2 dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A, lanes 1-3). Low and high dose LiCl treatment also led to dose-dependent nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 1, 4, and 7). However, when LiCl was included with a low dose of PP2, Nrf2 followed PP2 dose-dependent nuclear accumulation (Fig. 3A, lanes 4-6). Finally, a combination of higher doses of PP2 (1 μm) with different doses of LiCl could not result in increased nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 as compared with PP2 alone (Fig. 3A, lanes 7-9). These results indicate that inclusion of LiCl with PP2 did not increase further the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 over that observed with PP2 alone. In a related experiment, HepG2 cells were transfected with the NQO1 gene ARE-luciferase. The transfected cells were treated with different doses of LiCl or PP2 alone or in combinations and analyzed for luciferase activity (Fig. 3B). The results showed similar increase in luciferase activity with PP2 alone or in combination with LiCl. In other words, the LiCl had no effect on PP2 induction of ARE-luciferase gene expression. To further prove these observations, we used siRNA against both Fyn and GSK-3β alone or in combinations. In accordance with our earlier published results (13.Jain A.K. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12132-12142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), ARE-luciferase activity increased after siRNA-mediated inhibition of Fyn in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). Similar results were obtained with GSK-3β siRNA. However, when both the siRNAs were used in combination, the ARE-luciferase activity followed the pattern as observed by inhibition of Fyn alone indicating that both these kinases affect Nrf2 by a similar pathway (Fig. 3C). Also, inhibition of both the kinases together did not show a further increase in Nrf2 protein stabilization as seen by Fyn siRNA alone (Fig. 3D). These results suggested that inhibition of GSK-3β and Fyn had a concerted and not an additive effect on nuclear accumulation of Nrf2. In other words, GSK-3β is upstream to Fyn in the control of nuclear export of Nrf2.FIGURE 3GSK-3β and Fyn regulate Nrf2 via same pathway. A, Western analysis. PP2 and LiCl led to nuclear accumulation of endogenous Nrf2. HepG2 cells were treated with PP2 (0.5 and 1 μm) or LiCl (10 and 50 mm) or a combination of both for 2 h. Cells were harvested and fractionated, and nuclear fractions were immunoblotted with anti-Nrf2 and anti-Lamin B antibody. Nrf2 levels were normalized to Lamin B levels as described earlier, and the fold amount of Nrf2 in the nucleus in untreated or treated cells is shown (lower panel). B, ARE-luciferase assay. HepG2 cells were co-transfected with NQO1-ARE luciferase reporter and firefly Renilla luciferase as described under “Materials and Methods.” Thirty six h after transfection, the cells were treated with either PP2 or lithium chloride as in A for 8 h. Cells were then harvested and lysed to analyze the luciferase activity. The results are presented as ± S.E. of three independent experiments, and each experiment was done in triplicate. C, ARE-luciferase assay. Hepa-1 cells were co-transfected as in B along with GSK-3β or Fyn siRNA in combination and doses as indicated, lysed, and analyzed for luciferase activity. D, Western analysis. Hepa-1 cells were transfected with siRNA in combinations as indicated. 48 h later, cells were lysed to obtain total cell lysate. 50 μg of lysate was probed with antibodies against Nr2, GSK-3β, Fyn, and β-actin. Protein levels were normalized to β-actin levels as described earlier, and the fold amount of protein is plotted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, we determined the effect of LiCl inhibition of GSK-3β on hydrogen peroxide-induced nuclear import and export of Nrf2 and Fyn (Fig. 4). The untransfected and Nrf2-V5- or FLAG-Fyn-transfected HepG2 cells were treated with hydrogen peroxide in the absence and presence of LiCl and were subcellularly fractionated. The distribution of Nrf2 and Fyn in nuclear and cytosolic fractions was analyzed by immunoblotting. Hydrogen peroxide treatment led to import of Nrf2 in the nucleus at 1 h and export of Nrf2 at 4 h of treatment (Fig. 4A). The nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 is an early response of the Nrf2-INrf2 complex to hydrogen peroxide and was expected as reported earlier (11.Jain A.K. Bloom D.A. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29158-29168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 13.Jain A.K. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12132-12142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Hydrogen peroxide treatment at 1 h released Nrf2 from INrf2. Nrf2 translocated to the nucleus resulting in increased nuclear Nrf2. Nrf2 was exported out of the nucleus at 4 h after hydrogen peroxide treatment as a result of delayed response to oxidative stress (13.Jain A.K. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12132-12142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Inclusion of LiCl, an inhibitor of GSK-3β, blocked the nuclear loss of Nrf2 at 4 h of hydrogen peroxide treatment. Interestingly, Fyn response to hydrogen peroxide was opposite that of Nrf2. Endogenous Fyn protein levels were reduced in the nucleus at 1 h but increased at 4 h after hydrogen peroxide treatment of HepG2 cells (Fig. 4A). The LiCl-mediated inhibition of GSK-3β reduced the nuclear gain of Fyn at 4 h after hydrogen peroxide treatment (Fig. 4A). The exogenously expressed Nrf2-V5 protein showed similar localization patterns as observed with endogenous Nrf2 (compare Fig. 4B and Fig. 2B, Nuc. Ext panels). Nrf2-V5 accumulated in the nucleus in a LiCl dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B, left panel). However, the nuclear export-deficient mutant Nrf2Y568A-V5 showed accumulation in the nucleus even in the absence of LiCl. This is because of loss of tyrosine 568 phosphorylation and the absence of nuclear export of mutant protein (13.Jain A.K. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12132-12142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Treatment with LiCl had no effect on nuclear levels of Nrf2Y568A-V5 (Fig. 4B, right panel). Hydrogen peroxide treatment in the absence and presence of LiCl also showed similar results for exogenously expressed FLAG-Fyn as observed for endogenous Fyn (compare Fig. 4, C with A, nuclear panels).

The primary sequences of HMGB1 in various higher organisms, from birds to mammals, show more than 90% homology with each other (1.Landsman D. Bustin M. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The protein has multiple roles in transcription, replication, and cellular differentiation (2.Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 35-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Thomas J.O. Travers A.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 167-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). HMGB1 interacts with several transcription factors, thereby allowing them to perform their cellular roles. The phenotype of Hmgb1 knock-out mice confirmed the functional importance of HMGB1 as a regulator of transcription: they die shortly after birth and show a defect in the transcriptional control exerted by the glucocorticoid receptor (4.Calogero S. Grassi F. Aguzzi A. Voigtländer T. Ferrier P. Ferrari S. Bianchi M.E. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The subcellular distribution of the protein is tissue-specific: HMGB1 is located in both the nuclei and the cytoplasm of different tissues, such as lymphoid tissue, testis, neurons, and hepatocytes (5.Mosevitsky M.I. Novitskaya V.A. Iogannsen M.G. Zabezhinsky M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Wang et al. (6.Wang H. Bloom O. Zhang M. Vishnubhakat J.M. Ombrellino M. Che J. Frazier A. Yang H. Ivanova S. Borovikova L. Manogue K.R. Faist E. Abraham E. Andersson J. Andersson U. Molina P.E. Abumrad N.N. Sama A. Tracey K.J. Science. 1999; 285: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (2954) Google Scholar) identified HMGB1 as a late mediator of endotoxin lethality in mice and showed that monocytes and macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or interleukin-1 (IL-1) secrete HMGB1 in a delayed response. Patients with sepsis show an increased serum level of HMGB1, which is correlated with the severity of infection (7.Andersson U. Wang H. Palmblad K. Aveberger A.C. Bloom O. Erlandsson-Harris H. Janson A. Kokkola R. Zhang M. Yang H. Tracey K.J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). Moreover, HMGB1 in monocytes and macrophages is extensively acetylated upon activation by LPS, causing localization of the protein to the cytosol (8.Bonaldi T. Talamo F. Scaffidi P. Ferrera D. Porto A. Bachi A. Rubartelli A. Agresti A. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5551-5560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). Cytosolic HMGB1 is then concentrated into secretory lysosomes and secreted when the cells receive an appropriate second signal (9.Gardella S. Andrei C. Ferrera D. Lotti L.V. Torrisi M.R. Bianchi M.E. Rubartelli A. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). The recent discovery of extracellular HMGB1 as a proinflammatory mediator has been supported by a number of studies. In addition, HMGB1 is passively released from the nucleus to the extracellular milieu by cells that die as a result of necrosis or damage (10.Degryse B. Bonaldi T. Scaffidi P. Muller S. Resnati M. Sanvito F. Arrigoni G. Bianchi M.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1197-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Our previous studies showed that HMGB1 and HMGB2 are novel antigens of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), which are observed in the sera of the majority of patients with rheumatic diseases (11.Uesugi H. Ozaki S. Sobajima J. Osakada F. Shirakawa H. Yoshida M. Nakao K. J. Rheumatol. 1998; 25: 703-709PubMed Google Scholar), ulcerative colitis (UC) (12.Sobajima J. Ozaki S. Osakada F. Uesugi H.

Imai H. Kiyosawa K. Nakao K. Gut. 1999; 44: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), suggesting the cytoplasmic distribution of HMGB1 in neutrophils. Subsequently, we found that autoantibodies in sera from patients with UC hardly recognize HMGB1 in neutrophils. However, they are able to recognize HMGB1 in lymphocytes, as well as HMGB2, as judged by immunoblot analysis (15.Ito I. Mitsuoka N. Sobajima J. Uesugi H. Ozaki S. Ohya K. Yoshida M. J. Biochem. 2004; 136: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The anti-HMGB1 and -HMGB2 monoclonal antibody FBH7, recognizing a conformation of 52–56 residues of HMGB1, shows a similar profile to the antibodies in patient sera (15.Ito I. Mitsuoka N. Sobajima J. Uesugi H. Ozaki S. Ohya K. Yoshida M. J. Biochem. 2004; 136: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These results suggest that HMGB1 in neutrophils is different in conformation from that in lymphocytes at the epitope regions of patient sera and FBH7 and that HMGB1 is secreted from neutrophils to the extracellular milieu. However, the actual distribution of HMGB1 in the cytoplasm of neutrophils and the mechanisms responsible are obscure. Here we show that HMGB1 in neutrophils is post-translationally mono-methylated at lysine 42 (Lys42). The methylation alters the conformation of HMGB1 and weakens its DNA binding activity, causing it to become largely distributed in the cytoplasm by passive diffusion out of the nucleus. Thus, post-translational methylation of HMGB1 causes its cytoplasmic localization in neutrophils. This novel pathway explains the distribution of nuclear HMGB1 to the cytoplasm and is important for understanding how neutrophils release HMGB1 to the extracellular milieu to produce ANCA against HMGB1 in serum of affected patients. Preparation of HMGB1 and Recombinant Proteins−HMGB1 was prepared from pig thymus as described previously (16.Adachi Y. Mizuno S. Yoshida M. J. Chromatogr. 1990; 530: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Perchloric acid (PCA) extract fractions were prepared from neutrophils and lymphocytes of human peripheral blood as described (13.Sobajima J. Ozaki S. Uesugi H. Osakada F. Shirakawa H. Yoshida M.

Funct. 1995; 13: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Recombinant epitope-tagged, including 6× histidine and Xpress tags, HMGB1 box A fragment B1A (amino acid residues 1–76, wt) and its mutants B1A-R23L (R23L), B1A-K27L (K27L), B1A-K28L (K28L), B1A-K29L (K29L), and B1A-K42L (K42L), and AlB fragment B1AlB (amino acid residues 1–164; box A + linker + box B, wt) and its mutants B1AlB-R23L (R23L), B1AlB-K27L (K27L), B1AlB-K28L (K28L), B1AlB-K29L (K29L), and B1AlB-K42L (K42L) were overexpressed in Escherichia coli JM109 cells transformed with the pTrcHisA plasmid carrying the corresponding cDNA sequences, and purified as described previously (15.Ito I. Mitsuoka N. Sobajima J. Uesugi H. Ozaki S. Ohya K. Yoshida M. J. Biochem. 2004; 136: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged HMGB1 (fHMGB1-wt) and its mutants fHMGB1-K29L, fHMGB1-K42L, fHMGB1-K42A (K42A), fHMGB1-K29L/K42L, fHMGB1-ΔA (a lack of box A domain), and fHMGB1-R109E (R109E) were transiently expressed in HeLa S3 cells by transfection with the pCI-neo plasmid carrying the corresponding cDNA sequences using X-tremeGENE Q2 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Likewise, Aequorea coerulescens green fluorescence protein (GFP) and the fusion protein (GFP-NES) of GFP with the nuclear export signal (NES) sequence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Rev protein (LPPLERLTL) was expressed. Cell Culture−HL-60 cells and HeLa S3 cells were maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium 1640 (Sigma) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM, Sigma) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, respectively. HL-60 cells were treated with 1 μm all-trans retinoic acid (Wako) in RPMI medium 1640 for the indicated number of days to allow their differentiation into neutrophil-like cells. The rates of cell differentiation were measured by Wright-Giemsa staining (18.Gajl-Peczalska K.J. Bloomfield C.D. Coccia P.F. Sosin H. Brunning R.D. Kersey J.H. Am. J. Med. 1975; 59: 674-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and NBT reduction assay (19.Yam L.T. Li C.Y. Crosby W.H. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1971; 55: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2067) Google Scholar). The supernatant of the cell pellet was treated with PCA (final 5% (w/v)) and rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. The 5% PCA precipitate obtained was processed as described previously (7.Andersson U. Wang H. Palmblad K. Aveberger A.C. Bloom O. Erlandsson-Harris H. Janson A. Kokkola R. Zhang M. Yang H. Tracey K.J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). Antibodies−Mouse anti-HMGB1 monoclonal antibody KS1 recognizing HMGB1, mouse anti-HMGB1, and -HMGB2 monoclonal antibody FBH7 recognizing HMGB1 and HMGB2 conformations, and rabbit anti-HMGB polyclonal antibody (pAb) 1 were used. Affinity-purified rabbit antibody against mono-methylated K42 peptide (NFSEFSKmKCSER, B1K42me) of HMGB1 (αB1K42me) was prepared by Japan Bio Services Co., Ltd. Anti-Xpress epitope tag antibody and anti-FLAG M2 antibody were purchased from Invitrogen and Sigma, respectively. The secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and Alexa Fluor 488 and 568 were purchased from Promega and Molecular Probes, respectively. ELISA and Immunostaining−Two synthetic peptides were prepared for ELISA. One peptide was B1K42me, and the other was its unmethylated peptide (NFSEFSKKCSER, B1unmod.) corresponding to amino acid residues 36–47 of HMGB1. An aliquot of 5 μg/ml of the peptides and purified pig HMGB1 in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, was adsorbed to the wells of a 96-well assay plate (Corning). HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Sigma) were used, and then the absorbance at 450 nm was measured with a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). Respective HL-60 cells, lymphocytes, and neutrophils were cytospun onto microscope slides, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. HeLa cells seeded onto an 8-well chamber slide (Lab-Tek) were transfected with the pCI-fHMGB1 and its mutants, and cultured for 48 h. The cells were immunostained and observed with an Axiovert 200 fluorescence microscope (Zeiss) and LSM510 META confocal microscope (Zeiss). For competitive immunostaining, αB1K42me was preincubated with 0.5 μg/μl. B1K42me or B1unmod. peptide for 30 min at room temperature. MALDI-TOF MS Analysis−HMGB1 in PCA extract fractions prepared from neutrophils and lymphocytes was separated by SDS-PAGE. The protein in the gel piece was reduced with dithiothreitol and then hydrolyzed by trypsin or chymotrypsin. The peptides were extracted in 60% (v/v) acetonitrile containing 1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The extracts were concentrated and desalted with ZipTip C-18 (Millipore), and mixed with saturated α-ciano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for analysis using a REFLEX III mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics). DNA Binding Assays−Southwestern analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) were carried as described previously (20.Shirakawa H. Tanigawa T. Sugiyama S. Kobayashi M. Terashima T. Yoshida K. Arai T. Yoshida M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5992-5999Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21.Saito K. Kikuchi T. Yoshida M. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Subcellular Fractionation of Neutrophils−Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation experiments were performed with minor modifications as described previously (22.Stochaj U. Silver P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 23.Falciola L. Spada F. Calogero S. Langst G. Voit R. Grummt I. Bianchi M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To prepare the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, neutrophils (1 × 106 cells) obtained from human peripheral blood were suspended in 50 μl of fractionation buffer (4.05 mm Na2HPO4, 0.74 mm KH2PO4, 68.5 mm NaCl, 1.34 mm KCl, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 100 μg/ml digitonin, and then stood on ice for 5 min. After the permeabilization treatment, the lysate was centrifuged for 5 min. The pellet and supernatant were collected as the nuclear and the cytoplasmic fractions, respectively. Differences in Conformation of HMGB1 between Lymphocytes and Neutrophils−Previously, we found that autoantibodies in serum samples from patients with UC hardly recognize HMGB1 in neutrophils, whereas they are able to recognize HMGB1 in lymphocytes, as well as HMGB2, as judged by immunoblot analysis (15.Ito I. Mitsuoka N. Sobajima J. Uesugi H. Ozaki S. Ohya K. Yoshida M. J. Biochem. 2004; 136: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Anti-HMGB1 and -HMGB2 monoclonal antibody FBH7 showed a similar profile to the antibodies in patient sera, while anti-HMGB1 monoclonal antibody KS1 revealed the presence of HMGB1 in neutrophils. To elucidate the difference in immunoreactivity between neutrophil HMGB1 and lymphocyte HMGB1, we mapped the epitopes for FBH7 and KS1 using several methods. The results showed that the epitope of FBH7 is located at amino acid residues 52–56 of HMGB1, and that the intact conformation of HMGB1 box A or the combined structure of the α-helices is important for FBH7 recognition. In contrast, the epitope of KS1 is located at amino acid residues 70–72 of HMGB1, and the conformation of box A is not necessary for its recognition (Fig. 2, B and C). These results suggested that HMGB1 in neutrophils is different in conformation from that in lymphocytes at the epitope regions of patient sera and FBH7. Mapping of the epitope showed that FBH7 recognizes the conformation of 52–56 residues of HMGB1 and HMGB2, and suggested that the epitope region or its peripheral structure in neutrophil HMGB1 is conformationally changed, resulting in a decrease of recognition by the antibodies (Fig. 1A) (15.Ito I. Mitsuoka N. Sobajima J. Uesugi H. Ozaki S. Ohya K. Yoshida M. J. Biochem. 2004; 136: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This conformational alteration of HMGB1 may confer new biochemical properties on the protein. Therefore, PCA extract fractions containing mainly HMGB1, HMGB2, and histone H1 were prepared from lymphocytes and neutrophils. The amounts of HMGB1 in the two cell types were similar, judging from their Coomassie and Amido Black staining profiles (Fig. 1B). Southwestern blotting analysis for neutrophil HMGB1 probed with 32P-labeled DNA showed a weaker band in comparison with lymphocytes. These data suggested that neutrophil HMGB1 has less DNA binding activity than lymphocyte HMGB1 because of a possible change in conformation. Despite the difference of HMGB1 between lymphocytes and neutrophils, we did not detect any HMGB1 variant in these cells (data not shown).FIGURE 1Differences between lymphocyte and neutrophil HMGB1.

Then, HMGB1 in neutrophils may be post-translationally modified. To identify the probable modification of HMGB1, HMGB1 in the SDS gel band of the PCA extract fraction from neutrophils was subjected to trypsin digestion, followed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Acetylated, phosphorylated, or glycosylated peptide was not found in neutrophil HMGB1. On the other hand, in addition to the peptide peaks of the predicted masses, peaks with additional masses of 14 and 28 Da corresponding to one and two methyl group adducts, were observed in repeated experiments (Table 1). Notably, a peak corresponding to the mono-methylated 30–42 peptide of HMGB1 (m/z 1478.7080) was most frequently observed in neutrophil HMGB1 digests, but not in lymphocyte HMGB1 digests (Fig. 2A). This result indicated that Lys42 in HMGB1 of neutrophils is post-translationally mono-methylated, and that Arg23, Lys27, Lys28, and Lys29 are the possible sites of methylation (Fig. 2, B and C). The Lys42-mono-methylated peak was also reproducibly observed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in chymotrypsin digests of neutrophil HMGB1 (supplemental Table S1). No modification of Lys54 and Lys56 in neutrophil HMGB1, which are located within the epitope of FBH7, was detected. In addition, none of the lysine and arginine residues in lymphocyte HMGB1 were methylated. The limited amount and partial methylation of neutrophil HMGB1 hampered further MS/MS analysis. Therefore, to verify mono-methylation of Lys42,an affinity-purified rabbit antibody against mono-methylated K42 peptide (αB1K42me) was prepared. ELISA and immunoblotting were conducted with αB1K42me in order to examine the specificity of the antibody. As shown in Fig. 2D, B1K42me peptide and neutrophil HMGB1 were recognized by αB1K42me, but B1unmod. peptide, pig, and lymphocyte HMGB1 were not. In addition, neutrophils were stained by αB1K42me, indicating that Lys42 of HMGB1 in neutrophils, but not that in lymphocytes, is mono-methylated (Fig. 2, E and F). Interestingly, most of the Lys42-methylated HMGB1 seemed to be localized in the cytoplasm, while total HMGB1 recognized by KS1 was distributed in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic immunostaining profile obtained with αB1K42me was consistent with that obtained with KS1 in the magnified view (Fig. 2G), and was completely abolished in the presence of B1K42me peptide as a competitor, but not by B1unmod. peptide (Fig. 2H). These observations demonstrated that a proportion of HMGB1 molecules in neutrophils are post-translationally mono-methylated at Lys42.TABLE 1MALDI-TOF MS analyses of methylated peptides from neutrophil HMGB1 digested by trypsinSubmitaSubmit, the actual m/z values measured on a mass spectrometer.DB massbDB mass, the mass values of theoretical digest products of the protein of interest.Mass diff.cMass diff., the mass that differs from a theoretical database mass.Mod. diff.ΔMassdΔMass (ppm), the mass difference as parts per million.MethylationeMethylation, the number of possible methylated residues.#MCf#MC, the number of missed cleavage sites in the peptide.PeptidegPeptide, amino acid sequence of the peptide.PositionhPosition, amino acid numbers of the peptide in HMGB1.Reproducibilitym/zm/zm/zm/zppm1478.70801464.675314.032714.015711.606710HPDASVNFSEFSK30-424/51510.73021496.666114.064114.015732.338510MSSYAFFVQTCR12-232/51620.81071592.770328.040428.03145.650521KHPDASVNFSEFSK29-423/51592.770328.040428.03145.650521HPDASVNFSEFSKK30-432033.85312019.905113.948014.0157-33.516411MSSYAFFVQTCREEHK12-272/5a Submit, the actual m/z values measured on a mass spectrometer.b DB mass, the mass values of theoretical digest products of the protein of interest.c Mass diff., the mass that differs from a theoretical database mass.d ΔMass (ppm), the mass difference as parts per million.e Methylation, the number of possible methylated residues.f #MC, the number of missed cleavage sites in the peptide.g Peptide, amino acid sequence of the peptide.h Position, amino acid numbers of the peptide in HMGB1. Open table in a new tab Subcellular Distribution of HMGB1 in Lymphocytes and Neutrophils−Fig. 3A shows a profile of neutrophils immunostained by FBH7, which recognizes non-modified HMGB1, in comparison with immunostaining by KS1, which recognizes total HMGB1. Only the nuclei were stained by FBH7, whereas both the nuclei and the cytoplasm were stained by KS1. Immunoblotting analysis of the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions prepared from neutrophils confirmed the above observations (Fig. 3B), indicating that most of the cytoplasmic HMGB1 is methylated. The staining profile of lymphocytes was consistent with that obtained using Hoechst 33258, showing that HMGB1 is localized only in the nucleus. Together, the data demonstrate that most Lys42-mono-methylated HMGB1 is localized in the cytoplasm of neutrophil, whereas non-methylated HMGB1 exists in the nucleus. Extranuclear and Extracellular Release of HMGB1 from HL-60 Cells during Neutrophil-like Cell Differentiation−The above results suggested that Lys42 mono-methylation of HMGB1 occurs during the process of differentiation into neutrophils. HL-60 cells are a useful model of neutrophils for investigating the processes involved, because they can be induced to differentiate into neutrophil-like cells by culture in the presence of all-trans retinoic acid. Wright-Giemsa staining and NBT reduction assay showed that about 80% of HL-60 cells had differentiated into neutrophil-like cells at 6 days, i.e. the final period or termination of their differentiation process (Fig. 4A). The reactivity of FBH7 with HMGB1 in cell lysates was decreased after 6 days in comparison with that of KS1 (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the Lys42 post-translational methylation of neutrophil HMGB1 was accompanied by cell maturation. We then investigated whether HL-60 cells release HMGB1 to the extracellular milieu in the process of differentiation. Immunoblotting analysis with KS1 detected increasing amounts of HMGB1 in the cell culture supernatants depending on the differentiation process, whereas immunoblotting with FBH7 did not, suggesting that the released HMGB1 must be methylated (Fig. 4C). About 10% of HMGB1 protein in HL-60 cells was released at the end of the differentiation process (Fig. 4D). In addition, both the nuclei and the cytoplasm of differentiated HL-60 cells were stained with KS1, whereas only the nuclei were stained with FBH7 (Fig. 4E), showing a staining profile similar to that of neutrophils (Fig. 3A). These data indicated that the conformational change of box A, the cytoplasmic distribution, and the release of HMGB1 accompanied by Lys42 mono-methylation must occur during the process of differentiation into neutrophils. HMGB1 Mutation Analyses of Immunoreactivity, DNA Binding Activity, and Subcellular Distribution−Results of Southwestern blotting analysis for neutrophil HMGB1 (Fig. 1B) suggested a mechanism for the cytoplasmic distribution of Lys42-methylated HMGB1. That is, Lys42 methylation of HMGB1 may alter its DNA binding activity, resulting in a change in the subcellular distribution of the protein. To examine this possibility, Lys42 was substituted with a leucine residue, which mimics a methylated residue in terms of increased hydrophobicity. The recombinant epitope-tagged fragment B1AlB-wt and its mutants were overexpressed in E. coli and purified (Fig. 5A). The FBH7 immunoreactivity with B1AlB-K29L and B1AlB-K42L was substantially decreased in comparison with those of wt and other mutants, despite the fact that no residue in the FBH7 conformational epitope (52–56 residues) was substituted, whereas KS1 showed similar immunoreactivity with wt and the mutants. These staining profiles showed a similar to that of B1A mutants. Fig. 5B shows the DNA binding activity of mimicked HMGB1 fragments analyzed by EMSA. The band shift of B1AlB-K42L was lower than those of B1AlB-wt and other mutants. Additional supershift assay using anti-Xpress antibody showed that B1A-K42L had less DNA binding activity than B1A-wt or the other mutants. These results indicated that Lys42 methylation significantly affects the DNA binding activity of intrinsic HMGB1, and that Lys42 is a crucial residue for the immunoreaction of FBH7. To determine by fluorescence microscopy whether the mimic of Lys42-methylated HMGB1 shows a cytoplasmic distribution, the FLAG-tagged HMGB1 (fHMGB1-wt) and its mutants including fHMGB1-K42L were transiently expressed in HeLa cells (Fig. 6A). The fHMGB1-K42L and fHMGB1-K29L/K42L showed higher distributions in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, whereas fHMGB1-wt and fHMGB1-K29L were localized mainly in the nucleus. Control fHMGB1-ΔA showed cytoplasmic localization. Box B in HMGB1 plays an important role in the association with DNA. The Arg109 residue in box B has direct electrostatic interaction with DNA to bring about the correct array of the box on DNA into which the side chain of Phe102 intercalates. R109E mutation resulted in loss of DNA binding activity of box B and a decrease in that of AlB domain without any conformational change (21.Saito K. Kikuchi T. Yoshida M. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Further investigation of the relationship between the decrease of DNA binding activity and cytoplasmic localization of proteins showed that the signal of fHMGB1-R109E by anti-FLAG antibody was detectable in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig. 6A). These results clearly indicated that the DNA binding activity of HMGB1 is a potent factor for its nuclear localization. HMGB1 presumably has an obscuring non-classical NES, and is exported to the cytoplasm depending on both chromosomal region"

We characterized the metabolism of vitamin C and its relationship with glutathione in primary cultures of human endothelial cells oxidatively challenged by treatment with hydrogen peroxide or with activated cells undergoing the respiratory burst, and analyzed the manner in which vitamin C interacts with glutathione to increase the antioxidant capacity of cells. Our data indicate that: (i) endothelial cells express transporters for reduced and oxidized vitamin C and accumulate ascorbic acid with participation of glutathione-dependent dehydroascorbic acid reductases, (ii) although increased intracellular levels of vitamin C or glutathione caused augmented resistance to oxidative stress, 10-times more glutathione than vitamin C was required, (iii) full antioxidant protection required the simultaneous presence of intracellular and extracellular vitamin C at concentrations normally found in vivo, and (iv) intracellular vitamin C cooperated in enhancing glutathione recovery after oxidative challenge thus providing cells with enhanced survival potential, while extracellular vitamin C was recycled through a mechanism involving the simultaneous neutralization of oxidant species. Therefore, in endothelial cells under oxidative challenge, vitamin C functions as an essential cellular antioxidant even in the presence of a vast molar excess of glutathione.

Therefore, in endothelial cells under oxidative challenge, vitamin C functions as an essential cellular antioxidant even in the presence of a vast molar excess of glutathione. Human cells contain two important water soluble antioxidants, vitamin C and the tripeptide glutathione (l-γ-glutamyl-l-cysteinyl-glycine). Vitamin C plays an important physiological role in cells as a reducing agent and antioxidant, free radical scavenger, and enzyme cofactor (1Carr A. Frei B. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1999; 69: 1086-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 2Padayatty S.J. Katz A. Wang Y. Eck P. Kwon O. Lee J-H. Chen S. Corpe C. Dutta A. Dutta S.K. Levine M. J. Am. Coll. Nutr. 2003; 22: 18-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). Glutathione is the most abundant non-protein thiol in mammalian cells and participates in multiple functions central to the physiology of cells, acting as a reducing agent, antioxidant, and free-radical scavenger and is involved in the metabolism and detoxification of xenobiotics, and alterations in GSH levels and metabolism have been associated with different human diseases (3Meister A.

Inversely, glutathione ester supplementation can protect or delay the effects of a vitamin C-free diet in newborn rats and guinea pigs unable to synthesize vitamin C (3Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9397-9400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Martensson J. Han J. Griffith O.W. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although a functional relationship between glutathione and vitamin C has been clearly established in rats and guinea pigs, we know little about how they cooperate in providing human cells with potent antioxidant defense mechanisms and to which degree this cooperation is affected by their different metabolism. Glutathione is found in cells predominantly as reduced glutathione (GSH), with very low levels of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) present in cells under physiological conditions. Moreover, all human cells possess the capacity to synthesize glutathione from its constitutive amino acids with participation of the enzymes γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase and GSH synthetase, and oxidized glutathione can be recycled back to glutathione by enzymes with glutathione reductase activity (4Wu G. Fang Y.Z. Yang S. Lupton J.R. Turner N.D. J. Nutr. 2004; 134: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (2670) Google Scholar). On the other hand, humans are one of the few species that lack the capacity to synthesize vitamin C and therefore the vitamin must be provided from external sources through the diet (7Wilson J.X. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2005; 25: 105-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 8Linster C.L. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). In solution, vitamin C exists in two forms; the reduced form, l-ascorbic acid (ascorbic acid, AA), and the oxidized form, dehydro-l-ascorbic acid (dehydroascorbic acid, DHA). The plasma concentration of vitamin C (in the form of AA) is ∼50 μm, with intracellular and tissue levels several orders of magnitude higher (8Linster C.L. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), indicating that vitamin C is concentrated in the cellular compartment of target tissues. Cells possess two complementary and overlapping mechanisms for the acquisition of vitamin C. AA is transported into cells by the Na+-ascorbate co-transporters (SVCTs), which correspond to high affinity AA transporters that transport their substrate down the electrochemical sodium gradient (7Wilson J.X. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2005; 25: 105-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 9Tsukaguchi H. Tokui T. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Chen X.Z. Wang Y. Brubaker R.F.

DHA transport is mediated by members of the facilitative glucose transporter family (GLUTs) down the substrate concentration gradient (11Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Fischbarg J. Golde D.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 12Joost H.G. Thorens B. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Importantly, transport of DHA allows the recycling of the DHA generated in oxidative reactions associated to the normal metabolism of the cells, and may be central to the low daily requirements of vitamin C in humans (13Wang Y. Russo T.A. Kwon O. Chanock S. Rumsey S.C. Levine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13816-13819Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 14Levine M. Wang Y. Padayatty S.J. Morrow J. Proc.

Chem. 2003; 278: 10128-10133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Glutathione has been implicated in the cellular accumulation of AA and the maintenance of the vitamin in its reduced state intracellularly. Thus, mammalian cells express a number of glutathione-dependent DHA reductases involved in DHA metabolism such as glutaredoxin, protein-disulfide isomerase and glutathione S-transferase omega, but they also express the NADPH-dependent DHA reductases thioredoxin reductase and aldoketo reductases (8Linster C.L. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Remarkably, cellular glutathione levels may exceed vitamin C by more than one order of magnitude on a molar basis (3Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9397-9400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), generating the question about the real antioxidant role that low intracellular concentrations of vitamin C can play in the presence of a vast molar excess of glutathione. In this regard, in animals made glutathione deficient by treatment with BSO, the glutathione deficiency was accompanied by a marked decrease in the tissue levels of ascorbic acid, indicating either a role for glutathione in the metabolism of vitamin C or that vitamin C is used in reactions that normally use GSH. Interestingly, when the GSH-deficient animals were supplemented with ascorbic acid, besides the expected rise in the tissue ascorbate levels there was also a remarkable increase in cellular glutathione (5Martensson J. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4656-4660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These experiments suggest that ascorbic acid has an important role in the maintenance of adequate cellular levels of glutathione, although the data cannot be used to differentiate between a glutathione sparing effect or an effect on the de novo synthesis of glutathione. We addressed this question in in vitro experiments using as models primary cultures of endothelial cells from human umbilical vein (HUVECs) and human tonsils (HUTECs). We characterized the metabolism of vitamin C in the endothelial cells, including the manner in which vitamin C cooperates with glutathione to increase the antioxidant capacity of the cells. Our data indicate that vitamin C plays an essential role as an antioxidant in cells containing a vast excess of glutathione, cooperating with glutathione to provide the endothelial cells with the capacity to survive under conditions of oxidative stress, and that full antioxidant protection requires the simultaneous presence of intracellular and extracellular vitamin C at concentrations that are normally observed in vivo. Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were obtained from human umbilical cords by collagenase dissociation, cultured in HE-SFM medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, l-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, and fungizone and used at passages 3–4 (16Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (6012) Google Scholar). Human tonsil endothelial cells (HUTECs) (17Castro A. Bono M.R. Simon V.

Uptake Studies—Transport of radiolabeled ascorbic acid, dehydroascorbic acid, 2-deoxy-d-glucose (deoxyglucose), or 3-O-methyl-d-glucose (methylglucose) was performed as described (19Vera J.C.

NaCl was replaced with choline chloride (Na+-free buffer) to measure the effect of Na+ on ascorbate transport. Ascorbic acid uptake assays contained 0.1–0.4 μCi of l-[14C]ascorbic acid (specific activity 8.2 mCi/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and a final concentration of 0.05–15 mm ascorbic acid. For dehydroascorbic acid uptake, 0.1–10 units of ascorbate oxidase (50 units/mg protein, Sigma) were added to the ascorbic acid mix. Hexose uptake assays contained 1 μCi of 3-O-[methyl-3H]-d-glucose (specific activity 10 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 0.3–20 mm methylglucose, or 1 μCi of 2-[1,2-3H(N)]-deoxy-d-glucose (specific activity 26.2 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 0.3–20 mm deoxyglucose. For co-culture uptake experiments, the endothelial cells were grown to subconfluency in 6-well plates (∼2 × 105 cells/well). On the day of the experiment, HL-60 neutrophils (0.1–10 × 106 cells/well) were added to wells containing the adherent cells, followed by the addition of 0.2 μm phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and radiolabeled ascorbic acid. After uptake, the adherent cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the incorporated radioactivity was assayed by scintillation counting. Cell volumes were calculated by incubating cells with 1 mm radiolabeled methylglucose, a non-metabolizable glucose analog, until equilibrium was reached, and the amount of methylglucose inside the cells at equilibrium was used to estimate the internal volume of the cells that is free to exchange with the extracellular medium. All cells reached equilibrium within 2 h and the estimated exchangeable intracellular water volumes were 2 and 3 μl per million cells for HUVECs and HUTECs, respectively. When necessary, these values were used to normalize the data from uptake experiments in term of intracellular concentrations. Identification of Intracellular Vitamin C by HPLC—For HPLC, cells were lysed in 60% methanol, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) at 4 °C.

The RNAs were prepared using the micro poly(A) pure kit (Ambion), and reverse transcription was performed using the rapid RT-PCR kit (Clontech).

Endothelial Cells Transport AA and DHA but Accumulate Exclusively AA—Endothelial cells can synthesize and contain millimolar concentrations of glutathione but cannot synthesize vitamin C. We characterized the mechanism by which endothelial cells acquire and accumulate vitamin C and examined whether glutathione influences the capacity of the cells to accumulate the vitamin. Our data revealed that endothelial cells acquire vitamin C using two different mechanisms, specific for AA or DHA, respectively. Although uptake of AA has been demonstrated in human, rat, bovine, and pig endothelial cells, it has been also reported that they lack the capacity to transport AA (29Seno T. Inoue N. Matsui K.

Our transport studies revealed that the endothelial cells expressed a single AA transporter with the expected functional properties of SVCT2, including activation by Na+ in a cooperative and specific manner (nH = 1.9; Na+50 = 55 mm) (Fig. 1, A–C and Table 1) and a transport Km of 16 μm (Fig. 1B and Table 1). RT-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR and immunolocalization experiments confirmed expression of SVCT2 in endothelial cells and were negative for SVCT1 (Fig. 1D and data not shown).

Previous studies indicated that endothelial cells take up DHA, but no data are available on the kinetic properties or the molecular identity of the transporters involved. Our transport data indicated that primary endothelial cells express at least two transporters of different affinity with the capacity of transporting DHA (Km ≈ 0.7 and 4 mm) and DOG/OMG (Km ≈ 2.2–3.3 and 13.0–24.4 mm) (Fig. 1, E and F and Table 1). The results of RT-PCR experiments revealed that the endothelial cells expressed several members of the glucose transporter family, and confirmed expression of GLUT1, GLUT3, and GLUT4 (Fig. 1G). However, they lacked expression of GLUT2 and expressed the transporters GLUT5, GLUT6, and GLUT8 to GLUT12, results that were validated using as controls RNA from CaCo-2 cells (for GLUT1 to GLUT5) and total human brain RNA (for GLUT6 to GLUT12) (Fig. 1G). Immunolocalization experiments confirmed expression of GLUT1 and absence of GLUT2 in the endothelial cells, and revealed no GLUT3 and GLUT4 immunostaining under conditions in which they showed positive immunoreactivity in cells expressing the respective transporters (data not shown). Therefore, the PCR, immunolocalization, and functional data (Km DHA ≈ 0.7 mm, Km DOG/OMG ≈ 3–4 mm) support the conclusion that GLUT1 is the higher affinity DHA transporter expressed by human endothelial cells, a conclusion that is in line with the observation that GLUT1 is expressed at high levels in cerebral microvessel endothelial cells (34Pardridge W.M.

What is the identity of the low affinity DHA (Km ≈ 4 mm) and DOG/OMG transporter (Km ≈ 20 mm) expressed by endothelial cells? Although GLUT2 and GLUT6 are low affinity glucose transporters, our data indicate that only GLUT6 is expressed by endothelial cells. We have evidence from expression studies in Xenopus laevis oocytes that GLUT6 is a low affinity DHA transporter. 6C. G. Guzman, L. K. Azócar, C. I. Rivas, J. C. Vera, and J. G. Cárcamo, manuscript in preparation. The preliminary identification of GLUT6 as the low affinity DHA transporter expressed in endothelial cells is consistent with studies indicating expression of a low affinity glucose transporter in primary endothelial cells (36Regina A.

The isoforms GLUT8, GLUT10, and GLUT12 belong to the same class as GLUT6; they transport glucose and therefore are potential DHA transporters (11Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Fischbarg J. Golde D.W.

On the other hand, GLUT9 and GLUT11 belong to the same class as GLUT5, a fructose transporter unable to transport DHA, and therefore they are not expected to be DHA transporters (12Joost H.G.

Endothelial cells contained 3 mm glutathione, and treatment with BSO and diethylmaleate lowered cellular glutathione levels to less than 100 μm without viability loss (data not shown). HPLC analysis revealed that greater than 98% of the vitamin C accumulated in control and glutathione-depleted cells corresponded to AA (Fig. 1H), indicating that the endothelial cells accumulate and recycle AA independently of their glutathione content. On the other hand, the absence of glutathione affected accumulation capacity in HUVECs but not in HUTECs (Fig. 1, I–J). AA accumulation in HUVECs was mediated by two components of different affinity (Fig. 1I and Table 1), with only the lower affinity component showing a 50% decrease in Vmax in the glutathione-depleted cells (Table 1). Absence of glutathione did not affect AA accumulation in HUTECs (Fig. 1J and Table 1), a process that was characterized by a single functional component (Table 1). The previous data indicate that the endothelial cells express at least three DHA reductase activities involved in the intracellular reduction of DHA to AA, of which one was glutathione dependent and the other two were active in the absence of glutathione. The results of RT-PCR experiments confirmed that the endothelial cells express glutathione-dependent (glutaredoxin, protein-disulfide isomerase, and glutathione S-transferase omega) as well as NADPH-dependent DHA reductases (thioredoxin and aldo-keto reductase) (Fig. 1K). Glutaredoxin shows a Km for DHA of 1.5 mm and shows a cytoplasmic localization (23Wells W.W. Xu D.P. Yang Y.F. Rocque P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15361-15364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore may correspond to the low affinity, glutathione-dependent DHA reductase activity detected in HUVECs. On the other hand, thioredoxin reductase shows a Km for DHA of 1.5 mm and shows a cytoplasmic localization (38May J.M. Mendiratta S. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. J. Biol.

No evidence is currently available for a cytoplasmic, glutathione independent reductase with a Km for DHA of 0.15 mm similar to the glutathione independent, higher affinity component detected in HUVECs. Previous studies using cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells revealed that glutathione is required for the recycling of AA in endothelial cells, with pharmacological depletion of intracellular glutathione almost completely abolishi"
https://openalex.org/W1985921109,"We recently showed that FoxM1 is overexpressed in human glioblastomas and that forced FoxM1B expression in anaplastic astrocytoma cells leads to the formation of highly invasive glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in nude mice. However, the molecular mechanisms by which FoxM1 enhances glioma invasion are unknown. In this study, we found that FoxM1 overexpression increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 expression in glioma cells, whereas blockade of FoxM1 expression suppressed MMP-2 expression. Transfection of FoxM1 into glioma cells directly activated the MMP-2 promoter, whereas inhibition of FoxM1 expression by FoxM1-siRNA suppressed its activation. We identified a FoxM1-binding site in the MMP-2 promoter and demonstrated that FoxM1 protein bound directly to it. Mutation of this FoxM1-binding site significantly attenuated MMP-2 promoter activity. Furthermore, FoxM1 overexpression increased the invasiveness of glioma cells, whereas inhibition of FoxM1 expression suppressed the invasiveness of GBM cells. Inhibition of MMP-2 by a specific MMP-2 inhibitor reversed the invasive phenotype of glioma cells overexpressing FoxM1. Finally, immunohistochemical analysis of 45 human GBM specimens showed a significant correlation between FoxM1 overexpression and elevated MMP-2 expression. Collectively, these findings provide evidence that FoxM1 contributes to glioma progression by enhancing MMP-2 gene transcription and thus tumor-cell invasion."

In bone marrow-derived precursors, CSF-1 alone promoted assembly of MITF-PU.1 complexes at osteoclast target gene promoters like cathepsin K and acid 5 phosphatase without increasing gene expression. The combination of RANKL and CSF-1 concurrently increased the levels of MAPK-phosphorylated forms of MITF, p38 MAPK, and SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complexes bound to these target promoters and markedly increased expression of the genes.

Bone is a dynamic tissue that maintains both physical integrity and calcium homeostasis in vertebrate species. Consequently, bone is modeled and continuously remodeled beginning in embryogenesis and throughout the lifetime of mammals and other animals. Bone integrity and function are maintained by an exquisite balance between the two major cell types involved in the remodeling process, the osteoblast and the osteoclast (1Manolagas S.C. Endocr.

Osteoblasts, originating from mesenchymal progenitor cells, are responsible for the mineralization of bone matrix. Osteoclasts are of hematopoietic origin and are highly specialized multinuclear cells capable of resorbing bone. It is now well accepted that many human disorders of bone, including common human disorders like osteoporosis, Paget's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer bone metastases, reflect an imbalance in the differentiation and function of these two cell types (1Manolagas S.C.

Of these, MITF (microphthalmia-associated transcription factor) is a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper protein closely related to the transcription factor E (TFE) family, composed of TFE3, TFEB, and TFEC gene products (14Hodgkinson C.A.

Interactions between MITF and the Erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog (ETS) family transcription factor PU.1 at least partly account for the ability to regulate these target genes in osteoclasts (21So H.

However, MITF and PU.1 are expressed in macrophages and osteoclasts, as well as the mononuclear precursors for both of these cell types, posing an additional question about how correct gene regulation patterns are maintained in different cell types. In recent work, we demonstrated that subcellular localization of MITF was affected by signaling-dependent interactions with 14-3-3 proteins, providing one mechanism that regulates MITF activity in myeloid precursors cells (23Bronisz A.

In addition, MITF, PU.1, and NFATc1 can act in combination to synergistically activate reporter genes, and both PU.1 and NFATc1 have been localized to the Ctsk promoter by the chromatin immunoprecipitation technique (24Matsumoto M.

In the present work, CSF-1 and RANKL are demonstrated to regulate the nuclear activity of MITF and PU.1, resulting in increased occupancy of osteoclast target promoters by the phosphorylated, activated form of MITF, and in the co-recruitment of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex and activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Following these events, NFATc1 is recruited to target promoters. These results indicate that signaling-dependent regulation of MITF and PU.1 is critical in the initiation of transcription of target genes during osteoclast differentiation.

Briefly, osteoclast precursors were plated at a density of 3 × 106 cells per 10-cm dish and treated with cytokines for various times as indicated in the figure legends, and cells were cross-linked with 1% final concentration of formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min before harvest. Soluble chromatin was prepared following sonication with a Branson 250 digital sonifier (Branson Ultrasonics, Danbury, CT) to an average DNA length of 200-1000 bp. ∼5 × 105 cell equivalent (one-sixth) of the sheared soluble chromatin was pre-cleared with tRNA-blocked Protein G-agarose, and 10% of the pre-cleared chromatin was set aside as input control. Immunoprecipitation was carried out with 5 μg of antibodies as indicated in the figures overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were pulled down using Protein G-agarose, washed, and eluted twice with 250 μl of elution buffer (0.1 m NaHCO3, 1% SDS), and cross-linking was reversed in 200 mm NaCl at 65 °C overnight with 20 μg of RNase A (Sigma). DNA was purified following proteinase K treatment (Invitrogen) with the Qiagen PCR purification kit using the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were analyzed by real-time PCR either by SYBR Green super mix (Bio-Rad) for Ctsk promoter or by the Roche universal probe library (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) probe using the Faststart TaqMan master kit (Roche Diagnostics) for Acp5 promoter. The threshold for the promoter being studied was adjusted by that of input values and represented as relative abundance. All qPCR reactions were analyzed by melt curve analysis and agarose gels to confirm the presence of a single specific band. For ReChIP assays, pre-cleared soluble chromatin from 6 × 106 cells harvested from two 100-mm culture dishes were immunoprecipitated with PU.1 antibody. After washing, the PU.1-immune complex was disrupted with 10 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 30 min with shaking and diluted 50-fold with the ChIP buffer. This eluted immune complex was divided and immunoprecipitated with the second specific antibodies as indicated in the figures, and the complexes were analyzed as above. Immunoprecipitation, Immunofluorescence, Western Blotting, and GST Pulldown Assays—Procedures for immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and GST pulldown assays have all been recently described (23Bronisz A. Sharma S.M. Hu R. Godlewski J. Tzivion G. Mansky K.C. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3897-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Analysis of RNA Expression—RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Residual contaminating genomic DNA was removed using 2 units of DNase 1 (Roche Applied Science) for 20 min at room temperature, and RNA was purified with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). 2 μg of purified total RNA was reverse transcribed by Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with random hexamer primers. Primers used for real-time PCR were picked by Oligo v4.0 software, and sequences used are available upon request. The real-time PCR was conducted using SYBR Green super mix (Bio-Rad) in an iCycler real-time detection system (Bio-Rad). The PCR threshold was determined by using the iCycler PCR baseline-subtracted curve fit method. The threshold for the gene being studied was adjusted by that of a reference gene (ribosomal protein L4). All reactions were examined by agarose gels to confirm the presence of a single specific band. Mouse Mutants and Bone Histomorphometry—All mice were maintained on a C57B/6J background. Wild-type mice were used to make bone marrow precursors for the in vitro experiments. To generate mice for the genetic experiments mice heterozygous for both the Pu.1 null allele (22Luchin A. Suchting S. Merson T. Rosol T.J. Hume D.A. Cassady A.I. Ostrowski M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36703-36710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and the Mitfvga allele were crossed to mice heterozygous for both the Mitfmi and Mitfvga alleles. Mitfmi/vga mice have a white coat color (18Steingrimsson E. Tessarollo L. Pathak B. Hou L. Arnheiter H. Copel- and N.G. Jenkins N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4477-4482Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) but were also identified by genotyping for both alleles. The Pu.1 and mi alleles were genotyped as previously described (22Luchin A. Suchting S. Merson T. Rosol T.J. Hume D.A. Cassady A.I. Ostrowski M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36703-36710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The vga allele was genotyped by PCR with primers that recognized the lacZ transgene inserted into the Mitf locus. Use and care of mice in this study was approved by The Ohio State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Procedures for radiography and histomorphometry have been previously described (28Sankar U. Patel K. Rosol T.J. Ostrowski M.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 1339-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For radiography, skeletons were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and analyzed with Faxitron (Hewlett-Packard model 43855A) for 2 min at 45 kV using X-OMAT V film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Fixed femurs infiltrated with glycol methacrylate solution (Polysciences Inc.) at 4 °C were embedded using the JB-4 embedding kit (Polysciences Inc). Serial sagittal sections, 6-μm thick, were made and stained with hematoxylin & eosin and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) to visualize osteoclasts. Images of stained sections were acquired using a Spot 2 digital charge-coupled device camera on a Nikon E-1000 microscope, and ImagePro Plus was used to quantify the data. For all histomorphometric measures, four different sections from four different mice were quantified, and the values were averaged. CSF-1 Promotes Recruitment of MITF-PU.1 Complexes to Cathepsin K and Acid Phosphatase Promoters—We recently demonstrated that the combined action of CSF-1 and RANKL regulated the subcellular localization of MITF (23Bronisz A. Sharma S.M. Hu R. Godlewski J. Tzivion G. Mansky K.C. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3897-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To extend these observations and dissect the effect of CSF-1 alone on MITF function, the subcellular localization of MITF and its association with target promoters was analyzed as a function of CSF-1 stimulation. When CSF-1 was withdrawn from bone marrow-derived macrophage cultures for 12 h, indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated that MITF was found predominantly in the cytoplasm in 80% of cells studied (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1A). Addition of CSF-1 to these cytokine-deprived cells for 12 h resulted in the partial nuclear localization of MITF, with >80% of cells analyzed having both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining for MITF (Fig. 1A and supplementary Fig. 1A). In contrast, CSF-1 withdrawal and restimulation didn't significantly affect the nuclear localization of PU.1 (Fig. 1A). The affect of CSF-1 on MITF and PU.1 nuclear function was studied using the technique of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Fig. 1B represents the regions of Ctsk and Acp5 genes that were analyzed following the ChIP technique, regions previously demonstrated to contain binding sites for these transcription factors (19Luchin A. Purdom G. Murphy K. Clark M.Y. Angel N. Cassady A.I. Hume D.A. Ostrowski M.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 20Motyckova G. Weilbaecher K.N. Horstmann M. Rieman D.J. Fisher D.Z. Fisher D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5798-5803Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) (see supplemental Fig. S2A for sequences of the promoter regions containing binding sites for these factors). Upon withdrawal of CSF-1, as expected from previous results, MITF was not found at Ctsk and Acp5 promoters (Fig. 1C). In addition, PU.1, despite the nuclear localization of this factor, could not be detected at either of these promoters (Fig. 1C). After addition of CSF-1, MITF and PU.1 were enriched at both promoters (Fig. 1C), indicating that MITF plays a crucial role in the initial recruitment of PU.1 to these promoters. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was used to confirm the results (supplemental Fig. S1B). In addition to the 5′-region of the Ctsk and Acp5 genes, 3′-regions corresponding to internal exons/introns (also depicted in Fig. 1B) were used as negative controls. MITF and PU.1 could not be detected at this portion of the Ctsk or Acp5 genes (Fig. 1C). Additional negative controls performed were a reaction in which preimmune IgG (no antibody) was included, and analysis of the 5′-regulatory region of the Hprt gene, a gene that is not regulated by MITF or PU.1 (Fig. 1C). Histone H3 was routinely used as a positive control for all ChIP experiments, and signals were observed for specific antibodies with all primer sets used (Fig. 1C). The same set of negative controls was used for all subsequent ChIP experiments presented for both Ctsk and Acp5 genes (see supplemental Figs. S2-S5 for data). Although CSF-1 promoted nuclear localization of MITF and recruitment to osteoclast target promoters, CSF-1 alone was unable to promote differentiation of osteoclast-like cells (OCLs) in vitro (Fig. 2A) or to activate expression of the Ctsk and Acp5 genes (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the combination of CSF-1 and RANKL induced visible OCL formation after 3 days of treatment and resulted in robust expression of Ctsk and Acp5 genes. After 5 days of cytokine treatment, OCL differentiation was complete, and expression of target genes was at maximal levels (Fig. 2, A and B). ChIP assays were used over this time course of differentiation to determine if MITF-PU.1 complexes were further enriched at target promoters by the action of both cytokines versus CSF-1 alone (Fig. 2C; supplemental Fig. S2B for controls). The combination of CSF-1 and RANKL together for either 0.5 or 3 days resulted in only a marginal increase of <2-fold in occupancy of these two promoters by MITF or PU.1, a change that was not significantly different from the CSF-1 treatment (Fig. 2C, second and third bar graphs in each panel). After addition of both cytokines for 5 days, when OCL differentiation is completed, occupancy of Ctsk and Acp5 promoters by both MITF and PU.1 were maximal but only 2- to 3.5-fold higher than the CSF-1-only treatment (Fig. 2C, fourth bar graph). These data indicate that there are only small changes in the occupancy of these target promoters by MITF and PU.1 over the time course of OCL differentiation, which correlate well with the robust increases in gene expression observed after 3 days of CSF-1/RANKL treatment. Phosphorylated, Activated Forms of MITF and p38 MAPK Are Present at Target Promoters following CSF-1/RANKL Stimulation—MITF is targeted by both Erk and p38 MAPK pathways in a CSF-1/RANKL-dependent fashion, at residues Ser-73 and Ser-307, respectively, and both phosphorylation events increase MITF activity (11Mansky K.C. Sankar U. Han J. Ostrowski M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11077-11083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 12Weilbaecher K.N. Motyckova G. Huber W.E. Takemoto C.M.

Using phospho-specific MITF antibodies available for each of these residues, we analyzed whether chromatin-associated MITF located at the Ctsk promoter was phosphorylated at these positions (Fig. 3, A and B; supplemental Fig. S3A for controls). In bone marrow-derived cells that were grown with CSF-1 alone an enrichment of pSer73-MITF at the Ctsk promoter was observed, but pSer307-MITF was not detected. CSF-1 and RANKL treatment for 0.5 days had no additional effect on the level of pSer73-MITF at the Ctsk promoter, but the abundance of pSer307-MITF was substantially increased (Fig. 3B). After 3 days of combined CSF-1/RANKL stimulation, the levels of both pSer73 and pSer307 forms of MITF at the Ctsk promoter were maximal. The pSer73 form of MITF increased ∼10-fold at this time, whereas the pSer307 form increased an additional 3-fold above levels detected following 0.5 day of treatment. After 5 days of cytokine treatment, the chromatin-associated levels of both phosphorylated forms of MITF remained elevated and not significantly different from the levels seen at the 3-day time point. Whether the kinases responsible for phosphorylation of these sites were also enriched at the Ctsk promoter was examined (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. S3B for controls). This analysis demonstrated that the activated, phosphorylated form of p38 MAPK was not detected in cells treated with CSF-1 alone, but chromatin-associated phospho-p38 MAPK could be observed in cells treated with both CSF-1 and RANKL (Fig. 3C, gray bar graphs). The levels of phospho-p38 were also maximal after 3-5 days of treatment, increasing ∼3-fold over the level seen at 0.5 day of cytokine treatment. In contrast, Erk1 and -2 were not detected at the Ctsk promoter under the same conditions (Fig. 3C, black bar graphs). To more directly address whether phosphorylation of MITF and recruitment of p38 MAPK correlated with transcriptional activation of the target genes, ChIP was used to determine occupancy of the target promoters by RNA polymerase II (pol II) (Fig. 3D and supplemental Fig. S3B). An antibody that recognizes total RNA pol II, as well as one that recognizes pol II phosphorylated on the C-terminal tail, were used. The experiments demonstrated that levels of RNA pol II at the promoters correlate well with osteoclast differentiation, target gene expression, and the presence of phosphorylated MITF phospho-p38 MAPK than with the presence of the MITF-PU.1 complex alone. Enrichment of NFATc1-associated Ctsk and Acp5 Promoters Is Observed in Activated Osteoclasts—NFATc1 plays a central role in osteoclast differentiation and has been shown to collaborate with MITF and PU.1 in activation of Ctsk and Acp5 promoters (13Takayanagi H.

More than 90 mutations in the copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene cause a subset of familial ALS. Toxic properties have been proposed for the ALS-linked SOD1 mutants, but the nature of the toxicity has not been clearly specified. Cytoplasmic inclusion bodies containing mutant SOD1 and a number of other proteins are a pathological hallmark of mutant SOD1-mediated familial ALS, but whether such aggregates are toxic to motor neurons remains unclear. In this study, we identified a dynein subunit as a component of the mutant SOD1-containing high molecular weight complexes using proteomic techniques. We further demonstrated interaction and colocalization between dynein and mutant SOD1, but not normal SOD1, in cultured cells and also in G93A and G85R transgenic rodent tissues. Moreover, the interaction occurred early, prior to the onset of symptoms in the ALS animal models and increased over the disease progression. Motor neurons with long axons are particularly susceptible to defects in axonal transport. Our results demonstrate a direct “gain-of-interaction” between mutant SOD1 and dynein, which may provide insights into the mechanism by which mutant SOD1 could contribute to a defect in retrograde axonal transport or other dynein functions. The aberrant interaction is potentially critical to the formation of mutant SOD1 aggregates as well as the toxic cascades leading to motor neuron degeneration in ALS.

A comprehensive study of all protein components in the SOD1-containing aggregates would provide valuable insights into the toxicity of mutant SOD1. It is particularly interesting to identify proteins interacting with mutant SOD1 in the soluble HMW complexes in the early stage of protein aggregation. We recently demonstrated that fALS-linked SOD1 mutants A4V, G85R, and G93A can form soluble HMW complexes prior to forming insoluble aggregates in cultured cells (17.Zhang F. Zhu H. Biochim. Biophys.

Although the results were counterintuitive and the mechanisms remains unclear, these two studies strongly suggest that dynein-mediated retrograde transport may play an important role in the mutant SOD1-mediated familial ALS etiology. However, it has remained largely unknown how mutant SOD1 may cause the retrograde axonal transport defect. We hereby provide a direct connection between retrograde axonal transport and mutant SOD1. We demonstrate in this study that the ALS-linked SOD1 mutants A4V, G85R, and G93A interact with the dynein complex, whereas WT SOD1 does not. We further show the aberrant interactions between the dynein complex and ALS-linked SOD1 mutants in spinal cord and sciatic nerve of G93A and G85R transgenic mice and G93A transgenic rats. We also show that mutant SOD1 and the dynein complex are largely colocalized in the protein aggregates in the spinal cord motor neurons of the G93A and G85R SOD1 transgenic ALS mice. The significance of this novel interaction between mutant SOD1 and dynein and its potential relationship to ALS pathophysiology is discussed. Plasmids Construction−Mouse dynein intermediate chain (DIC) was amplified from the pEGFP-DIC construct (generously provided by Dr. Trina A. Schroer, Johns Hopkins University) by PCR and was inserted into the BamHI and NotI sites of the mammalian expression vector pEBG that expresses glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. Mouse DIC was also amplified and inserted to the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the pDsRed2 vector (Clontech) to construct DIC-DsRed plasmid. The SOD1-FLAG and SOD1-GFP constructs were described in the previous study (17.Zhang F. Zhu H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1760: 404-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The fidelity of all the constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Chemical Cross-linking and FLAG Immunoprecipitation−NSC34 and HEK293T cells were cultured at 37 °C under 5% CO2, 95% air in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics as described (35.Fukada K. Zhang F. Vien A. Cashman N.R. Zhu H. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2004; 3: 1211-1223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and were harvested and lysed 48 h after transfection unless indicated otherwise. NSC34 cells transfected with SOD1-FLAG were harvested and lysed in 1 ml of cross-linking buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). After preclearing, the cell lysate was incubated with 2 mm disuccinimidyl suberate on ice for 2 h and the reaction was quenched by adding 20 μl of 1 m Tris. The cross-linking reaction mixture was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (A2220, Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. The agarose beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer and boiled with 2× SDS loading buffer. The supernatant was loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE for protein separation. Mass Spectrometry Analysis and Protein Identification−The immunoprecipitated SOD1 containing cross-linked products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized with Sypro Ruby staining. Protein bands were sliced from the gel and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion and LC-MS/MS analysis as in our previous studies (35.Fukada K. Zhang F. Vien A. Cashman N.R. Zhu H. Mol. Cell.

Both MS and MS/MS data were acquired by Qstar XL Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) under information-dependent acquisition mode. The LC-MS/MS data were subjected to data base searches for protein identification using a local MASCOT search engine. Multiple databases (NCBInr, Swiss-Prot, and MSDB) were searched using the parameters as previously described (35.Fukada K. Zhang F. Vien A. Cashman N.R. Zhu H. Mol. Cell.

Age-matched WT SOD1 transgenic mice as well as non-transgenic litter-mates were used as controls. Pre-symptomatic G85R transgenic mice were sacrificed at the age of 167 days. Mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 0.3 ml of pentobarbital (50 mg/ml, Abbott Laboratories) and transcardically perfused with 0.1 m PBS, pH 7.5. Spinal cords and other tissues were dissected. All animal procedures were approved by each university’s IACUC committee. GST Pulldown and Immunoprecipitation of DIC−HEK293 cells transfected with both SOD1-FLAG and DIC-GST constructs were harvested and lysed in 1 ml of RIPA buffer. The protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Four hundred micrograms of lysate was incubated with 20 μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) in a total volume of 1 ml for 1 to 2 h at 4 °C to allow isolation of the GST fusion proteins. The glutathione beads were then collected, washed, and boiled in 2× SDS sample loading buffer. The proteins released from the beads were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. DIC immunoprecipitations were carried out for the dissected mice spinal cords and sciatic nerves using DIC mouse monoclonal antibody (sc-13524, Santa Cruz) and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Antibodies used in the Western blotting are rabbit anti-SOD1 (sc-11407, Santa Cruz), mouse anti-DIC, rabbit anti-DHC (sc-9115, Santa Cruz), and mouse anti-p150Glued (catalog number 610473, BD Pharmingen). Intensities of Western blotting bands were quantified using the Kodak 1D software (version 3.6.1). Fluorescence Microscopy−Immunohistological analyses were performed on lumbar spinal cords and sciatic nerves of ALS animals at various ages as indicated. Spinal cords were dissected post-fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m PBS, dehydrated, and embedded in Paraplast X-tra (Tyco Healthcare). Sections (6 μm) were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and boiled in 0.01 m citrate buffer, pH 6.0, at a high power setting for 15 min to retrieve antigens. Sciatic nerves were postfixed for 2 h in 4% paraformaldehyde, cryo preserved in 30% sucrose overnight, embedded in tissue-Tek OCT compound (Sakura) and 10-μm sections were cut. Paraffin and cryo sections were blocked in 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in 0.1 m PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBST) for 30 min before being incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 1% fetal bovine serum-PBST overnight at room temperature. The rabbit SOD1 antibody, the sheep SOD1 antibody (catalog PC077, The Binding Site), DHC antibody, and the mouse DIC antibody were used at 1/400, 1/400, 1/200, and 1/200, respectively. Following primary antibody incubation sections were washed with PBST and incubated with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochoride (Sigma) at 1:7500 and Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse (Molecular Probes) or Alexa Fluor 488 anti-sheep (Molecular Probes) at 1:250 in 10% fetal bovine serum/PBST at room temperature for 1 h. Sections were then washed with PBST, incubated with Alexa Fluor 594 anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes), washed, and then mounted using vectashield-mounting medium. Fluorescence microscopy was carried out using a Leica DM IRBE laser scanning confocal microscope with a ×100 objective. Identification of Dynein in the SOD1-containing High Molecular Weight Complexes−We recently reported that the ALS-linked SOD1 mutants have different conformations in live cells and form soluble HMW complexes prior to the formation of large aggregates, whereas such complexes were not observed for WT SOD1 (17.Zhang F. Zhu H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1760: 404-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrated retarded post-translational folding kinetics as a common feature of multiple ALS-linked SOD1 mutants (39.Bruns C.K. Kopito R.R. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 855-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The impaired folding abilities will likely increase the population of misfolded intermediates of mutant SOD1 and lead to formation of HMW complexes, supporting our results. In this study, the HMW complexes of the A4V mutant were captured in the presence of the chemical cross-linker disuccinimidyl suberate and visualized by Western blotting as shown in Fig. 1A. In contrast, WT SOD1 migrated only as monomers and dimers in SDS-PAGE after being cross-linked. The cross-linked A4V SOD1-containing HMW complexes were effectively immunoprecipitated as shown in Fig. 1B. Fig. 1C shows the Sypro Ruby staining of the SDS-PAGE resolved immunoprecipitation product. The protein bands were subsequently identified by proteomic and mass spectrometric analyses and are shown in the figure. SOD1 monomer, cross-linked SOD1 dimer, and IgG light chain were three major protein species. Copper chaperone for SOD1 and Hsp70 were identified and they have been reported to be associated with SOD1. Copper chaperone for SOD1 plays a critical role in facilitating copper binding to SOD1 (40.Schmidt P.J. Kunst C. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33771-33776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 41.Lamb A.L. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14720-14727Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and heat shock proteins are molecular chaperones for misfolded SOD1 mutants (7.Watanabe M. Dykes-Hoberg M. Culotta V.C.

Neurochem. 1999; 72: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The proteomic analysis also identified DHC and SOD1 as a cross-linked species from the top of the SDS-PAGE. In addition, the alternative shotgun proteomic approach also identified DHC in the immunoprecipitation sample of A4V SOD1, but not in the sample of WT SOD1. This novel finding, combined with the reported involvement of dynein and axonal transport in ALS, suggests that the dynein complex including the heavy chain and mutant SOD1 may interact with each other in vivo. The above hypothesis will be tested in this study. Interactions between Mutant SOD1 and the Dynein Complex in Cultured Cells−GST pulldown experiments were carried out to test whether mutant SOD1 interacts with the dynein complex. DHC (∼500 kDa) is difficult for genetic manipulation, thus DIC, a scaffold between dynein heavy chains and light chains, was selected in this study. WT and mutant SOD1 was tagged with FLAG, and DIC was tagged with GST as shown in Fig. 2A. SOD1-FLAG and GST-DIC were co-transfected in HEK293 cells, the cell lysate was subjected to GST pulldown and the pulldown product was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis (Fig. 2B). When GST-DIC and WT-SOD1 were co-expressed in HEK293 cells, GST-DIC was pulled down by glutathione beads, but WT-SOD1 was not pulled down together with GST-DIC. When GST-DIC and A4V SOD1 were co-expressed, A4V was pulled down together with GST-DIC. As a control, GST and A4V SOD1 were co-expressed, A4V was not pulled down with GST. Thus, A4V SOD1 was pulled down because it interacted with DIC and the GST domain did not contribute to the interaction. We further tested whether other ALS-linked SOD1 mutants interact with dynein. The same experiment was carried out with G85R SOD1 and G93A SOD1. As shown in Fig. 2C, A4V, G85R, and G93A were all pulled down with GST-DIC, but WT SOD1 was not. Negative controls co-transfecting GST and SOD1 were performed and showed that none of the mutants was pulled down with GST alone (identical to the last lane of Fig. 2B, data not shown), thus the interactions were between mutant SOD1 and DIC, but not an artifact of the GST domain. To further verify the interaction, reverse co-precipitation experiments were performed. WT or mutant SOD1-FLAG was pulled down using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel and co-immuno-precipitation of GST-DIC was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and anti-GST Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2D, DIC was co-precipitated with all three SOD1 mutants A4V, G85R, and G93A, but not with WT SOD1. As a control GST alone was not pulled down with any of the SOD1 mutants (right panel of Fig. 2D), supporting again that the interactions were not caused by the GST domain. The co-precipitation experiments in both directions (Fig. 2C and 2D) strongly support the interaction between mutant SOD1 and DIC. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the overexpression of GST-DIC did not disrupt the dynein complex and other associated motor proteins. As shown in the supplementary Fig. S1, DHC, DIC, light intermediate chain (DLIC), and light chain (DLC) were all identified by mass spectrometry in the GST-DIC pulldown sample. In addition, p150Glued (dynactin heavy chain, the protein linking dynein and the transported cargo) was pulled down with GST-DIC as shown in the Western blot in Fig. 2C. The results suggest that the dynein complex as well as dynactin complex and other associated proteins involved in retrograde transport remained largely in place when GST-DIC was overexpressed. Interactions between Mutant SOD1 and the Dynein Complex in Transgenic Animals−We further tested whether mutant SOD1 interacted with dynein in three different ALS animal models: G93A SOD1 and G85R SOD1 transgenic mice and G93A SOD1 transgenic rats. Spinal cord and sciatic nerve homogenates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using DIC monoclonal antibody and subsequent Western blotting analyses. In 60-, 90-, and 125-day-old G93A SOD1 transgenic mice spinal cords, DIC was ubiquitously detected as it was immunoprecipitated by this antibody (Fig. 3A, second row). At all three different ages, G93A SOD1 was co-immunoprecipitated with DIC, whereas WT SOD1 was not (Fig. 3A, top row). Moreover, quantitative results (Fig. 3B) showed that the amount of co-precipitated G93A SOD1 increased during disease progression. Compared with the 60-day-old pre-symptomatic mice, higher levels of co-precipitated G93A SOD1 were found in 90-day-old mice at the disease onset (p = 0.005) and in 125-day-old end-stage mice (p = 0.01). As shown in the input control (Fig. 3A, bottom row), comparable amounts of human WT and G93A SOD1 were used in the immunoprecipitation experiments. Consistent with the GST-DIC pulldown data in cultured cells, DHC and p150Glued were ubiquitously co-precipitated by the DIC antibody. As a negative control, the spinal cord homogenate of a 125-day-old G93A transgenic mouse was immunoprecipitated with an irrelevant HA antibody and none of DIC, DHC, p150Glued, or SOD1 was precipitated (Fig. 3A, left lane), supporting the speci"

https://openalex.org/W2020260318,"Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is involved in somatic DNA alterations of the immunoglobulin gene for amplification of immune diversity. The fact that constitutive expression of AID in mice causes tumors in various organs, including lymphoid tissues and lungs, suggests the important role of the aberrant editing activity of AID on various tumor-related genes for carcinogenesis. AID expression, however, is restricted to activated B cells under physiological conditions. We demonstrate here that ectopic AID expression is induced in response to tumor necrosis factor-alpha stimulation in cultured human hepatocytes. The proinflammatory cytokine-mediated expression of AID is achieved by IkappaB kinase-dependent nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB signaling pathways. Hepatitis C virus, one of the leading causes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), enhanced AID expression via NF-kappaB activation through expression of viral core protein. The aberrant expression of AID in hepatoma-derived cells resulted in accumulation of genetic alterations in the c-myc and pim1 genes, suggesting that inappropriate expression of AID acts as a DNA mutator that enhances the genetic susceptibility to mutagenesis in human hepatocytes. Our current findings indicate that the inappropriate expression of AID is induced by proinflammatory cytokine stimulation and may provide the link between hepatic inflammation and the development of HCC."

Recently, an overlapping antisense transcript to eNOS/NOS3 was implicated in the post-transcriptional regulation of eNOS. We demonstrate here that expression of sONE, also known as eNOS antisense (NOS3AS) or autophagy 9-like 2 (APG9L2), is robustly induced by hypoxia or functional deficiency of von Hippel-Lindau protein. sONE is also up-regulated in the aortas of hypoxic rats. In hypoxic endothelial cells, sONE expression negatively correlates with eNOS expression. Blocking the hypoxic induction of sONE by RNA interference attenuates the fall in both eNOS RNA and protein. We provide evidence that the induction of sONE primarily involves transcript stabilization rather than increased transcriptional activity and is von Hippel-Lindaubut not hypoxia-inducible factor 2α-dependent. We also demonstrate that sONE transcripts are enriched in the nucleus of normoxic cells and that hypoxia promotes an increase in the level of cytoplasmic and polyribosome-associated, sONE mRNA.

For example, a natural cis-antisense transcript to hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) has been suggested to negatively regulate HIF1α during prolonged hypoxia (2Uchida T. Rossignol F.

Regulation of the sense transcript by antisense RNA can be exerted at the transcriptional, splicing, nuclear export, or translational level. Importantly, antisense transcripts may also regulate the stability of the sense transcript, although the mechanisms implicated have not been defined. Although several orientations between S/AS transcriptional units are possible, tail-to-tail overlaps involving the 3′-UTR predominate (5Sun M. Hurst L.D. Carmichael G.G. Chen J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5533-5543Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Given the prevalence of cis-S/AS interactions, it is vital to understand whether S/AS interactions between 3′-UTR regions are functionally important and to define their mechanisms of regulation. Indeed, trans-S/AS interactions involving microRNAs clearly demonstrate a bias for the 3′-UTR of target mRNAs (6Xie X. Lu J. Kulbokas E.J. Golub T.R. Mootha V. Lindblad-Toh K. Lander E.S. Kellis M. Nature. 2005; 434: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar) and have been demonstrated to regulate both mRNA translation and RNA stability, with the former being especially relevant (7Wu L. Fan J. Belasco J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4034-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). It is possible that functional interactions between S/AS transcripts may result in the generation of short interfering RNA that have the capacity to target either transcript for RNA interference-mediated degradation, although this phenomenon has yet to be directly observed in mammalian cells. A limitation in further understanding these pathways has been the lack of a tractable and biologically relevant model of 3′-UTR cis-S/AS interactions. We recently identified a natural cis-antisense transcriptional unit to eNOS/NOS3 (8Robb G.B. Carson A.R. Tai S.C. Fish J.E. Singh S. Yamada T. Scherer S.W. Nakabayashi K. Marsden P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37982-37996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). sONE, also known as NOS3AS/APG9L2, is oriented tail-to-tail to NOS3, and sONE mRNA is complementary to the eNOS mRNA for 662 nucleotides. This overlap includes portions of the 3′-UTR of the eNOS mRNA. sONE and eNOS mRNA were reciprocally expressed in cultured cells. Relative to endothelial cells, levels of sONE RNA were found to be elevated in nonendothelial cell types, such as vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which express very low basal levels of eNOS RNA (8Robb G.B. Carson A.R. Tai S.C. Fish J.E. Singh S. Yamada T. Scherer S.W. Nakabayashi K. Marsden P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37982-37996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Overexpression of sONE in endothelial cells, which normally express high levels of eNOS but not sONE, resulted in reduced expression of eNOS protein, suggesting that sONE can negatively regulate the expression of eNOS. In contrast, RNA interference-mediated knockdown of sONE in vascular smooth muscle cells resulted in increased expression of eNOS RNA (8Robb G.B. Carson A.R. Tai S.C. Fish J.E. Singh S. Yamada T.

Hypoxic stimulation of endothelial cells markedly decreases the stability of eNOS mRNAs (9McQuillan L.P. Leung G.K. Marsden P.A. Kostyk S.K. Kourembanas S. Am. J.

The molecular mechanisms responsible for the long half-life of the eNOS transcript in normoxic endothelial cells are not fully understood but are mediated, at least in part, by protein binding to the 3′-UTR of the eNOS mRNA (14Alonso J. Sanchez de Miguel L. Monton M. Casado S. Lopez-Farre A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5719-5726Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 15Sanchez de Miguel L. Alonso J.

The mechanisms responsible for alteration of eNOS RNA stability by hypoxia are not known. In light of the potential for sONE to regulate eNOS post-transcriptionally, and considering that eNOS RNA is destabilized by chronic hypoxia, it was of interest to determine if sONE plays a functional role in the hypoxic down-regulation of eNOS. Here we describe robust hypoxic induction of sONE mRNA expression in various cell types in vitro and vascular tissues in vivo. sONE was not induced at the transcriptional level but was up-regulated by post-transcriptional stabilization of the sONE transcript. Additionally, sONE expression was increased in the absence of functional VHL activity, but HIF2α was not involved in sONE induction. Importantly, sONE functionally regulates eNOS expression during hypoxia, since RNA interference-mediated ablation of sONE transcripts resulted in increased levels of eNOS mRNA and protein in the setting of hypoxia. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an antisense RNA playing a functional role in regulating gene expression in response to cellular stimulation. Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultured in M199 (Invitrogen) containing 20% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 17 units/ml heparin, and 0.05 mg/ml endothelial mitogen (Biomedical Technologies Inc., Stoughton, MA), as described previously (17Marsden P.A. Schappert K.T. Chen H.S. Flowers M. Sundell C.L. Wilcox J.N. Lamas S. Michel T. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). VSMC and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC), purchased from Clonetics (Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ), were cultured as recommended by the supplier. Early passage HUVEC (passage 3–4), VSMC (passage 4–8), and MVEC (passage 4–8) derived from multiple donors were used in these studies. Renal clear cell carcinoma epithelial cell lines containing mutant VHL (786-O) stably transfected with hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged wild-type or mutant (C162F) VHL expression cassettes were maintained in RPMI 1640 with GLUTAMAX-I containing G418 and 10% fetal bovine serum, as previously described (18Kibel A. Iliopoulos O. DeCaprio J.A. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Science. 1995; 269: 1444-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). 786-O cells stably transfected with empty vector or an shRNA cassette targeting HIF2α (19Kondo K. Kim W.Y. Lechpammer M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: E83Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing puromycin and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell Treatment and RNA Extraction—Cells were grown in atmospheric O2 (21%) or in a temperature- and humidity-controlled hypoxia chamber (ThermoForma, Marietta, OH). Less than 1% O2 was maintained by the use of Ultra High Purity gas in a sealed chamber (5% CO2, 10% H2, 85% N2; Praxair, Mississauga, ON). To mimic hypoxia, cells were treated with a 140 μm concentration of the iron-chelator desferrioxamine (DFO) (Sigma). After treatment, RNA was extracted as described previously (17Marsden P.A. Schappert K.T. Chen H.S. Flowers M. Sundell C.L. Wilcox J.N. Lamas S. Michel T. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Extraction of Nuclear and Cytoplasmic RNA—Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were generated from normoxic and hypoxic HUVEC. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 units/μl RNaseOUT (Invitrogen)) for 5 min on ice. Nuclei were pelleted at 300 × g for 2 min. RNA was extracted from the supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) and the nuclei pellet using guanidinium-based extraction protocols. Validation of the efficiency of nuclear/cytoplasmic partitioning was performed by quantifying levels of unspliced, pre-mRNAs (see below for primer sequences), which are known to be highly enriched in the nucleus due to their short half-life (20Das R. Dufu K. Romney B. Feldt M. Elenko M. Reed R. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1100-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In Vivo Expression of sONE in Hypoxic Rats—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g) were exposed to 10% O2 for 16 h or 7 days, and RNA was extracted from the descending thoracic aorta, as previously described (21Ward M.E. Toporsian M. Scott J.A. Teoh H. Govindaraju V. Quan A. Wener A.D. Wang G. Bevan S.C. Newton D.C. Marsden P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 3128-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in accordance with the standards of the Canadian Council on Animal Care, and ethics approval was granted by the institutional animal care committee of the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine and St. Michael's Hospital. Determination of RNA Half-life—HUVEC were grown in normoxic or hypoxic conditions for 16 h, after which the RNA polymerase inhibitor DRB (60 μm; Sigma) was added prior to RNA extraction at various time points following transcriptional arrest. 1 h post-DRB addition was used as time 0, and RNA half-life was assessed by quantifying eNOS and sONE RNA levels following transcriptional arrest using real-time RT-PCR (see below). Half-life was estimated by calculating the exponential decay rate of sONE and eNOS RNA using a line-of-best-fit algorithm in Microsoft Excel. Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR—2 μg of total cellular RNA was treated with heparinase (1 unit; Sigma-Aldrich) and DNase I (5 units; Fermenatas; Burlington, ON) and used in first-strand cDNA synthesis using random primers and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. cDNA was diluted to a final volume of 100 μl. All quantitative RT-PCR analyses were performed in triplicate on 2 μl of cDNA using the ABI PRISM 7900 HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using Taqman® or SYBR® green technology (Applied Biosystems), as previously described (8Robb G.B. Carson A.R. Tai S.C. Fish J.E. Singh S. Yamada T. Scherer S.W. Nakabayashi K. Marsden P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37982-37996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) (See Table 1 for primer sequences). Normalization to the reference genes cyclophilin A, TATA-binding protein (TBP), or 18S yielded similar results. Serial 10-fold dilutions of plasmids corresponding to target amplicons were used to develop standard curves so that copy numbers could be deduced by absolute quantification. For the determination of eNOS (exon 11/12) and sONE (exon 7/8) copy numbers, the cycle at which the exponential portion of the amplification curve for 1000 copies of target amplicon passed through the cycle threshold (CT1000) (threshold = 0.2) was 35.3 ± 0.4 and 31.4 ± 0.3 cycles, respectively. Additionally, relative quantification was determined using the ΔΔCT method (22Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124823) Google Scholar) with similar results.TABLE 1Primers used for real time reverse transcription (RT)-PCRGene nameSpeciesForward primer (5′→3′)Reverse primer (5′→3′)ProbeNOS3/eNOSHumanGGC ATC ACC AGG AAG AAG ACCTCA CTC GCT TCG CCA TCA CFAM-CCA ACG CCG TGA AGA TCT CCG C-BHQNOS3AS/sONEHumanCGC CTG ATG AGG AGA AGC CTCT GTG GTC ACC TGA AAC CCTFAM-TGC CTC TAG CCC CAG ACA ACA GTG G-BHQNos3as/sONERatGCT TCA GCT TCC TCC CCA TCC ATCT GGG CGT CTG TGG TCT CCT GCD31HumanCAT ATG CAG ACC TCA GAA TCT ACC AATTG CAA ACC AGA AAC CAC AAA GCD34HumanCAT CAT CTC CCA CTA AAC CCT ATA CACAC TTC TCT GAT GCC TGA ACA TTTVEGFAHumanGCA GAC CAA AGA AAG ATA GAC CAA GCGC CTC GGC TTG TCA CATVegfaRatTCG AGG AAA GGG AAA GGG TCA ATTT GCA GGA ACA TTT ACA CGT CTG CCXCR4HumanCCA GTA GCC ACC GCA TCTATA GTC CCC TGA GCC CAT TTGAPD/GAPDHHumanGAA GGT GAA GGT CGG AGT CGAA GAT GGT GAT GGG ATT TCVIC-CAA GCT TCC CGT TCT CAG CC-BHQCYPA/CycloAHumanGAC GGC GAG CCC TTG GTCT GCT TTT GGG ACC TTG TFAM-CGC GTC TCC TTT GAG CTG TTT GCA-BHQ18S rRNAHumanAGG AAT TGA CGG AAG GGC ACGGA CAT CTA AGG GCA TCA CA18S rRNARatGAC GAT CAG ATA CCG TCG TAG TTCGTT TCA GCT TTG CAA CCA TAC TCCTBPHumanCGC CAG CTT CGG AGA GTT CGCA ATG GTC TTT AGG TCA AGT TTA CATbpRatCCC CTA TCA CTC CTG CCA CAC CCGC AGT TGT TCG TGG CTC TCT TeNOS pre-mRNA (ex14/in14)HumanAGC TGC CCT GAT GGA GAT GTC CCCC AAA CTC TCA CCC AAC TCA CTT GsONE pre-mRNA (ex3/in3)HumanCGC CAC GGA CAC CCT CAGCAA CGG CAC AGG TAG CAA GCA ACD31 pre-mRNA (ex1/in1)HumanGTG CCT GCA GTC TTC ACT CTCAGC TTC GAT GCT CAT GGA GTT ACD34 pre-mRNA (in1/in1)HumanCCC TGC CCA ACC CAC GCA CTGTTC CCC TCC CAC CCC CGT CAG Open table in a new tab Since two distinct sONE transcripts exist, each originating from a unique transcriptional start site (8Robb G.B. Carson A.R. Tai S.C. Fish J.E. Singh S. Yamada T. Scherer S.W. Nakabayashi K. Marsden P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37982-37996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), real time RT-PCR was used to quantify the basal and hypoxia-inducible copy number of each transcript in HUVEC. Primers for the long transcript were located in AS exon 4 (5′-CCT TCG ATG CGT GGA TTA CAA TG-3′ and 5′-GCA CAC TGG GCT GAG GGT AGG A-3′), whereas the exon 7/8 primer set (Table 1) detected total sONE transcripts (i.e. total of short and long transcripts). The copy number of the short sONE transcript was determined by subtracting the number of copies of the long transcript from the total number of transcripts. Copy number was determined by comparison with a standard curve using plasmids containing the amplicon of interest. Since the AS exon 4 primer set does not cross an exon-exon junction, reverse transcriptase-negative samples were used to ensure the absence of contaminating genomic DNA. For quantification of unspliced pre-mRNA, total cellular RNA was reverse transcribed as above. Reactions were also performed in the absence of reverse transcriptase to ensure the absence of genomic DNA contamination. Genomic contamination was routinely <5% of the total signal. Primer sequences are located in Table 1. For quantification of rat sONE expression in hypoxic rat tissues, 2 μg of RNA was used for first-strand synthesis using random hexamers, and cDNA was diluted to 100 μl. Primers for real time RT-PCR analysis were designed to a conserved region of rat sONE (Table 1). In addition, rat VEGF-A, 18S, and TBP levels were determined (Table 1). The ΔΔCT method (22Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124823) Google Scholar) was used to determine the change in sONE and VEGF expression, relative to 18S and TBP. RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—ChIP was performed as described previously (23Fish J.E. Matouk C.C. Rachlis A. Lin S. Tai S.C. D'Abreo C. Marsden P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24824-24838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). 5 μg of anti-Pol II antibody (N-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was added per immunoprecipitation, and control immunoprecipitations containing no antibody were performed in parallel. Pol II and control immunoprecipitated DNA was suspended in 40 μl of water. An input sample (18 μl of 1800 μl total) was removed prior to immunoprecipitation. The cross-links were reversed, and the input sample was diluted 1:10. Primers were directed to sONE exon 3 to detect transcription of both the long and short sONE transcripts (Table 1, sONE pre-mRNA primers). Primers used to amplify the hypoxia response element (HRE) of the VEGF-A promoter (-934 to -785) were 5′-CTA ACC CCG GAA CCA CAC AGC-3′ and 5′-CTG GCC TGC AGA CAT CAA AGT G-3′. The number of copies of the sONE exon 3 amplicon or the VEGF HRE amplicon were determined in 2 μl of bound chromatin, 2 μl of a no antibody control, and 2 μl of a diluted input sample using serial dilutions of genomic DNA. Immunoprecipitated (IP) DNA was calculated by subtracting the number of copies in the no antibody control from the bound chromatin and dividing by input. sONE RNA Interference—Three Stealth™ small interfering RNAs (siRNA) duplexes were designed to recognize a region in common with the long and short sONE transcripts (Invitrogen). sONE 414 (sense, GGG ACA UCU GUU CCU UUG CCC UUA U; antisense, AUA AGG GCA AAG GAA CAG AUG UCC C) targets exon 3 of the sONE transcript, whereas sONE 513 (sense, AGG ACG GCA AGA CUG AGC UUU CUU U; antisense, AAA GAA AGC UCA GUC UUG CCG UCC U) and sONE 579 (sense, GGC ACA GCU CUA AGU UUC UUG GGC A; antisense, UGC CCA AGA AAC UUA GAG CUG UGC C) target exon 4 of sONE. 40 nm sONE siRNA was transfected into 90% confluent HUVEC grown on 60-mm gelatin-coated tissue culture plates using 33 μl of Oligofectamine™ transfection reagent (Invitrogen) in a total volume of 2000 μl. A 40 nm concentration of a GC-matched control (Stealth™ RNA interference negative control medium GC; Invitrogen) was transfected into parallel plates. Following 3 h of transfection at 37 °C in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen), M199 medium (Invitrogen) containing fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), heparin, and endothelial cell growth supplement (Biomedical Technologies) was added. Cells were cultured for 18 h and were then transferred to the hypoxia chamber and grown for an additional 24 h, after which RNA and protein were extracted. Western Blots—Western blotting was performed using 20 μg of total cellular protein samples as in Ref. 24Wang Y. Goligorsky M.S. Lin M. Wilcox J.N. Marsden P.A. J. Biol.

Lamin A/C (1:100 dilution; mouse monoclonal IgM, anti-lamin A/C (sc-346; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), β-actin (1:200 dilution; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat polyclonal IgG, anti-actin (sc-1615; Santa Cruz Biotechnology)), or α-tubulin (1:5000 dilution; mouse monoclonal, anti-α-tubulin (T-5168); Sigma)) Western blots were used as loading controls. eNOS was detected using an anti-eNOS antibody (C-20) (1:200 dilution; rabbit polyclonal IgG; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). HIF2α was detected using an anti-HIF2α antibody (ab13704) (1:1000 dilution; rabbit polyclonal IgG; Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO). HA-tagged VHL was detected using an anti-HA antibody (12CA5) (1:250 dilution; mouse monoclonal; Roche Applied Science). Goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (1:3000 dilution; catalog number 12-348; Upstate Biotechnology) was used as a secondary antibody for eNOS and HIF2α Western blots, and goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (1:3000; catalog number 172-1011; Bio-Rad) was used as a secondary for lamin A/C, tubulin, and HA Western blots. SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and the Fluor-S Max Multi-Imager (model 170-772; Bio-Rad) were used for signal analysis.

Briefly, normoxic and hypoxic HUVEC were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) and harvested in lysis buffer (100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, and 1000 units/ml RNaseOUT (Invitrogen)) at room temperature. Cellular extracts were passed through a 27-gauge needle, and the nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 4 °C, 5 min). The supernatant was centrifuged again (12,000 × g, 4 °C, 5 min) to remove residual cellular debris, and the resulting supernatant was layered onto 10-ml sucrose gradients (15–45%). Following ultracentrifugation (SW Ti 41 rotor, 35,000 rpm, 4 °C, 2 h) (Beckman), 12–15 fractions (750 μl) were collected using a programmable density gradient fraction collector (Isco; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with continuous spectrophotometric measurements at A254 nm. RNA was extracted from each of the fractions using guanidinium-based protocols. All of the RNA from each fraction was DNase-treated and reverse transcribed using random hexamers and diluted to a final volume of 50 μl. Statistical Analysis—Unless otherwise indicated, all results are the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. One-way analysis of variance with a Newmann-Keuls post hoc test or a paired t test was used, as appropriate. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. sONE mRNA Is Hypoxia-inducible and Is Reciprocally Expressed with eNOS mRNA in Endothelial Cells—sONE and eNOS were previously found to exhibit reciprocal expression patterns in endothelial and nonendothelial cells (8Robb G.B. Carson A.R. Tai S.C. Fish J.E. Singh S. Yamada T. Scherer S.W. Nakabayashi K. Marsden P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37982-37996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We suggested that this was due, in part, to the post-transcriptional down-regulation of eNOS by sONE in nonendothelial cells. We were interested in assessing whether sONE could be up-regulated in endothelial cells by stimuli that are known to decrease the stability of eNOS mRNA. Therefore, we measured steady-state levels of sONE RNA in hypoxic endothelial cells, since hypoxic stimulation of HUVEC decreases eNOS RNA levels, in part by post-transcriptional mechanisms (9McQuillan L.P. Leung G.K. Marsden P.A. Kostyk S.K. Kourembanas S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H1921-H1927PubMed Google Scholar). Hypoxia can be mimicked by treating cells with DFO (26Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Blood. 1993; 82: 3610-3615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Endothelial cells (HUVEC) were treated with DFO for various periods of time, and expression of eNOS and sONE was monitored by real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 1A). Basal levels of eNOS and sONE mRNA are shown in Table 2. VEGF mRNA, which is known to be up-regulated by DFO and is a highly hypoxia-inducible transcript (27Gleadle J.M. Ebert B.L. Firth J.D. Ratcliffe P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1362-C1368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was measured in parallel as a control (Fig. 1A). We found that eNOS steady-state mRNA levels modestly increased with short term exposure to DFO (1–4 h) but then dramatically decreased after 24 h of DFO treatment. eNOS levels declined to ∼30 and 20% of the mRNA levels of control HUVEC following 24- and 48-h treatment with DFO, respectively. The observed kinetics of eNOS expression was consistent with previously reported findings (28Coulet F. Nadaud S. Agrapart M. Soubrier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46230-46240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Importantly, we observed that sONE gene expression was reciprocal in nature to the expression of eNOS. sONE gene expression began to increase after 2 h of DFO treatment and reached a maximum following 24 h of treatment, when mRNA levels increased more than 15-fold with respect to levels in control HUVEC. We have shown previously that treatment of endothelial cells with the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A, up-regulates sONE RNA and that this is followed by a decrease in the levels of eNOS RNA (8Robb G.B.

https://openalex.org/W1979095700,"O-Linked GlcNAc modification of nuclear and cytosolic proteins has been shown to regulate the function of many cellular proteins. Increased O-linked glycosylation, observed under chronic hyperglycemia conditions, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes. However, the exact role of O-GlcNAc modification in regulating glucose homeostasis remains to be established. We report here that the subcellular localization of the pancreatic beta cell-specific transcription factor NeuroD1 is regulated by O-linked glycosylation in the mouse insulinoma cell line MIN6. Under low glucose conditions, NeuroD1 is mainly in the cytosol. However, treatment of MIN6 cells with high glucose results in O-linked GlcNAc modification of NeuroD1 and its subsequent translocation into the nucleus. Consistent with these data, treatment of MIN6 cells with O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene)-amino N-phenylcarbamate, an inhibitor of O-GlcNAcase, causes Neuro-D1 localization to the nucleus and induction of insulin gene expression even on low glucose. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NeuroD1 interacts with the O-GlcNAc transferase, OGT only at high concentrations of glucose and depletion of OGT by using small interfering RNA oligos interferes with the nuclear localization of NeuroD1 on high glucose. On low glucose NeuroD1 interacts with the O-GlcNAcase and becomes deglycosylated, which is likely to be important for export of Neuro-D1 into cytosol in the presence of low glucose.

Defects in insulin production are associated with Type 1 as well as Type 2 diabetes. Induction of insulin gene transcription in response to elevated blood glucose levels plays an important role in maintaining normoglycemia.

NeuroD1 plays an important role also in the development of the nervous system and can convert epidermal cells to neurons in Xenopus (9Lee J.E. Hollenberg S.M. Snider L. Turner D.L. Lipnick N.

Although, NeuroD1 is important for stimulation of insulin gene expression, the exact mechanism by which NeuroD1 activates transcription in pancreatic beta cells is unknown.

A role for O-GlcNAc modification in regulation of gene transcription is evident from the fact that several transcription factors including c-Myc and p53 are modified by O-linked Glc-NAc (14Hart G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 18Wells L. Vosseller K. Hart G.W. Science. 2001; 291: 2376-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). In addition, the CTD domain of RNA polymerase II is also modified by O-GlcNAc in a reciprocal manner with phosphorylation (14Hart G.W. Annu. Rev.

In the case of transcription factors Sp1 and the estrogen receptor, O-GlcNAc modification has been shown to modulate their turnover rate and ability to undergo protein-protein interactions (24Roos M.D. Su K.

It has been previously suggested that O-linked GlcNAc modification plays a role in the assembly of protein complexes. Consistent with this idea OGT has been found in a complex with the co-repressors Hdac1 and mSin3A in the liver cell line HepG2 and is required for repression of gene expression by this complex (28Yang X. Zhang F. Kudlow J.E. Cell. 2002; 110: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 29Alland L. Muhle R. Hou Jr., H. Potes J. Chin L. Schreiber-Agus N. DePinho R.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that elevation of O-linked GlcNAc protein modification results in symptoms associated with diabetes. First, overexpression of OGT in muscle and fat results in insulin resistance and hyperleptinemia (30Vosseller K. Wells L. Lane M.D. Hart G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5313-5318Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 31McClain D.A. Lubas W.A. Cooksey R.C. Hazel M. Parker G. Love D.C. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Second, overexpression of glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc is a substrate for OGT) in various tissues, demonstrates an important role for this pathway in glucose- and satiety-sensing (32Cooksey R.C. McClain D.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 967: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Third, chronic hyperglycemia is associated with increased levels of O-linked GlcNAc modification in pancreatic beta cells (21Liu K. Paterson J. Chin E. Kudlow J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2820-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 34Kaneto H. Xu G. Song K-H. Suzuma K. Bonner-Weir S. Sharma A. Weir G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31099-31104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism(s) by which increased levels of O-linked GlcNAc modification leads to diabetes is unknown. In this report we demonstrate that high concentrations of glucose mediate the O-linked GlcNAc modification of the transcription factor NeuroD1 in pancreatic beta cells, leading to its translocation from the cytosol into the nucleus and thereby, to the activation of insulin gene expression. These findings contribute to the understanding of how O-GlcNAc modification regulates pancreatic beta cell function and insulin gene transcription. Cell Culture—Mouse insulinoma 6 (MIN6) cells of passage 22 through 35 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media containing 25 mm glucose, 15% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 μm β-mercaptoethanol (35Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Oka Y. Yamamura K. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). For the glucose regulation experiments, MIN6 cells were grown overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media with 25 mm glucose and then washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and transferred to low (3 mm) or high (30 mm) glucose containing media for the indicated times. Cells were treated with the following chemicals: 100 μm O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene)-amino N-phenylcarbamate (PUGNAc) (Toronto Research Chemicals Inc.), 20 μm 6-diazo-5-oxonorleucine (DON), and 2 mm glucosamine. The last two chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Construction and Electroporation of Plasmids—For generation of the enhanced green flourescent protein (EGFP)-NeuroD1 fusion construct, the full-length hamster NeuroD1 cDNA was amplified by PCR using the primers: OS269 (forward primer, starts at nucleotide +2 with HindIII site attached (underlined)), CCCAAGCTTTGACCAAATCATACAGCGAG), and OS270 (reverse primer, starts at Stop with BamHI site attached (underlined)), CGGGATCCCTAATCGTGAAAGATGGCATTG). After restriction with HindIII and BamHI, the PCR product was subcloned into the EGFP-C1 vector (Clontech). Following purification, 10–50 μg of plasmid was introduced into MIN6 cells by electroporation using Gene-Pulser II (Bio-Rad). The electroporation was performed with potential difference of 0.25 KV and 650 microfarad capacitance. The efficiency of electroporation was 40–70%. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Chromatin isolation was performed as previously described (36Mosley A.L. Özcan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19660-19666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 37Wells J. Farnham P.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The NeuroD1 antibodies used for immunoprecipitation in ChIP assays were from Santa Cruz (sc-1086). Real time PCR amplification was performed using the Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR Master Mixture according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene) using the machine Mx4000 (Stratagene). The primers used were GAAGGTCTCACCTTCTGG and GGGGGTTACTGGATGCC for the mouse insulin I promoter (from -10 to -281). Each PCR was performed in duplicates at least two independent times for each sample. The PCR products obtained with the immunoprecipitated DNA were normalized to the products obtained with the total input DNA. Preparation of Cell Extracts, Co-immunoprecipitation Assays, and Western Blot Analysis—Cell extracts from MIN6 cells were prepared in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitors). Co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed with about 0.5 to 1 mg of MIN6 whole cell extracts as described previously (38Andrali S.S. März P. Özcan S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 337: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The antibodies used in this study are: NeuroD1 (sc-1086, Santa Cruz), CTD 110.6 (MMS-248R, Covance Research Products), RL2 (MA1–076, Affinity Bioreagents), histone H3 (382157, Calbiochem), OGT (38Andrali S.S. März P. Özcan S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 337: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), O-GlcNAcase and thiolase (kindly provided by Dr. Whiteheart, University of Kentucky). Immunohistochemical Analysis—MIN-6 cells were grown on acid washed coverslips. Cells were fixed in para-formaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton as described previously (39Elrick L.J. Docherty K. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2244-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Then, the cells were incubated in secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes). Coverslips were mounted using Vectashield containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to visualize the cell nuclei. GFP-NeuroD1 and OGT were visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica). Nuclear Fractionation—Cells were grown to 70% confluence and resuspended in 1 ml of isolation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 320 mm sucrose, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors). The cells were lysed using a Dounce homogenizer (about 40–50 strokes) and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 7 min at 4 °C. The pellets containing the nuclei were washed 3 times in 1 ml of isolation buffer and resuspended in 200 μl of isolation buffer. After addition of 0.1% Triton X-100, the samples were sonicated for about 12 s at 10% amplitude. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA and poly(A) RNA were isolated as described previously (40Vanderford N.L. Andrali S.S. Özcan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1577-1584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The poly(A) RNA was reverse transcribed using Enhanced avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Sigma). The resulting cDNAs were used as template for PCR with oligonucleotides to amplify the insulin I and β-actin genes. The primers used were CCTGTTGGTGCACTTCCTAC and TGCAGTAGTTCTCCAGCTGC for the mouse insulin I gene (41Roderigo-Milne H. Hauge-Evans A.C. Persaud S.J. Jones P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and CGTGGGCCGCCCTAGGCAACC and TTGGCCTTAGGGTTCAGGGGGG for the β-actin gene (42Rout U.K. Armant D.R. Reprod. Toxicol. 2002; 16: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The PCR amplification conditions are the same as described previously (40Vanderford N.L. Andrali S.S. Özcan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1577-1584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Electroporation of siRNA Oligos—OGT and negative control (Silencer® negative control 1) siRNA oligos were purchased from Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX). The transfection of the siRNA oligos into MIN6 cells was carried out as described previously (40Vanderford N.L. Andrali S.S. Özcan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1577-1584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, a total of 2 μg of siRNAs per 2 × 106 MIN6 cells and 50 μg of NeuroD1-GFP construct were co-transfected using the transfection reagent Nucleofector kit (Amaxa Inc.) and the Nucleofector II Device (Amaxa Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 60 h after transfection, cells were treated with 30 mm glucose without serum, and afterward fixed with para-formaldehyde to detect OGT levels and NeuroD1-GFP localization by immunofluorescence microscopy. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was carried out using the two-tailed, unpaired Student's t test. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. NeuroD1 Binds to the Insulin Promoter Mainly on High Glucose—Because NeuroD1 is one of the transcription factors important for glucose regulation of insulin gene expression, we tested whether changes in glucose levels affect NeuroD1 binding to the insulin promoter. We analyzed the binding of NeuroD1 to the insulin I promoter by using the ChIP assay with NeuroD1 antibodies in MIN6 cells incubated with 3 or 30 mm glucose (Fig. 1A). NeuroD1 was associated with the insulin I promoter mainly on high glucose in the insulinoma cell line MIN6 (Fig. 1A). NeuroD1 binding to the insulin promoter was very weak in low glucose-incubated MIN6 cells. Quantification of NeuroD1 binding by real time PCR indicated a 6-fold increase in NeuroD1 binding to the insulin I promoter in MIN6 cells incubated with 30 mm glucose (Fig. 1B). Glucose Causes Changes in Subcellular Localization of NeuroD1—In Fig. 1A we have demonstrated that NeuroD1 binds to the insulin I promoter mainly at high concentrations of glucose. This may be due to changes in DNA binding affinity, expression levels, or subcellular localization of NeuroD1 in response to glucose. To address this issue, we first analyzed the levels of NeuroD1 protein in low and high glucose-incubated MIN6 cells. However, we could not detect any significant differences in NeuroD1 protein levels in MIN6 cells incubated with low versus high glucose (supplemental Fig. S1A). Next, we investigated whether glucose regulates the subcellular localization of NeuroD1 and thereby determines its access to the insulin promoter. To test this idea, we generated a GFP-NeuroD1 fusion construct, in which the enhanced GFP protein was attached to the amino terminus of NeuroD1. After transfection of the GFP-NeuroD1 construct into the MIN6 cell line, the cells were incubated on low or high glucose for varying times and the subcellular localization of NeuroD1 was determined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1C). We found that NeuroD1 was mainly cytosolic in MIN6 cells incubated with low glucose and nuclear in cells exposed to high glucose (Fig. 1C, first and second rows). High concentrations of l-glucose did not affect NeuroD1 localization (Fig. 1C, third row), indicating that the translocation of NeuroD1 into the nucleus on high glucose was not due to osmotic stress. After counting the number of cells with nuclear localization of NeuroD1, we found that about 80% of the high glucose-incubated MIN6 cells displayed an almost complete nuclear localization of NeuroD1, whereas in the remaining 20% of cells NeuroD1 was localized both in the cytosol and nucleus (supplemental Fig. S1B). In low glucose-incubated MIN6 cells, about 35% of the cells displayed both nuclear and cytosolic localization of NeuroD1 and in about 65% of the cells NeuroD1 was solely in the cytosol (supplemental Fig. S1B). Complete nuclear localization of NeuroD1 was observed in less than 1% of low glucose-incubated cells. Nuclear localization of NeuroD1 was increased in MIN6 cells starting at 5 mm glucose and more than 60% of cells treated with 15 mm glucose displayed a mainly nuclear localization of NeuroD1. In MIN6 cells incubated with 20–40 mm pyruvate and 1 μm insulin or 50 mm KCl in the presence of low glucose, NeuroD1 was mainly localized in the cytosol (data not shown). These data suggest that exposure to high glucose causes NeuroD1 to translocate from the cytosol into the nucleus and that this translocation event occurs independent of the changes in ATP and insulin secretion levels. Nuclear Localization of NeuroD1 on High Glucose Is Mediated by the Hexosamine Biosynthetic Pathway—The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) has been suggested to be a sensor of glucose levels inside the cell. To determine whether this pathway was important for nuclear localization of NeuroD1, we increased the UDP-GlcNAc levels on low glucose by incubating the MIN6 cells with glucosamine. In addition, we blocked the synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc by inhibiting the first and rate-limiting enzyme l-glutamine:d-fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase of this pathway using DON. Treatment of MIN6 cells with glucosamine resulted in translocation of NeuroD1 into the nucleus even on low glucose (Fig. 2A). Whereas 40% of the low glucose-treated cells displayed both nuclear and cytosolic localization of NeuroD1, in 70% of the low glucose and glucosamine-treated cells, NeuroD1 was almost completely localized to the nucleus (supplemental Fig. S2). Inhibition of glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase with DON blocked the nuclear translocation of NeuroD1 on high glucose (Fig. 2B). After treatment with DON the number of cells with nuclear-localized NeuroD1 drastically decreased and in about 55% of the cells NeuroD1 was localized partly in the nucleus and cytosol compared with high glucose grown cells without DON treatment, where 80% of the cells showed almost a complete nuclear localization of NeuroD1 (supplemental Fig. S3A). The addition of 2 mm glucosamine to MIN6 cells incubated with high glucose in the presence of the glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase inhibitor DON restored the nuclear localization of NeuroD1 (supplemental Fig. S3B). Almost 50% of the cells showed both nuclear and cytosolic localization of NeuroD1 when treated with high glucose and DON. However, after addition of glucosamine to high glucose and DON-treated cells, NeuroD1 was almost exclusively localized to the nucleus in 75% of the cells, whereas only 25% of the cells displayed both nuclear and cytosolic localization (supplemental Fig. S3A). These data clearly indicate that the flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway determines the subcellular localization of NeuroD1. Increased O-Linked Glycosylation Levels Mediate the Nuclear Localization of NeuroD1 Independent of Glucose—We found that increased flux through the HBP causes the nuclear localization of NeuroD1. The end product of the HBP (UDP-GlcNAc) is used as substrate for O-linked GlcNAcylation, which can regulate the subcellular localization of transcription factors. Therefore, we tested the role of O-GlcNAc modification in nuclear localization of NeuroD1 in response to high glucose. MIN6 cells transfected with the GFP-NeuroD1 construct were treated with 100 μm PUGNAc, which inhibits the activity of the O-linked glucosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase) and thereby increases O-linked glycosylation of proteins. As shown in Fig. 3A, NeuroD1 was mainly localized to the nucleus in low glucose-incubated MIN6 cells treated with PUGNAc. 80% of the MIN6 cells treated with low glucose and PUGNAc displayed a complete nuclear localization of NeuroD1 (supplemental Fig. S4). Although about 40% of the low glucose-incubated MIN6 cells showed a partial localization of NeuroD1 to the nucleus, the number of cells where NeuroD1 could only be found in the nucleus was less than 1% (supplemental Fig. S4). Using the GFP-NeuroD1 construct we could demonstrate that high glucose or increased O-GlcNAc modification (low glucose with PUGNAc) causes NeuroD1 to translocate from the cytosol into the nucleus. To test whether the endogenous NeuroD1 protein also changed its localization in a glucose and O-linked glycosylation dependent manner, MIN6 cells were treated with high or low glucose in the presence or absence of PUGNAc. Following these treatments, nuclear fractions were isolated and immunoblotted with NeuroD1 antibodies (Fig. 3B). Whereas only a small amount of endogenous NeuroD1 was present in the nucleus when cells were incubated with low glucose, the level of nuclear NeuroD1 significantly increased after treatment with high glucose or low glucose with PUGNAc (Fig. 3B). These data demonstrate that the subcellular localization of endogenous NeuroD1 changes in response to glucose similarly as observed with the GFP-NeuroD1 fusion protein. Because treatment of MIN6 cells with PUGNAc caused NeuroD1 to localize to the nucleus even in the presence of low glucose, we analyzed the binding of NeuroD1 to the insulin I promoter after treatment with PUGNAc using the ChIP assay (Fig. 3C). We found that endogenous NeuroD1 was able to bind to the insulin I promoter in MIN6 cells incubated with low glucose in the presence of PUGNAc, indicating that nuclear localization of NeuroD1 is sufficient for its binding to the insulin I promoter. NeuroD1 Is O-GlcNAc Modified in MIN6 Cells Treated with High Glucose—The data obtained with PUGNAc-treated MIN6 cells suggest that nuclear localization of NeuroD1 in the presence of high glucose requires an O-linked glycosylation event. Therefore, we first tested whether NeuroD1 itself was directly modified by O-linked glycosylation. For this purpose, MIN6 cells were incubated with low or high glucose containing media. After lysis of the cells, the obtained protein extracts were used for immunoprecipitation experiments with the NeuroD1 antibody. The immunoprecipitated proteins were then immunoblotted with CTD 110.6 (Fig. 4A) or RL2 (Fig. 4B) antibodies, which recognize O-GlcNAc moieties on proteins. Using these two different antibodies, we found that NeuroD1 was O-linked GlcNAc modified only in high glucose-incubated MIN6 cells. Furthermore, treatment of low glucose-incubated MIN6 cells with PUGNAc also led to the O-GlcNAc modification of NeuroD1 (Fig. 4). We also carried out the reverse co-immunoprecipitation assay in which we first immunoprecipitated all of the O-Glc-NAc-modified proteins using the RL2 antibody and immunoblotted for NeuroD1 protein. Consistent with our previous co-immunoprecipitation experiment, NeuroD1 was O-GlcNAc modified mainly on high glucose (supplemental Fig. S5). NeuroD1 Interacts with OGT on High Glucose and with O-GlcNAcase on Low Glucose—Our data suggest that NeuroD1 becomes O-GlcNAc modified and translocates into the nucleus in response to high glucose, whereas on low glucose, NeuroD1 is deglycosylated and exits the nucleus. Thus, we determined the interaction of NeuroD1 with OGT and O-GlcNAcase in the presence of low (3 mm) or high (30 mm) glucose. We first immunoprecipitated OGT (Fig. 5A) or O-GlcNAcase (Fig. 5B) from protein extracts and blotted the immunoprecipitated proteins with NeuroD1 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5, NeuroD1 interacts with OGT mainly on high glucose (Fig. 5B) and with O-GlcNAcase only on low glucose (Fig. 5B). A reverse co-immunoprecipitation assay in which we immunoprecipitated NeuroD1 with specific antibodies first and blotted with antibodies against OGT or O-GlcNAcase yielded similar results (supplemental Fig. S6). O-GlcNAc Modification of NeuroD1 by OGT Is Essential for Its Nuclear Localization in the Presence of High Glucose—To confirm the role of O-GlcNAc modification in glucose-regulated nuclear translocation of NeuroD1, we utilized siRNA oligos to knockdown the expression of OGT. As demonstrated in Fig. 6, NeuroD1 is localized to the nucleus in MIN6 cells transfected with a random siRNA oligo after treatment with high glucose. However, depletion of OGT by siRNA treatment blocks the nuclear localization of NeuroD1 by high glucose (Fig. 6). NeuroD1 was exclusively localized to the nucleus in 70% of the MIN6 cells transfected with the random siRNA oligo and incubated on high glucose. The remaining 30% of cells had both nuclear and cytosolic localization of NeuroD1 (supplemental Fig. S7). After transfection of the OGT siRNA oligos, NeuroD1 was found in both the nucleus and cytosol in 47% of the cells and in the remaining 53% of the cells NeuroD1 was mainly in the cytosol, when cells were treated with high glucose (supplemental Fig. S7). Treatment with PUGNAc in the Presence of Low Glucose Increases Insulin Gene Expression—We have demonstrated that NeuroD1 is localized to the nucleus also in low glucose-treated MIN6 cells in the presence of PUGNAc, which is an inhibitor of O-GlcNAcase and increases the level of O-GlcNAc-modified proteins. To test whether the nuclear localization of NeuroD1 on low glucose by PUGNAc treatment is sufficient to increase insulin gene expression, we treated low glucose-incubated MIN6 cells with or without PUGNAc and quantified insulin I mRNA levels using real time reverse transcriptase-PCR (Fig. 7). We observed a 3-fold increase in insulin I mRNA levels in low glucose-incubated MIN6 cells after treatment with PUGNAc, which was similar to the insulin I mRNA levels observed with high glucose-incubated MIN6 cells (Fig. 7). In this report we demonstrate that the insulin gene transcription factor NeuroD1 is O-linked GlcNAc modified in response to high concentrations of glucose, which causes its translocation from the cytosol into the nucleus to activate insulin gene transcription. On low glucose, NeuroD1 interacts with O-GlcNAcase and becomes deglycosylated, which is likely to be required for its nuclear export. Consistent with these data, treatment of MIN6 cells with PUGNAc (an inhibitor of O-Glc-NAcase) leads to O-GlcNAc modification of NeuroD1 even on low glucose and to its translocation to the nucleus and increased insulin gene expression on low glucose. Moreover, depletion of OGT, which is responsible for O-linked GlcNAc modification of proteins by using siRNA oligos in MIN6 cells, blocks the nuclear localization of NeuroD1 in response to high glucose. This demonstrates the importance of O-GlcNAc modification of NeuroD1 for its translocation into the nucleus. Consistent with this idea, the effects of high glucose on NeuroD1 localization can be mimicked by treatment of low glucose-incubated MIN6 cells with glucosamine. This again suggests an important role for the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway and O-linked GlcNAc modification in regulation of NeuroD1 localization. Changes in subcellular localization following O-GlcNAc modification has been demonstrated for several transcription factors (43Zachara N.E. Hart G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 599-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 44Guinez C. Morelle W. Michalski J.C. Lefebvre T. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 37: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The transcription factor Elf-1, which is expressed in hematopoietic cells has been shown to contain O-GlcNAc modification when it is in the nucleus (45Juang Y.T. Solomou E.E. Rellahan B. Tsokos G.C. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2865-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Stat5, another transcription factor that mediates the induction of interferon gene expression is also O-GlcNAc modified and only the nuclear form of Stat5 has this modification after cytokine activation (46Gewinner C. Hart G. Zachara N. Cole R. Beisenherz-Huss C. Groner B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3563-3572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Furthermore, nuclear localization of transcription factors c-Myc, Tau, Sp1, and Pax-6 has been shown to correlate with O-GlcNAc modification of these proteins (47Kamemura K. Hayes B.K. Comer F.I.

Biochem. 2005; 96: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The unmodified form of these transcription factors appears to be mainly localized in the cytosol. These observations are consistent with our data obtained with the GFP-NeuroD1 fusion construct as well as with endogenous NeuroD1 using nuclear fractionation, which indicate that NeuroD1 becomes translocated into the nucleus after O-linked GlcNAc modification in response to high glucose. NeuroD1 has been reported to be phosphorylated as well as acetylated by the histone acetyltransferase p300. Acetylation of NeuroD1 appears to be important for its binding to the insulin promoter, but it is not clear if the acetylation of NeuroD1 occurs in the cytosol or nucleus (51Qiu Y. Guo M. Huang S. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9796-9802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is likely that NeuroD1 becomes acetylated only if it is in the nucleus. We demonstrate in this report that NeuroD1 translocates into the nucleus and binds to the insulin promoter on low glucose, after treatment of the cells with PUGNAc, which keeps NeuroD1 glycosylated even on low glucose. These findings suggest that NeuroD1 binding to the insulin promoter is not regulated by high glucose because we observe binding on low glucose with PUGNAc treatment. Therefore, we propose that once NeuroD1 is in the nucleus it becomes acetylated by p300, which increases its binding affinity for the insulin promoter, leading to activation of insulin gene transcription. Our data indicate that the nuclear localization of NeuroD1 by O-GlcNAc modification in the presence of high glucose requires the HBP. This finding is not surprising given the fact that flux through HBP is required to synthesize UDP-GlcNAc, which is the substrate used by OGT to modify proteins by O-GlcNAcylation. Consistent with these data, depletion of OGT levels by siRNA treatment caused cytosolic localization of NeuroD1 in MIN6 cells incubated with 30 mm glucose. Flux through the HBP has been suggested to serve as a signal for nutritional status of a cell and therefore the HBP has been implicated to regulate many cellular processes (52Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53Rossetti L. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1922-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 54McClain D.A. J. Diabetes Complications. 2002; 16: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 55Buse M.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: E1-E8Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). In agreement with the idea that increased flux through the HBP is required for the nuclear localization of NeuroD1 and thereby for activation of insulin gene expression, addition of glucosamine to MIN6 cells in the presence of low glucose causes the translocation of NeuroD1 into the nucleus. Furthermore, treatment with PUGNAc in the absence of high glucose induces insulin gene expression similar to levels observed under high glucose conditions. Although, our data are consistent with the idea that high glucose mediates the O-GlcNAc modification of NeuroD1 and its translocation into the nucleus, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that O-linked GlcNAc modification of another protein involved in glucose signaling or nuclear import may be involved in nuclear localization of NeuroD1. To demonstrate the importance of O-linked GlcNAc modification of NeuroD1 for its nuclear translocation in response to high glucose, it is necessary to identify and mutate the modification site(s) on NeuroD1. The translocation of NeuroD1 from the cytosol into the nucleus in response to high glucose has been previously reported (56Petersen H.V. Jensen J.N. Stein R. Serup P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown that inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by using the MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase) inhibitor PD98059 disrupts the translocation of NeuroD1 into the nucleus. Moreover, mutating serine 274 in NeuroD1 into alanine resulted in accumulation of NeuroD1 in the cytosol (56Petersen H.V. Jensen J.N. Stein R. Serup P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). From these data it was concluded that phosphorylation of Ser274 in NeuroD1 is required for its translocation into the nucleus. Interestingly, the same Ser274 residue in NeuroD1 is predicted to be one of the high potential O-GlcNAc modification sites (57Julenius K. Mólgaard A. Gupta R. Brunak S. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). If NeuroD1 becomes O-GlcNAc modified by high glucose at Ser274, then mutating this site to alanine would abolish the translocation of NeuroD1 into the nucleus as reported (56Petersen H.V. Jensen J.N. Stein R. Serup P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that O-GlcNAc modification of Ser274 is involved in regulation of NeuroD1 localization. We have recently shown that increased flux through the HBP is required for glucose induction of MafA expression in the pancreatic beta cell line MIN6 (40Vanderford N.L. Andrali S.S. Özcan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1577-1584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Like NeuroD1, MafA is also a beta cell-specific transcription factor required for insulin gene expression. Moreover, previous data indicate that Pdx-1, another beta cell-specific insulin gene transcription factor is also modified by O-linked GlcNAcylation, which appears to regulate the ability of Pdx-1 to bind to the insulin gene promoter (33Gao Y. Miyazaki J. Hart G.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 415: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that HBP and O-linked glycosylation play an important role in modulation of the function of insulin gene transcription factors mediated by changes in glucose levels. Thus, the flux through HBP and O-linked glycosylation appear to be major sensors of glucose in pancreatic beta cells and regulate insulin gene transcription and beta cell function by glucose. In summary, the data presented in this report demonstrate that high concentrations of glucose mediate the O-GlcNAc modification of NeuroD1 via its interaction with OGT resulting in NeuroD1 localization to the nucleus and activation of insulin gene expression. On low glucose, NeuroD1 interacts with O-GlcNAcase and becomes deglycosylated and exits the nucleus. These findings contribute to our understanding of how O-linked GlcNAc modification regulates pancreatic beta cell function. We thank Dr. Miyazaki for the MIN6 cell line and Drs. Tsao and Stein for the CMV-NeuroD1 construct, and Dr. Whiteheart and Garland Crawford for the O-GlcNAcase and thiolase antibody. We also thank Tiffany Nolan for excellent technical assistance.

https://openalex.org/W2139938582,Targeting gene therapy remains a challenge. The use of magnetic force to achieve this was investigated in the present study. It was hypothesized that nanoparticles with both controllable particle size and magnetic properties would enable magnetically driven gene delivery. We investigated this hypothesis by creating a family of novel biodegradable polymeric superparamagnetic nanoparticle (MNP) formulations. Polylactide MNP were formulated using a modified emulsification-solvent evaporation methodology with both the incorporation of oleate-coated iron oxide and a polyethylenimine (PEI) oleate ion-pair surface modification for DNA binding. MNP size could be controlled by varying the proportion of the tetrahydrofuran cosolvent. Magnetically driven MNP-mediated gene transfer was studied using a green fluorescent protein reporter plasmid in cultured arterial smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. MNP-DNA internalization and trafficking were examined by confocal microscopy. Cell growth inhibition after MNP-mediated adiponectin plasmid transfection was studied as an example of a therapeutic end point. MNP-DNA complexes protected DNA from degradation and efficiently transfected quiescent cells under both low and high serum conditions after a 15 min exposure to a magnetic field (500 G). There was negligible transfection with MNP in the absence of a magnetic field. Larger sized MNP (375 nm diameter) exhibited higher transfection rates compared with 185 nm- and 240 nm-sized MNP. Internalized larger sized MNP escaped lysosomal localization and released DNA in the perinuclear zone. Adiponectin plasmid DNA delivery using MNP resulted in a dose-dependent growth inhibition of cultured arterial smooth muscle cells. It is concluded that magnetically driven plasmid DNA delivery can be achieved using biodegradable MNP containing oleate-coated magnetite and surface modified with PEI oleate ion-pair complexes that enable DNA binding.

They are activated by natural ligands, such as fatty acids, and are also targets of synthetic antidiabetic and hypolipidemic drugs. By using cell-based reporter assays, we studied the transactivation activity of two enantiomeric ureidofibrate-like derivatives. In particular, we show that the R-enantiomer, (R)-1, is a full agonist of PPARγ, whereas the S-enantiomer, (S)-1, is a less potent partial agonist. Most importantly, we report the x-ray crystal structures of the PPARγ ligand binding domain complexed with the R- and the S-enantiomer, respectively. The analysis of the two crystal structures shows that the different degree of stabilization of the helix 12 induced by the ligand determines its behavior as full or partial agonist. Another crystal structure of the PPARγ·(S)-1 complex, only differing in the soaking time of the ligand, is also presented. The comparison of the two structures of the complexes with the partial agonist reveals significant differences and is suggestive of the possible coexistence in solution of transcriptionally active and inactive forms of helix 12 in the presence of a partial agonist.

These ligands, which may function as partial agonists, provide diminished conformational stability of receptor as opposed to full agonists (1Berger J.P. Akiyama T.E. Meinke P.T. Trends Pharmacol.

Furthermore, PPAR ligands with a dual activity on both PPARα and PPARγ receptors improve hyperglycemia and dyslipidemic disorders in a coordinate manner (1Berger J.P. Akiyama T.E. Meinke P.T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 244-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Such compounds may lead to preferred therapies for diabetes, obesity, or metabolic syndrome. For this reason, the search for dual agonists with lower potency on PPARγ as compared with full agonists, but also active on PPARα, would be desirable. We synthesized the two enantiomers of the novel compound, 2-(4-{2-[1,3-benzoxazol-2-yl(heptyl)amino]ethyl}phenoxy)-2-methyl-butanoic acid, a conformationally constrained analogue of the well known PPARα/γ agonist GW2331 (3Kliewer S.A.

Plasmids—The expression plasmids used for transactivation assays contain the yeast Gal4-DNA-binding domain fused to the human PPARα, PPARγ, or PPARδ LBD in the pSG5 vector, and the reporter plasmid (p5xGal4UAS) has five Gal4 response elements upstream to the luciferase gene. The plasmid used for the expression and purification of the ligand binding domain (residues 193-475) of the human PPARγ contains a tag of six histidines and the cleavage site for thrombin protease upstream of the LBD of PPARγ in the pET28 bacterial expression vector. These plasmids were kindly donated by Dr. Krister Bamberg (AstraZeneca, Mölndal, Sweden). The vectors expressing the Gal4 fusion proteins with the ligand binding domains of RARα, 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor α, RAR-related orphan receptor, thyroid hormone receptor α, glucocorticoid receptor, Nurr1, and farnesoid X receptor were generated by fusing the LBDs to the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 and inserting them into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) by standard cloning techniques. Assays were validated using known ligands.

Folmer R. Blomberg N. Sjoblom K. Karlsson U. Lindstedt E.L. Bamberg K. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 699-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In brief, freshly transformed E. coli BL21 DE3 were grown in LB medium with 30 μg of kanamycin/ml at 37 °C to an OD of 0.6. The culture was then induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and further incubated at 18 °C for 20 h. Cells were harvested and resuspended in a 20 ml/liter culture of Buffer A (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Tris 2-carboxyethylphosphine HCl, pH 8) in the presence of protease inhibitors (Complete Mini EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science). Cells were sonicated, and the soluble fraction was isolated by centrifugation (35,000 × g for 45 min). The supernatant was loaded onto an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with a gradient of imidazole 0-300 mm in Buffer A with a PU980 HPLC system (Jasco, Lecco, Italy). The fractions containing the protein were collected, quantitated with a Bradford assay, and analyzed on 12% SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. 1A). The protein was then dialyzed over Buffer C (20 mm Tris, 20 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Tris 2-carboxyethylphosphine HCl, pH 8) to remove imidazole, and it was cleaved with thrombin protease (GE Healthcare) (10 units/mg) at room temperature for 2 h. The cleavage was monitored by SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. 1A) and by mass spectrometry, and we observed a complete digestion, as assessed by the reduction of 1751 Da of the molecular mass of the recombinant protein, corresponding to the loss of 17 amino acids (supplemental Fig. 1B). The identity of the native and digested protein was determined on the basis of the molecular weight (supplemental Fig. 1B) and of the sequencing of the tryptic peptides obtained by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry (data not shown) (LTQ; ThermoElectron Co., San Jose, CA), respectively. The digested mixture was reloaded onto an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column to remove the His tag and the undigested protein. The flow-through was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose HP column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with a gradient of NaCl 0-500 mm in Buffer B (20 mm Tris, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Tris 2-carboxyethylphosphine HCl, pH 8). The protein was then dialyzed over Buffer B and kept frozen in aliquots at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Co-activator Recruitment Assay—His-PPARγ-LBD (20-50 nm) was incubated in black flat-bottom 384-well microplates for 1 h at 37 °C with biotinylated peptide (500 nm), europium-labeled anti-histidine antibody (1 nm), and allophycocyanin-labeled streptavidin (100 nm) in assay buffer (50 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 0.1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Ligands were diluted in Me2SO, starting at the indicated concentration for each ligand. Time-resolved fluorescence was measured on an Analyst GT multimode reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Excitation was at 340 nm, and the results are expressed as the ratio of allophycocyanin fluorescence (λ = 665 nm) to europium fluorescence (λ = 620 nm) multiplied by 10,000. The final results represent this ratio minus the background (Me2SO ratio) of six independent experiments. EC50 and Kd values of the ligands were calculated using GraphPad Prism version 4.0c for Macintosh (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Competition Binding—The scintillation proximity assay was performed as previously described (24Cronet P. Petersen J.F. Folmer R. Blomberg N. Sjoblom K. Karlsson U. Lindstedt E.L. Bamberg K. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 699-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay was performed in 96-well plates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using 100 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 80 mm NaCl, 2 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 0.125% CHAPS, and 10% glycerol. Each well contained 0.1 mg of polylysine-coated yttrium silicate beads (GE Healthcare), 1 μg of His-PPARγ-LBD, and 40 nm [3H]rosiglitazone (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) at 50 Ci/mmol. The amount of protein did not deplete ligand concentration. Cold ligands were tested in 10-point concentration-response curves starting at the indicated concentration. All components were added simultaneously and incubated with gentle shaking for 1 h at room temperature. Scintillation counts were determined in a Microbeta 1450 Wallac Trilux counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), reading each well for 1 min. Wells devoid of competitor represented 100% binding. Nonspecific binding was measured by leaving PPARγ protein out of the scintillation proximity assay reaction. Experiments were repeated three times. Ki values of the ligands were calculated using GraphPad Prism version 4.0c for Macintosh (GraphPad Software). Protein Crystallization—Crystals of apo-PPARγ (25Ebdrup S. Pettersson I. Rasmussen H.B.

Prismatic crystals (200 × 200 × 200 μm) appeared after a few days. The crystals were soaked for 2-30 days in a storage solution (1 m sodium citrate, 0.15 m Tris, pH 8.0) containing the ligand (1 mm). Ligands dissolved in ethanol were diluted in the storage solution so that the final ethanol concentration was 1%. Crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen after a fast soaking in a cryoprotectant buffer (storage solution with glycerol 20% (v/v)). Crystals belong to the space group C2 with cell parameters a = 93.14 Å, b = 60.95 Å, c = 118.11 Å, β = 103.3° for the complex with the R-enantiomer and a = 93.54 Å, b = 60.91 Å, c = 118.35 Å, β = 103.1° for that with the S-enantiomer (crystal soaked 30 days). The asymmetric unit is formed by one homodimer (53% solvent). Structure Determination—X-ray data were collected at 100 K under a nitrogen stream using synchrotron radiation (beamline XRD1 at Elettra, Trieste). The diffracted intensities were processed using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab (R)-1 and (S)-1 Activate PPARγ-mediated Transcription—The activity of the two enantiomers of a novel compound deriving from the ureidofibrate class (Fig. 1) was evaluated on a panel of nuclear receptors in a Gal4-based assay. The results in Fig. 2A show that (R)-1 and (S)-1 only activate the transcription of PPARα and PPARγ, whereas the activity of the other nuclear receptors, including the PPARβ/δ subtype, is not affected by these two molecules. To gain more insights on the potency and efficacy of these new compounds on the PPARγ subtype, we carried out transfection assays with the human Gal4-PPARγ-LBD expression vector and compared the curves obtained with increasing concentrations of (R)-1 and (S)-1 with the corresponding data obtained with rosiglitazone, here used as a reference compound. As shown in Fig. 2B,(R)-1 is able to activate PPARγ, but its potency is clearly lower than that of rosiglitazone (Table 2). (S)-1 is less potent than the R-enantiomer toward PPARγ, and in addition its efficacy is markedly lower than that of rosiglitazone and (R)-1 (Table 2). Co-activator recruitment assays (Fig. 2C) are consistent with the results of cellular assays and show that (S)-1 is less potent and has lower efficacy than (R)-1 and rosiglitazone (Table 2). The determination of binding constants by a scintillation proximity assay confirms that (S)-1 is a lower affinity PPARγ ligand, whereas the affinity of (R)-1 is comparable with that of rosiglitazone (Fig. 2E).TABLE 2Potency and efficacy of tested ligands toward PPARγ as determined in Gal4-based assays (top) and in cell-free co-activator recruitment assays (bottom)Tested ligandEC50Efficacynm%Rosiglitazone3.8 ± 1.5100.0 ± 10.5(R)-173.3 ± 49.9116.1 ± 9.0(S)-1593.0 ± 114.150.4 ± 5.1Tested ligandKdΔmaxnm%Rosiglitazone14.8 ± 6.6100.0 ± 4.9(R)-1684.8 ± 106.870.5 ± 2.5(S)-11,978 ± 523.523.3 ± 3.2 Open table in a new tab (S)-1 Behaves Like a PPARγ Partial Agonist—Since the efficacy of (S)-1 in cell-based assays is 50%, and that in the co-activator recruitment assay is about 25% of that of rosiglitazone (Table 2), we wanted to test whether this molecule could behave as a partial agonist of PPARγ. The co-activator recruitment assay (Fig. 2D) shows that when 1 or 10 μm rosiglitazone is incubated with increasing concentrations of (S)-1, the percentage of efficacy decreases to about 25%, a value corresponding to the maximal efficacy reached by (S)-1. These results suggest that (S)-1 is a partial agonist of PPARγ. Overall Structure of the LBD—Having observed the different behavior of the two enantiomers, we solved the crystal structure of PPARγ complexed with (R)-1 and (S)-1. The structure of PPARγ-LBD in both complexes is very similar to that of the apo-form, with an r.m.s. deviation between Cα atoms of 0.31Å (225 Cα pairs). The r.m.s. deviation between the structures of the two complexes is only 0.20 Å (267 Cα pairs), the largest deviation regarding the terminal part of helix 12 (Cα 473-476). The LBD domain consists of 12 helices and a small β-sheet of four strands. The electron density corresponding to residues 260-275, belonging to the so-called omega loop, is badly defined or missing. The residues of this region were not considered in the refinement. A homodimer forms the asymmetric unit in both structures. The two monomers, denoted as A and B, contain one ligand molecule. Helix 12 of monomer A is in its active conformation. As observed in other PPAR structures, helix 12 in monomer B does not adopt the active conformation, despite the presence of the ligand (24Cronet P. Petersen J.F. Folmer R. Blomberg N. Sjoblom K. Karlsson U. Lindstedt E.L. Bamberg K. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 699-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). This is because H12 of monomer B is engaged in several contacts with a symmetry-related molecule of monomer A. Particularly, it occupies the hydrophobic groove into which the coactivator peptide binds (nuclear receptor-box) (28Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G.

Binding of the R-Enantiomer in the PPARγ-LBD—The electron density reported in Fig. 3A clearly shows the position of the R-enantiomer. Its molecular volume (∼435 Å3) fills about 30% of the large T-shaped cavity volume (∼1440 Å3) limited by the H3, H5, H7, H12, and the β-sheet. The carboxylate group of the ligand participates in a hydrogen bonding network (Fig. 4A). One of the carboxylate oxygens forms a hydrogen bond of 2.6 Å with the His323 Nϵ2 atom. The other carboxylate oxygen is engaged in a bifurcated hydrogen bond of 2.4 and 2.6 Å, respectively, with the Tyr473 hydroxyl oxygen and His449 Nϵ2 atom. An additional hydrogen bond (2.8 Å) is formed by the ether oxygen of the ligand with the His449 Nζ2 atom.FIGURE 4A, hydrogen bonding network between the R-enantiomer (yellow)"

More recently, PPARα and its ligands have been implicated in inflammatory responses and the regulation of cell proliferation. PPARα also regulates the expression of Cyp4a fatty acid ω-hydroxylases and Cyp2c arachidonic acid epoxygenase genes. To study the role of the PPARα receptor and of its Cyp2c epoxygenase gene target in tumorigenesis, we treated mice injected with tumor cells with Wy-14,643, a PPARα-selective ligand. Compared with untreated controls, Wy-14643-treated animals showed marked reductions in tumor growth and vascularization, which were accompanied by decreases in the plasma levels of pro-angiogenic epoxygenase metabolites (EETs), hepatic EET biosynthesis, and Cyp2c epoxygenase expression. All these Wy-14643-induced responses were absent in PPARα-/- mice and are thus PPARα-mediated. Primary cultures of mouse lung endothelial cells treated with Wy-14643 showed reductions in cell proliferation and in the formation of capillary-like structures. These effects were absent in cells obtained from PPRAα-/- mice and reversed by the addition of EETs. These results identify important anti-angiogenic and anti-tumorigenic roles for PPARα, characterize the contribution of its Cyp2c epoxygenases gene target to these responses, and suggest potential anti-cancer roles for this nuclear receptor and its ligands.

We report here that Wy-14643, a selective PPARα ligand (27Savas U. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 851-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 28Mandard S. Muller M.

Life Sci. 2004; 61: 393-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar), reduces tumor angiogenesis and growth in vivo, and show that its anti-tumorigenic effects are PPARα-dependent. In addition, studies with primary endothelial cells show that Wy-14643 decreases the proliferative and tubulogenic capacity of these cells in a PPARα- and EET-dependent fashion and thus alters their angiogenic potential. Furthermore, in vivo studies with three different tumor cell lines identify a role for PPARα in tumor growth and angiogenesis and suggest that its ligands could be utilized as safe and well tolerated anti-tumorigenic drugs. Cell Culture—Primary murine pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells were isolated from sex- and age-matched adult wild-type and PPARα-/- (PPARαKO) mice (a gift from Dr. Frank Gonzalez, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) (29Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell.

Soloway P. Gardner H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2202-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Temperature-sensitive, conditionally immortalized pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells were isolated in the same manner from H-2Kb-tsA58 SV40 large T Ag wild-type transgenic mice (31Whitehead R.H.

A. 1993; 90: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and propagated at 33 °C in the presence of 100 IU/ml γ-interferon. For experiments, cells were cultured at 37 °C without γ-interferon for at least 4 days before use, because this is the optimal time for the cells to acquire a phenotype similar to freshly isolated primary endothelial cells (32Frank D.B. Abtahi A. Yamaguchi D.J. Manning S. Shyr Y. Pozzi A. Baldwin H.S. Johnson J.E. de Caestecker M.P. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Due to limitations in the number of primary endothelial cells that can be isolated and cultured from mouse lungs, conditionally immortalized wild-type cells were used as surrogates for the analysis of epoxygenase protein expression and EET/DHET biosynthesis. The large T antigen/Ras/Myc-transformed fibroblast line p60.5 was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum as described (30Pozzi A. Moberg P.E. Miles L.A. Wagner S. Soloway P. Gardner H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2202-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Mouse colon carcinoma cells CT26 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum as described (33Pozzi A. Yan X. Macias-Perez I. Wei S. Hata A.N. Breyer R.M.

The human non small cell lung cancer cells A459 were purchased from ATCC and cultured according to the supplier's instructions. To analyze the effects of Wy-14643 on cellular epoxygenase activity, tumor cells or temperature-sensitive endothelial cells were cultured in media with or without different concentrations of Wy-14643 (ChemSyn Laboratories). After 4 days, the cells were incubated in serum-free medium containing AA (10 μm, final concentration) and, 4 h after, the cells and the media were removed from the plates, and the EETs and DHETs present in the cells and the media were extracted, purified, and quantified as described below. Proliferation Assay—Cells were plated (5 × 103 cells/well; 96-well plate) in complete medium alone or containing either: (a) Wy-14643 (3–100 μm, final concentration), (b) 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, or 14,15-EET (1 μm final concentration each), or (c) a combination of Wy-14643 (25 or 100 μm, final concentration) and each individual EET regioisomer (1 μm final concentration). EETs were used at 1 μm because this was the concentration producing maximal responses (24Pozzi A. Macias-Perez I. Abair T. Wei S. Su Y. Zent R. Falck J.R. Capdevila J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27138-27146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Two days after plating, the medium was replaced with media containing [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well), the cells were incubated for another 48 h, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined as described (30Pozzi A. Moberg P.E. Miles L.A. Wagner S. Soloway P. Gardner H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2202-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Matrigel-based Capillary Formation Assay—Capillary-like tube formation was analyzed as described (34Kubota Y. Kleinman H.K. Martin G.R. Lawley T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with 50 μl of Matrigel and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Primary endothelial cells were cultured in complete media with or without Wy-14643 (25 or 100 μm, final concentration). After 4 days, the cells were serum-starved for 24 h, suspended in serum-free media (200 μl final volume) with or without Wy-14643 (25 or 100 μm, final concentration), and then plated (1.5×104 cells/well) over solidified Matrigel in the presence or absence of EETs (1 μm, final concentration). The formation of capillary-like structures was recorded (three images per treatment per well) hourly for the next 10 h. Fig. 3 shows representative images taken 6 h after plating. To quantify capillary-like network formation, cellular nodes were defined as junctions linking at least three cells, and they were counted from digital images. Four independent experiments were performed with a total of 12 images analyzed per treatment. RNA Isolation and Analysis—RNA from p60.5 cells or primary endothelial cells cultured for 4 days in the presence or absence of Wy-14643 (25 or 100 μm, final concentrations) were isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA samples were dissolved in water, quantified by UV absorbance, and reversed transcribed using SuperScript II (Invitrogen), oligo(dT)12–18, and a random primer mixture. The levels of Cyps 2c29, 2c38, 2c40, and 2c44 transcripts were estimated by reverse transcription-PCR amplification (RT-PCR) using the following mouse isoform specific primer pairs: Cyp2c29, 5′-gtgatgaatggatttgcctc-3′ and 5′-ggatacacataaacacaagg-3′; Cyp2c38, 5′-tgtgttcctgttctcagact-3′ and 5′-gtgggtatgtcaatgggtgt-3′; Cyp2c40, 5′-caaacattctggattttcta-3′ and 5′-agttgaatcctttaatttgc-3′; and Cyp2c44, 5′-tgctacctaggccagaaaca-3′ and 5′-gatgagggccttgtggatct-3′ (35Nelson D.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 320: 1-10PubMed Google Scholar). β-Actin transcripts were amplified using the following primers: 5′-aggtgacagc attgcttctg-3′ and 5′-agggagaccaaagccttcat-3′. RNA transcripts were quantified by densitometric analysis of digitalized images of the fluorescence emitted by ethidium bromide-bound PCR products resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. Expression levels were normalized using β-actin. Northern blots of total liver RNAs were done using DNA probes (500–700 bp) coding for segments of the untranslated 3′-end of Cyps2c29, -2c38, -2c40, and -2c44 (35Nelson D.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 320: 1-10PubMed Google Scholar). Gel loading was normalized using β-actin probes. Analyses of Primary Tumor Growth—All animal protocols were reviewed and approved by Vanderbilt University Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Three-month-old 129SvJ male wild-type and PPARαKO mice were given two dorsal subcutaneous injections of p60.5 cells (3 × 105 cells in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline per site). Three-month-old male wild-type BALB/c and immunodeficient nude mice were given two dorsal subcutaneous injections of CT26 cells (3 × 105 cells in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline per site) and A549 cells (1 × 106 cells in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline per site), respectively. Immediately afterward, the mice were separated into groups receiving water or a solution of Wy-14643 (0.02% w/v) as their only fluid supply (36Cowart L.A. Wei S. Hsu M.H. Johnson E.F. Krishna M.U.

Mice were sacrificed after two (129SvJ and BALB/c mice) or four (immunodeficient nude mice) weeks and the tumor volume, weight, and number evaluated. Averaged tumor volumes were calculated using the following formula: tumor volume (mm3) = (length × width2)/2 (37Chen X. Su Y. Fingleton B. Acuff H. Matrisian L.M. Zent R. Pozzi A. Int. J. Cancer. 2005; 116: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Western Blot and Immunofluorescence Analyses—Microsomal fractions from mouse liver, temperature-sensitive endothelial, or p60.5 cells were isolated by differential centrifugation as described (38Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Dishman E. Karara A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Microsomal proteins (20–50 μg of protein/well) were resolved by SDS-PAGE in 10% gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore), and the membranes were incubated with an anti-Cyp2c44 peptide antibody raised against the IGRHQPPSMKDKMKC peptide (GenScript) (39DeLozier T.C.

Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and an ECL kit (Pierce). Frozen tumor sections (7 μm each) were stained with rat anti-mouse CD31 antibody (1:400, Amersham Biosciences), followed by rhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch). The degree of vascularization, expressed as percentage of area occupied by CD31-positive structures/microscopic field, was evaluated using Scion Image Software (Frederick, MD) (30Pozzi A. Moberg P.E. Miles L.A. Wagner S. Soloway P. Gardner H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2202-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), using 3 images/tumor and 10 tumors/genotype. In some experiments, tumor frozen sections were co-stained with rabbit anti-mouse PPARα (1:1000, Abcam Inc.) and rat anti-mouse CD31 antibodies followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and rhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG antibodies (1:200). Fluorescence emission was visualized with a double filter channel fluorescence microscope. Analysis and Quantification of Epoxygenase Metabolites—Adult (10–20 weeks of age) male wild-type and PPARαKO mice or wild-type BALB/c mice were fed commercial solid diets and allowed free access to either water or a 0.02% (w/v) solution of Wy-14643 for 7–10 days. Liver microsomes were isolated and suspended in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) containing 0.25 m sucrose (0.5–1 mg of protein/ml), and incubated at 37 °C with [1-14C]AA (50 μCi/μmol, 70–100 μm final concentration) in the presence of NADPH (1 mm, final concentration), and an NADPH-generating system (38Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Dishman E. Karara A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Organic soluble products were extracted and resolved, and the epoxygenase metabolites (EETs plus DHETs) were quantified by using on-line β-detection (38Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Dishman E. Karara A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The EETs and DHETs present in cultured cells, mouse liver, or plasma were extracted, purified, analyzed, and quantified by the isotope ratio method using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry as described (41Capdevila J.H. Dishman E. Karara A. Falck J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). All biological samples were extracted in the presence of equimolar mixtures of synthetic 2H3-labeled 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-EET and 2H8-labeled 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-DHET (5 ng each). Blood samples were collected in the presence of EDTA, and the plasma fractions were extracted as described (42Karara A. Wei S. Spady D. Swift L. Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 1320-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Mouse livers and plasma were extracted immediately after isolation. Statistical Analysis—One-tailed Student's t test was used for group comparisons and for the analysis of variance using Sigma-Stat software for statistical differences between multiple groups. p ≥ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The identification of 5,6- and 8,9-EETs as angiogenic lipids (22Michaelis U.R. Fisslthaler B. Medhora M. Harder D. Fleming I. Busse R.

For these purposes we utilized Wy-14643, a selective PPARα ligand, that binds and trans-activates the receptor with high affinity (29Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L.

We first documented the endothelial effects of PPARα activation using lung endothelial cells isolated from wild-type and PPARαKO mice and then the role of PPARα in tumor vascularization and growth. Three different combinations of tumor cell lines and hosts were used for these studies: (a) p60.5-transformed tumor cells and isogenic 129SvJ wild-type and PPARαKO mice, (b) CT26 cells and isogenic BALB/c mice, and (c) human A549 non-small cell lung cancer cells and immunocompromised nude mice recipients. Wy-14643 Inhibits the Proliferation of Endothelial Cells Isolated from Wild-type but Not from PPARαKO Mice—To determine whether Wy-14643 and the PPARα receptor had an effect on endothelial cell proliferation, primary cultures of lung endothelial cells isolated from wild-type and PPARαKO mice were incubated with different concentrations of Wy-14643, and their proliferation was evaluated by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation. Compared with vehicle-treated (ethanol) controls, wild-type cells incubated with Wy-14643 showed marked reductions in proliferation that were concentration-dependent, and reached a maximum at 100 μm Wy-14643 (Fig. 1A). Importantly, Wy-14643 had no significant effects on the proliferation of endothelial cells isolated from PPARαKO mice (Fig. 1A) demonstrating, unequivocally, that its anti-proliferative effects were PPARα-dependent.

Chronic hypoxia causes pulmonary arterial hypertension leading to right ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure. During pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary arteries exhibit increased expression of smooth muscle-α-actin and -myosin heavy chain. NFATc3 (nuclear factor of activated T cells isoform c3), which is aCa2+-dependent transcription factor, has been recently linked to smooth muscle phenotypic maintenance through the regulation of the expression of α-actin. The aim of this study was to determine if: (a) NFATc3 is expressed in murine pulmonary arteries, (b) hypoxia induces NFAT activation, (c) NFATc3 mediates the up-regulation of α-actin during chronic hypoxia, and (d) NFATc3 is involved in chronic hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling. NFATc3 transcript and protein were found in pulmonary arteries. NFAT-luciferase reporter mice were exposed to normoxia (630 torr) or hypoxia (380 torr) for 2, 7, or 21 days. Exposure to hypoxia elicited a significant increase in luciferase activity and pulmonary arterial smooth muscle nuclear NFATc3 localization, demonstrating NFAT activation. Hypoxia induced up-regulation of α-actin and was prevented by the calcineurin/NFAT inhibitor, cyclosporin A (25 mg/kg/day s.c.). In addition, NFATc3 knock-out mice did not showed increased α-actin levels and arterial wall thickness after hypoxia.

As altitude increases, the barometric pressure and atmospheric oxygen partial pressure decrease. This decrease in barometric pressure is the basic cause of all hypoxia-related problems in high altitude pathophysiology.

Regardless of the cause of pulmonary hypertension, the structural change that is thought to underlie the increased vascular resistance is remodeling of small pulmonary arteries. A prominent feature of this vascular remodeling is medial thickening. In proximal pulmonary vessels, medial enlargement is caused by hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the pre-existing smooth muscle cells (reviewed in Ref. 1Hopkins N. McLoughlin P. J. Anat. 2002; 201: 335-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition, differentiation of adventitial fibroblasts into myofibroblasts contributes to medial thickening (13Short M.

Smooth muscle is phenotypically dynamic and maintains its differentiated phenotype through the regulated expression of a repertoire of SM-specific genes (reviewed in Ref. 14Owens G.K. Physiol.

NFAT appears to regulate the expression of SM-myosin heavy chain, SM-α-actin, α1 integrin, and caldesmon genes (21Wada H. Hasegawa K. Morimoto T. Kakita T. Yanazume T. Abe M. Sasayama S. J.

Recently, we demonstrated that serum response factor (SRF) and NFATc3 cooperatively enhance the expression of SM-α-actin in cultured aortic smooth muscle cells (24Gonzalez Bosc L.V. Layne J. Nelson M.T. Hill-Eubanks D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 280: 26113-26120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (49) Google Scholar). NFATc3 and SRF bind to a region of the first intron of the SM-α-actin gene (24Gonzalez Bosc L.V. Layne J. Nelson M.T. Hill-Eubanks D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 280: 26113-26120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (49) Google Scholar). SM-α-actin is required for the high force development properties of smooth muscle cells and is the most abundant protein in differentiated SM making up to 40% of total cell protein (26Fatigati V. Murphy R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14383-14388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In adults, expression of SM-α-actin is restricted and is generally activated upon terminal differentiation in cells of myogenic lineage correlating with hypertrophy, whereas increases in non-muscle actins (β- and γ-actin) coincide with cell growth and proliferation (14Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). The NFAT family consists of four members (NFATc1, NFATc2, NFATc3, NFATc4) that share the property of Ca2+/calcineurin-dependent nuclear translocation, and a fifth member, NFAT5, which is Ca2+ independent and shares limited homology with the other family members (reviewed in Refs. 19Rao A.

Navedo M.F. Santana L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; (M408789200)PubMed Google Scholar). In smooth muscle, NFAT is activated by Gq/11-coupled receptor agonists, such as uridine triphosphate, endothelin 1 (ET-1) and angiotensin II (Ang II) (23Gonzalez Bosc L.V. Wilkerson M.K. Bradley K.N.

This activation is mediated by calcineurin and is dependent on both sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release through inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3R) and extracellular Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCC) (31Gomez M.F.

Interestingly, during CH, PASMC exhibit increased expression of SM-α-actin (33Durmowicz A.G. Stenmark K.R. Pediatr. Rev. 1999; 20: e91-e102Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 34Jones R.

Eddahibi S. Adamy C. Rideau D. Marotte F. Dubois-Rande J.L. Adnot S. Samuel J.L. Teiger E. Am. J. Resp. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 37Morrell N.W.

Res. 1997; 81: 600-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It is thus reasonable to hypothesize that in response to CH, NFAT is activated in PASMC leading to the up-regulation of the SM-α-actin contractile protein and vascular remodeling. Given the lack of evidence demonstrating hypoxia-induced NFAT regulation of gene transcription, the aims of the present study were to determine if: (a) NFATc3 is expressed in murine pulmonary arteries, (b) CH induces NFATc3 activation, (c) NFATc3 mediates the up-regulation of α-actin during CH, and (d) NFATc3 is involved in CH-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling. In support of this hypothesis, our data demonstrate that CH indeed increases NFAT transcriptional activity and NFATc3 nuclear translocation in mouse pulmonary arteries. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of calcineurin activation of NFAT or genetic ablation of NFATc3 prevents CH-induced increases in α-actin expression, arterial wall thickness and right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy. These results suggest that NFATc3 plays a role in the vascular changes observed during CH-induced pulmonary hypertension. All protocols employed in this study were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of New Mexico, School of Medicine (Albuquerque, NM). Animals—Adult male 9x-NFAT-luciferase reporter (NFAT-luc), NFATc3 knock-out (NFATc3 KO), BalB/C wild-type (WT) and C57BL/6 (Harland Laboratories) mice (20-25 g) were used. In addition, NFAT-luc were backcrossed with NFATc3 KO for, at least, two generations and NFAT-luc/NFATc3 +/+ (WT), NFAT-luc/NFATc3 +/- (HET), and NFAT-luc/NFATc3 -/- (KO) were used. NFAT-luc mice have been provided by Dr. Jeffery D. Molkentin (Department of Pediatrics, Children’s Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH) (40Braz J.C. Bueno O.F. Liang Q. Wilkins B.J. Dai Y.S.

NFATc3 KO mice have been kindly provided by Dr. Laurie Glimcher (Harvard University) (41Oukka M. Ho I.C. de la Brousse F.C. Hoey T. Grusby M.J. Glimcher L.H. Immunity. 1998; 9: 295-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Heterozygous mice were bred to obtain age-matched WT (Balb/C) and KO. Importantly, it has been shown that the loss of NFATc3 isoform does not induce a compensatory regulation of other NFAT isoforms (42Wilkins B.J. De Windt L.J. Bueno O.F. Braz J.C. Glascock B.J. Kimball T.F. Molkentin J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 7603-7613Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). C57B6 mice were s.c. administered 25 mg/kg/day of cyclosporin A (CsA, Calbiochem) or Cremophor EL (vehicle) for 1 week. Chronic Hypoxia Exposure—Animals designated for exposure to CH were housed in a hypobaric chamber with barometric pressure maintained at ∼380 mmHg for 2, 7, or 21 days. The chamber was opened one time per week to provide animals with fresh food, water, and clean bedding. Control animals were housed at ambient barometric pressure (Normoxia, N, ∼630 mmHg). All animals were maintained on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle. Assessment of Polycythemia and RV Hypertrophy—Blood samples were obtained by direct cardiac puncture at the time of lung isolation for measurement of hematocrit. RV hypertrophy was assessed as an index of CH-induced pulmonary hypertension with previously described methods (43Resta T.C. Gonzales R.J. Dail W.G. Sanders T.C. Walker B.R. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 1997; 272: H806-H813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Resta T.C. Chicoine L.G. Omdahl J.L. Walker B.R. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 1999; 276: H699-H708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after isolation of the heart, the atria and major vessels were removed from the ventricles. The RV was dissected from the left ventricle and septum, and each was weighed. The degree of RV hypertrophy was expressed as the ratio of RV to total ventricle weight (T). Vascular Morphometry—Animals were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane in O2 and perfused via the left ventricle with ∼20 ml of modified physiological saline solution (HEPES-PSS, 134 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.026 mm EDTA, and 10 mm glucose) containing heparin, 4% albumin (Sigma) and 10-4 m papaverine (Sigma), at a rate close to normal cardiac output in mice (17 ml/minute) to maximally dilate and flush the circulation of blood. Then, mice were perfused with 4% formaldehyde (Polyscience) and 10-4 m papaverine (Sigma) in PBS at the same rate. Following fixation, the lungs were inflated via the trachea to a pressure of 23 cmH2O with fixative. The tissue was then dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol, with a final dehydration in xylene, and then embedded in paraffin. Lung sections (5 μm) were stained with hematoxylin/iodine/eosin (Van Gieson staining, Sigma) which stains nuclei, elastic laminae, collagen fibers and cellular cytosol to distinguish arteries from veins. A total of 1291 arteries from 13 mice were analyzed. Vessels were examined with a ×40 objective on a Nikon Diaphot 300 microscope, and images were generated with a cooled digital CCD camera (Photometrics SenSys 1400). Vessel images were processed with Metamorph imaging system hardware and software (Universal Imaging). Vessels sectioned at oblique angles were excluded from analysis. Media and wall thickness were measured and compared between groups using the following equation: Wall thickness (%) = perimeterext - perimeterint/perimeterext × 100, where perimeterext and perimeterint are the circumferences bounded by external and internal elastic laminae, respectively (45Meyrick B. Reid L. Anat. Rec. 1979; 193: 71-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Luciferase Activity—NFAT-luc mice were euthanized with an overdose of pentobarbital solution (200 mg/kg intraperitoneal). Following euthanasia lungs, brain, and small intestines were removed and placed into ice-cold HEPES-PSS. Aorta, intrapulmonary, cerebral and mesenteric arteries were isolated and lysed using tissue lysis buffer from Promega according to manufacturer’s protocol. Lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 rcf. Both luciferase activity and protein content were determined in the supernatant. Luciferase activity was measured using a Luciferase Assay System kit (Promega), and light detected with a luminometer (TD20/20, Turner). Protein content was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) and used to normalize luciferase activity per sample. Immunofluorescence Confocal Microscopy—Isolated lungs were formaldehyde fixed (4% in PBS), cryoprotected with 30% sucrose in PBS, embedded in OCT media and frozen. Cryostat sections (10 μm) were permeabilized and blocked for nonspecific binding, primary antibodies (rabbit polyclonal anti-NFATc3 (1:100); Santa Cruz Biotechnology and anti-α-actin (1:250); Sigma) were prepared in 0.2% gelatin in PBS and applied overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit Cy5 and anti-mouse Cy3 (1:500); Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) were prepared in 0.2% gelatin in PBS and applied for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained using SYTOX green (1:5,000 in PBS; Molecular Probes). Sections were examined using a 40× objective on a Zeiss 510 laser scanning confocal microscope. Specificity of immune staining was confirmed by the absence of fluorescence in tissues incubated with primary or secondary antibodies alone. For scoring of NFATc3-positive nuclei, multiple fields for each vessel were imaged and counted by two independent observers using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp). The software was programmed so that individual pixels appear white instead of yellow if the green nucleic acid stain and red NFATc3 stain co-localized. Thus, a cell was considered positive if co-localization (white) was uniformly distributed in the nucleus and negative if no co-localization (green only) was observed. Western Blot Analysis—Isolated intrapulmonary arteries were homogenized in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1% IGEPAL, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 500 nm sodium orthovanadate, 50 nm NaF, 1 μg/ml pepstatin/leupeptin/aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 16,000 rcf for 2 min. Protein concentration was determined in the supernatant using Bradford’s method (Bio-Rad) as recommended by the manufacturer. To perform Western blot analysis, supernatants (2 μg/lane) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and proteins transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered (50 mm) saline solution (pH 7.6) with 0.05% Tween containing 5% milk powder at room temperature for 1 h. The membranes were incubated with primary anti SM-α-actin antibody (1:5000, Sigma) or anti β-actin antibody (1:5000) at 4 °C overnight, washed, and incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature. Specifically bound antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL, Pierce). Relative content of the antigen protein was evaluated using a Gene Gnome imaging system and Genesnap software (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). Band densities were normalized to total protein loaded per lane as determined by Coomassie Blue or Sypro Red II staining of the membrane (NIH Image software). Quantitative Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR)—Intrapulmonary arteries were stored in RNAlater (Ambion). Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s protocol, with the additional steps of DNase treatment (DNase turbo from Ambion) and RNeasy MinElute Cleanup kit (Qiagen) to remove possible genomic DNA contamination. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using TaqMan Reverse Transcription kit (A&B). For real time detection of SM-α-actin transcripts (Mm01546133_mi) and reference gene (18S, 4319413E-0502018), TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (A&B) were used. PCR was performed using Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System. The normalized gene expression method (2-ΔCT) for relative quantification of gene expression was used (46Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (121148) Google Scholar). Qualitative RT-PCR—Total RNA from intrapulmonary arteries (isolated as mentioned above) was reverse-transcribed (IScript, cDNA synthesis Kit, Bio-Rad). PCR was performed using the iTaq DNA polymerase (Bio-Rad) with the following sets of primer pairs: for NFATc3, 5′-CTACTGGTGGCCATCCTGTTGT-3′ and 5′-AGCTCGTGGGCAGAGCGCTGAGAGCACTC-3′; and for cyclophilin, 5′-CAGACAAAGTTCCAAAGACA-3′ and 5′-AGTTCGACCGTCTTCTCAGC-3′. Amplification conditions were 94 °C for 10 min, 45 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min, and extension for 10 min at 72 °C. Amplified PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and detected by ethidium bromide staining. Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was tested at 95% (p < 0.05) confidence level using unpaired Student’s t test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Newman-Keuls multiple comparisons test or two-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni multiple comparisons test. NFATc3 Isoform Is Expressed in Mouse Pulmonary Arteries—We have used RT-PCR analysis, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy to identify NFATc3 expression in native pulmonary arteries isolated from mice. We found transcripts for NFATc3 (Fig. 1A) and protein by Western blot (Fig. 1B). NFATc3 immunofluorescence staining was mainly localized in PASMC (3A). CH Increases NFAT Activity and NFATc3 Nuclear Accumulation in Pulmonary Arteries—Most of the mediators of NFAT activation are up-regulated during CH, including PASMC [Ca2+]i, Ang II (36Chassagne C.

(Engl.). 1997; 110: 104-108PubMed Google Scholar), although there are no reports of hypoxic activation of NFAT either in vivo or in vitro. Therefore, we examined the effect of different exposure times to CH on NFAT activity in tissues from NFAT-luc reporter mice. We found that CH elicited a significant increase in luciferase activity in pulmonary arteries (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, although luciferase activity decreased in a time dependent manner, it remained significantly elevated over normoxic values even at day 21. No increase in activity was observed in any of the other tissues studied (data not shown). These results for the first time demonstrate that NFAT is activated by CH in pulmonary arteries, suggesting that it is an early response transcription factor under these conditions. Because NFATc3 is expressed in PASMC, we sought to establish the contribution of NFATc3 to CH-increased NFAT activity. Therefore, we determined the effect of 2 days of hypoxia on reporter expression in pulmonary arteries isolated from NFAT-luc/NFATc3 WT, NFAT-luc/NFATc3 HET, and NFAT-luc/NFATc3 KO mice. Consistent with the demonstrated expression of NFATc3 in pulmonary arteries (Figs. 1, A and B, and 3A) and the significant contribution of this isoform to SMC function (23Gonzalez Bosc L.V.

https://openalex.org/W2055898863,"Growing evidence indicates that adenosine receptors could be promising therapeutic targets in autoimmune diseases. Here we studied the role of adenosine receptors in controlling the course of type 1 diabetes. Diabetes in CD-1 mice was induced by multiple-low-dose-streptozotocin (MLDS) treatment and in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice by cyclophosphamide injection. The nonselective adenosine receptor agonist 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) prevented diabetes development in both MLDS-challenged mice and in cyclophosphamide-treated NOD mice. The effect of NECA was reversed by the selective A2B receptor antagonist N-(4-cyanophenyl)-2-[4-(2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-2,6-dioxo-1,3-dipropyl-1H-purin-8-yl)phenoxy]acetamide (MRS 1754). The selective A1 receptor agonist 2-chloro-N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CCPA) and A3 receptor agonist N6-(3-iodobenzyl)-adenosine-5'-N-methyluronamide (IB-MECA) were less efficacious in ameliorating the course of diabetes. NECA inhibited diabetes in A2A receptor KO mice and the selective A2A receptor agonist 2-p-(2-carboxyethyl)phenethyl-amino-5'-N-ethyl-carboxamidoadenosine (CGS21680) had no effect in normal mice, indicating a lack of role of A2A receptors. NECA failed to prevent cytokine-induced beta-cell death in vitro, but NECA strongly suppressed expression of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, MIP-1alpha, IL-12, and IFN-gamma in pancreata, endotoxin, or anti-CD3-stimulated splenic cells, and T helper 1 lymphocytes, indicating that the beneficial effect of NECA was due to immunomodulation. These results demonstrate that adenosine receptor ligands are potential candidates for the treatment of type 1 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1971480083,"MARCO is a trimeric class A scavenger receptor of macrophages and dendritic cells that recognizes polyanionic particles and pathogens. The distal, scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domain of the extracellular part of this receptor has been implicated in ligand binding. To provide a structural basis for understanding the ligand-binding mechanisms of MARCO, we have determined the crystal structure of the mouse MARCO SRCR domain. The recombinant SRCR domain purified as monomeric and dimeric forms, and their structures were determined at 1.78 and 1.77Å resolution, respectively. The monomer has a compact globular fold with a twisted five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and a long loop covering a single α-helix, whereas the dimer is formed via β-strand swapping of two monomers, thus containing a large eight-stranded β-sheet. Calculation of the surface electrostatic potential revealed that the β-sheet region with several arginines forms a basic cluster. Unexpectedly, an acidic cluster was found in the long loop region. In the monomer, the acidic cluster is involved in metal ion binding. Studies with cells expressing various SRCR domain mutants showed that all of the arginines of the basic cluster are involved in ligand binding, suggesting a cooperative binding mechanism. Ligand binding is also dependent on the acidic cluster and Ca2+ ions whose depletion appears to affect ligand binding at least by modulating the electrostatic potential or relative domain orientation. We propose that the SRCR domain dimerization can contribute to the recognition of large ligands by providing a means for the MARCO receptor oligomerization.

These germ line-encoded receptors, also known as pattern recognition receptors due to their ability to recognize conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns, are considered as an important part of innate immunity, the evolutionarily conserved, first line host defense mechanism. In addition to pathogen-associated molecular patterns, a long list of SR ligands, often polyanionic in nature, includes pollution particles, polyribonucleotides, bacterial lipopolysaccharides, modified host molecules such as oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL), and unmodified endogenous proteins (1.Gordon S.

All of these are trimeric type II membrane proteins with a similar predicted tertiary structure consisting of a short intracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a large extracellular domain with an α-helical coiled-coil domain, a triple-helical collagenous domain, and a C-terminal cysteine-rich domain. MARCO differs from the others in that it has a long triplehelical collagenous domain but no α-helical coiled-coil domain. In addition, the C-terminal cysteine-rich domain can be either a C-type lectin-like domain, as it is in SRCL, or a scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domain, present in SR-AI, MARCO, and SCARA5.

Luong C. Ghate M. Sprengeler P.A. Mortara K. Shrader W.D. Sperandio D. Chan H. McGrath M.E.

The domain is found either as a single copy or as tandem repeats in several soluble or membrane-bound proteins often associated with the innate immune system. Strikingly, the genome of the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, contains 1,095 tentative SRCR domain copies distributed to 218 genes. In comparison, only 81 copies in 16 genes are found in humans (14.Rast J.P. Smith L.C. Loza-Coll M. Hibino T. Litman G.W. Science. 2006; 314: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The extensiveness of the SRCR gene family in the sea urchin genome is intriguing and indicates a major need for SRCR domains in the host defense of lower organisms, which solely rely on innate immunity in the absence of adaptive immunity.Despite their large number in the proteome, only a few SRCR domains have a known function. The lymphocyte cell surface receptor CD6 interacts with activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM/CD166) via the SRCR3 domain (15.Patel D.D. Wee S.F. Whichard L.P. Bowen M.A. Pesando J.M.

In the case of MARCO, it has been shown that the binding site for bacteria, lipopolysaccharide, acetylated LDL (AcLDL), and a hydrophobic peptide isolated with a phage display screen resides in the SRCR domain (5.Elomaa O.

Furthermore, truncated forms of MARCO (mouse-441, human-442) containing only the first 20 residues of the SRCR domain are able to bind bacteria. The data also suggest that the arginines (RXR motifs) present in this segment mediate the bacterial binding (21.Brännström A. Sankala M. Tryggvason K. Pikkarainen T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1462-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22.Elomaa O. Sankala M. Pikkarainen T. Bergmann U. Tuuttila A. Raatikainen-Ahokas A. Sariola H. Tryggvason K. J. Biol.

However, in order to thoroughly understand the binding functions of MARCO, determination of its structure is needed.In the present study, the mouse MARCO SRCR domain was expressed and purified in monomeric and dimeric forms, and the crystal structures of both forms were determined at 1.78 and 1.77 Å resolution, respectively. Calculation of the electrostatic potential shows that the domain contains two clusters, a basic cluster composed of several arginines and an acidic one with a bound metal ion. Evidence is provided indicating that both clusters are involved in ligand binding.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProduction and Purification of the MARCO SRCR Domain−A previously generated human embryonic kidney epithelial 293/EBNA cell line (Invitrogen) stably expressing a soluble recombinant MARCO SRCR domain starting from Gln421 was used for protein production (20.Sankala M. Brannstrom A. Schulthess T. Bergmann U. Morgunova E. Engel J. Tryggvason K. Pikkarainen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33378-33385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein contains an N-terminal extension Ala-Pro-Leu-Ala (APLA), left from the BM-40 protein, the signal sequence of which was used to facilitate secretion of the protein. For protein collection, the cells were grown in serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 (without phenol red) for a maximum of 12 days or until the cells started to detach.The cleared, protease inhibitor-supplemented (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm EDTA) conditioned medium was first dialyzed at +4 °C against 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.7. After three buffer changes, the medium was cleared by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 20 min) and applied at +4 °C to a Fractogel EMD SO-3 packed cation exchange column (Merck). Bound proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0-800 mm), and fractions containing the recombinant protein were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 5 mm NaCl, before injection to a Mono Q anion exchange column (GE Healthcare). Elution with a linear NaCl gradient (5-500 mm) yielded two main peaks, both containing the MARCO SRCR domain as assessed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. N-terminal sequencing with Edman degradation also confirmed the expected APLAQ sequence. Next, the two peaks were separately pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and run on a calibrated Superdex 75 size exclusion chromatography column (GE Healthcare) with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl (0.5 ml/min). The protein peaks were analyzed for homogeneity by mass spectrometry on a QTOF 1 API instrument (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) equipped with the standard Z-spray source. Prior to the electrospay, the samples were desalted with ZipTip U-C18 (Millipore) and resolved in 60% acetonitrile, 1% acetic acid.Chemical Cross-linking−The two MARCO SRCR domain pools from the size exclusion chromatography were chemically cross-linked with dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP; Pierce). In this experiment, 125 μg/ml protein solutions in PBS were prepared and mixed with equal volumes of the DSP solution (1 mm DSP in PBS containing 10% Me2SO). After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the reactions were stopped by adding Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 50 mm, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining under nonreducing or reducing conditions. DSP contains a cleavable disulfide bond; therefore, the cross-links can be reversed by reduction.Crystallization and Data Collection−For crystallization trials by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at +4 °C, the two forms of the MARCO SRCR domain were concentrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. The monomeric form (14 mg/ml) was crystallized in 12% PEG 8000, 0.1 m BisTris, pH 6.0, 0.2 m CH3COONH4 by macroseeding from 20% PEG 8000, 0.1 m cacodylate, pH 6.5, 0.2 m magnesium acetate, whereas the dimeric form (7 mg/ml) crystallized in 7% PEG 4000, 0.1 m BisTris buffer, pH 6.0, 0.1 m Li2SO4. One single crystal of the monomeric SRCR domain was cryoprotected with 40% PEG 550 monomethyl ether (MME) and frozen in a nitrogen stream generated by a cryosystem (Xstream; Molecular Structure Corp., The Woodlands, TX). CuKα x-rays (1.5418 Å) from a Rigaku rotating anode generator and a MAR image plate system were used to collect a data set of 159 images with a 1.5° oscillation angle. The data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the HKL software package (23.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Entzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar). In case of the dimeric MARCO SRCR domain, the x-ray diffraction data were collected from a single crystal at beamline I711 in Lund (MaxLab) using a MARCCD detector. As for the monomeric SRCR domain crystals, a short soak in 40% PEG 550 MME was used for cryoprotection. The diffraction data of 321 images, collected with 1° of oscillation per image, were integrated with MOSFLM (24.Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 1696-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and scaled with programs of the CCP4 suite (25.Collaborative Computational Project 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar).Structure Determination and Refinement−Both structures were determined by molecular replacement. For the monomeric form of the MARCO SRCR domain, the first structure solution was obtained with AMORE (26.Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar) using the structure of the M2BP (Mac-2-binding protein) SRCR domain (Protein Data Bank code 1BY2) as a search model (27.Hohenester E.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26684) Google Scholar). For the dimeric form of the MARCO SRCR domain, the structure of the monomeric MARCO SRCR domain was used as a search model, and MOLREP found the first structure solution in two steps (29.Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4121) Google Scholar). The models were built iteratively with O and COOT (30.Jones T. Zou J.Y. Cowen S.W. Acta Crystallogr.

Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar) and checked by COOT (31.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar).SRCR Domain Modeling−The SRCR domain structures of mouse SR-A, human MARCO, and the mouse/human MARCO chimeras (M496-518, M449-473, and M453-518) were built iteratively in COOT by mutating the mouse MARCO and human M2BP SRCR domain structures.Cell Assays−The ligand-binding activity of CHO cells transfected with expression plasmids encoding various MARCO mutants was compared with that of cells transfected with a negative control plasmid (included vectors for an immunoglobulin superfamily member nephrin and a type II membrane protein asialoglycoprotein receptor H1 subunit) and wild-type MARCO expressed either from a standard CMV promoter/enhancer-containing plasmid (high MARCO, or H-MARCO) or from a plasmid lacking the CMV enhancer (low MARCO, or L-MARCO). This latter plasmid gives lower expression levels than the standard plasmid and was used because some combinations of the Arg-to-Ala substitutions affected the cell surface expression levels of MARCO (some mutants were expressed at lower levels than wild-type MARCO, and they were excluded from the analysis).For the cell adhesion assay, cells transfected on 100-mm dishes with the calcium phosphate method were prepared as follows. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were trypsinized and seeded on 60-mm dishes in complete growth medium containing ascorbic acid (100 μg/ml). The cells were cultured overnight and then detached by a brief trypsin/EDTA-treatment at 40-42 h post-transfection. After inactivation of trypsin with complete growth medium, the cells were centrifuged and washed once with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.2% bovine serum albumin (plating medium). The cells were resuspended into the same medium, allowed to recover for 30 min at 37 °C, and then plated in a volume of 500 μl for 1 h on gelatin- and polylysine-coated coverslips in 4-well plates (platings on gelatin were always done in duplicates). For gelatin coating, a 1% solution (Sigma G-1393, pI 4.7-5.2, average molecular weight 50,000) was incubated on coverslips overnight at 37 °C. Polylysine coating was performed at a concentration of 20 μg/ml overnight at room temperature. Before plating the cells, coverslips were rinsed several times with PBS and once with the plating medium. After the 1-h incubation, the cells plated on gelatin were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. They were then stained for MARCO and F-actin as described previously (36.Pikkarainen T. Brannstrom A. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10975-10982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). MARCO staining was often omitted after the first experiments, because it was found that only MARCO-expressing cells adhered to gelatin. The cells plated on polylysine were taken after the 1-h incubation into an ice-water bath, incubated in ice-cold Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 20 mm Hepes, 3% bovine serum albumin for 10 min, followed by a 45-min incubation with anti-MARCO antibodies diluted in the same solution. After several washes with PBS, the cells were fixed and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies. Coverslips were mounted using DAKO fluorescent mounting medium.Similar adhesion assays were also performed on polyinosinic acid (poly I)-coated coverslips. For the coating, a 200 μg/ml solution (Sigma P-4154; prepared in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated H2O) was incubated on coverslips overnight at room temperature. Before plating the cells, the coverslips were treated as above.When testing the dependence of MARCO-mediated cell adhesion to gelatin or poly I on divalent cations, cells were rapidly washed after trypsin inactivation with 2 mm EDTA in Hanks' balanced salt solution (without Ca2+ and Mg2+) containing 20 mm Hepes, 2 mg/ml glucose, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin (divalent cation-free plating solution). Thereafter, the cells were washed three times with the same solution lacking EDTA, resuspended into the same solution, and allowed to recover before plating on coverslips. Immediately prior to plating, cell suspension aliquots were supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2 (final concentration), 1 mm MgCl2, and both CaCl2 and MgCl2 or were left without any extra cations. Cells were plated for 1 h and then processed as described above.The binding of AcLDL was tested as described previously (19.Chen Y. Sankala M. Ojala J.R. Sun Y. Tuuttila A. Isenman D.E. Tryggvason K. Pikkarainen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12767-12775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For these assays, transfectants were seeded on coverslips 24 h post-transfection. The binding assays were performed in duplicates 45-48 h post-transfection. A third set of cell platings was used for monitoring the cell surface levels of the MARCO proteins by incubating with the anti-MARCO antibodies as described above. In most of the antibody incubation assays, we used polyclonal anti-MARCO antibodies raised against the extracellular part of mouse MARCO (the end of the collagenous domain and the SRCR domain) (5.Elomaa O.

Their elution positions from the calibrated size exclusion column suggested the presence of both monomers and dimers. This was verified by chemical cross-linking with DSP (data not shown). The purified dimers were very stable in physiological buffers but disintegrated into monomers during the desalting step prior to mass analysis and when incubated in hydrophobic solutions (not shown).The x-ray diffraction data for the monomeric form of the SRCR domain were collected with a laboratory source to a resolution of 1.78 Å, whereas the data for the dimeric form were collected at the synchrotron to a resolution of 1.77 Å. Both crystal structures were solved by molecular replacement. After the final refinement, the Rwork and Rfree factors for the monomer are 16 and 21%, respectively, whereas the values for the dimer are 15 and 19%. Both models have good stereochemistry. The monomer contains 67 water molecules and two ions modeled as Mg2+, since this ion was present in the macroseeding solution. The dimer has three bound sulfate ions that originate from the crystallization media and 192 water molecules (Table 1 and Fig. S1). The electron density for the APLA sequence and the side chain of Arg422 could not be seen in the monomeric structure, whereas in the dimeric structure, the electron density was present also for those residues. Both models contain sev"

It starts without significant delay by lateral association of tetramer complexes into unit-length filaments (ULFs) after raising the ionic strength from low salt to physiological conditions (100 mm KCl). We employed electron and scanning force microscopy complemented by mathematical modeling to investigate the kinetics of in vitro assembly of human recombinant vimentin. From the average length distributions of the resulting filaments measured at increasing assembly times we simulated filament assembly and estimated specific reaction rate parameters. We modeled eight different potential pathways for vimentin filament elongation. Comparing the numerical with the experimental data we conclude that a two-step mechanism involving rapid formation of ULFs followed by ULF and filament annealing is the most robust scenario for vimentin assembly. These findings agree with the first two steps of the previously proposed three-step assembly model (Herrmann, H., and Aebi, U. (1998) Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 8, 177-185). In particular, our modeling clearly demonstrates that end-to-end annealing of ULFs and filaments is obligatory for forming long filaments, whereas tetramer addition to filament ends does not contribute significantly to filament elongation.

In particular, our modeling clearly demonstrates that end-to-end annealing of ULFs and filaments is obligatory for forming long filaments, whereas tetramer addition to filament ends does not contribute significantly to filament elongation. Intermediate filaments (IFs) 5The abbreviations used are: IF, intermediate filament; EM, electron microscopy; SFM, scanning force microscopy; ULF, unit-length filament; MFL, mean filament length; MT, microtubule; MF, microfilament. represent one of the three major cytoskeletal filaments of metazoan cells. Together with microfilaments (MFs), and microtubules (MTs), they form the cytoskeleton of the cell, which participates in many cellular functions, including cell division and plasticity, mechanical stress resistance, and organelle transport. Whereas the basic building blocks of MFs and MTs, i.e. actin and tubulin, are globular proteins, those of IFs are elongated with a central α-helical rod domain such that two molecules associate in a parallel, unstaggered fashion to form an extended coiled-coil dimer. In addition, whereas actins and tubulins are ATPases and GTPases, respectively, IF proteins do not have any known enzymatic activity (1Herrmann H. Aebi U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 749-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The self-assembly process of MFs and MTs, whose kinetics have been modeled a long time ago, proceeds via polar association of globular subunits into filamentous structures (2Voter W.A. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10430-10438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Oosawa F. Kasai M. J. Mol. Biol. 1962; 4: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 4Oosawa F.

In contrast, the assembly mechanism of IFs is far less understood. However, for a more rational understanding of the self-organization of cellular supramolecular structures, kinetic modeling of their assembly mechanism is a prerequisite (2Voter W.A. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10430-10438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Oosawa F. Kasai M. J. Mol. Biol. 1962; 4: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 5Wegner A. Engel J. Biophys. Chem. 1975; 3: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Moreover, the fact that MFs and MTs are highly dynamic structures with subunits constantly being removed from one end while being added to their other end, represents a direct consequence of their polar structural nature, i.e. functionally harboring a “fast growing” and a “slow growing” end (6Pollard T.D. Harvey Lect. 2002; 98: 1-17PubMed Google Scholar, 7Andrianantoandro E. Pollard T.D. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 8Kerssemakers J.W. Munteanu E.L. Laan L. Noetzel T.L. Janson M.E. Dogterom M. Nature. 2006; 442: 709-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In contrast, IFs are supposed to be non-polar and their assembly pathway is rather different involving lateral and longitudinal non-polar growth (9Herrmann H. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, the multigene family of IF proteins consists of more than 65 members (10Herrmann H. Hesse M. Reichenzeller M. Aebi U. Magin T.M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2003; 223: 83-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), which have been grouped with respect to their primary amino acid sequence identity into five different sequence homology classes. Keratins belong to the type I and II sequence homology classes, form obligate heterodimeric complexes and are expressed in epithelia (11Herrmann H. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). IF proteins from sequence homology classes III and IV such as vimentin, desmin, neurofilaments, and nestin are expressed in mesenchymal, muscular, and neuronal tissue, respectively (12Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Type III and IV IF proteins are able to coassemble with one another, but not with type I and II proteins. In addition to cytoplasmic IF proteins, vertebrates harbor three nuclear IF genes leading to the differential expression of four major proteins, i.e. lamin A/C, B1, and B2, which exhibit specific features reflecting their distinct nuclear functions (1Herrmann H. Aebi U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 749-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 13Parry D.A.D. Steinert P.M. Intermediate Filament Structure. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1995Google Scholar). These type V IF proteins assemble neither with keratins nor vimentin-type molecules (1Herrmann H. Aebi U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 749-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 11Herrmann H. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). IFs are highly insoluble in physiological buffer and can be solubilized only after denaturation with a chaotropic agent such as, for example, 8 m urea. The first stable soluble oligomers found in vitro after reconstitution in a buffer without urea are tetramers made from two coiled-coil dimers, which are associated approximately half-staggered and in an antiparallel fashion (14Mücke N. Wedig T. Burer A. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. Langowski J. Aebi U. Herrmann H. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 97-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). After initiation of assembly by rapid dilution into physiological ionic strength buffer, tetramers interact laterally without any lag to yield so-called unit-length-filaments (ULFs), which are ∼60 nm long and 17 nm thick, and exhibit a massper-length identical to mature IFs (15Herrmann H. Häner M. Brettel M. Muller S.A. Goldie K.N. Fedtke B. Lustig A. Franke W.W. Aebi U. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 933-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 16Herrmann H. Häner M. Brettel M. Ku N.O. Aebi U. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1403-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). As documented by time-lapse electron microscopy, ULFs subsequently anneal longitudinally, first into immature filaments, which then radially compact to yield mature IFs (15Herrmann H. Häner M. Brettel M. Muller S.A. Goldie K.N. Fedtke B. Lustig A. Franke W.W. Aebi U. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 933-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In the case of certain desmin disease mutants, as well as with “synthetically” engineered vimentin mutants, assembly stops at the ULF stage, indicating that ULFs are bona fide IF assembly intermediates (14Mücke N. Wedig T. Burer A. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. Langowski J. Aebi U. Herrmann H. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 97-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 18Bär H. Mücke N. Kostareva A. Sjoberg G. Aebi U. Herrmann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15099-15104Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We now have investigated for the first time the IF self-assembly mechanism quantitatively by using mathematical modeling of the kinetic reaction parameters. For this purpose we followed the assembly process of recombinant vimentin on a time scale of seconds by determining the length distribution of growing filaments at distinct time intervals by electron microscopy (EM) and scanning force microscopy (SFM) in vitro. In parallel, the time-dependent mean filament length (MFL) was calculated and integrated into a set of models, which describes the IF assembly dynamics. The models were then tested in terms of the previously proposed three-phase IF assembly model suggesting (i) formation of ULFs within seconds; (ii) massive longitudinal annealing of the ULFs into long filaments correlating with a steep increase in viscosity of the assembly solution between 1 and 5 min (3Oosawa F. Kasai M. J. Mol. Biol. 1962; 4: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 15Herrmann H. Häner M. Brettel M. Muller S.A. Goldie K.N. Fedtke B. Lustig A. Franke W.W. Aebi U. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 933-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar); and (iii) radial compaction of the loosely packed filaments into mature IFs, starting at ∼5 min (15Herrmann H. Häner M. Brettel M. Muller S.A. Goldie K.N. Fedtke B. Lustig A. Franke W.W. Aebi U. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 933-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 16Herrmann H. Häner M. Brettel M. Ku N.O. Aebi U. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1403-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In testing this three-phase IF assembly model, we assumed different modes of filament elongation, including tetramer association, ULF addition, and longitudinal annealing of filaments. Considering all possible combinations, we came up with eight different scenarios for the IF assembly process. By fitting these to the time-dependent measured filament length data, we were able to define the most likely assembly scenario. Moreover, this approach allowed us to estimate the essential kinetic parameters of the assembly reaction. The most likely assembly scenario was validated by subjecting it to a sensitivity analysis with respect to its kinetic parameters and assessing the influence of the different reaction steps on the overall assembly scheme. Recombinant human wild-type vimentin was produced and purified from Escherichia coli, strain TG1 (15Herrmann H. Häner M. Brettel M. Muller S.A. Goldie K.N. Fedtke B. Lustig A. Franke W.W. Aebi U. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 933-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Vimentin was dialyzed from 8 m urea in a stepwise fashion (6, 4, and 2 m urea) into 2 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5 (“Pi buffer”) as described previously (19Mücke N. Kreplak L. Kirmse R. Wedig T. Herrmann H. Aebi U. Langowski J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 1241-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 20Mücke N. Kirmse R. Wedig T. Leterrier J.F. Kreplak L. J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 150: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In vitro assembly was started by adding KCl to a final concentration of 100 mm at 37 °C. For SFM, the filaments were diluted at different time points immediately diluted 1:80 in Pi buffer containing 100 mm KCl (“assembly buffer”), immediately before a 30-μl aliquot was deposited on a solid support (see below). After 2 min of adsorption, samples were washed two times with 100 μl of assembly buffer each and imaged. For EM, filament assembly was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of assembly buffer containing 0.2% (w/v) glutaraldehyde. 5-μl sample drops were then placed on carbon-coated copper grids. Images were recorded at room temperature in buffer using the fluid cell of a MultiMode™ microscope with a Nanoscope IIIa controller running the software version 5.12r3 (Veeco, Santa Barbara, CA). Two types of solid supports were used in SFM: freshly cleaved mica and hydrophilic glass. The solid supports were prepared as described in previous studies (19Mücke N. Kreplak L. Kirmse R. Wedig T. Herrmann H. Aebi U. Langowski J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 1241-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 20Mücke N. Kirmse R. Wedig T. Leterrier J.F. Kreplak L. J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 150: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We used 100-μm-long cantilevers with oxide-sharpened silicon nitride tips having a nominal spring constant of 0.38 N/m (type NP-S from Veeco). All images were recorded in tapping mode as 512 × 512-pixel frames covering 8 × 8-μm sample areas using a scanning speed of 1.5 Hz and a cantilever drive frequency ranging between 7.5 and 9.5 kHz. Images were processed using the Nanoscope software and ImageJ (21Abramoff M.D. Magelhaes P.J. Ram S.J. Biophotonics Int. 2004; 11: 36-41Google Scholar). All images were recorded with a Zeiss 900 transmission electron microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) on Kodak SO 163 image plates. For specimen support, carbon-coated EM grids were used that were prepared as follows: thin carbon films were produced in a Baltec SCD 005 sputter coater equipped with a CEA 035 carbon evaporation supply. After evacuation, the chamber was flushed seven times with nitrogen to further remove oxygen. The carbon films, which were evaporated onto mica, were next floated onto a water surface from where they were picked up by plain EM grids (3.05-mm diameter copper grids, 300 square meshes per inch, Agar Scientific). Prior to use, the EM grids were rendered hydrophilic by 2-min glow discharge in a reduced atmosphere of air in the Baltec SCD 005 device. After adsorption of 5-μl aliquots onto the EM grids for 2 min, the samples were washed with distilled water and negatively stained using 2% uranyl acetate (w/v). For image processing the EM film plates were digitized with an Epson Perfection 3170 Photo scanner at 800 dpi and saved as TIFF files. ImageJ (21Abramoff M.D. Magelhaes P.J. Ram S.J. Biophotonics Int. 2004; 11: 36-41Google Scholar) was used to measure the contour length of the filaments. A qualitative description for the assembly of IFs suggests three distinct major phases: (i) ULF formation; (ii) longitudinal annealing of ULFs and growing filaments; and (iii) radial compaction of immature filaments into mature IFs (16Herrmann H. Häner M. Brettel M. Ku N.O. Aebi U. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1403-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). On this basis we described the assembly as a sequence of successive bimolecular reactions that result in the formation of ULFs and elongated filaments. Similar approaches for modeling protein self-assembly have been described by Oosawa and co-workers (22Oosawa F. Asakura S. Thermodynamics of the Polymerisation of Protein. Academic Press, New York1975: 41-55Google Scholar). Note that here we have not modeled the compaction event. Knowing the number of tetramers per μm of filament (16Herrmann H. Häner M. Brettel M. Ku N.O. Aebi U. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1403-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), the so-called linear density, we can express the MFL at any given time. On average, eight tetramers constitute one ULF, and 23 ULFs are contained within 1 μm of filament equivalent to 184 tetramers (13Parry D.A.D. Steinert P.M. Intermediate Filament Structure. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1995Google Scholar). The models used are as follows. “Simple” Model: No Distinction between ULFs and Filaments—The simple model considers four structural states, which are tetramers, octamers, hexadecamers, and ULFs. No distinction is made between ULFs and filaments. An ULF is regarded as the shortest filament possible that is generated. The formation of ULFs constitutes the first step in the three-phase model (16Herrmann H. Häner M. Brettel M. Ku N.O. Aebi U. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1403-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar): two tetramers associate laterally into an octamer, two octamers then associate laterally to yield a hexadecamer; and eventually, two hexadecamers associate laterally into an ULF. Intermediates containing other numbers of tetramers, e.g. three or six, were not considered. Four state variables are defined to represent the four structural states: T, number concentration of tetramers; O, number concentration of octamers; H, number concentration of hexadecamers; and F, number concentration of filaments. The simple model uses three kinetic rate constants. k1 is the rate of lateral aggregation between intermediates (A11 interaction type, as previously reported in (14Mücke N. Wedig T. Burer A. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. Langowski J. Aebi U. Herrmann H. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 97-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar)), kt is the rate of longitudinal aggregation of a tetramer to the end of a filament, and kf is the rate of longitudinal aggregation of two filaments (end-to-end annealing of filaments). From this the following rate equations are derived: dT/dt=-2k1T2-k1TF(Eq. 1) dO/dt=-k1T2-2k1O2(Eq. 2) dH/dt=-k1O2-2k1H2(Eq. 3) dF/dt=-k1H2-kfF2(Eq. 4) The formalism used in the simple model allows expressing the MFL as, Lm(t)=C0-T(t)-2O(t)-4H(t)d1F(t)+corr(Eq. 5) where corr is a correction factor taking into account the length reduction due to the aggregation of ULFs. As reported previously (23Ando S. Nakao K. Gohara R. Takasaki Y. Suehiro K. Oishi Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1702: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), a length reduction during assembly of ∼20 nm can be detected using SFM. A value of 20 nm was used for corr to account for that effect. c0 is the initial concentration of tetramers, and dl is the linear density (184 tetramers per micron of filament) of the vimentin filament (16Herrmann H. Häner M. Brettel M. Ku N.O. Aebi U. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1403-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Hence, the dynamic variable Lm(t) represents the MFL at time t. Extended Model: ULFs and Filaments Are Distinct Species—The extended model assumes that the formation of a first elongated product results from the longitudinal annealing of two ULFs, and it distinguishes between the elongation of filaments by the addition of single tetramers, single ULFs, or end-to-end annealing of longer filaments. As ULFs and filaments are now distinct from each other, the definition of a fifth state variable is required: U is the number concentration of ULFs. Similarly, two extra kinetic parameters have to be defined: k2 is the rate of longitudinal annealing of two ULFs (A22 interaction type (14Mücke N. Wedig T. Burer A. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. Langowski J. Aebi U. Herrmann H. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 97-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar)), and ku is the rate of longitudinal aggregation of an ULF to the end of a filament. The dynamics of tetramers, octamers, and hexadecamers are unchanged and are still governed by (Eq. 1), (Eq. 2), (Eq. 3), but the dynamics of the ULFs and filaments are now described as follows. dU/dt=k1H2-2k2U2-kuUF(Eq. 6) dF/dt=k2U2-kfF2(Eq. 7) By setting a kinetic parameter to zero in the system, the corresponding reaction is not considered. Hence to study all possible mechanisms for filament elongation, the parameters kt, ku, and kf related to tetramer, ULF and filament addition, respectively, are alternatively set to zero. Consequently, the extended model ((Eq. 1), (Eq. 2), (Eq. 3), 6, and 7) considers 23 = 8 different scenarios for filament elongation (see Fig. 1). Although this model does not include a disassembly reaction at this stage, this can easily be added. The MFL over time is now described by, Lm(t)=C0-T(t)-2O(t)-4H(t)-8U(t)+di·lULFU(t)di(F(t)+U(t))(Eq. 8) where lULF is the length of an ULF. The extended model distinguishes between ULFs and filaments during the elongation; therefore the introduction of lULF was necessary to calculate the correct MFL. A sensitivity analysis was performed with the eight scenarios resulting from the extended model. The latter contains p = 5 parameters representing the reaction rates. For each scenario a system of n(p + 1) equations was constructed. Here n represents the number of equations in the model, i.e. the number of structural states considered, n = 5. The model equations ((Eq. 1), (Eq. 2), (Eq. 3), 6, and 7) can be rewritten as, dy/dt=f(t,y,p)(Eq. 9) where f is the right-hand side vector of the equations, y is the five-vector of state variables (T, O, H, U, and F), and pi is the five-vector of parameters (k1, k2, kt, ku, and kf). The sensitivities of structural states with respect to the parameter pi are then defined as the five-vector satisfying the forward sensitivity equation, ddt∂y(t)∂pi=∂f∂y∂y∂pi+∂f∂pi(Eq. 10) obtained by differentiating the original system (Equation 9) with respect to pi. The sensitivities, or the so-called sensitivity coefficients, are the derivatives of the model response with respect to the different parameters; they represent the rates of change of the structural state concentrations with respect to an increase in a given parameter pi. Sensitivity of the MFL to the parameter pi is obtained by differentiating Equation 8 with respect to pi as follows. ∂Lm(t)∂pi(Eq. 11) To compare sensitivities, the normalized coefficients were used, piLm(t)∂Lm(t)∂pi(Eq. 12) and the sensitivity coefficients were determined numerically. The temporal evolution of the MFL for each scenario (Fig. 1) of the extended model was used to fit the MFL observed in the SFM and EM experiments as a function of time (between 10 s and 20 min). Similarly, the dynamics of the five structural states obtained from the numerical solutions were used to fit the SFM and EM observations. This method allowed us to discriminate between the different scenarios to find the best one to describe the in vitro filament assembly kinetics. Moreover, this method provided estimates for the rate constants. The curve fitting work was done with Berkeley Madonna 8.0. 6R. Macey and G. Oster, University of California at Berkeley. For testing the similarity of the results of the MFL on the different specimen supports the Wilcoxon signed rank test was used. This test is a non-parametric test, which does not make any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the measurements. It was demonstrated to yield viable results also for smaller sample sizes. The test is implemented in the MatLab package and tests the equality of the medians of the samples. It calculates two values, p and h; h is zero if the difference in the medians of the tested samples is not significantly different from zero. h is one if the two medians are significantly different. p is the probability of observing a result equally or more extreme than the one using the data, if the null hypothesis is true. p is calculated using the rank values for the differences between corresponding elements in the tested samples. If p is near zero, this casts doubts on the hypothesis of similarity of the tested samples. In addition, we took the mean value of all measurements on one specimen support (mica, n = 1018; carbon grids, n = 3587; and glass, n = 1323). These results, and the confidence intervals at 95%, were integrated into our calculations. In combination with the mean values and the confidence intervals for the individual measurements, this gave an additional measure for the reliability of the measurements on the respective supports (see Fig. 2). Vimentin IF assembly was followed for up to 15 min by recording the MFL at different time points by EM and SFM. For both EM and SFM the filaments need to be immobilized on a solid support, a process that depends on the adhesive properties of the support (19Mücke N. Kreplak L. Kirmse R. Wedig T. Herrmann H. Aebi U. Langowski J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 1241-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). For EM, filament growth was stopped by glutaraldehyde fixation before an aliquot was adsorbed onto a carbon-coated EM copper grid and negatively stained with uranyl acetate (see “Experimental Procedures”). Similarly, for SFM filament growth was quenched by rapid dilution (1:80) of the assembly mixture followed by adsorption of an aliquot to either mica or glass (see “Experimental Procedures”). For vimentin IFs, after 15 min of assembly at 37 °C, the measured MFL values obtained when adsorbed for different times to either carbon-coated copper grids (see Fig. 2A) or mica (see Fig. 2B) appeared rather similar and were closely distributed around the global mean length (see straight gray lines). In contrast, when adsorbed to glass the measured MFL values were more widely spread (see Fig. 2C). The Wilcoxon signed rank test confirmed that there is no significant difference between the results generated on carbon-coated grids and mica, respectively, at the 95% confidence interval (p = 1 and h = 0). In contrast, the results obtained on glass were significantly different from those on mica or carbon films at the same confidence interval (p = 0.03 and h = 1). Taken together, SFM images of IFs adsorbed to glass supports should not be used for quantitative MFL measurements, particularly when the results are compared with those of IFs adsorbed to carbon films imaged by EM. Furthermore, for all subsequent experiments we chose a 2-min adsorption time both to carbon-coated copper grids and mica, because this yielded an optimal filament density for MFL measurements. Vimentin IFs were assembled in vitro at 37 °C for 10 s to 20 min, and assembly reaction was quenched by preparing aliquots for EM or SFM (see above and “Experimental Procedures”). Hence, the resulting EM and SFM images depict the time-dependent elongation of vimentin IFs (see Fig. 3). The contour length of the adsorbed filaments was measured by the public domain software ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) (21Abramoff M.D. Magelhaes P.J. Ram S.J. Biophotonics Int. 2004; 11: 36-41Google Scholar), and from it the MFL was calculated for each time point (Table 1). Instead of the standard deviations, the confidence intervals at 95% are given. This is because the standard deviations became rather large for longer assembly times due to the high fluctuations in the length of the individual filaments (see Fig. 2).TABLE 1MFLs measured from the images recorded with EM and SFMTimeMFL measured by EMMFL measured by SFM0.9 μmNaSample size of the individual measurement.0.45 μmN0.9 μmN0.45 μmNsnmnmnmnm555 ± 2.9bMeasurements with confidence interval.15554 ± 1.14221063 ± 2.140065 ± 1.364698 ± 3.238695 ± 2.73703084 ± 1.950376 ± 1.9515150 ± 4.5356103 ± 3.735360130 ± 5.9356112 ± 2.0466160 ± 4.9391101 ± 3.6352300289 ± 15.7528172 ± 3.9685355 ± 20.9318255 ± 12.8459600418 ± 24.7436233 ± 18.5446542 ± 38.3438302 ± 19.2393900544 ± 34.7603499 ± 67.71661200821 ± 41.4457474 ± 37.1359961 ± 92.5307491 ± 34.1438a Sample size of the individual measurement.b Measurements with confidence interval. Open table in a new tab Based on a qualitative description of the IF assembly process (16Herrmann H. Häner M. Brettel M. Ku N.O. Aebi U. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1403-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), two models were developed: a simple model and an extended model. Both models describe IF assembly as a result of ULF formation followed by filament elongation via longitudinal annealing of ULFs or longer filament. The extended model allows testing different pathways for the in vitro assembly of vimentin IFs. The different pathways are described by eight different scenarios (see Fig. 1). This then allowed determination of the most probable scenario as well as the influences of each reaction involved in the filament polymerization process. Last but not least, we estimated some of the reaction rates by fitting the model to the experimental data. The Simple Model Is in Poor Agreement with the Experimental Data—As documented in Fig. 4, the early steep increase in the measured MFL cannot be explained by the simple model (see (Eq. 1), (Eq. 2), (Eq. 3), (Eq. 4), (Eq. 5) under “Experimental Procedures”). Nevertheless, the simple model was helpful in estimating a numerical value for the rate constant of ULF formation, k1. Accordingly it is obvious from Fig. 4 that k1 has to be in the range of 10-7 m-1 s-1. If k1 were much smaller, the number of ULFs formed would be too low, and hence the filament elongation would slow down. With a k1 of 2 × 10-7 m-1 s-1 50% of the ULFs were formed after 2 s. Based on this evaluation, we chose a k1 of 2 × 10-7 m-1 s-1 for the fitting of the d"
https://openalex.org/W1976594720,"Globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD), also known as Krabbe disease, is a devastating, degenerative neurological disorder. It is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait caused by loss-of-function mutations in the galactocerebrosidase (GALC) gene. Previously, we have shown that peripheral injection of recombinant GALC, administered every other day, results in a substantial improvement in early clinical phenotype in the twitcher mouse model of GLD. While we did detect active enzyme in the brain following peripheral administration, most of the administered enzyme was localized to the periphery. Given the substantial central nervous system (CNS) involvement in this disease, we were interested in determining whether or not a single-dose administration of the recombinant enzyme directly to the CNS, which could potentially be achieved clinically, would result in any substantial improvement. Following intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of GALC we noted a significant, 16.5%, reduction in the GALC substrate psychosine, the abnormal accumulation of which is believed to play a pivotal role in the CNS pathology observed in this disease. Moreover, recombinant GALC was found not only in periventricular regions but also at sites distant to the injection such as the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. Most importantly, animals receiving a single i.c.v. dose of the enzyme at postnatal day 20 survived up to 51 days, which compares favorably to the control twitcher animals, which normally only live to postnatal day 40/42. These results indicate that even a single i.c.v. administration of the recombinant enzyme can have significant clinical impact and suggests that other lysosomal storage disorders with significant CNS involvement may similarly benefit."

Nevertheless, it has been established that extracellular domains of both peptide-GPCRs and amine-GPCRs incorporate functionally important residues.

The atomic detail of this generic GPCR protein fold has been reported for bovine rhodopsin (bRho). This confirmed that the chromophore 11-cis-retinal is covalently linked to TMVII and projects into a binding pocket formed within the TM bundle where it interacts with amino acid side chains and water molecules (1Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M.

Biol. 2004; 343: 1409-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Likewise, the binding pocket for small biogenic amine neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and norepinephrine is buried deep within the TM bundle (3Lu Z.L. Saldanha J.W. Hulme E.C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 140-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Despite this buried location of the ligand binding site, the exofacial domains of bRho are highly structured and interact with each other and with the TM helices. In particular, ECL2 of bRho forms a twisted β-hairpin structure that plunges down into the TM helical bundle to form a plug over the chromophore. There is also evidence that this ECL2 fold is not restricted to bRho and occurs in other GPCRs (4Shi L. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 440-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In addition, the orientation of ECL2 in the majority of GPCRs is restrained by a conserved disulfide bond between ECL2 and the top of TMIII (1Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A.

Biol. 2004; 343: 1409-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar).The neurohypophysial peptide hormones vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OT) are structurally related nonapeptides that generate a wide range of physiological effects, including vasopressor, antidiuretic, and uterotonic actions (5Thibonnier M. Coles P. Thibonnier A. Shoham M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 175-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 6Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 629-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2276) Google Scholar). The effects of AVP/OT are mediated by a family of receptors (V1aR, V1bR, V2R, and OTR), which, together with the receptors for vasotocin, mesotocin, and isotocin from lower vertebrates, constitute a sub-family of the rhodopsin/β-adrenergic receptor class of GPCRs (Family A). The V1aR is widely distributed and mediates nearly all of the actions of AVP with the exceptions of antidiuresis (V2R) and ACTH secretion (V1bR). Activation of the OTR stimulates contraction of the uterine myometrium during labor and mammary myoepithelium to elicit lactation. The V1aR, V1bR, and OTR couple to phospholipase C thereby generating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol as second messengers, whereas the V2R stimulates adenylyl cyclase. In addition to the characteristic architecture of GPCRs, members of the neurohypophysial peptide hormone receptor family share certain sequence motifs and exhibit related pharmacologies (6Gimpl G.

For GPCRs in general, interest in the extracellular domains has focused on ECL2 in particular, because it projects into the binding crevice and there is direct evidence that its conformation changes upon receptor activation (23Banères J.-L.

The aim of this investigation was to provide a comprehensive pharmacological characterization defining the role of all the individual residues comprising the entire ECL2 domain of a peptide-GPCR. Systematic substitution of the V1aR by Ala generated a series of mutant receptors that were subsequently analyzed with respect to ligand binding (agonist/antagonist and peptide/non-peptide) and intracellular signaling. Our results establish that key residues located in ECL2 of the V1aR are required for normal receptor function, identifying Phe189, Asp204, Cys205, Trp206, Phe209, and Tyr218 as essential for high affinity agonist binding and receptor activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—AVP was purchased from Sigma.

The constructs [P212A]V1aR, [W213A]V1aR, [G214A]V1aR, [T215]V1aR, [R216A]V1aR, [A217G]V1aR, and [Y218A]V1aR were engineered using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Cambridge, UK) following the manufacturer's instructions. The antisense primers were: 5′-CGG-GTA-CGC-CAG-GCC-TGG-ATG-AAC-G-3′, 5′-GCG-CGT-ACC-GGC-GGG-CTG-GAT-GAA-CG-3′, 5′-GGC-GCG-GGT-AGC-CCA-GGG-CTG-G-3′, 5′-CAC-GTA-GGC-GCG-GGC-AGC-CCA-GGG-C-3′, 5′-GGT-CAC-GTA-GGC-GGC-CGT-ACC-C-3′, 5′-GGT-CAC-GTA-GCC-GCG-CGT-ACC-C-3′, and 5′-GGT-CAT-CCA-GGT-CAC-GGC-GGC-GCG-GGT-CCC-CC-3′ respectively. The primers contained base changes (in bold) to incorporate point mutations and to ablate a KpnI site (underlined, base change in bold) for screening mutants. The sense primers were complementary to the antisense primers cited above. All receptor constructs were confirmed by automated fluorescent sequencing (University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK).Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK 293T cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum in humidified 5% (v/v) CO2 in air at 37 °C. Cells were seeded at a density of ∼5 × 105 cells/100-mm dish and transfected after 48 h using a calcium phosphate precipitation protocol with 10 μg of DNA/dish (10Hawtin S.R. Ha S.N. Pettibone D.J.

Binding data were analyzed by non-linear regression to fit theoretical Langmuir binding isotherms to the experimental data using Prism (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).

AVP-induced accumulation of inositol phosphates (InsPs) was assayed as described previously (29Hawtin S.R. Wesley V.J. Parslow R.A. Patel S. Wheatley M.

Briefly, following prelabeling of transfected cells with 2 μCi/ml myo-[2-3H]inositol (22.0 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% (v/v) fetal calf serum, a mixed fraction containing mono-, bis-, and trisphosphates (InsP-InsP3) was collected following stimulation by AVP, at the concentrations indicated, in the presence of 10 mm LiCl.RESULTSFunctional Importance of Individual Residues in ECL2 of the V1aR—The individual residues comprising ECL2 of the V1aR, plus the residues at the extracellular boundary of TMV, are presented in Fig. 1. Overall, this segment of the extracellular face of the V1aR encompassed 30 residues, from Phe189 to Tyr218 inclusive. To assess the importance of these residues in V1aR function, each residue was substituted individually by Ala (Ala207 and Ala217 were substituted by Gly) and then pharmacologically characterized using the natural agonist AVP and three structural classes of antagonist: (i) cyclic peptide antagonist (CA), [d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)2]AVP, (30Kruszynski M. Lammek B. Manning M. Seto J. Haldar J. Sawyer W.H. J. Med. Chem. 1980; 23: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar); (ii) linear peptide antagonist (LA), [phenylacetyl-d-Tyr(Me)2Arg6Tyr(NH2)9]AVP); and (iii), nonpeptide antagonist (SR 49059) (31Serradeil-Le Gal C.

The Kd values are presented in Table 1, corrected for radioligand occupancy. The majority of mutant receptors exhibited wild-type pharmacology. Consequently, [S190A]V1aR, [V191A]V1aR, [I192A]V1aR, [E193A]V1aR, [I194A]V1aR, [E195A]V1aR, [V196A]V1aR, [N197A]V1aR, [G199A]V1aR, [T200A]V1aR, [K201A]V1aR, [T202A]V1aR, [Q203A]V1aR, [A207G]V1aR, [T208A]V1aR, [I210A]V1aR, [Q211A]V1aR, [P212A]V1aR, [W213A]V1aR, [G214A]V1aR, [T215A]V1aR, [R216A]V1aR, and [A217G]V1aR had only a slight effect on the binding of the agonist AVP and the three different classes of antagonist (Table 1), indicating that the receptor protein was folded appropriately. The wild-type V1aR and these mutant receptors were all expressed at the same level of 1–2 pmol/mg of protein. Furthermore, the intracellular signaling capability of these mutants was also essentially wild type (Table 2), consistent with the wild-type ligand binding profile of these receptor constructs.TABLE 1Pharmacological profile of ECL2 mutant V1aRsReceptorBinding affinities, KdAVPCALASR 49059nmWild-type V1aR1.0 ± 0.10.7 ± 0.30.5 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.3F189ANo bindingNo bindingS190A2.75 ± 1.011.95 ± 0.770.28 ± 0.061.98 ± 0.46V191A1.91 ± 0.911.61 ± 0.360.22 ± 0.031.35 ± 0.13I192A2.51 ± 0.352.50 ± 0.741.10 ± 0.682.84 ± 0.86E193AaData from Ref. 28.1.53 ± 0.210.93 ± 0.251.02 ± 0.100.28 ± 0.02I194A0.75 ± 0.441.55 ± 0.181.55 ± 0.181.40 ± 0.45E195AaData from Ref. 28.0.89 ± 0.030.63 ± 0.080.18 ± 0.103.39 ± 0.54V196A2.20 ± 0.481.28 ± 0.421.07 ± 0.311.61 ± 0.49N197A2.06 ± 0.381.84 ± 0.352.24 ± 0.593.28 ± 0.71N198QbData from Ref. 42.0.90 ± 0.100.50 ± 0.100.50 ± 0.101.60 ± 0.20G199A1.85 ± 0.432.64 ± 0.440.50 ± 0.082.50 ± 1.30T200A2.34 ± 0.400.55 ± 0.262.37 ± 1.291.48 ± 0.62K201A1.42 ± 0.320.44 ± 0.360.70 ± 0.301.35 ± 0.27T202A1.76 ± 0.081.72 ± 0.192.00 ± 0.962.53 ± 0.52Q203A1.67 ± 0.331.89 ± 0.441.51 ± 0.542.26 ± 0.84D204AaData from Ref. 28.2300 ± 2402.00 ± 0.410.0 ± 3.41.3 ± 1.2C205ANo bindingNo bindingW206A1431 ± 3442.03 ± 0.510.32 ± 0.061.04 ± 0.26A207G1.64 ± 0.111.20 ± 0.350.45 ± 0.131.05 ± 0.05T208A1.09 ± 0.171.85 ± 0.300.70 ± 0.121.84 ± 0.16F209A212 ± 725.90 ± 1.130.10 ± 0.021.22 ± 0.21I210A1.30 ± 0.121.62 ± 0.591.76 ± 0.692.48 ± 0.28Q211A1.95 ± 0.280.94 ± 0.150.88 ± 0.321.47 ± 0.31P212A1.03 ± 0.360.75 ± 0.070.93 ± 0.311.16 ± 0.21W213A1.92 ± 0.862.18 ± 0.400.92 ± 0.232.96 ± 1.51G214A1.50 ± 0.091.16 ± 0.280.29 ± 0.061.33 ± 0.41T215A0.92 ± 0.280.70 ± 0.160.51 ± 0.091.84 ± 0.52R216AaData from Ref. 28.0.80 ± 0.130.44 ± 0.050.46 ± 0.100.93 ± 0.17A217G2.49 ± 0.302.24 ± 0.061.64 ± 0.303.99 ± 1.05Y218A1954 ± 5251478 ± 3570.93 ± 0.2096.1 ± 20.8a Data from Ref. 28Hawtin S.R.

Open table in a new tab In marked contrast, [F189A]V1aR, [C205A]V1aR, [W206A] V1aR, [F209A]V1aR, and [Y218A]V1aR exhibited severely impaired agonist binding, with AVP affinity decreasing ∼2000-fold for [W206A]V1aR, [Y218A]V1aR, and ∼200-fold for [F209A]V1aR, compared with wild type (Fig. 2). The affinity of the three classes of antagonist remained essentially wild type for [W206A]V1aR and [F209A]V1aR (Table 1), indicating that the mutant receptor proteins were folded appropriately. It was noted, however, that the affinity of CA for [F209A]V1aR was decreased 8-fold relative to wild type (Table 1). It should be noted that we recently reported in a separate study (28Hawtin S.R.

Chem. 2006; 281: 38478-38488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that substitution of Asp204 by Ala disrupted agonist binding and intracellular signaling. Consequently, these data will not be discussed in detail here; however, data for [D204A]V1aR are cited in Table 1 to provide a complete study. In addition to the marked decrease in AVP affinity noted above, [Y218A]V1aR also had decreased affinity compared with wild type, for CA (2000-fold) and SR49059 (50-fold). However, LA binding to [Y218A]V1aR was essentially wild type. The LA binding indicated that the overall fold of the receptor was appropriate and, furthermore, allowed quantification of ligand binding affinities to [Y218A]V1aR using [3H]LA as tracer (Table 1). Because neither of the radioligands available bound to [F189A]V1aR nor [C205A]V1aR within the practical concentration range for ligand binding assays, it was not possible to quantify the decrease in ligand affinity at these mutant receptors.FIGURE 2Pharmacological characterization of ECL2 mutant receptors. Radioligand binding assays were performed using a membrane preparation of HEK 293T cells transiently transfected with either: wild-type V1aR (○), [W206A]V1aR (•), [F209A]V1aR (♦), and [Y218A]V1aR (▪) with the competing ligand being AVP (A), CA (B), or SR49059 (C). Data are the mean ± S.E. of three separate experiments each performed in triplicate using [3H]AVP (0.5–1.5 nm) or [3H]LA (0.5–1.0 nm) as tracer.

The severity of the impaired signaling could be divided into three groups: (i) [W206A]V1aR, [F209A]V1aR, and [Y218A]V1aR had EC50 values for AVP-induced accumulation of InsP-InsP3 20-fold, 14-fold, and 39-fold, respectively, greater than wild-type V1aR; (ii) [F189A]V1aR exhibited an EC50 value ∼150-fold greater than wild-type V1aR; and (iii) [C205A]V1aR was incapable of initiating a InsP-InsP3 response when challenged by a high AVP concentration (1 μm). None of the mutant receptors displayed constitutive activity.FIGURE 3Intracellular signaling by ECL2 mutant receptors.

Cell-surface expression of [W206A]V1aR was wild type, whereas the surface expression of [F189A]V1aR, [F209A]V1aR, and [Y218A]V1aR was 60–80% of wild type.

In Escherichia coli and other anaerobes, one of the heterocycles, 4-methyl-5-(β-hydroxyethyl) thiazole phosphate, is biosynthesized from 1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate, tyrosine, and cysteine. Genetic evidence has identified thiH, thiG, thiS, and thiF as essential for thiazole biosynthesis in E. coli. In this paper, we describe the measurement of the thiazole phosphate-forming reaction using purified protein components. The activity is shown to require four proteins isolated as heterodimers: ThiGH and ThiFS. Reconstitution of the [4Fe-4S] cluster in ThiH was essential for activity, as was the use of ThiS in the thiocarboxylate form. Spectroscopic studies with ThiGH strongly suggested that S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) bound to the [4Fe-4S] cluster, which became more susceptible to reduction to the +1 state. Assays of thiazole phosphate formation showed that, in addition to the proteins, Dxp, tyrosine, AdoMet, and a reductant were required. The analysis showed that no more than 1 mol eq of thiazole phosphate was formed per ThiGH. Furthermore, for each mole of thiazole-P formed, 1 eq of AdoMet and 1 eq of tyrosine were utilized, and 1 eq of 5′-deoxyadenosine was produced. These results demonstrate that ThiH is a member of the “radical-AdoMet” family and support a mechanistic hypothesis in which AdoMet is reductively cleaved to yield a highly reactive 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical. This radical is proposed to abstract the phenolic hydrogen atom from tyrosine, and the resultant substrate radical cleaves to yield dehydroglycine, which is required by ThiG for the thiazole cyclization reaction.

Whole cell feeding studies in E. coli and knock-out mutants thereof indicated that Thz-P synthesis is dependent on the precursors tyrosine, cysteine, and 1-deoxy-xylulose-5-phosphate (Dxp) and the enzymes ThiFSGH, ThiI, and IscS (4Vanderhorn P.B.

The Thz-P pathway in B. subtilis is significantly different, since the oxygen-sensitive iron sulfur cluster-containing enzyme ThiH is replaced by ThiO, an oxygen-tolerant FAD-dependent oxidase. ThiO utilizes glycine in the formation of dehydroglycine, the precursor that provides the C2-N3 unit of Thz-P (17Settembre E.C. Dorrestein P.C. Park J.H. Augustine A.M. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E.

The studies of thiazole biosynthesis with purified B. subtilis enzymes have revealed a wealth of mechanistic insight into the action of ThiG, ThiF, ThiS, and ThiI (18Lehmann C. Begley T.P.

Begley T.P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12430-12438Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), which is summarized in Fig. 2. Far less information has been reported about the formation of the thiazole using ThiH and tyrosine. Previously, we reported that the isolation of E. coli ThiH was most efficient when purified from cells overexpressing ThiFSGH and that ThiH could be purified under anaerobic conditions in an apparent 1:1 complex with ThiG (14Leonardi R. Fairhurst S.A. Kriek M. Lowe D.J. Roach P.L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 539: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The iron content of the as isolated ThiGH complex was less than expected for a [4Fe-4S] cluster-containing protein, although a [3Fe-4S] cluster was observed and could be reduced to yield a small amount of [4Fe-4S] cluster. The purified protein was shown to be active, since the addition of anaerobically purified ThiGH complex to a lysate of derepressed E. coli 83-1, together with tyrosine, 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine (Hmp), and ATP, resulted in increased formation of thiamine (15Leonardi R. Roach P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17054-17062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The relative thiamine-forming activity more than doubled upon the further addition of AdoMet, ferric chloride, sodium sulfide, and NADPH. These observations suggest the possibility of chemical iron sulfur cluster reconstitution and an AdoMet-driven reaction, most likely that of ThiH. Mutagenesis of the highly conserved cysteine-rich motif from Salmonella enterica ThiH suggested that these residues function as ligands to the [4Fe-4S] cluster (16Martinez-Gomez N.C. Robers M. Downs D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40505-40510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Here we report for the first time the chemical reconstitution of the iron sulfur cluster of ThiH in the purified ThiGH complex. Spectroscopic studies demonstrate the binding of AdoMet to the reconstituted cluster. We show that Thz-P can be synthesized in vitro using reconstituted ThiGH, an anaerobically purified complex of ThiFS, and a combination of flavodoxin, flavoprotein reductase, and NADPH as a reducing system. In addition, three substrates were required: tyrosine, AdoMet, and Dxp. The Thz-P formed in this reaction was measured in a coupled assay, by adding ThiDE and Hmp to form TP, which was oxidized to the fluorescent thiochrome derivative (23Gerrits J. Eidhof H. Brunnekreeft J.W.I. Hessels J. Method Enzymol. 1997; 279: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These measurements showed that ThiGH was not catalytic in the in vitro assay, but up to 1 mol eq of Thz-P was formed per mole of ThiGH present in the assay. The dependence of the Thz-P-forming reaction on these substrates and the concomitant formation of DOA confirmed that ThiH belongs to the “radical-AdoMet” superfamily.

Molecular biology reagents were obtained from the following suppliers: Pfu polymerase from Stratagene (Amsterdam, The Netherlands), pBadHis from Invitrogen, and restriction enzymes from New England Biolabs (Hitchin, UK). Tryptone and yeast extract were purchased from Oxoid (Fisher). B. subtilis DNA was a kind gift from Prof. P. Glaser (Institute Pasteur, Paris, France). pT-GroESL was a kind gift from Dr. M. Sami (Oxford University) (24Yasukawa T. Kaneiishii C. Maekawa T. Fujimoto J. Yamamoto T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25328-25331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), and pFLAV and pFLDR are pET24d(+) derivatives that express flavodoxin 1 (FldA) and flavoprotein:NADPH oxidoreductase (Fpr), respectively (25Hewitson K.S. Biochemical Characterisation of Escherichia coli Biotin Synthase. Oxford University, 2000Google Scholar), and were a kind gift from Dr. K. S. Hewitson (Oxford University). Methods—All protein purifications, protein reconstitutions, and assays were maintained under nitrogen in an anaerobic glove box with less than <2 ppm of O2 (Belle Technology, Portesham, UK) equipped with an Amersham Biosciences Acta fast protein liquid chromatograph and VC130 sonicator (Sonics and Materials, Newtown, CT). Cell lysates were cleared in 250-ml gas-tight polycarbonate centrifuge bottles (Beckman-Coulter, High Wycombe, UK). A Gilson 321 HPLC work center equipped with a dual wavelength UV-visible detector and a Shimadzu RF-10Axl fluorescence detector was used for analytical HPLC methods; chromatograms were collected and analyzed using the Gilson Unipoint software (Gilson). Mass spectrometry analysis was carried out using a Gilson HPLC coupled to a Thermo Finnigan Surveyor MSQ single quadrupole mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization. The data were collected and processed using the XCalibur software system, and multiple charged species were analyzed by Promass Deconvolution (Thermo, Altrincham, UK). Spectroscopy—EPR spectra were recorded at X-band on a Bruker ELEXSYS 500 spectrometer with an ER049X microwave bridge using an ER4122SHQ cavity. The experiments at low temperature used an ESR 900 liquid helium flow cryostat and ITC3 temperature controller (Oxford Instruments). Cluster concentration was estimated by double integration of spectra by comparison with a 1mm Cu(EDTA) standard. UV-visible spectra of ThiGH (1 mg/ml) were recorded with an Ocean Optics (Duiven, The Netherlands) USB2000 spectrophotometer using a light source Mini-D2-GS connected by optical fibers P-400-2-UV/SR to a cuvette holder inside the glove box. Chemical Synthesis—Hmp and 4-methyl-5-(β-hydroxyethyl) thiazole phosphate (Thz-P) were prepared as described previously (26Andersag H. Westphal K. Chem. Ber. 1937; 70: 2035-2044Crossref Google Scholar, 27Leder I.G. Greenberg D.M. Metabolic Pathway: Metabolism of Sulfur Compounds. 3rd Ed. Vol. 7. Academic Press, New York1975: 57-85Google Scholar). Dxp was synthesized as described by Taylor et al. (28Taylor S.V. Vu L.D. Begley T.P. Schorken U. Grolle S. Sprenger G.A. Bringer-Meyer S. Sahm H. J. Org. Chem. 1998; 63: 2375-2377Crossref Google Scholar) and purified as described by Leonardi and Roach (15Leonardi R. Roach P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17054-17062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Plasmid Construction—A plasmid pMK060 was constructed to allow N-terminal His6 tag extended proteins to be expressed under the control of a pBAD promoter. Using PCR, a sequence encoding a new N-terminal His tag was added by the insertion of CCATGCACCACCACCACCACCATG after the A at position 317 of pBAD-His, immediately followed by the original NcoI site. The new start codon is shown in boldface type and yields proteins with an N-terminal Met-His6-Ala sequence. B. subtilis ThiE was amplified to include a N-terminal Met-Ala-His6 tag and inserted into pET24d(+), yielding pMK131. The open reading frames were amplified by PCR, the purified PCR products were restricted, and the resultant fragments were ligated into a suitably restricted parent plasmid to yield the product plasmids shown in Table 1. The PCR amplification of ThiFS introduced an NcoI restriction site and modified the N terminus of ThiF to introduce an addition of Val after the natural Met start codon.TABLE 1Plasmids constructed or used in this studyPlasmidInsertParent plasmidRestriction sitesReferencepMK060N-terminal His6 tagpBADHisAThis studypRL1020E. coli thiFSGHpBADHisANcoI/XhoIRef. 14Leonardi R.

Cells were grown at 37 °C in Fernbacher flasks (4 liters) containing 2YT medium (1.25 liters) with the required antibiotic (ampicillin (100 mg/liter), kanamycin (34 mg/liter), chloramphenicol (25 mg/liter)), using isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) or arabinose (2 g/liter) induction when the A600 nm reached 0.60. The induced cultures were grown for a further 4 h at 27 °C, and cells were harvested by centrifugation. FldA was expressed from BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pFLAV as described previously (25Hewitson K.S. Biochemical Characterisation of Escherichia coli Biotin Synthase. Oxford University, 2000Google Scholar) using growth medium fortified with FMN (2 mg/liter). Fpr was co-expressed with GroESL in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pFLDR and pT-groESL (24Yasukawa T. Kaneiishii C. Maekawa T. Fujimoto J. Yamamoto T. Ishii S. J. Biol.

Oxford University, 2000Google Scholar). Anaerobic Protein Purification—All protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin for calibration, and protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE using 15% acrylamide gels (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were stored at –80 °C until use. A general protocol for the anaerobic purification of His6-tagged proteins was used and is described below with protein-specific modifications described afterward. Inside the anaerobic glove box, cell paste (30 g) was resuspended in anaerobic buffer A (100 ml, 50 mm MOPS, 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.7), to which was added lysozyme (10 mg) and benzonase (20 μl). The cell suspension was stirred for 1 h at room temperature followed by sonication (30× 1-s burst (20 W)/min for 30 min) in a flask cooled in a water bath (∼10 °C) inside the glove box. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation (Beckman JA-14; 13,000 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C), and the cleared lysate was applied to a nickel-charged chelating Sepharose column (30 ml) previously equilibrated in anaerobic buffer A (200 ml). The column was washed with 150 ml of buffer A, and then the protein was eluted using an imidazole gradient to 250 mm over 50 ml using buffer C (buffer A plus 500 mm imidazole) followed by a 100-ml isocratic wash. The desired protein fractions (30-ml maximum) were pooled and desalted on a 50-ml Superdex S-75 column pre-equilibrated in buffer D (50 mm MOPS, 100 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol). The protein fractions (10 ml) were stored at –80 °C in sealed 15-ml Falcon tubes. For ThiGH, the general protocol was modified by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (16 mg in 1 ml of isopropyl alcohol) to the lysis buffer. After applying the protein to the nickel-charged Sepharose column, the column was washed with 100 ml of buffer B (buffer A plus 500 mm NaCl) followed by 50 ml of buffer A. For the Superdex 75 column, 5 mm DTT was added to buffer D. In the purification of E. coli ThiD, a second gradient (50 ml) was used for the nickel-charged column to reach a higher imidazole concentration (500 mm), followed by an isocratic wash (100 ml). The protocol was modified for ThiFS by eluting from the nickel-charged column with a gradient to a lower imidazole concentration (125 mm). Aerobic Protein Purifications—Fpr and FldA were purified under aerobic conditions at 4–7 °C and stored at –80 °C. Fpr was purified as follows. Cells with expressed Fpr were stirred aerobically in buffer E (50 mm Tris, 10% (v/v) glycerol, pH 8.1, lysozyme (200 mg/liter), and benzonase (200 μl/liter)) at room temperature for 30 min. The suspension was sonicated on ice using 30 bursts of 30 s in 30 min. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation (Beckman JA14; 13,000 rpm) and applied to a 200-ml Q-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated in buffer F (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.1), washed with buffer F, and eluted with a 500-ml gradient to 40% buffer G (buffer F plus 1 m NaCl). The yellow fractions were pooled, and ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration of 2 m. A Phenyl Source column (200 ml) was pre-equilibrated in buffer H (buffer F plus 2 m ammonium sulfate), and protein was eluted with a gradient over 500 ml to 100% buffer F. The yellow fractions were pooled, concentrated, and further purified on a Superdex S-75 column (33 × 850 mm) equilibrated in buffer F. Fpr-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated to 1.4 mm. FldA was purified by a method similar to that described by Osborne et al. (31Osborne C. Chen L.M. Matthews R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1729-1737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified FldA (1 ml, 1.38 mm) was reconstituted by incubation with an equimolar concentration of FMN (10 μl, 140 mm) for 2 h at 37 °C. Excess FMN was removed by applying the solution to an NAP-10 gel filtration column pre-equilibrated in buffer F (20 ml). Reconstitution and Concentration of ThiGH—DTT solution in buffer D (25 μl, 200 mm) was added to a sample of purified ThiGH complex (1 ml, 83 μm) and gently mixed. After 15 min, 5 mol eq of FeCl3 in water (40 μl, 10 mm) were added carefully in small aliquots (5 μl), and after a further 10 min, 5 mol eq of Na2S in water were added likewise (total added 40 μl, 10 mm). The protein solution was incubated for another 2 h, and then the precipitated iron sulfide was removed by applying the solution to a NAP-10 gel filtration column pre-equilibrated and eluted with buffer D. The iron content was analyzed by the methods of Fish (32Fish W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Reconstituted ThiGH could be concentrated to a maximum concentration of 40 mg/ml using a Biomax 5000 molecular weight cut-off Ultrafree 0.5-ml centrifugal filter (Millipore, Watford, UK). Radiochemical Assay with l-[U-14C]Tyrosine—For experiments with radiolabeled substrates, ThiGH was purified as described previously (14Leonardi R. Fairhurst S.A. Kriek M. Lowe D.J. Roach P.L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 539: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and reconstituted. To samples of as isolated or reconstituted ThiGH (final concentration 55 μm) was added AdoMet (1.68 mm), FldA (12 μm), Fpr (61 μm), and NADPH (1.6 mm), followed by [U-14C]tyrosine (8.9 μm, 0.5 μCi) in a total volume of 124.5 μl. This was divided into 20-μl aliquots and incubated at 37 °C for 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, or 480 min. Negative control experiments were prepared that lacked AdoMet but were otherwise treated identically to the normal assays. At the indicated time points, the samples were frozen (–80 °C). Reactions were stopped by thawing in air and were analyzed by spotting samples (1 μl) onto normal phase TLC plates. These plates were developed in n-propanol/ethyl acetate/water (6:1:3) and dried in air, and radioactivity was monitored by autoradiography using films exposed for 16 h. The following Rf values were obtained in this solvent system for unlabeled standards: 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (0.92), tyrosine (0.61), and glyoxylic acid (0.31). Radiochemical Assay with [methyl-14C]AdoMet—To solutions of as isolated or reconstituted ThiGH (final concentration 62 μm) was added FldA (21 μm), Fpr (4 μm), NADPH (0.93 mm), tyrosine (925 μm), and [methyl-14C]AdoMet (47 μm, 0.25 μCi) in a total volume of 107 μl. This was divided into 10-μl aliquots. Negative control experiments were prepared that lacked tyrosine but were otherwise treated identically to the normal assays. The aliquots were incubated at 37 °C for 0, 30, 60, 120, 240, and 480 min prior to freezing (–80 °C). Samples were thawed in air and directly spotted onto a reverse phase TLC plate (2 μl). The TLC plates were developed in acetonitrile/buffer H in a ratio of 1:3, where buffer H is an aqueous solution of acetic acid (25 mm) and octanesulfonic acid (8 mm). TLC plates were air-dried, and the radioactivity was monitored by autoradiography using films exposed for 16 h. EPR Studies of Reconstituted ThiGH—Two aliquots of anaerobically purified ThiGH (1 ml, 133 μm) were each incubated with DTT (25 μl, 200 mm) for 10 min, FeCl3 (33 μl, 20 mm) for 10 min, and Na2S (39.6 μl, 20 mm) for 90 min. The mixtures were centrifuged (Stratagene Picofuge, maximum speed) to remove precipitated protein and excess iron sulfide. The concentration of reconstituted ThiGH in the resultant solution was estimated to be 69 μm. Reagents were added to a sample of reconstituted ThiGH (250-μl fractions in duplicate) in the order shown to give the following final concentrations: buffer (negative control), AdoMet (1.67 mm), tyrosine (1.77 mm), AdoMet (1.67 mm) plus tyrosine (1.77 mm), or sinefungin (1.77 mm). One of each duplicate sample was reduced by the addition of dithionite (0.9 mm). Samples of these solutions (200 μl) were frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen in quartz EPR tubes. Spectra were recorded under the following conditions: temperature, 10 K; microwave frequency, 9.4340 GHz; microwave power, 2 milliwatts; and field modulation amplitude, 0.4 milliteslas. HPLC Assay for TP as Thiochrome—TP-containing solutions were oxidized with an alkaline solution of K3(Fe(CN)6), neutralized, separated by HPLC, and analyzed by fluorescence detection as described previously (15Leonardi R. Roach P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17054-17062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). HPLC-MS Analysis of ThiGH Assays and Protein Samples—The eluate from the HPLC column was split in a 1:4 ratio, and the main flow was sent to a dual wavelength absorbance detector set at 215 and 260 nm. The minor flow was diluted with make-up solvent from a third pump, which added acetonitrile/H2O with 0.3% formic acid at 0.5 ml/min. This flowed into the mass spectrometer and was analyzed in ES+ mode. DOA was detected using a Synergy Polar-RP column (4 μm, 80 Å, 150 × 4.6 mm) with the following solvents: solvent A was water with 0.1% formic acid, adjusted to pH 3.8 with NH4OH; solvent B was 90% (v/v) acetonitrile, 10% (v/v) H2O. The column was equilibrated in solvent A at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min, and the sample was injected, after which the following elution profile was applied: 6 min isocratic (100% solvent A) and then a 20-min gradient to 50% solvent A, followed by a 5-min gradient to 10% solvent A, 5 min isocratic at 10% solvent A, and a 4-min gradient to 100% solvent A, 15 min isocratic at 100% A. DOA and tyrosine were measured in a sample using a Phenomenex ODS (3Pohl M. Sprenger G.A. Muller M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2004; 15: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) Prodigy (5 μm, 100 Å, 250 × 4.6 mm) column equilibrated and solvents C (0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid) and D (acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) using the same elution profile.

Chemother. 2005; 55: 1051-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 4Hall B.G. Salipante S.J. Barlow M. J. Mol. Evol. 2003; 57: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Class A, C, and D enzymes use an active site serine residue as a nucleophile, whereas class B lactamases (generically termed metallo-β-lactamases, MβLs) 9The abbreviations used are: MβL, metallo-β-lactamase; EXAFS, extended x-ray absorption fine structure; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. employ one or two Zn(II) ions to cleave the β-lactam ring. MβLs have particular importance in the clinical setting since they can hydrolyze a broader spectrum of β-lactam substrates than the serine-type enzymes and are resistant to most clinically employed inhibitors (5Galleni M.

The design of an efficient pan-MβL inhibitor has been mostly limited by a striking diversity in the active site structures, catalytic features, and metal ion requirements for activity among different enzymes. Based on this heterogeneity, MβLs have been classified into three subclasses: B1, B2, and B3 (3Frere J.M. Galleni M. Bush K. Dideberg O. J. Antimicrob.

Comparison of the tertiary structure of enzymes belonging to the different subclasses reveals a common αβ/βα sandwich fold, in which different insertions and deletions have resulted in different loop topologies and, ultimately, in different zinc coordination environments and metal site occupancies among B1, B2, and B3 enzymes (Fig. 1). MβLs bind up to two metal ions in their active sites. In B1 and B3 enzymes, one Zn(II) ion (Zn1) is tetrahedrally coordinated to three histidine ligands (His116, His118, and His196 in Fig. 1) and a water/OH– molecule (3-H site) (14Fabiane S.M. Sohi M.K. Wan T. Payne D.J. Bateson J.H. Mitchell T. Sutton B.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12404-12411Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 15Concha N. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Herzberg O.

Biol. 1998; 284: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The coordination polyhedron of Zn2 in B1 enzymes is provided by Asp120, Cys221, His263, and one or two-water molecules (DCH site). Notably, this site represents the active species in mono-Zn(II) B2 enzymes (25Garau G. Bebrone C. Anne C. Galleni M. Frere J.M. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Instead, two mutations (Cys221 → Ser and Arg121 → His) affect the Zn2 coordination geometry in B3 MβLs, and the metal ion is bound to Asp120, His121, His263, and one- or two-water molecules, while Ser221 is no longer a metal ligand (DHH site) (28Ullah J.H. Walsh T.R. Taylor I.A. Emery D.C. Verma C.S. Gamblin S.J. Spencer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). A remarkable exception is provided by the deepest branching member of the MβL B3 subclass, GOB from E. meningoseptica (4Hall B.G. Salipante S.J. Barlow M. J. Mol. Evol. 2003; 57: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In all reported GOB sequences, His116 and Ser221 are substituted by Gln and Met, respectively, suggesting the presence of an unusually perturbed metal binding site. Here we show that E. meningoseptica GOB-18 represents a novel type of broad spectrum MβL unique in being maximally active in the mono-Zn(II) form and in which the metal ion occupies only the Zn2, DHH site. This contrasts with two generally accepted ideas: broad spectrum MβLs are maximally active in the dinuclear form (B1 and B3 enzymes), and mono-Zn(II) enzymes are carbapenemases (B2 enzymes). Finally, the findings presented here confirm that Zn2 is central for MβL-mediated catalysis and that the attacking nucleophile could be provided either by a non-metal center or by the Zn2 site. This claims for a revisited strategy for the design of broad spectrum MβL inhibitors. Source of GOB-18 Coding Sequence—An E. meningoseptica clinical strain from the Hospital Clemente Alvarez (Rosario, Argentina), identified by API 20NE (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), was used as the source of the genomic DNA for cloning the GOB-18 coding gene. DNA Cloning and Construction of the Expression Vector for GOB-18—Genomic DNA from the E. meningoseptica clinical strain used here was isolated essentially as described in ref (35Ausubel K.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore R.E. Seidman I.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987Google Scholar). The complete coding sequence of the gob-18 gene was amplified by employing primers 1 and 2 described in Ref. 32Bellais S. Aubert D. Naas T. Nordmann P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 1878-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar. The DNA fragment was sequenced and two new primers were designed (see supplemental material) to clone the mature GOB-18 coding sequence cloned into BamHI-HindIII sites of pETGEXTerm vector (13Orellano E.G. Girardini J.E. Cricco J.A. Ceccarelli E.A. Vila A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10173-10180Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) in frame to the 3′-end of Schistosoma japonicus glutathione S-transferase gene, for expression purposes. The resulting recombinant pET-GOB-18 plasmid produces GOB-18 as a C-terminal fusion to glutathione S-transferase. The nucleotide sequence reported in this paper was assigned accession number DQ004496 in the combined EMBL/GenBank™/DDBJ sequence data base. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was achieved using a rapid PCR-based method with modifications (36Costa G.L. Bauer J.C. McGowan B. Angert M. Weiner M.P. Trower M.K. In Vitro Mutagenesis Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1996Google Scholar and see supplemental material). Protein Expression and Purification—GOB-18 wild-type and mutants were overproduced in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS and E. coli BL21(DE3) Codon Plus RIL cells, respectively, transformed with plasmid pET-GOB-18, pET9a-Gln116 → His GOB-18, pET9a-Asp120 → Ser GOB-18, or pET9a-Cys201 → Ser GOB-18. We followed protein expression and purification procedures described before (13Orellano E.G. Girardini J.E. Cricco J.A. Ceccarelli E.A. Vila A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10173-10180Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) with modifications. The purification average yields were of ∼12 mg of GOB-18 or Cys201 → Ser GOB-18, 6 mg of Gln116 → His GOB-18, and 3 mg of Asp120 → Ser GOB-18, per liter of culture, and rendered polypeptides of 31 kDa at a purity higher than 95%, as estimated by SDS-PAGE (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Pure enzymes were dialyzed twice against 100 volumes of 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, NaCl 0.2 m, pooled, and then stored at 4 °C for immediate use. The concentration of purified enzymes was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm in a Jasco V-550 spectrophotometer, using the theoretically calculated molar extinction coefficient (32,200 m–1 cm–1 for GOB-18, Gln116 → His GOB-18 or Asp120 → Ser GOB-18, and 32,075 m–1 cm–1 for Cys201 → Ser GOB-18) (38Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). Biochemical Characterization of Wild-type GOB-18 and Mutants—Size exclusion chromatography was done on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). The molecular mass of purified GOB-18 was measured by mass spectrometry/electrospray using an LCQ Duo Ion Trap mass spectrometer at the mass spectrometry facility LANAIS-PRO, University of Buenos Aires. Circular Dichroism spectra of protein samples in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 50 mm NaCl were measured at 25 °C, using a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter flushed with N2. The amount of solvent exposed cysteine thiols in GOB-18 was determined employing 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in native and SDS-unfolded samples (39Riener C.K. Kada G. Gruber H.J. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2002; 373: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The GOB-18 and Gln116 → His GOB-18 apoproteins were prepared by treating samples ∼0.1 mm in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, with chelating agents in mild denaturing conditions (see supplemental material). The Zn(II) derivatives were prepared by dialyzing the apo-GOB-18 or apo-Gln116 → His GOB-18 against 100 volumes of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, with an equimolar concentration of ZnSO4. The Fe(II)-GOB-18 derivative was prepared in the same way using instead (NH4)Fe(SO4), under anaerobic conditions, with O2-free N2 efflux and addition of 1 mm sodium dithionite. The reduced state of the metal ion was verified colorimetrically using o-phenanthroline. The Fe(III)-GOB-18 derivative was prepared taking advantage of Zn(II) dissociation at acidic pH values retaining the iron content. Holo-GOB-18 was dialyzed against 100 volumes of polybuffer TAMS (50 mm Tris, 50 mm sodium acetate, 50 mm MES, and 500 mm NaCl) adjusted to pH 4.5 (twice). Then pH was raised by dialysis against 100 volumes of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, and 50 mm NaCl (twice). Metal Content Determination—The metal content of the purified enzymes was measured by inductively coupled plasmaatomic emission spectrometer or by atomic absorption spectroscopy in a Metrolab 250 instrument operating in the flame mode. Determination of IC50 Value—The concentration required to effect 50% inhibition of enzyme activity (IC50) was determined by preincubating GOB-18 (2 nm) in 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 30 °C, with increasing EDTA concentrations for 1 min, prior to the initiation of the assay by the addition of 1 mm cefotaxime. A plot of steady-state hydrolysis rate versus inhibitor concentration provided the basis for the assessment of the IC50 value. Determination of the Kinetic Parameters—The hydrolysis of the antibiotics was monitored by following the absorbance variation resulting from the hydrolysis of the β-lactam ring. The reaction medium employed was 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl. All measurements were performed at 30 °C. The kinetic parameters Km and kcat were derived from initial rate measurements, recorded on a Jasco V-550 spectrophotometer, and were estimated by nonlinear data fitting to the integrated form of the Michaelis-Menten equation. pH Dependence—The pH dependence of GOB-18-mediated cefotaxime hydrolysis was determined by performing measurements in the polybuffer TAMS adjusted from pH 4.0 to pH 8.0 with increments of 0.5 pH units, at 1 mm substrate concentration (see supplemental material). X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy—Samples of GOB-18 (∼1 mm) were prepared with 20% (v/v) glycerol, and loaded in Lucite cuvettes with 6-μm polypropylene windows, before rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen. X-ray absorption spectra were measured at the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY), beamline X9B, with a Si(111) double crystal monochromator; harmonic rejection was accomplished using a nickel focusing mirror. Data collection and reduction were accomplished according to published procedures (40Thomas P.W. Stone E.M. Costello A.L. Tierney D.L. Fast W. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7559-7569Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). XAS data were collected on two independently isolated samples. As each data set gave similar results, the spectra were averaged; the data in Fig. 3 represent the average of the two data sets (12 scans total). Fourier filtered EXAFS data (Δk = 1–13 Å–1; Δr = 0.5–2.1 Å, first shell or 0.1–4.5 Å for multiple scattering fits) were fit utilizing theoretical amplitude and phase functions calculated with FEFF v.8.00 (41Ankudinov A.L. Ravel B. Rehr J.J. Conradson S.D. Phys. Rev. B. 1998; 58: 7565-7576Crossref Scopus (4107) Google Scholar). The zinc-nitrogen scale factor and the threshold energy, ΔE0, were calibrated to the experimental spectrum for tetrakis-1-methylimidazole zinc(II) perchlorate, Zn(MeIm)4 (42McClure C.P. Rusche K.M. Peariso K. Jackman J.E. Fierke C.A. Penner-Hahn J.E. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2003; 94: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and held fixed (at 0.78 and –21 eV, respectively), as were similarly determined values for iron (0.78 and –21 eV), in all subsequent fits to the data for GOB-18. First shell fits were then obtained for all reasonable coordination numbers, including mixed nitrogen/oxygen ligation, while allowing the absorber-scatterer distance, Ras, and the Debye-Waller factor, σ 2as, to vary; the best fits are presented in the supporting information. Multiple scattering contributions from histidine ligands were fit according to published procedures. Metal-metal (zinc-iron and iron-zinc) scattering was modeled with reference to the experimental EXAFS of Zn2(salpn)2 and Fe2(salpn)2. NMR—NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance II 600 spectrometer operating at 600.13 MHz at different temperatures, as indicated. 1H NMR spectra were recorded under conditions to optimize detection of the fast relaxing paramagnetic resonances, either using the superWEFT pulse sequence or water presaturation. Spectra were acquired over large spectral widths with acquisition times ranging from 16 to 80 ms and intermediate delays from 2 to 35 ms. One-dimensional experiments with solvent presaturation were used to record isotropically shifted signals closer to the diamagnetic envelope. EPR—EPR was recorded at 9.63 GHz with 2-milliwatt microwave power and 5-G (0.5 mT) magnetic field modulation at 100 kHz, using a Bruker EleXsys E500 spectrometer equipped with an ER4116DM cavity operating in perpendicular mode and an Oxford Instruments ESR900 helium flow cryostat and ITC503 temperature controller. Biochemical Characterization of GOB-18—The gene coding for a GOB-type MβL was cloned from a carpabenem-resistant E. meningoseptica clinical strain. Sequence analysis indicated a predicted molecular mass of 31.4 kDa for the encoded protein. At the time of sequencing there were 17 known variants of GOB enzymes. This protein differed from those reported previously and was named GOB-18. This enzyme differed from the firstly reported GOB enzyme, GOB-1 (32Bellais S. Aubert D. Naas T. Nordmann P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 1878-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), by three conserved mutations: Leu94 → Phe, Ala137 → Val, and Asp282 → Asn (standard consensus numbering) (5Galleni M. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Rossolini G.M. Spencer J. Dideberg O. Frere J.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 660-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Recombinant GOB-18 was overproduced as a fusion to GST in the cytoplasm of E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells, cleaved, and purified to homogeneity. GOB-18 is a monomeric enzyme according to size exclusion chromatography. Mass spectrometry confirmed the molecular mass expected from the gene sequence. The β-lactamase activity (measured as cefotaxime hydrolysis) was inhibited by EDTA with an IC50 of 2.3 ± 0.3 mm, indicating that GOB-18 holds a tightly bound divalent cation essential for activity. Inductively coupled plasma and atomic absorption analyses showed that recombinant GOB-18 contained significant amounts of zinc and, notably, iron. Although the relative amounts of these two metals varied among different enzyme preparations (0.45–0.75 iron/GOB-18 and 0.01–0.20 zinc/GOB-18), the total metal content never exceeded one metal ion per protein molecule. Addition of excess Zn(II) did not alter the CD spectrum of GOB-18 as isolated, neither in the near nor in the far UV (data not shown). Overall, these data suggest that GOB-18 is a mono-metallic enzyme, in sharp contrast to the other B3 MβLs. The apoprotein was devoid of lactamase activity that could be recovered by addition of Zn(II). Remarkably, apo-GOB-18 remetallated with Zn(II) bound only one equivalent of Zn(II) and its activity largely exceeded that of the enzyme as isolated (Fig. 2). On the other hand, Fe(II)-GOB-18 and Fe(III)-GOB-18 displayed negligible activities compared with that of Zn(II)-GOB-18. In fact, Fe(III)-GOB-18 was poorly active even upon addition of Zn(II), suggesting that both metal ions compete for the same binding site. The kinetic parameters of Zn(II)-GOB-18, reported in Table 1, show that mono-Zn(II)-GOB-18 presents a broad substrate spectrum for β-lactams, similarly to that shown by dinuclear B3 enzymes. Addition of 20 μm Zn(II) to the reaction medium did not modify the enzyme kinetic parameters.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of different β-lactam substrates by fully loaded wild type Zn(II)-GOB-18 and Zn(II)-Gln116 → His GOB-18 mutantSubstrateGOB-18Gln116 → His GOB-18kcatKmkcat/KmkcatKmkcat/Kms-1μmμm-1 s-1s-1μmμm-1 s-1Penicillin G680 ± 80330 ± 302.1 ± 0.4664 ± 9380 ± 201.7 ± 0.1Cefaloridine30 ± 231.5 ± 0.50.95 ± 0.08NDNDCefotaxime83 ± 288 ± 60.94 ± 0.0913.1 ± 0.158 ± 20.23 ± 0.01Imipenem42 ± 926 ± 21.6 ± 0.519.3 ± 0.458 ± 30.33 ± 0.02Meropenem72.5 ± 0.540 ± 101.8 ± 0.5NDND Open table in a new tab The pH dependence of GOB-18-mediated cefotaxime hydrolysis showed a plateau between pH values of 6 and 8, and an acidic limb, resulting in a complete inactivation at pH ≤ 4.5. This loss of activity could be reverted by raising the pH to 6.5, indicating that the inactivation is reversible. Metal content analysis at different pH values showed that the decrease in activity at low pH paralleled the dissociation of Zn(II) from the enzyme, despite the fact that most of the Fe(III) remained bound up to pH 4 (see supplemental material). Overall, these data show that Zn(II)-GOB-18 is the active β-lactamase species. GOB-18 preparations with larger zinc/iron ratios were the most active ones, in line with this observation (see supplemental material). Expression of the complete GOB-18 gene (including a transit peptide sequence) in E. coli results in an enzyme secreted to the periplasm confering β-lactam resistance to the bacterial host. Isoelectrofocusing analysis of the periplasmic fraction after osmotic shock revealed that the enzyme is present exclusively in the Zn(II) form, suggesting that iron uptake could be due to an artifact of protein overexpression in E. coli cytoplasm. X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy—EXAFS data recorded at the zinc and iron edges, k3χ((k), and the corresponding Fourier transforms for GOB-18 are shown in Fig. 3. EXAFS curve-fitting results are presented as supporting information. Fits to Fourier-filtered first shell scattering (0.5–2.1 Å) in the case of Zn(II)-GOB-18 suggest coordination to 4 nitrogen/oxygen donors at a distance of 2.01 Å (Fit Zn-1). Fit residuals did not improve significantly upon inclusion of a sulfur, or a mixed shell of nitrogen/oxygen. Multiple scattering analysis indicates ligation to 2 histidine residues (Fit Zn-2). The low Debye-Waller factor for the second multiple scattering path (C1-N1) most likely reflects some rotation of the imidazole plane about the axis normal to the zinc-nitrogen bond. Inclusion of a single zinc-carbon scattering interaction at a distance of 2.71 Å, representing carboxylate carbon scattering, modestly improved the fit (∼15%) (Fit Zn-3). In the case of Fe(III)-GOB-18, single shell fits give an average of 5 nitrogen/oxygen scatterers at 2.11 Å (Fit Fe-1). Inclusion of a sulfur atom increased the fit residual. The larger metal-ligand distance is consistent with a higher coordination number for iron relative to zinc. Separate shells of 3 oxygen atoms at 2.04 Å and 2 nitrogen atoms at 2.20 Å could be resolved (Fit Fe-2), and multiple scattering fits indicate the presence of two His ligands (Fit Fe-3). Inclusion of an iron scatterer in fits for Zn(II)-GOB-18 (Fit Zn-4) and a zinc scatterer in fits for Fe(III)-GOB-18 (Fit Fe-3) slightly improved the fits but led to different metal-metal distances (3.61 and 3.55 Å, respectively). This allows us to discard the existence of a heterodimetallic site in GOB-18. Thus, EXAFS data, together with the biochemical studies, suggest that Zn(II) and Fe(III) compete for the only metal binding site in GOB-18. Based on this, we decided to exploit Fe(III) as a spectroscopic probe of the metal site. Spectroscopic Characterization of Fe(III)-GOB-18—The UV-visible spectrum of Fe(III)-GOB-18 revealed an absorption band centered at 375 nm, which was not present in the apoenzyme nor in the Zn(II)-reconstituted form (Fig. 4A). This feature can be attributed to a typical His-Fe(III) charge transfer band, similar to those observed in lipoxygenase, iron superoxide dismutase, and other non-heme, non-Fe-S iron proteins (43Averill B.A. Vincent J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 226: 33-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). EPR spectra of GOB-18 recorded at 6 K and 25 K (Fig. 4B) indicated an isolated, “rhombic” (i.e. mean E/D ∼ 1/3) Fe(III) ion. The almost complete loss of the MS = |±1/2 〉 (or MS = |±5/2 〉) signals at 25 K suggests a zero field splitting, Δ, of less than about 30 cm–1. The asymmetry of the lines at geff ∼ 4.3 and at geff ∼ 9 indicates significant strain in E/D, although the shoulder on the crossover at geff ∼ 4.3 (Fig. 4B, inset) indicates a lower degree of strain than in the often-seen “adventitious iron” signal and provides strong evidence for the Fe(III) being tightly protein-bound. In contrast to the iron-loaded glyoxyla"
https://openalex.org/W2103176901,"The transcriptional activator complex HIF-1 plays a key role in the long term adaptation of cells and tissues to their hypoxic microenvironment by stimulating the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis and glycolysis. The expression of the HIF-1 complex is regulated by the levels of its HIF-α subunits that are degraded under normoxic conditions by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Whereas this pathway of HIF-α protein degradation has been well characterized, little is known of their turnover during prolonged hypoxic conditions. Herein, we describe a pathway by which HIF-1α and HIF-2α proteins are constitutively degraded during hypoxia by the proteasome system, although without requirement of prior ubiquitylation. The constitutive/hypoxic degradation of HIF-α proteins is independent of the presence of VHL, binding to DNA, or the formation of a transcriptionally active HIF-1 complex. These results are further strengthened by the demonstration that HIF-α proteins are directly degraded in a reconstituted in vitro assay by the proteasome. Finally, we demonstrate that the persistent down-regulation of HIF-1α during prolonged hypoxia is mainly caused by a decreased production of the protein without change in its degradation rate. This constitutive, ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation pathway of HIF-α proteins has to be taken into account in understanding the biology as well as in the development of therapeutic interventions of highly hypoxic tumors.

Changes in gene expression in response to decreased oxygen availability are largely regulated by the activity of the HIF-1 complex, a transcriptional activator complex constituted with two types of subunits: HIF-β that is constitutively expressed and HIF-α, whose expression is regulated by oxygen (reviewed in Refs. 1Semenza G.L.

The interaction of HIF with VHL is greatly enhanced by the hydroxylation of prolyl residues located in the oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODD) of the α proteins (5Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H.

In the HIF-1α isoform, Pro-402 and Pro-564 residues are the substrates for hydroxylation that are mediated by specific prolyl-hydroxylase enzymes. These enzymes belong to a family of iron-containing hydroxylases (i.e. PHD1, PHD2, and PHD3) that have low affinity for oxygen and can act as oxygen sensors (7Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A.

Science. 2001; 294: 1337-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (2091) Google Scholar). Under conditions of oxygen sufficiency, the HIF-α proteins are hydroxylated, ubiquitylated, and degraded by the proteasome system. Thus, in normoxia the HIF-α protein half-life is extremely short, and very low or undetectable levels are found in well oxygenated cells. During hypoxia, HIF-1α accumulates, dimerizes with HIF-1β, and forms the transcriptionally active HIF-1 complex. Similar increases in HIF-1 complexes are found in normoxic VHL-deficient cells because of their inability to degrade HIF-α proteins (9Kaelin W.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 627-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Whereas the above described mechanism provides a tight control of HIF-α levels under normoxic conditions, little is known about the mechanisms that may control the fate of HIF-α proteins in hypoxic cells. Several transcription factors have more than one mechanism of control that operates under variable conditions of stimulation. Moreover, there is evidence that transcriptional activity by itself may regulate the survival of transcription factors as a way to control its unlimited activity (10Muratani M. Tansey W.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). For some of these factors, there is a functional overlap between protein sequences that activate transcription and those required for signal-dependent ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (11Salghetti S.E. Muratani M. Wijnen H. Futcher B. Tansey W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 3118-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). By having the destruction of transcription factors “hard wired” into the transcription process, cells ensure that repeated rounds of transcription are constantly replenished by newly synthesized factors, and furthermore, it ensures that activators do not persist longer than are required. A consequence of these mechanisms of control is the requirement that degradation complexes be formed close to the site of transcription. Indeed, there is now clear evidence that proteasomal components interact with chromatin and can influence transcription at multiple levels (12Conaway V.R. C. Brower C.S. Conaway J.W. Science. 2002; 296: 1254-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 13Lipford J.R. Smith G.T. Chi Y. Deshaies R.J.

The proteasome is composed of a 20S proteolytic core capped by two 19S regulatory complexes responsible for recognition of ubiquitylated proteins (15Schimdt M. Hanna J. Elsasser S. Finley D. Biol. Chem. 2005; 386: 725-737PubMed Google Scholar). Most proteins that are degraded by the proteasome system need first to be ubiquitylated, but there are several examples of proteins, including transcription factors that are degraded by the proteasome without prior ubiquitylation (16Liu C.W. Corboy M.J. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. Science. 2003; 299: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 17Hoyt M.A. Coffino P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1596-1600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated pathway for HIF degradation requires the presence of VHL to form the ubiquitylating complex that also includes Cul2, elongin B, and elongin C. However, there is evidence for alternative, VHL-independent degradation pathways of HIF-α proteins (18Demidenko Z.N. Rapisarda A. Garayoa M. Giannakakou P. Mellilo G. Blagosklonny M.V. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4829-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19Kong X. Lin Z. Liang D. Fath D. Sang N. Caro J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2019-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying this VHL-independent degradation pathway and its role during prolonged hypoxia have not been characterized. Demidenko et al. (18Demidenko Z.N. Rapisarda A. Garayoa M. Giannakakou P. Mellilo G. Blagosklonny M.V. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4829-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) recently reported that HIF-1α levels in hypoxic cells were overinduced by pretreatment with transcriptional inhibitors, suggesting that HIF-1α accumulation is limited by transcription-dependent depletion. This phenomenon was independent of the presence of VHL and HIF-1α hydroxylation. The authors suggested a model by which HIF-1α accumulation transactivates a feedback control loop that induces HIF-1α degradation, possibly mediated by acetylation. Herein, we report that in addition to the canonical oxygen and VHL-dependent pathway, HIF proteins (HIF-1α and HIF-2α) are constitutively degraded by the proteasome system utilizing an oxygen, VHL, and ubiquitin-independent mechanism. This last mechanism appears to be independent of the formation of HIF-1 complexes, DNA binding, or the transactivating activity of the protein and likely utilizes the 20S proteasome for degradation. Cell Culture—Cell lines HT1080, Hela, A549, 786-0, Caki-1, HTB-26, C4, 1C1C7 were from ATCC. RCC4 VHL (–/–) and VHL (+/+) were generously provided by Dr. Ratcliffe (Oxford, UK), and ts20 cells were from Dr. H. L. Ozer (Rutgers). Cells, with the exception of ts20, were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in recommended medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. ts20 cells were cultured at 35 or 39 °C according to the experimental requirements (20Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2264-2267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1393) Google Scholar). For hypoxia treatment, cell dishes were placed in an oxygen station (In VIVO2, Ruskin Tech), flushed with gas containing 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2 and incubated for the indicated times. Chemicals and Reagents—Common chemicals, solvents, and general reagents were from Sigma. Cycloheximide, desferroxamine, E64, leupeptin, lactacystin were from Sigma; MG132, Epoxomicin, ALLN, ALLM, and Z-VAD-FMK were from BioMol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Immunoblots and Immunoprecipitations—Antibodies were purchased as follows: monoclonal anti-hHIF-1α from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA); polyclonal anti-HIF-2α from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO); monoclonal anti-mHIF-1α from R&D Systems; monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 from Sigma; monoclonal anti-α-tubulin from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); polyclonal anti-ubiquitin from Stressgen (Ann Arbor, MI). p21 rabbit polyclonal antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-cyclin B1 monoclonal from BD Biosciences. The preparation of cell extracts for Western blots was as described previously (19Kong X. Lin Z. Liang D. Fath D. Sang N. Caro J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2019-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were homogenized in 8 m urea buffer (8 m urea in 10 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 5 mm dithiothreitol in the presence of a 1× protein inhibitor mix) with a portable Ultra-Turrax homogenator. 60 μg of total cell extract for each sample were resolved by SDS-PAGE using either 7.5 or 4–20% gradient gels (Bio-Rad), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and immunoblotted with primary and subsequently with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. An ECL-plus kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used for development. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described (19Kong X. Lin Z. Liang D. Fath D. Sang N. Caro J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2019-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Triton, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) in the presence of a 1× protease inhibitor mix. The primary antibody incubation was performed for 4 h at 4°C followed by precipitation with protein A-Sepharose (Pierce). Precipitates were extensively washed in lysis buffer for subsequent immunoblots. Plasmids and Transfections—Full-length HIF-1α, HIF-1αΔ1–27, HIF-1αΔ392–575 (originally provided by Dr. Semenza, Johns Hopkins), HIF-1α P402A, P564G (originally provided by Dr. P. Ratcliffe, Oxford), HIF-1α1–391, HIF-1α393–580, and HIF-1α393–580 P402A, P564G were cloned into pCMV-3FLAG-1A vector containing FLAG tag (Stratagene) and PCDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) by PCR-based strategies; mutant constructs including K532R, Δ695–785 were generated using the QuikChange Site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The ODD-nl plasmid, containing a nuclear localization signal, was based on the pShooter vector from Invitrogen. All plasmids were validated by DNA sequence analysis. Transfections were performed as previously described using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) (19Kong X. Lin Z. Liang D. Fath D. Sang N. Caro J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2019-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Protein Degradation in in Vitro Reconstituted Proteasomal Assays—Rat liver 20S proteasome was purified as described (21Alvarez-Castelao B. Castaño J.G. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4797-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 22Arribas J. Castaño J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13969-13973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The different HIF-1α constructs were in vitro transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase, and translated in the presence of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Amersham Biosciences) using the TnT system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Degradation reactions were performed essentially as described (21Alvarez-Castelao B. Castaño J.G. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4797-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and contained in a final volume of 20 μl: 20 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 μl of the respective 35S-labeled HIF-1α construct and 0.5–1 μg of purified rat liver proteasome (35–70 nm). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for the times indicated and stopped with concentrated SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Control reactions contained 10 μm MG132. Samples, after boiling for 5 min, were loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Gels were stained, destained, dried under vacuum, and exposed to x-ray film at –70 °C for 14–24 h as required. Quantitation was performed using the Quantity-One Software (Bio-Rad). RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using a kit (RNeasy) from Qiagen (Valencia, CA) and utilized for reverse transcription (RT) as described (19Kong X. Lin Z. Liang D. Fath D. Sang N. Caro J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2019-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). RT-PCR against mouse HIF-1α utilized primers as follows: forward, 5′-TCTCGGCGAAGCAAAGAGTCTGAA-3′; reverse, 5′-CACAAATCAGCACCAAGCACGTCA-3′. HIF-1α and HIF-2α Proteins Are Constitutively Degraded by a VHL-independent Mechanism—We first evaluated the role of the proteasome system in degrading HIF-α proteins in the absence of VHL by treating VHL-deficient (–/–) cells with the proteasome inhibitor Z-LLL-CHO (MG132) and measuring the accumulation of proteins following exposure for up to 12 h. Fig. 1A shows that MG132 treatment induced a steady accumulation of HIF-1α and HIF-2α in RCC4 cells, while no significant changes were observed in tubulin levels. HIF-2α also accumulated in 786-O cells, which do not express HIF-1α. No changes were observed in the levels of HIF-1β (ARNT) protein (not shown). Similar results to those obtained with MG132 were obtained with more specific proteasome inhibitors like lactacystin and epoxomycin, while other protease inhibitors like E64, leupeptin, and calpain inhibitors (Z-VAD-FMK and ZLL-CHO) were not effective (data not shown). At the concentrations used, there was no evidence of cell toxicity or apoptosis. The steady accumulation of HIF-α proteins in cells treated with proteasome inhibitors indicated that there is a continuous turnover of these proteins in VHL-deficient cells. To further study this turnover, we treated VHL (–/–) cells with cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, and measured the rate of HIF-α protein decay. Fig. 1B shows that in the absence of VHL, both HIF-1α and HIF-2α proteins are degraded with a half-life of about 3–4 h. More importantly, a similar pattern of degradation was observed in HT1080 cells stimulated by hypoxia plus desferroxamine (Dfx) and exposed to cycloheximide (Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained in several other cell lines including HeLa, HTB-26, and RCC4 (VHL (+/+)) cells, as well as in RCC4 (VHL (–/–)) cells equally treated with Hx and Dfx. In all cases, the effect of cycloheximide was completely abrogated in the presence of the proteasomal inhibitors MG132, epoxomycin, and lactacystin, but not by calpain inhibitors, clearly suggesting that the observed degradation of the proteins is due to the proteolytic activity of the proteasome. These results indicated that HIF-α proteins are continuously degraded, even during severe hypoxic conditions, by the proteasome system in a VHL-independent way. VHL-independent Degradation of HIF Proteins Does Not Require Ubiquitylation—Because in the absence of VHL or under the condition where PHD enzymes are highly inhibited (hypoxia plus desferroxamine) the “normal” HIF-α ubiquitylation system is impaired, we investigated whether ubiquitylation was at all necessary for the VHL-independent degradation. For this purpose we utilized ts20 cells that have a temperature-sensitive E1 enzyme and therefore, at the non-permissive temperatures, ubiquitylation is almost completely impaired (20Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2264-2267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1393) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows that in ts20 cells exposed to 39 °C for 18 h, exposure to cycloheximide induces the decay of HIF-1α with a half-life of about 3–4 h, and that this effect is completely reversed by proteasome inhibitors MG132, epoxomycin, and lactacystin (Fig. 2B). When the same cell line was cultured at 35 °C and exposed to hypoxia for 18 h, it was found that the HIF-1α decay was similar to the 39 °C-treated cells and equally prevented by MG132 treatment (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, we confirmed the inactivation of the E1 enzyme at 39 °C by finding that p21, a degradation ubiquitin-independent protein, was equally degraded at 35 or 39 °C, while cyclin B1, a degradation ubiquitin-dependent protein, was only degraded at 35 °C (supplemental Fig. S1). Unfortunately, the degradation of HIF-2α in ts20 cells could not be studied because its level of expression was below the sensitivity of the assay. To confirm that ubiquitylation was not involved in HIF-α protein degradation, we exposed RCC4 VHL-competent (+/+) and -incompetent (–/–) cells to MG132, immunoprecipitated HIF-1α, and performed immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2D, HIF-1α accumulated in VHL (–/–) cells is not ubiquitylated whereas it is highly ubiquitylated in similarly MG132-treated RCC4-VHL-competent cells. The immunoprecipitation data are consistent with the pattern of HIF-1α migration in SDS-PAGE (7.5%) shown in Fig. 2E, where accumulated HIF-1α in VHL (+/+) cells display the typical polyubiquitylated forms, while only a single HIF-1α band is observed in VHL (–/–) cells. Sequences Involved in the Hypoxic Degradation of HIF-1α in Cultured Cells—To further characterize the sequences and possible mechanisms involved in the constitutive/hypoxic degradation of HIF-1α, we utilized FLAG-tagged constructs containing various deletions or mutations of HIF-1α in transient transfection assays in HT1080 cells. Following exposure to hypoxia plus desferroxamine, transfected cells were treated with cycloheximide, and the HIF-1α half-life was determined by Western blots using anti-FLAG antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3A, the full-length protein was degraded like the endogenous one, and its degradation was not affected by mutations involving a putative acetylation site (K532R) or the ODD hydroxylation sites (P402A, P564G). Significantly, the N-terminal 391 amino acid construct (1–391) was quite stable suggesting that sequences downstream of AA 391 were needed for degradation. Indeed, addition of downstream sequences, AA 1–575 and AA 1–695, which encompass the ODD, were clearly degraded (Fig. 3A). The role of the ODD in determining HIF-1α degradation was confirmed by showing that a construct with a deletion of the ODD (AA 392–575) had a decreased degradation rate compared with the wild-type protein (Fig. 3A). Analysis of the ODD domain in isolation revealed that its half-life is about 3–4 h, very similar to the entire protein, and was independent of the presence or absence of an added nuclear localization sequence (not shown). HIF-α Proteins Are Degraded by the 20S Proteasome Using in Vitro Reconstituted Assays—A number of proteins, including transcription factors, have been shown to be degraded by the 20S proteasome in an ubiquitin-independent way (16Liu C.W. Corboy M.J. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. Science. 2003; 299: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 17Hoyt M.A. Coffino P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1596-1600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether HIF-α was degraded by the 20S proteasome, we utilized in vitro degradation assays with purified rat liver 20S proteasomes and in vitro translated HIF proteins (22Arribas J.

As shown in Fig. 3B, HIF-1α and HIF-2α were degraded by the 20S proteasome, and addition of MG132 prevented its degradation. Most importantly, degradation in vitro matched well with the degradation requirements demonstrated in cultured cells, as the N-terminal fragment 1–391 was quite stable, whereas the HIF-1α construct 1–575 was rapidly degraded. The degradation rate of the ODD-deleted construct was intermediate between the wild-type HIF-1α and the stable N-terminal fragment. With the same proteasome preparations used in HIF in vitro degradation and under the same assay conditions, we performed control experiments of degradation of in vitro transcribed and translated IκB and p65, as previously reported (21Alvarez-Castelao B. Castaño J.G. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4797-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). IκB was degraded (50% degradation in 30 min), whereas p65 was not significantly degraded after 3 h of incubation (data not shown). Is the Constitutive Pathway Regulated?—Many transcription factors are regulated by their own transcriptional activity. This process could be secondary to the activation of genes that enhance their degradation, such as the case of p53 up-regulating Mdm-2 or by accelerating its degradation during their interactions with the basal transcriptional machinery (10Muratani M. Tansey W.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Of importance, protein sequences that are involved in degradation are usually contained or overlap transcriptional active domains (11Salghetti S.E. Muratani M. Wijnen H. Futcher B. Tansey W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 3118-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Recently, Demidenko et al. (18Demidenko Z.N. Rapisarda A. Garayoa M. Giannakakou P. Mellilo G. Blagosklonny M.V. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4829-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) reported that the HIF-1 complex would regulate its own activity through a negative feedback loop that would enhance HIF-1α destruction. To study the role of HIF-1 complex transcriptional activity on HIF-1α degradation, we utilized a mouse hepatoma cell line (HEPA) that is deficient in HIF-1β (ARNT (–/–)) and therefore cannot form active HIF-1 complexes (23Salceda S. Beck I. Caro J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Measurements of HIF-1α decay following exposure to hypoxia plus desferroxamine for 4 h revealed that the HIF-1α half-life was similar in ARNT (–/–) and ARNT (+/+) cells (Fig. 4A). Moreover, it was not affected by a more prolonged hypoxic stimulation up to 48 h. To further study the relationship between HIF-1α transcriptional activity and protein turnover, we utilized a mutant HIF-1α that lacks the N-terminal DNA binding motif (HIF-1α-(28–826)). As shown in Fig. 4B, the deleted and wild-type HIF-1α were found to have similar half-lives when transfected into HEPA or HT1080 cells, suggesting that the half-life of HIF-1α is independent of its binding to DNA. Similarly, no effect on HIF-1α turnover was found utilizing a construct containing a deletion of the C-terminal transactivation domain (Δ786–826) (not shown). Thus, it appears that HIF-1α turnover in hypoxic conditions is independent of the formation of transcriptionally active HIF-1 complexes or their binding to DNA. Prolonged Hypoxia Decreases HIF-1α Levels but Does Not Affect Degradation—Several studies have indicated that HIF-1α levels steadily decrease during prolonged hypoxia, whereas the levels of HIF-2α are minimally affected (24Uchida T. Rossignol F. Matthay M.A. Mounier R. Couette S. Clottes E. Clerici C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14871-14878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 25Holmquist-Mengelbier L. Fredlund E. Lofstedt T. Noguera R. Navaroo S. Nilsson H. Pietras A. Vallon-Christersson J. Gradin K. Poellinger L. Pahlman S. Cancer Cell. 2006; 10: 413-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The mechanism for the decline in HIF-1α levels is not clear, and both increased degradation (18Demidenko Z.N. Rapisarda A. Garayoa M. Giannakakou P. Mellilo G. Blagosklonny M.V. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4829-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and decreased production of the protein have been proposed (36Brugarolas J. Lei K. Hurley R.L. Manning B.D. Reiling J.H. Hafen E. Witters L.W. Kaelin W.G. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2893-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Results utilizing HT1080, A549, and Caki-1 cells (Fig. 5A) confirmed that following a prolonged hypoxia, HIF-1α levels decrease substantially. Interestingly, HIF-2α was much less or not affected at all. Of note, we also observed a great variation in the degree of HIF-1α down-regulation between various cells lines. HIF-1α levels decay more rapidly in A549 and Caki-1 than in HT1080, HeLa, or RCC4 cells (not shown). Notably, despite the significant decrease in HIF-1α levels, prolonged hypoxia did not significantly affect the half-life of the protein, as shown in Fig. 5B. These results in HT1080 and A549 cells are similar to the findings in HEPA cells, already shown in Fig. 4A. Similarly, prolonged hypoxia did not affect the half-life of HIF-2α (not shown). Thus, the decrease in HIF-1α protein observed during prolonged hypoxia appeared more likely mediated by a decrease in its rate of synthesis rather than its increased degradation. To evaluate HIF-1α biosynthetic rates, we treated cells with MG132 and measured the accumulation of the protein during short periods of treatment. Fig. 5C shows that the accumulation of HIF-1α during 3 h of exposure to MG132 is markedly decreased in cells pre-exposed to hypoxia for 21 h compared with that found in normoxic cells or cells concomitantly exposed to hypoxia and MG132 for only 3 h. Hypoxia had no significant effect on the levels and accumulation of HIF-2α. The role of the HIF-1 complex on the decreased production of HIF-1α protein during prolonged hypoxia was evaluated in HEPA ARNT (+/+) and ARNT (–/–) cells. As shown in Fig. 5D, prolonged hypoxia reduced the levels of HIF-1α only in ARNT (+/+) cells, while no effect was found in ARNT (–/–) cells. The effect of prolonged hypoxia is not secondary to changes in mRNA because no significant changes in HIF-1α messenger were observed between 8 and 24 h of hypoxia. As it was found in the other cell lines studied, the levels of HIF-2α were not affected by more prolonged hypoxia and were not affected by the presence or absence of ARNT (supplemental Fig. S2). These results indicate that the down-regulation of HIF-1α during prolonged hypoxia is secondary to an HIF-1 complex-dependent decreased production of the protein. Hypoxia-inducible complex-1 is the major transcriptional activator of genes that respond to the absence or inadequacy of oxygen supply. Among them are genes involved in glucose metabolism, angiogenesis, and apoptosis; all of them of importance in adaptation to hypoxia and in cancer growth (26Gruber M. Simon M.C. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2006; 13: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The HIF-1 complex is formed by two types of subunits: HIF-β that is constitutively expressed and HIF-α that is regulated by oxygen tension (reviewed in Refs. 1Semenza G.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (5242) Google Scholar, 2Bardos J.I. Ashcroft M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1755: 107-120PubMed Google Scholar, 3Brahimi-Horn C. Pouyssegur J. Bull. Cancer. 2006; 93: E73-E80PubMed Google Scholar). The two major components of the α-type, HIF-1α and HIF-2α have been extensively studied, whereas HIF-3α is still poorly characterized. Multiple studies have indicated that the expression, regulation, and targeted genes of both subunits may be quite different as may be their role in tumor development (27Raval R. Lau K.W. Tran M. Sowtwer H. Mandriota S. Li J. Pugh C.W. Maxwell P.H. Harris A.L. Ratcliffe P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5675-5686Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 28Carroll V.A. Ashcroft M. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 6264-6270Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Of relevance, a recent report indicates that in neuroblastoma HIF-2α is the major subunit involved in HIF-1 complex formation and thus conferring a more malignant phenotype (25Holmquist-Mengelbier L. Fredlund E. Lofstedt T. Noguera R. Navaroo S. Nilsson H. Pietras A. Vallon-Christersson J. Gradin K. Poellinger L. Pahlman S. Cancer Cell. 2006; 10: 413-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Under adequate oxygenation, the HIF-α subunits are rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system by a mechanism that involves their hydroxylation and recognition by the VHL protein that acts as their ubiquitin-ligase (E3). During hypoxia, this process is disrupted, and HIF-α proteins accumulate and form the transcriptionally active HIF-1 complex. Likewise, in VHL deletions or mutations, HIF-1α proteins accumulate and activate their target genes (9Kaelin W.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 627-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Whereas this process of degradation that assures a tight control during normoxia has been extensively characterized, little is known about the mechanisms that control the levels of HIF-α proteins during continuous hypoxia. Our results indicate that during hypoxia, HIF-α proteins are in dynamic equilibrium and in constant turnover with a half-life of about 2–4 h. As would be expected, this process is independent of hydroxylation and interactions with VHL, because during hypoxia the hydroxylases are inactive because of the deficit of oxygen. Most interestingly, this process is independent of ubiquitylation as it occurs with similar efficiency in E1-deficient and proficient cells (Fig. 2). Though unexpected, this finding is not completely unusual, as ubiquitin-independent degradation has been described for several proteins, including transcription factors (16Liu C.W. Corboy M.J. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. Science. 2003; 299: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 17Hoyt M.A. Coffino P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1596-1600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these cases, degradation appears to be mediated by direct interaction of the target protein with the α ring of the 20S proteasome. Typical examples are the degradation or ornithine decarboxylase, p21cip, IκBα, and the retinoblastoma protein Rb (29Asher G. Bercovich Z. Tsvetkov P. Shaul Y. Kahana C. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 645-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 30Lee H. Zeng S.X. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26876-26883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Sdek P. Ying H. Chang D. Qui W. Zheng H. Touitou R. Allday M.J. Xiao Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 699-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 32Asher G. Reuven N. Shaul Y. Bioessays. 2006; 8: 844-849Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In the case of IκBα, following exposure to different stimuli, the protein is phosphorylated and degraded by the ubiquitin-26S-proteasome pathway. However, independent of this stimulation-induced degradation, the protein undergoes continuous turnover that is not mediated by previous polyubiquitylation. In vitro studies have shown that the protein can be directly degraded by the 20S proteasome and that this degradation involves specific interactions with the α2 (C3) subunit of the core proteasome (22Arribas J. Castaño J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13969-13973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the retinoblastoma protein also appears to be degraded by the 20S proteasome in a process that requires no ubiquitylation, but is greatly enhanced by its interaction with MDM2, which facilitates the binding to the C8 subunit of the 20S proteolytic complex (31Sdek P. Ying H. Chang D. Qui W. Zheng H. Touitou R. Allday M.J. Xiao Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 699-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms involved in the constitutive/hypoxic degradation of HIF-α proteins are still not clear, our results indicate that this process is not mediated by acetylation or hydroxylation, though the ODD sequences appear to have a predominant role. The transfection studies clearly demonstrate that the N terminus of the protein is quite stable and addition of ODD promotes degradation. However, these experiments do not rule out that other downstream sequences may also be involved. In vitro studies showed that HIF-α proteins were efficiently degraded by the 20S proteasome. Most importantly, the in vitro results conformed to the in vivo data showing that the N-terminal 391 amino acids were resistant to degradation, while addition of the ODD enhanced degradation. Targeting of proteins to the 20S proteasome appears to require the presence of an unstructured or disordered protein region; that is, regions that lack secondary structure (16Liu C.W. Corboy M.J. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. Science. 2003; 299: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 17Hoyt M.A. Coffino P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1596-1600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These regions are believed to promote “gating” of the proteasome and allow the penetration of the target protein inside the proteolytic core. In some cases accessory molecules are involved as in the case of the human cytomegalovirus protein pp71, which targets the hypophosphorylated members of the retinoblastoma family for ubiquitin-independent degradation (33Kaletja R.F. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3263-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Recent structural studies of the HIF-ODD region (AA403–603) have shown that under physiological conditions this region of the protein is highly unstructured, thereby accounting for the high versatility of this area, i.e. interactions with PHDs, VHL, p53, and ARD1 (34Sanchez-Puig N. Veprintsev D.B. Fersht A.L. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 11-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It is yet unclear how HIF-α proteins interact with the 20S proteasome; however, an earlier report indicated that HIF-α can interact with the α-4 subunit through binding to the HIF-α inhibitory domain (695–785) or the ODD (403–603) (35Cho S. Choi Y. Kim J.M. Jeong S. Kim J.H. Kim S.H. Ryu S.E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). One important mechanism by which cells can control the level and activity of transcription factors is by having their degradation “hard wired” to the transcription process itself. This process ensures that the transcription factors are in the proper conformation and do not linger longer than when they are needed. The exact nature of how transcriptional activity and destruction are linked is not completely clear, but several mechanisms have been proposed. Lipford et al. (13Lipford J.R. Smith G.T. Chi Y. Deshaies R.J. Nature. 2005; 438: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) have classified transcription factors as class A if degraded regardless of binding DNA, and class B and C if targeted only once they have bound DNA. In the case of HIF-α proteins, degradation was independent of DNA binding as the deleted N-terminal protein was degraded at the same rate as the wild-type form. Moreover, degradation rates were independent of the interaction with ARNT or the presence or absence of the C-terminal transcriptional domain. Notably, the rate of degradation was not significantly affected by prolonged hypoxia exposure. These results indicate that in contrast to p53 (10Muratani M. Tansey W.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), HIF-1α appears not to have a feedback mechanism to control its own degradation rate. However, as already noted by others, prolonged hypoxia decreases HIF-1α levels, affecting less HIF-2α (22Arribas J. Castaño J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13969-13973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Salceda S. Beck I. Caro J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Of note, this effect varies significantly between different cell lines and may depend also on cell confluence or cell proliferation. 3J. Caro, unpublished observations. The decrease in HIF-1α levels during prolonged hypoxia is mediated by a decrease in its production rather than by an increase in its degradation rate. This decrease in production, in turn, depends on the presence of an active HIF-1 complex, because it does not occur in the ARNT (–/–) cells. At least two mechanisms mediated by HIF-1 transcriptional activity that would inhibit HIF-1α production during prolonged hypoxia have been described. One involves the induction of REDD1, which acting through the mTOR pathway would inhibit HIF-1α mRNA translation (36Brugarolas J. Lei K. Hurley R.L. Manning B.D. Reiling J.H. Hafen E. Witters L.W. Kaelin W.G. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2893-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). The other involves the transcriptional activation of a natural antisense messenger that would inhibit HIF-1α mRNA translation or accelerate its decay (22Arribas J. Castaño J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13969-13973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Thrash-Bingham C.A. Tartof K.D. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Of interest, this last mechanism appears not to affect the HIF-2α mRNA (22Arribas J. Castaño J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13969-13973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is unclear whether those mechanisms operate in every cell type and which one predominates under different physiological or pathological conditions. In summary we describe a novel pathway of constitutive/hypoxic degradation of HIF-α proteins that is independent of VHL, ubiquitylation, and does not depend on the transactivation activity of the HIF-α proteins. This pathway is likely very important in the regulation of HIF-α proteins during sustained hypoxia. In this respect, it likely has more importance in the long term regulation of HIF-2α rather than HIF-1α, because the latter would autoregulate its expression by decreasing its production. Importantly, recent studies in neuroblastomas have shown that HIF-2α may be the main regulator of long term hypoxic gene expression. This finding may be true for other tumors where sustained hypoxic conditions are encountered. Thus, inhibition of this pathway may be relevant for the inhibition of HIF-1 complex in tumor therapy.

However, the mechanism of the acid-induced NOX5-S-mediated increase in cell proliferation is not known. We found that, in SEG1 EA cells, the acid-induced increase in prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production was mediated by activation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) but not by COX1. Acid treatment increased intracellular Ca2+, and a blockade of intracellular Ca2+ increase inhibited the acid-induced increase in COX2 expression and PGE2 production. Knockdown of NOX5-S or NF-κB1 p50 by their small interfering RNA significantly inhibited acid-induced COX2 expression and PGE2 production in SEG1 cells. Acid treatment significantly decreased IκBα and increased luciferase activity when SEG1 cells were transfected with an NF-κB in vivo activation reporter plasmid, pNF-κB-Luc. In a novel Barrett’s cell line overexpressing NOX5-S, IκBα was significantly reduced, and luciferase activity increased when these Barrett’s cells were transfected with pNF-κB-Luc. Overexpression of NOX5-S in Barrett’s cells significantly increased H2O2 production, COX2 expression, PGE2 production, and thymidine incorporation. The increase in thymidine incorporation occurring in NOX5-S-overexpressing Barrett’s cells or induced by acid treatment in SEG1 EA cells was significantly decreased by COX2 inhibitors or small interfering RNA. We conclude that acid-induced COX2 expression and PGE2 production depend on an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ and sequential activation of NOX5-S and NF-κB in SEG1 cells. COX2-derived PGE2 production may contribute to NOX5-S-mediated cell proliferation in SEG1 cells.

The major risk factor for this lethal tumor is gastroesophageal reflux disease complicated by Barrett’s esophagus (BE) (3.Lagergren J. Bergstrom R. Lindgren A. Nyren O. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (2627) Google Scholar), where esophageal squamous epithelium damaged by acid reflux is replaced by a metaplastic, intestinal type epithelium. The prevalence of BE is about 1–2% in the general population (4.Ronkainen J. Aro P. Storskrubb T. Johansson S.E. Lind T. Bolling-Sternevald E. Vieth M. Stolte M. Talley N.J. Agreus L. Gastroenterology. 2005; 129: 1825-1831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). The specialized intestinal metaplasia of BE is associated with a 30–125-fold increased risk for the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma (5.Kim R. Weissfeld J.L. Reynolds J.C. Kuller L.H. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 1997; 6: 369-377PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Haggitt R.C. Hum. Pathol. 1994; 25: 982-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 7.Wild C.P. Hardie L.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 676-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms of the progression from metaplasia to adenocarcinoma are not fully understood. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) may be an important factor mediating acid reflux-induced damage. ROS may damage DNA, RNA, lipids, and proteins, leading to increased mutation and altered functions of enzymes and proteins (e.g. activation of oncogene products and/or inhibition of tumor suppressor proteins) (8.Ohshima H. Tatemichi M. Sawa T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 417: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 9.Farhadi A. Fields J. Banan A. Keshavarzian A. Am. J. Gastroenterol. 2002; 97: 22-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Low levels of ROS, seen in nonphagocytic cells, were thought to be by-products of aerobic metabolism. More recently, however, superoxide-generating homologues of phagocytic NADPH oxidase catalytic subunit gp91phox (NOX1, NOX3–NOX5, DUOX1, and DUOX2) and homologues of other subunits (p41phox or NOXO1, p51phox, or NOXA1) have been found in several cell types (10.Lambeth J.D.

Two types of NOX5 have been described: NOX5-S and NOX5-L (13.Vignais P.V. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 2002; 59: 1428-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). NOX5-L has EF-hand motifs at its NH2 terminus (14.Banfi B. Molnar G. Maturana A. Steger K. Hegedus B. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37594-37601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), whereas NOX5-S does not (15.Cheng G. Cao Z. Xu X. van Meir E.G. Lambeth J.D. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 269: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). NOX5-L has four isoforms: α, β, δ, and γ (14.Banfi B. Molnar G. Maturana A. Steger K. Hegedus B. Demaurex N. Krause K.H.

We have shown that NOX1 and NOX5-S are the major isoforms of NADPH oxidase expressed in SEG1 EA cells, with NOX5-S having a much stronger signal than NOX1, whereas NOX5-L is not detected in these cells. The expression of NOX5-S mRNA is significantly higher in these cells than in esophageal squamous epithelial cells. NOX5-S mRNA is also significantly higher in Barrett's tissues with high grade dysplasia than without dysplasia. We have also shown that acid-induced H2O2 production is mediated by the NADPH oxidase NOX5-S and that acid-induced NOX5-S expression depends on an increase in intracellular calcium and activation of cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in SEG1 EA cells. Overproduction of ROS, derived from up-regulation of NOX5-S, increases cell proliferation and decreases apoptosis, possibly contributing to progression from intestinal metaplasia (Barrett's esophagus) to dysplasia and to adenocarcinoma. COX2 (cyclooxygenase 2) may also play a role in the progression from BE to EA, since 1) COX2 overexpression has been demonstrated in both Barrett's metaplastic and adenocarcinoma cells (16.Shirvani V.N. Ouatu-Lascar R. Kaur B.S. Omary M.B. Triadafilopoulos G. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 487-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar); 2) COX2 expression increases significantly in ex vivo BE tissues pulsed with acid or bile salts, and this effect is attenuated by the selective COX2 inhibitor NS-398 (16.Shirvani V.N. Ouatu-Lascar R. Kaur B.S. Omary M.B. Triadafilopoulos G. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 487-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar); and 3) selective COX2 inhibitors significantly decrease the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma in a rat model of BE (17.Buttar N.S. Wang K.K. Leontovich O. Westcott J.Y. Pacifico R.J. Anderson M.A. Krishnadath K.K. Lutzke L.S. Burgart L.J. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 1101-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The mechanisms mediating COX2-mediated tumorigenesis, however, are not fully understood. COX2 has been reported to play an important role in development of colorectal cancer (18.Gupta R.A. Dubois R.N. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar), possibly by increasing cell migration and invasion (19.Tsujii M. Kawano S. DuBois R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3336-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar) and decreasing apoptosis (20.Tsujii M. DuBois R.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 493-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2140) Google Scholar, 21.Liu X.H. Yao S. Kirschenbaum A. Levine A.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4245-4249PubMed Google Scholar). In EA cells, selective COX2 inhibitors significantly decrease proliferation and increase apoptosis (22.Souza R.F. Shewmake K. Beer D.G. Cryer B. Spechler S.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5767-5772PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Zimmermann K.C. Sarbia M. Weber A.A. Borchard F. Gabbert H.E. Schror K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 198-204PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that COX2-derived prostaglandin E2 may contribute to esophageal tumorigenesis, possibly by promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. Whether acid-induced overexpression of NOX5-S increases cell proliferation through up-regulation of COX2 in Barrett’s esophageal adenocarcinoma cells, however, is not known. In the present study, we show that acid-induced COX2 expression depends on an increase in intracellular calcium and sequential activation of NADPH oxidase NOX5-S and NF-κB and that COX2 may contribute to a NOX5-S-mediated increase in cell proliferation in SEG1 cells. Cell Culture and Acid Treatment−Human Barrett’s adenocarcinoma cell lines SEG1 were derived from human esophageal Barrett’s adenocarcinomas (24.Hughes S.J. Nambu Y. Soldes O.S. Hamstra D. Rehemtulla A. Iannettoni M.D. Orringer M.B. Beer D.G. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5571-5578PubMed Google Scholar) and generously provided by Dr. David Beer. These cells are cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Human Barrett’s cell line was established and generously provided by Dr. S. J. Spechler and Dr. R. F. Souza. This cell line was derived from esophageal mucosal biopsies of patients with BE (intestinal metaplasia) and immortalized with telomerase as described previously (25.Morales C.P. Gandia K.G. Ramirez R.D. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Spechler S.J. Gut. 2003; 52: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in wells precoated with collagen IV (1 μg/cm2; BD Bioscience, Bedford, MA) and in Keratinocyte Medium-2 (Ca2+-free solution, Cambrex, Rockland, ME) supplemented with 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5% fetal bovine serum, 400 ng/ml hydrocortisone, 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 0.1 nm cholera toxin, 20 μg/ml adenine, 5 μg/ml insulin, 70 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract, and antibiotics. Fig. 1A shows Alcian blue staining-positive cells in cultured Barrett’s cell line, indicating that this cell line contains mucus-secreting cells (possibly Goblet cells). Mucin-2 and an intestine specific transcription factor CDX2 were also detectable (Fig. 1B), confirming that these cells are intestinal metaplastic cells. Both cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. For acid treatment, SEG1 cells were exposed to acidic DMEM (pH 4.0), acidic DMEM (calcium-free and 1 mm EGTA) (pH 4.0), acidic medium plus NS-398 (10–6 m), acidic medium plus valeryl salicylate (10–5 m), or normal DMEM (control) for 1 h, washed, and cultured in fresh medium (pH 7.2, without phenol red) for an additional 24 h. For the NS-398 and valeryl salicylate group, NS-398 or valeryl salicylate was added to the culture medium in this additional 24-h culture. Finally, the culture medium and cells are collected for measurements. Acidic DMEM (pH 4.0, 250 μl) was added to each well in a 12-well plate, and the final pH was about 4.9 after a 1-h incubation. NOX5-S-overexpressing Stable Barrett’s Cell Line−Barrett’s cells were transfected with NOX5-S plasmid or pCMV-Tag5A plasmid by using Lipofectamine 2000. From the second day after the transfection, NOX5-S or empty vector-transfected cells were selected with 200 μg/ml G418 for 4 weeks. These Barrett’s cells were cultured as described above. Mucosal Organ Culture−Endoscopic mucosal biopsies were obtained from patients with documented BE undergoing endoscopy for cancer surveillance. As clinically recommended, one biopsy was taken from each quadrant every 2 cm in the entire length of the Barrett’s esophagus. All mucosal samples were divided in half using an aseptic technique. One half was used for histology and examined by a pathologist; the other was placed immediately in ice-cold culture medium and transported to the laboratory. BE mucosa confirmed to be intestinal metaplasia by pathological examination were used for the studies. The experimental protocols were approved by the Human Research Institutional Review Committee at Rhode Island Hospital. Biopsies were cultured as described previously (16.Shirvani V.N. Ouatu-Lascar R. Kaur B.S. Omary M.B. Triadafilopoulos G. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 487-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 26.Trier J.S.

Chem. 2006; 281: 20368-20382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, BE mucosal biopsy specimens were randomly assigned to acid, acid plus calcium-free, or control groups. The biopsy specimens were placed on a sterilized stainless wire mesh (Flynn & Enslow, Inc., San Francisco, CA) within a Falcon center-well organ culture dish (BD Biosciences) so that culture medium (0.9 ml) just covered the surface of the biopsy. Organ culture dishes were then placed on racks in the Modular Incubator Chamber (Billups-Rothenberg, Inc., Del Mar, CA), perfused with 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide, and then cultured at 37 °C. Organ culture was performed in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 μg/ml insulin, CaCl2 (1.377 mm), glutamine (2 mm), glucose (3.66 mg/ml), 500 units/ml streptomycin, and 250 units/ml penicillin. The final concentration of calcium in the medium was 1.8 mm. BE mucosal biopsy tissues were first equilibrated in culture for 2 h and then exposed to acidic medium (pH 4.0), acidic medium without calcium plus 1 mm EGTA, or control medium (pH 7.2) for 1 h. After washing twice, BE mucosa biopsies were cultured in fresh medium without phenol red (pH 7.2) for an additional 24 h. Finally the culture medium was collected for measurement of H2O2, and the levels of H2O2 were normalized for protein content. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Transfection−24 h before transfection at 40–50% confluence, cells were trypsinized and diluted 1:5 with fresh medium without antibiotics (1–3 × 105 cells/ml) and transferred to 12-well plates (1 ml/well). Transfection of siRNAs was carried out with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Per well, 75 pmol of siRNA duplex of NOX5, COX2, NF-κB1 p50, or scrambled siRNA formulated into liposomes were applied; the final volume was 1.2 ml/well. After a 4-h transfection, the transfection medium was replaced with regular medium. 12 h (NOX5 siRNA) or 48 h (p50 siRNA) later, cells were exposed to acidic medium (pH 4, 1 h), washed, and cultured in fresh medium (pH 7.2, without phenol red) for an additional 24 h. For COX2 siRNA, cells were cultured without acid treatment for 48 h after transfection. Finally, the culture medium and cells were collected for measurements. Transfection efficiencies were determined by fluorescence microscopy after transfection of Block-it fluorescent oligonucleotide (Invitrogen) and were about 90% at 48 h. Reverse Transcription-PCR−Total RNA was extracted by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) for the cultured cells and extracted by the RNAqueous kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) for the biopsy tissues according to the protocols of the manufacturers. 1.5 μg of total RNAs from cultured cells or 0.5 μg of total RNA from tissues was reversely transcribed by using a SUPERSCRIPT™ kit first strand synthesis system for reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen) or a Sensiscript RT kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), respectively. Luciferase Assay−24 h before transfection, NOX5-S-overexpressing Barrett’s cells, control Barrett’s cells transfected with pCMV-Tag5A, or SEG1 cells were seeded in 24-well plates. Each well of cells was transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and 0.2 μg of either pGL3-Basic (as no promoter control) or an NF-κB in vivo activation reporter plasmid pNF-κB-Luc, which contains five repeats of NF-κB binding element GGGGACTTTCC in the enhancer element of the plasmid. For acid treatment, SEG1 cells were treated with acidic medium (pH 4, 1 h) 12 h after transfection and then cultured for an additional 24 h. Luciferase activity was assayed 24 h (Barrett's cells) or 36 h (SEG1 cells) after transfection. Cell extracts were prepared by lysing the cells with lysis buffer (Roche Applied Science). The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min to pellet the cell debris. The protein concentration in the supernatants was determined. The luciferase activities in the cell lysates were measured using Luciferase assay substrate (Roche Applied Science) and normalized to protein content. Quantitative Real Time PCR−Quantitative real time PCR was carried out on a Stratagene Mx4000® multiplex quantitative PCR system. The primers used were: COX2 sense (5′-CCTGCCCTTCTGGTAGAAA-3′), COX2 antisense (5′-GGACAGCCCTTCACGTTATT-3′), NOX5 sense (5′-AAGACTCCATCACGGGGCTGCA-3′), NOX5 antisense (5′-CCTTCAGCACCTTGGCCAGA-3′), GAPDH sense (5′-CATGACCACAGTCCATG CCATCAC-3′), and GAPDH antisense (5′-AGGTCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′). All reactions were performed in triplicate in a 25-μl total volume containing a 1× concentration of Brilliant® SYBR® Green QPCR Master Mix (Stratagene), a 100 nm concentration of each sense and antisense primer, 1 μl of cDNA, and 30 nm reference dye. Reactions were carried out in a Stratagene Mx4000® multiplex quantitative PCR system for one cycle at 94 °C for 5 min; 40 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 59 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s; one cycle at 94 °C for 1 min; and one cycle at 55 °C for 30 s. Fluorescence values of SYBR Green I dye, representing the amount of product amplified at that point in the reaction, were recorded in real time at both the annealing step and the extension step of each cycle. The Ct, defined as the point at which the fluorescence signal was statistically significant above background, was calculated for each amplicon in each experimental sample using Stratagene Mx4000 software. This value was then used to determine the relative amount of amplification in each sample by interpolating from the standard curve. The transcript level of each specific gene was normalized to GAPDH amplification. Western Blot Analysis−Cells was lysed in Triton X lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 40 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 40 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. The suspension was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min, and the protein concentration in the supernatant was determined. Western blot was done as described previously (28.Cao W. Sohn U.D. Bitar K.N. Behar J. Biancani P. Harnett K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: G86-G95Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, after these supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE, the separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane at 30 V overnight. The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk and then incubated with appropriate primary antibodies followed by a 60-min incubation in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Detection was achieved with an enhanced chemiluminescence agent (Amersham Biosciences). Primary antibodies used were mucin-2 antibody (1:1000), CDX2 antibody (1:1000), human COX1 antibody (1:1000), COX2 antibody (1:1000), actin antibody (1:1000), IκBα antibody (1:200), NF-κB1 p50 antibody, and GAPDH antibody (1:2000). NOX5 antibody prepared against a mixture of unique NOX5 peptides (NH2-YESFKASDPLGRGSKRC-COOH and NH2-YRHQKRKHTCPS-COOH) was generously provided by Dr. David Lambeth (29.Brar S.S. Corbin Z. Kennedy T.P. Hemendinger R. Thornton L. Bommarius B. Arnold R.S. Whorton A.R. Sturrock A.B. Huecksteadt T.P. Quinn M.T. Krenitsky K. Ardie K.G. Lambeth J.D. Hoidal J.R. Am. J.

Cytosolic Calcium Measurements−SEG1 cells were loaded with 1.25 μm Fura-2/AM for 40 min and placed in a 5-ml chamber mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss). The cells were allowed to settle onto a coverslip at the bottom of the chamber. The bathing solution is the HEPES-buffered solution (pH 7.4) containing 112.5 mm NaCl, 3.1 mm KCl, 2.0 mm KH2PO4, 10.8 mm glucose, 24.0 mm HEPES (sodium salt), 1.9 mm CaCl2, 0.6 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mg/ml basal medium Eagle amino acid supplement, and 0.08 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. The Ca2+-free medium is the HEPES-buffered solution without CaCl2 but with 200 μm 1,2-bis(2-aminophenox)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), which completely blocked KCl-induced Ca2+ influx (30.Cao W. Vrees M.D. Kirber M.T. Fiocchi C. Pricolo V.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: G833-G843Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). When the Ca2+-free medium was used, the bathing solution was changed twice with Ca2+-free medium after the cells had settled to the bottom of the chamber. When thapsigargin or cyclopiazonic acid was used, cells were preincubated with thapsigargin (3 μm) or cyclopiazonic acid (1 μm) for 1 h and then utilized for acid treatment. Ca2+ measurements were obtained using a modified dual excitation wavelength imaging system (Ion-Optix Corp. Milton, MA) as described previously (31.Cao W. Chen Q. Sohn U.D. Kim N. Kirber M.T. Harnett K.M. Behar J. Biancani P. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C980-C992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ratiometric images were masked in the region outside the borders of the cell, since low photon counts give unreliable ratios near the edges. We developed a method for generating an adaptive mask that follows the borders of the cell as Ca2+ changes. A pseudoisosbestic image (i.e. an image insensitive to Ca2+ changes) was formed in computer memory from a weighted sum of the images generated by 340-nm excitation and 380-nm excitation. This image was then thresholded (i.e. values below a selected level were considered to be outside the cell and assigned a value of 0). For each ratiometric image, the outline of the cell was determined, and the generated mask was applied to the ratiometric image. This method allows the imaging of the changes in Ca2+. Our algorithm has been incorporated into the IonOptix software. This algorithm calculates the conversion of the ratios of fluorescence elicited by 340-nm excitation to 380-nm excitation to Ca2+ concentrations using techniques previously described in detail by Grynkiewicz et al. (32.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). [3H]Thymidine Incorporation−Barrett’s cells without (control) or with NOX5-S overexpression were cultured in the presence or absence of NS-398, valeryl salicylate, or CAY10404 for 48 h. For the experiments using COX2 siRNA, cells were cultured for 48 h following transfection with COX2 siRNA. After a part of the culture medium was collected for PGE2 measurement, cells were incubated with methyl-[3H]thymidine (0.05 μCi/ml) for 4 h. For acid treatment, SEG1 cells were cultured as described above and treated with acidic medium (pH 4.0) for 1 h at the confluence of 40–50%. Having been washed three times, cells were cultured at pH 7.2 for 24 h in the presence or absence of NS-398 or valeryl salicylate. A part of culture medium was collected for PGE2 measurement, and then cells were incubated with methyl-[3H]thymidine (0.05 μCi/ml) for 4 h. After cells were washed three times with PBS to remove unincorporated radioactivity, cells were collected and homogenized with a lysis buffer containing (pH 7.4): 50 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Methyl-[3H]thymidine uptake was measured in a scintillation counter, and the level of protein in the homogenates was also determined. The level of methyl-[3H]thymidine incorporation was normalized to protein content. PGE2 Measurement−PGE2 in culture medium was quantified by using a PGE2 enzyme immunoassay kit (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI). Amplex® Red Hydrogen Peroxide Fluorescent Assay−Levels of H2O2 in culture medium were measured by using the Amplex® Red H2O2 assay kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). This assay uses the Amplex Red reagent (10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine) to detect H2O2. In the presence of peroxidase, the Amplex Red reagent reacts with H2O2 in a 1:1 stoichiometry to produce the red fluorescent oxidation product, resorufin. Fluorescence is then measured with a fluorescence microplate reader using excitation at 540 nm and emission detection at 590 nm. Protein Measurement−The amount of protein was determined by colorimetric analysis (Bio-Rad) according to the method of Bradford (33.Bradford M.M. Ann. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Materials−Fura-2/AM and BAPTA were purchased from Molecular Probes, [3H]thymidine was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and human NOX5 siRNA was from Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX). The PGE2 enzyme immunoassay kit, COX1 antibody, COX2 antibody, NS-398, valeryl salicylate, and CAY10404 were from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI), and actin antibody was from Lab Vision Corp. (Fremont, CA). Thapsigargin, cyclopiazonic acid, and mucin-2 antibody were bought from EMD Chemicals, Inc. (San Diego, CA); CDX2 antibody was from CeMines (Golden, CO); NF-κB1 p50 siRNA, COX2 siRNA, p50 antibody, and IκBα antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); and GAPDH antibody was from Ambion Inc. Hydrocortisone, epidermal growth factor, cholera toxin, adenine, insulin, bovine pituitary extract, Triton X-100, Nonidet P-40, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, dl-dithiothreitol, basal medium Eagle amino acid supplement, HEPES sodium, and other reagents were purchased from Sigma. pNF-κB-Luc was bought from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Statistical Analysis−Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical differences between two groups were determined by Student’s t test. Differences between multiple groups were tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and checked for significance using Fisher’s protected least significant difference test. Role of NOX5-S in Acid-induced COX2 Expression and PGE2 Production−In SEG1 esophageal adenocarcinoma cells, acid treatment significantly increased COX2 (Fig. 2, A and B) but not COX1 expression (Fig. 2, C and D). In addition, acid treatment significantly increased PGE2 production. This PGE2 increase was inhibited by the COX2 inhibitor NS-398 but not by the COX1 inhibitor valeryl salicylate (Fig. 2F). The data suggest that acid-induced PGE2 production is mediated by activation of COX2 but not by COX1. We have previously shown that NOX5 siRNA effectively knock down NOX5 protein in SEG1 cells (27.Fu X. Beer D.G. Behar J. Wands J. Lambeth D. Cao W. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2043703144,"ADAMTS9 is a secreted, cell-surface-binding metalloprotease that cleaves the proteoglycans versican and aggrecan. Unlike most precursor proteins, the ADAMTS9 zymogen (pro-ADAMTS9) is resistant to intracellular processing. Instead, pro-ADAMTS9 is processed by furin at the cell surface. Here, we investigated the role of the ADAMTS9 propeptide in regulating its secretion and proteolytic activity. Removal of the propeptide abrogated secretion of the ADAMTS9 catalytic domain, and secretion was inefficiently restored by expression of the propeptide in trans. Substitution of Ala for Asn residues within each of three consensus N-linked glycosylation sites in the propeptide abrogated ADAMTS9 secretion. Thus, the propeptide is an intramolecular chaperone whose glycosylation is critical for secretion of the mature enzyme. In addition to two previously identified furin-processing sites (Arg74↓ and Arg287↓) the ADAMTS9 propeptide was also furin-processed at Arg209. Substitution of Ala for Arg74, Arg209, and Arg287 resulted in secretion of an unprocessed zymogen. Unexpectedly, versican incubated with cells expressing this pro-ADAMTS9 was processed to a greater extent than when incubated with cells expressing wild-type, furin-processable ADAMTS9. Moreover, cells and medium treated with the proprotein convertase inhibitor decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethyl ketone had greater versican-cleaving activity than untreated cells. Following furin processing of pro-ADAMTS9, propeptide fragments maintained a non-covalent association with the catalytic domain. Collectively, these observations suggest that, unlike other metalloproteases, furin processing of the ADAMTS9 propeptide reduces its catalytic activity. Thus, the propeptide is a key functional domain of ADAMTS9, mediating an unusual regulatory mechanism that may have evolved to ensure maximal activity of this protease at the cell surface.

Genomics. 2000; 67: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In previously published work, we showed that when expressed in COS-1 or HEK293F cells, ADAMTS9 is located at the cell surface or within the pericellular matrix (8.Somerville R.P. Longpre J.M. Jungers K.A. Engle J.M. Ross M. Evanko S. Wight T.N. Leduc R. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9503-9513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), suggesting that, despite the lack of a membrane anchor, it could be considered as an operational cell-surface protease. ADAMTS9 can cleave the large aggregating proteoglycans aggrecan and versican (8.Somerville R.P. Longpre J.M. Jungers K.A. Engle J.M. Ross M. Evanko S. Wight T.N. Leduc R. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9503-9513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), suggesting a role in turnover of extracellular matrix. Thus, like its Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog, Gon-1, which is required for cell migration during gonadal morphogenesis (10.Blelloch R. Kimble J. Nature. 1999; 399: 586-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), it is possible that ADAMTS9 participates in extracellular proteolysis of matrix or cell-surface molecules.The ADAMTS9 protease domain contains an N-terminal propeptide, which, as in most zymogens, is believed to maintain enzyme latency and to be proteolytically excised to permit catalytic activity, a process termed “activation.” The ADAMTS9 propeptide contains a number of predicted furin-processing sites, and as in many metalloproteases, propeptide excision is mediated by proprotein convertases (PCs) such as furin. We previously made the unexpected observation that pro-ADAMTS9 was resistant to processing by furin within the secretory pathway but was processed by furin at the cell surface (11.Koo B.H. Longpre J.M. Somerville R.P. Alexander J.P. Leduc R. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12485-12494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although a C-terminally truncated zymogen containing only the propeptide and catalytic domain of pro-ADAMTS9 (ProCat) was readily detectable at the cell surface, the furin-processed propeptide and catalytic domain fragments of the zymogen were never found at the cell surface, but instead, were readily detected in the medium. This suggested that the contiguous propeptide and catalytic domain were essential for cell-surface binding and that furin processing either disrupted a cell-binding site or led to a conformational change that resulted in loss of cell-surface binding. Thus, the ADAMTS9 propeptide can potentially contribute both to regulation of ADAMTS9 activity and to its localization. In the present work, we continued our investigation into the role of the propeptide in regulating the secretion and activity of ADAMTS9. The results provide further insights on ADAMTS9 propeptide cleavage by proprotein convertases and demonstrate an unexpected role for the ADAMTS9 propeptide in regulation of enzyme activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESADAMTS9 Expression Plasmids and Site-directed Mutagenesis−Plasmids for the expression of full-length ADAMTS9, or only the signal peptide, propeptide and catalytic domain (Pro-Cat) with C-terminal Myc and His tags were previously described (8.Somerville R.P. Longpre J.M. Jungers K.A. Engle J.M. Ross M. Evanko S. Wight T.N. Leduc R. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9503-9513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 11.Koo B.H. Longpre J.M. Somerville R.P. Alexander J.P. Leduc R. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12485-12494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). New constructs made for the present studies are shown, as appropriate, in Figs. 1, 2, 3. To make an expression plasmid encoding only the propeptide, site-directed mutagenesis was used to convert the P1 Arg of the major furin cleavage site to a stop codon (Arg287 Stop) using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). cDNA encoding the catalytic domain without the prepro-peptide (Phe288 to Ser501) was amplified using Pro-Cat as a template with primers 5′-TCGATTTTTTATCCTATCCACGGTTTGTAGAAGTCTTG-3′ (with the ClaI site underlined) and 5′-GGATCCTCAGGATTCAGGTTCGTTAAGCAAAC-3′ (BamHI site underlined and introduced stop codon italicized) and cloned into pFLAG-CMV-1™ (Sigma) for expression with a preprotrypsin leader sequence and N-terminal FLAG tag. A plasmid for expression of ADAMTS9 from the N terminus to the linker 2 peptide (residues 1–1326), named ADAMTS9(N-L2), was generated by PCR and cloned into pcDNA3.1(–)/Myc-his A (Invitrogen) for expression with a C-terminal Myc and His6 tag. Two additional constructs were made for expression of mature ADAMTS9 catalytic domain and mature, nearly full-length ADAMTS9 (ADAMTS9(Cat-L2)) with the endogenous signal peptide, but without the propeptide, by subjecting Pro-Cat and ADAMTS9(N-L2) cDNAs to consecutive rounds of site-directed mutagenesis. In the first round of mutagenesis, an NheI site was inserted between the propeptide and catalytic domain of each plasmid. In the second mutagenesis step, an NheI site was inserted between the signal peptide and propeptide of each plasmid. NheI was used to excise the propeptide lying between these two sites, and the plasmid ends were ligated to obtain constructs that could express the respective polypeptides lacking the propeptide. N-Glycosylation sites within the propeptide of Pro-Cat were substituted with Ala (Asn112 → Ala, Asn135 → Ala, Asn271 → Ala, and Asn112,135,271 → Ala). A putative PC processing site (Arg209) was converted to Ala by site-directed mutagenesis. Full-length ADAMTS9 that was maturation-deficient (ADAMTS9 Arg74 + 209 + 287 → Ala) and the active site mutant Glu435 → Ala were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the full-length ADAMTS9 expression plasmid as above. All these mutant plasmids were sequence-verified.FIGURE 2The ADAMTS9 propeptide is essential for secretion of the catalytic domain. A, secretable FLAG-tagged catalytic domain or the ADAMTS9 propeptide were expressed individually or together in HEK293F cells using plasmids expressing the constructs shown at the top. Immunoblotting of cell lysate (Cell) and conditioned medium (CM) was done using anti-FLAG (left-hand panel) or anti-RP4 (right-hand panel). Note that the propeptide (P) expressed in isolation is secreted into the CM (right-hand panel), but the catalytic domain (C) is not (left-hand panel). Secretion of the catalytic domain is not rescued by co-expression of the propeptide. Molecular mass markers are shown to the right of each panel. B, expression of C-terminal Myc-tagged Cat (Cat-Myc) or ADAMTS9(Cat-L2) and their co-expression with the propeptide in HEK293F cells. Immunoblotting of cell lysate and conditioned medium (CM) was done using anti-Myc. ADAMTS9(Cat-L2) and catalytic domain (C) are indicated. The Cat-L2 construct was used in preference to full-length ADAMTS9, because it is more resistant to C-terminal proteolysis and thus more readily detected in the medium of transfected cells. Note a weakly reactive catalytic domain band in acetone-precipitated conditioned medium following co-expression of propeptide but no secretion of ADAMTS9 (Cat-L2). The 35- and 48-kDa bands are seen in all lanes and are nonspecific.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3N-Linked glycosylation is essential for Pro-Cat secretion.

Transient transfections with various plasmids were done using FuGENE 6 as per the manufacturer’s recommendations (Roche Applied Science). For protein analysis, transfected HEK293F or QBI293A cells were cultured to confluence in 6-well plates and changed to 293 SFM-II medium (Invitrogen) for analysis of secreted protein.Antibodies, Western Blotting, and Immunoprecipitation−The RP4 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) to the ADAMTS9 propeptide was characterized previously and detects an undisclosed peptide epitope (11.Koo B.H.

Anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (Invitrogen) and anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) were obtained from commercial sources. Western blotting was done following reducing or non-reducing SDS-PAGE, using appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences-GE Biosciences Healthcare Corp., Piscataway, NJ) for detection. Conditioned medium of stably transfected HEK293F cells was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc-agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) or with anti-FLAG-agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) as a control followed by reducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-RP4 antibody or anti-Myc antibody. For analysis of N-glycosylation mutants, QBI-293A cells were transiently transfected with wild-type Pro-Cat or the various mutants, metabolically labeled with [35S]Met/Cys mixture for 3 h, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc, reducing SDS-PAGE and fluorography, all as previously described (11.Koo B.H.

The dialyzed medium was incubated with the thiol-non-cleavable amine-reactive cross-linker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (Pierce, final concentration 2 mm according to the manufacturer’s recommendation) for 30 min on ice. The functional groups in this cross-linker are spaced 11.4 Å apart. After blocking unused free functional groups with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH7.5) for 5 min, aliquots of the conditioned medium were analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with appropriate antibodies. Cell surface biotinylation of cells was done on ice as previously described (11.Koo B.H. Longpre J.M. Somerville R.P. Alexander J.P. Leduc R. Apte S.S. J. Biol.

HEK293F cells were transfected with full-length ADAMTS9, ADAMTS9 Glu435 → Ala, or ADAMTS9 Arg74,209,287 → Ala expression vectors and cultured to confluence in 6-well plates, and 1 ml of conditioned medium from the skin fibroblasts was added to the transfected cells. Following 24-h incubation, 100 μl of the medium was digested with chondroitinase ABC (Sigma), precipitated with acetone, and analyzed by Western blotting using Versican V0/V1 neo-epitope antibody (anti-DPEAAE, also referred to as JSCDPE, Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO) as previously described (8.Somerville R.P. Longpre J.M. Jungers K.A. Engle J.M. Ross M. Evanko S. Wight T.N. Leduc R. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9503-9513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The same approach was used to analyze versican processing by HEK293F cells transfected with full-length ADAMTS9 but in the presence of 50 μm dec-RVKR-cmk (Calbiochem) to prevent pro-ADAMTS9 processing.A variation of this assay using conditioned medium was also developed. HEK293F cells were transfected with full-length ADAMTS9, ADAMTS9 Glu435 → Ala, or ADAMTS9 Arg74,209,287 → Ala expression vectors, and cultured to confluence in 6-well plates. The cells were changed to 293 SFM-II medium (Invitrogen) and incubated in the presence or absence of 50 μm dec-RVKR-cmk for a further 24 h. The conditioned medium was collected and incubated with versican-rich medium from Marfan skin fibroblasts at a 1:1 ratio at 37 °C for 24 h. The incubated medium was analyzed for versican proteolysis using Western blot analysis as described above. The ADAMTS9 in conditioned medium was evaluated by Western blotting using anti-RP4.RESULTSADAMTS9 Catalytic Domain Lacking the Propeptide Is Not Secreted from Cells−We previously showed that both full-length ADAMTS9 and Pro-Cat (Fig. 1A) were efficiently processed by furin at the surface of HEK293F cells. In the case of Pro-Cat, a 29-kDa unglycosylated catalytic domain (reactive with anti-Myc) and 37-, ∼22-, and ∼20-kDa propeptide fragments (reactive with anti-RP4) were readily detectable in the conditioned medium without concentrating it (Fig. 1B). We previously showed that little or no intact zymogen was secreted into conditioned medium of HEK293F cells (e.g. Fig. 1B), and moreover, no processed fragments were present at the surface of these cells, indicating their immediate release upon furin processing (11.Koo B.H. Longpre J.M. Somerville R.P. Alexander J.P. Leduc R. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12485-12494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because furin-processed full-length ADAMTS9 is difficult to detect in conditioned medium because of its large size and C-terminal processing, which removes the Myc tag, we studied the biosynthetic profile of a shorter form of the precursor, ADAMTS9(N-L2) (Fig. 1A). This precursor was detected in transfected HEK293F cells as a single 125-kDa species reactive with both anti-Myc and anti-RP4 (Fig. 1C), whereas the furin-processed Cat-L2 (∼100 kDa) and the 37-, 22-, and 20-kDa propeptide fragments were seen in conditioned medium using anti-Myc and anti-RP4, respectively (Fig. 1C). To examine the role of the propeptide in regulating secretion, a construct for expression of the catalytic domain alone with a preprotrypsin signal peptide and N-terminal FLAG tag, was generated (Fig. 2A). The FLAG-tagged catalytic domain was not secreted into the conditioned medium of HEK293F cells, although it was present in the cell lysate (Fig. 2A, left-hand panel). However, the propeptide alone (ADAMTS91–286) was efficiently secreted into the conditioned medium, and underwent furin processing to generate fragments similar to those previously seen upon ProCat expression (Fig. 2A, right-hand panel). Co-transfection of the propeptide with the FLAG-tagged catalytic domain failed to rescue its secretion (Fig. 2A, left-hand panel). These experiments suggested that the propeptide was essential for secretion of ADAMTS9 but that it was unable to rescue secretion of the mature enzyme when provided in trans. To exclude potential interference of the N-terminal FLAG tag in secretion, as well as to investigate whether a longer form of ADAMTS9 could be secreted without the propeptide, we repeated these experiments using additional constructs that in addition to lacking the N-terminal FLAG-tag, utilized the endogenous signal peptide of ADAMTS9 (Fig. 2B). Both ADAMTS9(Cat) and ADAMTS9(Cat-L2) were detectable within the cell lysate (Fig. 2B). Co-expression of the isolated propeptide diminished the levels of each construct within the cell lysate (Fig. 2B) but could not restore their secretion to the robust levels seen in conditioned medium upon expression of the Pro-Cat or ADAMTS9(N-L2) constructs (Fig. 1, B and C). For example, the catalytic domain derived from Pro-Cat is robustly detected upon Western blot analysis of 20 μl of unconcentrated conditioned medium from transfected cells, requiring only a few seconds of exposure to ECL reagent (e.g. Fig. 1B). However, the Myc-tagged isolated catalytic domain co-expressed with propeptide was only detectable following acetone precipitation of 500 μl of medium and long exposure (5 min) of the immunoblot to ECL reagent (Fig. 2B). The Cat-L2 construct was undetectable in the medium following co-expression with the propeptide (Fig. 2B). Collectively, these experiments establish: (i) that the propeptide is essential for secretion of ADAMTS9 and (ii) that the propeptide inefficiently restores secretion of the mature enzyme when provided in trans, demonstrating that it can function as a weak chaperone in trans, but that, for such function to be optimal, it is required in cis.N-Linked Oligosaccharide in the Propeptide Is Essential for Secretion−Treatment of ADAMTS9 Pro-Cat with peptide N-glycosidase F previously demonstrated that the propeptide, but not the catalytic domain, was N-glycosylated, as predicted by the primary sequence (11.Koo B.H. Longpre J.M. Somerville R.P. Alexander J.P. Leduc R. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12485-12494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because N-linked oligosaccharides are predicted to be attached to Asn112, Asn135, and Asn271 (these residues are located within the consensus motif Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr, where Xaa is any residue except proline (14.Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar)) and may be involved in regulating correct folding of secreted proteins (15.Helenius A. Aebi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar), we mutated these residues individually and in combination by substituting Asn with Ala in Pro-Cat. Pro-Cat is present in transfected QBI-293A cells as a major glycosylated molecular species of 60 kDa and a 50-kDa unglycosylated species (8.Somerville R.P. Longpre J.M. Jungers K.A. Engle J.M. Ross M. Evanko S. Wight T.N. Leduc R. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9503-9513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, upper panel). Protein expressed from each of the single Asn mutant Pro-Cat plasmids was detected in the respective transfected cell lysate but migrated more rapidly than the fully glycosylated Pro-Cat, suggestive of a lack of glycosylation at that site (Fig. 3, upper panel). Pro-Cat in which all three putative sites were mutated showed a major band, which migrated at the level of the unglycosylated Pro-Cat (Fig. 3, upper panel). Together, these observations demonstrated that the secreted ADAMTS9 propeptide is constitutively glycosylated at Asn112, Asn135, and Asn271 as suggested by previous analysis (11.Koo B.H. Longpre J.M. Somerville R.P. Alexander J.P. Leduc R. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12485-12494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although the 29-kDa furin-processed catalytic domain fragment was present in conditioned medium of wild-type Pro-Cat-transfected cells, the catalytic domain derived from N-glycosylation-defective proteins was not found in the media of transfected cells (Fig. 3, lower panel). This suggests that N-linked glycosylation at each site within the propeptide is essential for secretion of ADAMTS9 zymogen and as a corollary, that secreted ADAMTS9 normally contains an oligosaccharide at each of these sites.Propeptide Remains Non-covalently Associated with the Catalytic Domain after Furin Processing−Previous studies using reducing SDS-PAGE of conditioned medium from ADAMTS9-transfected cells demonstrated that the propeptide was secreted into conditioned medium following proteolysis of the zymogen at the cell surface (11.Koo B.H. Longpre J.M. Somerville R.P. Alexander J.P. Leduc R. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12485-12494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the propeptide interacted with the catalytic domain after processing or was secreted as a discrete entity, the conditioned medium of cells stably expressing Pro-Cat was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc-agarose and immunoblotted with anti-RP4. Fig. 4A shows that the propeptide fragments and catalytic domain were bound to each other in the conditioned medium. Furthermore, anti-Myc immunoprecipitated not just the intact 37-kDa propeptide fragment, but also the smaller 20- to 22-kDa fragments derived from it (Fig. 4A). As a control for these experiments, immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG agarose, which does not recognize this construct, did not provide any anti-RP4 immunoreactivity (Fig. 4A). We noted that the propeptide was not co-immunoprecipitated with the catalytic domain under conditions where detergents were used for washing the protein-A beads (e.g. Fig. 3). In the immunoprecipitation experiments shown in Fig. 4A, the beads were washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline, and no detergents were present. Furthermore, non-reducing SDS-PAGE analysis of the medium showed discrete propeptide and catalytic domain fragments as the major immunoreactive species, although low levels of a propeptide-catalytic domain complex were also detectable (Fig. 4B). This demonstrates that the complex between the propeptide and catalytic domain in the medium is not disulfidebonded. Taken together, this suggested that the binding of the propeptide to the catalytic domain is not only non-covalent but is also susceptible to dissociation in the presence of detergents such as SDS. Next, cross-linking of the secreted propeptide and catalytic domain was done at low concentrations of the target proteins (unconcentrated medium) using a cross-linker with a short arm (11.4 Å) between the functional groups. Fig. 4C shows that the propeptide and catalytic domain were efficiently cross-linked with very little residual isolated catalytic domain or propeptide. The molecular mass of the major"

However, a possible role of these kinases in the retrograde pathway from endosomes to the Golgi complex has previously not been investigated. We report here the involvement of a specific PKC isozyme, PKCδ, in the intracellular transport of the glycolipid-binding Shiga toxin (Stx), which utilizes the retrograde pathway to intoxicate cells. Upon binding to cells, Stx was shown to specifically activate PKCδ and not PKCα. The involvement of PKCδ and PKCα in the retrograde transport of Stx was then monitored biochemically and by immunofluorescence after inhibition or depletion of the isozymes. PKCδ, but not PKCα, was shown to selectively regulate the endosome-to-Golgi transport of StxB. Upon inhibition or knockdown of PKCδ, StxB molecules colocalized less with giantin and more with EEA1, indicating that the molecules were accumulated in endosomes, unable to reach the Golgi complex. The inhibition of Golgi transport of Stx was reflected by a strong reduction in the toxic effect, demonstrating that transport of Stx to the cytosol is dependent on PKCδ activity. These results are in agreement with our previous data, which show that Stx is able to stimulate its own transport.

Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1629-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To reach its intracellular target, the toxin has to be endocytosed and transported via early endosomes (EEs) to the Golgi complex. The toxin is then transported further to the endoplasmic reticulum from where the A-subunit is translocated to the cytosol (for reviews see Refs. 1.Sandvig K. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1629-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar and 2.Sandvig K. van Deurs B. Gene Ther. 2005; 12: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In the cytosol the protein synthesis is inhibited by enzymatic modification of the 28 S rRNA. Endocytosis of the toxin is mediated by a clathrin-dependent process in several cell types, although clathrin-independent mechanisms are also partly involved (2.Sandvig K. van Deurs B. Gene Ther. 2005; 12: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The toxin is transported to the EE, which is considered a sorting station for many endocytosed molecules. Some receptors are recycled to the plasma membrane to be recharged with ligands, like the transferrin receptor, whereas others enter the late endocytic pathway for degradation, like the epidermal growth factor receptor. Stx has been shown to utilize the retrograde pathway, which deviates from the recycling and degradative pathways in the EE and allows the toxin to be directly transported to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and then further to the Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum (3.Sandvig K. Garred O. Prydz K. Kozlov J.V. Hansen S.H. Van D.B. Nature. 1992; 358: 510-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). This pathway is also used for retrieval of endogenous proteins, like TGN46 and mannose 6-phosphate receptors (reviewed in Ref. 4.Bonifacino J.S. Rojas R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 568-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Several proteins have been shown to regulate the transport of StxB in this pathway (4.Bonifacino J.S. Rojas R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 568-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Recently, microtubuli and dynein were also shown to be involved in Stx trafficking, and interestingly, Stx seemed to be able to stimulate microtubule assembly (5.Hehnly H. Sheff D. Stamnes M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4379-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Importantly, the requirements for retrograde transport of various protein toxins such as Stx and ricin differ, suggesting that there is more than one route from EE to the TGN (6.Iversen T.-G. Skretting G. Llorente A. Nicoziani P. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2099-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 7.Wilcke M. Johannes L. Galli T. Mayau V. Goud B. Salamero J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1207-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Stx has been shown to induce signaling cascades leading to apoptosis in several cell types (reviewed in Ref. 8.Cherla R.P. Lee S.Y. Tesh V.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 228: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In some cells the induction of apoptosis is mediated by the ribotoxic stress induced by the A1-chain after entry into the cytosol, whereas in other cells both Stx and the Stx B-subunit have been shown to induce apoptosis independent of intracellular transport (8.Cherla R.P. Lee S.Y. Tesh V.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 228: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Several kinases are rapidly activated by Stx, such as the Src kinases Yes (9.Katagiri Y.U.

Slagsvold H.H. Torgersen M.L. Spilsberg B. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1096-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In human renal carcinoma-derived ACHN (human, Caucasian, kidney, adenocarcinoma) cells, Stx has been shown to induce phosphorylation of actin-binding proteins such as paxillin and ezrin and also to increase the levels of cortical actin and microtubuli (13.Takenouchi H. Kiyokawa N. Taguchi T. Matsui J. Katagiri Y.U. Okita H. Okuda K. Fujimoto J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3911-3922Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Importantly, we have shown that Stx is able to stimulate its own clathrin-mediated entry in a process dependent on toxin concentration (14.Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Brown J.E. Petersen O.W. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1331-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 15.Torgersen M.L. Lauvrak S.U. Sandvig K. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 4103-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and by induction of signaling cascades that leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of clathrin and activation of Syk (12.Lauvrak S.U. Walchli S. Iversen T.G. Slagsvold H.H. Torgersen M.L. Spilsberg B. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1096-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the monocytic cell line THP-1, Shiga-like toxin 1 was reported to activate protein kinase C (PKC) (16.Foster G.H. Armstrong C.S. Sakiri R. Tesh V.L. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5183-5189Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and the involvement of PKC in toxin traffic has previously been indicated by the demonstration of increased sensitivity to several toxins after stimulation of cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (17.Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Biochem. J. 1981; 194: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), including Stx. 3M. L. Torgersen, S. Wälchli, S. Grimmer, S. S. Skånland, and K. Sandvig, unpublished data. In this study we therefore wanted to investigate the role of PKC isozymes in Stx transport and whether Stx is able to activate these kinases to modulate its own transport. PKC isozymes are serine-threonine kinases that are implicated in diverse cellular functions, such as growth, differentiation, apoptosis, motility, ruffling, and vesicular trafficking (for reviews see Refs. 18.Liu W.S. Heckman C.A. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 529-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar and 19.Oliva J.L. Griner E.M. Kazanietz M.G. Growth Factors. 2005; 23: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The isozymes can be divided into subgroups based on structure and cofactor requirements. The classic PKC (cPKC) isozymes (α, βI, βII, and γ) are activated by Ca2+ and 1,2-diacylglycerol, the novel PKC (nPKC) isozymes (δ, ε, η, and θ) lack the Ca2+-binding domain, but are activated by 1,2-diacylglycerol, whereas the atypical PKC (aPKC) isozymes (ζ and λ/ι) are both Ca2+- and 1,2-diacylglycerol-independent but might be activated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (18.Liu W.S. Heckman C.A. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 529-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 19.Oliva J.L. Griner E.M. Kazanietz M.G. Growth Factors. 2005; 23: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Different PKC isozymes have been shown associated with several intracellular structures involved in vesicular trafficking such as caveolae, multiple endocytic compartments, the Golgi complex, and lysosomes. PKC activity has been shown to regulate endocytosis of an increasing number of ligands and to regulate different vesicular trafficking steps in the recycling or degradative pathways (reviewed in Ref. 20.Alvi F. Idkowiak-Baldys J. Baldys A. Raymond J.R. Hannun Y.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 64: 263-270Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, a role of PKC isozymes in the retrograde pathway has previously not been reported. Recently, both PKCα and PKCδ were shown to mediate correct trafficking of FcαR vesicles (21.Chen Y.W. Lang M.L. Wade W.F. Traffic. 2004; 5: 577-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and we therefore wanted to investigate whether PKCα-or-δ activity were implicated in targeting Stx into the retrograde pathway. First, the ability of StxB to rapidly activate these isozymes was determined, and we found that PKCδ was specifically activated by StxB binding but not PKCα. Then, PKCα and -δ were inhibited or depleted by the use of specific drugs or siRNA oligonucleotides, and the main Stx transport steps were monitored; the endocytosis, the endosome-to-Golgi transport, and the toxicity exerted in the cytosol. PKCδ was found to regulate the endosome-to-Golgi transport of Stx, whereas PKCα activity did not seem to be involved in any of the intracellular transport steps. Upon PKCδ inhibition or depletion the StxB en route to the Golgi accumulated in endocytic structures early in the transport pathway. The inhibition of endosome-to-Golgi transport of Stx was reflected by reduced toxicity of Stx. These results show that PKCδ is an important regulator of Stx trafficking and are in agreement with the idea that Stx is able to stimulate its own intracellular transport. Materials−Hepes, bovine serum albumin, MESNa (mercaptoethanesulfonic acid), n-octylglucopyranoside, and tetracycline were purchased from Sigma. Na 352SO4 and [3H]leucine were from Amersham Biosciences (Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK). Mouse anti-Stx antibodies (13C4 and 3C10) were from Toxin Technology (Sarasota, FL), rabbit anti-PKCδ antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and mouse anti-α-tubulin antibody and mouse anti-ricin antibody were from Sigma. Rottlerin, BIM, Gö6976 (Calbiochem) were resuspended in Me2SO, and frozen aliquots were stored at –20 °C. When used in experiments, the Me2SO concentration never exceeded 0.2%. Shiga toxin (Stx) was provided by Dr. J. V. Kozlov (Academy of Sciences of Russia, Moscow, Russia) and by Dr. J. E. Brown (U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Fort Detrick, MD). The plasmid encoding StxB-sulf2 was a kind gift from Dr. B. Goud (Institute Curie, Paris, France). The protein concentrations in the lysates were determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce) with the use of bovine serum albumin as the standard. Cells and Transfection−HeLa, HEp-2, and Vero cells were grown under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and l-glutamine at 2 mm. For sulfation experiments, the cells were seeded out in 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well and grown for 24 h before the experiments. For endocytosis and toxicity experiments the cells were seeded out in 24-well plates at a density of 4 × 104 cells/well and grown for 24 h before the experiments. Two different siRNAs targeting non-overlapping parts of the mRNA sequence were designed for PKCδ and one for PKCα. They were selected according to their physicochemical profiles, their specificity to the target mRNA by BLAST analysis profile (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/), and, finally, fitted as closely as possible to the criteria depicted previously (22.Reynolds A. Leake D. Boese Q. Scaringe S. Marshall W.S. Khvorova A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). The sequences for the PKCδ targeting constructs were GGCUACAAAUGCAGGCAAU and AACUCUUCGAGUCCAUCCGUGU (siRNA 1 and 2, respectively), and for the PKCα targeting construct UGUGACACCUGCGAUAUGA (named siRNA 2). The constructs were ordered high-performance liquid chromatography-purified from MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). We also used the PKCα-specific oligonucleotide AAAGGCUGAGGUUGCUGAU (23.Inoue R. Shiraishi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 330: 1314-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) named PKCα siRNA 1 in this report, the PKCδ-specific oligonucleotide CCAUGAGUUUAUCGCCACCUU (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), named PKCδ siRNA 3 in this report or a negative control (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). For siRNA transfection the cells were seeded out without antibiotics, grown for 24 h, and transfected using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s procedure. After 5 h of transfection, the medium was changed to complete growth medium containing serum and antibiotics, and the cells were grown for 2 or 3 days before the experiments, as indicated in the figure legends. Determination of Shiga Toxin and Ricin Cytotoxicity−Cytotoxicity of Shiga toxin and ricin was determined by the reduction of protein synthesis in toxin-treated cells. HeLa cells seeded out in 24-well plates were washed twice in leucine-free Hepes medium, then the cells were preincubated with the different PKC inhibitors in the same medium for 30 min, before increasing concentrations of the toxins were added. The incubation was continued for 1.5 h (Stx) or 2 h (ricin), then the medium was replaced with leucine-free Hepes medium containing 2 μCi/ml [3H]leucine, and the cells were incubated for a further 15 min. The proteins were extracted with 5% trichloroacetic acid, washed once in trichloroacetic acid, and then dissolved in 0.1 m KOH. The incorporation of radioactivity was finally quantified. Endocytosis Experiments−Measurements of internalization of 125I-labeled ricin and transferrin were performed essentially as described previously (24.Rodal S.K. Skretting G. Garred Ø. Vilhardt F. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 961-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). The endocytosis of Stx was quantified using a modified version of the procedure described previously (12.Lauvrak S.U. Walchli S. Iversen T.G. Slagsvold H.H. Torgersen M.L. Spilsberg B. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1096-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 15.Torgersen M.L. Lauvrak S.U. Sandvig K. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 4103-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which takes advantage of a special ruthenium label quantitated in a highly specialized electro-chemiluminescent detection instrument provided by BioVeris Corp. (Gaithersburg, MD). Briefly, Stx was biotinylated with the reducible EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL), and a monoclonal antibody against Stx (3C10, Toxin Technology, Sarasota, FL) was labeled with the special BV-TAG® label containing a Tris(bipyridine)-chelated ruthenium(II) atom (BioVeris Corp.). To measure the uptake of biotinylated Stx in cells treated with different PKC inhibitors, the cells were washed once in Hepes-buffered minimal essential medium and then preincubated with the inhibitors before biotin-labeled Stx (0.33 nm) was added. The incubation was continued at 37 °C for the indicated time periods, still in the presence of the inhibitors. Control cells were treated with Me2SO alone. To distinguish internalized toxin from total cell-associated toxin (bound plus internalized), the cells were washed (0.14 m NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.6), and one half of the plate was treated with 0.1 m MESNa in the same buffer for 30 min on ice to reduce the SS-linked biotin in cell surface-bound toxin. The other half was mock treated. The cells were washed in cold buffer (0.14 m NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0) and lysed (1% Triton, 60 mm n-octylglucopyranoside, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Hepes). The cell lysate was incubated with the BV-TAG®-labeled anti-Stx antibody (0.5 μg/ml), and simultaneously, to selectively quantify biotinylated Stx, the biotin-labeled Stx was captured by streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (0.1 mg/ml, Invitrogen) by gentle shaking for 1.5 h in assay diluent (0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline). The amount of streptavidin-captured Stx complexed to the BV-TAG®-labeled antibody was quantified by an M1R Analyzer (BioVeris Corp.). Counts from cells treated with MESNa represent the amount of internalized toxin, whereas counts from untreated cells represent the total amount of toxin associated with the cells (bound plus internalized). Endocytosis of Stx was reported as internalized toxin in percentage of total cell-associated toxin. Sulfation of StxB-sulf2 or Ricin-sulf1−Ricin-sulf1, a modified ricin A-chain containing a tyrosine sulfation site reconstituted with ricin B-chain, was produced, purified, and reconstituted as previously described (25.Rapak A. Falnes P.Ø. Olsnes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The StxB containing a tandem of sulfation sites in the C terminus (StxB-sulf2) was produced in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells as previously described (26.Su G.F. Brahmbhatt H.N. Wehland J. Rohde M. Timmis K.N. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 3345-3359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For sulfation experiments, HeLa, HEp-2, or Vero cells (2 × 105/well in 6-well plate) were washed twice in sulfate-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagles’ medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, before they were preincubated with 0.2 mCi/ml Na 352SO4 for 3 h in sulfate-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagles’ medium. For the inhibitor studies, the drugs were added for the last 30 min of this preincubation. Then StxB-sulf2 or ricin-sulf1 was added (2 μg/ml), and the incubation continued for 45 min (StxB) or 2 h (ricin), in the presence or absence of the inhibitors. To accumulate StxB in endosomes, the cells were starved in sulfate-free medium for 2 h, and then StxB-sulf2 was internalized at 19.5 °C for 1 h, before the cells were transferred to 37 °C and the incubation continued for 45 min. The cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed (0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 60 mm n-octylglucopyranoside, supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), pH 7.4), and scraped. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min), and StxB or ricin was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant with monoclonal antibodies prebound to protein-A/Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline/0.35% Triton X-100, before the adsorbed material was analyzed by 4–20% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Billerica, MA). The bands were detected by exposing the membrane to a PhosphorImager screen, and the signal intensities were quantified by using ImageQuaNT 5.0 software (Amersham Biosciences). To determine the level of protein sulfation in general in cells treated with the different inhibitors or transfected with siRNA, the amount of 35S-labeled proteins in the lysate was measured by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Only minor changes in the sulfation of proteins in general were observed under the different conditions.3 In addition, the amount of protein in each well of transfected cells was determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce) with the use of bovine serum albumin as the standard. Only minor changes in the level of proteins were observed.3 Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting−PKCδ detection was performed as follows. HeLa cells were starved for 4 h and treated with StxB (250 ng/ml) for the indicated time, before lysates were prepared (1% Triton X-100, 0.5 m Tris, 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, and 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate decahydrate, supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and a mixture of phosphatase inhibitors (Inhibitor Mixture 1, Sigma), pH 7.4). The lysates were sonicated for 10 s, and then the cleared supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation with mouse anti-PKCδ (BD Biosciences) precoated on protein-G beads overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitation was then washed twice in the lysis buffer, and the adsorbed material was analyzed by 4–20% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The phosphorylation state of PKCδ was determined by rabbit anti-phospho-PKCδ (Thr505, Cell Signaling Technology) and the enhanced signal chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce Biotechnology). The total level of PKCδ was monitored by rabbit anti-PKCδ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The phosphorylation state of PKCα was analyzed in parallel. A fraction of the whole cell lysate from the PKCδ experiment was analyzed by Western blot using antiphospho-PKCα (Ser-657, Millipore, Billerica, MA). Total PKCα was determined by mouse anti-PKCα (BD Biosciences). To determine the level of PKCδ or PKCα upon siRNA treatment, lysates were prepared and PKC content was analyzed by Western blotting. The level of PKCδ was detected by rabbit anti-PKCδ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). PKCα was detected by mouse anti-PKCα (BD Biosciences). The level of α-tubulin was detected by mouse anti-α-tubulin (Sigma) and was used as a loading control. Signal intensities of the bands were quantified using ImageQuaNT 5.0. Immunofluorescence−HeLa cells grown on coverslips were washed in Hepes medium and preincubated with or without rottlerin (2.5 μm) for 30 min, then StxB-sulf2 (2 μg/ml) was added and the incubation continued for 10 min. The cells were washed three times in warm Hepes medium, before incubation for a further 20 min at 37 °C in warm Hepes medium with or without rottlerin. The cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked in 5% fetal calf serum. Stx was stained by mouse anti-Stx antibodies (13C4, Toxin Technology, Sarasota, FL) followed by Cy2-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), and the cells were labeled with either rabbit anti-giantin antibodies (BabCO, Berkeley, CA) and Cy3-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), or human anti-EEA1 serum (a gift from Dr. Harald Stenmark, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Norway) and rhodamine-labeled donkey anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). The cells were mounted in Mowiol and analyzed in a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a Neo-Fluar 100 ×/1.45 oil immersion objective. Images were taken of thin single plane sections, and the signal intensities were quantified by using the histogram-function in the Zeiss LSM Image Browser software (Version 3). PKCδ Is Specifically Activated by StxB−We have recently shown that the tyrosine kinase Syk is activated by Stx and regulates toxin uptake (12.Lauvrak S.U. Walchli S. Iversen T.G. Slagsvold H.H. Torgersen M.L. Spilsberg B. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1096-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We therefore wanted to investigate whether other key regulators of intracellular transport are activated by Stx and have a role in toxin transport. PKC isozymes are involved in sorting and intracellular transport of several receptors, and recently both PKCα and δ activity were implicated in key transport steps. First, we wanted to study whether Stx binding would activate these specific PKC isozymes. Several PKC isozymes have been detected in HeLa cells, including α, βII, δ, ε, η, and ζ (27.Kermorgant S. Zicha D. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3721-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 28.Hermoso M. Olivero P. Torres R. Riveros A. Quest A.F. Stutzin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17681-17689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Thr505 located at the activation loop of PKCδ is known to increase the activity of this kinase (29.Steinberg S.F. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, upon addition of StxB, PKCδ was rapidly phosphorylated at Thr505. Quantification of the amount of phosphorylated PKCδ from three independent experiments revealed that there was an increase already after 10 min, and that the peak was observed at 20 min with an increase to ∼300% of unstimulated control cells. The phosphorylation was then reduced, but did not return to control levels after 60 min.3 Notably, there was a basal PKCδ phosphorylation even in unstimulated control cells (Fig. 1). The phosphorylation status of PKCα was determined in parallel. Autophosphorylation of Ser657 is a hallmark of PKCα activation (29.Steinberg S.F. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). However, no increase in PKCα phosphorylation was detected in the lysate (Fig. 1). From these data we conclude that PKCδ is specifically activated by StxB. HeLa Cells Are Protected against Stx Toxicity by the PKCδ Inhibitor Rottlerin−Knowing that Stx was able to activate PKCδ, we wanted to study whether this kinase had a role in intracellular transport of the toxin. First, the general toxicity of Stx, determined as inhibition of cellular protein synthesis, was measured in HeLa cells treated with different PKC inhibitors. Fig. 2A shows a typical toxicity experiment, and Fig. 2B illustrates the -fold protection against Stx obtained by pretreatment with the different inhibitors. Treatment with the general PKC inhibitor BIM, which inhibits both classic and novel PKC isozymes, gave a 2-fold protection against Stx, whereas treatment with rottlerin, which is specific for PKCδ, induced a 5-fold protection. In contrast, treatment with Gö6976, which selectively inhibits PKCα and -βI, gave no protection. Importantly, the protein synthesis was not significantly changed upon treatment with the inhibitors themselves, not even rottlerin, which has been reported to deplete the cellular ATP in certain cell types at higher concentrations (30.Tapia J.A. Jensen R.T. Garcia-Marin L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).3 Thus, the inhibitors were non-toxic to the cells during the short incubations here used, and the observed reduction in protein synthesis upon Stx treatment is caused by the toxin only. To verify the involvement of PKCδ in Stx toxicity, HeLa cells were specifically depleted for PKCδ by transfection with siRNA oligonucleotides complementary to PKCδ mRNA. Control cells were transfected with a nonspecific control siRNA and are in the rest of the report referred to as “control-transfected cells.” Both a typical toxicity experiment (Fig. 2C) and pooled data from three independent experiment"
https://openalex.org/W2030801119,"Beta-catenin/T-cell factor (Tcf) signaling is constitutively active in the majority of human colorectal cancers, and there are accompanying changes in Bcl-2 expression. Similarly, 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo(4,5-b)pyridine (PhIP)-induced colon tumors in the rat have increased beta-catenin and elevated Bcl-2. To examine the possible direct transcriptional regulation of rat Bcl-2 by beta-catenin/Tcf, we cloned and characterized the corresponding promoter region and found 70.1% similarity with its human counterpart, BCL2. Bcl-2 promoter activity was increased in response to LiCl and exogenous beta-catenin, including oncogenic mutants of beta-catenin found in PhIP-induced colon tumors. Protein/DNA arrays identified E2F1, but not beta-catenin/Tcf, as interacting most strongly with the rat Bcl-2 promoter. Exogenous E2F1 increased the promoter activity of rat Bcl-2, except in mutants lacking the E2F1 sites. As expected, beta-catenin induced its downstream target c-Myc, as well as E2F1 and Bcl-2, and this was blocked by siRNA to c-Myc or E2F1. These findings suggest an indirect pathway for Bcl-2 over-expression in PhIP-induced colon tumors involving beta-catenin, c-Myc and E2F1."

Following penetration of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) 3The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; BiFC, bimolecular fluorescence complementation; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; GC, GFP C terminus containing GFP amino acids 155-239; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GN, GFP N terminus containing GFP amino acids 1-154; IN, integrase; LTR, long terminal repeat; PIC, pre-integration complex; RT, reverse transcriptase; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MAGI, multinuclear activation of a galactosidase indicator; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MMT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; VSV-G, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein.3The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; BiFC, bimolecular fluorescence complementation; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; GC, GFP C terminus containing GFP amino acids 155-239; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GN, GFP N terminus containing GFP amino acids 1-154; IN, integrase; LTR, long terminal repeat; PIC, pre-integration complex; RT, reverse transcriptase; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MAGI, multinuclear activation of a galactosidase indicator; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MMT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; VSV-G, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein. into the host cell, reverse transcription of the viral RNA produces cDNA that is then integrated into the host chromosome (1Greene W.C. Peterlin B.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The integration of the viral cDNA is an essential early step in the HIV-1 life cycle. This reaction is catalyzed by the viral integrase (IN), a 32-kDa protein that is an integral part of the viral pre-integration complex (PIC) (2Bukrinsky M.I. Sharova N. McDonald T.L. Pushkarskaya T. Tarpley W.G. Stevenson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6125-6129Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The IN protein is encoded by the viral pol gene and is translated as part of a large Gag-Pol polyprotein that is processed by the viral protease (3Chiu T.K. Davies D.R. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2004; 4: 965-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 4Pommier Y. Johnson A.A. Marchand C. Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2005; 4: 236-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). For the integration process to occur, the viral IN must recognize specific sequences in the viral cDNA, at the termini of the long terminal repeat (LTR) elements. Retroviral integration proceeds in two steps: in the first, termed 3′-end processing, a dinucleotide is removed from the 3′-end. This reaction occurs in the cytoplasm, within the PIC (5Farnet C.M. Haseltine W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4164-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 6Van Maele B. Debyser Z. AIDS Rev. 2005; 7: 26-43PubMed Google Scholar). In the next step, after entering the nucleus, the processed viral double-stranded DNA is joined to the host target DNA by an IN-mediated strand-transfer reaction. Due to its central role in HIV replication, the IN protein is an attractive target for antiviral therapy (4Pommier Y. Johnson A.A. Marchand C. Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2005; 4: 236-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Identifying specific IN inhibitors may provide a novel approach for multi-therapy strategies. Moreover, probably no cellular counterpart of IN exists in human cells and therefore, IN inhibitors should not interfere with normal cellular processes. However, only a few IN inhibitors have been described to date (4Pommier Y. Johnson A.A. Marchand C. Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2005; 4: 236-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the number of inhibitors obtained against reverse transcriptase (RT) and the protease, which are the other HIV-1 enzymes that are currently used as targets for the development of anti-HIV-1 drugs (4Pommier Y. Johnson A.A. Marchand C. Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2005; 4: 236-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). A promising approach for the discovery of IN inhibitors is the use of peptides derived from the IN-binding sequences of IN-interacting proteins. Specific domains within viral proteins are responsible for their interaction with host-cell receptors and with other viral and cellular proteins enabling the completion of the viral propagation cycle within the host cell (1Greene W.C. Peterlin B.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 6Van Maele B. Debyser Z. AIDS Rev. 2005; 7: 26-43PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides derived from these binding domains may interfere with virus-host and virus-virus protein interactions and as such are excellent candidates as therapeutic agents. Using this approach, short peptides that inhibit IN enzymatic activity were obtained following analysis of the interaction between two of the HIV-1 proteins, RT and IN. Screening a complete library of RT-derived peptides demonstrated that two domains of about 20 amino acids mediate this interaction. Peptides bearing these amino acid sequences blocked IN enzymatic activities in vitro (7Oz Gleenberg I. Avidan O. Goldgur Y. Herschhorn A. Hizi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21987-21996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the present work, we observed a not yet described interaction between the HIV-1 Rev and IN proteins. The HIV-1 Rev is a karyophilic protein, which is required at the late phase of the viral life cycle for promoting nuclear export of partially spliced or un-spliced viral RNA (8Pollard V. Malim M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 491-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 9Li L. Li H.S. Pauza C.D. Bukrinsky M. Zhao R.Y. Cell Res. 2005; 15: 923-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Based on this finding, we identified two domains within the HIV-1 Rev protein that mediate its binding to IN. Peptides derived from these binding domains blocked IN enzymatic activity in vitro, penetrated into cultured cells, and inhibited viral cDNA integration and consequently HIV-1 replication. Cells—Monolayer adherent HeLa and HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The T-lymphocyte cell lines Sup T1 and H9, provided by the National Institutes of Health Reagent Program (Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH), was grown in RPMI 1640 medium. HeLa MAGI cells (TZM-bl) (10Derdeyn C.A. Decker J.M. Sfakianos J.N. Wu X. O'Brien W.A. Ratner L. Kappes J.C. Shaw G.M. Hunter E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8358-8367Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), which express the β-galactosidase gene under regulation of the trans-activation response element (11Kimpton J. Emerman M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2232-2239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were obtained through the NIH Reagent Program, and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. All media were supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 0.3 g/liter l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin (Biological Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel). Viruses—Wild-type HIV-1 was generated by transfection (12Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) of HEK293T cells with pSVC21 plasmid containing the full-length HIV-1HXB2 viral DNA (13Ratner L. Haseltine W. Patarca R. Livak K.J. Starcich B. Josephs S.F. Doran E.R. Rafalski J.A. Whitehorn E.A. Baumeister K. Ivanoff L. Petteway S.R. Pearson M.L. Lautenberger J.A. Papas T.S. Ghrayeb J. Chang N.T. Gallo C.G. Wong-Staal F. Nature. 1985; 313: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). Wild-type and Δenv/VSV-G viruses were harvested from HEK293T cells 48 and 72 h post-transfection with pSVC21 Δenv. The viruses were stored at -75 °C. Infection of Cultured Cells—Cultured lymphocytes (1 × 105) were centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 × g, the supernatant was aspirated and the cells were resuspended in 0.2 to 0.5 ml of medium containing virus at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 0.1 and 2. Following absorption for 1 h at 37 °C, the cells were washed to discard unbound virus and incubated for an additional 1 to 10 days. HIV-1 Titration MAGI Assay—Titration of HIV-1 was carried out by the MAGI assay, as described by Kimpton and Emerman (11Kimpton J. Emerman M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2232-2239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, TZM-b1 cells were transferred to 96-well plates at 10 × 103 cells per well. On the following day, the cells were infected with 50 μl of serially diluted HIV-1 Δenv/VSV-G virus in the presence of 20 μg/ml DEAE-dextran (GE Healthcare). Following a 2-h incubation, 150 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added. Two days post-infection, cultured cells were fixed with 1% (v/v) formaldehyde and 0.2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in PBS. Following an intensive wash with PBS, cells were stained with a solution of 4 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 4 mm potassium ferricyanide, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.4 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) (Ornat, Israel). Blue cells were counted under a light microscope at ×200 magnification. P24 Assay—H9 lymphoid cells were incubated with the indicated peptides for 2 h and following infection with wild-type HIV-1 at a m.o.i. of 0.1 (as described above) the cells were incubated for 10 days and the P24 content was estimated. Determination of HIV-1 P24 antigen was performed by using the capture assay kit (SAIC, AIDS Vaccine Program, Frederick, MD), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid Construction—All of the plasmids used in this study were constructed using PCR cloning techniques with the high-fidelity enzyme Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Clones were subjected to automated DNA sequencing. For the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) experiments, the yeast multicopy shuttle vectors pRS423 (with HIS3 as the selective marker) and pRS426 (with URA3 as the selective marker), both with the ADH1 promoter, were used as the cloning plasmids (a kind gift from Dr. D. Engelberg, Alexander Silberman Institute, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem). The DNA-coding region of the two yeast green fluorescent protein (GFP) fragments (14Magliery T.J. Wilson C.G. Pan W. Mishler D. Ghosh I. Hamilton A.D. Regan L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 146-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), namely the N terminus (GN) containing GFP amino acids 1-154, and the C terminus (GC) containing GFP amino acids 155-239, were cloned into pRS423 and pRS426, respectively. A linker consisting of (GGS)5 was used to separate the inserted genes. The final vectors were termed GN-linker (cloned into pRS423) and GC-linker (cloned into pRS426). The coding sequences of full-length HIV-1 IN, Rev, and Tat were amplified by PCR and inserted in-frame into the corresponding sites of the GN-linker in the C-terminal fragments of the GN, resulting in GN-IN, GN-Rev, and GN-Tat. For the co-immunoprecipitation experiments, mammalian Rev expression vectors was constructed by PCR amplification of HIV-1 Rev and ligation into the pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) expression vector. The IN mammalian expression was a generous gift from Dr. Z. Debyster (15Cherepanov P. Pluymers W. Claeys A. Proost P. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1389-1399PubMed Google Scholar). BiFC Assay to Study Protein-Protein Interactions—The plasmids described above were transformed into the yeast strain EGY48 (Clontech) and the cells were grown on yeast nitrogen base medium lacking histidine and uracil. After 48 h at 30 °C, the plates were transferred to 23 °C for 2 to 3 days and the appearance of fluorescence in yeast cells was visualized by confocal microscope (MRC 1024 confocal imaging system, Bio-Rad) as previously described (16Kass G. Arad G. Rosenbluh J. Gafni Y. Graessmann A. Rojas M.R. Gilbertson R.L. Loyter A. J. Gen. Virol. 2006; 87: 2709-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Study of in Vivo Protein-Protein Interactions Using the Co-immunoprecipitation Method—HEK293T cells were transfected with 5 μg of the Rev and IN mammalian expression vector genes using the calcium phosphate method (17Loyter A. Scangos G.A. Ruddle F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). After 48 h, cells were harvested and washed three times with PBS and then lysed by the addition of PBS containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. A sample from the lysate obtained was subjected to a SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblotted with either a monoclonal anti-Rev antibody (αRev) (NIH AIDS Research & Reference Reagent Program, catalog number 7376) or an antiserum raised against IN amino acids 276-288 (NIH AIDS Research & Reference Reagent Program catalog number 758) or an anti-actin (α-Actin) antibody (Santa Cruz). The remaining lysate was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with either the αRev or αIN antibodies. Following a 3-h incubation with protein G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz) at 4 °C, the samples were washed three times with PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40. An SDS buffer was added to the samples and after boiling and running on an SDS-PAGE gel the membranes were immunoblotted with either αIN or αRev antibodies. ELISA-based Binding Assays—Protein-protein binding was estimated using an ELISA-based binding assay exactly as previously described (18Rosenbluh J. Kapelnikov A. Shalev D.E. Rusnati M. Bugatti A. Loyter A. Anal. Biochem. 2006; 352: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Purification—Expression and purification of histidine-tagged Rev-GFP and GST-IN conjugates were performed as previously described (19Fineberg K. Fineberg T. Graessmann A.

The histidine-tagged IN expression vector was a generous gift from Dr. A. Engelman and its expression and purification were performed essentially as described previously (21Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Ghirlando R. Craigie R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7712-7718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). GST Pulldown—GST-IN or GST (15 μg) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 10 μl of glutathione beads (Sigma) in 200 μl of buffer A (100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing 0.25% Nonidet P-40. After washing with buffer A, the beads were resuspended in 200 μl of buffer A supplemented with 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% (v/v) sodium deoxycholate, and 2 μg of histidine-tagged GFP or Rev-GFP, for 30 min at room temperature. Following three washes with buffer A, SDS buffer was added and the samples were boiled and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-His tag antibody (Santa Cruz). Cell Penetration Experiments—Fluorescein-labeled peptides at a final concentration of 10 μm in PBS were incubated with HeLa cells for 2 h at 37 °C. After three washes in PBS, non-fixed cells were visualized by a confocal microscope (MRC 1024 confocal imaging system, Bio-Rad). Qualitative in Vitro Integration Assays—Monitoring of the 3′-end processing and strand-transfer activities of the IN, as well as preparation of the recombinant HIV-1 IN and the gelpurified oligonucleotides used for these enzymatic assays, were performed exactly as previously described (7Oz Gleenberg I. Avidan O. Goldgur Y. Herschhorn A. Hizi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21987-21996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Quantitative in Vitro Integration Assay—Determination of the IN enzymatic activity enzymes in a quantitative way was preformed using a previously described assay system (22Hwang Y. Rhodes D. Bushman F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4884-4892Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 23Craigie R. Mizuuchi K. Bushman F.D. Engelman A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2729-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In this assay a oligonucleotide substrate of which one oligo (5′-ACTGCTAGAGATTTTCCACACTGACTAAAAGGGTC) was labeled with biotin on the 3′-end and the other oligo (5′-GACCCTTTTAGTCAGTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCAGT) was labeled with digoxigenin at the 5′-end. The final reaction mixture contained 390 nm IN, 1 μm double strand oligonucleotide DNA, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10% Me2SO, 5% PEG-8000, 0.1 mg/ml BSA at 40 μl. When peptide inhibition was tested the IN was preincubated with the peptide for 10 min prior to addition of the DNA substrate. Following a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, 60 μl of a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 400 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA and salmon sperm DNA was added. This overall integrase reaction was followed by an immunosorbent assay on avidin-coated plates as described (22Hwang Y. Rhodes D. Bushman F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4884-4892Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Peptide Synthesis, Labeling, and Purification—Peptides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems (ABI) 433A peptide synthesizer using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. The amino acids were purchased from NOVAbiochem or Bio-Lab (Jerusalem, Israel). The peptides were labeled at their N terminus with 5′ (and 6′)-carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes) using a 4-fold excess of the fluorescein and 4-fold excess of hydroxybenzotriazole. The peptides were purified on a Gilson HPLC using a reverse-phase C8 semi-preparative column (ACE, C-8 RP) with a gradient from 5 to 60% buffer B in buffer A (buffer A, 0.001% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water, and buffer B, 0.001% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile). The identity of the peptides was confirmed using an ABI voyager matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer.

Open table in a new tab Fluorescence Anisotropy—Binding studies were performed at 10 °C using a PerkinElmer LS-50b luminescence spectrofluorometer equipped with a Hamilton microlab M dispenser. The fluorescein-labeled peptides were dissolved in 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) at the desired ionic strength to a final concentration of 0.05 to 0.1 μm. A 1-ml aliquot of the peptide solution was placed in a cuvette, and 200 μl of 100 μm IN protein (IN molarity was calculated assuming IN monomer) was titrated into the peptide solution in 20 steps of 10 μl each at 15-min intervals. The total fluorescence and anisotropy were measured after each addition. The excitation wavelength was 480 nm and the emission wavelength was 530 nm. The bandwidths were changed depending on the concentration of the labeled molecule used. Data were fitted to the Hill equation,R=R0+ΔR⋅(Kan⋅[IN]n)1+Kan⋅[IN]n(Eq. 1) where R is the measured fluorescence anisotropy value, ΔR is the amplitude of the fluorescence change from the initial value (peptide only) to the final value (peptide in complex), [IN]isthe protein concentration added, R0 is the starting fluorescence anisotropy value, corresponding to the free peptide, and Ka is the association constant, which is equal to 1/Kd (the dissociation constant). Quantization of Integrated HIV-1 DNA in the Cellular Genome—Following incubation of Sup T1 cells with the indicated peptides for 2 h, the cells were infected with a HIV-1 Δenv/VSV-G virus at a m.o.i. of 2 (as described above) for 24 h. During the first round PCR, integrated HIV-1 sequences were amplified with the HIV-1 LTR-specific primer (LTR-TAG-F, 5′-ATGCCACGTAAGCGAAACTCTGGCTAACTAGGGAACCCACTG-3′) and Alu-targeting primers (first-Alu-F, 5′-AGCCTCCCGAGTAGCTGGGA-3′ and first Alu-R, 5′-TTACAGGCATGAGCCACCG-3′) (24Yamamoto N. Tanaka C. Wu Y. Chang M.O. Inagaki Y. Saito Y. Naito T. Ogasawara H. Sekigawa I. Hayashida Y. Virus Genes. 2006; 32: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that annealed to conserved regions of the Alu repeat element. Alu-LTR fragments were amplified from 1/10 of the total cell DNA in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing 1× PCR buffer, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, 300 nm primers, and 0.025 units/μl of Taq polymerase. The first round PCR cycle conditions were as follows: a DNA denaturation and polymerase activation step of 10 min at 95 °C and then 12 cycles of amplification (95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 5 min). During the second round PCR, the first round PCR product could be specifically amplified by using the tag-specific primer (tag-F, 5′-ATGCCACGTAAGCGAAACTC-3′) and the LTR primer (LTR-R, 5′-AGGCAAGCTTTATTGAGGCTTAAG-3′) designed by Primer Express (Applied Biosystems) using default settings. The second round PCR was performed on 1/25 of the first round PCR product in a mixture containing 300 nm of each primer, 12.5 μl of 2× SYBR Green master mixture (Applied Biosystems) at a final volume of 25 μl, run on an ABI PRIZM 7700 (Applied Biosystems). The second round PCR cycles began with DNA denaturation and a polymerase-activation step (95 °C for 10 min), followed by 50 cycles of amplification (95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 60 s). For generating a linear curve the SVC21 plasmid containing the full-length HIV-1HXB2 viral DNA was used as a template. In the first round PCR the LTR-TAG-F and LTR-R primers were used and the second round PCR was preformed using the tag-F and LTR-R primers. The standard linear curve was in the range of 5 ng to 0.25 fg (r = 0.99). DNA samples were assayed with quadruplets of each sample. PCR Analysis of Early Viral Genes—Sup T1 cells were incubated with 12.5 μm of either peptides or with 2 μm azidothymidine for 2 h, cells following infection with a HIV-1 Δenv/VSV-G virus at a m.o.i of 2, and incubation for 6 h. The viral Gag or Nef DNA sequences were amplified using specific primers: Gag specific primers, 5′-AGTGGGGGGACATCAAGCAGCCATG-3′ and 5′-TGCTATGTCAGTTCCCCTTGGTTCTC-3′, and Nef specific primers, 5′-CCTGGCTAGAAGCACAAGAG-3′ and 5′-CTTGTAGCAAGCTCGATGTC-3′. The fragments were amplified from 10 ng of the total cell DNA in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing 1× PCR buffer, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, 300 nm primers, and 0.025 units/μl of Taq polymerase. The PCR conditions were as follows: a DNA denaturation and polymerase activation step of 5 min at 95 °C and then 29 cycles of amplification (95 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 45 s). Effect of Peptides on Cell Viability Using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium Bromide) Assay—Following incubation with the indicated peptides, the medium was removed and the cells were incubated in Earl's solution containing 0.3 mg/ml MTT for 1 h. Subsequently, the solution was removed and the cells were dissolved in 100 μl of Me2SO for 10 min at room temperature. The Me2SO-solubilized cells were transferred to a 96-well ELISA plate, and OD values were monitored at a wavelength of 570 nm (25Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45053) Google Scholar). HIV-1 IN and Rev Proteins Interact When Expressed in Yeast and Mammalian Cultured Cells—Using the BiFC assay, we show that the HIV-1 Rev and IN proteins interact with each other in yeast cells (Fig. 1). In this assay, two proteins of interest are fused to the non-fluorescent N- or C-terminal halves of the GFP molecule (termed GN and GC). Intracellular restoration of the fluorescence of GFP indicates interaction between the two fused proteins (14Magliery T.J. Wilson C.G. Pan W. Mishler D. Ghosh I. Hamilton A.D. Regan L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 146-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 26Kerppola T.K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). An interaction between the Rev and IN proteins can be inferred from the appearance of fluorescence within yeast cells transfected with plasmids bearing the coding sequence of these two proteins fused to GFP fragments (Fig. 1, e and f). The fluorescence is seen within the cells' nuclei, suggesting that the Rev-IN interaction either does not disturb the karyophilic properties of these two proteins (27Demart S. Ceccherini-Silberstein F. Schlicht S. Walcher S. Wolff H. Neumann M. Erfle V. Brack-Werner R. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 291: 484-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 28Depienne C. Mousnier A.

No fluorescence was observed when the two GFP halves were transfected to the yeast cell, indicating the reliability of the BiFC assay (Fig. 1, o and p). Moreover, no fluorescence was detected when one of the expressing vectors lacked the interacting protein, either Rev (Fig. 1, g and h) or IN (Fig. 1, i and j), and contained only the GFP fragment. Nor was any interaction observed when the HIV-1 Tat protein was allowed to interact with IN (Fig. 1, k and l) or Rev (Fig. 1, m and n), indicating the specificity of the interaction. When expressed in yeast cells, the IN and Rev proteins retained their ability to form homo-oligomers (29Daelemans D. Costes S.V. Cho E.H. Erwin-Cohen R.A. Lockett S. Pavlakis G.N. J. Biol.

To confirm the interaction between Rev and IN, we used co-immunoprecipitation in mammalian cell extracts. Rev and IN interacted with each other in mammalian cells, indicating that the observed interaction is not due to the use of tagged proteins (such as with GFP) or yeast cells (Fig. 2). Interaction of IN and Rev in Cell-free Systems—In vitro binding assay systems, with recombinant purified proteins, were used to further characterize the interaction between Rev and IN. Because the recombinant Rev protein is highly insoluble (31Watts N.R. Misra M. Wingfield P.T. Stahl S.J. Cheng N. Trus B.L. Steven A.C. Williams R.W. J. Struct.

Using ELISA, we show that biotin-labeled BSA-IN (Bb-IN) binds to Rev-GFP with an apparent Kd of 13 nm (Fig. 3a). There are two reasons for covalently attaching the IN to biotinylated BSA.

We developed an approach to study it directly by amperometry using carbon fiber microelectrodes in organotypic rat brainstem slice cultures. Noradrenergic neurons from areas A1 and A2 were fluorescently labeled by an adenoviral vector with noradrenergic-specific promoter. Quantal events, consistent with exocytotic release of norepinephrine, were registered at noradrenergic axonal varicosities as well as at cell bodies. According to their charge integrals, events were grouped into two populations. The majority (∼40 fC) were compatible with full exocytotic fusion of small clear and dense core vesicles shown in previous morphometric studies. The quantal size distribution was modulated by treatment with reserpine and amitriptyline. In addition, much larger quantal events (>1 pC) occurred at predominantly axonal release sites. The time course of signals wa..."
https://openalex.org/W1967480535,"Mesangial cell proliferation is pivotal to the pathology of glomerular injury in inflammation. We have previously reported that lipoxins, endogenously produced eicosanoids with anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution bioactions, can inhibit mesangial cell proliferation in response to several agents. This process is associated with elaborate receptor cross-talk involving modification receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation (McMahon, B., Mitchell, D., Shattock, R., Martin, F., Brady, H. R., and Godson, C. (2002) FASEB J. 16, 1817-1819). Here we demonstrate that the lipoxin A(4) (LXA(4)) receptor is coupled to activation and recruitment of the SHP-2 (SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase-2) within a lipid raft microdomain. Using site-directed mutagenesis of the cytosolic domain of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRbeta), we report that mutation of the sites for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Tyr(740) and Tyr(751)) and SHP-2 (Tyr(763) and Tyr(1009)) recruitment specifically inhibit the effect of LXA(4) on the PDGFRbeta signaling; furthermore inhibition of SHP-2 expression with short interfering RNA constructs blocked the effect of LXA(4) on PDGFRbeta phosphorylation. We demonstrate that association of the PDGFRbeta with lipid raft microdomains renders it susceptible to LXA(4)-mediated dephosphorylation by possible reactivation of oxidatively inactivated SHP-2. These data further elaborate on the potential mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory, proresolution, and anti-fibrotic bioactions of lipoxins."
https://openalex.org/W2043042627,"Large DNA viruses such as herpesvirus and poxvirus encode proteins that target and exploit the chemokine system of their host. These proteins have the potential to block or change the orchestrated recruitment of leukocytes to sites of viral infection. The genome of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) encodes three chemokine-like proteins named vCCL1, vCCL2, and vCCL3. In this study vCCL3 was probed in parallel with vCCL1 and vCCL2 against a panel of the 18 classified human chemokine receptors. In calcium mobilization assays vCCL1 acted as a selective CCR8 agonist, whereas vCCL2 was found to act as a broad spectrum chemokine antagonist of human chemokine receptors, including the lymphotactin receptor. In contrast vCCL3 was found to be a highly selective agonist for the human lymphotactin receptor XCR1. The potency of vCCL3 was found to be 10-fold higher than the endogenous human XCL1 chemokine in respect to phosphatidylinositol turnover and calcium mobilization as well as chemotaxis. High expression of XCR1 was found in placenta and neutrophils by real-time PCR. These data are consistent with reports of different expression profiles for vCCL2 and vCCL3 during the life cycle of KSHV, indicate a novel, sophisticated exploitation by the virus of specifically the lymphotactin receptor by both agonist and antagonist mechanisms, and suggest a unique physiological importance of this (somewhat overlooked) chemokine receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1974496207,"Rin1, the prototype of a new family of multidomain Rab5 exchange factors, has been shown to play an important role in the endocytosis of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Herein, we examined the role of Rin1 in the down-regulation of EGFR following EGF stimulation. We observed that overexpression of Rin1 accelerates EGFR degradation in EGF-stimulated cells. In concordance, depletion of endogenous Rin1 by RNA interference resulted in a substantial reduction of EGFR degradation. We showed that Rin1 interacts with signal-transducing adaptor molecule 2 (STAM2), a protein that associates with hepatocyte growth factor-regulated substrate and plays a key role in the endosomal sorting machinery. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Rin1 co-localizes with hemagglutinin (HA)-STAM2 and with endogenous hepatocyte growth factor-regulated substrate. Furthermore, wild type STAM2, but not a deletion mutant lacking the SH3 domain, co-immunoprecipitates with endogenous Rin1. This interaction is dependent on the proline-rich domain (PRD) of Rin1 as Rin1ΔPRD, a mutant lacking the PRD, does not interact with STAM2. Moreover, EGFR degradation was not accelerated by expression of the Rin1ΔPRD mutant. Together these results suggest that Rin1 regulates EGFR degradation in cooperation with STAM, defining a novel role for Rin1 in regulating endosomal trafficking.

Recent studies have shown that through its interaction with Abl tyrosine kinase, Rin1 mediates actin cytoskeleton remodeling associated with migration and adhesion of epithelial cells (30Hu H.

Identification of additional Rin1-interacting partners is critical to understanding the dynamic of EGFR trafficking. The presence of a PRD suggests that Rin1 interacts with SH3-containing proteins involved in EGFR trafficking. In this study, we identified the interaction between Rin1 and STAM and studied its function in EGFR trafficking and degradation. Antibodies and Reagents—Human epidermal growth factor and monoclonal anti-EGFR (Ab5) antibody were obtained from Calbiochem. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Rin1 and mouse monoclonal anti-EEA1 antibodies were purchased from BD Bio-sciences. Mouse monoclonal anti-HA and rabbit polyclonal anti-EGFR 1005 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-β-tubulin anti-body was from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-V5 antibody was from Invitrogen. Rabbit polyclonal Hrs antibody was a gift of Dr. Tim McGraw (Cornell University). Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa, HEK293 and Cos7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% bovine growth serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C with 5% CO2.

HeLa or HEK293 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for immunoblot and immunoprecipitation experiments. Transfections were performed according to manufacturer’s instruction. Plasmid Constructs—A Rin1 expression construct was prepared by subcloning full-length human Rin1 PCR product into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO TA (Invitrogen). pcDNA3.1-Rin1 has been previously described (37Barbieri M.A. Kong C.

Lodhi I.J. Saltiel A.R. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27982-27990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The sequences specific for Rin1 5′-AACAGTCTGAGACAACTGCTG-3′ and 5′-AACATGTCCTGGAGAAGTCAT-3′ were used for synthesis. A scrambled siRNA (Ambion) was used as a negative control. 4-6 h before the transfection, HeLa cells were plated in growth medium without antibiotics to obtain 30-50% confluence. The transfection of siRNA (20 nm final concentration) was performed using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. 48 h after transfection, the cells were used for immunoblot and immunocytochemical analysis. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscope Sciences, Hatfield, PA) for 20 min and quenched for 10 min with 50 mm ammonium chloride. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, blocked with 2% goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, and incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h followed by Alexa Fluor 594- or 488-goat anti-mouse or rabbit secondary antibodies (Invitrogen/Molecular Probe) for 30 min at room temperature. The coverslips were mounted with fluorescent mounting medium (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA). Images were collected using a MRC1024 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a ×63 objective (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Immunoblot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—Whole cell lysates were prepared with the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C prior to separation by SDS-PAGE. The resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were blocked in TBST (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat milk. The membranes were then incubated with primary anti-bodies in 2% bovine serum albumin/TBST overnight at 4 °C or 2 h at room temperature followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA), and proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (Pierce). Immunoblot data were quantified by Alpha-EaseFC 4.0 software (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). For immunoprecipitation, the clarified cell lysates were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with protein A- or G-Sepharose (Sigma) for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed extensively with STE buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) and solubilized in SDS sample loading buffer. Overexpression of Rin1 Enhances EGFR Degradation—Previous reports show that Rin1 interacts with the EGFR through its SH2 domain and that the interaction modulates EGFR endocytosis (37Barbieri M.A. Kong C. Chen P.I. Horazdovsky B.F. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32027-32036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The interaction between Rin1 and EGFR following internalization may be sustained and may mediate the trafficking of the EGFR to the MVB for degradation. To examine this possibility, murine NR6 cells stably expressing both hEGFR and hRin1 (note that untransfected NR6 cells have virtually undetectable levels of endogenous Rin1) or control NR6 cells expressing hEGFR and vector alone were stimulated with EGF in the presence of cycloheximide. Following EGF stimulation, the cells were washed, and whole cell lysates were prepared. Proteins were analyzed by immunoblot with antibodies recognizing EGFR, Rin1, and tubulin. The Western blots show that the rate of EGFR degradation following stimulation by EGF is substantially increased by overexpression of Rin1 (Fig. 1A). To further evaluate the effects of Rin1 expression on endogenous EGFR trafficking, we transfected HeLa cells with GFP-Rin1 construct and followed both endogenous EGFR and GFP-Rin1 by light microscopy. Transfected HeLa cells were serum-starved for 3 h and preincubated with EGF (100 ng/ml) at 4 °C for 1 h. The cells were then warmed to 37 °C in the absence of ligand for 10 and 20 min. Localization of EGFR and Rin1 were then examined by confocal microscopy. Prior to warm up, EGFR is localized almost exclusively to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1B, top panel). Overexpression of Rin1 had no apparent effect on the distribution of EGFR. After 10 min of stimulation, the receptor was clustered and internalized into small punctate structures that probably correspond to early endosomes (Fig. 1B, middle panel). Although Rin1 expression is known to increase EGFR internalization (37Barbieri M.A. Kong C. Chen P.I. Horazdovsky B.F. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32027-32036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the amounts of internalized EGFR between transfected cells and untransfected cells were similar at 10 min. However, after 20 min, cells expressing Rin1 contained significantly less EGFR than untransfected cells (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). Interestingly, overexpressed GFP-Rin1 also shows a nuclear localization in addition to endosomes in cells overexpressing the fusion protein (Fig. 1B). It has been difficult to identify endogenous Rin1 by immunocytochemical studies in part because the commercially available antibodies detect nonspecific targets. Thus, we set out to examine the localization of endogenous Rin1 using standard cellular fractionation methods. As shown in the supplemental data (supplemental Fig. S1), endogenous Rin1 was enriched in both cytosol and endosome/lysosome fractions and was also detected in membrane/nuclear fractions. There are several nuclear localization signal motifs in Rin1. Why endogenous Rin1, as detected by immunofluorescence, is not detected in nuclei is not clear. It is possible that endogenous Rin1 is retained in the cytosolic compartment via intermolecular interactions with effector proteins or binding partners and that following overexpression, such interactions are saturated and insufficient to prevent nuclear localization. Together, these results indicate that overexpression of Rin1 accelerates the degradation of EGFR. Suppression of Rin1 Delays EGFR Degradation—To provide stronger evidence that Rin1 accelerates EGFR degradation, we employed RNA interference to suppress endogenous Rin1. HeLa cells were depleted of Rin1 by transfection with two small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes with sequences specific to Rin1 or a nonspecific scrambled siRNA. Cells were then serum-starved and stimulated with EGF in the presence of cycloheximide. At various times of incubation, whole cells lysates were prepared and examined by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2A, Rin1 was efficiently depleted by specific siRNAs (typically more than 90% knockdown). In control cells, EGFR degradation was virtually completed within 60 min. However, in HeLa cells depleted of Rin1, EGFR degradation was substantially delayed (Fig. 2, A and B). We have observed that t½ (the time required to degrade 50% of the amounts of EGFR at time 0) of EGFR degradation depends upon the amount of receptors at steady state. The higher the EGFR level is, the longer it takes. That is why endogenous EGF receptors in HeLa cells are degraded much faster than overexpressed receptors in NR6/EGFR cell line (Fig. 1A). To extend the analysis of the effect of Rin1 knockdown on EGFR trafficking, we examined Rin1-depleted cells by immunocytochemistry. In both control and Rin1-depleted cells, most of the EGFR was located at or near the cell surface before stimulation. After the addition of EGF for 10 min, the EGFR was found in early endosomes (mainly co-localized with EEA1, an early endosome marker, data not shown) in both control and Rin1-depleted cells. In control cells, the overall intensity of the EGFR signal was significantly weakened by 30 min, consistent with the Western blot data. However, in Rin1-depleted cells, the EGFR signal at 30 min remained strong and showed a punctate distribution throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 2C). Collectively, we have shown by different approaches that Rin1 regulates EGFR degradation. Rin1 Associates with STAM2—Delivery of the EGFR to the MVB is initiated by the ESCRT-0 components STAM and Hrs (26Clague M.J. Urbe S. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 551-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We set out to determine whether the effect of Rin1 on EGFR degradation involved or required STAM and possibly other components of endosomal sorting machinery. Cos7 cells co-transfected with constructs encoding GFP-Rin1 and either HA-STAM2 or Hrs display extensive co-localization of Rin1 with both STAM2 and Hrs in endosomes (Fig. 3A). We reasoned that Rin1 might interact with the SH3 domain of STAM2 given the fact that Rin1 possesses a proline-rich domain. To address this question, HeLa cells were transfected with HA-tagged wild type STAM2 or a STAM2 mutant lacking the SH3 domain (STAM2ΔSH3). Co-immunoprecipitations were carried out using an anti-Rin1 antibody, and precipitates were immunoblotted to reveal Rin1 and the STAM2 proteins. We found that HA-STAM2WT, but not HA-STAM2ΔSH3, co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous Rin1 (Fig. 3B). Since STAM and Hrs are forming complex in endosomes, our co-immunoprecipitation experiment showed that GFP-Rin1 was also able to pull down both Hrs and STAM (data not show). These results suggested that Rin1 binds STAM2 and Hrs on endosomes, possibly through the SH3 domain of STAM2 and proline-rich domain of Rin1. There are many proteins containing the SH3 domain, and STAM may not be the only protein that is recruited to Rin1. However, it is possible that the interaction between Rin1 and STAM is required for Rin1-mediated EGFR degradation. The Proline-rich Domain of Rin1 Is Required for STAM2 Binding—To test whether the proline-rich domain of Rin1 is required for association with STAM2, a V5-tagged Rin1 pro-line-rich domain deletion construct (Rin1ΔPRD-V5) was made and co-expressed with HA-STAM2 or HA-STAM2ΔSH3 in HEK293 cells. The scheme of Rin1 and STAM2 constructs used was shown in Fig. 4A. 24 h later, the cells were lysed, and immunoprecipitation was carried out with a V5 antibody. Immunoblot analysis was carried out with anti-HA and anti-V5 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4B, Rin1WT-V5, but not Rin1ΔPRD-V5, was able to pull down HA-STAM2. When the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with HA antibody (Fig. 4C), the interaction between the HA-STAM2 and Rin1WT-V5 was confirmed (lane 1), whereas the interaction between HA-STAM and Rin1ΔPRD-V5 was substantially reduced (lane 2). This experiment also examined the interaction between HA-STAM2ΔSH3 and Rin1WT-V5 (lane 3) or HA-STAM2ΔSH3 and Rin1ΔPRD-V5 (lane 4). Although HA-STAM2 efficiently co-precipitated Rin1WT-V5, HA-STAM2ΔSH3 failed to pull down Rin1WT-V5. These data indicate that Rin1 and STAM interact via the PRD of Rin1 and the SH3 domain of STAM. EGF Stimulation Increases the Association of EGFR with Both Rin1 and STAM—Previous studies showed that Rin1 binds EGFR through the SH2 domain of Rin1 (37Barbieri M.A. Kong C. Chen P.I. Horazdovsky B.F. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32027-32036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Given the results in Fig. 4 showing that Rin1 interacts with STAM2, we examined whether the EGFR can be found as part of a Rin1-STAM2 complex. To test this possibility, HEK293 cells were transfected with constructs encoding GFP-EGFR, HA-STAM2, and Rin1-V5. The cells were serum-starved for 3 h and then incubated with or without EGF for 10 min. Whole cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with EGFR antibody. The resulting immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis using antibodies against EGFR, Rin1, or HA. As shown in Fig. 5A, EGFR has a significant increase binding with both Rin1 and STAM2 after the EGF stimulation, indicating the formation of EGF-dependent EGFR-Rin1-STAM complex. To address whether internalized EGFRs traffic through the Rin1-containing endosomes and Rin1 also co-localizes with STAM upon the stimulation, Cos7 cells were transfected with EGFR-GFP and Rin1-V5 or GFP-Rin1 and HA-STAM. Following incubation with EGF for 10 min, the cells were then stained with V5 or HA antibodies. This analysis showed that most of the EGFR-containing endosomes were positive for Rin1 (supplemental Fig. S2) in agreement with our previous report (37Barbieri M.A. Kong C. Chen P.I. Horazdovsky B.F. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32027-32036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Furthermore, without EGF stimulation (Fig. 5B, upper panel), Rin1 was primarily cytosolic with partially a few plasma membrane localizations. After incubation with EGF (Fig. 5B, lower panel), Rin1 co-localized with STAM on endosomes, and those STAM-containing endosomes were also labeled with EGFR (supplemental Fig. S3). These light microscopy studies are consistent with the result in Fig. 5A, suggesting that EGFR together with Rin1 is recruited to STAM-positive compartments in a EGF-dependent manner. Rin1 Mutant without Proline-rich Domain (Rin1ΔPRD) Fails to Promote EGFR Degradation—To investigate the functional role of the PRD-mediated Rin1-STAM interaction, we examined the effect of expressing the Rin1ΔPRD mutant on EGFR degradation. Rin1WT or Rin1ΔPRD was co-expressed with EGFR in HEK293 cells. The cells were stimulated with EGF for up to 2 h. Immunoblot analysis of the total cell lysates was carried out with anti-EGFR and anti-Rin1 antibodies. Again, EGF receptor degradation was substantially accelerated in cells expressing Rin1 WT (as compared with vector alone Fig. 6A). EGF receptor degradation in cells expressing the Rin1ΔPRD mutant was slightly accelerated. However, the difference in EGFR degradation between transfected and control cells was not statistically significant (the means ± S.E. of the relative EGFR levels are shown in Fig. 6B). To determine whether the lack of any effect of the Rin1ΔPRD mutant on EGFR degradation was due to some alteration in the interaction between Rin1 and Rab5, we examined the interaction between Rin1ΔPRD and Rab5a. We showed in the supplemental data (supplemental Fig. S4) that both Rin1 and Rin1ΔPRD mutant are able to bind Rab5: S34N, the dominant negative form of Rab5a. Moreover, previous studies showed that a Rin1 construct lacking the N-terminal SH2 domain and the proline-rich domain (but including the vps9 domain and Ras binding domain) tested positively for Rab5 exchange activity (31Tall G.G. Barbieri M.A. Stahl P.D. Horazdovsky B.F. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). These findings indicated that the PRD was not essential for Rab5 exchange activity. Together, the data in Fig. 6 indicate that although Rin1 expression accelerates EGFR degradation, Rin1 lacking the PRD domain is largely unable to promote EGF-induced EGFR degradation. This provides further support for a functional role for Rin1-STAM interaction during EGFR trafficking. Our results define a novel role for Rin1 in regulating the degradation of the EGF receptor. At the outset of experiments leading to this report, our hypothesis was built around the concept of Rin1 as a mediator of EGFR signal transduction. Two paradoxical findings changed the focus of our work. 1) When we overexpressed Rin1, we blocked EGF-triggered activation of the Raf kinase pathway and the proliferative response to EGF (36Barbieri M.A. Fernandez-Pol S. Hunker C. Horazdovsky B.H. Stahl P.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). 2) When we overexpressed Rab5a, we enhanced the signal-transducing properties of EGF including cell proliferation (36Barbieri M.A. Fernandez-Pol S. Hunker C. Horazdovsky B.H. Stahl P.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We queried how it could be that overexpression of Rin1, an activator of Rab5, suppressed EGFR signaling, whereas overexpression of Rab5, the target of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity of Rin1, enhanced EGFR signaling. This led us to use RNA interference to suppress Rin1 expression to better understand its function and determine whether the negative effects of Rin1 in EGFR signaling are due to a specific effect on EGFR degradation. In this report, we have used complementary overexpression and RNA interference knock-down approaches to demonstrate the role of Rin1 in EGFR trafficking and degradation. We observed that although endogenous Rin1 is present in the cytosolic fraction, substantial amounts are present in membrane-associated pools similar to Hrs and STAM. Like STAM and Hrs, Rin1 may cycle from membrane to cytosol during cycles of EGFR targeting to the MVB. As a component of the endosome sorting machinery, STAM binds Hrs via their respective coiled-coil regions (19Mizuno E. Kawahata K. Okamoto A. Kitamura N. Komada M. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 2004; 135: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 40Takata H. Kato M. Denda K. Kitamura N. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Hrs possesses a FYVE domain that binds to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate that is enriched on endosomes (13Raymond C.K. Howald-Stevenson I. Vater C.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1389-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 41Gaullier J.M. Simonsen A. D'Arrigo A. Bremnes B. Stenmark H. Aasland R. Nature. 1998; 394: 432-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) and that recruits the Hrs-STAM complex to the endosome. Our double immunofluorescence analysis showed that Rin1 co-localized with both overexpressed and endogenous Hrs on endosomes. Endogenous Rin1 was able to pull down wild type STAM2 but not a STAM2-SH3 deletion mutant, and overexpressed STAM binds full-length Rin1 but not Rin1 lacking a proline-rich domain. These two independent approaches provided further evidence that Rin1 associates with the STAM-Hrs complex. Previous studies have shown that the SH2 domain of Rin1 interacts, directly or indirectly, with the EGF receptor. In this report, we show that Rin1ΔPRD, a mutant lacking the proline-rich domain, retains binding to the EGFR but fails to associate with STAM. It is likely that Rin1 performs its regulatory function with the EGFR by recruiting the receptor into the STAM-Hrs complex through its proline-rich domain. The mutually exclusive interaction of STAM and of EGFR with Rin1 indicated that Rin1ΔPRD would interfere with the ability STAM-Hrs to recruit EGFR to the MVB pathway. Supporting this view, overexpression of Rin1 wild type in HEK293 cells showed an accelerated EGFR degradation, whereas Rin1ΔPRD expression had only minimal effects on EGFR degradation. Ubiquitination has been established as a key component of the targeting mechanism directing EGFR to the MVB pathway. Deubiquitination of membrane proteins targeted for degradation also appears to be an essential element. Two ubiquitin isopeptidases or deubiquitinases, ubiquitin-specific protease Y (UBPY) and associated molecule with the SH3 domain of STAM (AMSH), have been identified as hydrolases that deubiquitinate EGFR (26Clague M.J. Urbe S. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 551-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 42McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbe S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 43Row P.E. Prior I.A. McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbe S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12618-12624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Both enzymes have been shown to bind to STAM via a proline-rich motif on the deubiquitinase and the SH3 domain of STAM. Based upon these data, a model for the role of Rin1 in EGFR trafficking and degradation can be envisaged. EGFR can enter the MVB pathway by multiple routes, one of which is regulated by Rin1. Rin1, by interacting with STAM, enhances the recruitment of EGFR into a functional STAM-Hrs complex and perhaps stabilizes the recruitment of one or more deubiquitinases. Disruption of this association by suppression of Rin1 would then decrease the availability of EGFR to the ESCRT complex, disrupt lysosomal targeting of EGFR, and impair EGFR down-regulation. It remains unclear how the interaction of Rin1 with STAM2 facilitates or competes with AMSH or UBPY recruitment, which clearly required further experiments. Rin1 was initially identified by Colicelli and colleagues (27Han L. Wong D. Dhaka A. Afar D. White M. Xie W. Herschman H. Witte O. Colicelli J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4954-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) as a Ras-interacting protein. They showed that Rin1 interacts with GTP-Ras and thereby competes with Raf1 (28Wang Y. Waldron R.T. Dhaka A. Patel A. Riley M.M. Rozengurt E. Colicelli J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 916-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). More recent work from the same group indicates that Rin1 interacts with the tyrosine kinase Abl and that via phosphorylation of CRK and CRKL, Rin1 plays a role in actin remodeling and cell migration in epithelial cells and neurons (30Hu H. Bliss J.M. Wang Y. Colicelli J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 815-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Abl binds Rin1 through the PRD and SH2 domains of Rin1, the same domains that we have shown to interact with STAM2 and EGFR, respectively. Thus, it would seem that Rin1 plays dualroles, one facilitating cytoskeletal-dependent cellular movement and a second facilitating vesicle trafficking and receptor degradation. These two roles have some common features, however, both requiring interactions with the cytoskeleton. Our preliminary studies indicate that Rin1 is potentially active in vesicle motility. 3C. Kong and P. D Stahl, unpublished data. Future work will need to focus on bringing these two themes, actin remodeling and vesicle motility, together. What is the physiological function of Rin1? Rin1 is selectively expressed in various tissues and cells (27Han L. Wong D. Dhaka A. Afar D. White M. Xie W. Herschman H. Witte O. Colicelli J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4954-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Some cultured cells have high levels of expression. Others appear to be Rin1-negative. Rin1 may serve specialized functions in cells where motility or signal attenuation might be important possibly as a tumor suppressor or as a mediator of some developmental or physiological process.

However, the mechanism(s) controlling Nlp expression remains largely unknown. Here we have shown that Nlp expression is cell cycle-dependent with a peak at G2/M transition in human cells. Nlp is a short-lived protein and degraded by the proteasome via the anaphase-promoting cyclosome complex (APC/c) pathway. It interacts with the APC/c through the APC2 or Cdc27 subunits and is ubiquitinated. Following treatment with proteasome inhibitors, its protein level is elevated. Nlp binds in vivo to the degradation-targeting proteins Cdh1 and Cdc20, and overexpression of Cdh1 and Cdc20 enhances Nlp degradation. Using point mutations of the two putative degradation signals in Nlp, we have found that its degradation requires intact KEN-box and D-box. Interestingly, the Lys-Glu-Asn-D-box-mutated Nlp exhibits a much stronger capability of inducing anchorage-independent growth and multinuclearity compared with the wild type Nlp. Taken together, these findings indicate that Nlp expression is cell cycle-dependent and regulated by APC-mediated protein degradation.

Several mechanisms have been involved in such chromosomal abnormality. One well characterized mechanism is improper centrosome duplication (1Fukasawa K. Cancer Lett. 2005; 230: 6-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In a normal cell, centrosomes start duplicating at early S phase, and by M phase, the cell has two mature centrosomes that form the bipolar spindle, an essential structure for proper separation of duplicated chromosomes between daughter cells. Because the centrosome is the organelle that organizes the spindle for separation of chromosomes during mitosis, centrosome stability is required for successful mitosis in mammalian cells. The presence of more than two centrosomes in a cell can result in lost or fragmented chromosomes after cell division and generation of aneuploidy, which are closely associated with cell transformation and tumorigenesis (2Doxsey S.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E105-E108Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 3Hinchcliffe E.H. Sluder G. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1167-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 4Shao S. Wang Y.

Chem. 2006; 281: 28943-28950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).The regulation of centrosomes has been linked to several tumor suppressors and their targeted genes. Tumor suppressor p53 is thought to be required for the control of centrosome duplication, and mutations of p53 result in centrosome amplification (5Loffler H. Lukas J. Bartek J. Kramer A. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 2633-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition, there is growing evidence that BRCA1 functions as a regulator of centrosome stability and function. BRCA1-conditional knock-outs exhibit increased centrosome copies and abnormal mitotic progression (6Deng C.X. Mutat. Res. 2001; 477: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The p53-regulated p21 plays vital roles in regulating centrosome replication in S phase through its inhibition of Cdk2/cyclin E kinase (7Salisbury J.L. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2001; 6: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In contrast, p53-regulated Gadd45 appears to regulate centrosome stability via its inhibition with Cdc2/cyclin B1 and Aurora-A (4Shao S. Wang Y. Jin S. Song Y. Wang X. Fan W. Zhao Z. Fu M. Tong T. Dong L. Fan F. Xu N. Zhan Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28943-28950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Also, several mitotic kinases have been involved in the control of centrosome maturation, including Plk1, Aurora A, and Nek2 kinases (8Goto H. Kiyono T. Tomono Y. Kawajiri A. Urano T. Furukawa K. Nigg E.A. Inagaki M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 180-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 9Lindon C. Pines J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Plk1 contains a highly conserved polo box domain in the noncatalytic C-terminal half of the protein. This domain is required for Plk1 centrosome localization. It becomes localized to the centrosome in the late G2 and has peak activity at the G2/M transition. Plk1 is involved in the regulation of various cell cycle checkpoints that ensure the timing and order of cell cycle events, such as DNA repair, bipolar spindle formation, chromosome segregation, and mitotic exit (10Li J.J. Li S.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 2006; 111: 974-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Aurora-A kinase is also implicated in centrosome separation, spindle assembly, and spindle maintenance. Deregulated expression of Aurora-A kinase results in centrosome hypertrophy and leads to cell transformation (10Li J.J. Li S.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 2006; 111: 974-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Both of the two kinases have emerged as the key regulators of centrosome maturation in a variety of different organisms. Nek2A is a centrosomal kinase that participates in spindle-pole separation at the G2/M transition (10Li J.J. Li S.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 2006; 111: 974-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Despite these findings, the machinery that controls centrosome stability and function still remains to be further defined.Ninein-like protein (Nlp), 2The abbreviations used are: Nlp, ninein-like protein; APC, anaphase-promoting complex; APC/c, anaphase-promoting cyclosome complex; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; siRNA, small interfering RNA; Wt, wild type; KEN, Lys-Glu-Asn. 2The abbreviations used are: Nlp, ninein-like protein; APC, anaphase-promoting complex; APC/c, anaphase-promoting cyclosome complex; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; siRNA, small interfering RNA; Wt, wild type; KEN, Lys-Glu-Asn. a newly identified centrosome protein that is phosphorylated by Plk1, locates at chromosome 20. Nlp plays important roles in mitotic progression, including centrosome maturation and formation, bipolar spindles, and chromosome segregation (11Casenghi M. Barr F.A. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5101-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 12Casenghi M. Meraldi P. Weinhart U. Duncan P.I. Korner R. Nigg E.A. Dev.

Biol. 2005; 25: 1309-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Plk1 can phosphorylate Nlp, and the phosphorylation disrupts the ability of Nlp to be associated with γ-tubulin as well as with the centrosome. As Nlp is an important component of the centrosome and essential for stimulating microtubule nucleation, it is proposed that, at the onset of mitosis, Plk1 phosphorylates Nlp and displaces it from the centrosome, thus establishing a condition for assembly of the mitotic spindle (11Casenghi M. Barr F.A. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5101-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Nlp has been shown to cause aberrant spindle formation, suggesting that the precise control of Nlp expression is required for proper centrosome maturation and spindle assembly. Interestingly, our most recent observations indicate that Nlp is deregulated in several types of human cancers and is able to promote cell transformation and tumor formation in nude mice. 3Y. Wang and Q. Zhan, unpublished data. 3Y. Wang and Q. Zhan, unpublished data. These findings suggest that the machinery controlling Nlp protein is important for maintaining cell cycle progression and genomic stability in mammalian cells, and disruption of such machinery would lead to tumorigenesis. However, the mechanism(s) that regulates Nlp protein expression is currently unclear.The mechanism that controls mitosis is complex. The biological events that occur during late mitosis, from sister chromosome separation to exit from mitosis, are primarily governed by the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of key regulatory proteins. This ubiquitylation is mediated by the ubiquitin ligase, anaphase-promoting complex (APC) (14Zachariae W. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2039-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Activation of the APC requires its association with tryplophan-aspartate-containing proteins. Two of these activators have been identified as Cdc20 and Cdh1 (15Lorca T. Castro A. Martinez A.M. Vigneron S. Morin N. Sigrist S. Lehner C. Doree M. Labbe J.C. EMBO. J. 1998; 17: 3565-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 16Sigrist S.J. Lehner C.F. Cell. 1997; 90: 671-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Although destruction of APC targets at the metaphase-anaphase transition is regulated by Cdc20, APC-dependent degradation during late mitosis and early G1 is controlled by Cdh1 (17Pfleger C.M. Kirschner M.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 655-665PubMed Google Scholar, 18Visintin R. Prinz S. Amon A. Science. 1997; 278: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The switch from Cdc20 to Cdh1 is induced by the inactivation of Cdk1, which in turn leads to destruction of Cdc20 itself by the Cdh1 (19Hagting A. Den Elzen N. Vodermaier H.C. Waizenegger I.C. Peters J.M. Pines J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1125-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 20Raff J.W. Jeffers K. Huang J.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1139-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The Cdc20 and Cdh1 forms of the APC present different substrate specificities. Cdc20 recognizes D-Box-containing proteins (21Fang G. Yu H. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar); meanwhile, Cdh1 recognizes proteins containing either D-Box or KEN-box sequences (17Pfleger C.M. Kirschner M.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 655-665PubMed Google Scholar). The destruction box sequences appear to be quite variable except for the RXXLXXXXN. Mutations in the destruction box and KEN-box stabilize substrates and severely reduce or abolish their ubiquitination.In this report, we have shown that Nlp is expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner and degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway via the APC/c. Nlp is physically associated with the APC/c through the APC2 or Cdc27 subunits and capable of binding in vivo to Cdh1 or Cdc20. A reduction of the Cdh1 and Cdc20 protein levels by RNA interference leads to stabilization of Nlp. We have also characterized the KEN-box and D-box sequences in Nlp as the important determinants of NLP degradation. Mutations of these boxes greatly enhance Nlp protein stability and its capability of inducing anchorage-independent growth and multinuclearity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Cultures and Synchronization Procedures—KYSE150 cells and HeLa cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide. 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. To synchronize cells at G2/M phase, cells were treated with 400 ng/ml nocodazole (Sigma) for 16 h. To release the cells from drug-induced G2/M phase arrest, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and switched into fresh medium for further incubation and collected every 2 h. For G0 arrest, exponentially growing cells were kept in 10% serum-containing medium for 24 h after they reached confluence and then were serum-starved (0.5% fetal calf serum) for 48 h. Thereafter, the cells were released into serum-containing medium and collected every 2 h. For cells arrested at the G1/S boundary, the cells were incubated with aphidicolin (6 mm, Sigma) for 14 h and then switched into fresh medium and collected every 2 h.Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from diversely treated KYSE-150 cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (6 μg) was reverse-transcribed as described in the instructions (Invitrogen). One microliter of cDNA solution, which is fifteen microliters in all, was then used as the template for PCR amplification. Sequences of the reverse transcription-PCR primers for Nlp were: forward, 5′-TGGAGCAGCTCACGGAGA-3′; reverse, 5′-CATCGTTGCGGTCCTGCA-3′. The product is 399 bp in length. GAPDH were: forward, 5′-GCTGAGAACGGGAAGCTTGT-3′; reverse, 5′-GCCAGGGGTGCTAAGCAG-3′. The product is 299 bp in length.Protein Stability Experiments—To determine the half-life of Nlp, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) (Sigma) was added to the cell culture to inhibit protein synthesis, and cells were harvested in PBS containing 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% Nonidet P-40 (lysis buffer) at the indicated time intervals. To determine the effects of proteasome inhibitors on Nlp protein stability, the cells were preincubated with 20 μm MG132 (benzyloxy-carbonyl-Leu-Leu-Leu-aldehyde) for different times or with different concentrations of MG132 before the addition of cycloheximide. For each experiment, a corresponding volume of the vehicle dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) was added as control.Cell Extraction, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—Cells were harvested, rinsed with PBS, and lysed in lysis buffer (composition given above). The lysates were collected by scraping and cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C. 100 μg of cellular protein were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Protran membranes. The immunoblotting method was performed as described previously (4Shao S. Wang Y. Jin S. Song Y. Wang X. Fan W. Zhao Z. Fu M. Tong T. Dong L. Fan F. Xu N. Zhan Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28943-28950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, cellular lysates were first incubated with 10 μl of the indicated antibodies for 2 h at room temperature and further incubated overnight at 4 °C after the addition of 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To pull down the immunocomplexes, the immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was performed as described above. The following antibodies were used in this study. Nlp antibody was made by BioSource (Camarillo, CA). This polyclonal antibody was demonstrated to specifically hybridize against human KIAA0980 protein. Antibodies against actin, APC2, Cdc27, Cdc20, GFP, β-tubulin, cyclin A, B1, D1, and E were commercially provided by Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies against ubiquitin (Cdh1) were commercially provided by Sigma.In Vivo Ubiquitination Assay—Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, treated with 20 μm MG132 or a corresponding volume of the vehicle Me2SO, and lysed on ice with lysis buffer. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 revolutions/min for 15 min. Five hundred micrograms of total cellular protein was used for each immunoprecipitation reaction with 15 μg of antibodies to actin or Nlp. The immunocomplexes were pulled down as described previously (4Shao S. Wang Y. Jin S. Song Y. Wang X. Fan W. Zhao Z. Fu M. Tong T. Dong L. Fan F. Xu N. Zhan Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28943-28950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and resolved by SDS-PAGE using a 10% gel and probed for the presence of polyubiquitin-Nlp protein complex using anti-ubiquitin antibody.Plasmid Constructions, Mutagenesis, and Cell Transfection—pEGFP-Nlp was made by inserting human Nlp cDNA into SalI and SmaI sites of the pEGFP-C3 vector. The construct expresses green fluorescent proteins (GFPs). PCS2-Cdc20 and pCS2-Cdh1 were constructed by inserting the corresponding Human cDNAs into the Fsd/Asd sites of pCS2 vector, respectively (a gift from Prof. Guowei Fang, Stanford University). Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Nlp deletions were made by cloning different lengths of Nlp cDNA into BamHI and NotI sites of the pGEX-5X-1 vector. To identify the sequences that potentially constitute degradation signals for Nlp, we generated a site-directed mutation construct. There are one putative D-box with a RXXLXXXXN motif and a KEN-box within the N-terminal domain of Nlp. KEN-D-box-mutated Nlp was generated using site-directed mutagenesis as previously described (22Nguyen H.G. Chinnappan D. Urano T. Ravid K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4977-4992Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Briefly, PCR primers were as follows: sense F1, 5′-CTGCTAGTCGACGGATGAAGAAGAGAACCACTATGTC-3′; F2, 5′-GGCCCTGGCGGCAGCCAGTCGCCTACAGAAGGAGATTG-3′; F3, 5′-AAGACCTCGCGACCCAGGCGGAGACCAAGG-3′; antisense R1, 5′-CTGTAGGCGACTGGCTGCCGCCAGGGCCAGGGTCAGCTTCTCGCGGAG-3′; R2, 5′-TACCTTGGTCTCCGCCTGGGTCGCGAGGTCTTGGTAATGC-3′; R3, 5′-CACATCTGGGCGCGCTTCTCGCTCGCACAGGGCTGCAGCTTCAGTGCCC-3′. KEN-box and D-box were specifically changed with the consensus sequence KEN to AAA and RXXL to AAAA, respectively. The resulting PCR product was inserted into BsrGI/Sal sites of pEGFP-Nlp vector, which had been digested by these two enzymes before-hand. The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Invitrogen).For cell transfection, 5 × 105 293T cells were seeded onto 35-mm plates 1 day prior to transfection. In each plate, 5 μg of plasmid DNA and 15 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) were added to 500 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) in separate tubes. The solutions were mixed gently, allowed to sit for 20 min at room temperature, diluted with 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and added to the plates for 6 h at 37 °C. Equal volumes of medium with 10% fetal bovine serum were added, and plates were incubated overnight. Fresh medium was added the following day, and cells were harvested 48 h later.GST Preparations—GST fusion protein expression was performed as follows. Escherichia coli were treated with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for GST protein induction. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation, and bacterial pellets were resuspended in cold STE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl). After incubation with lysozyme (100 μg/ml), bacteria were treated with dithiothreitol (10 mm) and sarkosyl (0.7%) and subjected to sonication. Following centrifugation, supernatants were treated with Triton X-100 at a final concentration of 2%. Next, the glutathione-agarose beads were mixed with supernatant solution at 4 °C overnight. After washing several times with PBS, glutathione-agarose bead-conjugated GST fusion proteins were ready for use in the designed experiments.Soft Agar Colony Formation Assay and Colony Formation Assay—293T cells were transfected as described above with an empty vector carrying GFP, wild type Nlp (GFP-tagged), or KEN-D-box-mutated Nlp (GFP-tagged). 48 h later, the cells were seeded in soft agar as described previously (22Nguyen H.G. Chinnappan D. Urano T. Ravid K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4977-4992Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).For colony formation assay, cells were plated (200 cells/well) in 35-mm plates. After 12–14 days of culture, the colonies were exposed to staining solution containing 0.25% crystal violet, washed with water, and counted. Plating efficiency was determined as the fraction of cells that attached to the support and grew into colonies larger than 1 mm in diameter. All experiments were repeated at least twice, and similar results were obtained in each trial.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—293T cells were seeded onto glass coverslips in a 6-well plate. Cells in each well were transfected with pEGFP-Nlp-Wt or pEGFP-Nlp-mutant, respectively. 96 h later, the cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and washed with PBS. The cells were treated with cold methanol at -20 °C followed by 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. After incubation with antibody to β-tubulin, plates were washed and incubated with TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. DNA was stained with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (SIGMA). Following washing with PBS, cells were visualized using an Olympus fluorescence microscope, and photographs were generated using a Kodak digital camera.RESULTSCell Cycle-dependent Expression of Nlp—To investigate whether Nlp expression is associated with cell cycle progression, we first employed the approach of cell cycle synchronization to examine the protein level of Nlp. KYSE150 cells were arrested at the G0 phase by serum starvation and released into the cell cycle synchronously. Following release, whole-cell extracts were prepared every 2 h, and Nlp protein levels were analyzed by Western blotting assays (Fig. 1A). To dissect the cell cycle progression, analyses of cyclin D1, E, A, and B1 were included. As shown in Fig. 1A, Nlp exhibited extremely low levels at the first 14 h but started to accumulate at the time point of 16 h and peaked at the points of 20–22 h post-release. According to the expression patterns of cyclins, Nlp expression appeared to be cell cycle-dependent. It started to express an abundant level at the late S phase and peaked at the mitotic phase. When cells moved out of mitotic phase and entered G1, Nlp levels decreased to a very low level (Fig. 1A). Notably, Nlp levels behaved similarly to that of cyclin B1 (Fig. 1A), one known mitotic substrate of APC/c. To further confirm the cell cycle-dependent expression of Nlp, we next synchronized KYSE150 cells at the G1/S boundary using aphidicolin, a DNA polymerase inhibitor. This approach would allow cells to synchronously enter S phase. Similarly, Nlp displayed high abundant levels as cells entered G2/M transition but began to decrease when cells completed mitosis and entered G1 phase (Fig. 1B). We also examined the levels of NLP mRNA, and it did not show a significant change with the cell cycle progression (Fig. 1C). Further experiments were performed using nocodazole (a microtubule inhibitor) to synchronize cells at mitotic phase, and we got the similar results to Fig. 1, A and B (Fig. 1D). It should be noted here that the same patterns of Nlp expression were observed in other human cell lines, including HeLa and U2OS (results not shown). Taken together, these observations indicate that Nlp protein expression was done in a cell cycle-dependent manner.Nlp Protein Stability Is Regulated by Anaphase-promoting Complex—Considering that the pattern of Nlp expression mimics those of other mitotic proteins, Nlp is predicted to have a short half-life. The half-life of Nlp was then determined in KYSE150 cells treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX. After 6 h of post-treatment with cycloheximide, Nlp protein was reduced by >50% compared with that seen in untreated control cells (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that Nlp is a fast turnover protein and has a short half-life.FIGURE 2Nlp has a short half-life and accumulates in the presence of proteasome inhibitors. A, KYSE150 cells were treated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide and collected at the indicated times for Western blotting analysis. Proteins (100 μg/lane) were loaded onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a filter, and incubated with anti-Nlp antibody. The β-actin level was also blotted for a loading control. B, to quantitatively evaluate the half-life of Nlp, its protein level, as determined by Western blotting, was normalized to the β-actin level in three independent experiments. C and D, KYSE150 cells were treated for different lengths of time with a proteasome inhibitor MG132 (20 μm) or different concentrations with MG132. The cells were lysed and subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-Nlp and β-actin antibodies. Results shown are representatives of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The APC/c E3 ligase, through its ability to tag specific proteins with polyubiquitin for targeted degradation, is believed to globally direct the progression of mitosis (23de Gramont A. Ganier O. Cohen-Fix O. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2168-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 24Fry A.M. Yamano H. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 1487-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Because Nlp accumulates in G2/M phases, which is similar to APC/c-regulated substrates, it was suspected that Nlp degradation might involve in the APC/c ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Therefore, KYSE150 cells were treated with cycloheximide in the presence of MG132, a selective inhibitor of the proteasome and followed by the analysis of Nlp protein levels. Apparently, the addition of MG132 resulted in an increased Nlp level (Fig. 2, C and D). This strongly suggests that degradation of Nlp is mediated by the APC ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. To further prove this, immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-Nlp antibody were utilized and followed by immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin antibody. To our expectation, the ubiquitin was observed in the Nlp immunocomplex, and its amount was substantially increased in the presence of MG132 (Fig. 3A). Additionally, Nlp interactions with the APC/c subunits APC2 or Cdc27 were also examined (Fig. 3, B and C). Clearly, Nlp antibody was able to immunoprecipitate APC2 or Cdc27, and more abundant APC2 was detected in Nlp immunocomplex when cells were treated with nocodazole (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, we could also detect Cdc27 in Nlp complex when cells were treated with aphidicolin. It implied that Nlp began to decrease from anaphase till early G1 phase (Fig. 3C). Vise versa, Nlp protein were immunoprecipitated by APC2 or Cdc27 antibodies. Collectively, these results indicate that Nlp degradation is mediated by the APC/c-ubiquitin pathway.FIGURE 3Nlp is ubiquitinated and capable of binding in vivo to the APC component APC2. A, KYSE150 cells were incubated with (+) or without (-) MG132 (20 μm) for 12 h, lysed, and collected for immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-Nlp antibody or with anti-actin as a control. Equal amounts of immunoprotein complex were loaded and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Polyubiquitinated Nlp appears in multiple forms with a molecular mass range >156 kDa. The presence of Nlp in the immunocomplex was further verified by blotting the same membrane with anti-Nlp antibody, as shown in the lower panel. B, to test whether Nlp can bind directly to the APC/c, KYSE150 cells were arrested at M phase with nocodazole (400 ng/ml) for 16 h, lysed, and subjected to IP with anti-APC2 or anti-Nlp antibodies. IP with anti-actin antibody was also performed as a negative control. The same blot was reprobed with anti-APC2 to show the efficiency of APC2 immunoprecipitation. The data shown are representative of two experiments. The Nlp-APC2 immunocomplex was present in synchronized mitotic cells but was less in asynchronized cells, as examined by Western blotting and reaction with anti-Nlp.C, to further test whether Nlp can bind to the APC/c directly, we also arrested KYSE150 cells at the G1/S boundary with aphidicolin for 14 h and lysed and subjected them to IP with anti-Cdc27 or anti-Nlp antibodies. The data shown are representative of two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cdh1 or Cdc20 Can Stimulate Nlp Degradation—It has been demonstrated that Cdc20 (Fizzy in Drosophila) and a related protein Cdh1 (Fizzy-related in Drosophila) activate APC through giving temporal control and substrate specificity to the APC/c E3 ligase (25Eytan E.

https://openalex.org/W2057941607,"The serine proteinase inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), binds to the adhesion protein vitronectin with high affinity at a site that is located directly adjacent to the vitronectin RGD integrin binding sequence. The binding of PAI-1 to vitronectin sterically blocks integrin access to this site and completely inhibits the binding of purified integrins to vitronectin; however, its inhibition of endothelial and smooth muscle cell adhesion to vitronectin is at most 50-75%. Because PAI-1 binds vitronectin with ∼10-100-fold higher affinity than purified integrins, we have analyzed the mechanism whereby these cells are able to overcome this obstacle. Our studies exclude proteolytic removal of PAI-1 from vitronectin as the mechanism, and show instead that cell adhesion in the presence of PAI-1 is dependent on integrin-cytoskeleton engagement. Disrupting endothelial or smooth muscle cell actin polymerization and/or focal adhesion assembly reduces cell adhesion to vitronectin in the presence of PAI-1 to levels similar to that observed for the binding of purified integrins to vitronectin. Furthermore, endothelial cell, but not smooth muscle cell adhesion to vitronectin in the presence of PAI-1 requires both polymerized microtubules and actin, further demonstrating the importance of the cytoskeleton for integrin-mediated adhesion. Finally, we show that cell adhesion in the presence of PAI-1 leads to colocalization of PAI-1 with the integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5 at the cell-matrix interface.

Finally, we show that cell adhesion in the presence of PAI-1 leads to colocalization of PAI-1 with the integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5 at the cell-matrix interface. Cell adhesion receptors play important roles in maintaining cell anchorage and polarity in addition to promoting migration and differentiation. Many of the known adhesion receptors belong to the integrin family of noncovalent heterodimeric transmembrane proteins that are expressed by most cell types. The integrin family consists of at least 18 α- and 8 β-subunits that combine to form as many as 24 different αβ dimers (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6955) Google Scholar). The extracellular domains of both integrin subunits are required for binding to adhesion proteins. In addition, integrins need physiological concentrations of divalent cations such as calcium or magnesium. Integrins have relatively short cytoplasmic tails that interact with an intracellular protein complex, termed focal contacts, which include adaptor proteins and kinases. The focal contacts control the linkage between the cytoskeleton and integrins and mediate intracellular signaling. Integrins direct forces generated by the cytoskeleton onto the extracellular matrix (ECM) 2The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; PA, plasminogen activator; EC, endothelial cells; SMC, smooth muscle cells; BSA, bovine serum albumin; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; CD, cytochalasin-D; PAO, phenylarsine oxide. to produce the traction necessary for cell adhesion and migration (2Ridley A.J.

Understanding the mechanism and control of integrin-mediated cell adhesion and migration is of special interest because of their importance in processes such as wound healing and angiogenesis as well as pathologies associated with these processes. In general, integrins recognize short linear peptide sequences on adhesion proteins, the most prevalent being arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD), which is found in many ECM proteins such as fibronectin, collagens, and vitronectin (3Ruoslahti E. Pierschbacher M.D. Cell. 1986; 44: 517-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Although many integrins require additional sequences for effective adhesion, the vitronectin receptor integrins αvβ3, and to some extent αvβ5, are fairly unique in their ability to bind most proteins with a simple RGD sequence, including non-ECM proteins such as thrombin and transforming growth factor β1-latency-associated protein (LAP) (4Bar-Shavit R.

Horgan C.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These integrins have been the subject of intense study because their expression is up-regulated by migratory cells and their activities have been linked to pathological processes, such as tumor metastasis (6Friedlander M. Brooks P.C. Shaffer R.W. Kincaid C.M. Varner J.A. Cheresh D.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1500-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). The specificities of αvβ3 and αvβ5 are not limited to vitronectin; however, this interaction is of special interest because vitronectin can accelerate the migration of vascular cells such as smooth muscle cells as compared with many other adhesion proteins (7Clyman R.I. Mauray F. Kramer R.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 272-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 8Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Vitronectin is a 75-kDa plasma glycoprotein that plays a role in regulating blood coagulation, complement action, fibrinolysis, and wound healing. Initially vitronectin was called “serum spreading protein,” because it was identified as the primary factor responsible for adhesion and spreading of many cell types grown in tissue culture. Besides being an abundant plasma protein (0.2-0.3 mg/ml), it is also found in the extravascular ECM, particularly at sites of injury or remodeling and it specifically associates with fibrin clots (9Podor T.J. Campbell S. Chindemi P. Foulon D.M. Farrell D.H. Walton P.D. Weitz J.I. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7520-7528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In circulation vitronectin is in a closed conformation and does not interact with integrins, however, upon binding to a surface such as collagens at sites of vascular injury, vitronectin undergoes a conformational change that exposes the RGD integrin binding site as well as a high affinity binding site for PAI-1 (10Seiffert D. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13705-13710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). PAI-1 is a 50-kDa proteinase inhibitor found mostly in platelet α-granules. It is released upon platelet activation at sites of vascular injury resulting in local concentrations that can be high relative to normal plasma levels. PAI-1 is a member of the serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) superfamily, and is the main inhibitor in vivo of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and tissue-type plasminogen activator. Unlike most serpins, the active conformation of PAI-1 is unstable and converts to an inactive latent conformation with a half-life of ∼1 h under physiological conditions. Vitronectin binds PAI-1 with high affinity (Kd ∼ 1 nm) and stabilizes its active conformation but does not affect the ability of PAI-1 to inhibit plasminogen activators (PAs). Likewise, PAI-1 influences the activity of vitronectin by blocking the RGD integrin binding site, which can influence cellular adhesion and migration in vitro and in vivo (8Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 11McMahon G.A. Petitclerc E. Stefansson S. Smith E. Wong M.K. Westrick R.J. Ginsburg D. Brooks P.C. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33964-33968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Importantly, the high affinity PAI-1h as for vitronectin is lost upon its reaction with a proteinase such as uPA (12Stefansson S. Muhammad S. Cheng X.F. Battey F.D. Strickland D.K. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6358-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The PAI-1 binding site on vitronectin has been localized to the N-terminal somatomedin-B domain, which is adjacent to the RGD sequence. Although the RGD and the PAI-1 binding sites are thought to be functionally independent, their close proximity results in apparent competition between PAI-1 and purified integrins in solid phase binding assays. The reported IC50 value for PAI-1 inhibition of integrin binding to vitronectin is ∼1 nm, which is close to its Kd for vitronectin. The efficient inhibition by PAI-1 is not surprising given that affinity of purified αvβ3 for RGD containing ligands has been reported to be on the order of 10-100 nm (13Hu D.D. Hoyer J.R. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9917-9925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 14Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). However, in this study we show that significantly higher concentrations of PAI-1 are needed to inhibit cellular integrin binding to vitronectin (IC50 ∼ 20-60 nm) compared with purified integrins, and more importantly, we show that PAI-1 can only maximally inhibit cell adhesion ∼50-75%, whereas it completely blocks purified integrin binding. To analyze this discrepancy between PAI-1 inhibition of purified versus cell-associated integrins, we performed in vitro adhesion studies using endothelial cells (EC), and smooth muscle cells (SMC) together with specific PAI-1 and vitronectin mutants. These data indicate that both the EC and SMC adhere to the vitronectin RGD sequence regardless of whether PAI-1 is present or not, and that adhesion in the presence of PAI-1 requires the association of integrins with the cellular cytoskeleton. We present a model to illustrate this mechanism that suggests that the association of integrins with the cytoskeleton provides the rigidity necessary to “nudge” PAI-1 aside without removing it to gain access to the RGD.

Chelex 100 resin and precast Tris-HCl gels for SDS-PAGE were from Bio-Rad and BD Talon Metal Affinity Resin was from Clontech. Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture was from Roche Applied Science. NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer was from Invitrogen. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Native human vitronectin and RGE mutant vitronectin in pMEL-Bac vectors were a gift from Dr. D. Sane (Wake Forest, NC). Human vitronectin wild type and RGE mature mutant coding sequences were amplified from the pMELBac plasmids. The forward and reverse primers were 5′-CCGGCCGGCCCGCTCGGGGACCAAGAGTCATGC-3′ and 5′-CGGCGGCGCGGGTTTAAACTCATTAATGGTGATGGTGATGATGCAGATGGCCAGGAGC-3′, respectively, with engineered AvaI and PmeI restriction sites following the His6 tag. After amplification, the PCR products were digested with AvaI/PmeI and cloned into the Drosophila Expression System vector pMT/BiP/V5-His C (Invitrogen) under the metallothionein-inducible promoter. The constructs with corresponding sequences were selected by DNA sequencing with pMTBiP forward and reverse primers provided by Invitrogen. Stable transfectants were generated for each Drosophila expression plasmid encoding the vitronectin mutants by co-transfection of S2 cells with a vector carrying the blasticidin resistance gene (pCoBlas, Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Stably transfected cell lines were cultivated at 28 °C in Drosophila serum-free medium supplemented with 20 mm l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, Fungizone, and blasticidin at 25 μg/ml (Invitrogen). Vitronectin expression was induced by adding 0.5 mm CuSO4 (final concentration) to SFM growth medium at a cell density of ∼3.0 × 106 cells/ml and conditioned media was collected on day 5 of induction. The vitronectin mutants were purified from conditioned media, depleted in Cu2+ ions with chelating resin Chelex 100, in one-step affinity chromatography on BD Talon Metal Affinity Resin. Radiolabeling of HMK-PAI-1 with [γ-32P]ATP was performed essentially as described (12Stefansson S. Muhammad S. Cheng X.F. Battey F.D. Strickland D.K. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6358-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Solid Phase Binding Assays—Competition binding assays of PAI-1 and integrins were performed essentially as described (8Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates were coated with native human vitronectin for 1 h at 37 °C in TBS followed by blocking with 1% BSA in TBS. Purified αvβ3 or αvβ5 (100 nm) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% BSA, 0.1% octyl glucoside, and 0.5 μm MnCl2 were allowed to attach to vitronectin in the presence of increasing concentrations of PAI-1 (141b) for 16 h at 4 °C, after which unbound integrins were washed away and the plates incubated with either goat anti-human integrin β3 or β5 antibodies. After washing with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, plates were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat antibody and developed. Adhesion Assays of Endothelial Cells and Smooth Muscle Cells—Adhesion assays were performed using 24-well plates, which were coated with 1 μg/ml of purified human native vitronectin for 1 h at 37 °C, after which unoccupied sites were blocked with 1% BSA in TBS for 1 h at 37 °C or overnight at 4 °C. Endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells were detached using trypsin/EDTA, followed by centrifugation in the presence of ⅓ volume of 10% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to neutralize the trypsin. The cells were resuspended in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% BSA and seeded onto 24-well plates at densities between 103 and 105 cells/well. The cells were allowed to attach and spread for 45-60 min in the presence or absence of PAI-1 mutants and other effectors indicated in the figure legends. After incubation, non-attached or weakly attached cells were removed by three washes with TBS along with vigorous agitation. Firmly attached cells were quantified by measuring intracellular acid phosphatase activity with para-nitrophenyl phosphate as described (17Yang T.T. Sinai P. Kain S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 241: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and plotted as the percentage of acid phosphatase activity compared with the control. The stable PAI-1 mutant 141b (18Berkenpas M.B. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used exclusively unless otherwise indicated. Fluorescent Microscopy of Endothelial Cells and Smooth Muscle Cells—Coverslips were coated with purified vitronectin (1 μg/ml) for 45-60 min at 37 °C and blocked using 1% BSA in TBS for 1 h. EC and SMC were allowed to adhere to the coverslips for 1 h in the presence or absence of PAI-1 (141b stable mutant, unless indicated otherwise) at 37 °C, 5% CO2, after which cells were fixed with 10% formalin and permeabilized with TBS containing 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were stained for actin filaments using rhodamine-labeled phalloidin and focal contacts were stained using anti-paxillin monoclonal antibody followed by rabbit anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568. Integrins and PAI-1 were visualized after cells were allowed to adhere to vitronectin-coated coverslips for 45-60 min as described above. Plates were rinsed with 50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl with 5 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5, followed by cross-linking with 0.4 μg/ml bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate in 50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl with 5 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5, for 15 min at room temperature. After cross-linking, plates were washed with TBS to inactivate bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate and incubated with uPA (0.1 mm in TBS) for 30 min at room temperature in an attempt to remove unreacted PAI-1 from the immobilized vitronectin. Plates were then rinsed with TBS buffer followed by fixation with 10% buffered formalin for 2 min after which plates were washed with TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and proteinase inhibitor mixture. Anti-human PAI-1 and either LM609 or P1F6 (0.1 μg/ml) were added in 0.1% TBS/BSA at room temperature for 1 h followed by washes and addition of secondary antibodies, goat anti-mouse (Alexa Fluor 488) and goat anti-rabbit (Alexa Fluor 568), followed by washing 3 times in 50 mm TBS buffer. Slides were mounted with Prolong Gold medium. For laser scanning confocal microscopy, images were acquired using a Radiance 2100 laser scanning system (Bio-Rad) using the Laser Sharp 2000 version 4.1 software. All confocal images were acquired under the Kalman mode with iterations at a minimum laser power wattage set based on negative control slides. The following settings were used for the experiments: ×100 oil immersion objective lens, 8-bit, 1024 × 1024 pixel resolution at CCD camera, Look-Out Table (LOT) set to green for 488 nm emission and red for 568 nm emission. The dichroic mirrors were set to 560 DCLPXR for green and 650 DCLPXR for red. The emission filters were set to HD515/30 for green and HQ600/40 for red. Finally, laser scanning speed was set to 160 lines/s with sequential recording of two channels. No special effect or filter (i.e. reduce noise, blur, sharpen, etc.) was used. We chose to examine the horizontal z-sections that had the most intense integrin staining (green), which were ∼0.5 μm from the surface of the slide and compared that to PAI-1 staining (red) in the same sections. The analysis of digital images was performed by Volocity (version 2.6.3; Improvision, UK) (19Strachan L.R. Condic M.L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using the colocalization session algorithm that determined the overlapped portion of integrin and PAI-1 staining. The classifier thresholds for each color channel were determined based on corresponding non-immune IgG control slides and the sample areas were subsequently measured. Due to size differences among cells, colocalization areas were determined as the percentage area of the whole cell. Co-precipitation of PAI-1 and Integrins—Culture dishes (100 mm) were coated with vitronectin (1 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C and blocked using 1% BSA in TBS for 1 h. EC and SMC were allowed to adhere to the plates for 1 h in the absence or presence of N-terminal biotinylated 141B-PAI-1 (final concentration 1 μm). The dishes were rinsed twice with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2 followed by cross-linking with 0.4 mm 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2 for 15 min at room temperature. After cross-linking, the buffer was replaced with TBS containing 100 nm uPA for 15 min. Plates were then rinsed with PBS and flash frozen. Cells were lysed in TBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture. Lysates were sheared using a syringe fitted with a 25-gauge needle. Insoluble debris was pelleted by centrifuging lysates for 5 min at 10,000 × g. Biotinylated proteins and conjugates were pulled down using immobilized streptavidin and incubated overnight at 4 °C with end over end rotation. The immobilized protein complexes were pelleted by centrifuging for 2-3 min at 3000 × g. The beads were washed 4 times with TBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS. Proteins were eluted with NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol by boiling the samples for 5 min. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4-20% gradient gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride. Integrin αv was detected with rabbit anti-human αv antiserum and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG. The blots were stripped and reprobed for PAI-1 using sheep anti-human PAI-1 and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG. SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate and film were used for detection. PAI-1 Inhibition of Cellular Integrin Binding to Vitronectin Is Less Efficient than with Purified Integrins—Integrins and the cytoskeleton form a functional unit that provides traction and directionality through controlled assembly and disassembly of cell-ECM contacts (20Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3291) Google Scholar, 21Felsenfeld D.P. Choquet D. Sheetz M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanisms of how adhesion proteins and the cytoskeleton influence integrin function is critical for our understanding of cell migration and we believe that the competition between PAI-1 and integrins for vitronectin binding provides a well defined, simple and physiologically relevant system to examine integrin properties, such as affinity modulation. The PAI-1 binding site on vitronectin has been well studied by site-specific mutations that identified several amino acids in the somatomedin-B domain between residues 4 and 40 as being vital for high affinity PAI-1 binding (22Deng G. Royle G. Wang S. Crain K. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12716-12723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and interestingly all of these residues are conserved across mammalian species (23Stefansson S. McMahon G.A. Petitclerc E. Lawrence D.A. Curr. Pharm. Desi. 2003; 9: 1545-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The RGD sequence in vitronectin is at position 45-47, and because of this proximity, PAI-1 is thought to inhibit the binding of integrins by steric hindrance. The somatomedin-B domain and the RGD function independently, with PAI-1 being unable to block cell adhesion to a vitronectin fragment having the RGD but lacking the somatomedin-B (24Deng G. Curriden S.A. Hu G. Czekay R.P. Loskutoff D.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 189: 23-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, the PAI-1 binding site and the RGD are in close proximity because solid-phase binding assays, such as shown in Fig. 1A, demonstrate competitive binding of PAI-1 and purified integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5 to vitronectin. The IC50 of the PAI-1 inhibition of αvβ3 and αvβ5 was 2.5 and 5 nm, respectively, which is consistent with previous reports on the PAI-1 inhibition of purified αvβ3, αvβ5, and αIIbβ3 binding to vitronectin (8Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 25Kjoller L. Kanse S.M. Kirkegaard T. Rodenburg K.W. Ronne E. Goodman S.L. Preissner K.T. Ossowski L. Andreasen P.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 420-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows that PAI-1 was also a competitive inhibitor of cell adhesion to vitronectin, although it was less efficient, yielding an IC50 of 31 and 60 nm for EC and SMC, respectively. Additionally, whereas PAI-1 inhibition of the purified integrin was competed down to baseline levels (Fig. 1A), the inhibition of cell adhesion to vitronectin was not complete, generally reaching a maximum of around 50-75% inhibition. These data are consistent with earlier studies (26Germer M. Kanse S.M. Kirkegaard T. Kjoller L. Felding-Habermann B. Goodman S. Preissner K.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 669-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), showing that a 10-fold higher concentration of active PAI-1 is required to inhibit ∼50% of HEp-2 cells adhesion to vitronectin in comparison to purified integrins. These results demonstrate that PAI-1 inhibition of cellular adhesion to vitronectin conflict with the results using purified integrins. To examine whether cell adhesion occurs through a mechanism that is not affected by PAI-1 we analyzed the morphology of EC and SMC, with respect to their intracellular adhesion machinery and effects of specific inhibitors. Shown in Fig. 2A are representative fields of EC and SMC that adhered either to vitronectin alone or to vitronectin in the presence of increasing concentrations of PAI-1 and stained for paxillin. In the absence of PAI-1, the cells demonstrated punctate paxillin staining, characteristic of organized focal contacts that were mostly observed in extended podia. In the presence of 0.1 μm PAI-1, the cell to surface contact area, or “footprint,” of both EC and SMC was substantially reduced, which could be due to a decrease in available vitronectin binding sites. Although the cell footprints were retracted, paxillin staining still displayed a punctate pattern indicating that focal contacts remained organized. At 1 μm PAI-1 the vitronectin-adhering cells were retracted further, and the paxillin staining, although still punctate, was mostly observed in short podia extending from a very compact cell body, demonstrating that although focal contacts were less intense they were still present. Because punctate paxillin staining is indicative of integrin-mediated clustering and cell adhesion, (27Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Pankov R. Yamada K.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar, 28Webb D.J. Donais K. Whitmore L.A. Thomas S.M. Turner C.E. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar) we conclude that the EC and SMC were adhering to the vitronectin via integrins, despite the presence of PAI-1. Confocal analysis of the cells stained with TRITC-phalloidin showed that with increasing concentrations of PAI-1, cells adopted vertical and elongated structures with progressively smaller footprints. Although the cells appeared distressed, they did not undergo apoptosis associated with loss of cell anchorage because they were viable and did not show nuclear fragmentation as evaluated by Hoechst staining and, furthermore, returned to normal morphology if PAI-1 was removed from vitronectin with mild elastase treatment (data not shown). Because paxillin and other proteins comprising the focal contacts serve as anchoring points for the organization and assembly of the actin cytoskeleton, we examined staining of polymerized actin in EC and SMC. Fig. 2B shows representative images of TRITC-phalloidin staining of EC and SMC that adhered to vitronectin either alone or in the presence of 0.1 or 1 μm PAI-1. Fig. 2B shows that both cell types formed organized actin filaments when allowed to adhere and sprea"
https://openalex.org/W2032356108,"The histone H3 amino-terminal tails play an important role in regulating chromatin transcription. Although the mechanisms by which the H3 tail modulates transcription are not well understood, recent discoveries of specific interactions of regulatory factors with H3 tails suggest that H3 tails are a key player in the precise regulation of transcription activity. To investigate the recruitment-based action of H3 tails in chromatin transcription, we purified H3 tail-associated proteins from HeLa cells that stably express epitope-tagged H3 tails. This approach resulted in the identification of multiple histone methyltransferase activities and transcription regulatory factors that are specifically associated with expressed H3 tail domains. Point mutations of Lys-9 and Lys-27 to block cellular modifications of the tail domains completely abolished the association of specific factors, including HP1 and several repressors. Importantly, our transcription analysis revealed that the purified factors can significantly stimulate p300-mediated transcription from chromatin templates. These results implicate that the H3 tail, when accessible in relaxed chromatin, acts as a transcriptional regulator by mediating recruitment of specific sets of cofactors."

Maturation initiates with cleavages of a small proportion of molecules within the central region of the prosegment, possibly by intramolecular events. However, activation to fully mature enzymes is achieved by a precise intermolecular cleavage at a Leu-12-Ser-11↓His-10 sequence within the nonconserved C-terminal region of the prosegment. The importance of this cleavage site in enzyme activation was demonstrated using an active site variant FheproCL1Gly26 (Cys26 to Gly26) and a double variant FheproCL1Pro-12/Gly26 (Leu-12 to Pro-12), and although both of these variants cannot autocatalytically process, the former is susceptible to trans-processing at a Leu-12-Ser-11↓His-10 sequence by pre-activated FheCL1, but the latter is not. Another F. hepatica secreted protease FheCL2, which, unlike FheCL1, can readily accept proline in the S2 subsite of its active site, can trans-process the double variant FheproCL1Pro-12/Gly26 by cleavage at the Pro-12-Ser-11↓His-10 sequence. Furthermore, the autoactivation of a variant enzyme with a single replacement, FheproCL1Pro-12, was very slow but was increased 40-fold in the presence of FheCL2.

CABI Publishers, Wallingford, Oxon, UK1999: 1-29Google Scholar). Virulence is associated with the secretion of a variety of proteins, the most predominant of which are cathepsin L proteases. The cathepsin L proteases are synthesized by epithelial cells that line the parasite gut and are stored as inactive zymogens in specialized secretory vesicles prior to extrusion into the parasite gut lumen (2.Collins P.R. Stack C.N. O'Neill S.M. Doyle S. Ryan T. Brennan G.P. Mousley A. Stewart M. Maule A.G. Dalton J.P. Donnelly S. J. Biol.

Here the proteases mix with blood derived from the host and catabolize proteins to peptides and amino acids that are absorbed and used as nutrient by the parasite (3.Dalton J.P. Skelly P. Halton D.W. Can. J. Zool. 2004; 82: 211-232Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The cathepsin L proteases are also secreted into the tissues of the host where they modulate the reaction of the host to the parasite by suppressing the elaboration of protective Th1-driven immune responses via a mechanism that, albeit unknown, is dependent on enzyme activity (4.Brady M.T.

The F. hepatica cathepsin Ls are orthologous to the mammalian cathepsin Ls, and like these and other members of the papain superfamily, their zymogens possess an N-terminal extension or prosegment.

Because enzyme activation proceeds quicker than proteolytic processing, it was suggested that enzyme maturation occurs in two steps as follows: the activation of the proenzyme followed by enzymatic cleavages within the prosegments to give rise to a mature enzyme (15.Menard R.

The initial “trigger” that initiates activation still remains elusive (15.Menard R. Carmona E. Takebe S. Dufour E. Plouffe C. Mason P. Mort J.S. J. Biol.

Subsequent removal of the prosegment involves possible intramolecular and/or intermolecular cleavages that take place within the central portion of the prosegment and then at the C-terminal region of the prosegment close to the N terminus of the mature enzyme (9.Coulombe R.

The C-terminal parts of cathepsin prosegments (∼20 residues) do not make significant contact with the mature enzyme, and removal of these C-terminal residues from free prosegments has no effect on their binding kinetics to their cognate enzymes (9.Coulombe R.

As a consequence of this lack of structural stability, within the papain superfamily, the C-terminal part of prosegments show little or no conservation (9.Coulombe R. Grochulski P. Sivaraman J. Ménard R. Mort J.S. Cygler M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5492-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). We have investigated the molecular events involved in the activation of the F. hepatica procathepsin L1 (FheproCL1). 5The abbreviations used are: FheproCL1, F. hepatica procathepsin L1; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; NHMec, 4-methylcourmarinyl-7-amide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. Autocatalytic processing of FheproCL1 to a fully active mature enzyme (FheCL1) occurs most quickly at low pH, which is relevant to the digestive function of the enzymes in the slightly acid environment of the parasite gut, but can also occur at physiological pH. Our studies suggest that the initial events in the zymogen activation process involve the generation of a small proportion of catalytically active molecules by cleavages, possibly intramolecular, in the central portion of the prosegment. Further processing occurs by a precise cleavage at the Leu-12-Ser-11↓His-10 sequence within the C terminus of the prosegment that gives rise to a fully active mature enzyme with several prosegment amino acids still attached. We show that an active site variant, FheproCL1Gly26, that cannot autoactivate is susceptible to trans-processing with pre-activated wild-type FheCL1, but the double variant, FheproCL1Gly26/Pro-12, is resistant. However, a second F. hepatica protease, FheCL2, that, unlike FheCL1, can readily accept proline in the S2 subsite of its active site can trans-process the FheproCL1Gly26/Pro-12 by cleaving within the new Pro-12-Ser-11↓His-10 sequence. The single cathepsin L mutant, FheproCL1Pro-12, exhibits a very low rate of activation that is increased 40-fold following addition of FheCL2. These studies reveal the critical importance of the Leu-12-Ser-11↓His-10 sequence in regulating the activation of the major secreted protease of the helminth pathogen F. hepatica. Transformation and Expression of F. hepatica Procathepsin L and Variants in Pichia pastoris−The F. hepatica procathepsin L (FheproCL1) was amplified by PCR from the pAAH5 Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression vector into which the full-length cDNA had been cloned previously (36.Roche L. Dowd A.J. Tort J. McGonigle S. McSweeney A. Curley G.P. Ryan T. Dalton J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 37.Dowd A.J. McGonigle S. Dalton J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 38.Dowd A.J. Tort J. Roche L. Ryan T. Dalton J.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 88: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Primers were used (see primers A and D below) to incorporate an SnaBI restriction site at the 5′ end of the gene and an AvrII restriction site and His6 tag sequence at the 3′ end. The 980-bp fragment was inserted into the AvrII/SnaBI site of P. pastoris expression vector pPIC9K (Invitrogen). From the pPIC9K-FheproCL1 DNA template an active site mutant was prepared by replacing Cys26 with a glycine using the PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis method of gene splicing by overlap extension (SOEing) (39.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The primers used were as follows: primer A, 5′-GCGGCTACGTATCGAATGATGATTTGTGGCAT-3′; primer B, 5′-GAATGCCCAACCGGAGCCAC-3′; primer C, 5′-GTGGCTCCGGTTGGGCATTC-3′; and primer D, 5′-GCGCCTAGGTCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGGCCC-3′ The underlined nucleotides indicate the replacements introduced. Each reaction used one flanking primer that hybridized at one end of the target sequence (primer A or D) and one overlapping internal primer that hybridized at the site of the mutation and contained the mismatched base (primer B or C). In the first round of amplification, two sections of the cDNA were amplified using primer combinations A + B and C + D. These two PCR products, with an overlap of 21 bp at one end of each fragment, were then combined in a second PCR to amplify the entire FheproCL1Gly26 cDNA. Primers for this reaction were the two outside primers used in each of the two first round reactions (primers A and D). High Fidelity Advantage Taq polymerase (Clontech) was used in all PCRs (25 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min). The FheproCL1 cDNA and the variant FheproCL1Gly26 were inserted into the AvrII/SnaBI site of expression vector pPIC9K. The plasmids were linearized by digestion with SalI and introduced to P. pastoris GSII5 cells by spheroplasting (40.Higgins D.R. Cregg J.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 103: 1-15PubMed Google Scholar). Both FheproCL1 and FheproCL1Gly26 plasmid inserts were sequenced to verify the sequence and substitutions. Screening of Transformed Yeast and Identification of Variants−Yeast transformants were replica-plated onto yeast/peptone/dextrose medium plates and grown overnight. Transformants were lifted onto nitrocellulose filters (0.45 μm, Sartorius) by laying the filters on top of the colonies, and those secreting enzyme were identified by colony blotting as described (41.Linder S. Schliwa M. Kube-Granderath E. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 980-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Yeast transformants were cultured in 50 ml of buffered glycerol-complex medium; protein expression was induced with 1% methanol in buffered methanol-complex medium, and samples of culture supernatants were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE to verification of protein secretion (2.Collins P.R. Stack C.N. O'Neill S.M. Doyle S. Ryan T. Brennan G.P. Mousley A. Stewart M. Maule A.G. Dalton J.P. Donnelly S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17038-17046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). During the screening of yeast clones for the Cys26 to Gly26 variant, another procathepsin L variant was identified by its noticeably slower migration in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The DNA encoding this proenzyme was sequenced and shown to have, in addition to the Cys26 to Gly26 replacement, a proline substituted for a leucine residue at position -12 in the prosegment (cathepsin L1 numbering), and this clone was termed FheproCL1Pro-12/Gly26. Because this clone became of interest for this study, a variant containing an unchanged active site Cys26 but with the single Leu-12 to Pro-12 substitution was constructed using a similar procedure as described above and termed FheproCL1Pro-12. Purification of Recombinant Proteases−Upscale production and isolation of recombinant proteases were performed essentially as described by Collins et al. (2.Collins P.R. Stack C.N. O'Neill S.M. Doyle S. Ryan T. Brennan G.P. Mousley A. Stewart M. Maule A.G. Dalton J.P. Donnelly S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17038-17046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) with the following important modifications: yeast transformants were cultured in 1 liter of buffered glycerol-complex medium, buffered to pH 8.0, in 5-liter baffled flasks at 30 °C until an A600 of 2-6 was reached. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, and protein expression was induced by resuspending the cells in 200 ml of buffered methanol-complex medium, buffered at pH 8.0, containing 1% methanol (38.Dowd A.J. Tort J. Roche L. Ryan T. Dalton J.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 88: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The cultures were grown at 30 °C with shaking at 225 rpm for 12 h. Because the pH of the medium drops slowly over this period, it was readjusted with 0.1 m NaOH every3htopH 8.0. Recombinant proteins were purified from yeast medium by affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) as described by Collins et al. (2.Collins P.R. Stack C.N. O'Neill S.M. Doyle S. Ryan T. Brennan G.P. Mousley A. Stewart M. Maule A.G. Dalton J.P. Donnelly S. J. Biol.

However, bound proteins were eluted using 10 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 300 mm NaCl and 250 mm imidazole, and collected into tubes containing 5 ml of 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, before being dialyzed into PBS, pH 7.3. Samples were stored at -80 °C for long term or at 4 °C for up to a week during experimentations. Samples of purified recombinants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue R staining. Autocatalytic Processing and Activation and trans-Processing of Recombinant Proteases−Auto-processing and activation of purified recombinants enzymes (100 μgin50 μl) was performed by adding these to activation buffer (0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, or PBS, pH 7.3, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 1.25 mm EDTA) at a sample to buffer ratio of 1:9 and incubating the mixture at 37 °C. Aliquots of 15 μl (3 μg) were taken at various time points and transferred into tubes containing 1 μl of 1 mm E-64 to halt the reaction. Proteolytic cleavage of the prosegment was visualized by 12% SDS-PAGE. To correlate the proteolytic cleavage events that occur during enzyme activation with the emergence of functionally active mature recombinant FheCL1, the proenzyme was autoactivated at pH 4.5, and aliquots were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen at time 0 and at various time points thereafter. The following day the samples were thawed on ice and (a) analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE, and (b) assayed for proteolytic activity for 10 min against the small peptide substrate Z-Phe-Arg-NMHec (see below) and against the protein substrate chicken ovalbumin (ratio of 20:1 protein to enzyme). Other aliquots were acidified by adding 20 μl of 5% trifluoroacetic acid to the frozen sample and then allowed to thaw. These were then loaded onto a biobrene-treated, precycled filter and subjected to five cycles of N-terminal (Edman) sequencing on an Applied Biosystems 494 Procise protein sequencing system. Other aliquots taken from the various time points in the autocatalytic reactions were diluted 50:50 with acetonitrile, water, 1% formic acid solution. The diluted samples were analyzed at the Australian Proteome Analysis Facility (Sydney, Australia) by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using a Q-TOF Ultima (Water/Micromass, Manchester, UK). The trans-processing of FheproCL1Gly26 and FheproCL1Pro-12/Gly26 was carried out by mixing 50 μg of purified mutant recombinant with 5.0 μg of the recombinant FheCL1 or FheCL2 that had been activated by the endogenous activation method described above. The mixture was then incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, and samples were removed at various time points for analysis by 12% SDS-PAGE. The trans-processing of FheproCL1Pro-12 by FheCL2 was performed by mixing 100 μg of purified mutant recombinant with 5 μg of the activated enzyme in a volume of 500 μl of 0.1 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0. Aliquots of 10 μl were taken over a period of 1 h and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. Samples taken at time 0 were also assessed for enzyme activity over the subsequent 10 min as described below. In experiments involving trans-processing by FheCL2, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a semi-dry transfer cell (Bio-Rad) at 15 V for 20 min. The membrane was washed with distilled H2O and stained with 0.025% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 40% methanol (37.Dowd A.J. McGonigle S. Dalton J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 38.Dowd A.J. Tort J. Roche L. Ryan T. Dalton J.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 88: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Protein bands were subjected to N-terminal sequencing at Genosphere Biotechnologies (Paris, France) or the Australian Proteomic Analysis Facility (Sydney, Australia). Fluorogenic Peptide Assays−Cathepsin L activity was determined by a fluorometric assay employing the substrate Z-Phe-Arg-NHMec (37.Dowd A.J. McGonigle S. Dalton J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 38.Dowd A.J. Tort J. Roche L. Ryan T. Dalton J.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 88: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The activity of the samples was calculated from a standard curve of NHMec ranging from 0 to 10 μm and presented as nanomoles of NHMec min-1 ml-1. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as standard. The progress of the autocatalytic activation of wild-type FheproCL1 and variant FheproCL1Pro-12 was observed by incubating the zymogen in the presence of the substrate Z-Phe-Arg-NHMec and measuring fluorescence over time. Processing was initiated by adding diluted zymogen to the assay mixture containing 50 mm acetate buffer, 2 μm substrate, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Progress curves were fitted to Equation 1 as described previously by Menard et al. (15.Menard R. Carmona E. Takebe S. Dufour E. Plouffe C. Mason P. Mort J.S. J. Biol.

Prosegment Sequences Comparisons−The prosegment sequence of the F. hepatica FheproCL1 was aligned with other sequences using ClustalX 1.81. Protein sequences included Carica papaya, human cathepsin L, human cathepsin S, and human cathepsin K. 6Protein sequences and accession numbers from GenBank™ are as follows: F. hepatica"
https://openalex.org/W2136123508,"Parafibromin (PF) is a 531-amino acid protein encoded by HRPT2, a putative tumor suppressor gene recently implicated in the autosomal-dominant hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor familial cancer syndrome and sporadic parathyroid carcinoma. To investigate effects of PF's overexpression on cell proliferation, we performed assays in four different cell lines. The transient overexpression of PF inhibited cell growth in HEK293 and NIH3T3 cells, but enhanced cell growth in the SV40 large T antigen-expressing cell lines such as 293FT and COS7 cells. In 293FT cells, PF was found to interact with SV40 large T antigen and its overexpression promoted entry into the S phase, implying that the interaction enhanced progression through the cell cycle. The tumor suppressor protein PF acts as a positive regulator of cell growth similar to an oncoprotein in the presence of SV40 large T antigen."

https://openalex.org/W2016831280,"Integrin α7β1 is the major laminin binding integrin receptor of muscle cells. The α7 chain occurs in several splice isoforms, of which α7A and α7B differ in their intracellular domains only. The fact that the expression of α7A and α7B is tightly regulated during skeletal muscle development suggests different and distinct roles for both isoforms. However, so far, functional properties and interacting proteins were described for the α7B chain only. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have found that Def-6, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac1, binds to the intracellular domain of the α7A subunit. The specificity of the Def-6-α7A interaction has been shown by direct yeast two-hybrid binding assays and coprecipitation experiments. This is the first description of an α7A-specific and -exclusive interaction, because Def-6 did not bind to any other tested integrin cytoplasmic domain. Interestingly, the binding of Def-6 to α7A was abolished, when cells were cotransfected with an Src-related kinase, which is known to phosphorylate Def-6 and stimulate its exchange activity. We found expression of Def-6 was not only restricted to T-lymphocytes as described thus far but in a more widespread manner, including different muscle tissues. In cells, Def-6 is seen in newly forming cell protrusions and focal adhesions, and its localization partially overlaps with the α7A integrin receptor. C2C12 myoblasts overexpressing Def-6 show a delay of Rac1 inactivation during myogenic differentiation and abnormal myotube formation. Thus, our data suggest a role for Def-6 in the fine regulation of Rac1 during myogenesis with the integrin α7A chain guiding this regulation in a spatio-temporal manner.

Interestingly, the binding of Def-6 to α7A was abolished, when cells were cotransfected with an Src-related kinase, which is known to phosphorylate Def-6 and stimulate its exchange activity. We found expression of Def-6 was not only restricted to T-lymphocytes as described thus far but in a more widespread manner, including different muscle tissues. In cells, Def-6 is seen in newly forming cell protrusions and focal adhesions, and its localization partially overlaps with the α7A integrin receptor. C2C12 myoblasts overexpressing Def-6 show a delay of Rac1 inactivation during myogenic differentiation and abnormal myotube formation. Thus, our data suggest a role for Def-6 in the fine regulation of Rac1 during myogenesis with the integrin α7A chain guiding this regulation in a spatio-temporal manner. Integrins are heterodimeric cell surface receptors that bind to components of the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) 3The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; RT, reverse transcription; DBD, DNA-binding domain; AD, activation domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DHL, dbl-homology-like. or to other cell surface molecules. They are composed of two non-covalently linked transmembrane polypeptides (α- and β-chain). So far 18 α- and 8 β-chains have been described, which form at least 24 integrin receptors with different substrate-binding specificities determined by the individual combination of α- and β-chains. Besides forming a mechanical link between the ECM and the cytoskeleton, integrins regulate a broad variety of signaling events that influence cellular functions such as proliferation, cell differentiation, and apoptosis (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6950) Google Scholar). Consequently, the cytoplasmic domains of integrin receptors play key roles in the transduction of “outside-in” as well as “inside-out” signals (2DeMali K.A. Wennerberg K. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 572-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 3Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3828) Google Scholar, 4Ginsberg M.H.

They have been found to interact with an array of proteins that are part of signaling cascades or that provide linkage to the actin cytoskeleton (7van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Integrin α7β1 is mainly expressed in muscle tissues (8Burkin D.J. Kaufman S.J. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 296: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 9Mayer U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14587-14590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and the receptor exclusively binds to laminins (10von der Mark H. Williams I. Wendler O. Sorokin L. von der Mark K. Poschl E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6012-6016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Muscle precursor cells (myoblasts) use the α7β1 receptor to adhere to and migrate on laminin (11Yao C.C. Ziober B.L. Squillace R.M. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25598-25603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and laminin-containing ECM increases the differentiation potential of myoblasts (12von der Mark K. Ocalan M. Differentiation. 1989; 40: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The importance of this kind of cell-matrix linkage in muscles becomes obvious when one considers the phenotypes of mouse null mutants, which lack either the major laminin isoform in muscles (laminin α2 chain as part of laminin-211) 4Nomenclature of laminin isoforms according to Aumailley et al. (63Aumailley M. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Carter W.G. Deutzmann R. Edgar D. Ekblom P. Engel J. Engvall E. Hohenester E. Jones J.C. Kleinman H.K. Marinkovich M.P. Martin G.R. Mayer U. Meneguzzi G.

Genet. 1994; 8: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) or the integrin α7 chain (14Mayer U. Saher G. Fassler R. Bornemann A. Echtermeyer F. von der Mark H. Miosge N. Poschl E. von der Mark K. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In both cases, the animals suffer from severe postnatal muscular dystrophy and muscle wasting. The integrin α7 chain exists in different splice isoforms (8Burkin D.J. Kaufman S.J. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 296: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 15Song W.K. Wang W. Sato H. Bielser D.A. Kaufman S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1139-1152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ziober B.L. Vu M.P. Waleh N. Crawford J. Lin C.S. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26773-26783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α7X1 and α7X2 splice variants differ in the extracellular putative β-propeller domain, a region between the homology repeats III and IV (17Ziober B.L. Chen Y. Kramer R.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1723-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This leads to different binding abilities of the receptor for certain laminin isoforms (10von der Mark H. Williams I. Wendler O. Sorokin L. von der Mark K. Poschl E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6012-6016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, the physiological relevance of these diverse binding affinities is not known. The splice isoforms α7A and α7B have different amino acid sequences within the intracellular tail. Interestingly, the expression of α7A and α7B during muscle development and regeneration is tightly regulated, and this regulation pattern is highly conserved among different mammalian species (15Song W.K. Wang W. Sato H. Bielser D.A. Kaufman S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1139-1152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Collo G. Starr L. Quaranta V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19019-19024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Velling T. Collo G. Sorokin L. Durbeej M. Zhang H. Gullberg D. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 207: 355-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Undifferentiated myoblasts express the α7B splice isoform only, whereas α7A expression is up-regulated after induction of myotube formation (15Song W.K. Wang W. Sato H. Bielser D.A. Kaufman S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1139-1152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, α7 splice variants are also regulated during muscle regeneration after injury (20Kaariainen M. Nissinen L. Kaufman S. Sonnenberg A. Jarvinen M. Heino J. Kalimo H. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 1023-1031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). All these observations strongly suggest an important function for the α7A chain during differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes. The cytoplasmic tail of the α7 chain does not influence the attachment ability of α7β1 expressing cells to laminin (21Mielenz D. Hapke S. Poschl E. von Der Mark H. von Der Mark K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13417-13426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore the physiological relevance of the different intracellular parts is most likely due to different abilities of α7A and α7B to interact with intracellular proteins. Thus they might function in alternative signaling events during muscle differentiation and regeneration or provide additional mechanical linkage to the cytoskeleton. Rho GTPases are molecular switches regulating a variety of cellular processes, like endocytosis, cell-cycle progression, differentiation, and gene transcription (22Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar). Members of the Rho GTPase family cycle between an activated GTP-bound state and an inactivated form in which the GTP has been hydrolyzed to GDP. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP, thereby activating Rho GTPases. Rho GTPases were shown to be strongly involved in the proper differentiation of myoblasts (23Bryan B.A. Li D. Wu X. Liu M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 1547-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Specifically, the tight regulation of Rac1 seems to be important for myogenesis. During normal differentiation of myoblasts the overall endogenous pool of active Rac1 significantly decreases. However, Rac1 activity is never shut off completely but remains at a basal level during differentiation (24Heller H. Gredinger E. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37307-37316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In fact, some steps of myogenesis seem to require locally restricted Rac1 activity (25Weston C. Yee B. Hod E. Prives J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The mechanisms regulating these complex patterns of Rac1 activity during myogenesis are still poorly understood. In the present study, we report a novel interaction between the cytoplasmic tail of the integrin α7A chain and Def-6 (also known as: IBP, SLAT). The Def-6-related protein Swap-70 also binds to the α7A cytoplasmic domain, albeit with a lower affinity. Def-6 and Swap-70 were recently described as a novel group of GEFs for Rho GTPases (26Gupta S. Fanzo J.C. Hu C. Cox D. Jang S.Y. Lee A.E. Greenberg S. Pernis A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43541-43549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27Shinohara M. Terada Y. Iwamatsu A. Shinohara A. Mochizuki N. Higuchi M. Gotoh Y. Ihara S. Nagata S. Itoh H. Fukui Y. Jessberger R. Nature. 2002; 416: 759-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Their interactions with α7A are highly specific and exclusive, because no other integrin cytoplasmic domain showed binding to these proteins. Interestingly, we found that tyrosine phosphorylation of Def-6 abolishes this interaction. Our data implicate Def-6 in the tight regulation of Rac1 activity during myoblast differentiation. DNA Vectors—All yeast two-hybrid pAS2-1 (Clontech) derivate constructs coding for fusion proteins of the GAL4-DNA binding domain and full-length or truncated intracellular parts of integrin subunits have been described elsewhere (28Samson T. Smyth N. Janetzky S. Wendler O. Muller J.M. Schule R. von der Mark H. von der Mark K. Wixler V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28641-28652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). cDNA fragments encoding the complete sequences of Def-6 (NCBI accession number gi:142375804) and Swap-70 (NCBI gi:40789274) or their deletion mutants were generated by RT-PCR from murine spleen RNA. The RT-PCR fragments were subsequently cloned in-frame into pACT2 vector (Clontech). pEBG-derived expression constructs containing GST-α7A or GST-α7B and their deletion mutants for expression in mammalian cells have been described previously (28Samson T. Smyth N. Janetzky S. Wendler O. Muller J.M. Schule R. von der Mark H. von der Mark K. Wixler V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28641-28652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To express Def-6 in mammalian cells, the Def-6 cDNA insert was subcloned from the pACT2 vector into pEF1-Myc/his (Invitrogen), pCS2+MT (29Wixler V. Geerts D. Laplantine E. Westhoff D. Smyth N. Aumailley M. Sonnenberg A. Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33669-33678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), or pBabe-neo (30Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar). pBabe-puro constructs containing the cDNA for the complete α7A or α7B chain have been already described elsewhere (28Samson T. Smyth N. Janetzky S. Wendler O. Muller J.M. Schule R. von der Mark H. von der Mark K. Wixler V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28641-28652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To generate pBabe-neo/-puro-derived retroviruses, GPE86-cells (31Markowitz D.G. Goff S.P. Bank A. Trans Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1988; 101: 212-218PubMed Google Scholar) were stably transfected with FuGene6 (Roche Applied Science). Supernatants from these cells were collected and used for the infection of C2C12 cells. 48 h later, selection of infected cells was started with 1 mg/ml G418 or 4 μg/ml puromycin. Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—The initial yeast two-hybrid screen to identify novel intracellular binding partners of the α7Aβ1 integrin receptor has been described elsewhere (28Samson T. Smyth N. Janetzky S. Wendler O. Muller J.M. Schule R. von der Mark H. von der Mark K. Wixler V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28641-28652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, a human placenta cDNA library (MATCHMAKER™, Clontech) was screened for proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic part of the α7A integrin chain. The intracellular part of the murine integrin α7A subunit (amino acids 1104-1161) was cloned in the pAS2-1 vector and used as bait (amino acids positions refer to NCBI accession code gi:3378242). For direct yeast two-hybrid analysis, the yeast strain Y190 was cotransformed with the pAS2-1 plasmid containing the GAL4-DNA binding domain (DBD) fused with appropriate cDNAs as bait and with pACT2 plasmid containing cDNAs fused to GAL4-activation domain (AD) as prey. Transformants were grown on synthetic defined medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine in the presence of 25 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. On day 6 the colonies were tested for the lacZ reporter gene activity in a β-galactosidase filter assay. The interaction was scored as negative (-) when no blue colonies were visible after 8 h, and scored as: weak (+), intermediate (++), or strong (+++) when blue colonies became visible after 8, 4, or 1 h, respectively. For relative quantification of the β-galactosidase activity, the transformants were first grown on synthetic defined medium lacking leucine and tryptophan and subsequently introduced into the liquid culture assay using ortho-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate. The measured β-galactosidase activity within one experiment was calculated relative to a positive control, which was set as 100%. Cell Culture—HEK293, NIH3T3, and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-high glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. C2C12 myoblasts were cultured at low densities in growth medium: 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-low glucose and F-12/Ham medium, supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum. To induce differentiation, growth medium was replaced by differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-high glucose, 2% horse serum). All cells were grown in a 37 °C and 5% CO2 incubator. Antibodies—The following antibodies were used: mouse-anti-Myc, clone 9E10 (32Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar), rabbit-anti-GST, and anti-slow skeletal myosin monoclonal antibody (NOQ7.5.4D, Sigma), mouse-anti-sarcomere myosin (clone MF-20, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa), mouse-anti-phosphotyrosine (clone PY99, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse-anti-integrin α7, clone 3C12 (recognizes the extracellular part of the receptor) (21Mielenz D.

Hapke S. Poschl E. von der Mark H. Moch H. von der Mark K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), rabbit-anti-integrin α7A (a gift of Ulrike Mayer, Manchester, UK), mouse anti-Rac1 (BD Biosciences), peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for immunoblot analysis (Amersham Biosciences), and secondary fluorescent antibodies (Dianova and Molecular Probes). Polyclonal antibodies against Def-6 were raised against a bacterially expressed GST fusion protein that contained amino acids 410-630 of murine Def-6. The final serum was precleared with GST-loaded glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Subsequently, Def-6 antibodies were affinity-purified using GST-Def-6-amino acids 410-630-conjugated CNBr-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The specificity of the purified antibodies was tested by immunoblotting cell lysates from Def-6-transfected cells versus non-transfected cells (Fig. 4C, last two lanes). Immunofluorescence Staining of Cells—Cells were cultured on coverslips as indicated in the figure legends. Before staining, the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed for 15 min with 2% paraformaldehyde at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 2 min, and subsequently blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with primary antibody and were detected by species-specific fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies. Fluorescence images were taken with a Axioplan-2 microscope (Zeiss). Images shown in Fig. 5 (F and G) were taken with a Zeiss 510 Meta laser-scanning confocal microscope. Determination of Myotube Fusion Index—C2C12 cells were grown and differentiated on coverslips. On day 3 after the switch to differentiation medium, cells were fixed and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and anti-sarcomere myosin antibody MF-20. Photos were taken from random fields (20× objective), and nuclei were counted per field. The fusion index was calculated as the ratio of nuclei in differentiated myotubes versus the total amount of nuclei per field. Myotubes were defined as MF-20-positive cells, which contain more than three nuclei. At least four fields were counted per experiment. Coprecipitation Assays and Immunoblotting—2 × 105 HEK293 cells were plated in 6-well dishes 48 h before transfection with FuGene6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). 1 μg of each cDNA plasmid was used per transfection. The total DNA amount was equalized with appropriate empty expression vectors. 30 h after transfection the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in IP buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin) for 10 min. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. To reduce nonspecific binding of proteins, Sepharose beads were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in IP buffer before incubation with cell lysates. For GST pulldown experiments, the cleared supernatants were incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C with GSH-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). For immune precipitations, Protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were used instead. The beads were subsequently washed twice with IP buffer, boiled in sample buffer, and separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as indicated. To detect the peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, an ECL detection system (Pierce) was used. For detection of phosphorylated Def-6 protein in cell lysates, C2C12 cells were lysed in 2× SDS gel sample buffer and boiled for 5 min, to denature all proteins completely. Subsequently the samples were diluted 20-fold with phospho-IP buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin) to a final concentration of 0.1% SDS. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were then precipitated using PY-99 antibody and Protein G-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed four times with phospho-IP buffer before being analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Def-6 polyclonal antibody. Rac1 Activity Assay—Activity assays for Rac1 were performed as previously described (34Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 4 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose beads previously loaded with 30 μg of GST-tagged PBD (Rac1/cdc42 binding domain of PAK1). Subsequently the beads were washed four times in lysis buffer, boiled in sample buffer, and separated by 15% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. RT-PCR—For the isolation of total RNA from cells or tissues, TRIzol (Invitrogen) was used. mRNA was isolated from the total RNA using Oligotex (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed with the First-strand-cDNA synthesis Kit (Roche Applied Science). For qualitative expression analysis the High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Applied Science) was used with the following primers: Def-6, ACCATGGCCCTGCGCAAGGAGCTG/TGGTGCTGGATCCAGTTTTTC; Itga7, CTCTACAGCTTTGATCGTGCAGC/AAACCACTGGACTGGTACAGCAC; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, ATCACTGCCACCCAGAAGAC/ATGAGGTCCACCACCCTGTT. Both Def-6 and Swap-70 Bind Specifically to the Cytoplasmic Part of the Integrin α7A Subunit—To identify novel proteins that specifically interact with the cytoplasmic part of the α7A integrin subunit, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen. A human placenta cDNA library was screened with the complete intracellular domain of the α7A chain (amino acids 1104-1161) as bait. Out of 288 isolated clones, 7 coded for Def-6 and 2 for Swap-70. Both proteins have recently been described as GEFs for the Rho GTPase Rac1 (26Gupta S. Fanzo J.C. Hu C. Cox D. Jang S.Y. Lee A.E. Greenberg S. Pernis A.B. J. Biol.

Itoh H. Fukui Y. Jessberger R. Nature. 2002; 416: 759-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Def-6 and Swap-70 differ from all other GEFs of the Dbl family in that the pleckstrin homology domain is located N-terminal to a dbl-homology-like (DHL) domain, which shows a low homology to the DH domain of other GEFs like Vav and Tiam1 (26Gupta S.

McKinlay K.J. Jones P. Sablitzky F. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To test the specificity of the interactions, direct yeast two-hybrid analyses were carried out. Def-6 and Swap-70 were expressed in yeast Y190 cells as AD fusion proteins and tested for interaction with DBD fusions of several different integrin cytoplasmic domains (Table 1). Interestingly, with the exception of α7A, none of the 11 tested α-integrin subunits showed binding to either Def-6 or Swap-70. Also α7B, the splice counterpart of α7A chain, did not interact with these GEF proteins. According to previous reports, the nine most C-terminal amino acids of the α7B chain seem to have an inhibitory effect on the interaction with other proteins (15Song W.K. Wang W. Sato H. Bielser D.A. Kaufman S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1139-1152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Samson T. Smyth N. Janetzky S. Wendler O. Muller J.M. Schule R. von der Mark H. von der Mark K. Wixler V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28641-28652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). But even a deletion mutant of the α7B cytoplasmic tail, which lacks these nine amino acids (α7Bdel1), did not bind to Def-6 or Swap-70. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic domains of neither β1A nor β1D integrin subunits interacted with these GEF proteins. Nonspecific binding of Def-6 and Swap-70 to the DBD alone could be excluded, because there was no interaction detectable between the DBD and AD-Def-6 or AD-Swap-70 (Table 1).TABLE 1Specificity of interaction of Def-6 and Swap-70 with cytoplasmic domains of different integrin chainsDBDADDef-6Swap-70AD vectorα1−−−α2−−−αIIb−−−α3A−−−α3B−−−α4−−−α5−−−α6A−−−α6B−−−α7A+++++−α7B−−−α7Bdel1−−−β1A−−−β1D−−−DBD vector−−− Open table in a new tab To test the relative binding strengths of Def-6 and Swap-70 to the α7A cytoplasmic domain, quantitative yeast two-hybrid analysis were performed. The known strong interacting protein pair p53 and SV40 large T-antigen was used as a positive control and set as 100%. According to the relative β-galactosidase activity, Def-6 bound to α7A about one order of magnitude stronger compared with that interaction between Swap-70 and α7A (Fig. 1A, Def-6/α7A: 232% ± 43%; Swap-70/α7A: 13.8% ± 3.6%). Again, no interaction was detected between Def-6 or Swap-70 and the DBD protein alone. Next we tested if these interactions could occur in mammalian cells. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with plasmids coding for the expression of GST-tagged α7A- or α7B-cytoplasmic tails and Myc-tagged Def-6 or Swap-70. GST-tagged α7-cytodomains were precipitated and analyzed by immunoblotting for the coprecipitation of Myc-Def-6 or Myc-Swap-70. Def-6 coprecipitated only with GST-α7A, but not with GST-α7Bdel1 or GST alone (Fig. 1B, top panel). Myc-Swap-70 showed the same coprecipitation behavior, except that the degree of binding to GST-α7A was much lower (Fig. 1B, long exposure blot). Thus the results from coprecipitation experiments correlate well with those obtained by the quantitative yeast two-hybrid data. Taken together, these studies show that Def-6 and Swap-70 interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin α7A chain, but not with any other integrin tested, including α7B and β1 chains. As the A splice isoform of the α7 integrin subunit occurs exclusively in differentiating and mature skeletal muscle cells, these results suggest a muscle specific role for this interaction. Mapping of the Interaction-mediating Protein Domains and Amino Acid Sequences—As both Def-6 and Swap-70 bind to the α7A integrin chain, it was of interest to test whether they use identical binding sites on the α7A chain. To study this, a series of deletion mutants of the α7A cytoplasmic domain was created and used for direct yeast two-hybrid interaction assays with Def-6 and Swap-70, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2A both proteins bind to the full-length α7A cytoplasmic domain and to the α7Adel1 deletion mutant, which lacks the last 10 C-terminal amino acids. Deletion of an additional 13 amino acids (α7Adel2), or more, abrogated the binding of Def-6 and Swap-70. These data indicate that both Def-6 and Swap-70 use the same amino acid motif of the α7A chain for interaction which is at least 13 amino acids (GTVGWDSSSGRST) in length. Def-6 and Swap-70 show an identical arrangement of protein subdomains: an N-terminal EF-hand motif (EF), a central PH domain, and a C-terminal DHL domain (26Gupta S. Fanzo J.C. Hu C. Cox D. Jang S.Y.

https://openalex.org/W2061204467,"Mammalian AMP-activated protein kinase is a serine/threonine protein kinase that acts as a sensor of cellular energy status. AMP-activated protein kinase is a heterotrimer of three different subunits, i.e. α, β, and γ, with α being the catalytic subunit and β and γ having regulatory roles. Although several studies have defined different domains in α and β involved in the interaction with the other subunits of the complex, little is known about the regions of the γ subunits involved in these interactions. To study this, we have made sequential deletions from the N termini of the γ subunit isoforms and studied the interactions with α and β subunits, both by two-hybrid analysis and by co-immunoprecipitation. Our results suggest that a conserved region of 20–25 amino acids in γ1, γ2, and γ3, immediately N-terminal to the Bateman domains, is required for the formation of a functional, active αβγ complex. This region is required for the interaction with the β subunits. The interaction between the α and γ subunits does not require this region and occurs instead within the Bateman domains of the γ subunit, although the α-γ interaction does appear to stabilize the β-γ interaction. In addition, sequential deletions from the C termini of the γ subunits indicate that deletion of any of the CBS (cystathionine β-synthase) motifs prevents the formation of a functional complex with the α and β subunits.

It is activated by cellular stresses that deplete ATP, either by inhibiting ATP production (e.g. hypoxia, glucose deprivation, heat shock, and mitochondrial inhibitors) or by accelerating ATP consumption (e.g. muscle contraction). Depletion of ATP is always accompanied by increases in AMP due to the reaction catalyzed by adenylate kinase, and the increase in AMP:ATP ratio activates AMPK in an ultrasensitive manner (1.Hardie D.G. Salt I.P. Hawley S.A. Davies S.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Once activated it switches on catabolic pathways and switches off many ATP-consuming processes, including anabolic pathways (see Refs. 2.Carling D. Trends Biochem.

AMPK is a heterotrimer composed of three different subunits, i.e. α, β, and γ. The α subunit is the catalytic subunit; it contains a highly conserved kinase domain at the N terminus and a less well conserved C-terminal regulatory domain. Two isoforms have been described, i.e. α1 and α2; both are localized in the cytoplasm, although α2 is also present in the nucleus (6.Salt I.P. Johnson G. Ashcroft S.J. Hardie D.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The γ subunits contain four tandem repeats of a structural module called a CBS motif (7.Bateman A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 12-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), named after the enzyme cystathionine β-synthase, in which a pair of CBS motifs form a domain that binds the allosteric activator S-adenosyl methionine (8.Scott J.W. Hawley S.A. Green K.A. Anis M. Stewart G. Scullion G.A. Norman D.G. Hardie D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). In the AMPK γ subunits the four CBS motifs are now known to act in two pairs, forming two domains (referred to as Bateman domains) that bind the regulatory nucleotides, AMP and ATP, in a mutually exclusive manner (8.Scott J.W. Hawley S.A. Green K.A. Anis M. Stewart G. Scullion G.A. Norman D.G. Hardie D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Three isoforms of the γ subunit, i.e. γ1, γ2, and γ3, are encoded by distinct genes; they have poorly conserved N-terminal regions that in γ2 and γ3 are subject to alternate splicing, whereas the C-terminal regions, containing the two tandem Bateman domains, are conserved in all three isoforms. Two isoforms of the β subunit (β1 and β2) have been described; they differ at their N termini, but both appear to interact with the α and γ subunits with similar efficiency (9.Thornton C. Snowden M.A. Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12443-12450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 10.Gimeno-Alcaniz J.V. Sanz P. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The β subunits have two conserved regions, a central glycogen-binding domain (11.Hudson E.R. Pan D.A. James J. Lucocq J.M.

Recent studies have begun to delineate the regions of the α and β subunits required for the formation of heterotrimeric complexes, although there have been some conflicting findings. Detailed mapping of the C-terminal domain of β1 suggested that the last 25 residues are sufficient to form a complex with γ1, γ2, and γ3, with the C-terminal residue (Ile270) being essential for the formation of a β-γ complex in the absence of α (16.Iseli T.J. Walter M. van Denderen B.J. Katsis F. Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. Michell B.J. Stapleton D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13395-13400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). By contrast, it was recently reported that β2 and γ1 do not form a complex in the absence of α2 (17.Wong K.A. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36434-36442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of the α subunit has been reported to be involved in the interaction with β (16.Iseli T.J. Walter M. van Denderen B.J. Katsis F. Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. Michell B.J. Stapleton D.

Biol. 2003; 333: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), although another study has suggested that γ1 interacts with α2 via both the N-terminal catalytic domain and the C-terminal domain of the latter (17.Wong K.A. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36434-36442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).As yet, little is known about which portions of the γ subunits are involved in the interaction with the α and β subunits. To study this, we have made deletions of the regions of the γ subunits N-terminal to the Bateman domains. Our results show that a conserved sequence of 20–25 residues, immediately N-terminal to the first Bateman domain (the “pre-CBS1 sequence”), is required for the binding of γ1, γ2, and γ3 to the β subunits and for the formation of an active αβγ complex. In addition, we have made C-terminal deletions of the γ subunits and observed that deletion of any of the CBS motifs prevents the formation of functional complexes with the α and β subunits.MATERIALS AND METHODSMicroorganisms, Culture Conditions, and Genetic Methods−Escherichia coli DH5α was used as the host strain for plasmid constructions. It was grown in LB (1% peptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 1% NaCl, pH 7.5) medium supplemented with 50 mg/liter ampicillin.Saccharomyces cerevisiae CTY10-5d (MATa ade2 his3 leu2 trp1 gal4 gal80 URA3::lexAop-lacZ) was used in the two-hybrid experiments.

John Wiley & Sons, New York1997: 20.1-20.40Google Scholar) digested with EcoRI/XhoI. Progressive deletions of the AMPKγ3 open reading frame were obtained by PCR using the forward oligonucleotides Gamma3-A, -B, -C, -D, -E, and -F and the reverse oligonucleotide Gamma3-SalI (Table 1). The amplified fragments were sequenced to check the absence of undesired modifications and then digested with EcoRI/SalI and subcloned into pEG202 to obtain plasmids pEG-AMPKγ3A, -B, -C, -D, -E, and -F, respectively.To construct plasmids pEG-AMPKγ1 (LexA-AMPKγ1) and pACT2-AMPKγ1, a 1.9-kb ApaI/NotI fragment from plasmid pcDNA3-AMPKγ1 (containing the human cDNA of AMPKγ1), was blunted with Klenow enzyme and ligated into the SmaI site of pEG202 and pACT2 (22.Legrain P. Dokhelar M.-C. Transy C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3241-3242Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), respectively. Plasmid pEG-AMPKγ1-NtΔ was obtained by amplifying the corresponding fragment by PCR using oligonucleotides Gamma1-CBS1 and Gamma1-2 (Table 1). The fragment was then digested with SmaI/XhoI and subcloned into pEG202, previously digested with SmaI/XhoI. To obtain plasmid pACT2-AMPKγ1-CBS1, a BglII fragment from pACT2-AMPKγ1 (containing the N-terminal domain and the first CBS motif) was subcloned into pACT2 digested with BglII and treated with alkaline phosphatase. Plasmid pACT2-AMPKγ1-CBS12 was obtained by eliminating an EcoRI fragment from pACT2-AMPKγ1 and re-ligating. Plasmid pACT2-AMPKγ1-CBS123 was obtained by amplifying the corresponding fragment by PCR using oligonucleotides Gamma1-1 and Gamma1-CBS123 (Table 1). The fragment was then digested with NotI, filled with Klenow enzyme, digested with XhoI, and then subcloned into pACT2 digested with SmaI and XhoI.To construct plasmid pEG-AMPKγ2 (LexA-AMPKγ2), an EcoRI/XhoI fragment from plasmid pcDNA3-AMPKγ2 (containing the human cDNA of AMPKγ2) was subcloned into plasmid pEG202 (21.Golemis E.A.

Plasmid pEG-AMPKγ2 short (LexA-AMPKγ2 short) was constructed in a similar way from plasmid pcDNA3-AMPKγ2 short (expressing γ2 from residue 242 up to 569). Plasmid pEG-AMPKγ2-NtΔ was obtained by amplifying the corresponding fragment by PCR using oligonucleotides Gamma2-CBS1 and Gamma2-2 (Table 1). The fragment was then digested with SmaI/XhoI and subcloned into pEG202, previously digested with SmaI/XhoI. To obtain yeast plasmids expressing different mutated forms of AMPKγ2, EcoRI/XhoI fragments from plasmids pcDNA3-AMPKγ2 R302Q, L-ins, H383R, and T400N (containing the human cDNA of the corresponding mutated forms) were subcloned into pEG202.To express the “short” and “long” truncations of γ subunits for co-precipitation studies in mammalian cells, DNAs encoding residues 22–331 (γ1L) or 47–331 (γ1S) of human γ1 (P54619), 253–569 (γ2L) or 279–569 (γ2S) of human γ2 (Q9UGJ0), or 177–489 (γ3L) or 202–489 (γ3S) of human γ3 (Q9UGI9) were cloned by reverse transcription-PCR from human brain mRNA (γ1 and γ2) or by PCR from Image clone 40005880 (γ3), and subcloned using EcoRI and KpnI sites into pFLAG-CMV5a (Sigma). The expressed proteins have a single methionine before the residues listed and a FLAG tag at the C terminus.Other plasmids used in this study were pACT2 (22.Legrain P. Dokhelar M.-C. Transy C.

Jiang R. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6245-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar).Preparation of Yeast Cell Extracts and Immunoblot Analysis−Yeast cells corresponding to 1 unit of A600 were collected by rapid centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 1 min), resuspended in 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled for 3 min. Glass beads (0.3 g, 450-μm diameter) were added to the suspension, and then the cells were vortexed at full speed for 30 s. The suspension was boiled again for 3 min and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 1 min. 20 μl of the supernatants was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-LexA polyclonal antibodies (Invitrogen) or anti-HA polyclonal antibodies (Clontech).Cell Culture and Transfection−HeLa and HEK293 cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All transfections were carried out using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions.Co-immunoprecipitation Studies−Cells were transiently transfected with combinations of plasmids encoding the α (N-terminal Myc-tagged), β (untagged), and γ (C-terminal FLAG-tagged) subunits of AMPK. Cell lysates were prepared 24 h post-transfection and incubated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma) for 2 h on a rotating wheel at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor). Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 4–12% gradient NuPAGE gel, using MOPS running buffer (Invitrogen). Western blots were carried out, and protein was detected by antibody labeling and enhanced chemiluminescence using standard techniques.Kinase Assays−Activity of AMPK in immunoprecipitates was measured as described previously (25.Hardie D.G. Salt I.P. Davies S.P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 99: 63-74PubMed Google Scholar).Production and Growth of Mouse Embryo Fibroblasts−AMPKα subunit knockout MEFs (α1–/– and α2–/–) and wild-type controls were constructed and grown as described previously (26.Laderoute K.R.

They were transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.RESULTSThe γ Subunits Interact with α and β via Their N-terminal Regions by Two-hybrid Analysis−We commenced our study by analyzing two-hybrid interactions of mammalian AMPK subunits expressed in yeast. Because the α2β2γ3 complex appears to play an important role in skeletal muscle (27.Wojtaszewski J.F. Birk J.B. Frosig C. Holten M. Pilegaard H. Dela F. J. Physiol. 2005; 564: 563-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), we initially studied the interaction between β2 and γ3, which has an N-terminal extension of 201 amino acids prior to the first Bateman domain. An LexA-γ3 fusion protein interacted strongly with a GAD-β2 fusion (Fig. 1), so we made sequential deletions from the N terminus of γ3 and checked their interaction with GAD-β2. As shown in Fig. 1B, deletion of the first 33 amino acids of γ3(γ3A) decreased the interaction slightly, whereas further successive deletions of 45 (γ3B) and 40 (γ3C) amino acids did not further modify the interaction. However, the deletion of the following 35 amino acids (γ3D) reduced the interaction, and the deletion of the next 47 amino acids (γ3E, truncated at the start of the first Bateman domain) completely abolished it. Additional deletion of the first CBS motif (γ3F) gave the same negative results as γ3E. Control experiments using the various LexA-γ3 constructs and the empty vector pACT2 gave negligible (<1 unit) β-galactosidase activity in all the cases (not shown). Western blot analysis indicated that all deleted forms were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 1C). These results suggested that the interaction between γ3 and β2 requires the 47 amino acids immediately prior to the first Bateman domain, although residues N-terminal to that may improve the interaction. We also attempted to study the interaction between γ3 and α2 using the same approach, but there was a very low level of interaction evident even with the full-length construct (<1 unit of β-galactosidase).We next studied γ1, the most abundant γ subunit in skeletal muscle (27.Wojtaszewski J.F. Birk J.B. Frosig C. Holten M. Pilegaard H. Dela F. J. Physiol. 2005; 564: 563-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, a fusion between LexA and full-length γ1 was able to interact strongly with both α2 and β2. However, the deletion of the first 41 amino acids from the N terminus (a truncation at the start of the first Bateman domain) completely abolished the interaction with both α2 and β2. Control experiments using both LexA-γ1 constructs and the empty vector pACT2 gave negligible (<1 unit) β-galactosidase activity (not shown). Western blot analysis indicated that the truncated LexA-γ1 protein was produced at similar levels to the full-length protein (Fig. 2A, right panel).FIGURE 2Requirements for the interaction between γ and β subunits using two-hybrid analysis. Yeast CTY10.5d strain was transformed with plasmids expressing GAD-AMPKα2 or GAD-AMPKβ2 and either LexA-AMPKγ1 (wild type and N-terminal deleted form, Nt-Δ)(A) or LexA-AMPKγ2 (full-length, short form and N-terminal deleted form, Nt-Δ)(B). Transformants growing exponentially in SC-4% glucose medium were harvested, and the β-galactosidase activity was measured. Values correspond to means from four to six different transformants (S.D. < 15% in all cases; not shown). Crude extracts from these transformants were analyzed by Western blot using anti-LexA polyclonal antibodies. One representative transformant from each interaction is shown. C, interaction between γ and β in snf1Δ mutants. FY250 (wild type) and FY250 snf1Δ mutant strains containing the pSH18–18 reporter plasmid were transformed with plasmids expressing GAD-AMPKβ2 and either LexA-AMPKγ1, LexA-AMPKγ2, or LexA-AMPKγ3-D. Transformants growing exponentially in SC-4% glucose medium were analyzed as above. Bars indicated ± S.D. Crude extracts from these transformants were analyzed by Western blot using anti-LexA polyclonal antibodies. One representative transformant from each interaction is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Similar results were obtained when we studied γ2. A fusion between LexA and full-length γ2, containing an N-terminal extension of 278 amino acids prior to the first Bateman domain, interacted with α2 and β2 (Fig. 2B). A truncated form containing only the first 37 amino acids prior to the first Bateman domain interacted strongly with α2 and β2 (Fig. 2B), perhaps because the truncated form was better expressed (see Fig. 2B, right panel). However, the deletion of these 37 amino acids from the N terminus (a truncation at the start of the first Bateman domain) completely abolished the interaction with both α2 and β2 (Fig. 2B). Control experiments using the different LexA-γ2 constructs and the empty vector pACT2 gave negligible (<1 unit) β-galactosidase activity (not shown). Therefore, our results suggest that 37–47 amino acids immediately prior to the first Bateman domain of the three γ subunits are necessary for their interaction with α2 and β2.Because yeast contains orthologues to the three AMPK subunits (AMPKα, Snf1; AMPKβ, Gal83/Sip1/Sip2; and AMPKγ, Snf4), we studied whether the interaction between AMPKβ and the three γ subunits was dependent on the presence of the orthologous Snf1/AMPKα subunit. With this aim, we repeated the two-hybrid experiments in yeast cells lacking the SNF1 gene (snf1Δ mutant). As shown in Fig. 2C, the three γ subunits interacted with the β2 subunit in the absence of Snf1/AMPKα. These results indicated that the β and the γ subunits interacted directly. The lower levels of interaction observed in snf1Δ mutants may suggest that the presence of the α subunit stabilizes the β-γ interaction.Mutations in the γ2 Bateman Domains Do Not Affect Binding to α2 and β2−Mutations in the PRKAG2 gene, encoding the γ2 subunit, cause heart diseases of varying degrees of severity that appear to be caused by excessive glycogen storage (28.Arad M.

In all cases, the described mutations affect critical residues in different CBS motifs of the γ2 subunit and, with the possible exception of the L-insert mutation, produce proteins with deficient AMP binding capacity (8.Scott J.W.

We studied four of these mutations (R302Q, L-insert, H383R, and T400N (Fig. 3A)) and checked by two-hybrid analysis whether the mutated forms interacted properly with α2 and β2. Compared with the wild type, all of the mutants interacted normally with α2, and the interaction was increased in the absence of glucose, as reported previously for the wild type (10.Gimeno-Alcaniz J.V. Sanz P. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). None of the mutations affected the two-hybrid interaction of γ2 with β2 either (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3Analysis of the interaction of different mutated forms of AMPKγ2 and AMPKα2 and AMPKβ2.

Yeast CTY10.5d strain was transformed with plasmids expressing the indicated mutated forms of AMPKγ2 (LexA-AMPKγ2) and GAD-AMPKα2. Transformants growing exponentially in SC-4% glucose medium were washed with water and shifted to SC-0.05% glucose medium for 3 h. Then samples were harvested from the cultures grown at high and low glucose conditions, and the β-galactosidase activity was measured. Values correspond to means from four to six different transformants (bars indicated ± S.D.). C, interaction with AMPKβ2.

https://openalex.org/W1979478941,"The RING finger protein CrgA acts as a negative regulator of light-induced carotene biosynthesis in the fungus Mucor circinelloides. Sequence analysis of the crgA coding region upstream of the first AUG codon revealed the existence of an additional non-canonical RING finger domain at the most N-terminal end of the protein. The newly identified RING finger domain is required for CrgA to regulate photocarotenogenesis, as deduced from site-directed mutagenesis experiments. The role of both RING finger domains in the stability of CrgA has been investigated in a yeast system. Wild type CrgA, but not the RING finger deleted forms, is highly unstable and is stabilized by inhibition of the proteasome function, which suggests that native CrgA is degraded by the proteasome and that active RING finger domains are required for proteasome-mediated CrgA degradation. To identify the translation start of CrgA, a mutational analysis of putative initiation codons in the 5' region of the crgA gene was accomplished. We demonstrated that a GUG codon located upstream of the first AUG is the sole initiator of CrgA translation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a naturally occurring non-AUG start codon for a RING finger regulatory protein. A combination of suboptimal translation initiation and proteasome degradation may help to maintain the low cellular levels of CrgA observed in wild type cells, which is probably required for accurate regulation of photocarotenogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2069929633,"Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) is toxic to multidrug-resistant neuroblastoma cells in vivo and in vitro. In neuroblastoma, As2O3 does not exert its cell death-promoting effects via a classical apoptotic pathway. A death mechanism involving proteolytic cleavage of Bax to a p18 form seems to be of importance, because inhibition of Bax cleavage coincides with diminished cell death. As existing models of cell death implicate Bax in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, triggering death after Bax translocation to the mitochondria, we investigated the cellular localization of p18 Bax by subcellular fractionation. After As2O3 treatment, p18 Bax was only present in nuclei-enriched, mitochondria-depleted fractions. Cytoplasmic p21 Bax levels decreased, whereas total (p21 and p18) nuclear Bax increased. Overexpressed p21 Bax localized to the cytoplasm and nuclei, whereas overexpressed p18 Bax localized to extra-nuclear structures only. The inability of overexpressed p18 Bax to locate to the nucleus, and the As2O3-induced reduction of p21 Bax in the cytosol, suggest an As2O3-induced mechanism where p18 Bax gets cleaved and ‘trapped’ in the nucleus. This model is strengthened by the observation that calpain, the protease responsible for p18 Bax generation, is present in the nuclei, and that nuclear calpain is induced by increasing As2O3 and Ca2+ levels."

https://openalex.org/W1541825774,"Extensive research has focused on transplantation of pluripotent stem cells for the treatment of central nervous system disorders, the therapeutic potential of stem cell therapy for injured peripheral nerves is largely unknown. We used a rat sciatic nerve transection model to test the ability of implanted embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived neural progenitor cells (ES-NPCs) in promoting repair of a severely injured peripheral nerve. Mouse ES cells were neurally induced in vitro; enhanced expression and/or secretion of growth factors were detected in differentiating ES cells. One hour after removal of a 1-cm segment of the left sciatic nerve, ES-NPCs were implanted into the gap between the nerve stumps with the surrounding epineurium as a natural conduit. The transplantation resulted in substantial axonal regrowth and nerve repair, which were not seen in culture medium controls. One to 3 months after axotomy, co-immunostaining with the mouse neural cell membrane specific antibody M2/M6 and the Schwann cell marker S100 suggested that transplanted ES-NPCs had survived and differentiated into myelinating cells. Regenerated axons were myelinated and showed a uniform connection between proximal and distal stumps. Nerve stumps had near normal diameter with longitudinally oriented, densely packed Schwann cell-like phenotype. Fluoro-Gold retrogradely labeled neurons were found in the spinal cord (T12-13) and DRG (L4-L6), suggesting reconnection of axons across the transection. Electrophysiological recordings showed functional activity recovered across the injury gap. These data suggest that transplanted neurally induced ES cells differentiate into myelin-forming cells and provide a potential therapy for severely injured peripheral nerves."
