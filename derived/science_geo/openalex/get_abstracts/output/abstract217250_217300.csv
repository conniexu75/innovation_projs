Since we had found low phosphatase activity for these reagents in many biological materials (2), there was the possibility, previously discussed (l), that the enzymatic hydrolysis of these substrates was a dual function of the purified wheat germ mutase. Further examination, however, showed there was no correlation between phosphatase and mutase activities at several stages of purification, indicating phosphatase contamination of the wheat germ mutase preparations. Additional evidence for the nonidentity of the two enzymatic activities has now been obtained by extensive purification of the phosphatase from wheat germ, by the method presented in this paper. The purified preparations of nonspecific acid phosphatase described in this paper have activities of the same order of magnitude as those of the extensively purified intestinal monoesterase (3) and of the crystalline pyrophosphatase of yeast (4). The best phosphatase preparations are essentially free of P-glycerate mutase activity."

Such changes are reversible if the antithyroid regime is discontinued. The antithyroid compounds that are naturally present in food are not regarded as causes of cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2145786134,It has been demonstrated in preliminary experiments that two strains of rat tumor cells (WRC-256 and TSAT-72) utilize alpha-2-globulin more selectively than other protein components of human serum. Cells of strain TSAT-72 show some utilization of beta-globulins also. Separate experiments demonstrated the utilization of glycoproteins by both strains.

https://openalex.org/W2087030749,"IT is well known that opalinids parasitizing the recta of Amphibia multiply asexually by binary fission during most of the year. During the breeding season, however, the reproductive pattern changes to a sexual one, the preliminary stages of which are marked by an increase in the multiplication-rate and the production of small forms and minute individuals. The latter eventually encyst and are passed out with the fæces of the frog. If ingested by tadpoles, they excyst, form micro- and macro-gametes, and the resulting zygotes give rise to the multinucleated opalinids in the newly metamorphosed frogs."

https://openalex.org/W2033847127,The titration curve of an aqueous solution of crystalline paramyosin shows a unique buffering zone which can be attributed to a shift in the pK of its glutamic acid residues. A possible explanation of this phenomenon on the basis of the presence of polyanionic segments in the molecule is discussed.

https://openalex.org/W1988632090,"THE inhibition of tobacco mosaic virus infection of primary bean leaves (Phaseolus vulgaris L. var. Pinto) by extracts of various portions of rice plants has been described recently1. The inhibitor or inhibitors present in rice resemble those derived from other plants such as spinach (Spinacea oleracea L.)2, poke weed (Phytolacca acinosa Roxb. var. esculenta)3, New Zealand spinach (Tetragonia expansa Murr.)4, and sweet william (Dianihus barbatus L.)5, in that the infection of test plants is inhibited when the plant extract and virus inoculum are mixed and applied simultaneously. The inhibitor in rice extracts differs in that it protects bean leaves against tobacco mosaic virus infection even when applied to the leaves (which are then rinsed with water) 1–3 days prior to inoculum application. In so far as we are aware, the only other plant extracts that protected test plants against virus infection were derived from carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L.)6, but the time between inhibitor application and inoculation was only 1–3 hr."

https://openalex.org/W1968196923,"DR. B. DAWES, in his recent communication1, has made an important contribution to our knowledge of the trematodes. In the interests of historical accuracy and in justice to a great nineteenth-century zoologist I would, however, like to point out that the life-histories of several trematodes, including that of Fasciola hepatica, were beautifully and accurately described by J. J. S. Steenstrup in his work “On the Alternation of Generations”, translated into English and published as a Ray Society monograph in 1845, nearly forty years before the work of R. Leuckartand A. P. Thomas. Steenstrup solved one of the most difficult of all zoological problems, and his ideas on the alternation of generations were considered so revolutionary that G. Buck, his translator and editor, thought fit to write an apologetic introduction to assuage the anger of his readers."
