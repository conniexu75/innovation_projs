https://openalex.org/W2147609603,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading inherited cause of autism and intellectual disability. Aberrant synaptic translation has been implicated in the etiology of FXS, but most lines of research on therapeutic strategies have targeted protein synthesis indirectly, far upstream of the translation machinery. We sought to perturb p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), a key translation initiation and elongation regulator, in FXS model mice. We found that genetic reduction of S6K1 prevented elevated phosphorylation of translational control molecules, exaggerated protein synthesis, enhanced mGluR-dependent long-term depression (LTD), weight gain, and macro-orchidism in FXS model mice. In addition, S6K1 deletion prevented immature dendritic spine morphology and multiple behavioral phenotypes, including social interaction deficits, impaired novel object recognition, and behavioral inflexibility. Our results support the model that dysregulated protein synthesis is the key causal factor in FXS and that restoration of normal translation can stabilize peripheral and neurological function in FXS."
https://openalex.org/W1992999803,"The ability to chronically monitor neuronal activity in the living brain is essential for understanding the organization and function of the nervous system. The genetically encoded green fluorescent protein-based calcium sensor GCaMP provides a powerful tool for detecting calcium transients in neuronal somata, processes, and synapses that are triggered by neuronal activities. Here we report the generation and characterization of transgenic mice that express improved GCaMPs in various neuronal subpopulations under the control of the Thy1 promoter. In vitro and in vivo studies show that calcium transients induced by spontaneous and stimulus-evoked neuronal activities can be readily detected at the level of individual cells and synapses in acute brain slices, as well as chronically in awake, behaving animals. These GCaMP transgenic mice allow investigation of activity patterns in defined neuronal populations in the living brain and will greatly facilitate dissecting complex structural and functional relationships of neural networks."

Here I draw from the animal and machine learning fields that describe attention as a mechanism for active learning and uncertainty reduction and explore the implications of this view for understanding visual attention and eye movement control. I propose that a closer integration of these different views has the potential greatly to expand our understanding of oculomotor control and our ability to use this system as a window into high level but poorly understood cognitive functions, including the capacity for curiosity and exploration and for inferring internal models of the external world."
https://openalex.org/W1985164700,"Background High rates of potentially pathogenic bacteria and respiratory viruses can be detected in the upper respiratory tract of healthy children. Investigating presence of and associations between these pathogens in healthy individuals is still a rather unexplored field of research, but may have implications for interpreting findings during disease. Methodology/Principal Findings We selected 986 nasopharyngeal samples from 433 6- to 24-month-old healthy children that had participated in a randomized controlled trial. We determined the presence of 20 common respiratory viruses using real-time PCR. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus were identified by conventional culture methods. Information on risk factors was obtained by questionnaires. We performed multivariate logistic regression analyses followed by partial correlation analysis to identify the overall pattern of associations. S. pneumoniae colonization was positively associated with the presence of H. influenzae (adjusted odds ratio 1.60, 95% confidence interval 1.18–2.16), M. catarrhalis (1.78, 1.29–2.47), human rhinoviruses (1.63, 1.19–2.22) and enteroviruses (1.97, 1.26–3.10), and negatively associated with S. aureus presence (0.59, 0.35–0.98). H. influenzae was positively associated with human rhinoviruses (1.63, 1.22–2.18) and respiratory syncytial viruses (2.78, 1.06–7.28). M. catarrhalis colonization was positively associated with coronaviruses (1.99, 1.01–3.93) and adenoviruses (3.69, 1.29–10.56), and negatively with S. aureus carriage (0.42, 0.25–0.69). We observed a strong positive association between S. aureus and influenza viruses (4.87, 1.59–14.89). In addition, human rhinoviruses and enteroviruses were positively correlated (2.40, 1.66–3.47), as were enteroviruses and human bocavirus, WU polyomavirus, parainfluenza viruses, and human parechovirus. A negative association was observed between human rhinoviruses and coronaviruses. Conclusions/Significance Our data revealed high viral and bacterial prevalence rates and distinct bacterial-bacterial, viral-bacterial and viral-viral associations in healthy children, hinting towards the complexity and potential dynamics of microbial communities in the upper respiratory tract. This warrants careful consideration when associating microbial presence with specific respiratory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2026459869,"Birthdate-dependent neuronal layering is fundamental to neocortical functions. The extracellular protein Reelin is essential for the establishment of the eventual neuronal alignments. Although this Reelin-dependent neuronal layering is mainly established by the final neuronal migration step called “terminal translocation” beneath the marginal zone (MZ), the molecular mechanism underlying the control by Reelin of terminal translocation and layer formation is largely unknown. Here, we show that after Reelin binds to its receptors, it activates integrin α5β1 through the intracellular Dab1-Crk/CrkL-C3G-Rap1 pathway. This intracellular pathway is required for terminal translocation and the activation of Reelin signaling promotes neuronal adhesion to fibronectin through integrin α5β1. Since fibronectin is localized in the MZ, the activated integrin α5β1 then controls terminal translocation, which mediates proper neuronal alignments in the mature cortex. These data indicate that Reelin-dependent activation of neuronal adhesion to the extracellular matrix is crucial for the eventual birth-date-dependent layering of the neocortex."
https://openalex.org/W2110850492,"Dairy cow mastitis is an important disease in the dairy industry. Different microbial species have been identified as causative agents in mastitis, and are traditionally diagnosed by bacterial culture. The objective of this study was to use metagenomic pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes to investigate bacterial DNA diversity in milk samples of mastitic and healthy dairy cows and compare the results with those obtained by classical bacterial culture. One hundred and thirty-six milk samples were collected from cows showing signs of mastitis and used for microbiological culture. Additionally, 20 milk samples were collected from healthy quarters. Bacterial DNA was isolated from the same milk samples and the 16S rRNA genes were individually amplified and pyrosequenced. Discriminant analysis showed that the groups of samples that were most clearly different from the rest and thus easily discriminated were the normal milk samples from healthy cows and those characterised by culture as Trueperella pyogenes and Streptococcus spp. The mastitis pathogens identified by culture were generally among the most frequent organisms detected by pyrosequencing, and in some cases (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Streptococcus uberis mastitis) the single most prevalent microorganism. Trueperella pyogenes sequences were the second most prevalent sequences in mastitis cases diagnosed as Trueperella pyogenes by culture, Streptococcus dysgalactiae sequences were the second most prevalent sequences in mastitis cases diagnosed as Streptococcus dysgalactiae by culture, and Staphyloccocus aureus sequences were the third most prevalent in mastitis cases diagnosed as Staphylococcus aureus by culture. In samples that were aerobic culture negative, pyrosequencing identified DNA of bacteria that are known to cause mastitis, DNA of bacteria that are known pathogens but have so far not been associated with mastitis, and DNA of bacteria that are currently not known to be pathogens. A possible role of anaerobic pathogens in bovine mastitis is also suggested."

However, associations with cognitive performance are not known.To estimate the associations between different sedentary behaviors and cognitive performance in healthy older adults.Computer use, time spent watching television (TV), time spent reading and habitual physical activity levels were self-reported twice (in 2001 and 2007) by participants in the SUpplémentation en Vitamines et MinérauX (SU.VI.MAX and SU.VI.MAX2) study. Cognitive performance was assessed at follow-up (in 2007-2009) via a battery of 6 neuropsychological tests used to derive verbal memory and executive functioning scores. Analyses (ANCOVA) were performed among 1425 men and 1154 women aged 65.6 ± 4.5 at the time of the neuropsychological evaluation. We estimated mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) in cognitive performance across categories of each type of sedentary behavior.In multivariable cross-sectional models, compared to non-users, participants using the computer for >1 h/day displayed better verbal memory (mean difference=1.86; 95%CI: 0.95, 2.77) and executive functioning (mean difference=2.15; 95%CI: 1.22, 3.08). A negative association was also observed between TV viewing and executive functioning. Additionally, participants who increased their computer use by more than 30 min between 2001 and 2007 showed better performance on both verbal memory (mean difference=1.41; 95%CI: 0.55, 2.27) and executive functioning (mean difference=1.41; 95%CI: 0.53, 2.28) compared to those who decreased their computer use during that period.Specific sedentary behaviors are differentially associated with cognitive performance.

In countries with a high HIV prevalence, it is unknown how increased antiretroviral treatment and care (ART) coverage has affected the prevalence of overweight, obesity, and hypertension. We conducted a health survey in 2010 based on the WHO STEPwise approach in 14,198 adult resident participants of a demographic surveillance area in rural South Africa to investigate factors associated with hypertension and excess weight including HIV infection and ART status. Women had a significantly higher median body mass index (BMI) than men (26.4 vs. 21.2 kg/m2, p<0.001). The prevalence of obesity (BMI≥30 kg/m2) in women (31.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 30.2–32.4) was 6.5 times higher than in men (4.9%, 95% CI 4.1–5.7), whereas prevalence of hypertension (systolic or diastolic blood pressure≥140 or 90 mm Hg, respectively) was 1.4 times higher in women than in men (28.5% vs 20.8%, p<0.001). In multivariable regression analysis, both hypertension and obesity were significantly associated with sex, age, HIV and ART status. The BMI of women and men on ART was on average 3.8 (95% CI 3.2–3.8) and 1.7 (95% CI 0.9–2.5) kg/m2 lower than of HIV-negative women and men, respectively. The BMI of HIV-infected women and men not on ART was on average 1.2 (95% CI 0.8–1.6) and 0.4 (95% CI -0.1–0.9) kg/m2 lower than of HIV-negative women and men, respectively. Obesity was a bigger risk factor for hypertension in men (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.99, 95% CI 2.00–4.48) than in women (aOR 1.64, 95% CI 1.39–1.92) and overweight (25≤BMI<30) was a significant risk factor for men only (aOR 1.53 95% CI 1.14–2.06). Our study suggests that, cardiovascular risk factors of hypertension and obesity differ substantially between women and men in rural South Africa."

Three of the four Robo receptors that are encoded in the mammalian genome are expressed in the CNS, with Robo1 and Robo2 displaying the most widespread patterns in the developing brain (Marillat et al., 2001Marillat V. Cases O. Nguyen Ba-Charvet K.T. Tessier-Lavigne M. Sotelo C. Chédotal A. Spatiotemporal expression patterns of slit and robo genes in the rat brain.J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 442: 130-155Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Slits are the principal ligands for the Robo receptors (Kidd et al., 1999Kidd T. Bland K.S. Goodman C.S. Slit is the midline repellent for the robo receptor in Drosophila.Cell. 1999; 96: 785-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar), to which they bind in association with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (Hu, 2001Hu H. Cell-surface heparan sulfate is involved in the repulsive guidance activities of Slit2 protein.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). There are three Slit genes in mammals, and all of them are expressed in developing CNS (Marillat et al., 2001Marillat V. Cases O. Nguyen Ba-Charvet K.T. Tessier-Lavigne M. Sotelo C. Chédotal A.

The functions of Robo receptors have been classically studied in postmitotic cells, most typically in neurons. However, Robo receptors also seem to be expressed in progenitor cells, at least in some regions of the developing brain (Marillat et al., 2001Marillat V. Cases O. Nguyen Ba-Charvet K.T.

A few studies have even hinted at a possible role for Robo receptors in neurogenesis (Andrews et al., 2008Andrews W. Barber M. Hernadez-Miranda L.R. Xian J. Rakić S. Sundaresan V. Rabbitts T.H. Pannell R. Rabbitts P. Thompson H. et al.The role of Slit-Robo signaling in the generation, migration and morphological differentiation of cortical interneurons.Dev. Biol. 2008; 313: 648-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar; Mehta and Bhat, 2001Mehta B. Bhat K.M. Slit signaling promotes the terminal asymmetric division of neural precursor cells in the Drosophila CNS.Development. 2001; 128: 3161-3168PubMed Google Scholar), but the precise mechanisms through which Slit signaling may control this process are unknown. In Drosophila, slit seems to modulate neurogenesis by promoting asymmetric terminal divisions in particular neural lineages (Mehta and Bhat, 2001Mehta B. Bhat K.M. Slit signaling promotes the terminal asymmetric division of neural precursor cells in the Drosophila CNS.Development. 2001; 128: 3161-3168PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the highly conserved roles of Slits and their Robo receptors in evolution (Brose and Tessier-Lavigne, 2000Brose K. Tessier-Lavigne M. Slit proteins: key regulators of axon guidance, axonal branching, and cell migration.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that Slit/Robo signaling may play a similar role in the vertebrate brain. Here we have tested the hypothesis that Slit/Robo signaling may contribute to regulate neurogenesis in the mammalian CNS. We focused most of our analysis in the developing cerebral cortex, for which the cellular mechanisms of neurogenesis are beginning to be elucidated (Fietz and Huttner, 2011Fietz S.A. Huttner W.B. Cortical progenitor expansion, self-renewal and neurogenesis-a polarized perspective.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2011; 21: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar; Noctor et al., 2007Noctor S.C.

Role of intermediate progenitor cells in cerebral cortex development.Dev. Neurosci. 2008; 30: 24-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). During early phases of neurogenesis, cortical progenitor cells residing in the ventricular zone (VZ) divide symmetrically to increase the pool of dividing cells. As neurogenesis progresses, VZ progenitors begin to divide asymmetrically to self-renew and produce new neurons or, more frequently, to generate IPCs. These progenitors, which localize to the subventricular zone (SVZ), will generate additional neurons after one or more rounds of divisions. This two-step process of neurogenesis is highly reminiscent to that observed during the development of the CNS in Drosophila (Skeath and Thor, 2003Skeath J.B. Thor S. Genetic control of Drosophila nerve cord development.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms controlling these dynamics remain poorly characterized. We found that progenitor cells throughout the entire mouse brain and spinal cord transiently express Robo1 and Robo2, in particular during early stages of neurogenesis. Analysis of Robo1 and Robo2 double (Robo1/2) mutants revealed that these receptors are required to maintain the proper balance between primary and intermediate progenitors, because loss of Robo signaling leads to a decrease in VZ progenitors and a concomitant increase in the number of IPCs. Slit proteins likely mediate this function, because similar defects were found in Slit1 and Slit2 double (Slit1/2) mutants. We found that Robo receptors maintain cortical progenitor balance through interaction with the Notch pathway by controlling Hes1 transcription. Our study uncovers a novel role for Slit/Robo signaling in progenitor cells, which expands the vast repertoire of biological functions already attributed to this highly conserved pathway. We have previously reported that Robo1/2 mutants are essential for the development of major axonal projections in the mouse-developing forebrain (López-Bendito et al., 2007López-Bendito G. Flames N. Ma L. Fouquet C. Di Meglio T. Chedotal A. Tessier-Lavigne M. Marín O. Robo1 and Robo2 cooperate to control the guidance of major axonal tracts in the mammalian forebrain.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 3395-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). As part of this analysis, we found that the brain of Robo1/2 mutants is smaller than controls at birth (Figure 1A). For example, the volume of the telencephalon and thalamus in Robo1/2 mutants was consistently smaller than controls as early as E14.5 (Figures 1C–1G; data not shown). The thickness of the neocortex was also significantly reduced in Robo1/2 mutants compared to controls (Figures 1D, 1F, and 1G). Despite this difference, layer formation in the developing cortex seems to proceed normally (Figures 1B and S1 available online). We reasoned that the prominent axon guidance defects that exist in Robo1/2 mutants could explain part of the size differences observed in our analyses (López-Bendito et al., 2007López-Bendito G. Flames N. Ma L. Fouquet C. Di Meglio T. Chedotal A. Tessier-Lavigne M. Marín O. Robo1 and Robo2 cooperate to control the guidance of major axonal tracts in the mammalian forebrain.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 3395-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, we also noticed that the cortical germinal epithelium of Robo1/2 mutants was much thinner than that of control brains at birth (red brackets in Figures 1B, 1D, and 1F). Since these defects could not be simply explained by defective axons, this finding prompted us to study a possible role of Robo signaling in neural progenitors. To assess a possible role for Robo receptors in neural precursor cells, we first examined the expression of Robo1 and Robo2 messenger RNA (mRNA) in progenitor regions throughout the developing CNS. We found that Robo1 and Robo2 are expressed in most progenitor epithelia in the developing forebrain (E12.5) and spinal cord (E9.5) (red asterisks in Figures 2A–2F ), although different regions predominantly express one of the receptors. For example, progenitor cells in the VZ of the developing pallium express relatively high Robo2 mRNA levels (Figures 2C, 2D, and S2A–S2J), while Robo1 is more abundantly expressed in the VZ of the medial and lateral ganglionic eminences (MGE and LGE, respectively; Figures 2C, 2D, and S2A–S2J). Consistently, immunohistochemical experiments revealed expression of Robo2 in the VZ of the cortex with barely detectable levels of Robo1 (Figures 2G and 2J). Nevertheless, semiquantitative RT-PCR and western blot analyses in tissue obtained from the cortex of E10.5 embryos revealed expression of both receptors (Figures S2K and S2L). These results confirmed the presence of Robo1 and Robo2 in progenitor cells, because the mouse cerebral cortex is almost entirely devoid of neurons at this early stage. We also discovered that the expression of Robo receptors in progenitor regions followed a very dynamic pattern. For instance, Robo1 and Robo2 were found in the VZ of the developing telencephalon as early as E10.5, but their expression declined with age and was almost absent, except for discrete sites, after E14.5 (Figures S2A–S2J). This temporal course of expression in progenitor cells suggested that Robo receptors might primarily influence dividing cells at early stages of neurogenesis. To directly test this hypothesis, we examined the density of dividing cells (number of mitotic cells per length of VZ) in different regions of the CNS in control and Robo1/2 mutants. We found that the density of progenitor cells in mitosis, as revealed with the M-phase marker phospho-Histone H3 (PH3), was consistently reduced in all regions examined, including the spinal cord, thalamus, MGE and LGE, and cortex (Figures 2H, 2I, 2K, and S3). Thus, Robo1 and Robo2 receptors are expressed in progenitor cells throughout the CNS, and their simultaneous deletion leads to a decrease in the density of dividing VZ cells during early stages of neurogenesis. To analyze the basis of this phenotype, we focused our analysis in the developing neocortex. We reasoned that a smaller density of mitoses in the VZ of the cortex could impact on the rate of VZ progenitor self-renewal, thus leading to reduced numbers of VZ progenitor cells and, consequently, to a less extensive VZ. Consistent with this prediction, we found that the length of the cortical VZ was significantly smaller in E11.5 and E12.5 Robo1/2 mutant embryos compared to controls (Figures 2L–2N). One possible explanation for the reduced density of mitoses could be that loss of Robo1/2 leads to increased cell death in VZ progenitors. However, quantification of the density of apoptotic cells (identified by expression of cleaved Caspase 3) revealed no differences between control and Robo1/2 mutants (control: 6.2 ± 0.7 cells/mm, n = 4; mutant: 7.6 ± 0.8 cells/mm; n = 4, mean ± SEM, p = 0.23). Thus, the reduced length of ventricular lining observed in Robo1/2 mutants does not seem to arise as a consequence of enhanced cell death. The decreased density of VZ mitoses found in Robo1/2 mutants at these early stages of neurogenesis could also be caused by a shift in the type of division occurring at the VZ, from symmetric to asymmetric. In other words, instead of expanding the pool of dividing cells, VZ cells might have a higher tendency to prematurely produce neurons or IPCs in Robo1/2 mutants. To test this idea, we analyzed the thickness of the postmitotic neuronal layer using neuron-specific antibodies against β-III-Tubulin, TuJ1. We found no significant differences between control and Robo1/2 mutants (control: 33.5 ± 2.0 μm, n = 12; mutant: 30.4 ± 2.0 μm; n = 15, mean ± SEM, p = 0.29) (Figures 3C and 3D), thus suggesting no changes in neuron production at E12.5. In contrast, quantification of the number of IPCs, as revealed by the expression of the T-box transcription factor Tbr2 (Pontious et al., 2008Pontious A. Kowalczyk T. Englund C. Hevner R.F. Role of intermediate progenitor cells in cerebral cortex development.Dev. Neurosci. 2008; 30: 24-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), showed that the cortex of Robo1/2 mutants contains almost twice as many Tbr2+ cells as controls at E12.5 (Figures 3A–3E). Because Tbr2 may also label some differentiating neurons (Pontious et al., 2008Pontious A. Kowalczyk T. Englund C. Hevner R.F. Role of intermediate progenitor cells in cerebral cortex development.Dev. Neurosci. 2008; 30: 24-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), we next analyzed the fraction of these cells that also expressed the proliferation marker Ki67. We observed that the number of Tbr2+ progenitor cells (IPCs) in the cortex of Robo1/2 mutants was almost double than in controls at E12.5 (Figures 3F–3H). Thus loss of Robo1/2 function leads to a depletion of VZ progenitors and to an abnormal increase in the numbers of IPCs in the developing cerebral cortex. Analysis of Robo1 and Robo2 single mutant embryos revealed that the phenotypic changes found in the cortex of Robo1/2 mutants were primarily due to the loss of Robo2 (Figure S4). Nevertheless, the raise in the number of IPCs found in Robo2 single mutants is milder than in Robo1/2 double mutants, which suggested that Robo1 cooperates with Robo2 in regulating the production of IPCs. Altogether, these results indicated that Robo receptors modulate neurogenesis in the developing brain. Slit proteins are the ligands of Robo receptors in cell guidance, and so we tested whether Slits also mediate the function of Robo receptors in neurogenesis. Analysis of the distribution of Slit1 and Slit2 mRNA at different developmental stages revealed multiple sources of Slit proteins that could influence telencephalic progenitor cells (Figures 4A, 4B, and S5A–S5J). We were particularly intrigued by the expression of Slits in the choroid plexus and in other cells lining the ventricle, because recent work suggests that factors present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) modulate the proliferation of cortical progenitor cells (Lehtinen et al., 2011Lehtinen M.K. Zappaterra M.W. Chen X. Yang Y.J. Hill A.D. Lun M. Maynard T. Gonzalez D. Kim S. Ye P. et al.The cerebrospinal fluid provides a proliferative niche for neural progenitor cells.Neuron. 2011; 69: 893-905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, we found that Slit proteins are indeed present in the CSF of mouse embryos at E12.5 (Figure 4C). We also observed that a recombinant Slit2-alkaline phosphatase fusion protein (Slit2-AP) binds homogenously throughout the ventricular surface of E12.5 telencephalic hemispheres (Figure 4D). This experiment reinforced the idea that Slits present in the CSF may bind to Robo receptors expressed by progenitor cells in contact with the ventricle, thereby modulating neurogenesis at early stages of cortical development. To directly test the function of Slits in regulating the proliferation of cortical progenitors, we analyzed progenitor cell dynamics in Slit mutants. Analysis of Slit1 and Slit2 single mutant embryos revealed no differences in the density of PH3+ VZ progenitor cells or in the number of Tbr2+ IPCs (Figures S5K– S5R). In contrast, we found that the density of PH3+ nuclei in the VZ of the developing cortex was reduced in Slit1/2 double mutants compared to controls (Figures 4E, 4F, and 4I). In addition, we observed that the amount of Tbr2+ cells was greatly increased in Slit1/2 double mutants compared to controls (Figures 4G–4I). These results demonstrate that simultaneous loss of Slit1 and Slit2 causes a similar phenotype to that found in Robo1/2 mutants, which reinforces the view that Slit/Robo signaling modulates early neurogenesis. IPCs may divide symmetrically to generate two new IPCs, but most frequently they produce a pair of newborn neurons (Haubensak et al., 2004Haubensak W. Attardo A. Denk W. Huttner W.B. Neurons arise in the basal neuroepithelium of the early mammalian telencephalon: a major site of neurogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 3196-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar; Huttner and Kosodo, 2005Huttner W.B. Kosodo Y.

Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar; Noctor et al., 2004Noctor S.C. Martínez-Cerdeño V. Ivic L. Kriegstein A.R. Cortical neurons arise in symmetric and asymmetric division zones and migrate through specific phases.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). However, neurogenesis did not seem to increase in Robo1/2 and Slit1/2 mutants, despite the prominent expansion in the pool of IPCs (Figures 3C, 3D, 4H, and 4I). This suggested that IPCs fail to produce a normal complement of neurons in the absence of Slit/Robo signaling. Consistent with this view, analysis of the fraction of cells leaving the mitotic cycle (quitting fraction) revealed a prominent decrease in Robo1/2 mutants compared to controls (Figures 3I–3K). Furthermore, although IPCs are more abundant in the cortex of Robo1/2 mutants than controls, quantification of the number of mitoses in basal (SVZ) positions revealed no differences between control and Robo1/2 mutants (Figures 2H, 2I, and 2K). Together, these experiments suggested that IPCs divide less frequently in Robo1/2 mutants. To confirm this hypothesis, we measured the length of the cell cycle of IPCs. We found that cell cycle length is significantly longer in Robo1/2 mutants than in controls (control Tc: 11.5 hr; mutant Tc: 14.6 hr) (Figure S6A), while no differences where observed in the process of interkinetic nuclear migration (Figures S6B–S6H). In sum, loss of Robo1/2 signaling causes an overproduction of IPCs in the cerebral cortex, but this defect does not lead to enhanced neurogenesis, because they divide at a slow rate. To gain further insight into the cellular mechanisms underlying these defects, we next performed a clonal analysis of progenitor cells in the cerebral cortex of control and Robo1/2 mutants. Using ultrasound-guided imaging, we made intraventricular injections of low-titer green fluorescent protein (Gfp)-expressing retrovirus at E11.5 to mark individual cortical progenitor cells and analyzed their clonal progeny at E13.5 (Figures 5A–5E and S7A–S7E′). First, we found that large clones were relatively more abundant in Robo1/2 mutants than in controls (Figure S7F), consistent with our previous observation that cell cycle exit is reduced in the cortex of Robo1/2 mutants (Figures 3I–3K). Despite this variation in clone size, the number of postmitotic TuJ1+ neurons per clone did not differ between controls and mutants (Figures 5B–5E, 5H, and S7G), which suggested that individual clones in Robo1/2 mutants contain more progenitors than in controls. Consistent with this idea, we observed that Tbr2+ cells were more abundant in individual clones from Robo1/2 mutants than in controls (Figure 5H). We next examined whether Robo1/2 signaling influences progenitor dynamics in a cell-autonomous manner. To this end, we performed a new series of clonal tracing experiments in wild-type embryos using retroviruses encoding Gfp and a dominant negative variant of Robo2 (DN-Robo2, Figure 6A) (Stein and Tessier-Lavigne, 2001Stein E. Tessier-Lavigne M. Hierarchical organization of guidance receptors: silencing of netrin attraction by slit through a Robo/DCC receptor complex.Science. 2001; 291: 1928-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Analysis of individual clones derived from cortical progenitor cells revealed that expression of DN-Robo2 causes very similar defects to those observed in Robo1/2 mutants. For example, Tbr2+ cells were more abundant in individual clones expressing DN-Robo2 than in controls, whereas the total number of postmitotic TuJ1+ cells remained unchanged (Figures 6B–6F). In reciprocal experiments, we used in utero electroporation to overexpress a plasmid encoding a myristoylated form of the cytoplasmic domain of Robo2 (mR2), which acts as a constitutively active form of the receptor (Figure 6G) (Bai et al., 2011Bai G. Chivatakarn O. Bonanomi D. Lettieri K. Franco L. Xia C. Stein E. Ma L. Lewcock J.W. Pfaff S.L. Presenilin-dependent receptor processing is required for axon guidance.Cell. 2011; 144: 106-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous results, we observed that increased Robo signaling significantly reduces the fraction of Tbr2+ cells among the electroporated cells (Figures 6H–6J). Altogether, these gain and loss of function experiments demonstrated that Robo receptors modulate progenitor cell dynamics in a cell-autonomous manner. The clonal analysis of progenitor cells in the cerebral cortex also revealed that Robo1/2 mutant clones (Figures 5B–5E, 5H, and S7H) and DN-Robo2-expressing clones (Figures 6B–6F) contained many more progenitor cells with an apical process than control clones.

https://openalex.org/W2011382233,"At neuronal excitatory synapses, two major subtypes of the synaptic adhesion molecule neuroligin are present. These subtypes, neuroligin 1 and neuroligin 3, have roles in synaptogenesis and synaptic maintenance that appear largely overlapping. In this study, we combine electrophysiology with molecular deletion and replacement of these proteins to identify similarities and differences between these subtypes. In doing so, we identify a subtype-specific role in LTP for neuroligin 1 in young CA1, which persists into adulthood in the dentate gyrus. As neuroligin 3 showed no requirement for LTP, we constructed chimeric proteins of the two excitatory neuroligin subtypes to identify the molecular determinants particular to the unique function of neuroligin 1. Using in vivo molecular replacement experiments, we find that these unique functions depend on a region in its extracellular domain containing the B site splice insertion previously shown to determine specificity of neurexin binding."
https://openalex.org/W2010097255,"Long-term memory and synaptic plasticity are thought to require the synthesis of new proteins at activated synapses. The CPEB family of RNA binding proteins, including Drosophila Orb2, has been implicated in this process. The precise mechanism by which these molecules regulate memory formation is however poorly understood. We used gene targeting and site-specific transgenesis to specifically modify the endogenous orb2 gene in order to investigate its role in long-term memory formation. We show that the Orb2A and Orb2B isoforms, while both essential, have distinct functions in memory formation. These two isoforms have common glutamine-rich and RNA-binding domains, yet Orb2A uniquely requires the former and Orb2B the latter. We further show that Orb2A induces Orb2 complexes in a manner dependent upon both its glutamine-rich region and neuronal activity. We propose that Orb2B acts as a conventional CPEB to regulate transport and/or translation of specific mRNAs, whereas Orb2A acts in an unconventional manner to form stable Orb2 complexes that are essential for memory to persist."
https://openalex.org/W2081547268,"One of the main findings derived from the analysis of the Neandertal genome was the evidence for admixture between Neandertals and non-African modern humans. An alternative scenario is that the ancestral population of non-Africans was closer to Neandertals than to Africans because of ancient population substructure. Thus, the study of North African populations is crucial for testing both hypotheses. We analyzed a total of 780,000 SNPs in 125 individuals representing seven different North African locations and searched for their ancestral/derived state in comparison to different human populations and Neandertals. We found that North African populations have a significant excess of derived alleles shared with Neandertals, when compared to sub-Saharan Africans. This excess is similar to that found in non-African humans, a fact that can be interpreted as a sign of Neandertal admixture. Furthermore, the Neandertal's genetic signal is higher in populations with a local, pre-Neolithic North African ancestry. Therefore, the detected ancient admixture is not due to recent Near Eastern or European migrations. Sub-Saharan populations are the only ones not affected by the admixture event with Neandertals."
https://openalex.org/W2031788619,"The extracellular signaling protein Reelin, indispensable for proper neuronal migration and cortical layering during development, is also expressed in the adult brain where it modulates synaptic functions. It has been shown that proteolytic processing of Reelin decreases its signaling activity and promotes Reelin aggregation in vitro, and that proteolytic processing is affected in various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, neither the pathophysiological significance of dysregulated Reelin cleavage, nor the involved proteases and their modulators are known. Here we identified the serine protease tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and two matrix metalloproteinases, ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5, as Reelin cleaving enzymes. Moreover, we assessed the influence of several endogenous protease inhibitors, including tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), α-2-Macroglobulin, and multiple serpins, as well as matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) on Reelin cleavage, and described their complex interplay in the regulation of this process. Finally, we could demonstrate that in the murine hippocampus, the expression levels and localization of Reelin proteases largely overlap with that of Reelin. While this pattern remained stable during normal aging, changes in their protein levels coincided with accelerated Reelin aggregation in a mouse model of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2031357962,"Using transposon-mediated gene-trap mutagenesis, we have generated a novel mouse mutant termed Blad (Bloated Bladder). Homozygous mutant mice die perinatally showing a greatly distended bladder, underdeveloped diaphragm and a reduction in total skeletal muscle mass. Wild type and heterozygote mice appear normal. Using PCR, we identified a transposon insertion site in the first intron of Nmnat2 (Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenyltransferase 2). Nmnat2 is expressed predominantly in the brain and nervous system and has been linked to the survival of axons. Expression of this gene is undetectable in Nmnat2(blad/blad) mutants. Examination of the brains of E18.5 Nmnat2(blad/blad) mutant embryos did not reveal any obvious morphological changes. In contrast, E18.5 Nmnat2(blad/blad) homozygotes showed an approximate 60% reduction of spinal motoneurons in the lumbar region and a more than 80% reduction in the sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). In addition, facial motoneuron numbers were severely reduced, and there was virtually a complete absence of axons in the hind limb. Our observations suggest that during embryogenesis, Nmnat2 plays an important role in axonal growth or maintenance. It appears that in the absence of Nmnat2, major target organs and tissues (e.g., muscle) are not functionally innervated resulting in perinatal lethality. In addition, neither Nmnat1 nor 3 can compensate for the loss of Nmnat2. Whilst there have been recent suggestions that Nmnat2 may be an endogenous modulator of axon integrity, this work represents the first in vivo study demonstrating that Nmnat2 is involved in axon development or survival in a mammal."

Morphological analysis showed that phage KPP12 is a member of the family Myoviridae, morphotype A1, and DNA sequence analysis revealed that phage KPP12 is similar to PB1-like viruses. Analysis of the phage KPP12 genome did not identify any genes related to drug resistance, pathogenicity or lysogenicity, and so phage KPP12 may be a good candidate for therapeutic. KPP12 showed a broad host range for P. aeruginosa strains isolated from clinical ophthalmic infections. Inoculation of the scarified cornea with P. aeruginosa caused severe keratitis and eventual corneal perforation. Subsequent single-dose administration of KPP12 eye-drops significantly improved disease outcome, and preserved the structural integrity and transparency of the infected cornea. KPP12 treatment resulted in the suppression of neutrophil infiltration and greatly enhanced bacterial clearance in the infected cornea. These results indicate that bacteriophage eye-drops may be a novel adjunctive or alternative therapeutic agent for the treatment of infectious keratitis secondary to antibiotic-resistant bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2075946461,"Despite increased risk of a recurrent stroke following a minor stroke, information is minimal regarding the interaction between injurious mild cerebral ischemic episodes and the possible treatments which might be effective. The aim of the current study was to investigate recurrent ischemic stroke and whether resveratrol, a nutritive polyphenol with promising cardio- and neuro- protective properties, could ameliorate the associated brain damage. Experiments in adult rats demonstrated that a mild ischemic stroke followed by a second mild cerebral ischemia exacerbated brain damage, and, daily oral resveratrol treatment after the first ischemic insult reduced ischemic cell death with the recurrent insult (P<0.002). Further investigation demonstrated reduction of both inflammatory changes and markers of oxidative stress in resveratrol treated animals. The protection observed with resveratrol treatment could not be explained by systemic effects of resveratrol treatment including effects either on blood pressure or body temperature measured telemetrically. Investigation of resveratrol effects on the blood-brain barrier in vivo demonstrated that resveratrol treatment reduced blood-brain barrier disruption and edema following recurrent stroke without affecting regional cerebral blood flow. Investigation of the mechanism in primary cell culture studies demonstrated that resveratrol treatment significantly protected endothelial cells against an in vitro ‘ischemia’ resulting in improved viability against oxygen and glucose deprivation (39.6±6.6% and 81.3±9.5% in vehicle and resveratrol treated cells, respectively). An inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis did not prevent the improved cell viability following oxygen glucose deprivation but SIRT-1 inhibition with sirtinol partially blocked the protection (P<0.001) suggesting endothelial protection is to some extent SIRT-1 dependent. Collectively, the results support that oral resveratrol treatment provides a low risk strategy to protect the brain from enhanced damage produced by recurrent stroke which is mediated in part by a protective effect of resveratrol on the endothelium of the cerebrovasculature."
https://openalex.org/W2162897126,"Male infertility is a major cause of problems for many couples in conceiving a child. Recently, lifestyle pastimes such as alcohol, tobacco and marijuana have been shown to have further negative effects on male reproduction. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), mainly through the action of anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) at cannabinoid (CB1, CB2) and vanilloid (TRPV1) receptors, plays a crucial role in controlling functionality of sperm, with a clear impact on male reproductive potential. Here, sperm from fertile and infertile men were used to investigate content (through LC-ESI-MS), mRNA (through quantitative RT-PCR), protein (through Western Blotting and ELISA) expression, and functionality (through activity and binding assays) of the main metabolic enzymes of AEA and 2-AG (NAPE-PLD and FAAH, for AEA; DAGL and MAGL for 2-AG), as well as of their binding receptors CB1, CB2 and TRPV1. Our findings show a marked reduction of AEA and 2-AG content in infertile seminal plasma, paralleled by increased degradation: biosynthesis ratios of both substances in sperm from infertile versus fertile men. In addition, TRPV1 binding was detected in fertile sperm but was undetectable in infertile sperm, whereas that of CB1 and CB2 receptors was not statistically different in the two groups. In conclusion, this study identified unprecedented alterations of the ECS in infertile sperm, that might impact on capacitation and acrosome reaction, and hence fertilization outcomes. These alterations might also point to new biomarkers to determine male reproductive defects, and identify distinct ECS elements as novel targets for therapeutic exploitation of ECS-oriented drugs to treat male fertility problems."
https://openalex.org/W2008826521,"The tau and amyloid pathobiological processes underlying Alzheimer disease (AD) progresses slowly over periods of decades before clinical manifestation as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), then more rapidly to dementia, and eventually to end-stage organ failure. The failure of clinical trials of candidate disease modifying therapies to slow disease progression in patients already diagnosed with early AD has led to increased interest in exploring the possibility of early intervention and prevention trials, targeting MCI and cognitively healthy (HC) populations. Here, we stratify MCI individuals based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and structural atrophy risk factors for the disease. We also stratify HC individuals into risk groups on the basis of CSF biomarkers for the two hallmark AD pathologies. Results show that the broad category of MCI can be decomposed into subsets of individuals with significantly different average regional atrophy rates. By thus selectively identifying individuals, combinations of these biomarkers and risk factors could enable significant reductions in sample size requirements for clinical trials of investigational AD-modifying therapies, and provide stratification mechanisms to more finely assess response to therapy. Power is sufficiently high that detecting efficacy in MCI cohorts should not be a limiting factor in AD therapeutics research. In contrast, we show that sample size estimates for clinical trials aimed at the preclinical stage of the disorder (HCs with evidence of AD pathology) are prohibitively large. Longer natural history studies are needed to inform design of trials aimed at the presymptomatic stage."

Methods TE was performed at baseline, and at weeks 24, 48, and 72 in 515 patients with CHC. Results 323 treated (62.7%) and 192 untreated patients (37.3%) were assessed. LS experienced a significant decline in treated patients and remained stable in untreated patients at the end of study (P<0.0001). The decline was significant for patients with baseline LS ≥ 7.1 kPa (P<0.0001 and P 0.03, for LS ≥9.5 and ≥7.1 kPa vs lower values, respectively). Sustained virological responders and relapsers had a significant LS improvement whereas a trend was observed in nonresponders (mean percent change −16%, −10% and −2%, for SVR, RR and NR, respectively, P 0.03 for SVR vs NR).

We tested whether the expression of microRNA 21 (miR-21) is modulated by stretch and is involved in stretch-induced proliferation and apoptosis of human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs).RT-PCR revealed that elevated stretch (16% elongation, 1 Hz) increased miR-21 expression in cultured HASMCs, and moderate stretch (10% elongation, 1 Hz) decreased the expression. BrdU incorporation assay and cell counting showed miR-21 involved in the proliferation of HASMCs mediated by stretch, likely by regulating the expression of p27 and phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (p-Rb). FACS analysis revealed that the complex of miR-21 and programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4) participated in regulating apoptosis with stretch. Stretch increased the expression of primary miR-21 and pre-miR-21 in HASMCs. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrated that stretch increased NF-κB and AP-1 activities in HASMCs, and blockade of AP-1 activity by c-jun siRNA significantly suppressed stretch-induced miR-21 expression.Cyclic stretch modulates miR-21 expression in cultured HASMCs, and miR-21 plays important roles in regulating proliferation and apoptosis mediated by stretch.

We investigated a typical arid region with widespread saline/alkaline soils, and evaluated soil respiration of different agricultural and natural ecosystems. Soil respiration for five ecosystems together with soil temperature, soil moisture, soil pH, soil electric conductivity and soil organic carbon content were investigated in the field. Comparing with the natural ecosystems, the mean seasonal soil respiration rates of the agricultural ecosystems were 96%–386% higher and agricultural ecosystems exhibited lower CO2 absorption by the saline/alkaline soil. Soil temperature and moisture together explained 48%, 86%, 84%, 54% and 54% of the seasonal variations of soil respiration in the five ecosystems, respectively. There was a significant negative relationship between soil respiration and soil electrical conductivity, but a weak correlation between soil respiration and soil pH or soil organic carbon content. Our results showed that soil CO2 emissions were significantly different among different agricultural and natural ecosystems, although we caution that this was an observational, not manipulative, study. Temperature at the soil surface and electric conductivity were the main driving factors of soil respiration across the five ecosystems.

https://openalex.org/W1972988663,"Rod photoreceptors generate amplified, reproducible responses to single photons via a G protein signaling cascade. Surprisingly, genetic perturbations that dramatically alter the deactivation of the principal signal amplifier, the GPCR rhodopsin (R∗), do not much alter the amplitude of single-photon responses (SPRs). These same perturbations, when crossed into a line lacking calcium feedback regulation of cGMP synthesis, produced much larger alterations in SPR amplitudes. Analysis of SPRs from rods with and without feedback reveal that the consequences of trial-to-trial fluctuations in R∗ lifetime in normal rods are also dampened by feedback regulation of cGMP synthesis. Thus, calcium feedback trumps the mechanisms of R∗ deactivation in determining the SPR amplitude, attenuating responses arising from longer R∗ lifetimes to a greater extent than those arising from shorter ones. As a result, rod SPRs achieve a more stereotyped amplitude, a characteristic considered important for reliable transmission through the visual system."
https://openalex.org/W1988005228,"Background Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is caused by ∼1,900 mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene encoding for a cAMP-regulated chloride (Cl−) channel expressed in several epithelia. Clinical features are dominated by respiratory symptoms, but there is variable organ involvement thus causing diagnostic dilemmas, especially for non-classic cases. Methodology/Principal Findings To further establish measurement of CFTR function as a sensitive and robust biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of CF, we herein assessed cholinergic and cAMP-CFTR-mediated Cl− secretion in 524 freshly excised rectal biopsies from 118 individuals, including patients with confirmed CF clinical diagnosis (n = 51), individuals with clinical CF suspicion (n = 49) and age-matched non-CF controls (n = 18). Conclusive measurements were obtained for 96% of cases. Patients with “Classic CF”, presenting earlier onset of symptoms, pancreatic insufficiency, severe lung disease and low Shwachman-Kulczycki scores were found to lack CFTR-mediated Cl− secretion (<5%). Individuals with milder CF disease presented residual CFTR-mediated Cl− secretion (10–57%) and non-CF controls show CFTR-mediated Cl− secretion ≥30–35% and data evidenced good correlations with various clinical parameters. Finally, comparison of these values with those in “CF suspicion” individuals allowed to confirm CF in 16/49 individuals (33%) and exclude it in 28/49 (57%). Statistical discriminant analyses showed that colonic measurements of CFTR-mediated Cl− secretion are the best discriminator among Classic/Non-Classic CF and non-CF groups. Conclusions/Significance Determination of CFTR-mediated Cl− secretion in rectal biopsies is demonstrated here to be a sensitive, reproducible and robust predictive biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of CF. The method also has very high potential for (pre-)clinical trials of CFTR-modulator therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1965781889,"Purpose This study investigates physical performance limitations for sports and daily activities in recently diagnosed childhood cancer survivors and siblings. Methods The Swiss Childhood Cancer Survivor Study sent a questionnaire to all survivors (≥16 years) registered in the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry, who survived >5 years and were diagnosed 1976–2003 aged <16 years. Siblings received similar questionnaires. We assessed two types of physical performance limitations: 1) limitations in sports; 2) limitations in daily activities (using SF-36 physical function score). We compared results between survivors diagnosed before and after 1990 and determined predictors for both types of limitations by multivariable logistic regression. Results The sample included 1038 survivors and 534 siblings. Overall, 96 survivors (9.5%) and 7 siblings (1.1%) reported a limitation in sports (Odds ratio 5.5, 95%CI 2.9-10.4, p<0.001), mainly caused by musculoskeletal and neurological problems. Findings were even more pronounced for children diagnosed more recently (OR 4.8, CI 2.4–9.6 and 8.3, CI 3.7–18.8 for those diagnosed <1990 and ≥1990, respectively; p = 0.025). Mean physical function score for limitations in daily activities was 49.6 (CI 48.9–50.4) in survivors and 53.1 (CI 52.5–53.7) in siblings (p<0.001). Again, differences tended to be larger in children diagnosed more recently. Survivors of bone tumors, CNS tumors and retinoblastoma and children treated with radiotherapy were most strongly affected. Conclusion Survivors of childhood cancer, even those diagnosed recently and treated with modern protocols, remain at high risk for physical performance limitations. Treatment and follow-up care should include tailored interventions to mitigate these late effects in high-risk patients."
https://openalex.org/W2100827676,"Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by frataxin (FXN) deficiency. The nervous system and heart are the most severely affected tissues. However, highly mitochondria-dependent tissues, such as kidney and liver, are not obviously affected, although the abundance of FXN is normally high in these tissues. In this study we have revealed two novel FXN isoforms (II and III), which are specifically expressed in affected cerebellum and heart tissues, respectively, and are functional in vitro and in vivo. Increasing the abundance of the heart-specific isoform III significantly increased the mitochondrial aconitase activity, while over-expression of the cerebellum-specific isoform II protected against oxidative damage of Fe-S cluster-containing aconitase. Further, we observed that the protein level of isoform III decreased in FRDA patient heart, while the mRNA level of isoform II decreased more in FRDA patient cerebellum compared to total FXN mRNA. Our novel findings are highly relevant to understanding the mechanism of tissue-specific pathology in FRDA."
https://openalex.org/W2124326363,"Background Like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), ovine lentivirus (OvLV) is macrophage-tropic and causes lifelong infection. OvLV infects one quarter of U.S. sheep and induces pneumonia and body condition wasting. There is no vaccine to prevent OvLV infection and no cost-effective treatment for infected animals. However, breed differences in prevalence and proviral concentration have indicated a genetic basis for susceptibility to OvLV. A recent study identified TMEM154 variants in OvLV susceptibility. The objective here was to identify additional loci associated with odds and/or control of OvLV infection. Methodology/Principal Findings This genome-wide association study (GWAS) included 964 sheep from Rambouillet, Polypay, and Columbia breeds with serological status and proviral concentration phenotypes. Analytic models accounted for breed and age, as well as genotype. This approach identified TMEM154 (nominal P = 9.2×10−7; empirical P = 0.13), provided 12 additional genomic regions associated with odds of infection, and provided 13 regions associated with control of infection (all nominal P<1×10−5). Rapid decline of linkage disequilibrium with distance suggested many regions included few genes each. Genes in regions associated with odds of infection included DPPA2/DPPA4 (empirical P = 0.006), and SYTL3 (P = 0.051). Genes in regions associated with control of infection included a zinc finger cluster (ZNF192, ZSCAN16, ZNF389, and ZNF165; P = 0.001), C19orf42/TMEM38A (P = 0.047), and DLGAP1 (P = 0.092). Conclusions/Significance These associations provide targets for mutation discovery in sheep susceptibility to OvLV. Aside from TMEM154, these genes have not been associated previously with lentiviral infection in any species, to our knowledge. Further, data from other species suggest functional hypotheses for future testing of these genes in OvLV and other lentiviral infections. Specifically, SYTL3 binds and may regulate RAB27A, which is required for enveloped virus assembly of human cytomegalovirus. Zinc finger transcription factors have been associated with positive selection for repression of retroviral replication. DLGAP1 binds and may regulate DLG1, a known regulator of HIV infectivity."
https://openalex.org/W1977446658,"Endangered smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata) were opportunistically sampled in south Florida and aged by counting opaque bands in sectioned vertebrae (n=15). Small sample size precluded traditional age verification, but fish collected in spring and summer had translucent vertebrae margins, while fish collected in winter had opaque margins. Trends in Sr:Ca measured across vertebrae with laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry corresponded well to annual salinity trends observed in sawfish estuarine nursery habitats in south Florida, thus serve as a chemical marker verifying annual formation of opaque bands. Based on that finding and assumptions about mean birth date and timing of opaque band formation, estimated age ranged from 0.4 y for a 0.60 m total length (TL) male to 14.0 y for a 4.35 m TL female. Von Bertalanffy growth parameters computed from size at age data were 4.48 m for L(∞), 0.219 y(-1)for k, and -0.81 y for t(0). Results of this study have important implications for sawfish conservation as well as for inferring habitat residency of euryhaline elasmobranchs via chemical analysis of vertebrae."
https://openalex.org/W2115561747,"Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are a common cause of autosomal dominant familial Parkinson's disease (PD). LRRK2 encodes a multi-domain protein containing GTPase and kinase enzymatic domains. Disease-associated mutations in LRRK2 variably influence enzymatic activity with the common G2019S variant leading to enhanced kinase activity. Mutant LRRK2 induces neuronal toxicity through a kinase-dependent mechanism suggesting that kinase activity is important for mediating the pathogenic effects of LRRK2 mutations. A number of LRRK2 kinase substrates have been identified in vitro but whether they represent authentic physiological substrates in mammalian cells or tissues is not yet clear. The eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein, 4E-BP1, was recently identified as a potential substrate of LRRK2 kinase activity in vitro and in Drosophila with phosphorylation occurring at Thr37 and Thr46. Here, we explore a potential interaction of LRRK2 and 4E-BP1 in mammalian cells and brain. We find that LRRK2 can weakly phosphorylate 4E-BP1 in vitro but LRRK2 overexpression is not able to alter endogenous 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in mammalian cells. In mammalian neurons LRRK2 and 4E-BP1 display minimal co-localization, whereas the subcellular distribution, protein complex formation and covalent post-translational modification of endogenous 4E-BP1 are not altered in the brains of LRRK2 knockout or mutant LRRK2 transgenic mice. In the brain, the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at Thr37 and Thr46 does not change in LRRK2 knockout or mutant LRRK2 transgenic mice, nor is 4E-BP1 phosphorylation altered in idiopathic or G2019S mutant PD brains. Collectively, our results suggest that 4E-BP1 is neither a major nor robust physiological substrate of LRRK2 in mammalian cells or brain."
https://openalex.org/W2029248173,"The extent to which people regard others as full-blown individuals with mental states (""humanization"") seems crucial for their prosocial motivation towards them. Previous research has shown that decisions about moral dilemmas in which one person can be sacrificed to save multiple others do not consistently follow utilitarian principles. We hypothesized that this behavior can be explained by the potential victim's perceived humanness and an ensuing increase in vicarious emotions and emotional conflict during decision making. Using fMRI, we assessed neural activity underlying moral decisions that affected fictitious persons that had or had not been experimentally humanized. In implicit priming trials, participants either engaged in mentalizing about these persons (Humanized condition) or not (Neutral condition). In subsequent moral dilemmas, participants had to decide about sacrificing these persons' lives in order to save the lives of numerous others. Humanized persons were sacrificed less often, and the activation pattern during decisions about them indicated increased negative affect, emotional conflict, vicarious emotions, and behavioral control (pgACC/mOFC, anterior insula/IFG, aMCC and precuneus/PCC). Besides, we found enhanced effective connectivity between aMCC and anterior insula, which suggests increased emotion regulation during decisions affecting humanized victims. These findings highlight the importance of others' perceived humanness for prosocial behavior - with aversive affect and other-related concern when imagining harming more ""human-like"" persons acting against purely utilitarian decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2013921517,"Survivin is known as an inhibitor of apoptosis and a positive regulator of cell division. We have recently identified survivin as a predictor of joint destruction in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Flt3 ligand (Flt3L) is expressed in the inflamed joints and has adjuvant properties in arthritis. Studies on 90 RA patients (median age 60.5 years [range, 24-87], disease duration 10.5 years [range, 0-35]) show a strong positive association between the levels of survivin and Flt3L in blood. Here, we present experimental evidence connecting survivin and Flt3L signaling. Treatment of BALB/c mice with Flt3L led to an increase of survivin in the bone marrow and in splenic dendritic cells. Flt3L changed the profile of survivin splice variants, increasing transcription of the short survivin40 in the bone marrow. Treatment with an Flt3 inhibitor reduced total survivin expression in bone marrow and in the dendritic cell population in spleen. Inhibition of survivin transcription in mice, by shRNA lentiviral constructs, reduced the gene expression of Flt3L. We conclude that expression of survivin is a downstream event of Flt3 signaling, which serves as an essential mechanism supporting survival of leukocytes during their differentiation, and maturation of dendritic cells, in RA."
https://openalex.org/W1977770661,"We determined the prevalence and spread of antibiotic resistance and the characteristics of ESBL producing and/or multi drug resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli isolates collected from urine samples from urology services in the Euregio Meuse-Rhine, the border region of the Netherlands (n = 176), Belgium (n = 126) and Germay (n = 119). Significant differences in resistance between the three regions were observed. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid resistance ranged from 24% in the Netherlands to 39% in Belgium (p = 0.018), from 20% to 40% (p<0.004) for the fluoroquinolones and from 20% to 40% (p = 0.018) for the folate antagonists. Resistance to nitrofurantoin was less than 5%. The prevalence of ESBL producing isolates varied from 2% among the Dutch isolates to 8% among the German ones (p = 0.012) and were mainly CTX-M 15. The prevalence of MDR isolates among the Dutch, German and Belgian isolates was 11%, 17% and 27%, respectively (p< = 0.001 for the Belgian compared with the Dutch isolates). The majority of the MDR and ESBL producing isolates belonged to ST131. This study indicates that most antibiotics used as first choice oral empiric treatment for UTIs (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, fluoroquinolones and folate antagonists) are not appropriate for this purpose and that MDR strains such as CTX-M producing ST131 have spread in the entire Euregion. Our data stress the importance of ward specific surveillance to optimize empiric treatment. Also, prudent use of antibiotics and further research to alternative agents are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W1980566075,"Background Mania is characterised by increased impulsivity and risk-taking, and psychological accounts argue that these features may be due to hypersensitivity to reward. The neurobiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we examine reinforcement learning and sensitivity to both reward and punishment outcomes in hypomania-prone individuals not receiving pharmacotherapy. Method We recorded EEG from 45 healthy individuals split into three groups by low, intermediate and high self-reported hypomanic traits. Participants played a computerised card game in which they learned the reward contingencies of three cues. Neural responses to monetary gain and loss were measured using the feedback-related negativity (FRN), a component implicated in motivational outcome evaluation and reinforcement learning. Results As predicted, rewards elicited a smaller FRN in the hypomania-prone group relative to the low hypomania group, indicative of greater reward responsiveness. The hypomania-prone group also showed smaller FRN to losses, indicating diminished response to negative feedback. Conclusion Our findings indicate that proneness to hypomania is associated with both reward hypersensitivity and discounting of punishment. This positive evaluation bias may be driven by aberrant reinforcement learning signals, which fail to update future expectations. This provides a possible neural mechanism explaining risk-taking and impaired reinforcement learning in BD. Further research will be needed to explore the potential value of the FRN as a biological vulnerability marker for mania and pathological risk-taking."
https://openalex.org/W2020484182,"Background The causes of death on long-term mortality after acute kidney injury (AKI) have not been well studied. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the role of comorbidities and the causes of death on the long-term mortality after AKI. Methodology/Principal Findings We retrospectively studied 507 patients who experienced AKI in 2005–2006 and were discharged free from dialysis. In June 2008 (median: 21 months after AKI), we found that 193 (38%) patients had died. This mortality is much higher than the mortality of the population of São Paulo City, even after adjustment for age. A multiple survival analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards regression model and showed that death was associated with Khan’s index indicating high risk [adjusted hazard ratio 2.54 (1.38–4.66)], chronic liver disease [1.93 (1.15–3.22)], admission to non-surgical ward [1.85 (1.30–2.61)] and a second AKI episode during the same hospitalization [1.74 (1.12–2.71)]. The AKI severity evaluated either by the worst stage reached during AKI (P = 0.20) or by the need for dialysis (P = 0.12) was not associated with death. The causes of death were identified by a death certificate in 85% of the non-survivors. Among those who died from circulatory system diseases (the main cause of death), 59% had already suffered from hypertension, 34% from diabetes, 47% from heart failure, 38% from coronary disease, and 66% had a glomerular filtration rate <60 previous to the AKI episode. Among those who died from neoplasms, 79% already had the disease previously. Conclusions Among AKI survivors who were discharged free from dialysis the increased long-term mortality was associated with their pre-existing chronic conditions and not with the severity of the AKI episode. These findings suggest that these survivors should have a medical follow-up after hospital discharge and that all efforts should be made to control their comorbidities."
https://openalex.org/W2068186237,"Background Sexually Transmitted diseases (STD) syndrome management has been one cornerstone of STD treatment. Persons with STD symptoms in many countries, especially those with limited resources, often initially seek care in pharmacies. The objective of the study was to develop and evaluate an integrated network of physicians, midwives and pharmacy workers trained in STD syndromic management (The PREVEN Network) as part of a national urban community-randomized trial of sexually transmitted infection prevention in Peru. Methods and Findings After a comprehensive census of physicians, midwives, and pharmacies in ten intervention and ten control cities, we introduced seminars and workshops for pharmacy workers, and continuing education for physicians and midwives in intervention cities and invited graduates to join the PREVEN Network. “Prevention Salespersons” visited pharmacies, boticas and clinicians regularly for educational support and collection of information on numbers of cases of STD syndromes seen at pharmacies and by clinicians in intervention cities. Simulated patients evaluated outcomes of training of pharmacy workers with respect to adequate STD syndrome management, recommendations for condom use and for treatment of partners. In intervention cities we trained, certified, and incorporated into the PREVEN Network the workers at 623 (80.6%) of 773 pharmacies and 701 (69.6%) of 1007 physicians and midwives in private practice. Extremely high clinician and pharmacy worker turnover, 13.4% and 44% respectively in the first year, dictated continued training of new pharmacy workers and clinicians. By the end of the intervention the Network included 792 pharmacies and 597 clinicians. Pharmacies reported more cases of STDs than did clinicians. Evaluations by simulated patients showed significant and substantial improvements in the management of STD syndromes at pharmacies in intervention cities but not in control cities. Conclusions Training pharmacy workers linked to a referral network of clinicians proved feasible and acceptable. High turn-over was challenging but over come."
https://openalex.org/W2034584518,"SdiA of E. coli and Salmonella is a LuxR homolog that detects N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs). Most LuxR homologs function together with a cognate AHL synthase (a LuxI homolog), but SdiA does not. Instead, SdiA detects AHLs produced by other bacterial species. In this report, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of SdiA. The results suggest that one branch of the Enterobacteriaceae obtained a rhlR/rhlI pair by horizontal transfer. The Erwinia and Pantoea branches still contain the complete pair where it is known as expR/expI and phzR/phzI, respectively. A deletion event removed the luxI homolog from the remainder of the group, leaving just the luxR homolog known as sdiA. Thus ExpR and PhzR are SdiA orthologs and ExpI and PhzI are descendants of the long lost cognate signal synthase of SdiA."

We generated CD200R1(-/-) mice and employed them to explore both the role of CD200R1 in regulating macrophage signaling via TLR2 as well as the host response to an in vivo, TLR2-dependent model, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection. CD200R1(-/-) peritoneal macrophages demonstrated a 70-75% decrease in the generation of IL-6 and CCL5 (Rantes) in response to the TLR2 agonist Pam(2)CSK(4) and to HSV-1. CD200R1(-/-) macrophages could neither up-regulate the expression of TLR2, nor assemble a functional inflammasome in response to HSV-1. CD200R1(-/-) mice were protected from HSV-1 infection and exhibited dysfunctional TLR2 signaling. Finally, both CD200R1(-/-) mice and CD200R1(-/-) fibroblasts and macrophages showed a markedly reduced ability to support HSV-1 replication. In summary, our data demonstrate an unanticipated and novel requirement for CD200R1 in ""licensing"" pro-inflammatory functions of TLR2 and in limiting viral replication that are supported by ex vivo and in vivo evidence."
https://openalex.org/W2020843712,"Prognostic models are often used to estimate the length of patient survival. The Cox proportional hazards model has traditionally been applied to assess the accuracy of prognostic models. However, it may be suboptimal due to the inflexibility to model the baseline survival function and when the proportional hazards assumption is violated. The aim of this study was to use internal validation to compare the predictive power of a flexible Royston-Parmar family of survival functions with the Cox proportional hazards model. We applied the Palliative Performance Scale on a dataset of 590 hospice patients at the time of hospice admission. The retrospective data were obtained from the Lifepath Hospice and Palliative Care center in Hillsborough County, Florida, USA. The criteria used to evaluate and compare the models' predictive performance were the explained variation statistic R(2), scaled Brier score, and the discrimination slope. The explained variation statistic demonstrated that overall the Royston-Parmar family of survival functions provided a better fit (R(2) =0.298; 95% CI: 0.236-0.358) than the Cox model (R(2) =0.156; 95% CI: 0.111-0.203). The scaled Brier scores and discrimination slopes were consistently higher under the Royston-Parmar model. Researchers involved in prognosticating patient survival are encouraged to consider the Royston-Parmar model as an alternative to Cox."

Direct bloom control could alleviate the ecological and economic damage associated with bloom outbreak. This paper explored the effectiveness and safety of natural chemical biocide hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) for brown tide bloom control. Culture studies showed that H(2)O(2) at 1.6 mg L(-1) effectively eradicated high density A. anophagefferens within 24-hr, but caused no significant growth inhibition in the diatoms, prymnesiophytes, green algae and dinoflagellates of >2-3 μm cell sizes among 12 phytoplankton species tested over 1-week observation. When applied to brown tide bloom prone natural seawater in a microcosm study, this treatment effectively removed the developing brown tide bloom, while the rest of phytoplankton assemblage (quantified via HPLC based marker pigment analyses), particularly the diatoms and green algae, experienced only transient suppression then recovered with total chlorophyll a exceeding that in the controls within 72-hr; cyanobacteria was not eradicated but was still reduced about 50% at 72-hr, as compared to the controls. The action of H(2)O(2) against phytoplankton as a function of cell size and cell wall structure, and a realistic scenario of H(2)O(2) application were discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2067655202,"The metabolism of arginine towards ATP synthesis has been considered a major source of energy for microorganisms such as Mycoplasma penetrans in anaerobic conditions. Additionally, this pathway has also been implicated in pathogenic and virulence mechanism of certain microorganisms, i.e. protection from acidic stress during infection. In this work we present the crystal structures of the three enzymes composing the gene cluster of the arginine deiminase pathway from M. penetrans: arginine deiminase (ADI), ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OTC) and carbamate kinase (CK). The arginine deiminase (ADI) structure has been refined to 2.3 Å resolution in its apo-form, displaying an “open” conformation of the active site of the enzyme in comparison to previous complex structures with substrate intermediates. The active site pocket of ADI is empty, with some of the catalytic and binding residues far from their active positions, suggesting major conformational changes upon substrate binding. Ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OTC) has been refined in two crystal forms at 2.5 Å and 2.6 Å resolution, respectively, both displaying an identical dodecameric structure with a 23-point symmetry. The dodecameric structure of OTC represents the highest level of organization in this protein family and in M.penetrans it is constituted by a novel interface between the four catalytic homotrimers. Carbamate kinase (CK) has been refined to 2.5 Å resolution and its structure is characterized by the presence of two ion sulfates in the active site, one in the carbamoyl phosphate binding site and the other in the β-phosphate ADP binding pocket of the enzyme. The CK structure also shows variations in some of the elements that regulate the catalytic activity of the enzyme. The relatively low number of metabolic pathways and the relevance in human pathogenesis of Mycoplasma penetrans places the arginine deiminase pathway enzymes as potential targets to design specific inhibitors against this human parasite."

The main goal was to test student's knowledge, attitudes, and interests about neuroscience, to assess needs, prospects, and difficulties in teaching about the brain from elementary to high school. A written questionnaire, maintaining anonymity, asked 12 close-ended multiple choice questions on topics related to human and animal brains, plus one facultative open-ended question about interests and curiosities on brain topics. The results show that respondents have a fragmentary level of basic knowledge about the brain, with aspects related to brain functions and consciousness the most challenging. As expected, degrees of performance improve with school level; elementary school students answered correctly an average number of 5.3 questions, middle school 6.5, and high school 7.4. Overall, students show great interest in the brain, as shown by the large number of questions gathered through the open-ended question (n = 384). Other topics are addressed, mostly related to brain structure/functions and the role of the brain in the everyday life. The survey indicates the need of more thorough school programs on this subject, reinforced by interdisciplinary teaching where comparative anatomy and evolutionary aspects of brain development are covered."
https://openalex.org/W2163742294,"Thermoregulatory neurons of the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) represent a target at which histamine modulates body temperature. The mechanism by which histamine excites a population of MnPO neurons is not known. In this study it was found that histamine activated a cationic inward current and increased the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, actions that had a transient component as well as a sustained one that lasted for tens of minutes after removal of the agonist. The sustained component was blocked by TRPC channel blockers. Single-cell reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed expression of TRPC1, TRPC5 and TRPC7 subunits in neurons excited by histamine. These studies also established the presence of transcripts for the glutamatergic marker Vglut2 and for the H1 histamine receptor in neurons excited by histamine. Intracellular application of antibodies directed against cytoplasmic sites of the TRPC1 or TRPC5 channel subunits decreased the histamine-induced inward current. The persistent inward current and elevation in intracellular Ca2+ concentration could be reversed by activating the PKA pathway. This data reveal a novel mechanism by which histamine induces persistent excitation and sustained intracellular Ca2+ elevation in glutamatergic MnPO neurons."

Here we report the identification and functional analysis of the novel cis-encoded sRNA h2cR, from the human opportunistic pathogen Burkholderia cenocepacia J2315. The sRNA was found to negatively regulate the hfq2 mRNA, through binding to part of the 5′-UTR region of the hfq2 mRNA, resulting in accelerated hfq2 mRNA decay and reduced protein levels in exponentially growing cells. Both the h2cR transcript and the hfq2 mRNA are stabilized by the other B. cenocepacia RNA chaperone, Hfq. Infection experiments using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans revealed that down-regulation of Hfq2 by h2cR decreases the B. cenocepacia ability to colonize and persist within the nematode, suggesting a role for h2cR on bacterial persistence in the host."
https://openalex.org/W2077393229,"Disruption of early mitotic inhibitor 1 (Emi1) interferes with normal cell cycle progression and results in early embryonic lethality in vertebrates. During S and G2 phases the ubiquitin ligase complex APC/C is inhibited by Emi1 protein, thereby enabling the accumulation of Cyclins A and B so they can regulate replication and promote the transition from G2 phase to mitosis, respectively. Depletion of Emi1 prevents mitotic entry and causes rereplication and an increase in cell size. In this study, we show that the developmental and cell cycle defects caused by inactivation of zebrafish emi1 are due to inappropriate activation of APC/C through its cofactor Cdh1. Inhibiting/slowing progression into S-phase by depleting Cdt1, an essential replication licensing factor, partially rescued emi1 deficiency-induced rereplication and the increased cell size. The cell size effect was enhanced by co-depletion of cell survival regulator p53. These data suggest that the increased size of emi1-deficient cells is either directly or indirectly caused by the rereplication defects. Moreover, enforced expression of Cyclin A partially ablated the rereplicating population in emi1-deficient zebrafish embryos, consistent with the role of Cyclin A in origin licensing. Forced expression of Cyclin B partially restored the G1 population, in agreement with the established role of Cyclin B in mitotic progression and exit. However, expression of Cyclin B also partially inhibited rereplication in emi1-deficient embryos, suggesting a role for Cyclin B in regulating replication in this cellular context. As Cyclin A and B are substrates for APC/C-Cdh1 - mediated degradation, and Cdt1 is under control of Cyclin A, these data indicate that emi1 deficiency-induced defects in vivo are due to the dysregulation of an APC/C-Cdh1 molecular axis."
https://openalex.org/W2095039155,"Backgrounds The geographic disparity of prevalence rates among dialysis patients is unclear. We evaluate the association between travel time to dialysis facilities and prevalence rates of dialysis patients living in 1,867 census areas of Hiroshima, Japan. Furthermore, we study the effects of geographic features (mainland or island) on the prevalence rates and assess if these effects modify the association between travel time and prevalence. Methods The study subjects were all 7,374 people that were certified as the “renal disabled” by local governments in 2011. The travel time from each patient to the nearest available dialysis facility was calculated by incorporating both travel time and the capacity of all 98 facilities. The effect of travel time on the age- and sex-adjusted standard prevalence rate (SPR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) at each census area was evaluated in two-level Poisson regression models with 1,867 census areas (level 1) nested within 35 towns or cities (level 2). The results were adjusted for area-based parameters of socioeconomic status, urbanity, and land type. Furthermore, the SPR of dialysis patients was calculated in each specific subgroup of population for travel time, land type, and combination of land type and travel time. Results In the regression analysis, SPR decreased by 5.2% (95% CI: −7.9–−2.3) per 10-min increase in travel time even after adjusting for potential confounders. The effect of travel time on prevalence was different in the mainland and island groups. There was no travel time-dependent SPR disparity on the islands. The SPR among remote residents (>30 min from facilities) in the mainland was lower (0.77, 95% CI: 0.71–0.85) than that of closer residents (≤30 min; 0.95, 95% CI: 0.92–0.97). Conclusions The prevalence of dialysis patients was lower among remote residents. Geographic difficulties for commuting seem to decrease the prevalence rate."

Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that BRG1 binds specifically to E2F6 and E2F4 but not the activator E2Fs. E2F6 was also able to interact with BAF155, a BRG1-associated factor, in the SWI/SNF complex. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate the binding of BRG1 coincident with E2F6 on G1/S gene promoters during S phase.

After surfactant depletion, animals either received 30 ml/kg of PF5080, 100 mg/kg of stained (green dye) Curosurf™ or 30 ml/kg of Persurf. Lungs were fixated after 1 hour of ventilation and alveolar aeration and surfactant distribution was estimated by a stereological approach.Persurf contained 3 mg/ml phospholipids and was stable for more than 48 hours. Persurf-administration improved oxygenation.

We have studied two inheritable cysteine mutants of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels that produce achromatopsia, a common form of severe color blindness. By taking advantage of the reactivity of cysteine's sulfhydryl group, we modified these mutants with chemical reagents that attach moieties with similar chemistries to the wild-type amino acids' side chains. We show that these modifications restored proper delivery to the cell membrane. Once there, the channels exhibited normal functional properties. This strategy might provide a unique opportunity to assess the chemical nature of membrane protein traffic problems."
https://openalex.org/W2041772602,"Control of cellular proliferation is critical to cell viability. The F-box protein Fbw7 (hAgo/hCdc4/FBXW7) functions as a specificity factor for the Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex and targets several proteins required for cellular proliferation for ubiquitin-mediated destruction. Fbw7 exists as three splice variants but the mechanistic role of each is not entirely clear. We examined the regulation of the Fbw7-γ isoform, which has been implicated in the degradation of c-Myc. We show here that Fbw7-γ is an unstable protein and that its turnover is proteasome-dependent in transformed cells. Using a two-hybrid screen, we identified a novel interaction partner, SLP-1, which binds the N-terminal domain of Fbw7-γ. Overexpression of SLP-1 inhibits the degradation of Fbw7-γ, suggesting that this interaction can happen in vivo. When Fbw7-γ is stabilized by overexpression of SLP-1, c-Myc protein abundance decreases, suggesting that the SCF(Fbw7-γ) complex maintains activity. We demonstrate that Cdk2 also binds the N-terminal domain of Fbw7-γ as well as SLP-1. Interestingly, co-expression of Cdk2 and SLP-1 does not inhibit Fbw7-γ degradation, suggesting that Cdk2 and SLP-1 may have opposing functions."
https://openalex.org/W2091345198,"Background We tested the concordance of the two diagnostic criteria for diabetes using fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) by the Japan Diabetes Society (JDS) and American Diabetes Association (ADA). Methods We used data from 7,328 subjects without known diabetes who participated in a voluntary health checkup program at least twice between 1998 and 2006, at intervals ≤2 years. For repeat participants who attended the screening over two times, data from the first and second checkups were used for this study. At the first visit, diabetes was diagnosed both at FPG ≥7.0 mmol/L and HbA1c ≥6.5% using the JDS criteria. In addition, diabetes was diagnosed using two ADA criteria; ADA-FPG diabetes for persistent fasting hyperglycemia (FPG ≥7.0 mmol/L) or ADA-HbA1c diabetes for hyper-glycated hemoglominemia (HbA1c ≥6.5%), both at the first and second checkups. Subsequently, the concordance of diagnosis between the JDS and the ADA criteria was evaluated. Results At the first checkup, 153 (2.1%) persons were diagnosed with diabetes by the JDS criteria. They had higher levels of risk factors for diabetes than non-diabetic subjects. Using the first and second checkups, 174 (2.4%) and 175 (2.4%) were diagnosed with diabetes by the ADA-FPG criteria, respectively. Among 153 subjects diagnosed with diabetes by the JDS criteria, 125 (81.7%) and 129 (84.3%) had ADA-FPG and ADA-HbA1c diabetes, respectively. The kappa coefficients of the JDS criteria with ADA-FPG and ADA-HbA1c criteria were 0.759 and 0.782 (P<0.001), respectively. In the subgroup analysis stratified by sex, the concordance was well preserved at the kappa coefficients around 0.8 (between 0.725 and 0.836). Conclusion The JDS diagnostic criteria for diabetes have a substantial and acceptable concordance with the ADA criteria. The JDS criteria may be a practical method for diagnosing diabetes that maintains compatibility with the ADA criteria."
