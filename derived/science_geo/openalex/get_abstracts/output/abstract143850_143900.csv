https://openalex.org/W2140948740,"The functions of many open reading frames (ORFs) identified in genome-sequencing projects are unknown. New, whole-genome approaches are required to systematically determine their function. A total of 6925 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were constructed, by a high-throughput strategy, each with a precise deletion of one of 2026 ORFs (more than one-third of the ORFs in the genome). Of the deleted ORFs, 17 percent were essential for viability in rich medium. The phenotypes of more than 500 deletion strains were assayed in parallel. Of the deletion strains, 40 percent showed quantitative growth defects in either rich or minimal medium."
https://openalex.org/W1995757732,"The actin cytoskeleton undergoes extensive remodeling during cell morphogenesis and motility. The small guanosine triphosphatase Rho regulates such remodeling, but the underlying mechanisms of this regulation remain unclear. Cofilin exhibits actin-depolymerizing activity that is inhibited as a result of its phosphorylation by LIM-kinase. Cofilin was phosphorylated in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells during lysophosphatidic acid–induced, Rho-mediated neurite retraction. This phosphorylation was sensitive to Y-27632, a specific inhibitor of the Rho-associated kinase ROCK. ROCK, which is a downstream effector of Rho, did not phosphorylate cofilin directly but phosphorylated LIM-kinase, which in turn was activated to phosphorylate cofilin. Overexpression of LIM-kinase in HeLa cells induced the formation of actin stress fibers in a Y-27632–sensitive manner. These results indicate that phosphorylation of LIM-kinase by ROCK and consequently increased phosphorylation of cofilin by LIM-kinase contribute to Rho-induced reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2116508133,"An early transient burst of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins was recently shown to be required for apoptosis to proceed in various cell lines (Simbulan-Rosenthal, C., Rosenthal, D., Iyer, S., Boulares, H., and Smulson, M. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 13703–13712) followed by cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), catalyzed by caspase-3. This inactivation of PARP has been proposed to prevent depletion of NAD (a PARP substrate) and ATP, which are thought to be required for later events in apoptosis. The role of PARP cleavage in apoptosis has now been investigated in human osteosarcoma cells and PARP −/− fibroblasts stably transfected with a vector encoding a caspase-3-resistant PARP mutant. Expression of this mutant PARP increased the rate of staurosporine and tumor necrosis factor-α-induced apoptosis, at least in part by reducing the time interval required for the onset of caspase-3 activation and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, as well as the generation of 50-kilobase pair DNA breaks, thought to be associated with early chromatin unfolding. Overexpression of wild-type PARP in osteosarcoma cells also accelerated the apoptotic process, although not to the same extent as that apparent in cells expressing the mutant PARP. These effects of the mutant and wild-type enzymes might be due to the early and transient poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis in response to DNA breaks, and the accompanying depletion of NAD apparent in the transfected cells. The accelerated NAD depletion did not seem to interfere with the later stages of apoptosis. These results indicate that PARP activation and subsequent cleavage have active and complex roles in apoptosis.

It is characterized by marked changes in cellular morphology, including chromatin condensation, membrane blebbing, nuclear breakdown, and the appearance of membrane-associated apoptotic bodies, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, as well as by cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP).1 PARP catalyzes the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of a variety of nuclear proteins with NAD as substrate. Because it is activated by binding to DNA ends or strand breaks, PARP was suggested to contribute to cell death by depleting the cell of NAD and ATP (1Berger N.A. Petzold S.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4352-4355Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 2Berger N.A. Radiat. Res. 1985; 101: 4-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). PARP was subsequently shown to be cleaved into 89- and 24-kDa fragments that contain the active site and the DNA-binding domain of the enzyme, respectively, during drug-induced apoptosis in a variety of cells (3Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar, 4Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y.

Such cleavage essentially inactivates the enzyme by destroying its ability to respond to DNA strand breaks. Caspase-3, a member of the caspase family of 13 aspartate-specific cysteine proteases that play a central role in the execution of the apoptotic program (6Alnemri E. Livingston D. Nicholson D.

The sequence at which caspase 3 cleaves PARP (DEVD) is very well conserved in the PARP protein from very distant species, indicating the potential importance of PARP cleavage in apoptosis (9Le Rhun Y. Kirkland J. Shah G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In human osteosarcoma cells that undergo spontaneous, confluence-associated apoptosis over a 10-day period in culture, caspase-3-like activity measured with a specific [35S]PARP-cleavage assay in vitro peaks at 6–7 days after initiation of apoptosis, concomitant with the onset of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation (4Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar). We have also previously examined the time course of PARP activation during spontaneous apoptosis in these cells by immunofluorescence microscopy with antibodies to poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) (10Rosenthal D.S. Ding R. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M.G. Vaillancourt J.P. Nicholson D.W. Smulson M.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A transient burst of PAR synthesis from NAD was observed that increased early and peaked 3 days after initiation of apoptosis, prior to the appearance of internucleosomal DNA cleavage. We have recently detected such a transient poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins at an early stage of induced apoptosis in various other cell types (11Simbulan-Rosenthal C. Rosenthal D. Iyer S. Boulares H. Smulson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13703-13712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 12Simbulan-Rosenthal C. Rosenthal D. Iyer S. Boulares H. Smulson M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 193: 137-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prevention of this early poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, either by disruption of the PARP gene or by expression of PARP antisense RNA, prevented completion of the apoptotic program as assessed on the basis of various morphological and biochemical markers of cell death. Several strains of PARP knockout mice have been established (13Wang Z. Stingl L. Morrison C. Jantsch M. Los M. Schulze-Osthoff K. Wagner E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2347-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 14de Murcia J. Niedergang C. Trucco C. Ricoul M. Dutrillaux B. Mark M. Oliver J. Masson M. Dierich A. LeMeur M. Waltzinger C. Chambon P. deMurcia G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7303-7307Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Despite variations in physiological phenotype among these animals, they are viable and developmental apoptosis appears to occur in the absence of PARP (15Wang Z.Q. Auer B. Stingl L. Berghammer H. Haidacher D. Schweiger M. Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). However, “abnormal” apoptosis has been described in some of the knockout animals (9Le Rhun Y. Kirkland J. Shah G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, we have shown that fibroblasts derived from one strain of PARP knockout mice fail to show either the early burst of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation or subsequent markers of apoptosis when exposed to agents that induce apoptotic death in fibroblasts from control mice (11Simbulan-Rosenthal C.

Boulares H. Smulson M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 193: 137-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous studies with clonal cells depleted of endogenous PARP by expression of PARP antisense RNA have also revealed that this enzyme plays important roles in genomic stability (16Ding R. Smulson M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4627-4634PubMed Google Scholar), adipocyte differentiation (17Smulson M.E. Kang V.H. Ntambi J.M. Rosenthal D.S. Ding R. Simbulan C.M.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 12804-12812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the role of PARP degradation in the later stages of apoptosis, we have now expressed a mutant PARP that is resistant to cleavage by caspase-3 in human osteosarcoma cells and PARP −/− fibroblasts and examined its effect on both staurosporine and TNF-α-induced apoptosis in these cells. We also monitored the fate of both the endogenous and recombinant PARP molecules as well as the concentration of NAD in the transfected cells. A cDNA encoding a caspase-3-resistant form of PARP was generated with the use of a QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The resistance-conferring mutation was introduced with the use of two 37-base complementary oligonucleotides (5′-GCCACTTCATCCACTCCTCCCACCTCATCGCCTTTTC-3′ and 5′-GAAAAGGCGATGAGGTGGGAGGAGTGGATGAAGTGGC-3′) whose sequences match those of human wild-type PARP cDNA (20Cherney B.W. McBride O.W. Chen D.F. Alkhatib H. Bhatia K. Hensley P. Smulson M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8370-8374Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) with the exception that they encode glycine, rather than aspartic acid, at position 214 (bold sequence). Both wild-type and mutant PARP cDNA were amplified by polymerase chain reaction with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) according to recommendations of the manufacturer. The amplification primers (sense, 5′-GGGCGGCCGCCACAGGGAGGTCTTAAAATTG-3′; antisense, 5′-CCGCTAGCCATGGCGGAGTCTTCGGATAA-3′) introduced an Nhe I restriction site into the 5′ end and a Not I restriction site into the 3′ end of the PARP cDNA. A pair of oligonucleotides encoding multiple histidine residues and the FLAG epitope (5′-GGCCGCACCACCACCACCACCACGATTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGTGA-3′ and 5′-CTAGTCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAATCGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGC-3′) were annealed to produce a His-FLAG cDNA fragment flanked with Not I and Xba I ends. This fragment was ligated with theNhe I-Not I restriction fragment of the PARP amplification product into pCR3.1 (Invitrogen) that had been digested with Nhe I and Xba I. Plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant PARP were used to synthesize [35S]methionine-labeled proteins by coupled T7 RNA polymerase-mediated transcription and translation in a reticulocyte lysate (Promega). For assay of PARP cleavage, portions (1 μl) of lysate containing the recombinant protein were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 10 ng of caspase-3 (kindly provided by D. Nicholson, Merck). The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer, and the products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and autoradiography. For assay of PARP activity, 5 μl of lysate containing recombinant protein were incubated with sonicated salmon sperm DNA and [32P]NAD (NEN Life Science Products) as described previously (21Cherney B.W. Midura R.J. Caplan A.J. Dev. Biol. 1985; 112: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Human osteosarcoma cells (American Type Culture Collection) and PARP −/− immortalized fibroblasts (kindly provided by Z. Q. Wang, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were transfected with human PARP cDNA vectors by lipofection (Panvera). Transfected osteosarcoma and PARP −/− clones were isolated by G418 or hygromycin selection and tested for expression of PARP by immunoblot analysis with antibodies to the FLAG epitope or to the human PARP protein as described below. Apoptosis was induced by exposing the cells to 1 μmstaurosporine (Sigma) at 37 °C or 10 ng of TNF-α in combination with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide. Cells in 24-well plates were treated with 1 μm staurosporine for different time intervals. Cells were then washed with Locke's solution (154 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 3.6 mmNaHCO3, 2.3 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, and 5 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4)) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with the same solution containing 2.5 μmcalcein-AM (Molecular Probes). Fluorescence resulting from the deesterification of calcein-AM was monitored with a CytoFluor 4000 fluorometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 and 520 nm, respectively. Data are means ± S.D. of four wells from a representative experiment and are expressed as a percentage of the value at zero time. Cells were fixed for 20 min in PBS containing 4% formaldehyde, washed with PBS, and stained with Hoechst 33342 (30 μg/ml) (Molecular Probes) in PBS containing 80% glycerol. Cells were then mounted onto a slide, and nuclear morphology was observed with a Nikon fluorescence microscope. DNA was isolated from cells as described previously (22Eldadah B. Yakovlev A. Faden A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4092-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. In brief, cells cultured in 10-cm Petri dishes were collected and lysed in 0.5 ml of 7m guanidine hydrochloride. The lysate was mixed with 1 ml of Wizard Maxiprep resin (Promega) and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 5 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of washing solution (90 mm NaCl, 9 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2.25 mm EDTA, 55% (v/v) ethanol) and drawn by vacuum through a Wizard Midicolumn (Promega). The column was washed with 6 ml of washing solution and dried by centrifugation over a microcentrifuge tube at 10,000 × g for 2 min. DNA was eluted with 100 μl of H2O, and residual RNA in the eluate was removed by incubation with 1 μg of RNase A at 37 °C for 60 min. DNA samples were applied to a 1.5% agarose gel in Tris borate-EDTA buffer and subjected to electrophoresis at 4 V/cm. DNA ladders were visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. The procedures for fixation, permeabilization, and staining were essentially done as described (23Neame S.J. Rubin L.L. Philpott K.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1583-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, blocked with 10 mm glycine for 10 min. The cells were incubated with anti-FLAG antibodies (Eastman Kodak Co.) in binding buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 0.2% gelatin, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, PBS) for 1 h. After a 20-min wash in binding buffer, the cells were incubated Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) for 1 h and costained with Hoechst 33342. PARP localization was then observed with a Nikon fluorescence microscope. Cells were isolated and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline by centrifugation, and then lysed by incubation for 10 min on ice in lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin). After removal of cell debris by centrifugation, the protein concentration of the cell lysate was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. A portion (30 μg of protein) of each lysate was then fractionated by SDS-PAGE on a 4–20% gradient gel, and the separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. The filter was stained with Ponceau S to confirm equal loading and transfer of samples, and was then probed with antibodies to PARP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), to CPP32 (kindly provided by D. Nicholson, Merck), to the FLAG epitope (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or to PAR (10H-A) (11Simbulan-Rosenthal C. Rosenthal D. Iyer S. Boulares H. Smulson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13703-13712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Immune complexes were detected with appropriate secondary antibodies and chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). Caspase-3 activity was measured essentially as described (4Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. In brief, cell extracts (25 μg of protein) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 40 μm DEVD-aminomethylcoumarin (AMC) peptide substrate in a total volume of 200 μl. The fluorescence of free AMC, generated as a result of cleavage of the aspartate-AMC bond, was monitored continuously over 15 min with a CytoFluor 4000 fluorometer at excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 460 nm, respectively. The emission from each well was plotted against time, and linear regression analysis of the initial velocity (slope) for each curve yielded the activity. Cells were seeded into six-well culture dishes at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well. After treatment with staurosporine for various times, the cells were scraped into the culture medium, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then extracted with 0.5 ml of ice-cold 0.5 m perchloric acid. 0.47 ml of 1 m KOH buffered with 0.33 mK2HPO4 and 0.33 mKH2PO4 was then added to adjust the pH to 7.3. Cell debris and salt precipitates were removed by centrifugation. The amount of NAD in the supernatant was determined with an enzymatic cycling assay as described (24Jacobson E. Jacobson M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). PFE was performed using the GENELINE system (Beckman Instruments) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells (4 × 106) were harvested and washed with cold PBS. The cell pellet was then resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (100 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 20 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris (pH 8.0)), mixed with 150 μl of agarose solution (1% agarose in lysis buffer, kept at 42 °C) and poured into a plug mold. After solidification, plugs were incubated twice for 24 h each in five volumes of lysis buffer supplemented with 1 mg/ml proteinase K and 1% sodium lauroyl sarcosinate at 50 °C. Plugs were then incubated for at least 24 h in 100 volumes of Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 7.4) at 4 °C with at least two changes of buffer and then stored at 4 °C until usage. DNA was subjected to a 1% agarose in 1× PFE buffer (20× PFE: 0.2 m Tris, 7.8 mm EDTA, and 0.5% glacial acetic acid) at 170 V for 30 min with 4-s pulses followed by 150 V for 18 h with 35-s pulses. This program allowed for resolution of DNA molecules up to 1000 kb. Lambda DNA ladders (50–1000 kb) were used as standards. DNA fragments were visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. We have previously used a human osteosarcoma cell line to identify the enzyme (caspase-3, originally termed apopain) responsible for PARP degradation during apoptosis as well as to study the role of PARP in the death program in individual cells by immunofluorescence microscopy (4Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K.

Cell Res. 1997; 232: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These cells undergo a slow spontaneous apoptosis related to confluence. We therefore investigated the effects of expression of a caspase-3-resistant PARP mutant on apoptosis in these cells. In addition to confluence-associated apoptosis, the osteosarcoma cells undergo apoptosis on exposure to the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine. Treatment of the cells with 1 μmstaurosporine for 24 h reduced cell viability to ∼40% of control values, as assessed by measuring calcein fluorescence (Fig.1 A ). Staining of the cells with Hoechst 33342 revealed that staurosporine induced chromatin condensation and the typical morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis (Fig. 1 B ). Agarose gel electrophoresis also showed that treatment of cells with staurosporine for 24 h induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1 C ). We have previously shown that PARP is cleaved between Asp214 and Gly215 (20Cherney B.W. McBride O.W. Chen D.F. Alkhatib H. Bhatia K. Hensley P. Smulson M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8370-8374Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) by caspase-3 (4Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of PARP and its cleavage in apoptosis, we constructed a cDNA encoding a mutant PARP (mut-PARP) in which Asp214 is replaced by Gly (Fig.2 A ). This substitution theoretically renders the protein resistant to cleavage by caspase-3. This construct as well as a cDNA encoding wild-type PARP (wt-PARP) were separately introduced into an expression vector together with a nucleotide sequence encoding the FLAG epitope. To demonstrate that the protein produced from the mut-PARP cDNA was both catalytically active and resistant to caspase-3 cleavage, we first performed several in vitro experiments. Complementary DNAs encoding mut-PARP or wt-PARP, with or without the FLAG sequence, were transcribed and translated with a reticulocyte lysate. For assay of susceptibility to caspase-3, the in vitro translated proteins labeled with [35S]methionione were incubated with the recombinant protease and the reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Whereas wt-PARP was cleaved into its characteristic 89- and 24-kDa fragments on exposure to caspase-3, mut-PARP was not (Fig. 2 B ). The presence of the FLAG sequence did not affect this action (or lack thereof) of caspase-3 on wt-PARP (or mut-PARP). Although caspase-3 did not cleave mut-PARP into 89- and 24-kDa fragments, it appeared to cleave a small fragment from the mutant protein, so that it migrated as a doublet after caspase-3 treatment; this observation suggests the presence of a cryptic second cleavage site for caspase-3. The rate of cleavage at this second site was much slower than that at position 214 (data not shown). Similar results, including cleavage of mut-PARP at the second site, were obtained when [35S]methionine-labeled mut-PARP and wt-PARP were incubated with extracts prepared from Jurkat cells undergoing apoptosis induced by antibodies to Fas (data not shown). The activity of the in vitro translated FLAG-tagged PARP proteins was measured by incubating reticulocyte lysate with [32P]NAD and fragmented DNA and then measuring incorporation of radioactivity into proteins precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Both wt-PARP and mut-PARP exhibited substantial poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation activity (Fig. 2 C ), and this activity was blocked by the PARP inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide. We also examined the effect of caspase-3 treatment on the activity of both wt- and mut-PARP. Reticulocyte lysates containing either the mutant or wild-type enzyme were incubated with recombinant caspase-3, under conditions sufficient to result in cleavage of 100% of wt-PARP, after which sonicated DNA and [32P]NAD were added and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation was measured. Whereas the activity of wt-PARP was abolished after incubation with caspase-3, that of mut-PARP remained unaffected (Fig. 2 D ). Osteosarcoma cells were stably transfected with vectors encoding either wt- or mut-PARP, and individual clones were isolated by G418 selection and shown to express the recombinant proteins by immunoblot analysis of cell extracts with antibodies to FLAG (Fig.3 A ). Although Western analysis is not strictly quantitative, the expression of wt-PARP appeared to be about 2-fold greater than that of mut-PARP. Since the mutation introduced to PARP is located in the nuclear localization sequence of the protein, we wished to determine whether it had an effect on the translocation of the mutant protein into the nucleus of transfected cells. Indirect immunostaining with anti-FLAG antibodies revealed no difference in nuclear translocation between wt- and mut-PARP (Fig.3 B ), indicating that the mutation did not interfere with mut-PARP translocation. The fate of endogenous PARP in nontransfected cells and that of the recombinant PARP proteins in transfected cells during staurosporine-induced apoptosis were monitored by immunoblot analysis with antibodies to PARP or to FLAG, respectively. Both endogenous PARP (Fig. 3 C ) and wt-PARP (Fig. 3 D ) were apparently cleaved by caspase-3, as revealed by the generation of the 89-kDa fragment (the 24-kDa fragment is not shown because both anti-PARP and anti-FLAG antibodies recognize only the COOH termini of the respective proteins). Cleavage of wt-PARP was detected at an earlier time point (3 h) than was that of endogenous PARP (6 h), and it proceeded at a relatively constant rate until 24 h, when most of the intact protein had disappeared. In contrast, mut-PARP was not cleaved to produce the 89-kDa fragment during the first 12 h of exposure to staurosporine (Fig. 3 E ), indicating that the protein was resistant to the action of caspase-3 in intact cells as well as in vitro . However, at 24 h, mut-PARP was degraded, although not to the 89-kDa fragment. Similar degradation was observed when [35S]methionine-labeled mut-PARP was incubated in vitro with extracts of Jurkat cells at late stages of apoptosis induced by antibodies to Fas (data not shown). This degradation of mut-PARP is thus likely the result of the nonspecific proteolysis activity that occurs in late stages of apoptosis. The effects of wt-PARP and mut-PARP on the time course of the decrease in cell viability during staurosporine-induced apoptosis were assessed by measurement of calcein fluorescence. In nontransfected cells, staurosporine reduced viability by only 18% at 12 h and by 60% at 24 h (Fig. 4 A ), with 80–90% of cells having died by 36 h (data not shown). Transfection of these cells with an empty vector did not change their sensitivity to staurosporine (data not shown). The expression of mut-PARP greatly increased the rate of cell death; a decrease in viability was apparent as early as 3 h, by 6 h more than 30% of cells were nonviable, and by 24 h more than 90% of cells had died. The rate of cell death was also increased in cells expressing wt-PARP, although not to as great an extent as in cells expressing mut-PARP. We next examined the effects of wt- and mut-PARP on staurosporine-induced DNA fragmentation. Whereas internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was not apparent until 24 h after exposure to staurosporine in nontransfected cells, this fragmentation was first detected at 3 h in cells expressing either wt- or mut-PARP (Fig.4 B ); the extent of DNA fragmentation at 3 h was slightly, but consistently noted to be greater in cells expressing mut-PARP than in those expressing wt-PARP.

This is shown here with experiments at different spatial scales using the rape pollen beetle (Meligethes aeneus), an important pest on oilseed rape (Brassica napus). The presence of old field margin strips along rape fields was associated with increased mortality of pollen beetles resulting from parasitism and adjacent, large, old fallow habitats had an even greater effect. In structurally complex landscapes, parasitism was higher and crop damage was lower than in simple landscapes with a high percentage of agricultural use."
https://openalex.org/W1973704051,"During the immediate-early response of mammalian cells to mitogens, histone H3 is rapidly and transiently phosphorylated by one or more unidentified kinases. Rsk-2, a member of the pp90rsk family of kinases implicated in growth control, was required for epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated phosphorylation of H3. RSK-2 mutations in humans are linked to Coffin-Lowry syndrome (CLS). Fibroblasts derived from a CLS patient failed to exhibit EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of H3, although H3 was phosphorylated during mitosis. Introduction of the wild-type RSK-2 gene restored EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of H3 in CLS cells. In addition, disruption of the RSK-2 gene by homologous recombination in murine embryonic stem cells abolished EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of H3. H3 appears to be a direct or indirect target of Rsk-2, suggesting that chromatin remodeling might contribute to mitogen-activated protein kinase-regulated gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2054792986,"Abstract A role of membrane microparticles (MP) released by vascular cells in endothelial cell (EC) activation was investigated. Flow cytofluorimetric analysis of blood samples from normal volunteers revealed the presence of an heterogeneous MP population, which increased by ∼2-fold after inflammatory stimulation with the chemotactic peptide, N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (2,799 ± 360 versus 5241 ± 640, p < 0.001). Blood-derived MP stimulated release of EC cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 (377 ± 68 pg/ml) and MCP-1 (1, 282 ± 79) and up-regulatedde novo expression of tissue factor on the EC surface. This was associated with generation of a factor Xa-dependent procoagulant response (2.28 ± 0.56 nm factor Xa/min/104 cells), in a reaction inhibited by a monoclonal antibody to tissue factor. Fluorescent labeling with antibodies to platelet GPIbα or leukocyte lactoferrin demonstrated that circulating MP originated from both platelets and leukocytes. However, depletion of platelet MP with an antibody to GPIbα did not reduce EC IL-6 release, and, similarly, MP from thrombin-stimulated platelets did not induce IL-6 release from endothelium. EC stimulation with leukocyte MP did not result in activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and was not associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, ERK1. In contrast, leukocyte MP stimulated a sustained, time-dependent increased tyrosine phosphorylation of ∼46-kDa c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK1) in EC. These findings demonstrate that circulating leukocyte MP are up-regulated by inflammatory stimulation in vivo and activate a stress signaling pathway in EC, leading to increased procoagulant and proinflammatory activity. This may provide an alternative mechanism of EC activation, potentially contributing to dysregulation of endothelial functions during vascular injury."
https://openalex.org/W2071596650,"There is a long-standing controversy regarding the mechanisms that generate the functional subdivisions of the cerebral neocortex. One model proposes that thalamic axonal input specifies these subdivisions; the competing model postulates that patterning mechanisms intrinsic to the dorsal telencephalon generate neocortical regions. Gbx-2 mutant mice, whose thalamic differentiation is disrupted, were investigated. Despite the lack of cortical innervation by thalamic axons, neocortical region-specific gene expression (Cadherin-6, EphA-7, Id-2, and RZR-beta) developed normally. This provides evidence that patterning mechanisms intrinsic to the neocortex specify the basic organization of its functional subdivisions."
https://openalex.org/W1987861824,"The origin recognition complex (ORC) is an initiator protein for DNA replication, but also effects transcriptional silencing in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and heterochromatin function in <i>Drosophila.</i> It is not known, however, whether any of these functions of ORC is conserved in mammals. We report the identification of a novel protein, HBO1 (histone acetyltransferase binding to ORC), that interacts with human ORC1 protein, the largest subunit of ORC. HBO1 exists as part of a multisubunit complex that possesses histone H3 and H4 acetyltransferase activities. A fraction of the relatively abundant HBO1 protein associates with ORC1 in human cell extracts. HBO1 is a member of the MYST domain family that includes <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Sas2p, a protein involved in control of transcriptional silencing that also has been genetically linked to ORC function. Thus the interaction between ORC and a MYST domain acetyltransferase is widely conserved. We suggest roles for ORC-mediated acetylation of chromatin in control of both DNA replication and gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2017481744,"Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) is highly expressed in bone-resorbing osteoclasts and activated macrophages. It has been suggested that a redox-active iron in the binuclear iron center of TRAP could have the capacity to react with hydrogen peroxide to produce highly destructive reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here we show that TRAP can generate ROS in vitro and that cells over-expressing TRAP produce higher amounts of intracellular ROS than their parent cells. We further demonstrate that these ROS can be targeted to destroy collagen and other proteins. In resorbing osteoclasts, TRAP was found in transcytotic vesicles transporting matrix degradation products through the cell, suggesting that TRAP-facilitated fragmentation of endocytosed material takes place in a specific cellular compartment. These results suggest that bone matrix degradation occurs not only extracellularly in the resorption lacunae but also intracellularly in the transcytotic vesicles.

Ruffled border (RB)1forms the actual resorbing organ and penetrates into bone matrix with continuous endocytosis and transcytosis of degraded matrix components (6Nesbitt S.A.

Science. 1997; 276: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Finally, resorption products are secreted to the extracellular space via a functional secretory domain (FSD) in the basolateral membrane (8Salo J. Metsikkö K. Palokangas H. Lehenkari P. Väänänen H.K. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 106: 301-307Google Scholar). In addition to active acidification and production of various proteinases, osteoclasts produce high amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during resorption (9Silverton S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 56: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, the source and exact role of ROS have remained unclear. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) is widely used as a specific marker for osteoclasts (10Minkin C. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1982; 34: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). High amounts of TRAP are also expressed in lung macrophages and in the hairy cells of the spleen in hairy cell leukemia (11Yaziji H. Janckila A.J. Lear S.C. Martin A.W. Yam L.T. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1995; 104: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). TRAP contains a binuclear iron center (12Davis J.C. Averill B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bonding. 1988; 70: 1-26Crossref Google Scholar), which has been suggested to participate in the generation of hydroxyl radicals (⋅OH) (14Sibille J.-C. Doi K. Aisen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 59-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hayman A.R. Cox T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1294-1300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The function and subcellular localization of TRAP have remained unclear despite extensive biochemical characterization and production of knock-out animals. Aging TRAP−/− mice revealed mild osteopetrosis (excess accumulation of bone) despite having a normal number and morphology of osteoclasts (16Hayman A.R. Jones S.J. Boyde A. Foster D. Colledge W.H. Carlton M.B. Evans M.J. Cox T.M. Development. 1996; 122: 3151-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To learn the physiological function of TRAP, we hypothesized that TRAP could facilitate the formation of ⋅OH and target those⋅OH to break down extracellular matrix components during bone resorption. Hydroxyl radical formation was monitored by following the formation of malondialdehyde acetal (MDA) from deoxyribose as described earlier (17Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Aruoma O.I. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 165: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar). Recombinant rat bone TRAP (18Halleen J.M. Kaija H. Stepan J.J. Salo J.J. Vihko P. Väänänen H.K. Arch. Biochem.

Ferric EDTA (0.1 mmFeCl3 in 0.2 mm EDTA) was used as a positive control and transferrin, carbonic anhydrase II (CA II), and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) as negative controls. Formation of⋅OH was further studied by adding various amounts of mannitol, a scavenger of ⋅OH (17Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Aruoma O.I. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 165: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar), to the reaction mixture containing TRAP. Color was developed by heating for 15 min at 100 °C in thiobarbituric acid and trichloroacetic acid as described (17Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Aruoma O.I. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 165: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar). The Pg-TRAP plasmid was constructed by cloning reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-cloned TRAP cDNA from human osteoclast-like cells into pCI Neo mammalian expression vector (Promega, Madison, WI) at the Eco RI site. This construct was transfected into murine macrophage-like RAW-264 cells using a cationic liposome reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Transfected cells were selected with 400 mg/ml geneticin (G418, Calbiochem-Novabiochem, San Diego, CA) over 14 days. Isolated clones were maintained in 200 mg/ml geneticin. Intracellular ROS were detected using the fluorescent probe DCFH-DA (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (20Ohba M. Shibanuma M. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Cells were grown on glass coverslips, incubated for 5 min in Hanks' solution (Life Technologies Inc.) containing 5 mm DCFH-DA, briefly rinsed in Hanks' solution, and kept at +37 °C during the measurement. Cells were excited with a 495 nm wavelength using a computer-driven filter wheel (MAC 2000, Ludl Electronic Products, New York) and a 32D neutral filter to avoid UV-induced radical production. Emitted light was collected through a dichroic mirror and an interference filter at 510 nm. Fluorescence was quantitated using an MCID image analyzer utilizing M2 software (Imaging research Inc., Brock University, Ste. Catharines, Ontario, Canada) as described (21Lehenkari P.P.

Rat bone cells were cultured for 24 h on bovine bone slices as described (22Lakkakorpi P.T. Tuukkanen J. Hentunen T. Järvelin K. Väänänen K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1989; 4: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde containing 0.2% Triton X-100. Cells were incubated with mouse TRAP antiserum (1:1000 in 0.5% bovine serum albumin/Tris-buffered saline) for 2 h (23Halleen J. Hentunen T.A. Hellman J. Väänänen H.K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1444-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). TRAP was visualized using rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Dakopatts, Glostrup, Denmark). RB was visualized using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled PNA-lectin (Sigma) (24Takagi M. Yakasaki H. Baba H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1988; 36: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Biotinylated organic bone matrix components were visualized as described (7Salo J.J. Lehenkari P. Mulari M. Metsikkö K. Väänänen H.K. Science. 1997; 276: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Bone slices were washed, embedded with 50% glycerol, and examined under a light microscope equipped with appropriate filters (Leitz Aristoplan, Wetzlar, Germany). Fluorescent images were photographed on Agfa Pan 400 film. Confocal microscopy was performed using confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Lasertechnic, Heidelberg, Germany) equipped with a multiline 750-milliwatt Omnichrome argon-krypton laser (Omnichrome, Chino. CA). Type I collagen (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) was purified from low molecular weight impurities by gel filtration using Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel filtration column equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, containing 0.3m NaCl, using HPLC equipment (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 100 μg of the purified collagen was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in a reaction mixture containing 80 nm TRAP, 0.1 mm ascorbate, 1 mm hydrogen peroxide, 5 μg (1 unit)/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2. After the reaction, a 0.5-ml aliquot was immediately chromatographed through Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel filtration column as described above. Similar experiments were also performed with ferric EDTA and transferrin. Controls were as indicated under “Results.” TRAP and EDTA-chelated iron were approximately equally potent in facilitating ⋅OH formation from H2O2, whereas transferrin did not generate⋅OH in the deoxyribose system (Fig.1 A ). Two zinc-containing osteoclast enzymes involved in bone resorption, CA II and MMP-9, were also unable to generate ⋅OH (Fig. 1 B ). The results shown in Fig. 1 B were not affected if protease inhibitors were omitted from the reaction mixture (data not shown). The ⋅OH scavenger mannitol decreased the amount of MDA formation in the presence of TRAP (data not shown). We calculated the rate constant for the reaction of mannitol with ⋅OH as described earlier (17Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Aruoma O.I. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 165: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar) and obtained a value of 1.7 × 109m−1 s−1, which is in accordance with the rate constant 1.0–2.0 × 109m−1 s−1 obtained earlier for mannitol using EDTA-chelated iron as a generator of ⋅OH in the deoxyribose system (17Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Aruoma O.I. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 165: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar). RAW-264 cells over-expressing TRAP had a significantly higher basal production of ROS than their parent cells (Fig. 1 C ). We studied the distribution of TRAP in resorbing osteoclasts and noticed that TRAP was not localized in RB (Fig. 2,A and B ). Instead, it was co-localized to intracellular vesicles containing endocytosed organic bone degradation products released from bone matrix during resorption (Fig.2 C ; see Ref. 7Salo J.J. Lehenkari P. Mulari M. Metsikkö K. Väänänen H.K. Science. 1997; 276: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). On the basis of TRAP's capacity to facilitate ROS formation and its localization in the transcytotic vesicles, we hypothesized that ROS generated by TRAP could directly damage type I collagen and other proteins. To test the hypothesis, we used the same conditions in demonstrating the generation of hydroxyl radicals by TRAP (see Fig. 1 A ) and replaced deoxyribose with type I collagen. The Mr of type I collagen incubated in the reaction mixture without trap was > 1000, and the Mr of trap incubated without type I collagen was 32 (data not shown). When type I collagen and trap were incubated together without H2O2, their Mr did not change (Fig. 3 A ). The addition of H2O2 resulted in fragmentation of most of the type I collagen into small fragments with Mr <10, whereas the Mr of trap did not change (Fig.3 B ). Experiments in which albumin was used instead of collagen revealed similar results (data not shown). Similarly to TRAP, EDTA-chelated iron efficiently destroyed collagen, whereas transferrin had no effect (data not shown), as suggested based on the deoxyribose test (see Fig. 1 A ). Osteoclasts take up resorbed bone material, which is transported through the cell and secreted through FSD (6Nesbitt S.A. Horton M.A. Science. 1997; 276: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 7Salo J.J. Lehenkari P. Mulari M. Metsikkö K. Väänänen H.K. Science. 1997; 276: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). This transcytotic route explains how osteoclasts are able to remove large amounts of matrix degradation products and simultaneously penetrate into bone. We show here that in resorbing osteoclasts, TRAP is localized in transcytotic vesicles and not in RB or in the resorption lacuna. Our results are in good agreement with those published earlier by Clark and co-workers (25Clark SA Ambrose W.W. Anderson T.R. Terell R.S. Toverud S.U. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1989; 4: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), who demonstrated by immunoelectron microscopy that TRAP is localized in large cytoplasmic vesicles and not in RB. We suggest that TRAP-containing vesicles from the biosynthetic pathway are fused to transcytotic vesicles transporting matrix degradation products from RB to FSD, where the enzyme is secreted together with the matrix degradation products. Based on our results, we hypothesize that the physiological function of TRAP in osteoclasts is to destroy endocytosed matrix degradation products during their transcytosis. Thus, matrix degradation would occur not only extracellularly in the resorption lacunae but also intracellularly in the transcytotic vesicles. TRAP knock-out mice show disrupted endochondral ossification and mild osteopetrosis (16Hayman A.R. Jones S.J. Boyde A. Foster D. Colledge W.H. Carlton M.B. Evans M.J. Cox T.M. Development. 1996; 122: 3151-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If our hypothesis were correct, TRAP would not have any effect on the attachment of osteoclasts to bone in the normal bone remodeling cycle. Nor would TRAP affect development of the RB, acidification of the resorption lacuna, degradation of bone matrix in the resorption lacunae, or endocytosis of dissolved bone material. The only effect would be on the processing of the endocytosed matrix components during transcytosis. Thus, inactivation of TRAP would most probably result in only a small decrease in bone resorption, which would be in good agreement with the observed mild osteopetrosis in TRAP knock-out mice. Bone resorption produces various breakdown products of bone matrix components into serum and urine (26Garnero P. Delmas P.D. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996: 1277-1291Google Scholar). Clinical studies indicate that stimulated bone resorption leads to increased levels of TRAP in the serum (23Halleen J. Hentunen T.A.

Res. 1998; 13: 683-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), suggesting that osteoclasts would secrete TRAP into the circulation during bone resorption, where it is found intact in a large calcium-containing complex (28Halleen J.M. Hentunen T.A. Karp M. Käkönen S.-M. Pettersson K. Väänänen H.K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 683-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Our results show that TRAP-facilitated ROS formation leads to fragmentation of collagen and other proteins. However, TRAP molecules themselves are not targets for this fragmentation. This result is in accordance with the in vivo findings that matrix proteins such as collagen, but not TRAP, are found as small fragments in the circulation (26Garnero P. Delmas P.D. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996: 1277-1291Google Scholar, 28Halleen J.M. Hentunen T.A. Karp M. Käkönen S.-M. Pettersson K. Väänänen H.K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 683-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Our results clearly demonstrate that TRAP is capable of generating ROS that can destroy proteins in vitro . This activity of TRAP was not inhibited by protease inhibitors, and a similar activity was not observed in the same conditions for transferrin, an iron-containing protein without redox-active iron, and for CA II and MMP-9, two zinc-containing osteoclast enzymes involved in bone resorption. Instead, a similar activity was observed for EDTA-chelated redox-active iron. These observations suggest that the redox-active iron in TRAP would be active in generating ROS. The fact that the TRAP over-expressing cells produce high amounts of ROS further supports this hypothesis, although it is possible that some amount of the ROS in the cells is generated because of cell damage. Iron-catalyzed ⋅OH formation from hydrogen peroxide by the Fenton reaction is well known to cause DNA damage (29Henle E.S. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19095-19098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Hydroxyl radicals also affect proteins by destroying the peptide backbone and by attacking some amino acid side chains, resulting in the fragmentation of proteins and the formation of aggregates (30Davies K.J.A. Delsignore M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9908-9913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20313-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2808) Google Scholar). Instead,⋅OH in combination with the superoxide anion (O2) cause protein fragmentation without the formation of aggregates (30Davies K.J.A. Delsignore M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9908-9913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate the fragmentation of proteins by ⋅OH generated by TRAP without aggregate formation, suggesting that O2 would also be present in the reaction mixture. When the redox-active iron in the binuclear iron center of TRAP is in the ferrous form, it can react with H2O2 by the Fenton reaction to produce a ferric ion and ⋅OH: Fe2+ + H2O2 → Fe3+ + OH-+ ⋅OH. The newly formed ferric ion is still redox-active and able to react with H2O2 to form O2 and a ferrous ion: Fe3+ + H2O2 → Fe2+ + 2 H+ + O2. The formed ferrous ion is again able to react by the Fenton reaction etc. Thus, a sequence of reactions generating both⋅OH and O2 occurs with continuous oxidation and reduction of the redox-active iron, making it possible for one enzyme molecule to generate a high number of these ROS as long as H2O2 is available. In addition to osteoclasts, activated macrophages such as alveolar macrophages of the lung express high amounts of TRAP in normal human tissues (11Yaziji H. Janckila A.J. Lear S.C. Martin A.W. Yam L.T. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1995; 104: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We have reported earlier that the enzymes purified from these two cell types have identical catalytic properties, suggesting that TRAP would have a similar physiological function in both osteoclasts and macrophages (18Halleen J.M. Kaija H. Stepan J.J. Salo J.J. Vihko P. Väänänen H.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The transcytotic route in osteoclasts represents a transport route from a late-endosome or lysosome-type compartment (RB membrane) to the cell surface. Another example of such a route is the transport route operating during antigen processing before presentation in macrophages. The mechanisms involved in antigen processing are not known. We hypothesize that TRAP could function in activated macrophages in the antigen presentation route generating ROS that would be targeted in antigen processing. The role of ROS in the physiological degradation of the extracellular matrix and in tissue remodeling is unknown. Our results demonstrate that in specific cellular compartments of osteoclasts, TRAP-facilitated ROS production can be targeted to destroy extracellular matrix proteins. We propose that the family of proteins containing redox-active iron could represent a novel mechanism of physiological fragmentation in organic molecules. This mechanism could be important in tissue remodeling and as a defense mechanism of phagocytosing cells."

Elimination of DNA-damaged cells after ultraviolet radiation (UVR) through sunburn cell (apoptotic keratinocyte) formation is thought to be pivotal for the removal of precancerous skin cells. Sunburn cell formation was found to be dependent on Fas ligand (FasL), a pro-apoptotic protein induced by DNA damage. Chronic exposure to UVR caused 14 of 20 (70 percent) FasL-deficient mice and 1 of 20 (5 percent) wild-type mice to accumulate p53 mutations in the epidermis. Thus, FasL-mediated apoptosis is important for skin homeostasis, suggesting that the dysregulation of Fas-FasL interactions may be central to the development of skin cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2018434369,"The multifunctional cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) regulates growth and differentiation of many cell types and induces production of acute-phase proteins in hepatocytes. Here we report that IL-6 protects hepatoma cells from apoptosis induced by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), a well known apoptotic inducer in liver cells. Addition of IL-6 blocked TGF-β-induced activation of caspase-3 while showing no effect on the induction of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and p15INK4B genes, indicating that IL-6 interferes with only a subset of TGF-β activities. To further elucidate the mechanism of this anti-apoptotic effect of IL-6, we investigated which signaling pathway transduced by IL-6 is responsible for this effect. IL-6 stimulation of hepatoma cells induced a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and its kinase activity followed by the activation of Akt. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase by wortmannin or LY294002 abolished the protection of IL-6 against TGF-β-induced apoptosis. A dominant-negative Akt also abrogated this anti-apoptotic effect. Dominant-negative inhibition of STAT3, however, only weakly attenuated the IL-6-induced protection. Finally, inhibition of both STAT3 and PI 3-kinase by treating cells overexpressing the dominant-negative STAT3 with LY294002 completely blocked IL-6-induced survival signal. Thus, concomitant activation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt and the STAT3 pathways mediates the anti-apoptotic effect of IL-6 against TGF-β, with the former likely playing a major role in this anti-apoptosis.

Maintenance of the size of liver is a notable example of homeostasis which is heavily regulated by many growth factors and cytokines (1Michalopoulos G.K. DeFrances M.C. Science. 1997; 276: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2928) Google Scholar). Among these factors, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)1 is a potent inducer of apoptosis in hepatocytes and several hepatoma cell lines, as well as in regressing liver in vivo (2Fan G. Ma X.

Science. 1997; 276: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2928) Google Scholar). TGF-β exerts its biological effects through the action of two types of transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors. These receptors subsequently propagate the signal by phosphorylating the intracellular targets, Smads. Phosphorylated Smad2 or Smad3 can form a stable complex with Smad4, which then translocates to the nucleus to regulate transcriptional responses to TGF-β (8Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P.

Although the signal transduction pathway of TGF-β has been well studied, mechanism of its apoptotic effect is still not fully characterized. Nevertheless, induction of oxidative stress (6S‡nchez A.

Ma X. Kren B. Steer C.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1909-1919PubMed Google Scholar) have been implicated in mediating TGF-β-induced apoptosis. TGF-β-induced apoptosis in liver cells is blocked by growth factors such as insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 as well as by elevated expression of insulin receptor substrate-1 (12Tanaka S. Wands J.R. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 391-394Google Scholar). Our recent studies have revealed that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and its downstream target, Akt, are responsible for the anti-apoptotic activity of insulin against TGF-β (13Chen R.-H. Su Y.-H. Chuang R.L.C. Chang T.-Y. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1959-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar).

PI 3-kinase elicits this anti-apoptotic activity through the action of the serine/threonine kinase, Akt. Recent studies have demonstrated that activated Akt can phosphorylate the proapoptotic protein BAD (20Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E.

This phosphorylation allows for BAD association with 14-3-3 and dissociation from BCL-XL, which is then free to resume its function as a suppressor of apoptosis (22Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2260) Google Scholar).

In the liver, IL-6 induces synthesis of acute-phase proteins and plays central roles in preventing acute hepatitis and initiating liver regeneration (25Mizuhara H. O'Neill E. Seki N. Ogawa T.

Mice with targeted disruption of the IL-6 gene have impaired liver regeneration characterized by liver necrosis and failure (26Cressman D. Greenbaum L. DeAngelis R. Ciliberto G. Furth E. Poli V.

In hematopoietic cells, binding IL-6 to the α subunit of its receptor triggers the recruitment of gp130, subsequently leading to the activation of the gp130-associated Janus kinases (JAKs) (27Murakami M.

JAKs phosphorylate gp130 on several tyrosine residues and these phosphotyrosines recruit various SH2 domain-containing proteins, such as STAT3 and SHP-2 (30Akira S. Nishio Y. Inoue M. Wang X.J.

Science. 1993; 261: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). SHP-2 links cytokine receptor to the Ras/MAP kinase pathway and is essential for mitogenic activity, whereas STAT3 can induce BCL-2 and is involved in anti-apoptosis (33Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). In addition to JAK/STAT and Ras/MAP kinase pathways, IL-6 was recently shown to activate PI 3-kinase in prostate cancer cells (34Qiu Y. Robinson D. Pretlow T.G. Kung H.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3644-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Whether IL-6 in liver cells activates these pathways remains to be investigated. In the liver, IL-6 acts as a hepatoprotecting and/or mitogenic factor, whereas TGF-β elicits an apoptotic and/or growth-arresting effect. In this study, we elucidate a cross-talk between signaling pathways induced by these two factors in liver cells. Our results indicate that IL-6 suppressed TGF-β-induced apoptotic death of hepatoma cells in a dose-dependent manner. IL-6 inhibited TGF-β-induced activation of caspase-3 but did not affect its induction of an extracellular matrix protein and a cell cycle inhibitor, suggesting that IL-6 signaling blocks only the apoptotic signaling of TGF-β. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the concomitant activation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt and the STAT3 signaling pathways mediates the anti-apoptotic effect of IL-6 against TGF-β. Human hepatoma cell line Hep3B was cultured as described previously (11Chen R.-H. Chang T.Y. Cell Growth Diff. 1997; 8: 821-827PubMed Google Scholar). Hep3B cells stably expressing the dominant-negative mutant of Akt were reported previously (13Chen R.-H. Su Y.-H. Chuang R.L.C. Chang T.-Y. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1959-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For transient transfection, cells were harvested at 48 h after transfection. For selecting of stable clones, G418 (700 μg/ml) was added into culture medium at 48 h after transfection. The G418-resistant clones were individually picked, expanded, and assayed for expression of the transfected cDNAs by Western blotting. Mammalian expression plasmids for the two dominant-negative mutants of STAT3, STAT3D and STAT3F (35Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Ichiba M. Kiuchi N. Kitaoka T. Fukada T. Hibi M.

Antibodies for p85 subunit of the PI 3-kinase, Akt, and phosphotyrosine were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-STAT3 antibody was from UBI. Wortmannin and LY294002, the two PI 3-kinase inhibitors, were from Sigma. Apoptosis was quantitated with TUNEL and Cell-Death Detection ELISA assays. For TUNEL assay (36Gavrieli Y. Sheman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9180) Google Scholar), cells seeded on chamber slides were serum starved for 24 h and then treated with or without various cytokines and/or agents for 18 h. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% sodium citrate. TUNEL assays were performed using the In Situ Death Detection Kit, Fluorescein (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Apoptotic cells were visualized with fluorescence microscopy. The Cell-Death Detection ELISA assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) measures the presence of soluble histone-DNA complex as a result of DNA fragmentation (37Thome M. Schneider P. Hofmann K.

For this assay, cells were seeded on 96-well plates at a density of 0.5 × 104 cells/well and were serum-starved and treated with various agents as for TUNEL assays. Cell-Death ELISA assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were seeded onto 6-well plates, serum starved for 24 h, and treated with or without TGF-β (5 ng/ml) and/or IL-6 (60 ng/ml) for various times. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin and cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm. Cell lysate containing 100 μg of proteins in a 1-ml assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA was incubated with a fluorogenic peptide substrate, Ac-DEVD-AMC (5.6 μm) at 37 °C for 30 min.

Derynck, contain the luciferase expression unit driven by the TGF-β-responsive elements in p15INK4B and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) promoters, respectively. These plasmids, together with a plasmid for constitutive expression of β-galactosidase, were transfected to Hep3B. One day after transfection, the cells were serum-starved for 10 h and then treated with TGF-β (5 ng/ml) and/or IL-6 (60 ng/ml) for 12 h. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were quantitated by the Luciferase Assay System and the β-galactosidase Enzyme Assay System (Promega), respectively. PI 3-kinase activities were assayed as described previously (40Whitman M. Kaplan D.R. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L. Roberts T.M. Nature. 1985; 315: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Briefly, 107 cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm orthovanadate). Cell extracts were incubated with 1 μg of anti-phosphotyrosine antibody overnight at 4 °C. The immunocomplex was precipitated with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C, washed three times with lysis buffer, twice with LiCl buffer (0.5 m LiCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.6) and twice with TNE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA). The immunocomplex was preincubated with 10 μl of 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), containing 2 mg/ml PI (Sigma) on ice for 10 min. Kinase reaction was performed by the addition of 40 μl of reaction buffer (10 μCi of [γ-32P] ATP, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 20 μm ATP, 5 mmMgCl2) at room temperature for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 1 m HCl and extracted with 200 μl of a 1:1 mixture of chloroform and methanol. The radiolabeled lipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography and visualized using a PhosphorImager. Akt kinase assays were performed essentially as described (41King W.G. Mattaliano M.D. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4406-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mmsodium fluoride, 1 mm NaVO4, 1 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 2 μm aprotinin, 2 μmleupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The HA-tagged Akt was precipitated from cell lysates with anti-HA antibody followed by protein A-Sepharose conjugated with rabbit anti-mouse antibody. The immunocomplexes were washed once with Akt kinase buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mmMgCl2 and then incubated in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μm ATP, 100 μg of histone 2B, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. The kinase reaction was terminated by addition of an equal volume of 2 times SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were boiled for 5 min prior to electrophoretic separation by SDS-PAGE. Previous studies revealed that human hepatoma cell line Hep3B is highly sensitive to the apoptotic activity of TGF-β (4Lin J.K. Chou C.K. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 385-388PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether IL-6 affects apoptosis induced by TGF-β, Hep3B cells were co-treated with 5 ng/ml TGF-β and IL-6 at various concentrations. Using an ELISA assay measuring the presence of soluble histone-DNA complex resulted from DNA fragmentation, we observed that IL-6 suppressed TGF-β-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1, A and B ). The anti-apoptotic effect of IL-6 was readily detected at a dose as low as 0.1 ng/ml (Fig. 1 A ). At a concentration of 60 ng/ml, IL-6 elicited a maximal protection. Notably, in the absence of TGF-β, IL-6 did not promote nor suppress cell survival (Fig. 1 B ). These findings suggest the existence of a cross-talk between the signaling pathways transduced by TGF-β and IL-6. To explore the mechanism by which IL-6 signaling prevents TGF-β-induced apoptosis, we investigated whether IL-6 could block all cellular responses to TGF-β or affect only a subset of the activities. The PAI-1 and p15INK4B genes are highly induced by TGF-β and are frequently used as indicators for the effects of TGF-β on production of extracellular matrix and cell cycle arrest, respectively (42Yingling J.M. Datto M.B. Wong C. Frederick J.P. Liberati N.T. Wang X.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7019-7028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Hu P.P. Datto M.B. Wang X.-F. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 349-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reporter plasmid p800luc, containing the TGF-β responsive element in PAI-1 promoter (39Feng X.-H. Filvaroff E.H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24237-24245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), was used to evaluate the induction of PAI-1 gene. When Hep3B cells were transiently transfected with this reporter, TGF-β induced a ∼3.5-fold increase in luciferase activity. This induction was not significantly affected by co-treatment with IL-6 at 60 ng/ml (Fig.2 A ), i.e. a dosage that showed a maximal inhibition of TGF-β-induced apoptosis (Fig.1 B ). Similar results were observed using the p15P113-luc reporter (38Li J.-M. Nichols M.A. Chandrasekharan S. Xiong Y. Wang X.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26750-26753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) containing the p15INK4B promoter (Fig.2 B ). Our data thus indicate that IL-6, although preventing apoptosis induced by TGF-β, did not affect the transcriptional up-regulation of PAI-1 and p15INK4B genes in response to TGF-β. IL-6 signaling is likely to block a step specific to the apoptotic activity of TGF-β. Our previous studies demonstrated that caspase-3 is activated upon TGF-β treatment of Hep3B cells (13Chen R.-H. Su Y.-H. Chuang R.L.C. Chang T.-Y. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1959-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether IL-6 could block this activity of TGF-β, cell extract derived from Hep3B treated with or without TGF-β and/or IL-6 was analyzed for caspase-3 activity by measuring cleavage of a fluorogenic substrate, Ac-DEVD-AMC. As shown in Fig. 3, TGF-β-induced caspase activity was abolished by co-treatment of IL-6. This finding suggests that IL-6 signaling prevents the apoptotic activity of TGF-β by inhibiting the activation of caspase-3. Our previous studies indicated not only that the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway mediates the anti-apoptotic signal of insulin against TGF-β but also that this signal leads to a blockage of caspase-3 activation in response to TGF-β (13Chen R.-H. Su Y.-H. Chuang R.L.C. Chang T.-Y. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1959-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to investigate whether IL-6 induces PI 3-kinase in Hep3B cells and whether the anti-apoptotic activity of IL-6 is mediated through the function of PI 3-kinase. We observed that IL-6 treatment of Hep3B cells stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase, p85, as determined by immunoprecipitations with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody followed by Western blotting using an anti-p85 antibody (Fig. 4 A ). Furthermore, IL-6 induced a substantial increase of PI 3-kinase activity in immunoprecipitates with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 4 B ). Both tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 and PI 3-kinase activity were readily evident within 5 min and declined at 60 min after exposure to IL-6, indicating a rapid activation of PI 3-kinase by IL-6. To determine the involvement of PI 3-kinase in the anti-apoptotic effect of IL-6, two specific inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, wortmannin and LY294002 (44Powis G. Bonjouklian R. Berggern M. Vlahos C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2419-2423PubMed Google Scholar, 45Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were used. As shown in Fig.4 C , wortmannin markedly diminished the anti-apoptotic activity of IL-6 at a dose of 10 nm. A similar finding was observed with 25 μm LY294002. However, these two inhibitors did not by themselves induce apoptosis in the absence of TGF-β. Taken together, our results demonstrated a critical role of PI 3-kinase in the anti-apoptotic signaling of IL-6 against TGF-β. Having demonstrated the involvement of PI 3-kinase in the anti-apoptotic signaling of IL-6, we next investigated whether the serine/threonine kinase Akt, a downstream target of PI 3-kinase, is a critical component of this anti-apoptotic signaling pathway. Attempts to evaluate the activity of endogenous Akt were hindered by the lack of an antibody that could efficiently immunoprecipitate Akt from the lysates of Hep3B cells. Therefore, an HA-tagged Akt (19Kulik G. Klippel A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar) was transiently transfected into Hep3B cells. The transfected cells were treated with IL-6 for various time intervals and cell lysates were used for immunoprecipitations with an anti-HA antibody followed by in vitro kinase assays. As shown in Fig. 5 A , IL-6 substantially increased Akt activity, and the kinetics of Akt activation resembled that of the IL-6-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 (Fig.4 A ). Furthermore, both LY294002 and wortmannin efficiently suppressed the IL-6-induced Akt activity, indicating that the activation of Akt by IL-6 is mediated through PI 3-kinase. To assess the role of Akt in the anti-apoptotic activity of IL-6 against TGF-β, we evaluated whether a dominant-negative mutant of Akt can block IL-6-induced protection. Our previous study generated Hep3B cells stably expressing a kinase-defective mutant of Akt (Akt 179A) (13Chen R.-H. Su Y.-H. Chuang R.L.C. Chang T.-Y. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1959-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), which can inhibit wild type Akt in a dominant-negative fashion (19Kulik G. Klippel A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Akt(K−)-8, a stable transfectant of Hep3B expressing a high level of such mutated Akt, exhibited a markedly reduced protection of IL-6 against TGF-β (Fig. 5 B ). A similar but less prominent reduction of IL-6-induced anti-apoptosis was observed using a mixture of eight stable clones, Akt(K−)-M (13Chen R.-H. Su Y.-H. Chuang R.L.C. Chang T.-Y. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1959-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), expressing a lower level of the mutated Akt (Fig. 5 B ). Taken together, our findings indicate that the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway is activated by IL-6 and mediates the anti-apoptotic effect of IL-6. In hematopoietic cells, STAT3 mediates the survival signal of cytokines through its ability to induce BCL-2 (33Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). To investigate whether STAT3 is involved in suppressing TGF-β-induced apoptosis by IL-6, a STAT3 dominant-negative mutant (STAT3D) carrying EE to AA substitutions at positions 434 and 435 (35Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Ichiba M. Kiuchi N. Kitaoka T. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) was introduced to Hep3B cells. Seven stable transfectants were generated and Fig.6 A displayed the expression levels of the endogenous, wild type STAT3 and the mutant proteins in these cells. A high expressor (STAT3D-1) and a mixture of all seven clones (STAT3D-M) were analyzed in terms of their responsiveness to IL-6-induced anti-apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 6 B , IL-6 induced a slightly reduced protection against TGF-β-induced apoptosis in both STAT3D-1 and STAT3D-M cells, comparing to the parental Hep3B cells. This reduction was consistently observed in three independent experiments (Table I). In addition, this reduced protection was also observed from Hep3B cells stably expressing a second STAT3 dominant-negative mutant, STAT3F (35Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Ichiba M. Kiuchi N. Kitaoka T. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Thus, our results suggest that STAT3 is involved in the anti-apoptotic signaling of IL-6.Table IApoptotic death of Hep3B and STAT3D stable transfectants induced by TGF-β and/or IL-6CellTreatmentApoptotic cells1-aApoptotic cells were quantitated by Cell-Death Detection ELISA kit.

Tax expression triggers persistent phosphorylation and degradation of the NF-κB inhibitory proteins IκBα and IκBβ, resulting in constitutive nuclear expression of NF-κB. Recent studies demonstrate that Tax activates the IκB kinase (IKK), although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this report, we show that Tax physically interacts with a regulatory component of the IKK complex, the NF-κB essential modulator or IKKγ (NEMO/IKKγ). This molecular interaction appears to be important for recruiting Tax to the IKK catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ. Expression of NEMO/IKKγ greatly promotes binding of Tax to IKKα and IKKβ and stimulates Tax-mediated IKK activation. Interestingly, a mutant form of Tax defective in IKK activation exhibited a markedly diminished level of NEMO/IKKγ association.

Tax alters the expression of a large number of cellular genes involved in cell growth and survival, which appears to contribute to the oncogenic activity of this viral protein (2Green P.L.

Upon activation, IKK phosphorylates IκBα and IκBβ at two regulatory N-terminal serine residues, causing rapid ubiquitination and proteolysis of these NF-κB inhibitors, which allows the released NF-κB to enter the nucleus and activate target genes (10Stancovski I.

In this paper, we show that Tax physically interacts with NEMO/IKKγ, which facilitates the recruitment of Tax to the catalytic subunits IKKα and IKKβ and promotes Tax-mediated activation of IKK. The pcDNA-HA vector was constructed by inserting a copy of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA) together with the translation initiation codon (ATG) into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). To generate pcDNA-HA-NEMO/IKKγ, the murine NEMO cDNA (provided by Drs. S. Yamaoka and A. Isrëal (17Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A.

Truncation mutants of NEMO/IKKγ were generated by restriction digestion and designated by the specific amino acid residues retained in the mutant proteins. For example, NEMO/IKKγ-(1–312) contains the N-terminal 312 amino acids. pCMV4-HA-NIK was generated by inserting HA-tagged human NIK cDNA (provided by Dr. David Wallach (20Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P.

The anti-HA and anti-IKKγ monoclonal antibodies were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and Imgenex Corp., respectively. The anti-Tax monoclonal antibody was prepared from a hybridoma (168B17-46-34) provided by the AIDS Research and Reference Program, NIAID, National Institutes of Health. All the other antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Human 293 kidney carcinoma cells were seeded in 0.1% gelatin-treated six-well plates (1 × 105 cells/well) and transfected using DEAE-dextran with the indicated cDNA expression vectors. The DNA amounts used for the transfections were normalized based on the expression efficiency of each of the expression vectors: 50 ng for IKKα, IKKβ, MEKK1, and NIK; 50–200 ng for NEMO/IKKγ and its truncation mutants; 0.5 μg for Tax and its mutants. After 40 h, recipient cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01 volume of a protease inhibitor mixture (34Ganchi P.A. Sun S.-C. Greene W.C. Ballard D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1339-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar)). The RIPA buffer was also used to prepare whole-cell extracts from the HTLV-I-infected SLB-1 cells (24Uhlik M. Good L. Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Zandi E. Karin M. Sun S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21132-21136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). IP was performed as described previously (34Ganchi P.A. Sun S.-C. Greene W.C. Ballard D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1339-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and the precipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting. For immunoblotting analyses of IκBα phosphorylation, 293 cells were transfected in 24-well plates. Whole-cell extracts were prepared in ELB buffer (34Ganchi P.A. Sun S.-C. Greene W.C. Ballard D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1339-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors and analyzed by immunoblotting (34Ganchi P.A. Sun S.-C. Greene W.C. Ballard D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1339-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Prior studies suggest that Tax interacts with the IKK catalytic subunits IKKα and IKKβ (23Chu Z.-L. DiDonato J.A. Hawiger J. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15891-15894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) as well as the upstream kinase MEKK1 (22Yin M.-J. Christerson L.B. Yamamoto Y. Kwak Y.-T. Xu S. Mercurio F. Barbose M. Cobb M.H. Gaynor R.B. Cell. 1998; 93: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, since the IKK components are present in a large complex in intact cells, it remains unknown which component serves as the primary target of Tax. To address this question, co-IP was performed using a high stringency binding buffer (RIPA) to assess the relative binding affinity of Tax with the different molecular components of the IKK complex. Tax was transiently expressed in 293 cells either alone or together with each of the known IKK components, including IKKα, IKKβ, NEMO/IKKγ, MEKK1, and NIK, all of which were tagged with the HA antigenic epitope. In the absence of an IKK component, Tax was not precipitated by the anti-HA antibody (Fig.1 A , lane 3 ), although this protein was readily precipitated by the anti-Tax antibody (lane 2 ), demonstrating the specificity of the antibodies. Under these conditions, a small amount of Tax was coprecipitated with IKKα and NIK (lanes 4 and 8 ). Coprecipitation of Tax with IKKβ and MEKK1 was also detected after an extended exposure time (data not shown). Importantly, the IP assays revealed a remarkably higher amount of Tax coprecipitated with NEMO/IKKγ (Fig.1 A , lane 6 ). Thus, while Tax may weakly bind to various components of the IKK complex, NEMO/IKKγ appears to be a major target of this viral transactivator protein. To address the physiological relevance of this finding, we examined the interaction between Tax and NEMO/IKKγ in HTLV-I-infected T-cells. As expected, Tax was readily detected from the immune complex precipitated by the anti-Tax antibody (Fig. 1 C , lane 2 ), but not from that precipitated by a preimmune serum (lane 1 ). More importantly, a significant amount of Tax was coprecipitated with IKKγ by an IKKγ-specific antibody (lane 3 ). These findings clearly demonstrated that Tax stably binds to NEMO/IKKγ in both transfected and HTLV-I-infected cells. NEMO/IKKγ is known to form a stable complex with IKKα and IKKβ in vivo (17Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A.

Nature. 1998; 17: 297-300Crossref Scopus (845) Google Scholar). To map the regions of NEMO/IKKγ involved in binding to the IKK catalytic subunits and Tax, progressive truncations were generated from both the N and C termini of NEMO/IKKγ. Deletion of the N-terminal 110 amino acids of NEMO/IKKγ did not affect its binding to IKKα (Fig.2 A , lane 3 ) or Tax (lane 10 ). Deletion of up to 292 amino acids from the C terminus also did not affect the IKKα association (lanes 4–6 ), although further removal of 8 amino acids generated a mutant (1–112) that no longer bound IKKα (lane 7 ). In contrast to that seen with IKKα, Tax interaction with NEMO/IKKγ required the C-terminal sequences of NEMO/IKKγ. Removal of 100 amino acids from this end of the molecule significantly reduced, although not abolished, its interaction with Tax (Fig. 2 A , lane 11 ). This low level binding activity was also detected between Tax and an IKKγ mutant lacking its C-terminal 157 amino acids (lane 12 ). However, further deletion of 135 or more amino acids from this end generated IKKγ mutants (1–120 and 1–112), which completely lost Tax-binding activity (lanes 13 and 14 ). Of note, IKKγ-(1–120) still retained its IKKα binding activity. Thus, while the N-terminal 120 amino acids of NEMO/IKKγ are sufficient for binding to IKKα, the C-terminal region is required for strong interaction with Tax. To assess the role of the interaction between Tax and NEMO/IKKγ in IKK activation, we examined the effect of NEMO/IKKγ on Tax interaction with the catalytic subunits of IKK and on Tax-mediated IKK activation. For these studies, Tax was coexpressed with HA-tagged IKKα or IKKβ together with either the full-length NEMO/IKKγ or its C-terminal truncation mutant, 1–312. We found that the low level interaction of IKKα and IKKβ with Tax could be more readily detected when the IP was performed using the anti-Tax antibody (Fig.3 A , lanes 2 and5 ). More importantly, the interaction of Tax with both IKKα and IKKβ was remarkably enhanced by the full-length NEMO/IKKγ (lanes 3 and 6 ). Parallel immunoblotting assays showed that NEMO/IKKγ did not affect the expression level of the IKKs (data not shown). Furthermore, this stimulatory effect was only weakly detected with the NEMO/IKKγ-(1–312) (lanes 4 and 7 ), a C-terminal truncation mutant exhibiting reduced affinity in Tax binding (see Fig. 2 A ). We then examined the effect of NEMO/IKKγ on Tax-mediated IKK activation by measuring the in vivo phosphorylation of its substrate IκBα. In this regard, the in vivo IκBα phosphorylation could be detected by immunoblotting since the phosphorylated IκBα migrates more slowly on SDS gels (27Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A.

As we reported previously (24Uhlik M. Good L. Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Zandi E. Karin M. Sun S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21132-21136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), expression of IKKβ alone or together with Tax in 293 cells did not induce appreciable IκBα phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B , upper panel ,lanes 1 and 2 ). However, when these cells were cotransfected with the full-length NEMO/IKKγ, the IKKβ kinase activity was markedly induced, resulting in the potent phosphorylation of the substrate IκBα (upper panel , lanes 5 and 6 , IκBα-P ). Degradation of IκBα became evident when a higher dose of NEMO/IKKγ was used (lane 6 , upper panel ). We also observed that Tax induces the autophosphorylation of IKKβ in the presence of NEMO/IKKγ (middle panel , lanes 5 and 6 ,IKKβ-P ). These functional effects were not significantly detected with the NEMO/IKKγ-(1–312) (lanes 3 and4 ). Furthermore, NEMO/IKKγ was unable to activate IKKβ in the absence of Tax (Fig. 3 C ). Together, these results strongly suggest that NEMO/IKKγ promotes association of Tax with the IKK catalytic subunits and stimulates Tax-mediated IKK activation. To assess the role of upstream kinases in the IKKγ-dependent induction of IKKβ by Tax, we examined the effect of a dominant-negative NIK (DN-NIK) on the in vivo phosphorylation of IκBα triggered by Tax (Fig.3 D ). As expected, phosphorylated form of IκBα was readily detected in cells transfected with IKKβ together with NEMO/IKKγ and Tax (lane 1 ). Cotransfection of the DN-NIK led to a partial inhibition of the IκBα phosphorylation. Thus, it is likely that Tax-mediated activation of IKK may involve both its physical interaction with IKK and the participation of upstream kinases. To further assess the functional importance of Tax interaction with NEMO/IKKγ, we examined the ability of two well characterized Tax mutants, M22 and M47 (33Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), to interact with NEMO/IKKγ. The M22 is defective in IKK activation and induction of NF-κB nuclear expression, while M47 remains competent in these functions (22Yin M.-J. Christerson L.B. Yamamoto Y. Kwak Y.-T. Xu S. Mercurio F.

Interestingly, co-IP assays revealed that while the wild type Tax and M47 both strongly interacted with NEMO/IKKγ (Fig.4, upper panel , lanes 2 and 4 ), only a marginal NEMO/IKKγ binding activity was detected with M22 (lane 3 ). Thus, the physical interaction of Tax with NEMO/IKKγ is well correlated with its ability to activate the IKK catalytic subunits. HTLV-I-encoded Tax protein is a potent activator of the cellular transcription factor NF-κB. Tax activation of NF-κB involves phosphorylation and degradation of the NF-κB inhibitory proteins IκBα and IκBβ (26Sun S.-C. Elwood J. Béraud C. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell.

Marcu K.B. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5157-5165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Tax activates IKK remains elusive. A recent study suggests that the NEMO/IKKγ subunit of IKK is essential for Tax-mediated NF-κB activation, although it is unclear how this noncatalytic signaling protein participates in Tax activation of IKK (17Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). Our current data demonstrate that NEMO/IKKγ physically interacts with Tax in both transfected 293 cells and HTLV-I-infected T-cells. Under stringent IP conditions, NEMO/IKKγ exhibited markedly higher Tax binding activity than various other IKK components (Fig. 1). The functional importance of this physical interaction in Tax-mediated activation of IKK is supported by the experiments performed with Tax mutants (Fig. 4). The M22 mutant, known to be defective in IKK activation (22Yin M.-J. Christerson L.B. Yamamoto Y. Kwak Y.-T. Xu S. Mercurio F. Barbose M. Cobb M.H. Gaynor R.B.

Marcu K.B. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5157-5165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), exhibits strikingly reduced binding to NEMO/IKKγ. How could the binding of NEMO/IKKγ to Tax contribute to Tax activation of IKK? One potential mechanism is that NEMO/IKKγ serves as an adaptor molecule to recruit Tax to the IKK catalytic subunits. As shown in Fig. 2, the C-terminal region of NEMO/IKKγ is required for its strong binding to Tax, whereas the N-terminal region of NEMO/IKKγ mediates interaction with IKKα. Although further studies are required to demonstrate that NEMO/IKKγ can form a heterotrimer with Tax and IKKα (or IKKβ), our current data show that NEMO/IKKγ indeed promotes the binding of Tax to IKKα and IKKβ as well as stimulates the Tax-mediated IKK activation (Fig. 3). Furthermore, these functions were not significantly detected with a NEMO/IKKγ C-terminal truncation mutant, 1–312, which exhibits markedly reduced Tax binding activity. It remains to be further studied how the recruitment of Tax to IKK complex triggers IKK activation. A recent study suggests that Tax also physically interacts with MEKK1 and activates the catalytic activity of this IKK-activating kinase (22Yin M.-J. Christerson L.B. Yamamoto Y. Kwak Y.-T. Xu S. Mercurio F. Barbose M. Cobb M.H. Gaynor R.B. Cell. 1998; 93: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Thus, an intriguing model is that Tax recruits upstream kinases, such as MEKK1, to the IKK complex, thus triggering phosphorylation-dependent IKK activation. However, interaction of Tax with MEKK1 appears to be relatively weak under the stringent IP conditions used in this study (Fig. 1). We have shown previously that NIK is functionally involved in Tax activation of IKK, although this kinase also does not strongly bind to Tax. It remains to be examined whether the weak interaction of Tax with MEKK1 or NIK is sufficient to recruit these upstream kinases to IKK. Nevertheless, we have shown that the IKKγ-dependent IKK activation by Tax is at least partially sensitive to DN-NIK. This finding suggests that Tax activation of IKK may involve both Tax/IKK physical interaction and activation or recruitment of upstream kinases. We thank W. C. Greene, A. Isrëal, S. Yamaoka, M.

https://openalex.org/W2088164656,"An activation domain in p67phox (residues within 199–210) is essential for cytochromeb 558-dependent activation of NADPH superoxide (O⨪2) generation in a cell-free system (Han, C.-H., Freeman, J. L. R., Lee, T., Motalebi, S. A., and Lambeth, J. D. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 16663–16668). To determine the steady state reduction flavin in the presence of highly absorbing hemes, 8-nor-8-S -thioacetamido-FAD (“thioacetamido-FAD”) was reconstituted into the flavocytochrome, and the fluorescence of its oxidized form was monitored. Thioacetamido-FAD-reconstituted cytochrome showed lower activity (7% versus 100%) and increased steady state flavin reduction (28 versus <5%) compared with the enzyme reconstituted with native FAD. Omission of p67phox decreased the percent steady state reduction of the flavin to 4%, but omission of p47phox had little effect. The activation domain on p67phox was critical for regulating flavin reduction, since mutations in this region that decreased O⨪2generation also decreased the steady state reduction of flavin. Thus, the activation domain on p67phox regulates the reductive half-reaction for FAD. This reaction is comprised of the binding of NADPH followed by hydride transfer to the flavin. Kinetic deuterium isotope effects along with K m values permitted calculation of the K d for NADPH. (R )-NADPD but not (S )-NADPD showed kinetic deuterium isotope effects on V and V/K of about 1.9 and 1.5, respectively, demonstrating stereospecificity for theR hydride transfer. The calculated K dfor NADPH was 40 μm in the presence of wild type p67phox and was ∼55 μm using the weakly activating p67phox(V205A). Thus, the activation domain of p67phox regulates the reduction of FAD but has only a small effect on NADPH binding, consistent with a dominant effect on hydride/electron transfer from NADPH to FAD."

The signal transduction pathways triggered by antigen presentation lead to the immediate activation of transcription factors that further amplify the process of lymphocyte activation, ultimately leading to cell proliferation and division. Dysregulation of this process results in T lymphocyte anergy, autoimmunity, and disruption of T lymphocyte homeostasis (1Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1813) Google Scholar, 2Guerder S. Flavell R.A. Intern. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Two additional settings that would benefit from a better understanding of the molecular events triggered by T cell activation are viral pathogenesis and drug discovery. For example, HIV1 integrates in the chromosome of T lymphocytes where it remains latent. Its reactivation by transcription factors that are activated following T cell receptor cross-linking is relevant to the pathogenesis of AIDS (3Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar, 4Gaynor R. AIDS. 1992; 6: 347-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Finally, development of improved immunosuppressive agents that target T cell function will be accelerated by identifying the exact molecular events that result from the molecular events regulating T cell activation. Effective antigen presentation to T lymphocytes involves not only the engagement of the T cell receptor-CD3 complex but also other receptors that mediate co-activation signals such as CD28. How these two separate signal transduction pathways (TCR/CD3 and CD28) converge to result in the maximal activation of the T lymphocyte is under active study. Engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR) by its cognate peptide-major histocompatibility complex induces phospholipase C activation which hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol (5Imboded J.B. Stobo J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 161: 446-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Diacylglycerol activates protein kinases C (PKC), whereas inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate leads to the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (6Berridge M.J.

The same cellular events initiated by phospholipase C activation can be mimicked by treatment with a combination of a Ca2+ionophore that raises intracellular Ca2+ levels and phorbol esters that activate PKC isoforms (8Truneh A. Albert F. Golstein P. Schmitt-Verhulst A.-M. Nature. 1985; 313: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Free intracellular Ca2+ targets the Ca2+/calmodulin-activated phosphatase calcineurin which mediates a critical positive signal necessary for IL-2 induction through its synergy with PKC activation, synergy that can be reversed by targeting calcineurin with immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin A or FK506 (9O'Keefe S.J.

However, its functional relevance in vivo is yet unclear (30Schouten G.J. Vertegaal A.C.O. Whiteside S.T. Israël A. Toebes M. Dorsman J.C. van der Eb A.J. Zanterna A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3133-3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Previous studies addressing how the PKC- and calcineurin-dependent signal transduction pathways triggered by TCR/CD3 cross-linking lead to the synergistic activation of NF-κB identified IκBα as a target molecule (11Frantz B. Nordby E.C. Bren G. Steffan N. Paya C.V. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Keefe S.J. O'Neill E.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Whereas PKC activation by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) resulted in a moderate degree of IκBα hyperphosphorylation-degradation and activated calcineurin alone had no effect on IκBα, the combined activation of these two second messengers leads to a synergistic and highly effective hyperphosphorylation and degradation of IκBα (31Steffan N.M. Bren G.D. Frantz B. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A. Paya C.V. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4685-4691PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, whereas TCR and TNFR triggered separate signal transduction pathways, both ultimately target IκBα, and the use of specific inhibitors of calcineurin and PKC enabled the separation of the signaling pathways of TCR and TNFR (31Steffan N.M. Bren G.D. Frantz B. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A. Paya C.V. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4685-4691PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this novel observation, the mechanisms whereby two separate second messengers, PKC and calcineurin, lead to the lymphocyte-specific hyperphosphorylation of IκBα remains unknown. The recent identification of the N-terminal IκBα provides the opportunity to advance in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms, whereas signal transduction pathways triggered by TCR/CD3 cross-linking, separate from those downstream of CD28, lead to IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation in T lymphocytes. In this study we have investigated the synergy between two second messengers of the TCR/CD3 pathways, PKC and calcineurin, as regulators of the N-terminal IκBα kinases. By using primary human T lymphocytes and T lymphocyte cell lines, we demonstrate that PKC- and Ca2+-dependent pathways synergistically activate both the IKK complex and p90rsk. In contrast to the activation of the IKK complex, p90rsk activation is calcineurin-independent, and only the IKK complex (IKKβ) but not p90rsk mediates IκBα phosphorylation and NF-κB activationin vivo . Moreover, the synergistic activation of the IKK signalsome by PKC and calcineurin is inhibited by either calcineurin- or PKC-specific inhibitors suggesting that either signal transduction pathway is required and essential for effectively activating the IKK complex and, hence, NF-κB activation in T lymphocytes. The κB-luc reporter plasmid consists of three κB concatamers from the HIV-long terminal repeat cloned upstream of a concanavalin-A minimal promoter driving the expression of luciferase (32McElhinny J.A.

The pREP4/CAT plasmid, which consists of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter-enhancer driving the transcription of the CAT gene, was used to control for transfection efficiency (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). IKKβ KD (K44A) was obtained from M. Roth (Tularik, South San Francisco, CA). IKKα kinase dead (KD) (D144N) was a kind gift from Alain Israel, Institute Pasteur, Paris, France. Wild-type PKCα cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Altman, La Jolla, CA.

PMA, sodium orthovanadate,p -nitrophenyl phosphate were purchased from Sigma. Ionomycin, GF109203X (GF), Gö 6976, β-glycerophosphate, PD 098059 were purchased from Calbiochem, and TNF was purchased from Genzyme (Boston, MA). Leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.

Anti-human CD3 antibodies were obtained from Ancell, Bayport, MN. Neutralizing antibodies to TNF were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). To isolate CD3+ T cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors were obtained from buffy coats by density gradient centrifugation (Ficoll-Paque, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were then depleted of monocytes by two cycles of plastic adherence, and CD3+ T cells were purified by neuraminidase-treated sheep red blood cell rosetting. The remaining cell population was repeatedly found to be 98% CD3+ T cells as determined by flow cytometry analysis. CD3+ T cells used in the various experiments were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 2 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics (penicillin 100 units/ml, streptomycin 100 μg/ml) at 0.5 × 106cells/ml. CD3+ T cells were stimulated and harvested on the 2nd day after isolation. Where indicated, cells were pretreated with 2 μmGF109203X and Gö 6976 for 15 min, 30 μm PD 098059 for 20 min. FK506 was used at 20 ng/ml. For Jurkat T cells, PMA was used at 20 ng/ml, ionomycin at 3.5 μg/ml, and TNF-α at 10 ng/ml.

The patients' tissues, which harbored 88% or more mutant mtDNA, had increased levels of mtDNA transcripts, increased nuclear OXPHOS gene transcripts including the ATP synthase β subunit and the heart-muscle isoform of the adenine nucleotide translocator, and increased ancillary gene transcripts including muscle mitochondrial creatine phosphokinase, muscle glycogen phosphorylase, hexokinase I, muscle phosphofructokinase, the E1α subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase, and the ubiquinone oxidoreductase. A similar coordinate induction of bioenergetic genes was observed in the muscle biopsies of severe pathologic mtDNA mutations. The more significant coordinated expression was found in muscle from patients with the MELAS, myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers, and chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia deletion syndromes, with ragged red muscle fibers and mitochondrial paracrystalline inclusions. High levels of mutant mtDNAs were linked to a high induction of the mtDNA and nuclear OXPHOS genes and of several associated bioenergetic genes. These observations suggest that human tissues attempt to compensate for OXPHOS defects associated with mtDNA mutations by stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis, possibly mediated through redox-sensitive transcription factors.

Mitochondrial DNA diseases can have a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, but they frequently have a delayed onset and a progressive course, with the severity of the mutation and the percentage of mutant mtDNAs in heteroplasmic individuals correlating with the time of onset (5Wallace D.C.

Mitochondrial DNA mutations that affect energy metabolism fall into two major classes, base substitution and insertion-deletion (rearrangement) mutations. Pathogenic base substitution mutations can alter the amino acid sequence of mtDNA-encoded proteins (missense mutations) or alter the structure and function of the tRNAs or rRNAs (protein synthesis mutations). Two well characterized missense mutations of the electron transport chain are the np 11778 G to A transition in the ND4 gene associated with the Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) (MTND4*LHON11778G) (9Wallace D.C.

Affected individuals harboring the MELAS and MERRF mutations frequently reveal a characteristic muscle histology that includes ragged red muscle fibers (RRFs) caused by the proliferation of abnormal mitochondria containing paracrystalline inclusions (PCI) (17Stadhouders A.M.

Rearrangement mutations can result in an array of symptoms. The mildest presentation is maternally transmitted diabetes mellitus and deafness (MDMD). This disease has been associated with the transmission of a trimolecular heteroplasmy including normal mtDNAs, mtDNAs with a 6.1-kb insertion and mtDNAs with the reciprocal 10.4-kb deletion (18Ballinger S.W. Shoffner J.M. Hedaya E.V. Trounce I. Polak M.A. Koontz D.A. Wallace D.C. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Deleted molecules were primarily responsible for the pathological phenotype in such patients (19Manfredi G. Vu T. Bonilla E. Schon E.A. DiMauro S. Arnaudo E. Zhang L. Rowland L.P. Hirano M. Ann. Neurol. 1997; 42: 180-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). More severe deletion syndromes due to deleted mtDNA include the spontaneously occurring chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) and the Kearn's-Sayre syndrome (KSS) (20Lestienne P. Ponsot G. Lancet. 1988; i: 885Abstract Scopus (256) Google Scholar). CPEO and KSS are associated with progressive muscle weakness including ophthalmoplegia and ptosis, RRFs, and abnormal mitochondria, as well as multisystem degeneration (21Holt I.J. Harding A.E.

Acta. 1994; 1226: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) revealed a coordinate increase on the mRNA levels of mtDNA and nuclear DNA (nDNA) encoded OXPHOS genes. A similar OXPHOS gene induction was observed in cardiac tissue from patients with ischemic heart disease associated with increased somatic mtDNA rearrangements (24Corral-Debrinski M. Stepien G. Shoffner J.M. Lott M.T. Kanter K. Wallace D.C. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1991; 266: 1812-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Several nuclear OXPHOS genes have been shown to be induced in these patients. The ATPsynβ gene, which is expressed in all tissues but is more prevalent in heart and muscle (25Neckelmann N. Warner C.K. Chung A. Kudoh J. Minoshima S. Fukuyama R. Maekawa M. Shimizu Y. Shimizu N. Liu J.D. Wallace D.C. Genomics. 1989; 5: 829-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); the ANT1 gene, which is expressed in heart and muscle but not in other tissues; and ANT2, which is generally not expressed unless the cells are switched to a glycolytic metabolism (26Stepien G.

Biol. 1998; 281: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The increase in nDNA and mtDNA OXPHOS transcript levels in skeletal muscle of patients with mitochondrial protein synthesis defects suggests that the affected tissues attempt to compensate for the energy deficiency by induction of mitochondrial biogenesis. This suggestion raises several questions. Is the OXPHOS gene induction specific for muscle tissue, or is it a common feature of tissues with respiratory defects? Is the induction restricted to OXPHOS genes or does it extend to other genes involved in energy metabolism? To address these questions, we performed two sets of experiments. First, we examined the mRNA levels of a variety of OXPHOS and glycolysis genes in the autopsy tissues of a young woman who died of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy secondary to the MTTL1*MELAS3243G mutation. Second, we analyzed the expression of the same set of genes in muscle biopsies of patients that harbored various mtDNA mutations including base substitutions and rearrangements. The MELAS proband patient died at 16 years old of cardiac failure, secondary to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A complete autopsy was performed, and all tissues were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Quadriceps muscle biopsies from patients harboring different pathologic mtDNA mutations were collected with informed consent as a component of routine diagnostic analysis (8Shoffner J.M. Wallace D.C. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 1535-1609Google Scholar). The mitochondria were isolated, and the OXPHOS enzymes were assayed as described previously (9Wallace D.C. Zheng X.X. Lott M.T. Shoffner J.M. Hodge J.A. Kelley R.I. Epstein C.M. Hopkins L.C.

The ubiquitin probe was generously provided by Dr. Russ Price (Emory University School of Medicine). Mitochondrial probes were generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification from 5 ng of HeLa DNA.

The KSS COII/cytb b fusion probe encompassed mtDNA np 7,392–7,669 and 15,437–15,549 and was amplified from 5 ng of a KSS patient mtDNA using primers 5′-GGATGCCCCCCACCCTACC and 5′-ATGTGGGGAGGGGTGTTTAA. This patient harbored a 7.7-kb mtDNA deletion localized between np 7,669 and 15,437 (36Nelson I. Bonne G. Degoul F. Marsac C. Ponsot G. Lestienne P. Neuropediatrics. 1992; 4: 199-205Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The resulting 0.386-kb probe was homologous to 51 bases of the 1.52-kb COI mRNA, 83 bases of the 0.708-kb COII mRNA, 112 bases of the 1.14-kb cytb mRNA, and the encompassed tRNASerand tRNAAsp. Total cellular RNA was isolated by pulverizing 50–200 mg of frozen tissues in liquid nitrogen (Omni 5000, Bioquip, Inc.), and homogenization in guanidium isothiocyanate. RNA samples (10–20 μg) were denatured by incubation at 55 °C for 20 min in 1 mdeionized glyoxal, 50% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, and 10 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.0, electrophoresed on 1.3% agarose gels (Ultrapure, Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, and blotted overnight onto nylon membranes (Hybond-N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20× SSC (standard sodium citrate). The blots were baked 2 h at 80 °C, prehybridized overnight at 50 °C (Hybaid oven) in 5× SSPE (standard sodium phosphate EDTA), 5× Denhardt's solution, 50% deionized formamide (Fisher, molecular biology grade), 0.2% SDS, and 0.1% denatured salmon sperm DNA, and hybridized overnight at 42 °C in the same buffer following the addition of 6 × 106cpm [32P]dCTP-labeled probe and 100 μg/ml sheared denatured salmon sperm DNA. Blots were washed three times (10 min) in 1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. Autoradiographs were obtained by exposing Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with intensifying screens at −80 °C for 2 h to 3 days. Autoradiographic exposure intensities were compared using an Ultrascan XL enhanced laser densitometer (two-dimensional gel scan program, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The amount of RNA blotted for each sample was normalized by hybridization of human 18 S ribosomal RNA probe (provided by the late Dr. R. D. Schmickel, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA) with an exposure time of 1 h at room temperature. Total cellular DNA was extracted from 50–100 mg of tissue pulverized in liquid nitrogen. Tissue powder was then homogenized in 2 ml of 1× STE (100 mm NaCl, 25 mmNa2 EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), the proteins were digested overnight at 55 °C in presence of 0.5% of SDS and 15 μg/ml of proteinase K (Boehringer), and the cellular RNAs were digested with 5 μg/ml of ribonuclease A (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C. Two phenol/chloroform extractions were performed, followed by DNA precipitation. 1–3 μg of DNA were digested with 40 units ofApa I, and the fragments were separated on a 0.8% agarose/TAE gel. The gel was treated 30 min with 0.25 nHCl, 30 min with 0.4 n NaOH and 1 m NaCl, neutralized 30 min in 1.5 m NaCl, 0.5 mTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and transferred to nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blot was prehybridized and hybridized as described above, first with the 18 S ribosomal RNA probe, exposed to Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 3 days, then hybridized with total human mtDNA, previously linearized with Bam HI, and exposed again. The band intensities were compared by densitometric analysis. A large two-generation pedigree harboring the MTTL1* MELAS3243G was identified in which every individual on the maternal lineage was affected. The mother exhibited short stature and normal lactic acidosis. She had eleven children, nine of them were available for study and exhibited lactic acidosis and growth retardation with reduced intelligence and stroke-like episodes being common findings. The most striking feature of the family was the frequent occurrence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, often in association with the Wolf-Parkinson-White cardiac conduction defect. The most common causes of death in the siblings were cardiac failure and status epilepticus in the late teens or twenties. OXPHOS enzymology of skeletal muscle mitochondria from MELAS individuals 1 to 3 (Table I) revealed statistically significant enzyme reductions in all three cases. The most prominent reductions were in respiratory complexes I and IV, a biochemical phenotype commonly observed in patients with mitochondrial protein synthesis defects (results not shown). Histochemical analysis revealed ragged red muscle fibers in all three skeletal muscle specimens examined. Screening for known mtDNA mutations in individuals MELAS 2 and 3 revealed that this family harbored the common MELAS tRNALeu(UUR) mutation at np 3242. Subsequently, individual MELAS 2 died of cardiac failure and a complete autopsy was performed. Specimens from all organ systems were analyzed for mtDNA genotype and for mRNA levels of a variety of OXPHOS and glycolytic genes. The proportion of mutant mtDNAs was analyzed in the tissues of MELAS 2 proband by comparing the relative intensities of 1.8-kb (mutant) and 3.0-kb (normal) bands in Apa I digests. The percentage of mutant mtDNAs was variable in the proband tissues, from 73% in kidney to 95% in heart and brain (TableII), and there was no increase in the proportion of total mtDNAs as compared with control tissues.Table IIMitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy and mitochondrial/nuclear DNA ratios in MELAS tissuesHeartSkeletal muscleKidneyLiverBrainPercentage of mutant mtDNA9591738895Patient mtDNA/nDNAControl mtDNA/nDNA7.56.8=1.108.012.0=0.672.32.3=1.02.23.3=0.675.25.5=0.94Southern blot containing 1–3 μg of total DNA digested withApa I was hybridized first with 18 S rRNA probe and then rinsed and hybridized with a Bam H1 linearized mtDNA probe.

The kidney control 2 mtDNA had a polymorphism lacking the Apa I restriction site. The ratio of mtDNA to nDNA was determined for each of the control tissues, and the MELAS proband tissues by quantitative densitometry of the 7.2-kb mtDNA fragment and the 0.8-kb 18 S rRNA nDNA fragment. Open table in a new tab Southern blot containing 1–3 μg of total DNA digested withApa I was hybridized first with 18 S rRNA probe and then rinsed and hybridized with a Bam H1 linearized mtDNA probe. In MELAS tissues (autopsy from the MELAS 2 patient), the normal mtDNA generated a 3.0-kb fragment, whereas the mutant mtDNAs were cleaved into two 1.8- and 1.2-kb fragments.

The ratio of mtDNA to nDNA was determined for each of the control tissues, and the MELAS proband tissues by quantitative densitometry of the 7.2-kb mtDNA fragment and the 0.8-kb 18 S rRNA nDNA fragment. Quantitation of the transcript levels from the mtDNA 12 S rRNA, ND5/6, COI, COII, cytb, and tRNASer+ tRNAAsp genes in controls and MELAS tissues revealed that the transcript levels were increased in all tissues but kidney. When normalized to 18 S rRNA, tissues with 88–95% mutant mtDNA showed increased expression of mtDNA genes, whereas the tissue with 73% mutant mtDNAs did not (Fig.1). Because the mtDNA/nDNA ratios were similar between patient and control tissues, the observed increase in transcript levels suggests increased transcription rates or transcript stability. The expression of the nuclear OXPHOS genes for ATPsynβ, ANT1, and ANT2 were also elevated in MELAS tissues relative to controls when the RNA levels were normalized to the cytosolic 18 S rRNA level (Fig.2). The ATPsynβ and ANT1 mRNA levels were increased in all of the MELAS tissues from 1.4- to 8.7-fold. The ANT2 mRNA levels were very low in all control tissues except in kidney but were dramatically increased in MELAS tissues from 6.4-fold in heart to 27-fold in skeletal muscle. The amount of transcript for key muscle glycolytic genes, mGP, HKI, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase (mPK), as well as for the E1α subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1αPDH) were examined in the MELAS tissues and controls. When normalized to the 18 S rRNA (Fig. 3), all of these gene transcripts except mPK were increased between 1.5- and 6-fold, with the greatest increases found in the heart. The E1αPDH gene was represented by two transcripts, 1.65 and 3.3 kb in size (not shown), as previously reported (37Dahl H.H. Hunt S.M. Hutchison W.M. Brown G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7398-7403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both transcripts were increased in the MELAS tissues, especially in heart where the 3.3-kb transcript was increased more than 25-fold. Four creatine kinase isoenzymes are known: brain cytosolic creatine kinase, ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase, mCCK, and mMtCK. The mRNA levels of the mMtCK gene, but not the mCCK gene, were substantially increased in MELAS heart and skeletal muscles (Fig. 4). The mMtCK was increased 2.2-fold in MELAS skeletal muscle and 1.9-fold in MELAS heart. By contrast, the expression of the mCCK was slightly or drastically (10-fold) decreased in the MELAS skeletal muscle and heart. The 76-amino acid ubiquitin (Ub) (38Rechsteiner M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) is a cofactor in the ATP-dependent, nonlysosomal, protein degradation pathway of abnormal proteins (39Finley D. Ozkaynak E. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1987; 48: 1035-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). In all the organisms examined, multiple Ub genes are present, and their size differences reflect variable numbers of randomly arranged Ub coding repeats. The translation products are polyubiquitins that are processed into the monomeric form. In human tissues, three sizes of mRNA have been reported: 650 (UbA), 1100 (UbB), and 2500 (UbC) nucleotides (40Wiborg O. Pedersen M.S. Wind A. Berglund L.E. Marcker K.A. Vuust J. EMBO J. 198"
https://openalex.org/W2006395732,"Relatedness within colonies of social Hymenoptera is often significantly lower than the outbred population maximum of 0.75. Several hypotheses address the widespread occurrence of low relatedness, but none have measured the covariation of colony fitness and relatedness. In a polyandrous harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex occidentalis, average within-colony relatedness in the population is low but highly variable among colonies, and relatedness is negatively correlated with colony growth rate. Differences in growth rate strongly influence survival and the onset of reproduction, leading to a 35-fold increase in fitness of fast-growing colonies. Benefits of a genetically diverse worker population may favor polyandry in this species."
https://openalex.org/W2045545926,"We examined regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 by phosphorylation in the rat myocardium. We utilized cell extracts from adult rat hearts, adult rat extracts fractionated by fast performance liquid chromatography, and extracts from cultured neonatal cardiac myocytes. The carboxyl-terminal 178 amino acids of the Na+/H+ exchanger were expressed inEscherichia coli fused with glutathioneS -transferase. The purified protein was used as a substrate for in vitro phosphorylation and in-gel kinase assays. Unfractionated extracts from neonatal myocytes or adult hearts phosphorylated the COOH-terminal domain of the antiporter. Western blot analysis revealed that mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (44 and 42 kDa) and p90rsk (90 kDa) were present in specific fractions of cardiac extracts that phosphorylated the COOH-terminal protein. In-gel kinase assays confirmed that protein kinases of approximately 44 and 90 kDa could phosphorylate this domain. MAP kinase and p90rsk-dependent phosphorylation of the antiporter could be demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of these kinases from extracts of neonatal cardiac myocytes. PD98059, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor, decreased MAP kinase and p90rsk phosphorylation of the antiporter and abolished serum and endothelin 1-stimulated increases in steady-state pHi. These results confirm the presence of MAP kinase-dependent phosphorylation in the regulation of the Na+/H+exchanger in the rat myocardium and suggest an important role for p90rsk phosphorylation in regulation of the protein by endothelin-mediated stimulation of the antiporter.

Dibrov P. Fliegel L. The Na+/H+ Exchanger. Springer/R.G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1996: 1-20Google Scholar) with a molecular mass of about 100 kDa (2Haworth R.S. Frohlich O. Fliegel L. Biochem.

It localizes to the plasma membrane, where it functions in the maintenance of cytosolic pH (pHi) and intracellular volume (3Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22373-22376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Six isoforms (NHE1–NHE6) exist, which vary in molecular weight and in sensitivity to the inhibitor amiloride (1Fliegel L. Dibrov P. Fliegel L. The Na+/H+ Exchanger. Springer/R.G.

The exchanger functions by extruding one proton in exchange for one sodium ion when pHi is too acidic (5Orlowski J. Shull G. Fliegel L. The Na+/H+ Exchanger. Springer/R.G.

An amino-terminal membrane domain mediates transport, and a cytosolic, hydrophilic carboxyl-terminal domain of approximately 300 amino acids in length (1Fliegel L. Dibrov P. Fliegel L.

The Na+/H+ exchanger is the protein responsible for removing most acid equivalents in the myocardium, particularly in cases of acute acid load (6Fliegel L. Wang H. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1997; 29: 1991-1999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It is suggested that Na+/H+ exchange is important in modulating the cardiac response to reperfusion after ischemia (7Karmazyn M. Fliegel L. The Na+/H+ Exchanger. Springer/R.G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1996: 189-216Google Scholar). The increases in intracellular sodium from the activity of the exchanger result in calcium overload by the Na+/Ca2+exchanger and subsequently lead to increased damage to the myocardium (7Karmazyn M. Fliegel L. The Na+/H+ Exchanger. Springer/R.G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1996: 189-216Google Scholar). These facts underlie the importance of understanding the regulatory mechanisms functioning to control Na+/H+ exchange. Studies have shown that phosphorylation of the Na+/H+ exchanger only occurs in the distal region of the cytosolic domain (8Wakabayashi S. Bertrand B. Shigekawa M. Fafournoux P. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5583-5588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of exchanger activity by phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain (last 178 amino acids) of the protein has been directly demonstrated using specific kinases present in rabbit skeletal muscle (9Wang H. Silva N.L.C.L. Lucchesi P.A. Haworth R. Wang K. Michalak M. Pelech S. Fliegel L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9151-9158Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and rat vascular smooth muscle cells (10Takahashi E. Abe J. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To date, however, no studies have examined regulation of Na+/H+ exchanger activity by kinases isolated from the myocardium. In this report, we identified two myocardial kinases important in the regulation of the COOH-terminal domain of NHE1 MAP kinase and p90rsk or Rsk (a substrate for MAP kinase phosphorylation). The results implicate a MAP kinase signaling pathway in the regulation of the COOH-terminal domain of the NHE1 isoform of the Na+/H+ exchanger and give the first direct evidence of myocardial kinases involved in this regulation.

Collagenase type 2 was obtained from Worthington, and BCECF-AM was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). The carboxyl-terminal 178-amino acid sequence of the rabbit cardiac Na+/H+ exchanger was expressed as described previously (9Wang H. Silva N.L.C.L. Lucchesi P.A. Haworth R. Wang K. Michalak M. Pelech S. Fliegel L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9151-9158Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) as a fusion protein with GST (PCRA or PCR178) using the plasmid pGEX-3X (9Wang H. Silva N.L.C.L. Lucchesi P.A. Haworth R. Wang K. Michalak M. Pelech S. Fliegel L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9151-9158Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli TOPP 2 strain was induced with 1 mmisopropylthio-β-d-galactoside. PCRA was purified via glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography as described earlier (9Wang H.

Extracts were prepared from ventricles of untreated adult Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats. The heart tissue was homogenized at a high setting with a Polytron homogenizer for 30 s in 2.5 (v/w) of extraction buffer containing 10 mm sodium phosphate, 60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 15 mm EGTA, 15 mm magnesium chloride, pH 7.5, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in methanol, 1 mm benzamidine hydrochloride in ethanol, and a protease inhibitor mixture (12Michalak M. Fliegel L. Wlasichuk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5869-5874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The homogenate was centrifuged at 6000 ×g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. Muscle extracts were fractionated on a Mono Q 10 column using FPLC as described previously (9Wang H. Silva N.L.C.L. Lucchesi P.A. Haworth R. Wang K. Michalak M. Pelech S. Fliegel L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9151-9158Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was done using commercially available antibodies against MAP kinase (ERK-1) and p90rsk. The standard reaction conditions for phosphorylation of heart extract fractions contained 3.0–8.0 μg of PCRA, 8 μl of heart extract, 12.5 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 8.5 mm magnesium chloride, 6 μm okadaic acid, 0.24 mm sodium fluoride, 500 μm ATP, and 1 μl of 10 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) in a final volume of 24 μl (modified according to Ref. 9Wang H.

Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 90 min, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS loading buffer. Samples were run on a 12% SDS gel, dried, and exposed for autoradiography. The stoichiometry of phosphorylation was determined by two methods using samples separated by SDS-PAGE. The appropriate bands were identified by autoradiography and excised, and incorporation was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The same results were obtained by quantification using a model BAS1000 phosphor imager (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.) to examine radioactivity incorporated into the protein bands. To identify specific kinases that phosphorylated PCRA, heart fractions of interest were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE in a gel containing 1 mg/ml of PCRA. In-gel kinase assays were as described earlier (9Wang H. Silva N.L.C.L. Lucchesi P.A. Haworth R. Wang K. Michalak M. Pelech S. Fliegel L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9151-9158Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The gel was dried for autoradiography and visualization of phosphorylation (13Lucchesi P.A. Bell J.M. Willis L.S.

Primary myocyte cultures were prepared from neonatal Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (14Dyck J.R.B. Maddaford T.G. Pierce G.N. Fliegel L. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 29: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Isolated primary myocytes were plated onto glass coverslips for physiologic studies or onto PrimariaTM (Falcon) culture dishes or flasks. Myocytes were maintained for 4–5 days in medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 μg/ml transferrin, 10 μg/ml insulin, 10 ng/ml selenium, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 μg/ml linoleic acid, 3 mm pyruvic acid, 0.1 mm minimum essential medium nonessential amino acids, 10% minimum essential medium vitamin, 0.1 mm bromodeoxyuridine, 100 μm l-ascorbic acid, and 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.1. Cells were serum-starved overnight prior to experiments when myocytes were stimulated with serum or ET-1. Myocytes were grown on glass coverslips, and the acetoxy methyl ester of 2′-7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein was used to measure pHi as described earlier (9Wang H. Silva N.L.C.L.

Excitation wavelengths were at 452 and 503 nm with emission at 524 nm. Myocytes were serum-starved before pHi measurement, and the normal buffer used for pH measurements contained 137 mmsodium chloride, 1.6 mm magnesium sulfate, 5.4 mm potassium chloride, 1.2 mm sodium dihydrogen orthophosphate, 20 mm HEPES, 15 mm d-glucose, and 1.0 mm calcium chloride, pH 7.1. Steady-state pHi was measured following a brief acid challenge using ammonium chloride prepulse (20 mm for 2–3 min) followed by ammonium chloride-free buffer pH 7.1 (14Dyck J.R.B. Maddaford T.G. Pierce G.N. Fliegel L. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 29: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). After recovery of a stable resting pHi, either serum (10%) or ET-1 (0.5 nm) was added, and changes in resting pHi were measured for 10 min. In some experiments, the cells were either pretreated with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (50 μm) or Me2SO vehicle for 2 min followed by the above stimulation with either serum or ET-1. To examine phosphorylation of NHE1 in vivo , neonatal cardiac myocytes were incubated in a phosphate-free buffer containing 130 mm sodium chloride, 5 mmpotassium chloride, 1.8 mm calcium chloride, 1.0 mm magnesium sulfate, 5.0 mm d-glucose, 20.0 mm HEPES, 2.0 mmglutamine, and 1.0 g/liter bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 37 °C (16Moe O.W. Amemiya M. Yamaji Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2187-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 17Siczkowski M. Davies J.E. Ng L.L. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Myocytes were then incubated with [32P]orthophosphate (100 μCi/ml) for 3 h in phosphate-free buffer at 37 °C. Five minutes before the incubation was terminated, myocytes were stimulated with FBS (10%) for 5 min. Unstimulated myocytes were used as controls. In some experiments, myocytes were treated with PD98059 prior to immunoprecipitation as described below. Cells were then washed with cold phosphate-free buffer, and this was replaced with a cold buffer (RIPA) containing 150 mm sodium chloride, 80 mm sodium fluoride, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (17Siczkowski M. Davies J.E. Ng L.L. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and placed on dry ice for 5–10 min. Myocytes were thawed on ice, scraped into centrifuge tubes, sonicated for 10 s, and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm at 4 °C for 1 h. The supernatant was removed, and RIPA buffer containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40), 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS was added. The solution was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitations were with affinity-purified NHE1 antibodies against the Na+/H+ exchanger (2Haworth R.S. Frohlich O. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To reduce nonspecific binding to Sepharose, radiolabeled myocyte extracts (1 ml) were treated with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads for 30 min. These samples were centrifuged for 1–2 min at 7000 rpm at 4 °C, and the supernatant was retained. Sepharose beads used for immunoprecipitation were also pretreated to reduce nonspecific binding. Unlabeled myocyte extract was combined with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads for 2 h at 4 °C, and the beads were washed with RIPA. For immunoprecipitations, 30 μl of anti-NHE1 antibody (2Haworth R.S. Frohlich O. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) was added to the pretreated supernatant, and this was agitated for 2 h at 4 °C. The antibody-antigen complex was then added to pretreated beads and agitated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed extensively with RIPA buffer and then solubilized in SDS-PAGE gel sample buffer. The immunoprecipitate was boiled and run on a SDS-PAGE. Finally, the gel was dried for autoradiographic analysis. In some experiments, immunoprecipitates were transferred to Nitrocellulose and probed with antibody against the antiporter to confirm their identity. Immunoprecipitations were repeated three times in experiments comparing FBS-stimulated and -unstimulated cells, and they were repeated two times in experiments comparing PD98059-treated and -untreated cells. In the experiments with PD98059, the amount of immunoprecipitate was quantified by Western blotting and densitometric analysis to ensure equivalent amounts of protein were compared. To characterizein vivo stimulated kinases, myocytes were serum-starved overnight. To mimic conditions of the experiments measuring pHi, myocytes were subjected to a brief ammonium chloride prepulse as described above. Myocytes were then exposed to either 10% FBS or 0.5 nm ET-1 for 0–5 min at 37 °C. Unstimulated myocytes were used as controls. In some experiments, the cells were either pretreated with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (50 μm) or Me2SO vehicle for 30 min followed by stimulation with either serum or ET-1. The myocytes were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and an extraction buffer containing 50 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 50 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.01% Triton X-100, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. The cells were frozen on dry ice for 5 min, allowed to thaw on ice for 15 min, scraped, and transferred into microcentrifuge tubes. The myocyte extracts were sonicated for 10 s on ice and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Extracts were analyzed by Western blot analysis using antibodies against MAP kinase (ERK-1), phosphorylated MAP kinase (p-ERK), cardiac myosin heavy chain (MF-20), and p90rsk and for their ability to phosphorylate PCRA fusion protein using the assays described earlier. For in-gel kinase assays of stimulated and unstimulated neonatal cardiac myocytes, cell lysates were made as described above. Equal amounts of protein were then used for the in-gel kinase assays. We confirmed that equal amounts of protein were applied to the gels by Coomassie Blue staining of identically run gels or by Western blot analysis of identically run samples with an antibody against either MAP kinase or p90rsk. Protein concentrations were measured using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. For immunoprecipitation, anti-ERK-1 and anti-Rsk-1 antibodies were used. Myocyte lysates (500 μl) were pretreated by incubating with protein A-Sepharose Cl-4B beads (in experiments with anti-ERK-1 antibodies) or protein G-Sepharose beads (in experiments with anti-Rsk-1) for 30 min. The samples were centrifuged for 1–2 min at 7000 rpm at 4 °C to remove nonspecifically adsorbed proteins bound to the resins. In addition, Sepharose beads used for immunoprecipitation were pretreated to reduce nonspecific binding. They were incubated with unlabeled myocyte extract for 2 h at 4 °C and washed with extraction buffer. For immunoprecipitation of protein kinases, 10 μl of 200 μg/ml stock anti-ERK-1 antibody or 10 μl of 200 μg/ml stock anti-Rsk-1 antibody was added to pretreated myocyte lysate, and this mixture was rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. The antibody-antigen complex was then added to pretreated beads and rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed extensively in extraction buffer and then solubilized in SDS-PAGE gel sample buffer. The immunoprecipitate was analyzed by in-gel kinase assay. Analysis of results was by a Mann-WhitneyU test and/or Student's unpaired t test on direct numerical values obtained (18Hassard T.H. Hassard T.H. Understanding Biostatistics. Mosby Year Book, Inc., St. Louis, MO1991: 263-280Google Scholar). Values presented are mean ± S.E. of the controls with the number of experiments indicated;p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. We produced the carboxyl-terminal 178 amino acids as a fusion protein with GST (46.9 kDa). The identity of the purified protein was confirmed using an antibody generated against the carboxyl-terminal region of the Na+/H+ exchanger (11Besson P. Fernandez-Rachubinski F. Yang W. Fliegel L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C831-C839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (not shown). We used this protein to examine regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger by phosphorylation in the mammalian myocardium. Initially, we isolated a cell extract from the adult rat myocardium, and this extract was fractionated on a Mono Q column. Both unfractionated and fractionated extract were tested for their ability to phosphorylate PCRA-GST. Fig.1 shows that unfractionated extract does not phosphorylate purified GST protein (lane 1 ) but does phosphorylate purified PCRA-GST fusion protein that contains the terminal 178 amino acids of the Na+/H+exchanger (46–47 kDa) (lane 2 ). The stoichiometry of phosphorylation was 1–2 mol of Pi/mol of PCRA-GST. A time course of phosphorylation showed that the fusion protein was fully phosphorylated (not shown). To examine which kinases might be involved in the phosphorylation of the fusion protein, we analyzed the extracts by Western blot analysis using commercially available antibodies against MAP kinase (ERK-1) (Fig. 2 A ). Unfractionated extract (CY ) contained both MAP kinase (44 and 42 kDa) isoforms as well as a small amount of the kinase p90rsk (90 kDa) when probed with an antibody to p90rsk (not shown). Fractions 10–12 were enriched in MAP kinase relative to other fractions, and these same fractions contained small amounts of p90rsk protein (not shown). To identify potential protein kinases involved in regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger, we used in-gel kinase assays. In-gel kinase assays with GST alone as a substrate showed no discrete phosphorylation patterns and no evidence that kinases were phosphorylating GST to any significant extent (not shown). However, assays with GST-PCRA as a substrate showed that a number of kinases of discreet molecular sizes could phosphorylate this fusion protein (Fig.2 B ). In unfractionated samples (CY ) the major kinase activity was of approximately 44 kDa. In addition, there was a minor band of approximately 38 kDa. Fractions 9–12 contained bands of kinase activity corresponding to molecular masses of approximately 44, 90, 60, and 38 kDa (Fig. 2 B ). A weak band was also noticed of approximately 75 kDa. The finding of kinases of about 44 and 90 kDa was consistent with the size and activity of MAP kinase and p90rsk. We did not find evidence for significant activity of protein kinases larger than 90 kDa. We next characterized steady state physiological pHi regulation by the Na+/H+ exchanger in isolated neonatal myocytes stimulated with either ET-1 or FBS. Steady state monitoring of pHi allowed us to observe a continuous time course of events. Myocytes were serum-starved overnight. Fig.3 A shows typical effects of the addition of ET-1 or FBS on steady-state pHi of neonatal cardiac myocytes, and Fig. 3 B summarizes the results. Both ET-1 and FBS addition raised the steady-state pHi to more alkaline values compared with unstimulated cardiac myocytes (control). The MEK inhibitor PD98059 abolished the effects of ET-1 and FBS addition, showing that the above effects were due to activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger via the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. A summary of a series of experiments is shown in Fig. 3 B . We then examined in vivo phosphorylation of NHE1 in neonatal cardiac myocytes. Affinity-purified anti-Na+/H+exchanger antibody was used to immunoprecipitate the exchanger from equal amounts of isolated myocytes. Fig.4 B shows typical results and illustrates that FBS stimulation increased the in vivo phosphorylation state of the NHE1 compared with unstimulated myocytes. Scanning densitometry estimated a 2–3-fold increase in the phosphorylation level in stimulated cells. Fig. 4 A shows a typical Western blot of the immunoprecipitate probed with anti-NHE1 antibody. The result confirms that we were immunoprecipitating Na+/H+ exchanger protein. Fig. 4 C shows that PD98059 dramatically reduced the phosphorylation of the antiporter that was induced by serum. Scanning densitometry estimated that there was approximately a 5-fold decrease in the level of phosphorylation. To examine mechanisms behind the physiological effects, we obtained cell extracts from neonatal cardiac myocytes that were unstimulated (control) (Fig. 5 A ,lane 1 ), ET-1-stimulated (lane 2 ), and FBS-stimulated (lane 3 ). All of the extracts had the ability to phosphorylate PCRA-GST (46–47 kDa) in in vitro phosphorylation assays. However, extracts from ET-1 and FBS-stimulated cardiac myocytes showed a 2-fold increase in phosphorylation of PCRA-GST (p < 0.05) compared with controls (Fig. 5 B ). To confirm that myocyte extracts contained equal amounts of protein and kinases, SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis routinely analyzed cell lysates. Antibodies against MAP kinase (ERK-1) and p90rskshowed that all of the extracts contained equal amounts of these two kinases (Fig. 6 A ) (lane 1 , control extract; lane 2 , extract from ET-1-stimulated myocytes; lane 3 , extract from FBS-stimulated myocytes). Equal amounts of protein were obtained from the different cells (0.8–1.0 μg/μl). To confirm that the 44- and 90-kDa bands were MAP kinase and p90rsk, respectively, we used immunoprecipitation with anti-MAP kinase (44 kDa) and anti-p90rsk (90 kDa) antibodies. The proteins were removed from neonatal cardiac cell extracts with antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The immunoprecipitates were tested for their ability to phosphorylate the carboxyl terminus of the Na+/H+ exchanger in an in-gel kinase assays (Fig. 6 B ). Lanes 1 and 3 show phosphorylation by the 42- and 44-kDa isoforms of MAP kinase and by p90rsk (Fig.6 B ). Anti-MAP kinase antibody immunoprecipitated a band corresponding in size to the major 44-kDa kinase we found in cell extracts and was equivalent in size to that of MAP kinase (Fig.6 B , lane 2 ). Anti-p90rskantibody immunoprecipitated a band that corresponded in size to p90rsk kinase and to the 90-kDa band we observed in whole cell and tissue extracts (Fig. 6 B , lane 4 ). A control experiment in which no primary antibody was added did not show either a 42–44-kDa band or a 90-kDa band (not shown). Fig.6 C confirms that we immunoprecipitated the appropriate protein kinases. Lane 1 shows MAP kinase of a control cell extract, while lane 2 shows an extract in which much of the MAP kinase was removed by immunoprecipitation. Lane 3 shows immunoprecipitate of MAP kinase protein. The heavy and light chains of the IgG were also evident, but in control experiments they did not account for the MAP kinase band (not shown). Lane 4 shows p90rsk of a control cell extract, andlane 5 shows the extract after immunodepletion with anti-p90rsk antibody. Lane 6 shows that the immunoprecipitate contains p90rsk. We performed time course experiments on the phosphorylation levels of MAP kinase (Fig. 7 A ) and p90rsk (Fig. 8, A andB ) and then used in-gel kinase assays to examine if MAP kinase (Fig. 7 B ) and p90rsk (Fig.9, A and B ) respond to the same physiological stimuli that affected pHi regulation. Fig. 7 A shows phosphorylation levels of MAP kinase in total cell extracts detected with antibodies to the phosphorylated form of MAP kinase (p-ERK). Control cells were unstimulated, while other cells were FBS-stimulated for 30 s to 5 min. The same extracts were probed with anti-MF-20 (antibody to cardiac myosin heavy chain) to show equal amounts of protein loaded in each lane. Clearly, MAP kinase is highly phosphorylated within 30 s of stimulation, and this increases for up to 1 min in time. This is followed by a decrease in the level of phosphorylation of MAP kinase. Fig. 7 B shows an in-gel kinase assay showing phosphorylation of PCRA by control myocardial cell extracts (C ) and cell extracts from 1-min, FBS-stimulated myocytes (S ) with and without the MEK inhibitor PD98059. The level of phosphorylation of PCRA-GST by MAP kinase from FBS-stimulated myocyte extracts was much greater than unstimulated (control) myocyte extracts (lane 1 versus lane 3 ). PD98059 reduced the levels of MAP kinase phosphorylation of PCRA from both control myocyte extracts and FBS-stimulated myocyte extracts (lanes 2 and 4 ).Figure"

The enzyme is secreted under apoptotic conditions in culture where it is cleaved into an N-terminal fragment that harbors the catalytic site and into a C-domain fragment found only in the mammalian enzymes. The N-terminal fragment is an interleukin-8 (IL-8)-like cytokine, whereas the released C-domain is an endothelial-monocyte-activating polypeptide II (EMAP II)-like cytokine. Although the IL-8-like activity of the N-fragment depends on an ELR motif found in α-chemokines and conserved among mammalian TyrRSs, here we show that a similar (NYR) motif in the context of a lower eukaryote TyrRS does not confer the IL8-like activity. We also show that a heptapeptide from the C-domain has EMAP II-like chemotaxis activity for mononuclear phagocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Eukaryote proteins other than human TyrRS that have EMAP II-like domains have variants of the heptapeptide motif. Peptides based on these sequences are inactive as cytokines.

It is almost the same molecular size as TyrRS from prokaryotes or lower eukaryotes (see Fig. 1 A ). This N-fragment of human TyrRS has the catalytic domain capable of aminoacylation of human tyrosine tRNA (5Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the N-fragment (human mini TyrRS) binds strongly to the interleukin-8 (IL-8) type A receptor and, like IL-8, functions as a chemoattractant for polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) (5Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The C-terminal fragment of human TyrRS has high sequence similarity to the mature form of a proinflammatory cytokine known as human endothelial-monocyte-activating polypeptide II (EMAP II) (6Kleeman T.A. Wei D. Simpson K.L. First E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14420-14425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The isolated C-domain of human TyrRS has potent chemotaxis activity for PMNs and mononuclear phagocytes (MPs), and stimulates production of myeloperoxidase, tumor necrosis factor-α, and tissue factor. These are the same activities found for mature EMAP II (5Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 7Kao J. Ryan J. Brett J. Chen J. Shen H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 25106-25119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aware that other proteins had some of the same sequences found in EMAP II and in human TyrRS, we wondered whether these proteins had any of the same cytokine activities. Alternatively, the sequences important for the cytokine activities of human TyrRS could have a different function in other proteins. In that case, the cytokine activities of human TyrRS might be viewed as highly differentiated adaptations of domains or motifs that are basic platforms for more than one kind of biological activity. For example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae TyrRS has an Asn-Tyr-Arg (NYR) motif similar to the Glu-Leu-Arg (ELR) sequence of human TyrRS and of α-chemokines like IL-8. The ELR motif is essential for the leukocyte chemoattractant activity of these proteins (5Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 9Hébert C.A.

A. 1993; 90: 3574-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and yet there is no obvious biological rationale why a yeast protein like S. cerevisiae TyrRS would have chemokine activity. Similarly, portions of S. cerevisiae Arc1p, bacterial, and Caenorhabditis elegans methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS), and the β-subunit of prokaryotic phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS) have high sequence similarity to parts of mature EMAP II (11Simos G.

Here again, there is no obvious rationale for EMAP II-like activity in the organisms that host these proteins. With these considerations in mind, we tested the functional significance of the IL-8- or EMAP II-like motifs in these proteins with respect to their potential chemokine activities. The results obtained strengthened the concept that, despite similarities of the motifs in human TyrRS with those in other proteins, the cytokine activities themselves are highly specific to human TyrRS. Custom syntheses of peptides, their high performance liquid chromatography purification, and their mass spectroscopic analyses were performed by Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. (Woodlands, TX). Human mini TyrRS, S. cerevisiae TyrRS, and Escherichia coli TyrRS (with a C-terminal tag of six histidine residues) were overexpressed inE. coli strain BL 21 (DE 3) (Novagen, Madison, WI) by induction with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h. Using the procedures described by Novagen, the proteins were purified on a nickel affinity column (His·BindTM resin; Novagen) from the supernatant of lysed cells. Endotoxin was removed from the protein solutions by phase separation using Triton X-114 (14Aida Y. Pabst M.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 132: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar,15Liu S. Tobias R. Mcclure S. Styba G. Shi Q. Jackowski G. Clin. Biochem. 1997; 30: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) and was determined to be < 0.01 endotoxin units/ml by aLimulus Amebocyte lysate gel-clot assay (E-ToxateTM; Sigma). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Human PMNs and MPs were prepared from acid citrate dextrose-treated blood of normal healthy volunteers (7Kao J. Ryan J. Brett J. Chen J. Shen H. Fan Y.-G. Godman G. Familletti P. Wang F. Pan Y.-C. Stern D. Clauss M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20239-20247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human PMNs were isolated from the blood by centrifugation (700 × g ) over Histopaque 1077 and 1119 (Sigma). Fractions containing PMNs was exposed to NaCl (0.2%) for 30 s to lyse erythrocytes, restored to isotonicity immediately by adding NaCl (1.6%), and centrifuged for 10 min. The latter procedure was repeated twice. Human MPs were isolated by centrifugation on Histopaque 1077 (Sigma). The mononuclear fraction was obtained, washed twice in Hanks' balanced salt solution, resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) containing heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (10%, Sigma), plated on tissue culture flasks, and incubated in a 6% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 1–2 h (16Kumagai K. Itoh K. Hinuma S. Tada M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1979; 29: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Nonadherent cells were removed by washing the flasks three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and adherent cells were harvested by incubation with calcium-magnesium free phosphate-buffered saline containing EDTA (2 mm) for 15 min at 4 °C, followed by extensive washing. Cell migration of PMNs or MPs was performed in a microchemotaxis chamber ChemoTXTM (Neuro Probe, Gaithersburg, MD) containing polycarbonate filters (5-μm pores) without or with polyvinylpyrrolidone, respectively (5Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 17Falk W. Goodwin Jr., R.H. Leonard E.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 33: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). PMNs or MPs were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (1%), and 104 cells were added/well to the upper chamber. The chemotactic stimulus was placed in the lower chamber, and cells were allowed to migrate for 45 min (for PMNs) or 3 h (for MPs) at 37 °C in a 6% CO2 incubator. After incubation, nonmigrating cells were removed, membranes were fixed in methanol, and migrating cells were visualized with the HemacolorTM stain set (EM Diagnostic Systems, Gibbstown, NJ). Migrating cells were counted in high power fields (HPFs). Custom radioiodination of human mini TyrRS with 125I was performed by Research & Diagnostic Antibody, Inc. (Richmond, CA). PMNs (2 × 106 cells) in 120 μl of RPMI 1640 medium containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin were incubated on ice for 2 h with 10 nm125I-labeled human mini TyrRS (specific activity of ∼60 Ci/mmol) in the absence or presence of a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled TyrRSs. Cells were separated from unbound radioactivity by centrifugation at approximately 8000 × g for 2 min through 500 μl of a 10% sucrose/phosphate-buffered saline cushion. The supernatant was aspirated, and the cell sediment was resuspended by using EcoLite (ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Gel filtration was accomplished on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Gel filtration standard (Bio-Rad) that included thyroglobulin, bovine gamma globulin, chicken ovalbumin, equine myoglobin, and vitamin B-12 was used. Our previous results showed that the ELR motif of human mini TyrRS plays an important role in PMN receptor binding, as it does in α-chemokines (5Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A , the critical ELR motif of α-chemokines like IL-8 is conserved among mammalian TyrRSs. The corresponding sequence element of S. cerevisiae or E. coli TyrRS is NYR or ETV, respectively. Previously we showed that E. coli TyrRS neither activated nor bound to the IL-8 receptors on PMNs (5Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). A non-human eukaryotic TyrRS was not tested. To delineate further the interaction of TyrRSs with PMNs, human mini TyrRS was radioiodinated to have a tracer for binding studies. Binding of human mini TyrRS for PMNs is strictly competitive with IL-8 (5Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Binding occurs to the IL-8 type A receptor with a dissociation constantK d of 8 nm (5Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Incubation of125I-mini TyrRS with PMNs led to dose-dependent specific binding at 4 °C (5Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). We confirmed by competitive binding studies that binding of 125I-mini TyrRS was inhibited by the presence of excess amounts of unlabeled mini TyrRS but not by excess amounts of E. coli TyrRS (Fig. 1 B ).S. cerevisiae TyrRS inhibited binding of125I-mini TyrRS to PMNs (Fig. 1 B ). We estimate that the dissociation constant for S. cerevisiae TyrRS is not more than 200-fold higher than that for human mini TyrRS. These results showed that a lower eukaryotic but not a bacterial TyrRS can bind to the PMN receptor for human mini TyrRS. To determine whether binding of S. cerevisiae TyrRS to PMNs was associated with cytokine activity, we also investigated the chemotaxis activities of human mini, S. cerevisiae , orE. coli TyrRS. As shown in Fig. 1 C , incubation of PMNs with human mini TyrRS (1 nm) led to induction of PMN migration. In contrast, no chemotaxis was observed with either S. cerevisiae TyrRS or E. coli TyrRS (each at a concentration of 1 nm) (Fig. 1 C ). In addition to checking of the potential cytokine activity of S. cerevisiae TyrRS at a concentration of 1 nm, concentrations of 0.1, 10, 100, and 1000 nm were also tested. No significant chemotaxis was observed (data not shown). Thus, the binding of S. cerevisiae TyrRS to PMNs is not associated with a serendipitous cytokine function. Prokaryotic and lower eukaryotic TyrRSs form stable dimers (18Calendar R. Berg P. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 19Faulhammer H.G. Cramer F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 75: 561-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 20Quinn C.L. Tao N. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12489-12495Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We considered the possibility that the cytokine activities of human mini TyrRS were because of it having a different oligomeric state from the prokaryotic or lower eukaryotic homologs. For example, the region of the ELR motif might be in a distinct conformation in a monomeric versus a dimeric form of the protein. To investigate the oligomeric state of mini TyrRS, we determined the molecular weight of mini TyrRS by gel filtration chromatography on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column. As controls, we performed gel filtration of E. coli and S. cerevisiae TyrRSs. Human mini TyrRS eluted at the same position as the E. coli or S. cerevisiae TyrRS, with an estimated molecular weight of 90 kDa (data not shown). This value corresponds closely to that expected for the dimeric form (84 kDa). A synthetic peptide comprising seven residues near the N terminus of human mature EMAP II (RIGRIIT) was shown previously to induce migration of PMNs and MPs (21Kao J. Fan Y.-G. Haehnel I. Brett J. Greenberg S. Clauss M. Kayton M. Houck K. Kisiel W. Seljelid R. Burnier J. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9774-9782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the cytokine activity of the C-domain of human TyrRS, we used a sequence alignment to design the corresponding peptide (RVGKIIT) of the C-domain (Fig.2 A ). This C-domain peptide from TyrRS induced the same PMN and MP migration as did the mature EMAP II peptide (Fig. 2 B ). The effect of the C-domain peptide from TyrRS on PMN and MP migration showed a dose-dependence similar to that of the mature EMAP II peptide (data not shown). Thus, the C-domain of TyrRS and mature EMAP II share similar peptide motifs for chemotaxis at the same positions in their respective sequences. Portions of S. cerevisiae Arc1p and C. elegans MetRS have high sequence homology with the C-domain of human TyrRS (6Kleeman T.A. Wei D. Simpson K.L. First E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14420-14425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar,11Simos G. Segref A. Fasiolo F. Hellmuth K. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5437-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 13Simos G. Sauer A. Fasiolo F. Hurt E.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we prepared the RVGKIIT-like peptide of S. cerevisiae Arc1p (RVGFIQK) and of C. elegans MetRS (RVGRIIK). Neither peptide induced PMN or MP migration (Fig.2 B ). Thus, highly specific peptide sequences are required for the cytokine activities of human mature EMAP II and the C-domain of human TyrRS. Because many residues and motifs are conserved among eukaryotic TyrRSs that are not found in their prokaryotic counterparts (22Ribas de Pouplana L. Frugier M. Quinn C.L. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Brown J.R. Robb F.T. Weiss R. Doolittle W.F. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 45: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the binding of S. cerevisiae TyrRS to PMNs could reflect its structural similarity to human mini TyrRS. One reason why S. cerevisiae TyrRS does not have IL8-like cytokine activity might be attributed to the variation (NYR) of the sequence of critical ELR motif. We showed previously that a simple ELR → ELQ change inactivated the IL8-like activity of human mini TyrRS (5Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). In this connection, it is also noteworthy that prokaryotic and eukaryote cytoplasmic TyrRSs cannot cross-aminoacylate their respective tyrosine tRNAs because of a sequence variation in a peptide motif that is needed for discrimination of a species-specific difference in their respective tRNA sequences (20Quinn C.L. Tao N. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12489-12495Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 24Chow C.M. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12855-12863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wakasugi K. Quinn C.L. Tao N. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, both cytokine and RNA-related activities of human TyrRS are sensitive to the most subtle sequence variations. Human mini TyrRS differs in primary structure from more typical α-chemokines. For example, while mini TyrRS contains an ELR motif that is critical for receptor binding, this motif is at the middle of the Rossmann fold that forms the site for synthesis of tyrosyl-adenylate. In contrast, the ELR motif of α-chemokines is located near the N terminus. Also, whereas α-chemokines have conserved cysteines and a Cys-Xaa-Cys motif (where Xaa is any residue), mini TyrRS does not share the conserved residues. Despite these differences in primary structures, human mini TyrRS is predicted (based on the crystal structure of Bacillus stearothermophilus TyrRS (26Brick P. Bhat T.N. Blow D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 83-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar)) to form the same six-stranded β-sheet as the α-chemokines (Fig. 3). Moreover, the predicted location of the ELR motif of human mini TyrRS is close to that of the α-chemokines (Fig. 3). Under the experimental conditions of NMR or x-ray analyses, native IL-8 is a dimer (27Baldwin E.T. Weber I.T. St. Charles R. Xuan J.-C. Appella E. Yamada M. Matsushima K. Edwards B.F.P. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Wlodawer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 28Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, at physiologically more relevant concentrations, monomeric and dimeric forms of IL-8 are in equilibrium, with the monomer being the prevalent form (29Burrows S.D. Doyle M.L. Murphy K.P. Franklin S.G. White J.R. Brooks I. McNulty D.E. Scott M.O. Knutson J.R. Porter D. Young P.R. Hensley P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12741-12745Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 30Paolini J.F. Willard D. Consler T. Luther M. Krangel K.S. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2704-2717PubMed Google Scholar). Dimerization-deficient IL-8 analogues were engineered by chemical modification or by mutations of residues at the dimer interface (31Rajarathnam K. Sykes B.D. Kay C.M. Dewald B. Geiser T. Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I. Science. 1994; 264: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 32Lowman H.B. Fairbrother W.J. Slagle P.H. Kabakoff R. Liu J. Shire S. Hébert C.A.

Their structural analyses clarified that the IL-8 monomers have the same tertiary folding as the dimer (32Lowman H.B. Fairbrother W.J. Slagle P.H. Kabakoff R. Liu J. Shire S. Hébert C.A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 598-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 34Rajarathnam K. Clark-Lewis I. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12983-12990Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition, their functional analyses showed that the monomers have full cytokine activity in vitro and in vivo (31Rajarathnam K. Sykes B.D. Kay C.M. Dewald B. Geiser T. Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I. Science. 1994; 264: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 32Lowman H.B. Fairbrother W.J. Slagle P.H. Kabakoff R. Liu J. Shire S. Hébert C.A.

On the other hand, to mimic the dimeric form of IL-8, cross-linked single-chain dimers were designed (35Leong S.R. Lowman H.B. Liu J. Shire S. Deforge L.E. Gillece-Castro B.L. McDowell R. Hébert C.A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The results of chemotaxis and receptor binding assays showed that the dissociation of the dimer is not required for the biological activities (35Leong S.R. Lowman H.B. Liu J. Shire S. Deforge L.E. Gillece-Castro B.L. McDowell R. Hébert C.A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, dimerization of IL-8 introduces no structural constraints for its tertiary folding or activities. Similarly, the ELR motif needed for the IL8-like activity is accessible in the dimeric structure found here for human mini TyrRS. A long N-terminal segment precedes the ELR region of mini TyrRS (5Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The same extension occurs in the yeast and bacterial proteins studied here so that the presence or absence of this extension cannot explain the unique cytokine activity of human mini TyrRS. Many of the ELR-containing chemokines have an N-terminal extension that is cleaved away to activate the chemokine (36Walz A. Baggiolini M. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 37Brandt E. Van Damme J. Flad H.-D. Cytokine. 1991; 3: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These N-terminal extensions may block access to the ELR motif, and it is for that reason that activation occurs upon removal of the extensions. However, as explained above, the N-terminal region of the structural model of mini TyrRS does not physically block the ELR motif so that this region should be accessible for cytokine activation. Consistent with this conclusion, Hölzer et al. prepared a fusion protein in which the N terminus of IL-8 was fused to a Fab fragment (38Hölzer W. Petersen F. Strittmatter W. Matzku S. von Hoegen I. Cytokine. 1996; 8: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This chimeric protein showed specific binding to the IL-8 receptor, induced IL-8-mediated chemotactic activity, and stimulated release of myeloperoxidase. Some amino acid residues in peptides corresponding to the RVGKIIT motif from the C-domain of human TyrRS are highly conserved among other proteins of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (TableI). However, in this work we showed that the heptapeptides derived from S. cerevisiae Arc1p orC. elegans MetRS did not have EMAP II-like cytokine activities. Thus, the EMAP II-like motif in these proteins may originally have been associated with another biological function. Because human EMAP II and S. cerevisiae Arc1p are known to bind to tRNA (11Simos G. Segref A. Fasiolo F. Hellmuth K. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5437-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 12Quevillon S. Agou F. Robinson J.-C. Mirande M. J. Biol.

The structure-specific tRNA binding activity of the EMAP II-like Trbp111 from Aquifex aeolicus is consistent with this possibility (39Morales A.J. Swairjo M. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3475-3483Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A. aeolicus is considered in some analyses to be in a deeply branching family of organisms (40Pitulle C. Yang Y. Marchiani M.

Our results suggest that eukaryotic TyrRSs had opportunities to gain “cytokine” functions throughout their long evolution, by the addition of an extra domain and by accumulation of mutations. It is worth noting that Neurospora crassa and Podospora anserina mitochondrial TyrRSs also have other functions,i.e. catalysis of RNA splicing (43Akins R.A. Lambowitz A.M.

These proteins contain appended domains at their N and C termini when compared with other mitochondrial TyrRSs, and these appended domains are important for splicing (45Cherniack A.D. Garriga G.

https://openalex.org/W2011587824,"Early events in apoptotic cascades initiated by ceramides or by activation of the surface receptor CD95 (Fas/APO-1) include the formation of ganglioside GD3. GD3 appears to be both necessary and sufficient to propagate this lipid-mediated apoptotic pathway. Later events common to many apoptotic pathways include induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (PT) and cytochrome c release, which in turn triggers downstream caspases and cell death. The links between GD3 formation and downstream stages of apoptosis are unknown. We report that ganglioside GD3 directly induces the PT in isolated rat liver mitochondria at 30–100 μm in the presence of exogenous substrate (succinate) and at ∼3 μm in the absence of exogenous substrate. In contrast, other gangliosides tested (e.g. GM1) have only weak stimulatory effects in the presence of succinate and protect against PT induction in the absence of respiratory substrates. GD3-mediated induction of PT was antagonized by known PT inhibitors, namely cyclosporin A, ADP, trifluoperazine, and Mg2+. GD3 induced PT even in the presence of submicromolar Ca2+; GD3 is therefore the first biological PT inducer identified that does not require elevated Ca2+. Exposure to GD3 also led to mitochondrial cytochrome c release. In contrast, C2-ceramide, which can initiate the lipid-mediated apoptotic cascade in susceptible cells, failed to either induce PT or release cytochrome c . These observations suggest that GD3 propagates apoptosis by inducing the PT and cytochrome c release.

Ceramides appear to require the presence of mitochondria and a “cytosolic factor” to trigger downstream apoptotic events (21Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Larochette N. Dallaporta B. Marzo I. Brenner C. Hirsch T. Petit P.X. Geuskens M. Kroemer G. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Ceramide elevation during the apoptotic cascade rapidly (5 min) induces the activation of ganglioside GD3 synthase (α-2,8-sialyltransferase) within the Golgi (22Allan D. Kallen K.J. Prog.

This portion of the lipid-mediated pathway appears essential for ceramide-induced apoptosis (12De Maria R. Rippo M.R. Schuchman E.H. Testi R. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). DeMaria et al. (13De Maria R. Lenti L. Malisan F. d'Agostino F. Tomassini B. Zeuner A. Rippo M.R. Testi R. Science. 1997; 277: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) have shown that: 1) activation of GD3 synthase is sufficient to induce apoptosis in cultured lymphoid cells (HuT78), 2) the addition of exogenous GD3 is sufficient to induce apoptosis in HuT78 and myeloid (U937) cells, and 3) inhibition of GD3 synthase is sufficient to prevent CD95-induced apoptosis. These results indicate that GD3 is both necessary and sufficient for CD95- and ceramide-mediated apoptosis. The immediate downstream targets of GD3 have not been identified. We hypothesize that mitochondria are the immediate downstream target of GD3. Consistent with this is the known transport of gangliosides from the Golgi to the mitochondria (24Matyas G.R. Morre D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 921: 599-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is also supported by the observation (13De Maria R. Lenti L. Malisan F. d'Agostino F. Tomassini B. Zeuner A. Rippo M.R. Testi R. Science. 1997; 277: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) that GD3-mediated apoptosis includes the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ). Loss of ΔΨ is a classic hallmark of the mitochondrial permeability transition (PT) (25Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar, 26Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Bernardi P.

Thus, the data suggest that the presence of GD3 may initiate an event or series of events that culminate in the induction of the PT and subsequent activation of the downstream stages of apoptosis. PT induction has been proposed to contribute to both cellular apoptosis and necrosis in a variety of situations, including ischemia reperfusion, excitotoxicity, and T-lymphocyte cell death (29Duchen M.R.

The PT involves the opening of a pore in the inner mitochondrial membrane that allows free diffusion of solutes with mass under 1500 daltons (25Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar, 26Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Bernardi P.

PT induction abolishes oxidative phosphorylation, leads to loss of the mitochondrial proton gradient, and allows efflux of mitochondrially sequestered calcium into the cytoplasm (25Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar, 26Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.S. Gavin C.E. Am. J.

Commun. 1989; 163: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These consequences on energy metabolism and calcium homeostasis, as well as the biochemical identity of the first PT inducers studied (high calcium, oxidants, inorganic phosphate), led to a recognition of the probable role of PT in ischemia reperfusion injury (29Duchen M.R. McGuiness O. Brown L.A. Crompton M. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 1790-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The involvement of PT in apoptosis has been recognized more recently. The PT has been proposed to propagate the apoptotic cascade by triggering the mitochondrial release of apoptosis inducing factor, which stimulates nuclear fragmentation, and cytochrome c , which activates the downstream caspases that effect the end stage of apoptosis (38Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Constantini P. Loeffler M.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence converge to support the view that the PT propagates the downstream stages of apoptosis mediated by the lipid-dependent pathway that includes ceramide and GD3. First, studies in cell-free systems indicate that PT is sufficient to induce the downstream stages of apoptosis (42Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Marchetti P. Hirsch T. Gomez-Monterrey I. Castedo M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1533-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). Second, loss of ΔΨ, a hallmark of the PT, can precede and correlate with various markers of apoptotic cell death induced by this family of inducers (CD95, TNF, ceramide, GD3) (13De Maria R. Lenti L. Malisan F. d'Agostino F. Tomassini B. Zeuner A. Rippo M.R. Testi R. Science. 1997; 277: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 43Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. Decaudin D. Macho A. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Petit P.X. Mignotte B. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). Third, cyclosporin A (CsA), the best established pharmacologic PT inhibitor, delays or prevents the progression of induced apoptosis in cultured cells (34Castedo M. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Macho A. Kroemer G. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 512-521PubMed Google Scholar, 44Kroemer G. Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 44-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). Fourth, treatment with CsA delays the loss of ΔΨ during apoptosis mediated by TNF and ceramide (43Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. Decaudin D. Macho A. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Petit P.X. Mignotte B. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). Fifth, TNF-induced cytotoxicity in L929 cells, which may occur via apoptosis and/or necrosis (45Sánchez-Alcázar J.A. Ruiz-Cabello J. Hernandez-Munoz I. Pobre P.S. de la Torre P. Siles-Rivas E.

Cytotoxicity in this model is delayed by PT inhibitors, suggesting the involvement of PT in cell death (47Hehner S.P. Hofmann T.G. Ratter F. Dumont A. Dröge W. Schmitz M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18117-18121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar,48Pastorino J.G. Simbula G. Yamamoto K. Glascott Jr., P.A. Rothman R.J. Farber J.L. J. Biol.

We tested the hypothesis that GD3 directly mediates PT induction by examining the ability of GD3 and related compounds to induce the PT. Data presented demonstrate that GD3, but not other gangliosides or C2-ceramide, accelerated the PT in isolated rat liver mitochondria in either the presence or absence of exogenous substrate. Strikingly, GD3 was capable of inducing the PT in the presence of submicromolar Ca2+. GD3 is therefore the first physiological inducer clearly shown not to require elevated Ca2+. Furthermore, GD3, but not C2-ceramide, induced the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. These results are consistent with our hypothesis that GD3 itself directly enlists mitochondria into the apoptotic cascade. Liver mitochondria were isolated from 4–6 month old male Fischer 344 rats essentially as described previously (49Kristal B.S Park B.K. Yu B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6033-6038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Briefly, livers were rapidly homogenized in ice-cold isolation buffer (250 mm mannitol, 75 mmsucrose, 100 μm K-EDTA, 10 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with 500 μm K-EGTA (pH 7.4). Homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were removed and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 15 min. Pellets were washed three times in isolation buffer supplemented with 0.5% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma A-6003). The first wash buffer was also supplemented with 500 μm EGTA. The final mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in the same buffer without EGTA or bovine serum albumin. PT induction was assessed spectrophotometrically essentially as described previously (49Kristal B.S Park B.K. Yu B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6033-6038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 50Rigobello M.P. Toninello A. Siliprandi D. Bindoli A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 1276-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) by suspending ∼0.1–0.2 mg of mitochondrial protein at room temperature in 200 μl of 215 mm mannitol, 71 mm sucrose, 5 mm K-HEPES (pH 7.4) in the presence (or, where indicated, absence) of 10 mm sodium succinate. Gangliosides (Alexis, Matreya) were dissolved in water. C2-ceramide (Biomol) was dissolved in ethanol, and the appropriate concentrations of ethanol (≤1.5%) were added to controls run in parallel with ceramide samples. Changes in absorbance at 540 nm (A 540) were followed for 2 h using a SpectraMax 250 Plate Reader (Molecular Dynamics). The total divalent cation concentration present in the buffer was estimated by a spectrophotometric sequestration assay to be ∼5 μm(60% of which, ∼3 μm, was Ca2+) using 2.5 μm of the indicators Mag-Fura-2 and Fura Red and the cation chelators EDTA, EGTA, and tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine. Results for Ca2+ concentrations determined by this method are consistent with atomic absorption studies. Use of this method revealed that preparing buffers from most standard research grade chemicals and deionized water led to levels of divalent cations, particularly Ca2+, which were unacceptable (as high as ∼30 μm Ca2+). We therefore prepared all buffers from deionized water (>15 megohm) and the highest purity reagents available. Mitochondrial supernatants and pellets were collected following a 5-min centrifugation (∼14,000 ×g ). Western blotting was done using minor modifications of established procedures. Proteins were separated using 4–20% Tris-tricine polyacrylamide gels. Following transfer, membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% fetal calf sera, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.5% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline. Incubations with primary antibody were carried out overnight at a dilution of 1:2000. Incubations (30 min) with goat anti-mouse, alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Bio-Rad) were also carried out at a dilution of 1:2000. Nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Bio-Rad) were used as substrates according to the supplier's instructions. All incubations were carried out at room temperature. PT induction in liver mitochondria isolated from male Fischer 344 rats was monitored spectrophotometrically as loss of absorbance using established methods (49Kristal B.S Park B.K. Yu B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6033-6038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 50Rigobello M.P. Toninello A. Siliprandi D. Bindoli A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 1276-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Concentrations of GD3 ≥3 μm increased the rate of PT induction in the absence of exogenous substrate (Fig.1, A and B ). This dose of GD3 (3 μm) is ∼ 40-fold lower than that required to induce apoptotic cell death in 50% of cultured HuT78 cells at 24 h (13De Maria R. Lenti L. Malisan F. d'Agostino F. Tomassini B. Zeuner A. Rippo M.R. Testi R. Science. 1997; 277: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The ability of GD3 to accelerate induction was most notable in the absence of added Ca2+ (i.e. total Ca2+ ∼3 μm, see “Experimental Procedures”). Indeed, ≥12 μm exogenous Ca2+ (∼15 μm total) induced PT in the absence of GD3 with such rapid kinetics that additional effects of GD3 were undetectable (Fig. 1 C ). The ability of gangliosides GD1a, GM1, and GT1b to induce PT was examined to control for nonspecific effects of gangliosides, such as the effects on lipid organization or ion permeability (51Sarti P. Antonini G. Malatesta F. Vallone B. Brunori M. Masserini M. Palestini P. Tettamanti G. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 52Tettamanti G. Riboni L. Prog. Brain Res. 1994; 101: 77-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These gangliosides do not to induce apoptosis in the HuT78 system (13De Maria R. Lenti L. Malisan F. d'Agostino F. Tomassini B. Zeuner A. Rippo M.R. Testi R. Science. 1997; 277: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Unlike GD3, gangliosides (GD1a, GM1, or GT1b) delayed PT induction at 30 μm and completely prevented induction at 100 μm (Fig. 1 D ). Some protection persisted even at higher Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 1, E andF ). Ganglioside specificity was maintained in the presence of exogenous substrate, although the concentration of GD3 required to induce PT increased 10–30-fold. In the presence of 10 mm succinate, which increases mitochondrial resistance to PT induction, 100 μm GD3 rapidly induced PT at all calcium concentrations tested (Fig. 2, A–D ); 3–10 μm GD3 accelerated PT induction when total Ca2+ was ∼27 μm (i.e. 24 μm added Ca2+, Fig. 2 D ), a concentration typically used for PT studies. Gangliosides GD1a, GT1b, and GM1 had only minimal effects until total calcium was ∼27 μm (Fig. 2, E–H ), again demonstrating a specific response to GD3. In contrast to GD3, C2-ceramide had no consistent effects on PT induction in either the presence or absence of exogenous substrate (Fig. 3), even at concentrations of C2-ceramide 4-fold higher than those that induce cellular apoptosis (12De Maria R. Rippo M.R. Schuchman E.H. Testi R. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In some cases, such as that shown in Fig. 3 A , C2-ceramide actually delayed PT induction. Similar results were observed in the presence of increased Ca2+ (not shown). Our studies show that GD3 acted synergistically with free Ca2+ to induce PT. GD3 induction was enhanced by added Ca2+ in the presence of either endogenous substrate (Fig. 1, A–C, and Fig.4, traces D–F ) or added succinate (Fig. 2, C and D ). These data are consistent with previous studies that suggested the necessity of Ca2+ as a co-factor in PT induction (25Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar, 26Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Bernardi P. Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The combined effect of GD3 and Ca2+ on PT induction is saturable. For example, when the PT was induced in the presence of total Ca2+, ≥15 μm, additional effects of GD3 were nearly undetectable (Fig. 1 C and Fig. 4 A–E ,F traces ). Similarly, 30 or 100 μm GD3 were insensitive to Ca2+ addition (Fig. 4, D andE ). This saturation property of GD3 is unlike the interaction of other inducers with Ca2+. Because the potency of GD3 as a PT inducer became more apparent as less Ca2+ was added, we further probed the interactions between GD3 and Ca2+. These data show that GD3 also acted independently of free Ca2+ to induce PT. Free Ca2+ contributed by buffer components (∼3 μm) was reduced by adding 12, 24, or 36 μmof the divalent cation chelator EGTA (K d, 10−10.86 for Ca2+; calculated free Ca2+, ∼5, 2, or 1 pm, respectively). The addition of 12 μm EGTA, which reduces free Ca2+ to ∼5 pm, prevented spontaneous PT induction in controls (no GD3) for at least 2 h (Fig.4 A ). Treatment with ≥10 μm GD3 overcame the EGTA-mediated protection (Fig. 4 A–C, C traces ). Higher doses of EGTA progressively delayed, but did not prevent, GD3-mediated PT induction (Figs. 4 A, A and B traces , and 5C ). GD3 also induced PT with subpicomolar free Ca2+ in the presence of succinate (Fig.5 D ). We wished to confirm that the optical changes were because of PT induction and not a nonspecific loss of absorbance. We therefore tested the efficacy of four well characterized inhibitors of the PT, CsA, MgCl2, ADP, and trifluoperazine (25Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar, 26Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Bernardi P.

Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 1795-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) to prevent GD3-mediated effects (Fig.5). In the absence of succinate, 5 μm CsA, but not 0.5 μm CsA, prevented PT induction by 100 μm GD3 (Fig. 5 A , traces AH, BH, andCH ). Both doses of CsA protected against 10 μmGD3 (Fig. 5 A , traces AL, BL , and CL ). In the presence of succinate, both 0.5 and 5 μm CsA delayed GD3-induced PT but did not prevent it (Fig. 5 B ). The higher CsA dose consistently protected, whereas only some preparations were protected by the lower dose. The addition of 3 mmMgCl2 or 100 μm EGTA resulted in essentially equal inhibition in either the presence or absence of succinate (compare traces B and C in Fig. 5, C or D ). This finding suggests that MgCl2 acted by inhibiting a divalent cation-dependent event, consistent with the known role of MgCl2 as a competitive inhibitor of the calcium uniporter. Note that GD3 induction in the presence of 100 μm EGTA is further delayed relative to induction in the presence of 36 μm EGTA (Fig. 4 A–E, A traces ). In either the presence or absence of succinate, ADP prevented PT induction by 100 μm GD3 (Fig. 5,E and F ). The phospholipase A2 inhibitor trifluoperazine prevented GD3-mediated PT in both the presence and absence of succinate (Fig. 5, G and H ). Protection was dose-dependent, and the protective doses corresponded with those that blocked Ca2+-mediated PT induction (not shown). The inhibitor data shown (Fig. 5) confirm that the GD3-mediated loss of absorbance is because of the induction of the PT. Further support for the hypothesis that GD3 can directly enlist mitochondria into the apoptotic cascade is that GD3-mediated PT induction released mitochondrial cytochromec (Fig. 6). In contrast, cytochrome c was not released from mitochondria in either control or C2-ceramide-treated samples. Release was more variable and less complete in the absence of succinate, suggesting that mitochondrial respiration may promote the release of cytochromec . This possibility is under further investigation. Under the conditions used in this study, GD3 induced a dose-dependent loss of absorbance (Figs. 1, 2, and 4). Use of a series of inhibitors (CsA, MgCl2, ADP, and trifluoperazine; Fig. 5) confirmed that this loss of absorbance resulted from induction of the PT. In contrast, related gangliosides such as GD1a, GM1, or GT1b, which do not induce cell death, failed to induce PT (Figs. 1 and 2). The structural specificity of the sialogangliosides in PT induction is reminiscent of that observed for hydroxyalkenals, where 4-hydroxyhexenal induces the PT at femtomolar levels, but 4-hydroxynonenal requires micromolar concentrations (49Kristal B.S Park B.K. Yu B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6033-6038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The protective action of GM1 may contribute to the protective capacity of this compound to prevent cell death in many systems, including models of ischemia (54Hadjiconstantinou M. Neff N.H. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1335-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 55Weber M. Mohand-Said S. Hicks D. Dreyfus H. Sahel J.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1996; 37: 267-273PubMed Google Scholar). Ceramides can induce both apoptotic and necrotic cell death that are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, including the loss of ΔΨ (8Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Trends Biochem.

Hepatology. 1997; 25: 958-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that biologically active C2-ceramide has little or no direct effect on PT induction or cytochrome c release in isolated mitochondria (Figs. 3and 6). This result differs from a previous report that C2-ceramide can induce PT in isolated liver mitochondria (56Arora A.S. Jones B.J. Patel T.C. Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 958-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The differences may be because of important differences in experimental conditions. The other study used digitonin-treated mitochondria that were purified using a Percoll gradient and assayed in the presence of phosphate, rotenone, and oligomycin. In vitro studies in isolated mitochondria have provided predictive insight into PT induction in cells. However, the PT inducers previously identified by studies in isolated mitochondria, with the exception of the nonphysiologic thiol cross-linking agent phenylarsine oxide, require supraphysiological levels of calcium (e.g. ≥25 μm). Therefore, in vivo PT induction, which occurs without such a profound increase in intracellular Ca2+, must be stimulated by an unidentified component. Our study shows that GD3 may be such a compound. In addition to acting synergistically with Ca2+ to induce PT (Figs. 1, 2, and 4), GD3 can also act independently of free Ca2+ to induce PT (Fig. 4). This behavior is unlike that previously described for naturally occurring PT inducers (25Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar, 26Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Bernardi P. Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The ability of GD3 to induce PT in the presence of submicromolar Ca2+ is important, because intracellular levels of Ca2+ do not rise above 0.4 μm during the early stages of CD95-mediated apoptosis (57Oshimi Y. Oshimi K. Miyazaki S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 495: 319-329Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 58Oshimi Y. Miyazaki S. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 599-609PubMed Google Scholar). Overall, the data presented suggest a biphasic interaction between GD3, divalent cations, and the PT. One phase is apparent when free Ca2+ varies from 0–15 μm (traces C-F in all panels of Fig. 4) and presumably reflects the effects of Ca2+ transported by the mitochondrial uniporter (e.g. , Ca2+ accumulation/cycling) (26Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second phase occurs when free Ca2+ varies in the picomolar range, which is well below the concentration at which the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter acts (26Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GD3-mediated PT induction was progressively delayed by increasing EGTA from 12 to 100 μm (Figs. 4, traces A-C , and 5 C ). A possible explanation for the second phase is that GD3-mediated PT requires a divalent cation that either GD3 or mitochondria bind with an affinity comparable to that of EGTA. The data presented for isolated mitochondria link GD3 to PT induction (Figs. 1, 2, 4, and 5) and cytochrome c releasein vitro (Fig. 6). These data are analogous to data from cell culture studies that link GD3 to the loss of ΔΨ and subsequent apoptotic cell death in vivo (13De Maria R. Lenti L. Malisan F. d'Agostino F. Tomassini B. Zeuner A. Rippo M.R. Testi R. Science. 1997; 277: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Specifically, in cultured cells, elevation of intracellular GD3, whether by synthesis or exogenous addition, is correlated with a loss of ΔΨ and (other) downstream events associated with progression through the lipid-mediated apoptotic pathway (13De Maria R. Lenti L. Malisan F. d'Agostino F. Tomassini B. Zeuner A. Rippo M.R. Testi R. Science. 1997; 277: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that exposure to GD3 directly induced the PT, which abolishes ΔΨ, and released cytochrome c , which can propogate the apoptotic cascade. These data are consistent with reports that PT induction results in cytochrome c release (59Kantrow S.P. Piantadosi C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 60Yang J.C. Cortopassi G.A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 624-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These data also confirm that GD3-mediated PT leads to the release of at least one of the apoptogenic factors associated with activation of downstream caspases. Our data thus support the hypothesis that the mechanism by which GD3 propagates the lipid-mediated apoptotic pathway is a direct induction of the PT (Figs. 1 and 2) and release of mitochondrial cytochromec (Fig. 6). Evidence of GD3-mediated PT induction and cytochrome c release provide a biochemical mechanism linking the early and late stages of CD95-mediated and ceramide-induced apoptosis. The data presented indicate that PT induction and apoptosis can be propagated by the formation of GD3 independent of elevated free intracellular Ca2+. This contrasts with previous work that focused on models in which the PT was driven primarily by high Ca2+. Although Ca2+ appears to be unnecessary in GD3-mediated PT, our data demonstrate that elevated intracellular Ca2+ can synergistically accelerate PT induction both in the presence and in the absence of exogenous respiratory substrates. The observed capacity for synergy between Ca2+ and GD3 in PT induction provides a mechanism by which elevated intracellular Ca2+ may contribute to various forms of cell death involving lipid mediators. These include apoptosis, and probably necrosis, initiated by the activation of CD95 or the TNF receptor as well as cell death subsequent to radiation exposure or HIV infection (8Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 9Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar). Further investigations are needed to determine the mechanisms by which different gangliosides modulate induction or inhibition of PT and the recruitment of mitochondria into the apoptotic cascade."

Severe morphological alterations in the brains of hypothyroid rats are due to impairment of neuronal migration and hypoplasia of neuronal processes which together lead to a reduction in the number of neural circuits (1Legrand J.

Using a gene expression screen (15Wang Z. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11505-11509Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) we recently isolated a large set of early T3-responsive genes from the Xenopus tadpole CNS, several of which encode transcriptional regulatory proteins (16Denver R.J. Pavgi S. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8179-8188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We identified one of these genes as the Xenopus homolog of the mammalian basic transcription element-binding protein (BTEB), a small GC box-binding protein capable of activating or repressing the transcription of genes with GC-box sequences in their promoter (17Imataka H. Sogawa K. Yasumoto K. Kikuchi Y. Sasano K. Kobayashi A. Hayami M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3663-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 18Brown D.D. Wang Z. Furlow J.D.

BTEB has significant sequence similarity to the Sp family of transcription factors, primarily in the zinc finger region (DNA-binding domain). But beyond the DNA-binding domain the two proteins share little similarity. For example, rat Sp1 is a 788-amino acid protein while rat BTEB is only 244 amino acids in length. Interestingly, while BTEB mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in the rat, the mRNA appears to be translated only in the brain (19Imataka H. Nakayama K. Yasumoto K. Mizuno A. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Hayami M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20668-20673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Using a cross-species hybridization approach we identified BTEB as a T3-regulated gene in developing rat brain. The objectives of the present study were to analyze the developmental and T3-dependent expression of BTEB in rat brain, and to test for a role for this transcription factor in T3-dependent effects on the developing brain.DISCUSSIONWe have identified the small GC box-binding transcription factor BTEB as a T3-regulated gene in the developing rodent CNS. The expression of BTEB mRNA in the developing rat brain depends on thyroid status; the induction of hypothyroidism in neonatal pups resulted in reduced expression that was restored by T3replacement therapy. Furthermore, the gene is developmentally regulated, exhibiting a distinct elevation in expression that parallels developmentally-dependent increases in plasma T3 levels (2Porterfield S.P. Hendrich C.E. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 94-106PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to other T3 responsive genes in the developing CNS, T3 regulation of BTEB gene expression disappears in the adult (Ref. 37Strait K.A. Zou L. Oppenheimer J.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1874-1880PubMed Google Scholar; see Fig. 2).BTEB is the first T3-responsive gene to be identified that is differentially regulated by T3 in specific neural cell types. We showed that BTEB mRNA expression is up-regulated by T3 in primary neurons and astrocytes derived from embryonic and neonatal rat brain, respectively, but not in oligodendrocytes. The effect of T3 on BTEB mRNA levels in primary neurons is unlikely to be due to contaminating astrocytes (which represent ∼15% of the cell population) since the degree of BTEB mRNA induction in neuronal cultures is much greater than that observed in the astrocyte cultures (6.5 versus 1.3-fold). Because most of the neurons cease division after 8 days in vitro , our results indicate that the effect of T3 on BTEB gene expression occurs in post-mitotic neurons. This result is consistent with the up-regulation of BTEB mRNA by T3 observed in the brain of the P22 rat (see Fig. 1). Similarly, we have found that the effect of T3 on BTEB mRNA levels in N-2a[TRβ1] cells is absent during the first 48 h of culture and is not expressed until the cells are confluent. This suggests that the cells must cease division before BTEB can be up-regulated by T3. We have not yet determined whether neurons and astrocytes express BTEB and are responsive to T3 in vivo ; however, it is noteworthy that our previous work has shown that these primary neurons express their program of differentiation similar to that observedin vivo (20Puymirat J. L'Herault S. Dussault J.H. Dev. Brain Res. 1992; 69: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 32Puymirat J. Faivre-Bauman A. Neurosci. Lett. 1986; 68: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Our findings demonstrate the utility of using a cross-species hybridization approach to identify novel hormone-regulated genes in the developing rodent brain. Recent attempts to isolate T3-regulated genes in neonatal rodent brain by differential screening procedures have met with limited success. These studies have lead to the identification of several mitochondrial genes (12 S and 16 S rRNAs, cytochrome c oxidase subunit III and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3; Refs. 11Iglesias T. Caubin J. Zaballos A. Bernal J. Munoz A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 995-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar and 12Vega-Nunez E. Menendez-Hurtado A. Garesse R. Santos A. Perez-Castillo A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), a tubulin and NCAM (13Iglesias T. Caubin J. Stunnenberg H.G. Zaballos A. Bernal J. Munoz A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4307-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), a novel synaptogamin-related protein (involved with regulating neurotransmitter release) and a zinc finger protein related to the product of a recently identify mouse gene, hairless (14Thompson C.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7832-7840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Thompson C.C. Bottcher M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8527-8532Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Given the dramatic and pleiotropic effects of T3 on CNS development, this set of genes likely represents only a small fraction of the total number of genes controlled by the hormone. Also, given that thyroid and steroid hormones bring about developmental changes by activating gene regulation programs, it is surprising that so few transcriptional regulatory proteins have been isolated from rodent brain as T3-responsive genes. We previously isolated by subtractive hybridization 34 cDNAs that correspond to T3-regulated genes in the Xenopus tadpole CNS (16Denver R.J. Pavgi S. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8179-8188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Several of these genes are transcriptional regulatory proteins, and we hypothesized that similar sets of genes would be regulated by the hormone in mammal brain. BTEB is the first such gene that we have analyzed and found to be similarly regulated in frog and rodent brain. Our success raises the possibility that other rat homologs of frog genes isolated by our gene expression screen will also be found to be regulated by T3in the developing mammal brain.BTEB Gene Regulation May Be Specific to the TRβ1 IsoformBecause TRα1 and TRβ1 are differentially expressed in the developing brain we hypothesized that each TR isoform might regulate distinct sets of genes in different brain regions. Lebel and colleagues (9Lebel J.M. Dussault J.H. Puymirat J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2644-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) developed neuronal cell lines (Neuro-2a cells; derived from a mouse neuroblastoma) that overexpress either the TRα1 or TRβ1 isoform (N-2a[TRα1] or N-2a[TRβ1]). Our results using these two cell lines suggest that BTEB gene regulation is specific to the TRβ1 isoform. These two cell lines express similar levels of T3 binding activity (∼7-fold over the parental cell line). Furthermore, the TRα1 expression plasmid produces a transcriptionally active receptor in a transient transfection assay using a luciferase reporter gene construct under control of a thyroid hormone response element (9Lebel J.M. Dussault J.H. Puymirat J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2644-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that when constructing the overexpressing cell lines, Lebel and colleagues screened 20 TRα1-expressing clones and none were responsive to T3 in terms of its antiproliferative and differentiative effects. Conversely, the majority of TRβ1-expressing clones were responsive to T3. Taken together, our results support the view that BTEB is regulated by T3 through a specific interaction with the TRβ1 in neural cells. Whether such differential gene regulation by TR isoforms occurs in the developing brain has not yet been determined. However, correlative evidence suggests that BTEB may be regulated by T3 through an interaction with TRβ1 in the developing brain. For example, the expression of BTEB mRNA and its regulation by T3 correlates more closely with the appearance of TRβ1 than it does with TRα1 in primary neuronal cultures (20Puymirat J. L'Herault S. Dussault J.H. Dev. Brain Res. 1992; 69: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and in the developing rat brain (7Puymirat J. Prog. Neurobiol. 1992; 39: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).Transcriptional Regulation of BTEB Gene Expression by Thyroid HormoneThe rapid kinetics of T3 up-regulation of BTEB mRNA in N-2a[TRβ1] cells (see Fig. 4) suggested that T3 might directly regulate BTEB gene transcription. Our finding that the up-regulation of BTEB mRNA by T3occurs in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide provides further support for this hypothesis. The effect of T3 is probably not due to the stabilization of the mRNA since treatment with actinomycin D abolished the T3 effect on the level of BTEB mRNA. In addition, nuclear run-on analysis experiments confirm that T3 alters the rate of transcription of the BTEB gene (Fig. 6). Taken together, these results provide strong support for a direct transcriptional action of T3 on BTEB gene expression.Functional Consequences of BTEB Gene ExpressionThe expression of the BTEB gene in the developing rat brain coincides with the neonatal rise in TRβ1 and with the neonatal surge in the level of serum T3, suggesting that BTEB could mediate some of the postnatal effects of T3 on neural cell differentiation. Although there is evidence for a role for thyroid hormones in the control of the duration of the proliferative phase of neuroblasts and oligodendrocyte progenitors, our results argue against a role for BTEB in these actions. T3 regulates BTEB gene expression in post-mitotic cultured neurons and, BTEB is expressed essentially postnatally in the developing cerebral hemispheres during a period where most neuronal cells have ceased mitosis. It is also unlikely that BTEB is involved in the effect of T3 on the control of the proliferative phase of oligodendrocyte progenitors (O-2A) since these cells do not express TRβ1 (39Baas D. Bourbeau D. Sarlieve L.L. Dussault J.H. Puymirat J. Glia. 1997; 19: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).It is well established that the absence of thyroid hormone during the neonatal/postnatal period causes profound alterations in CNS development, including deficiency in myelination, neurite outgrowth, and the development of specific neuronal functions. It is unlikely that BTEB is involved with T3 action on myelination since the gene does not appear to be regulated by T3 in oligodendrocytes, at least not in vitro . A major effect of T3 on primary cultured neurons is on neurite outgrowth (21Garza R. Dussault J.H. Puymirat J. Dev. Brain Res. 1988; 43: 287-298Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar); similar effects of the hormone are seen in N-2a[TRβ1] cells (9Lebel J.M. Dussault J.H. Puymirat J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2644-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the present study, in addition to increasing the number of neurites (as reported by Lebel et al. (9Lebel J.M. Dussault J.H. Puymirat J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2644-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar)) we found that T3 treatment of N-2a[TRβ1] cells also increased neurite length. This difference is most likely due to the different incubation times in the two studies (48 h exposure to T3 in the study by Lebel et al. (9Lebel J.M. Dussault J.H. Puymirat J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2644-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) versus 5 day exposure to T3 in the present study).Our findings support a role for BTEB in mediating some of the postnatal effects of thyroid hormone. Here we show that expression of BTEB induces neurite outgrowth in N-2a cells. This effect was observed after 5 days in culture when most cells are confluent, suggesting that N-2a cells must cease division, probably by contact inhibition, before the up-regulation of BTEB can exert its effects on neurite outgrowth. It is noteworthy that the level of BTEB mRNA expression in clone number 10 (3-fold) is comparable to the level of T3-induced expression of this gene in both primary neurons (Fig. 3) and N-2a[TRβ] cells (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the number and length of neurites observed with N-2a[BTEB] clone number 10 was comparable to that observed in N-2a[TRβ1] cells treated with T3 for 5 days (see Table II; Fig. 7). These observations argue against the generation of a neomorphic phenotype as a result of overexpression of this transcription factor. Because our results with BTEB overexpression were obtained in a stably transfected neuroblastoma cell line, at present we can only speculate on the role that BTEB plays in vivo in the developing brain. However, taken together, our findings suggest that BTEB could be a critical component of the signaling pathway induced by the hormone in the developing brain; studies are underway to test this hypothesis in primary neurons. Furthermore, the parallel between the effect of T3 on neurite outgrowth and the associated elevation of BTEB mRNA in primary neuronal cultures is consistent with this hypothesis (21Garza R. Dussault J.H. Puymirat J. Dev. Brain Res. 1988; 43: 287-298Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar).The transcriptional regulation of BTEB gene expression by T3 suggests that up-regulation of this transcription factor is one of the earliest events (following TR activation) in T3-induced neurite outgrowth. The absence of an effect of BTEB overexpression on AchE activity in N-2a cells indicates that different transcriptional regulatory pathways mediate the action of T3 on neurite outgrowth and the induction AchE activity. These findings illustrate the complexity of the molecular mechanisms that underly the action of the hormone in specific neural cell types. The earliest observed effect of T3 in N-2a[TRβ] cells is to block, by an unknown mechanism, cellular proliferation (9Lebel J.M. Dussault J.H. Puymirat J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2644-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). AchE activity is then stimulated and this involves the activation of a serine/threonine protein kinase pathway (33Puymirat J. Etongue-Mayer P. Dussault J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30651-30656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The cessation of cellular proliferation is followed by an increase in neurite outgrowth, most probably through activation of BTEB gene expression. Our results indicate that T3 can produce a variety of cell-type and temporally-specific effects through an interaction with the same thyroid hormone receptor. Our findings provide a first step toward understanding the complex gene expression changes induced by the hormone in the developing brain. Thyroid hormone (3,5,3′-triiodothyronine; T3)1 is essential for normal development of the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS). Thyroid hormone deficiency during the period of active neurogenesis (up to 6 months post-partum in humans) results in irreversible mental retardation (i.e. cretinism; Refs. 1Legrand J. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1983; 78: 603-652Google Scholar and 2Porterfield S.P. Hendrich C.E. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 94-106PubMed Google Scholar). The hormone influences diverse processes in the developing brain including neuronal maturation, neurite outgrowth, synapse formation, and myelination (2Porterfield S.P. Hendrich C.E. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 94-106PubMed Google Scholar). Severe morphological alterations in the brains of hypothyroid rats are due to impairment of neuronal migration and hypoplasia of neuronal processes which together lead to a reduction in the number of neural circuits (1Legrand J. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1983; 78: 603-652Google Scholar, 2Porterfield S.P. Hendrich C.E. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 94-106PubMed Google Scholar, 3Dussault J.H. Ruel J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1987; 49: 321-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Relatively little is known of the molecular mechanisms of T3 action on the developing brain. The actions of T3 are mediated by ligand-dependent transcription factors (4Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar, 5Mangelsdorf D.J.

Three functional thyroid hormone receptors (TRα1, TRβ1, and TRβ2) encoded by two genes (α and β) have been identified (6Forrest D. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 167-176PubMed Google Scholar). In the rat brain TRα1 expression is detected by embryonic day 14 and remains the major TR isoform expressed before postnatal day 7, while the TRβ1 becomes the predominant TR isoform after the second week of life (7Puymirat J. Prog. Neurobiol. 1992; 39: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The differential expression of the TR isoforms suggests developmental and brain region-specific functions for these receptors (6Forrest D. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 167-176PubMed Google Scholar, 7Puymirat J. Prog. Neurobiol. 1992; 39: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 8Lebel J.M. L'Herault S. Dussault J.H. Puymirat J.

Differential screening experiments have identified several T3-regulated genes in the rodent CNS (10Munoz A. Rodriguez-Pena A. Perez-Castillo A. Ferreiro B. Sutcliffe J.G. Bernal J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 11Iglesias T. Caubin J. Zaballos A. Bernal J. Munoz A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7832-7840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); but, roles for the protein products of these genes in T3 action on the brain have not been established. Using a gene expression screen (15Wang Z. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11505-11509Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) we recently isolated a large set of early T3-responsive genes from the Xenopus tadpole CNS, several of which encode transcriptional regulatory proteins (16Denver R.J. Pavgi S. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8179-8188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We identified one of these genes as the Xenopus homolog of the mammalian basic transcription element-binding protein (BTEB), a small GC box-binding protein capable of activating or repressing the transcription of genes with GC-box sequences in their promoter (17Imataka H. Sogawa K. Yasumoto K. Kikuchi Y. Sasano K. Kobayashi A. Hayami M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3663-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 18Brown D.D. Wang Z. Furlow J.D.

BTEB has significant sequence similarity to the Sp family of transcription factors, primarily in the zinc finger region (DNA-binding domain). But beyond the DNA-binding domain the two proteins share little similarity. For example, rat Sp1 is a 788-amino acid protein while rat BTEB is only 244 amino acids in length. Interestingly, while BTEB mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in the rat, the mRNA appears to be translated only in the brain (19Imataka H. Nakayama K. Yasumoto K. Mizuno A. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Hayami M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20668-20673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using a cross-species hybridization approach we identified BTEB as a T3-regulated gene in developing rat brain. The objectives of the present study were to analyze the developmental and T3-dependent expression of BTEB in rat brain, and to test for a role for this transcription factor in T3-dependent effects on the developing brain. DISCUSSIONWe have identified the small GC box-binding transcription factor BTEB as a T3-regulated gene in the developing rodent CNS. The expression of BTEB mRNA in the developing rat brain depends on thyroid status; the induction of hypothyroidism in neonatal pups resulted in reduced expression that was restored by T3replacement therapy. Furthermore, the gene is developmentally regulated, exhibiting a distinct elevation in expression that parallels developmentally-dependent increases in plasma T3 levels (2Porterfield S.P. Hendrich C.E. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 94-106PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to other T3 responsive genes in the developing CNS, T3 regulation of BTEB gene expression disappears in the adult (Ref. 37Strait K.A. Zou L. Oppenheimer J.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1874-1880PubMed Google Scholar; see Fig. 2).BTEB is the first T3-responsive gene to be identified that is differentially regulated by T3 in specific neural cell types. We showed that BTEB mRNA expression is up-regulated by T3 in primary neurons and astrocytes derived from embryonic and neonatal rat brain, respectively, but not in oligodendrocytes. The effect of T3 on BTEB mRNA levels in primary neurons is unlikely to be due to contaminating astrocytes (which represent ∼15% of the cell population) since the degree of BTEB mRNA induction in neuronal cultures is much greater than that observed in the astrocyte cultures (6.5 versus 1.3-fold). Because most of the neurons cease division after 8 days in vitro , our results indicate that the effect of T3 on BTEB gene expression occurs in post-mitotic neurons. This result is consistent with the up-regulation of BTEB mRNA by T3 observed in the brain of the P22 rat (see Fig. 1). Similarly, we have found that the effect of T3 on BTEB mRNA levels in N-2a[TRβ1] cells is absent during the first 48 h of culture and is not expressed until the cells are confluent. This suggests that the cells must cease division before BTEB can be up-regulated by T3. We have not yet determined whether neurons and astrocytes express BTEB and are responsive to T3 in vivo ; however, it is noteworthy that our previous work has shown that these primary neurons express their program of differentiation similar to that observedin vivo (20Puymirat J.

In large measure, this surge of experimentation has resulted from the development of a number of techniques purporting to purify these invaginated microdomains from various cells and/or tissues. Cumulatively, the similarities between the lists of molecules identified in these preparations has been rather striking. It is interesting that this remarkable overall agreement has been minimally appreciated or acknowledged but rather only the few, yet significant differences have come to the forefront of discussion about this field. As with most fields growing rapidly in the modern era of research, this field has experienced its growing pains and controversies. Time resolves most scientific disputes, and here we wish to contribute new constructive information that may provide a firm basis for better understanding the basics of caveolae purification as well as the basis of both the similarities and differences found in the major methods currently devised for caveolae isolation.

Although a significant step forward, this methodology actually isolates caveolae along with other cell surface and intracellular microdomains, all with similar buoyant densities and detergent resistance (13Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Many vesicles in TRM are much larger than caveolae and are quite rich in GPI-anchored proteins but not caveolin (13Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Similar large Triton-resistant vesicles, which have the same buoyant density and are rich in GPI-anchored proteins, are readily isolated from cells apparently neither expressing caveolin nor having morphologically distinguishable caveolae (14Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30745-30748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Gorodinsky A. Harris D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Finally, although TRM contain most of the caveolin in the cell and caveolin is an excellent marker for caveolae at the cell surface, caveolin can exist elsewhere including the trans-Golgi network (4Kurzchalia T.V.

Simons K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1597-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). In 1994, caveolae were isolated directly from plasma membranes that first had been isolated away from other potential contaminants, including Golgi membranes, by using an in situ silica-coating procedure (13Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 16Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Jacobson B.S. Dvorak A.M. Mol. Biol.

In this procedure, caveolae are sheared away from the silica-coated rat lung endothelial cell plasma membranes before isolation by sucrose density centrifugation. This method yields an apparently homogeneous population of low density vesicles that morphologically are similar in size and shape to caveolae and biochemically are enriched in various caveolar markers (caveolin, inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate-like receptor, dynamin, sialoglycolipid GM1, and calcium ATPase) while being markedly depleted in noncaveolar markers (13Schnitzer J.E.

This subfractionation allows (i) caveolae to be isolated with or without detergent and (ii) plasmalemmal membranes rich in GPI-anchored proteins but devoid of caveolin to be isolated separately from caveolae rich in caveolin but not GPI-anchored proteins (13Schnitzer J.E.

Some caveolar signaling molecules, especially those with lipid anchors, are solubilized to various degrees by Triton X-100 (22Liu J. Oh P. Horner T. Rogers R.A. Schnitzer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7211-7222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). To confirm that molecules thus found in caveolae are indeed in the same caveolae coated with caveolin, a process was developed in 1995 (19Schnitzer J.E. Liu J. Oh P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14399-14404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) using magnetic beads to immunoisolate caveolae. Over the last 4 years, this immunoaffinity isolation has verified the existence of many different proteins in caveolae including signaling proteins activated by growth factors (22Liu J. Oh P. Horner T. Rogers R.A. Schnitzer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7211-7222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), the fusion protein synaptobrevin (also known as VAMP) (19Schnitzer J.E. Liu J. Oh P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14399-14404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), and dynamin (20Oh P. McIntosh D.P. Schnitzer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Immunoisolations have also been performed on transfected cells expressing recombinant tagged caveolins (23Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). As it became apparent that TRM are not purified caveolae, Anderson and colleagues (24Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar) developed an alternative procedure that first isolates a plasma membrane-rich fraction on a Percoll gradient and then sonicates these membranes to release caveolae for collection in low density fractions after OptiPrep-gradient centrifugation. This isolate was reported to be nearly identical in composition to TRM except for the avoidance of detergent extraction of a few signaling molecules such as G protein subunits (24Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). It is quite enriched in caveolin, GPI-anchored proteins, and various signaling molecules. Sonication with sodium carbonate treatment has been used to isolate a low density caveolar fraction containing caveolin and signaling molecules but not GPI-anchored proteins (23Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Finally, caveolae have been isolated under conditions that avoid physical detachment but rather utilize physiological release by adding GTP to induce caveolar budding from plasma membranes (25Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Oh P. Science. 1996; 274 (Correction): 239-242Science. 1996; 274 (Correction)1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Dynamin at the neck of caveolae hydrolyzes GTP to release free caveolar transport vesicles that can be isolated by density centrifugation and are rich in caveolin and other caveolar markers but not GPI-anchored proteins (20Oh P. McIntosh D.P. Schnitzer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 25Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Oh P.

Ghitescu L. Palade G.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) concluded differently using a methodology that mixed different aspects of past procedures (13Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P.

Instead of shearing, sonication was used in this study to dislodge caveolae from silica-coated rat lung endothelial cell plasma membranes before isolating the low density, caveolin-enriched vesicles by sucrose gradient centrifugation. This fraction was subjected to immunoisolation overnight using a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised to a synthetic peptide similar to N-terminal region of caveolin. Although several signaling molecules were concentrated in low density, caveolin-rich vesicles released by sonication, little to no signal for many of these molecules such as eNOS and G proteins was reported in the immunoisolated caveolae. It was concluded from the data shown using volume equivalent analysis that caveolae are not signaling centers. In the end, these latter findings have extended uncertainty in the field from what had been a growing consensus about the lack of concentration of GPI-anchored proteins in caveolae under non-perturbed conditions to now the possible lack of many, if not all, lipid-anchored and possibly other signaling molecules in caveolae. This issue becomes of greater concern because many of the functions ascribed to caveolae, such as signaling, mechanotransduction (21Schnitzer J.E. Born G.V.R. Schwartz C.J.

In this work, we identify a high affinity, caveolin-specific monoclonal antibody that rapidly binds the oligomeric caveolin cage surrounding caveolae. By using this antibody, we have developed a method not only for rapidly purifying caveolae from cell and tissue homogenates but also for testing the purity of caveolae isolated using different methodologies. We identify factors that are important in purifying and analyzing caveolae and that explain the few but key compositional differences detected in various caveolar preparations. Antibodies against caveolin were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) (rabbit polyclonal (pAb) and mouse monoclonal (clone 2297 and 2234)) and from Zymed Laboratories Inc.

Protein concentrations were measured using the micro-bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. The luminal endothelial cell plasma membranes and caveolae were isolated directly from rat lung tissue using an in situ silica-coating procedure as described in detail (36Oh P. Schnitzer J.E. Celis J. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 2. Academic Press, Orlando1998: 34-46Google Scholar). Briefly, the rat lungs were perfused via the pulmonary artery with a colloidal silica solution to coat the luminal surface of the endothelium and allow selective isolation of the silica-coated endothelial cell plasma membranes (P) from the lung homogenate (H) by centrifugation. The caveolae are separated from P by shearing and then isolated by sucrose density centrifugation in a low buoyant density fraction (V) well separated from the silica-coated membrane pellet stripped of caveolae (P-V).

The reactivity of caveolin antibodies with the silica-coated endothelial cell plasma membranes (P) was assessed by ELISA. Briefly, equal aliquots of P (5 μg in 100 μl) were placed in each well of a 96-well tray for drying overnight. After washing, the wells were blocked for 1 h with wash buffer (2% ovalbumin and 2 mm CaCl2 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)), incubated with wash buffer alone or containing antibody, washed, incubated with reporter antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:500), and washed again.

It is also well established that heat shock alters the regulation of signaling cascades and transcription factors and is a potent radiosensitizing agent. To explore the hypothesis that heat disrupts or alters the regulation of signaling factors activated by IR, the effect of heat shock on IR-induced activation of NF-kappaB was determined. Irradiated HeLa cells demonstrated transient increases in NF-kappaB DNA binding activity and NF-kappaB protein nuclear localization. In addition, irradiated cells demonstrated increased I-kappaB phosphorylation and decreased I-kappaBalpha cytoplasmic protein levels, corresponding temporally with the increase of NF-kappaB DNA binding. Heat shock prior to IR inhibited the increase in NF-kappaB DNA binding activity, nuclear localization of NF-kappaB, and the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of I-kappaB. I-kappaB kinase (IKK) immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated an increase in IKK catalytic activity in response to IR that was inhibited by pretreatment with heat. Kinetic experiments determined that heat-induced inhibition of NF-kappaB activation in response to IR decayed within 5 h after heating. Furthermore, pretreatment with cycloheximide, to block de novo protein synthesis, did not alter heat shock inhibition of IR induction of NF-kappaB. These experiments demonstrate that heat shock transiently inhibits IR induction of NF-kappaB DNA binding activity by preventing IKK activation and suggests a mechanism independent of protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2066975190,"Although the precise role of oligosaccharides in metastasis is presently unknown, numerous studies suggest that the β1–6 branching structure of N -linked oligosaccharides plays a role in tumor metastasis.N -Acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V), which catalyzes the formation of the β1–6 branch, therefore appears to play a crucial role in tumor metastasis. Recently, we demonstrated that the expression of the GnT-V gene is regulated by a transcriptional factor, Ets-1 (Kang, R., Saito, H., Ihara, Y., Miyoshi, E., Koyama, N., Sheng, Y., and Taniguchi, N. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 26706–26712). In this study, we report an investigation of the general requirement for Ets-1 in the expression of GnT-V in cancer cell lines. In 16 cancer cell lines, the levels of GnT-V mRNA were closely correlated with ets-1 expression (r = 0.97; p < 0.0001). An increase in ets-1 levels by transfection of its cDNA led to an enhancement in GnT-V expression in cells that normally expressed low levels of ets-1. In contrast, the transfection of dominant negative ets-1 into cells that express high levels of ets-1 resulted in a decrease in GnT-V expression. Although Ets-1 cooperates with c-Jun in certain gene expressions, this was not the case in the regulation of theGnT-V gene. These results suggest that Ets-1 plays a significant role in regulating the expression of GnT-V in a variety of cancers and might be involved in the potential for malignancy via the action of GnT-V. Although the precise role of oligosaccharides in metastasis is presently unknown, numerous studies suggest that the β1–6 branching structure of N -linked oligosaccharides plays a role in tumor metastasis.N -Acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V), which catalyzes the formation of the β1–6 branch, therefore appears to play a crucial role in tumor metastasis. Recently, we demonstrated that the expression of the GnT-V gene is regulated by a transcriptional factor, Ets-1 (Kang, R., Saito, H., Ihara, Y., Miyoshi, E., Koyama, N., Sheng, Y., and Taniguchi, N. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 26706–26712). In this study, we report an investigation of the general requirement for Ets-1 in the expression of GnT-V in cancer cell lines. In 16 cancer cell lines, the levels of GnT-V mRNA were closely correlated with ets-1 expression (r = 0.97; p < 0.0001). An increase in ets-1 levels by transfection of its cDNA led to an enhancement in GnT-V expression in cells that normally expressed low levels of ets-1. In contrast, the transfection of dominant negative ets-1 into cells that express high levels of ets-1 resulted in a decrease in GnT-V expression. Although Ets-1 cooperates with c-Jun in certain gene expressions, this was not the case in the regulation of theGnT-V gene. These results suggest that Ets-1 plays a significant role in regulating the expression of GnT-V in a variety of cancers and might be involved in the potential for malignancy via the action of GnT-V. UDP-GlcNAc, α-mannoside β-1,6-N -acetylglucosaminyltransferase V green fluorescence protein TBS-T, Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20 electrophoretic mobility shift assay The glycosylation of cell surface glycoproteins is thought to play a critical role in a variety of specific biological interactions (1Hakomori S.I. Adv. Cancer Res. 1989; 52: 257-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have concluded that alterations of cell surface glycoprotein oligosaccharides cause significant changes in the adhesive or migratory behavior of a cell (2Finne J. Castori S. Feizi T. Burger M.M. Int. J. Cancer. 1989; 43: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The high degree of branching ofN -glycans, in particular, the β1–6 branching type, appears to be related to a potential for the development of malignancy (3Dennis J.W. Laferte S. Waghorne C. Breitman M.L. Kerbel R.S. Science. 1987; 236: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). UDP-GlcNAc, α-mannoside β-1,6-N -acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V),1 represents an enzyme that catalyzes such branching. To understand the molecular basis of this oligosaccharide structure in terms of tumor metastasis, we and other groups have purified GnT-V from rat kidney (4Shoreibah M.G. Perng G.S. Adler B. Weinstein J. Basu R. Cupples R. Wen D. Browne J.K. Buckhaults P. Fregien N. Pierce M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15381-15385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and from a human lung cancer cell line QG (5Gu J. Nishigawa A. Tsuruoka N. Ohno M. Yamaguchi N. Kangawa K. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem. 1993; 113: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and cloned the gene. The expression of GnT-V is enhanced by malignant transformation through theras oncogene (6Pierce M. Arango J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10772-10777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by cell proliferation (7Pierce M. Buckhaults P. Chen L. Fregien N. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and by hepatocarcinogenesis (8Miyoshi E. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Gu J. Sugiyama T. Hayashi N. Fusamoto H. Kamada T. Taniguchi N. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3899-3902PubMed Google Scholar). However, GnT-V is also highly expressed in normal tissues, suggesting that the synthesis of oligosaccharides by GnT-V might be different in normal cells versus cancer cells (9Miyoshi E. Uozumi N. Noda K. Hayashi N. Hori M. Taniguchi N. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 1117-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The most important issue, however, is how GnT-V modifies the metastatic potential of tumor cells. When the GnT-V gene was transfected into a lung epithelioid cell, the transfectant showed an increased tumorigenicity, as evidenced by an assay involving the subcutaneous injection of the cells into nude mice (10Demetriou M. Nabi I.R. Coppolino M. Dedhar S. Dennis J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this cell showed an altered transformed cell morphology, as is often observed for oncogenically transformed cells. In addition, the overexpression of GnT-V resulted in a decrease in serum growth requirements of the contact-inhibited parental cells, but the migration rates of controls increased by 3- to 10-fold, and they adhered less well to fibronectin or collagen type IV. In contrast, when the overexpression of other glycosyltransferases, such as GnT-III, inhibited the action of GnT-V through substrate availability, lung metastasis of melanoma cells was dramatically suppressed (11Yoshimura M. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Taniguchi S. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8754-8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). These data suggest that GnT-V is able to affect the phenotypes of cells directly, that a high level of GnT-V expression in tumor cells with a greater potential for malignancy may not be the result of malignant transformation by other factors, and that GnT-V itself may well be the key biological factor. For these reasons, it is important to elucidate the mechanism by which GnT-V is expressed. We recently isolated human GnT-V genomic DNA clones and showed that the gene consists of 17 exons and spans 155 kilobases (12Saito H. Gu J. Nishigawa A. Ihara Y. Fujii J. Kohgo Y. Taniguchi N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The sequence analysis of the 5′ flanking region of GnT-V revealed that some putative consensus sequences for tissue-specific transcription factors, such as AP-1 and ets, are present in the promoter regions (Fig. 1). The AP-1 site is known to form complexes with the proto-oncogenes c-Jun and c-Fos in response to a wide variety of growth factors (13Curran T. Franza Jr., B. Cell. 1988; 55: 395-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). The Ets family is a novel class of trans -acting phosphoproteins that play important roles in the control of growth and development (14Wasylyk B. Hahn S.H. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). The family is defined by a highly conserved Ets domain (15Wasylyk C. Kerckaert J.-P. Wasylyk B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 965-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), which encodes a winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif (16Donaldson L. Petersen J. Graves B. McIntosh L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). ets binding sites, which contain a common core trinucleotide sequence, GGA, have been identified in the regulatory regions of human T-cell receptor α (17Ho I.C. Bhat N.K. Gottschalk L.R. Lindsten T. Thomson C.B. Papas T.S. Leiden J.M. Science. 1990; 250: 814-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and β (18Prosser H.M. Wotten D. Gegonne A. Ghysdael J. Wang S. Speck N.A. Owen M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9934-9938Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and the interleukin 2β receptor (19Thompson C.B. Wang C.Y. Ho I.C. Bohjanen P.R. Petryniak B. June C.H. Miesfeldt S. Zhang L. Nabel G.J. Karpinski B. Leiden J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), as well as other cellular and viral enhancers. Whereas the stromal expression of c-Ets-1 is correlated with tumor metastasis (20Wernert N. Gilles F. Fafeur V. Bouali F. Raes M.-B. Pyke C. Dupressoir T. Seitz G. Vandenbunder B. Stehelin D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5683-5688PubMed Google Scholar), the overexpression of Ets-1 in colon cancer cells has been reported to result in the suppression of tumorigenesis (21Suzuki H. Romano-Spica V. Papas T.S. Bhat N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4442-4446Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Ets-1 is a multifunctional transcription factor. To demonstrate an involvement of the Ets family in GnT-V gene regulation, we showed that the GnT-V gene is regulated by Ets-1 protein in a human bile duct carcinoma cell line using a gel mobility assay (22Kang R. Saito H. Ihara Y. Miyoshi E. Koyama N. Sheng Y. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26706-26712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Buckhaults et al. also reported that the regulation of the GnT-V gene is mediated by thesrc oncogene in the BHK (baby hamster kidney) fibroblast cell line via the involvement of ets transcription factor (23Buckhaults P. Chen L. Fregien N. Pierce M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19575-19581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These results suggest that regulation of the GnT-V gene is mediated by ets transcription factors in a cell-specific manner. Ets is also known to cooperate with AP-1 in the transcriptional regulation of genes such as interleukin 2 (19Thompson C.B. Wang C.Y. Ho I.C. Bohjanen P.R. Petryniak B. June C.H. Miesfeldt S. Zhang L. Nabel G.J. Karpinski B. Leiden J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), collagenase (24Auble D.T. Brinckerhoff C.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4629-4635Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and human tumor necrosis factor (25Kraemer B. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6577-6583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To provide more broad evidence concerning the role of ets proteins in enhancing GnT-V gene expression, a more general relationship between GnT-V and ets expression in cancer cells would be desirable. This study was undertaken to investigate the issue of whether the expression of GnT-V is correlated with that of ets family mRNAs in 16 human and murine cancer cells and to better understand the effects of overexpression of ets-1 and ets-2 and dominant negative ets-1 and ets-2 on GnT-V expression as well as coordination of AP-1 andGnT-V genes. Human cancer cell lines MKN45 and Kato-III (gastric cancer), A549, Lu99B and Lu65A (lung cancer), PacaII (pancreatic cancer), MB231 (mammary cancer), Huh6, HepG2 (hepatoblastoma), Huh7 (hepatocellular carcinoma), A172 (glioblastoma), mouse melanoma cell line B16-F1, and rat hepatoma cell line AH66tc were obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resource (Tokyo, Japan), and Hep3B (hepatocellular carcinoma) and Colo201 and Colo205 (colon cancer) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). These cell lines were cultured under standard conditions (RPMI 1640 medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nikken Kagaku, Kyoto, Japan) containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics). The antibodies to Ets-1 and Ets-2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Human c-ets-1 cDNA was cloned into the pSVK3 vector, as described previously (22Kang R. Saito H. Ihara Y. Miyoshi E. Koyama N. Sheng Y. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26706-26712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To express the human ets-1 cDNA, its blunt-ended full-length fragment was inserted into the gap-filled Eco RI site of pCAGGS (kindly provided by Dr. J. Miyazaki, Osaka University Medical School, Osaka, Japan), which was controlled by a human β-actin promoter and the Kpn I andBam HI site of pHook-2 (Invitrogen, NVLeek, Netherlands) controlled by a cytomegalovirus promoter. The plasmids that encoded the ets-1 (15Wasylyk C. Kerckaert J.-P. Wasylyk B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 965-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 26Wasylyk C. Maira S.-M. Sobieszczuk P. Wasylyk B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3665-3673PubMed Google Scholar) and ets-2 (Δ1–328) (Δ23; Ref. 27Aperio C. Pognonec P. Stanley E.R. Boulukos K.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6851-6858Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) dominant negative mutants were constructed with polymerase chain reaction fragments that were designed to code the DNA binding domain. To appropriately translate the ets-1 dominant negative mutant, the sense primer contained a consensus AUG initiation codon (TableI; ND-ets-1-N), and the antisense primer was designed to code for the final 441 (corresponding to 485 in p68 ets-1) amino acids of Ets-1 (ND-ets-1-C). The dominant negative ets-1 and ets-2 were also cloned into the Eco RI site of plasmid pCAGGS. The probe of ets-2, erg-1, erg/fli-1 fragment, and full-length cDNA of c-jun (sense, jun-N; antisense, jun-C) were also prepared from a human fetal liver cDNA library (CLONTECH) by the polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide primers (Table I). The polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into the T vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) and confirmed with DNA sequencing (Applied Biosystem, Chiba, Japan). Antisense c-jun was prepared from a clone in which the Pst I fragment (0.6 kilobase) had been cloned in a reverse manner into theEco RI site of plasmid pCAGGS. Various DNA sequence analyses were performed with DNAsis (Version 3.6; Hitachi).Table IOligonucleotides used in cDNA cloningSequence of the oligonucleotideND-ets-1-N5′-ATGACAGGCAGTGGACCAATCCAG-3′ND-ets-1-C5′-TCACTCGTCGGCATCTGGCTTGAC-3′ets-2-N5′-CAAATGATCAAAGAAAACCAAG-3′ets-2-C5′-GTACACGTAGCGCTTCCCCGACG-3′ND-ets-2-N5′-ATGTCTTTCAAGGATTACATCCAA-3′ND-ets-2C5′-TTCCCACTCAGTCCACGAGCCTGG-3′erg-1-N5′-ATGGTGGGCAGCCCAGACACCGTT-3′erg-1-C5′-TTAGTAGTAAGTGCCCAGATGAGA-3′fli-1-N5′-ATGGACGGGACTATTAAGGAGGCT-3′fli-1-C5′-CTAGTAGTAGCTGCCTAAGTGTGA-3′jun-N5′-CCCCCGCTTGCCAGAGCCCTGTTG-3′jun-C5′-GTGCACACTGGGGGCGCCGTCAGA-3′ Open table in a new tab Total cellular RNAs were extracted from cancer cell lines according to the method reported by Chomczynski and Sacchi (28Chomczynski P.

After blotting onto a Zeta probe (Bio-Rad) nylon membrane, the filter was hybridized with 32P-labeled human ets-1 (22Kang R. Saito H. Ihara Y. Miyoshi E. Koyama N. Sheng Y. Taniguchi N. J. Biol.

The membrane filter was washed with 2× standard saline-citrate, pH 7.4, and 0.1% SDS twice for 10 min each at 55 °C and then washed with 2× standard saline citrate, pH 7.4, and 0.1% SDS for 30 min. The filter was then exposed to x-ray films (Kodak, Kyoto, Japan) with an intensified screen at −80 °C for 1 day. Various cancer cells were plated at 1.7 × 105 cells/60-mm dish 1 day before transfection. 10 μg each of ets-1 and the ets-2 expression vectors were introduced into the cells using a LipofectAMINE reagent (Takara, Shiga, Japan). To determine the efficiency of transfection, pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH), which expresses the bacterial green fluorescence protein, was used as a control plasmid. Briefly, 10 μg of DNA and 20 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent were mixed with serum-free medium to form a DNA-liposome complex. After incubation for 20 min, 1 ml of media was overlaid on the pre-rinsed cells. The cells were incubated with the complex for 4 h, and the complex removed by washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. After incubation for 48 h, the cells were used for further analysis. Approximately 1 × 107cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, followed by lysis with Nonidet P-40 buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.8) containing 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol (8 μg/ml), 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40). After centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, nuclear protein was extracted from the pellet with 50 mmHEPES buffer, pH 7.8, containing 420 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 25% glycerol. 10 μg of the nuclear proteins were boiled for 3 min in a sample buffer containing 0.125 mTris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schüll). Nonspecific binding sites on the filter were blocked by incubating the membrane in TBS-T supplemented with 5% skim milk. The filters were then probed with a primary rabbit antibody to Ets-1 (N-276; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Ets-2 (C-20) for 2 h at room temperature. The blots were washed with TBS-T for 30 min and then incubated with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature. After washing for 30 min, the membranes were developed using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Nuclei were isolated from cultured cells as described above. Extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of the resulting supernatants were frozen at −70 °C. The protein concentration of the nuclear extract was measured using a BCA kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. These nuclear proteins were used for the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The DNA fragment containing the putative ets binding sequences of the upstream regulation regions of GnT-V was synthesized as described in Table II. Complementary oligonucleotides were annealed and used as probes or competitors. The probes were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara, Osaka, Japan). For the gel mobility shift assay, DNA (10,000 cpm; labeled with32P) and 5 μg of nuclear proteins were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with 400 ng of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma) in 20 μl of binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 65 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol). For the competition assay, the unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides were preincubated with nuclear proteins 10 min before the addition of labeled oligonucleotide. For the supershift assays, anti-Ets-1 (N-276, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-Ets-2 (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies were added to the reaction mixture, which was then incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were loaded onto 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, 0.25× TAE (1× TAE = 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1.1 mm EDTA, and 37 mm sodium acetate) containing 2.5% glycerol, and then electrophoresis was then carried out at 4 °C at 100 V for 1 h. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried with a gel dryer and exposed to x-ray films (Kodak).Table IIOligonucleotides used in electrophoretic mobility shift assayNameSequencePositionEt-B5′-GCTGCTTGAGGAAGTATAAGAAT-3′Consensus ets-1 bindingE7285′-ATGGGGCAGAGGACTTACGTTAT-3′−741 to −718mE7285′-ATGGGGCAGAGTACTTACGTTAT-3′−741 to −718EJ5655′-CTTGTTAAAGGATAGGCTGTGGACCACATCTCCTCAGTTGCTGATTCAGTGGGTGT-3′−578 to −522mJ5655′-CTTGTTAAAGGATAGGCTGTGGACCACATCTCCTCAGTTGCTGATTTGGTGGGTGT-3′−578 to −522The ets-1 consensus sequence and putative ets-1 binding site, AP-1 sites, and their mutants are underlined.

Open table in a new tab The ets-1 consensus sequence and putative ets-1 binding site, AP-1 sites, and their mutants are underlined. Nucleotides are numbered according to the sequence of the 5′ flanking region of the humanGnT-V gene. According to the diagram of the GnT-V promoter region (Fig. 1) and the results of our previous study (22Kang R. Saito H. Ihara Y. Miyoshi E. Koyama N. Sheng Y. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26706-26712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), Ets-1 might be expected to have a high potential for influencing GnT-V expression. To examine the relationships between ets-1 and GnT-V expression at mRNA levels, Northern blot analysis was performed on various cancer cell lines using ets-1, GnT-V, ets-2, erg, and fli-1 cDNAs as probes (Fig.2). Kato-III, HepG2, Huh7, Colo201, Colo205, and B16-F1 cells showed higher levels of ets-1 expression than the other cells. The expression of GnT-V mRNA showed a pattern similar to that for ets-1 expression. In contrast, A549, Lu65A, Lu99B, MKN45, PacaII, MB231, Huh6, Hep3B, and AH66tc cells showed lower levels of both GnT-V and ets-1 mRNA expression. The expression levels of GnT-V and ets-1 mRNAs, as quantitated by densitometry, were plotted (Fig. 2). A positive correlation was found between these mRNAs expressed in cancer cell lines (r = 0.97;p < 0.0001), suggesting that the control ofGnT-V gene expression by Ets-1 is widely distributed in a variety of cell lines. Expression of ets-2 was positively correlated with GnT-V expression in some cells such as HepG2, Huh7, Colo205, and Kato-III cells. However, in the case of A172, Colo201, B16-F1, and MB231 cells, no correlations were observed between ets-2 and GnT-V expression. Another protein of the ets family, erg showed a low level of expression in various cell lines and did not correlate with GnT-V expression. The expression of fli-1, which is known to be 98% homologous to erg (32Wasylyk B. Hagman J. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 213-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), showed a pattern that was very similar to erg (data not shown). Whereas the cDNA sequence homology of ets-1 among human, mouse, and rat is in excess of 90%, cDNA of the ets-2 coding region between human and mouse was less than 70% homologous. In the B16-F1 cell line, low levels of ets-2 could be due to its low sequence homology. A high level of expression of ets-2, as well as GnT-V and ets-1, was observed in Kato-III, HepG2, Huh7, and Colo205 cells, suggesting that Ets-2 could also regulate gene expression of GnT-V in these cells. Whereas MKN45 cells expressed low levels of GnT-V and ets-1, the expression of ets-2 was quite high. To investigate the expression of Ets-1 and Ets-2 at the protein level, Western blot analysis was performed using A549, B16-F1, HepG2, Huh7, Kato-III, and MKN45 cells (Fig. 3). A high level of expression of Ets-1 and Ets-2 was observed in HepG2, Huh7, and Kato-III cells. In contrast, their expression was quite low in A549 cells, but a high expression of Ets-2 was observed in MKN45 cells. These results were consistent with the mRNA expression levels. To determine whether the expression of GnT-V is dependent on Ets-1 protein, nuclear extracts from the MKN45, HepG2, and Colo201 cell lines were subjected to an EMSA analysis. EMSA was performed using the 24-base pair GnT-V promoter-derived oligonucleotide E728 (−741/−718) (22Kang R. Saito H. Ihara Y. Miyoshi E. Koyama N. Sheng Y. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26706-26712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), which has been shown to have moderate binding affinity among three ets binding sites, which are located in the 5′-untranslated regions of the GnT-V gene. As shown in Fig.4, when the radiolabeled Et-B, E728 oligonucleotides were incubated with nuclear extracts prepared from MKN45, HepG2, and Colo201, retarded protein-DNA complexes were detected (lanes 1 and 2 ). The intensities of the complexes of HepG2 and Colo201 were higher than that of MKN45. Specificity of binding was identified with a mutant oligonucleotide (mE728; Fig. 4,lane 3 ). To confirm ets antibody-specific binding, the supershift assay was performed by means of the addition of anti-Ets-1 and anti-Ets-2. Whereas both antibodies were shown to supershift in the HepG2 cells, a supershifted band by the Ets-2 antibody was clearer than that of the Ets-1 antibody in MKN45 cells. The supershifted band by Ets-1 and Ets-2 was a competitive pattern in Colo201 cells (Fig. 4,lanes 4 and 5 ). This is because Colo201 cells are not adhering cells like HepG2 and MKN45 cells, and the amounts of nuclear proteins in 5 μg of proteins applied on EMSA might be relatively small as compared with the others. As a result, its supershift might appear as a competitive pattern. Collectively, these results strongly reflect the importance of Ets-1 and Ets-2 in GnT-V expression in each cell. To investigate the cooperative trans -activation of c-Jun on the GnT-V promoter through the c-Jun binding element (AP-1) and the ets binding element, we first performed a Northern blot analysis in various cancer cell lines. The expression of c-jun mRNA was observed in nearly all cells (Fig. 5) and was not correlated with GnT-V expression. To directly investigate the cooperation of AP-1 and ets binding elements in GnT-V expression, an EMSA was performed using the 58-base pair GnT-V promoter-derived oligonucleotide EJ565 (−578/−522), which contains the ets and AP-1 sites (Table II). When the radiolabeled EJ565 oligonucleotide was incubated with nuclear extracts prepared from HepG2, protein-DNA complexes were retarded (Fig.6, lane 1 ). The radiolabeled mJ565, which contained a mutant AP-1 site and was designed to detect the specificity of the AP-1 site, was incubated with nuclear extracts. The level of a retarded protein-DNA complex pattern was the same as when EJ565 was used (Fig. 6, lane 2 ). ets-specific binding was confirmed using competition analysis and the supershift assay. Levels of retarded protein-DNA complex were decreased during an incubation with unlabeled EJ565 (Fig. 6, lane 3 ), and the bands were supershifted during incubation with anti-Ets-1 in the case of both EJ565 and mJ565 (Fig. 6, lanes 4 and 5 ). These results indicate that the DNA-protein complex with E565 nucleotide is dependent on ets binding, but not on AP-1. To further confirm that AP-1 and the Ets-1 site do not cooperate, antisense c-jun was transfected to A549 and PacaII cells. Although these cells expressed low levels of both ets-1 and GnT-V (Fig. 2), the transfection of a vector alone (mock transfectant) to these cells brought a slight enhancement of GnT-V mRNA expression (Fig.7). This result was reproduced in three separate experiments. When antisense c-jun was transfected into cells, GnT-V mRNA expression was unchanged (data not shown), suggesting that c-Jun could not be linked to GnT-V expression. To determine whether GnT-V mRNA expression is controlled by the overexpression of ets-1, two types of Ets-1-expressing vectors were transiently transfected into A549, MKN45, and PacaII cells, which were shown to express low levels of both ets-1 and GnT-V (Fig. 2). The transfection efficiency was about 15–20% of the total cell numbers, as judged by fluorescence microscopy (data not shown). Although intrinsic GnT-V expression was quite low, as shown in Fig. 2, the transfection of a vector alone (mock transfectant) slightly enhanced the expression of GnT-V mRNA (Fig. 7). This enhancement was very reproducible, but the details of its mechanism are presently unknown. When ets-1 was transfected into A549 and PacaII cells that expressed low levels of Ets-1, the expression of GnT-V was increased in comparison with control or mock-transfected cells (Fig. 7). In the case of MKN45, however, the level of GnT-V expression was not increased by ets-1 transfection, suggesting that Ets-1 is not sufficient forGnT-V gene expression in MKN45 cells. To demonstrate the enhancement of GnT-V by Ets-1 proteins by a different approach, the action of Ets-1 was inhibited by the transfection of dominant negative ets-1 in Kato-III and B16-F1 cells, which showed high levels of intrinsic ets-1 and GnT-V expression. It has been reported that the dominant negative mutant containing the DNA-binding domain of ets-1 (N70) specifically inhibits both ras stimulation and the constitutive α-domain activity of Ets-1 (26Wasylyk C. Maira S.-M. Sobieszczuk P. Wasylyk B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3665-3673PubMed Google Scholar). When the dominant negative mutant of ets-1 was transfected into Kato-III and B16-F1 cells, the expression of GnT-V was decreased in comparison with a mock transfectant, suggesting that Ets-1 regulates GnT-V expression in these two cell lines (Fig.8). To determine whether GnT-V mRNA expression is controlled by Ets-2, ets-2- or dominant negative ets-2-expressing vector was transiently transfected into A549, MKN45, PacaII, Kato-III, and B16-F1 cells, respectively. The transfection efficiency was about 15–20% of the total cell numbers, as judged by cotransfection of a GFP-producing vector, followed by fluorescence microscopy (data not shown). When ets-2 was transfected into A549 and PacaII cells that expressed low levels of ets-2, the expression of GnT-V was not changed in comparison with control or mock-transfected cells (Fig.9). In contrast, whereas the level of GnT-V expression in MKN45 cells was not increased by ets-2 transfection, transfection of a dominant negative ets-2 suppressed GnT-V mRNA at the 40% levels of GnT-V expression in mock transfectants. This suggests that Ets-2 regulates gene expression of GnT-V in MKN45 cells. When the dominant negative mutant of ets-2 was transfected into Kato-III and B16-F1 cells, the expression of GnT-V was not changed, suggesting that ets-1 is a key factor for the control of GnT-V expression in these cells (Fig. 9). Transfection of ets-2 into Kato-III cells induced increases in the expression of urokinase plasminogen activator mRNA (data not shown). The present study demonstrated that GnT-V expression is regulated by Ets-1 in many different cancer cells. This evidence provides a possible new pathway of tumor metastasis via the up-regulation of GnT-V by Ets-1. As shown in Fig. 1, three ets binding sites and one AP-1 site are located in the 5′ flanking region of the GnT-V gene. It is already known that ets cooperates with AP-1 in the transcriptional regulation of genes such as interleukin 2, collagenase, and tumor necrosis factor. However, this was not observed in the regulation of the GnT-V gene by Ets-1 (Figs. 5 and 6). Expression of c-jun was not correlated with GnT-V levels, and antisense c-jun did not change the level of GnT-V expression. Although other ets family proteins are able to bind to these ets binding sites, GnT-V expression was correlated most with ets-1 expression. Correlations between GnT-V and Ets-2 were not so high compared with Ets-1. Fig. 9 showed the noninvolvement of Ets-2 in GnT-V expression in Kato-III and B16-F1 cells. However, in MKN45 cells, Ets-2 protein is a key factor in gene regulation of GnT-V because a dominant negative of ets-2 suppressed GnT-V expression (Fig. 9), and overexpression of ets-1 showed no effects on GnT-V expression (Fig. 7). Thus, gene expression of GnT-V is regulated in a cell type-specific manner, although Ets-1 contributes to GnT-V gene regulation in a variety of cancer cell lines. Although an ets-2 dominant negative mutant contains a sequence that is similar to the DNA-binding domain of ets-1, it was not able to inhibit GnT-V expression, as did the ets-1 dominant negative mutant (Fig. 8). A similar phenomenon was reported in which the dominant negative mutant of ets-2 was unable to suppress ras stimulation and the constitutive α-domain activity as Ets-1 did (26Wasylyk C. Maira S.-M. Sobieszczuk P. Wasylyk B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3665-3673PubMed Google Scholar). A similar correlation between the expression levels of ets-1 and GnT-V was observed in 12 human hepatoma tissues (data not shown), suggesting that Ets-1 regulates the expression of GnT-V in vivo . The mechanism of tumor metastasis is complicated and is not fully understood at present. The ets family has been reported to be involved in tumor metastasis through angiogenesis and the enhancement of expression of metalloproteinase or collagenase (33Kaya M. Yoshida K. Higashino F. Mitaka T. Ishii S. Fujinaga K. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 221-227PubMed Google Scholar, 34Gutman A. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2241-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been suggested that the increased expression of GnT-V is associated with metastasis and the invasion of tumor cells. Therefore, Ets-1 would be expected to promote tumor metastasis not only via angiogenesis and the expression of metalloproteinase, but also through enhancing the expression of GnT-V. Moreover, because changes ofN -linked oligosaccharide structures in tumor cells are associated with the expression of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase I (35Korczak B. Dennis J.W. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 53: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the enhancement of GnT-V expression by ets-1 would be expected to participate in the regulation of metalloproteinase activity. These considerations are consistent with the suggestion that Ets-1 contributes to the malignancy potential of tumor cells via an increase in the expression of GnT-V, which, in turn, leads to alteration of N -linked oligosaccharides in tumor cells. It has been reported that stromal fibroblasts adjacent to tumor cells may express Ets-1 in response to tumor invasion (20Wernert N. Gilles F. Fafeur V. Bouali F. Raes M.-B. Pyke C. Dupressoir T. Seitz G. Vandenbunder B. Stehelin D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5683-5688PubMed Google Scholar); thus, it is uncertain whether the high expression levels of ets-1 and GnT-V detected in human hepatoma tissues were derived from hepatoma cells. However, our analyses of a variety of cancer cells, including hepatoma cells, indicate that many of the cancer cells investigated in the present study expressed Ets-1. It was recently reported that the use of antisense oligonucleotide for ets-1 is one of the strategies by which tumor growth is suppressed through the inhibition of angiogenesis (36Chen Z. Fisher R.J. Riggs C.W. Rhim J.S. Lautenberger J.A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2013-2019PubMed Google Scholar). This latter report also indicated that Ets-1 controls not only tumor angiogenesis but also normal vascular development. The issue of whether GnT-V plays a role in these vascular developments involving Ets-1 is not known and remains to be examined. We also indicated that the impairment of the action of GnT-V by transfection of GnT-III, the product of which prevents the addition of a β1–6 GlcNAc residue, dramatically suppresses lung metastasis of mouse melanoma cells that express high levels of GnT-V (11Yoshimura M. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Taniguchi S. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8754-8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). This clearly suggests that a β1–6 branch of anN -glycan is involved in tumor metastasis. Therefore, it can be concluded that the pathophysiological significance of Ets-1 in malignancy potential such as tumor metastasis can be ascribed to the increased expression of GnT-V. The prevention of the action of GnT-V as well as Ets-1 would provide new insights into cancer therapy. We are grateful for the expert technical assistance and suggestion of Ayako Okado."

The present study shows that the induction of type II-sPLA2gene by interleukin-1β requires activation of the NFκB pathway and cytosolic PLA2/PPARγ pathway, which are both necessary to achieve the transcriptional process. Interleukin-1β induced type II-sPLA2 gene dose- and time-dependently and increased the binding of NFκB to a specific site of type II-sPLA2 promoter. This effect was abolished by proteinase inhibitors that block the proteasome machinery and NFκB nuclear translocation. Type II-sPLA2 induction was also obtained by free arachidonic acid and was blocked by either AACOCF3, a specific cytosolic-PLA2 inhibitor, PD98059, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor which prevents cytosolic PLA2 activation, or nordihydroguaiaretic acid, a lipoxygenase inhibitor, but not by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin, suggesting a role for a lipoxygenase product. Type II-sPLA2 induction was obtained after treatment of the cells by 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-dehydroprostaglandin J2, carbaprostacyclin, and 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, which are ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ, whereas PPARα ligands were ineffective. Interleukin-1β as well as PPARγ-ligands stimulated the activity of a reporter gene containing PPARγ-binding sites in its promoter. Binding of both NFκB and PPARγ to their promoter is required to stimulate the transcriptional process since inhibitors of each class block interleukin-1β-induced type II-sPLA2 gene activation. We therefore suggest that NFκB and PPARγ cooperate at the enhanceosome-coactivator level to turn on transcription of the proinflammatory type II-sPLA2 gene.

These cells are involved in major pathological conditions such as septic shock, neointima formation, and restenosis after acute vascular injury or chronic pathological processes such as atherosclerosis. During severe infection, activation of inflammatory cells leads to the massive release of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β)1and tumor necrosis factor-α (1Shapiro L. Gelfand J.A. New Horizons. 1993; 1: 13-22PubMed Google Scholar). During the onset of atherosclerosis, vascular smooth muscle cells undergo phenotypic changes switching from a contractile phenotype to a proliferating and secretory phenotype. Early atherosclerotic lesions have many characteristics in common with the inflammatory reaction (2Ross R. Masuda J. Raines E.W. Gown A.M. Katsuda S. Sasahara M. Malden L.T. Masuko H. Sato H. Science. 1990; 248: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), and vascular smooth muscle cells participate in the local inflammatory process involved in the development of lesions and neointimal formation (3Nilsson J. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 1184-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). IL-1β is thought to play an important role in this process since vascular smooth muscle cells express IL-1β receptors (4French J.F. Schroëder K.K. Akeson A.L. Dage R.C. Bowlin T.L. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 233: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vascular smooth muscle cells, IL-1β induces expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (5Braun M. Pietsch P. Zepp A. Schror K. Baumann G. Felix S.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2568-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and IL-1β itself (6Libby P. Ordovas J.M. Birinyi L.K. Auger K.R. Dinarello C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1432-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). IL-1β also stimulates extracellular matrix production by human smooth muscle cells (7Forsyth E.A. Aly H.M. Neville R.F. Sidawy A.N. J. Vasc. Surg. 1997; 26: 1002-1007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Type II secreted phospholipase A2 (type II-sPLA2) has been implicated in the pathophysiological processes of sepsis syndrome as well as atherosclerosis. High levels of type II-sPLA2 have been found in the plasma of patients with septic shock (8Vadas P. Scott K. Smith G. Rajkovic I. Stefanski E. Scouten B.D. Singh R. Pruzanski W. Life Sci. 1992; 50: 807-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, high levels of this enzyme have been demonstrated in the aorta of endotoxin shock rats (9Nakano T. Arita H. FEBS Lett. 1990; 273: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Type II-sPLA2 has been evidenced in human atherosclerotic plaques (10Menschikowski M. Kasper M. Lattke M. Schiering A. Schiefer S. Stockinger H. Jaross W. Atherosclerosis. 1995; 118: 173-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A strong type II-sPLA2 immunoreactivity colocalized with α-actin-positive vascular smooth muscle cells in both normal and atherosclerotic arteries (11Romano M. Romano E. Björkerud S. Hurt-Camejo E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that type II-sPLA2 could play an important role in early atherosclerosis because it is present in the pre-atherosclerotic arterial wall, where it may induce low density lipoprotein modification (12Neuzil J. Upston J.M. Witting P.K. Scott K.F. Stocker R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9203-9210Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and foam cell formation (13Elinder L.S. Dumitrescu A. Larsson P. Hedin U. Frostegard J. Claesson H.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2257-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The precise physiological substrate of type II-sPLA2 is still conjectural. Although only indirect evidence has been published to indicate that type II-sPLA2 can hydrolyze mammalian cell phospholipids in vivo to generate lipid mediators (14Pfeilschifter J. Shalkwijk C. Briner V.A. van den Bosch H. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2516-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 15Jacques C. Béréziat G. Humbert L. Olivier J.L. Corvol M.-T. Masliah J. Berenbaum F.

Cell. 1995; 80: 919-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), and is inhibited by sphingomyelin, an important component of the outer leaflet of plasma cell membranes (18Koumanov K. Wolf C. Béréziat G. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation is implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and restenosis following interventional revascularization procedures (19Ross R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Several phospholipase A2-derived mediators in addition to lysophosphatidic acid are thought to be involved in smooth muscle cell proliferation, i.e. lysophosphatidylcholine (20Chai Y.C. Howe P.H. DiCorleto P.E. Chisolm G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17791-17797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), cyclooxygenase, and lipoxygenase products (21Brinkman H.J. van Buul-Wortelboer M.F. van Mourik J.A.

Hirose T. Hirose W. Suzuki K. Kawakami M. Kawagoe M. Nakamura H. Autoimmunity. 1990; 7: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). IL-1β induces the synthesis and secretion of type II-sPLA2 in various cell types (14Pfeilschifter J. Shalkwijk C. Briner V.A. van den Bosch H. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2516-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 15Jacques C. Béréziat G. Humbert L. Olivier J.L. Corvol M.-T. Masliah J. Berenbaum F. J. Clin.

FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), but the precise signaling leading to type II-sPLA2 gene expression remains to be elucidated. In most cells, IL-1β triggers its action by at least two main pathways involving specific receptors. IL-1β activates acid sphingomyelinase to initiate the ceramide cascade (25Ballou L.R. Chao C.P. Holness M.A. Barker S.C. Raghow R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20044-20050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IL-1β also induces signaling cascades which activate members of the nuclear transcription factor κB (NFκB) family in smooth muscle cells (26Spink J. Cohen J. Evans T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29541-29547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). NFκB activation has also been evidenced in vascular smooth muscle cells after rat arterial injury (27Landry D.B. Couper L.L. Bryant S.R. Lindner V. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1085-1095PubMed Google Scholar) or in human arteriosclerosis (28Bourcier T. Sukhova G. Libby P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15817-15824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In arterial smooth muscle cells, IL-1β-induced type II-sPLA2 gene expression can therefore be expected to involve either the ceramide pathway or the NFκB pathway. In most cells, NFκB is retained in the cytoplasm by inhibitory proteins called IκBs. Signaling events that phosphorylate IκBs promote its degradation by the proteosome pathway and the subsequent nuclear translocation and activation of NFκB family members (29Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). A cytokine-responsive IκB kinase has been described (30DiDonado J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar), but the actual pathway by which IL-1β might induce phosphorylation of IκBs is still unknown. Recently, cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), an enzyme completely unrelated to type II-sPLA2 (31Dennis E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), has been implicated in IL-1β-mediated type II-sPLA2 gene induction in rat fibroblasts (32Kuwata H. Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1733-1740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility of a control of type II-sPLA2 gene by free fatty acids or their derivatives via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). PPARs are key players in lipid metabolism and are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors that regulate the pattern of gene expression in response to the binding of low molecular weight ligands (33Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. et al.Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6110) Google Scholar). Three different subtypes have been described, PPARα, PPARβ/δ, and γ. Although the identities of the ligands that regulate in vivo activity remain to be established with certainty, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2(15-dPGJ2) (34Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P.

Both PPARα and PPARγ are present in smooth muscle cells (37Staels B. Koenig W. Habib A. Merval R. Lebret M. Pineda Torra I. Delerive P. Fadel A. Chinetti G. Fruchart J.C. Najib J. Maclouf J.

In the present paper, we demonstrate that, in rat vascular smooth muscle cells, IL-1β induces type II-sPLA2 gene via the NFκB pathway but not via the ceramide pathway. It can be mimicked by arachidonic acid as well as PPARγ agonists and blocked by cPLA2 inhibitors and therefore involves the cPLA2-PPARγ pathway. In addition, nuclear translocation of NFκB is required for the stimulation by PPARγ agonists, suggesting that both NFκB and PPARγ are required to mediate the IL-1β effect.

LipofectAMINE was from Life Technologies, Inc.; the pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid was from CLONTECH Laboratories, and the luciferase reporter assay kit was from Promega, France. Vascular smooth muscle cells were isolated by enzymatic digestion of thoracic aortic media from male Wistar rats (300 g, Elevage Janvier) according to the method of Michel and co-workers (41Battle T. Arnal J.F. Challah M. Michel J.-B. Tissue & Cell. 1994; 26: 943-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The cells were seeded on dishes coated with type I collagen from calf skin and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The purity of the smooth muscle cell preparation was evaluated by staining the cells with monoclonal antibodies to smooth muscle cell α-actin. More than 96% of cells revealed immunoreactivity. Smooth muscle cells were subcultured every 7 days, and experiments were performed on cells at three to six passages after primary culture. After confluence of the cells, quiescent mode was induced by incubation for 24 h in serum-free medium and then incubated with the same medium containing 0.2% free fatty acid bovine serum albumin and appropriate agents as described in the figure legends. At the end of incubation, the medium was removed for use in the phospholipase A2 assay, and the cells were treated for RT-PCR analysis, protein determinations, or nuclear extract preparations. Total RNA was extracted according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (42Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar), and 1.5 μg was used as template for the reverse transcription (RT) reaction. First strand cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcription reaction with murine mammary lentivirus reverse transcriptase and random primers. For semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) determinations, sPLA2cDNA was coamplified with GAPDH cDNA as an internal control, and the linear amplification was determined for each experiment (currently 20–24 cycles). The primers were synthesized according to published sequences for rat sPLA2 cDNA (43Kusunoki C. Satoh S. Kobayashi M. Niwa M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1087: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) corresponding to nucleotides 155–438 from start codon and rat GAPDH cDNA (44Tso J.Y. Sun X.H. Kao T.H. Reece K.S. Wu R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2485-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar) corresponding to nucleotides 305–499 from start codon. The primers used for type II-sPLA2 were GTG GCA GAG GAT CCC CCA AGG (CS 10, forward) and GCA ACT GGG CGT GTT CCC TCT GCA (CS 11, reverse), and those used for GAPDH were CCA TGG AGA AGG CTG GGG (GS, forward) and CAA AGT TGT CAT GGA TGA CC (GAS, reverse). The following conditions were chosen as standard conditions for PCR reactions in a volume of 25 μl: 2.5 μl of cDNA template generated from RT reactions, 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase, 20–24 cycles of amplification in the presence of 160 nm CS 10 and CS 11 primers, 120 nm GS and GAS primers. PCR amplifications were performed using a thermocycler (Hybaid Omnigene) as follows: a denaturation step 3 min at 95 °C and then subsequent cycles of PCR using the following conditions: denaturation 1 min at 95 °C, annealing 1 min at 64 °C, extension 1 min at 72 °C. A final extension for 4 min at 72 °C was then performed. The PCR products (5 μl each sample) were electrophoresed using 2% agarose gel, blotted, and fixed onto a Hybond N+ nylon membrane. The identity of amplified cDNA products was confirmed by hybridization with 5′-CAA CCG TCT GGA GAA ACG TGG ATG TGG CAC-3′ (nucleotides 216–245 from ATG) for sPLA2 and 5′-GTG AAC CAC GAG AAA TAT GAC AAC TCC CTC-3′ (nucleotides 397–426 from ATG) for GAPDH. The oligonucleotide probes were labeled using ECL direct nucleic acid labeling system. After hybridization, membranes were washed, revealed using ECL reagents kit for horseradish peroxidase, and autoradiographed. Phospholipase A2 activity was measured using a selective fluorometric assay as described by Pernas et al . (45Pernas P. Masliah J. Olivier J.L. Salvat C. Rybkine T. Béréziat G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 1298-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The activity secreted into the medium was assayed on 400-μl samples using 4 nmol of fluorescent substrate 1-hexadecanoyl-2-(1-pyrenyldecanoyl)-sn- glycero-3-phosphoglycerol. Total hydrolysis of the substrate obtained by 0.1 unit of phospholipase A2 from N. mossambica was used as a reference to calculate phospholipase A2 activity of the samples. Spontaneous hydrolysis of the substrate was assayed in the presence of fresh culture medium and subtracted. Nuclear extracts were prepared from smooth muscle cells by the method of Dignam et al. (46Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. After washing in 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were harvested and centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of buffer A (5 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysates were maintained for 10 min on ice and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min. The nuclear pellet was then resuspended in 100 μl of buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin). After 30 min at 4 °C, nuclear debris was removed by centrifugation at 45,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant (nuclear extract) was distributed into 15-μl aliquots that were stored at −80 °C until analysis by EMSA. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry modified by Peterson (47Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7141) Google Scholar). The κB double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponded to either a, NFκB-binding site consensus sequence (48Lenardo M.J. Fan C.M. Maniatis T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 287-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) 5′-GGG ACA GAG GGG ACT TTC CGA GAG G-3′ (NFκB consensus) or the sequence 5′-GTA TGA GGG CTT TTC CCT CGC CCT-3′ (NFκB sPLA2) corresponding to the region (−194, −174) of the rat type II-sPLA2 promoter described by Walker et al. (49Walker G. Kunz D. Pignat W. van den Bosch H. Pfeilschifter J Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The PPRE double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponded to a PPAR-binding site consensus sequence from acyl-CoA oxidase gene 5′-GGG AAC GTG ACC TTT GTC CTG GTC CC-3′ (PPRE consensus) (50Juge-Aubry C.

They were annealed and end-labeled using the T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of 50 μCi of [γ-32P]dATP. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using G-50 filtration. Binding reactions were carried out in a 20-μl binding reaction mixture (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA) containing 7 μg of nuclear proteins and 50,000 cpm labeled (approximately 1 ng) with either the NFκB probe or the PPRE probe. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 15 min and fractionated by electrophoresis on 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA), after pre-electrophoresis for 30 min at 180 V. Gels were run at 180 V for 3 h and then transferred to 3MM paper (Whatman), dried in a gel dryer under vaccum at 80 °C, and then exposed to Amersham Pharmacia Biotech x-ray film. To determine the specificity of the DNA protein complexes, competition assays were performed using a 100-fold molar excess of an unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to each of the probes (specific inhibitors) or a 100-fold molar excess of a double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to an AP1-binding site consensus sequence (52Bos T.J. Bohmann D. Tsuchie H. Tjian R. Vogt P.K. Cell. 1988; 52: 705-712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), 5′-GGG AGC CGC AAG TGA GTC AGC GCG GGG CTG GTG CA-3′ (nonspecific competitor). Twenty four hours before transfection, cultured rat smooth muscle cells were seeded at a concentration achieving 70% confluence in 6-well dishes. Smooth muscle cells were cotransfected using 4 μl of LipofectAMINE, 800 ng of a plasmid construct containing the (PPRE consensus)×2 thymidine kinase promoter region fused to luciferase reporter gene (kindly provided by Walter Wahli) and 200 ng of pCMV-β-galactosidase per well (as a control of transfection efficiency). The reaction was carried out as recommended by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). On the day after transfection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently cultured for 24 h in serum-free medium and incubated for 24 h in the same medium containing appropriate agents, as indicated in the figure legends. The β-galactosidase activity in cell extracts was determined by an enzymatic assay with orthonitrophenyl phosphate as substrate. The luciferase activity was measured with a luciferase reporter assay kit, with detection of the signal for 12 s by a luminometer (Berthold, Inc.) The non-esterified fatty acids were extracted and analyzed after methylation with diazomethane and separated by gas chromatography on a capillary column of Supelcowax-10 (Supelco)-bonded phase (diameter 0.32 mm, length 30 m) in a Hewlett-Packard 5890 Series II gas chromatograph as already described (18Koumanov K. Wolf C. Béréziat G. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Fatty acids were detected by mass spectrometry (Nermag 10–10C) in the chemical ionization mode with ammonia (10 kPa) as the reagent gas. The positive quasi-molecular ions were monitored and time-integrated. Quantification was performed with an internal standard of heptadecanoic methyl ester with response factors calculated for the various fatty acid methyl esters with calibrators. The data illustrated in Table I were analyzed statistically using a Student's t test.Table IcPLA2-mediated stimulation by IL-1β of intracellular free unsaturated fatty acidsFatty acidControlIL-1βControl + AACOCF3IL-1β + AACOCF3C18:1 (n − 9)7.08 ± 1.8811.91 ± 0.384.77 ± 0.754.07 ± 0.84C18:2 (n − 6)0.11 ± 0.021.17 ± 0.211-ap < 0.01.0.12 ± 0.020.12 ± 0.01C20:4 (n − 6)0.14 ± 0.050.35 ± 0.131-bp < 0.05.0.18 ± 0.030.18 ± 0.27Cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM for 24 h with or without 10 ng/ml IL-1β in the presence or in the absence of 20 μm AACOCF3.

https://openalex.org/W1965052634,"A family of bacterial transporters, the SET (sugar efflux transporter) family, has been recently reported (Liu, J. Y., Miller, P. F., Gosink, M., and Olson, E. R. (1999) Mol. Microbiol. 31, 1845–1851). In this study, the biochemical and cell biological properties of the three Escherichia coli members (SetA, SetB, and SetC) of the family are characterized. We show that both SetA and SetB can transport lactose and glucose. In addition, SetA has broad substrate specificity, with preferences for glucosides or galactosides with alkyl or aryl substituents. Consistent with the observed in vitro substrate specificities, strains that hyperexpress SetA or SetB are desensitized to lactose analogues as measured by induction of the lac operon. In addition, strains that hyperexpress SetA are resistant to the growth inhibitory sugar analogueo -nitrophenyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. Strains disrupted for any one or all of the set genes are viable and show no defects in lactose utilization nor increased sensitivity to inducers of the lac operon and nonmetabolizable sugar analogues. The data suggest that the set genes are either poorly expressed under normal laboratory growth conditions or are redundant with other cellular gene products.

Members of the Major Facilitator Superfamily perform diverse functions including the uptake of nutrients such as sugars and the secretion of noxious agents, including antibiotics (2Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 575-608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SET proteins were first identified inEscherichia coli , which encodes three members (SetA, SetB, and SetC) that share a high degree (at least 70%) of amino acid sequence similarity (1Liu J.Y. Miller P.F. Gosink M. Olson E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 31: 1845-1851Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Prior to this work, setA, setB , andsetC were given the generic names yabM, yeiO , andyicK , respectively, for E. coli open reading frames of unknown function. It was shown that two of the proteins (SetA and SetB) could catalyze the secretion of lactose (1Liu J.Y. Miller P.F. Gosink M. Olson E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 31: 1845-1851Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Two additional members were identified as open reading frames in Deinococcus radiodurans and Yersinia pestis . A recent examination of the sequenced microbial genomes data base yielded six additional, more distantly related, proteins. 1M. Saier, manuscript in preparation.1M. Saier, manuscript in preparation. At present, the transport properties of these new family members have not been characterized. The SET proteins are not ubiquitously present in bacteria, suggesting an ecologically specialized role for this family of pumps. Sugar efflux has been reported in many bacterial species (4Reizer J. Novotny M.J. Panos C. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 354-361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Reizer J. Saier Jr., M.H. J.

It was shown that sugar efflux is an integral part of the metabolism of lactose in E. col i (7Huber R.E. Hurlburt K.L. Can. J. Microbiol. 1984; 30: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In a strain constitutive for the lac operon, the addition of lactose led to the immediate and stoichiometeric appearance of the products (glucose, galactose, and allolactose) of β-galactosidase action in the medium (6Huber R.E. Pisko Dubienski R. Hurlburt K.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 656-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, mutants defective in the uptake of glucose and galactose grow poorly on lactose as the sole carbon source (7Huber R.E. Hurlburt K.L. Can. J. Microbiol. 1984; 30: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Physiological evidence supports the hypothesis that efflux systems are involved in the detoxification of nonmetabolizable sugars in E. coli (8Wilson T.H. Kashket E.R. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1982; 257: 14543-14552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When glucose is the sole carbon source, growth inhibition by MG is due to both decreased uptake of glucose and interference with the utilization of intracellular glucose-6-phosphate, the latter because of the accumulation of MG and MG-6-phosphate (9Winkler H.H. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 106: 362-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hagihira H. Wilson T.H. Lin E.C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 78: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It was shown that both MG and MG-6-phosphate are secreted from the cell by an uncharacterized mechanism, the latter being first dephosphorylated before secretion (9Winkler H.H. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 106: 362-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hoffee P. Englesberg E. Lamy F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 79: 337-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 12Hagihira H. Wilson T.H. Lin E.C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 78: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Many nonmetabolizable lactose analogues such as isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) and methyl-β-d-thiogalactoside are growth inhibitory when lactose is the only carbon source (10Andrews K.J. Lin E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 128: 510-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These compounds enter the cell through the lactose permease, the product of the lacY gene (14Herzengerg L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 31: 525-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To prevent the accumulation of IPTG and methyl-β-d-thiogalactoside, these sugar analogues are first acetylated by the LacA transacetylase and then secreted from the cell by an unknown transporter (8Wilson T.H. Kashket E.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 173: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 10Andrews K.J. Lin E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 128: 510-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Re-entry into the cell is prevented because the acetylated sugar analogues are not substrates for the permease (8Wilson T.H. Kashket E.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 173: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this report, a role for the SET proteins (SetA, SetB, and SetC) in the metabolism of lactose or the detoxification of nonmetabolizable sugar analogues is investigated. As we show in this study, the range of sugars that are efflux substrates for the E. coli SET proteins include selective monosaccharides and disaccharides, in addition to glycoside analogues such as IPTG. Because lactose and IPTG are both substrates for Set protein-catalyzed efflux, we also generated null mutations in setA , setB , and setC and used these to help define the role of the Set proteins in E. coli sugar metabolism. The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1.

Overnight cultures of strains ML308/pBAD18, ML308/pBAD-SetA, and ML308/pBAD-SetB grown in L broth containing ampicillin were diluted 100-fold into the same medium or medium containing 15 mm arabinose. After 1.6 h of growth, ONPTG, dissolved at 20 times the final concentration in 60% dimethyl sulfoxide, or solvent only, was added to the indicated concentrations. The cultures were grown in a 96-well plate, and growth was followed with a SpectraMax 96-well plate reader (Molecular Devices Corp, Sunnyvale, CA). Cells were grown in L broth with arabinose to an A 600of 0.6–1.0 and harvested for inside-out vesicles, essentially as described previously (16Yamaguchi A. Udagawa T. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4809-4813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the experiments described in Fig. 1(A and C ), the culture was grown in shake flasks. In the experiments described in Fig. 1 (B and D ), the culture was grown in a fermentor with L broth containing ampicillin to an A 600 of 0.6–1.0. Subsequently, arabinose was added to 15 mm, and the culture was harvested 2 h later. Cell pellets were washed once with ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 6.6, 180 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA), resuspended in lysis buffer to anA 600 of 40–80, and lysed in a French Press at 5000 p.s.i. The lysate was centrifuged at 27,000 ×g for 10 min to remove unlysed cells and debris. The supernatant was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 ×g to pellet total membranes. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The transport assay was performed at 21 °C. A 1.5-μl solution of 50 mm ATP, pH 7.0, 50 mm MgSO4 was added to 13.5 μl of a suspension of membrane vesicles (14.0 μg protein/ml) followed by incubation at 21 °C for 30 s. Transport was initiated by the addition of 60 μl of Buffer A (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgSO4, 192 mm NaCl) containing the labeled sugar ([14C]lactose: 0.181 mm, 55.0 mCi/mmol, or [14C]glucose: 0.57 mm, 8.36 mCi/mmol). At the specified times, the entire solution was mixed with 3 ml of ice-cold stop buffer (50 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.5, 180 mm LiCl) followed by filtration through Whatman glass fiber filters. The filters were washed twice with 3 ml of the same buffer, and radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. For the CCCP-treated samples, CCCP was added to 80 μm at the indicated time after the initiation of transport and allowed to incubate further before stopping the assay with stop buffer. For the kinetic studies of SetA catalyzed [14C]lactose transport, the stock [14C]lactose solution was diluted with unlabeled lactose so that the final concentrations in the assay were 0.33, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 mm. In the assay for inhibitors of SetA catalyzed transport of [14C]lactose, Buffer A contained the tested inhibitor at 31.25 mm and [14C]lactose at 0.181 mm (55.0 mCi/mmol). The final concentrations of the test compound and lactose were 25 and 0.145 mm, respectively. Log phase cultures (A 600 = 0.2–0.4) were grown at the indicated concentration of IPTG or lactose for 1 h. Subsequently, β-galactosidase activity in the culture was determined as described (17Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). To follow the kinetics of IPTG induction of the lac operon, IPTG was added to early log phase cultures (A 600 = 0.1) to final concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0 μm. At the indicated times, samples of the culture were removed and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Gradient plates were prepared by the method described previously (18Gambino L. Gracheck S.J. Miller P.F. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2888-2894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: 15 μg/ml kanamycin, 15 μg/ml neomycin, 0.008 μg/ml ciprofloxacin. The quantitative assay for glucose is essentially that described previously (6Huber R.E. Pisko Dubienski R. Hurlburt K.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 656-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Log phase cells growing in M63 with 0.2% glycerol (6Huber R.E. Pisko Dubienski R. Hurlburt K.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 656-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) were pelleted and washed once with buffer containing 0.1 mNaPO4, 1.0 mm MgSO4, pH 7.6. Cells were resuspended in assay buffer (0.1 m NaPO4, 7.0 mm MgSO4, 6.0 mm ATP, 0.3 units/ml hexokinase, 2.5 μg/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 0.5 mg/ml NADP+, pH 7.6) to an A 600 of 0.25. The assay was initiated by the addition of lactose to 1.0 mm, and the absorbance at 340 nm was followed. To inhibit lactose uptake by LacY, cells were preincubated in assay buffer with CCCP at 60 μm for 3.0 min before the addition of lactose. The glucose efflux activity was normalized to the β-galactosidase activity (17Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar) in the solution. The disruption markers (19Fellay R. Frey J. Krisch H. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), referred to as interposons (denoted by the symbol Ω), which conferred resistance to streptomycin, chloramphenicol, or tetracycline, were inserted into setA (at Msc I), setB (atBsg I), and setC (at Bsg I), respectively, which were cloned in pBAD18. The disrupted alleles were individually integrated into the chromosome by one of two independent methods: 1) homologous recombination following transformation with linearized DNA into a recD strain (20Russell C.B. Thaler D.S. Dahlquist F.W. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2609-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 2) cloning of the disrupted alleles into the temperature sensitive replication plasmid pMAK705 (21Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to allow use of a two-step method (21Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to obtain double cross-over recombinants. The disrupted alleles were confirmed both by polymerase chain reaction analysis and by P1 mapping studies. The triple mutant was assembled in both the W3110 and ML308 strain backgrounds by P1 transduction (22Silhavy T.J. Berman M.L. Enquist L.W. Experiments with Gene Fusions. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1984: 107-112Google Scholar). A study of the transport properties of the SET proteins was undertaken as a first step toward elucidating the physiological function of this newly identified family of efflux proteins. BothsetA , setB , and setC were cloned downstream from the arabinose-inducible promoter, generating the plasmids pBAD-SetA, pBAD-SetB, and pBAD-SetC, respectively, and the resulting plasmids transformed into E. coli strain MC4100. Inside-out membrane vesicles were prepared from cells that hyperexpressed the plasmid-encoded Set proteins. (In this configuration, an efflux pump would be expected to transport a radiolabeled substrate into the inside of the vesicle, which can be monitored as the accumulation of radioactivity in the vesicle interior.) It was shown previously and confirmed here that both SetA and SetB transport [14C]lactose (Fig.1, A and B ). Transport was sensitive to the addition of the protonophore CCCP, which caused the release of the accumulated radioactivity to near basal levels. The accumulation of the labeled lactose was also dependent on the presence of either ATP or NADH, which gave equivalent rates of labeled lactose transport (data not shown) and was not observed in vesicles prepared from cells that harbored the control plasmid pBAD18. Transport activity in the SetB-containing vesicles was higher than that of SetA. The SetB and more recent preparations of SetA vesicles were prepared from cells grown with increased aeration. The transport activity of recent preparations of SetA vesicles is comparable with SetB and is likely due to increased SetA protein expression (data not shown). The ability of SetA and SetB to transport [14C]glucose was also tested. In this assay, a higher concentration of [14C]glucose, which was of a lower specific activity than that of the [14C]lactose, was used. Both SetA and SetB promoted the transport of [14C]glucose, which was accumulated in the vesicle interior (Fig. 1, C andD ). The accumulation of the radiolabeled glucose was also dependent on the presence of ATP, was sensitive to CCCP, and was not observed in vesicles prepared from cells that harbored the control plasmid pBAD18. We were unable to observe the transport of [14C]galactose by SetA or SetB (data not shown). In addition, vesicles prepared from the strain that harbored thesetC expression plasmid was unable to transport any of the three sugars tested; however, the level of protein expressed was not determined. Because our data from the SetA and SetB overexpression strains indicated that SetA has a broader substrate specificity than SetB (see below), an assay was developed to define the range of sugars and sugar analogues that could serve as SetA substrates. To facilitate the design of the assay, which was based on the inhibition of transport of radiolabeled lactose into inside-out vesicles, a study of the kinetic properties of lactose transport by SetA was conducted. Fig.2 A shows the kinetics of lactose transport at varying substrate concentrations. The rate of transport appears to be saturable (Fig. 2 B ) with an apparentK m of 1.9 mm andV max of 0.12 pmol lactose/μg protein/s (Fig.2 C ). In the assay for possible substrates or inhibitors of lactose transport, the accumulation of radiolabeled lactose into inside-out vesicles was performed in the presence of unlabeled test compounds at 25 mm and [14C]lactose at 0.14 mm. (Note that this assay cannot distinguish between substrates that are effluxed by SetA and inhibitors that can compete with lactose for binding but that themselves are not transported.) The results of the competition assay are shown in Fig.3 and are briefly summarized here. Of the tested sugars, trioses, tetroses, pentoses, and heptoses are poor inhibitors, whereas selective hexoses and disaccharides, the best beingd-glucose (72% inhibition; Fig. 3 B ) and cellobiose (88% inhibition; Fig. 3 C ), respectively, show inhibitory activity. Glucosides and galactosides with large alkyl or aryl aglycone substituents are the most potent inhibitors of lactose transport (91–100% inhibition; Fig. 3 D ). When the alkyl substituent is a small methyl group, such as that found in the methyl-galactosides, there is a significant reduction in the inhibitory activity (methyl-α-galactoside 0%; methyl-β-galactoside 50%) in addition to a pronounced preference for a β-linkage of the aglycone to the sugar (Fig. 3 D ). Interestingly, α- and β-d-glucose-1-phosphate are both inactive inhibitors. The inactivity is likely due to the presence of the negative charge and not a steric effect of the phosphate group (Fig. 3 D ). The first position can be replaced with the larger and uncharged phenyl substituent found in phenyl-α and phenyl-β-d-glucosides, which are both potent inhibitors (Fig. 3 D ).Figure 3Inhibition of SetA catalyzed [14C]lactose transport into inside-out vesicles. The assay measured the amount of SetA-dependent [14C]lactose taken up into inside-out vesicles in 30 s in the presence of the indicated inhibitor at 25 mm. The amount of [14C]lactose transported in the presence of 25 mm NaCl is taken to be 100. The classes of compounds tested for inhibitory activity were as follows: A , nonsugars, 3, 4, and 5 carbon monosaccharides. B , 6 and 7 carbon monosaccharides. C , disaccharides and trisaccharides.D , glucosides and galactosides. Each data point represents the mean of triplicate determinations ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A series of cell-based assays were designed to test whether SetA and SetB transport the substrates identified by the in vitro transport assays. A set of pBR322 derived plasmids were constructed that constitutively expressed each of the set genes by cloning them downstream from the promoter for the tetracycline resistance gene. The plasmids were transformed individually intoE. coli strain W3110, which is wild type at thelac locus, and the resulting strains were each expected to hyperexpress one of the Set proteins. These strains were tested for the ability of the individual Set proteins to transport either IPTG or lactose. Because IPTG and lactose are both inducers of thelac operon, the level of β-galactosidase activity should reflect the intracellular concentration of the inducer. If the inducer is effluxed from the cell by a Set protein, the level of β-galactosidase activity would be expected to be lower. Strains harboring individual set plasmids were titrated with either lactose or IPTG, and the level of β-galactosidase activity was measured. Fig. 4 A shows that only SetA can efflux IPTG, because the level of β-galactosidase activity in the setA -containing plasmid was equal to that of the background at 0.1 mm IPTG. The level of β-galactosidase activity increased as the concentrations of IPTG rose from 1.0 to 100 mm, where it plateaued. This is the expected result if SetA is simply an efflux pump for the inducer. At high extracellular concentrations of the inducer, the rate of entry of the inducer exceeds the rate of efflux by SetA. In contrast, strains with either the setB or the setC plasmid, as well as the strain harboring the control plasmid pBR322, all showed high levels of β-galactosidase activity at 0.1 mm IPTG. The plateau level of β-galactosidase activity in the strain with thesetB plasmid was lower than that of the control strain with pBR322, possibly reflecting the slow growth phenotype of this strain. Fig. 4 B shows that both SetA and SetB can efflux lactose. The β-galactosidase activity of the strain with the setA plasmid remained at background levels when titrated with lactose at up to 10 mm. Growth of this strain was not affected by the addition of lactose at the concentrations used. The β-galactosidase activity of the strain with the setB plasmid was equal to that of the background level at 0.1 mm lactose and was 22% of the level present in the control strain with pBR322 at 1 and 10 mm lactose. In contrast, the level of β-galactosidase activity in the strain with the setC plasmid was similar to that of the control strain with pBR322. Comparison of the lactose and IPTG titration curves indicates that IPTG is a better inducer of thelac operon, which is due to the fact that lactose is not active as an inducer until it is rearranged to allolactose by the action of β-galactosidase (23Burstein C. Cohn M. Kepes A. Monod J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 95: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because the in vitro transport studies indicated that aryl-glycosides may possibly serve as substrates for SetA, a cell-based assay was therefore designed to test this. It was previously reported that the intracellular accumulation of the toxic β-galactoside analogue, ONPTG, inhibits growth (24Muller Hill B. Crapo L. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 59: 1259-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Growth inhibition is dependent on the expression of lacY , because ONPTG is a substrate for the LacY permease (25Flagg J.L. Wilson T.H. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 128: 701-707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If ONPTG is also a substrate for SetA efflux, it would be expected that strains that hyperexpress SetA would be more resistant to the sugar analogue. A strain constitutive for thelac operon (ML308) was transformed with plasmids pBAD-SetA, pBAD-SetB or the control plasmid pBAD18. Transformants were tested for resistance to ONPTG by following the growth curves of cultures in the absence or presence of arabinose; the latter condition is expected to induce expression of SetA or SetB in the corresponding transformants. In the pBAD18 transformant, the presence of ONPTG caused a decrease in the growth rate (Fig. 5 A ). The severity of the growth inhibition was dependent upon the concentration of ONPTG in the medium. The presence of arabinose slightly decreased the growth yield (compare Fig. 5, A an"

FuguPTHrP also failed to activate the human PTH2R but had similar efficiency and efficacy as hPTH and hPTHrP when tested with cells expressing the human PTH1R. Agonist-dependent activation of zPTH2R was less efficient than that of zPTH2R(43), and both receptor variants showed no cAMP accumulation when stimulated with either secretin, growth hormone-releasing hormone, or calcitonin. The zPTH2R thus has ligand specificity similar to that of the human homolog, which raises the possibility that a PTH-like molecule exists in zebrafish, species which lack parathyroid glands.

Biology of Fishes. Saunders College Publishing, New York1998Google Scholar). In most fishes, the environmental challenges with regard to mineral ion homeostasis are therefore distinctly different than those in mammals, in which the regulation of calcium and phosphate is predominantly controlled by vitamin D, parathyroid hormone (PTH),1 and a still poorly characterized phosphaturic factor (2Harvey S. Zeng Y.Y. Pang P.K.T. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1987; 68: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 3Potts Jr., J.T. Jüppner H. Avioli L.V. Krane S.M. Metabolic Bone Disease.

In mammals, PTH is expressed almost exclusively in the parathyroid glands, and its calcium-homeostatic actions are mediated through a G protein-coupled receptor, the type 1 PTH/PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) receptor (PTH1R) (3Potts Jr., J.T.

In addition to mediating these endocrine actions of PTH, the widely expressed PTH1R also mediates, at least in mammals, the autocrine/paracrine actions of PTHrP (3Potts Jr., J.T. Jüppner H.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4285-4297Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Unlike the PTH1R, the PTH2R is activated by PTH and a partially characterized PTH-like peptide from the hypothalamus but not at all or very poorly by PTHrP (18Usdin T.B. Gruber C. Bonner T.I. J.

Furthermore, its expression is limited to a few tissues (18Usdin T.B. Gruber C. Bonner T.I. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4285-4297Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and due to this ligand specificity and its restricted tissue distribution, the PTH2R is unlikely to assume functions that are normally mediated by the PTH1R. Consequently, mice that lack the PTH1R die in utero or at birth (21Lanske B. Karaplis A.C. Luz A. Vortkamp A. Pirro A. Karperien M. Defize L.H.K. Ho C. Mulligan R.C. Abou-Samra A.B. Jüppner H. Segre G.V. Kronenberg H.M. Science. 1996; 273: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar) and show developmental defects that are similar, but more severe, than those observed for PTHrP-ablated animals (8Karaplis A.C. Luz A. Glowacki J. Bronson R. Tybulewicz V. Kronenberg H.M. Mulligan R.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 277-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar).To begin exploring the evolution of the receptors for PTH and PTHrP, we recently isolated two non-allelic cDNAs encoding PTH1Rs from the frog Xenopus laevis (22Bergwitz C. Klein P. Kohno H. Forman S.A. Lee K. Rubin D. Jüppner H. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 723-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To extend these studies and to begin evaluating the biological roles of these receptors in fishes, we have isolated partial genomic and cDNA clones encoding a G protein-coupled receptor from catfish (Ictalurus punctatus ) and full-length cDNA clones encoding the zebrafish (Danio rerio ) homolog. This receptor showed highest amino acid sequence identity with mammalian PTH2Rs, was activated by human PTH, but not by human or fugufish PTHrP, and is therefore likely to represent the zebrafish PTH2R (zPTH2R) homolog. Further characterization of the zPTH2R in vitro and in vivo will help define its biological role(s) in fishes and could provide insights into function(s) mediated by its mammalian homolog. The more detailed exploration of the evolution of PTH1Rs and PTH2Rs may furthermore lead to the identification of a common ancestral precursor and possibly other PTH/PTHrP-like receptors. In contrast to terrestrial vertebrates, fishes usually have an abundant supply of calcium but an insufficient supply of phosphate (1Bond C.E. Biology of Fishes. Saunders College Publishing, New York1998Google Scholar). In most fishes, the environmental challenges with regard to mineral ion homeostasis are therefore distinctly different than those in mammals, in which the regulation of calcium and phosphate is predominantly controlled by vitamin D, parathyroid hormone (PTH),1 and a still poorly characterized phosphaturic factor (2Harvey S. Zeng Y.Y. Pang P.K.T. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1987; 68: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 3Potts Jr., J.T. Jüppner H. Avioli L.V. Krane S.M. Metabolic Bone Disease.

In mammals, PTH is expressed almost exclusively in the parathyroid glands, and its calcium-homeostatic actions are mediated through a G protein-coupled receptor, the type 1 PTH/PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) receptor (PTH1R) (3Potts Jr., J.T. Jüppner H. Avioli L.V. Krane S.M. Metabolic Bone Disease. Academic Press, New York1997: 51-94Google Scholar, 5Segre G.V. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, New York1996: 377-403Google Scholar). In addition to mediating these endocrine actions of PTH, the widely expressed PTH1R also mediates, at least in mammals, the autocrine/paracrine actions of PTHrP (3Potts Jr., J.T. Jüppner H. Avioli L.V. Krane S.M. Metabolic Bone Disease. Academic Press, New York1997: 51-94Google Scholar, 6Yang K.H. Stewart A.F. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology.

Partial DNA sequences encoding a putative fish PTH molecule were isolated from rainbow trout genomic DNA (17Rosenberg J. Kronenberg H.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1991; 6 (abstr.): 379Google Scholar), and a genomic DNA sequence encoding a teleost PTHrP homolog was recently isolated from pufferfish (FUGU Landmark Mapping Project Database clones 115E01AC6 and 155E01eB5).

The existence of UCP in A. castellanii (AcUCP) has been revealed using antibodies raised against plant UCP. Its molecular mass (32,000 Da) was similar to those of plant and mammalian UCPs. The activity of AcUCP has been investigated in mitochondria depleted of free fatty acids. Additions of linoleic acid stimulated state 4 respiration and decreased transmembrane electrical potential (ΔΨ) in a manner expected from fatty acid cycling-linked H+ reuptake. The half-maximal stimulation by linoleic acid was reached at 8.1 ± 0.4 μm. Bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free), which adsorbs linoleic acid, reversed the respiratory stimulation and correspondingly restored ΔΨ. AcUCP was only weakly inhibited by purine nucleotides like UCP in plants. A single force-flow relationship has been observed for state 4 respiration with increasing concentration of linoleic acid or of an uncoupler and for state 3 respiration with increasing concentration of oligomycin, indicating that linoleic acid has a pure protonophoric effect. The activity of AcUCP in state 3 has been evidenced by ADP/oxygen atom determination. The discovery of AcUCP indicates that UCPs emerged, as specialized proteins for H+cycling, early during phylogenesis before the major radiation of phenotypic diversity in eukaryotes and could occur in the whole eukaryotic world.

Nature. 1995; 375: 24Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar), the mammalian uncoupling protein (UCP) present in brown adipose tissue (UCP1) was believed to be a late evolutionary acquisition required especially for transient thermogenesis in newborn, cold-acclimated and hibernating mammals (2Klingenberg M.

The recent discovery of several novel uncoupling proteins (UCP2, UCP3, and UCP4) in various mammalian tissues showed that UCP is more widespread in tissues of higher animals than previously believed and could have various physiological roles (3Fleury C.

Costa A.D.T. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24272-24278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and immunologically detected in several climacteric fruits (i.e. those that exhibit a respiratory burst during ripening) (7Jez̆ek P.

Characterization and expression of UCP-like genes in plants has also been addressed for instance in various tissues of potato (8Laloi M. Klein M. Riesmeier J.W. Muller-Rober B. Fleury C. Bouillaud F. Ricquier D. Nature. 1997; 389: 135-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and in Arabidopsis thaliana (9Maia I.G. Benedetti C.E. Leite A. Turcinelli S.R. Vercesi A.E. Arruda P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The presence of uncoupling protein in plants seems to be widespread, which may suggest various physiological roles for instance in fruit ripening (10Almeida A.M. Jarmuszkiewicz W. Khomsi H. Arruda P.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). UCPs are located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, and their activity dissipates the proton electrochemical gradient built up by respiration and produces heat instead of ATP. The action of UCPs is to mediate free fatty acid (FFA) cycling (13Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modriansky M. Vassanelli P. Jez̆ek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2615-2620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) by exporting anionic FFA outside the mitochondria, where it becomes protonated (neutral) and rapidly recrosses the membrane with its proton. This FFA-cycling H+ reuptake is driven by transmembrane electrical potential (ΔΨ, negative inside) and pH difference acidic outside. UCPs are activated by FFA (substrate activation by anionic FFA) and are allosterically inhibited by purine nucleotides (7Jez̆ek P. Engstova H. Zackova M. Vercesi A.E. Costa A.D.T. Arruda P. Garlid K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). For instance, in tomato mitochondria, the addition of linoleic acid (LA) results in mitochondrial uncoupling, as revealed by an increase in cyanide-sensitive state 4 respiration and a decrease in ΔΨ (14Jarmuszkiewicz W. Almeida A.M. Sluse-Goffart C.M. Sluse F.E. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34882-34886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The apparent K m for LA-induced respiration (i.e. LA concentration that produces 50% stimulation) is about 10 μm (11Sluse F.E. Almeida A.M. Jarmuszkiewicz W. Vercesi A.E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the addition of GTP, which inhibits PUMP, and bovine serum albumin (BSA, free of fatty acids), which removes FFA, cancels LA-induced respiration and restores ΔΨ. It has been shown that LA-induced PUMP activity is present during phosphorylating respiration and is able to divert energy from oxidative phosphorylation (14Jarmuszkiewicz W. Almeida A.M.

Moreover, LA-induced stimulation of respiration was due to a pure protonophoric activity without any direct effect on the electron transport chain (14Jarmuszkiewicz W. Almeida A.M. Sluse-Goffart C.M.

The presence of uncoupling proteins in plant and mammalian mitochondria has suggested that the ancestral gene has probably evolved prior to the divergence into animals and plants. In this work, we have identified immunologically and characterized functionally an uncoupling protein in mitochondria from Acanthamoeba castellanii , a nonphotosynthetic soil amoeboid protozoon, which in molecular phylogenesis appears on a branch basal to the divergence points of plants, animals, and fungi (15Wainright P.O. Hinkle G. Sogin M.L. Stickel S.K. Science. 1993; 260: 340-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 16Gray M.W. Burger G. Lang B.F. Science. 1999; 283: 1476-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). This discovery proves that UCPs are much more widespread than previously believed and could occur in the whole eukaryotic world. Soil amoebaA. castellanii , strain Neff, was cultured as described by Jarmuszkiewicz et al. (17Jarmuszkiewicz W. Wagner A.M. Wagner M.J. Hryniewiecka L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Trophozoites of amoeba were collected 22–24 h following inoculation at the middle exponential phase (at a density of about 2–4 × 106 cells/ml). Mitochondria were isolated and purified on a self-generating Percoll gradient (31%) as described before (17Jarmuszkiewicz W. Wagner A.M. Wagner M.J. Hryniewiecka L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Mitochondria of green tomato fruits and yellow lupine cotyledons were isolated and purified according to Sluse et al. (11Sluse F.E. Almeida A.M. Jarmuszkiewicz W. Vercesi A.E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and Tomaszewska et al . (18Tomaszewska B. Jarmuszkiewicz W. Schramm R.W. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1992; 29: 489-496Google Scholar), respectively. Mitochondrial protein concentration was determined by the biuret method (19Gornall A.G. Bardawill C.J. David M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 751-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Up to 100 μg of mitochondrial protein was solubilized in the sample buffer containing 1% (w/v) SDS, 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 0.005% (v/v) bromphenol blue, and 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 4–5 min. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out in a manner similar to that of Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) using a 5% polyacrylamide stacking gel and a 12% polyacrylamide resolving gel containing 4.5 murea, followed by Western blotting according to Almeida et al. (10Almeida A.M. Jarmuszkiewicz W. Khomsi H. Arruda P. Vercesi A.E. Sluse F.E. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Antibodies against PUMP protein of potato (Solanum tuberosum ) (generously supplied by Dr. P. Arruda) were used at a dilution of 1:1000. The bands were detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL system). Oxygen uptake was measured polarographically using a Rank Brothers (Cambridge, United Kingdom) oxygen electrode in 2.7 ml of standard incubation medium (25 °C) containing 120 mm KCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mm KH2PO4, and 8 mm MgCl2, with 1.5–1.7 mg of mitochondrial protein. The membrane potential of mitochondria was measured simultaneously with oxygen uptake using a tetraphenylphosphonium-specific electrode according to Kamo et al . (21Kamo N. Muratsugu N. Hongoh R. Kobatake Y. J. Membr. Biol. 1979; 49: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). For calculation of ΔΨ value, the matrix volume of amoeba mitochondria was assumed as 2.0 μl × mg−1protein. All measurements were made in the presence of 10 mm succinate, 1.5 mm benzohydroxamate (BHAM), 170 μm ATP, and 15 μm rotenone. The ADP/O ratio was determined by an ADP (130 μm) pulse method with succinate (plus rotenone) as oxidizable substrate. The total amount of oxygen consumed during state 3 respiration was used for calculation of the ratio. Measurements of ΔΨ allowed the fine control of the duration of state 3 respiration. Tetraphenylphosphonium was obtained from Fluka. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Immonoblotting of the total mitochondrial protein allowed immunological detection of Acanthamoeba castellanii UCP (AcUCP) with antibodies developed against potato PUMP protein. A single protein band with a molecular mass of approximately 32,000 Da is revealed in A. castellanii , in green tomato fruit, and in yellow lupine cotyledons, indicating cross-reaction of plant antibodies with amoeba protein (Fig. 1). Simultaneous measurements of oxygen consumption and ΔΨ with succinate (plus rotenone) as oxidizable substrate were performed with amoeba mitochondria depleted of FFA by isolation and purification in the presence of BSA. Since the respiratory chain of A. castellanii , like that of plant mitochondria, possesses a nonelectrogenic cyanide- and antimycin-resistant alternative oxidase (AOX) (22Hryniewiecka L. Jenek J. Michejda J. Ducet G. Lance C. Plant Mitochondria. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1978: 307-314Google Scholar), its inhibitor (i.e. BHAM) has been added to the incubation medium. State 4 (resting) respiration (plus oligomycin, plus BHAM) was stimulated by the successive addition of LA (+ 80% at 16 μm LA) with a parallel decrease in ΔΨ from 185 to 161 mV (− 24 mV, − 13%) (Fig. 2). The addition of BSA (fatty acid-free), which adsorbs FFA, reversed the respiratory stimulation and correspondingly restored ΔΨ. Like PUMP (7Jez̆ek P. Engstova H. Zackova M. Vercesi A.E. Costa A.D.T. Arruda P. Garlid K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and in contrast to the behavior of UCP1, AcUCP was only weakly inhibited by purine nucleotides. Thus, when ATP or GTP was added in the absence of BSA, almost no change in respiratory rate or ΔΨ was observed (not shown). LA-induced stimulation of state 4 respiration suggests the existence of energy-dissipating FFA cycling-linked H+reuptake in A. castellanii mitochondria. LA-induced BHAM-resistant respiratory rate (i.e. the difference between respiratory rate in the presence of LA minus respiratory rate after the addition of BSA) should represent part of total AcUCP activity (i.e. part of FFA cycling-linked H+ reuptake). This activity was measured for various LA concentrations (from 0 to 24 μm) in FFA-depleted amoeba mitochondria (Fig.3). LA-induced respiratory rate increased with the increasing concentration of LA, and 50% of maximal stimulation by LA (S 0.5) was reached at 8.1 ± 0.4 μm (Fig. 3, inset ). The apparent maximal rate of LA-induced respiration calculated from the linear regression was 129 ± 5 nmol of oxygen atom/min/mg of protein. The apparent K m value (S 0.5) for LA in A. castellanii is close to that obtained with isolated tomato fruit mitochondria (10.3 ± 1.1 μm) (11Sluse F.E. Almeida A.M. Jarmuszkiewicz W. Vercesi A.E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, in amoeba mitochondria, S 0.5 expressed per mg of mitochondrial protein is lower (14.6 nmol/mg of protein) compared with tomato mitochondria (26.8 nmol/mg of protein). These quantitative functional measurements are in accordance with the proposal of a FFA cycling-linked H+ reuptake catalyzed by a UCP-like protein in A. castellanii mitochondria. The features of AcUCP are very similar to those of PUMP in plant mitochondria. In A. castellanii mitochondria, both AcUCP and AOX dissipate energy and therefore must lead to the same final effect i.e. decrease in oxidative phosphorylation efficiency. ADP/O ratio, the best parameter to estimate oxidative phosphorylation efficiency, has been measured under four conditions in fully FFA-depleted amoeba mitochondria (Table I): 1) in the presence of BHAM and BSA, when AOX and AcUCP are inactive (control); 2) in the presence of BHAM and LA, when only AcUCP is active; 3) in the presence of GMP, the allosteric activator of AOX in amoeba mitochondria (22Hryniewiecka L. Jenek J. Michejda J. Ducet G. Lance C. Plant Mitochondria. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1978: 307-314Google Scholar) and BSA, when only AOX is active; and 4) in the presence of GMP and LA, when both AcUCP and AOX are active. Under control conditions, the ADP/O ratio measured with succinate plus rotenone was 1.40 ± 0.03 (S.D., n = 6), thereby in accordance with previous results observed in A. castellanii mitochondria (23Jarmuszkiewicz W. Sluse-Goffart C.M. Hryniewiecka L. Michejda J. Sluse F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10174-10180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). When AcUCP was activated with a low LA concentration (3.7 μm), ADP/O decreased to 0.80 ± 0.05 (S.D., n = 4). When AOX was activated with 0.6 mm GMP, the ADP/O decreased to 0.96 ± 0.04 (S.D., n = 6) as already observed in Ref. 23Jarmuszkiewicz W. Sluse-Goffart C.M. Hryniewiecka L. Michejda J. Sluse F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10174-10180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar. When both dissipating systems were activated, the ADP/O dropped to 0.63 ± 0.06 (S.D., n = 4) indicating a cumulative effect of both dissipating pathways on the oxidative phosphorylation efficiency. Such a cumulative effect was not observed in tomato mitochondria, where LA was shown to inhibit AOX activity (11Sluse F.E. Almeida A.M. Jarmuszkiewicz W. Vercesi A.E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the effect of LA has been checked on the cyanide-resistant state 4 (plus oligomycin) respiration (in the presence and absence of GMP) in amoeba mitochondria. As shown in Fig.4, increasing LA concentration within the 0–22 μm range did not inhibit the AOX activity. This important difference between amoeba and tomato will be discussed. The ADP/O measurements have been used to determine the contribution of each dissipating pathway in state 3 respiration according to the method used to calculate the AOX contribution in amoeba mitochondria (23Jarmuszkiewicz W. Sluse-Goffart C.M. Hryniewiecka L. Michejda J. Sluse F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10174-10180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The ADP/O ratios with 3.7 μm LA (0.80) and without LA (1.40) (Table I) have been used to estimate the contribution of AcUCP activity (i.e. part of the cytochrome pathway activity that is finally dissipated into heat, Vcyt diss) and the contribution of ATP synthase activity (i.e. part of the cytochrome pathway activity that is finally conserved into ATP, Vcyt cons) at a given state 3 (V3) respiration rate (plus BHAM).Vcyt cons=V3×(ADP/O) +LA(ADP/O) −LAEquation 1 andVcyt diss=V3−Vcyt consEquation 2 Therefore, Vcyt cons represents 57%, and Vcyt diss represents 43% of state 3 respiration at 3.7 μm LA. These calculations are valid only if several requirements are fulfilled. 2W. Jarmuszkiewicz, A. M. Almeida, C. M. Sluse-Goffart, A. E. Vercesi, and F. E. Sluse, manuscript in preparation. Nevertheless, they show how change in the cellular FFA concentration can decrease the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation through an activation of AcUCP. The same type of calculations for AOX and cytochrome pathway contributions in state 3 respiration (plus BSA) can be made as described and validated previously (23Jarmuszkiewicz W. Sluse-Goffart C.M. Hryniewiecka L. Michejda J. Sluse F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10174-10180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Taking the ADP/O ratio with GMP (0.96) (Table I), the contribution of the cytochrome pathway represents 69%, and the contribution of AOX represents 31% of state 3 respiration. Since, in contrast to tomato mitochondria (11Sluse F.E. Almeida A.M. Jarmuszkiewicz W. Vercesi A.E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), LA did not inhibit AOX activity in amoeba mitochondria (Fig. 3), the cumulative effect of both dissipating pathways on oxidative phosphorylation can be observed but not distinguished. Taking the ADP/O value in the presence of LA and GMP (0.63), Vcyt cons represents 45% and the total dissipating pathway-sustained respiration represents 55% of state 3 respiration. Thus, 55% of redox energy can be dissipated into heat when both dissipating pathways are activated even for such a low LA concentration (3.7 μm).Table IInfluence of various incubation conditions on the ADP/O ratio with succinate (plus rotenone) as oxidizable substrateWith BSA and BHAMWith 3.7 μm LA and BHAMWith 0.6 mm GMP and BSAWith 3.7 μm LA and 0.6 mm GMPADP/O1.400.800.960.63S.D.0.030.050.040.06n6464Assay conditions were as described under “Materials and Methods.” The concentrations used were 1.5 mm BHAM, 0.5% BSA, 3.7 μm LA, and 0.6 mm GMP (where indicated). Open table in a new tab Assay conditions were as described under “Materials and Methods.” The concentrations used were 1.5 mm BHAM, 0.5% BSA, 3.7 μm LA, and 0.6 mm GMP (where indicated). If LA-induced respiration is only due to a proton recycling by AcUCP, it must correspond to a pure protonophoric effect of LA not distinguishable from the effect of other well known protonophores like carbonyl cyanide p -trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP). Fig. 5 reports a relation between couples of ΔΨ and respiration rate measurements in the presence of BHAM under five conditions: 1) in state 4 with increasing concentrations of FCCP (○); 2) in state 4 with increasing concentrations of LA (▵); 3) in state 3 with increasing concentrations of oligomycin (■); 4) in state 4 with 5.3 μm LA with increasing concentrations of FCCP (●); and 5) in state 4 with 9.5 μm LA with increasing concentrations of FCCP (●). All state 4 measurements were made in the presence of 2 μg/mg of protein oligomycin. The maximal respiration in the uncoupled state (at ≥0.15 μm FCCP) was 233 nmol of oxygen atom/min/mg of protein. The state 3 respiratory rate was 218 ± 6 nmol of oxygen atom/min/mg of protein (S.D.,n = 7), and the mean ΔΨ value was 164 ± 4 mV (S.D., n = 7). The maximal respiration in state 4 with 22–33 μm LA was about 227 nmol of oxygen atom/min/mg of protein. The state 4 respiratory rate was 127 ± 4 nmol of oxygen atom/min/mg of protein (S.D., n = 12), and the corresponding mean ΔΨ value was 187 ± 2 mV (S.D.,n = 12). A set of conditions constituted a single force-flow relationship, indicating that LA did not interact with the respiratory electron transport chain in amoeba mitochondria and had a pure protonophoric effect. Moreover, respiratory rates measured with saturating LA and FCCP were almost the same, indicating that maximal electron flux was reached by activation of AcUCP. The recent discovery of an uncoupling protein in the plant phylum together with its well known presence in animal phylum has suggested that its acquisition in eukaryotic cells must have occurred prior to the divergence of the two phyla. In this work for the first time (to our knowledge) we show the presence and we describe the functional properties of a UCP-like protein in mitochondria from protist A. castellanii , which has a particularly interesting position in molecular phylogeny (15Wainright P.O. Hinkle G. Sogin M.L. Stickel S.K. Science. 1993; 260: 340-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 16Gray M.W. Burger G. Lang B.F. Science. 1999; 283: 1476-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). The existence of AcUCP has been revealed using antibodies raised against PUMP protein from potato mitochondria. The relative molecular mass of AcUCP (32,000 Da) is similar to those of plant and mammalian UCPs. This and cross-reactivity indicate close molecular relationship with the other members of UCP family. The results reported here support the hypothesis that AcUCP possesses uncoupling properties similar to those of PUMP and mammalian UCPs. Garlid et al. (13Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modriansky M. Vassanelli P. Jez̆ek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2615-2620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) have provided the mechanistic basis of the carrier-mediated uncoupling by the H+ circuit. They have demonstrated that anionic FFA are electrophoretically exported by UCP and that this efflux is coupled with a fast return of protonated FFA across the phospholipid bilayer leading to a H+circuit, which uncouples mitochondria. Accordingly, in amoeba mitochondria, the addition of LA, which can strongly activate H+ cycling, increased the respiratory rate in the absence of energy-requiring processes and induced a drop in ΔΨ (Fig. 2). The LA concentration dependence of LA-induced AcUCP-sustained respiration (Fig. 3) is similar to the LA dependence of PUMP-sustained respiration in tomato mitochondria (11Sluse F.E. Almeida A.M. Jarmuszkiewicz W. Vercesi A.E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) except that the maximal rate of LA-induced respiration was 5 times higher in green tomato mitochondria. Nevertheless, as in tomato (14Jarmuszkiewicz W. Almeida A.M. Sluse-Goffart C.M. Sluse F.E. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34882-34886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the drop in ΔΨ of state 4 respiration due to LA (with both ATPase and AOX activities blocked) resulted in a respiration rate almost equal to the fully uncoupled state (Fig. 5). These two rates were a little higher than the state 3 (plus BHAM) respiratory rate. This close equality means that the three systems (i.e. ATP synthesis, AcUCP, and uncoupling by FCCP) have the same ability to consume H+ electrochemical gradient and to lead to the maximal electron flux in the cytochrome pathway of the respiratory chain. These observations strongly support the view that in amoeba mitochondria LA did not only induce a mild uncoupling through other carriers nonspecialized in FFA-induced H+ recycling (30Skulachev V.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1363: 100-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar) but also that a UCP-like carrier is actually implied in the LA effect. The close equality of LA-stimulated respiration and state 3 respiration also means that LA cannot induce important acceleration of state 3 respiration, as shown in tomato mitochondria (14Jarmuszkiewicz W. Almeida A.M. Sluse-Goffart C.M. Sluse F.E. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34882-34886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), but it does not mean that AcUCP activity is not induced by the LA addition. Indeed, if H+ electrochemical gradient built by state 3 respiration in the presence of LA can be shared between oxidative phosphorylation and AcUCP activity, ADP/O must decrease in the presence of LA. Such decrease has been observed (TableI) with as low LA concentration as 3.7 μm and has been used to determine the contribution of AcUCP activity in state 3 respiration. Contributions of AOX and of AOX plus AcUCP have been determined too. These calculations show that AOX can share electron flux with the cytochrome pathway during phosphorylating respiration and that in our conditions both dissipating pathways can dissipate more than 50% of redox energy. A single force-flow relationship has been observed for state 4 with increasing concentrations of LA or FCCP (with or without 5.3 or 9.3 μm LA) and for state 3 with increasing concentrations of oligomycin with succinate (plus rotenone) as oxidizable substrate in the presence of BHAM (Fig. 5). Modulation of the force (ΔΨ) either by phosphorylation potential (with oligomycin), by H+permeability (with FCCP) or by LA addition leads to the same modification of the flow (respiratory rate). These observations indicate that LA has only a protonophoric effect and does not act directly on the activity of the respiratory chain. They are also in favor of a delocalized H+ circuit, since FCCP acts on the “bulk” ΔμH+, while oligomycin acts on a specific site of ATP synthase, which might be suspected to form a localized H+ circuit with respiratory complexes (31Westerhoff H.V. Malandri B.A. Venturoli G. Azzone G.F. Kell D.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 257-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). It can be concluded that the presence of LA gives rise to a proton recycling only and that AcUCP activity can efficiently divert energy from oxidative phosphorylation in state 3. The two energy-dissipating systems, a cyanide-resistant alternative oxidase and an uncoupling protein, were known to exist in plant mitochondria. However, the opposite effects of LA, an abundant FFA in plants, which activates PUMP and inhibits AOX (11Sluse F.E. Almeida A.M. Jarmuszkiewicz W. Vercesi A.E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), have led to the proposal that these dissipating systems could work sequentially during the life of the plant cell, since a high level of FFA, which induces PUMP activity, switched off AOX activity. Moreover, these results suggested that the respective metabolic roles of each dissipating system are different (10Almeida A.M. Jarmuszkiewicz W. Khomsi H. Arruda P. Vercesi A.E. Sluse F.E. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 11Sluse F.E. Almeida A.M. Jarmuszkiewicz W. Vercesi A.E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). On the contrary, in amoeba mitochondria the two dissipating systems are not co-regulated through FFA as shown by the insensitivity of AOX to LA (Fig. 4) and their cumulative effect on ADP/O (Table I). This observation does not mean that they are not co-regulated at all. Indeed, considering regulation, AOX of amoeba appears to be a quite different enzyme from plant AOX. While in plant mitochondria, the activity of AOX is stimulated by α -keto acids and regulated by the redox state of the enzyme (32Vanlerberghe G.C. McIntosh L. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 703-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), these regulations do not concern AOX in amoeba mitochondria (17Jarmuszkiewicz W. Wagner A.M. Wagner M.J. Hryniewiecka L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which, however, is strongly stimulated by purine mononucleotides (like GMP) (22Hryniewiecka L. Jenek J. Michejda J. Ducet G. Lance C. Plant Mitochondria. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1978: 307-314Google Scholar). Moreover, since both dissipating systems, AOX and AcUCP, lead to the same final energetic effect (i.e. a decrease in ATP synthesis), their metabolic usefulness can only be found in different physiological roles, and this point imposes a co-regulation perhaps through GMP/GDP/GTP ratios. The discovery of UCP in protist was more or less logically foreseen after the discovery of PUMP in plants. However, the presence of AcUCP in A. castellanii is most significant because of the position of this protist in the molecular phylogenetic tree of eukaryotes (15Wainright P.O. Hinkle G. Sogin M.L. Stickel S.K. Science. 1993; 260: 340-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 16Gray M.W. Burger G. Lang B.F. Science. 1999; 283: 1476-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). Indeed, A. castellanii appears on a branch basal to the divergence points of plants, animals, and fungi. Thus, its “bioenergetic” properties should be close to those of a primitive common ancestor of the whole eukaryotic world. A. castellanii, a nonphotosynthetic amoeboid protozoon, and higher plants share many common features at the level of respiratory chain like the presence of the nonprotonophoric inner and outer NADH dehydrogenases in addition to the nonprotonophoric AOX. The properties of AcUCP described here are closer to those of PUMP compared with mammalian UCPs. These and other phylogenetic features suggest thatA. castellanii is closer to the plant phylum than to animal and fungi phyla. However, regulation of AOX by purine mononucleosides like GMP is shared with some primitive fungi (e.g. Hansenula anomala (24Sakajo S. Minagawa N. Yoshimoto Y. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1997; 61: 397-399Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), Neurospora crassa (25Vanderleyden J. Peeters C. Verachtert H. Bertrandt H. Biochem. J. 1980; 188: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar),Moniliela tomentosa (26Vanderleyden J. Van den Eynde E. Verachtert H. Biochem. J. 1980; 186: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar)), bringing amoeba closer to the fungi phylum. However, this feature of AOX is also found in other protists like photosynthetic Euglena gracillis (27Sharpless T.K. Butow R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 58-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia (28Doussiere J. Vignais P.V. Biochem. J. 1984; 220: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The possibility exists that A. castellanii possesses all of the bioenergetic potentialities of the eukaryotic world and that some of them have been lost in the evolution of some phyla. UCPs belong to the family of mitochondrial anion carriers (29el Moualij B. Duyckaerts C. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Sluse F.E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) from which several members can participate in FFA-linked H+recycling as a side function (30Skulachev V.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1363: 100-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar) mainly in a high energy state of mitochondria. The discovery of AcUCP in A. castellanii indicates that UCPs, as specialized proteins for FFA-linked H+ recycling, emerged very early during phylogenesis and before the major radiation of phenotypic diversity in eukaryotes more than a thousand million years ago, and maybe even earlier after the acquisition of mitochondria in Eukarya. Thus, the discoveries of multiple members of the UCP family in mammals, of PUMP in plants, and now of protozoan UCP in A. castellanii indicate that UCPs are very much more widespread than previously believed and could occur in the whole eukaryotic world. The presence of both UCP and AOX inA. castellanii also demonstrates that the appearance of intracellular organellar mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation coupling was accompanied very soon by the emergence not only of a protein carrier specialized in FFA-mediated H+ recycling but also of an energy-dissipating oxidase that can modulate the tightness of coupling between respiration and ATP synthesis, thereby maintaining a balance between energy supply and demand in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2005017723,"Maxadilan is a vasodilatory peptide derived from sand flies that is an agonist at the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) type 1 receptor. Surprisingly, maxadilan does not share significant sequence homology with PACAP. To examine the relationship between structure and activity of maxadilan, several amino acid substitutions and deletions were made in the peptide. These peptides were examined in vitro for binding to crude membranes derived from rabbit brain, a tissue that expresses PACAP type 1 receptors; and induction of cAMP was determined in PC12 cells, a line that expresses these receptors. The peptides were examined in vivo for their ability to induce erythema in rabbit skin. Substitution of the individual cysteines at positions 1 and 5 or deletion of this ring structure had little effect on activity. Substitution of either cysteine at position 14 or 51 eliminated activity. Deletion of the 19 amino acids between positions 24 and 42 resulted in a peptide with binding, but no functional activity. The capacity of this deletion mutant to interact with COS cells transfected with the PACAP type 1 receptor revealed that this peptide was a specific antagonist to the PACAP type 1 receptor."

The effects on the kinetic parameters were such that either activity with the expanded-spectrum β-lactams remained unchanged or, in some cases, the activity was enhanced. The affinity of the enzyme for these poorer substrates (as defined by the dissociation constant, K s) invariably increased. Computation of the microscopic rate constants (k 2 andk 3) for turnover of these poorer substrates indicated either that the rate-limiting step in turnover was the deacylation step (governed by k 3) or that neither the acylation nor deacylation became the sole rate-limiting step.

Among clinical isolates of enteric Gram-negative bacilli, such asEscherichia coli , the most prevalent plasmid-encoded β-lactamase is the prototypical class A, or group 2b, enzyme, TEM-1 (1Ambler R.P. Coulson A.F. Frère J.-M. Ghuysen J.-M. Joris B. Forsman M. Levesque R.C. Tiraby G. Waley S.G. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 269-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 2Bush K. Jacoby G.A. Medeiros A.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2085) Google Scholar). This enzyme is produced constitutively and is active principally against penicillins, such as ampicillin, rather than expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, monobactams, or carbapenems (2Bush K. Jacoby G.A. Medeiros A.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2085) Google Scholar). Novel β-lactamases that confer resistance to such expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and monobactams in clinical isolates have arisen by mutation from class A β-lactamases, such as TEM or SHV (2Bush K.

The most common alteration in these mutant enzymes is replacement of Arg164, which is conserved among all “wild-type” class A β-lactamases. Many of these also contain other mutations. However, a single replacement of Arg164 in TEM-1 by serine to produce the TEM-12 enzyme is by itself sufficient to enhance enzymatic activity against ceftazidime and aztreonam and thereby to confer clinically significant resistance to these β-lactams (5Mabilat C.

From the crystal structures of class A β-lactamases (7Herzberg O. Moult J. Science. 1987; 236: 694-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 8Knox J.R. Moews P.C. J. Mol.

Funct. 1993; 16: 364-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), it is apparent that the base of the Ω-loop is anchored by a salt bridge between the side chains of Arg164 and Asp179, which are highly conserved residues in the amino acid sequences of known class A β-lactamases (17Massova I. Mobashery S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that the poor activity of the wild-type TEM enzyme against expanded-spectrum β-lactams such as ceftazidime (a cephalosporin) and aztreonam (a monobactam) is due to steric hindrance by the Ω-loop of the bulky 7β side chains of these substrates in the active site (3Knox J.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2593-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar,18Raquet X. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Fonzé E. Goussard S. Courvalin P. Frère J.-M. J. Mol.

Vakulenko S.B. Lerner S.A. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 7441-7448Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In fact, we have shown, by molecular modeling with dynamics simulations and energy minimization, that such unfavorable steric interactions between the bulky 7β side chain function of cefepime, a new expanded-spectrum cephalosporin, and residues Pro167and Asn170 of the TEM β-lactamase indirectly affect the second step of the catalytic mechanism (deacylation) (20Taibi-Tronche P. Massova I. Vakulenko S.B. Lerner S.A. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 7441-7448Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Mutational replacements of either Arg164 or Asp179 that would disrupt the salt bridge between them might be expected to distort the Ω-loop (as was shown by the crystallographic structure of the Asp179 → Asn mutant of the class A β-lactamase from Staphylococcus aureus PC1 (21Herzberg O. Kapadia G. Blanco B. Smith T.S. Coulson A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9503-9509Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)). Such restructured conformation of the Ω-loop might account for enhanced activity of mutant enzymes against expanded-spectrum β-lactams (20Taibi-Tronche P. Massova I. Vakulenko S.B. Lerner S.A. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 7441-7448Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22Imtiaz U. Manavathu E.K. Mobashery S. Lerner S.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 1134-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) by better accommodating the bulky side chains of these substrates in the active site. We have previously generated mutants of the TEMpUC19 β-lactamase with Asp179 replaced by each of the 19 other amino acids to study the impact of disruption of the salt bridge at residue 179 on β-lactam resistance conferred by the enzyme (23Vakulenko S.B. Tóth M. Taibi P. Mobashery S. Lerner S.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1878-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Many of the mutational replacements of Asp179 led to a reduction in MIC1 of ampicillin and/or a rise in MIC of ceftazidime, but no rise in MIC of aztreonam, cefotaxime, or cefepime (expanded-spectrum cephalosporins), or imipenem (a carbapenem). We have extended herein that study on mutations of Asp179 to examine the effects of mutations of Arg164, at the other end of the salt bridge. We examined minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of β-lactams conferred by all of the 19 mutant β-lactamases with amino acid replacements at this site. Furthermore, we then purified and studied the enzymes mutated at positions 164 or 179 that have the greatest effects on resistance to expanded-spectrum β-lactams to assess the structural and kinetics consequences of those mutations that lead to the observed resistance. Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, piperacillin, cephaloridine, cephalothin, and cephalosporin C were purchased from Sigma. [2-[[p -(Dimethylamino)phenyl]azo]-pyridino]cephalosporin (PADAC) was a product of Calbiochem. Other β-lactams were gifts from the following: ceftazidime, Glaxo; cefepime and aztreonam, Bristol-Myers Squibb; cefotaxime, Hoechst-Marion-Roussel; ceftriaxone, Roche Laboratories; imipenem, Merck and Co. E. coli JM83 (ara Δ(lac -proAB ) rpsL ϕ80lacZ ΔM15) (24Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11410) Google Scholar) was used as the host for all plasmids. Plasmid pUC19::kan was constructed by cloning the kanamycin resistance gene, aphA1 , from Tn903 (25Oka A. Sugisaki H. Takanami M. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 147: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) into theBam HI site in the polylinker of pUC19 (24Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11410) Google Scholar). This plasmid encodes the parental enzyme for this study, TEMpUC19β-lactamase, which differs from the TEM-1 enzyme (26Sutcliffe J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3737-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) by two mutations, Val84 → Ile and Ala184 → Val, which are considered to be enzymologically inconsequential (27Sowek J.A. Singer S.B. Ohringer S. Malley M.F. Dougherty T.J. Gougoutas J.Z. Bush K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3179-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). (The numbering of amino acid residues in the β-lactamase sequence is according to the convention of Ambler et al. (1Ambler R.P. Coulson A.F. Frère J.-M. Ghuysen J.-M. Joris B. Forsman M. Levesque R.C. Tiraby G. Waley S.G. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 269-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar).) Nineteen mutant transformants of E. coli JM83, each with a different replacement of Asp179 in TEMpUC19, were as reported by Vakulenko et al. (23Vakulenko S.B. Tóth M. Taibi P. Mobashery S. Lerner S.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1878-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Random site-directed mutagenesis of Arg164in the parental TEMpUC19 β-lactamase was carried out as for that of Asp179 (23Vakulenko S.B. Tóth M. Taibi P. Mobashery S. Lerner S.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1878-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), except that the mutagenic oligonucleotide mixture contained all four bases at each of the three positions corresponding to the codon for residue 164. After mutagenesis, E. coli JM83 was transformed with mutated DNA by electroporation, and transformants were selected by growth on Mueller-Hinton agar plates containing 30 μg of kanamycin/ml. DNA for nucleotide sequencing was isolated by an alkaline method (28Birnboim H.C. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (9838) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence was determined by the method of Sanger et al. (29Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) using a Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (U.S. Biochemicals, Cleveland, OH) and [α-35S]dATP (NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA). Mutant β-lactamases were identified according to the sequence of the codon in the bla gene corresponding to residue 164 of the TEMpUC19 β-lactamase and the entire β-lactamase gene and its promoter region on each mutant plasmid were sequenced. Only mutants with a single replacement at that site and no mutations elsewhere in the bla gene or its promoter were utilized for the study of the β-lactamase gene and its promoter region on each mutant plasmid The MICs of β-lactams for E. coli JM83 and its various transformants were determined by the microbroth dilution method in Mueller-Hinton broth with inocula of 105 colony forming units/ml and an 18-h incubation at 37 °C. Each MIC is the result of at least five determinations. β-Lactamases were purified to homogeneity (as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) fromE. coli JM83 transformants bearing the parental TEMpUC19 β-lactamase or mutant enzymes with a replacement of Arg164 or Asp179. One-liter cultures of each transformant grown overnight in Terrific Broth (Life Technologies, Inc.) served as the source of enzymes for purification. The procedure for enzyme purification was according to Zafaralla et al. (30Zafaralla G. Manavathu E.K. Lerner S.A. Mobashery S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3847-3852Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Kinetics measurements were carried out by continuous spectrophotometric assays at room temperature in a Hewlett-Packard 452 diode-array instrument, as described by Imtiazet al. (22Imtiaz U. Manavathu E.K. Mobashery S. Lerner S.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 1134-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and Taibi-Tronche et al. (20Taibi-Tronche P. Massova I. Vakulenko S.B. Lerner S.A. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 7441-7448Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The values of k cat and K m were determined from the Lineweaver-Burk plots of the initial steady-state velocities for each enzyme with the following ranges of substrate concentrations: ampicillin (50–200 μm), piperacillin (20–100 μm), cephalothin (80–200 μm), cephalosporin C (90–240 μm), cephaloridine (100–250 μm), aztreonam (200–500 μm), cefotaxime (30–200 μm), and ceftazidime (20–100 μm). Initial rates were determined from the first 5–10% of the reaction with five to seven substrate concentrations generally flanking theK m values. The procedure developed by Zafaralla et al. (30Zafaralla G. Manavathu E.K. Lerner S.A. Mobashery S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3847-3852Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) was followed to determine the dissociation constant (K s) for cefotaxime and ceftazidime with the TEMpUC19 β-lactamase and its Asn164 and Gly179 mutants. The values forK s were also determined for ceftazidime with the Ser164 and Asn179 mutant enzymes. Hydrolysis of PADAC was monitored at 610 nm (Δε610 = 1, 240m−1 cm−1). Two concentrations of PADAC (200 and 300 μm) were used. A series of mixtures containing both PADAC and at least five concentrations of various substrates flanking the dissociation constant were prepared in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, in a total volume of 0.3 ml. A portion of enzyme was added to start the inhibition assays. Enzyme inhibition by the given poorer substrate in each case was invariably competitive in nature. The values for the acylation rate constants (k 2) and deacylation rate constants (k 3) for ceftazidime and cefotaxime with TEMpUC19 β-lactamase and its mutants were measured by following the method described by Taibi-Tronche et al. (20Taibi-Tronche P. Massova I. Vakulenko S.B. Lerner S.A. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 7441-7448Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Activity of TEMpUC19 β-lactamase and its mutant variants after hydrolysis of ceftazidime and cefotaxime was measured in three different sets of assays. The enzyme (3.5 μm) was incubated overnight at room temperature with ceftazidime and cefotaxime at 200 μm. Subsequently, a 5-μl aliquot of the solution was added to 995 μl of penicillin G (2 mm), and its hydrolysis was monitored (Δε240 = 570 m−1cm−1). A control experiment was also carried out in which no substrate was present during the overnight incubation. A mixture containing 330 nm β-lactamase (TEMpUC19 or various mutant enzymes) and 240 nm thermolysin was incubated at 46 °C. At regular time intervals, 5-μl aliquots were added to 995 μl of 2 mm benzylpenicillin in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The level of residual activity of the enzyme was then measured for each time of incubation with thermolysin. A control experiment in which no thermolysin was added to the incubation mixture was carried out to measure any loss of activity due to heat alone. The Tripos software Sybyl was used for structure visualization and molecular modeling. The AMBER software package was used for energy minimization and structure determination. The crystal coordinates were used as starting conformations for the proteins. Small molecules were energy-minimized using the MOPAC program (AM1 parameterization). MOPAC MNDO electrostatic potential charges were used as a reference to develop charges on non-peptide portions of the complexes. The AMBER force field parameters were used for energy minimization, and missing force field parameters were developed for non-peptide substrate portions of the complex. The entire complex was energy-minimized until one of the following conditions was reached: 1) total number of the iterations reached 10,000; 2) the energy difference for two successive cycles was less than 0.05 kcal/mol; or 3) the gradient norm for two consecutive iterations was less than 0.05 kcal/(mole of Å). Table I presents the susceptibilities of the background host strain, E. coli JM83, alone or bearing plasmids that encode the parental TEMpUC19 β-lactamase or each of the 19 mutant enzymes resulting from replacement of Arg164. We have listed the mutant enzymes in decreasing order of ampicillin MICs that they confer. Although none of the mutant enzymes confers resistance to ampicillin quite as high as that produced by the parental enzyme, most of them produce a high level of residual resistance. Only five of the mutant enzymes confer MICs of ampicillin less than 1,000 μg/ml (in comparison with the ampicillin MIC of 32,000 μg/ml conferred by the parental enzyme).Table ISusceptibilities to β-lactams of E. coli JM83 alone and producing parental TEMpUC19 β-lactamase or mutant enzymes with replacements of Arg164Amino acid 179MIC1-aAMP, ampicillin; CAZ, ceftazidime; CEP, cefepime; AZT, aztreonam; TAX, cefotaxime; TRX, ceftriaxone.AMPCAZCEPAZTTAXTRXμg/mlNone1-bE. coli JM83.40.120.0150.060.030.03Arg32,0000.250.120.120.030.06Ser16,00016210.250.25Asn8,00032410.50.5His8,00080.50.50.120.12Asp4,00040.250.120.060.06Gly4,00040.250.120.060.06Gln4,00040.120.060.030.06Thr4,00010.060.060.030.06Ala2,00040.120.120.060.06Cys2,00020.120.060.030.03Glu2,00020.060.060.060.06Lys2,00010.030.030.030.06Met2,00010.060.060.030.06Leu1,00020.030.030.030.06Phe1,0000.50.030.030.030.06Tyr25010.030.030.030.06Trp1250.50.030.060.030.06Val1250.50.030.060.030.06Ile320.50.0150.060.030.06Pro810.030.060.030.061-a AMP, ampicillin; CAZ, ceftazidime; CEP, cefepime; AZT, aztreonam; TAX, cefotaxime; TRX, ceftriaxone.1-b E. coli JM83. Open table in a new tab Although the parental enzyme has little effect on the susceptibility to ceftazidime, all but four of the mutants show at least a 4-fold rise in MIC over that (0.5 μg/ml) of the strain containing the parental enzyme. Seven of the mutants confer ceftazidime MICs ≥ 4 μg/ml, and the three mutants (Ser164, Asn164, and His164) which produce the highest residual MICs of ampicillin also confer the highest MICs of ceftazidime (16, 32, and 8 μg/ml, respectively). Although little effect on cefepime susceptibility is produced by most of the mutant enzymes, the three that produce the highest levels of resistance to ceftazidime also confer MICs of cefepime at least 4-fold higher than that of the strain bearing the parental enzyme. The Ser164 and Asn164 mutants have cefepime MICs 16- and 32-fold greater than that of the strain with the parental enzyme, but the resulting MICs are still only 2 and 4 μg/ml, respectively. These same mutants also have elevations of MICs for aztreonam, although to only 1 μg/ml. Likewise, only the Ser164 and Asn164 mutants produce at least a 4-fold rise in MIC of both cefotaxime and ceftriaxone over that of the strain with the parental enzyme, but the resulting MICs of both cephalosporins are only 0.25 and 0.5 μg/ml, respectively, with the two mutant strains. Neither the parental TEMpUC19 enzyme nor any of the mutant derivatives with a replacement of Arg164 or Asp179 conferred an elevated MIC of imipenem (data not shown). The steady-state kinetics parameters with the TEMpUC19 β-lactamase and several of its mutant variants (Table II) were determined for three penicillins (penicillin G, ampicillin, and piperacillin), for three narrow-spectrum cephalosporins (cephaloridine, cephalothin, and cephalosporin C), for a monobactam (aztreonam), and for two expanded-spectrum cephalosporins (cefotaxime and ceftazidime), as a complement to the comparable experiments with cefepime that were reported earlier (20Taibi-Tronche P. Massova I. Vakulenko S.B. Lerner S.A. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 7441-7448Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The penicillins are turned over by the parental TEMpUC19 β-lactamase withk cat/K m in the order of 107m−1 s−1, and the corresponding catalytic efficiency for the narrow-spectrum cephalosporins is 1–3 orders of magnitude lower. Aztreonam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefepime are turned over by the TEMpUC19 β-lactamase with still much lowerk cat/K m values (7.4 × 102m−1 s−1; 7.8 × 102m−1 s−1; 40m−1 s−1; and 2.5 × 103m−1 s−1, respectively). Among these four expanded-spectrum β-lactams, ceftazidime exhibits the smallest turnover number (k cat = 0.008 ± 0.003 s−1), which is 22- and 50-fold lower than the turnover numbers for cefotaxime and aztreonam, respectively. These values contrast with those for penicillins, which are in the range of 770–1570 s−1, and those for the narrow-spectrum cephalosporins, which are in the range of 33–780 s−1. The slow turnover of these poor substrates is believed to be due to the bulky group at the C7βposition, which has unfavorable steric interactions with the Ω-loop that spans residues 164–179 of the TEMpUC19 β-lactamase (see below).Table IIKinetics parameters of TEMpUC19 and mutant derivativesSubstrateβ-Lactamasek catK mk cat/K ms−1μmm−1s−1Penicillin GTEMpUC191570 ± 300120 ± 30(1.3 ± 0.4) × 107R164N153 ± 337 ± 3(4.1 ± 0.3) × 106R164S21.9 ± 0.424 ± 1.4(9.1 ± 0.6) × 105D179N1.52 ± 0.416 ± 3(9.5 ± 3) × 104D179G0.72 ± 0.0238 ± 2(1.9 ± 0.1) × 104AmpicillinTEMpUC191040 ± 12027 ± 5(3.9 ± 0.8) × 107R164N79 ± 17.1 ± 0.7(1.1 ± 0.1) × 107R164S15 ± 137 ± 4(4.2 ± 0.5) × 105D179N1.60 ± 0.0385 ± 3(1.8 ± 0.1) × 104D179G13 ± 41100 ± 400(1.2 ± 0.4) × 104PiperacillinTEMpUC19770 ± 10070 ± 10(1.1 ± 0.2) × 107R164N109 ± 247 ± 3(2.4 ± 0.2) × 106R164S11 ± 122 ± 2(5.0 ± 0.6) × 105D179N0.74 ± 0.0455 ± 7(1.3 ± 0.2) × 104D179G0.43 ± 0.0131 ± 2(1.4 ± 0.1) × 104CephaloridineTEMpUC19780 ± 240670 ± 200(1.2 ± 0.4) × 106R164N65 ± 189 ± 3(7.3 ± 0.2) × 105R164S22 ± 2239 ± 25(9.2 ± 1.3) × 104D179N1.3 ± 0.2900 ± 100(1.4 ± 0.2) × 103D179G6 ± 0.6870 ± 100(6.9 ± 1) × 103Cephalosporin CTEMpUC1933 ± 3950 ± 80(3.5 ± 0.4) × 104R164N10 ± 4850 ± 200(1.2 ± 0.5) × 104R164S1.2 ± 0.2440 ± 90(2.7 ± 0.7) × 103D179N0.062 ± 0.00238 ± 7(1.6 ± 0.3) × 103D179G0.69 ± 0.04120 ± 13(5.9 ± 0.7) × 103CephalothinTEMpUC1941 ± 5210 ± 30(1.9 ± 0.4) × 105R164N41 ± 5455 ± 53(9.0 ± 1.5) × 104R164S3.5 ± 0.2180 ± 15(1.9 ± 0.2) × 104D179N0.21 ± 0.0148 ± 2(4.2 ± 0.3) × 103D179G0.31 ± 0.0141 ± 4(7.4 ± 0.7) × 103AztreonamTEMpUC190.4 ± 0.1550 ± 200(7.4 ± 3.0) × 102R164N6.7 ± 0.2540 ± 15(1.2 ± 0.1) × 104R164S1.5 ± 0.2635 ± 65(2.4 ± 0.4) × 103D179N0.06 ± 0.01220 ± 30(2.5 ± 0.5) × 102D179G0.06 ± 0.01340 ± 70(1.8 ± 0.5) × 102CefotaximeTEMpUC190.18 ± 0.04230 ± 50(7.8 ± 2.4) × 102R164N5.9 ± 0.7257 ± 36(2.3 ± 0.4) × 104R164S0.20 ± 0.02174 ± 15(1.1 ± 0.2) × 103D179N0.023 ± 0.00129 ± 3(7.9 ± 0.9) × 102D179G0.007 ± 0.001102 ± 16(6.9 ± 1.5) × 101CeftazidimeTEMpUC190.008 ± 0.003200 ± 100(4.0 ± 2.1) × 101R164N8 ± 2296 ± 60(2.7 ± 0.8) × 104R164S1.4 ± 0.2270 ± 80(5.2 ± 2.1) × 103D179N0.042 ± 0.008110 ± 20(3.8 ± 0.8) × 102D179G0.041 ± 0.00396 ± 9(4.3 ± 0.5) × 102Cefepime2-aPreviously reported in Ref. 20.TEMpUC190.6 ± 0.1240 ± 50(2.5 ± 0.6) × 103R164N290 ± 30317 ± 28(9.2 ± 1.3) × 105R164S22 ± 2230 ± 17(9.6 ± 1.1) × 104D179G0.024 ± 0.00115 ± 2(1.6 ± 0.2) × 1032-a Previously reported in Ref. 20Taibi-Tronche P.

Open table in a new tab Among the mutant β-lactamases with replacements of Arg164, those with an Arg164 → Ser or Arg164 → Asn mutation confer the highest levels of resistance to ceftazidime; furthermore, they are associated with the greatest increases in MIC against the other β-lactams tested, even though the transformants bearing these mutant enzymes remain nominally susceptible to these other β-lactams by usual clinical criteria. Therefore, the kinetics of these mutant enzymes were studied in comparison with those of the parental TEMpUC19 enzyme. Such replacements of Arg164 would be expected to disrupt the salt bridge between Arg164 and Asp179 that anchors the base of the Ω-loop. Since we had previously examined the effects of mutational replacement of Asp179 in the TEMpUC19 enzyme on susceptibility to various β-lactams (23Vakulenko S.B. Tóth M. Taibi P. Mobashery S. Lerner"

To determine which physicochemical characteristics of these sites determine their roles in anesthetic actions, an extensive series of single amino acid mutations at amino acid residue 288 (Ala-288) in TM3 of the α1 GlyR subunit was tested for modulation by volatile anesthetics. The mutations changed the apparent affinities of receptors for glycine; replacements with larger volumes and less hydropathy exhibited higher affinities for glycine. Potentiation by anesthetics was reduced by specific mutations at Ala-288. The molecular volume of the substituents was negatively correlated with the extent of potentiation by isoflurane, enflurane, and 1-chloro-1,2,2-trifluorocyclobutane, whereas there was no correlation between anesthetic enhancement and polarity, hydropathy, or hydrophilicity of substituents. In contrast to anesthetics, no correlation was found between the effects of the nonanesthetics 1,2-dichlorohexafluorocyclobutane or 2,3-dichlorooctafluorobutane and any physicochemical property of the substituent.

During the past few years, however, a consensus has emerged that general anesthetics act on the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily. Among them, the neurotransmitter receptors for the inhibitory amino acids γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)1and glycine were intensively studied as likely targets of general anesthetics in the brain and spinal cord (1Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Nature. 1997; 389: 334-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 2Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). The GlyR is composed of two families of subunits, the α (α1–α4) and β subunits (3Betz H. Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 458-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 4Bechade C.

In adult brains, the α1 and β subunits are expressed not only in the brainstem and spinal cord but also in higher brain regions such as the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. The native GlyR is considered to assemble in a pentameric structure with a proposed subunit stoichiometry of 3α1 and 2β subunits, but when expressed in Xenopus oocytes or mammalian cells, the α1 subunit can also form highly active homomeric GlyR, which has most of the pharmacological properties of the native GlyR. Each GlyR subunit has four putative transmembrane (TM) segments with the second (TM2) proposed to form the lining of the pore. This transmembrane topology is also believed to exist in other ligand-gated ion channels such as GABAA receptors and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Recombinant GlyR function is enhanced by volatile anesthetics (isoflurane, enflurane, halothane, sevoflurane, methoxyflurane, and 1-chloro-1,2,2-trifluorocyclobutane (F3)) (6Mascia M.P. Machu T.K.

Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 1331-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Recently, site-directed mutagenesis revealed that two specific amino acid residues in TM2 and TM3 (Ser-267 and Ala-288 for the α1 GlyR subunit, respectively) are critical for the enhancement of both the GlyR and GABAA receptors by volatile anesthetics and alcohols (10Mihic S.J.

Nature. 1997; 389: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). In the GABAA receptor, corresponding or nearby amino acid residues in TM2 and TM3 of the β subunits also govern modulation by the intravenous anesthetics etomidate, pentobarbital, and propofol (11Birnir B.

However, the physicochemical characteristics that determine their critical role in anesthetic actions are not known. Although the Meyer-Overton rule described a correlation between anesthetic potency and lipid solubility (15Miller K.W. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1985; 27: 1-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), the physicochemical nature of the anesthetic site of action is not necessarily hydrophobic. Some investigations suggest hydrophilic, polar, or amphipathic properties of the anesthetic target site (16Miller S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this investigation, we constructed an extensive series of replacements of Ala-288 in the TM3 of the α1 GlyR subunit by other amino acid residues with a variety of physicochemical properties and have examined the effects of each mutation on modulation by volatile anesthetics isoflurane, enflurane, and F3, and nonanesthetics F6 and 2,3-dichlorooctafluorobutane (F8).

Degenerate complementary oligonucleotides were used for the simultaneous creation of multiple mutants. 2S. J. Mihic and K. E. Vrana, manuscript in preparation. All mutations were verified by partial sequencing of both plasmid strands. Preparation of xenopus laevis oocytes and microinjection of the cDNA was performed as described previously (22Mihic S.J. Whiting P.J. Harris R.A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 268: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 23Mihic S.J. Harris R.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 277: 411-416PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated oocytes were placed in modified Barth's saline (MBS) containing (in mm): NaCl 88, KCl 1, HEPES 10, MgSO4 0.82, NaHCO3 2.4, CaCl2 0.91, and Ca(NO3)2 0.33 adjusted to pH 7.5. Wild-type and mutant α1 GlyR subunits cDNAs (0.4 ng in 30 nl) were injected into the animal poles of oocytes by the “blind” method of Colman (24Colman A. Hames B.D. Higgins S.J. Transcription and Translation: A Practical Approach. Oxford Press, Washington, D. C.1984: 49-69Google Scholar) using a digital microdispenser (Drummond Scientific, Broomwall, PA) loaded with a micropipette (10–15 mm tip size). The injected oocytes were singly placed in Corning cell wells (Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY) containing incubation medium (sterile MBS supplemented with 10 mg/liter streptomycin, 10,000 units/liter penicillin, 50 mg/liter gentamicin, 90 mg/liter theophylline, and 220 mg/liter pyruvate) and incubated at 15–19 °C. On days 1–4 after injection, oocytes were used in electrophysiological recording. Oocytes were placed in a rectangular chamber (approximately 100 μl volume) and perfused (2 ml min−1) with MBS with or without drugs, via a roller pump (Cole-Parmer Instrument Co., Chicago, IL) through 18-gauge polyethylene tubing (Clay Adams Co., Parsippany, NJ) that delivered the drug solutions to the recording chamber. The animal poles of oocytes were impaled with two glass electrodes (0.5–10 megohm) filled with 3m KCl and voltage-clamped at −70 mV using a Warner Instruments model OC-725A (Hamden, CT) oocyte clamp. A strip recorder (Cole-Parmer Instrument Co.) continuously plotted the clamping currents. Glycine was dissolved in MBS and applied for 20 s. All the experiments were performed at room temperature. The anesthetics (isoflurane, enflurane, and F3) and nonanesthetics (F6 and F8) (25Koblin D.D. Chortkoff B.S. Laster M.J. Eger II, E.I. Halsey M.J. Ionescu P. Anesth. Analg. 1994; 79: 1043-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) were pre-applied for 2 min to allow for complete equilibration in the bath before being co-applied with glycine for 20 s. A 5-min washout period was allowed between drug applications. Solutions of isoflurane and enflurane were prepared immediately before use. Saturated solutions of F3, F6, and F8 were obtained by 30-min bath sonication of 200 μl of each compound in 20 ml of MBS. These solutions were equilibrated in a sealed vial protected from light for at least 24 h before use. Final solutions of those compounds were prepared from saturated solution. Drugs were always tested against an EC5 concentration of glycine,i.e. a concentration of agonist giving 5% of the maximal response obtainable in that oocyte. The loss of concentration from vial to bath was approximately 50–60% for all volatile anesthetics tested (26Mihic S.J. McQuilkin S.J. Eger II, E.I. Ionescu P. Harris R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 851-857PubMed Google Scholar, 27Dildy-Mayfield J.E. Eger II, E.I. Harris R.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 1058-1065PubMed Google Scholar). All anesthetic and nonanesthetic compounds were tested at a concentration corresponding to 2 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) or the predicted 2 MAC for F6 and F8 in the final bath concentrations; that is, 0.64 mm for isoflurane, 1.24 mm for enflurane, 1.6 mm for F3, 35.6 μm for F6, and 17.6 μm for F8 (26Mihic S.J. McQuilkin S.J. Eger II, E.I. Ionescu P. Harris R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 851-857PubMed Google Scholar, 27Dildy-Mayfield J.E. Eger II, E.I. Harris R.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 1058-1065PubMed Google Scholar). Data were obtained from 4–12 oocytes taken from at least two different frogs. A single cDNA clone for each mutant was examined for experiments except for the α1-A288F, which was tested using two independently generated clones because of unexpected results. The results of two independent α1-A288F clones were exactly the same. The EC50 (agonist concentration for half-maximal response) values for concentration-response curves were calculated using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA), and linear and multiple regression analyses were carried out using StatView software (Abacus Concepts Inc., Berkeley, CA). The homomeric GlyRs composed of the α1 subunit mutated at Ala-288 displayed glycine-activated currents after expression in Xenopus oocytes, except for those substituted with proline, arginine, aspartate, or tryptophan (α1-A288P, A288R, A288D, and A288W, respectively), which produced little or no current in response to glycine (10 mm). However, the α1-A288D and A288W receptors produced outward currents when tested with 100 μm of the chloride-channel blocker picrotoxin, consistent with closure of channels that are tonically open in the absence of glycine. To determine the effects of mutations at Ala-288 on the apparent affinities for glycine, dose-response relationships for glycine of the wild-type and mutant GlyRs were examined (Table I, Fig.1 A ). The mutant receptors showed a wide range of apparent affinities for glycine. Substitution of Ala-288 with tyrosine (α1-A288Y) produced a receptor with the lowest EC50 value (1.0 μm) among all GlyRs, whereas replacement by phenylalanine (α1-A288F) exhibited the highest EC50 value (1015 μm). The mutant receptors with lower EC50 values (α1-A288Y, A288K, A288E, and A288G) produced small outward currents (100–800 nA) by 100 μm of picrotoxin. We analyzed the correlations between physicochemical properties (volume, polarity, hydropathy, and hydrophilicity) of the mutated amino acids and the EC50values for glycine of the resultant mutant GlyRs (TableII, Fig. 1, B–E ). For the hydropathy of the amino acid residues, the slope of linear regression was significantly different from 0 (p < 0.02) with ther 2 value of 0.29. The hydropathy is a measure in which the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of each amino acid side chain are taken into consideration (28Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar). No significant correlation was noted for the volume, polarity, or hydrophilicity. However, multiple regression analysis showed that the fitting of regression for the log EC50 was improved by combining the volume and hydropathy as two independents (p < 0.02,r 2 = 0.37), with regression coefficient values of −0.013 and 0.179, respectively (Table II, Fig. 1 F ). The importance of both volume and hydropathy in determining the EC50 values is especially indicated by the results of the α1-A288Y and A288F receptors. The EC50 values for glycine were drastically different between mutations with tyrosine (Y) and phenylalanine (F) which have large molecular volume and only differ in one hydroxyl group, whereas EC50 values were not so different between mutations with serine (S) and alanine (A), which also differ in a hydroxyl group but have small molecular volume.Table IThe EC50 and Hill coefficient values and the maximal current for the wild-type and mutant α1 GlyRsα1 GlyREC50Hill coefficientI maxμmnAA288Y1.01.1800–12,000A288K1.42.0880–14,000A288E8.31.51,200–18,500A288G141.71,600–25,000A288Q311.41,800–35,000A288M372.21,600–35,000A288H682.41,300–30,000A288N702.02,400–28,000A288I761.51,700–25,000A288L1541.52,200–19,500A288T1951.51,000–25,000A288V2431.71,300–23,000A288S2631.31,700–20,500Wild-type3332.11,800–34,000A288C8742.32,300–25,000A288F10152.511,000–42,500Concentration-response curves for glycine were examined for the wild-type and mutant α1 GlyRs (Fig. 1). The α1-A288P, A288R, A288D, and A288W receptors are not included because of little or no current response to glycine.

The data were normalized to the maximal current in each oocyte, and fitted according to the equation of the form:I = I max/[1 + (EC50/A )n], where I is current,I max is the maximal current recorded in a given oocyte, EC50 is the glycine concentration for half-maximal current response, A is the glycine concentration, andn is the Hill coefficient.

To determine whether size, polarity, hydropathy, or hydrophilicity of the mutated amino acid residues dictated the ability of volatile anesthetics to potentiate GlyR function, effects of anesthetics and nonanesthetics (nonimmobilizers) on the wild-type and mutant GlyRs were examined. Each compound was tested at concentrations corresponding to 2 MAC, and was preapplied before being coapplied with glycine. Preapplication of compounds in the absence of glycine did not produce any current response in both wild-type and mutant GlyRs, except for the α1-A288W receptor, which exhibited an outward current by application of isoflurane alone as described previously (10Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M.J. Koltchine V.V. Krasowski M.D. Finn S.E. Mascia M.P. Valenzuela C.F. Hanson K.K. Greenblatt E.P. Harris R.A. Harrison N.L. Nature. 1997; 389: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Because mutant receptors showed a wide range of apparent affinities for glycine, we standardized the experiment by using an EC5concentration of glycine in each case, i.e. a concentration of glycine that gave 5% of the maximal response obtained in that mutant receptor. The wild-type GlyR was effectively potentiated by volatile anesthetic isoflurane, whereas mutant receptors at Ala-288 generally exhibited less potentiation by isoflurane. The correlations of the isoflurane potentiation with physicochemical properties of the mutated amino acid side chains or the EC50 value of each receptor were analyzed (Fig. 2). We found a significant inverse correlation between the volume of amino acid side chain and the extent of potentiation by isoflurane. The slope of linear regression for the volume of the amino acid residues was significantly different from 0 (p < 0.0001) withr 2 = 0.73. On the other hand, no correlation was found between isoflurane responsiveness and the polarity, hydropathy, hydrophilicity of the amino acid residues, or log EC50values for glycine of mutant receptors. The fitting of regression for the potentiation by isoflurane was not improved by any combination of two properties of amino acid residues. Similarly, the extent of potentiation by enflurane and F3 was significantly correlated with the volume of amino acid side chain (p < 0.0001, r 2 = 0.75 for both enflurane and F3) but not with the polarity, hydropathy, hydrophilicity, or log EC50 values for glycine (Figs. 3 and 4).Figure 4Modulation by F3 of multiple Ala-288 mutants of the α1 GlyR .

The extent of potentiation by isoflurane was highly correlated with those by enflurane and F3 (p < 0.0001, r 2 = 0.98, and p < 0.0001, r 2 = 0.96, respectively), whereas no significant correlation was found between F3 and F6 (p > 0.12, r 2 = 0.16). In this investigation, we found that a series of single amino acid replacements at Ala-288 in the TM3 of the α1 GlyR subunit reduced the extent of potentiation of the resulting GlyRs by volatile anesthetics. Furthermore, we found that the molecular volume of the substituent at Ala-288 is highly correlated with the extent of anesthetic potentiation among mutant receptors in an inverse manner. These results suggest that the physical size of the residue at Ala-288 is a key regulator of the actions of volatile anesthetics on the GlyR. Because the extent of potentiation of each mutant receptor was highly correlated among isoflurane, enflurane, and F3, these volatile anesthetics may have a common mechanism of actions for the GlyR. It is likely that Ser-267 and Ala-288 do not line the ion-channel pore but may reside near the extracellular surface of the receptor (10Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M.J. Koltchine V.V. Krasowski M.D. Finn S.E. Mascia M.P. Valenzuela C.F. Hanson K.K. Greenblatt E.P. Harris R.A. Harrison N.L. Nature. 1997; 389: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 29Xu M. Akabas M.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and alanine is the second smallest amino acid residue next to glycine among all natural amino acids. Thus, our results on Ala-288 mutants are consistent with the hypothesis that volatile anesthetics exert their action on the GlyR by binding to a cavity or pocket near the extracellular surface of the receptor whose volume is determined in part by the size of the amino acid at position 288 in TM3. The mutations of Ala-288 significantly affected the apparent affinities of resulting mutant receptors for glycine, and this may be related to the mechanism by which anesthetics increase the apparent affinity for glycine. Because the agonist binding site of the GlyR subunit is proposed to reside in the amino-terminal domain (3Betz H. Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 458-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 4Bechade C. Sur C. Triller A. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 5Zafra F. Aragón C. Gimenez C. Mol. Neurobiol. 1997; 14: 117-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), altered apparent affinities of the mutant receptors for glycine may imply that amino acid residue 288 is involved in the transduction of agonist binding into channel opening but not agonist binding per se . Similarly, mutations of a critical amino acid residue Ser-270 in TM2 of the α2 GABAA receptor subunit (which corresponds to Ser-267 in TM2 of the α1 GlyR subunit) alter channel gating (30Koltchine V.V. Finn S.E. Jenkins A. Nikolaeva N. Lin A. Harrison N.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, both critical amino acid residues in TM2 and TM3 might reside on the transduction pathway responsible for converting agonist binding energy into channel opening. Furthermore, the efficacies of mutants in increasing glycine affinities depend on the volume and hydropathy of the substituted amino acid residues; residues with larger volume and less hydropathy exhibit higher affinities for glycine. The volume of the amino acid residue is also linked to channel gating at position 270 in TM2 of the α2 GABAA receptor subunit; mutants with a larger volume of side chains had higher affinities for glycine (30Koltchine V.V. Finn S.E. Jenkins A. Nikolaeva N. Lin A. Harrison N.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Because anesthetics increase the apparent affinities for agonists of the GlyR and GABAA receptors (8Downie D.L. Hall A.C. Lieb W.R. Franks N.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 26Mihic S.J. McQuilkin S.J. Eger II, E.I. Ionescu P. Harris R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 851-857PubMed Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that amino acid side chains at position 288 behave like anesthetics that have already bound to the position 288, thus changing the apparent affinity for glycine. In this context, physicochemical properties of side chains might reflect characteristics necessary for anesthetics to exert their effects after binding to the GlyR,i.e. larger volume and less hydropathy appear to be necessary for anesthetics after binding. This hypothesis is supported by the comparison of the molecular volume of isoflurane or F3 (140 or 127 Å 3J. R. Trudell, personal communication., respectively)3 with those of side chains of large amino acids such as tyrosine or tryptophan (side chain volumes 133 or 168 Å3, respectively) (31Harpaz Y. Gerstein M. Chothia C. Structure. 1994; 2: 641-649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the importance of a hydropathic component of anesthetics is consistent with the reports that complete halogenation or full halogenation of the end methyl groups of alkanes and ethers tends to decrease the anesthetic potencies of these agents and to enhance convulsant activity (32Koblin D.D. Eger II, E.I. Johnson B.H. Collins P. Harper M.H. Terrell R.C. Speers L. Anesthesiology. 1981; 54: 314-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 33Koblin D.D. Eger II, E.I. Johnson B.H. Collins P. Terrell R.C. Speers L. Anesth. Analg. 1981; 60: 464-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 34Burns T.H. Hall J.M. Bracken A. Gouldstone G. Anaesthesia. 1982; 37: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 35Rudo F.G. Krantz Jr., J.C. Br. J. Anaesth. 1974; 46: 181-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this context, it is of interest to compare the structurally related compounds F3 and F6. Both F3 (c(CClFCF2CH2CH2)) and F6 (c(CClFCClFCF2CF2)) are polyhalogenated cyclobutane derivatives soluble in lipids and should be potent anesthetics according to the Meyer-Overton hypothesis. However, only F3 produces anesthesia in vivo (25Koblin D.D. Chortkoff B.S. Laster M.J. Eger II, E.I. Halsey M.J. Ionescu P. Anesth. Analg. 1994; 79: 1043-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The wild-type α1 GlyR was potentiated by F3 but not by F6, indicating that the GlyR is a rational target for anesthetic actions. Because of the position of halogenation, F3 is considered to possess less hydropathy than F6 (36North C. Cafiso D.S. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1754-1761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,37Tang P. Yan B. Xu Y. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1676-1682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, the distinct action on the GlyR between F3 and F6 may be at least partly explained by their differences in hydropathy. Some of the mutations, especially the α1-A288F, converted the effects of anesthetics from enhancement of agonist responses to inhibition of responses. This observation is consistent with the effects of mutations of the α1 GlyR and the ρ1 GABA receptor on alcohol actions; some mutants at Ser-267 of the α1 GlyR, such as α1-S267F, S267Y, S267Q, were not potentiated but inhibited by alcohols, whereas the double mutation in TM2 and TM3 of the ρ1 GABA receptor (ρ1-I307S/W328A) changed the alcohol effects from inhibition to potentiation (21Wick M.J. Mihic S.J. Ueno S. Mascia M.P. Trudell J.R. Brozowski S.J. Ye Q. Harrison N.L. Harris R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6504-6509Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 38Ye Q. Koltchine V.V. Mihic S.J. Mascia M.P. Wick M.J. Finn S.E. Harrison N.L. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3314-3319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To explain the change in anesthetic effects from enhancement to inhibition, we hypothesize that the effects of mutations would be to change the relative affinity for anesthetics to bind to and stabilize the closed states of the channel relative to the open states in a manner dependent on the volume of amino acid residues at Ala-288 (38Ye Q. Koltchine V.V. Mihic S.J. Mascia M.P. Wick M.J. Finn S.E. Harrison N.L. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3314-3319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). As for nonanesthetics F6 and F8, only the α1-A288F mutant was strongly inhibited. A possible explanation is that F6 and F8 preferentially stabilize the closed states of the α1-A288F channel but do not bind to other α1 receptors (F6 and F8 are not antagonists of anesthetic actions on GlyRs 4T. Yamakura, S. J. Mihic, and R. A. Harris, unpublished data.). In any case, these hypotheses await further evaluation with single channel recording techniques. The two amino acid residues in TM2 and TM3 are critical for enhancement not only by volatile anesthetics but also by alcohols (10Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M.J. Koltchine V.V. Krasowski M.D. Finn S.E. Mascia M.P. Valenzuela C.F. Hanson K.K. Greenblatt E.P. Harris R.A. Harrison N.L. Nature. 1997; 389: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). The effects of ethanol on the α1 GlyR also depend upon the molecular volume of the substituents at position 267 in TM2; replacement of the Ser-267 residue with large residues resulted in inhibition (38Ye Q. Koltchine V.V. Mihic S.J. Mascia M.P. Wick M.J. Finn S.E. Harrison N.L. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3314-3319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). With regard to volatile anesthetics, others found a negative association between the molecular volume of the critical amino acid Ser-270 in TM2 of the α2 GABAA receptor subunit and the degree of enhancement of GABA responses by isoflurane (30Koltchine V.V. Finn S.E. Jenkins A. Nikolaeva N. Lin A. Harrison N.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Similar observations of the critical amino acid residues in TM2 and TM3 in terms of contribution of the molecular volume of amino acid residues to modulation of the GlyR and GABAA receptors by alcohols and anesthetics, as well as the involvement in channel gating, are consistent with the proposal that these small amino acid residues at the critical positions in TM2 and TM3 might contribute together to make a space for a binding cavity of volatile anesthetics and alcohols on both the GlyR and GABAA receptors. However, it is important to note the limitation of these types of studies. Even for effects of mutation on agonist binding to receptors, it is not easy to differentiate between effects on binding and effects on the transductional process (39Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar), and the same is true in anesthetic binding. Thus, at this time we cannot rule out the possibility that anesthetics bind elsewhere on the GlyR subunit and that the molecular volume at Ala-288 plays a critical role in transductional modifications by anesthetics. In summary, we studied mutations at a site (Ala-288) in TM3 near the extracellular surface of homomeric α1 GlyR and found marked effects on the ability of glycine to activate this receptor and on the actions of volatile anesthetics. In particular, large amino acids with low hydropathy mimicked the action of volatile anesthetics (increased apparent affinity of the receptor for glycine). Large amino acids also reduced or prevented the actions of volatile anesthetics but this was independent of amino acid hydropathy. We propose that anesthetics enhance GlyR function because they bind in the vicinity of position 288 and provide appropriate changes in molecular volume and hydropathy. A corollary to this proposal is that large amino acids at position 288 prevent access of anesthetics to this site. We appreciate the many helpful discussions of this work with Drs. Edmond I. Eger, II, Neil L. Harrison, and Jim R. Trudell."

Since the O2 sensor domain of FixL contains a heme as a prosthetic group, FixL is a member of heme-containing proteins (hemoproteins). The iron of the heme domain in FixL is in an equilibrium state between the O2-bound (oxy) and the O2-unbound (deoxy) states, in response to the O2 concentration (19Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Gonzalez G. Perutz M.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8067-8073Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). However, compared with other O2-binding hemoproteins, FixL is quite unique, since O2 ligation to the heme iron is directly coupled with the switching of the kinase activity in itself. The kinase is active when the heme domain is in the deoxy state, whereas it is deactivated when O2 is bound to the heme iron (6Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Gonzalez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16293-16297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, the heme-based O2 sensor FixL can be classified into a new class of hemoproteins (19Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Gonzalez G. Perutz M.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8067-8073Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). For the case of FixL, the signaling for the O2 association to/dissociation from the heme iron is transferred to its histidine kinase domain (20Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Gonzalez G. Perutz M.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Possibly, structural changes in the vicinity of the heme, caused by transition between the deoxy and oxy states, constitutes an initial event in O2 sensing, which is then followed by the intramolecular signal transduction from the heme to the histidine kinase site, thus regulating kinase activity. In order to understand better the O2-sensing mechanism in FixL, the structural changes of the heme environment induced by O2dissociation have been examined using bio- and physicochemical techniques. Recently, resonance Raman (21Rodgers K.R. Lukat-Rodgers G.S. Barron J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9539-9548Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22Lukat-Rodgers G.S. Rodgers K.R.

These studies have shown that the basic structure of the iron coordination is similar to that of hemoproteins such as myoglobin (Mb),1 but the environment around the iron sixth coordination site is different. However, these studies have yielded little direct structural information on the heme site of FixL resulting from the association or dissociation of O2. The relevance of the heme site coordination structure to the kinase activation is still not clear. Gilles-Gonzalez and co-workers (6Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Gonzalez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16293-16297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Gonzalez G. Perutz M.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) have measured the kinase activity of FixL in several iron oxidation, ligation, or spin states and found that the kinase domain is inactive in the low spin state of the heme iron, whereas it is active in the high spin state. Based on these observations, they proposed “the spin state” hypothesis, where activation/deactivation of the kinase site could occur through changes in the spin state of the heme iron. Most recently, they reported the crystal structure of the heme domain ofBradyrhizobium japonicum FixL (BjFixLH) in the ferric (Fe3+) and ferric-cyanide (Fe3+CN−) forms at 2.4 and 2.7 Å resolution, respectively. Based on structural comparison between these two states, it was suggested that the heme doming/flattening upon the ligand dissociation/association results in rearrangement of the hydrogen bond network between the heme 6,7-propionates and the “regulatory loop” and is possibly relevant to the activation/deactivation of the kinase domain (26Gong W. Hao B. Mansy S.S. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Chan M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15177-15182Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report Fe K-edge EXAFS (extended x-ray absorption fine structure) of FixL in several iron states, and we characterize its iron coordination structures in active and inactive forms of the kinase. The EXAFS provides structural information that is limited to the metal-ligand coordination site (bond distance and angle) but is more precise than crystallographic data. To support the EXAFS information, we also measured the resonance Raman spectra of the CO adduct of FixL. Based on these spectroscopic results, we examined the change in the iron coordination structure of FixL as this relates to the activation/deactivation mechanism of the kinase domain in FixL. A soluble truncated FixL (RmFixLT, monomer molecular mass of 43 kDa) and the heme-containing domain of FixL (RmFixLH, molecular mass of 17 kDa) of R. meliloti were overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain JM109. RmFixJ (monomer molecular mass of 23 kDa) was co-expressed with RmFixLT in the same system. Expression plasmid for RmFixLT was generated by subcloning of the Bam HI-Hin dIII fragment of thefixLJ genes (27Nakamura H. Saito K. Ito E. Tamura K. Tsuchiya T. Nishigaki K. Shiro Y. Iizuka T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with the Eco RI-Bam HI adapter into pUC18 at the Eco RI and Hin dIII sites. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the soluble FixL is MTMITNSGSV131. RmFixLH is the heme-binding domain of FixL, which lacks the transmembrane and the kinase domains. We constructed the expression system of RmFixLH in E. coli using thefixL DNA as follows. The Xho I and Xba I sites were filled in with Klenow fragment and ligated to introduce the stop codon (L260d-stop) after removal of the kinase domain. The filled-in Rsr II-Kpn I DNA fragment encoding the heme domain and FixJ was joined to the filled-inNhe I-Kpn I fragment of pRSET vector to generate the 6× His-tagged N-terminal sequence, MRGSH6GMART128. To obtain the (RmFixLT)2(RmFixJ)2 complex, 100 g of the E. coli cell body was dissolved in 500 ml of 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After lysis, clear supernatant was obtained by ultracentrifugation at 300,000 × g for 1.5 h. The supernatant was applied to a series of anion exchange chromatographies as follows: DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) packed in XK50 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), Hiload 26/10 Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and Mono-Q 16/10 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), in this order. The anion exchange columns were first equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The loaded sample was eluted with a linear gradient of buffer B (50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.4 mNaCl). The fractions containing RmFixLT/RmFixJ were eluted at around 0.2 m NaCl. The fractions having RmFixLT was separated from the RmFixLT·RmFixJ complex using HiLoad 26/10 Superdex 200 gel chromatography column with buffer C (50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 10%(v/v) glycerol, and 0.2 m NaCl). All purification procedures were done at 4 °C. The chemical purity of the sample was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using Phastsystem (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the course of the purification. Eluant fractions were merged and concentrated to 10 μm. The purification procedure of RmFixLH was described elsewhere (28Miyatake H. Kanai M. Adachi S. Nakamura H. Tamura K. Tanida H. Tsuchiya T. Iizuka T. Shiro Y. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1999; 55: 1215-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The purity of the protein was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The ratio of absorbances at 280 and 416 nm (Soret band), A 280 nm/A Soret, in the oxy form was 0.79 for the RmFixLT·RmFixJ complex and 0.56 for the RmFixJ-free RmFixLT, showing that the heme is not largely removed from the protein by the gel filtration. Horse heart myoglobin in the lyophilized form (Sigma) was dissolved in 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) and then applied to the cation exchange column (CM52; Whatman) equilibrated with the same buffer and developed with the gradient of the 5 mm phosphate (pH 6.0) and 50 mm K2HPO4. Dynamic light scattering of the protein was measured using DynaPro-MS (Protein Solutions). For this measurement, a beam of monochromatic light was directed into the sample to monitor fluctuation of light intensity scattered by the molecule. From analyses of the data, the translational diffusion coefficient, DT (nm2/s), of the protein particle in solution was obtained. Assuming Brownian motion, this coefficient was converted to the Hydrodynamic Radius,R H, of the protein particle using the Stokes-Einstein Equation 1,RH=kbT/6πηDTEquation 1 where k b (J /K ) represents Boltzman's constants, T (K) the absolute temperature in Kelvin, and η (Pa·s) the solvent viscosity. The hydrodynamic molecular weight of the protein particle can be estimated from the R H. The sample condition for the dynamic light scattering measurement was 10 μm(RmFixLT)2(RmFixJ)2 in 50 mmTris/HCl (pH 8.5), 10% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2m NaCl at 20 °C. In the measurement of the ferrous deoxy, ferrous O2, and ferrous CO complexes, β-mercaptoethanol was present in the system. For the Fe K-edge EXAFS measurement, we prepared the ferrous deoxy, ferrous CO, ferrous O2 (oxy), ferric (met), ferric fluoride (metF−), and ferric cyanide (metCN−) forms of the (RmFixLT)2(RmFixJ)2 complex. The iron concentration of the samples was less than 1 mm for RmFixLT, because it precipitated when RmFixLT was concentrated over 1 mm. In addition, the ferrous CO complexes of RmFixLH (2 mm) and the O2, deoxy, and CO complexes of Mb (8 mm) were also prepared. The samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen in Perspex EXAFS cells with Mylar windows. The EXAFS measurements were carried out using synchrotron radiation at Station 8.1 of the synchrotron radiation source of Daresbury Laboratory (UK) and at BL12C of Photon Factory of KEK (Japan) (29Nomura M. Koyama A. KEK Report. 1996; : 15-95Google Scholar, 30Nomura M. KEK Report. 1998; : 4-98Google Scholar). All measurements were carried out at liquid nitrogen temperature in the fluorescence mode using multi-element germanium detector. Each EXAFS scan took approximately 1 h. Due to the low concentration of iron in the samples, it took 20–24 h to obtain good quality EXAFS data for the RmFixLT complexes, by averaging. After calibration of monochromator position to energy, the EXAFS was normalized to a unit iron atom and extracted from the background absorption using the Daresbury Laboratory program EXBACK (31Morrell C. Baines J.T.M. Campbell J.W. Diakun G.P. Dobson B.R. Greaves G.N. Hasnain S.S. EXBACK: EXAFS User's Manual. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1989Google Scholar). The EXAFS data were converted into k space usingk = (2 m e(E −E 0)/h2)]1/2, whereE and E 0 are the energy of the incident x-ray radiation and the absorption edge of the iron atom, respectively, and k is the photoelectron wave vector. The fitting of the data was performed using the non-linear least squares program EXCURV92 (32Binsted N. Gurman S.J. Campbell J.W. Stephenson P. EXCURV92: SERC. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1991Google Scholar), which calculates the theoretical EXAFS function using fast curved wave theory and incorporates multiple scattering up to 3rd order (33Gurman S.J. Binsted N. Ross I. Journal of Physics C: Solid-State Physics. 1984; C 17: 143-151Crossref Scopus (781) Google Scholar, 34Gurman S.J. Binsted N. Ross I. J. Physics C Solid-state Physics. 1986; 19: 1845-1861Crossref Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Phase shifts were calculated using the Hedin-Lundqvist approximation (35Hedin L. Lundqvist S. Solid State Physics. 1969; 23: 1Google Scholar). Curve fitting was carried out ink space on raw EXAFS data weighted byk 3 to compensate for the diminishing amplitude of the EXAFS at high k . Constrained and restrained refinement procedures were used to minimize the number of free parameters in the least squares analysis (36Hasnain S.S. Strange R.W. Hasnain S.S. Recent Advances in XAFS Data Analysis. Ellis Horwood Ltd., Chichester, UK1990: 104-122Google Scholar, 37Binsted N. Strange R.W. Hasnain S.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12117-12125Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The quality of the simulations was assessed by the least squares fit index and R factor (37Binsted N. Strange R.W. Hasnain S.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12117-12125Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The most important information obtained by the fitting procedures were the radial distances of the inner shell ligands in the iron coordination sphere (Fe-Npyr, Fe-Nim, Fe-ligand, and Fe-Ct ), where the d (Fe-Ct ) represents the distance of the iron from the center of the pyrrole plane (iron displacement). The errors in the structural parameters deduced from EXAFS analysis arise from the data collection (e.g. photon counting statistics or sample inhomogeneity) and the subsequent data analysis (e.g. uncertainties in the EXAFS theory used or the quality of the background subtraction). For the FixL and Mb spectra, estimates of the errors are ±0.02 Å for the first shell distances of the Npyr and the sixth ligand atom and ±0.03 Å for the histidine ligand. The Debye-Waller factors for atoms belonging to the same ligand were found to increase systematically with their distance from the iron atom. The resonance Raman spectra were measured with a single spectrophotometer (JASCO NR-1800) equipped with a cooled charge-coupled device (Princeton Instruments). The excitation sources were Kr+ laser (Coherent) at 406.7 and 413.1 nm. The Raman cell was spinning and kept below 10 °C by flushing with cold N2 gas. Prior to Fe K-edge EXAFS measurements, the solution states of RmFixLT were checked using the dynamic light scattering technique. Fig.1 shows the results for RmFixLT in the met (Fe3+) state in the presence or absence of RmFixJ, which show the distribution of R H (hydrodynamic radius) of the protein in the solution. This measurement indicated thatR H of RmFixLT (RmFixJ-free form; bold line in Fig. 1) is widely distributed and that the average molecular mass estimated from the R H value is about 300 kDa, suggesting that RmFixLT is highly and randomly aggregated in the solution, since the molecular mass of monomeric RmFixLT is 43 kDa. On the other hand, the RmFixLT·RmFixJ complex gives the result shown in Fig. 1 (thin line ), in which the distribution of theR H is narrow and the average molecular mass is 130 kDa. The same results were obtained for the metF−, deoxy, oxy (Fe2+O2), and CO (Fe2+CO) forms of RmFixLT (data not shown). These results suggest that the RmFixLT·RmFixJ complex is mono-dispersive in the solution and is most probably in the heterotetrameric form, (RmFixLT)2(RmFixJ)2, since the monomer molecular mass of RmFixJ is 23 kDa. The (RmFixLT)2(RmFixJ)2 in the met, metF−, oxy, and CO states are stable at 10 °C, since their dynamic light scattering patterns were unchanged for several hours after the purification. The deoxy form was stable in the tetrameric form for 30 min after the fresh preparation under anaerobic condition but gradually aggregated afterward. Therefore, we prepared the EXAFS samples immediately after the preparations. In view of the results of the light scattering measurements, EXAFS studies were carried out on the (RmFixLT)2(RmFixJ)2 complex to investigate the iron coordination structure of RmFixLT, since the (RmFixLT)2(RmFixJ)2 complex is apparently more intact than the aggregated RmFixLT. Fig.2 a shows the EXAFS data and their Fourier transforms for RmFixLTs in the oxy, CO, and deoxy forms. Also shown are the corresponding data for horse heart myoglobin. The clear similarity between these spectra for each pair of samples implies a general structural equivalence between their iron coordination sites. From this observation it was anticipated, for example, that the iron atom in deoxy RmFixLT is displaced from the porphyrin plane, as is the case for deoxy Mb (38Yang F. Phillips Jr., G.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 762-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The detailed curve-fitting of the deoxy RmFixLT EXAFS confirmed this observation. We have also examined the Fe K-edge EXAFS for the met, metF−, and metCN− complexes (Fig.2 b ). The strategy used in the data analysis was to adopt the relevant model for the iron coordination site for the RmFixLT samples that is known, by crystallography (39Takano T. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 110: 537-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), to hold true for Mb. The three-dimensional crystallographic information on Mb was simplified, and an averaged (“idealized”) structure of the porphyrin ring, the sixth ligand (CO, O2), and the imidazole ring of the histidine ligand were constructed. The application of restraints guaranteed the structural integrity of these ligands throughout the fitting procedure and also ensured that the refinements remained overdetermined. These features of the data analysis method are described in detail elsewhere (37Binsted N. Strange R.W. Hasnain S.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12117-12125Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) for the EXAFS of fetal deoxy Mb.

Values in parentheses are Deby-Waller factors of the ligand atom coordinating iron. In our EXAFS analyses of RmFixLT, the best fit of the theoretical curves to the raw data was obtained in all cases when the imidazole ring was placed at the iron axial position in all states, indicating coordination of the histidyl imidazole to the heme iron of RmFixLT as the fifth axial ligand. The result agrees with the previous resonance Raman and NMR spectroscopic results (23Bertolucci C. Ming L.J. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 561-566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 25Tamura K. Nakamura H. Tanaka Y. Oue S. Tsukamoto K. Shiro Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 39: 9434-9535Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and confirms initial structural expectations based on similarity with the EXAFS of Mb. In the mutagenesis study, replacement of His-194 with other amino acid residues lost the heme in RmFixL (16Monson E.K. Weinstein M. Ditta G.S. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4280-4284Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 27Nakamura H. Saito K. Ito E. Tamura K. Tsuchiya T. Nishigaki K. Shiro Y. Iizuka T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), indicating that His-194 is a proximal ligand of RmFixL (proximal His-194). Indeed, the recent crystallographic study of BjFixLH (26Gong W. Hao B. Mansy S.S. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Chan M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15177-15182Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) clearly showed coordination of His-200 to the heme iron, where His-200 of BjFixL corresponds to His-194 of RmFixL. The bond length between the iron and the histidyl imidazole nitrogen,d (Fe-Nim), falls into the range of 2.01–2.11 Å, depending on the iron ligation, oxidation, and spin states. Comparison of the d (Fe-Nim) evaluated by the EXAFS for deoxy RmFixLT and deoxy Mb (Table I, bottom part) indicated that the Fe-N(His-194) bond length in deoxy RmFixLT (2.11Å) was the same as that of the Fe-N(His-93) bond in deoxy Mb (2.11Å). On the other hand, the resonance Raman study indicated that the Fe-N(His-194) stretching of deoxy RmFixLT (209 cm−1) is lower than the Fe-N(His-93) stretching frequency of deoxy Mb (220 cm−1) and therefore suggests that the Fe-N(His-194) bond in deoxy RmFixLT is weaker than the Fe-N(His-93) of deoxy Mb (25Tamura K. Nakamura H. Tanaka Y. Oue S. Tsukamoto K. Shiro Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 39: 9434-9535Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). One possible explanation of the apparent discrepancy between the EXAFS and the resonance Raman results is distortion of the Fe-imidazole bond in RmFixLT, compared with that in Mb. Bond distortion causes different bonding-antibonding interactions between the imidazole nitrogen p π-orbital and the iron d π-orbitals, resulting in the differences in the strength of the Fe-N(His) bond between FixL and Mb. The iron displacement relative to the heme plane, d (Fe-Ct), is also dependent on the iron spin states; in the oxy, CO, and metCN− forms (low spin state), the iron is located in the heme plane (in-plane configuration), whereas it is displaced by 0.44 ± 0.06 and 0.55 ± 0.06 Å from the heme plane (out-of-plane configuration) in the met and deoxy forms (high spin state), respectively. The results are consistent with the general properties of hemoproteins in that the high spin iron is of considerably larger covalent radius than the low spin iron (40Scheidt W.R. Gouterman M. Lever A.B.P. Gray H.B. Iron Porphyrin Part II. Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA1982: 89-14"
https://openalex.org/W2072507242,"Although the deaminoneuraminic acid or KDN glycotope (2-keto-3-deoxy-d-glycero -d-galacto -nononic acid) is expressed in glycoconjugates that range in evolutionary diversity from bacteria to man, there is little information as to how this novel sugar is synthesized. Accordingly, biosynthetic studies were initiated in trout testis, an organ rich in KDN, to determine how this sialic acid is formed. These studies have shown that the pathway consists of the following three sequential reactions: 1) Man + ATP → Man-6-P + ADP; 2) Man-6-P + PEP → KDN-9-P + Pi; 3) KDN-9-P → KDN + Pi. Reaction 1, catalyzed by a hexokinase, is the 6-O -phosphorylation of mannose to formd-mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P). Reaction 2, catalyzed by KDN-9-phosphate (KDN-9-P) synthetase, condenses Man-6-P and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to form KDN-9-P. Reaction 3, catalyzed by a phosphatase, is the dephosphorylation of KDN-9-P to yield free KDN. It is not known if a kinase specific for Man (Reaction 1) and a phosphatase specific for KDN-9-P (Reaction 3) may exist in tissues actively synthesizing KDN. In this study, the KDN-9-P synthetase, an enzyme that has not been previously described, was identified as at least one key enzyme that is specific for the KDN biosynthetic pathway. This enzyme was purified 50-fold from rainbow trout testis and characterized. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be about 80,000, and activity was maximum at neutral pH in the presence of Mn2+. N -Acetylneuraminic acid 9-phosphate (Neu5Ac-9-P) synthetase, which catalyzes the condensation ofN -acetyl-d-mannosamine 6-phosphate and phosphoenol-pyruvate to produce Neu5Ac-9-P, was co-purified with the KDN-9-P synthetase. Substrate competition experiments revealed, however, that syntheses of KDN-9-P and Neu5Ac-9-P were catalyzed by two separate synthetase activities. The significance of these studies takes on added importance with the recent discovery that the level of free KDN is elevated in human fetal cord but not matched adult red blood cells and in ovarian cancer cells (Inoue, S., Lin, S-L., Chang, T., Wu, S-H., Yao, C-W., Chu, T-Y., Troy, F. A., II, and Inoue, Y. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 27199–27204). This unexpected finding emphasizes the need to understand more fully the role that free KDN and KDN-glycoconjugates may play in normal hematopoiesis and malignancy.

This unexpected finding emphasizes the need to understand more fully the role that free KDN and KDN-glycoconjugates may play in normal hematopoiesis and malignancy. 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-glycero -d-galacto -nononic acid or deaminated neuraminic acid KDN 9-phosphate 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene dithiothreitol d-mannose 6-phosphate N -acetyl-d-mannosamine N -acetyl-d-mannosamine 6-phosphate 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid phosphoenolpyruvate sialic acids N -acetylneuraminic acid N -acyl neuraminic acid high performance liquid chromatography matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight The deaminoneuraminic acid residue KDN1(2-keto-3-deoxy-d-glycero -d-galacto -nononic acid) is a distinct member of the sialic acids that shares many features in common with N -acylneuraminic acids (Neu5Acyl), including variations in the α-ketosidic linkages to the penultimate sugar residues and their occurrence in vertebrate glycoproteins (1Nadano D.

In marked contrast, nothing is known concerning how the KDN monosaccharide is synthesized. Two pathways are possible for synthesis of the KDN monomer. First, it could be formed directly from Neu5Ac by deacylation and deamination. Alternatively, it could arise by de novo synthesis via enzymes different from those required for synthesis of Neu5Ac. However, no evidence for the direct conversion of Neu5Ac to KDN has been obtained in any tissue homogenates examined to date. Thus,de novo synthesis by a separate pathway appears to be plausible by analogy with synthesis of other ulosonic acids. For example, 3-deoxy-d-arabino -heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate, a biosynthetic precursor of aromatic amino acids (32Srinivasan P.R. Sprinson D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 716-722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 3-deoxy-d-manno -octulosonic acid, a constituent of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (33Levin D.H. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 2532-2539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Ray P.H. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 635-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Neu5Ac (35Watson D.R. Jourdian G.W. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 5627-5636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are synthesized through a series of similar reactions involving a condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and the relevant sugar phosphates, either erythrose 4-phosphate for 3-deoxy-d-arabino -heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate, arabinose 5-phosphate for 3-deoxy-d-manno -octulosonic acid 8-phosphate, orN -acetylmannosamine 6-phosphate (ManNAc-6-P) for Neu5Ac 9-phosphate. Accordingly, the de novo biosynthesis of KDN is hypothesized to involve the condensation of PEP and mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P), giving rise to KDN 9-phosphate (KDN-9-P). Two additional reactions, the 6-O -phosphorylation of mannose (Man) and the dephosphorylation of KDN-9-P would presumably be required for KDN synthesis if Man and PEP were the intracellular substrates. It is conceivable, however, that these two reactions could be catalyzed by intracellular hexokinases and phosphatases, two ubiquitously occurring enzymes known to have broad substrate specificities (36Lazarus N.R. Ramel A.H. Rustum Y.M. Barnard E.A. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 4003-4016Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 37Fernley H.N. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. IV. Academic Press, New York1971: 417-447Google Scholar). Thus, the purpose of this study was to elucidate the biosynthesis of the KDN monomer in rainbow trout ovaries and testis, tissues rich in expressing KDN-containing glycoconjugates (6Kanamori A.

Our initial studies have led to the discovery of a KDN-9-P synthetase, an activity that condenses Man-6-P and PEP in cytosolic fractions from both tissues. This activity was purified more than 50-fold from testis. Substrate competition experiments were used to show that the KDN-9-P synthetase activity was distinct from Neu5Ac-9-P synthetase, an activity responsible for condensing ManNAc-6-P and PEP. [1-14C]Man (2.07 GBq/mmol) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. 1,2-Diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene (DMB), CMP-Neu5Ac, ATP, hexokinase (bakers' yeast), and N -acetylneuraminic acid aldolase from Escherichia coli were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Japan). Sodium phosphoenolpyruvate, alkaline phosphatase from calf intestine, and Man-6-P were purchased from Sigma. Mannosamine hydrochloride was purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Japan). CMP-KDN and KDN were prepared as described previously (25Terada T. Kitazume S. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Ito F. Troy F.A. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2640-2648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Angata T. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Rainbow trout ovaries, testes, and liver were collected a month before ovulation or spermiation. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. Ovaries and testes (2 g each) were homogenized separately in 2 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.1m NaCl using a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica, Switzerland). One ml of each homogenate was mixed with 4 ml of water and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatants were collected and designated the “cytosolic fraction.” The precipitates were extracted serially with chloroform:methanol, 2:1 (v/v) and 1:2 (v/v), as described previously (21Song Y. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21929-21935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extract and the resultant precipitate were designated as the “lipid fraction” and the “protein fraction,” respectively. The lipid and protein fractions were each resuspended in 0.1 mtrifluoroacetic acid and heated at 80 °C for 30 min. After removal of any particulate material by brief centrifugation, the hydrolysates (designated as the lipid- and protein-bound Sia fractions, respectively) were derivatized with DMB. The cytosolic fractions were ultrafiltered through Microcon 10 (Amicon) to remove high molecular weight materials (M r > 10,000), and the filtrates (designated the “free Sia fraction”) were derivatized with DMB. 2Colorimetric quantitation of free Sia by the thiobarbituric acid method also gave the same results with a 5% error for the filtrates obtained after passage through YM10 (M r > 10,000) or YM5 (M r> 5,000). CMP-sialic acids were not detected in the filtrates from ovaries when examined on a Resourse Q anion-exchange HPLC. In rainbow trout ovary and testis, only free Sia was detected in the lowM r region (<5,000) after Sephacryl S-200 chromatography of the cytosolic fractions. Thus, we conclude that >95% of the Sia in the filtrates existed as the free sugar acid. The DMB derivatization of Sia and their analysis on the reverse phase HPLC (the DMB fluorometric HPLC method) were carried out as described previously (5Inoue S. Kitajima K. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24341-24344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In brief, the sample (20 μl) in 40 mmtrifluoroacetic acid was mixed with 20 μl of 7 mm DMB in 5 mm trifluoroacetic acid, 1 m2-mercaptoethanol, and 18 mm sodium hydrosulfite and incubated at 50 °C for 2 h. Ten-μl portions of the reaction mixture were applied to a TSK gel ODS-120T (4.6 × 250 mm) column and eluted with acetonitrile:methanol:water (6:4:90, v/v/v), on a JASCO LC-900 HPLC system equipped with a JASCO FP-920 fluorescence detector (excitation, 373 nm; emission, 448 nm) operating isocratically at 1.0 ml/min at a column temperature of 26 °C. DMB derivatives of KDN and Neu5Ac were well separated by HPLC and quantitatively determined in the pmol–nmol range. The free Sia fractions described above were analyzed. This fraction (derived from 10 mg of tissue) was subjected to pyridylamination (40Kondo A. Suzuki J. Kuriyama N. Hase S. Kato I. Ikenaka T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1990; 54: 2169-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) using GlycoTAG (Takara, Japan) according to instructions provided by the manufacturer. The pyridylaminated sugars were separated by a HPLC on PALPAK Type A column (4.6 × 150 mm; Takara, Japan) and quantitated with an integrator connected to a spectrofluorometer (821-FP, JASCO, Japan) (excitation, 310 nm; emission, 380 nm). The column was eluted with 0.7 mpotassium borate, pH 9.0:acetonitrile (9:1, v/v) at 65 °C at 0.4 ml/min for 200 min. [14C]Man-6-P was prepared as described previously (36Lazarus N.R. Ramel A.H. Rustum Y.M. Barnard E.A. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 4003-4016Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). From [14C]Man (0.925 MBq, about 0.45 μmol) and ATP (2.5 μmol), 0.43 μmol of [14C]Man-6-P was prepared. A reference standard of [14C]KDN-9-P was synthesized by incubating [14C]Man-6-P (9.25 KBq, 4.5 nmol) and sodium pyruvate (1 μmol) with 0.5 unit ofN -acetylneuraminic acid aldolase in 100 μl of 50 mm MES, pH 7.0, containing 0.01% NaN3 at 37 °C for 100 h. The reaction mixture, which contained both [14C]KDN-9-P and unreacted [14C]Man-6-P, was ultrafiltered through Microcon 10 and used as a reference standard for TLC analysis. The yield of [14C]KDN-9-P was about 10%. A large scale preparation of KDN-9-P was synthesized by incubating Man-6-P (5 μmol) and sodium pyruvate (25 μmol) with 1 unit of N -acetylneuraminic acid aldolase in 250 μl of 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.01% NaN3 at 37 °C for 144 h. The reaction mixture was ultrafiltered through Microcon 10, and the filtrate was applied to a Mono-Q HR 5/5 column connected to an HPLC system (Irica, Japan). The column was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–0.25 m) in 10 mm monoethanolamine-HCl, pH 8.5, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions positive for thiobarbituric acid method (41Uchida Y. Tsukada Y. Sugimori T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1977; 82: 1425-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), eluting around 130 mm NaCl, were collected and desalted by chromatography on a Sephadex G-10 column (1.0 × 40 cm). The yield was about 10%. ManNAc-6-P was synthesized as described previously by Jourdian and Roseman (42Jourdian G.W. Roseman S. Coon M.J. Biochemical Preparations. 9. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1962: 44-47Google Scholar). From 0.1 mmol of mannosamine hydrochloride, 0.03 mmol of Man NAc-6-P was prepared through phosphorylation by hexokinase using 0.1 mmol of ATP and the subsequent acetylation. Three g of trout ovaries and testes were separately homogenized in 3 ml of homogenization buffer (50 mm MES, pH 7.0, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 2 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A) in a Polytron homogenizer and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The resulting supernatant was used as the cytosolic fraction. For the KDN-9-P synthetase assay, 4 μl of the substrate mixture containing 40 nmol each of PEP and Man-6-P and 2 nmol of sodium vanadate (a phosphatase inhibitor) were added to 16 μl of the cytosolic fractions and incubated at 25 °C for 24 h. Each incubation mixture received 5 μl of alkaline phosphatase (30 units of enzyme in 2 μmol of glycine buffer, pH 10.0, containing 250 nmol of MgCl2), further incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to dephosphorylate the reaction products, and analyzed for KDN by the DMB fluorometric HPLC method (see above). For the assay for hexokinase activity, 4 μl of substrate containing 40 nmol of [14C]Man (150 Bq/nmol), 100 nmol of ATP, 200 nmol of MgCl2, and 10 nmol of sodium vanadate were added to 16 μl of the cytosolic fraction and incubated at 25 °C for 24 h. The reaction mixture was analyzed for [14C]Man-6-P by using a cellulose TLC as described under “Quantitative Assay for KDN-9-P Synthetase and Neu5Ac-9-P Synthetase Activities.” For the phosphatase assay, 4 μl of KDN-9-P (20 nmol) were mixed with 16 μl of the cytosolic fraction and incubated at 25 °C for 24 h. The reaction mixtures were analyzed for KDN by the DMB fluorometric HPLC method (see above). All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Five g of mature rainbow trout testes that had been frozen immediately after collection and stored at −80 °C were thawed, minced, and homogenized in a Polytron homogenizer in 20 ml of homogenization buffer (50 mm MES, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, and 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A). The homogenate was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min, and the supernatant was applied to a DEAE-Toyopearl 650M column (Tosoh, Japan; Cl− form, 2 × 4 cm). The column was washed with 25 ml of 50 mm MES, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm DTT and 10% glycerol. The flow-through and wash fractions were combined and brought to 70% saturation with solid ammonium sulfate, stirred for 30 min, and centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 30 min. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 90% saturation, stirred for 30 min, and centrifuged again at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet, designated AS70-90, was dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.0, containing 1 mm DTT and 10% glycerol and desalted on a minicolumn of Sephadex G-25 (PD-10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The eluate was applied to a Poros HQ plastic column (Perseptive Biosystems) and eluted with 20 ml of a linear NaCl gradient (0–0.25 m) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol. Fractions that contained the enzyme activity, which eluted between 125–160 mm NaCl, were collected. For quantitative determination of the amount of enzyme activity, the following procedure was carried out. Enzyme fractions were first desalted, and the buffer was exchanged with 50 mm MES, pH 7.0, containing 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A by ultrafiltration using Microcon 10. To 20 μl of the enzyme fraction 5 μl of the substrate were added, either 25 mm Man-6-P (for KDN-9-P synthetase) or 5 mm ManNAc-6-P (for Neu5Ac-9-P synthetase). Each substrate also contained 25 mm PEP and 10 mmMnCl2. After incubation at 25 °C for 20 or 30 min, the mixture was boiled for 3 min. Five μl of alkaline phosphatase (30 units) in 0.5 m glycine-NaOH buffer, pH 10.0, and 60 mm MgCl2 were added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. With this incubation, quantitative dephosphorylation was attained. Trifluoroacetic acid was added, and the final concentration of trifluoroacetic acid and sample volume was adjusted to 40 mm and 100 μl, respectively. The sample was ultrafiltered through Microcon 10, and the filtrate was analyzed for the amount of KDN and Neu5Ac by the DMB fluorometric HPLC analysis, as described above. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to synthesize 1 nmol of KDN-9-P or Neu5Ac-9-P/h at 25 °C. For monitoring the elution profile of the KDN-9-P synthetase activity in the column chromatography fractions, the assay was routinely carried out as follows. Enzyme fractions were prepared as described above. To each enzyme fraction (5 μl) was added [14C]Man-6-P (330 Bq, 160 pmol), PEP (20 nmol), MnCl2 (10 nmol), and sodium vanadate (1 nmol). The final volume was adjusted to 10 μl with water. After incubation at 25 °C for 20 h, 2 μl of alkaline phosphatase (1.5 to 7.5 units) in 1.2 μmol of glycine-NaOH buffer, pH 10.0, containing 120 nmol of MgCl2 were added, and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 to 60 min. Three μl of each sample were spotted onto plastic-backed cellulose TLC plate (Merck) and developed in 1-propanol, 1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, water (7:1:2, v/v/v) for 8 h (43Zeitler R. Giannis A. Danneschewski S. Henk E. Henk T. Bauer C. Reutter W. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 1165-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). When the effect of ionic strength was determined, the samples were spotted on Whatman No. 3MM paper and developed for 12 h in the same propanol:sodium acetate solvent noted above. Radioactivity was visualized and quantitatively determined using the Fujix BAS-2000 Imaging Analyzer (Fuji Photo Film, Japan). Man-6-P and PEP (2.5 μmol each) were incubated with the AS70-90 fraction (20 units) in 250 μl of 50 mm MES, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm MnCl2, and 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A. After incubation at 25 °C for 24 h, a flocculent precipitate that appeared was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was ultrafiltered through Microcon 10. The filtrate was applied to a Mono-Q HR 5/5 HPLC, and the thiobarbituric acid method-positive material was recovered and purified, as described under “Preparative Synthesis of KDN-9-P and ManNAc-6-P.” This compound and its alkaline phosphatase-treated derivative were analyzed by the DMB fluorometric HPLC method. The alkaline phosphatase-treated derivative was prepared by the Mono-Q HPLC of the compound after incubation at 37 °C for 3 h with the enzyme (10 units) in 30 μl of 0.1 m glycine buffer, pH 10.0, containing 10 mm MgCl2. The purified product and its dephosphorylated derivative were also analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The product (10 pmol) was mixed with 20 μl of 2,5-dihydrobenzoic acid (2,5-DHB) in water, and 1 μl of the sample was applied onto a gold target. After drying, the sample was analyzed on a Voyager Elite MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry system (PerSeptive Biosystems) with a nitrogen laser (337 nm) in negative ion mode at an accelerating potential of 12 kV. The apparent molecular weight of KDN-9-P synthetase was estimated by Sephacryl S-300 chromatography of the AS70-90 fraction (10 units). The column (1.4 × 100 cm) was eluted with 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.5, containing 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol and calibrated using the gel filtration molecular weight standard kit (Bio-Rad). Fractions (2.4 ml) were collected and assayed for KDN-9-P synthetase activity by the routine assay, as described above. For determining the following properties of KDN-9-P synthetase, the enzyme activity was measured according to the routine assay (described above) using the AS70-90 enzyme fraction (0.3 unit), with varied conditions. The enzyme fraction was desalted by ultrafiltration using Microcon 10 and dissolved in 2 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A. This was mixed immediately with an equal volume of 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2 to 9.0, or 100 mm MES, pH 5.5–7.0. The ionic strength of each buffer was adjusted to 0.1 by the addition of NaCl. To determine the effect of the ionic strength on KDN-9-P synthetase activity, the concentration of NaCl in the different incubation mixtures was varied from 0 to 1.0m. Divalent cations were depleted from the enzyme fraction by incubation on ice for 60 min with 5 mm EDTA in 100 mm MES, pH 7.0, containing 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A. The mixture was ultrafiltered to remove EDTA and resuspended in the above buffer devoid of EDTA. Enzyme activity assays were carried out after addition of the following salts (1 mm) and preincubation for 30 min on ice: MgCl2, CaCl2, MnCl2, FeSO4, CoCl2, NiCl2, CuCl2, and ZnCl2. Twenty μl of the AS70-90 enzyme fraction (1.1 unit), dissolved in 50 mm MES buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A were mixed with 5 μl of substrate containing 50 nmol of MnCl2, 125 nmol of PEP, and 25 to 125 nmol of Man-6-P or 2.5 to 50 nmol of ManNAc-6-P. After incubation at 25 °C for 20 min, the reaction was terminated by heating at 100 °C for 3 min. Five μl of alkaline phosphatase (30 units) in 2.4 μmol of glycine buffer, pH 10.0, containing 300 nmol of MgCl2 were then added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Trifluoroacetic acid was added to terminate each reaction. The final concentration of trifluoroacetic acid and sample volume was adjusted to 40 mm and 100 μl, respectively. The samples were ultrafiltered through Microcon 10, and the amount of KDN or Neu5Ac in the filtrates was quantitatively determined by the DMB"

Transport by GAT-1 is sensitive to the polar sulfhydryl reagent 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate.

Tyrosine 140 appears to be involved in the binding of GABA, possibly in the liganding of the amino group, the moiety common to all neurotransmitters (11Bismuth Y. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16096-16102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). GAT-1 is sensitive to sulfhydryl reagents (12Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This suggests that one or more cysteines may play a critical role in the transport process or else are located in the vicinity of other critical residues. One of these cysteines, located at position 74, has recently been identified (12Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). According to the originally predicted topology (2Guastella J. Nelson N. Nelson H. Czyzyk L. Keynan S. Miedel M.C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kanner B.I. Science. 1990; 249: 1303-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), which recently has received strong experimental support (13Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12675-12681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), this residue faces the extracellular medium (Fig. 1). However, transporters in which this cysteine was replaced by serine were still sensitive to the sulfhydryl reagent MTSEA (12Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This suggests that there are additional cysteines that are targets for the covalent modification by this reagent. In this study we have identified the predominant target residue, cysteine 399. Furthermore, we have observed that inactivation of the transporters by sulfhydryl reagents is very sensitive to the conformation of the transporter. Under all conditions, even those where the reactivity of wild type GAT-1 toward MTSEA is potentiated, C399S transporters remain relatively resistant to the reagent. It appears therefore that cysteine 399 is a highly conformationally sensitive residue.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials[3H]GABA (39.3Ci/mmol) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products.

Each well was then incubated at room temperature with 200 μl of this solution (cases of different compositions are indicated in the figure legends) and the indicated concentration of reagent under study. After 5 min, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with 1 ml of the transport solution. Subsequently they were assayed for [3H]GABA transport using the solution to which the labeled amino acid was added (16Keynan S. Suh Y.-J. Kanner B.I. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1974-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The hydrophilic methanethiosulfonate reagents used were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc. Positively charged MTSEA and MTSET are approximately 1 nm in length, differing only at the charged head group, which measures 0.58 nm in MTSET and 0.36 nm in MTSEA (18Akabas M. Stauffer D. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Although MTSEA is membrane-permeant to some extent, MTSET is impermeant (19Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONBy replacing individual cysteines to serine, we have identified the major site for inhibition of GAT-1 by the sulfhydryl reagents MTSEA and N -ethylmaleimide. This is cysteine 399, which is located on an intracellular loop, according to all published topological models (2Guastella J. Nelson N. Nelson H. Czyzyk L. Keynan S. Miedel M.C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kanner B.I. Science. 1990; 249: 1303-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 12Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Direct experimental evidence for the internal location of this loop has been obtained with the related norepinephrine transporter (26Melikian H.E. McDonald J.K. Gu H. Rudnick G. Moore K.R. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12290-12297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ideal way to demonstrate this would be to replace all 15 endogenous cysteines with other residues in such a manner that a cysteine-less transporter exhibiting considerable transport activity will be obtained and to introduce a single cysteine at position 399. The data depicted in Fig. 2 show that replacement of several individual cysteines, each results in loss of around 75% of the transport activity. There might be a variety of reasons for this: a reduction in the rate of conformational changes intrinsic in the transport cycle, reduced biosynthesis or increased degradation, or a reduced targeting of mutant transporters to the membrane. Regardless of the reasons, the above, together with observations on the critical nature of the two cysteines thought to form a disulfide bond in the related dopamine and serotonin transporters (20Wang J.B. Moriwaki A. Uhl G.R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1416-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 21Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), makes it virtually impossible to obtain an active cysteine-less GAT-1. However, the observation that regardless of the nature of the replacement at the 399 position, resistance to MTSEA was obtained (Fig. 3 B ) indicates that cysteine 399 is the major site of action by sulfhydryl reagents. Transport of C399S is also somewhat reduced, 48 ± 9% that of the wild type. However, it retains the hallmarks of GABA transport catalyzed by GAT-1, namely sodium and chloride dependence. Therefore, it appears that replacement of cysteine 399 by serine does not cause an overall change in the conformation of the C399S transporters.The sensitivity of GAT-1 to MTSEA is influenced by the presence of its substrates, sodium, chloride, and GABA. This is in harmony with our earlier observations that GAT-1 undergoes extensive conformational changes upon substrate binding (27Mabjeesh N.J. Kanner B.I. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8540-8546Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It is of interest to note that in the related serotonin transporter, replacement of sodium by lithium renders this transporter more sensitive to methanethiosulfonate reagents (21Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Wild type GAT-1 becomes more sensitive to MTSEA in the absence of either sodium or chloride (Fig. 5). It also becomes more sensitive to the sulfhydryl reagents in the presence of GABA in NaCl-containing media (Fig. 6). These effects are largely absent in C399S transporters (Figs. 5 and 7) implying that these effects are largely because of effects of substrate binding on the accessibility of cysteine 399. This is further illustrated in Fig.9. In the presence of chloride but in the absence of sodium, cysteine 399 is readily accessible to covalent modification by sulfhydryl reagents from the inside. Sodium binding to this form of the transporter causes a conformational change, resulting in decreased sensitivity to MTSEA (Figs. 5 and 9) and also to an improved ability of GABA to bind to the transporter (Ref. 28Mager S. Kleinberger Doron N. Keshet G.I. Davidson N. Kanner B.I. Lester H.A. J. Neusosci. 1996; 16: 5404-5414Crossref Google Scholar, Fig. 9). In the presence of sodium and chloride, GABA and its nontransportable analogue SKF100330A have opposing effects. Whereas GABA potentiates the inhibition by MTSEA (Fig. 6 A ), SFK100330A protects (Fig.8 B ). Because both of them bind to the GABA binding site, we infer that this binding leads to a markedly decreased accessibility of cysteine 399 (Fig. 9). In the presence of SKF100330A, the transporter remains locked in this mode, but in the presence of GABA, translocation takes place, and this exposes cysteine 399 again (Fig. 9). The protective effect of SKF100330A is sodium-dependent (Fig.8 B ). Surprisingly, in the absence of chloride, SKF100330A markedly potentiates the inhibition by MTSEA (Fig. 8 B ), whereas GABA has no effect (Fig. 6 B ). One explanation for this may be that in the absence of chloride, GABA is not capable of binding to its site, whereas SKF100330A still can do so, perhaps by virtue of its hydrophobic tail, which could anchor it to additional residues in the vicinity of the binding site. Although not indicated in Fig. 9, this somehow results in a conformation where GAT-1 is rendered supersensitive to MTSEA. This supersensitivity is not observed with C399S transporters (Fig. 8 C ), again indicating that cysteine 399 contributes to this effect.Figure 9Four different conformations of wild type GAT-1. Left to right , chloride is bound from the outside, and cysteine 399 (−SH ) is accessible from the inside. Upon sodium binding (Na+), the accessibility of cysteine 399 is reduced, and the GABA binding site is induced. Upon binding of GABA or SKF100330A, the accessibility of cysteine 399 is reduced even further. In the presence of SKF100330A, the transporters are locked in this conformation. In the presence of GABA, the transporters undergo the translocation step, and now cysteine 399 becomes more accessible again.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In contrast to MTSEA, the permanently charged MTSET is not permeant (19Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The very low sensitivity of GAT-1 to MTSET (12Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) is in harmony with the idea of an intracellular location of cysteine 399 (Fig. 1 and Ref. 26Melikian H.E. McDonald J.K. Gu H. Rudnick G. Moore K.R. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12290-12297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the absence of chloride the blocker SKF100330A renders GAT-1 sensitive to the impermeant sulfhydryl reagent MTSET, and cysteine 399 contributes to this sensitivity (Fig.8 D ). Thus, the accessibility of this residue to MTSET, which is not very different in size to the transported GABA, is highly dependent on the conformational state of the transporter. Thus, experiments using accessibility of cysteines to small sulfhydryl reagents as a criterion for topological assignments need to be interpreted with extreme caution. This accessibility should at least be tested under a variety of conditions. Moreover, externally added MTSET may permeate into a water-filled pore representing part of the translocation pathway of the transporter. Thus, it is possible that it can react with a cysteine located closer to the cytoplasm than the polar head-groups of the external or even the internal phospholipid leaflet. Even though the loop on which cysteine 399 is located faces the cytoplasm, in one of the conformations of the transporter, externally added MTSET may permeate through the translocation pathway and react with cysteine 399.Only in the four GABA transporters of the superfamily is there a cysteine residue in the loop connecting transmembrane domains 8 and 9. Bacterial GABA transporters belong to the distinct family of APC transporters. They also have a cysteine at a similar position, and this cysteine is critical for function (29Hu L.A. King S.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 330: 771-776Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that this might be a general feature extending to the GABA transporters of the family of sodium- and chloride-dependent neurotransmitter transporters (29Hu L.A. King S.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 330: 771-776Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It appears that this is not the case, as C399S transporters have substantial activity, around 50% that of wild type. Rather, it appears that the properties of cysteine 399 in GAT-1 are reminiscent of those of cysteine 148 of lac permease. This cysteine has been shown to be the site of inhibition of lac permease byN -ethylmaleimide (30Beyreuther K. Bieseler B. Ehring R. Muller-Hill B. Elzinga M. Methods in Protein Sequence Analysis. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1981: 139-148Google Scholar), but it is not required for function (31Jung H. Jung K. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12166-12171Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It appears that cysteine 148 is close to the sugar binding site of this permease. Making its side chain more bulky by the covalent modification apparently perturbs sugar binding (31Jung H. Jung K. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12166-12171Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It seems likely therefore that cysteine 399 of GAT-1 is located in the vicinity of an important functional domain of the transporter. Covalent modification would perturb the function exerted by this domain. Although we do not know the proximity relations in GAT-1, it is tempting to speculate that determinants of this domain may be located in transmembrane domains 8 and 9 or perhaps in the loop connecting them. Therefore, it will be of special interest to examine these regions using the scanning cysteine accessibility method (see for instance Refs. 18Akabas M. Stauffer D. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar and 32Akabas M. Kaufmann C. Cook T.A. Archdeacon P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 14231-14237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).Even though it seems impossible to design a cysteine-less GAT-1 construct, the low sensitivity of the C399S transporters to sulfhydryl reagents indicates that by elimination of selected cysteines we could produce a transporter that is virtually insensitive to sulfhydryl reagents. The double mutant C74SC399S is even less sensitive to sulfhydryl reagents than C399S (data not shown). In the related dopamine transporter, a construct where 5 cysteines were replaced became 2 orders of magnitude less sensitive to MTSEA (36Ferrer J.V. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9238-9243Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Introduction of cysteines into an insensitive GAT-1 would be the starting point for probing the region including transmembrane domains 8 and 9 as well as other interesting domains by the scanning cysteine accessibility method. This will facilitate mapping the substrate binding sites and probing the translocation path of GAT-1 and related transporters. GAT-1 is a GABA1transporter that was reconstituted, purified to homogeneity (1Radian R. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15437-15441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and cloned (2Guastella J. Nelson N. Nelson H. Czyzyk L. Keynan S. Miedel M.C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kanner B.I.

Tyrosine 140 appears to be involved in the binding of GABA, possibly in the liganding of the amino group, the moiety common to all neurotransmitters (11Bismuth Y. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

This suggests that one or more cysteines may play a critical role in the transport process or else are located in the vicinity of other critical residues. One of these cysteines, located at position 74, has recently been identified (12Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). According to the originally predicted topology (2Guastella J. Nelson N. Nelson H. Czyzyk L. Keynan S.

Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12675-12681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), this residue faces the extracellular medium (Fig. 1). However, transporters in which this cysteine was replaced by serine were still sensitive to the sulfhydryl reagent MTSEA (12Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This suggests that there are additional cysteines that are targets for the covalent modification by this reagent. In this study we have identified the predominant target residue, cysteine 399. Furthermore, we have observed that inactivation of the transporters by sulfhydryl reagents is very sensitive to the conformation of the transporter. Under all conditions, even those where the reactivity of wild type GAT-1 toward MTSEA is potentiated, C399S transporters remain relatively resistant to the reagent. It appears therefore that cysteine 399 is a highly conformationally sensitive residue. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials[3H]GABA (39.3Ci/mmol) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products.

This pathway mediates growth inhibitory signals from the cell surface to the nucleus. Although Smad2 protein is significantly mutated in human cancers, there is no definitive evidence implicating Smad2 as a tumor-suppressor gene. Here we show that overexpression of the tumor-derived missense mutation Smad2.D450E, an unphosphorylable form of Smad2 found in colorectal and lung cancers, did not abolish the TGF-β-mediated growth arrest, suggesting that resistance to the growth-inhibiting effects of TGF-β exhibited by human tumors cannot be linked to the inactivation of Smad2 protein. In contrast, overexpression of Smad2.D450E induces cellular invasion, and this effect was enhanced by TGF-β. A similar invasive phenotype was obtained in cells expressing another inactivating mutation in Smad2 (Smad2.P445H) found in colorectal cancer. These findings indicate that genetic defects in Smad2 are sufficient to confer the invasion-promoting effect of TGF-β and reveal that TGF-β acts through Smad2 to induce cellular invasion by a novel mechanism that is independent of Smad2 phosphorylation by the activated TGF-β type I receptor.

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)1 is a multifunctional cytokine involved in the regulation of many biological processes including cell proliferation, extracellular matrix formation, differentiation, and cell death (1Derynck R.

Feng X.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 105-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The signal is then transferred to the nucleus through the type I receptor kinase-mediated phosphorylation of Smad2 on the C-terminal serine residues. This phosphorylation event results in association of Smad2 with Smad4 and translocation to the nucleus where they function as transcriptional regulators via their interactions with DNA-binding proteins such as Fast-1 and Fast-2 (1Derynck R.

Although TGF-β is one of the most potent inhibitors of normal cell growth, many malignancies of epithelial and hematopoietic origins are resistant to TGF-β, suggesting that mutations in signaling components of this pathway may allow tumor cells to escape from growth inhibition by TGF-β (1Derynck R.

At present, functional analysis of mesoderm induction in Xenopus embryos suggests that these types of mutation yield biologically inactive Smad2 proteins (7Eppert K. Scherer S.W. Ozcelik H. Pirone R.

However, the importance of alterations or loss in Smad2 protein in promoting tumorigenesis is still unknown. Mice with inactivating mutation in the loci for Smad2 died in utero (10Waldrip W.R.

This early lethality likely precluded tumor formation and, therefore, these knock-out mice did not shed light on the role of TGF-β signaling in carcinogenesis. Using a collagen I invasion in vitro assay, we now present evidence that alterations of Smad2 play a significant role in TGF-β-mediated invasiveness and malignant progression. Mammalian expression vectors for Smad2 mutants and pAR3-lux were a gift from Dr. J. Wrana. pcDNA-3-Flag-Smad 7 was a gift from Dr. P. ten Dijke. Expression vector for Fast-1 was a gift from Dr. M. Whitman. Expression vectors for Smad4, GAL4-Smad4, and G15E1b-lux have been described (11Atfi A. Buisine M. Mazars A. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24731-24734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Plasmids for GAL4-Smad2 and GAL4-Smad2.D450E were constructed using the pSG424 vector. For stable transfection, Smad2 mutants were subcloned into pEGFP in-frame with an amino-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag. The epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells or MDCK cells stably expressing the constitutively activated mutant of phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (p110*) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 5 mm glutamine. Cells were transfected with expression vectors by the LipofectAMINE method (Life Technologies, Inc.) and selected in G418 or hygromycin-containing growth medium and expanded as pools of stably transfected cells. Control cells were transfected with the appropriate vector alone and selected in parallel with the others cells. For double transfectants, stable cell lines were secondarily transfected with a vector encoding a hygromycin resistance gene and selected in hygromycin-containing growth medium. For the clonal growth assays, hygromycin-resistant colonies were visualized with crystal violet 10–13 days after transfection. For gene expression analysis, cells were plated to semiconfluency and 24 h later were transfected with expression vectors by the LipofectAMINE method. Cells were subsequently incubated in the presence or absence of human TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) for 16 h. Extracts were then prepared and assayed for luciferase activity using the luciferase assay system described by the manufacturer (Promega). The luciferase activities were normalized on the basis of β-galactosidase expression from pCMV5.LacZ control vector and protein content. Invasion assays across dish coated with type I collagen were performed as described (12Vleminckx K. Vakaet Jr., L. Mareel M. Fiers W. van Roy F. Cell. 1991; 66: 107-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar). Collagen G (type I solution, Seromed, Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany) was dissolved at 0.22% (w/v) in bicarbonate buffer-containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and 1.2-ml aliquots were poured into a 6-well plate and incubated overnight at 37 °C for gelation. Cells were seeded on top of the collagen gel and incubated at 37 °C. After 24 h, the number of cells that invaded the gel as well as the depth of the invasive cells was monitored under an inverted microscope with a computer-controlled step motor. The invasion index was expressed as the percentage of cells invading the gel over the total number of cells. Mutant Smad2 proteins carrying point mutations found in human cancers are no longer phosphorylated in response to TGF-β, suggesting that alteration of Smad2 may function to disrupt TGF-β signaling. To test this hypothesis, we generated pools of MDCK cells stably transfected with Smad2.D450E, a tumor-derived missense mutation found in colorectal and lung cancers (7Eppert K. Scherer S.W. Ozcelik H. Pirone R. Hoodless P. Kim H. Tsui L.C. Bapat B. Gallinger S. Andrulis I.L. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Attisano L.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5583-5585PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found that expression of Smad2.D450E failed to block TGF-β-induced cell cycle arrest (Fig. 1 A ). As a control, expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Smad2 (Smad2.S465A), which contains a substitution of Ser at position 465 and cannot undergo TGF-β-induced phosphorylation (14Abdollah S. Macı́as-Silva M. Tsukazaki T. Hayashi H. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27678-27685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 15Souchelnytskyi S. Tamaki K.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28107-28115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), suppressed the antiproliferative action of TGF-β (Fig. 1 A ). In a clonal growth assay, we found that overexpression of Smad2.D450E, but not wild-type Smad2, was unable to trigger growth arrest in MDCK cells (Fig. 1 B ), suggesting that the mutant protein is recessive in this assay. Smad2.D450E also failed to restore the number of surviving colonies from MDCK cells expressing Smad4 (Fig.1 B ). A similar conclusion could be drawn when Smad2.D450E was cotransfected with wild-type Smad2 (Fig. 1 B ), suggesting that Smad2.D450E cannot act as a dominant-negative inhibitor to disrupt Smad signaling. From these results, it is becoming evident that the acquisition of TGF-β resistance in tumors is not associated with this mutation of Smad2 and may result from defects of other components in TGF-β-mediated responses. To investigate the possibility that mutations of Smad2 found in human tumors could interfere with the function of wild-type Smad2 protein, we first tested the ability of Smad2.D450E to signal transcriptional responses that are typical of TGF-β. A fusion protein construct containing the full-length Smad4 and the DNA binding domain GAL4 (1-147) failed to stimulate transcription, but when it was cotransfected with Smad2, we observed a strong TGF-β-dependent induction of the heterologous promoter construct. In contrast, when Smad2.D450E was used, we observed a strong decrease in GAL4-Smad4 transcriptional activity (Fig.2 A ). Similar results were obtained when GAL4-Smad2 fusion proteins containing either wild-type Smad2 or Smad2.D450E were tested in this assay (Fig. 2 B ). However, quite different results were obtained in another assay using the pAR3-lux, which contains three activin responsive elements (AREs) linked to a basic TATA box and a luciferase reporter gene (16Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N. Gimbone M.A.J. Wrana J.L. Falb D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1165-1173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 C , expression of a pAR3-lux construct had minimal basal activity, but a strong TGF-β-dependent increase of transcriptional activity was detected in MDCK cells expressing both pAR3-lux and the forkhead-containing DNA-binding protein Fast-1, a transcription factor which associates with Smad2 and activates transcription from an ARE (16Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N. Gimbone M.A.J. Wrana J.L. Falb D.

Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Interestingly, coexpression of Smad2 or Smad2.D450E along with Fast-1 resulted in ligand-independent synergetic induction of the reporter gene, although to a variable extent (Fig. 2 C ). Whereas Smad2 caused only a modest increase, overexpression of Smad2.D450E led to superinduction of the AR3 reporter. The induction of AR3 reporter by Smad2.D450E is not a general phenomenon because of the accumulation of unphosphorylated forms of Smad2 since expression of the dominant-negative mutant of Smad2 (Smad2.S467A), which contains a substitution of Ser at position 467 and cannot undergo TGF-β-induced phosphorylation (14Abdollah S.

Identical results were obtained with the HepG2 cell line, suggesting that the effect of Smad2.D450E on the AR3 reporter may be a general phenomenon (data not shown). Taken together, our findings raise the interesting possibility that the tumor-derived missense mutation Smad2.D450E is constitutively active in regulating some physiological functions that do not depend on its phosphorylation by the activated TGF-β type I receptor. Whereas the loss of growth inhibition by TGF-β frequently accompanies the progression of malignancy and may contribute to development of many types of human cancers, recent studies revealed that TGF-β showed a biphasic action during tumor progression, thereby acting as a tumor suppressor at early stages and as an enhancer of invasiveness at later stages (1Derynck R. Feng X.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 105-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 18Cui W. Fowlis D.J. Byron S. Duffie E. Ireland H. Balmain A. Akurt R. Cell. 1996; 86: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). To understand the functional significance of Smad2 alteration in tumors, we investigated the potential effects of Smad2.D450E on cellular invasion. As shown in Fig.3 A , expression of Smad2.D450E stimulates the invasion of MDCK cells in the absence of TGF-β, as detected by a dramatic increase of invasion into collagen I matrices. The induction of invasion by Smad2.D450E is not a general phenomenon because of the accumulation of unphosphorylated forms of Smad2 because expression of the dominant-negative mutant of Smad2 (Smad2.S467A), which cannot undergo TGF-β-induced phosphorylation (14Abdollah S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28107-28115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), is defective in inducing cellular invasion (Fig. 3 A ). More importantly, we find that TGF-β addition to MDCK cells transfected with Smad2.D450E, but not empty vector, further increased cellular invasion. Similar results were obtained with two independent populations of MDCK cells expressing Smad2.D450E, indicating that the invasion phenotype that we observed in MDCK-Smad2.D450E was not because of the selection of an aggressive line of G418 cells. These results indicate that the naturally occurring mutation of Smad2 is sufficient to confer the invasion-promoting effect of TGF-β, which is consistent with the interpretation that alterations of Smad2 in human tumors play a significant role in TGF-β-mediated malignant progression and invasiveness (Fig. 3 A ). The effect of Smad2.D450E on cellular invasion is specific to Smad2 and TGF-β signaling because TGF-β addition had no effect on the invasion of MDCK cells transfected with a constitutively activated mutant of p110* (Fig. 3 A ), the prime mediator of cellular invasion (19Shaw L.M. Rabinovitz I. Wang H.H. Toker A. Mercurio A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 949-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 20Keely P.J. Westwick J.K. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Parise L.V. Nature. 1997; 390: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Conversely, addition of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a potent inducer of cellular invasion (21Royal I. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27780-27787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), failed to increase invasion of MDCK cells expressing Smad2.D450E, although addition of HGF to cells expressing constitutively activated mutant of PI-3 kinase (p110*) led to the increase of invasion under these experimental conditions (Fig. 3 A ). Furthermore, p110* will synergize with Smad2.D450E in the invasion assay (Fig. 3 B ). Consistent with this observation, cells expressing Smad2.D450E had a morphology similar to wild-type MDCK cells, growing in islands of compact cells, whereas cells expressing the activated mutant of PI-3 kinase showed a more spindle-shaped morphotype but still grew as organized sheets (Fig.3 C ). Cells overexpressing both p110* and Smad2.D450E failed to organize into sheets, and the cells grew instead more as individuals cells (Fig. 3 C ). Moreover, expression of Smad2.D450E had no effect on the p3TP-Lux reporter (data not shown), which monitors the pathway that leads to increased production of the extracellular matrix in response to TGF-β, suggesting that stimulation of extracellular matrix production through plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 is not required for Smad2.D450E-induced tumor progression and invasiveness. A similar invasive phenotype was obtained in MDCK cells expressing another inactivating mutation in Smad2 (Smad2.P445H) found in colorectal cancer (7Eppert K. Scherer S.W. Ozcelik H. Pirone R. Hoodless P. Kim H. Tsui L.C. Bapat B. Gallinger S. Andrulis I.L. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Cell. 1996; 86: 543-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), thus reinforcing the conclusion that inactivation of Smad2 in cancers leads to increased cellular invasiveness (Fig. 2, A and B ). The phosphorylation of Smad2 and its association with the TGF-β receptor are essential for Smad2 function in TGF-β signal transduction (1Derynck R. Feng X.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 105-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 6Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3328) Google Scholar). Because Smad2.D450E interacts stably with TGF-β type I receptor (22Lo R.S. Chen Y.-G. Shi Y. Pavletich N.P. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 996-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), we generated independent clones of MDCK cells stably expressing Smad7 to determine whether Smad2.D450E induces cellular invasion by preventing access and phosphorylation of endogenous Smad2 protein to the receptor. As a direct antagonist of TGF-β signaling pathways, Smad7 functions by associating stably with the activated TGF-β type I receptor to block the interaction, phosphorylation, and nuclear translocation of Smad2 (16Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N. Gimbone M.A.J. Wrana J.L. Falb D.

Western blot analysis of whole-cell lysates showed that two independent clones of MDCK cells express high levels of Flag-Smad7 fusion protein (Fig.4 A ). In agreement with published results (16Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N. Gimbone M.A.J. Wrana J.L. Falb D.

Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1998; 389: 631-635Crossref Scopus (1550) Google Scholar), we find that expression of Smad7 blocks the majority of TGF-β-mediated growth arrest in MDCK cells (data not shown). By contrast, overexpression of Smad7 did not show any effect in the invasion assay irrespective of whether the cells were cultured in the presence or absence of TGF-β or HGF (Fig. 4 B ). These results indicate that Smad2.D450E enhances malignant progression by a mechanism that is independent of Smad2 phosphorylation by the activated type I receptor and disruption of TGF-β signaling pathways. In numerous tumors, resistance to TGF-β is associated with inactivating mutations that can occur in components of this signaling pathway such as Smad2 protein (1Derynck R. Feng X.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 105-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Although these tumor cells often harbor other genetic alterations as well, resistance to TGF-β-induced growth inhibition cannot be linked definitively to the mutations in Smad2 protein and may result from defects of other components in TGF-β signaling pathways (1Derynck R. Feng X.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 105-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Consistent with this interpretation, recent studies indicated that the missense mutation D450E reconstructed on the corresponding residue of Smad3 suppressed TGF-β-mediated cell cycle arrest (24Goto D. Yagi K. Inoue H. Iwamoto I. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Kato M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mice with inactivating mutation in the loci for Smad3 develop colorectal cancer, reinforcing the role of Smad3 in mediating growth inhibitory signals (25Zhu Y. Richardson J.A. Parada L. Graff J.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 703-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). In contrast to the growth inhibitory effect of TGF-β, overexpression of Smad2.D450E induces cellular invasion, and this effect was enhanced by TGF-β. Taken together, the findings outlined in the present study provide strong evidence that Smad2 is a tumor suppressor that plays a critical role in malignant progression and the control of cell invasiveness. For instance, it is not clear whether TGF-β is directly or indirectly mediating the activation of these mutant proteins and their interaction with other TGF-β-related signal transduction mediators, such as Smad3 and Smad4. Work is now in progress to address these issues. In any event, our study revealed that TGF-β enhances malignant progression through Smad2 by a novel intracellular mechanism that is independent of Smad2 phosphorylation by the activated type I receptor because Smad2 mutants are not phosphorylated in response to TGF-β (7Eppert K. Scherer S.W. Ozcelik H. Pirone R. Hoodless P. Kim H. Tsui L.C. Bapat B. Gallinger S. Andrulis I.L. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Cell. 1996; 86: 543-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Thus, it will clearly be interesting in the future to determine whether, in addition to promoting invasiveness, this mechanism may fulfill other functions in cellular transformation and differentiation."

We have identified an interaction between the β1 integrin and the 16-kDa subunit of vacuolar H+-ATPase (16K). This interaction was first isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen and confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and inin vitro binding assays using bacterially expressed proteins. Immunofluorescent studies performed in L6 myoblasts expressing both native and epitope-tagged 16K demonstrate co-localization with β1 integrin in focal adhesions. Deletion of the fourth of four transmembrane helices in 16K results in loss of interaction with β1 integrin in vitro and in the two-hybrid system, and less prominent staining in focal adhesions. This helix is also required for ligand-independent activation of platelet-derived growth factor-β receptor signaling by the human papillomavirus E5 oncoprotein. Overexpression of 16K or expression of 16K lacking this helix alters the morphology of myoblasts and fibroblasts, suggesting that the interaction of 16K with integrins could be important for cell growth control. We also discuss the possible role 16K might play in integrin movement.

Integrin receptors involved in ECM interactions cluster at the points where stable binding to the matrix occurs, producing “focal adhesions” to which cytoskeletal components and signaling molecules co-localize (4Burridge K. Fath K. Kelly T. Nuckolls G. Turner C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 487-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1684) Google Scholar, 5Turner C.E. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Integrin α/β heterodimers can be divided into subfamilies on the basis of their common β subunit. Those of the β1 subfamily include at least nine different heterodimers that function primarily as receptors for collagens, laminins, and fibronectin. Much of the literature on integrins deals with their extracellular interactions with ECM ligands and how cytoplasmic domains tweak signaling pathways and influence cytoskeleton structure. However, little is known about the mechanisms whereby they redistribute in the cell membrane during focal adhesion formation; how they shuttle through the cell during synthesis, endocytosis, and transcytosis; and how they become targeted for degradation or recycling. It is believed that interactions within the plasma and organellar membranes are critical to these processes (6Brown M.S. Anderson R.G. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1983; 32: 663-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Several types of integral plasma membrane proteins have been demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation to interact with integrin heterodimers. These are the integrin-associated proteins, which interact with certain αv integrin heterodimers (7Brown E. Hooper L. Ho T. Gresham H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2785-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), EMMPRIN (8Berditchevski F. Chang S. Bodorova J. Hemler M.E. J. Biol.

Little is known about the functional consequences of interactions with these proteins, although integrin-mediated Ca2+ influx has been shown to be regulated by integrin-associated proteins (12Schwartz M.A. Brown E.J. Fazeli B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19931-19934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Signaling from integrins and from transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases can converge in the focal adhesion (13Plopper G.E. McNamee H.P. Dike L.E. Bojanowski K. Ingber D.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1349-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). For example, binding of growth factor PDGF-B causes dimerization of the β form of its receptor (PDGF-β receptor), leading to the activation of the receptor's kinase activity and autophosphorylation. PDGF-B stimulation mimics many signaling responses triggered by integrin adhesion, such as phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, and mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK-1 and ERK-2 (14Rankin S. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 704-710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The convergence of integrin and PDGF-β receptor functions is supported by data showing that fibronectin, collagen, or anti-integrin IgG binding to fibroblasts leads to phosphorylation of the receptor in the absence of PDGF (16Sundberg C. Rubin K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 741-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) is a large multisubunit enzyme present in intracellular membrane compartments such as endosomes, lysosomes, clathrin-coated vesicles, and the Golgi complex, where it plays a vital role in the maintenance of endocytic and exocytic pathways (17Forgac M.

Gruenberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of its subunits, a 16-kDa protein (16K) also known as ductin, has been found in the plasma membrane of renal and kidney epithelial cells, macrophages, and some tumor cell lines (22Swallow C.J. Grinstein S. Rotstein O.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7645-7654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Márquez-Sterling N. Herman I.M. Pesacreta T. Arai H. Terres G. Forgac M. Eur. J.

Lynch R.M. Martinez G.M. Gillies R.J. Am. J.

Hasebe M. Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, it comprises structures independently of the V-ATPase, including gap junctional complexes and mediatophores, which are involved in the release of neurotransmitters (27Birman S. Meunier F.-M. Lesbats B. Le Caer J.-P. Rossier J. Israel M. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 28Leitch B. Finbow M.E. Exp.

Smith K. Bubb V. Schlegel R. Nature. 1991; 352: 347-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 32Goldstein D.J. Andresson T. Sparkowski J.J. Schlegel R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4851-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and has been proposed to mediate the ability of E5 to cause ligand-independent activation of the PDGF-β receptor (33Andresson T. Sparkowski J. Goldstein D.J. Schlegel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6830-6837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We report here the identification of an interaction between the transmembrane domains of β1 integrin and 16K. The interaction was detected using a yeast two-hybrid screen, and confirmed by various in vitro and in vivo binding assays. We find the distribution of 16K within cells to be ECM-dependent, and show that perturbation of 16K expression can affect the morphology of cells. These and other data in the literature showing a requirement for transmembrane domains for proper integrin distribution (e.g. Ref. 34Solowska J. Edelman J.M. Albelda S.M. Buck C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) led us to hypothesize that 16K utilizes transmembrane interactions with receptors to shuttle them through the cell and to cell membranes. β1 integrin bait plasmids were made by amplifying from the full-length cDNA of the bovine β1 subunit (35MacLaren L.A. Wildeman A.G. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 53: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) sequences encoding amino acids 691–773 (transmembrane and intracellular domains, TRIC), 691–741 (transmembrane domain, TR), and 725–773 (intracellular domain, IC). These domains are 100% homologous to mouse and human proteins. The TR primers were 5′-TAGAATTCACTGTTCATGTTGTAGAG-3′ (TR upstream) and 5′-TAGTCGACCTGGCAAATTCCCTTCTGTC-3′ (TR downstream), the TRIC primers were the TR upstream primer and 5′-TAGTCGACCTCATACTTCGGATTAAC-3′ (IC downstream), and the IC primers were 5′-TAGAATTCCTGCTGATTTGGAAG-3′ (IC upstream) and the IC downstream primer. The α5 integrin bait plasmid was made by amplifying from the bovine α5cDNA (35MacLaren L.A. Wildeman A.G. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 53: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) sequences encoding amino acids 341–385, which includes the transmembrane domain, using primers 5′-TAGAATTCGCCACAGCTGTGCAGTGG-3′ (α5 upstream) and 5′-TAGTCGACTTTGAAGAAGAAGAGA-3′ (α5 downstream). The PCR products were directionally cloned into pBTM116, creating the LexA fusion bait plasmids β1-TR, β1-TRIC, β1-IC, and α5-TR. A day 9.5/10.5 mouse embryo cDNA library constructed in pVP16 (36Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) was co-transfected with the bait plasmids into the yeast strain L40 (37Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar) using a lithium acetate protocol (38Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 201425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2863) Google Scholar). Data base searches were done using the BLAST server at the NCBI (39Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar). Yeast carrying the bait plasmids were grown toA 600 = 0.7, harvested by centrifugation, and cells from 1.5 ml of culture were resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, frozen at −80 °C, rapidly lysed in a boiling water bath for 5 min, then spun briefly to remove debris. Protein lysates were fractionated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with rabbit anti-LexA polyclonal antibody (gift from Erica Golemis). Detection was with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. The rat myogenic cell line, L6 described by Yaffe (40Yaffe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 61: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), the rat embryo fibroblast cell line (Ref52) and the human pancreatic tumor cell line Capan-2 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. L6 and Ref52 cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in α-modified minimal essential medium (α-MEM), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Capan-2 cells were grown in McCoy's 5a medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. The rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody (Y-11) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-16K-M and anti-16K-N are rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against N-terminal peptides from rat 16K and were used in immunoprecipitations and immunofluorescence, respectively (41Nezu J.-I. Motojima K. Tamura H.-O. Ohkuma S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 42Ohta T. Numata M. Yagishita H. Futagami F. Tsukioka Y. Kitigawa H. Kayahara M.

JHSL32 is a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the 70-kDa subunit of V-ATPase (43Lee B.S. Holliday L.S. Ojikutu B. Krits I. Gluck S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C382-C388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal Armenian hamster anti-mouse β1 integrin (HMβ1-1) was obtained from PharMingen. For double labeling experiments, primary antibodies were visualized using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse anti-hamster IgG (PharMingen), followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma), or Texas red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Molecular Probes). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody was from Sigma. Transmembrane and cytoplasmic integrin segments were synthesized as tripartite fusions with GST and a fragment of protein A by cloning appropriate PCR-amplified products into the Bam HI and Eco RI sites of pAGEX-2T (44Smith D.B. Berger L.C. Wildeman A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 359-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Such an approach with protein A tagging has previously been used inin vitro binding assays (45Berger L.C. Smith D.B. Davidson I. Hwang J.-J. Fanning E. Wildeman A.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 116-amino acid protein A tag (14 kDa) provides solubility and a uniformly sized larger carrier for the small protein domains that vary in size from 3 to 10 kDa and have different charges and hydrophobicities, thereby minimizing artifacts in binding assays. The TRIC fragment was amplified using 5′-ATCGGATCCGCCACTGTTGTAGAGAC-3′ and 5-CTAGAATTCCCTCATACTTCGGATT-3′, the transmembrane region using 5′-CGGATCCATTATTCCAATTGTAG-3′ and 5′-CGGAATTCCCAAATCAGCAGCAAT-3′, and the cytoplasmic region using 5′-CGGGATCCAAGCTTTTAATGA-3′ and 5′-CTAGAATTCCCTCATACTTCGGATT-3′. These fusions were coupled to glutathione-agarose beads, and the protein A-tagged β1moiety released by cleavage with thrombin. EGTA was added to 5 mm, and the beads with GST removed by centrifugation. The protein A-tagged integrin fragments were incubated with glutathione-agarose beads to which were coupled GST fusion proteins of full-length (GST-16K) or truncated versions (GST-TM1 and GST-TM4) of 16K. All GST fusion proteins were expressed using pGEX-5X-3. GST-16K was made using primers (5′-ACGCGGATCCACATGGCTGACATCAAG-3′ and 5′-CCGGAATTCCTACTTTGTGGAGAG-3′; 16K upstream and downstream, respectively) tagged with Bam HI and Eco RI sites to PCR-amplify the full-length cDNA, GST-TM1 was isolated as aBam HI-Eco RI fragment from the two-hybrid isolate in pVP16, and GST-TM4 was amplified from the full-length cDNA using the 16K upstream primer and an internal downstream primer (5′-CCGGAATTCCTACACGAACAGTCGAGGC-3′; TM4 downstream). Forin vitro binding assays, 2 μg of GST-16K, GST-TM1, or GST-TM4 protein coupled to beads were incubated at 4 °C with 2 μg of soluble protA-TRIC, protA-TR only, or protA-IC only, for 1 h with gentle shaking in 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1% milk powder. The beads were recovered by centrifugation and washed five times in binding buffer without milk powder. Beads were then suspended in sample buffer, heated, and the samples loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and protein A fusions detected directly by standard Western blot analysis using the rabbit anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody. Cells grown as monolayers were chilled to 4 °C, washed with cold PBS and lysed in cold RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) for 30 min. They were then scraped from the dishes with a rubber policeman, transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, and spun for 10 min at 4 °C. The soluble protein was divided into 25-μg aliquots to which anti-16K-M, rabbit control serum, or HMβ1-1 was added. After 1 h at 4 °C, protein A-Sepharose (20 μl of 50% slurry/ml) was added and the incubation continued for 30 min. Complexes were recovered by centrifugation, washed three times with PBS, and run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Western blot analysis was performed using HMβ1-1 primary antibody, mouse anti-hamster secondary antibody, and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody for detection. Cells grown in 35-mm culture dishes were starved of methionine for 20 min in α-MEM free of methionine and serum. Following this period, 100 μCi of [35S]methionine was added and cells were labeled at 37 °C for 8 h. The supernatant was removed, cells were washed with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS, and harvested with a rubber policeman. Cells were collected by gentle centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min, lysed in 200 μl of RIPA buffer on ice for 10–15 min, and centrifuged at high speed for 2 min. The supernatants were collected into a clean tube, and 40 μl was used in each immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described above, and complexes were run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis, the gel was fixed in 10% acetic acid and 40% methanol for 30 min, transferred to Amplify solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and treated for 30 min. The gel was dried and exposed to X-AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The HA-epitope (YPYDVPDYA) from the influenza virus hemagglutinin protein HA1 (46Wilson I.A. Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Cherenson A.R. Connolly M.L. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1984; 37: 767-768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) was added, along with a Sac II restriction site, to the N terminus of both 16K and TM4 by PCR amplification using an upstream primer encoding the epitope, 5′-TCCCCGCGGATGTACCCCTACGACGTGCCCGACTACGCCGCTGACATCAAGAACAACCCCGAA-3′, and the downstream primers used to make GST-16K and GST-TM4. Initially, Sac II-Eco RI fragments from these PCR products were cloned into pTRE and expressed with the tet-On system (CLONTECH). In later experiments we switched to using the pXJ40-KK0 vector, which enables consistent high levels of expression from an SV40 promoter, by amplifying the tagged full-length or TM4 fragments with terminal Eco RI and Bam HI sites to allow insertion into this vector. The effects of 16K and TM4 on cell morphology were seen with both pTRE and pXJ40-KKO systems, but the latter proved to be a more reliable vector. Stable cell lines were made by cotransfecting vector plasmids with the hygromycin B resistance plasmid pTK-hyg (CLONTECH), using the calcium phosphate procedure, and selecting for colonies that grew in 200 μg/ml hygromycin. Cells were grown on glass coverslips in dishes, media was removed and cells were washed twice with PBS. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed three times with PBS, and permeabilized by incubation with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min. They were again washed three times in PBS, then blocked in 10% rabbit serum in PBS. Primary antibody was diluted according to suppliers recommendations in 2% rabbit serum and incubated with cells for 1 h, followed by one wash with PBS, and incubation with secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature. For double-labeling experiments this procedure was then repeated for the other primary and secondary antibodies, after which the cells received three 10-min washes in PBS. They were then covered with mounting medium, affixed to glass slides, and viewed using a Bio-Rad MRC-600 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a krypton-argon mixed gas laser. Cells treated with preimmune rabbit serum instead of primary antibodies, or untransfected control cells treated with anti-HA antibody, served as negative controls. Single-labeling experiments in which the secondary antibodies were mismatched with the primary antibodies demonstrated that there was no cross-reactivity between antibodies in the double-labeling experiments. Polystyrene latex beads (Sigma) were coated with fibronectin, polylysine, and bovine serum albumin as described by Grinnell and Geiger (47Grinnell F. Geiger B. Exp. Cell. Res. 1986; 162: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Approximately 3 × 106 polystyrene latex beads (11.9 μm diameter) were incubated for 1 h at 22 °C in 0.5 ml of α-MEM containing 25 μg of human plasma fibronectin (Sigma), 50 μg of polylysine (Sigma), or 50 μg of bovine serum albumin. Bead binding assays were performed according to the procedure of Burbelo et al. (48Burbelo P.D. Miyamoto S. Utani A. Brill S. Yamada K.M. Hall A. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30919-30926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with 25 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) in fibronectin-depleted serum. After 2 h cells were washed twice with PBS, then detached with 0.05% trypsin and 25 μg/ml cycloheximide. Cells (1 × 105) were subsequently plated on coverslips for 60 min at 37 °C in α-MEM containing 25 μg/ml cycloheximide. Each type of bead (approximately 2 × 106) was incubated with cells at 37 °C for 20 min. Cells were then fixed and stained with anti-16K antibody as described above. Controls in which primary antibody was replaced with preimmune serum showed no immunofluorescence. The TRIC bait for the two hybrid screen comprised the transmembrane domain of β1 integrin, flanked by 16 amino acids on the extracellular side and the full intracellular cytoplasmic domain (Fig.1 A ). This was done to avoid using only a short highly hydrophobic bait. Nine his+lacZ+ clones that did not react with the control lexA-lamin bait or with the empty BTM116 plasmid were obtained from screening 2 × 106 transformants, all encoding proteins that interacted with this bait and the β1-TR bait, but not the β1-IC bait consisting of the intracellular domain flanked by only four transmembrane residues. In addition, none of these proteins interacted with a bait containing the transmembrane domain of the α5 integrin subunit. Expression of both the α5 and β1transmembrane (TR) bait proteins in yeast was similar, as detected by an anti-LexA antibody (Fig. 1 A ), but none of the proteins interacted with the α5 bait. Thus, the lack of an interaction between 16K and α5-TR was not simply due to poor expression of that bait protein, and the interaction with the β1 transmembrane domain was not due solely to a nonspecific interaction of hydrophobic helices. Three of the cDNA clones recovered in this two hybrid screen encoded overlapping segments of the 16-kDa (16K) subunit of V-ATPase (Fig. 1 C ), two contained identical regions of an uncharacterized human cDNA, KIAA0025, previously isolated from a human immature myeloid cell line (49Nomura N.

DNA Res. 1994; 1: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), one encoded a fragment of a sugar transport protein (50Matsuo N. Kawamoto S. Matsubara K. Okubo K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 126-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and three did not share homology with any data base entries. All contained hydrophobic regions. Of the clones identified, 16K has several known functions that were intriguing with respect to potential involvement with integrins. The V-ATPases are responsible for acidification of vesicles, which determines whether receptor-ligand complexes are degraded or recycled (19Johnson L.S. Dunn K.W. Pytowski B. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1251-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 21Clague M.J. Urbé S. Aniento F. Gruenberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the 16K subunit can independently of the ATPase form gap junctions (30Finbow M.E. Harrison M. Jones P. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). All of the two hybrid isolates of 16K were missing the first transmembrane domain, proteins we refer to as TM1. A representative filter of the two hybrid assay showing the interaction of one of the three TM1 isolates with the β1-TR and β1-TRIC baits is shown in Fig. 1 B (center ). To confirm that the absence of the first transmembrane helix or some part of the 3′-nontranslated region in these clones was not creating an artifact in the screen, we expressed the full-length 16K coding region in the prey plasmid pVP16 and found it to also interact specifically with the β1-TRIC and β1-TR baits, and not the β1-IC bait (Fig.1 B , left ). Andresson et al. (33Andresson T. Sparkowski J. Goldstein D.J. Schlegel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6830-6837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) reported that the last helix of 16K, TM4, was required for its interaction with the E5 protein of bovine papillomavirus. To determine whether the interaction with β1 integrin also required this helix, we constructed a TM4 deletion mutant of 16K in pVP16, and found that it was no longer able to interact with any of the baits in a two-hybrid assay (Fig. 1 B , right ). When we tested the full-length 16K, TM1, and TM4 proteins with the α5-TR bait, none were found to interact, and filters with no colonies were obtained, identical to that seen when TM4 was tested. GST fusion proteins of full-length 16K, or the mutants lacking TM1 or TM4, were produced in bacteria, coupled to glutathione-agarose beads and assessed for their ability to bind fragments of β1 integrin. The original TRIC bait, the transmembrane domain alone (TR only), or the cytoplasmic domain alone (IC only) were synthesized as tripartite fusions with GST and a fragment of protein A, using the pAGEX2T vector (Fig.2). Cleavage of these fusions with thrombin released soluble protein A-tagged proteins (protA-TRIC, protA-TR only, protA-IC only). The protein A moiety allows for direct detection with antibody conjugates, thus eliminating the need for different primary antibodies specific for each integrin fragment, and thereby enabling quantitative comparison of the abilities of the different fragments to bind to the protein on beads. The protein A-tagged molecules were incubated with the beads to which equivalent amounts (2 μg), based on Coomassie staining (lanes 11–13 ), of GST-TM1, full-length GST-16K, or GST-TM4 were coupled, and complexes recovered by centrifugation. Western blot analysis of these complexes with an antibody conjugate showed that the TRIC fragment used in the initial two hybrid screen was able to bind full-length 16K(GST-16K) and 16K lacking TM1 (GST-TM1) with similar affinities (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4 ), in both cases retaining approximately 5% of the input protA-TRIC molecule (one quarter of the input is shown in lane 1 ), even after five rounds of washing the beads. The removal of TM4 prevented binding (lane 2 ). Various negative controls for the protA-TRIC binding were used, including beads carrying no fusion protein"
https://openalex.org/W2151897657,"Recently, we reported that the mutation of His207 to Phe located in the second extracellular loop of the cholecystokinin B receptor strongly affected cholecystokinin (CCK) binding (Silvente-Poirot, S., Escrieut, C., and Wank, S. A. (1998) Mol. Pharmacol. 54, 364–371). To characterize the functional group in CCK that interacts with His207, we first substituted His207 to Ala. This mutation decreased the affinity and the potency of CCK to produce total inositol phosphates 302-fold and 456-fold without affecting the expression of the mutant receptor. The screening ofl-alanine-modified CCK peptides to bind and activate the wild type and mutant receptors allowed the identification of the interaction of the C-terminal Asp8 of CCK with His207. The H207A-CCKBR mutant, unlike the wild type receptor, was insensitive to substitution of Asp8 of CCK to other amino acid residues. This interaction was further confirmed by mutating His207 to Asp. The affinity of CCK for the H207D-CCKBR mutant was 100-fold lower than for the H207A-CCKBR mutant, consistent with an electrostatic repulsion between the negative charges of the two interacting aspartic acids. Peptides with neutral amino acids in position eight of CCK reversed this effect and displayed a gain of affinity for the H207D mutant compared with CCK. To date, this is the first report concerning the identification of a direct contact point between the CCKB receptor and CCK. Recently, we reported that the mutation of His207 to Phe located in the second extracellular loop of the cholecystokinin B receptor strongly affected cholecystokinin (CCK) binding (Silvente-Poirot, S., Escrieut, C., and Wank, S.

To date, this is the first report concerning the identification of a direct contact point between the CCKB receptor and CCK. cholecystokinin CCK receptor type A CCK receptor type B wild type Bolton-Hunter inositol phosphate norleucine N -(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl high performance liquid chromatography Cholecystokinin (CCK)1is found throughout the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system where it functions both as a hormone and a neurotransmitter (1Rehfeld J.F. van Solinge W.W. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 63: 295-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CCK exists physiologically in multiple forms processed from a 115-amino acid preprohormone. Post-translational processing of CCK involved sulfation of tyrosine at position seven from the C terminus and amidation of the C-terminal phenylalanine. In the gastrointestinal system, CCK regulates motility, pancreatic exocrine secretions and growth, gastric emptying, and inhibition of gastric acid secretion. In the nervous system, CCK is implicated in anxiogenesis, satiety, analgesia, and regulation of dopamine release. The actions of CCK are mediated by two pharmacologically distinct receptor subtypes, the CCKA and the CCKB receptors. The longer sulfated forms (CCK-58, CCK-39, CCK-33, and CCK-8) bind to the CCKAR and CCKBR with similar nanomolar affinities. The nonsulfated peptides as well as shorter C-terminal fragments like CCK-4 and CCK-5 still bind with nanomolar affinities the CCKBR but display very low affinities for the CCKAR. Gastrin, a related family peptide that shares with CCK the C-terminal pentapeptide also discriminates the two subtypes by presenting similar affinity as CCK-8 for the CCKBR but micromolar affinity for CCKAR. Studies using synthesized CCK fragments have shown that the C-terminal sulfated and amidated octapeptide Asp-Tyr(SO3H)-Met-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2retains the full spectrum of biological activity (2Silvente-Poirot S. Dufresne M. Vaysse N. Fourmy D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 513-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 3Crawley J.N. Corwin R.L.

The cloning of the cDNA coding for these receptors has shown that CCKA and CCKB receptors belong to the superfamily of seven transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor and that they have approximately 50% homology (6Wank S.A.

Due to the important physiological roles of CCK acting through these two receptor subtypes and, therefore, its possible implication in associated disorders, there has been considerable interest in the identification of ligands that selectively activate or inhibit the CCKAR and CCKBR. However, to date none of these compounds have been used as a therapeutic agent (8Woodruff G.N. Hughes J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1991; 31: 469-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 9Iversen L.L. Dourish C.T. Iversen S.D. Biochem. Soc.

The characterization of the interactions between the key pharmacophores of CCK and their partners in the receptor would certainly help in a more rational approach to the design of new molecules or the modification of preexisting molecules to optimize their properties. Despite numerous studies concerning the identification of amino acids involved in the binding site of agonist and antagonist ligands for the different classes of G-protein-coupled receptors (14Schwartz T.W. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 15Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Graziano M.P. Tota M.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), very few studies concerned the identification of the functional groups in the ligand that directly interact with the identified amino acid in the receptor. However such studies are essential to model the binding pocket accurately. One way to address this issue is through the use of complementary substitutions in the ligand and the receptor as previously reported for G protein-coupled receptors for neurotransmitters and peptide receptors (16Strader C.D.

We successfully used this approach for the CCKA receptor subtype to demonstrate that two amino acids Trp39 and Gln40, located in the N-terminal domain of the CCKAR, interact with the residues Arg1 and Asp2 of CCK (21Kennedy K. Gigoux V. Escrieut C. Maigret B. Martinez J. Moroder L. Frehel D. Gully D. Vaysse N. Fourmy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2920-2926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified another interaction between Met195, located in the second extracellular loop of CCKAR, and the aromatic ring of sulfated tyrosine of CCK (Tyr3), an important pharmacophore for conferring high affinity and activity of the peptide (22Gigoux V. Escrieut C. Silvente-Poirot S. Maigret B. Gouilleux L. Fehrentz J.A. Gully D. Moroder L. Vaysse N. Fourmy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14380-14386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To date, no such study has been reported for the CCKBR. We demonstrated by mutational analysis of the CCKBR that the extracellular domains of the CCKBR are also implicated in the high affinity binding of CCK and gastrin (23Silvente-Poirot S. Wank S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14698-146706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 24Silvente-Poirot S. Escrieut C. Wank S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We showed that the mutation of the residue His207, located in the second extracellular loop of the CCKBR induced a dramatic decrease in CCK binding (24Silvente-Poirot S. Escrieut C. Wank S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Regarding the important role of the second extracellular loop for the high affinity binding of CCK in the CCKAR, the present study was undertaken to determine the amino acid within CCK that interacts with His207 in the CCKBR. The screening of modified CCK peptides for their binding and biological activity toward the wild type receptor and a variety of His207-CCKB receptor mutants permitted us to demonstrate that His207 directly interacts with the C-terminal aspartic acid of CCK, an essential residue for this family of peptides. The sulfated C-terminal nonapeptide of CCK [Thr28, Nle31]-CCK25-33 ((Thr,Nle)CCK1-9s), the tetrapeptide CCK-30-33 (CCK6-9), and the sulfated heptapeptide [Nle28,31]-CCK27-33 (CCK3-9s) were synthesized as described previously (25Moroder L. Wilschowitz L. Gemeiner M. Gohring W. Knof S. Scharf R. Thamm P. Gardner J.D. Solomon T.E. Wunsch E. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1981; 362: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The sulfated and nonsulfated C-terminal octapeptide (CCK2-9s and CCK2-9) were from Neosystem, Strasbourg, France. 125INa was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. (Thr28,Nle31)-CCK25-33 was conjugated with Bolton-Hunter reagent, purified, radioiodinated as described previously (26Fourmy D. Lopez P. Poirot S. Jimenez J. Dufresne M. Moroder L. Powers S.P. Vaysse N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and referred to as 125I-BH-(Thr,Nle)CCK1-9s. Thel-alanine-modified peptides were synthesized by solid phase synthesis on a Pioneer Perseptive Biosystems apparatus using Fmoc-peptide amide linker-polyethylene glycol flow continuous resin. Fmoc amino acid side chains were protected with the acid-labile protecting groups (Asp: t -butyl; Tyr: t -butyl; Trp, t -butyloxycarbonyl). Coupling reactions were carried out with a 4-fold excess of Fmoc-protected amino acid residues, reagent HBTU (2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3,-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate), and diisopropylethylamine for 1 h. At the end of the synthesis, the Fmoc-protecting group was removed, and the peptidyl resin was treated at room temperature for 2 h with 10 ml of reagent K solution (trifluoroacetic acid/water/phenol/thioanisole/ethanedithiol 82.5/5/5/5/2.5). The peptides were isolated by precipitation with diethyl ether, solubilized in a mixture of acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid (50/50/0.1, v/v/v), and lyophilized. These peptides were purified by reverse phase HPLC using a Waters Delta Prep 4000 instrument on a Delta-Pak C18 column (15 μm, 100 × 150 mm) with UV detection at 214 nm at a flow rate of 50 ml/min of water/trifluoroacetic acid (0.1%) and acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid (0.1%). The purity of the peptides was checked by analytical reverse phase HPLC with a Beckman instrument on a Delta-Pak C18 analytical column. The peptide structure was assessed by mass spectroscopy on a Platform II (Micromass, Manchester, UK) quadrupole mass spectrometer fitted with an electrospray interface. Mutant receptor cDNAs were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene, France) using the rat CCKBR cDNAs as template. Oligonucleotides were designed to include a silent restriction site to facilitate analysis of mutant constructs by restriction endonuclease digestion. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing using an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. Two μg of the CCKBR and mutant receptor cDNAs subcloned in pCDL-SRa were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells using the DEAE/dextran method as described previously (23Silvente-Poirot S. Wank S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14698-146706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection, the transfected cells were transferred to 24-well culture plates, seeded at a density of approximately 1 × 105 cells/well, and assayed for 125I-BH-CCK-9 binding or inositol phosphate hydrolysis. Twenty-four h after the transfer of transfected cells to 24-well plates, the cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 60 min at 37 °C with either 50 pm (WT-CCKBR) or 500 pm (H207A-CCKBR) of125I-BH-(Thr,Nle)CCK1-9s with and without increasing concentrations of unlabeled peptides. Cell-associated125I-BH-(Thr,Nle)CCK1-9s was separated from free radioligand by washing 2× with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin. Cell-associated125I-BH-(Thr,Nle)CCK1-9s was collected with 0.5 ml of 0.1n NaOH added to each well, and radioactivity was detected in a γ counter. Nonspecific binding (determined in presence of 1 μm CCK-8) was always less than 10% that of total binding. Plasma membranes from transfected COS cells were prepared as described in Kennedy et al. (21Kennedy K. Gigoux V. Escrieut C. Maigret B. Martinez J. Moroder L. Frehel D. Gully D. Vaysse N. Fourmy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2920-2926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and incubated (50–100 μg) with 500 pm [3H]L-365,260 for 45 mn at 37 °C in the presence of increasing L-365,260 concentrations (27Chang R.S. Chen T.B. Bock M.G. Freidinger R.M. Chen R. Rosegay A. Lotti V.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 803-808PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation, the membranes were washed and filtered through Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters over a vacuum-filtering manifold. Filters were counted in a β counter. Binding assays were performed in duplicate in at least three separate experiments. Binding data were determined using the nonlinear, least squares curve-fitting computer program, Ligand (28Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7759) Google Scholar) and GraphPad Prism Program (Software).K i values were calculated as K i = IC50/(1 + [labeled ligand]/K d of labeled ligand). Twenty-four h after COS-7 cell transfection, the transfected cells were transferred to 24-well culture plates and incubated overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2 μCi/well of myo -2-[3H]inositol (18.6 Ci/mmol)( NEN Life Science Products). After the aspiration of the medium containing the myo -[3H]inositol, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min with 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mm LiCl. The cells were washed with PI buffer. pH 7.45 (20 mm Hepes, 135 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm LiCl, 11.1 mm glucose, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin), incubated 1 h at 37 °C with PI buffer containing the indicated concentrations of peptides. The reaction was stopped with 1 ml of methanol/HCl added to each well, and the content was transferred to a AG 1-X8 (formate form) column (Bio-Rad). Each column was washed twice with 3 ml of water followed by 2 ml of 5 mm sodium tetraborate, 60 mm sodium formate. Total inositol phosphates were eluted from the column with 2 ml of 1m ammonium formate, 100 mm formic acid.myo -[3H]inositol phosphate β radioactivity was detected in a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.). EC50 was calculated using GraphPad Prism program software. In a recent work, we have shown (24Silvente-Poirot S. Escrieut C. Wank S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) that the mutation of His207 in the CCKBR to phenylalanine (the equivalent amino acid in the CCKAR) resulted in a marked decrease in CCK affinity. Upon transient expression of the H207F-CCKBR mutant into COS cells, there was no detectable binding of radiolabeled CCK, and there was a 3,044-fold reduction in CCK-stimulated inositol phosphate production compared with the WT-CCKBR. All together these results suggested that His207 was crucial for conferring high affinity to CCK (24Silvente-Poirot S. Escrieut C. Wank S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to identify the amino acid residue within CCK that interacts with His207. We first tried a potentially less drastic exchange by mutating His207 to Ala. This mutation resulted in undetectable binding of 125I-BH-(Thr,Nle)CCK1-9s to the H207A-CCKBR mutant transiently expressed in COS-7 cells using standard radioligand concentration (50 pm). By contrast, significant125I-BH-(Thr,Nle)CCK1-9s binding was observed in the presence of 500 pm radioligand. Under these conditions, Scatchard analysis of CCK octapeptide (CCK2-9s) competition binding to the H207A-CCKBR mutant revealed a single class of binding sites with an affinity of 232 (±12) nm and a maximal binding capacity of 4.35 (±1.52) pmol/106 cells. Compared with the WT-CCKBR, which had an affinity of 0.51 (±0.15) nm and a maximal binding capacity of 2.13 (±1.62) pmol/106 cells, the H207A-CCKBR mutant displayed a decrease in CCK2-9s affinity of 456-fold despite a similar level of cell surface expression. This mutant also retained similar efficacy compared with WT-CCKBR (11-fold over basal) for CCK2-9s-stimulated increase in total IP production, although the EC50 was 302-fold higher than the WT-CCKBR (EC50: 145 (±79) nm versus 0.48 (±0.3) nm). The decrease in CCK2-9s potency to stimulate IP production correlates well with the decrease in CCK2-9s affinity observed for the H207A-CCKBR mutant (302-fold versus 456-fold). On the basis of the marked shift observed in CCK2-9s affinity and potency when His207 was mutated to Ala, we hypothesized that His207 might interact with a crucial amino acid of CCK. Since no previous CCK structure-function studies have been reported for the CCKBR in any expression systems, we first determined to what extent each amino acid of CCK contributes to its affinity and potency for stimulation of total IP in the WT-CCKBR transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. For that, we tested different fragments of CCK and synthesized CCK octapeptides modified by replacing each single amino acid by an l-alanine. We expected similar affinity and potency decreases resulting from alanine substitutions in the receptor and in the ligand. In this first screening, thel-alanine-modified peptides were synthesized in a nonsulfated form for the convenience of the synthesis. As shown in Table I, the N-terminal extension of CCK has a small effect on the affinity and activity of CCK peptides. CCK1-9s and CCK3-9s have similar affinities and potencies for the WT-CCKBR than CCK2-9s, indicating that Arg1 and Asp2 do not contribute to the activity and affinity of CCK. The absence of sulfate on the Tyr3 decreases by 5.6-fold the affinity and by 4-fold the potency of CCK2-9, whereas the complete exchange of the sulfated Tyr3 by an Ala induces a 28-fold and 16-fold decrease in affinity and potency, respectively. These data are close to that found with the C-terminal tetrapeptide (CCK6-9), which displays a 16-fold and 12-fold decrease in affinity and potency, respectively, compared with CCK2-9s. In addition, the exchange of Thr4 and Gly5 to Ala had no further additional effect on affinity and potency, indicating that only the presence of the sulfated Tyr3 slightly increases the affinity and potency of CCK peptides compared with CCK6-9. Together these data suggest that the important shift observed in both affinity and potency of CCK2-9s for the H207A-CCKBR mutant could not be due to an interaction of His207 with one of the N-terminal amino acids, 1 to 5, of CCK. We then tested the contribution of the last four C-terminal amino acids. As shown in Table I, the exchange of Trp6 by Ala induces a dramatic decrease in both the affinity and potency. It was difficult to determine an accurateK i because [Ala6]CCK2-9 bound the WT-CCKBR with a very low affinity. Consistent with this result, the EC50 of [Ala6]CCK2-9 was reduced 13,975-fold. These results are not in favor of an interaction of Trp6with His207, because Trp6 substitution results in a large decrease in the affinity and potency of the modified peptide for the WT-CCKBR, which does not correlate with that of CCK2-9s for the H207A-CCKBR mutant. The affinities of [Ala7]CCK2-9 and [Ala9]CCK2-9 were reduced 5,224- and 5,008-fold, respectively, which correlated with the 4,629- and 6,837-fold decrease in potencies observed for these two peptides, whereas the exchange of Asp8 by Ala induces a less important decrease in the affinity and potency of [Ala8]CCK2-9 with a shift of 1,191- and 935-fold, respectively (Table I). Considering that these peptides are not sulfated, the decrease in the affinities and potencies of [Ala7]CCK2-9, [Ala8]CCK2-9, and [Ala9]CCK2-9 for the WT-CCKBR are closed to the 456- and 302-fold reduction in CCK2-9s affinity and potency observed for the H207A-CCKBR mutant, suggesting that these residues could interact with His207.Table IAffinities and potencies of CCK peptides, CCK fragments, andl-alanine-modified CCK peptides for the WT-CCKBR transiently expressed in COS cellsPeptidesBindingInositol phosphate productionK iF CCK2–9sEC50E maxF CCK2–9snmnm%CCK1–9sNH2-Arg1-Asp2-Tyr3(SO3H)-Thr4-Gly5-Trp6-Nle7-Asp8-Phe9-NH20.43 (±0.12)0.90.73 (±0.14)1001.5CCK2–9sNH2-Asp2-Tyr3(SO3H)-Met4-Gly5-Trp6-Met7-Asp8-Phe9-NH20.45 (±0.13)10.48 (±0.12)1001CCK3–9sNH2-Tyr3(SO3H)-Met4-Gly5-Trp6-Met7-Asp8-Phe9-NH20.71 (±0.23)1.60.52 (±0.21)1001CCK2–9NH2-Asp2-Tyr3-Met4-Gly5-Trp6-Met7-Asp8-Phe9-NH22.51 (±0.81)5.61.96 (±0.56)1004[Ala2]CCK2–9NH2-Ala2-Tyr3-Nle4-Gly5-Trp6-Nle7-Asp8-Phe9-NH23.48 (±1.12)7.72.36 (±0.24)1004.9[Ala3]CCK2–9NH2-Asp2-Ala3-Nle4-Gly5-Trp6-Nle7-Asp8-Phe9-NH212.82 (±1.82)287.59 (±2.18)10016[Ala4]CCK2–9NH2-Asp2-Tyr3-Ala4-Gly5-Trp6-Nle7-Asp8-Phe9-NH27.78 (±1.25)172.78 (±0.52)1006[Ala5]CCK2–9NH2-Asp2-Tyr3-Nle4-Ala5-Trp6-Nle7-Asp8-Phe9-NH28.13 (±0.71)184.88 (±1.32)10010[Ala6]CCK2–9NH2-Asp2-Tyr3-Nle4-Gly5-Ala6-Nle7-Asp8-Phe9-NH2NDND6708 (±633)6813,975[Ala7]CCK2–9NH2-Asp2-Tyr3-Nle4-Gly5-Trp6-Ala7-Asp8-Phe9-NH22351 (±175)52242222 (±169)904629[Ala8]CCK2–9NH2-Asp2-Tyr3-Nle4-Gly5-Trp6-Nle7-Ala8-Phe9-NH2536 (±134)1191449 (±58)90935[Ala9]CCK2–9NH2-Asp2-Tyr3-Nle4-Gly5-Trp6-Nle7-Asp8-Ala9-NH22254 (±213)50083282 (±403)926837CCK6-9NH2-Trp6-Met7-Asp8-Phe9-CONH27.42 (±1.20)165.66 (±0.38)10012K i values were calculated from competition curves of125I-BH-(Thr,Nle)CCK1–9s binding by the indicated peptides.

The efficacies of the peptides tested to stimulate total inositol phosphate production are expressed as the percent of the maximal increase obtained using 1 × 10−6mCCK2–9s and referred as E max. ND, not determined. We subsequently tested the equivalent sulfated compounds [Ala7]CCK2-9s, [Ala8]CCK2-9s, and [Ala9]CCK2-9s on the WT-CCKBR and H207A-CCKBR to determine if these residues interact with His207. We hypothesized that removing the functional group in CCK that interacts with His207 should not further affect the affinity and potency of the modified peptide for the H207A-CCKBR mutant compared with CCK2-9s, because the mutation should have already disrupted the interaction. On the contrary, exchanging a functional group that does not interact with His207 should induce an additional decrease in the affinity and potency of the modified peptide for the H207A-CCKBR mutant. As shown in TableII, [Ala7]CCK2-9s displayed a 321- and 268-fold lower affinity and potency for the H207A-CCKBR mutant compared with CCK2-9s. The decrease in the affinity and potency of [Ala7]CCK2-9s for the WT-CCKBR was in the same range, 686- and 650-fold, respectively. No inhibition of125I-BH-(Thr,Nle)CCK1-9s binding and no production of IP at a concentration of 10−4m were observed with [Ala9]CCK2-9s on the H207A-CCKBR mutant, indicating a dramatic shift in the affinity and potency. This peptide displayed a 4897- and 5025-fold lower affinity and potency than CCK2-9s on the WT-CCKBR. Together, these results indicate that Met7 and Phe9 modifications of CCK and H207A mutation effects are additive and support that Met7 and Phe9 do not interact with His207. In contrast to that observed with [Ala7]CCK2-9s and [Ala9]CCK2-9s, the affinity and potency of [Ala8]CCK2-9s for the H207A-CCKBR mutant were similar to that CCK2-9s but were decreased 460- and 151-fold, respectively, for the WT-CCKBR (Fig.1, right , and Table II). Thus, [Ala8]CCK2-9s, unlike CCK2-9s, [Ala7]CCK2-9s, and [Ala9] CCK2-9s, is insensitive to the H207A mutation. These results and the fact that [Ala8]CCK2-9s had a similar affinity and potency for the H207A-CCKBR mutant and the WT-CCKBR suggest a direct interaction between Asp8 of CCK and His207 (Fig. 1 and Table II). To confirm this interaction, these data were analyzed according to the mutant cycle methodology of Hidalgo and MacKinnon (29Hidalgo P. MacKinnon R. Science. 1995; 268: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) and Schreiber and Fersht (30Schreiber G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 478-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Ω values, defined as Ω =K i (WT:WT) × K i(mut:mut)/K i (WT:mut) × K i(mut:WT), determined if two modified or mutated residues are independent of one another (Ω will be unity) or if these residues interact (Ω will deviate from unity). As shown in Table II, the large Ω value for the [Ala8]-CCK2-9s/H207A-CCKBR pair supports that Asp8 interacts specifically with His207. This contrasts with the Ω value for the [Ala7]-CCK2-9s/H207A-CCKBR pair that is near unity, suggesting that Met7 does not interact with His207. Similarly, our inability to determine Ω value for the [Ala9]-CCK2-9s/H207A-CCKBR pair is compatible with their independence. Together these results provide further support for a direct and specific interaction of Asp8 with His207.Table IIAffinities and potencies of CCK2–9s and modified CCK2–9s peptides for the WT-CCKBR and H207A-CCKBR mutant transiently expressed in COS cellsWT-CCKBRH207A-CCKBR, WT-CCKBRH207A-CCKBRK iF CCK2–9sK iF CCK2–9sFWTEC50F CCK2–9sE maxEC50F CCK2–9sFWTE maxnmnmnm%nm%CCK2–9s0.45 (±0.13)1117 (±5)12600.48 (±0.12)1100145 (±79)1302100[Ala7]CCK2–9s309 (±99)68637620 (±689)3211212312 (±87)6507038945 (±1256)26812440[Ala8]CCK2–9s207 (±33)460278 (±93)2119372.7 (±9.5)15180418 (±121)3640[Ala9]CCK2–9s2202 (±132)4897NDNDNDND2412 (±214)502560NDNDNDNDK i values were calculated from competition curves of125I-BH-(Thr,Nle)CCK1–9s binding by the indicated peptides.

(1998) Am. J. Physiol. 275, C423–C430). Here we identified structural domains in the exchanger that confer differential sensitivity to Ni2+ or Li+ by measuring intracellular Na+-dependent45Ca2+ uptake in CCL39 cells stably expressing NCX1/NCX3 chimeras or mutants. We found that two segments in the exchanger corresponding mostly to the internal α-1 and α-2 repeats are individually responsible for the alteration of Ni2+sensitivity, both together accounting for ∼80% of the difference between NCX1 and NCX3. In contrast, the segment corresponding to the α-2 repeat fully accounts for the differential Li+sensitivity between the isoforms. The Ni2+ sensitivity was mimicked, respectively, by simultaneous substitution of two amino acids in the α-1 repeat (N125G/T127I in NCX1 and G159N/I161T in NCX3) and substitution of one amino acid in the α-2 repeat (V820A in NCX1 and A809V in NCX3). On the other hand, the Li+ sensitivity was mimicked by double substitution mutation in the α-2 repeat (V820A/Q826V in NCX1 and A809V/V815Q in NCX3). Single substitution mutations at Asn125 and Val820 of NCX1 caused significant alterations in the interactions of the exchanger with Ca2+ and Ni2+, and Ni2+ and Li+, respectively, although the extent of alteration varied depending on the nature of side chains of substituted residues. Since the above four important residues are mostly in the putative loops of the α repeats, these regions might form an ion interaction domain in the exchanger.

In the transmembrane domain of all members of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger family, there are two highly conserved internal repeat sequences designated the α-1 and α-2 repeats that comprise most of TMs 2–3 and 8–9 and the loops connecting these TMs, respectively (5Nicoll D.A.

In such repeat sequences, the putative loop regions are more variable than the transmembrane segments. These homologous sequences may be functionally important, because mutations in the putative TMs within the α repeats cause a large reduction in exchange activity or a change in the I-V relationship in NCX1 (5Nicoll D.A.

In addition, the Thr103 to Val mutation at the cytoplasmic end of TM2 in NCX1 produces changes in the apparent affinity for intracellular Na+ and the selectivity for Li+ (7Doering A.E. Nicoll D.A.

Therefore these repeat sequences might form part of the structure involved in the ion translocation in the exchanger molecule. We have recently found that three mammalian exchanger isoforms have distinct differences in their biochemical and pharmacological properties (20Iwamoto T. Shigekawa M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C423-C430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Divalent cation Ni2+ inhibits the reverse mode of Na+/Ca2+ exchange in NCX3 with a 10-fold less affinity than in NCX1 or NCX2. On the other hand, the recently identified inhibitor KB-R7943 is 3-fold more inhibitory to NCX3 than to NCX1 or NCX2. Furthermore, stimulation of Na+/Ca2+ exchange by externally added monovalent cation Li+ is significantly greater in NCX2 and NCX3 than in NCX1, although these isoforms exhibit low affinity for Li+. Despite these differences, however, all the NCX isoforms have similar apparent affinities for extracellular transport substrates Ca2+ and Na+ (20Iwamoto T. Shigekawa M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C423-C430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Linck B. Qiu Z. He Z. Tong Q. Hilgemann D.W. Philipson K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C415-C423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, taking advantage of high sequence identity in the NCX isoforms, we used chimeric constructs between NCX1 and NCX3 to study the structural domain(s) responsible for the difference in their sensitivity to Ni2+ or Li+. We identified four amino acid residues within the α-1 and α-2 repeats of the exchanger molecule that are predominantly responsible for the observed differential effects of Ni2+ and Li+. CCL39 cells (American Type Culture Collection) and their NCX transfectants were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7.5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. cDNAs of dog heart NCX1.1 and rat brain NCX3.3 were subcloned into Sac II and Hin dIII sites in pCRII (designated pCRII-NCX1 and pCRII-NCX3, respectively) (18Iwamoto T.

For construction of chimeras between NCX1 and NCX3, several unique restriction enzyme sites were newly introduced into pCRII-NCX1 and pCRII-NCX3 at analogous positions in the NCX cording regions by site-directed mutagenesis (13Iwamoto T.

Generation of these sites preserved the native amino acid sequences. The modified plasmids were designated pCRII-NCX1′ and pCRII-NCX3′.

N1-718/787 and N3-707/776 chimeras were constructed after creating new unique sites forEco RV at positions 718 and 707 in pCRII-NCX1′ and pCRII-NCX3′, respectively (Fig. 1), which resulted in substitution of one amino acid (V719I in N1-718/787 and V708I in N3-707/776). Successful construction of the modified cDNAs was verified by sequencing (ABI PRISM, Perkin-Elmer). These cDNAs were transferred into Sac II and Hin dIII sites of the mammalian expression vector pKCRH (23Mishina M. Kurosaki T. Tobimatsu T. Morimoto Y. Noda M. Yamamoto T. Terao M. Lindstrom J. Takahashi T. Kuno M. Numa S. Nature. 1984; 307: 604-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Substitution of amino acid residues within the internal α repeat regions was performed by site-directed mutagenesis. In this procedure, DNA fragments were produced by polymerase chain reaction using pCRII-NCX1 or pCRII-NCX3 as a template and following pairs of primers: for mutation in the α-1 repeat, the sense primers contained an exogenous Bam HI site and normal NCX sequences, whereas the antisense primers contained sequences with substituted nucleotides and an exogenous Sal I site; for mutation in the α-2 repeat, the sense primers contained an exogenous Nhe I site and normal NCX sequences, while the antisense primers contained an exogenous Mlu I site and sequences with desired mutations. The polymerase chain reaction products were digested with eitherBam HI and Sal I or Nhe I andMlu I, and inserted into pCRII-NCX1′ or pCRII-NCX3′, and then the full-length mutant cDNAs were transferred into pKCRH. Successful construction was verified by sequencing. To stably express chimeric and mutant exchangers, pKCRH plasmids carrying NCX cDNAs were transfected in the presence of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) into CCL39 fibroblasts that exhibit little endogenous Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity (13Iwamoto T. Pan Y. Nakamura T.Y. Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17230-17238Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20Iwamoto T. Shigekawa M. Am. J.

Cell clones expressing high Na+/Ca2+exchange activity were selected by a Ca2+-killing procedure as described previously (24Iwamoto T. Wakabayashi S. Imagawa T. Shigekawa M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Assay of Na+i-dependent45Ca2+ uptake into cells were described in detail previously (20Iwamoto T. Shigekawa M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C423-C430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent NCX transfectants in 24-well dishes were loaded with Na+ by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min in 0.5 ml of BSS (10 mm Hepes/Tris (pH 7.4), 146 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) containing 1 mm ouabain and 10 μm monensin.45Ca2+ uptake was then initiated by switching the medium to Na+-free BSS (replacing NaCl with equimolar choline chloride) or to normal BSS, both of which contained 0.1 mm45CaCl2 (1.5 μCi/ml) and 1 mm ouabain. After a 30-s incubation,45Ca2+ uptake was terminated by washing cells four times with an ice-cold solution containing 10 mm Hepes/Tris (pH 7.4), 120 mm choline chloride, and 10 mmLaCl3. Cells were then solubilized with 0.1 nNaOH, and aliquots were taken for determination of radioactivity and protein. Outward and inward currents from NCX transfectants were measured using the whole cell voltage clamp technique as described previously (25Uehara A. Iwamoto T. Shigekawa M. Imanaga I. Pflügers Arch. 1997; 434: 335-338PubMed Google Scholar). For recording the outward current, the external solution contained 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0 or 2 mm CaCl2, 20 μm ouabain, 2 μm nicardipine, 5 μm ryanodine, and 5 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), whereas the pipette solution contained 20 mm NaCl, 90 mm CsOH, 40 mmaspartic acid, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mmCaCl2, 5 mm MgATP, 5 mmK2CrP, 20 mm BAPTA, and 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.2). The ionized Ca2+ concentration in the pipette solution was calculated to be 0.14 μm. The outward exchange current was activated by switching the external solution from one without CaCl2 to one with CaCl2. For recording the inward current, the external solution contained 140 mm choline chloride or NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 20 μm ouabain, 2 μmnicardipine, 10 μm ryanodine, and 5 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), while the pipette solution contained 30 mm CsCl, 90 mm CsOH, 50 mm aspartic acid, 3 mm MgCl2, 16 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgATP, 5 mm K2CrP, 20 mm BAPTA, and 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.2). The ionized Ca2+ concentration in the pipette solution was calculated to be 1.75 μm. The inward exchange current was induced by switching the choline chloride-containing external medium to the Na+-containing external medium. All experiments were performed at about 35 °C and the holding and test potentials were −40 mV. All data were acquired and analyzed by the pCLAMP (Axon Instrument) software. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. of three to five independent determinations. Differences for multiple comparisons were analyzed by unpaired t test or one-way ANOVA followed by the Dunnett's test. Values ofp < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. We previously measured the whole cell current from cloned dog cardiac NCX1 expressed in CCL39 cells using a conventional patch-clamp technique (25Uehara A. Iwamoto T. Shigekawa M. Imanaga I. Pflügers Arch. 1997; 434: 335-338PubMed Google Scholar). Using the same method, we measured the outward and inward currents evoked in NCX1- or NCX3-transfected CCL39 cells by the extracellular application of 2 mm Ca2+ or 140 mm Na+(Fig. 2, A and B ). These currents were reproducibly measured; after a recovery interval, a second pulse of Ca2+ or Na+ generated the outward or inward current whose peak value was 96–102% of the corresponding first current. However, they were never observed in nontransfected CCL39 cells. Inclusion of Ni2+ in the external medium caused inhibition of the outward and inward currents (Fig. 2, A and B ). We found that the outward current in NCX1-transfected cells was approximately 10-fold more sensitive to Ni2+ than that in NCX3-transfected cells (IC50, 39 versus 310 μm) and that the inhibition in these cells reached 92 and 81%, respectively, at 3 mm Ni2+ (Fig. 2 C ). A similar difference in the sensitivity to Ni2+ was observed for the inward currents in NCX1- and NCX3-transfected cells (IC50, 25 versus >100 mm), although its inhibition by Ni2+ occurred at much greater concentrations compared with the outward current (Fig. 2, C and D ). Our previous measurement of Ni2+ dependence of Na+i-dependent45Ca2+ uptake gave IC50 values of 33 and 343 μm for Ni2+ in NCX1- and NCX3-transfected CCL39 cells, respectively (Ref. 20Iwamoto T. Shigekawa M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C423-C430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, see also Fig. 3,inset ), in agreement with the observed inhibitory potencies of Ni2+ on the outward current. Thus both electrophysiological and biochemical data establish that NCX1 and NCX3 exhibit a 10-fold difference in the sensitivity to Ni2+, at least when they function in the reverse exchange mode. Taking advantage of the fact that NCX1 and NCX3 exhibit high amino acid homology, we used chimeric constructs between the two isoforms to study the structural domain(s) responsible for the difference in their sensitivity to Ni2+. Using endogenous or newly introduced common restriction enzyme sites, we constructed two series of chimeric cDNAs in which one or two segments from NCX3 were incorporated into NCX1 in exchange for the homologous segment(s) in the latter (N1 series chimeras), and vice versa (N3 series chimeras) (see Fig. 1). We stably expressed these chimeras in CCL39 fibroblasts. All transfectants, after selection by a Ca2+-killing procedure, exhibited exchange activities similar to that of cells expressing the wild-type NCX1 or NCX3 (see the legend to Fig.3). We examined the effect of 0.1 mm Ni2+ on the initial rate of Na+i-dependent45Ca2+ uptake into cells expressing these chimeric exchangers (Fig. 3). Under the conditions used, Ni2+ at this concentration reduced the uptake rate of the wild-type NCX1 or NCX3 by 77 or 24%, respectively. N1 series chimeras N1-109/133, N1-788/829, and N1-109/133,788/829, which contained the homologous Bam HI-Sal I and/orNhe I-Mlu I segments from NCX3 (Fig. 1), exhibited significantly less sensitivity to inhibition by 0.1 mmNi2+ compared with the wild-type NCX1 (Fig. 3 A ). In contrast, N3 series chimeras N3-143/167, N3-777/818, and N3-143/167,777/818 containing the Bam HI-Sal I and/or Nhe I-Mlu I segments from NCX1 (Fig. 1) were more sensitive to inhibition by Ni2+ compared with the wild-type NCX3 (Fig. 3 B ). All other chimeras, however, were not significantly different from the parental NCX1 or NCX3. For some of those chimeras with an altered sensitivity to Ni2+, we determined dose-response profiles for Ni2+ by measuring the rate of Na+i-dependent45Ca2+ in the presence of 0.001 to 1 mm Ni2+. The IC50 values for this cation were 343 ± 28 μm for NCX3, 258 ± 15 μm for N1-109/133,788/829, 93 ± 5 μmfor N1-109/133, 59 ± 4 μm for N1-788/829, 65 ± 7 μm for N3-143/167,777/818, and 33 ± 3 μm for NCX1. All these results indicate that theBam HI-Sal I and Nhe I-Mlu I segments are individually responsible for the alteration of Ni2+ sensitivity and simultaneous replacement of both accounts for ∼80% of the difference in Ni2+ sensitivity between the wild-type NCX1 and NCX3. Intriguingly, the Bam HI-Sal I andNhe I-Mlu I segments correspond, respectively, to the major portions of the phylogenetically conserved regions of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger designated the α-1 and α-2 repeats (see Fig. 1) (19Schwarz E.M. Benzer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10249-10254Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Na+/Ca2+exchange has been shown to be highly sensitive to mutagenesis in the putative transmembrane helices within the α repeats (5Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Matsuoka S. Frank J.S. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13385-13391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), suggesting the functional importance of these regions. Fig. 4 shows amino acid sequences of the α repeat regions from NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3. Of note, in these regions, there are only a small number of amino acids unique to each isoform, all of which are localized within theBam HI-Sal I and Nhe I-Mlu I segments. To identify the residues involved in the differential Ni2+ sensitivity, these unique residues in the α repeats were exchanged between NCX1 and NCX3 or mutated to other amino acids (Fig. 5). Three amino acids Val, Asn, and Thr in the α-1 repeat of NCX1 (corresponding to Val118, Asn125, and Thr127) were replaced with Leu, Gly, and Ile from the same region of NCX3 (corresponding to Leu152, Gly159, and Ile161), respectively, and vice versa . We found that single substitution mutants were not different from the parental NCX1 or NCX3 in their sensitivity to 0.1 mm Ni2+ (Fig. 5,A and B ). On the other hand, double substitution mutants N1-N125G/T127I and its reciprocal mutant N3-G159N/I161T showed decreased and increased sensitivities to inhibition by Ni2+, respectively, which are comparable to those seen in N1-109/133 and N3-143/167 chimeras (compare Figs. 3 and 5). Double mutants N1-V118L/N125G and N1-V118L/T127I, however, exhibited Ni2+ sensitivity similar to that of NCX1 (data not shown). Thus, Asn125 and Thr127 in the α-1 repeat of NCX1 and corresponding Gly159 and Ile161 in NCX3 are responsible for the altered responses of N1-109/133 and N3-143/167 to Ni2+. We also examined the Ni2+sensitivity of NCX1 mutants with Asn125 to Cys (N1-N125C) or Thr127 to Cys substitution (N1-T127C). Interestingly, N1-N125C, but not T127C, exhibited an increased sensitivity to inhibition by Ni2+ relative to that of the parental NCX1 (Fig. 5 A ).Figure 5Effects of Ni2+ on Na+i-dependent45Ca2+ uptake into cells expressing exchangers mutated in the α-1 and α-2 repeats. We constructed single or double substitution mutants in which the amino acid residues in the α-1 and α-2 repeats unique to each NCX isoform were exchanged between NCX1 and NCX3 or mutated to other residues. The initial rates of Na+i-dependent45Ca2+ uptake into cells expressing NCX1 mutants (A ) or NCX3 mutants (B ) were measured in the presence or absence of 0.1 mm Ni2+. The uptake rates in these mutants was 3 to 9 nmol/mg/30 s in the absence of Ni2+. Data are presented as percentage of the values obtained in the absence of Ni2+. Data are mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. *, p < 0.05versus NCX1 (in A ); versus NCX3 (inB ).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next exchanged Leu, Val, Thr, and Gln in the α-2 repeat of NCX1 (corresponding to Leu808, Val820, Thr823, and Gln826), respectively, with Phe, Ala, Leu, and Val (corresponding to Phe797, Ala809, Leu812, and Val815 of NCX 3). Five NCX1 and NCX3 single substitution mutants (N1-L808F, N1-T823L, N1-Q826V, N3-F797L, and N3-L812T) exhibited Ni2+sensitivity not different from the parental NCX1 or NCX3 (Fig. 5,A and B ). In contrast, N1-V820A and its reciprocal mutant N3-A809V showed decreased and increased sensitivities to inhibition by 0.1 mm Ni2+ compared with NCX1 and NCX3, respectively, whereas N3-V815Q exhibited a slightly increased inhibition by Ni2+ relative to NCX3. Double substitution mutants N1-V820A/Q826V and N3-A809V/V815Q, on the other hand, exhibited Ni2+ sensitivities similar to single mutants N1-V820A and N3-A809V, respectively. Thus Val820 of NCX1 and Ala809 of NCX3, and probably Val815 of NCX3, are involved in the determination of Ni2+ sensitivity in the α-2 repeat. We found that the Val820 to Ile substitution in NCX1 (N1-V820I) and the corresponding Ala809 to Ile substitution in NCX3 (N3-A809I) resulted in an increase in the sensitivity to inhibition by Ni2+, whereas substitution of these residues with Gly resulted in a decrease in the Ni2+ sensitivity in N1-V820G, but not in N3-A809G (Fig. 5, A and B ). Other mutants N1-Q826E and N1-Q826R and the corresponding mutants N3-V815E and N3-815R showed the Ni2+ sensitivity not different from that of the parental NCX1 or NCX3. Monovalent cation Li+ stimulates Na+i-dependent45Ca2+ uptake by all three NCX isoforms with low affinity, with the extent of stimulation being greater in NCX2 or NCX3 than in NCX1 (20Iwamoto T. Shigekawa M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C423-C430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain insight into the structural domains involved in the Li+-induced NCX activation, we examined the effect of Li+ on the exchange activities of the chimeras and mutants described above. Consistent with the previous result, extracellular application of Li+ caused a dose-dependent increase in the rate of Na+i-dependent Ca2+ uptake into NCX1- or NCX3-transfected cells, which reached about 145 and 270% at 146 mm Li+, respectively, of the control measured in the absence of Li+ (Fig.6, inset ). Fig. 6,A and B, show the extent of stimulation of the uptake by various chimeras and mutants at 146 mmLi+. Intriguingly, N1-788/829 and N1-109/133,788/829 containing a major portion of the α-2 repeat from NCX3 produced NCX1 mutants exhibiting Li+ sensitivity almost identical to that of the wild-type NCX3. Conversely, the reciprocal mutants N3-777/818 and N3-143/167,777/818 exhibited Li+ sensitivity similar to that in the wild-type NCX1. On the other hand, other N1 and N3 chimeras were not different from the wild-type NCX1 or NCX3, respectively"

Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1975-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The bacterial cells were grown overnight at 37 °C on the surface of Brilliant Green agar (BBL, Becton Dickinson, Cockeysville, MD), and colony morphology was examined the next day. After observing that this culture produced terraced, swarming colonies that extended across 50% of the agar surface, cells at the edge of the swarm colony were transferred to Brilliant Green agar again to confirm the absence of contaminants. Biochemical confirmation of this strain asProteus was made using a commercial package of diagnostic reagents (Enterotube II, Becton-Dickinson) and was confirmed asP. mirabilis by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (Ames, IA), although it atypically failed to ferment two sugars, maltose and xylose. Bacteria were grown in BHI broth, harvested by centrifugation, and washed once in physiologically buffered saline as described by Lee and Cherniak (14Lee L. Cherniak R. Infect. Immun. 1974; 9: 318-322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterial cells (100 g, wet weight) were suspended in 300 ml of water and stirred vigorously in boiling water for 30 min. The suspension was cooled in an ice bath with stirring for 90 min. The cell residue was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g , 30 min, 4 °C), the supernatant adjusted to 1% acetic acid, and crude Cmf-CPS precipitated by the addition of ethanol (2.5 volumes, 24 h, −20 °C). The Cmf-CPS precipitate was collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g , 30 min, 4 °C), washed with ethanol, washed again with acetone, dried, dissolved in water, and lyophilized. This crude Cmf-CPS was suspended in a solution containing 6 ml of EDTA-phosphate (0.05 mNa2HPO4/0.005 m EDTA, pH 7.0), 3 mg of DNase (in 3 ml of 0.04 m MgCl2), and 20 mg of RNase (in 3 ml of 0.04 m MgCl2). This solution was incubated for 16 h at 37 °C followed by the addition of proteinase K (4 μg) and incubated again for 16 h at 37 °C. The resulting solution was dialyzed against distilled water for 48 h and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was lyophilized. The final yield was 800 mg of crude Cmf-CPS. Crude Cmf-CPS was further purified by gel filtration column (90 × 1.6 cm) chromatography using Sephadex G-150 equilibrated with a buffer solution consisting of 0.2 mNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris base, and 0.25% deoxycholic acid (DOC), pH 9.25. The content of each fraction was identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of DOC (DOC-PAGE) using 18% acrylamide (15Komuro T. Galanos C. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 450: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Gels were fixed in the presence or absence of Alcian blue (16Corzo J. Pérez-Galdona R. León-Barrios M. Gutiérrez-Navarro A.M. Electrophoresis. 1991; 12: 439-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and silver-stained (17Tsai C. Frisch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2315) Google Scholar). A fraction of the crude Cmf-CPS was also further purified by mild acid hydrolysis in aqueous 1% acetic acid at 100 °C for 2 h. After hydrolysis, the solution was cooled and centrifuged (10,000 ×g ). The supernatant was extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 10 ml), and the aqueous layer was fractionated on a Sephadex G-75 column (90 × 1.6 cm). The fractions were assayed for hexose with phenol-sulfuric acid. The resulting Cmf-CPS and oligosaccharide (OS) fractions were lyophilized. Samples were prepared for NMR analysis by a 2-fold lyophilization from D2O and dissolved in 0.5 ml of D2O. Spectra were recorded at 60 °C. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm, using sodium 3-trimethylsilylpropanoate-d 4(δH 0.00), and acetone (δC 31.00) as internal references. All NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AMX-500 or DRX-600 MHz spectrometers. Two-dimensional DQF-COSY (18Piantini U. Sørensen O.W. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem.

Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar), and NOESY (21Wider G. Macura S. Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wuthrich K. J. Magn. Reson. 1984; 56: 207-213Google Scholar) data sets were collected in phase-sensitive modes using the States-TPPI (22Marion D. Ikura M. Tschudin R. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 85: 393-399Google Scholar) method. In these experiments, low power presaturation was applied to the residual water (HOD) signal. Typically, data sets of 2048 (t 2) × 512 (t 1) complex points were collected with 16 scans per FID and a sweep width in both dimensions of 6 ppm. The TOCSY experiments contained MLEV17 (23Davis D.G. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 2820-2821Crossref Scopus (1073) Google Scholar) mixing sequences ranging from 60 to 320 ms, and the NOESY mixing delay was 200 ms. A gradient HSQC (24Davis A.L. Keeler J. Laue E.D. Moskau D. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 98: 207-216Google Scholar) data set was collected using the echo/anti-echo method for pure absorption data. A data set of 2048 (t 2) × 512 (t 1) complex points was acquired, with 32 and 64 scans per FID. The sweep width was 7 ppm for proton (F2) and 60 ppm for carbon (F1). The GARP (25Shaka A.J. Barker P.B. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 64: 547-552Google Scholar) sequence was used for 13C decoupling during aquisition. Data were processed typically with a lorentzian-to-gaussian weighting function applied tot 2 and a shifted squared sine bell function and zero-filling applied to t 1. Data shown were processed with Felix software (Molecular Simulations, Inc.). Glycosyl composition of Cmf-CPS (0.5 mg each) was performed by hydrolysis in 0.5 ml of 2m trifluoroacetic acid in a closed vial at 120 °C for 3 h. The glycoses in the hydrolysate were reduced with NaBH4, acetylated, and analyzed by combined gas-liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (GLC-MS) (26York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Stevenson T.T. Albersheim P. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 118: 3-40Crossref Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). For the determination of uronic acid, the Cmf-CPS sample (0.5 mg) was dried in vacuum and methanolyzed in 1 ml of methanolic 2 N HCl at 80 °C for 16 h. The resulting methyl glycosides were either trimethylsilylated and analyzed by GLC-MS (26York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Stevenson T.T. Albersheim P. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 118: 3-40Crossref Scopus (1061) Google Scholar), or they were reduced with NaBH4(10 mg) in water (100 μl), acetylated, and analyzed by GLC-MS. The absolute configurations of the glycoses present were determined by GLC-MS analysis of the trimethylsilylated (S)-(+)-2-butyl and (S)-(−)-2-butyl glycosides (27Gerwig G.J. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Carbohydr. Res. 1978; 62: 349-357Crossref Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 28Gerwig G.J. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Carbohydr. Res. 1979; 77: 1-7Crossref Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Glycosyl linkage analysis was carried out using a modified NaOH method (29Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3206) Google Scholar, 30McConville M.J. Homans S.W. Thomas-Oates J.E. Dell A. Bacic A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7385-7390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sample (1 mg) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (100 μl), powdered NaOH (100 mg) was added, and the reaction mixture was stirred rapidly at room temperature for 30 min. Methylation was performed by the sequential additions of methyl iodide (10, 10, and 20 μl) at 10-min intervals. After an additional 20 min of stirring, 1 ml of 1 m sodium thiosulfate was added, and the methylated glycans were recovered in the organic phase by extraction with chloroform (0.5 ml × 3). The permethylated product was further purified by reverse-phase chromatography using a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (31Waeghe T.J. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Albersheim P. Carbohydr. Res. 1983; 123: 281-304Crossref Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The methylated glycan was hydrolyzed with 2 m trifluoroacetic acid (120 °C, 3 h), reduced with NaB2H4, acetylated, and analyzed by GLC-MS (26York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Stevenson T.T. Albersheim P. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 118: 3-40Crossref Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). For the linkage determination of the uronic acid, the permethylated Cmf-CPS sample (0.5 mg) was dried in vacuum and methanolyzed in 1 ml of methanolic 2 N HCl at 80 °C for 16 h. Released, partially methylated methyl glycosides wereN -acetylated with the addition of 200 μl of methanol, 20 μl′of pyridine, and 20 μl of acetic anhydride at room temperature for 5 h and dried in air. The carboxyl methyl ester of uronic acid was reduced with NaB2H4 (10 mg) in water (100 μl) for 2 h at room temperature, neutralized with acetic acid, and dried in air with the addition of methanol. The carboxyl reduced products were hydrolyzed with 2 m trifluoroacetic acid (120 °C, 3 h), reduced with NaB2H4, acetylated, and analyzed by GLC-MS (26York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Stevenson T.T. Albersheim P. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 118: 3-40Crossref Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). GLC-MS analyses were performed using capillary columns (length, 30 m; inner diameter, 0.32 mm) with helium as the carrier. A DB-5 column (J & W Scientific) was used for aminoglycosyl derivatives, and an SP2330 column (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) was used for the neutral glycosyl derivatives. Analysis of the crude Cmf-CPS by DOC-PAGE (Fig. 1) showed that the crude Cmf-CPS contained some contaminating LPS. The crude Cmf-CPS was separated from the contaminating LPS by a Sephadex G-150 column using buffer containing DOC. The DOC-PAGE analysis of the fractions resulted in a fraction that silver-stained only after fixing the gel in the presence of Alcian blue (Fig. 1 A ), a property characteristic of acidic polysaccharides (32Kim J.S. Reuhs B.L. Rahman M.M. Ridley B. Carlson R.W. Glycobiology. 1996; 5: 433-437Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The low molecular weight fraction silver-stained after being fixed in the presence or absence of Alcian blue, a feature that is characteristic of LPS (32Kim J.S. Reuhs B.L. Rahman M.M. Ridley B. Carlson R.W. Glycobiology. 1996; 5: 433-437Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, the crude Cmf-CPS fraction contained a high molecular weight Cmf-CPSDOC and a low molecular weight LPS (a lipo-oligosaccharide, LOSDOC). During the purification of Cmf-CPSDOC described in the previous paragraph, the sample was subjected to alkaline conditions (pH 9.25) for an extended period of time. Thus, any O- acetyl substituents, if present, would have been removed. To purify Cmf-CPS without removal of O- acetyl groups, a portion of crude Cmf-CPS (50 mg), was hydrolyzed with mild acid and purified by Sephadex G-75 column chromatography. Two fractions were obtained, the high molecular weight Cmf-CPSG75 and low molecular weight oligosaccharides (OSG75) derived from the LOS. The Cmf-CPSG75 eluted just after the void volume, and the OSG75 eluted at twice the void volume (not shown). The yields of Cmf-CPSG75 and OSG75 were 35 and 5 mg, respectively. The results of glycosyl and fatty acid composition analyses of Cmf-CPSDOC, LOSDOC, Cmf-CPSG75, and OSG75 are shown in TableI. Both Cmf-CPSDOC and Cmf-CPSG75 have very similar glycosyl compositions,i.e ., mannuronic acid, galacturonic acid,N -acetyl glucosamine, and N -acetyl galactosamine in a molar ratio of 1:1:1:1. The LOSDOC contains glycosyl residues characteristic of LPS core oligosaccharides, i.e ., glucose, galactose, mannose, d,d-heptose, andl,d-heptose (33Holst O. Brade H. Mol. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 1: 135-170Google Scholar). Fatty acid analysis showed that neither of the Cmf-CPS fractions contained detectable fatty acyl residues, whereas the LOSDOC contained myristic, palmitic, and β-hydroxy myristic acids, a result consistent with the presence of lipid A. Determination of the absolute configurations of the glycoses present in the Cmf-CPS fractions revealed that all glycoses had the d-configuration.Table IComposition of Cmf-CPSDOC, Cmf-CPSG75, LOSDOC, and OSG75 from P. mirabilis WT19ResidueCmf-CPSDOCCRCmf-CPSDOCLOSDOCCmf-CPSG75CRCmf-CPSG75OSG75relative mole %Man−231-aMass spectrometric analysis shows that the alditol acetates of these residues have two deuterium atoms at C6, indicating that they were derived from their corresponding uronosyl residues,i.e. mannose and glucose from mannuronic and glucuronic acids, respectively.3−243Glc−−28−−30Gal−281-aMass spectrometric analysis shows that the alditol acetates of these residues have two deuterium atoms at C6, indicating that they were derived from their corresponding uronosyl residues,i.e. mannose and glucose from mannuronic and glucuronic acids, respectively.24−2525GlcNAc613346030−GalNAc3918−4021−d,d-Hep−−16−−16l,d-Hep−−25−−26C14:0−−+−−−C16:0−−+−−−3-OHC14:0−−+−−−CR, carboxyl-reduced; G75, Sephadex G-75; −, below detectable levels; +, present in significant quantities but not quantified.1-a Mass spectrometric analysis shows that the alditol acetates of these residues have two deuterium atoms at C6, indicating that they were derived from their corresponding uronosyl residues,i.e. mannose and glucose from mannuronic and glucuronic acids, respectively.

Glycosyl linkage analysis was performed by methylation followed by hydrolysis, reduction, and preparation of alditol acetates. Linkage analysis of the uronic acid was performed by methanolysis followed by reduction of the permethylated sample prior to hydrolysis. The glycosyl linkages of the Cmf-CPSDOC are shown in TableII. Prior to carboxyl group reduction, 3-linked N -acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), and 3,4-linked N -acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) were present in a 1:1 ratio. After the carboxyl group reduction, two additional glycosyl residues were observed. The mass spectra and retention times of their partially methylated alditol acetates were consistent with 3,6-linked mannosyl and 6-linked galactosyl residues with two deuteride atoms at C-6, showing that these two residues were derived from 3-linked mannuronic acid and terminally linked galacturonic acid, respectively.Table IIGlycosyl linkage analysis of Cmf-CPSDOC from P. mirabilis WT19Glycosyl ResidueLinkageCmf-CPSDOCCRCmf-CPSDOCrelative mole %Man3,6-linked−222-aThese values are for the partially methylated alditol acetates from carboxyl-reduced (CR) Cmf-CPSDOC.

Open table in a new tab The 1H NMR spectrum of the Cmf-CPSDOC (Fig. 2) confirmed that galactosamine and glucosamine wereN -acetylated, as indicated by a singlet at 2.05 ppm. The1H NMR spectrum of Cmf-CPSG75 fraction (data not shown) was identical to that of Cmf-CPSDOC. The absence of a signal at about δ 2.10 in either Cmf-CPS fraction indicates that the Cmf-CPS does not contain O- acetyl substituents. The anomeric region shows three downfield α-anomeric proton signals (Table III) at δ 5.37, δ 5.17, and δ 5.00 (J H-1,H-2 not resolved) and one β-anomeric proton signal at δ 4.79 (J H-1,H-27.0 Hz). With the aid of two-dimensional COSY (spectrum not shown), TOCSY (Fig. 3 A ), and broad-band decoupled HSQC (spectrum not shown) analyses, most of the1H and 13C NMR signals could be assigned (Tables III and IV). The four glycosyl residues were designatedA–D according to their decreasing anomeric chemical shifts.Table III1H NMR data at 60 °C for the Cmf-CPSDOC isolated from P. mirabilis WT19Glycosyl residueChemical shifts3-aJ 1,2 values are given in square brackets. nr, not resolved.H-1H-2H-3H-4H-5H-6aH-6b→3)-α-d-Glcp NAc-(1→5.37 [3]4.084.074.464.043.723-bThese assignments may be interchanged.3.943-bThese assignments may be interchanged.A→3,4)-α-d-Galp NAc-(1→5.17 [nr]4.594.294.344.433.723-bThese assignments may be interchanged.3.883-bThese assignments may be interchanged.B→3)-α-d-Manp A-(1→5.00 [nr]4.053.803.764.38Cβ-d-Galp A-(1→4.79 [7]3.523.594.384.32D3-a J 1,2 values are given in square brackets. nr, not resolved.3-b These assignments may be interchanged.

The H-1 to H-5 proton signals (TableIII) for residue A were assigned from the COSY and TOCSY (Fig. 3 A ) spectra. A large J H-3,H-4coupling constant (>5 Hz) was observed for A, supporting the conclusion it has a gluco configuration. The carbon signals (Table IV) from C-1 to C-5 for residue A were determined from the HSQC spectrum. The C-2 chemical shift of residue A is δ 54.0, typical of a nitrogen bearing carbon. The downfield position of the C-3 carbon signal (δ 82.2) indicates that residue A is substituted at this position. Thus, A is the 3-linkedN -acetylglucosaminosyl residue. The carbon chemical shifts from C-1 to C-5 for residue A (Table IV) are also similar to those previously reported for a 3-linked α-N -acetylglucosaminosyl residue (34Bock K. Pedersen C. Pedersen H. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1984; 42: 193-225Crossref Scopus (522) Google Scholar). The anomeric signal for residue B is δ 5.17 (J H-1,H-2 not resolved), showing that it is α-linked. The proton chemical shifts (Table III) from H-1 to H-5 protons were assigned from COSY (spectrum not shown) and TOCSY (Fig.3 A ) spectra. A relatively smallJ H-3,H-4 coupling constant (<5 Hz) for residueB indicates that it has a galacto configuration. The carbon chemical shifts (Table IV) from C-1 to C-5 for residueB were assigned from HSQC spectrum. The C-2 chemical shift of residue B is δ 50.5, typical of a nitrogen bearing carbon. The downfield shift of C-3 (δ 76.6) and C-4 (δ 79.1) indicates that residue B is substituted at C-3 and C-4. Glycosyl linkage analysis (Table II) showed thatN -acetylgalactosamine is the only 3,4-linked aminoglycosyl residue found in the Cmf-CPS. Therefore, residue B is the 3,4-linked-α-N -acetylgalactosaminosyl residue. Residue C has an anomeric proton chemical shift at δ 5.00, (J H-1,H-2 not resolved) indicating that it is α-linked. The proton chemical shifts (Table III) from H-1 to H-5 for residue C were assigned from the COSY and TOCSY(Fig.3 A ) spectra. A small J H-2,H-3coupling constant (<5 Hz), indicates that the residue C has a manno configuration. The carbon chemical shifts (Table IV) from C-1 to C-5 were assigned from HSQC spectrum. The downfield chemical shift of C-3 (δ 76.5), indicates that residue Cis substituted at this position. Glycosyl linkage analysis (Table II) showed only one 3-linked mannuronosyl residue in the Cmf-CPS. Thus, residue C is the 3-linked mannuronosyl residue. The anomeric proton chemical shift for residue D is δ 4.79 (J H-1,H-2 7 Hz) indicating that it is β-linked. The proton chemical shifts (Table III) from H-1 to H-5 for residue D were assigned from the COSY and TOCSY (Fig.3 A ) spectra. The J H-3,H-4 coupling constant for residue D is similar to that for residueB (i.e ., < 5 Hz), indicating that it has agalacto configuration. The carbon chemical shifts (Table IV) from C-1 to C-5 carbon for residue D were determined from the HSQC spectrum. There is no downfield chemical shift for any carbon of residue D, indicating that it is not substituted. The only terminally linked hexosyl residue observed in the glycosyl linkage analysis of the Cmf-CPS (Table II) was galacturonic acid. Thus, residueD is the terminally linked β-galacturonosyl residue. The sequence of glycosyl residues was determined from a NOESY experiment (Fig. 3 B and TableV). In addition to intra-residue NOE contacts to H-2 and H-3, residue A has an NOE contact from H-1 to H-3 of residue C. Because residue C is 3-linked α-d-mannuronic acid, the sequence shown in Structure 1 was established.→3)­α­D­GlcpNAc­(1→3)­α­D­ManpA­(1→ A CSTRUCTURE 1Residue C has a strong NOE contact from H-1 to H-4 of residue B (in addition to intra-residue contacts to H-2 and H-4) indicating that residue C is linked to the 4-position of residue B.

Open table in a new tab Extracellular polysaccharides are central to bacterial survival, particularly against the immune defenses of the mammalian host. In uropathogenic P. mirabilis , the Cmf capsular polysaccharide has also been shown to facilitate the rapid multicellular migration of elongated hyperflagellated swarm cells, which correlates with the ability to establish experimental ascending colonization of the urinary tract and may be coupled to the formation of biofilms (7Fraser G.M. Furness R.B. Hughes C. Shimkets L. Brun Y. Prokaryotic Development. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.

The Cmf-CPS may provide a matrix for surface migration of the swarm cell rafts (35Stahl S.J. Stewart K.R. Williams F.D. J.

Hughes C. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1167-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 35Stahl S.J. Stewart K.R. Williams F.D. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 930-937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the acidic CPS is thought to act as lubricant, creating a fluid environment through whichProteus can swarm by extracting water from the agar medium beneath the colony (4Rauprich O. Matsushita M. Weijer C.J. Siegert F. Esipov S.E. Shapiro J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6525-6538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Gygi D. Rahman M.M. Lai H.-C. Carlson R. Guard-Petter J. Hughes C. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1167-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This latter hypothesis is supported by the observation that increased agar concentration or reduced polysaccharide biosynthesis, both of which result in a lowered agar/capsular polysaccharide osmotic activity ratio, reduce migration velocity but do not inhibit differentiation (4Rauprich O. Matsushita M. Weijer C.J. Siegert F. Esipov S.E. Shapiro J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6525-6538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Gygi D. Rahman M.M. Lai H.-C. Carlson R. Guard-Petter J. Hughes C. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1167-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Surface active agents are produced by other bacteria that undergo population migration cell rafts,e.g . the unrelated Myxococcus produces an extracellular slime during fruiting body development (36Dworkin M. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 70-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increasing the understanding of the apparently multiple roles ofProteus polysaccharides in colony expansion and virulence requires a knowledge of their structures. Including the Cmf-CPS structure of this report, three Proteus CPS structures have been described in the literature and are shown in Fig.4. Although these three structures are quite different from one another, they have two general similarities. First, all three structures are acidic in that they all contain at least one uronosyl residue; the CPS from P. mirabilis ATCC49565 has a branching terminally linked α-d-glucuronosyl residue, the P. vulgaris CPS contains a 4-linked α-d-glucuronosyl residue, and theP. mirabilis WT19 CPS contains 3-linked α-d-mannuronosyl and branching terminally linked β-d-galacturonsyl residues. Second, all three structures have amino sugars; P. mirabilis ATCC59565 CPS contains bothN -acetylglucosamine and N -acetylfucosamine,P. vulgaris CP2-96 CPS contains N-acetylgalactosamine, andP. mirabilis WT19 CPS contains bothN -acetylglucosamine and N -acetylgalactosamine. Understanding the molecular basis by which these acidic CPSs facilitateProteus swarming will require further investigation.

https://openalex.org/W2001126396,"It has been well established that the biogenesis of apoB is mediated co-translationally by the cytosolic proteasome. Here, however, we investigated the role of both the cytosolic proteasome as well as non-proteasome-mediated degradation systems in the post-translational degradation of apoB. In pulse-chase labeling experiments, co-translational (0-h chase) apoB degradation in both intact and permeabilized cells was sensitive to proteasome inhibitors. Interestingly, turnover of apoB in intact cells over a 2-h chase was partially inhibitable by lactacystin, thus suggesting a role for the cytosolic proteasome in the post-translational degradation of apoB. In permeabilized cells, however, there was no post-translational protection of apoB by lactacystin. Further investigations of proteasomal activity in HepG2 cells revealed that, following permeabilization, there was a dramatic loss of the 20 S proteasomal subunits, and consequently the cells exhibited no detectable lactacystin-inhibitable activity. Thus, apoB fragmentation and the generation of the 70-kDa apoB degradation fragment, characteristic of permeabilized cells, continued to occur in these cells despite the absence of functional cytosolic proteasome. Similar results were observed when we used a derivative of lactacystin, clastolactacystin β-lactone, which represents the active species of the inhibitor. Interestingly, however, the abundance of the 70-kDa fragment could be modulated by the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor, BMS-197636, as well as by pretreatment of the permeabilized cells with dithiothreitol. These data thus suggest that although the cytosolic proteasome appears to be involved in the post-translational turnover of apoB in intact cells, the specific post-translational fragmentation of apoB generating the 70-kDa fragment observed in permeabilized cells occurs independent of the cytosolic proteasome.

Clearly, the proteasome is involved in co-translational degradation of membrane-associated apoB, which is expected to have cytosolic exposure. However, recent evidence has suggested that the proteasome may also be involved in the post-translational degradation of apoB (19Mitchell D.M. Zhou M. Pariyarath R. Wang H. Aitchison J.D.

Post-translational degradation of apoB in HepG2 cells has generally been thought to occur in the ER or a closely associated compartment (5Davis R.A. Thrift R.N. Wu C.C. Howell K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10005-10011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Adeli K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9166-9175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Davis R. Prewett A. Thompson J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 22630-22638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although studies in rat hepatocytes have suggested that degradation of apoB may occur in post-ER compartments (25Wang C.-N. Hobman T.C. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24924-24931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 26Sparks J.D. Sparks C.E. Curr. Opion.

Chem. 1993; 268: 24990-24996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is speculated that a number of degradation systems may be involved in the intracellular turnover of apoB. Degradation of apoB appears to generate distinct proteolytic intermediates in both intact (9Bonnardel J.A. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28892-28896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 28Du E.Z. Kurth J. Wang S.L. Humiston P. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24169-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and permeabilized HepG2 cells (16Adeli K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9166-9175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In permeabilized cells, apoB degradation occurs by a temperature- and pH-dependent and ALLN-sensitive cysteine protease in an ER-related compartment (16Adeli K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9166-9175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in the generation of an abundant N-terminal 70-kDa fragment, which can be detected in the lumen of the secretory pathway (16Adeli K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9166-9175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Sallach S. Adeli K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1265: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 30Adeli K. Wettesten M. Asp L. Mohammadi A. Macri J. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5031-5039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, we have reported that the apoB associated with luminal lipoproteins is also degraded post-translationally by an ALLN-sensitive degradation mechanism and could be rescued from degradation by cytosolic factors and metabolic energy, perhaps by inducing transport of apoB out of the degradation compartment (30Adeli K. Wettesten M. Asp L. Mohammadi A. Macri J. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5031-5039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Wu et al. (14Wu X. Sakata N. Lele K.M. Zhou M. Jiang H. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11575-11580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) have reported a two-site model for the degradation of apoB in HepG2 cells, suggesting that after the initial rapid degradation process, apoB that is fully translocated into the ER lumen can still undergo degradation via a second proteolytic system that is ALLN-resistant but sensitive to DTT. In the present report, we used both intact and permeabilized HepG2 cell systems (16Adeli K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9166-9175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Sallach S. Adeli K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1265: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 30Adeli K. Wettesten M. Asp L. Mohammadi A. Macri J. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5031-5039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) to study the role of the cytosolic proteasome in post-translational apoB degradation. We report that post-translational degradation of apoB in intact cells is partially sensitive to proteasomal inhibitors, thus suggesting the involvement of the proteasome. Interestingly, however, we found that permeabilization of HepG2 cells results in the loss of proteasome function as determined by the loss of both lactacystin-inhibitable proteasome activity as well as proteasomal subunits. Permeabilized cells that are largely devoid of the cytosolic proteasome appear to continue to degrade apoB, generating specific fragments, including the 70-kDa fragment, via a lactacystin-insensitive process. Hence, the permeabilized cell model provides a system to study post-translational apoB fragmentation in the absence of the functional cytosolic proteasome. Moreover, the data from the permeabilized cell system suggests that post-translational turnover of luminal apoB may also involve nonproteasomal degradation systems. HepG2 cells (ATCC HB 8065) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Fetal bovine serum (certified grade) and cell culture media were from Life Technologies (Toronto). Digitonin of a higher purity (100%) was obtained from Calbiochem. Rabbit anti-rat 20 S proteasome antibody was a kind gift from Walter Ward (Texas), and the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) inhibitor BMS-197636 was provided by Dr. David Gordon (Bristol Meyers Squibb, Princeton, NJ). Lactacystin was purchased from Dr. E. J. Corey (Harvard University). Cultures of HepG2 were maintained in an α-modification of Eagle's minimal essential medium (α-MEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were grown in 35-, 60-, or 100-mm dishes at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in complete medium (α-MEM, 10% fetal bovine serum) (31Adeli K. Sinkevitch C. FEBS Lett. 1990; 2: 345-348Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cultures were allowed to reach 75–80% confluence before experiments were carried out. Nearly confluent HepG2 cultures were incubated with methionine/cysteine-free MEM for 120 min, pulse-labeled (15–120 min; see figure legends) with 100 μCi/ml35S protein labeling mix (Pro-MixTM), washed three times, and chased for various chase periods (10–120 min) in culture medium supplemented with 10 mm methionine and 2 mm cysteine. At the end of each chase period, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were harvested in a solubilization buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 kallikrein-inactivating units/ml Trasylol, 0.1 mmleupeptin, 0.5 μm ALLN). Cell extracts and media were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation. To examine apoB degradation in permeabilized cells, intact cells chased for 10 min were washed and incubated for 10 min at room temperature in cytoskeletal (CSK) buffer (0.3 m sucrose, 0.1 mKCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium-free EDTA, 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8) containing 50 μg/ml digitonin. Permeabilized cells were washed three times in CSK buffer and were then incubated in CSK buffer under various conditions as described in the figure legends. The cells were harvested in solubilization buffer, and the cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation. Nearly confluent HepG2 cells grown in six-well plates were incubated for 1 h in methionine/cysteine-free medium containing 0–50 nm MTP inhibitor (BMS-197636) and 20 μg/ml ALLN. Following the preincubation, cells were briefly pulsed with 35S protein labeling mix and chased for 10 min in α-MEM plus 10 mm l-methionine. Cells were washed three times in CSK buffer and permeabilized with digitonin (50 μg/ml, 10 min). At this point (0 time), control and treated cells were collected, and the remaining cells were incubated in CSK buffer supplemented with or without the MTP inhibitor. After the first hour of incubation, CSK buffer was removed, the cells were washed twice, and fresh CSK was added for the remaining 2 h. The cells were harvested in solubilization buffer, and the cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation. Cells were incubated in complete α-MEM in the presence and absence of 25 μm lactacystin for 1 h. Some cells were then washed in CSK and permeabilized as described above, and other cells were left intact. Both intact and permeabilized cells were collected in phosphate-buffered saline in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100 and homogenized in a Dounce glass homogenizer. Cell homogenates were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was subjected to protease assays. The protease assays were performed in 1.5-ml centrifuge tubes according to Twining (32Twining S.S. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 143: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) with modifications to assess proteasomal activity. To each reaction tube the following components were added: 20 μl of the respective sample, 25 μl of a 100 mm Tris, pH 7.8, buffer, 5 μl of 5 mg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled casein, and 5 μl of 250 μm lactacystin only to those samples already pretreated with lactacystin. The reaction was then carried out at 37 °C in the absence of light for 1 h in a shaking incubator. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 120 μl of 5% trichloroacetic acid followed by a 2-h incubation at room temperature in the absence of light to precipitate out all insoluble proteins. Samples were then centrifuged for 5 min, and 60 μl of the supernatants was added to 400 μl of 500 mm Tris, pH 8.8, buffer and mixed thoroughly. A 250-μl aliquot of each solution was added to microtiter plate wells and read in a fluorometer at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 538 nm. Cell samples from the proteasome assay described above were also subjected to chemiluminescent immunoblotting for the 20 S proteasome subunits. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE using a 10% polyacrylamide minigel (8 × 5 cm). Following SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred electrophoretically overnight at 4 °C onto nitrocellulose membranes using a Bio-Rad wet transfer system. The membranes were blocked with a 5% solution of fat-free dry milk powder and then incubated for 1 h in a 1:1000 dilution of the primary antibody, rabbit anti-rat 20 S proteasome, which also cross-reacts with the human proteasomal subunits. After several washes, the membranes were incubated for 1 h in a 1:8000 dilution of the secondary antibody conjugated to peroxidase solution. Membranes were then incubated in an ECL detection reagent for 60 s and exposed to Hyperfilm. Films were developed, and quantitative analysis was performed using an imaging densitometer. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (16Adeli K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9166-9175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were washed with wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100) and were prepared for SDS-PAGE by suspension and boiling in 100 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer. SDS-PAGE was performed essentially as described (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The gels were fixed, stained, and fluorographed by incubation in Amplify. The gels were dried and exposed to Dupont autoradiographic film at −80 °C for 1–4 days. In an attempt to distinguish the role of the proteasome in co- and post-translational degradation of apoB, intact HepG2 cells were first pretreated with the proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin, and then pulsed and chased over a 120-min period. Lactacystin pretreatment of cells 30 min before the pulse induced a significant increase in the amount of apoB accumulated at 0 h (2.6-fold increase over control), which remained high during the 120-min chase (Fig. 1 A ). To assess post-translational sensitivity to lactacystin, cells were chased for 60 and 120 min in the presence and absence of the inhibitor (Fig. 1 B ). In control cells, 53% of apoB was recovered after a 60-min chase, whereas in lactacystin-treated cells 78% was recovered. This difference was also observed after 120 min of chase time with only a 48% recovery of apoB in control cells as opposed to a 76% recovery in lactacystin-treated cells. Hence, even after a 2-h chase, degradation of apoB remained sensitive to lactacystin, thus suggesting a role for the proteasome after translation of apoB. Nevertheless, there was still an approximate 24% loss in35S-labeled apoB during the chase of lactacystin-treated cells, despite the presence of the inhibitor (Fig. 1 B ). We used a permeabilized cell system in conjunction with lactacystin to further examine the role of the proteasome in the specific fragmentation of apoB and the generation of the 70-kDa degradation fragment. Intact HepG2 cells were briefly pulsed and chased and then permeabilized with 50 μg/ml digitonin. Under these conditions, permeabilized cells do not possess protein synthesis activity nor secrete proteins, but they retain the capability to intracellularly degrade proteins including apoB. To monitor degradation of the newly synthesized radiolabeled apoB pool, permeabilized cells were incubated in CSK buffer with and without lactacystin for 120 min. The inhibitory function of lactacystin demonstrates a lag period (34Dick L.R. Cruikshank A.A. Destree A.T. Grenier L. McCormack T.A. Melandri F.D. Nunes S.L. Palombia V.J. Parent L.A. Plamondon L. Stein R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 182-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar); thus, the addition of this drug 30 min before the pulse was necessary to ensure that the inhibitor was present in its active form during the pulse. Fig. 2, A andB , shows that a significantly higher level of apoB was present in lactacystin-treated permeabilized cells at zero time, in comparison with cells not treated with lactacystin (3.4-fold increase over control). Over the 120-min chase following permeabilization, a major proportion of 35S-labeled apoB was degraded in both control and lactacystin-pretreated cells (Fig. 2 B ). Furthermore, in the presence of lactacystin, there was a dramatic accumulation of the major degradation intermediates of apoB, including the 70-kDa fragment (Fig. 2 A ). Enhanced generation of the fragment appeared to result from a greater pool of35S-labeled apoB100 at zero time in lactacystin-pretreated cells. We also examined the possibility that the digitonin treatment of the cells may have resulted in the leakage of apoB from the secretory pathway (ER-Golgi system) into the CSK buffer. After permeabilization, we collected both the cells and CSK buffer at 0 h (CSK plus digitonin) and at different periods of chase and probed for apoB. Two representative experiments are shown. The amount of intact apoB in permeabilized cells declined over the chase period, concomitant with an increase in the accumulation of the 70-kDa fragment in the cells (Fig.3). Little or no radiolabeled full-length apoB or the 70-kDa fragment could be detected in the CSK buffer at different chase times, and the amount detected was negligible compared with total immunoprecipitable apoB (Fig. 3). There was also no continued accumulation of the intact apoB or its 70-kDa fragment in the CSK buffer over time. Overall, the data suggest that there is minimal nonspecific loss of radiolabeled apoB following permeabilization of HepG2 cells and that temporal disappearance of intact apoB in permeabilized cells can be accounted for by intracellular degradation rather than cell leakage. In order to assess any effects permeabilization may have on the proteasomal activity of HepG2 cells, we measured protease activity of cell lysates prepared from intact and permeabilized HepG2 cells that were pretreated with and without lactacystin. In this particular assay, all detectable proteolytic activity was measured using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled casein as the proteolytic substrate. We initially examined the difference in total proteolytic activity between intact and permeabilized cells without lactacystin treatment and found that there was a decrease in the amount of proteolytic activity after permeabilization of the cells (0.23 ± 0.16 fluorescent units detected in permeabilized cells in comparison with 5.97 ± 1.2 fluorescent units detected in intact cells) (Fig.4 A ). In the presence of lactacystin, there was a considerable decrease in detectable proteolytic activity in intact cells (lactacystin-inhibitable activity, 2.84 ± 0.75 fluorescent units) (Fig. 4 B ). The loss in proteolytic activity was considered to be proteasomal in nature, since the difference between the two conditions was the presence of the proteasomal inhibitor, lactacystin. We then examined permeabilized cells and found no detectable lactacystin-inhibitable proteolytic activity (Fig. 4 B ). The absence of any appreciable lactacystin-inhibitable protease activity in permeabilized cells suggests significant loss of proteasomal activity in these cells. To assess whether the loss of proteasomal activity following permeabilization was due to the loss of proteasome subunits, we immunblotted intact and permeabilized cells for several of the subunits of the 20 S proteasome that have both structural and functional roles in the proteasome complex. Immunoblotting of intact HepG2 cell lysates with the polyclonal antibody revealed several of the 20 S subunits ranging in size from 25 to 35 kDa (Fig.5 A ). However, immunoblotting of permeabilized cell lysates revealed a dramatic reduction in the detection of the 20 S subunits (∼68% reduction compared with intact cells), thus indicating a significant loss of the cytosolic proteasome upon permeabilization (Fig. 5 B ). Furthermore, a significant amount of proteasomal subunits was detected in CSK plus digitonin buffer used in the permeabilization of the cells (∼49% detected in comparison with intact cells) (Fig. 5 B ). We compared the inhibitory effects of ALLN and lactacystin on post-translational degradation of apoB in permeabilized cells. In contrast to lactacystin, ALLN increased the amount of apoB remaining after a 2-h chase (Fig. 6 A ). The apoB remaining (as a percentage of total apoB at time 0) in lactacystin-treated and ALLN-treated permeabilized cells was 30.7 ± 5.2% and 75.1 ± 6.7%, respectively (p < 0.05, n = 3). Thus, unlike lactacystin, ALLN appeared to inhibit post-translational apoB degradation. In addition, ALLN also inhibited the post-translational apoB fragmentation, which generates the distinct apoB intermediates in permeabilized cells, including the 70-kDa fragment (Fig. 6 B ). We also tested the inhibitory effect of clastolactacystin β-lactone, the active species of the lactacystin inhibitor (34Dick L.R. Cruikshank A.A. Destree A.T. Grenier L. McCormack T.A. Melandri F.D.

Chem. 1997; 272: 182-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), to ensure that the insensitivity of apoB fragmentation to lactacystin was not a result of the inability of the inhibitor to convert to its active form in a permeabilized cell. The addition of clastolactacystin β-lactone either before or after permeabilization did not prevent the loss of apoB in permeabilized cells, nor did it interfere with the appearance of the 70-kDa fr"

The purified enzyme was very unstable but was stabilized by low concentrations of various detergents such as Tween 40. The enzyme was a monomeric protein with the native molecular weight of 41,000 ± 1,600. The enzyme showed a single absorption peak at 280 nm (E 1% = 10.0). PL and 2-nitrobenzaldehyde were excellent substrates, and no measurable activity was observed with short chain aliphatic aldehydes; substrate specificity of PL reductase was obviously different from those of yeast aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) so far purified. The peptide sequences of PL reductase were identical with those in a hypothetical 333-amino acid protein from S. pombe (the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM accession numberD89205). The gene corresponding to this protein was expressed inEscherichia coli, and the purified protein was found to have PL reductase activity. The recombinant PL reductase showed the same properties as those of native PL reductase. PL reductase showed only low sequence identities with members of AKR superfamily established to date; it shows the highest identity (18.5%) with humanShaker -related voltage-gated K+ channel β2 subunit. The elements of secondary structure of PL reductase, however, distributed similarly to those demonstrated in the three-dimensional structure of human aldose reductase except that loop A region is lost, and loop B region is extended. Amino acid residues involved in substrate binding or catalysis are also conserved. Conservation of these features, together with the major modifications, establish PL reductase as the first member of a new AKR family, AKR8.

The enzyme was for the first time found in a budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae , i.e. bakers' (1Morino Y. Sakamoto Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1960; 48: 733-744Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and brewers' (2Holzer H. Schneider S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1961; 48: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) yeasts. Guirard and Snell (3Guirard B.M. Snell E.E. Biofactors. 1988; 1: 187-192PubMed Google Scholar) have purified it to homogeneity from bakers' yeast and showed that the enzyme is a monomeric protein with the molecular weight of about 33,000. They designated the enzyme as PL reductase because of the equilibrium of the enzyme reaction lying so far to formation of PN, and the substrate specificity, molecular weight, and the monomeric structure of the enzyme. The enzyme resembled chlordecone reductase (4Molowa D.T. Shayne A.G. Guzelian P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12624-12627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in optimal pH, molecular weight, specific requirement of for NADPH, and behavior toward sulfhydryl reagents, barbital, and common ketone substrates.The chlordecone reductase from human liver belongs to family 1 of the AKR superfamily. 2A listing of current members of the AKR superfamily can be seen on the AKR WEB page.2A listing of current members of the AKR superfamily can be seen on the AKR WEB page. The AKRs form an expanding oxidoreductase superfamily classified into seven families containing a variety of monomeric oxidoreductases such as aldehyde and aldose reductases, hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, chalcone reductases, Shaker -related voltage-gated K+channel β2 subunits, and aflatoxin B1-aldehyde reductases (5Jez J.M. Flynn T.G. Penning T.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Because the nomenclature system is based on identities in amino acid sequence (5Jez J.M. Flynn T.G. Penning T.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), elucidation of primary structure of PL reductase is required to classify the enzyme in the family.We recently found that a fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, also contained PL reductase activity, suggesting that the enzyme also plays an important role in other eukaryotes. Here we show the purification and properties of PL reductase from S. pombe. Primary structure of the enzyme was determined based on cloning and expression of its gene in Escherichia coli . The results showed that the enzyme is the founding member of the 8th AKR family.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsNAD+, NADP+, NADH, NADPH, and a Cosmosil C18 column were purchased from Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan. PL, PN, and PLP were from Wako Chemicals, Osaka, Japan. Matrix Orange A was purchased from Grace Japan, Amicon, Tokyo, Japan. Butyl-Toyopearl and DEAE-Toyopearl were from Tosoh Corp., Tokyo, Japan. An Ultra-Free concentrator was from Milipore, Tokyo, Japan. A lysyl endopeptidase was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany. Primer DNAs for PCR were from Kurabo, Osaka, Japan. Restriction enzymes, E. coli JM109 competent cells, a Takara LA-PCR buffer II (Mg2+ plus), a Takara LA Taq polymerase, and a SUPREC-01 tube were from Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan. A Ligation High was from Toyobo, Osaka, Japan. A plasmid pTrc99A was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden. A plasmid SY1115 carrying the PL reductase gene of S. pombe was a kind gift from Dr. Yoshioka of the ex-Okayama project, Japan. All other chemicals were of analytical grade.Microorganism and the Culture ConditionsS. pombe IFO 0346 cells were grown at 30 °C for 72 h with shaking in a synthetic medium containing 1%d-glucose, 100 mm PN, and yeast nitrogen base, containing neither amino acids nor thiamine. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, washed twice with 0.9% NaCl, and then stored at −20 °C.Enzyme AssaysPL reductase was assayed by measuring the initial decrease inA 366 of NADPH at 37 °C in 1.0 ml of the reaction mixture. Each reaction mixture contained 0.2 mmPL, 0.2 mm NADPH, 0.1 m MOPS/KOH buffer (pH 7.5), and the enzyme. The reaction was started by addition of PL. One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to reduce 1 μmol of PL per min.Enzyme PurificationAll the steps were performed at 4–10 °C.Step 1Frozen cells (195 g, wet weight) were thawed and suspended in 390 ml of Buffer C, 100 mm sodium citrate (pH 6.5) containing stabilizing reagents (1 mm PMSF, 0.01% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm PL). The suspension (100 ml, each) was vigorously vortexed for 1 min and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to separate the supernatant solution. The precipitated cells were resuspended in 390 ml of Buffer C, vortexed, and centrifuged. The step was repeated again. The combined supernatant solutions (1165 ml) were used as a crude extract.Step 2NaCl (final 2 m) was added to the crude extract, and the solution was applied to a butyl-Toyopearl column (1.8 × 18 cm) equilibrated with Buffer T (10 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 6.0, containing the stabilizing reagents and 2m NaCl). The column was washed with Buffer T; the enzyme activity was eluted as a broad single peak from about 700 to 1770 ml of eluate. The active fractions (1070 ml) were combined and concentrated to 65 ml with butyl-Toyopearl by an adsorption-desorption cycle. Tween 40 (0.005%) was immediately added to the concentrated solution to stabilize the enzyme.Step 3The concentrated enzyme solution was dialyzed at 4 °C overnight against 2 liters of Buffer M (10 mmMOPS/KOH buffer, pH 7.5, containing the stabilizing reagents, 0.005% Tween 40, and 0.1 m NaCl). The dialyzed solution was applied to an Orange A column (0.9 × 3.2 cm) equilibrated with Buffer M. After the column was washed with 150 ml of Buffer M, the enzyme was eluted with Buffer M containing 1 mm NADPH.Step 4The active fractions obtained by Orange A column chromatography (8.5 ml) were dialyzed at 4 °C overnight against 1 liter of Buffer A (10 mm MOPS/KOH buffer, pH 7.5, containing the stabilizing reagents and 0.005% Tween 40). The dialyzed solution was applied to a DEAE-Toyopearl column (1.0 × 40 cm). The enzyme was eluted with Buffer A. The active fractions (53.6 ml) were concentrated to 2.1 ml with an Ultra-Free concentrator. The concentrated solution was used as the purified enzyme.Molecular Weight DeterminationThe purity of the enzyme and the subunit molecular weight were estimated by SDS-PAGE by the method of Laemmli (6Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar). The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated by gel filtration at 4 °C, using an Ultrogel AcA 34 column (1.2 × 110 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm MOPS/NaOH buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 0.02% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% Tween 40, and 0.1 m NaCl at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. A calibration curve was made from the elution pattern of bovine liver catalase (M r = 240,000), pig heart mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (90,000), malate dehydrogenase (67,000), and horse heart cytochrome c (12,400). The protein concentration was determined by means of a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard.Substrate Specificity of PL ReductaseK m and V max values were determined by measuring initial reaction velocities with concentrations of substrate between 0.1× K m and 10× K m, whereas NADPH concentration was held at 0.2 mm. Kinetic parameters were determined by employing the curve-fitting software (KaleidaGraph) to fit the Michaelis-Menten equation using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.Amino Acid SequencingThe enzyme (1.95 nmol) was digested at 37 °C for 6 h with a lysyl endopeptidase (23 pmol). The digested peptides were isolated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a Cosmosil C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm) with a linear gradient from 0 to 90% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in a Shimadzu LC-10A system. The amino acid sequences were determined by an automated Edman degradation with an Applied Biosystems 492 protein sequencer.Construction of Plasmids Carrying PL Reductase GeneThe 1.2-kbp fragment carrying the PL reductase gene (plr +) was cut out from a plasmid SY1115 with both Eco RI and Kpn I, collected using a SUPREC-01 tube, and then ligated into the Eco RI-Kpn I site of pTrc99A. The recombinant plasmid was designated as pPLR1. The PL reductase-coding sequence in pPLR1 was amplified by PCR using the two oligonucleotides 5′-GCGAAGCTTGGTACCAGGAGGAGTGAAAAGATGCCTATCGTTAGCGGATTTAA-3′ (primer NF, sense) and 5′-GCGGGATCCTTAAACGGAAAGAGTGCCCGCAAGCTGTTCATT-3′ (primer CR, antisense) to introduce Bam HI (underlined in primer NF), ribosome-binding (boldface types in primer NF), andHin dIII sites (underlined in primer CR). The reaction mixture (50 μl) of PCR consisted of Takara LA-PCR buffer II (Mg2+ plus), 20 nmol of each dNTP, 2.5 units of Takara LATaq polymerase, 0.5 mg of a plasmid pPLR1 (as a template), and 100 pmol of each primer. The mixture was heated at 98 °C for 20 s and then incubated at 68 °C for 20 min. The programmed temperature shift was repeated 16 times, and then, without delay, “autosegment extension” program was done as follows: heating at 98 °C for 20 s and incubation at 68 °C for 20 min +t s, where t denotes the segment extension time that increases by 15 s at each cycle; the temperature shift was repeated 14 times. Finally, the mixture was held at 72 °C for 10 min. The amplified DNA fragments (about 1.0 kbp) were digested byBam HI and Hin dIII and then ligated into theBam HI-Hin dIII site of pTrc99A. The constructed plasmid was designated as pPLR2. A plasmid pPLR3 carrying a modifiedplr , in which a possible internal palindrome structure inplr + was disrupted by substitutions of certain nucleotides without changing the amino acid sequence of PL reductase, was prepared as follows. The 669-bp fragment ofplr +, encoding the amino-terminal 223 amino acids of PL reductase, was amplified by PCR using the two oligonucleotides as the primers: primer NF (sense) and 5′-GCGGAATTCTTTAAGGTCTTCGACAGTCTTAATGCGACC-3′ (primer MR, antisense) to introduce Bam HI and ribosome-binding sites andEco RI site (underlined in primer MR). PCR was performed as described above. The 333-bp fragment of plr +, encoding the carboxyl-terminal 110 amino acids of PL reductase and containing the stop codon, was amplified by PCR using two primer oligonucleotides: 5′-GCGGAATTCGCAAAGTCATTTCCGTTTCTGGAATATTTGGACAGATTTAGCCCTGATGTT-3′ (primer MF, sense), in which substituted nucleotides are shown as boldface and Eco RI site to be introduced is underlined, and the primer CR. PCR was performed under the same conditions. Both the amplified DNA fragments were digested by Eco RI and then ligated. The ligated fragment (about 1.0 kbp) was collected using a SUPREC-01 tube, digested by Bam HI and Hin dIII, and then ligated into the Bam HI-Hin dIII site of pTrc99A to obtain pPLR3. The nucleotide sequences of these genes were verified using an Applied Biosystems 373A DNA sequencer with a PRISM kit (Perkin-Elmer).The plasmids pPLR1, pPLR2, or pPLR3 were introduced into TakaraE. coli JM109-competent cells. The clone cells were used for analysis of the enzyme production in E. coli .Purification of Recombinant PL ReductaseCells of E. coli JM109 clone harboring pPLR3 were grown in 5 liters of LB medium (7Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm) at 37 °C for 16 h. The cells (wet weight, 18.9 g) were harvested and disrupted by sonication to prepare crude extracts. PL reductase (5.3 mg of total protein; 116.0 units of total activity) was purified from the crude extracts (2,100 mg of total protein; 1,281.6 units of total activity) by the same purification procedure as that used for purification of the enzyme from S. pombe .Homology Search of PL Reductase with Other ProteinsDNA and protein data bases in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM were searched for proteins homologous with PL reductase by use of the BLAST algorithm (8Altschul S.F.

Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69141) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThe complete amino acid sequences of three kinds of yeast AKRs have been reported so far: xylose reductases (aldose reductases) from xylose-assimilating yeasts (15Amore R. Koetter P. Kuester C. Cirlacy M. Hollenberg C.P. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 109: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 16Bolen P.L. Hayman G.T. Shepherd H.S. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1367-1375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), aldehyde reductase fromSporobolomyces salmonicolor (17Kita K. Matsuzaki K. Hashimoto T. Yanase H. Kato N. Chung M.C.-M. Kataoka M. Shimizu S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 54: 1770-1775Google Scholar), and an enzyme fromS. cerevisiae which shows high reactivity toward α- and β-keto esters (18Nakamura K. Kawai Y. Nakajima N. Ohno A. J. Org. Chem. 1991; 56: 4778-4783Crossref Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 19Nakamura K. Kondo S. Kawai Y. Nakajima N. Ohno A. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1997; 61: 375-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). An amino-terminal sequence of AKR fromS. cerevisiae has been reported (20Kuhn A. Van Zyl C. Van Tonder A. Prior B.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 1580-1585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PL reductase showed less than 10% identity with these yeast AKRs and differs substantially from them in substrate specificity. For example, PL reductase did not reduce aldoses such as xylose, and in contrast to AKRs from S. salmonicolor and S. cerevisiae , which show high activity toward 4-nitrobenzaldehyde (17Kita K. Matsuzaki K. Hashimoto T. Yanase H. Kato N. Chung M.C.-M. Kataoka M. Shimizu S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 54: 1770-1775Google Scholar, 19Nakamura K. Kondo S. Kawai Y. Nakajima N. Ohno A. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1997; 61: 375-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 20Kuhn A. Van Zyl C. Van Tonder A. Prior B.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 1580-1585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), PL reductase showed the highest reactivity toward 2-nitrobenzaldehyde. Thus, the previously studied yeast AKRs may show little if any activity toward PL although their activity toward PL has not been reported. It will be interesting to determine whether PL reductase distributes among yeasts as aldose reductase.The predicted secondary structure of PL reductase suggested that the enzyme adopts a hold similar to that of human aldose reductase, whose structure is known (10Wilson D.K. Bohren K.M. Gabby K.H. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 11Wilson D.K. Tarle I. Petrash J.M. Quiocho F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9847-9851Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The alignment showed that important catalytic, NADPH-binding residues were aligned with putative equivalent residues in AKRs. Asp-47, Tyr-53, and Lys-83 may be the active site residues, making spatially conserved arrangement as seen in human aldose reductase. Ala-123 in PL reductase corresponds to His-117 in human aldose reductase but cannot fill the role of proton donor suggested (10Wilson D.K. Bohren K.M. Gabby K.H. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 11Wilson D.K. Tarle I. Petrash J.M. Quiocho F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9847-9851Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) for His-117 in human aldose reductase. An alternative candidate for this role, Tyr-53, may be involved in the catalytic action of PL reductase. It has been noted that His-117 in human aldose reductase is also less likely to function as the proton donor at physiological pH (21Jez J.M. Bennett M.J. Schlegel B.P. Lewis M. Penning T.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar).Jez et al. (5Jez J.M. Flynn T.G. Penning T.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) have proposed a system for nomenclature of the AKR superfamily based on amino acid sequence identities. They distinguish seven families based on amino acid identities of 40% or more. Since PL reductase shows less than 20% identity with these other AKR proteins, we suggest that it represents a new AKR family, 3T. M. Penning, personal communication. AKR8. Among several other proteins with a similar amino acid sequence but unknown function, we have cloned and expressed the iolS gene of B. subtilis in E. coli and found that the IolS protein indeed shows PL reductase activity but not aldose reductase activity. 4M.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4591-4598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), there may be some relation between vitamin B6 and myo -inositol metabolism.Although PL reductase from S. pombe showed properties similar to those of the enzyme from S. cerevisiae (3Guirard B.M. Snell E.E. Biofactors. 1988; 1: 187-192PubMed Google Scholar), the former enzyme did not catalyze reduction of PLP, an important fact in ascribing a possible function to the enzyme. PLP, a coenzyme form of vitamin B6, is mainly synthesized from PN through pyridoxine 5′-phosphate in cells (22Snell E.E. Haskell B.E. Florkin M. Sfotz E.H. Comprehensive Biochemistry. 21. Elsevier, Amsterdam1971: 47-71Google Scholar). If PL reductase catalyzes reduction of PLP, the enzyme by itself without cooperation with a phosphatase may control the synthesis of PLP by reversing the synthetic pathway. However, this may be not the case. As Guirard and Snell (3Guirard B.M. Snell E.E. Biofactors. 1988; 1: 187-192PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested, PL reductase may be involved in salvage of vitamin B6 and excretion of PN from yeast cells by reduction of PL to PN. Actually, we have found that S. pombe excretes fairly high amounts of PN into cultivation medium during its cultivation (23Yagi T. Tanouchi A. Hiraoka Y. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 161: 150-1450Crossref Google Scholar). The results that PL reductase leaked easily from the frozen cells and was stabilized by detergents having hydrophobic side chains and localized in a cellular compartment different from that occupied by lactate dehydrogenase suggest that PL reductase may be an extrinsic protein which is weakly bound to the membrane lipids inside the cell wall. This also supports the possibility that PL reductase play an important role in the excretion of PN from the yeast cell. We are examining the localization of PL reductase. Pyridoxal reductase (PL1reductase) (formerly designated as PN dehydrogenase) catalyzes reduction of PL with NADPH and oxidation of PN with NADP+as the reverse reaction. The enzyme was for the first time found in a budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae , i.e. bakers' (1Morino Y. Sakamoto Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1960; 48: 733-744Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and brewers' (2Holzer H. Schneider S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1961; 48: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) yeasts. Guirard and Snell (3Guirard B.M. Snell E.E. Biofactors. 1988; 1: 187-192PubMed Google Scholar) have purified it to homogeneity from bakers' yeast and showed that the enzyme is a monomeric protein with the molecular weight of about 33,000. They designated the enzyme as PL reductase because of the equilibrium of the enzyme reaction lying so far to formation of PN, and the substrate specificity, molecular weight, and the monomeric structure of the enzyme. The enzyme resembled chlordecone reductase (4Molowa D.T. Shayne A.G. Guzelian P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12624-12627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in optimal pH, molecular weight, specific requirement of for NADPH, and behavior toward sulfhydryl reagents, barbital, and common ketone substrates. The chlordecone reductase from human liver belongs to family 1 of the AKR superfamily. 2A listing of current members of the AKR superfamily can be seen on the AKR WEB page.2A listing of current members of the AKR superfamily can be seen on the AKR WEB page. The AKRs form an expanding oxidoreductase superfamily classified into seven families containing a variety of monomeric oxidoreductases such as aldehyde and aldose reductases, hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, chalcone reductases, Shaker -related voltage-gated K+channel β2 subunits, and aflatoxin B1-aldehyde reductases (5Jez J.M. Flynn T.G. Penning T.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Because the nomenclature system is based on identities in amino acid sequence (5Jez J.M. Flynn T.G. Penning T.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), elucidation of primary structure of PL reductase is required to classify the enzyme in the family. We recently found that a fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, also contained PL reductase activity, suggesting that the enzyme also plays an important role in other eukaryotes. Here we show the purification and properties of PL reductase from S. pombe. Primary structure of the enzyme was determined based on cloning and expression of its gene in Escherichia coli . The results showed that the enzyme is the founding member of the 8th AKR family.

Restriction enzymes, E. coli JM109 competent cells, a Takara LA-PCR buffer II (Mg2+ plus), a Takara LA Taq polymerase, and a SUPREC-01 tube were from Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan. A Ligation High was from Toyobo, Osaka, Japan. A plasmid pTrc99A was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden. A plasmid SY1115 carrying the PL reductase gene of S. pombe was a kind gift from Dr. Yoshioka of the ex-Okayama project, Japan. All other chemicals were of analytical grade.Microorganism and the Culture ConditionsS. pombe IFO 0346 cells were grown at 30 °C for 72 h with shaking in a synthetic medium containing 1%d-glucose, 100 mm PN, and yeast nitrogen base, containing neither amino acids nor thiamine. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, washed twice with 0.9% NaCl, and then stored at −20 °C.Enzyme AssaysPL reductase was assayed by measuring the initial decrease inA 366 of NADPH at 37 °C in 1.0 ml of the reaction mixture. Each reaction mixture contained 0.2 mmPL, 0.2 mm NADPH, 0.1 m MOPS/KOH buffer (pH 7.5), and the enzyme. The reaction was started by addition of PL. One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to reduce 1 μmol of PL per min.Enzyme PurificationAll the steps were performed at 4–10 °C.Step 1Frozen cells (195 g, wet weight) were thawed and suspended in 390 ml of Buffer C, 100 mm sodium citrate (pH 6.5) containing stabilizing reagents (1 mm PMSF, 0.01% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm PL). The suspension (100 ml, each) was vigorously vortexed for 1 min and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to separate the supernatant solution. The precipitated cells were resuspended in 390 ml of Buffer C, vortexed, and centrifuged. The step was repeated again. The combined supernatant solutions (1165 ml) were used as a crude extract.Step 2NaCl (final 2 m) was added to the crude extract, and the solution was applied to a butyl-Toyopearl column (1.8 × 18 cm) equilibrated with Buffer T (10 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 6.0, containing the stabilizing reagents and 2m NaCl). The column was washed with Buffer T; the enzyme activity was eluted as a broad single peak from about 700 to 1770 ml of eluate. The active fractions (1070 ml) were combined and concentrated to 65 ml with butyl-Toyopearl by an adsorption-desorption cycle. Tween 40 (0.005%) was immediately added to the concentrated solution to stabilize the enzyme.Step 3The concentrated enzyme solution was dialyzed at 4 °C overnight against 2 liters of Buffer M (10 mmMOPS/KOH buffer, pH 7.5, containing the stabilizing reagents, 0.005% Tween 40, and 0.1 m NaCl). The dialyzed solution was applied to an Orange A column (0.9 × 3.2 cm) equilibrated with Buffer M. After the column was washed with 150 ml of Buffer M, the enzyme was eluted with Buffer M containing 1 mm NADPH.Step 4The active fractions obtained by Orange A column chromatography (8.5 ml) were dialyzed at 4 °C overnight against 1 liter of Buffer A (10 mm MOPS/KOH buffer, pH 7.5, containing the stabilizing reagents and 0.005% Tween 40). The dialyzed solution was applied to a DEAE-Toyopearl column (1.0 × 40 cm). The enzyme was eluted with Buffer A. The active fractions (53.6 ml) were concentrated to 2.1 ml with an Ultra-Free concentrator. The concentrated solution was used as the purified enzyme.Molecular Weight DeterminationThe purity of the enzyme and the subunit molecular weight were estimated by SDS-PAGE by the method of Laemmli (6Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar). The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated by gel filtration at 4 °C, using an Ultrogel AcA 34 column (1.2 × 110 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm MOPS/NaOH buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 0.02% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% Tween 40, and 0.1 m NaCl at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. A calibration curve was made from the elution pattern of bovine liver catalase (M r = 240,000), pig heart mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (90,000), malate dehydrogenase (67,000), and horse heart cytochro"

To uncover the metabolic pathway that is disrupted by the fld mutation, we analyzed the altered pattern of gene expression in the fatty liver of fld neonates by representational difference analysis of cDNA. Differentially expressed genes detected include a novel member of the Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins, a novel Ser/Thr kinase, and several actin cytoskeleton-associated proteins including actin, profilin, α-actinin, and myosin light chain. Because these proteins have a potential functional link in the propagation of hormone signals, we investigated cytoskeleton dynamics in fld cells in response to hormone treatment. These studies revealed that preadipocytes from fld mice exhibit impaired formation of actin membrane ruffles in response to insulin treatment. These findings suggest that the altered mRNA expression levels detected infld tissue represent a compensatory response for the nonfunctional fld gene and that the fld gene product may be required for development of normal insulin response.

Birkenmeier E.H. Ben-Zeev O. Schotz M.C. Sweet H.O. Davisson M.T. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7994-8003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fatty liver develops as the newborn mice begin to suckle milk and is accompanied by elevated plasma triglyceride levels (1000 mg/dl). However, the fatty liver and hypertriglyceridemia resolve spontaneously when mice reach 2–3 weeks of age, at which time the mutant animals begin to develop a peripheral neuropathy that persists throughout their lifetime. The neuropathy is associated with abnormal myelin formation and axonal degeneration in the peripheral nerve (2Langner C.A. Birkenmeier E.H. Roth K.A. Bronson R.T. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11955-11964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fld gene has been mapped to mouse chromosome (Chr) 12 (3Rowe L.B. Sweet H.O. Gordon J.I. Birkenmeier E.H. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 555-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), but neither the mutant gene nor the biochemical basis for the lipid and nerve defects have been identified (reviewed in Ref. 4Reue K. Doolittle M.H. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1387-1405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies of the fld fatty liver have revealed altered mRNA levels for proteins involved in lipid metabolism, including hepatic lipase (60% reduction), apolipoprotein A-IV (100-fold induction), and apolipoprotein C-II (6-fold induction) (1Langner C.A. Birkenmeier E.H. Ben-Zeev O. Schotz M.C. Sweet H.O. Davisson M.T. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7994-8003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using quantitative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we have detected approximately 25 additional proteins that show significantly altered levels in the fatty liver of neonatal fld mice; the majority of these proteins could not be identified on the basis of current two-dimensional protein data base information (5Rehnmark S. Giometti C.S. Slavin B.G. Doolittle M.H. Reue K. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2209-2217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The goal of the present study was to identify genes with altered expression levels in the fatty liver of fld mice, with the intent of uncovering a specific metabolic pathway affected by the mutation. Toward this end, we have employed representational difference analysis (RDA) to isolate cDNA tags corresponding to mRNAs with altered expression in the fld fatty liver. The RDA technique was originally developed and applied to isolate differences between complex genomes, such as genetic lesions in tumors that result from DNA deletion, insertion, or rearrangement (6Lisitsyn N.A. Lisitsyn N.M. Wigler M.H. Science. 1993; 259: 946-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar, 7Lisitsyn N.A. Lisitsina N.M. Dalbagni G. Barker P. Sanchez C.A. Gnarra J. Linehan W.M. Reid B.J. Wigler M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Subsequently, RDA has been adapted for use at the cDNA level and employed to isolate sequence tags corresponding to mRNA species that are differentially expressed between two cell populations (8Braun B.S. Frieden R. Lessnick S.L. May W.A. Denny C.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 4623-4630Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 9Chu C.C. Paul W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2507-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 10Edman C.F. Prigent S.A. Schipper A. Feramisco J.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 11Hubank M. Schatz D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5640-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). In cDNA-RDA, representations generated by PCR from two cDNA populations of interest are compared in successive rounds of subtraction-hybridization, kinetic enrichment, and selective amplification, resulting in sequences corresponding to mRNA species that are expressed at different levels in the two populations. Using RDA we have isolated 22 mRNA species with altered expression levels in the fatty liver of fld neonates compared with their wild type counterparts. These RDA sequences include several that encode proteins associated with the actin cytoskeleton, a putative novel Ser/Thr protein kinase, and a putative novel member of the Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins. Because members of the Ras and kinase protein families are functionally linked to components of the actin cytoskeleton in the process of hormone signal propagation, we investigated whether hormone-induced changes in the cytoskeleton were impaired in fld cells. Indeed, it was found that preadipocytes isolated from fld mice fail to form actin membrane ruffles in response to insulin. These results establish thatfld mouse tissues exhibit altered expression levels of cytoskeleton-associated and putative signal transduction proteins, which is associated with impaired cytoskeleton response to hormones such as insulin. Nontested breeding pairs of the mouse strain BALB/cByJ-fld were obtained from the Mouse Mutant Resource Colony at the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and bred to producefld/fld offspring used in these studies. Thefld/fld pups were recognized at 3–5 days of age by their smaller body size, swollen abdomen, pale liver, and delayed onset of fur growth. Adult fld/fld mice were recognized by the characteristic whole body tremor and clenching of hind legs when handled. Throughout the text, the term “fld ” is used to indicate mice of the fld/fld genotype, and “wild type” is used to indicate mice of genotypes +/+ and+/fld , which both appear phenotypically normal. Representational difference analysis was performed as described below, based on the protocol by Hubank and Schatz (11Hubank M. Schatz D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5640-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). RNA was prepared from liver of wild type and fld littermates at 6 days of age by the acid phenol-guanidine method (Trizol; Life Technologies, Inc.). Total RNA (400–500 μg) obtained from two isogenic littermates was combined for poly(A)+ RNA isolation (Poly(A)-Tract IV, Promega, Madison, WI), and 5 μg of the resulting poly(A)+ RNA was used for cDNA synthesis (Superscript Choice System, Life Technologies, Inc.). 1 μg of cDNA was digested with Dpn II (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), extracted with phenol-chloroform, and precipitated in ethanol. cDNA fragments were ligated to R-Bgl24 oligomers in the presence of R-Bgl12 oligomers (Operon Technologies, Alameda, CA; see Ref. 11Hubank M. Schatz D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5640-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar for sequences of oligonucleotides used in RDA). Ligated cDNA fragments were diluted and amplified for 19 cycles with R-Bgl24 as a primer. The resulting amplicon preparation was extracted with phenol-chloroform, and R-Bgl24 adaptors were removed byDpn II digestion. All manipulations were performed in parallel for wild type and fld samples. Amplicons prepared from wild type andfld RNA were each used as tester in independent reactions. For tester preparation, 10–20 μg of amplicon was subjected to gel electrophoresis in 1.2% low melting agarose. The size range of 100–1500 base pairs was excised and gel purified using Qiaex II resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). 1 μg of gel purified tester was ligated to the new oligomer, J-Bgl24. To permit precise adjustment of driver/tester ratios in subtractive hybridization steps, DNA concentrations were measured fluorometrically using Hoechst dye and calf thymus DNA as a standard (12Labarca C. Paigen K. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4553) Google Scholar). The accuracy of DNA quantitation was verified on agarose gels. In the first round of subtractive hybridization, 40 μg of driver and 0.4 μg of tester were mixed, extracted with phenol-chloroform, and precipitated with ethanol. The resulting pellet was washed twice in 70% ethanol, dried, and thoroughly dissolved in 4 μl of hybridization buffer (30 mm EPPS, pH 8.0, 3 mm Na2EDTA). The DNA droplet was overlaid with mineral oil and denatured at 98 °C for 5 min in a PCR machine. The reaction tube was immediately transferred to a 67 °C water bath, and 1 μl 5 m NaCl was added. The tester-driver mixture was incubated at 67 °C for 20 h. After hybridization for 20 h, the hybridization mixture was diluted step-wise in TE (10 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) in the presence of 40 μg of yeast tRNA to a final volume of 400 μl. The diluted hybridization mix was subjected to 10 cycles of PCR amplification using J-Bgl24 as a primer. The resulting PCR product was extracted with phenol-choroform, precipitated with ethanol in the presence of glycogen, and treated with Mung Bean nuclease (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) for 30 min at 30 °C to remove single-stranded DNA, which consisted primarily of unhybridized driver sequences. The Mung Bean nuclease reaction mixture was denatured at 95 °C for 8 min and chilled on ice. The first difference product was generated from the denatured Mung Bean nuclease mixture by 19 cycles of PCR amplification using J-Bgl24 as a primer. In total, three or four rounds of subtractive hybridization and selective amplification of tester-tester hybrids were performed. In each new round of subtraction the difference product of the previous subtraction was used as the tester in combination with a fresh aliquot of the initial amplicon from the opposite source as driver (40 μg). Two RDA experiments were performed with different tester/driver ratios: in one experiment, tester/driver ratios were 1:100, 1:400, 1:80,000, and 1:800,000 for rounds 1–4 (11Hubank M. Schatz D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5640-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar); the second experiment used a constant ratio of 1:100 for a total of three rounds. Difference products resulting from the final round of subtraction from each experiment were cloned into pBlueScript SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Northern blot analysis was performed using 10 μg of total RNA from liver of 6-day-old and 3-month-old wild type and fld mice as described (13Cohen R.D. Castellani L.W. Qiao J.-H. Van Lenten B.J. Lusis A.J. Reue K. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1906-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). RDA plasmid inserts were sequenced by the dideoxy method, and sequences were compared with those in nucleotide data bases using the BLAST algorithm (14Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71432) Google Scholar). Total RNA from liver, adipose, and sciatic nerve was treated with DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX) at 37 °C for 30 min to remove any potential contaminating genomic DNA. cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of DNase-treated RNA using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) primer (cDNA Cycle Kit, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). PCR amplification was performed using one-tenth of the resulting cDNA in a total volume of 50 μl containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.001% gelatin, 200 μmdNTPs, 0.01 μg/μl forward and reverse primers, and 1 unit of AmpliTaq (Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, CA). PCR cycling conditions consisted of a hot start “touchdown” protocol in which the annealing temperature was gradually decreased over a 10 °C range (from 63 to 53 °C) to reduce nonspecific priming (15Don R.H. Cox P.T. Wainwright B.J. Baker K. Mattick J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 194008Crossref PubMed Scopus (2250) Google Scholar), and products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The initial reaction conditions were denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 63 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. The annealing temperature was decreased 0.5 °C at each cycle for 20 cycles and maintained at 53 °C for an additional 12 cycles. Products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The gene specific primers employed were as follows: Ifld-1, forward, 5′-TCGGGGAACCACTTGATG-3′, and reverse, 5′-ACTACGCCCCGACGGTGTTTGA-3′; Ifld-2, forward, 5′-ATGACGCGCTGCGGGACAAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CTGCCAGCCAGCATGGTGAAGAG-3′; HPRT, forward, 5′-CACAGGACTAGAACACCTGC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GCTGGTGAAAAGGACCTCT-3′; and PMP-22, forward, 5′-ACACTGCTACTCCTCATCAGTGAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CAGGATCACATAGATGATACCACTG-3′. Selected RDA sequences were mapped in the mouse genome using a [(C57BL/6J × Mus spretus )F1 × C57BL/6J] interspecific backcross (16Welch C.L. Xia Y.-R. Schecter I. Farese R. Mehrabian M. Mehdizadeh S. Warden C.H. Lusis A.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1406-1421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated inserts were prepared from RDA plasmids, radiolabeled, and hybridized to restriction-digested genomic DNA from C57BL/6J and M. spretus mice to identify restriction fragment length variants. Distinct variants were then scored in 67 backcross mice that had been typed for more than 350 genetic markers. Linkage was detected with Map Manager version 2.6.5 (17Manly K.F. Mamm. Genome. 1993; 4: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Preadipocytes were released from inguinal fat pads of 4-week-old wild type and fld mice by collagenase digestion followed by filtration through 62-μm nylon mesh (18Briquet-Laugier V. Dugail I. Ardouin B. Le Liepvre X. Lavau M. Quignard-Boulange A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: E439-E446PubMed Google Scholar). Preadipocytes were recovered by centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min at room temperature and plated onto sterile coverslips at a density of 4 × 104 cells/coverslip in 6-well culture dishes and maintained for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 15 nm insulin. After 24 h, cells were approximately 50% confluent. For hormone stimulation studies, cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium devoid of serum and insulin for 18 h to bring them to a quiescent state. Cells were subsequently treated for 10 min at 37 °C with phosphate-buffered saline alone, with 1% fetal calf serum, or with 40 ng/ml insulin and then fixed and stained with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-phalloidin (Sigma) as described (19Ridley A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Stained cells were observed with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope at an excitation wavelength of 540 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm. RDA was performed using RNA from the liver offld and wild type littermates at 6 days of age, at which time the fld mice exhibit an enlarged fatty liver. Both possible tester-driver combinations were employed to allow isolation of sequences expressed at higher abundance in fld compared with wild type (“F clones”), as well as those expressed at higher abundance in wild type compared with fld (“W clones”). Following three or four rounds of RDA, the resulting difference products were cloned into plasmids, and approximately 150 of these were characterized by sequencing. Based on DNA sequence, clones were segregated into 22 groups, and a representative of each group was used to probe Northern blots to confirm differential expression in liver offld and wild type mice. As shown in Fig. 1 and TableI, these RDA clones correspond to mRNA species expressed at low, moderate, and high abundance and include examples that exhibit diminished (i.e. insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 4, Igfbp4 ), moderately increased (i.e. profilin), or vastly increased levels in thefld fatty liver (i.e. novel sequencesIfld1 , Ifld2 , and Ifld3 ). Some of the RDA sequences are expressed only at ages during which the fatty liver phenotype is apparent (i.e. Ifld1 , Ifld2 , and Ifld3 ), whereas others are also expressed in adult mouse liver (i.e. profilin and Igfbp4 ).Table IDifferentially expressed sequence tags isolated from fld liver using RDAContig1-aContig refers to the sequence group to which each RDA sequence was assigned; order is arbitrary.

Open table in a new tab The F clones could be classified into 16 unique groups based on DNA sequence alignments, and the W clones could be segregated into 6 groups (Table I). These sequence groups were evaluated by comparison with nucleic acid sequence data bases using the BLAST algorithm (14Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71432) Google Scholar). 14 of 22 of the sequences could be unambiguously identified as known genes and 3 of 22 were found to be present in the expressed sequence tag data bases. The remainder either represent novel sequences with no match in data bases (i.e. F1 and F23) or sequences that are related but not identical to known genes (i.e. F4, F9, and F24). Expression levels of the RDA clones were evaluated in RNA isolated from liver of 6-day-old and adult mice via Northern blot analysis. As summarized in Table I, 13 of the 16 F clones hybridized to mRNA species with elevated expression levels in liver from 6-day-oldfld compared with wild type mice; among these was apo A-IV, which is known to be expressed at dramatically elevated levels in thefld fatty liver (1Langner C.A. Birkenmeier E.H. Ben-Zeev O. Schotz M.C. Sweet H.O. Davisson M.T. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7994-8003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three of the F clones (F7, F15, and F20) produced no detectable signal on Northern blots performed with 10 μg of total liver RNA, indicating that they are expressed at low levels. The W clones corresponding to insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 4 and troponin C hybridized to mRNA with reduced levels in the fld liver, whereas four of the W clones could not be detected on blots containing RNA from 6-day-oldfld and wild type liver. Interestingly, all of the W clones in this latter group (myosin light chain, myosin heavy chain, troponin I, and α-2 actinin) were expressed in the liver of adult (3-month-old) wild type and fld mice and exhibited elevated expression levels in adult fld compared with wild type liver (denoted in Table I by mRNA level measurements enclosed in parentheses). Of the RDA sequences isolated, only four (one F clone and three W clones) were confirmed as false positives that were expressed in wild type and fld liver at similar levels; these sequences are not included in Table I. The three cDNA tags that exhibited the greatest level of mRNA induction in fld compared with wild type liver (Fig. 1) represented previously undescribed sequences and were given the gene symbols Ifld1 , Ifld2 , and Ifld3 (induced in fld-1, -2, and -3). Ifld1 exhibits 60% amino acid sequence identity with members of the Ras family of small guanosine triphosphatases, including conservation of two GTP-binding sites and an effector domain (Fig.2 a ). Ifld2 exhibits 75% amino acid identity with a putative serine/threonine protein kinase and contains protein kinase C and casein kinase II phosphorylation recognition motifs (Fig. 2 a ).Ifld3 was found to have no significant match to sequences in current releases of nucleic acid or protein data bases. To determine whether any of these three novel sequences correspond to thefld gene on proximal Chr 12, we mapped the genes in a mouse backcross panel. Ifld1 maps to Chr 5, Ifld2 maps to Chr 2, and Ifld3 is located on Chr 3 (Fig.2 b ). These results suggest that Ifld1 andIfld2 represent novel Ras-related and serine/threonine kinase genes but excludes the three RDA clones as candidates for thefld gene itself. Additional RDA clones shown in Table I that were mapped and excluded as fld candidates include the genes for tricarboxylate transport protein (distal Chr 12, distinct from thefld locus), profilin (Chr 11), ubiquitin (Chr 11), androgen-withdrawal apoptosis protein (Chr 5), IgJH DNA with homology to bcl2 (Chr 4), and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 4 (Chr 11). Although genetic mapping results excluded Ifld1 andIfld2 as fld gene candidates, their similarity to known proteins involved in signal transduction and the striking induction of the corresponding mRNAs in the fld fatty liver suggested that they might represent an important secondary response to the underlying defect and serve as markers for the metabolic pathway(s) disrupted by the fld mutation. We therefore examined expression of Ifld1 and Ifld2 mRNA in two other tissues that exhibit abnormal phenotypes infld mice, sciatic nerve, and adipose tissue. After resolution of the fatty liver, fld mice exhibit reduced myelination and altered protein expression in sciatic nerve and drastically reduced adipose tissue mass (2Langner C.A. Birkenmeier E.H. Roth K.A. Bronson R.T. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11955-11964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Reue K. Doolittle M.H. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1387-1405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the small amount of tissue available from nerve and adipose, we used reverse transcriptase-coupled PCR to examine gene expression in these tissues from wild type and fld mice. The reverse transcriptase-coupled PCR results from liver recapitulated those seen by Northern blot, with vastly increased expression in the liver offld neonates (6 days of age), low levels in the liver of both wild type and fld adult mice (6 weeks of age), and no detectable products in samples not treated with reverse transcriptase (Fig. 3 a ). BothIfld1 and Ifld2 were also expressed in sciatic nerve, with somewhat lower levels detected in sciatic nerve from adultfld compared with wild type mice when normalized to levels of HPRT (a ubiquitously expressed mRNA) and PMP22 (a specific marker for peripheral nerve) (Fig. 3 b ). Ifld1 andIfld2 mRNA were detected in inguinal and epididymal adipose tissue at similar levels in adult wild type and fld mice. Thus, Ifld1 and Ifld2 are expressed in each of the three tissues currently known to exhibit phenotypic alterations in fld mice. We next considered the putative functions of the Ifld1 and Ifld2 proteins, together with those encoded by other RDA sequences that we had isolated (Table I). Both Ras-related proteins (Ifld1 ) and Ser/Thr kinases (Ifld2 ) are potentially involved in hormone signal transduction; interestingly, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-4 (RDA clone W18), the G protein β-subunit (F26), and the F24 sequence with similarity to a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein could also potentially function in signal transduction. A number of RDA clones with altered expression infld liver are known to be associated with the actin cytoskeleton, including actin (F27), profilin (F5), α-2 actinin (W2), and myosin light chain (W1). Because GTP-binding proteins, kinases, and the actin network are all intimately involved in the propagation of hormone signals (20Gupta P.D. Nandini R. Rao K.S. Cytobios. 1996; 86: 75-111PubMed Google Scholar, 21Tsakiridis T. Wang Q. Taha C. Grinstein S. Downey G. Klip A. Soc. Gen. Physiologists Series. 1997; 52: 257-271PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the altered expression levels of these mRNAs in fld cells might be associated with impaired capacity for hormone-induced cytoskeleton reorganization. To test this, we directly examined the actin cytoskeleton response to acute treatment with serum and insulin in primary cells isolated from wild type and fld mice. Both serum and insulin induce characteristic changes in cytoskeleton architecture in normal cells (22Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar, 23Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3083) Google Scholar). The lysophosphatidic acid present in serum induces the formation of elongated actin stress fibers, whereas insulin induces the formation of protrusions around the periphery of cells known as membrane ruffles. To determine whether cytoskeletal response to either of these stimuli was impaired in fld cells, we isolated preadipocytes from fld and wild type mice, serum starved them to produce a quiescent state, and then treated them with 1% serum or 40 ng/ml insulin for 10 min to induce cytoskeletal rearrangement (22Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar, 23Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3083) Google Scholar). The actin cytoskeleton was then visualized by staining with fluorescently tagged phalloidin, a fungal toxin that specifically binds actin. As shown in Fig. 4, the addition of serum to preadipocytes from both wild type and fld mice resulted in the formation of elongated actin stress fibers visible within the cytosol (Fig. 4, a and b ). In contrast, treatment of wild type cells with insulin elicited the formation of membrane ruffles, which result from polymerization of a meshwork of actin filaments at the cell surface (Fig. 4 c ). Remarkably, membrane ruffles were not formed upon insulin treatment of preadipocytes from fld mice (Fig. 4 d ). These results suggest that fld cells are not generally deficient in actin polymerization but that the propagation of an insulin signal through the cytoskeleton is impaired and provides a functional link with the observed alterations in mRNA levels for actin and associated proteins. Further studies will be required to determine whether the impaired hormone response of the cytoskeleton represents a direct or secondary manifestation of the underlying fld mutation. The phenotype of an organism or tissue can ultimately be traced back to the set of genes expressed in individual cells. Thus, the characterization of differences in mRNA expression between cell types provides a window into the fundamental differences in cellular function that may exist between them. Using the RDA technique, we have isolated several mRNAs with differential expression patterns in the fatty liver of fld mutant mice compared with their wild type counterparts. RDA has previously been utilized for comparison of expression patterns in cultured cells undergoing different treatments (8Braun B.S. Frieden R. Lessnick S.L. May W.A. Denny C.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 4623-4630Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 9Chu C.C. Paul W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5640-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar); the current study further establishes RDA as a reliable technique to isolate differentially expressed sequences from animal tissues as a means to compare wild type and mutant phenotypes. The expression levels for mRNAs isolated by RDA included species of high, moderate, and low abundance and both large and modest differences in hepatic expression levels between fld and wild type mice (summarized in Table I). Overall, differential mRNA expression levels were confirmed for ∼70% of the RDA clones isolated here, indicating a success rate for RDA that compares favorably to related techniques for differential mRNA cloning (24Sunday M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L273-L284PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wan J.S. Sharp S.J. Poirier G.M.-C. Wagaman P.C. Chambers J. Pyati J. Hom Y.-L. Galindo J.E. Huvar A. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Erlander M.G. Nature Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1685-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Most of the remaining clones isolated corresponded to mRNAs that could not be detected on Northern blots containing total RNA, indicating that they may be expressed at low levels. Preliminary experiments performed with primers designed to two of these sequences have allowed detection using reverse transcriptase-coupled PCR (data not shown). Most striking in terms of relative mRNA levels in fld versus wild type were the three sequences Ifld1 , Ifld2 , and Ifld3 , which exhibited vastly elevated expression levels in fld in contrast to barely detectable expression in wild type tissue. A potential limitation of the RDA technique is that it does not reveal whether differential expression at the mRNA level is ultimately reflected in the corresponding protein levels. Clearly it is not feasible to directly examine protein levels for the majority of RDA products, many of which are novel, but we have confirmed that protein levels for two of the RDA products do indeed increase in parallel with the elevated mRNA levels. Using quantitative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we previously demonstrated that apo A-IV and actin protein levels are increased 7- and 2-fold, respectively, in liver from neonatal fld compared with wild type mice (5Rehnmark S. Giometti C.S. Slavin B.G. Doolittle M.H. Reue K. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2209-2217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these two-dimensional electrophoresis studies, we detected nearly two dozen additional unidentified proteins with altered expression levels in thefld fatty liver; it is possible that some of these correspond to additional RDA products isolated in the current studies. Of primary significance in our analysis of differential gene expression in fld cells is the novel insight it has provided into the nature of the metabolic defect resulting from the fld gene mutation. Our studies revealed altered gene expression levels for several proteins that may be implicated in insulin signaling and cytoskeleton dynamics. For example, Ifld1 , which is dramatically induced in the fld fatty liver, shares approximately 60% amino acid identity to a mouse Rac protein, including conservation of GTP-binding and effector motifs, andIfld2 was identified as a putative novel Ser/Thr protein kinase based on 75% identity to members of this family (Fig. 2). Both Rac and Ser/Thr protein kinases are involved in insulin signal transduction and the resulting cytoskeletal rearrangement; Rac is absolutely required for membrane ruffle formation (23Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3083) Google Scholar), and its effect may be mediated by Ser/Thr kinases such as p21-activated protein kinases (26Dharmawardhane S. Sanders L.C. Martin S.S. Daniels R.H. Bokoch G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a number of additional RDA clones encode proteins associated with the actin cytoskeleton. These include several proteins (i.e. actin, profilin, α-actinin, and myosin) that are known to be localized to membrane ruffles (27Machesky L.M. Pollard T.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 381-385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 28Bretscher A. Lynch W. J.

Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1381-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Although our genetic mapping results excluded Ifld1 ,Ifld2 , and these cytoskeletal components as thefld gene, the altered mRNA expression levels detected infld cells may represent a compensatory response for the nonfunctional fld gene, indicating that the fld gene product may be required for development of normal insulin response. Consistent with this interpretation is our recent finding that fld mice are hyperinsulinemic and glucose intolerant, indicating impaired response of fld tissues to insulin. 2K. Reue, manuscript in preparation. The RDA clones characterized in this study were all isolated from liver, but two of the novel sequences that were isolated (Ifld1 and Ifld2 ) were also found to be expressed in two other tissues that are clearly affected by the fld mutation, adipose tissue, and peripheral nerve. In both adipocytes and peripheral nerve Schwann cells, signaling pathways triggered by insulin and/or insulin-like growth factors are crucial for the regulation of differentiation and metabolism (30Spritz N.

Our novel finding of impaired insulin response in fld cells may therefore represent a direct causal link to the phenotype of fld adipocytes and Schwann cells. The signaling pathways involved in insulin-mediated cytoskeleton dynamics and membrane ruffle formation and the gene products involved in this biochemical cascade have not been fully elucidated. The identification of the fld gene defect may therefore shed light on molecular events involved in development of normal insulin response.

Cdc2 (CDK1) is expressed in late G1/S phase and required for G2 to M phase transition in higher eukaryotes. The oncoproteins, SV40 large T antigen and adenovirus E1A, induce a 110-kDa protein which specifically recognizes the two inverted CCAAT motifs of the cdc2 promoter in cycling cells and plays an essential role in transactivation of the human cdc2 promoter. Since these CCAAT motifs also conform to the consensus binding sites for the ubiquitous heterotrimeric transcription factor, CBF/NF-Y, the role of CBF/NF-Y in the transactivation of the cdc2 promoter was examined in this study. Our results indicate that CBF/NF-Y and the 110-kDa protein interact with the CCAAT box motif to form a heteromeric complex. However, mutagenesis of the pentanucleotide CCAAT motif or in the presence of urea greater than 2.5 m, no heteromeric complex was formed. In contrast, the 110-kDa protein could still bind the mutant CCAAT motif or with the wild type motif in the presence of 2.5 m urea. Furthermore, E1A.12S induced the gene expression of all three subunits of CBF/NF-Y. Coexpression of E1A and a dominant negative mutant NF-YA subunit significantly reduced the E1A-mediated transactivation of the cdc2 promoter in a dose-dependent manner. These results support the conclusion that E1A protein mediates optimal transactivation of the humancdc2 promoter by inducing the expression and assembly of a heteromeric complex consisting of the 110-kDa protein and the CBF/NF-Y which interacts with the two CCAAT motifs of the cdc2 promoter.

The low levels of the cdc2 gene expression in growth arrested baby rat kidney cells are also dramatically reversed by expression of the oncoproteins of DNA tumor viruses, adenovirus E1A (E1A) and SV40 large T antigen (SV40-LT). This activation of the cdc2 gene expression is accompanied by induction of p34Cdc2 kinase activity, pRB phosphorylation, and DNA synthesis (22Wang H.G. Draetta G. Moran E. Mol. Cell.

An independent pathway by which E1A promotes cell growth is by its association with p300/CBP which is required as a coactivator of p53 and inhibition of p53-dependent p21Cip1/Waf1 expression resulting in the release of cells from G1 arrest and in stimulation of cellular DNA synthesis (36Avantaggiati M.L.

The association of E1A with p27Kip1 also has been shown to overcome the transforming growth factor-β1-mediated growth arrest at G1 phase of the cell cycle (41Mal A. Poon R.Y. Howe P.H. Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Harter M.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Previous studies in our laboratory showed that E1A and SV40-LT transactivate the human cdc2 promoter in cycling cells by inducing a 110-kDa protein which specifically recognizes the two-inverted CCAAT box (ATTGG in the opposite strand) motifs in thecdc2 promoter located at positions −74 to −78 and −42 to −46 with respect to transcription start site (42Chen H. Campisi J. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13959-13967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 43Tanimoto A. Chen H. Kao C. Moran E. Sasaguri Y. Padmanbhan R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3103-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The CCAAT motifs are present in many eukaryotic class II promoters and are also specific binding sites for the ubiquitously expressed heterotrimeric transcription factor, NF-Y (CBF/NF-Y). CBF/NF-Y consists of three subunits (A, B, and C) which are all required for DNA binding activity (44Bucher P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 563-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 45van Huisjduijnen R.H. Li X.Y. Black D. Matthes H. Benoist C. Mathis D.

Chem. 1992; 267: 16574-16580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, NF-Y is known to function in most cases in conjunction with a variety of specific transcriptional activators to achieve optimal levels of gene expression. For example, in albumin promoter, NF-Y and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) are both required for optimal level of liver-specific gene expression (48Milos P.M. Zaret K.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The transcriptional regulation of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase gene involved in cholesterol biosynthetic pathway is achieved by the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins together with CBF/NF-Y through sterol regulatory element and the CCAAT box motif in the promoters of target genes. A direct interaction between sterol regulatory element-binding proteins and CBF/NF-Y was demonstrated in that study (49Dooley K.A. Millinder S. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1349-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that CBF/NF-Y interacts with the 110-kDa protein induced by adenovirus E1A.12S. The formation of this heteromeric complex is disrupted by mutagenesis of the pentanucleotide CCAAT motif or by treatment with urea greater than 2.5 m. The 110-kDa protein, however, could still bind the mutant DNA fragment or the wild type DNA fragment in the presence of 2.5 m urea indicating that the protein binds to the flanking sequences of the pentanucleotide CCAAT motif. Hence it is referred as the CCAAT box-associated factor in this study (CBAF/cdc2). Furthermore, we show that expression of E1A increases the steady state levels of mRNAs encoding all three subunits of CBF/NF-Y. In addition, we present evidence that the heterotrimeric CBF/NF-Y plays an important role in transactivation of the human cdc2 promoter by E1A based on the results that the expression of a dominant negative mutant CBF/NF-YA interferes with this transactivation in a dose-dependent manner. Our results, taken together, suggest that E1A mediates optimal transactivation of the human cdc2 promoter by inducing both the heterotrimeric CBF/NF-Y and the 110-kDa CBAF/cdc2 as the costimulatory factor for NF-Y. Human embryonic kidney cells transformed by early region 1 of adenovirus (293 cells) were grown in Joklik's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) in spinner suspension flasks. Fisher rat liver epithelial cell line (RLE) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml each of streptomycin and penicillin. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2. For preparation of nuclear extracts, RLE cells in 80% confluence were infected with adenovirus encoding E1A.12S ((22); kindly provided by Dr. Elizabeth Moran, Temple University) at 50 plaque forming units/cell. Cells were harvested 48 h post-infection and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (42Chen H. Campisi J. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13959-13967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were carried out as described previously (42Chen H. Campisi J. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13959-13967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The double-stranded DNA was labeled at the 5′-end by T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP following standard procedures (50Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Edition Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used in this study are: 1) the distal CCAAT element of the human cdc2 promoter (5′-CATGGGCTCTGATTGGCTGCTTTG-3′), 2) (Mut-CCAAT) probe containing mutated CCAAT box motif (5′-CATGGGCTCTGAggccCTGCTTTG-3′), 3) probe containing the proximal CCAAT box-binding motif of the humancdc2 promoter (5′-GCTACCCGATTGGTGAATCCG-3′). As a control for competition experiments in gel mobility assays, the unrelated oligonucleotide containing the E2F-like binding site of p21Cip1 promoter (5′-CAGCTGCTCCGCGCTGGGCAGCCAG-3′) was used. For EMSA, nuclear extracts (5 μg/lane) were mixed in 20 μl of reaction buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 5 mmKCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.15 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml poly(dI-dC) with the labeled probe (5 × 105 cpm/lane). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and stopped by adding 2 μl of stop solution containing 50 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol, and 5% glycerol. The DNA-protein complexes were fractionated by electrophoresis on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography using x-ray films (NEN Life Science Products Inc.). For supershift experiments, EMSA reaction mixtures were incubated with 1.5 to 5.0 μg of rabbit anti-NF-YA or NF-YB antibody (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA) for 1 h on ice prior to addition of the probes. UV cross-linking was carried out (61Kramer A. Carstens C.P. Wasserman W.W. Fahl W.E. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5117-5121PubMed Google Scholar) as follows. A 29-bp DNA probe was made using Klenow DNA polymerase-catalyzed fill-in reaction in the presence of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine triphosphate (Sigma) and [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products) and dNTPs. The two primers used were partially complementary oligonucleotides with the sequences of 5′-CATGGGCTCTGATTGGCTGCTTTG-3′ and 5′-GGGGGCAAAGCA-3′. The labeled probe was added to the EMSA reaction mixture containing 20 μg of the nuclear extract from 293 cells. DNA-protein complexes were fractionated by 4% nondenaturing gel. The DNA-protein complexes were located by autoradiography by exposing the gel to the x-ray film overnight at 4 °C. The band was excised and exposed to 285 nm UV light for 15 min at 4 °C. Then the excised gel fragment was mixed with 2 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer and laid in the well of a 4% stacking polyacrylamide gel polymerized over a 6% resolving gel containing 0.1% SDS. After electrophoresis, the UV cross-linked DNA-protein complexes were detected by autoradiography. The conditions used for Southwestern blot analysis were as described previously (42Chen H. Campisi J. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13959-13967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of nuclear proteins from 293 cells were loaded in each lane and were fractionated by 8.0% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). After denaturation and renaturation steps, the proteins immobilized on the membrane were incubated with the 5′-32P-labeled distal or proximal cdc 2/CCAAT probe (106 cpm/ml). The membranes were washed and subjected to autoradiography. The nuclear extracts from 293 cells were precleaned by incubation with normal rabbit serum followed by treatment with protein-A-agarose beads (Life Technologies, Inc.). The supernatant obtained after centrifugation was incubated with anti-NF-YA antibody, normal rabbit serum, or an unrelated antiserum raised against hepatitis C virus NS5A protein. The precipitated protein complex was recovered by protein A-agarose beads. The immunoprecipitated complexes were subsequently subjected to Southwestern blot analysis using 5′-32P-labeled distal or proximal cdc 2/CCAAT probe to detect the 110-kDa CBAF/cdc2. Total RNAs were obtained from the adenovirus-infected RLE cells 32 h post-infection by using Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Twenty micrograms of the RNAs were fractionated on 1% agarose, 6% formaldehyde gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. After heating the membrane at 80 °C for 2 h, the membrane was hybridized with a 32P-labeled probe using the Quick-Hyb hybridization solution. Probes used for the Northern blottings were rat NF-Ya (CBF-B) and NF-Yb (CBF-A) and NF-Yc cDNAs (pCITE2a-CBF-A, -B, and -C were kindly provided by Dr. S. Maity, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center). For detection of the cdc2 mRNA the probe used was a DNA fragment derived from the cDNA encoding human cdc2 by digesting the pCMV1-cdc2 plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. J. Campisi, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, University of California) withBgl II and Kpn I. RLE cells (in 45% confluence) in 25-cm2 culture flasks were infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing wild type 12S.E.1A. One hour after infection, cells were transfected with cdc2 promoter-CAT reporter plasmids (cdc2 -Taq I-CAT; 3 μg) (42Chen H. Campisi J. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13959-13967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). pRSV-Escherichia coli β-galactosidase expression plasmid was co-transfected as the internal control to monitor and normalize the transfection efficiencies. Human cdc2 Promoter Contains Two Inverted CCAAT Box Motifs Which Conform to Consensus NF-Y-binding Sites and Are Recognized by the 110-kDa CBAF/cdc2 and NF-Y— The two inverted CCAAT box motifs of the human cdc2 promoter conform to the consensus NF-Y-binding site, TGATTGG(T/C)(T/C)(A/G), derived from a random polymerase chain reaction-based selection procedure (52Bi W. Wu L. Coustry F. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26562-26572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Our previous studies indicated that a 110-kDa protein (referred as CBAF/cdc2 in this study) was induced by the oncoproteins, SV40-LT and E1A, and it was overproduced in cells transformed by SV40 and adenovirus E1 region (COS and human 293 cells, respectively). This protein specifically bound the 180-bp DNA fragment containing both CCAAT motifs or a 24-bp fragment containing the distal motif (42Chen H. Campisi J. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13959-13967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 43Tanimoto A. Chen H. Kao C. Moran E. Sasaguri Y. Padmanbhan R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3103-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to determine whether DNA-protein complexes formed between the distal CCAAT motif of the cdc2 promoter and the nuclear extracts of human 293 cells also contained the ubiquitous CBF/NF-Y. As shown in Fig.1 A (lane 2 ), the nuclear extracts from human 293 cells formed three major complexes (C-I, -II and -III) with the 32P-labeled distal CCAAT motif used as a probe in EMSA. The specificity of these DNA-protein complexes formed with the CCAAT motif was established by competition experiments using unlabeled oligonucleotides containing wild type CCAAT, unrelated E2F-binding site, or the mutated CCAAT motif (lanes 3–5 , respectively). To determine whether any of these DNA-protein complexes also contained CBF/NF-Y, supershift assays in which rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against CBF/NF-YA and CBF/NF-YB subunits were incubated with the DNA-protein complexes. The results shown in Fig.1 B (lanes 3 and 5 ) indicated that the antibodies against NF-YA and NF-YB supershifted the complex I, although the commercial anti-NF-YB was much less efficient than the anti-NF-YA. However, both antibodies had no effect on complexes II and III, which suggested that these complexes do not include NF-Y. Moreover, incubation with normal rabbit serum used as control (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and 4 ) had no effect. These results indicated that the DNA-protein complex I contains CBF/NF-Y. We did not test for the presence of CBF/NF-YC in this complex because a suitable antibody against the C subunit was not available for this study. However, the complex I is likely to include the CBF/NF-YC as previous studies have shown that all three subunits are required for DNA binding (47Maity S.N. Sinha S. Ruteshouser E.C. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16574-16580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Next we analyzed whether the complex I also included the 110-kDa CBAF/cdc2 protein using the UV cross-linking method. First,32P- and 5′-bromodeoxyuridine-labeled cdc2 CCAAT motif was used for EMSA. Subsequent to EMSA and autoradiographic detection of the three major DNA-protein complexes (C-I to C-III), the complex I band was cut out from the polyacrylamide gel. The gel piece was exposed to UV as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the labeled DNA-protein complex was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to autoradiography. The results shown in Fig. 1 C indicated that two significant bands with estimated sizes of 110 and 45 kDa (lane 4 ) were detected, while samples with no UV treatment served as negative control (lane 3 ). The 45-kDa band is consistent with the reported size for CBF/NF-YA subunit (47Maity S.N. Sinha S. Ruteshouser E.C. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16574-16580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further confirm that the 110-kDa CBF/cdc2 and CBF/NF-Y directly interact, we performed the immunoprecipitation experiments with nuclear extracts from 293 cells using anti-NF-YA antibody. The immune complex was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Southwestern blot analysis using32P-labeled distal CCAAT motif of the cdc2 promoter as the probe. As shown in Fig. 1 D (lane 2 ), the results from Southwestern blot analysis showed that only the anti-NF-YA immune complex from 293 cell extracts contained the 110-kDa CBAF/cdc2 protein (lane 2 ), but not the immune complexes obtained using normal rabbit serum or an unrelated antiserum raised against hepatitis C virus NS5A protein (lanes 1 and3 , respectively). The results taken together indicated that the 110-kDa CBAF/cdc2 and the CBF/NF-Y formed a heteromeric complex with the DNA fragment containing the distal CCAAT motif of thecdc2 promoter. Since the 293 cells are constitutively expressing proteins encoded by the adenovirus E1 region, which encodes E1A and E1B proteins (53Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russell W.C. Nairn R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (3512) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether this heteromeric complex I is induced by E1A alone. For these experiments, RLE cells were used for expression of E1A protein by infection with a recombinant adenovirus encoding E1A.12S. The nuclear extracts prepared from the infected RLE cells were analyzed by EMSA. As shown in Fig. 2, the endogenous levels of the 110-kDa CBAF/cdc2 (Fig. 2 B, lane 1 ) as well as the formation of complex I in EMSA (Fig. 2 A, lane 2 ) were barely detectable in the absence of E1A expression in RLE cells. The results shown in Fig. 2 A indicate that the formation of the heteromeric DNA-protein complex I was also induced by transient expression of E1A.12S protein in RLE cells (lane 3 ). Evidence that this complex I also contained CBF/NF-Y was obtained by supershift assays performed by incubation with antibodies against NF-YA and NF-YB (lanes 5, 6 , and 8 ) whereas in"

Among these proteins are the six general transcription factors, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH (reviewed in Ref. 1Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). These factors are the subject of much investigation toward the goal of determining their respective functions in transcription initiation, elongation, and regulation. The association of the general transcription factors and RNAPII to form a functional preinitiation complex (PIC) on a class II promoter is proposed to occur by one of two mechanisms (reviewed in Refs. 1Orphanides G.

For some promoters, the binding of TFIID is stabilized by the association of TFIIA. This “DA” complex is recognized by TFIIB, which binds and promotes the recruitment of TFIIF and RNAPII. The subsequent association of TFIIE and TFIIH completes PIC assembly, which is followed by ATP hydrolysis, promoter melting, and the initiation of mRNA synthesis. An alternative model for PIC formation was based upon the identification of an RNAPII holoenzyme from yeast and mammalian cell extracts (5Koleske A.J. Young R.A.

In the holoenzyme recruitment model, the holoenzyme, consisting of RNAPII, Srb and Med factors, most of the general transcription factors, and additional factors, is directly recruited to promoter-bound TFIID in vivo (reviewed in Ref.1Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). In both the stepwise assembly and holoenzyme recruitment models, TFIIB is viewed as playing an essential role by binding promoter-bound TFIID and acting as a molecular bridge to RNAPII and the rest of the transcription machinery. The TFIIB polypeptide is composed of a protease-sensitive N-terminal region that is highly conserved, followed by a protease-resistant C-terminal core domain containing two imperfect direct repeats (Fig. 1) (8Barberis A.

Structural studies have shown that the N-terminal region ofPyrococcus furiosus TFIIB contains a zinc ribbon fold, whereas each repeat in the core domain of human TFIIB is comprised of five α-helices that pack into a globular structure (10Zhu W.

In addition to its central role in the architecture of the PIC, TFIIB may also play a role in the regulation of transcription by gene-specific regulatory factors. Genetic and molecular studies of yeast TFIIB have identified a species-specific region in the core domain that is reportedly important for transcriptional activation in vivo (24Shaw S.P. Wingfield J.

Although much has been elucidated regarding the general functions of TFIIB and the factors to which it binds, the precise mechanisms involved in the potential regulation of TFIIB activity or the role of TFIIB in transcriptional activation remain to be determined. A possible mechanism for the regulation of TFIIB activity and its role in activation were suggested by the finding of an interaction between the N-terminal region and the core domain of human TFIIB that is altered by the VP16 activator protein (34Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Recent NMR analyses have confirmed this interaction in human TFIIB and have demonstrated that the conformation of the core domain can be altered by interaction with either an N-terminal TFIIB peptide or with VP16 (35Hayashi F. Ishima R. Liu D. Tong K.I. Kim S. Reinberg D. Bagby S. Ikura M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7941-7951Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We previously identified a yeast TFIIB mutant (R64E) that exhibited increased activity in the formation of stable TBP-TFIIB-DNA (DB) complexes in vitro (16Bangur C.S. Pardee T.S. Ponticelli A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6784-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To investigate the molecular basis for this increased activity, we have used a partial proteolysis assay to probe the structure of the R64E mutant protein and affinity chromatography to investigate the potential interaction between the yeast TFIIB N-terminal region and the core domain. We report here that, as observed for human TFIIB, the N-terminal region and the core domain of yeast TFIIB physically interact. Importantly, the increased activity of the R64E mutant protein in DB complex formation was associated with an altered protease sensitivity of the protein and an enhanced interaction between the N-terminal region and the core domain. We discuss these results in light of previous work regarding the potential role(s) of the TFIIB intramolecular interaction in modulating PIC formation. The human TFIIB R53E mutant was constructed by the megaprimer method of PCR site-directed mutagenesis using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) and plasmid pSP72/hIIB as template (16Bangur C.S. Pardee T.S. Ponticelli A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6784-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For the production of recombinant protein, the entire coding region of the R53E mutant was cloned into plasmid p314/yIIBN (16Bangur C.S. Pardee T.S. Ponticelli A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6784-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) usingNde I and Pst I and then transferred into plasmid pQE32* (16Bangur C.S. Pardee T.S. Ponticelli A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6784-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) using Nde I and Pst I to generate plasmid pQE/hR53E. Plasmid pQE/hIIB was constructed by inserting the entire coding region of human TFIIB from pSP72/hIIB into pQE32* usingNde I and Pst I. For the production of recombinant glutathione S -transferase (GST)-yeast TFIIB core domain fusion proteins, the coding region corresponding to yeast TFIIB residues 120–345 was amplified by PCR using Vent polymerase with the introduction of a unique Nde I site at the ATG corresponding to residue 120. The amplified DNA fragment was cloned into plasmid pQE32* using Nde I and Pst I and then excised from this construct and cloned into plasmid pGEX* using Nde I andEco RI to generate pGEX/CoreIIB. Plasmid pGEX* is a derivative of pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that contains anNde I, Not I, Xho I, Bam HI, and Eco RI site for cloning. For the production of polyhistidine-tagged N-terminal 89-residue (N89) yeast TFIIB proteins, plasmids p314/yIIBN and p314/R64E (16Bangur C.S. Pardee T.S. Ponticelli A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6784-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) were used as templates to PCR amplify the coding region corresponding to residues 1–89 with the introduction of a stop codon at residue 90 followed by anEco RI site. The amplified DNA fragments were cloned into pQE32* using Nde I and Eco RI to generate plasmids pQE/N89-WT and pQE/N89-R64E. For the production of wild-type and R64E mutant TFIIB proteins containing a c-Myc epitope tag at the C terminus, PCR amplification was performed using pQE/yIIB as template, an upstream primer in the TFIIB coding region (YIIB-4), and a downstream primer (YIIB-myc) that encodes the c-Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL) fused in frame to the C terminus. The resulting PCR product was digested withHin dIII to obtain a 130-base pair fragment, which was substituted for the Hin dIII–Hin dIII fragment of pQE/yIIB and pQE/R64E to obtain pQE/yIIB-myc and pQE/R64E-myc, respectively. Polyhistidine-tagged TFIIB proteins were expressed under control of the phage T5 promoter in plasmid pQE32* in Escherichia coli strain JM109. Cultures (500 ml) were grown at 37 °C in 2× YT medium with 100 μg of ampicillin/ml to an A 600 of 0.6–0.8, and expression was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mmfinal concentration) for 3 h. Cells were harvested, suspended in 5 ml of Buffer L (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm imidazole, and protease inhibitors (0.5 μg of pepstatin A/ml, 0.5 μg of leupeptin/ml, 2 μg of chymostatin/ml, 1 μg of bestatin/ml, 2.5 μg of antipain/ml, 0.5 μg of aprotinin/ml, 1 mm PMSF, 2 mm benzamidine)), and lysed by two passages in a French press at 900 p.s.i. at 4 °C. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. DNase I (10 μg/ml final concentration) and RNase A (20 μg/ml final concentration) were added, and the lysate was incubated for 30 min. EDTA was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm, and the lysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 × g . The supernatant was loaded in batch onto 1 ml of Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (QIAGEN) for 60 min, and the resin was subsequently packed into a column. The column was washed with 15 ml of Buffer W (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm imidazole, 0.2 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors), and protein was eluted with 10 ml of Buffer W containing 250 mm imidazole, collecting 1-ml fractions. Peak fractions of yeast TFIIB were pooled (2–3 ml final volume) and dialyzed versus Buffer B (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm potassium acetate, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitors). Peak fractions of human TFIIB were dialyzedversus 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 250 mm KCl, 10 mm magnesium sulfate, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm PMSF. Purified TFIIB proteins were quantitated by Bio-Rad protein assays and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and judged to be >90% pure. Dilutions of TFIIB proteins were made in Buffer B containing 500 μg of bovine serum albumin/ml. Polyhistidine-tagged N89 TFIIB proteins were expressed and purified essentially as described for the full-length TFIIB proteins except that the peptides were further purified by fast protein liquid chromatography using a Superdex75 HR 10/30 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) sizing column. The separation was carried out at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using 20 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 500 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm PMSF as the running buffer. Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated using a BIOMAX-5 (Millipore) spin column, and purity was judged to be >99% by Coomassie Blue staining. GST and GST-CoreIIB fusion proteins were expressed under control of the phage T7 promoter in plasmid pGEX* in E. coli strain BL21. Cultures (500 ml) were grown at 37 °C in 2× YT medium with 100 μg of ampicillin/ml to an A 600 of 0.6–0.8, and expression was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.4 mm final concentration) for 4 h. Cells were harvested, suspended in 5 ml of Buffer L, and lysed by two passages in a French press at 900 p.s.i. at 4 °C. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. DNase I (10 μg/ml final concentration) and RNase A (20 μg/ml final) were added, and the lysate was incubated for 30 min. EDTA was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm, and the lysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 ×g . The supernatant was loaded in batch onto 1 ml of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 60 min, and the resin was subsequently packed into a column. The column was washed with 20 ml of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 500 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors followed by 10 ml of Buffer S (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 200 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitors, and 0.03% sodium azide). The beads with bound proteins were resuspended in Buffer S and stored at 4 °C as a 50% suspension.

Reactions were incubated at 30 °C, and 10-μl aliquots were removed at the indicated time points and mixed with 2 μl of 6× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The reaction products were boiled for 5 min, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. For immunoblotting, reactions (100 μl) contained 200 ng of TFIIB, 20 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 5 ng of V8 protease, and 20-μl aliquots were removed at each time point. Immunoblotting was performed using a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for the c-Myc epitope tag (1:1000 dilution) (Babco) followed by goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase (1:40,000 dilution) (The Jackson Laboratory). The membrane was incubated with Pierce SuperSignal ULTRA chemiluminescent substrate and exposed to Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Glutathione-Sepharose beads (20 μl) containing 50 pmol of bound GST or GST-yeast TFIIB core domain fusion protein were incubated with polyhistidine-tagged N89 wild-type or R64E mutant TFIIB proteins at 4 °C in 500 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 50 mmKCl, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm DTT, 500 μg of bovine serum albumin/ml, and 0.1 mm PMSF) in MicroSpin columns (Bio-Rad) for 2 h. The beads were washed once with 500 μl of binding buffer and four times with 500 μl of wash buffer (40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mmpotassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 mm PMSF). The bound proteins were eluted with 40 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and 10 μl were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for the N-terminal polyhistidine tag derived from plasmid pQE32* (1:2000 dilution) (RGS-His, QIAGEN) followed by goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase (1:40,000 dilution) (The Jackson Laboratory). The membrane was incubated with Pierce SuperSignal ULTRA chemiluminescent substrate and exposed to Hyperfilm-MP. We reported previously that the yeast TFIIB R64E mutant was more active than wild-type yeast TFIIB in the formation of stable DB complexes in vitro (16Bangur C.S. Pardee T.S. Ponticelli A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6784-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To extend the biochemical characterization of the R64E protein and to determine the functional significance of this elevated activity, we initially sought to determine 1) whether the R64E substitution confers an altered conformation to the mutant protein and 2) whether a homologous substitution in human TFIIB (R53E) also confers increased activity for DB complex formation. To facilitate the probing of protein conformation by immunoblotting (described under “The Yeast R64E TFIIB Protein Exhibits an Altered Sensitivity to V8 Protease”), we constructed variants of wild-type and R64E yeast TFIIB that contained a c-Myc epitope fused to the C terminus of the protein. To verify that the C-terminal Myc tag did not affect DB complex formation, the wild-type and R64E Myc-tagged recombinant proteins were purified and analyzed for their activities in DB complex formation using a gel mobility shift assay. Consistent with the results obtained previously with the non-tagged counterparts, comparable amounts of stable DB complexes were formed in reactions containing 2 pmol of Myc-tagged wild-type or R64E protein, whereas at lower TFIIB concentrations, reactions containing the R64E mutant yielded approximately 5 times more DB complex than wild-type TFIIB (Fig. 2, A andB ). As seen previously, the DB complexes containing the R64E protein exhibited a slightly altered mobility in the native gel compared with DB complexes containing wild-type TFIIB. This alteration is likely to be due solely to the change in the charge of the protein, as a similar alteration in mobility is observed for DB complexes containing other yeast TFIIB mutants with a basic to acidic amino acid substitution (data not shown). The elevated levels of DB complexes formed with the R64E protein could be due to the mutant protein altering the kinetics and/or the equilibrium of the DB complex reaction. To distinguish between these possibilities, a time course for DB complex formation was performed where the amounts of DB complexes formed between 5 and 40 min of incubation with wild-type or R64E protein were compared. The results revealed that the DB reactions reached equilibrium within 5 min of incubation and that the reactions containing the R64E protein yielded elevated levels of DB complex at all time points (Fig. 2 C ). These results suggest that the R64E substitution affects the equilibrium but apparently not the kinetics of the DB complex reaction. The arginine residue at position 64 in yeast TFIIB is invariant among seven eukaryotic species and resides within a highly conserved homology block in the N-terminal region of the protein (17Pardee T.S. Bangur C.S. Ponticelli A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17859-17864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To determine whether a homologous substitution in human TFIIB also confers increased activity for DB complex formation, we constructed plasmids for the production of recombinant human wild-type and R53E mutant TFIIB proteins and compared the activities of the purified proteins in DB complex formation. Comparable amounts of stable DB complexes were formed in reactions containing 1 pmol of wild-type or R53E human TFIIB protein, whereas at lower TFIIB concentrations, reactions containing the R53E mutant yielded approximately 2–3 times more DB complex than wild-type TFIIB (Fig. 3). These results demonstrate that the R53E substitution in human TFIIB also increases DB complex formation although the effect is less pronounced than that observed with the R64E substitution in yeast TFIIB. Having demonstrated that the introduction of a C-terminal Myc tag did not alter DB complex formation (Fig. 2), we utilized a partial proteolysis assay to probe the structure of the wild-type and R64E yeast TFIIB proteins. The Myc-tagged proteins were subjected to a time course of limited proteolytic digestion usingS. aureus V8 protease, and the proteolytic cleavage products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by either Coomassie Blue staining or immunoblotting using a monoclonal antibody directed against the Myc epitope. The results revealed that the R64E substitution did not alter the position of the major cleavage site but rather the substitution conferred a significant effect on the kinetics of cleavage. Coomassie Blue staining of the reaction products from wild-type protein revealed major V8 cleavage products of approximately 28 and 18 kDa that were readily observed within 5 min of digestion (Fig. 4 A ). In contrast, these reaction products were only weakly detected after 10–20 min of digestion with the R64E protein (Fig. 4 A ). Immunoblotting revealed that the approximately 28-kDa cleavage product was detected with the antibody that recognizes the Myc epitope at the C terminus of the proteins and confirmed that the production of this fragment was significantly reduced with the R64E protein (Fig. 4 B ). To further map the approximate position of the major V8 cleavage site, the cleavage products were immunoblotted alongside a C-terminal Myc-tagged core domain that contains yeast residues 119–345 fused to a 13-residue N-terminal polyhistidine tag and the 10-residue C-terminal Myc tag. The results revealed that the 28-kDa cleavage product nearly comigrated with the doubly tagged core domain (Fig. 4 C ), suggesting that the major V8 cleavage site corresponds to either Glu-100 or Glu-109, which reside in the hinge region between the highly conserved N-terminal region and the core domain (Fig. 4 D ). Taken together, these findings suggest that the R64E substitution induces or stabilizes a conformation of the yeast TFIIB protein that diminishes the susceptibility of the hinge region to proteolytic attack. Arg-53 of human TFIIB, homologous to yeast TFIIB Arg-64, resides within a 42-amino acid segment of the human N-terminal region that interacts with the core domain (34Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To determine whether the N-terminal region and the core domain of yeast TFIIB also physically interact and whether the R64E substitution alters this interaction, we tested the ability of purified recombinant proteins containing the N-terminal 89 residues of wild-type or R64E yeast TFIIB to bind to a GST-yeast core domain fusion protein. The wild-type N-terminal region bound the core domain, demonstrating a conservation of the interaction that was reported for human TFIIB (Fig.5 A ). Importantly, the R64E N-terminal region exhibited enhanced binding to the core domain compared with wild-type TFIIB (Fig. 5 A ). At the lowest concentration of input N-terminal fragments (2.5 pmol), the degree of enhanced binding with the R64E N-terminal fragment could not be quantitated because there was no detectable binding of the wild-type N-terminal fragment. In reactions containing 5 or 10 pmol of input N-terminal fragments, the degree of enhanced binding with the R64E N-terminal fragment was approximately 7- and 3-fold, respectively (Fig.5, A and B ). These results demonstrate that the increased activity of the R64E protein in DB complex formation is associated with an enhanced interaction between the N-terminal region and the core domain. In this study, we have investigated the molecular basis for the increased activity of the yeast TFIIB R64E mutant in DB complex formation. At limiting TFIIB concentrations, the R64E protein yielded approximately 5 times more DB complex than wild-type yeast TFIIB (Fig.2). Similarly, the homologous human R53E mutant yielded approximately 2–3 times more DB complex than wild-type human TFIIB (Fig. 3). These results suggest that a conserved function of TFIIB is altered by the yeast R64E and human R53E substitutions to increase DB complex formation. As an initial step in extending the biochemical characterization of the R64E protein, we sought to determine whether the R64E substitution conferred an altered conformation to the protein. Using a partial proteolysis assay, we determined that the R64E mutant protein was significantly more resistant than wild-type yeast TFIIB to protease cleavage in the hinge region between the N-terminal region and the core domain (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the R64E substitution in yeast TFIIB induces or stabilizes a conformation of the protein that diminishes the accessibility of the hinge region to protease action. Previous biochemical studies demonstrated an interaction between the N-terminal region and the core domain of human TFIIB (34Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 35Hayashi F. Ishima R. Liu D. Tong K.I. Kim S. Reinberg D. Bagby S. Ikura M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7941-7951Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because the core domain directly interacts with TBP and the DNA near the TATA element (22Lee S. Hahn S. Nature. 1995; 376: 609-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 23Lagrange T. Kapanidis A.N. Tang H. Reinberg D. Ebright R.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), an interaction involving the N-terminal region and the core domain of TFIIB could play a role in modulating the stable association of TFIIB with promoter-bound TBP. The region of the human N-terminal domain involved in the interaction was localized to residues 24–65, which includes Arg-53, homologous to yeast Arg-64 (34Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We speculated that the human R53E and yeast R64E substitutions might alter this interaction to expose the core domain or alter its conformation, resulting in an increased number of molecules in a productive conformation for stable DB complex formation. Affinity chromatography utilizing wild-type or R64E N-terminal protein fragments and GST-core domain fusion protein demonstrated that the N-terminal region and the core domain of yeast TFIIB physically interacted and that the R64E substitution enhanced this interaction (Fig. 5). Compared with the wild-type N-terminal region, the R64E N-terminal region exhibited 3–7-fold enhanced binding to the core domain, which correlates well with the 5-fold increased activity of the R64E protein in DB complex formation. Taken together, our results suggest that the R64E substitution in yeast TFIIB enhances an interaction between the N-terminal region and the core domain and that this enhancement stabilizes a conformation of the protein that is both more protease resistant in the hinge region and more efficient in stable DB complex formation. Although the intramolecular interaction in yeast and human TFIIB is likely to be of functional importance, the precise role(s) of this interaction in the potential modulation of TFIIB activity remains to be determined. It was previously proposed that the intramolecular interaction in human TFIIB regulates the stepwise assembly of PICs at the level of TFIIF and RNAPII entry (34Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In this model, the majority of native TFIIB was proposed as being in a “closed” conformation because of the interaction between the N-terminal region and the core domain. This conformation of TFIIB was viewed as being inactive for PIC assembly because of the potential inaccessibility of the binding sites for TFIIF and RNAPII in the N-terminal region. Interaction with the VP16 activator was proposed to disrupt the intramolecular interaction to expose the TFIIF and RNAPII binding sites and drive PIC assembly forward. Our results reported here are consistent with the possibility that the intramolecular interaction in TFIIB plays a role in modulating TFIIF and RNAPII association in stepwise PIC assembly but suggest that an additional function of the intramolecular interaction is to promote the association of TFIIB with promoter-bound TBP. If the intramolecular interaction in TFIIB promotes the association of TFIIB with promoter-bound TBP, what is the underlying mechanism? Previous structural studies revealed that the relative positions of the direct repeats in the core domain of human TFIIB are rotated in the DB complex compared with their orientation in core domain that is free in solution (11Bagby S. Kim S. Maldonado E. Tong K.I. Reinberg D. Ikura M. Cell. 1995; 82: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 12Nikolov D.B. Chen H. Halay E.D. Usheva A.A. Hisatake K. Lee D.K. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. Nature. 1995; 377: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that the core domain may exist in either a productive or a non-productive conformation for efficient DB complex formation that is defined by the orientation of the direct repeats. Recent NMR studies by Ikura and colleagues (35Hayashi F. Ishima R. Liu D. Tong K.I. Kim S. Reinberg D. Bagby S. Ikura M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7941-7951Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the free core domain exhibits a fair degree of conformational fluctuation and that similar chemical shifts are induced in the core domain upon interaction with either an N-terminal TFIIB peptide or with the VP16 activation domain. Moreover, it was shown that the NMR spectrum of full-length human TFIIB exhibits large line widths and chemical shift overlap but that binding of the VP16 activation domain results in a significant improvement in the spectrum. As stated by the authors, these observations suggest that TFIIB exists in multiple conformations in solution and that the equilibrium between these forms can be altered by the interaction of either VP16 or the TFIIB N-terminal region with the core domain. In light of these NMR studies and our results reported here, we propose that the interaction between the N-terminal region and the core domain of TFIIB stabilizes a productive conformation of the core domain for efficient association with promoter-bound TBP (Fig. 6). In this model, the strengthening of this interaction in the yeast R64E mutant would shift the equilibrium toward the productive conformation, resulting in a greater number of TFIIB molecules that are both more protease-resistant in the hinge region and more efficient in stable DB complex formation. In this regard, the results from Fig. 2 C support the view that the R64E substitution affects the equilibrium for stable DB complex formation and not the rate at which equilibrium is achieved. It is also interesting to note that the yeast R64E substitution increased DB complex formation to a greater degree than the human R53E substitution and that yeast TFIIB appeared to be less efficient than human TFIIB in DB complex formation (Figs. 2 and 3). The apparent lower intrinsic activity of yeast TFIIB in DB complex formation, as well as the more pronounced effect of the R64E substitution, could be attributable to yeast TFIIB having additional residues in the linker region between the direct repeats in the core domain. The longer interrepeat linker in yeast TFIIB could confer greater flexibility and conformational variability to the core domain, resulting in a smaller fraction of the molecules at equilibrium being in the productive conformation for DB complex formation. Continued studies of the intramolecular interaction in TFIIB should provide important information regarding the modulation of TFIIB function and the regulation of PIC formation.

They oxidize lipophilic quinols and reduce water-soluble proteins, eitherc -type cytochromes or plastocyanin. In chloroplasts, plastoquinol oxidation occurs at a quinol-binding site of the protein complex located close to the lumenal side of the thylakoid membrane. A first electron is transferred from the plastoquinol along a high potential chain, via a [2Fe-2S] center and a c -type cytochrome to the soluble acceptor, plastocyanin or cytochromec 6. A second electron is transferred across the membrane from the plastosemiquinone produced by the first oxidation step via two b hemes to a plastoquinone bound at a quinone-reducing site of the complex close to the stromal side of the membrane. During the functional turnover of cytochromeb 6 f complex, there is a net release of protons at the lumenal side of the membrane, whereas protons are taken up from the stromal side. The cytochrome b 6 f complex from the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is similar to those from higher plants. It comprises at least seven subunits, five of which are chloroplast-encoded and two are nucleus-encoded (for a review see Ref. 3Wollman F.A. Minai L. Nachushtai R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 21-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The nuclear gene pet C encodes the Rieske [2Fe2S] protein, which binds an iron sulfur cluster. The chloroplast genes petA , petB, and petD encode three major subunits of the complex, i.e. cytochromef , cytochrome b 6, and subunit IV, respectively. Cytochrome b 6 binds two b hemes and cytochrome f a c-type heme. Subunit IV, as well as the three additional 3-kDa subunits (two chloroplast and one nuclear encoded), do not have cofactors. Maturation of cytochrome f has been studied in some detail (reviewed in Ref. 3Wollman F.A. Minai L. Nachushtai R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 21-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Before its assembly into cytochromeb 6 f complexes, cytochromef is inserted in the thylakoid membrane most likely by a co-translational process. It is converted from a pre-apoform into a mature holoform by two major maturation processes as follows: the cleavage of the transmembrane lumenal targeting domain, a N-terminal extension of the polypeptide sequence, and the ligation of the heme. Both processes occur at the lumen side of the membrane. Genetic approaches using combined conventional and site-directed mutagenesis ofC. reinhardtii have identified several nuclear-encoded factors and one chloroplast-encoded factor, which are required either for protein translocation (4Smith T.A. Kohnn B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or heme ligation (5Howe G. Merchant S.

Robinson C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3917-3921Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), cleaves the presequence of cytochromef right after a characteristic Ala-Gln-Ala motif. Tyrosine 32 thus becomes the N terminus of the mature protein (10Howe G. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5824-5832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Willey D.L. Gray J.C. Photosynth. Res. 1988; 17: 125-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Mature cytochrome f remains anchored in the membrane by its C-terminal α-helix (11Willey D.L. Gray J.C. Photosynth.

The three-dimensional structure of the soluble part of cytochrome f revealed that the free amino group of the N-terminal tyrosine of the mature protein acts as sixth ligand to the c heme (13Martinez S.E. Huang D. Szczepaniak A. Cramer W.A. Smith J.L. Structure. 1994; 2: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). This unexpected observation suggested that conversion of pre-apocytochrome f to holocytochromef requires cleavage of the transit peptide before heme ligation occurs. However, replacement of the cleavage site Ala-Gln-Ala by Leu-Gln-Leu allowed the precursor form of cytochrome f to covalently ligate a heme (2Kuras R. Büschlen S. Wollman F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27797-27803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This mutant, F29L-31L, was still able to assemble cytochrome b 6 f complexes that comprised the precursor form as well as some slowly processed cytochrome f forms, but the strain could not grow under phototrophic conditions. Another site-directed mutant, Y1P (1Zhou J. Fernandez-Velasco J.G. Malkin R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6225-6232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), originally claimed to be a substitution of the N-terminal tyrosine by a proline, aimed at preventing formation of the sixth ligand to the heme, was shown not to assemble cytochromeb 6 f complexes and therefore not to grow in phototrophic conditions. Further analysis of this mutant showed that the petA sequence bore an additional mutation that also altered the Cys-X -Y -Cys-His56critical c heme-binding motif, which is conserved in all c-type cytochromes; His56 was converted to phenylalanine. 2F. Zito and F.-A. Wollman, unpublished observations. Here we show that a bona fide Tyr32/Pro substitution does not prevent phototrophic growth although it alters the processing of cytochrome f . We provide a comparative functional analysis of the phototrophic F32P mutant and the non-phototrophic F29L-31L mutant, which are both altered in cytochrome f processing. The wild type strain of C. reinhardtii (mt+) derived from the strain 137C and the chloroplast transformants were grown on Tris/HCl acetate/phosphate (TAP) and minimum media, pH 7.2, at 25 °C under 6 and 60 μE m−2s−1 of continuous illumination, respectively.

Mutagenesis was carried out on plasmid piWF (14Kuras R. Wollman F.-A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) which encompasses the whole petA -coding region and its flanking sequences. Mutation of tyrosine 32 into proline was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis according to the method of Kunkel (15Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). Conversion of piWF to piF32P was obtained using the following mutagenic oligonucleotide:1CAGTAAGTCCAGCTCAGGCGCCTCCTGTATTTGCAC36. Amplification was performed in Escherichia coli, and screening of candidate colonies was carried out using the newly createdNar I restriction site. Plasmid piAF32P was constructed by introducing the Sma I-Eco RV fragment of plasmid pUC-atpX-AAD containing the 1.9-kilobase pair aadA cassette (16Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4083-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) in the same orientation as the petA gene in theEco RV site of plasmid piF32P. The wild type and FBE mutant, which harbors a deletion of the petA gene (2Kuras R. Büschlen S. Wollman F.A. J. Biol.

The particle gun was built in our laboratory by P. Bennoun and D. Béal and is operating under vacuum. At first we used piF32P to bombard the non-photosynthetic FBE strain, and phototrophic transformants were selected on minimum medium at 60 μE m−2 s−1. We then used plasmid piFA32P to bombard the wild type strain. Transformants were selected on TAP medium in the presence of 100 μg/ml spectinomycin for the expression of theaadA cassette. Membranes were prepared according to Chua and Bennoun (18Chua N.H. Bennoun P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Polypeptides were separated by denaturing SDS-PAGE in the Laemmli system (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar) using 12 and 12–18% acrylamide gels in the presence or absence of 8 m urea. Heme staining with TMBZ was performed according to Thomas et al. (21Thomas P.E. Ryan D. Levin W. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Immunoblots with specific antibodies against cytochromeb 6 f complex subunits were used for protein analyses (14Kuras R. Wollman F.-A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Whole cells, grown to a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml, were concentrated 10 times and labeled for 5 and 45 min with [14C]acetate at the final concentration of 5 μCi/ml in the presence of 8 μg/ml cycloheximide as described in Delepelaire (22Delepelaire P. Photobiochem. Photobiophys. 1983; 6: 279-291Google Scholar). The labeling reaction was stopped by addition of 1 volume of chilled 50 mm sodium acetate. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 100 mmdithiothreitol and 100 mm Na2CO3, and incubated in presence of 2% SDS at 100 °C for 1 min. Thylakoid membranes were solubilized in the presence of 25 mm hecameg (Vegatec, France) and loaded on a 10–35% sucrose gradient (23Pierre Y. Breyton C. Kramer D. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 49: 29342-29349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (147) Google Scholar). After centrifugation, fractions were collected and subjected to SDS-PAGE. DNA fragments coding for the mature and precursor forms of cytochromef were amplified with the following oligonucleotides:Cytf-3SK , 3′-CGCGAATTCGCTTACAAGTTCATTTCTGCTAATTGAA-5′;Cytf-matSK , 5′-CGCGGTACCAAAATTATGCCAGCTCAAGCTTTACCCTGTA-3′; Cytf-preSK , 5′-CGCGGTACCAAAATTATGTGTCTAACCAAGTA-3′, using the plasmid pdWF as a template (14Kuras R. Wollman F.-A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Letters underlined indicate the restriction site Kpn I in the oligonucleotideCytf-3SK and the restriction site Eco RI inCytf-matSK and Cytf-preSK . The fragments corresponding to the coding sequence of the mature and precursor protein were cloned in the pBSK plasmid and cut with Kpn I and Eco RI, thus leading to plasmids pFmatSK and pFpreSK, respectively. These two plasmids were used as templates to performin vitro transcription using the Promega Kit, according to the manufacturer's protocol. The resulting RNAs were translated in wheat germ system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the presence of [35S]methionine (24Minai L. Cohen Y. Chitnis P.R. Nechushtai R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Membranes were prepared from a double mutant without PSII (obtained by crossing our mutants with the PSII-less mutant strain F35 (25Girard-Bascou J. Pierre Y. Drapier D. Curr.

The membrane pellet was resuspended in 1 volume of 0.1 m MOPS buffer, pH 7, 0.1 mm KCl, in the presence of a mixture of 12 mediators (Table I) at a concentration of 2 10−4m each. Final concentration of mediators was 10−4m. This solution was incubated for 30 min on ice before filling of the electrochemical cell (26Moss D.A. Nabedryk E. Breton J. Mäntele W. Eur. J.

The gold mesh, which was used as a working electrode in the cell, was modified with pyridine-3-carboxaldehydethiosemicarbazone in order to avoid irreversible protein adhesion. Experiments were done at 12 °C. Titrations in steps of 30 mV were performed in the oxidative and the reductive directions in the potential range from +450 to −500 mV.

The resuspended algae were oxygenated at low light for 1 h by intense shaking before the start of the experiment. 10−5m DCMU and 10−3m HA were added to inhibit photosystem II (31Bennoun P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 216: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The algae were kept in anaerobiosis under a stream of argon in the cuvette. FCCP was added at a concentration of 0.5–2 × 10−6 to collapse the permanent transmembrane electrochemical potential. Electron transfer reactions were triggered by an actinic flash from a Xenon lamp, filtered by a dark red filter (RG695). Each flash excited about 20% of PSI centers. The interval between actinic flashes was 8 s in our experiments. Continuous light was used at an intensity of one photon every 2 ms. EPR spectra were recorded on membrane fragments of mutants and wild type using an EPS 300 X-band spectrometer fitted with an Oxford Instruments He-cryostat and a temperature control system. Since the membranes were oxidized upon preparation, reduction of cytochrome f and the Rieske protein was achieved by washing the samples with 5 mm ascorbate. 20 μm dithionite was added in order to reduce the plastoquinone pool. Washing with 2 mm ferricyanide oxidized all redox centers of the b 6 f complex. EPR redox titrations were performed according to Dutton (32Dutton P.L. FEBS Lett. 1971; 65: 117-119Google Scholar) using the mediator combination indicated in Table I at a concentration of 10−4m. For the study of oriented samples either in their oxidized state or in their reduced state when exposed to 5 mm ascorbate, membranes were washed twice with distilled water. Resuspended membranes were applied on Mylar sheets and dried in a humidity-controlled atmosphere under argon for several days (33Rutherford A.W. Sétif P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1019: 128-132Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were performed with a home-built fluorimeter. The continuous actinic light, provided by electroluminescent diodes, was set at 590 nm and at an intensity of 60 μE s−2 m−2. Fluorescence was measured at right angles with photodiodes UV444B.F max levels were determined in the presence of 10−5m DCMU. We have analyzed the cytochrome f content in two site-directed petA mutants aimed at altering the conversion of pre-apocytochrome f to holocytochrome f . F32P has a proline at the place of the N-terminal tyrosine 32 which serves as the sixth ligand to the c heme. Proline is the only amino acid unable to serve as a ligand to the heme due to the absence of anN-terminal amino group. Tyrosine 32 is situated immediately downstream of the recognition site for the TPP. After polypeptide separation by SDS-PAGE, both with and without urea, three forms of cytochrome f were observed in F32P (Fig. 1, A and B ). These should be compared with the mature form present in the wild type and with absence of a cytochrome f band in a strain deleted for the petA gene. We rule out that the three bands may reflect different states of denaturation of the same protein since we found the same triplet of bands under stronger denaturing conditions, i.e. 0.5% instead of 0.1% SDS in the running buffer (data not shown). The three forms were found at the same positions as those previously reported for F29L-31L, which bears a Leu-Gln-Leu motif instead of the regular Ala-Gln-Ala motif, thereby hampering the action of TPP (2Kuras R. Büschlen S. Wollman F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27797-27803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The three forms of cytochromef , which were detected with a specific antibody (Fig. 1,A and B ), were also detected by TMBZ staining which identifies mainly heme-containing polypeptides (Fig.1 C ). Thus, the three forms of cytochrome f in F32P are heme-binding polypeptides in agreement with our previous report of F29L-31L (2Kuras R. Büschlen S. Wollman F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27797-27803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The steady state proportions of the three forms of cytochromef differed between the two mutants. In F29L-31L the lower band was the most abundant (2Kuras R. Büschlen S. Wollman F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27797-27803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), whereas in F32P the lower form is the less represented when algae were grown heterotrophically. However, when F32P was grown under phototrophic conditions, the shortest form of cytochrome f became the prominent form (data not shown). In order to compare the migration positions of the three bands of mutated cytochrome f with the precursor and mature apoforms of wild type cytochrome f , the latter were expressed in vitro and radiolabeled with [35S]methionine using cloned petA genes containing or not the presequence of cytochrome f (see “Materials and Methods”). The electrophoretic migration positions of the precursor and mature polypeptide were compared with those of cytochrome f as detected upon 5- and 45-min pulse labeling with [14C]acetate of cells from the wild type, F32P, F29L-31L, and Y1P (Fig. 2,A–C ). The mature form of cytochrome f expressedin vitro (Fig. 2 C ) migrated at a position similar to that of cytochrome f expressed in vivo in the wild type. The precursor form of cytochrome f , as detected when expressed in vitro , migrated at a position higher than the mature form. In 5-min pulses, F32P and F29L-31L displayed a cytochrome f doublet (1 and 1* in Fig.2) at this position. The lower band (* in Fig. 2,A and C ) was absent in 45-min pulses of the wild type, F32P, and F29L-31L. As we had shown previously for F29L-31L (2Kuras R. Büschlen S. Wollman F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27797-27803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), pre-apocytochrome f is converted within a few minutes in some holoform. Thus we assigned band 1* to pre-apocytochromef and band 1, the upper band of the doublet, to pre-holocytochrome f . Consistent with this latter attribution, pre-holocytochrome f was long-lived enough to be detected in 45-min pulses (Fig. 2 B ) as well as by conventional detection procedures (upper band of the triplet in Fig. 1). Additionally, two forms of lower apparent molecular weight appeared in 45-min pulses with the mutants. Their electrophoretic migration positions corresponded to that of the two lower bands observed by conventional detection procedures (Fig. 1). The lower of these two bands migrated at a position similar to that of mature cytochrome f (Fig. 2, A and B ). Y1P is unable to bind heme, due to the absence of His56, the fifth ligand of the c heme.2 Therefore, pre-apocytochrome f (band 1 *) appeared in Y1P in 5-min pulses and was retained in 45-min pulses, because of its inability to undergo an apo- to holoconversion. The steady state accumulation of one precursor and several processed forms of cytochrome f raised the question of their actual assembly into cytochromeb 6 f complexes. To answer this point, thylakoid membranes from F32P were solubilized according to Pierreet al. (23Pierre Y. Breyton C. Kramer D. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 49: 29342-29349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 34Pierre Y. Breyton C. Lemoine Y. Robert B. Vernotte C. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21901-21908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and cytochromeb 6 f complexes were recovered from the supernatant upon sucrose gradient centrifugation. The three forms of cytochrome f were found in the gradient fractions that also contained cytochrome b 6 (Fig.3). Thus the precursor as well as the processed forms of cytochrome f assembled into cytochromeb 6 f complexes. In addition these protein complexes showed a bimodal distribution along the sucrose gradient. The population of mutated protein complexes of lower buoyant density was enriched in the processed forms of cytochrome f and migrated at the same position as the genuine dimeric cytochromeb 6 f complex from the wild type (23Pierre Y. Breyton C. Kramer D. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 49: 29342-29349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we noted that the two upper bands of cytochromef were enriched in the protein complexes of higher buoyant density. In this respect, cytochromeb 6 f complexes from F32P exhibited the same biochemical properties as those from F29L-31L characterized previously (2Kuras R. Büschlen S. Wollman F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27797-27803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus the precursor forms are specifically enriched in a new population of protein complexes of higher buoyant density. In an attempt to identify the basis for the ability of F32P to grow in phototrophic conditions, a property that is not shared by F29L-31l, we performed an extensive functional characterization of the two mutants by time-resolved fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy, electrochemical redox titrations, and EPR. Fig. 4 shows the patterns of fluorescence induction at room temperature of dark-adapted cells from the various strains upon continuous illumination (60 μE m−2 s−1). Addition of DCMU prevents re-oxidation of the primary PSII quinone acceptor and leads to maximal fluorescence yield (F max). The difference between the steady state level of fluorescence with no inhibitor added (F stat) and the F maxlevel is a relative measure of the linear electron flow (LEF); the smaller the difference, the less re-oxidation of the PSII acceptor by the downstream electron transport chain occurs. It is immediately apparent that F29L-31L (upper right side ) resembles a mutant lacking the cytochrome b 6 f complex (lower right side ); both reached theF max level in the absence of DCMU but with slower kinetics than in the presence of the inhibitor. This is indicative of a complete block in the re-oxidation of the plastoquinone pool. In contrast, the F stat level was lower than the F max level in F32P (lower left side ), but this difference was smaller than in the wild type, which is indicative of a lower efficiency of plastoquinol re-oxidation. Table II shows a quantification of this LEF index for the four strains shown in Fig. 4. Also shown in Table IIis the quenching at F max observed when the cells were transferred from the conditions used in Fig. 4, i.e. strongly oxygenated by vigorous stirring in the darkness, to anaerobic conditions. This switch promotes transition from state I to state II in the wild type, with a typical quenching at F maxof about 40–50% (35Wollman F.A. Delepelaire P. J.

https://openalex.org/W2154436814,"Aggregation of FceRI on mast cells results in the phosphorylation of the FceRIγ chain on tyrosine and threonine residues within the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif. In the present study we sought to identify the site of threonine phosphorylation in FceRIγ and investigate its functional importance. We found that threonine 60 was phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo . Expression of a mutated FceRIγ (T60A), in either FceRIγ-deficient or γ-null mast cells, resulted in a delay of FceRI endocytosis, inhibition of TNF-α mRNA production, and inhibition of degranulation but did not affect FceRI-induced cell adhesion. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the T60A mutant γ chain was normal, but Syk phosphorylation was dramatically reduced in these transfectants. This correlated with reduced co-immunoprecipitation of FceRIγ with Syk. Substitution of an aspartic residue for threonine 60 of the FceRIγ reconstituted complete activation of Syk and co-immunoprecipitation of FceRIγ with Syk. We conclude that the negative charge provided by phosphorylation of threonine 60 of the FceRIγ is required for the appropriate interaction and activation of Syk. This is a likely requirement for immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs involved in Syk activation."

Hata Y. Wakagi T. Tanaka N. Oshima T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 834-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This isolated center is buried within the molecule and connects the two FeS cores and the N-terminal extension region. The moderately thermoacidophilic euryarchaeote, Thermoplasma acidophilum , represents one of the longest evolutionary lineages, within the euryarchaeota, of the archaeal domain, and uniquely lacks the S-layer (2Olsen G.J.

Unlike methanogenic euryarchaeotes, it is a facultative aerobic thermoacidophile that grows optimally at pH 1–2 and 56–59 °C. Several new isolates of T. acidophilum have been obtained from hot sulfur springs at the Ohwakudani solfataric field in Hakone, Japan, and marked morphological variations among different isolates were recognized (20Yasuda M. Oyaizu H. Yamagishi A. Oshima T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 3482-3485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the energy metabolism of this euryarchaeote has not been studied in detail, preliminary studies have suggested that T. acidophilum contains at least two major redox systems, one being the cytosolic ferredoxin-dependent redox system for saccharolytic and peptide fermentation (8Kerscher L.

Oesterhelt D. Eur. J.

The amino acid sequence of this ferredoxin was previously determined by Edman degradation of proteolytically generated peptides (10Wakabayashi S. Fujimoto N. Wada K. Matsubara H. Kerscher L.

Yamagishi A. Oshima T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 3482-3485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Through chemical analysis, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and low temperature resonance Raman spectroscopy, it was demonstrated that the ferredoxin contains one [3Fe-4S]1+,0 cluster, one [4Fe-4S]2+,1+cluster, and one tightly bound zinc center (14Iwasaki T.

The resultant PCR product with expected length (∼370 bp) was amplified, subcloned into pGEMT vector, and sequenced with the vector-specific T7 and SP6 primers. PCR was then performed using a set of the TFP1/TFP2 and SP6/T7 primers, on a template genomic library generated by the ligation ofBam HI-digested T. acidophilum genomic DNA and pGEM3Zf(+). The resultant PCR products were size-fractionated on an agarose gel, extracted, subcloned into pGEMT vectors, and sequenced with primers designed from nucleotide sequence of the initial genomic PCR product. Finally, a genomic fragment was amplified using PCR primers corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions resulting in an intact zfx gene. The sequence determination was performed by Sanger dideoxy sequencing with an automated DNA sequencer, ABI model 373A (Applied Biosystems Inc.). The DNA sequence was processed using the DNASIS version 3.6 software (Hitachi Software Engineering Co., Ltd.). Data base searches were performed with BEAUTY and BLAST network services (25Worley K.C.

Purified zinc-containing ferredoxins in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, were concentrated by pressure filtration with an Amicon YM-3 membrane. Further concentration was achieved by placing the samples under a stream of dry nitrogen gas. The resultant samples (∼2–3 mm), containing 30% (v/v) glycerol, were frozen in a 24 × 3 × 2-mm polycarbonate cuvette with a Mylar-tape front window for XAS studies. XAS data were collected at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) with the SPEAR storage ring operating in a dedicated mode at 3.0 GeV (Table I).

Open table in a new tab Absorption spectra were recorded with a Hitachi U-3210 spectrophotometer equipped with a thermoelectric cell holder. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry of purified apoferredoxin (made in distilled water) was performed by a Finnigan MAT VISION 2000 instrument at an accelerating potential of 5.0 kV, using a 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix. EPR measurements were performed using a JEOL JEX-RE1X spectrometer equipped with an Air Products model LTR-3 Heli-Tran cryostat system and a Scientific Instruments series 5500 temperature indicator/controller. The spectral data were processed using KaleidaGraph version 3.05 (Abelbeck Software). Thezfx gene utilizes a translational start codon, GTG (positions 121–123, Fig. 1), and the corresponding valine residue is absent in zinc-containing ferredoxin isolated from the T. acidophilum HO-62 cells (Fig. 1), indicating post-translational modification. The single open reading frame encodes a protein with a deduced molecular mass of 15,955 Da (excluding the initial residue), which is in agreement with the average mass [M + H]1+ of 15,961 Da (estimated error, ± 10 Da) for purified apoferredoxin by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Thezfx gene sequence predicts an amino acid sequence containing the three consensus histidine residues, His30, His33, and His57, and a remote Asp116 (doubly-underlined in Fig.1 A ). The equivalent residues in Sulfolobus sp. ferredoxin (Fig. 2) serve as ligands to the isolated zinc center (14Iwasaki T. Suzuki T. Kon T. Imai T. Urushiyama A. Ohmori D. Oshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3453-3458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence is essentially identical to the reported sequence of T. acidophilum DSM 1728 ferredoxin determined by Edman degradation of proteolytically generated peptides (accession number P00218) (10Wakabayashi S. Fujimoto N. Wada K. Matsubara H. Kerscher L. Oesterhelt D. FEBS Lett. 1983; 162: 21-24Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The two discrepancies, Glul0l and Ala105, located in the central loop region (underlined residues in Fig. 1), most likely reflects the difference in strains used (strain HO-62 versus DSM 1728).Figure 2Multiple amino acid sequence alignments of selected bacterial-type ferredoxins of Archaea and Bacteria.Conserved amino acid residues (shaded ) and potential ligand residues to the isolated zinc center in archaeal zinc-containing ferredoxins (open circles ) are shown.

Apparently, the zfx gene of T. acidophilum strain HO-62 does not have an operonic structure. Two other open reading frames were found shortly after thezfx gene (Fig. 1).

The importance of the addition of oxygen to lipids has been recognized in literature, paint technology, the food industry, and the biochemistry of lipid messengers, both within and between cells. Biological systems developed enzymatic processes to generate specific oxidized lipids, but even so, the spectrum of compounds is remarkably broad. Why focus on lipids? After all, other molecules also are oxidized. First, it seems likely that oxidation of lipids precedes that of other biomolecules, at least in the usual in vivo settings. Second, oxidized lipids have in some cases been adopted as regulated second messengers and as such serve the needs of the organism, unlike oxidized proteins, for example, which are destined for destruction. Why are lipids such good candidates for oxidation? Many biologically relevant oxidants prefer a hydrophobic environment, which results in their concentration in membranes. This also brings them into close proximity to the olefinic bonds in the unsaturated fatty acids, which also are in high concentration in membranes, an almost two-dimensional world. Studies of prostaglandins yielded the first detailed structural and mechanistic insights into such pathways, and the number of products exceeds several score. Prostaglandins derive from arachidonic acid (and close relatives) in a reaction catalyzed by cyclooxygenase (or, more accurately, prostaglandin G/H synthase). Research in this area is a growth industry as the isoforms (two now are recognized) are the culprits in inflammation and cancer and are the targets for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In the first article of this series Marnett and co-authors review the structure and function of these isoenzymes in “Arachidonic Acid Oxygenation by COX-1 and COX-2: Mechanisms of Catalysis and Inhibition.” Alan R. Brash follows in the second article of the series with an analysis of another family of oxidases, lipoxygenase, whose members also target arachidonic acid although not as selectively as cyclooxygenase (“Lipoxygenase: Occurrence, Functions, Catalysis, and Acquisition of Substrate”). Some of the lipoxygenases have the interesting property of being able to use as a substrate arachidonic acid (or other polyunsaturated fatty acids) that remains esterified at the sn -2 position of the glycerol backbone in phospholipids; this contrasts with cyclooxygenase, which recognizes only the free fatty acid. John A. Lawson, Joshua Rokach, and Garret A. FitzGerald continue the theme with the third article of the series, “Isoprostanes: Formation, Analysis, and Use as Indices of Lipid Peroxidation in Vivo ,” which explores the nonenzymatic generation of another family derived from arachidonic acid, the isoprostanes. These are such close relatives of the prostaglandins that they exert their actions by capturing the receptors for prostaglandins. The key difference is that the lack of enzymatic controls allows excessive amounts of these products to accumulate and provoke (patho)physiological responses. The generation of isoprostanes begins with a free radical-catalyzed attack on esterified arachidonate, and the release from the complex lipid follows; this is the inverse sequence of the prostaglandin synthetic pathway but the same as presumably happens with the lipoxygenase reactions mentioned above. From a medical perspective, this mechanism presents challenges because it circumvents the therapeutic effects of anti-inflammatory drugs. This may be a situation in which antioxidant therapy would be ideal, and the recent detailed structural studies provide new assays for assessing the efficacy of such approaches. The same initial process (peroxidation of arachidonate esterified in phospholipids) also can yield another family of lipid mediators, phospholipids that mimic platelet-activating factor. This is strictly analogous to the isoprostane-prostaglandin relationship in that the free radical-catalyzed process yields a product that is structurally similar to the enzymatically generated one and the receptor is usurped. In this case, the oxidation process proceeds to heterolytic cleavage of the acyl chain, rather than release of the peroxidized fatty acid, and the bioactivity resides in the unusual phospholipid product. As with the isoprostanes, the risk is that excessive amounts will be generated, for example by exposure to cigarette smoke, and lead to a pathological result. This process is reviewed by Thomas M. McIntyre, Guy A. Zimmerman, and myself in “Biologically Active Oxidized Phospholipids,” the fourth article in the series. The final article in the series addresses an area of lipid oxidation that has received the most attention in studies of a disease mechanism, the alteration of low density lipoprotein (LDL). In experimental and clinical studies of atherosclerosis it has been shown that LDL undergoes modifications that result in marked changes in its physicochemical properties and that these changes make the particle a much more effective inducer of pathological events. One of the changes, and perhaps the earliest, is oxidation of various lipids in LDL; this process and its potential role in early stages of atherogenesis are reviewed by Guy M. Chisolm III and co-authors in “The Oxidation of Lipoproteins by Monocyte-Macrophages: Biochemical and Biological Mechanisms.”"
