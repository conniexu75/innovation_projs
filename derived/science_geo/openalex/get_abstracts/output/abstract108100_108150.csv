https://openalex.org/W1605718906,"Sequencing of two internal peptides from the putative human endothelial cell tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) receptor identified an analog of the calcium- and phospholipid-binding protein, annexin II (Ann-II). The polymerase chain reaction-derived, full-length cDNA revealed complete sequence identity with the heavy chain of Ann-II, and ligand-precipitated receptor protein immunoreacted specifically with a monoclonal antibody to Ann-II. Transfected 293 cells bound plasminogen (Kd = 114 nM; Bmax = 347,000) as well as t-PA (Kd = 48 nM; Bmax = 380,000). Antisense oligonucleotides directed against endothelial cell Ann-II mRNA inhibited binding of both t-PA and plasminogen by 49% and 38%, respectively. The K307T mutant of Ann-II expressed on 293 cells failed to bind plasminogen, while the K328I mutant bound this ligand in a manner equivalent to the wild-type. Binding of plasminogen to both the wild-type and the K328I mutant was blocked by pretreatment of 293 cells with carboxypeptidase B. These data suggest a novel mechanism whereby a plasmin-like serine protease may cleave Ann-II at Lys307-Arg308, exposing a new carboxyl-terminal lysine residue (Lys307) for binding and efficient activation of plasminogen."
https://openalex.org/W1586576093,"In the preceding paper (Hajjar, K. A., Jacovina, A. T., and Chacko, J. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 21191-21197), we identified a M(r) = 40,000 endothelial cell receptor for tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen (PLG) as the calcium- and phospholipid-binding protein, annexin II (Ann-II). Here, we examined the effect of Ann-II on t-PA-dependent plasminogen activation in a purified system. Purified native Ann-II bound t-PA, plasminogen, and plasmin with high affinity (Kd = 25 nM, 161 nM, and 75 nM, respectively). At fixed plasminogen concentrations, preincubation with purified native Ann-II was associated with an approximately 21-fold increase in the rate of Glu-PLG activation and an approximately 14-fold increase in activation of Lys-PLG. Three irrelevant proteins had no effect on plasmin formation, while fibrinogen increased the rate of Glu-PLG activation by approximately 4-fold. Annexin-II-mediated enhancement of t-PA-dependent plasminogen activation was 90-95% inhibited by epsilon-aminocaproic acid or by pretreatment of Ann-II with carboxypeptidase B, indicating a carboxyl-terminal lysine-dependent interaction. Kinetic analyses revealed that Ann-II conferred an approximately 60-fold increase in catalytic efficiency upon t-PA-dependent activation of either Glu-PLG or Lys-PLG. Thus, Ann-II-mediated assembly of plasminogen and t-PA may promote and localize constitutive plasmin generation on the surface of the blood vessel wall."
https://openalex.org/W1577069180,"Alzheimer's disease is typified by the characteristic histopathological lesions of neurofibrillar plaques and tangles. The latter are composed of paired helical filaments (PHFs), the major components of which are modified forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau. The exact nature of these modifications remains unknown, although the presence of hyperphosphorylated tau in PHFs argues strongly that phosphorylation is one of the modifications that result in the polymerization of tau into PHFs. However, hyperphosphorylation alone is insufficient to explain the formation of PHFs. In an attempt to characterize other post-translational modifications of PHF-tau, we have analyzed its glycation. A fraction of PHF-tau seems to be glycated in vivo, whereas soluble tau from either Alzheimer's disease or non-demented human brain is not glycated at all. Purified tau from bovine brain can be efficiently glycated in vitro. Tau glycation is accompanied by a decrease in the tau binding to tubulin. These results support the view that glycation may be one of the modifications hampering the binding of tau to tubulin in Alzheimer's disease, thus facilitating tau aggregation into PHFs."
https://openalex.org/W1566025256,"To explore the role of the protein tyrosine phosphatase Syp in insulin signaling, a catalytically inert mutant Syp protein was expressed under an inducible promoter in cells transfected with the human insulin receptor. Expression of the mutant phosphatase significantly reduced the stimulation of mitogenesis by insulin, indicating that the mutation produced a dominant negative phenotype. Tyrosine phosphorylation of both the insulin receptor and its major substrates, Shc and insulin receptor substrate-1, were unaffected by the mutant phosphatase. However, both the insulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase were markedly attenuated. Expression of the mutant phosphatase allowed the detection of a 120-kDa protein phosphorylated in response to insulin that associated with the src homology (SH) 2 domains of the phosphatase, suggesting a possible regulatory role for this protein. These results indicate that the activity of Syp plays a critical part in the mitogenic actions of insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1522000230,"Incubation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Glu-6-PDH) from Leuconostoc mesenteroides with the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal leads to the formation of cross-linked protein. This is accompanied by the appearance of protein-associated fluorescence with excitation and emission maxima of 340 and 415 nm, respectively, and with the disappearance of histidine and lysine residues. Cross-linked protein is less susceptible than native Glu-6-PDH to proteolysis by the multicatalytic protease, a multienzymic proteolytic complex involved in the intracellular degradation of damaged proteins. In addition, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-modified Glu-6-PDH inhibits the multicatalytic protease and can therefore prevent the efficient degradation of oxidized protein. These findings may have important implications for the accumulation of altered protein and fluorescent material in vivo, processes that are believed to be involved in age- and disease-related impairment of cellular function."
https://openalex.org/W1570667389,"Syp (SH-PTP2) was recently identified as a phosphotyrosine phosphatase containing two SH2 domains within its primary structure. In response to appropriate growth factor stimulation, Syp becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and associates with insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and/or the corresponding growth factor receptor via its SH2 domains, leading to increased Syp activity. To assess the importance of Syp in mitogenic signaling, we microinjected mammalian fibroblasts with several reagents designed to interfere with Syp SH2/phosphotyrosine interaction in vivo. Insulin-, insulin-like growth factor-1-, and epidermal growth factor-stimulated DNA synthesis, indicated by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation, was dramatically decreased following microinjection of a Syp antibody (Ab) (65-85%) or a Syp GST-SH2 fusion protein (approximately 90%) in comparison with cells microinjected with control IgG or glutathione S-transferase (GST), respectively. In addition, microinjection of an IRS-1-derived phosphonopeptide, which inhibits in vitro binding of Syp-SH2 to IRS-1 with an ED50 value of approximately 23 microM, also decreased BrdUrd incorporation in vivo by approximately 50-75%. Microinjection of the Syp Ab, Syp GST-SH2 fusion protein, or the phosphonopeptide had no effect on serum-stimulated BrdUrd incorporation. In conclusion, disruption of Syp function in living cells inhibited cell cycle progression in response to growth factor stimulation, indicating that Syp is a critical positive regulator of mitogenic signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1481199079,"Monocytes/macrophages are associated with chronic inflammatory lesions, such as periodontal disease and rheumatoid arthritis, in which there is extensive connective tissue destruction. Stimulation of human monocytes results in the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) via a prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-cAMP-dependent pathway. Modulation of many monocyte functions by interleukin 10 (IL-10) suggested that this cytokine may influence the signal transduction pathway leading to the production of MMPs by monocytes. Pre-incubation of monocytes with IL-10 for 1 h prior to stimulation with ConA resulted in significant inhibition of prostaglandin H synthase-2 (PGHS-2, the inducible form of prostaglandin synthase). In contrast, PGHS-1, the constitutive PGHS, was not affected by IL-10. Suppression of PGHS-2 mRNA and protein levels was detected at 1 ng/ml of IL-10 with maximal inhibition at 20 ng/ml. Nuclear run-on transcription assays performed on monocytes exposed to ConA or the combination of ConA and IL-10 indicated that IL-10 treatment suppressed PGHS-2 expression at the level of transcription. Attenuation of PGHS-2 by IL-10 was accompanied by decreased prostaglandin production, including PGE2. The decrease in prostaglandin production was primarily related to the effect of IL-10 on PGHS-2, since the release of arachidonic acid was unaffected by this cytokine. The inhibition of PGE2 production by IL-10 resulted in the suppression of mRNA and protein for interstitial collagenase and 92-kDa type IV collagenase/gelatinase (gelatinase B). This conclusion is supported by the ability of exogenously added PGE2 or dibutyryl cAMP to restore the production of MMPs in IL-10-treated monocytes. Additionally, PGHS-2 was also restored by PGE2 or dibutyryl cAMP, indicating that PGHS-2 is regulated through a PGE2-cAMP amplification pathway. These data add further support to the anti-inflammatory properties of IL-10."
https://openalex.org/W1538268336,"A novel arginine-specific cysteine proteinase, termed argingipain, was purified from culture supernatants of Porphyromonas gingivalis, an anaerobe commonly associated with progressive periodontal disease, by conventional chromatographic techniques. The purified enzyme was found to be composed of a single polypeptide of M(r) approximately 44,000. Analysis of the enzymatic properties revealed several distinctive features for this enzyme. The proteolytic activity is absolutely thiol-dependent, but the enzyme also has in part the characteristics of both metallo and serine endopeptidases, as shown by the inhibition of activity by metal chelators, chymostatin, and the chloromethyl ketones of tosyl-L-lysine and tosyl-L-phenylalanine. However, internal protease inhibitors, such as cystatins, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, have no effects on the activity, suggesting its evasion from normal host defense systems in vivo. Despite its narrow specificity for synthetic substrates containing Arg in the P1 site and hydrophobic amino acids in the P2 or P3 sites, the enzyme extensively degrades collagens (types I and IV) and immunoglobulin G. Most important, the enzyme has the ability to disrupt the functions of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, as shown by its inhibitory effect on the generation of active oxygen species from the activated cells. Further, the enzyme is found to be produced by all of the species of P. gingivalis examined, but not by other bacteria. These results suggests that argingipain plays a key role as a major virulence factor from P. gingivalis in the development of periodontal disease via the direct destruction of periodontal tissue components and the disruption of normal host defense mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1494453455,"Sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP2; also called nonspecific lipid transfer protein) is a small basic sterol carrier and lipid transfer protein assumed to participate in the intracellular transport of sterols and certain other lipids. Upon cloning and sequencing SCP2-encoding cDNAs, we and others found cDNAs containing unexpected in-frame 5'-extensions of up to 1,250 nucleotides upstream of the initiator ATG of the cDNA encoding pre-SCP2. The corresponding transcripts are primarily expressed in the liver and are predicted to encode a previously undescribed fusion protein containing a 143-amino acid C-terminal domain completely identical to pre-SCP2 and a 404-amino acid N-terminal domain with unknown biochemical activity or function (named sterol carrier protein x, SCPx). Here, we show that purified recombinant SCPx cleaves 3-oxoacyl(n)-CoA to yield acetyl-CoA and acyl(n-2)-CoA. Like SCP2, recombinant SCPx also stimulates the microsomal conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol and transfers phosphatidylcholine and 7-dehydrocholesterol from small unilamellar vesicles to acceptor membranes in vitro. Furthermore, SCPx epitopes are primarily detected within peroxisomes. These findings suggest that SCPx is a previously undescribed peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (EC 2.3.1.16) with intrinsic sterol carrier and lipid transfer activity (suggested name: SCP2/3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase)."
https://openalex.org/W1602411554,"Glucose metabolism and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion are thought to be controlled at the level of glucose phosphorylation in pancreatic islet beta-cells. In the current study we have investigated the importance of glucose phosphorylation by using recombinant adenovirus as a gene delivery system for isolated rat islets. Treatment of islets with a virus containing the cDNA encoding the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase gene (AdCMV-beta GAL) resulted in efficiencies of gene transfer of 70.3 +/- 2.5 and 61.2 +/- 2.2% in two independent experiments. Treatment of islets with a virus containing the cDNA encoding rat hexokinase I (AdCMV-HKI) resulted in a 10.7-fold increase in immunodetectable hexokinase protein and a similar increase in enzyme activity. A large percentage of the overexpressed hexokinase activity was associated with a cell fraction enriched in mitochondria. These changes in enzyme level were accompanied by a 2-fold increase in insulin release and [5-3H]glucose usage at basal glucose concentrations (3 mM). The rate of glucose usage at 20 mM glucose and the magnitude of the insulin secretory response to this stimulatory level of the sugar were unchanged relative to control islets. Overexpression of hexokinase I in isolated islets therefore creates a phenotype of elevated basal insulin release similar to that seen in islets from obese and insulin-resistant mammals. The discrepancy between the large increase in hexokinase activity and the small increase in glucose usage and insulin release may indicate, however, that other steps in glucose metabolism become rate-limiting after only modest increases in glucose-phosphorylating activity."
https://openalex.org/W1576145712,"Receptors for a variety of hematopoietins, interferons alpha/beta and gamma, and growth hormone have recently been shown to mediate rapid, ligand-dependent activation of the Janus-type cytosolic protein-tyrosine kinases Jak1, Jak2, and/or tyk-2. This finding extends relatedness among class I and II cytokine receptors to a functional context and provides an initially satisfying mechanistic analogy to protein-tyrosine kinase-encoding receptors of the epidermal growth factor/platelet-derived growth factor/insulin family. Through the construction and expression of a kinase-deficient form of Jak2 (JK2 delta VIII) in interleukin-3 (IL-3)/erythropoietin (Epo)-dependent DAER cells, we have tested whether activation of Jak2 is required for induced mitogenesis via these class I cytokine receptors. Ectopic expression of JK2 delta VIII inhibited Epo- and IL-3-induced activation of endogenous wild-type Jak2, transiently attenuated IL-3-dependent growth, and essentially abrogated Epo-induced proliferation in this model system. These dominant-negative effects provide the first direct experimental evidence for an essential role for Janus kinase activation in mitogenesis and suggest that distinct effectors may mediate IL-3-induced versus Epo-induced pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1491520169,"Abnormal expression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors has been observed in malignant glioma and other tumors such as osteosarcomas and malignant melanomas. However, their role in the development and maintenance of the tumors is not understood. Signaling through the PDGF receptors is activated by ligand-induced dimerization. Thus, introduction of mutant receptors that are kinase deficient but still dimerization competent is one strategy to study the importance of PDGF receptors in glioma cell growth. A truncated PDGF-beta receptor was introduced into C6 rat glioma cells and the PDGF-mediated signaling and subsequent cell growth studied. In clones expressing the mutant receptor, PDGF-BB-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the endogenous receptor was significantly reduced. In addition, these cells grew to lower density in culture and formed smaller colonies in soft agar than the C6 parental cells. Furthermore, the ability of cells expressing the truncated receptor to grow as xenografts in nude mice was significantly impaired. These results support the important role for the PDGF-beta receptor in C6 glioma cell growth. They also demonstrate the usefulness of dominant-negative mutants of the PDGF receptor for the evaluation of the role of the receptor in tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1502945164,"We have previously shown that the growth hormone (GH) receptor-binding protein is associated with the nucleus. We show here both by electron microscopy and nuclear isolation that GH is subject to rapid nuclear translocation. The intracellular fate of intravenously injected 125I-bovine growth hormone (bGH) was examined in the rat hepatocyte by electron microscopic autoradiography. The hormone appeared rapidly at the plasma membrane, then sequentially in lysosomal and multivesicular bodies and/or the nuclear membrane before final translocation to the nuclear matrix. Maximal translocation to the nuclear matrix occurred within 30 min of injection. Nuclear translocation of 125I-hGH was also studied by isolation of nuclei from cells stably transfected with cDNAs encoding the GH receptor, GH-binding protein, and a membrane bound but cytoplasmic domain-deficient receptor. Specific internalization and nuclear translocation of hormone only occurred in cells transfected with the full-length receptor. The translocation was rapid and became saturated within 1 h after addition of hormone to the culture media. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of isolated nuclei showed that GH is transported to the nucleus as the intact molecule. Pretreatment of cells with lysosomotropic agents (chloroquine, ammonium chloride, and bacitracin) decreased hormone degradation and increased nuclear translocation of GH. The nuclear translocation of GH was achieved independent of the cytoskeletal system (microtubular, microfilament, and intermediate filament networks). Thus, GH is subject to rapid receptor-dependent nuclear translocation via the endosomal pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1523717189,"Intrinsic DNA curvature has previously been implicated in the condensation of satellite DNA in chromatin. In this article, electrophoretic methods and computer programs for predicting DNA structure from nucleotide sequence were used to determine if curvature is a conserved feature of satellite DNA. The results revealed that satellite sequences display wide variation in magnitude of intrinsic bending. Less than half of the satellites examined were strongly bent when compared with control DNA. However, a conserved pattern of bending was seen in all 57 satellite sequences that were studied. The pattern consisted of repeating units of two 50-60-base pair bending elements which were separated by a 20-30-base pair region of low curvature. This pattern resembles qualitatively the bending of DNA in the nucleosome where the helix is folded approximately two turns around the histone octomer with the turns interrupted by a less bent segment in the center of the particle. The distance between successive pairs of bending elements was also similar to the average spacing of nucleosomes in chromatin. Thus, the conserved structures could play some role in the positioning of nucleosomes along satellite chromatin. In order to strengthen the correlation between DNA structure and nucleosome positioning, sequences were examined which have been shown to position nucleosomes at single major sites. This analysis revealed a conserved pattern of DNA structure resembling the two peak units seen in satellites. In addition, the nucleotide sequence patterns responsible for the conserved patterns of bending were similar in both satellite and nucleosome positioning DNA. Likewise, nucleotide sequence patterns that are thought to direct the rotational orientation of DNA in the nucleosome were similar in both sequence sets. These results are considered in terms of a general model for the role of DNA bending and nucleotide sequence in the control of nucleosome positioning and chromatin condensation in eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1564668797,"Retinoids mediate their actions via RARs (retinoic acid receptors) and RXRs (retinoid X receptors). Each class of these nuclear retinoid receptors is further subdivided into three species, namely alpha, beta, and gamma. Recent studies demonstrate that estrogen receptor (ER)-positive human breast carcinoma (HBC) cell lines and tumor samples exhibit significantly higher levels of RAR alpha than their ER-negative counterparts. ER-positive HBC cell lines are sensitive to, and ER-negative cell lines are resistant to, growth inhibitory effects of retinoic acid (RA). We previously demonstrated that the expression of functional ERs in an established ER-negative cell line resulted in higher levels of RAR alpha and sensitivity to growth inhibition by RA. To further investigate the major role of RAR alpha in retinoid-mediated inhibition of growth, we transfected RAR alpha cDNA in two RA-resistant ER-negative HBC cell lines. Analyses of different clonal populations of RAR alpha transfectants from each cell line revealed growth inhibition by retinoids. Utilizing RAR- and RXR-class selective retinoids, we further demonstrated that only the RAR alpha-selective retinoids mediated the growth inhibition in these cells, while the RXR-selective retinoids were biologically inert. We thus provide evidence that the molecular mechanisms of retinoid inhibition of HBC proliferation predominantly involve RAR alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1614661592,"Shc, grb2, and Son-of-sevenless (mSos1) proteins are potential upstream regulators of p21ras. We show that p52Shc and p46Shc comprise a significant portion of two of the major protein substrates phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), Steel factor (SLF), and colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1). Once tyrosine phosphorylated, p52Shc and p46Shc associated with grb2. However, in contrast to published results with epidermal growth factor, treatment with GM-CSF, IL-3, and SLF failed to induce significant biochemically detectable translocation of Shc, grb2, or mSos1 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. In addition, we did not observe significant epidermal growth factor-induced translocation of Sos1 to the membrane in Rat-1 cells. Treatment with SLF or IL-3 did increase tyrosine phosphorylation of membrane-localized p52Shc, which could then associate with grb2, although the majority of tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc was located in the cytosol. SLF, IL-3, and phorbol ester induced a decrease in the electrophoretic mobility of mSos1. This occurred with slower kinetics than p21ras activation and unlike hemopoietin-induced activation of p21ras was partially inhibited by a specific protein kinase C inhibitor. Thus, growth factor-induced modification of mSos1 may represent a downstream event, subsequent to p21ras activation. Significantly, IL-4, a cytokine that fails to activate p21ras, also failed to induce significant tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc or a shift in mSos1 mobility for the first time correlating these events with the ability of a growth factor to activate p21ras. Together, these data suggest that the current model for regulation of p21ras, which proposes a stable association of Shc-grb2-Sos1 complexes at the plasma membrane, may be an oversimplification."
https://openalex.org/W2118817562,"Soluble lytic transglycosylase 70 (Slt70), one of the better characterized murein hydrolases of Escherichia coli, was covalently bound to CNBr-activated Sepharose and used as a specific tool to screen for proteins showing an affinity for Slt70. Several proteins were specifically enriched by Slt-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Two of them were identified as the penicillin-binding proteins (PBP)3 and PBP7/8. Thus, the bifunctional synthase PBP3, specifically involved in septum formation, and PBP7/8, recently shown to be a DD-endopeptidase, bind to Slt70 in vitro. In addition, PBP7/8 was found not only to stabilize but also to stimulate the enzymatic activity of Slt70 by a protein-protein interaction. It is concluded that Slt70, PBP7/8, and PBP3 may form a multienzyme complex in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1525751165,"The subunit requirements for NADP+ reduction by photosystem I were assessed in mutants of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 created by targeted inactivation of the psaD, psaE, psaF, and psaL genes. The PsaE-less, PsaF-PsaJ-less, and PsaL-less mutants showed normal photoautotrophic growth, while the growth of PsaD-less mutants was slower without glucose. In isolated wild-type membranes, the rate of flavodoxin reduction and flavodoxin-mediated NADP+ reduction were 800 and 480 mumol/mg of chlorophyll/h, respectively. The rate of ferredoxin-mediated NADP+ photoreduction was 460 mumol/mg of chlorophyll/h. There was no diminution in NADP+ photoreduction in membranes isolated from the PsaF-less and PsaL-less mutants. The rates of ferredoxin-mediated NADP+ photoreduction in membranes of the PsaE-less mutants were 25 mumol/mg of chlorophyll/h. However, the rate of flavodoxin reduction was 380 mumol/mg of chlorophyll/h, and that of flavodoxin-mediated NADP+ photoreduction was 170 mumol/mg of chlorophyll/h. PsaD-less membranes showed < 20% of the wild-type rates of flavodoxin-mediated NADP+ photoreduction, but were completely deficient in ferredoxin-mediated NADP+ photoreduction. Therefore, the roles of PsaE and PsaD are more crucial for of ferredoxin than of flavodoxin. Proteolysis studies showed that while PsaD was susceptible to rapid in vitro degradation by thermolysin, the number and sizes of protease-resistant fragments were not affected by the absence of PsaE. Protease accessibility studies further indicated that the C-terminal domain of PsaD is surface-exposed on the n-side. These results suggest that PsaE and the C-terminal domain of PsaD generate the docking site for the electron acceptors of photosystem I."
https://openalex.org/W1565134347,"The growth and metastasis of solid tumors rely on the activities of polypeptide growth factors. However, numerous growth factors are expressed in tumors, and it is difficult to decipher which are essential for tumor progression. We found the secreted growth factor pleiotrophin (PTN) expressed at high levels in a number of human tumor cell lines as well as in tumor samples. To assess the role of PTN in tumor growth, we inactivated the PTN gene with PTN-targeted hammerhead ribozyme constructs. Cotransfection of PTN and of the ribozymes inhibited PTN-induced colony formation of PTN-responsive cells whereas a point mutant, catalytically inactive ribozyme was ineffective. Colony formation induced by transfections with a closely related growth factor (midkine) was not affected by the ribozymes. In human melanoma cells that express high levels of PTN mRNA, stable transfection with PTN-targeted ribozymes quenched production of PTN, inhibited colony formation of the cells, and prevented their tumor growth in mice. This demonstrates that expression of a growth factor can be a rate-limiting step for malignant progression and suggests that ribozymes could be used therapeutically to target tumor growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W1544947217,"To determine whether the previously demonstrated ability of delta-opioid receptors to interact simultaneously with multiple G-proteins was a function of high receptor levels, this interaction was investigated in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing 10 different levels of cloned delta-opioid receptors, ranging from 18,000 to 1.6 x 10(6) receptors/cell. The opioid agonist D-Ala2,D-Leu5-enkephalin (DADLE) inhibited forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in all 10 clones with variable maximal inhibitory levels. Furthermore, opioid agonists altered incorporation of [alpha-32P]azidoanilido-GTP into at least four G-protein alpha-subunits in all 10 clones, three of which were determined to be Gi3 alpha, Gi2 alpha and Go2 alpha. This effect was concentration-dependent, naloxone-reversible, and delta-opioid agonist-specific and was blocked by pretreatment with pertussis toxin. Although DADLE induced an increase in the incorporation of [alpha-32P]azidoanilido-GTP into three of the four G alpha proteins that was independent of receptor density, the magnitude of this response was greater as receptor density increased. In addition, concentrations of DADLE required to promote 50% maximal labeling were similar for all four G alpha proteins within each clone and did not appear to be affected by receptor density. Therefore, the ability of delta-opioid receptors to interact with multiple G-proteins is independent of receptor density and there is also no apparent correlation between the amount of G-protein activated and the maximal effect of an agonist."
https://openalex.org/W1505028290,"The heterochromatin-associated nonhistone chromosomal protein HP1 exerts dosage-dependent effects on the silencing of genes juxtaposed to pericentric heterochromatin in Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we report that HP1 is multiply phosphorylated in Drosophila tissue, predominantly at serine and threonine residues. Pulse-labeling studies of explanted Drosophila tissues suggest that phosphorylation is relatively rapid and that phosphate is incorporated into existing protein. Maternally synthesized HP1 is underphosphorylated. The appearance of more highly phosphorylated HP1 isoforms at 1.5-2 h of development coincides with the embryonic stage at which cytologically visible heterochromatin appears and HP1 concentrates in heterochromatin. The extent of HP1 phosphorylation is lower in polytene tissue, where heterochromatin is underrepresented. These results are consistent with a role for phosphorylation of HP1 in the assembly and maintenance of heterochromatin in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W1568855665,"Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated the existence of a membrane-bound diacylglycerol kinase highly selective for diacylglycerols containing arachidonate as the sn-2 fatty acyl moiety (MacDonald, M. L., Mack K. F., Richardson, C. N., and Glomset, J. A. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 1575-1583). We now report the purification of arachidonoyl-diacylglycerol kinase 34,400-fold to apparent homogeneity from bovine testis. High concentrations of both salt and detergent were required to extract the enzyme from membranes and stabilize its activity, suggesting that in vivo the enzyme is part of a complex with other membrane or cytoskeletal proteins. Arachidonoyl-diacylglycerol kinase had an apparent M(r) of 58,000 both on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and by size exclusion chromatography. The enzyme appeared to be an integral membrane protein. In a mixed micellar assay, arachidonoyl-diacylglycerol kinase followed surface dilution kinetics with respect to diacylglycerol. The purified enzyme retained the arachidonate selectivity observed previously in membranes. Kinetic analyses indicated a Km for sn-1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoylglycerol of 2.4 mol %, as compared to 43 mol % for sn-1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylglycerol. Calcium, an activator of some other diacylglycerol kinases, had no apparent effect on the arachidonate-specific enzyme. Guanosine triphosphate could effectively substitute for ATP as the phosphoryl donor and Mg2+ could be replaced by Mn2+ or Ca2+. Phosphatidylserine and, to a lesser extent, phosphatidylinositol inhibited the purified enzyme. Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine had only small effects."
https://openalex.org/W2411871713,"Numerous recent studies have implicated the src homology 2 and 3 domain-containing protein, Grb2, in coupling protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathways with the Ras signaling pathway. Ligation of the T cell antigen receptor results in the activation of both a PTK, and Ras; therefore, we investigated whether Grb2 may serve a similar function in T cells. Here we report that a GST/Grb2 fusion protein associates with several tyrosine phosphoproteins from lysates of T cell antigen receptor-stimulated Jurkat T cells. Two of these proteins, pp36 and pp116, bind to the Grb2 fusion protein with high affinity. Through the use of mutated Grb2 fusion proteins, we demonstrate that pp116 binds the amino-terminal src homology 3 domain of Grb2, the same domain of Grb2 thought to be primarily responsible for its interaction with SOS. We demonstrate further that pp116 associates with Grb2 in vivo, and we provide evidence that in the Jurkat T cell line Grb2 may exist complexed with either pp116 or with SOS."
https://openalex.org/W58744354,"We have previously shown that mutations in the GGAA core motif of the Ets1 binding site, EBSI, or deletion of EBSI, reduced basal and Tax1 transactivation of the PTHrP P2 promoter. Here we demonstrate that, in addition to EBSI, a CACCC-like motif located between -53 and -58 is required for full basal activity of this promoter in Jurkat T-cells. Site-specific mutations in the CACCC motif decreased promoter activity approximately 5-fold. In an effort to identify transcription factors that bind to the CACCC element, we found that purified human Sp1, as well as Sp1 in HeLa nuclear extract, can specifically bind to a DNA probe that corresponds to the PTHrP-specific sequence between -94 and -34. Gel shift competition studies and DNase I footprinting analyses revealed that Sp1 specifically interacts with the CACCC motif. In the presence of Ets1, the mobility of the Sp1-specific gel shift complex with the PTHrP DNA decreased. DNase I footprint analysis of this gel shift complex showed an extended footprint over both the Sp1 and the Ets1 binding site, demonstrating that Sp1 and Ets1 form a ternary complex with the PTHrP DNA. Cotransfection of an Ets1 and Sp1 expression vector into Drosophila Schneider cells demonstrated that Sp1 can functionally cooperate with Ets1 to transactivate the PTHrP promoter. We conclude from these data that Ets1 and Sp1 can cooperatively regulate PTHrP P2 promoter activity."
https://openalex.org/W1599478288,"The proto-oncogene p21ras has been implicated as an essential intermediate in several actions of the hormone insulin. This study examines the role of p21ras in the signaling pathways by which insulin increases hexose transport in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipose cells, a model system for study of the metabolic effects of the hormone on a physiological target tissue. Introduction of constitutively activated p21ras(G12V) by microinjection into 3T3-L1 adipocytes stimulated the expression of the ubiquitous glucose transporter, GLUT1, in the absence of insulin. Moreover, introduction of dominant inhibitory forms of p21ras or neutralizing antibodies directed against p21ras blocked the insulin-induced increase in GLUT1 expression. In contrast, microinjection of activating or inhibitory forms of p21ras had no effect on translocation of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter, GLUT4, to the cell surface. These results indicate that p21ras mediates the insulin-induced increase in GLUT1 expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes but is not involved in the translocation of GLUT4 that leads to acute increases in glucose transport."
https://openalex.org/W1633537473,"Rat adipocytes were incubated with insulin or epidermal growth factor (EGF) before the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, ERK-1 and ERK-2, and the ribosomal protein S6 kinases, Rsk-2 and p70S6K, were resolved by ion exchange chromatography and identified by immunoblotting. EGF was more effective than insulin in increasing the activity of two kinases that reacted with Rsk-2 antibody (2- and 2.5-fold with EGF versus 1.6- and 1.2-fold with insulin). EGF was also more effective than insulin in increasing the activity of ERK-1 (5-fold versus 2-fold) and ERK-2 (2.5-fold versus 1.5 fold). The activity of p70S6K was increased by approximately the same extent by EGF and insulin (1.7-fold versus 2-fold). Rapamycin blocked activation of p70S6K by insulin, but it did not attenuate the effect (2-fold) of insulin on increasing the glycogen synthase activity ratio (+/-glucose-6-P). Insulin increased glucose incorporation into glycogen and 2-deoxyglucose uptake by approximately 5-fold, whereas EGF and phorbol 12-myristate were without effect. Thus, activation of MAP kinases and ribosomal protein S6 kinases appears insufficient to activate glycogen synthase or glucose transport, the two key components in the stimulation of glycogen synthesis by insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1576874300,"The effects of glycerol on plant cell metabolism were studied with sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) cells using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. After a long period of sucrose starvation, the addition of 50 mM glycerol to the medium did not restore the original glucose-6-P pool and led to a rapid accumulation of sn-glycerol-3-P in the cytoplasmic compartment. The synthesis of sn-glycerol-3-P was rapid and occurred first at the expense of cytoplasmic P(i). Accumulated sn-glycerol-3-P competitively inhibited glucose-6-phosphate isomerase activity when fructose-6-P was the varied substrate. Such a situation prevented the rapid recycling of triose phosphates back to hexose phosphates and led to an arrest of the functioning of the cytosolic and plastidial pentose phosphate pathways. Under these conditions, the flow of carbon to drive cell respiration derived almost exclusively from glycerol, and this polyalcohol was not used as a source of carbon skeletons for biosynthesis. Glycerol also induced the accumulation of O-phosphohomoserine in the cytoplasmic compartment as long as the cell culture medium contained sucrose. Finally glycerol added to sucrose-starved cells stopped the accumulation of phosphocholine (Roby, C., Martin J.-B., Bligny, R., and Douce, R. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 5000-5007) and prevented a further decline in the uncoupled rate of O2 consumption by the cells (Journet, E. P., Bligny, R., and Douce, R. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 3193-3199). These last observations strongly suggest that glycerol prevented the triggering of autophagy induced by sucrose starvation in sycamore cells."
https://openalex.org/W1752884826,"A small proteolipid called PMP1 is associated with yeast plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase (Navarre, C., Ghislain, M., Leterme, S., Ferroud, C., Dufour, J.-P., and Goffeau, A. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 6425-6428). We have identified a second Saccharomyces cerevisiae plasma membrane proteolipid gene by hybridization with a PMP1 probe. The sequence of the corresponding gene, called PMP2, is 92% identical to the PMP1 gene sequence. PMP2 encodes a 43-amino acid polypeptide that can be extracted from the membrane with chloroform/methanol. The two proteolipids differ at residue 21, which is an alanine in PMP1 and a serine in PMP2. The two PMP genes are similarly expressed in the wild-type strain, and no modification of the level of transcription of one PMP gene is detected in a strain deleted of the other. A regulatory function of the proteolipids is indicated by the observation that a strain lacking both PMP genes and no longer containing plasma membrane proteolipids displays a lower Vmax of the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1554689987,"AP-3 (AP180) in rat sympathetic neurons maintained in culture was analyzed by pulse-chase labeling with [35S]methionine to look for post-translational modifications. At early times, two lower molecular weight precursors of the mature species were detected. By 10 min, all of the AP-3 was found in the mature form which is stable for at least 9 h. We show here that at least one of these processing events is due to the addition of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) which is present on the mature form of the protein. Wheat germ agglutinin, a GlcNAc-specific probe, bound to AP-3 and the binding was blocked by excess GlcNAc but not by excess mannose. Purified AP-3, and AP-3 in coated vesicles derived from bovine brain, served as substrates for beta-D-galactosyltransferase which is specific for terminal GlcNAc residues. Analysis of the disaccharide released by beta-elimination indicated that single GlcNAc residues are attached to AP-3 through an O-glycosidic linkage to threonine or serine residues. In vivo 32P-labeled AP-3, the result of serine phosphorylation (Keen, J. H., and Black, M.M. (1986) J. Cell Biol. 102, 1325-1333), bound to wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose indicating that phosphorylation and glycosylation can occur simultaneously on the same molecule. Both modifications have been mapped to the central 50-kDa structural domain that is responsible for the anomalous migration of AP-3. Consistent with localization to the nonclathrin binding domain, the O-GlcNAc modification does not play a discernible role in the interaction of AP-3 with clathrin."
https://openalex.org/W1591455649,"The expression of cytosolic human thymidine kinase (TK) occurs in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Here, we show that TK is hyperphosphorylated during the M phase in several human cell lines. Our data from characterizing TK phosphorylation in proliferating and M phase-arrested HeLa cells suggest that the polypeptide of TK is differentially phosphorylated during the progression of the cell cycle. TK in the M phase-arrested HeLa cells was found to have a 10-fold lower affinity for its substrate, thymidine, than in the proliferating cells. We propose that phosphorylation of TK by the mitotic kinase(s) may provide an attenuating mechanism to prevent unnecessary synthesis of dTTP at the time of mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1512533325,"In human promyelocytic (HL60) leukemia cells beta II protein kinase C (PKC) is selectively translocated to the nucleus in response to proliferative stimuli. At the nucleus, beta II PKC directly phosphorylates the nuclear envelope polypeptide lamin B at two consensus PKC phosphorylation sites, Ser395 and Ser405. Phosphorylation of these sites by beta II PKC leads to solubilization of lamin B indicative of mitotic nuclear envelope breakdown in vitro (Hocevar, B.A., Burns, D.J., and Fields, A.P. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 7545-7552). We have now investigated the molecular basis for beta II PKC-selective nuclear translocation and lamin B phosphorylation using an in vitro reconstitution system. We find that beta II PKC phosphorylates nuclear envelope lamin B at 10-20 times the rate of alpha PKC, whereas both kinases phosphorylate soluble lamin B at similar rates. Comparative tryptic phosphopeptide analysis demonstrates that alpha PKC and beta II PKC phosphorylate identical sites, Ser395 and Ser405, on soluble lamin B. These data suggest that a component(s) of the nuclear envelope confers beta II PKC-selective nuclear activation and lamin B phosphorylation. Extraction of nuclear envelopes with either non-ionic detergent (2% n-octyl glucoside) or organic solvent (CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O; 10:10:3) abolishes beta II PKC-selective phosphorylation of nuclear lamin B. Nuclear membrane extracts reconstitute beta II PKC-selective phosphorylation, indicating the presence of a beta II PKC-selective nuclear membrane activation factor (NMAF). NMAF selectively activates beta II PKC histone H1 kinase activity 3-4-fold above the level achieved with optimal concentrations of Ca2+, diacylglycerol, and phosphatidylserine. Finally, NMAF activity is not affected by exhaustive protease treatment, suggesting that it is a nuclear membrane lipid(s) or lipid metabolite. These data suggest that NMAF plays a physiologic role in the nuclear activation of beta II PKC."
https://openalex.org/W1583626901,"The cis-acting elements that are functionally important for the basal, the growth hormone (GH), and the glucocorticoid hormone (GC) regulation of expression of the rat serine protease inhibitor 2.1 gene (spi 2.1) were mapped. Normal rat hepatocytes were transiently transfected with constructs harboring deleted or mutated versions of the spi 2.1 proximal promoter region fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. A purine-rich sequence (GAGA box, nucleotides -57 to -45), whose mutation or deletion almost completely knocks out both basal and hormone-stimulated promoter activities, plays the role of a key control element. A positive GC response element, spanning nucleotides -88 to -74, confers GC responsiveness to a heterologous promoter. Two structurally unrelated GH-response elements (GHRE) were identified. GHRE-II (nucleotides -136 to -104) contains a CCAAT enhancer binding protein binding site whose mutation completely abolishes its GH-dependent enhancer function. GHRE-I, which spans nucleotides -61 to +8, is not an enhancer element. Its GH-dependent activity depends on the preservation of the distance separating the GAGA box and elements of the basic transcriptional machinery. Taken together, these results have revealed the existence of an apparently new type of promoter functioning that strictly depends on the integrity of a key regulatory (G + A) motif."
https://openalex.org/W1603328416,"A recombinant His6-tagged vitamin K-dependent gamma-glutamyl carboxylase has been produced in baculovirus-infected insect cells. The His6-carboxylase shares nearly identical kinetic properties with the wild-type enzyme from bovine liver microsomes. The His6-carboxylase was irreversibly inactivated by the N-bromoacetyl-FLEEL-125I-Y peptide substrate/affinity label under pseudo-first order conditions. This inactivation could be abolished by coincubation with a high affinity peptide substrate consistent with an active site-directed inactivation. The inactivated His6-carboxylase-Ac-FLEEL-125I-Y, purified under denaturing conditions by Ni-chelation chromatography followed by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was subjected to proteolytic digestions with either Glu-C or Lys-C endoproteinases. The resulting polypeptide fragments were probed with three regiospecific antibodies which recognized epitopes present at the extreme N terminus (residues -23 to -13), at the hydrophobic N-terminal region (residues 86-99), and at the hydrophilic C-terminal region (residues 661-673). The site of attachment to the 125I-affinity label is located within the first 218 amino acid residues of the 758-residue carboxylase. This is the first evidence for the involvement of either the putative membrane-anchoring hydrophobic region (residues 50-314) or possibly the N-terminal hydrophilic region (residues 1-50) in gamma-carboxylation of glutamate-peptide substrates."

Chem. 268, 9526-9532) demonstrated that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) induces monocyte chemoattractant JE/MCP-1 expression via c-fos and c-jun genes following protein kinase C activation in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. In the present study, we examined the effect of retinoic acid (RA) on the cytokine-induced JE/MCP-1 expression in the cells. RA significantly inhibited the JE/MCP-1 gene expression by at least 6 h of pretreatment, and the inhibition was pretreatment time-dependent and occurred at the transcriptional level of the JE/MCP-1 gene expression. The RA-induced inhibition of the JE/MCP-1 gene product was also evidenced by both an assay involving immunoprecipitation with JE/MCP-1-specific antiserum and an assay for monocyte chemotaxis. Also, RA stimulated the gene expression of three different subclasses of RA receptor. RA pretreatment transcriptionally suppressed the expression of the c-fos gene but not that of the c-jun gene in TNF-alpha-treated cells. Antisense oligonucleotide to c-fos gene inhibited the cytokine-induced JE/MCP-1 gene expression in the cells. Furthermore, RA inhibited activator protein-1 binding to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate-response element (TRE) in the cells treated with TNF-alpha, suggesting that RA acts as a potent negative regulator for activator protein-1 binding activity to TRE in the osteoblastic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1535863353,"Auxin-binding protein 1 (ABP1) is a putative receptor for the class of plant growth hormones designated auxins of which indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is the predominant endogenous member. ABP1 is a homodimeric glycoprotein consisting of subunits of 163 amino acid residues. We have performed a structural study of ABP1 that has localized a region along its primary sequence that is involved in hormone binding. We have used the photoaffinity labeling agent, 5-[7-3H]azidoindole-3-acetic acid (5-[3H]N3IAA), an active auxin analog, to covalently label residues that are within, or near, the auxin-binding site. Photolabeled ABP1 was digested to completion with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. When 5-[3H]N3IAA was used at a concentration of 0.5 microM (one order of magnitude below the Kd for 5-N3IAA) only one peptide was labeled at a high specific activity. Labeling was blocked by the presence of 50 microM IAA, indicating that the interaction is specific. Sequence analysis determined that this tryptic fragment was derived from Ile130 to Leu145 of ABP1. We suggest that residue Asp134 is the specific target of the photolabeling and is within 1.48 A of the postulated hydrophobic platform of the auxin-binding site. We propose that Trp136 may serve as this hydrophobic platform in the binding site for the aromatic rings of auxins."
https://openalex.org/W1569344874,"Nuclear respiratory deficient mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been screened for lesions in genes affecting ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity. In the present study we describe a new gene, CBP4, whose encoded product is absolutely essential for the activity and expression of the respiratory enzyme. We have cloned and sequenced CBP4, which encodes a 20-kDa protein having no obvious homology to any known protein. cbp4 mutants are unable to respire due to specific loss of ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity. cbp4 mutants demonstrate a pleiotropic reduction in the steady state levels of four subunits of ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase, namely core 4, core 5, the Rieske protein and cytochrome b. Cytochrome b is not spectrally visible in the mutants, although transcription and translation of the apoprotein is normal. Antiserum prepared against a trpE/CBP4 gene fusion react with an 18.4-kDa mitochondrial protein in wild type yeast, but the protein is not found in a mutant containing a deletion of 86% of the CBP4 coding region. CBP4 protein is tightly associated with the mitochondrial membrane as evidenced by the association of the protein with the membrane fraction following carbonate extraction. The phenotype of cbp4 mutants is similar to that of cbp3 mutants. CBP3 encodes a second protein essential for ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity. We found that loss of CBP3 protein does not affect the membrane stability or steady state concentration of CBP4 protein. A double mutant containing a deletion in both CBP3 and CBP4 was constructed. Our study shows that the phenotype of the double mutant is identical to the phenotypes of the individual single mutants."
https://openalex.org/W110482318,"To study the role of a putative high affinity Ca2+ binding site in the protease domain of factor X, we prepared a deletion mutant (E2FX) lacking the Gla and first epidermal growth factor-like domains. E2FX possesses a single high affinity Ca2+ binding site (Kd = 154 microM). Asp-70 or Glu-80 (chymotrypsin numbering system) was then converted to Lys. These mutants, E2FXD70K and E2FXE80K, allow examination of the Ca(2+)-dependent assembly of activation complexes involving substrate and enzyme forms of factor X that do not bind Ca2+. E2FXD70K and E2FXE80K share similar properties. They retain functional activity, but the D70K mutant no longer binds Ca2+, and neither mutant exhibits a Ca(2+)-dependent increase in peptide chromogenic substrate activity. Activation of E2FXD70K by the soluble tissue factor-factor VIIa complex was still Ca(2+)-dependent (Kd(app) = 133 +/- 38 microM), but the Kd(app) for Ca2+ was decreased relative to E2FX (Kd(app) = 205 +/- 53 microM). Prothrombin or prethrombin 1 activation by the E2FXaD70K in the presence of factor Va was also Ca(2+)-dependent (Kd(app) = 124 +/- 47 microM and 102 +/- 38 microM, respectively), and the Kd(app) was again lower than that of E2FXa (272 +/- 79 microM and 179 +/- 54 microM, respectively). In the absence of factor Va, activation of prethrombin 1 by E2FXaD70K was not influenced by Ca2+, but activation by E2FXa was enhanced (Kd(app) = 161 +/- 32 microM). The results suggest the presence of functionally important Ca2+ binding sites in components of the factor X and prothrombin activation complexes that do not involve factor X. Furthermore, the Ca2+ binding sites in factor X and trypsin appear to be structurally similar. The Asp or Glu-->Lys mutations within this site may create an internal salt bridge that conserves factor X (Xa) function even in the absence of Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1503530359,"Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), a 28-amino acid peptide hormone, plays many physiological roles in the peripheral and central nervous systems. It has been proposed that endogenous VIP released from VIP-containing nerves is involved in the regulation of the secretory function of the endocrine pancreas. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we produced transgenic mice carrying the human VIP/peptide histidine methionine 27 (PHM-27) gene under the control of insulin promoter. In immunohistochemical analyses of islets, all the islet beta cells of transgenic mice were intensely stained for both VIP and PHM-27, consistent with the fact that these two peptides are encoded in a single mRNA (Itoh, N., Obata, K., Yanaihara, N., and Okamoto, H. (1983) Nature 304, 547-549). VIP was efficiently secreted from isolated transgenic islets in vitro. The blood glucose assays in free-fed mice indicated that the transgene lowered the blood glucose levels of transgenic mice (128 +/- 4 mg/dl) by about 20% below control levels (155 +/- 6 mg/dl). In the glucose tolerance test, at 60 min after glucose administration, the transgenic blood glucose levels (129 +/- 12 mg/dl) were much lower than control levels (175 +/- 13 mg/dl). The transgenic serum insulin levels at 15 min after glucose administration were 2.5-3.0-fold higher than control levels. The transgene was also effective in ameliorating glucose intolerance of 70% depancreatized mice. These results indicate that VIP and PHM-27 produced from the transgenic beta cells efficiently enhance glucose-induced insulin secretion from beta cells by an autocrine mechanism. These results also suggest that genetic manipulation of islet beta cells by the human VIP/PHM-27 gene or delivery of VIP to beta cells may ultimately provide a valuable approach to enhancing insulin secretion in clinical diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1566312229,"Bleomycin (BLM) is a DNA binding and damaging antibiotic produced by Streptomyces verticillus that has been used as an anti-tumor drug for various human cancers. The mammalian BLM hydrolase is a cysteine protease that inactivates BLM to relieve the toxicity of BLM to normal and tumor cells. The normal physiological function of BLM hydrolase is not known, but its activity limits the use of BLM in cancer chemotherapy. We have discovered a DNA binding activity for the yeast homolog of the mammalian BLM hydrolase in the course of studying the interaction of GAL4, a DNA-binding transcription factor, with its DNA recognition sites. Using gel mobility shift assays, we have purified a protein from yeast that binds specifically to the GAL4 DNA-binding sites. The purified protein is a tetramer of a 48-kDa polypeptide. The gene encoding the 48-kDa polypeptide was cloned and has a high homology to rabbit BLM hydrolase. The purified protein was confirmed to have a cysteine protease activity that can hydrolyze and inactivate BLM in vitro. We have established the optimal conditions for the protease activity of this protein and biochemically characterized its DNA binding activity. This protein binds both single- and double-stranded forms of the GAL4 DNA-binding sites with high affinity (10 nM to single strand and 1 microM to double strand). Its DNA binding activity is heat stable and resistant to various detergents. This protein may represent the first example of a eukaryotic DNA-binding protease. The discovery of a DNA binding activity for BLM hydrolase suggests an in vivo interaction between it and BLM on DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1495417445,"Amyloid beta-protein is derived from the amyloid beta-protein precursor (APP), and it is a major component of brain amyloid depositions in Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome. Overexpression of APP may be one of several factors contributing to amyloid formation. The APP promoter was therefore analyzed to determine the mechanism by which APP gene expression is regulated. Cell type-specific expression from the human APP promoter is accomplished with 94 base pairs upstream from the main transcriptional start site. This promoter region contains two nuclear factor binding domains, designated APB alpha and APB beta. The contribution of these binding domains to promoter activity was analyzed by transient transfection in HeLa and PC-12 cells. Under standard culture conditions, at least 70-90% of the total activity from the APP promoter can be attributed to binding domain APB beta. The recognition domain for this nuclear factor binding site is defined by the sequence GCCGCTAGGGGT (position -93 to -82). The contribution of binding site APB alpha to APP promoter activity is considerably lower and represents 10-30% of the total activity. The recognition site for the nuclear factor that binds to APB alpha is delineated by the sequence GGATCAGCTGAC (position -53 to -42). Elimination of both binding sites causes APP promoter activity in vivo to decline to near background levels."

The model includes, besides the enzyme, the d(ApTpApA) 5'-segment (A1T2A3A4) and 68 solvent molecules. The R-factor for the strongest 87% of the measured data that partially extends to 2.3-A resolution is 0.207. The A1 position is well defined; the 5'-O of the deoxyribose establishes a hydrogen bond with a solvent molecule that is, in turn, bonded to the epsilon-amino group of Lys66. The base (B0 site) is well ordered; it interacts with a symmetry-related enzyme molecule. In the crystal, the phosphate group at the p0 site has no direct charge compensation. However, Lys66 is not too far, and, in solution, it could bind to it. The T2 (R1B1p1) site is occupied as in other complex structures, and it is defined by very good electron density. The A3 site shows that the adenine moiety interacts with Asn71 and Gln69 and that the phosphate at p2 forms a salt bridge with Lys7. The most consistent model for the base of A4 (B3), both in terms of electron density and stereochemistry, shows that it forms a hydrogen bond with Gln69 and a g-g- array with the base at B2. The stacking of B2 and B3 may be a general feature of the binding of polyribonucleotides to ribonuclease A. The side chains of Gln69, Asn71, and Glu111 may thus constitute a malleable binding site capable of establishing various hydrogen bonds depending on the nature of the stacked bases. There is no evidence for the 3' G5 site in the electron density map."

This study was designed to characterize the major TGF-beta responsive element (-804 to -546). DNA footprint assays showed that the region of protein contact (-726 to -703) did not include consensus sequences for any known transacting factors. The results of UV cross-linking and Southwestern blot experiments showed that a protein of M(r) 100,000 specifically binds to the TGF-beta responsive element and that this protein undergoes post-transcriptional activation within 5 min after stimulation of Hep G2 cells by TGF-beta resulting in a marked increase in affinity for the target DNA sequence. These results show that stimulation of Hep G2 cells with TGF-beta increases the affinity of a novel 100-kDa protein for the major TGF-beta responsive element within the PAI-1 gene."
https://openalex.org/W1576449958,"ATP synthesis in ADP + P(i)-loaded membrane vesicles of the facultative alkaliphile Bacillus firmus OF4 at an external pH of 10.5 did not depend upon the presence of cell wall polymers, e.g. as a proton barrier or sequestration device. Upon energization with ascorbate plus phenazine methosulfate, vesicles at pH(out) = 7.5 generated an electrochemical proton gradient (delta p) of -160 mV, acid and positive out, whereas at pH(out) = 10.5, the delta p was -40 mV, alkaline and positive out. Nonetheless, ATP synthesis was more rapid at the more alkaline pH value, especially in the presence of 200 mM K2SO4, which markedly lowered the surface potential. No synthesis was observed upon abolition of the delta p. Respiration-derived transmembrane potentials (delta psi) energized ATP synthesis much better than an equally large diffusion potential. The diffusion potential failed to energize ATP synthesis above pH 9.5. When delta p, all in the form of a delta psi, was titrated downward at either pH 7.8 or 9.5, ATP synthesis by the latter vesicles was much less adversely affected in the delta p range of -150 to -50 mV, supporting the existence of a sparing, non-chemiosmotic energy component at high pH."
https://openalex.org/W1593821025,"Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) is initially produced by cells as a single-chain precursor (pro-uPA), which can be cleaved by the serine protease plasmin to form the two-chain molecule uPA. This latter protease efficiently converts the inactive zymogen plasminogen into plasmin. Cell surface binding of both pro-uPA and plasminogen is known to enhance the rate of plasminogen activation. It has been postulated that this may be due, in part, to an enhanced plasmin-mediated feedback activation of pro-uPA. This study directly demonstrates the enhancement by cells of this feedback activation loop by showing that uPA is generated more rapidly from pro-uPA and plasminogen in the presence of human promonocytic U937 cells than it is under fluid-phase conditions. Moreover, the enhanced activation of pro-uPA and plasminogen observed in the presence of cells was significantly less susceptible to inhibition by alpha 2-antiplasmin. Finally, the presence of cells not only potentiated the production of plasmin, as measured using a plasmin-specific peptide substrate, it also potentiated the cleavage of a natural protein substrate, 125I-labeled recombinant interferon-gamma, even in the presence of alpha 2-antiplasmin or alpha 2-macroglobulin. These results demonstrate that cell-associated plasmin mediates a positive feedback amplification of plasminogen activation and thereby potentiates the proteolysis of natural plasmin substrates, even in the presence of plasma protease inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1542071373,"The dimeric transcription factor CP2 binds a sequence element found near the transcription start site of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) long terminal repeat. Several groups have suggested that cellular factors binding this element might play a role in modulating HIV-1 promoter activity in vivo. For example, induction of latent HIV-1 gene expression in response to superinfection by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or cytomegalovirus is thought to be mediated, in part, by factors binding the CP2 site. In this report we began to examine directly the relationship between CP2 and expression of the HIV-1 promoter. First, we tested what effect HSV-1 infection of T cells had on the cellular levels of CP2. The results showed that HSV-1 infection led to a significant reduction in the level of CP2 DNA binding activity and protein within 20 h. Next, we tested the effect of overexpressing either the wild-type factor or a dominant negative variant of CP2 on HIV-1 promoter activity in vivo. The results showed that CP2 had little effect or slightly repressed HIV-1 promoter activity in vivo. In addition, these expression constructs had little effect on the induction of HIV-1 promoter activity elicited by HSV-1 infection."
https://openalex.org/W1514650180,"The beta- and gamma-crystallins are structural proteins whose high concentration and close packing are important in maintaining transparency of the eye lens. The beta gamma-crystallin superfamily includes proteins with similar core structures consisting of two compact domains linked by a short connecting peptide. In gamma-crystallins, the connecting peptide folds back on itself, allowing the amino and carboxyl domains to participate in close interactions. The beta-crystallin connecting peptide is extended so that dimerization of two beta-crystallin monomers is required for similar interdomain interactions. In order to examine the role of the sequence of the connecting peptide in determining the extended beta-crystallin conformation and hence their association into dimers, we have exchanged the 10 residues of the beta A3-crystallin connecting peptide with the 9-residue connecting peptide sequence of mouse gamma B-crystallin by site-directed mutagenesis. Unaltered and modified recombinant beta A3-crystallins were expressed in a baculovirus system and purified by sequential anion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. Integrity of the recombinant crystallins was confirmed by NH2-terminal sequence analysis, immunoblots, and CD spectrometry. Reconstitution of the mutant recombinant protein with crystallins from mouse lens soluble extract resulted in aggregates of identical size distribution as normal beta A3-crystallin. We conclude that the sequence of the connecting peptide is not critical for the association of beta A3-crystallin into dimers and higher order aggregates as had been postulated."
https://openalex.org/W1590900604,"Insulin can stimulate the expression of c-fos and other immediate early genes in many insulin-sensitive cell types. We found previously that this effect of insulin was essentially normal in cells in which protein kinase C (PKC) was down-regulated by 16 h of exposure to 16 microM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). However, recent studies by other groups have suggested that much of the insulin response was lost in down-regulated cells and that at least part of the remaining response could be due to a species of PKC beta that is resistant to down-regulation. To resolve these discrepancies, we performed PKC enzyme assays and immunoblots on HIRc-B, H4IIEC3, and BC3H-1 cells before and after down-regulation with PMA. PKC enzyme activity was undetectable in the first two cell types after down-regulation; in addition, in all three cells the expressed PKC isozymes other than PKC zeta were completely down-regulated by the PMA exposure. Neither PKC beta 1 nor beta 2 was expressed in any of the cells, as determined by immunoblotting with isotype-specific antibodies. As in our previous studies, c-Fos mRNA accumulation in response to insulin was essentially normal in the down-regulated HIRc-B and H4IIEC3 cells, whereas the response to re-added PMA was completely abolished. PKC zeta was expressed in all three cell types and was not down-regulated by PMA; these and other considerations leave open the possibility that this and other atypical PKC isotypes could play a role in insulin action."
https://openalex.org/W1562680625,"Abstract The temperate phage HP1 integrates its genome into the chromosome of Haemophilus influenzae by site-specific recombination between host and phage DNA segments, the attachment sites. This reaction is promoted by the HP1-encoded integrase. The interactions of HP1 integrase with its DNA substrates have been characterized by DNase I footprinting. Two classes of binding sites were identified. At sites of type I, integrase binding almost completely eliminated cleavage by DNase I; type I sites shared the consensus sequence 5'-AGGGATTTWW. At type II sites, integrase binding produced alternating regions of protection from and enhancement of cleavage, suggesting that binding at these sites distorted the DNA. The consensus sequence for type II sites was 5'-ACTGGCGRTW. Each binding site contained two copies of the relevant consensus. The host attachment site (attB) contains an inverted pair of type I consensus sequences surrounding the strand exchange points. The phage attachment site (attP) includes six binding sites, three of type I and three of type II, distributed along its 500 nucleotide pairs. All type I sites contain two consensus motifs arranged as inverted repeats. One of these surrounds the strand exchange points in this substrate, one is located internally, and the third coincides with the right boundary of the attP sequence. One type II site, consisting of an inverted repeat of two type II consensus motifs, coincides with the left boundary of the attP sequence. The other two type II sites contain directly repeated pairs of the consensus and are internally located."
https://openalex.org/W1596742187,"Using a human autoimmune CREST antiserum, we identified a 97-kDa polypeptide at the plus ends of Tetrahymena ciliary microtubules and an antigen associated with mammalian kinetochores (Miller, J.M., Wang, W., Balczon, R., and Dentler, W.L. (1990) J. Cell. Biol. 110, 703-714). The ciliary protein is part of a 1,500-2,000-kDa complex that can be released from ciliary microtubules and from in vitro assembled brain microtubules with ATP and ATP gamma S (Wang, W., Suprenant, K.A., and Dentler, W. L. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 24796-24807). Here we show that the ATP-dependent release of the 97-kDa protein from microtubules is inhibited, in a concentration-dependent manner, by calf intestine phosphatase and by the protein kinase inhibitor 6-dimethylaminopurine. Sodium orthovanadate, a phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, stimulated the ATP-dependent release of the 97-kDa protein from microtubules. Therefore, the ciliary fraction contains both protein kinase and phosphatase activities, and selective inhibition of these activities is necessary for the ATP-dependent binding and release of the 97-kDa protein from microtubules. When incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP, a portion of the 97-kDa protein is phosphorylated as are several other polypeptides associated with it. ATP sensitivity requires a low molecular weight heat-stable factor associated with axonemes. These results suggest that the association of the 97-kDa protein with microtubules is regulated by protein phosphorylation by axoneme-associated kinases and phosphatases."
https://openalex.org/W1522129770,"Lateral mobility studies comparing native and mutated membrane proteins, combined with treatments that alter clathrin lattice structure, can measure membrane protein-coated pit interactions in intact cells (Fire, E., Zwart, D., Roth, M. G., and Henis, Y. I. (1991) J. Cell Biol. 115, 1585-1594). We applied this approach to study the interactions of the H1 and H2 human asialoglycoprotein receptor subunits with coated pits. The lateral mobilities of singly expressed and coexpressed H1 and H2B (the H2 species that reaches the cell surface) were measured by fluorescence photobleaching recovery. They were compared with mutant proteins, H1(5A) (Tyr-5 replaced by Ala) and H2(5A) (Phe-5 replaced by Ala). While the mobile fractions of H1, H2B, and their mutants were similar, the lateral diffusion rate (measured by D, the lateral diffusion coefficient) was significantly slower for H1, whether expressed alone or with H2B. Coexpression with H1 reduced D of H2B to that of H1. Disruption of the clathrin lattices by hypertonic medium elevated D of H1, H1(5A), H2B, and H2(5A) to the same final level, without affecting their mobile fractions. Cytosol acidification, which retains altered clathrin lattices attached to the membrane and prevents coated vesicle formation, immobilized part of the H1 molecules, reflecting stable entrapment in frozen coated pits. H1(5A), H2B, and H2(5A) were not affected; however, coexpression of H2B with H1 conferred the sensitivity to cytosol acidification on H2B. Our results suggest that H1 lateral mobility is inhibited by dynamic interactions with coated pits in which Tyr-5 is involved. H2B resembles H1(5A) rather than H1, and its interactions with coated pits are weaker; efficient interaction of H2B with coated pits depends on complex formation with H1."
