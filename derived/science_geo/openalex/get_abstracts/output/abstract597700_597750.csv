Thus, we utilized the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare resource to examine risk factors and novel preexisting medical conditions that may be associated with these cancer types. Methods Between 2000 and 2011, 2,092 ICC and 2,981 ECC cases and 323,615 controls were identified using the SEER-Medicare database. Logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was associated with approximately 3-fold increased risks of ICC (OR = 3.52, 95% CI: 2.87–4.32) and ECC (OR = 2.93, 95% CI: 2.42–3.55). Other metabolic conditions, including obesity and type 2 diabetes, were also associated with increased risks of both cancer types. Smoking was associated with a 46% and 77% increased ICC and ECC risk, respectively. Several autoimmune/inflammatory conditions, including type 1 diabetes and gout, were associated with increased risks of ICC/ECC. As anticipated, viral hepatitis, alcohol-related disorders, and bile duct conditions were associated with both cancer types. However, thyrotoxicosis and hemochromatosis were associated with an increased risk of ICC but not ECC, but did not remain significantly associated after Bonferroni correction. Conclusions In this study, risk factors for ICC and ECC were similar, with the exceptions of thyrotoxicosis and hemochromatosis. Notably, metabolic conditions were associated with both cancer types. As metabolic conditions are increasing in prevalence, these could be increasingly important risk factors for both types of cholangiocarcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2765932507,"Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal transmissible spongiform encephalopathy affecting white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni), and moose (Alces alces shirasi) in North America. In southeastern Wyoming average annual CWD prevalence in mule deer exceeds 20% and appears to contribute to regional population declines. We determined the effect of CWD on mule deer demography using age-specific, female-only, CWD transition matrix models to estimate the population growth rate (λ). Mule deer were captured from 2010-2014 in southern Converse County Wyoming, USA. Captured adult (≥ 1.5 years old) deer were tested ante-mortem for CWD using tonsil biopsies and monitored using radio telemetry. Mean annual survival rates of CWD-negative and CWD-positive deer were 0.76 and 0.32, respectively. Pregnancy and fawn recruitment were not observed to be influenced by CWD. We estimated λ = 0.79, indicating an annual population decline of 21% under current CWD prevalence levels. A model derived from the demography of only CWD-negative individuals yielded; λ = 1.00, indicating a stable population if CWD were absent. These findings support CWD as a significant contributor to mule deer population decline. Chronic wasting disease is difficult or impossible to eradicate with current tools, given significant environmental contamination, and at present our best recommendation for control of this disease is to minimize spread to new areas and naïve cervid populations."

NF-κB is one of the critical transcription factors controlling this complex response, but some aspects of its regulation remain unclear. For example, although long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to critically regulate gene expression, only a fraction of these have been functionally characterized, and the extent to which lncRNAs control NF-κB expression is unknown. Here, we describe the generation of a GFP-based NF-κB reporter system in immortalized murine bone marrow–derived macrophages (iBMDM). Activation of this reporter, using Toll-like receptor ligands, resulted in GFP expression, which could be monitored by flow cytometry. We also established a CRISPR/Cas9 gene deletion system in this NF-κB reporter line, enabling us to screen for genes that regulate NF-κB signaling. Our deletion-based approach identified two long intergenic non-coding(linc)RNAs, lincRNA-Cox2 and lincRNA-AK170409, that control NF-κB signaling. We demonstrate a potential novel role for lincRNA-Cox2 in promoting IκBα degradation in the cytoplasm. For lincRNA-AK170409, we provide evidence that this nuclearly-localized lincRNA regulates a number of inflammation-related genes. In conclusion, we have established an NF-κB–GFP iBMDM reporter cell line and a line that stably expresses Cas9. Our approach enabled the identification of lincRNA-Cox2 and lincRNA-AK170409 as NF-κB regulators, and this tool will be useful for identifying additional genes involved in regulating this transcription factor critical for immune function.

It is now appreciated that the majority of the human genome (85%) is actively transcribed, yet less than 3% encodes for protein-coding genes (1Hangauer M.J. Vaughn I.W. McManus M.T. Pervasive transcription of the human genome produces thousands of previously unidentified long intergenic non-coding RNAs.PLoS Genet. 2013; 9: e1003569Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). lncRNAs 2The abbreviations used are: lncRNAlong non-coding RNAiBMDMimmortalized murine bone marrow–derived macrophageBMDMbone marrow–derived macrophagelincRNAlong intergenic non-coding RNATLRtoll-like receptorIκBinhibitor of NF-κBqPCRquantitative PCRISGinterferon-stimulated geneNTnon-targetinggRNAguide RNACtlcontrol. represent the largest group of RNAs produced from the genome and are defined as transcripts greater than 200 nucleotides in length, lacking protein-coding capacity (2Derrien T.

GENCODE version 24 has ∼16,000 annotated lncRNAs within the human genome, yet only 1% of these has been functionally characterized. From those that have been characterized, it is clear that lncRNAs are able to function through a variety of mechanisms to regulate gene expression (3Carpenter S. Long non-coding RNA: novel links between gene expression and innate immunity.Virus Res. 2016; 212: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). long non-coding RNA immortalized murine bone marrow–derived macrophage bone marrow–derived macrophage long intergenic non-coding RNA toll-like receptor inhibitor of NF-κB quantitative PCR interferon-stimulated gene non-targeting guide RNA control. Macrophages are important innate immune cells that function to recognize and defend against pathogens, while also helping to promote development of effective adaptive immune responses (4Wynn T.A. Chawla A. Pollard J.W. Macrophage biology in development, homeostasis and disease.Nature. 2013; 496: 445-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2745) Google Scholar). Membrane-bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a critical role in recognizing specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns initiating a complex inflammatory signaling cascade culminating in the activation of transcription factors, including NF-κB (5Carpenter S. O'Neill L.A. Recent insights into the structure of Toll-like receptors and post-translational modifications of their associated signalling proteins.Biochem. J. 2009; 422: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). NF-κB, in turn, specifically activates numerous inflammatory genes, which function to provide protection against invading microbes. Although NF-κB activation is critical for eliminating pathogens, excess activation of this pathway can result in a variety of inflammatory-based diseases. CRISPR/Cas9 technology has revolutionized the field of functional genomics by providing a novel tool for interrogating gene function. CRISPR/Cas9 is a deoxyribonuclease (DNase) that can be specifically targeted to genomic regions via a guide RNA (gRNA) (6Boettcher M. McManus M.T.

Genome editing, the new frontier of genome engineering with CRISPR-Cas9.Science. 2014; 346: 1258096Crossref PubMed Scopus (3580) Google Scholar). Targeting of Cas9 to a region results in a blunt double-stranded DNA break yielding small deletions in the repaired sequence (8Cong L. Ran F.A. Cox D. Lin S. Barretto R. Habib N. Hsu P.D. Wu X. Jiang W. Marraffini L.A. Zhang F. Multiplex genome engineering using CRISPR/Cas systems.Science. 2013; 339: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (9979) Google Scholar). Small deletions are appropriate for disrupting open reading frames (ORFs) of protein-coding genes but are insufficient for disrupting lncRNAs that can be tens of thousands of kilobases in length (9Ho T.-T. Zhou N. Huang J. Koirala P. Xu M. Fung R. Wu F. Mo Y.Y. Targeting non-coding RNAs with the CRISPR/Cas9 system in human cell lines.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: e17Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Using 5′- and 3′-flanking gRNAs, large stretches of DNA can be deleted, allowing for efficient disruption of lncRNA-encoding loci (10Zhang L. Jia R. Palange N.J. Satheka A.C. Togo J. An Y. Humphrey M. Ban L. Ji Y. Jin H. Feng X. Zheng Y. Large genomic fragment deletions and insertions in mouse using CRISPR/Cas9.PLoS One. 2015; 10: e0120396PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we describe a novel NF-κB–GFP reporter system in murine macrophages combined with CRISPR/Cas9 capabilities to allow robust interrogation of novel lncRNAs involved in TLR/NF-κB signaling. We utilize Cas9-mediated deletion of candidate lncRNA loci and characterize two lncRNAs, lincRNA-Cox2 and lincRNA-AK170409, and demonstrate their role in NF-κB signaling. We show that although both lincRNAs alter NF-κB signaling, they likely function in distinct ways. We provide evidence that lincRNA-Cox2 affects IκBα degradation in the cytoplasm, whereas nucleus-restricted lincRNA-AK170409 regulates numerous inflammation-related genes by modulating other steps of NF-κB activation. Here, we established an NF-κB–GFP iBMDM reporter cell line with Cas9 capabilities, allowing for rapid screening of novel regulators of the NF-κB pathway. Our characterization of lincRNA-Cox2 and lincRNA-AK170409 serves as an example of how screening-based identification of novel genes can lead to additional mechanistic understanding of ways to regulate NF-κB. Numerous fluorescence and chemiluminescence-based NF-κB reporters have been developed in a variety of cell lines (11Burger-Kentischer A. Abele I.S. Finkelmeier D. Wiesmüller K.-H. Rupp S.

Generation of stably transfected mammalian cell lines as fluorescent screening assay for NF-κB activation-dependent gene expression.J. Biomol. Screen. 2003; 8: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which have facilitated the identification of novel genes involved in regulating NF-κB activity. Until recently (13Sakai J. Cammarota E. Wright J.A. Cicuta P. Gottschalk R.A. Li N. Fraser I.D.C. Bryant C.E. Lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-κB nuclear translocation is primarily dependent on MyD88, but TNFα expression requires TRIF and MyD88.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), no fluorescent-based NF-κB reporter systems had been described in bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMs). BMDMs are critical mediators of the inflammatory response and represent a more physiologically relevant cell line compared with other reporters currently available. We constructed a GFP-based NF-κB reporter system by adding 5× NF-κB-binding motifs (GGGAATTTCC) upstream of the minimal CMV promoter-driven GFP (Fig. 1A). Immortalized BMDMs (iBMDMs) were lentivirally infected and clonally selected for optimal reporter activity. We tested the utility of our system by stimulating cells with various TLR ligands for 6, 24, or 48 h (Fig. 1, B and C). Stimulated cells showed >10-fold induction of GFP for LPS (Tlr4), Pam3CSK4 (Tlr1/2), and R848 (Tlr7/8), while showing weak induction with poly(I:C) (Tlr3) ligand (Fig. 1, B and C). We confirmed that the NF-κB reporter cells were capable of inducing endogenous proinflammatory genes Il6 and Ccl5 (Fig. 1D). Together, these data show that we have developed a functional GFP-based NF-κB reporter system in macrophages. One the most useful features of NF-κB reporter systems has been the ease of use for screen-based identification of genes that regulate the NF-κB pathway (14Van Waes C. Nuclear factor-κB in development, prevention, and therapy of cancer.Clin Cancer Res. 2007; 13: 1076-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). CRISPR/Cas9 technology has revolutionized the field of functional genomics by providing a novel tool for interrogating gene function. We reconstituted the CRISPR/Cas9 system into our reporter cells using lentiviral transduction, allowing a versatile and easy way to interrogate novel gene function (supplemental Fig. S1A). Cas9 has been observed to have unwanted toxicity in cells (15Gilbert L.A. Horlbeck M.A. Adamson B. Villalta J.E. Chen Y. Whitehead E.H. Guimaraes C. Panning B. Ploegh H.L. Bassik M.C. Qi L.S. Kampmann M. Weissman J.S. Genome-scale CRISPR-mediated control of gene repression and activation.Cell. 2014; 159: 647-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we confirmed that Cas9 expression did not alter the function of our NF-κB reporter system (supplemental Fig. S1). To validate the CRISPR/Cas9 system, we cloned three gRNAs targeting Tlr4 or non-targeting (NT) guides into a U6-gRNA lentiviral construct and infected Cas9-expressing iBMDM cells for 7 days to allow for complete editing of the target genes. LPS stimulation of the NT-expressing cells resulted in >10-fold induction of GFP as expected (Fig. 2A, row i, blue). In contrast, anti-Tlr4 guide-expressing cells were not able to induce GFP upon LPS stimulation (Fig. 2A, rows ii–iv, black). We confirmed the specificity of the anti-Tlr4 guides by demonstrating that Tlr2 stimulation was not altered (Fig. 2B, rows ii–iv, black). Quantifications of mean fluorescence intensities for two representative experiments are shown in Fig. 2, C (LPS) and D (P3C4). Together, these data demonstrate that we have successfully constructed an NF-κB reporter system in iBMDMs with functional Cas9 capabilities. We have previously performed RNA sequencing on murine iBMDMs following stimulation with the Tlr1/2 ligand Pam3CSK4, and we identified 64 up-regulated lncRNAs following stimulation (16Carpenter S. Aiello D. Atianand M.K. Ricci E.P. Gandhi P. Hall L.L. Byron M. Monks B. Henry-Bezy M. Lawrence J.B. O'Neill L.A. Moore M.J. Caffrey D.R. Fitzgerald K.A. A long non-coding RNA mediates both activation and repression of immune response genes.Science. 2013; 341: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). From the data set, 20 of the lncRNAs were intergenic, meaning they possessed their own promoters and did not overlap any protein-coding genes, which allowed for deletion of loci without potential disruptions to neighboring coding genes. To select candidates for deletion, we focused on the highly up-regulated lincRNAs that overlap both our data (16Carpenter S. Aiello D. Atianand M.K. Ricci E.P. Gandhi P. Hall L.L. Byron M. Monks B. Henry-Bezy M. Lawrence J.B. O'Neill L.A. Moore M.J. Caffrey D.R. Fitzgerald K.A. A long non-coding RNA mediates both activation and repression of immune response genes.Science. 2013; 341: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar), as well as the dataset generated by Lam et al. (17Lam M.T. Cho H. Lesch H.P. Gosselin D. Heinz S. Tanaka-Oishi Y. Benner C. Kaikkonen M.U. Kim A.S. Kosaka M. Lee C.Y. Watt A. Grossman T.R. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Glass C.K. Rev-Erbs repress macrophage gene expression by inhibiting enhancer-directed transcription.Nature. 2013; 498: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) where they stimulated cells with Pam3CSK4 and LPS. From these data, we focused our attention on lincRNA-Cox2 and lincRNA-AK170409. The expression profile of these lncRNAs supported that they were likely regulated by the NF-κB via TLR-signaling pathway; however, whether these lncRNAs were involved in regulating NF-κB has not been investigated. We had previously established a role for lincRNA-Cox2 in regulating immune response genes (16Carpenter S. Aiello D. Atianand M.K. Ricci E.P. Gandhi P. Hall L.L. Byron M. Monks B. Henry-Bezy M. Lawrence J.B. O'Neill L.A. Moore M.J. Caffrey D.R. Fitzgerald K.A. A long non-coding RNA mediates both activation and repression of immune response genes.Science. 2013; 341: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Knocking down lincRNA-Cox2 in murine iBMDMs using shRNA led to a reduction in expression of proinflammatory genes such as Il6 (16Carpenter S. Aiello D. Atianand M.K. Ricci E.P. Gandhi P. Hall L.L. Byron M. Monks B. Henry-Bezy M. Lawrence J.B. O'Neill L.A. Moore M.J. Caffrey D.R. Fitzgerald K.A. A long non-coding RNA mediates both activation and repression of immune response genes.Science. 2013; 341: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar), although the mechanism by which lincRNA-Cox2 regulates these genes remains unclear. Here, we delete the lincRNA-Cox2 locus using CRISPR/Cas9 to directly test the impact on NF-κB signaling. We designed two gRNAs targeting both 5′- and 3′-sequences flanking the lincRNA-Cox2 locus (Fig. 3A, red arrows). We isolated a clone containing a deletion in the locus and verified the loss of lincRNA-Cox2 expression by qPCR (Fig. 3B). We have previously shown that expression of lincRNA-Cox2 is most highly induced by TLR stimulation peaking at 5 h, and here we confirm this is also true in our iBMDM reporter system (Fig. 3B). We have also previously reported that lincRNA-Cox2 is directly regulated by ΝF-κB binding (17Lam M.T. Cho H. Lesch H.P. Gosselin D. Heinz S. Tanaka-Oishi Y. Benner C. Kaikkonen M.U. Kim A.S. Kosaka M. Lee C.Y. Watt A. Grossman T.R. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Glass C.K. Rev-Erbs repress macrophage gene expression by inhibiting enhancer-directed transcription.Nature. 2013; 498: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). A small number of NF-κB-induced lncRNAs have been demonstrated to function as positive/negative feedback regulators of NF-κB signaling (3Carpenter S. Long non-coding RNA: novel links between gene expression and innate immunity.Virus Res. 2016; 212: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It was unclear whether lincRNA-Cox2 played this type of role. In this study, we found that disruption of the lincRNA-Cox2 locus leads to an overall decrease in NF-κB activity when cells were stimulated with a variety of ligands at both 24 h (Fig. 3C) and 48 h (Fig. 3D) post-stimulation. Induction of Il6 was diminished in the KO cells at the 5-h time point (Fig. 4E), whereas Tnf, which is most highly induced after 2 h of stimulation, was not altered (Fig. 4F). These data are consistent with our previous study using shRNA where we showed that lincRNA-Cox2 can affect genes at the level of transcription (16Carpenter S. Aiello D. Atianand M.K. Ricci E.P. Gandhi P. Hall L.L. Byron M. Monks B. Henry-Bezy M. Lawrence J.B. O'Neill L.A. Moore M.J. Caffrey D.R. Fitzgerald K.A. A long non-coding RNA mediates both activation and repression of immune response genes.Science. 2013; 341: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Inducible activation of NF-κB depends upon proteosomal degradation of the inhibitor of NF-κB proteins (IκBs), which retains inactive NF-κB dimers in the cytosol (18Oeckinghaus A. Ghosh S. The NF-κB family of transcription factors and its regulation.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2009; 10.1101/cshperspect.a000034Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found that there was a dramatic decrease in IκBα degradation following 0.5 h of stimulation with LPS in the lincRNA-Cox2 KO cells (Fig. 3, G and H). The NF-κB subunit p65 has been shown to directly regulate IκBα levels (19Scott M.L. Fujita T. Liou H.C. Nolan G.P. Baltimore D. The p65 subunit of NF-κB regulates IκB by two distinct mechanisms.Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1266-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Hence, one explanation for the deficiency in IκBα degradation could be explained by alterations in p65 levels (19Scott M.L. Fujita T. Liou H.C. Nolan G.P. Baltimore D. The p65 subunit of NF-κB regulates IκB by two distinct mechanisms.Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1266-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). We measured p65 RNA levels by qPCR in the control and KO cells and found no difference at the basal levels (supplemental Fig. S2), although there was a decrease in p65 levels at 5 h post-stimulation in the KO cells (supplemental Fig. S2). IκBα is localized to the cytoplasm, whereas lincRNA-Cox2 has been shown to be localized to both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 4C) (16Carpenter S. Aiello D. Atianand M.K. Ricci E.P. Gandhi P. Hall L.L. Byron M. Monks B. Henry-Bezy M. Lawrence J.B. O'Neill L.A. Moore M.J. Caffrey D.R. Fitzgerald K.A. A long non-coding RNA mediates both activation and repression of immune response genes.Science. 2013; 341: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Our data support a possible role for lincRNA-Cox2 in the cytoplasm regulating the degradation of IκBα. IκBα degradation occurred at 0.5 h post-stimulation, which suggests that basal cytoplasmic expression of lincRNA-Cox2 could impact the NF-κB pathway; however, the mechanism of action remains to be determined. Here, we have established the utility of our NF-κB–Cas9 system for deletion-based screening for lncRNAs involved in NF-κB signaling.Figure 4Deletion of a novel lincRNA locus results in disruption of NF-κB signaling.

Long non-coding RNA: novel links between gene expression and innate immunity.Virus Res. 2016; 212: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We targeted the intergenic lincRNA-AK170409 because it showed high induction with LPS and Pam3CSK4 in both primary macrophages and in our iBMDMs reporter cells (Fig. 4A, LPS and P3C4). Additionally, this lincRNA possesses an inducible ChIP peak for transcription factor c-Jun (17Lam M.T. Cho H. Lesch H.P. Gosselin D. Heinz S. Tanaka-Oishi Y. Benner C. Kaikkonen M.U. Kim A.S. Kosaka M. Lee C.Y. Watt A. Grossman T.R. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Glass C.K. Rev-Erbs repress macrophage gene expression by inhibiting enhancer-directed transcription.Nature. 2013; 498: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), a component of the AP-1 transcription complex with roles in inflammation (Fig. 4A, c-Jun) (20Schonthaler H.B. Guinea-Viniegra J. Wagner E.F. Targeting inflammation by modulating the Jun/AP-1 pathway.Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2011; 70: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To determine the precise expression kinetics for this lincRNA, we performed qPCR on iBMDMs stimulated with LPS for 0, 2, 5, and 24 h (Fig. 4B).The lincRNA-AK170409 expression peaked at 2 and 5 h and was reduced by 24 h post-stimulation (Fig. 4B). lncRNAs can be found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. We examined the cellular localization of lincRNA-AK170409 and determined that it was localized strictly to the nucleus (Fig. 4C). In the same manner as was used for lincRNA-Cox2, we designed two gRNAs targeting the 5′ and 3′ of the AK170409 locus (Fig. 4D, red arrows). We electroporated gRNAs into iBMDMs, performed limited dilution isolation of clones, and screened for deletion containing clones. Using lincRNA-AK170409-specific genotyping primers (Fig. 4D), we confirmed deletion of one allele of the AK70409 locus (Fig. 4, E and F), which resulted in 50% reduction in lincRNA expression, as evaluated by qPCR (Fig. 4G). We screened over 300 clones and failed to identify a clone with both alleles deleted suggesting that knocking out this lincRNA could be lethal to cells. Nevertheless, reduced expression of lincRNA-AK170409 resulted in a significant reduction in NF-κB signaling following stimulation with either LPS or Pam3CSK4, which suggests a role for this lincRNA in the pathway (Fig. 4, H and I). Unlike the data observed for lincRNA-Cox2, we found no difference in IκBα degradation between control and heterozygote cells (Fig. 4, J and K) suggesting that the effects of this lincRNA are on a different part of the pathway. To assess global gene expression changes that result from deletion of the AK170409 locus, we performed Nanostring analysis on control and heterozygote iBMDMs stimulated for 2 and 5 h (Fig. 4, L and M, and supplemental Tables S1 and S2). Interestingly, we identified genes that were both up- and down-regulated when lincRNA-AK170409 was knocked down, including genes with known roles in the TLR-signaling pathway (Fig. 4, L and M, and supplemental Tables S1 and S2). Intriguingly, one of the most down-regulated genes was the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) gene, which encodes a ligand-activated transcription factor known to regulate immune responses (discussed below) (21Vogel C.F. Khan E.M. Leung P.S. Gershwin M.E. Chang W.L. Wu D. Haarmann-Stemmann T. Hoffmann A. Denison M.S.

Genes affected by knockdown of lincRNA-AK170409 were highly correlated between the 2- and 5-h time points (Fig. 4N). Together, by using our NF-κB–Cas9 system, we have identified two new lincRNAs that control NF-κB signaling, and we demonstrated that this system is a versatile tool for coding and non-coding gene interrogation. Here, we developed a new fluorescence-based NF-κB reporter system in iBMDMs. We have enabled CRISPR/Cas9 capabilities and demonstrated proof-of-concept utility of the system for screening novel regulators of the NF-κB pathway. Furthermore, we utilized the system to identify two novel lncRNAs that regulate the NF-κB pathway. We have identified lincRNA-Cox2 and lincRNA-AK170409 as two novel regulators of NF-κB. We have previously identified lincRNA-Cox2 as a critical regulator of immune response genes (16Carpenter S. Aiello D. Atianand M.K. Ricci E.P. Gandhi P. Hall L.L. Byron M. Monks B. Henry-Bezy M.

A long non-coding RNA mediates both activation and repression of immune response genes.Science. 2013; 341: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Knocking down lincRNA-Cox2 resulted in reduced expression of proinflammatory genes such as Il6, whereas interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) were up-regulated (16Carpenter S. Aiello D. Atianand M.K. Ricci E.P. Gandhi P. Hall L.L. Byron M. Monks B. Henry-Bezy M. Lawrence J.B. O'Neill L.A. Moore M.J. Caffrey D.R. Fitzgerald K.A. A long non-coding RNA mediates both activation and repression of immune response genes.Science. 2013; 341: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). lincRNA-Cox2 is expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm and had previously been shown to regulate ISGs through its interaction with the nuclearly-localized Hnrnpa2/b1 and a/b proteins (16Carpenter S.

A long non-coding RNA mediates both activation and repression of immune response genes.Science. 2013; 341: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Until now, we did not understand what factors were involved in lincRNA-Cox2’s regulation of Il6. From our previous studies we knew lincRNA-Cox2 is directly induced by NF-κB binding, which also activates Il6 (16Carpenter S. Aiello D. Atianand M.K. Ricci E.P. Gandhi P. Hall L.L. Byron M. Monks B.

It was unclear whether lincRNA-Cox2 was involved in positive/negative feedback to impact NF-κB activity. Here, we show that lincRNA-Cox2 deletion directly reduces NF-κB activity, which suggests a novel role for lincRNA-Cox2 as an NF-κB cofactor required for maximal activity. A recent study by Hu et al.

However, the extent of intratumoral heterogeneity of PD-L1 expression, which may cause false negative results, is largely unexplored. We aimed to assess the intratumoral heterogeneity of PD-L1 expression in surgically resected lung cancer specimens by applying a novel method of tissue microarray, namely Spiral Arrays, which enables us to observe the heterogeneity in spiral-shaped tissue cores. Adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma specimens were obtained from consecutive patients with lung cancer who had undergone surgical resection at Nagasaki University Hospital (Nagasaki, Japan) since 2009. Small cell lung cancer and large cell carcinoma specimens were selected from patients in the same archive who had undergone resection since 1998. Spiral Arrays were constructed of spiral-shaped cores, prepared from representative blocks of each case, which were subjected to immunohistochemistry using an anti-PD-L1 antibody. Each core was divided into 8 segments and each segment was classified as either PD-L1-positive or PD-L1-negative using thresholds of 1.0%, 5.0%, 10.0%, and 50.0%, respectively. In total, 138 specimens were selected, including 60 adenocarcinomas, 59 squamous cell carcinomas, 12 small cell lung cancers, and 7 large cell carcinomas. The majority of specimens with PD-L1-positive segments exhibited heterogeneous expression (i.e., had a mixture of PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative segments within a core) irrespective of the threshold (1.0%, 66.7%; 5.0%, 74.4%; 10.0%, 75.8%; and 50.0%, 85.7%]. Large variations in the ratios of PD-L1-positive segments were observed. At least 50.0% of the segments within a core were negative in no fewer than 50.0% (range, 50.0–76.0%) of cases with heterogeneous PD-L1 expression. In conclusion, intratumoral heterogeneity of PD-L1 expression was frequently observed in cases of lung cancer. Thus, multiple tumor biopsy specimens may be needed to accurately determine the PD-L1 expression status."

Given that AGEs are closely associated with degenerative disorders, such as type-2 diabetes, it is of interest to investigate the potent role of AGEs in inflammasome-mediated immune responses. Thus far, it has not been explored whether AGEs could modulate the activation of inflammasome signaling in myeloid cells. In this study, we examined the potential role of AGEs on inflammasome assembly or activation in macrophages. To examine the effect of AGEs on inflammasome signaling, we first prepared AGEs by incubating bovine serum albumin (BSA) with a high concentration of glucose for 8 weeks, as described previously (22Andreea S.I. Marieta C. Anca D. AGEs and glucose levels modulate type I and III procollagen mRNA synthesis in dermal fibroblasts cells culture.Exp. Diabetes Res. 2008; 2008: 473603Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We subsequently validated the production of AGEs by assessing its unique fluorescence spectrum (excitation 370 nm, emission 440 nm; Fig. 1A). Then, we treated bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMs) with AGEs for 6 or 18 h and assessed the secreted levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines from BMDMs. Unexpectedly, AGE treatment did not trigger the secretion of IL-1β or IL-6 in BMDMs (Fig. 1, B and C). Similarly, AGE treatment also failed to promote IL-1β secretion in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation (Fig. 1B), but rather suppressed secretion of IL-6 from BMDMs stimulated with LPS (Fig. 1C). Supporting these data, AGE treatment was incapable of inducing the expression of IL-1β and IL-6 mRNA in BMDMs (Fig. 1, D and E) as well as in human monocytic THP-1 cells (Fig. 1, F and G). In agreement with our observations, two commercially available AGEs, prepared from the incubation of BSA with glycoaldehyde (GA-BSA) or glucose (Glu-BSA), failed to trigger the robust production of IL-6 mRNA in BMDMs (Fig. 1H). Of particular interest, prolonged treatment of AGEs repressed LPS-promoted production of IL-6 from BMDMs (Fig. 1C). Consistent with this data, pretreatment with AGEs (10 mg/ml) for 15 h prior to LPS stimulation significantly attenuated LPS-triggered up-regulation of IL-1β and IL-6 mRNA levels in BMDMs (Fig. 2, A and B). Additionally, pretreatment with two commercial AGEs, GA-BSA and Glu-BSA, also led to a significant suppression of IL-6 mRNA induction in LPS-stimulated BMDMs (Fig. 2C). However, a short incubation with AGEs (up to 3 h) did not cause this inhibitory effect (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). To further examine whether AGEs could dampen the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages triggered by other TLR agonists than LPS, we stimulated BMDMs with Pam3CSK4, a TLR1/2 agonist, or a poly(I:C), a TLR3 agonist. In agreement with LPS stimulation, AGE pretreatment significantly attenuated Pam3CSK4-stimulated induction of IL-1β and IL-6 mRNA in BMDMs (Fig. 2, D and E). Consistently, poly(I:C)-triggered production of IL-6 mRNA was also diminished by AGE, but not by BSA, pretreatment (Fig. 2F). These findings clearly demonstrated that AGEs could impair TLR-mediated cytokine production in macrophages. We next examined whether AGEs affect caspase-1 and inflammasome signaling. Similar to the findings shown in Fig. 1, AGE treatment failed to induce caspase-1/inflammasome activation in BMDMs even with costimulation with ATP, as determined by the presence of extracellular cleaved caspase-1 (p20) and IL-1β (Fig. 3A). LPS/ATP treatment was used to stimulate NLRP3 inflammasomes as a positive control. Of more interest, pretreatment with AGEs, but not with BSA, showed a robust reduction in the secretion of active caspase-1 and IL-1β from BMDMs in response to LPS/ATP stimulation (Fig. 3B). AGE pretreatment consistently exhibited a dose-dependent attenuation of caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion in BMDMs upon stimulation with LPS/ATP (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. S2). We also prepared extensively modified AGEs by longer incubation of BSA with glucose for 24 weeks. The extensive formation of AGE adducts (24-week incubation) was revealed by a stronger fluorescence intensity of AGEs than observed with normal AGEs (8-week incubation, Fig. 3D). The 24-week AGE samples, but not 24-week BSA samples, blocked NLRP3 inflammasome activation at a much lower AGE concentration (1 mg/ml, Fig. 3, E and F). To support our observations, commercially available AGEs also showed a clear inhibition of LPS/ATP-promoted caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion in BMDMs (Fig. 3G). Additionally, we examined whether glucose in the reaction mixture of the AGE preparation could help suppress NLRP3 inflammasome activation. We performed similar experiments with dialyzed AGE to remove added glucose in the mixture. Dialyzed AGEs also showed robust inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in BMDMs (Fig. 3H). Furthermore, the reaction mixture containing glucose alone (without BSA) did not suppress caspase-1 activation after LPS/ATP stimulation (Fig. 3H). These findings indicate that AGE pretreatment drives lower responsiveness to NLRP3-activated stimulation in macrophages. We then examined the role of AGEs on inflammasome signaling in response to stimulations other than LPS/ATP. NLRP3-mediated inflammasome activation triggered by ATP, nigericin, or alum was clearly attenuated by pretreatment with AGEs in LPS-primed macrophages (Fig. 4A). However, poly(dA:dT) transfection-triggered inflammasome activation, mediated by AIM2, was not impaired by AGE pretreatment (Fig. 4B). NLRC4 inflammasome activation in response to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection was not reduced by pretreatment with AGEs (Fig. 4C). Moreover, AGE pretreatment clearly abolished LPS/ATP-triggered oligomerization of ASC, an essential phenomenon of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling (23Fernandes-Alnemri T. Wu J. Yu J.W. Datta P. Miller B. Jankowski W. Rosenberg S. Zhang J. Alnemri E.S. The pyroptosome: a supramolecular assembly of ASC dimers mediating inflammatory cell death via caspase-1 activation.Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1590-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4D). In accordance with these data, the formation of speck-like NLRP3 aggregates by nigericin was significantly reduced by AGE pretreatment (Fig. 4, E and F). These results collectively indicate that AGE pretreatment specifically impairs the NLRP3 inflammasome-activating potential of macrophages. To investigate the mechanism by which AGE pretreatment could modulate NLRP3 inflammasome signaling, we first measured the expression of NLRP3 mRNA. As shown in Fig. 2, AGE pretreatment diminished LPS-triggered IL-1β or IL-6 mRNA production in BMDMs. Similarly, LPS-promoted up-regulation of NLRP3 was significantly repressed by AGE treatment (Fig. 5A). Then, we checked whether AGE pretreatment could interfere with the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)–NF-κB signaling axis. Consistent with the reduced production of cytokines and NLRP3, AGE pretreatment considerably inhibited LPS-stimulated phosphorylation and degradation of IκB in BMDMs, indicating that AGEs negatively regulated NF-κB signaling under our conditions (Fig. 5B). We further verified this finding in HEK293 cells stably expressing TLR4, in which LPS stimulation caused a robust activation of NF-κB as determined by performing an NF-κB–luciferase reporter assay. However, pretreatment with AGEs did not inhibit NF-κB activation in TLR4–HEK293 cells in response to LPS stimulation (Fig. 5C). Based on these findings, we inferred that AGE treatment may impair TLR4–NF-κB signaling pathways in macrophages, but not in non-myeloid 293 cells. Given that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was shown to contribute to the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes in a recent study (24Ghonime M.G. Shamaa O.R. Das S. Eldomany R.A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Gavrilin M.A. Wewers M.D. Inflammasome priming by lipopolysaccharide is dependent upon ERK signaling and proteasome function.J. Immunol. 2014; 192: 3881-3888Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), we examined the potential impact of AGE pretreatment on ERK signaling under NLRP3-activating conditions. LPS/ATP stimulation clearly induced ERK phosphorylation, but AGE pretreatment did not affect ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 5D). Similarly, AGEs did not impair LPS/ATP-triggered phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (Fig. 5E). These findings suggest that the anti-inflammatory role of AGEs does not depend on the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases signaling. In addition to ERK, many recent findings have suggested that mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) production plays a crucial role in NLRP3 inflammasome activation (25Zhou R. Yazdi A.S. Menu P. Tschopp J.

In our experiments, pretreatment with AGEs significantly reduced mtROS production in wild-type mouse BMDMs stimulated with LPS/ATP, but not in Nlrp3-deficient BMDMs (Fig. 5F and supplemental Fig. S3). Interestingly, LPS/ATP-triggered production of mtROS was partially attenuated in Nlrp3-deficient BMDMs compared with that in wild-type cells (Fig. 5F). This result suggests that NLRP3 inflammasome activation, at least in part, contributes to mtROS production. AGE pretreatment caused no reduction in mtROS production in Nlrp3-deficient cells. We thus conclude that AGE-mediated reduction in mtROS might be a result of attenuated inflammasome activation. In this context, AGE-mediated impairment of NLRP3 inflammasome activation is not likely to be due to reduced mtROS production. It is well-established that macrophage polarization is a fine-tuning process used by macrophages to adapt to changes in the microenvironment (30Labonte A.C. Tosello-Trampont A.C. Hahn Y.S. The role of macrophage polarization in infectious and inflammatory diseases.Mol. Cells. 2014; 37: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). As shown above, our data revealed that AGEs attenuated LPS-triggered production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In agreement with this finding, we examined whether AGEs could affect M1 polarization of macrophages. Of interest, AGE treatment exhibited a robust inhibition on LPS- and IFN-γ-induced expression of CXCL11, a distinct marker of M1 polarization (31Porta C. Rimoldi M. Raes G. Brys L. Ghezzi P. Di Liberto D. Dieli F. Ghisletti S. Natoli G. De Baetselier P. Mantovani A. Sica A. Tolerance and M2 (alternative) macrophage polarization are related processes orchestrated by p50 nuclear factor κB.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 14978-14983Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6A). Supporting this observation, LPS-driven elevation in the level of M1 markers, including inducible nitric-oxidase synthase and TNF-α, was significantly reduced by AGE pretreatment (Fig. 6, B and C). Then, we further checked the effect of AGEs on M2 polarization of macrophages. Unlike M1 polarization markers, AGEs did not alter the expression level of M2 genes, such as Arg1 and Ym1, in BMDMs upon IL-4 stimulation (Fig. 6, D and E). NLRP3 inflammasome activation generally requires two independent stimuli, for example, signal 1 for priming and signal 2 for activation (32Bauernfeind F.G. Horvath G. Stutz A. Alnemri E.S. MacDonald K. Speert D. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Wu J. Monks B.G. Fitzgerald K.A. Hornung V. Latz E.

Immunol. 2009; 183: 787-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar). Considering that AGE treatment markedly attenuated LPS-driven priming events and M1 polarization of macrophages, we further examined whether AGEs could inhibit signal 2-induced activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. As reported by a previous study (33Juliana C. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Wu J. Datta P. Solorzano L. Yu J.W. Meng R. Quong A.A. Latz E. Scott C.P. Alnemri E.S. Anti-inflammatory compounds parthenolide and Bay 11–7082 are direct inhibitors of the inflammasome.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 9792-9802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), only ATP treatment, a signal 2 stimulus, in the absence of LPS priming was sufficient to induce caspase-1 activation in NLRP3-reconstituted BMDMs (Fig. 6F). Intriguingly, AGEs showed a remarkable suppression of ATP-triggered activation of caspase-1 in NLRP3-reconstituted macrophages (Fig. 6F). These findings suggest that AGEs could interfere with not only the LPS-promoted priming step but also the signal 2-induced activation step for the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. RAGE was first identified as a receptor for AGEs (34Neeper M. Schmidt A.M. Brett J. Yan S.D. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Elliston K. Stern D. Shaw A. Cloning and expression of a cell surface receptor for advanced glycosylation end products of proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14998-15004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We further examined the potential implication of RAGE in the innate immune-suppressing capability of AGEs. Under our experimental conditions, RAGE-specific antagonist FPS-ZM1 did not affect the AGE-mediated inhibition of LPS/ATP-triggered caspase-1 activation (Fig. 7A). Consistent with this finding, RAGE inhibitor failed to affect the AGE-driven suppression of IL-6 mRNA induction in BMDMs upon stimulation with LPS (Fig. 7B). However, RAGE inhibitor showed a significant reduction of IL-6 mRNA expression triggered by S100 protein (Fig. 7C). In addition, AGE-mediated inhibition of LPS-promoted IκB phosphorylation was not prevented by RAGE inhibitor (Fig. 7D). As similar, reduction of the M1 marker CxCl11 mRNA level by AGE pretreatment was not reversed by the presence of the RAGE inhibitor (Fig. 7E). These findings collectively indicated that RAGE signaling is not associated with AGE-driven impairment of innate immune responses. As our data demonstrated that AGE pretreatment caused a severe reduction in the assembly and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes, we further examined whether AGEs could affect host inflammasome activation in macrophages upon influenza virus infection. Consistent with the above data, pretreatment with AGEs, but not with BSA, clearly abolished both caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion in BMDMs upon infection with influenza A virus (Fig. 8A). Next, we measured interferon-β (IFN-β) production by macrophages in response to influenza virus infection. Of note, AGE pretreatment significantly suppressed IFN-β mRNA production and secretion from BMDMs upon influenza virus infection (Fig. 8, B and C). These findings suggest that AGEs could impair the host innate immune defense in macrophages against dsRNA-mediated virus infection. Accumulating recent evidence has demonstrated that deregulated NLRP3 inflammasome activity is closely associated with the progression of multiple metabolic and degenerative disorders (19Heneka M.T.

https://openalex.org/W2765254469,"Objectives Lutein, a carotenoid with anti-oxidant functions, preferentially accumulates in primate brain and is positively related to cognition in humans. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), is also beneficial for cognition, but is susceptible to oxidation. The present study characterized the membrane distribution of lutein in brain regions important for different domains of cognitive function and determined whether membrane lutein was associated with brain PUFA oxidation. Methods Adult rhesus monkeys were fed a stock diet (~2 mg/day lutein or ~0.5 μmol/kg body weight/day) (n = 9) or the stock diet plus a daily supplement of lutein (~4.5 mg/day or~1 μmol/kg body weight/day) and zeaxanthin (~0.5 mg/day or 0.1 μmol/kg body weight/day) for 6–12 months (n = 4). Nuclear, myelin, mitochondrial, and neuronal plasma membranes were isolated using a Ficoll density gradient from prefrontal cortex (PFC), cerebellum (CER), striatum (ST), and hippocampus (HC). Carotenoids, PUFAs, and PUFA oxidation products were measured using HPLC, GC, and LC-GC/MS, respectively. Results All-trans-lutein (ng/mg protein) was detected in all regions and membranes and was highly variable among monkeys. Lutein/zeaxanthin supplementation significantly increased total concentrations of lutein in serum, PFC and CER, as well as lutein in mitochondrial membranes and total DHA concentrations in PFC only (P<0.05). In PFC and ST, mitochondrial lutein was inversely related to DHA oxidation products, but not those from arachidonic acid (P <0.05). Discussion This study provides novel data on subcellular lutein accumulation and its relationship to DHA oxidation in primate brain. These findings support the hypothesis that lutein may be associated with antioxidant functions in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2766423015,"Microglia activation and associated inflammatory response are involved in the pathogenesis of different neurodegenerative diseases. We have reported that Notch-1 and NF-κB/p65 signalling pathways operate in synergy in regulating the production of proinflammatory mediators in activated microglia. In the latter, there is also evidence by others that glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) mediates the release of proinflammatory cytokines but the interrelationships between the three signalling pathways have not been fully clarified. This is an important issue as activated microglia are potential therapeutic target for amelioration of microglia mediated neuroinflammation. Here we show that blocking of Notch-1 with N-[(3,5-Difluorophenyl) acetyl]-L-alanyl-2-phenylglycine-1,1-dimethylethyl ester (DAPT) in LPS activated BV-2 microglia not only suppressed Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and Hes-1 protein expression, but also that of GSK-3β. Conversely, blocking of the latter with lithium chloride (LiCl) decreased NICD expression in a dose-dependent manner; moreover, Hes-1 immunofluorescence was attenuated. Along with this, the protein expression level of p-GSK-3β and p-AKT protein expression was significantly increased. Furthermore, DAPT and LiCl decreased production of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, iNOS, Cox2 and MCP-1; however, IL-10 expression was increased notably in LiCl treated cells. The effects of DAPT and LiCl on changes of the above-mentioned biomarkers were confirmed by immunofluorescence in both BV-2 and primary microglia. Additionally, NF-κB/p65 immunofluorescence was attenuated by DAPT and LiCl; as opposed to this, IκBα protein expression was increased. Taken together, it is suggested that Notch-1, NF-κB/p65 and GSK-3β operate in synergy to inhibit microglia activation. This may be effected via increased expression of phospho-GSK-3β (p-GSK-3β), phospho-protein kinase B (PKB) (p-AKT) and IκBα. It is concluded that the three signalling pathways are functionally interlinked in regulating microglia activation."
https://openalex.org/W2765634926,"Because the tropical regions of America harbor the highest concentration of butterfly species, its fauna has attracted considerable attention. Much less is known about the butterflies of southern South America, particularly Argentina, where over 1,200 species occur. To advance understanding of this fauna, we assembled a DNA barcode reference library for 417 butterfly species of Argentina, focusing on the Atlantic Forest, a biodiversity hotspot. We tested the efficacy of this library for specimen identification, used it to assess the frequency of cryptic species, and examined geographic patterns of genetic variation, making this study the first large-scale genetic assessment of the butterflies of southern South America. The average sequence divergence to the nearest neighbor (i.e. minimum interspecific distance) was 6.91%, ten times larger than the mean distance to the furthest conspecific (0.69%), with a clear barcode gap present in all but four of the species represented by two or more specimens. As a consequence, the DNA barcode library was extremely effective in the discrimination of these species, allowing a correct identification in more than 95% of the cases. Singletons (i.e. species represented by a single sequence) were also distinguishable in the gene trees since they all had unique DNA barcodes, divergent from those of the closest non-conspecific. The clustering algorithms implemented recognized from 416 to 444 barcode clusters, suggesting that the actual diversity of butterflies in Argentina is 3%–9% higher than currently recognized. Furthermore, our survey added three new records of butterflies for the country (Eurema agave, Mithras hannelore, Melanis hillapana). In summary, this study not only supported the utility of DNA barcoding for the identification of the butterfly species of Argentina, but also highlighted several cases of both deep intraspecific and shallow interspecific divergence that should be studied in more detail."
https://openalex.org/W2765195981,"TGFbeta induces fibrogenic responses in fibroblasts. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) may contribute to fibrogenic responses. Here, we examine if the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC), the NOX inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) and the selective NOX1/NOX4 inhibitor GKT-137831 impairs the ability of TGFbeta to induce profibrotic gene expression in human gingival (HGF) and dermal (HDF) fibroblasts. We also assess if GKT-137831 can block the persistent fibrotic phenotype of lesional scleroderma (SSc) fibroblasts. We use real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis to evaluate whether NAC and DPI impair the ability of TGFbeta1 to induce expression of fibrogenic genes in fibroblasts. The effects of GKT-137831 on TGFbeta-induced protein expression and the persistent fibrotic phenotype of lesional scleroderma (SSc) fibroblasts were tested using Western blot and collagen gel contraction analyses. In HDF and HGF, TGFbeta1 induces CCN2, CCN1, endothelin-1 and alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA) in a fashion sensitive to NAC. Induction of COL1A1 mRNA was unaffected. Similar results were seen with DPI. NAC and DPI impaired the ability of TGFbeta1 to induce protein expression of CCN2 and alpha-SMA in HDF and HGF. GKT-137831 impaired TGFbeta-induced CCN2 and alpha-SMA protein expression in HGF and HDF. In lesional SSc dermal fibroblasts, GKT-137831 reduced alpha-SMA and CCN2 protein overexpression and collagen gel contraction. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that antioxidants or NOX1/4 inhibition may be useful in blocking profibrotic effects of TGFbeta on dermal and gingival fibroblasts and warrant consideration for further development as potential antifibrotic agents."

However, literature regarding how far changes in clinical guidelines for pre- and in-hospital trauma management and diagnostic procedures affect the outcome of multiple injured patients with severe chest injury during a long-term observation period is sparse. Methods Multiple traumatised patients (age≥16y) documented in the TraumaRegister DGU® (TR-DGU) from January 1st 2005 to December 31st 2014 with severe chest trauma (AIS≥3) were included in this study. Demographic data, the pattern of injury, injury severity, radiographic emergency procedures, indication for intubation, duration of mechanical ventilation, emergency surgery, occurrence of complications and mortality were evaluated per year and over time. Results A total of 16,773 patients were analysed. The use of whole body computer tomography increased (p<0.001), while the incidence of plain x-rays decreased (p<0.001). Furthermore, incidence of AISThorax = 3 graded injuries increased (p<0.001) while AISThorax = 4 decreased (p<0.001). Both, rate of patients being intubated at the time of ICU admission decreased (p<0.001) and the time of mechanical ventilation decreased (p<0.001). Additionally, need for emergency surgery, lung failure, sepsis, and multi organ failure all decreased (p<0.001). However, mortality remained unchanged. Interpretation Severity of severe chest trauma and associated complications decreased while diagnostics and treatment improved over time. However, mortality remained unchanged. Our results are in line with those expected in the context of the incidence of CT diagnostics, which has increased parallel to the clinical outcome Thus, our data demonstrate a positive trend in the treatment of patients with severe chest trauma."
https://openalex.org/W2765992340,"We used eye-tracking to investigate if and when children show an incremental bias to assume that the first noun phrase in a sentence is the agent (first-NP-as-agent bias) while processing the meaning of English active and passive transitive sentences. We also investigated whether children can override this bias to successfully distinguish active from passive sentences, after processing the remainder of the sentence frame. For this second question we used eye-tracking (Study 1) and forced-choice pointing (Study 2). For both studies, we used a paradigm in which participants simultaneously saw two novel actions with reversed agent-patient relations while listening to active and passive sentences. We compared English-speaking 25-month-olds and 41-month-olds in between-subjects sentence structure conditions (Active Transitive Condition vs. Passive Condition). A permutation analysis found that both age groups showed a bias to incrementally map the first noun in a sentence onto an agent role. Regarding the second question, 25-month-olds showed some evidence of distinguishing the two structures in the eye-tracking study. However, the 25-month-olds did not distinguish active from passive sentences in the forced choice pointing task. In contrast, the 41-month-old children did reanalyse their initial first-NP-as-agent bias to the extent that they clearly distinguished between active and passive sentences both in the eye-tracking data and in the pointing task. The results are discussed in relation to the development of syntactic (re)parsing."
https://openalex.org/W2766646122,"European freshwater ecosystems have undergone significant human-induced and environmentally-driven variations in nutrient export from catchments throughout the past five decades, mainly in connection with changes in land-use, agricultural practice, waste water production and treatment, and climatic conditions. We analysed the relations among concentration of total phosphorus (TP) in the Slapy Reservoir (a middle reservoir of the Vltava River Cascade, Czechia), and socio-economic and climatic factors from 1963 to 2015. The study was based on a time series analysis, using conventional statistical tools, and the identification of breaking points, using a segmented regression. Results indicated clear long-term trends and seasonal patterns of TP, with annual average TP increasing up until 1991 and decreasing from 1992 to 2015. Trends in annual, winter and spring average TP concentrations reflected a shift in development of sewerage and sanitary infrastructure, agricultural application of fertilizers, and livestock production in the early 1990s that was associated with changes from the planned to the market economy. No trends were observed for average TP in autumn. The summer average TP has fluctuated with increased amplitude since 1991 in connection with recent climate warming, changes in thermal stratification stability, increased water flow irregularities, and short-circuiting of TP-rich inflow during high flow events. The climate-change-induced processes confound the generally declining trend in lake-water TP concentration and can result in eutrophication despite decreased phosphorus loads from the catchment. Our findings indicate the need of further reduction of phosphorus sources to meet ecological quality standards of the EU Water Framework Directive because the climate change may lead to a greater susceptibility of the aquatic ecosystem to the supply of nutrients."
https://openalex.org/W2765195627,"Femtosecond laser has been proposed as a method for conditioning zirconia surfaces to boost bond strength. However, metallic or ceramic bracket bonding to femtosecond laser-treated zirconia surfaces has not been tested. This study compared the effects of four conditioning techniques, including femtosecond laser irradiation, on shear bond strength (SBS) of metallic and ceramic brackets to zirconia.Three hundred zirconia plates were divided into five groups: 1) control (C); 2) sandblasting (APA); 3) silica coating and silane (SC); 4) femtosecond laser (FS); 5) sandblasting followed by femtosecond laser (APA+SC). A thermal imaging camera measured temperature changes in the zirconia during irradiation. Each group was divided into 2 subgroups (metallic vs ceramic brackets). SBS was evaluated using a universal testing machine. The adhesive remnant index (ARI) was registered and surfaces were observed under SEM. Surface treatment and bracket type significantly affected the bracket-zirconia bond strength. SBS was significantly higher (p<0.001) for ceramic brackets in all groups (APA+FS > APA > FS > SC > control) than metallic brackets (APA+FS > FS > SC > APA > control). For metallic brackets, groups SC (5.99 ± 1.86 MPa), FS (6.72 ± 2.30 MPa) and APA+FS (7.22 ± 2.73 MPa) reported significantly higher bond strengths than other groups (p < 0.05). For ceramic brackets, the highest bond strength values were obtained in groups APA (25.01 ± 4.45 MPa), FS (23.18 ± 6.51 MPa) and APA+FS (29.22 ± 8.20 MPa).Femtosecond laser enhances bond strength of ceramic and metallic brackets to zirconia. Ceramic brackets provide significantly stronger adhesion than metallic brackets regardless of the surface treatment method."

The duodenal fluids were analyzed by pyrosequencing (average of 32,000 reads/sample, read length of 500 nucleotides). After diagnosis, the duodenal microbiota of subjects with ulcerative colitis (N = 8) or Crohn's disease (N = 5), and non-IBD controls (N = 8) were compared.Pyrosequencing revealed that the duodenal microbiota of children with ulcerative colitis contained fewer Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) per individual than the duodenal microbiota of the controls (P = 0.005). This reduction in richness of the duodenal microbiota was seen for three major phyla: Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. Several bacterial genera were detected less frequently in the children with ulcerative colitis than in the non-IBD controls, including Collinsella (P = 0.001), Lactobacillus (P = 0.007), and Bacillus (P = 0.007), as well as a non-identified member of the order Sphingobacteriales (P = 0.007).In this pilot study, we show that the duodenal microbiota of children with ulcerative colitis exhibits reduced overall richness, despite the fact that the inflammation is primarily localized to the colon.

https://openalex.org/W2765406892,"Loss of muscle mass and strength represents one of the most significant contributors to impaired function in older adults. Convenient and non-invasive biomarkers are needed that can readily identify and track age-related muscle change. Previous data has suggested electrical impedance myography (EIM) has the potential to serve in this capacity. In this study we investigated how changes in EIM compared with other standard measures of muscle structure and function in aged compared with young mice. A total of 19 male mice aged approximately 25 months and 19 male mice aged 3 months underwent surface multifrequency EIM of the right gastrocnemius muscle using standard methods. Fore and hind limb grip strength, sciatic compound muscle action potential amplitude, and in-situ force of the gastrocnemius were also measured; after sacrifice, gastrocnemius myofiber size was assessed using standard histology. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to investigate the association between EIM and muscle characteristics. EIM in aged animals demonstrated significantly lower 50 kHz impedance phase (p<0.001) and reactance (p<0.01) values as well as reduced multifrequency parameters. In contrast, absolute gastrocnemius muscle mass was no different between young and aged mice (p = 0.58) but was reduced in aged mice after normalization to body mass (p<0.001). Median myofiber size in the aged mice was not different from that of young mice (p = 0.72). Aged mice showed reduced muscle function on the basis of normalized fore limb (p<0.001) and normalized hind limb (p<0.001) grip strength, as well as normalized gastrocnemius twitch (p<0.001) and normalized maximal isometric force (p<0.001). Sciatic compound muscle action potential amplitude was reduced in aged mice (p<0.05). EIM parameters showed good correlation with reduced standard physiological and electrophysiological measures of muscle health. Our study suggests that EIM is sensitive to aged-related muscle change and may represent a convenient and valuable method of quantifying loss of muscle health."
https://openalex.org/W2766491299,"The Swedish Register of Palliative Care (SRPC) is a national quality register that collects data about end-of-life care from healthcare providers that care for dying patients. Data are used for quality control and research. Data are mainly collected with an end-of-life questionnaire (ELQ), which is completed by healthcare staff after the death of a patient. A previous validity assessment of the ELQ showed insufficient validity in some items including symptom relief. The aim of this study was to examine the validity of the revised ELQ.Data from 100 consecutive patients' medical records at two specialised palliative care units were used to complete new ELQs, which were then compared to the ELQ registrations from the SRPC for the same patients. The level of agreement was calculated for each ELQ item. To account for the possibility of the agreement occurring by chance, Cohen's kappa was calculated for suitable items. To examine the extent of registration mistakes when transferring the paper form to the web, the original paper versions of the ELQ filled out at the units were compared to data from the ELQs reported to the SRPC.Level of agreement between ELQ registrations from the SRPC and the new ELQs based on the medical records varied between 0.55 and 1.00, where 24 items showed level of agreement above 0.80 and 9 items showed level of agreement below 0.80. Cohen's kappa with 95% confidence intervals was calculated for 24 items. The kappa values showed that two items had poor agreement, four fair agreement, 11 moderate agreement, five good agreement and two very good agreement. The level of agreement varied between 0.93 and 1.00 when comparing the ELQ registrations in the SRPC and the paper forms.The revised ELQ contains more items with high levels of agreement between registrations in the SRPC and notes in the patients' medical records when compared to the previous version. Validating issues around symptom assessment remains a challenge in our model of quality assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2765933014,"Cyclooxygenase (COX) is the rate-limiting enzyme in prostaglandins (PGs) biosynthesis. Previous studies indicate that COX-2, one of the isoforms of COX, is highly expressed in colon cancers and plays a key role in colon cancer carcinogenesis. Thus, searching for novel transcription factors regulating COX-2 expression will facilitate drug development for colon cancer. In this study, we identified XRCC5 as a binding protein of the COX-2 gene promoter in colon cancer cells with streptavidin-agarose pulldown assay and mass spectrometry analysis, and found that XRCC5 promoted colon cancer growth through modulation of COX-2 signaling. Knockdown of XRCC5 by siRNAs inhibited the growth of colon cancer cells in vitro and of tumor xenografts in a mouse model in vivo by suppressing COX-2 promoter activity and COX-2 protein expression. Conversely, overexpression of XRCC5 promoted the growth of colon cancer cells by activating COX-2 promoter and increasing COX-2 protein expression. Moreover, the role of p300 (a transcription co-activator) in acetylating XRCC5 to co-regulate COX-2 expression was also evaluated. Immunofluorescence assay and confocal microscopy showed that XRCC5 and p300 proteins were co-located in the nucleus of colon cancer cells. Co-immunoprecipitation assay also proved the interaction between XRCC5 and p300 in nuclear proteins of colon cancer cells. Cell viability assay indicated that the overexpression of wild-type p300, but not its histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain deletion mutant, increased XRCC5 acetylation, thereby up-regulated COX-2 expression and promoted the growth of colon cancer cells. In contrast, suppression of p300 by a p300 HAT-specific inhibitor (C646) inhibited colon cancer cell growth by suppressing COX-2 expression. Taken together, our results demonstrated that XRCC5 promoted colon cancer growth by cooperating with p300 to regulate COX-2 expression, and suggested that the XRCC5/p300/COX-2 signaling pathway was a potential target in the treatment of colon cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2274398059,"We propose a novel method for multiple clustering that assumes a co-clustering structure (partitions in both rows and columns of the data matrix) in each view. The new method is applicable to high-dimensional data. It is based on a nonparametric Bayesian approach in which the number of views and the number of feature-/subject clusters are inferred in a data-driven manner. We simultaneously model different distribution families, such as Gaussian, Poisson, and multinomial distributions in each cluster block. This makes our method applicable to datasets consisting of both numerical and categorical variables, which biomedical data typically do. Clustering solutions are based on variational inference with mean field approximation. We apply the proposed method to synthetic and real data, and show that our method outperforms other multiple clustering methods both in recovering true cluster structures and in computation time. Finally, we apply our method to a depression dataset with no true cluster structure available, from which useful inferences are drawn about possible clustering structures of the data."

At the conclusion of the experiment, the level of colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and the serum levels of the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) were measured.Administration of 3% DSS for 7 days successfully induced acute colitis associated with diarrhea, bloody mucopurulent stool, body weight decreases, and other changes. Colitis severity was significantly ameliorated in the IMQ treatment groups, as determined by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and histopathological scores. Moreover, IMQ significantly reduced the activity of MPO in colonic tissue and the serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, increased colon length and spleen weight, and effectively inhibited microscopic damage to the colon tissue.IMQ had beneficial effects on DSS-induced ulcerative colitis, supporting its further development and clinical application in ulcerative colitis."
https://openalex.org/W2766489239,"A growing body of evidence points to relationships between insomnia, negative affect, and paranoid thinking. However, studies are needed to examine (i) whether negative affect mediates the relation between insomnia and paranoid thinking, (ii) whether different types of insomnia exert different effects on paranoia, and (iii) to compare the impact of objective and self-reported sleeping difficulties.Structural equation modelling was therefore used to test competing models of the relationships between self-reported insomnia, negative affect, and paranoia. n = 348 participants completed measures of insomnia, negative affect and paranoia. A subset of these participants (n = 91) went on to monitor their sleep objectively (using a portable sleep monitor made by Zeo) for seven consecutive nights. Associations between objectively recorded sleep, negative affect, and paranoia were explored using linear regression.The findings supported a fully mediated model where self-reported delayed sleep onset, but not self-reported problems with sleep maintenance or objective measures of sleep, was directly associated with negative affect that, in turn, was associated with paranoia. There was no evidence of a direct association between delayed sleep onset or sleep maintenance problems and paranoia.Taken together, the findings point to an association between perceived (but not objective) difficulties initially falling asleep (but not maintaining sleep) and paranoid thinking; a relationship that is fully mediated by negative affect. Future research should seek to disentangle the causal relationships between sleep, negative affect, and paranoia (e.g., by examining the effect of an intervention using prospective designs that incorporate experience sampling). Indeed, interventions might profitably target (i) perceived sleep quality, (ii) sleep onset, and / or (iii) emotion regulation as a route to reducing negative affect and, thus, paranoid thinking."
https://openalex.org/W2766591053,"The role of extrinsic mortality in shaping life histories is poorly understood. However, substantial evidence suggests that extrinsic mortality interacts with density-dependence in crucial ways. We develop a model combining Evolutionarily Stable Strategies with a projection matrix that allows resource allocation to growth, tissue repairs, and reproduction. Our model examines three cases, with density-dependence acting on: (i) mortality, (ii) fecundity, and (iii) production rate. We demonstrate that density-independent extrinsic mortality influences the rate of aging, age at maturity, growth rate, and adult size provided that density-dependence acts on fertility or juvenile mortality. However, density-independent extrinsic mortality has no effect on these life history traits when density-dependence acts on survival. We show that extrinsic mortality interacts with density-dependence via a compensation mechanism: the higher the extrinsic mortality the lower the strength of density-dependence. However, this compensation fully offsets the effect of extrinsic mortality only if density-dependence acts on survival independently of age. Both the age-pattern and the type of density-dependence are crucial for shaping life history traits."
https://openalex.org/W2765717025,"The production of lignocellulosic-derived biofuels is a highly promising source of alternative energy, but it has been constrained by the lack of a microbial platform capable to efficiently degrade this recalcitrant material and cope with by-products that can be toxic to cells. Species that naturally grow in environments where carbon is mainly available as lignin are promising for finding new ways of removing the lignin that protects cellulose for improved conversion of lignin to fuel precursors. Enterobacter lignolyticus SCF1 is a facultative anaerobic Gammaproteobacteria isolated from tropical rain forest soil collected in El Yunque forest, Puerto Rico under anoxic growth conditions with lignin as sole carbon source. Whole transcriptome analysis of SCF1 during E.lignolyticus SCF1 lignin degradation was conducted on cells grown in the presence (0.1%, w/w) and the absence of lignin, where samples were taken at three different times during growth, beginning of exponential phase, mid-exponential phase and beginning of stationary phase. Lignin-amended cultures achieved twice the cell biomass as unamended cultures over three days, and in this time degraded 60% of lignin. Transcripts in early exponential phase reflected this accelerated growth. A complement of laccases, aryl-alcohol dehydrogenases, and peroxidases were most up-regulated in lignin amended conditions in mid-exponential and early stationary phases compared to unamended growth. The association of hydrogen production by way of the formate hydrogenlyase complex with lignin degradation suggests a possible value added to lignin degradation in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2765666763,"Mutations in the NPHS2 gene, encoding podocin, cause hereditary nephrotic syndrome. The most common podocin mutation, R138Q, is associated with early disease onset and rapid progression to end-stage renal disease. Knock-in mice carrying a R140Q mutation, the mouse analogue of human R138Q, show developmental arrest of podocytes and lethal renal failure at neonatal age. Here we created a conditional podocin knock-in model named NPHS2 R140Q/-, using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase, which permits to study the effects of the mutation in postnatal life. Within the first week of R140Q hemizygosity induction the animals developed proteinuria, which peaked after 4-5 weeks. Subsequently the animals developed progressive renal failure, with a median survival time of 12 (95% CI: 11-13) weeks. Foot process fusion was observed within one week, progressing to severe and global effacement in the course of the disease. The number of podocytes per glomerulus gradually diminished to 18% compared to healthy controls 12-16 weeks after induction. The fraction of segmentally sclerosed glomeruli was 25%, 85% and 97% at 2, 4 and 8 weeks, respectively. Severe tubulointerstitial fibrosis was present at later disease stage and was correlated quantitatively with the level of proteinuria at early disease stages. While R140Q podocin mRNA expression was elevated, protein abundance was reduced by more than 50% within one week following induction. Whereas miRNA21 expression persistently increased during the first 4 weeks, miRNA-193a expression peaked 2 weeks after induction. In conclusion, the inducible R140Q-podocin mouse model is an auspicious model of the most common genetic cause of human nephrotic syndrome, with a spontaneous disease course strongly reminiscent of the human disorder. This model constitutes a valuable tool to test the efficacy of novel pharmacological interventions aimed to improve podocyte function and viability and attenuate proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis and progressive renal failure."
https://openalex.org/W2765847570,"Truncated hemoglobins constitute a large family, present in bacteria, in archaea and in eukaryotes. However, a majority of physiological functions of these proteins remains to be elucidated. Identification and characterization of a novel role of truncated hemoglobins in the model alga provides a framework for a more complete understanding of their biological functions. Here, we use quantitative RT-PCR to show that three truncated hemoglobins of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, THB1, THB2 and THB12, are induced under conditions of depleted sulfur (S) supply. THB1 underexpression results in the decrease in cell size, as well in levels of proteins, chlorophylls and mRNA of several S-responsive genes under S starvation. We provide evidence that knock-down of THB1 enhances NO production under S deprivation. In S-deprived cells, a subset of S limitation-responsive genes is controlled by NO in THB1-dependent pathway. Moreover, we demonstrate that deficiency for S represses the nitrate reduction and that THB1 is involved in this control. Thus, our data support the idea that in S-deprived cells THB1 plays a dual role in NO detoxification and in coordinating sulfate limitation with nitrate assimilation. This study uncovers a new function for the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii THB1 in the control of proper response to S deprivation."

Thus, neotropical specimens previously identified as P. dictyopus from Amazonia, Cerrado and Atlantic Forest biomes were studied based on detailed macro- and micromorphological examination and phylogenetic analyses, using distinct ribosomal and protein-coding genomic regions: the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (nrITS), nuclear ribosomal large subunit (nrLSU), and RNA polymerase II second subunit (RPB2). Two unrelated generic lineages, each one represented by different species, are reported: Atroporus is recovered and re-circumscribed to include A. diabolicus and A. rufoatratus comb. nov.; Neodictyopus gen. nov. is proposed to accommodate N. dictyopus comb. nov. and two new species, N. atlanticae and N. gugliottae.

https://openalex.org/W2766875196,"Gut microbiota play an important role in human immunological processes, potentially affecting allergic diseases such as eczema. The diversity and structure of gut microbiota in infants with eczema have been previously documented. This study aims to evaluate by comparative metagenomics differences in genetic content in gut microbiota of infants with eczema and their matched controls. Stools were collected at the age of one month old from twelve infants from an at risk birth cohort in a case control manner. Clinical follow up for atopic outcomes were carried out at the age of 12 and 24 months. Microbial genomic DNA were extracted from stool samples and used for shotgun sequencing. Comparative metagenomic analysis showed that immune-regulatory TCAAGCTTGA motifs were significantly enriched in the six healthy controls (C) communities compared to the six eczema subjects (E), with many encoded by Bifidobacterium (38% of the total motifs in the C communities). Draft genomes of five Bifidobacterium species populations (B. longum, B. bifidum, B. breve, B. dentium, and B. pseudocatenulatum) were recovered from metagenomic datasets. The B. longum BFN-121-2 genome encoded more TCAAGCTTGA motifs (4.2 copies per one million genome sequence) than other Bifidobacterium genomes. Additionally, the communities in the stool of controls (C) were also significantly enriched in functions associated with tetrapyrrole biosynthesis compared to those of eczema (E). Our results show distinct immune-modulatory genomic properties of gut microbiota in infants associated with eczema and provide new insights into potential role of gut microbiota in affecting human immune homeostasis."

https://openalex.org/W2767161411,"Objectives To determine the differences in pupillary light reflex (PLR) between the acute and chronic phases of optic neuritis (ON) and nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). Methods The study included 30 patients with ON and 22 patients with NAION whose PLR were measured by a dynamic pupillometer (PLR-200; NeurOptics Inc., Irvine, USA). Age-matched controls included 58 healthy individuals with normal vision and optic nerve function. Pupil diameters, latency, constriction ratio, constriction velocity and dilation velocity were noted. The differences in PLR measurements were compared among the acute and chronic phases of ON and NAION, and in age-matched controls. Regression analysis determined factors associated with PLR measurements, including visual acuity, color vision defect, visual field defects and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness measurements on optical coherence tomography. Results Pupillary constriction velocity, constriction ratio and latency were all significantly decreased in the acute phase of ON and NAION. ON showed significantly delayed constriction latency compared to NAION (P = 0.047). Pupillary constriction velocity, constriction ratio and latency were recovered in the chronic phase of ON (P = 0.038, 0.018, and 0.045), however, these parameters were not recovered in NAION (P = 0.693, 0.173 and 0.994). Conclusions Pupillary constriction velocity, constriction ratio, and latency were significantly decreased in the acute phase of ON and NAION compared to normal controls. ON showed delayed constriction latency compared to NAION. Decreased PLR were recovered in the chronic phase of ON, but not in NAION."

This study was aimed at determining the incidence of virological failure and acquired drug resistance mutations overtime and identifying the most common mutational pathways of resistance in a well characterized HIV-1C infected Ethiopian cohort. Methods A total of 320 patients (220 ART naïve and 100 on first lines ART) were included and followed. ART initiation and patients’ monitoring was based on the WHO clinical and immunological parameters. HIV viral load measurement and genotypic drug resistance testing were done at baseline (T0-2008) and after on average at a median time of 30 months on ART at three time points (T1-2011, T2-2013, T3-2015). Findings The incidence of virological failure has increased overtime from 11 at T1 to 17 at T2 and then to 30% at T3. At all time point’s almost all of the patients with virological failure and accumulated drug resistance mutations had not met the WHO clinical and immunologic failure criteria and continued the failing regimen. A steep increase in the incidence and accumulation of major acquired NRTI and NNRTI drug resistance mutations have been observed (from 40% at T1 to 64% at T2 and then to 66% at T3). The most frequent NRTIs drug resistance associated mutations are mainly the lamivudine-induced mutation M184V which was detected in 4 patients at T1 and showed a 2 fold increase in the following time points (T2: n = 8) and at (T3: n = 12) and the thymidine analogue mutations (such as D67N, K70R and K219E) which were not-detected at baseline T0 and T1 but were increased progressively to 10 at T2 and to 17 at T3. The most frequent NNRTIs associated mutations were K103N, V106M and Y188C. Conclusions An upward trend in the incidence of virological failure and accumulation of NRTI and NNRTI associated acquired antiretroviral drug resistance mutations are observed. The data suggest the need for virological monitoring, resistance testing for early detection of failure and access for TDF and PI containing drugs. Population-level and patient targeted interventions to prevent the spread of mutant variants is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2766574527,"Smoking is a major risk factor of cardiovascular disease (CVD) such as stroke and ischemic heart disease. Prior studies have observed people continued smoking even after being diagnosed with CVD. However, population-level data regarding smoking behavior changes among people who are diagnosed with CVD are still lacking. From the National Health Insurance sample cohort database, we identified 1,700 patients diagnosed as having CVD between 2003 and 2012, and underwent the national health screening examination in the year before and after the CVD event. We found that 486 (28.6%) were smokers before the CVD event. Among them, 240 (49.4%) continued to smoke despite the diagnosis. We observed that a higher smoking amount and longer smoking duration before the diagnosis were associated with persistent smoking. Our finding that approximately 50% of smokers continue smoking even after CVD events supports the need for an assessment of patients’ smoking statuses during follow-up after a CVD event and for health-care providers to offer the appropriate smoking cessation interventions to those who continue smoking."
https://openalex.org/W2765756910,"Purpose This study introduces a novel way to accurately assess gait quality. This new method called Multifeature Gait Score (MGS) is based on the computation of multiple parameters characterizing six aspects of gait (temporal, amplitude, variability, regularity, symmetry and complexity) quantified with one inertial sensor. According to the aspects described, parameters were aggregated into partial scores to indicate the altered aspect in the case of abnormal patterns. In order to evaluate the overall gait quality, partial scores were averaged to a global score. Methods The MGS was computed for 3 groups namely: healthy adult (10 subjects), sedentary elderly (11 subjects) and active elderly (20 subjects). Data were gathered from an inertial sensor located at the lumbar region during two sessions of 12m walking. Results The results based on ANOVA and Tukey tests showed that the partial scores with the exception of those which describe the symmetry aspect were able to discriminate between groups (p<0.05). This significant difference was also confirmed by the global score which shows a significantly lower value for the sedentary elderly group (3.58 ±1.15) compared to the healthy adults (5.19 ±0.84) and active elderly (4.82 ±1.26). In addition, the intersession repeatability of the elaborated global score was excellent (ICC = 0.93, % SEM = 10.81). Conclusion The results obtained support the reliability and the relevance of the MGS as a novel method to characterize gait quality."

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of diacerein vs. placebo on urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and inflammatory cytokines in type 2 DM participants with CKD. Blood pressure (BP) and metabolic control were secondary outcomes. This randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel trial of adjuvant treatment of type 2 DM with diacerein enrolled seventy-two participants with CKD, aged 30–80 years, with glycated hemoglobin levels from 53–97 mmol/mol (7.0–11.0%), receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and antidiabetic agents. Participants randomized to diacerein or placebo were followed-up up to 90 days. Both groups had a marked reduction in ACR, but there was no effect on glomerular filtration rate. While the diacerein group had reduced TNF-α levels at the 75th percentile with a borderline significance (P = 0.05), there were no changes in the IL levels at the 75th percentile. Diacerein prevented the increase in blood glucose to the level observed in the placebo group (P = 0.04), improving metabolic control by 74%, reducing 24-hour diastolic BP, nighttime systolic and diastolic BP compared to the placebo group. In conclusion, among patients with type 2 DM and CKD, diacerein does not have an effect on ACR or GFR, but slows metabolic control deterioration and is associated with lower nighttime systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

The ME was treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents. At baseline and at 1 and 6 months after initiation of treatment, quantitative measurements of metamorphopsia were performed using M-CHARTS and the retinal morphologic changes were examined by optical coherence tomography. At baseline, metamorphopsia was detected on M-CHARTS in 14 (50.0%) eyes. The mean M-CHARTS score was 0.37 ± 0.53. At 1 month and 6 months after initiation of treatment, there was substantial resolution of ME and significant recovery of visual acuity. In contrast, metamorphopsia was still detected in 16 eyes at 6 months; the mean M-CHARTS scores were 0.29 ± 0.37 at 1 month and 0.32 ± 0.38 at 6 months, and had not significantly improved from baseline (p = 0.580, and p = 0.604, respectively). Although the M-CHARTS score at 6 months was associated with the baseline M-CHARTS score (p = 0.004), it did not have any associations with morphologic parameters at baseline. However, the M-CHARTS score at 6 months was significantly associated with foveal photoreceptor status, height of serous detachment, and parafoveal thickening at 1 month. Metamorphopsia associated with CRVO could be quantified using M-CHARTS, and often persisted in contrast with the recovery of visual acuity and resolution of ME after treatment with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents."

Of the seven major MTBC lineages in the world, lineage 1 (Indo-Oceanic) mostly corresponds to the East African-Indian (EAI) spoligotype family in East Africa and Southeast Asia.We investigated the genomic features of Vietnamese lineage 1 strains, comparing spoligotype patterns using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data.M. tuberculosis strains isolated in Da Nang, Vietnam were subjected to conventional spoligotyping, followed by WGS analysis using a high-throughput sequencer. Vietnamese lineage 1 strains were further analyzed with other lineage 1 strains obtained from a public database.Indicating a major spoligotype in Da Nang, 86 (46.2%) of the 186 isolates belonged to the EAI family or lineage 1. Although typical EAI4-VNM strains are characterized by the deletion of spacers 26 and 27, 65 (75.6%) showed ambiguous signals on spacer 26. De novo assembly of the entire DR region and in silico spoligotyping analysis suggested the absence of spacer 26, and direct sequencing revealed that the 17th spacer sequence not used for conventional typing, was cross-hybridized to the spacer 26 probe. Vietnamese EAI4-VNM, other EAI-like strains, and those showing a non-EAI pattern lacking many spacers formed a monophyletic group separate from other EAI families in the world.Information about the alignment of spacers in the entire DR region obtained from WGS data provides a clue for the determination of experimentally ambiguous spoligo patterns. WGS data also helped to analyze the hidden relationships between apparently distinct spoligo patterns."

At present, feline parvovirus (FPV) and canine parvovirus (CPV) variants are the pathogens of feline panleukopenia. Many studies have shown that miRNAs are involved in virus-host interactions. Nevertheless, miRNA expression profiling of FPV (original virus) or CPV-2b (new virus) in cats has not been reported. To investigate these profiles, three 10-week-old cats were orally inoculated with 106 TCID50 of the viruses (FPV and CPV-2b), and the jejunums of one cat in each group were sectioned for miRNA sequencing at 5 days post-inoculation (dpi). This study is the first attempt to use miRNA analysis to understand the molecular basis of FPV and CPV infection in cats. The miRNA expression profiles of the jejunums of cats infected with FPV and CPV were obtained, and a subset of miRNAs was validated by real-time qPCR. The results show that a variety of metabolism-related pathways, cytokine- and pathogen-host interaction-related pathways, and pathology- and cellar structure-related pathways, as well as others, were affected. Specifically, the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which is critical for cytokines and growth factors, was enriched. This description of the miRNAs involved in regulating FPV and CPV infection in vivo provides further insight into the mechanisms of viral infection and adaptation and might provide an alternative antiviral strategy for disease control and prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2765378466,"Previous studies have shown that phenotypic modulation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) plays a pivotal role in human diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the reversible differentiation of SMCs remain elusive particularly because cultured SMCs that reproducibly exhibit bidirectional phenotypic modulation have not been established. Here we established an immortalized human bladder SMC line designated as hBS11. Under differentiation-inducing conditions, hBS11 cells underwent smooth muscle differentiation accompanied by the robust expression of smooth muscle differentiation markers and isoform-dependent reorganization of actin bundles. The cholinergic receptor agonist carbachol increased intracellular calcium in differentiated hBS11 cells in an acetylcholine muscarinic receptor-dependent manner. Differentiated hBS11 cells displayed contractile properties depending on the elevation in the levels of intracellular calcium. Depolarization of membrane potential triggered inward sodium current in differentiated hBS11 cells. However, differentiated hBS11 cells lost the differentiated phenotype and resumed mitosis when re-fed with growth medium. Our study provides direct evidence pertaining to the human bladder SMCs being able to retain the capacity of reversible differentiation and that the reorganization of actin bundles is involved in the reinstatement of contractility. Moreover, we have established a human SMC line retaining high proliferating potential without compromising differentiation potential."
https://openalex.org/W2766489240,"The Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein encoded by the Rv1986 gene is a target for memory T cells in patients with tuberculosis, and shows strong similarities to a lysine exporter LysE of Corynebacterium glutamicum. During infection, the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis adapts its metabolism to environmental changes. In this study, we found that the expression of Rv1986 is controlled by Rv1985c. Rv1985c is located directly upstream of Rv1986 with an overlapping promoter region between both genes. Semiquantitative reverse transcription PCR using an isogenic mutant of Mycobacterium tuberculosis lacking Rv1985c showed that in the presence of lysine, Rv1985c protein positively upregulated the expression of Rv1986. RNA sequencing revealed the transcription start points for both transcripts and overlapping promoters. An inverted repeat in the center of the intergenic region was identified, and binding of Rv1985c protein to the intergenic region was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Whole transcriptome expression analysis and RNAsequencing showed downregulated transcription of ppsBCD in the Rv1985c-mutant compared to the wild type strain. Taken together, our findings characterize the regulatory network of Rv1985c in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Due to their similarity of an orthologous gene pair in Corynebacterium glutamicum, we suggest to rename Rv1985c to lysG(Mt), and Rv1986 to lysE(Mt)."
https://openalex.org/W2765289889,"Measurement of Emergency Obstetric Care capability is common, and measurement of newborn and overall routine childbirth care has begun in recent years. These assessments of facility capabilities can be used to identify geographic inequalities in access to functional health services and to monitor improvements over time. This paper develops an approach for monitoring the childbirth environment that accounts for the delivery caseload of the facility.We used data from the Kenya Service Provision Assessment to examine facility capability to provide quality childbirth care, including infrastructure, routine maternal and newborn care, and emergency obstetric and newborn care. A facility was considered capable of providing a function if necessary tracer items were present and, for emergency functions, if the function had been performed in the previous three months. We weighted facility capability by delivery caseload, and compared results with those generated using traditional ""survey weights"".Of the 403 facilities providing childbirth care, the proportion meeting criteria for capability were: 13% for general infrastructure, 6% for basic emergency obstetric care, 3% for basic emergency newborn care, 13% and 11% for routine maternal and newborn care, respectively. When the new caseload weights accounting for delivery volume were applied, capability improved and the proportions of deliveries occurring in a facility meeting capability criteria were: 51% for general infrastructure, 46% for basic emergency obstetric care, 12% for basic emergency newborn care, 36% and 18% for routine maternal and newborn care, respectively. This is because most of the caseload was in hospitals, which generally had better capability. Despite these findings, fewer than 2% of deliveries occurred in a facility capable of providing all functions.Reporting on the percentage of facilities capable of providing certain functions misrepresents the capacity to provide care at the national level. Delivery caseload weights allow adjustment for patient volume, and shift the denominator of measurement from facilities to individual deliveries, leading to a better representation of the context in which facility births take place. These methods could lead to more standardized national datasets, enhancing their ability to inform policy at a national and international level."
https://openalex.org/W2766214791,"We introduce and use Wavelet Imaging on Multiple Scales (WIMS) as an improvement to fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to measure physical processes and features that occur across multiple length scales. In this study, wavelet transforms of cell images are used to characterize molecular dynamics at the cellular and subcellular levels (i.e. focal adhesions). We show the usefulness of the technique by applying WIMS to an image time series of a migrating osteosarcoma cell expressing fluorescently labelled adhesion proteins, which allows us to characterize different components of the cell ranging from optical resolution scale through to focal adhesion and whole cell size scales. Using WIMS we measured focal adhesion numbers, orientation and cell boundary velocities for retraction and protrusion. We also determine the internal dynamics of individual focal adhesions undergoing assembly, disassembly or elongation. Thus confirming as previously shown, WIMS reveals that the number of adhesions and the area of the protruding region of the cell are strongly correlated, establishing a correlation between protrusion size and adhesion dynamics. We also apply this technique to characterize the behavior of adhesions, actin and myosin in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing a mutant form of myosin IIB (1935D) that displays decreased filament stability and impairs front-back cell polarity. We find separate populations of actin and myosin at each adhesion pole for both the mutant and wild type form. However, we find these populations move rapidly inwards toward one another in the mutant case in contrast to the cells that express wild type myosin IIB where those populations remain stationary. Results obtained with these two systems demonstrate how WIMS has the potential to reveal novel correlations between chosen parameters that belong to different scales."

Number of pregnancies at the time of telomere length measurement was obtained (mean age = 41±0.1 years, average gravidity = 2.64±0.1 pregnancies). Participants were divided into 4 groups by number of pregnancies: 0, 1, 2-3, and ≥4, to test for differences in telomere length by gravidity group.The mean and SD for telomere length was 0.98 ± 0.20 T/S in the whole cohort. There were no differences in mean telomere length between groups; 0.98±0.02 T/S in women with 0 pregnancies, 1.01±0.02 T/S in women with 1 pregnancy, 0.97±0.01 T/S in women with 2-3 pregnancies, and 0.99±0.02 T/S in women with ≥4 pregnancies (p = 0.51). We defined high-risk (shorter) telomere length as ≤25th percentile, and low-risk (longer) telomere length as ≥75 percentile. There were no differences in the prevalence of high-risk or low-risk telomere length between gravidity groups.Gravidity was not associated with telomere length in early middle age; the protective association of 2-3 births may act through other mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2766760738,"High levels of gamma glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), as well as fatty liver index (FLI) has been associated with higher cardiovascular disease risk factors in adults. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between gamma-GT, ALT, and fatty liver index FLI levels across a gradient number of ideal cardiovascular health metrics in a representative sample of adults from the Chilean National Health Survey 2009–2010. Data from 1,023 men and 1,449 women (≥ 15 years) from the Chilean Health Survey 2009–2010 were analyzed. Ideal cardiovascular health was defined as meeting ideal levels of the following components: four behaviours (smoking, body mass index, physical activity and diet adherence) and three factors (total cholesterol, blood pressure and fasting glucose). Adults were grouped into three categories according to their number of ideal cardiovascular health metrics: ideal (5–7 metrics), intermediate (3–4 metrics), and poor (0–2 metrics). Blood levels of gamma-GT and ALT were measured and the FLI was calculated. A higher number of ideal cardiovascular health index metric was associated with lower gamma-GT, ALT and FLI (p from trend analysis <0.001). Also, adults meeting at least 3–4 metrics were predicted less likely to have prevalence of abnormal levels of gamma-GT and FLI (p<0.001) compared to adults who met only 0–2 metrics. These findings reinforce the usefulness of the ideal cardiovascular health metrics proposed by the American Heart Association as a tool to identify target subjects and promote cardiovascular health in South-American adults."
https://openalex.org/W2766794056,"Introduction Accurate measurement of adherence is necessary to ensure that therapeutic outcomes can be attributed to the recommended treatment. Phone-based unannounced pill counts were shown to be feasible and reliable measures of adherence in developed settings; and have been further used as part of medication adherence interventions. However, it is not clear whether this method can be implemented successfully in resource-limited settings, where cellular network and mobile phone coverage may be low. Our objective is to describe operational issues surrounding the use of phone-based unannounced pill counts in Lesotho and Ethiopia. Methods Phone-based monthly unannounced pill counts, using an adaptation of a standardized protocol from previous US-based studies, were utilized to measure anti-TB and antiretroviral medication adherence in two implementation science studies in resource-limited settings, START (Lesotho) and ENRICH (Ethiopia). Results In START, 19.6% of calls were completed, with 71.9% of participants reached at least once; majority of failed call attempts were due to phones not being available (54.8%) or because participants were away from the pills (32.7%). In ENRICH, 33.5% of calls were completed, with 86.7% of participants reached at least once; the main reasons for failed call attempts were phones being switched off (31.5%), participants not answering (27.3%), participants’ discomfort speaking on the phone (15.4%), and network problems (13.2%). Structural, facility-level, participant-level, and data collection challenges were encountered in these settings. Discussion Phone-based unannounced pill counts were found to be challenging, and response rates suboptimal. While some of these challenges were specific to local contexts, most of them are generalizable to resource-limited settings. In a research study context, a possible solution to ease operational challenges may be to focus phone-based unannounced pill count efforts on a randomly selected sample from participants who are provided with study phones and rigorously ensure that call attempts are made for these participants."
https://openalex.org/W2765771301,"The selectivity filter of the KcsA K+ channel has two typical conformations-the conductive and the collapsed conformations, respectively. The transition from the conductive to the collapsed filter conformation can represent the process of inactivation that depends on many environmental factors. Water molecules permeating behind the filter can influence the collapsed filter stability. Here we perform the molecular dynamics simulations to study the stability of the collapsed filter of the KcsA K+ channel under the different water patterns. We find that the water patterns are dynamic behind the collapsed filter and the filter stability increases with the increasing number of water molecules. In addition, the stability increases significantly when water molecules distribute uniformly behind the four monomeric filter chains, and the stability is compromised if water molecules only cluster behind one or two adjacent filter chains. The altered filter stabilities thus suggest that the collapsed filter can inactivate gradually under the dynamic water patterns. We also demonstrate how the different water patterns affect the filter recovery from the collapsed conformation."
https://openalex.org/W2766192037,"Many organisms, including the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), a toxicological model organism, establish social hierarchies. The social rank of each male in a population is under the control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis mainly through regulation of circulating androgen concentrations, which in turn drive the expression of secondary sex characteristics (SSCs). As dominant and subordinate males in an exposure study are initially under different physiological conditions (i.e., differing plasma androgen concentrations), we proposed that they belong to different subpopulations in the context of exposure to compounds that may interact with the HPG axis. Using a meta-analysis of our data from several previously published studies, we corroborated the hypothesis that social status, as indicated by SSCs, results in distinct clusters (eigenvalues >0.8 explaining >80% of variability) with differential expression of plasma vitellogenin, a commonly used biomarker of exposure to contaminants of emerging concern (CEC). Furthermore, we confirmed our predictions that exposure to estrogenic CECs would homogenize plasma vitellogenin response (E1: cluster mean SSC values decreased to 4.33 and 4.86 relative to those of control; E2: decreased to 4.8 and 5.37) across the social hierarchy. In contrast, serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors expand this response range (cluster mean SSC increased to 5.21 and 6.5 relative to those of control). Our results demonstrated that social hierarchies in male fathead minnows result in heterogeneous responses to chemical exposure. These results represent a cautionary note for the experimental design of single-sex exposure studies. We anticipate our study to be a starting point for the re-evaluation of toxicological data analyses in single sex exposure experiments."

The emails, written between October 2016 and February 2017, have come to light as some in Congress are pressuring NIH Director Francis Collins to renew the 3-year initiative, which has spent $18 million funding 22 research projects since January 2014, but which lapsed in January 2017. Last week, 26 Democrats and one Independent in the U.S. Senate wrote to Collins calling the need for more gun research critical after the 1 October murders of 58 people and the injury of nearly 500 people by a gunman in Las Vegas, Nevada."
https://openalex.org/W2765232672,"President Donald Trump9s nominee to lead the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is a wealthy businessman with no scientific expertise. That9s unusual for an agency traditionally led by administrators holding scientific doctorates. But Barry Myers, CEO of AccuWeather, the for-profit forecasting company in State College, Pennsylvania, is well-acquainted with one NOAA division: the National Weather Service (NWS), which provides free data and models to companies like AccuWeather. That background worries some agency insiders, but could also provide an opportunity to open the agency up to outside collaboration, some researchers say. If confirmed, Myers, who has spoken little on global warming, will lead a climate-focused agency that has faced proposed budget cuts from President Donald Trump9s administration, raising fears that NOAA9s best researchers could flee the agency."
https://openalex.org/W2765486659,"Congress has repeatedly told the U.S. Census Bureau not to let the next decennial census in 2020 exceed the $12.1 billion cost of the 2010 head count, a tall order given inflation and a growing population that9s harder to count. So the former census director, John Thompson, came up with a plan to modernize the census and save $5.2 billion, which he said would allow the agency to meet the target. But Thompson retired last summer, and last week Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told a congressional oversight panel that a new estimate puts the cost of the 2020 census at $15.6 billion. He said the prior administration provided Congress and the public with overly optimistic assessments of both the ease of implementing new technologies and the cost savings they would provide. Ross also pointed a finger at lawmakers, using the euphemism of appropriations constraints to describe how a Republican Congress has repeatedly cut former President Barack Obama9s proposed budgets for the Census Bureau, which is part of the Department of Commerce. Ross says the agency needs $187 million more this year than the $800 million President Donald Trump has requested. But many Democrats say the need is much greater. And social scientists who rely on census data say that a flawed tally will undermine the credibility not only of the Census Bureau, but also the entire federal statistical enterprise."
https://openalex.org/W2765543904,"Four times in the past 2 years, physicists working with mammoth gravitational-wave detectors have sensed something go bump in the dark, sending invisible ripples through spacetime. This week, they announced the detection of a fifth such disturbance—but this time astronomers saw it, too, at every wavelength of light from gamma radiation to radio waves. Just as physicists had predicted, the unprecedented view of the cosmic cataclysm—in which two superdense neutron stars spiraled into each other—brought with it a cornucopia of insights, each one of them a major scientific advance. The combined observation with gravitational waves and light showed, as predicted, that so-called short gamma ray bursts, among the most powerful events in the cosmos, spring from neutron-star mergers. It demonstrated a hypothesized new type of stellar object called a kilonova because it shines thousands of times brighter than an ordinary nova. And it revealed that half the elements heavier than iron are produced, perhaps exclusively, in neutron-star death spirals."
