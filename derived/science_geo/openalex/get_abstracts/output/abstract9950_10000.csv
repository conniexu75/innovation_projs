https://openalex.org/W2032343668,"We present a procedure for eucaryotic structural gene isolation which involves the construction and screening of cloned libraries of genomic DNA. Large random DNA fragments are joined to phage lambda vectors by using synthetic DNA linkers. The recombinant molecules are packaged into viable phage particles in vitro and amplified to establish a permanent library. We isolated structural genes together with their associated sequences from three libraries constructed from Drosophila, silkmoth and rabbit genomic DNA. In particular, we obtained a large number of phage recombinants bearing the chorion gene sequence from the silkmoth library and several independent clones of beta-globin genes from the rabbit library. Restriction mapping and hybridization studies reveal the presence of closely linked beta-globin genes."
https://openalex.org/W2008050722,"Altered neural-endocrine relations have been proposed as factors in mammalian aging. In the same rats from three age groups we quantified astrocyte reactivity in hippocampus, performed radioimmunoassays for plasma adrenocorticoids, and measured adrenal weight. These variables were correlated in individual animals and generally increased with age. The findings are consistent with recent hypotheses that endocrine levels are related to brain aging, either as cause or effect."
https://openalex.org/W2076354865,Small doses of the opiate antagonist naloxone selectively abolished overeating in genetically obese mice (ob/ob) and rats (fa/fa). Elevated concentrations of the naturally occurring opiate beta-endorphin were found in the pituitaries of both obese species and in the blood plasma of the obese rats. Brain levels of beta-endorphin and Leu-enkephalin were unchanged. These data suggest that excess pituitary beta-endorphin may play a role in the development of the overeating and obesity syndrome.

In addition, a tank tread-like motion of the membrane around the cell content occurs. In dilute suspensions of erythrocytes in viscous media, the same behavior is better observed and can also be measured quantitatively."
https://openalex.org/W2075572784,"The relative frequency of appearance of discontinuities in the postsynaptic thickening, or perforations in the subsynaptic plate, increased with age and experience. Rats reared from weaning in complex or social environments had a significantly higher proportion of occipital cortical synapses with perforations than did rats reared in isolation. In addition, the relative frequency of these perforations more than tripled between 10 and 60 days of age. Shifts in the frequency of perforations can occur independently of changes in the size of synpases. This result suggests a new potential mechanism of synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2036518418,"Resistance of mouse cells to the folate analog, methotrexate, results from selection of increasingly resistant cells on progressive increases of methotrexate in the culture medium. High-level resistance is associated with high rates of synthesis of dihydrofolate reductase and correspondingly high numbers of reductase genes. In some variants high resistance and gene copy number are stable in the absence of selection pressure, whereas in others they are unstable. Analogies are made to antibiotic and insecticide resistance wherein selection of organisms with increased capacity to counteract the drug effect results in emergence of resistance. Gene amplification may underlie many such resistance phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W2099658069,"A temperature-sensitive mutant of BHK, designated ts BN-2, shows a rapid drop in 3H-thymidine incorporation along with accumulation of the cells in the G1 phase of the cycle when asynchronous cultures are shifted from 33.5 degrees C to the nonpermissive temperature of 39.5 degrees C. Synchronized cultures of ts BN-2 cells did not enter DNA synthesis when shifted up in G1. Shift-up of cultures at the beginning of the S phase resulted in an approximately normal rate of DNA synthesis for about 2 hr. The rate of DNA synthesis then quickly declined, and the cells became arrested in mid-S after completion of approximately 0.5 rounds of DNA replication. At the same time, the majority of the cells were observed to lose the nuclear membrane and displayed premature chromosome condensation. These events were followed by the appearance of cells containing several micronuclei and eventual cell disruption and death. The nonpermissive temperature appeared to have no effect on either the elongation of short fragments of DNA or the execution of mitosis after the completion of the S phase under permissive conditions. The ts defect in this mutant may directly limit the initiation of DNA synthesis or alter the regulation of chromatin condensation."
https://openalex.org/W2071868080,"Structural sequences that are extensively separated by nonstructural intervening sequences in the natural ovalbumin gene are coordinately expressed in target and nontarget tissue. The intervening sequences, which consist of unique sequences in the chick genome, are transcribed in their entirety. The amount of nuclear RNA corresponding to these sequences, however, is approximately 10 times less than that observed for structural sequences. The accumulation of RNA corresponding to structural and intervening sequences during acute estrogen stimulation suggests either that there are different rates of transcription for these regions of the ovalbumin gene or that RNA sequences corresponding to the intervening sequences are preferentially processed and degraded. Comparison of the in vitro expression of portions of the ovalbumin gene in nuclei isolated from chronically stimulated oviducts indicates that both structural and intervening sequences are preferentially transcribed in vitro at rates approximately 500 times greater than expected for random transcription of the haploid chick genome. In addition, electrophoresis of oviduct nuclear RNA on agarose gels containing methylmercury hydroxide reveals multiple species of RNA that are from 1.3 to over 4 times larger than ovalbumin mRNA and hybridize to both structural and intervening sequences of the ovalbumin gene. These results are consistent with transcription of the entire ovalbumin gene into a large precursor molecule followed by excision of the intervening sequences and appropriate ligation of the structural sequences to form the mature mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W2083136174,"Two ribosomal DNA (rDNA) regions exist in the circular chloroplast genome of C. reinhardii. They are located at widely distant sites on the map in an inverted orientation. The chloroplast rDNA has been cloned and a fine structure map has been established. The small chloroplast ribosomal subunit contains 16S RNA, while the large subunit contains the four distinct RNA species 23, 7, 5 and 3S rRNA. The location of the rRNA genes has been determined by electron microscopy and by hybridization of the purified rRNAs to various rDNA restriction fragments. The gene order in the direction of transcription is 16, 7, 3, 23 and 5S. A spacer (Sp) of 1.68 ± 0.13 kb separates the 16S and the 7S RNA genes, and a very small spacer of 0.16 ± 0.04 kb separates the 7S and 23S RNA genes. The 5, 23, 3 and 7S RNAs are transcribed on the same strand. A surprising result is the interruption of all chloroplast 23S rRNA genes by a 940 base pair (bp) intervening sequence at a site 0.27 ± 0.04 kb distant from the 5′ end of the 23S RNA coding strand. This interruption has been observed both in cloned and uncloned chloroplast rDNA restriction fragments. When single-stranded chloroplast rDNA is mounted for electron microscopy, distinctive features of secondary structure which flank the rRNA gene sequences can be seen."
https://openalex.org/W2058003673,Seizures induced in the rat by electroshock or by injections of pentylenetetrazol increase the specific binding of diazepam to putative receptor sites in cerebral cortical membranes. The enhancement of diazepam binding results from a rapid increase in the number of available binding sites rather than a change in receptor affinity. The postictal increase in cortical benzodiazepine receptors suggests that the cerebral cortex might be more sensitive to the anticonvulsant effects of the benzodiazepines after seizures. This observation may be related to the mechanism of action of these drugs in the treatment of recurrent seizures such as status epilepticus.
https://openalex.org/W2036346363,"Phagocytosis, pinocytosis and the surface distribution of concanavalin A (ConA) have been analyzed during mitosis in several mammalian cell lines. Use of the bisbenzimidazole dye, Hoechst 33258, for chromosome staining after gentle fixation made possible the rapid identification and correlation of mitotic phase with surface properties. Phagocytosis of both opsonized and nonopsonized particles is markedly depressed in mitotic cells of the mouse macrophage cell line J774.1. The uptake of opsonized particles (IgG-coated erythrocytes) is impaired from early prophase through early G1, whereas phagocytosis of nonopsonized particles (latex beads) is restored by telophase. Fluid pinocytosis, determined by the uptake of soluble horseradish peroxidase, is also inhibited during mitosis. Thus peroxidase-containing cytoplasmic vesicles were virtually absent from mid-prophase through telophase in both J774 and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Adsorptive pinocytosis of ConA was determined from the different distributions of fluorescence in single cells incubated at 37 degrees C with rhodamine-conjugated ConA (surface and cytoplasmic label), then fixed and further incubated with fluorescein-conjugated anti-ConA (surface only). The separate fluorescence of Hoechst, fluorescein and rhodamine could be optically isolated. In interphase J774 cells, ConA is rapidly internalized into cytoplasmic vesicles. In contrast, ConA is restricted to the plasma membrane from mid-prophase through telophase. In CHO, the depressed pattern of internalization is not fully established until metaphse. The surface distribution of ConA also varied dramatically as a function of mitotic phase. Between mid-prophase and early anaphase, the pattern of surface ConA-receptor complexes is diffuse. Once the cleavage furrow begins to develop, however, ConA moves into the region of the furrow. This was shown in J774, CHO and 3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and is probably universal. ConA movement into the membrane that overlies the microfilaments of the contractile ring is analogous to similar movements that occur in interphase cells during ConA cap formation and during the development of phagocytic pseudopods. The analogy emphasizes the common functional consequences of microfilament-membrane organization. It is evident that membrane processes which depend upon endocytosis--for example, certain hormone-induced signals--may be interrupted during mitosis. Inhibition of endocytosis thus may be a significant element in the control of cellular activities during mitosis and a strong influence on the properties of the emergent post-mitotic cell."
https://openalex.org/W2022012730,"All late adenovirus 2 messenger RNAs, except perhaps that for peptide IX, are composite molecules with sequences derived from at least two to five or more separate portions of the genome, as determined by electron microscopic analyses of polysomal RNA hybridized to single- or double-stranded DNA. We previously reported that eight different rightward-transcribed mRNAs contain, at their 5' ends, a common three-part leader sequence derived from coordinates 16.6, 19.6 and 26.6, and that a ninth mRNA consists of sequences from 4.6--6.1 linked directly to those from 9.7--11.0 (Chow et al., 1977a; revised coordinates). We now demonstrate that four additional RNA species also have the same tripartite leader joined to messages with 5' ends located at coordinates at 29.1, 30.5, 33.9 and 42.8. The RNA transcript extending from 29.1--39.0 covers most or all of the viral associated (VA) RNA genes (29.0--30.1). The late RNAs can be grouped into several families of transcripts in which two or three mRNAs have the same 3' end and 3' proximal sequences, but differ substantially in length at the 5' end and, therefore, the coordinate at which the leader sequences are attached to the main body of the message. The number of RNA species transcribed from the Ad2 chromosome between coordinates 29 and 50 exceeds the number of identified Ad2 proteins. Several pairs of messages differing in length by a few percent may thus encode the same protein or have a precursor-product relationship. We have also found that a subpopulation of the polysomal mRNAs for the fiber protein, the most distal gene (86.3--91.2) in the rightward transcription unit, has a fourth leader component ""y"" (78.6--79.1) in addition to the common tripartite leader sequences. Less frequent fiber RNA species have fifth ""x"" (76.9--77.3) and/or sixth ""z"" (84.7--85.1) leader segments. Transcripts with x, y or z segments might be processing intermediates, and it is possible to arrange these species into an array suggestive of multiple pathways for the maturation of fiber mRNA. mRNA transcribed at late times from the L strand between coordinates 15.0 and 11.0 has a single component leader located 200 bases from the main body of the gene from coordinate 16.1 to 15.7. This leader originates from a site very close to the first leader component (16.5--16.6) of the R strand messages and suggests the presence of adjacent L and R strand promoters from which transcription diverges. Taken together, these results emphasize the diversity of splicing patterns and the variety of recombined sequences generated during the synthesis of late Ad2 mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2067057440,"When adenosine deaminase activity is inhibited, low concentrations of adenosine are toxic to human lymphoblast mutants that are unable to convert adenosine to intracellular nucleotides. In order to identify the mediator of this cytotoxicity, we searched for a cytoplasmic protein capable of binding adenosine with high affinity. Such a protein was identified in extracts of human lymphoblasts and placenta as the enzyme S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase."
https://openalex.org/W2036614693,"Anchorage-dependent cells, when forced into suspension culture, display a repertoire of dramatic, coordinated regulatory phenomena. Message production promptly decreases 5 gold but the cells maintain a constant amount of poly(A)+ by means of a concomitant stabilization of mRNA against decay. Protein synthesis shuts down much later and the mRNA is stored in a nonfunctioning state. In this study, the inactive mRNA is extracted from suspended cells and shown to have aberrant translation properties. Well defined polypeptides are apparently no longer synthesized when this mRNA directs protein formation in either reticulocyte or wheat germ-derived heterologous translation systems. Rather, shortened peptides are formed by this mRNA and these become smaller as mRNA is used from cells suspended for longer periods of time. Very few focused spots are formed when the aberrant polypeptides are analyzed in two-dimensional electrophoresis. The sedimentation properties of suspended cell mRNA and the size of poly(A) are unchanged from control monolayer cells. Cross-hybridization of cDNA transcribed from a control cell message population with suspended cell mRNA shows that all sequences are present in normal concentrations. While most identifiable spots disappear from the two-dimensional gel electropherograms of the protein products produced by suspended cell mRNA, a few polypeptides are still synthesized in relatively normal amounts. Conserved polypeptides are found in products of both the reticulocyte and wheat germ systems, but they are different products in each case. The lesion in the suspended cell mRNA does not seem to be at the 5' termini, since synthesis of the shortened peptides is fully sensitive to inhibition of pm7G. Cells that contain extensively modified message can resume protein synthesis when allowed to reattach to a solid substrate. There is an apparent remodification of mRNA to normal translatability within a few hours of cell reattachment, since mRNA from recovering cells quickly resumes directing relatively normal patterns of polypeptide synthesis in vitro. The restoration of normal message function occurs even when new message formation is blocked with actinomycin. Cells recovering after reattachment synthesize supranormal amounts of a few major proteins involved with cell structure, as shown in these studies by an increased amount of translatable sequences which encode these proteins. The most apparent enhanced message is that coding for actin. mRNA from recovering cells produces in vitro several times more actin relative to other proteins than does control cell mRNA. The enhancement of actin mRNA is not seen in the message population of cells that reattach in the presence of actinomycin. The results suggest a morphologically related induction of gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W2087490640,"Dosage compensation is a mechanism by means of which the activity of X-linked or Z-linked genes is made equal in the two sexes of organisms with an XX compared to XY or ZZ compared to ZW basis of sex determination. In mammals, compensation is achieved by the inactivation of one X chromosome in somatic cells of females. In Drosophila, compensation does not involve inactivation. The two X chromosomes in females as well as the single X in males are regulated, and individual genes are thought to respond independently to the regulatory mechanism. It is proposed that in both groups of organisms the evolution of heteromorphic sex chromosomes was gradual and occurred as the direct result of the evolution of dosage compensation rather than the reverse."
https://openalex.org/W2007576361,"Q beta replicase polymerizes MDV-1 RNA at a markedly variable rate. Electrophoretic analyses of partially synthesized strands showed that a few of the elongation intermediates are much more abundant than others, reflecting a variable rate of chain elongation. Our data suggest that at a relatively small number of specific sites in the sequence of this RNA, the progress of the replicase is temporarily interrupted, and then resumes spontaneously, with a finite probability. Since the time spent between these pause sites is negligible compared with the time spent at pause sites, the mean time of chain elongation is well approximated by the sum of the mean times spent at each pause site. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the most prominent elongation intermediates indicated that they all have the potential to form a 3' terminal hairpin structure. This suggests that the marked variability in the rate of chain elongation is due to the formation of terminal hairpins in the product strand, or the reformation of hairpins in the template strand. A survey of the literature shows that this phenomenon occurs with most, if not all, nucleic acid polymerases. Structure-induced pauses may play a role in the regulation of nucleic acid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2058811899,"Electron microscope autoradiographs were prepared of IM-9 human cultured lymphocytes incubated with iodine-125-labeled insulin. With the use of [125I]insulin and Ilford L-4 emulsion, the technique had a resolution half-distance of approximately 0.085 micrometer. Autoradiographs revealed a time-dependent entry of insulin into the cell interior that was maximal after 30 minutes of incubation. At this time point nearly 40 percent of the [125I]insulin was in the interior of the cell at a distance 1 micrometer or greater from the plasma membrane. Grain distribution and volume density analyses revealed that the intracellular insulin was concentrated in the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membrane."

These data suggest that the memory disorder of Korsakoff's syndrome may result from damage to ascending noradrenergic pathways by the diencephalic and brainstem lesions associated with this disease.
https://openalex.org/W1985854802,"By using voltage clamping and microiontophoretic techniques, it has been found that the prolonged cholinergic and dopaminergic inhibition seen in Aplysia burst firing neurons occludes the inward current on which slow oscillations depend. It also mimics the temperature and ionic sensitivity of that inward current. This prolonged inhibition, which cannot be inverted and is insensitive to extracellular potassium changes, thus appears to result from a synaptically produced inactivation of the regenerative slow inward current underlying bursting."

https://openalex.org/W2055354691,"This paper describes an estrogen receptor which is found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of liver cells from male Xenopus laevis, and which seems to be involved in the induction of vitellogenin synthesis. It has a high affinity for estradiol (Kd = 0.5 x 10(-9) M), and the affinities of various steroids for the receptor correlate well with their ability to induce vitellogenin synthesis. It sediments at 3.5S at 0 degrees C in 0.5 M KCI. The rate of sedimentation is unaffected by incubation at 20 degrees C prior to centrifugation, but increases if the salt concentration is lowered to 0.1 M KCI or to zero. It has a Stokes radius of 2.6 nm and a molecular weight of approximately 40,000. The receptor is present at very low levels compared to other steroid target tissues (50--100 fold less than chick oviduct). The cytoplasm of a single hepatocyte contains 92 +/- 18 binding sites for estradiol, while each nucleus contains 99 +/- 19 sites."

By using the technique of retorograde transport of horseradish peroxidase, however, it has been found that in the rat a significant number of these cells, particularly those of the subjacent dorsal horn, ascend many spinal segments to the lateral cervical nucleus and to the lower brainstem. These data provide an anatomic basis for a role of substantia gelatinosa Rolandi and subjacent dorsal horn cells in madulating or contributing to sensory information transmission not only in nearby segments but in far distant structures."
https://openalex.org/W1970445955,"The purine ribonucleoside triphosphate analogues adenosine 5'[gamma-S]triphosphate and guanosine 5'[gamma-T]triphosphate were used as affinity probes for studying RNA chain initiation in isolated nuclei from the mouse myeloma 66.2 cell line. Transcripts initiated with either nucleotide analogue were isolated by affinity chromatography on a mercury-agarose affinity column. The binding was specific and dependent upon the inclusion of the sulfur nucleotide analogues in the in vitro synthetic reaction. Several lines of evidence indicate that the affinity-labeled RNA is initiated in vitro. First, the sulfur nucleotide is recovered in high yield as a single nucleoside 5'[gamma-S]triphosphate 2',3'-monophosphate product following alkaline hydrolysis of RNA bound to the affinity column. Second, authentic ribosomal 5S RNA is known to initiate with GTP; in vitro 5S RNA is bound to mercury-agarose only if [gamma-S]GTP is used as the affinity label in the synthesis, and not if [gamma-S]ATP is used. Under the conditions studied, nuclei incorporated 1.2--2.4 pmole of UMP per 10(6) nuclei per min, and the rate of synthesis was unaffected by substitution of the nucleotide analogues for the normal nucleotides. The percentage of the total RNA synthesized that was incorporated into sequences initiated in vitro was 7.8 +/- 1.5% with [gamma-S]ATP and 9.6 +/- 6.4% with [gamma-S]GTP. The size of the total RNA synthesized, determined by sedimentation on sucrose density gradients containing dimethylsulfoxide, ranged from less than 5S to 45S, and the size of the affinity-labeled sequences ranged from less than 5S to 28S. Approximately half of the incorporation into RNA initiated in vitro was sensitive to a concentration of alpha-amanitin which selectively inhibits polymerase II activity. Most of the remaining incorporation into initiated sequences can be abolished by concentrations of alpha-amanitin that are inhibitory for polymerase III activity. Over 70% of the total incorporation into ribosomal 5S RNA transcripts was into sequences initiated in vitro. This initiation was catalyzed by polymerase III and was specific for GTP as the initiating nucleotide. The RNAase T1 fingerprint of the newly initiated 5S RNA indicates that this gene is accurately initiated and faithfully elongated in vitro. The use of these affinity label probes provides much greater sensitivity for studying the initiation of RNA in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1829478524,"The effect of tunicamycin, a specific inhibitor of protein glycosylation, on interferon production by L cells induced by Newcastle disease virus was studied. The interferon yields in the presence of tunicamycin ranged from 20 to 100% of control in various experiments. The two molecular species of normal L cell interferon with 40,000 and 24,000 daltons were completely eliminated, and a new species of a smaller size (18,000 daltons) was produced. Radiolabeling of interferon with [35S]methionine and [3H]glucosamine added to the induced cultures, as studied by immunoprecipitation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, indicated that the two species of control interferon were both glycoproteins but tunicamycin interferon contained little or no sugar. In support of this was the loss of binding to lectin from Wistaria floribunda. A change in physical property of the molecule due to the absence of sugar was found in decreased heat stability in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, although in its absence no significant difference from control interferon was observed. These results indicate that tunicamycin is an effective agent in producing nonglycosylated but fully active interferon molecules; the sugar moiety appears to be unnecessary for the antiviral activity and for secretion from cells."
https://openalex.org/W1539424778,"We have developed a method for the purification in micromole amounts of the trypsin-derived ADP-ribosyl peptide from diphtheria toxin-modified yeast elongation factor 2 (EF-2). EF-2 was partially purified (15 to 20% purity) by ammonium sulfate precipitation and DEAE-Sephadex chromatography. After [3H]ADP-ribosylation by [3H]nad+ and diphtheria toxin, EF-2 was digested with trypsin and a homogeneous [3H]ADP-ribosyl peptide was isolated by chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex and dihydroxyboryl-substituted cellulose. Based on the amount of ADP-ribose acceptor activity in the crude extract, the overall yield of the peptide was 35%. The yeast peptide contains an unusual amino acid (X) which is the site of ADP ribosylation and is apparently identical to the amino acid reported from rat liver EF-2 by Robinson et al. (Robinson, E. A., Hendriksen, O., and Maxwell, E.S. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 5088-5093). The sequence of the 15-residue yeast peptide was determined to be: Val-Asn-Ile-Leu-Asp-Val-Thr-Leu-His-Ala-Asp-Ala-Ile-X-Arg. The 11 COOH-terminal residues of this peptide and of the homologous 15-residue peptide reported by Maxwell and co-workers from rat liver EF-2 are identical."
https://openalex.org/W1975829206,"The assembly of the precursor shells of bacteriophage P22 entails the co-polymerization of gene 5 coat protein with gene 8 scaffolding protein into double shell structures. During DNA encapsidation, the inner shell of scaffolding molecules dissociates and exits from the prohead. These molecules then recycle, catalyzing the assembly of newly synthesized coat protein to form new proheads ( King and Casjens, 1974 King J. Casjens S. Nature. 1974; 251: 112-119 Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar ). Although gene 5 and gene 8 are adjacent on the phage chromosome, we find that the synthesis of the two proteins is differentially regulated. In productively infected cells, scaffolding protein is synthesized at a low rate relative to the coat protein. In contrast, cells that are infected with mutants blocked in DNA packaging and accumulate precursor shells synthesize scaffolding protein at a much higher rate. If a mutation is introduced into the coat protein gene, however, preventing shell assembly, the rate of scaffolding protein synthesis decreases to less than the wild-type rate. The experiments are consistent with models in which either continued synthesis of scaffolding protein depends upon co-polymerization with coat subunits, or soluble scaffolding subunits (but not assembled subunits) depress their own further synthesis. The finding that amber fragments of the scaffolding protein are synthesized at a very low rate is inconsistent with the second model. There is evidence, however, that fragments of the protein may have regulatory activity. The regulatory circuit couples scaffolding protein synthesis to morphogenesis. Gene dosage experiments show that regulation results in the maintenance of coat and scaffolding subunits in the proper ratio for shell assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1586293403,"Abstract Kinetic studies with adenylate deaminase have been performed by stopped flow methods at 20 degrees C in 0.01 M imidazole/HCl, pH 6.5. The data were analyzed using either the whole time course of the reaction or the initial portion of the full time course. At low KCl concentrations, activation by the product IMP complicates any interpretation. In the presence of 0.15 M KCl, the results are interpreted in terms of three types of purine nucleotide binding sites: an active site, an inhibitory site which appears to be relatively specific for nucleoside triphosphates, and an activating site which shows relatively little specificity for nucleoside phosphates. Nucleotide binding to the activating site weakens binding to the inhibitory site. Sigmoidal kinetic data observed as a function of AMP in the presence of the inhibitor GTP are interpreted in terms of AMP binding to the activating site and weakening GTP binding. A fragment of myosin, subfragement-2, which has previously been shown to form a tight complex with adenylate deaminase (Ashby, B., and Frieden, C. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 1869--1875) activates the deaminase reaction only slightly. Complex formation, however, makes the reaction less susceptible to inhibition by GTP, although high levels of this nucleotide will disrupt the complex. In the presence of GTP or GTP plus subfragment-2, hysteretic effects are observed."
https://openalex.org/W2038126541,"The β and δ chains of hemoglobins A and A2 are very similar in structure and are encoded by genes that are tightly linked, yet in the red cell β chain production is 40 fold greater than production of the δ chain, providing an excellent model for studying the control of gene expression. We have examined the synthesis of β and δ chains (and the δβ chain of Hb Lepore) in an attempt to ascertain the level at which this control is effected. The translation time of δ chains in bone marrow erythroid cells was closely comparable to that of β chains, and indirect evidence suggested that the rates of chain initiation could not account for the difference in the amounts of the two chains. Analysis of βδ chain synthesis ratios during erythroid maturation indicated that δ chain mRNA has a shorter half-life than β chain mRNA, accounting for the absence of δ chain synthesis in reticulocytes. Analysis of globin chain mRNA from Hb Lepore homozygotes by cDNA hybridization demonstrated that there is no accumulation of inactive δβ chain mRNA during erythroid maturation in this condition. From these results we conclude that the levels of β and δ chains are determined, at least in part, by the difference in the stability of their respective mRNAs. It appears probable that additional control may also be effected by differential rates of transcription or HnRNA processing."
https://openalex.org/W1995853160,"In this paper we examine the role of two myosins in body-wall muscle cells of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Large populations of nematodes are synchronized, and the synthesis and accumulation of myosin heavy chains and total protein are followed through postmitotic larval development. Growth is exponential with time for both the wild-type N2 and the body-wall muscledefective mutant E675, with a longer doubling time for the mutant. Utilizing the electrophoretic polymorphism of the E675 myosin heavy chains, we show that distinguishable classes of heavy chains accumulate differentially throughout development. Immunochemical measurements confirm a similar result in N2. Total myosin heavy chain accumulation is also quantitatively similar for the two strains. Myosin heavy chain relative synthetic rates as determined by pulse-labeling are constant throughout development and are equivalent for the two strains. The final fraction of accumulated unc-54 to total heavy chains of approximately 0.63 equals the constant synthetic fraction of approximately 0.62. Since myosin heavy chain accumulation and relative synthesis are equivalent, we conclude that the turnover of heavy chains is also similar in N2 and E675 despite the extensive structural and functional disruption within body-wall muscle cells of the latter strain. Since the accumulated fraction of unc-54 myosin heavy chains reaches a plateau at the constant synthetic fraction, myosin accumulation In the body-wall muscle cells may be attributed to a constant ratio of synthetic rates of the two body-wall myosin species. The coordinate synthesis of two myosins in the same body-wall muscle cells is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2007632477,"A well-known solution of the diffusion equation gives an exponential square-root function as the frequency response for a one-dimensional diffusion or transmission process. When two or more such processes are cascaded, the result is still an exponential square-root characteristic, but with a longer time constant. This seems to explain why flicker thresholds obey the Kelly-Veringa diffusion model at high frequencies, even though the psychophysically inferred diffusion process is much slower than the first stage of visual transduction measured by, for example, late receptor potentials. Two such stages in tandem are sufficient to account for the psychophysical data, because the psychophysical time constant is proportional to the square of the number of stages involved. In addition, the nonlinear behavior of flicker thresholds under intense light adaptation can be explained if the loss factor in the first stage is proportional to the amount of the photopigment bleached. Apparently the flicker thresholds are governed by first- and second-order retinal neurons."

Infective cultures of Trypanosoma rhodesiense were initiated and maintained in vitro on Chinese hamster lung cells. By changing daily one-third of the Hepes-buffered RPMI 1640 medium containing 20 percent fetal bovine serum, the trypanosome numbers increased to 3 X 10(6) to 5 X 10(6) cells per milliliter. After 80 days in vitro at 37 degrees C, the cultured trypomastigotes are infective for mice and rats and morphologically similar to bloodstream trypomastigotes in having a subterminal kinetoplast and a surface coat. In addition, they possess L-alpha-glycerophosphate oxidase, the predominant steady-state terminal oxidase of bloodstream trypomastigotes."

https://openalex.org/W1586147123,"Reovirus infectivity and core-associated RNA polymerase activity were decreased by irradiation with long wavelength ultraviolet light in the presence of the 4'-substituted psoralen derivatives, 4'-aminomethyl-4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen and 4'-hydroxymethyl-4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen. Monoadduct formation occurred after photoreaction with low psoralen concentrations or brief irradiation times, and the presence of KCl or magnesium acetate had a protective effect. Under the mild reaction conditions in which 1 molecule of 4'-aminomethyl-4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen was bound covalently per 160 to 290 base-pairs, the polymerase activity was decreased by greater than 90%. At higher drug concentrations or longer times of photoreaction of reovirus cores, the viral RNA was extensively cross-linked indicating that the reovirus genome in situ is double-stranded."
https://openalex.org/W2033032242,"A previously undescribed response pattern has been observed in certain single units in the posterior colliculus of Pteronotus suapurensis. These units, constituting about one-third of those tuned to the region of the dominant constant-frequency (CF) components of the orientation sounds, respond to a tone pip with a burst of spikes at a latency of 3 to 6 milliseconds, within the frequency-intensity domain of a normal V-shaped response area. In these units, however, as intensity is dropped below threshold for this response, a response of 5- to 10-milliseconds longer latency appears and persists throughout another 10 to 30 decibels of attenuation. These late responses can be very vigorous, are sharply tuned to frequencies at or just above the CF components of the signal, and are often strongest and of lowest threshold at stimulus durations of 1.5 to 3 milliseconds—approximately the duration of the CF component. These properties imply that the late responses are concerned with analysis of the CF components of echoes, apparently in ways not as prominent in other bats."
