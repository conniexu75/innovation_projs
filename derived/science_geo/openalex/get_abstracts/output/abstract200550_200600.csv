https://openalex.org/W1981259792,"IN a recent article1 Svet-Moldavskaya and Svet-Moldavsky have reported that repeated injections of immature rabbit brain into guinea pigs prevented the development of allergic encephalomyelitis when the same animals were given active (adult rabbit brain) injections at a later date. From this observation they have proposed the existence in brain of two factors, one of which is responsible for the development of encephalomyelitis, the other for the development of acquired resistance against it."

He interprets this finding as indicating that simple decay of the memory trace is an important factor in the loss of immediate memory."

Some of these have been isolated1,2 and one has been shown to be 1 : 3-diphenylurea3. Mauney et al. 4 have found a growth-factor which is mainly in the flesh of the coconut."

https://openalex.org/W1973180647,"ON March 10, 1958, 111 Romney ewe lambs (group A) which had grazed continuously since weaning (December 12, 1957) on pastures dominant in red clover were joined with an additional 92 Romney ewe lambs (group B) for studies of their breeding season. This latter group had grazed, since weaning (December 11, 1957), on perennial rye-grass–white clover pastures. Vasectomized, ochred rams were run with these lambs from March 17, 1958, all being grazed together on perennial rye-grass–white clover pastures. All lambs were weighed on March 19, group A and group B having the same average live weight (71 lb.). On the same day, that is, within two days of joining with teasers, 29 lambs from group A but none from group B were found to have been marked. This sudden onset of œtrus from one group of lambs was unexpected in view of the previous results1 on the breeding season of Romney ewe lambs. Owing to the relatively early age at first œstrus shown by these lambs, laparotomy was performed within five days of observed œstrus to determine whether ovulation had occurred. Both the left and right ovaries of eight lambs were examined without finding any evidence of the existence of corpora lutea. Graafian follicles of varying sizes, however, were seen on most ovaries."

The following algae were studied : the freshwater diatoms Navicula pelliculosa (Bréb.) Hilse and Nitzschia palea (Kütz.) W. Sm. ; the marine diatom Cylindrotheca gracilis (Bréb.) Grun. ; the freshwater blue-green alga Anacystis nidulans (Richt.) Dr. and Daily ; and the freshwater green alga Chlorella pyrenoidosa Chick."

https://openalex.org/W2005743686,"IN a recent publication1 dealing with the mechanism of virus hæmagglutination, it was suggested that erythrocytes that had adsorbed the virus became hydrophobic, hence their tendency to cling to glass. This hydrophobic character of the virus – erythrocyte adsorption complex produces behaviour similar to that observed with oil droplets in an aqueous medium. That is, under the influence of surface tension the complex adheres to any surface with which it is in contact. It was further suggested that the aggregation of erythrocytes (hæmagglutination), as well as tendency to cling to glass (shield formation), could be explained in this fashion without the necessity of postulating virus ‘bridges’2 linking cell to cell and cell to glass."

https://openalex.org/W2043738767,"IN the current literature on electron microscopical methods1 many weaknesses of osmic acid as a fixing agent have been carefully analysed and appropriate safety methods, which would reduce if not entirely eliminate these, have been recommended. No useful advice appears to have been given, however, on the proper cleaning of glass and other utensils after they have become stained with osmic acid or on the removal of osmic acid precipitates, and consequently some wastage of this not inexpensive material at present seems to be accepted as inevitable."

https://openalex.org/W2018040471,"IT seems to have been generally assumed that the structure of myofibrils in skeletal, or striated, muscle is fundamentally similar in all the vertebrate classes, and, in addition, observations on invertebrates, particularly insects, have been widely applied to the muscles of vertebrates. In fact, much of the detailed morphological description of striations of mammalian muscle in histological text-books appears to be based on work on insects, as can be seen by reference to Schafer's well-known text-book1, or to Cowdry's work on special cytology2."

This may, on the other hand, be of great benefit in reducing the incidence of hypertensive cardiovascular disease. The treatment of hypertension by low salt diet is quite well established, but it was not known before that persons on habitually high salt diet are more prone to essential hypertension and its complications. Dahl has predicted that where salt diet exceeds 5 gm. of sodium per day (that is, 12.5 gm. sodium chloride) incidence of hypertension and its complications will be frequent."
