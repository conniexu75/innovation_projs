https://openalex.org/W1561143138,"Escherichia coli MutH possesses an extremely weak d(GATC) endonuclease that responds to the state of methylation of the sequence (Welsh, K. M., Lu, A.-L., Clark, S., and Modrich, P. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 15624-15629). MutH endonuclease is activated in a reaction that requires MutS, MutL, ATP, and Mg2+ and depends upon the presence of a mismatch within the DNA. The degree of activation correlates with the efficiency with which a particular mismatch is subject to methyl-directed repair (G-T greater than G-G greater than A-C greater than C-C), and activated MutH responds to the state of DNA adenine methylation. Incision of an unmethylated strand occurs immediately 5' to a d(GATC) sequence, leaving 5' phosphate and 3' hydroxy termini (pN decreases pGpAp-TpC). Unmethylated d(GATC) sites are subject to double strand cleavage by activated MutH, an effect that may account for the killing of dam- mutants by 2-aminopurine. The mechanism of activation apparently requires ATP hydrolysis since adenosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) not only fails to support the reaction but also inhibits activation promoted by ATP. The process has no obligate polarity as d(GATC) site incision by the activated nuclease can occur either 3' or 5' to the mismatch on an unmethylated strand. However, activation is sensitive to DNA topology. Circular heteroduplexes are better substrates than linear molecules, and activity of DNAs of the latter class depends on placement of the mismatch and d(GATC) site within the molecule. MutH activation is supported by a 6-kilobase linear heteroduplex in which the mismatch and d(GATC) site are centrally located and separated by 1 kilobase, but a related molecule, in which the two sites are located near opposite ends of the DNA, is essentially inactive as substrate. We conclude that MutH activation represents the initiation stage of methyl-directed repair and suggest that interaction of a mismatch and a d(GATC) site is provoked by MutS binding to a mispair, with subsequent ATP-dependent translocation of one or more Mut proteins along the helix leading to cleavage at a d(GATC) sequence on either side of the mismatch."
https://openalex.org/W1551725031,"Secreted proteins are processed from a nascent form that contains an NH2-terminal signal peptide. During processing, the latter is cleaved by a specific NH2-terminal signal peptidase. The nascent form of phosphatidylinositol glycan (PI-G) tailed proteins contain both an NH2- and a COOH-terminal signal peptide. The two signal peptides have much in common, such as size and hydrophobicity. The COOH-terminal peptide is also cleaved during processing. We propose that the amino acid in a nascent protein that ultimately combines with the PI-G moiety be designated the omega site. Amino acids adjacent and COOH-terminal to the omega site would then be omega + 1, omega + 2, etc. In previous studies, we showed that allowable substitutions at the omega site of an engineered form of placental alkaline phosphatase (miniPLAP) are limited to 6 small amino acids. In the present study, mutations were made at the omega + 1 and omega + 2 sites. At the omega + 1 site, processing to varying degrees was observed with 8 of the 9 amino acids substituted for alanine, the normal constituent. Only the proline mutant showed no processing. By contrast, the only substituents permitted at the omega + 2 site were glycine and alanine, with only trace activity observed with serine and cysteine. Thus, just as there is a -1, -3 rule for predicting cleavage by NH2-terminal signal peptidase, there appears to be a comparable omega, omega + 2 rule for predicting cleavage/PI-G addition by COOH-terminal signal transamidase."
https://openalex.org/W1611096381,"Squalestatin 1 is a member of a novel family of fermentation products isolated from a previously unknown Phoma species (Coelomycetes). Squalestatin 1 is a potent, selective inhibitor of squalene synthase, a key enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis; in vitro, 50% inhibition of enzyme activity is observed at a concentration of 12 +/- 5 nM (range of 4-22 nM). Squalestatin 1 inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis from [14C]acetate by isolated rat hepatocytes (50% inhibition at 39 nM) and by rat liver in vivo. In marmosets, a species with a lipoprotein profile similar to that of man, squalestatin 1 lowers serum cholesterol by up to 75%. This compound will allow further investigation of the control of the sterol biosynthesis pathway and could also lead to the development of new therapies for elevated serum cholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W1498541563,"In this work, we have predicted and mapped the potential Z-DNA-forming sequences in over one million base pairs of human DNA, containing 137 complete genes. The computer program (Z-Hunt-II) developed for this study uses a rigorous thermodynamic search strategy to map the occurrence of left-handed Z-DNA in genomic sequences. The search algorithm has been optimized to search large sequences for the potential occurrence of Z-DNA, taking into account sequence type, length, and cooperativity for a given stretch of potential Z-DNA-forming nucleotides. In this extensive data set we have identified 329 potential Z-DNA-forming sequences. The exact locations of the potential Z-DNA-forming sequences in the data set have been mapped with respect to the location of structural features of the genes. This analysis reveals a distinctly nonrandom distribution of potential Z-DNA-forming sequences across human genes and, most notably, that strong Z-DNA-forming sequences are more commonly found near the 5' ends of genes. We find that 35% of the Z-DNA-forming sequences are located upstream of the first expressed exon, while only 3% of the sequences are located downstream of the last expressed exon. The remaining 62% of the Z-DNA-forming sequences, which are located either in introns (47.1%) or exons (14.9%), are also nonrandomly distributed, with a strong bias toward locations near the site of transcription initiation. We interpret this distribution of potential Z-DNA-forming sequences toward the 5' end of human genes in terms of the well established twin-domain model of transcription-induced supercoiling and the effect of this topological strain on Z-DNA formation in eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1558351473,"During the purification of eosinophil chemotactic factors synthesized by the uterus in response to estrogen we isolated a protein having an N-terminal (15 amino acids) sequence identical to that of rat cyclophilin. Our data demonstrate that cyclophilin, a cytosolic protein isolated from bovine thymocytes, which specifically binds the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A, as well as recombinant human cyclophilin, displays eosinophil chemotactic activity. In addition to its chemotactic activity, cyclophilin stimulated the release of peroxidase activity from eosinophils. Maximal chemotactic activity of cyclophilin was achieved at a concentration of approximately 10 nM. At similar concentrations cyclophilin was also able to stimulate the migration of neutrophils. This chemotactic activity could be prevented by the addition of cyclosporin A, but not by a nonimmunosuppressive analog (1-fur-furyl-cyclosporin A) at similar concentrations. This chemotactic activity may represent an additional mechanism by which immunosuppressive drugs function to prevent tissue rejection."
https://openalex.org/W1593924964,"A panel of anti-thyroid hormone receptor (TR) antisera were generated to allow direct assay of the concentrations of the alpha 1 and beta 1 receptor isoforms in nuclear extracts from adult rat liver, kidney, brain and heart, and fetal brain. An antiserum, immunoglobulin G (IgG)-beta 1, raised against amino acid sequence 62-92 of the rat TR-beta 1 specifically precipitated only TR-beta 1 in vitro translation products. A second antiserum, IgG-alpha 1/beta, generated against a sequence that is identical in the ligand binding region of rat TR-alpha 1 and TR-beta isoforms immunoprecipitated both TR-alpha 1 and -beta 1 translation products. These IgG preparations were used to specifically immunoprecipitate thyroid hormone receptor binding activity from nuclear extracts. IgG-beta 1 cleared almost 80%, and the IgG-alpha 1/beta immunoprecipitated nearly all binding from hepatic nuclear extracts. This distribution of TR protein, 80% beta 1 and 20% alpha 1, is the same as previously reported for their respective mRNAs in liver. In heart, kidney, and brain IgG-beta 1 cleared 45, 43, and 28% of total binding, respectively, and IgG-alpha 1/beta cleared all T3 binding activity from these tissues. In agreement with an earlier study, marked variations in specific protein/mRNA ratios were noted among these tissues. Consistent with our earlier report of the presence of only very low levels of TR-beta 1 mRNA in fetal brain, IgG-beta 1 cleared just 5% of binding in this tissue. Studies using an antiserum (IgG-ch) generated against homologous segments of the hinge region in both TR-alpha 1 and -beta 1 yielded results which contrasted sharply with those of IgG-alpha 1/beta. Whereas IgG-ch could also immunoprecipitate virtually all binding from hepatic extracts it cleared only 40-50% of binding from the other tissues, including fetal brain in which TR-alpha 1 accounts for greater than 90% of binding protein. The data suggest the presence of posttranslational modification of the TR-alpha 1 protein in the hinge region, consistent with the presence in this segment of potential phosphorylation sites."
https://openalex.org/W1541462376,"The SEC17 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is required for vesicular transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. Here we report that the product of the SEC17 gene has the exact biochemical properties expected for a yeast homologue of the mammalian transport factor, alpha-SNAP. The DNA sequence of SEC17 codes for a protein of predicted molecular mass of 33 kDa. Immunoblotting indicates that Sec17p fractionates as a peripheral membrane protein and is mostly soluble when overexpressed, suggesting the presence of a saturable membrane receptor for Sec17p. Sec17p was purified from yeast cytosol using a SNAP-dependent in vitro mammalian Golgi transport assay. Kinetic analysis using this assay shows Sec17p acts temporally close to the fusion of transport vesicles with the medial Golgi compartment. In yeast extracts, Sec17p binds to Sec18p with a 1:1 stoichiometry. The interaction between Sec17p and Sec18p requires an activity provided by yeast membranes, and this putative membrane receptor activity is not extracted by high salt treatment of membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1547962072,"Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), the primary physiological inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) in plasma, is a serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) that forms a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with its target proteinase leading to the formation of a stable inactive complex. The active, inhibitory form of PAI-1 spontaneously converts to a latent form that can be reactivated by protein denaturants. In the present study we have isolated another molecular form of intact PAI-1 that, in contrast with active PAI-1, does not form stable complexes with t-PA but is cleaved at the P1-P1' bond (Arg346-Met347). Other serine proteinases, e.g. urokinase-type plasminogen activator and thrombin, also cleaved this form of PAI-1. Fluorescence spectroscopy revealed conformational differences between the latent, active, and substrate forms of PAI-1. This observation confirms our hypothesis that the three functionally different forms of PAI-1 are the consequence of conformational transitions. Thus PAI-1 may occur in three interconvertible conformations: latent, inhibitor, and substrate PAI-1. The identification of two distinct conformations of PAI-1 which interact with their target protease either as an inhibitor or as a substrate is a previously unrecognized phenomenon among the serpins. Conversion of substrate PAI-1 to its inactive degradation product may constitute a pathway for the physiological regulation of PAI-1 activity."
https://openalex.org/W1510729937,"To determine the role of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in the activation of phospholipase D (PLD), electropermeabilized HL-60 cells labeled in [3H]alkyl-phosphatidylcholine were treated with vanadate derivatives. Micromolar concentrations of vanadyl hydroperoxide (V(4+)-OOH) induced accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Concomitantly, V(4+)-OOH or a combination of vanadate and NADPH elicited a concentration- and time-dependent accumulation of phosphatidic acid (PtdOH). In the presence of ethanol a sustained formation of phosphatidylethanol was observed, indicating that a type D phospholipase was activated. A good correlation was found to exist between the accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and activation of PLD. The V(4+)-OOH concentration dependence of the two responses was nearly identical, and the time course of activation was similar, with tyrosine phosphorylation preceding PLD activation by approximately 1 min. The ability of V(4+)-OOH to induce both responses was found to be strictly dependent on the presence of ATP and/or Mg2+, suggesting that PLD activation involves phosphotransferase reactions. Accordingly, ST638, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, reduced concomitantly tyrosine phosphorylation and PLD activation elicited by V(4+)-OOH. The mechanism of action of V(4+)-OOH was investigated. The diacylglycerol kinase inhibitors, dioctanoylethylene glycol and R59022 potentiated PLD stimulation by exogenous diacylglycerol but not by V(4+)-OOH. Moreover, stimulation by V(4+)-OOH and by phorbol esters was synergystic. Therefore, diacylglycerol-induced activation of protein kinase C is unlikely to mediate the effects of V(4+)-OOH. The response of PLD to V(4+)-OOH was larger than that to guanosine 5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate. Moreover, the effects of GTP gamma S and V(4+)-OOH were additive. Hence, activation of G proteins cannot account for the stimulation of PLD by V(4+)-OOH. V(4+)-OOH also triggers a burst of O2 consumption by the NADPH oxidase. Inhibition of PtdOH accumulation by addition of ethanol or by ST638 abolished this respiratory burst. Together, the results establish a strong correlation between tyrosine phosphorylation, PLD activation, and stimulation of the NADPH oxidase in HL-60 cells, suggesting a causal relationship."
https://openalex.org/W1561306503,"The K+ channel openers, including cromakalim, pinacidil, minoxidil sulfate, diazoxide, and nicorandil, form a chemically heterogeneous group of compounds, which relax smooth muscle by opening plasmalemmal K+ channels. At present it is not known whether these drugs elicit their effects by binding to the same target, presumably the K+ channel. In order to address this question, a binding assay for K+ channel openers has been developed in vascular smooth muscle. The novel tritiated K+ channel opener, [3H]P1075, an analogue of pinacidil, binds with high affinity (KD = 6 +/- 1 nM) to endothelium-denuded rings of rat aorta. Inhibition studies indicate that the different families of K+ channel openers bind to a common target. Evidence is presented to suggest that the binding site for the sulfonylurea, glibenclamide, the major blocker of the K+ channel openers, is coupled in a negative allosteric manner to the binding site(s) for the openers. The binding assay described here may open the way to the biochemical characterization of the drug receptor for the K+ channel openers."
https://openalex.org/W2127547755,"We showed previously that the xeroderma pigmentosum group A complementing (XPAC) protein involved in the DNA excision repair pathway contains a zinc-finger motif and is localized in the nucleus of normal human cells. For detailed structural and functional analyses of the XPAC protein, we constructed various XPAC cDNAs by site-directed mutagenesis and isolated permanent cell lines expressing mutant proteins. Immunofluorescent analysis of these lines indicated that the nuclear localization signal is located in the region encoded by Exon 1, especially centered at amino acids 30-42. A UV survival study showed that regions from Exons 2 through 6 were essential for DNA repair function, but that Exon 1 was not. Interestingly, deletion of the glutamic acid cluster in the region encoded by Exon 2 resulted in a dramatic loss of DNA repair activity. Furthermore, replacements of each of the 4 cysteines supposed to form a zinc-finger structure in the region encoded by Exon 3 by serine or glycine resulted in similar levels of loss of repair activity. These results suggest that all 4 cysteines forming a zinc-finger structure and also the glutamic acid cluster are important for DNA repair function."
https://openalex.org/W1537611160,"A third member of the thrombospondin gene family (Thbs3) has been partially characterized in the mouse. In both the mouse and humans, the Thbs3/THBS3 gene is located immediately upstream from the Muc1/MUC1 (episialin) gene; less than 3 kilobases separate the polyadenylation signal of one gene from the start of transcription of the other. The available coding sequence in Thbs3 shows a high degree of amino acid sequence identity to Thbs1 and Thbs2 (58 and 59%, respectively, in exons 15 and 16), but the exon/intron organization of Thbs3 appears to be more disparate than that of the two previously described members of the family. The shorter length of the Thbs3 mRNA (3.5 kilobases) can be attributed largely to a shorter 3'-untranslated region. The Thbs3 gene is expressed in a distinctive pattern in mouse tissues, with the highest level of expression in lung. This pattern suggests a unique function for the translation product of the Thbs3 gene."
https://openalex.org/W1496216678,"We have examined the synthesis, posttranslational processing, and localization of soybean P34, a member of the papain superfamily. P34 has been identified as a constituent of oil storage organelles or oil bodies isolated from seed lysates and has been assumed to be one of the oil body proteins. Electron microscopic immunocytochemistry with a monoclonal antibody demonstrated that P34 is localized in the protein storage vacuoles but not in the oil bodies. Immunocytochemical observations of partially disrupted seed cells showed that the association of P34 with oil bodies appears to occur as a consequence of cell lysis. In vitro synthesis of P34 results in the formation of a 46-kDa polypeptide that increases to 47 kDa due to core glycosylation by canine microsomes. In vivo synthesis studies in the presence and absence of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, indicate that pro-P34 is 47 kDa. Since the cDNA sequence of prepro-P34 contains a single putative glycosylation site in the precursor domain, we conclude that P34, like a few other vacuolar proteins, is synthesized as a glycoprotein precursor. Pulse-chase experiments showed that the processing of pro-P34 to mature P34 occurs in a single step and that this posttranslational cleavage occurs on the carboxyl side of an Asn, which is typical of seed vacuolar proteins. Pro-P34 (47 kDa) is detected in immunoblots of maturing seeds. Analysis of RNA indicates that the P34 genes are expressed only during seed maturation and that the P34 mRNA is related to other thiol protease mRNAs detectable in other organs and plants. Unlike other seed thiol proteases that are synthesized only after seed germination, P34 accumulates during seed maturation."
https://openalex.org/W1539793245,"Chromogranin B and secretogranin II, two members of the granin family, are known to be post-translationally modified by the addition of O-linked carbohydrates to serine and/or threonine, phosphate to serine and threonine, and sulfate to carbohydrate and tyrosine residues. In the present study, chromogranin B and secretogranin II were used as model proteins to investigate in which subcompartment of the Golgi complex secretory proteins become phosphorylated. Monensin, a drug known to block the transport from the medial to the trans cisternae of the Golgi stack, inhibited the phosphorylation of the granins, indicating that this modification occurred distal to the medial Golgi. Monensin also blocked the addition of galactose to O-linked carbohydrates and the sulfation of the granins, confirming previous data that these modifications take place in the trans Golgi. To distinguish, within the trans Golgi, between the trans cisternae of the Golgi stack and the trans Golgi network, we made use of the previous observation that brefeldin A results in the redistribution to the endoplasmic reticulum of membrane-bound enzymes of the trans cisternae of the Golgi stack, but not of the trans Golgi network. Brefeldin A treatment abolished granin sulfation but resulted in the accumulation of phosphorylated and galactosylated granins. Differential effects of brefeldin A on membranes of the Golgi stack versus the trans Golgi network were also observed by immunofluorescence analysis of marker proteins specific for either compartment. Our results suggest that the phosphorylation of secretory proteins, like their galactosylation, largely occurs in the trans cisternae of the Golgi stack, whereas the sulfation of secretory proteins on both carbohydrate and tyrosine residues takes place selectively in the trans Golgi network."
https://openalex.org/W1559867692,"Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion attachment proteins (SNAPs) are required for the binding of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF) to Golgi membranes and are, therefore, required for intra-Golgi transport. We report the existence of distinct alpha/beta-SNAP and gamma-SNAP-binding sites in Golgi membranes that appear to be part of the same receptor complex. Cross-linking studies with alpha-SNAP demonstrate that an integral membrane protein of between 30-40 kDa is the alpha-SNAP binding component of the multi-SNAP receptor complex. These data suggest that SNAPs function by independently binding to a multi-SNAP membrane-receptor complex, thereby activating them to serve as adaptors for the targeting of NSF."
https://openalex.org/W1582826788,"The role of the two galactose binding sites of ricin B chain in ricin toxicity was evaluated by studying a series of ricin point mutants. Wild-type (WT) ricin and three ricin B chain point mutants having mutations in either 1) the first galactose binding domain (site 1 mutant, Met in place of Lys-40 and Gly in place of Asn-46), 2) the second galactose binding domain (site 2 mutant, Gly in place of Asn-255), or 3) both galactose binding domains (double site mutant containing all three amino acid replacements formerly stated) were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and then reassociated with recombinant ricin A chain. The different ricin B chains were mannosylated to the same extent. Cytotoxicity of these toxins was evaluated when cell entry was mediated either by galactose-containing receptors or through an alternate receptor, the mannose receptor of macrophages. WT ricin and each of the single domain mutants was able to kill Vero cells following uptake by galactose containing receptors. Lactose blocked the toxicity of each of these ricins. Site 1 and 2 mutants were 20-40 times less potent than WT ricin, and the double site mutant had no detectable cytotoxicity. WT ricin, the site 1 mutant, and the site 2 mutant also inhibited protein synthesis of mannose receptor-containing cells. Ricin can enter these cells through either a cell-surface galactose-containing receptor or through the mannose receptor. By including lactose in the cell medium, galactose-containing receptor-mediated uptake is blocked and cytotoxicity occurs solely via the mannose receptor. WT ricin, site 1, and site 2 mutants were cytotoxic to macrophages in the presence of lactose with the relative potency, WT greater than site 2 mutant greater than site 1 mutant. The double site mutant lacked cytotoxicity either in the absence or presence of lactose. Thus, even for mannose receptor-mediated toxicity of ricin, at least one galactose binding site remains necessary for cytotoxicity and two galactose binding sites further increases potency. These results are consistent with the model that the ricin B chain galactose binding activity plays a role not only in cell surface binding but also intracellularly for ricin cytotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1529445978,"Cellular mechanisms for the regulation of Ca(2+)-dependent myosin light chain phosphorylation were investigated in bovine tracheal smooth muscle. Increases in the free intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), light chain phosphorylation, and force were proportional to carbachol concentration. KCaM, the concentration of Ca2+/calmodulin required for half-maximal activation of myosin light chain kinase, also increased proportionally, presumably due to Ca(2+)-dependent phosphorylation of the kinase. Isoproterenol treatment inhibited agonist-induced contraction by decreasing [Ca2+]i and thereby light chain phosphorylation. Depolarization by increasing concentrations of KCl also resulted in proportional increases in [Ca2+]i, KCaM, light chain phosphorylation, and force. However, the [Ca2+]i required to obtain a given value of either light chain phosphorylation or KCaM was greater in KCl-depolarized tissues compared to carbachol-treated tissues. In muscles contracted with KCl, isoproterenol treatment resulted in diminished light chain phosphorylation and force without alterations in [Ca2+]i or KCaM. Thus, isoproterenol inhibition of KCl-induced contraction results from a cellular mechanism different from that found in agonist-induced contraction. In neither case does isoproterenol produce relaxation by altering the calmodulin activation properties of myosin light chain kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1505411117,"Segments of the 5'-flanking region of the mouse vascular smooth muscle alpha-actin gene were assayed for promoter activity in transfected mouse BC3H1 myogenic cells and AKR-2B embryonic fibroblasts. The region between -150 and -191 that functions as a positive transcriptional element in myogenic and fibroblastic cells contains a mammalian-specific inverted CC(A/T)6GG-type consensus sequence. Expression was restricted to fully differentiated myogenic cells when an additional sequence spanning -191 to -224 was included in reporter gene constructs. This 33-base pair (bp) negative regulatory element is 70% conserved between the mouse and human genes and contains a 10-bp motif at its 3' end that only partially resembles a CC(A/T)6GG element. Retention of a GGGA motif at the 3' boundary of the 33-bp region is sufficient to maintain full transcriptional repression in fibroblasts and is partly responsible for repression in undifferentiated myoblasts. Complete muscle tissue-restrictive expression requires an additional 8 bp from the CC(A/T)6GG-like element immediately 5' to the GGGA motif, since replacement of this region with an unrelated 10-bp sequence completely eliminated restrictive transcriptional behavior in undifferentiated myoblasts. The distal portion of the 5'-flanking region between -224 and -1074 contains six E-box motifs (CANNTG) and mediates high level transcription only in postconfluent BC3H1 myoblasts. Analysis of reporter gene constructs including either the proximal E-box at -240 or all six E-boxes indicate that the five distal E-boxes are not required for high level transcription. A 724-bp segment of the 5'-flanking region consisting of the proximal E-box flanked upstream by a mammalian-specific 352-bp region was sufficient for maximal transcriptional activation in postconfluent BC3H1 myoblasts. Deletion of the 352-bp region restricts the early transcriptional response to high cell density in temporal studies of promoter activity during BC3H1 myogenic cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1527440198,"Abstract The genes encoding the four acidic ribosomal phosphoproteins have been inactivated in Saccharomyces cerevisae by recombination with truncated genes carrying different genetic markers. By crossing single haploid disruptants, strains harboring two simultaneously inactivated acidic protein genes were constructed. None of the six possible double disruptions was lethal, but the simultaneous inactivation of either YP1 alpha and YP1 beta(L44') or YP2 alpha(L44) and YP2 beta(L45) caused an important decrease in the cell growth rate. Ribosomes isolated from these slow-growing strains did not contain acidic proteins, not even the two polypeptides whose genes were still intact, although these proteins were present in the cell extracts and they seem to be able to form high-molecular weight protein complexes. Transformation of a slow-growing double transformant with a plasmid containing one of the disrupted genes restored the presence of the acidic proteins in the ribosomes and normal growth rates. The particles of the slow-growing strains were active in an in vitro amino acid polymerizing system, although their activity could be stimulated by the exogenous addition of the missing proteins. These results indicate that in the absence of either YP1 alpha and YP1 beta(L44') or YP2 alpha (L44) and YP2 beta(L45), the remaining acidic proteins are unable to interact with the ribosome in a stable manner, but that a strong interaction of these ribosomal components with the particle is not an absolute requirement for in vivo and in vitro protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1495282340,"Two different chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPG) in embryonic chick brain were distinguished by immunoreactivity either with S103L, a rat monoclonal antibody which reacts specifically with an 11-amino-acid region in the chondroitin sulfate domain of the core protein of chick cartilage CSPG (Krueger, R. C., Jr., Fields, T. A., Mensch, J. R., and Schwartz, N. B. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 12088-12097), or with HNK-1, a mouse monoclonal antibody which reacts with a 3-sulfoglucuronic acid residue on neural glycolipids and glycoproteins (Chou, D. K. H., Ilyas, A., Evans, J. E. Costello, C., Quarles, R. H., and Jungawala, F. B. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 11717-11725) but not with both antibodies. This specific immunoreactivity was used to separate the two CSPGs for further characterization. The S103L reactive brain proteoglycan had a core protein of similar size to cartilage CSPG (370 kDa) but exhibited a smaller hydrodynamic size (K(av) of 0.308). It was substituted predominantly with chondroitin sulfate chains and virtually no keratan sulfate chains. The HNK-1 reactive CSPG had a smaller core protein (340 kDa), an even smaller hydrodynamic size (K(av) of 0.564), and was substituted with both chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate chains. Glycosidase digestion patterns with endo-beta-galactosidase, N-glycosidase F, neuraminidase, and O-glycosidase, and reactivity with an antibody to the hyaluronate binding region also showed significant differences between the two brain CSPGs. Expression of the S103L reactive brain CSPG was developmentally regulated from embryonic day 7 through 19 with a peak in core protein on day 13, and in mRNA expression at day 10. In contrast the HNK-1 reactive brain CSPG was constitutively present from day 7 through hatching. These data suggest that these two distinct core proteins are immunologically and biochemically unique translation products of two different CSPG genes."
https://openalex.org/W1541747676,"Cleavage of prorenin's prosegment causes irreversible formation of renin. In contrast, renin activity is reversibly exposed when prorenin is acidified to pH 3.3. Nonetheless, acidification of plasma results in irreversible activation of prorenin, because endogenous proteases cleave the prosegment of acid-activated prorenin. Chilling of plasma results in irreversible cryoactivation of prorenin. In this study we investigated whether cryoactivation of purified prorenin is reversible. The intrinsic renin activity of recombinant human prorenin was measured by an enzyme kinetic assay using partially purified human angiotensinogen as substrate. Results are expressed as a percent (mean +/- S.E.) of the maximal activity exposed after limited proteolysis by trypsin. The intrinsic renin activity of two pools (0.3 and 0.06 Goldblatt units/ml) was 1.5% +/- 0.3 and 1.2% +/- 0.6 at 37 degrees C. Activity increased to 19% +/- 0.3 and 26% +/- 0.5 after incubation at 0 degrees C and to 5.4% +/- 0.5 and 2.1% +/- 1.2 at room temperature. Cryoactivation did not occur in buffers containing more than 1 M NaCl. It took 8 min at 37 degrees C or 180 min at room temperature for cryoactivated prorenin to lose half of its intrinsic renin activity. It took 48 and 26 h, respectively, at 0 degree C for the two pools of prorenin at 37 degrees C to regain half of their maximum intrinsic activity at 0 degrees C. A direct immunoradiometric assay that detects active renin but not prorenin was able to detect cryoactivated prorenin. These results show that human prorenin can be reversibly cryoactivated in buffers of low ionic strength and has greater intrinsic activity at room temperature than at 37 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W1583773242,"Involucrin is a 68-kDa precursor of the keratinocyte cornified envelope. During keratinocyte terminal differentiation glutamine residues of involucrin become covalently cross-linked to other envelope precursors via covalent epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl)lysine bonds. In the present study we examine the secondary and tertiary structure of human involucrin using computer algorithms, circular dichroism, and electron microscopy. Our results indicate that involucrin is an extended, flexible, rod-shaped molecule that has a length of 460 A, an axial ratio of 30:1 and possesses between 50 and 75% alpha-helical content. Glutamine residues are circumferentially distributed along the length of the alpha-helical segments of the molecule, a distribution that is conserved in all species. We hypothesize that this distribution of glutamine residues together with the elongated shape of the molecule permits optimal interaction of involucrin glutamyl side chains with the lysine residues of other para-membranous proteins during transglutaminase-mediated cross-linking. Moreover, its long length allows involucrin to cross-link molecules that are separated by substantial distances in the cornified envelope. These properties allow a single involucrin molecule to form multiple cross-links, in multiple spatial planes, with other envelope precursors. Thus, the structure of involucrin is that of an ideal intermolecular cross-bridge."
https://openalex.org/W1484236229,"The structural and functional roles of the single asparagine (N)-linked oligosaccharide chain of Band 3 (AE1), the anion transport protein of the human erythrocyte membrane, were examined. Purified Band 3 (M(r) = 95,000) in 0.1% octaethylene glycol mono n-dodecyl ether (C12E8) detergent solution was deglycosylated using N-glycosidase F. This treatment sharpened the protein band on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and decreased its apparent molecular weight by 5,000. The purified membrane domain could be deglycosylated under similar conditions, causing a shift from a broad band centered at 55 kDa to a sharp 46-kDa band. Band 3 was shown to bind tomato lectin, and loss of lectin binding on blots provided a sensitive assay for deglycosylation. Carbohydrate analysis revealed that greater than 80% of the oligosaccharide could be removed from Band 3 by N-glycosidase F digestion. The deglycosylated protein maintained its dimeric structure and level of detergent binding but had a smaller Stokes radius (RS = 72 A) than native Band 3 (RS = 75 A). The Stokes radius of the membrane domain (RS = 60 A) also decreased upon deglycosylation (RS = 58 A). Circular dichroism studies showed that deglycosylation did not change the secondary structure of Band 3 or the membrane domain. The sensitivity of Band 3 or the membrane domain to proteolytic digestion by trypsin or proteinase K was also unaffected by deglycosylation. The deglycosylated protein aggregated more rapidly and was much more readily precipitable by ammonium sulfate. The deglycosylated protein bound the anion transport inhibitor 4-benzamido-4'-amino-stilbene-2,2'-disulfonate with the same affinity (Kd = 1 microM) as the native protein. Transport studies using reconstituted Band 3 and resealed ghosts showed that deglycosylated Band 3 retained its ability to transport anions. We conclude that removal of the oligosaccharide chain from Band 3 and any resultant structural changes had no effect on the transport function of this protein."
https://openalex.org/W1588124691,"The interaction of heparin (HP) with the cell-surface components of a human uterine epithelial carcinoma cell line (RL95) was studied. Binding of [3H]HP to cell surfaces was saturable in a dose- and time-dependent manner. HP and certain forms of heparan sulfate (HS) efficiently compete for [3H]HP binding. In contrast, other glycosaminoglycans, such as chondroitin sulfate, keratan sulfate, hyaluronic acid, and dermatan sulfate, do not compete for binding to these sites. Scatchard analysis revealed that [3H]HP bound to these sites with an apparent KD of 0.7-0.9 microM and a binding capacity of 9 x 10(6) sites/cell to attached cells. EDTA-detached cells displayed a similar apparent KD, but an approximately 2-fold increase in binding capacity. Protease digestion of cells on ice markedly reduced [3H]HP binding, indicating that these binding sites were associated with proteins. In contrast, heparinase treatment of cells stimulated binding by approximately 2-fold, indicating that a large fraction of these binding sites were occupied with endogenous ligand. We examined the structural features of HP/HS required for HP/HS binding. O-Sulfation, substitution of amino groups, and, to a lesser extent, the presence of carboxyl groups were important recognition features of HP/HS by cell-surface HP/HS-binding sites. N-Sulfation was not required. Photoaffinity labeling with 125I-sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(p-azidosalicylamido)-ethyl-1, 3-dithiopropionate-HP was used to identify HP/HS-binding proteins on RL95 cell surfaces. Proteins with M(r) values of 14,000-18,500 and 31,000 were photolabeled at the surfaces of attached cells. Photolabeling was blocked by the addition of excess HP, but not chondroitin sulfate. Additional proteins with M(r) values greater than 31,000 were photolabeled specifically on EDTA-detached cells. Moreover, the M(r) 14,000-18,500 and 31,000 proteins were retained on the EDTA-detached cells. These observations indicated that certain cell-surface HP/HS-binding proteins were not exposed when cells were attached to substrata. Proteins of similar M(r) values as the photolabeled components as well as many additional proteins were identified by heparin-agarose chromatographic selection of extracts of cells labeled metabolically with [35S]methionine or vectorially with Na125I at the cell surface. Fragments of cell-surface HP/HS-binding proteins were released from intact RL95 and mouse uterine epithelial cells by mild trypsinization and isolated by heparin-agarose affinity chromatography. Three peptides with M(r) values between 6000 and 14,000 required greater than 0.5 M salt for elution from heparin-agarose, retained HP binding activity in a 125I-HP gel overlay assay, and selectively bound [3H]HP in a solid-phase binding assay.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1549493910,"Southern blot analyses of genomic DNA fragments suggest there are five different classes of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL, EC 4.3.1.5) genomic sequence in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum). Isolation and subsequent sequence analysis of three examples from genomic libraries reveal highly homologous coding sequences but also a surprisingly high frequency of single point mutations which would truncate protein synthesis. The nucleotide sequence for one of the genes (PAL5) encodes a normal polypeptide of 721 amino acids, interrupted by a 710-base pair intron in the codon for amino acid 139. In contrast, premature stop codons, 363 triplets from the end in PAL1 and 304 triplets from the end in PAL3 would result in substantially (51-43%) shorter polypeptides that are consistent with the protein polymorphism, recently reported in alfalfa (Jorrin, J., and Dixon, R. A. (1990) Plant Physiol. 92, 447-445) but ascribed to protein degradation. S1 mapping of the mRNA termini and polymerase chain reaction analysis of cDNA transcripts indicate that at least one of these truncated coding sequences is expressed, strongly suggesting that at least some of the shorter polypeptides constitute original gene products with a potentially important function."
https://openalex.org/W1533167268,"The complete primary structure of the peroxisomal flavoenzyme D-aspartate oxidase from beef kidney has been determined by analyses of the peptides obtained through fragmentation of the carboxymethylated protein with trypsin, CNBr, heptafluorobutyric acid/CNBr and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. The protein consists of a single polypeptide of 338 residues, accounting for a M(r) of 37,305 for the apoprotein. A form of the enzyme lacking Lys-338 and therefore ending with Pro-337 has been detected. The N-terminal residue is blocked. Seven cysteines and no disulfide bridges are present. Residue 228 can be either Ile or Val. Thus, D-aspartate oxidase presents two types of heterogeneity in the polypeptide chain in addition to the one already described concerning the possible content of FAD or 6-hydroxyflavin adenine dinucleotide. Comparison of the primary structure of D-aspartate oxidase with other known sequences reveals that D-aspartate oxidase is homologous with D-amino acid oxidase (another flavo-oxidase) and does not present significant sequence similarities with any other protein, including flavoenzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1480087757,"Soluble epoxide hydrolase purified from soybean catalyzes trans-addition of water across the oxirane ring of cis-9,10-epoxystearic acid with inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon, yielding threo-9,10-dihydroxystearic acid. Kinetic analyses of the progress curves, obtained at low substrate concentrations (i.e. [S] much less than Km), and determination of the enantiomeric excess of the residual substrate by chiral-phase high-performance liquid chromatography at different reaction times, indicate that the epoxide hydrolase hydrates preferentially cis-9R, 10S-epoxystearic acid (V/Km ratio, approximately 20). Interestingly, this enantiomer is obtained by epoxidation of oleic acid catalyzed by peroxygenase, a hydroperoxide-dependent oxidase, we have previously described in soybean (Blee, E., and Schuber, F. (1990) J.Biol. Chem. 265, 12887-12894). For the epoxide hydrolase to show high enantioselectivity there must be a free carboxylic acid functionality on the substrate which probably influences its positioning within the active site. This selectivity, which in principle can be used for kinetic resolution of the cis-9,10-epoxystearic acid enantiomers, is much reduced with methyl cis-9,10-epoxystearate. 18O-Labeling experiments indicate that water attacks both cis-9,10-epoxystearic acid enantiomers on the oxirane carbon which has the S-chirality. Results show that soybean epoxide hydrolase produces exclusively threo-9R,10R-dihydroxystearic acid, i.e. a naturally occurring metabolite in higher plants. cis-9,10-Epoxy-18-hydroxystearic acid, a cutin monomer, was a poorer substrate of the epoxide hydrolase than 9,10-epoxystearic acid (V/Km ratio for the preferred enantiomers, approximately 19). From a physiological point of view, peroxygenase and this newly described epoxide hydrolase could be responsible, in vivo, for the biosynthesis of a class of oxygenated fatty acid compounds known to be involved in cutin monomers production and in plant defense mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1591658602,"Interleukin 4 (IL-4) is a potent, pleiotropic lymphokine that affects a variety of cells, especially those of hematopoietic origin. Although murine and human IL-4 are homologous proteins, they display a species specificity in which murine IL-4 acts only upon mouse cells, and human IL-4 only upon human cells. We have used a mutagenesis strategy to define both the structural determinants of this specificity and a receptor binding domain of murine IL-4. To do this, we developed convenient solid-phase binding assays for mouse and for human IL-4, each utilizing receptor-immunoglobulin fusion proteins and alkaline phosphatase-tagged ligands. These were employed to assess the receptor binding activities of wild type and mutant forms of IL-4. In a separate biological assay, we measured the ability of each version of IL-4 to induce proliferation of a cultured mouse T-cell line. By replacing regions of mouse IL-4 with homologous segments of human IL-4, we found that the amino-terminal 16 residues and the carboxyl-terminal 20 residues of murine IL-4 are required for species-specific receptor binding as well as for T-cell proliferation. A major portion of the amino acid sequence between these regions can be substituted between mouse and human without loss of receptor binding or biological activity. Further, alanine-scanning mutagenesis revealed specific residues in the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions (Glu-12, Ile-14, Leu-104, Asp-106, Phe-107, and Leu-111) that bear side chains critical for function. An analysis of the carboxyl-terminal region of murine IL-4 and its comparison with carboxyl-terminal regions of other related cytokines suggest an evolutionary conservation of structural and functional features."
https://openalex.org/W1583090955,"The bulk flow model of intracellular trafficking predicts that forward transport from the ER through the Golgi to the plasma membrane proceeds by default without a special signal being required (Wieland, F.T., Gleason, M. L., Serafini, T. A., and Rothman, J. E. (1987) Cell 50, 289-300). We tested a crucial prediction of this model, which is that the endogenous lipid components of the transport vesicles would reach the plasma membrane at the rapid rate of bulk flow. The rate at which endogenous glycosphingolipids moved from the ER through the Golgi to the plasma membrane was determined in Chinese hamster ovary cells using metabolic labeling with tritiated palmitate and oxidation of cell surface ganglioside NeuAc alpha 2—-3Gal beta 1—-4Glc beta 1—-4Cer (GM3) with periodate. Whereas radioactive precursor became incorporated into ceramide and glucosyl ceramide without a detectable lag, synthesis of labeled lactosyl ceramide and ganglioside GM3 did not begin until 5-6 min and 11-12 min, respectively, after addition of labeled precursor. Labeled GM3 reached the plasma membrane 5-6 min following its synthesis. Overall, approximately 18 min transpired from the time that the ceramide precursor was synthesized in the ER until labeled GM3 reached the plasma membrane. These results indicate that lipid transport vesicles move rapidly to the plasma membrane at a rate consistent with bulk flow estimates."
https://openalex.org/W1519366407,"A Bacillus subtilis open reading frame (ORF) encoding a predicted polypeptide of 156 amino acids was subcloned and sequenced. The polypeptide was found to be homologous to CheW of Escherichia coli, sharing 28.6% amino acid identity. The ORF was verified by using a bacteriophage T7 expression system in E. coli. The gene was inactivated by insertion of a nonpolor chloramphenicol acetyltransferase cassette in its N-terminal region. In the absence of chemoeffectors, the mutant displayed a smooth swimming bias, with some tumbling. The CheW- mutant was defective on swarm plates but was complemented by a plasmid that expressed wild type CheW. Addition of attractant or repellent to the CheW- mutant resulted in transient smooth swimming or tumbling, respectively. However, capillary assays revealed that chemotaxis was substantially impaired in the mutant strain."
https://openalex.org/W1587138359,"A highly specific D-hydroxyisovalerate (D-HIV) dehydrogenase, which is a key enzyme in depsipeptide synthesis, was purified to near homogeneity from the enniatin-producing fungus Fusarium sambucinum. The enzyme catalyzes the reversible reaction of 2-ketoisovalerate (2-KIV) to D-HIV. It is strictly dependent on NADPH and exhibits a high substrate specificity with respect to 2-KIV. NADH was not accepted by the enzyme. Km values for 2-KIV and NADPH were found to be 200 and 333 microM, respectively. D-HIV dehydrogenase consists of a single polypeptide chain with a molecular mass of about 53 kDa. Optimum temperature for the reduction of 2-KIV was 35 degrees C and for the oxidation reaction was 45 degrees C. The optimum pH was found to be 7 for the reduction and 8-9 for the oxidation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1618010486,"Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is a serine protease inhibitor that inhibits both tissue-type and urokinase-type plasminogen activators. Expression of PAI-1 is regulated by growth factors, cytokines, and hormones. To determine the molecular mechanisms involved in the basal expression of the rat PAI-1 gene, we have analyzed the cis-acting sequences and the trans-acting factors involved in the transcription of this gene in the HTC rat hepatoma cell line. DNase I protection analyses revealed eight regions within the first 764 base pairs of 5'-flanking sequence that interact specifically with HTC cell nuclear proteins. The proteins that bind to five of the eight footprinted sites were identified as PEA3-, Sp1-, and CTF/NF-1-like proteins using competition electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The expression of fusion genes containing progressive 5' deletions of the rat PAI-1 promoter linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene were analyzed in transient transfection experiments in HTC cells. These studies demonstrated the Sp1 and CTF/NF-1 sites to be important for transcriptional activation. Two of the footprinted sites contain the sequence 5'-TTTGn(n)TCAAT-3' and were shown in competition electrophoretic mobility shift assays to bind the same or related protein(s). Sequences containing these sites, from -764 to -628 base pairs, and from -266 to -188 base pairs, were identified in functional studies as repressor elements of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1517818262,"A new protein of Salmonella typhimurium was identified and characterized. The gene (tlpA) encoding this protein (TlpA) was isolated from the large virulence-associated plasmid of S. typhimurium and sequenced in order to predict the primary structure of TlpA. tlpA encodes a 371-amino acid soluble protein with a calculated M(r) of 41600 and pI of 4.63. Secondary structure predictions and sequence statistics of TlpA indicated a predominant alpha-helical configuration and presence of heptapeptide repeat motifs characteristic of coiled coil proteins. Purified TlpA was shown to have biochemical properties similar to those of coiled coil proteins, including adoption of an alpha-helical configuration and a tendency to form homodimers. Furthermore, TlpA possessed heat resistance, evidence for a chain register and altered mobility in urea/sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels which are characteristics of tropomyosins. TlpA shows 32% overall sequence similarity with rat cardiac myosin and 36% similarity with horse platelet beta-tropomyosin over 226 residues, whereas selected regions possessed significant sequence identities with myosins, tropomyosins, and alpha-helical surface proteins of Streptococcus pyogenes. Our results indicate that TlpA represents a new member of prokaryotic coiled coil proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1552766214,"The gene encoding arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase was cloned from a porcine EMBL3 genomic library using a cDNA probe of the enzyme, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The gene consists of 14 exons with 13 introns, and spans approximately 8 kilobases. Analysis of splice junctions indicated that all of the splice donor and acceptor sites conformed to the GT/AG rule. An approximately 1-kilobase region upstream of the coding sequence contains nine GC-boxes for potential Sp1-binding sites at positions -77, -135, -145, -165, -214, -636, -643, -684, and -813. There are two sets of AP-2 binding sequence at positions -234 and -402. Neither typical TATA box nor CCAAT box is found in this region. The transcriptional start site was determined by primer extension analysis, and was tentatively identified as a cytidine residue located 19 bases upstream from initiation codon. Southern blot analysis revealed the presence of one copy of 12-lipoxygenase gene per haploid genome. We found striking similarities in genomic organization as well as the promoter sequences between the porcine 12-lipoxygenase and the rabbit 15-lipoxygenase genes, suggesting that these genes are evolutionarily related."
https://openalex.org/W1508313396,"Fractions enriched in Golgi membranes were prepared from rat liver by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. These enriched membranes were further subfractionated on the basis of their solubilities in EGTA, 150 mM sodium carbonate, pH 11.5, sodium deoxycholate, Triton X-100, or sodium dodecyl sulfate. This led to isolation of peripheral, luminal, and integral membrane proteins of the Golgi-enriched membranes. Luminal and membrane proteins were further purified by wheat germ agglutinin and concanavalin A lectin affinity chromatographies. Some proteins from these lectin columns were resolved by preparative gel electrophoresis and microsequenced. Subsequently, antibodies were produced for two proteins by immunization of either mice or rabbits. Immunofluorescence microscopy suggests that these proteins are confined to Golgi apparatus-like structures. The protocol described is well suited for the study of organelle structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W1526553788,"Binding Ca2+ to a high affinity site in protein C and 4-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)-domainless protein C results in a conformational change that is required for activation by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex, the natural activator of protein C. It has been hypothesized that this high affinity Ca(2+)-binding site is located in the NH2-terminal epidermal growth factor (EGF) homology region of protein C. We have expressed in human 293 cells a deletion mutant of protein C (E2-PD) which lacks the entire Gla region as well as the NH2-terminal EGF homology region of protein C. Ca2+ inhibits activation of E2-PD or Gla-domainless protein C by thrombin with half-maximal inhibition occurring at Ca2+ concentrations of 103 +/- 11 and 70 +/- 7 microM, respectively, but is required for both E2-PD and Gla-domainless protein C activation by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex with half-maximal acceleration occurring at Ca2+ concentrations of 87 +/- 8 and 89 +/- 8 microM, respectively. Both E2-PD and Gla-domainless protein C exhibit a reversible, Ca(2+)- but not Mg(2+)-dependent decrease (6 +/- 1%) in fluorescence emission intensity with Kd = 38 +/- 3 microM Ca2+. We conclude that the high affinity Ca(2+)-binding site important for the activation of protein C is located outside of the NH2-terminal EGF homology region and that the metal-binding site in the NH2-terminal EGF homology region may not be a high affinity site in intact protein C."

This primer tRNA(iMet) fragment is thought to be produced by cleavage within the mature tRNA(iMet) sequence. We call this cleavage hyperprocessing. We have previously reported that catalytic RNA of RNase P from Escherichia coli (M1RNA) cleaves the synthetic tRNA(iMet) precursor in vitro at several sites within the mature tRNA sequence. Based on this result, we proposed a model for formation of the primer tRNA fragment involving RNase P. Here we show that natural tRNA(iMet) prepared from Drosophila adult flies can be cleaved by M1RNA. Using mutant tRNA(iMet) substrates, we also show that these cleavages are dependent on the occurrence of an altered conformation of the tRNA substrate. This is evidence that a tRNA can exist in aqueous solution at least in part in an altered conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1632220716,"A minigene encoding rat retinol-binding protein (RBP) was transfected into HeLa cells, which do not express endogenous RBP, transthyretin, or cellular retinol-binding protein. The HeLa cells manufactured and secreted the transfected gene product, demonstrating that RBP-transthyretin assembly is not a requirement for the secretion of RBP. When HeLa cells were grown under vitamin A-deficient conditions, RBP accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum. Both serum and retinol stimulated secretion of RBP in a concentration-dependent manner. The retinol-regulated secretion occurred also after protein synthesis had been blocked by cycloheximide. Addition of holo-RBP or retinal, but not retinoic acid, stimulated secretion of RBP. Thus, an in vitro model system that resembles the rat hepatocyte in vivo with regard to the known regulation of RBP secretion has been established in a human cell line of extrahepatic origin. It can be concluded that cellular retinol-binding protein is not required for the transfer of retinol to RBP and that the mechanism whereby retinol controls the intracellular transport of RBP is neither specific for tissues synthesizing RBP nor species-specific. To investigate the structural properties responsible for the endoplasmic reticulum retention of RBP in the absence of its ligand, a cDNA encoding chicken purpurin, a protein that is 50% identical to RBP and that binds retinol, was expressed in HeLa cells. In contrast to RBP, purpurin was not retained in vitamin A-deficient HeLa cells."

https://openalex.org/W1498645492,"Two known tissue-specific tropomyosin (TM) isoforms are produced from the rodent beta-TM gene. Skeletal muscle beta-TM uses the alternative exons 6b and 9a and the exon 9a-associated poly(A) site. Fibroblast and smooth muscle TM-1 use exons 6a and 9b and the exon-9b associated poly(A) site. We have identified a new skeletal muscle beta-TM isoform, beta-TM2. beta-TM2 contains exon 6b (muscle) and exon 9b (nonmuscle). Full-length beta-TM2 cDNA clones were isolated from a cDNA library of mouse muscle BC3H1 cells. Its mRNA was also found in mouse skeletal muscle tissue but not in other tissues. beta-TM2 mRNA level and protein synthesis are differentiation-dependent, with a transient high level in the early stages of myogenesis both in BC3H1 cells and in mouse embryo limbs. Trace amounts of beta-TM3 mRNA, the other hybrid form (exons 6a + 9a), were found in less differentiated BC3H1 cells, mouse uterus, heart, and 3T3 fibroblasts but not skeletal muscle tissue. Thus, the selection of the two alternative exons appears to be controlled independently. Furthermore, during myogenesis, there is a sequential switch in the internal alternative exon, the terminal exon, and the poly(A) site from the nonmuscle to the muscle type."
https://openalex.org/W2156396050,"UDPglucose 4-epimerase from Kluyveromyces fragilis was earlier shown to have two conformationally vicinal thiols at the active site. Upon treatment with diamide, these thiols form a disulfide linkage across the subunits that results in coordinated loss of catalytic activity and coenzyme fluorescence (Ray, M., and Bhaduri, A. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 10777-10786). Employing a number of thiol-specific reagents, we now suggest discriminatory and nonidentical roles for these two thiols. Kinetic and statistical analysis of 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and N-ethylmaleimide modification reaction of epimerase show that only one thiol is essential for activity. Consecutive modification experiments clearly show that the same active thiol is modified in both cases. However, significant differences are observed when the reactivity of these reagents is monitored in terms of coenzyme fluorescence. Treatment with N-ethylmaleimide leads to a form of inactive enzyme that fully retains its fluorescent properties whereas modification with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), on the other hand, results in the loss of both activity and fluorescence. The closely spaced nonessential second thiol, which is not modified by N-ethylmaleimide is therefore involved in generating and maintaining the coenzyme fluorescence. Modification studies with a series of spin-labeled maleimide shows that only 3-(maleimidomethyl)proxyl causes partial quenching of coenzyme fluorescence. This suggests that the active thiol is situated at a distance of 4.5 A approximately from the coenzyme fluorophore."
https://openalex.org/W1491094771,"The thermal behavior of gamma II, gamma IIIA, gamma IIIB, and gamma IVA crystallin, from calorimetric and spectral studies, has been analyzed in terms of selective unfolding of domains, interdomain interactions, conformational stability, and the existence of intermediates in the order-disorder transition equilibrium. The major endothermic transition (Tm) observed calorimetrically for all four fractions occurs between 67 and 78 degrees C, with enthalpy change (delta H) from 80 to 150 kcal/mol, values that agree reasonably well with those from spectroscopic measurements. gamma II and gamma IIIB show a second thermal event at T less than Tm whereas gamma IIIA and gamma IVA showed no additional transition. Urea-induced equilibrium unfolding of gamma II at acidic pH, unlike gamma IVA, is biphasic as monitored by CD and fluorescence, indicating the existence of an intermediate. The absence of a cooperative transition in gamma IVA in acidic urea and the appearance of a single endotherm in differential scanning calorimetry at low pH have been attributed to a structured intermediate that melts at low temperature. The difference in the folding/unfolding of gamma II and gamma IVA has been explained by subtle differences in the packing arrangement of their two domains and interactions between them. Thermal aggregation of gamma-crystallins could be prevented either by preincubation with ionic detergents or at low pH or in the presence of chemical denaturant, indicating that the protein surface charge and solvent polarity influence their stability. An increase in the 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate-bound fluorescence during heat denaturation also suggests that the thermal aggregation is governed by hydrophobic interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1577882541,"Bacteriophage P1 encodes several regulatory elements for the lytic or lysogenic response, which are located in the immC, immI, and immT regions. Their products are the C1 repressor of lytic functions with the C1 inactivator protein Coi, the C4 repressor of antirepressor synthesis and the modulator protein Bof, respectively. We have studied in vitro the interaction of the components of the immC and immT regions with C1-controlled operators using highly purified Bof, C1, and Coi proteins. Bof protein (M(r) = 9,800) does not interact with C1 repressor alone, but as shown by DNA mobility shift experiments, in the presence of C1 repressor Bof binds to all operators tested by forming a C1.Bof-operator DNA ternary complex. The effect of this complex formation was studied in more detail with the operator of the c1 gene. Here, Bof only marginally alters the C1 repressor footprint at Op99a,b, but nevertheless considerably influences the repressibility of the operator.promoter element: (i) the autoregulated c1 mRNA synthesis is further down-regulated and (ii) the ability of Coi protein to dissociate the C1.operator DNA complex is strongly inhibited. We suggest that Bof protein functions by modulating C1 repression of many widely dispersed operators on the prophage genome."
https://openalex.org/W1530034357,"Abstract Previous reports from this laboratory have demonstrated that lamin B is reversibly methylesterified in a cell cycle-dependent manner. The site of this methylation, however, was not identified. In this report, we describe a single major methylated product obtained following reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis of peptides generated by proteolytic digestion of lamin B from rat liver nuclear envelopes. This peptide was retained on a lamin B COOH-terminal-specific antibody-affinity column, and COOH-terminal localization was confirmed by amino acid sequencing. Two other COOH-terminal peptides were found but were not methylated and differed in sequence by at least a single residue from the methylated peptide, indicating the existence of two lamin B gene products. Tetrapeptides, representing the putative mature COOH termini of lamin B, K-ras-2A, and unprocessed lamin A, were synthesized with or without farnesyl modification of the COOH-terminal cysteines. All three farnesylated peptides served as substrates for the partially purified lamin B methyltransferase with apparent Km values of 4.5, 0.69, and 21 microM, respectively. Nonfarnesylated peptides were not substrates for the enzyme. The three farnesylated peptides were also effective to varying degrees at inhibiting the methylation of lamin B and other cellular proteins in cell lysates."
https://openalex.org/W1624912441,"The metamorphosis of insects can, in a general way, be divided between those organisms that undergo pupation accompanied by cellular histolysis and those that gradually develop into adults without an intervening pupal stage of development. In the former case, the death of a cell population is an integral part of development that is tightly associated with massive DNA degradation during pupation. In that regard, it has been suggested that uracil-containing DNA acts as a target for the nucleolytic breakdown of DNA during histolysis in insects (Deutsch, W. A. (1987) Mutat. Res. 184, 209-215), thus placing into question how compatible the existence of uracil-DNA glycosylases would be for this form of developmental signal. As a result, we tested for the presence of a uracil-DNA glycosylase in insects representative of those having an intervening pupal stage of development and those that do not. We show here that a nonpupating insect contains a uracil-DNA glycosylase activity. Conversely, crude extracts of Drosophila melanogaster, as well as of three other insect populations that undergo pupation similar to that found in Drosophila, do not contain detectable levels of this DNA repair activity. Thus, there appears to be a consistent correlation between cellular destruction during development and the absence of a uracil-DNA glycosylase, which supports the possibility that uracil-containing DNA may play an important role in those cells targeted for death."
https://openalex.org/W1484384125,"UDPglucose 4-epimerase from Kluyveromyces fragilis was completely inactivated by diethylpyrocarbonate following pseudo-first order reaction kinetics. The pH profile of diethylpyrocarbonate inhibition and reversal of inhibition by hydroxylamine suggested specific modification of histidyl residues. Statistical analysis of the residual enzyme activity and the extent of modification indicated modification of 1 essential histidine residue to be responsible for loss in catalytic activity of yeast epimerase. No major structural change in the quarternary structure was observed in the modified enzyme as shown by the identical elution pattern on a calibrated Sephacryl 200 column and association of coenzyme NAD to the apoenzyme. Failure of the substrates to afford any protection against diethylpyrocarbonate inactivation indicated the absence of the essential histidyl residue at the substrate binding region of the active site. Unlike the case of native enzyme, sodium borohydride failed to reduce the pyridine moiety of the coenzyme in the diethylpyrocarbonate-modified enzyme. This indicated the presence of the essential histidyl residue in close proximity to the coenzyme binding region of the active site. The abolition of energy transfer phenomenon between the tryptophan and coenzyme fluorophore on complete inactivation by diethylpyrocarbonate without any loss of protein or coenzyme fluorescence are also added evidences in this direction."
https://openalex.org/W1560338948,"Abstract A receptor uniquely found on the surface of rat Kupffer cells was shown previously to bind oligosaccharides terminating in galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, and fucose. To analyze further the binding specificity of the receptor, receptor-mediated adhesion of transfected COS cells to immobilized glycolipids of known structure was measured. The glycolipid Gb4Cer (GalNAc beta 1-3Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1Cer) was the best ligand. Gb5Cer (GalNAc alpha 1-3GalNAc beta 1-3Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1Cer) and LacCer (Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1Cer) bound more weakly (five times less than Gb4Cer) and Gb3Cer (Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1Cer), and g3Cer(GalNAc beta 1-4Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1Cer) bound even more weakly (60 times less than Gb4Cer). Gangliosides did not support adhesion of transfected cells. The adhesion of COS cells transfected with plasmids encoding variants of the receptor was also examined. In each variant, either tryptophan 498 or 523, which are conserved in most C-type lectins, was replaced by one of several amino acids. Variants that retained binding activity had the same specificity as the normal receptor. Differences between variants were noted, however, in maximal levels of adhesion and these differences correlated with altered expression of the receptor variants in COS cells."
https://openalex.org/W1548009302,"We have metabolically labeled the human pancreatic tumor cell line PANC-1 with high specific activity tritiated sugar precursors to study the expression of glycosphingolipids by this cell type. We have used a combination of detergent solubilization, exhaustive protease digestion, ceramide glycanase digestion, and reverse-phase chromatography to isolate glycosphingolipid-derived oligosaccharides specifically labeled in their component sugars. A significant proportion of the oligosaccharides derived from polar glycosphingolipids were of high molecular mass (greater than 2000 Da). The results of compositional studies, lectin affinity chromatography, and methylation analysis suggested that this high molecular weight fraction consists of lactosaminoglycan type oligosaccharides derived from polyglycosylceramides. There are on average three beta 1-6 linked N-acetyllactosamine branches attached to the polylactosamine backbone in this type of glycosphingolipid-derived oligosaccharide. The majority of the oligosaccharides also contain 1-2 mol of sialic acid that are linked alpha 2-3 to penultimate galactose. The results indicate that PANC-1 cells, like human colorectal tumor cells, express highly extended neolacto type glycosphingolipids. However, the lactosaminoglycan sequences are highly branched, unlike those associated with colorectal tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1610613963,"Carbon monoxide chlorocruorin from Eudistylia vancouverii shows three distinct first-order relaxations with rates of 2.9 x 10(9) s-1, 6.5 x 10(7) s-1, and 3.2 x 10(6) s-1 (geminate reactions) and three second-order relaxations with rates of 4.7 x 10(6) M-1 s-1, 7 x 10(5) M-1 s-1, and 7 x 10(4) M-1 s-1, when studied by flash photolysis. The amplitudes of the second-order reactions depend on the extent of photolysis. This may be due to relaxation from the liganded (R) to the unliganded (T) conformation following photolysis and suggests that the combination rates contribute to cooperativity. In a stopped-flow experiment only the slowest phase with a rate of 7 x 10(4) M-1 s-1 is observed. It is assigned to binding to the T-state protein. Fragments of the native protein containing 12 and 4 hemes react like the holoprotein suggesting that the tetramer is a major cooperative unit. Oxygen binding shows three geminate relaxations with rates of 2.5 x 10(10) s-1, 3.5 x 10(7) s-1, and 4.5 x 10(6) s-1, and two second-order rates of 1.5 x 10(7) M-1 s-1 and 1 x 10(6) M-1 s-1. The amplitudes of the second-order phases do not correlate with the extent of photolysis. The results with the two ligands are consistent with an allosteric transition fast enough to compete with a rebinding rate of 500 s-1 in the R to T direction (CO rebinding) but not fast enough to compete with oxygen rebinding. There is significant heterogeneity in the R-state kinetics, but the T-state reaction is homogeneous."
