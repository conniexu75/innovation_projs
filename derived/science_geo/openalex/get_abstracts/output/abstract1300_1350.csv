https://openalex.org/W2059178379,"DNA sequencing methods have been used to determine a sequence of about 20 nucleotides at the 3' termini of various 18S (small ribosomal subunit) RNA molecules. Polyadenylated rRNA was first synthesized using the enzyme ATP:polynucleotidyl transferase from mainze. Then in the presence of an oligonucleotide primer uniquely complementary to the end of each adenylated rRNA, a cDNA copy was produced using AMV reverse transcriptase. In every case, the cDNA transcript was of finite size, which we ascribe to the appearance of an oligonucleotide containing m62A near the 3' end of the 18S rRNAs. Sequences at the 3' termini of 18S rRNA molecules from the four eucaryotic species examined here (mouse, silk worm, wheat embryo and slime mold) are highly conserved. They also exhibit strong homology to the 3' end of E. coli 16S rRNA. Two important differences, however, are apparent. First, the 16S sequence CCUCC, implicated in mRNA binding by E. coli ribosomes, is absent from each eucaryotic rRNA sequence. Second, a purine-rich region which exhibits extensive complementarity to the 5' noncoding regions of many eucaryotic mRNAs appears consistently."

https://openalex.org/W2125648721,"We have used video intensification microscopy to observe fluorescent derivatives of insulin, epidermal growth factor and alpha2-macroglobulin added to Swiss 3T3-4 cells. At 4 degrees C, each of these polypeptides binds diffusely to specific receptors on the cell surface. When the cells are warmed to 23 or 37 degrees C, the bound insulin epidermal growth factor or alpha2-macroglobulin rapidly forms patches on the cell surface and is internalized. Using fluorescein-labeled alpha2-macroglobulin and rhodamine-labeled derivatives of insulin and epidermal growth factor, we show that all three polypeptides are internalized within the same vesicles by a common pathway. The mechanism for the internalization of these molecules is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2075387470,"beta,beta'-Iminodipropionitrile (IDPN) administration prevented normal slow axonal transport of [35S]methionine- or [3H]leucine-labeled proteins in rat sciatic motor axons. Ultrastructural and electrophoretic studies showed that the neurofilament triplet proteins in particular were retained within the initial 5 millimeters of the axons, resulting in neurofilament-filled axonal swellings. Fast anterograde and retrograde axonal transport were not affected. The IDPN thus selectively impaired slow axonal transport. The neurofibrillary pathology in this model is the result of the defective slow transport of neurofilaments."

https://openalex.org/W2098832937,"Clones of cells were isolated from single virus-single cell infections of NIH/3T3 cells with Moloney murine leukemia virus. Approximately one third of such clones aberrantly expressed viral gene functions. One clone produced virus with altered plaque morphology, while others failed to produce particles able to make plaques on XC cells. In addition, clones that made particles lacking reverse transcriptase were found, and these did not synthesize the reverse transcriptase precursor Pr180 gag-pol. One clone (M23) lacked any detectable glycoprotein or reverse transcriptase. Despite these defects, each clone released particles of type C morphology, suggesting that gag gene function alone may be sufficient for particle production. All the particles contained viral RNA of 60-70S that was composed of the normal 35S size subunits except for M23, which had a deletion in the viral genome of approximately 1000-1500 nucleotides. A variety of defective clones were also isolated following infection of rat cells with Moloney virus. It is apparent that the murine leukemia virus genome is ofter mutated by spontaneous processes generating a wide range of phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2014974032,"The extent of invariance and heterogeneity in desmin, the major component of the muscle form of 100 Å filaments, has been investigated in avian and mammalian muscle and nonmuscle cells with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and indirect immunofluorescence. Desmin from chick, duck and quail, smooth, skeletal and cardiac muscle cells is resolved into two isoelectric variants, α and β, with each possessing the same charge and electrophoretic mobility in all three avian species irrespective of muscle type. Guinea pig and rat muscle desmin resolves into only one variant; it also possesses the same charge and electrophoretic mobility in the two mammalian species, but it is more acidic and slower in electrophoretic mobility than the two avian variants. In immunofluorescence, desmin is localized together with α-actinin along myofibril Z lines. Antibodies to chick smooth muscle desmin, prepared against the protein purified by preparative SDS gel electrophoresis prior to immunization, cross-react with myofibril Z lines in all three avian species. These antibodies do not cross-react with either rat or guinea pig myofibril Z lines. Similarly, they do not cross-react with avian or mammalian nonmuscle cells grown in tissue culture and known to contain cytoplasmic 100 Å filaments. These results demonstrate that desmin is highly conserved within avian muscle cells and within mammalian muscle cells. It is, however, both biochemically and immunologically distinguishable between avian and mammalian muscle cells, and between muscle and nonmuscle cells. We conclude that there are biochemically and immunologically specific forms of desmin for avian and mammalian muscle cells. Furthermore, within a particular vertebrate species, there are at least two separate classes of 100 Å filaments: the muscle class whose major component is desmin, and the nonmuscle class whose major component is distinct from desmin. Taking into consideration the immunological specificity reported by other laboratories for the 100 Å filaments in glial cells, for neurofilaments and for the epidermal 80 Å keratin filaments, we propose that a given vertebrate species contains at least four major distinguishable classes of 100 Å filaments: muscle 100 Å filaments (desmin filaments), glial filaments, neurofilaments and epidermal keratin filaments."

https://openalex.org/W2021159463,A monoclonal antibody recognizing a Forssman antigenic specificity has been shown to react with cells of the preimplantation mouse embryo. The antigen is believed to be carried on glycolipid molecules on teratocarcinoma stem cells. This antigen is first detected on the trophectoderm of the early blastocyst. The topography of the expression on the trophectoderm is striking and novel. The antigen is no longer found on these cells after the blastocyst has hatched from the zona pellucida in utero. Inner cell masses are antigen-positive at all times. This is the first study of the distribution of a single antigenic determinant in early mouse embryogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W1540517802,"We have found that double-stranded cDNA synthesized in extended reactions by avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase is suitable substrate for a variety of restriction endonucleases. Experiments in which rabbit reticulocyte mRNA was reverse-transcribed and restricted to generate beta-globin-specifihe nucleotide sequence of beta-globin mRNA. This method has been applied to study collagen mRNA synthesis in normal and Rous sarcoma virus (RSV)-transformed chick embryo fibroblasts. Characteristic sets of collagen cDNA restriction fragments were produced from RNA fractions rich in collagen message activity. These sets of cDNA fragments, generated by the restriction endonucleases Hae III and Hap II, provided a convenient marker for the presence of collagen mRNA sequences. Equal quantities of high molecular weight mRNA from chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF) and RSV-CEF were reverse-transcribed and the resulting cDNA was restricted. The relative yields of collagen cDNA fragments from such reactions strongly suggest that the decrease in functional collagen RNA following RSV-induced transformation of CEF represents a decrease in the copy number of collagen messenger sequences. The potential of this approach for the study of regulation in other systems is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1570012285,"The structure and the orientation of cytochrome c oxidase molecules in crystalline cytochrome c oxidase membranes (Vanderkooi, G., Senior, A.E., Capaldi, R.A., and Hayashi, H. (1972) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 274, 38-48) were studied by image analysis of electron micrographs and by reacting the crystalline preparations with immune gamma-globulins against individual cytochrome c oxidase subunits. Binding of gamma-globulins to the membranes was detected by the following two methods: (a) electrophoretic identification of gamma-globulin polypeptides in the washed membranes; (b) electron microscopic examination of the negatively stained membranes. The membranes bound immune gamma-globulins against subunit IV (which faces the matrix side in intact mitochondria) but failed to bind immune gamma-globulins against subunits II + III (which face the outer side of the inner membrane in intact mitochondria). In contrast, solubilized cytochrome c oxidase bound either of the two immune gamma-globulins. All cytochrome c oxidase molecules in the crystalline membranes are thus asymmetrically arranged so that subunit IV faces outward and subunits II + III face toward the interior. This orientation is opposite to that found with intact mitochondria. The data also suggest that the crystalline membranes form closed vesicles which are impermeable to externally added gamma-globulins."
https://openalex.org/W1976538429,"Abstract The body-walls of Caenorhabditis elegans contain two different myosin heavy chains (Epstein, Waterston and Brenner, 1974) that associate to form at least two species of myosin (Schachat, Harris and Epstein, 1977a). To better define the distribution of these heavy chains in myosin molecules, we have characterized the myosin of C. elegans by immunochemical methods. Specific, precipitating anti-myosin antibody has been prepared in rabbits using highly purified nematode myosin as the immunogen. The difference in reactivity of the anti-myosin antibody with wild-type myosin containing both kinds of heavy chains (designated unc -54 and non- unc -54 heavy chains on the basis of genetic specification) and myosin from the mutant E190 that lacks unc -54 heavy chains Indicates that there are antigenic differences between myosin molecules containing unc -54 heavy chains and myosin molecules containing only non- unc -54 heavy chains. Antibody specific for the unc -54 myosin determinants has been prepared by the immunoadsorption of anti-myosin antibody with E190 myosin. This specific anti- unc -54 myosin antibody precipitates myosin that contains only unc -54 heavy chains. At the limits of resolution of our immunoprecipitation techniques, we could detect no heterodimeric myosin molecules containing both unc -54 and non- unc -54 heavy chains. The body-wall myosins of C. elegans therefore exist only as homodimers of either class of heavy chain. This specific anti- unc -54 myosin antibody promises to be a valuable tool in elucidating the role of two myosins in body-wall muscle and in molecular characterizations of mutant myosins in C. elegans. We report here the use of this antibody to detect antigenic differences between unc -54 myosin from the wild-type and the muscle mutant E675. In conjunction with the original anti-myosin antibody, other studies show that both unc -54 and non- unc -54 myosins exist within the same body-wall muscle cells (Mackenzie, Schachat and Epstein, 1978) and that both myosins are coordinately synthesized during muscle development in C. elegans (Garcea, Schachat and Epstein, 1978). We discuss the implications of the self-association of unc -54 and non- unc -54 myosin heavy chains into homodimeric myosins within the same body-wall muscles with respect to the assembly of thick filaments and their organization into a regular lattice."

https://openalex.org/W176232030,"The recently described triplet probe depolarization technique has been utilized to investigated the rotational relaxation of free and protease-bound alpha2-macroglobulin. The molecular Stokes radius of the free globulin was found to be 88 A, a value which, when compared to the dry radius, indicates a high degree of hydration. The correlation time of alpha2-macroglobulin does not change after its binding with chymotrypsin, but slightly increases in the presence of plasmin. In the presence of 4 M urea, alpha2-macroglobulin dissociates into subunits and this dissociation does not lead to a release of the bound proteases."

It binds to the nuclear estrogen receptor and is antagonized by the antiestrogen tamoxifen. Kepone also induces egg white protein synthesis in vivo by direct interaction with estrogen receptors and by indirectly increasing the concentration of progesterone in the serum.
https://openalex.org/W1506089185,"The hydrodynamic behavior of bovine myelin basic protein was studied by gel filtration through Sephadex G-100 under conditions which included variations in pH from 2 to 12, variations in ionic strength from 0.01 to 1.5 M at pH 2 and from 0.1 to 2 M at pH 7, and variations in guanidinium chloride concentration from 0 to 6 M. A number of well characterized compact globular proteins were subjected to the same conditions for comparison. Compact globular proteins showed major conformational transitions due to acid, alkali, and guanidinium chloride denaturation and, possibly, minor transitions as well. Myelin basic protein behaved like a flexible linear polyelectrolyte, expanding continuously between pH 11 and pH 2 to 3 at ionic strength 0.1 M and contracting continuously with increase in ionic strength at pH 2 and at pH 7 to the point of salting-out. Relatively low concentrations of guanidinium chloride (approximately 0.5 M) were sufficient to cause the basic protein to expand. With increasing concentration of the denaturant the molecule continued to expand, but in a noncooperative manner. These results demonstrated the lack of significant intramolecular stabilization in the protein."

https://openalex.org/W1559557845,"alpha2u-Globulin is a male rat liver protein of Mr = 20,000 which is synthesized in the liver of adult male rats, secreted into the serum, and excreted in the urine. Its function is unknown. The hepatic synthesis of this protein is under complex hormonal control. We had previously shown that castration of male rats diminishes hepatic alpha2u-globulin synthesis and the level of its mRNA, and that administration of androgen to these castrated animals results in the reinduction of the synthesis of this protein and the level of its mRNA. We now report that alpha2u-globulin synthesis and the level of its mRNA can be fully reinduced in castrated males by administration of glucocorticoid alone. This induction is much more rapid than the androgenic induction and is inhibited by the glucocorticoid antagonist progesterone. Administration of glucocorticoid to intact male animals does not induce alpha2u-globulin synthesis above normal levels; however, if alpha2u-globulin synthesis has been depressed in intact male rats by pretreatment with estrogen or cyproterone acetate, the level of this protein can be reinduced by administration of glucocorticoids. The implications for the control of alpha2u-globulin gene expression are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2003853612,"We have identified an avian oncovirus-specific polypeptide of 120,000 dalton molecular weight (P120) in extracts of uninfected chick embryo fibroblast cells (CEF). P120 can be detected in CEF positive for the expression of avian oncovirus group-specific antigen (gs+), but its presence cannot be correlated with phenotypic expression of endogenous oncovirus envelope glycoprotein (chf). Immune precipitation experiments indicate that P120 contains antigenic determinants of the virion core proteins (products of the gag gene) and reverse transcriptase, but not of the envelope glycoprotein gp85. Double-label ion-exchange chromatography of tryptic digests of P120 reveals that this polypeptide contains amino acid sequences related to the virion core proteins p270, p19 and p12 of the chicken endogenous virus RAV-0, but lacks the tryptic peptides of p15. In addition, P120 contains three tryptic peptides which appear to be present in both the α and β subunits of reverse transcriptase. The order of the tryptic peptides on P120 was determined using the pactamycin procedure. The data demonstrate that the P120 tryptic peptides which are presumed to be related to reverse transcriptase lie between the gag region and the carboxy terminus of the protein. Our data are consistent with the idea that P120 is equivalent to a gag-pol polyprotein that is missing both p15 and significant portions of reverse transcriptase. In pulse-chase experiments, P120 does not appear to be specifically cleaved to generate virion structural proteins. Furthermore, we have been unable to detect P120 in RAV-0 producing line 7 and line 15 CEF. Instead, only Pr76gag (the direct precusor to virion core proteins in productively infected cells) is observed in these cells. Thus P120 is unlikely to act as a functional intermediate in virus maturation. We have also observed that infection of gs+ CEF with exogenous avian sarcoma and leukemia viruses results in a significant but variable decrease in the level of P120."
https://openalex.org/W2101933819,"α2u Globulin is a male rat liver protein under complex hormonal control which represents approximately 1% of hepatic protein synthesis in an adult male rat. Hypophysectomy completely abolishes the hepatic synthesis of this protein, and the reinduction of its synthesis can be effected by the simultaneous administration of glucocorticoid, androgen, thyroid hormone and pituitary growth hormone. Growth hormone is absolutely required for the synthesis of a normal level of α2u globulin. It was found, however, that hepatic α2u globulin mRNA can be raised to a normal level in hypophysectomized animals by administration of steroids and thyroid hormone alone; nevertheless, no detectable synthesis of the protein occurs in these animals. Administration of growth hormone to the hypophysectomized animals that had been pretreated with steroids and thyroid hormone results in the immediate synthesis of α2u globulin protein with very little change in the level of α2u globulin mRNA. In an intact male animal, α2u globulin mRNA sequences are found to be preferentially associated with bound polysomes. By contrast, the untranslated α2u globulin mRNA sequences that accumulate in the livers of hypophysectomized rats treated with steroids and thyroid hormone are found on free polysomes and in the supernatant (nonpolysomal) fractions. Administration of growth hormone to these animals effects a shift of α2u globulin mRNA sequences to bound polysomes, concurrent with the induction of detectable synthesis of the protein. This effect of growth hormone in vivo can be mimicked by administration of high doses of insulin, indicating that this effect may be somatomedin-mediated. It thus appears that growth hormone induces hepatic α2u globulin synthesis by way of a translational control mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2048896370,"The proposal that the stable expression of organogenesis-directing plasma membrane antigens, such as testis-organizing H-Y antigen, requires β2-microglobulin-MHC antigen dimers as anchorage sites was tested on Daudi human Burkitt lymphoma cells [46, XY, 15q−, 14q+, β2-m(−), HLA(−)]. The H-Y antigen level of Daudi was only 20% of that of Raji and Ramos, two human male pseudodiploid Burkitt lymphoma lines that were β2-m(+), HLA(+). When Daudi is hybridized with β2-m(+), HLA(+) cell lines, β2-microglobulin, supplied by the latter, is known to restore the expression of Daudi HLA antigens A10 and BW17. Such restoration of HLA antigen expression markedly elevated H-Y antigen levels in those somatic hybrids. Thus the H-Y antigen level of the Daudi × Raji 8A (♂ × ♂) hybrid became equal to that of TetraRaji—the colcemide-induced Raji tetraploid line. Two independently derived Daudi × HeLa D98 (♂ × ♀) hybrids, DAD 1 and DAD 10, demonstrated even higher H-Y antigen levels comparable to that of normal male peripheral blood lymphocytes."

https://openalex.org/W2114749680,"Human VA-2 cells infected with baboon type C virus were cloned and fused to Syrian hamster cells, and 33 primary hybrid colonies were obtained. These cells segregated human chromosomes and retained the complete hamster genome. Assays for type C viral p30 antigen and reverse transcriptase were performed in conjunction with analyses of 30 gene-enzyme systems representing 22 different human chromosomes. The results comfirmed that a gene, Bevi, previously assigned to human chromosome 6, dominantly controls baboon type C virus expression in hybrid cells. Representative hybrid colones were studied by nucleic acid hybridization techniques for the presence of integrated proviral DNA using complementary 3H-DNA transcripts of the baboon viral RNA genome. For each of 12 clones examined, there was a concordance between the presence of human chromosome 6, the presence of baboon type C proviral DNA sequences and virus expression. Clones which segregated chromosome 6 as judged by isozyme and karyological analyses lost detectable proviral DNA sequences and failed to produce virus. No syntenic association between the replication of baboon virus and the presence of 21 other human chromosomes was deteced. We conclude that Bevi is a preferred integration site for the baboon type C provirus in the human genome."

https://openalex.org/W1489952277,"Myelin basic protein was isolated from both cat and bovine central nervous system. Cat and bovine myelin basic protein, which are shown to be similar by tryptic mapping, exhibit identical behavior when cross-linked with the bifunctional reagent difluorodinitrobenzene. Myelin basic protein is cross-linked into only a dimer under certain conditions in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. In contrast, many oligomers are formed when myelin basic protein is cross-linked in the absence of detergent. The formation of cross-linked dimers in the absence of other oligomer formation suggests that the protein is at least partly dimeric in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The conformation of them myelin basic protein monomer in sodium dodecyl sulfate was also studied. N-Bromosuccinimide and cyanogen bromide cleavage reactions were used to demonstrate that difluorodinitrobenzene had introduced intramolecular cross-links between the two peptides resulting from each of the cleavage ractions. However, these types of intramolecular cross-links cannot be detected under conditions in which only dimers have formed. Some of the lysine residues which are modified by difluorodinitrobenzene were identified by tryptic mapping. In several respects, the conformation of myelin basic protein in a sodium dodecyl sulfate solution appears to be similar to the conformation of the protein in the membrane."

Thus, an apparent COOH-terminal to NH2-terminal pathway of refolding within each domain was observed, which is consistent with the proposed evolutionary pathway of the albumin molecule and also consistent with the proposed presence of a nucleation center in the COOH-terminal double disulfide loop of each domain."

Microcomplement fixation also clearly demonstrated conformational differences between porcine phospholipase A2 and its zymogen. NH2 terminally modified analogs of porcine phospholipase A2 could be clearly distinguished using the same assay. Moreover, strong evidence was obtained that Ala1-Arg6 is a part of an antigenic determinant. Radioimmune assay, using monovalent phospholipase-specific Fab fragments revealed a maximum number of three antigenic sites of phospholipase that can simultaneously be occupied by antibody.

https://openalex.org/W1536735543,"The mechanism of cholinergic stimulation of alanine and glutamine formation and release from skeletal muscle was studied using rat epitrochlaris preparations. The increased alanine and glutamine release produced by carbamylcholine (10(-6) M) was reproduced by tetramethylammonium (10(-6) M) but not by pilocarpine (10(-6) M) and was blocked by hexamethonium (10(-4) M) but not by atropine (10(-7) M). This increased alanine and glutamine release was not associated with altered muscle cAMP levels. However, carbamylcholine (10(-6) M) and tetramethylammonium (10(-6) M) did not increase levels of cGMP, 134% and 101%, respectively, and these increments in cGMP were blocked by hexamethonium but not by atropine. Carbamylcholine produced a concentration-dependent increase in cGMP levels. Methylisobutylxanthine and theophylline augmented the increased amino acid release and increased cGMP levels produced by carbamylcholine. Neither xanthine derivative alone altered alanine and glutamine release or cyclic nucleotide levels. Added cGMP increased amino acid release and the uptake of [U-14C]alanine and alpha-amino[14C]isobutyric acid. Carbamylcholine did not alter muscle phosphorylase a activity, glycogen levels, or basal adenylate cyclase activity. These data indicate that cholinergic stimulation of muscle alanine and glutamine formation and release involves a nicotinic cholinergic receptor and may be mediated by increased levels of cGMP, which in turn may result from a cholinergic stimulation of muscle guanylyl cyclase."

The molar ratio of p30:reverse transcriptase within the complex is 8:1. Both complexes can be dissociated into their original protein components by exposure to salt (kcl) solution, except that 0.3 M KCl will dissociate the interspecies complex whereas 0.8 M KCl is required for dissociation of the intraspecies complex. Competition studies in which an interspecies complex was exposed to p30 autologous to reverse transcriptase within the complex resulted in the displacement of the heterologous (p30) protein and the formation of a new intraspecific complex."
