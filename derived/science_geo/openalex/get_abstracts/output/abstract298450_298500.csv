https://openalex.org/W2055061560,"The analysis of selenium species in reducing waters provides important insight into the element's biogeochemical cycle. The absence of selenate and selenite in reducing waters suggests that some removal mechanism could be operative, but the presence in these waters of about 1 nanomole per liter of dissolved organic selenide indicates that the regeneration of selenium in the form of organic species may be the dominant process. The data demonstrate that the regenerative and biogeochemical cycles of selenium are quite complex."
https://openalex.org/W2057231300,"A diverse and well-preserved ichnofossil suite has been identified from surface exposures of the middle and upper parts of the Lower Cretaceous McMurray Formation. The suite, consisting of representatives of at least ten ichnogenera, is one of the few clues to the original biotic component of the deposit. The distribution and abundance of these biogenic structures present strong evidence that the deep channel complex in which the sediments were deposited was closely associated with a nearby marine shoreline."
https://openalex.org/W1998183413,"The Ediacarian, here defined as the initial period and system of the Phanerozoic Eon, is characterized by the oldest known multicellular animal life. The distinctive biotal assemblage comprises naked Metazoa, represented in the type region by 26 species in 18 genera and 4 or more phyla, plus simple metazoan surface tracks. Elements of this unique biota appeared worldwide at low paleolatitudes, following terminal Proterozoic glaciation. Ediacarian history lasted from about 670 million to 550 million years ago. This interval, plus Early Cambrian, was the time during which metazoan life diversified into nearly all of the major phyla and most of the invertebrate classes and orders subsequently known."
https://openalex.org/W1989475370,Clastic sediment deposits found within the caves of Mammoth Cave National Park have yielded a magnetostratigraphic pattern of magnetic polarity reversals which indicates-that they were deposited over a range of at least 1 million and most likely 2 million years.

https://openalex.org/W2082164706,"Organic chemists have used the chemical properties of tetracovalent silicon in a remarkable variety of new synthetic transformations. In carbon-functional silanes, exceptional stabilization is provided to a carbocation center in the beta position when the carbon-silicon bond lies in plane. This phenomenon directs electrophilic attack to the silicon-substituted carbon in aryl-, vinyl-, and alkynylsilanes and to carbon-3 in allylsilanes. For different reasons, silicon also stabilizes a carbon-metal bond in the alpha position. Consequently, access to many silicon-containing organometallics is readily available. The exceptional strength of silicon-oxygen and silicon-fluorine bonds is yet another factor that controls the chemical reactivity of silicon reagents. In recent developments, preparative chemists have taken advantage of these properties in imaginative and useful ways."

Hence, the plant tissues in the coal ball were chemically altered by coalification processes and were not preserved as peat."
