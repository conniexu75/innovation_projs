https://openalex.org/W2161577298,"Elevated expression of the c-Myc transcription factor occurs frequently in human cancers and is associated with tumor aggression and poor clinical outcome. The effect of high levels of c-Myc on global gene regulation is poorly understood but is widely thought to involve newly activated or repressed ""Myc target genes."" We report here that in tumor cells expressing high levels of c-Myc the transcription factor accumulates in the promoter regions of active genes and causes transcriptional amplification, producing increased levels of transcripts within the cell's gene expression program. Thus, rather than binding and regulating a new set of genes, c-Myc amplifies the output of the existing gene expression program. These results provide an explanation for the diverse effects of oncogenic c-Myc on gene expression in different tumor cells and suggest that transcriptional amplification reduces rate-limiting constraints for tumor cell growth and proliferation."

In order to develop transient electronics for use as medical implants, Hwang et al. (p. 1640 , see the cover) produced a complete set of tools and materials that would be needed to make standard devices. Devices were designed to have a specific lifetime, after which the component materials, such as porous silicon and silk, would be resorbed by the body."
https://openalex.org/W2167869412,"The c-Myc HLH-bZIP protein has been implicated in physiological or pathological growth, proliferation, apoptosis, metabolism, and differentiation at the cellular, tissue, or organismal levels via regulation of numerous target genes. No principle yet unifies Myc action due partly to an incomplete inventory and functional accounting of Myc's targets. To observe Myc target expression and function in a system where Myc is temporally and physiologically regulated, the transcriptomes and the genome-wide distributions of Myc, RNA polymerase II, and chromatin modifications were compared during lymphocyte activation and in ES cells as well. A remarkably simple rule emerged from this quantitative analysis: Myc is not an on-off specifier of gene activity, but is a nonlinear amplifier of expression, acting universally at active genes, except for immediate early genes that are strongly induced before Myc. This rule of Myc action explains the vast majority of Myc biology observed in literature."

Costello et al. (p. 517 published online 27 September; see the Perspective by Pikitch ) used a model that integrates harvest, population, and ecological data to estimate the status of unassessed fisheries, based on ecologically analogous, regularly assessed fisheries. Generally, unassessed fisheries are in worse condition with declining fish stocks compared with regularly assessed fisheries."
https://openalex.org/W1971072534,"Bacterial PERegrinations Many branches of the bacterial domain of life are only known from sequences that turn up in metagenomic analyses and are still only named by acronym—for example, the phylum-level groups BD1-5, OP11, OD1, and the PERs. The parent organisms are probably widespread, but they have not been cultured, and very little is known about their metabolisms or their contributions and functions in the natural environment. Wrighton et al. (p. 1661 ) pumped acetate into an aquifer in Colorado to prompt the naturally occurring bacteria into action and then, from the runoff, filtered out the smaller microbial cells for further analysis. Mass-spectrometry–based proteomics was used to test for functional activity, and 49 distinct genomes were recovered, many with surprising functional attributes. All of the recovered organisms appeared to be strict anaerobes with a full glycolytic pathway that were capable of augmenting energy production by coupling proton-pumping activity to adenosine triphosphate synthase. Several hydrogenases were found that seemed to be able to switch between hydrogen production and polysulfide reduction, depending on the substrate available. Notably, carbon dioxide assimilation was a common feature, with many genes having similarity to those of archaea."
https://openalex.org/W2068227428,"African spiny mice (Acomys) are shown to be capable of regenerating hair follicles, adipose tissue and cartilage, and they can heal deep lesions of skin, with little scarring, suggesting that these mice could prove useful as a model system for studying tissue regeneration in mammals. Many animals can regenerate tissues, organs and even whole limbs after injury. In mammals, this capability is believed to be at best extremely limited, but these authors report that the African spiny mice (Acomys) are potentially important exceptions. Live-trapped A. kempi and A. percivali from Kenya are shown to share with certain lizards the ability to shed and then rapidly regenerate areas of skin. This skin autotomy is an effective defence against predators, who may gain a mouthful of easily-torn skin but miss out on the main prize as the spiny mouse scuttles away. Quite large, deep lesions can be regenerated, complete with hair follicles and cartilage in damaged ears, and with no scarring. The authors propose that these mice produce a pro-regenerative environment similar to that seen in limb-regenerating salamanders. This study suggests that mammals may retain a higher capacity for regeneration than previously recognized, and introduces spiny mice as a novel model organism for study of this subject. Evolutionary modification has produced a spectrum of animal defence traits to escape predation, including the ability to autotomize body parts to elude capture1,2. After autotomy, the missing part is either replaced through regeneration (for example, in urodeles, lizards, arthropods and crustaceans) or permanently lost (such as in mammals). Although most autotomy involves the loss of appendages (legs, chelipeds, antennae or tails, for example), skin autotomy can occur in certain taxa of scincid and gekkonid lizards3. Here we report the first demonstration of skin autotomy in Mammalia (African spiny mice, Acomys). Mechanical testing showed a propensity for skin to tear under very low tension and the absence of a fracture plane. After skin loss, rapid wound contraction was followed by hair follicle regeneration in dorsal skin wounds. Notably, we found that regenerative capacity in Acomys was extended to ear holes, where the mice exhibited complete regeneration of hair follicles, sebaceous glands, dermis and cartilage. Salamanders capable of limb regeneration form a blastema (a mass of lineage-restricted progenitor cells4) after limb loss, and our findings suggest that ear tissue regeneration in Acomys may proceed through the assembly of a similar structure. This study underscores the importance of investigating regenerative phenomena outside of conventional model organisms, and suggests that mammals may retain a higher capacity for regeneration than was previously believed. As re-emergent interest in regenerative medicine seeks to isolate molecular pathways controlling tissue regeneration in mammals, Acomys may prove useful in identifying mechanisms to promote regeneration in lieu of fibrosis and scarring."

While the measured width profiles of such jets on large scales agree with theories of magnetic collimation, predicted structure on accretion disk scales at the jet launch point has not been detected. We report radio interferometry observations at 1.3mm wavelength of the elliptical galaxy M87 that spatially resolve the base of the jet in this source. The derived size of 5.5 +/- 0.4 Schwarzschild radii is significantly smaller than the innermost edge of a retrograde accretion disk, suggesting that the M87 jet is powered by an accretion disk in a prograde orbit around a spinning black hole."

Currently, the most versatile synthetic route to this motif involves cross-coupling of one ring with a halide substituent to another ring with a boron or metal-based substituent. Recent research has focused on eliminating the need for one or both of these activating substituents, but for the most part, the emerging methods have required high temperatures and high concentrations of one coupling partner. Ball et al. (p. 1644 ) now present a gold catalyst that can couple silyl-activated arenes to unactivated arenes in comparable concentrations at room temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2085234652,"Cancer cells accommodate multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations that initially activate intrinsic (cell-autonomous) and extrinsic (immune-mediated) oncosuppressive mechanisms. Only once these barriers to oncogenesis have been overcome can malignant growth proceed unrestrained. Tetraploidization can contribute to oncogenesis because hyperploid cells are genomically unstable. We report that hyperploid cancer cells become immunogenic because of a constitutive endoplasmic reticulum stress response resulting in the aberrant cell surface exposure of calreticulin. Hyperploid, calreticulin-exposing cancer cells readily proliferated in immunodeficient mice and conserved their increased DNA content. In contrast, hyperploid cells injected into immunocompetent mice generated tumors only after a delay, and such tumors exhibited reduced DNA content, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and calreticulin exposure. Our results unveil an immunosurveillance system that imposes immunoselection against hyperploidy in carcinogen- and oncogene-induced cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2014424306,"Astrocytes release glutamate upon activation of various GPCRs to exert important roles in synaptic functions. However, the molecular mechanism of release has been controversial. Here, we report two kinetically distinct modes of nonvesicular, channel-mediated glutamate release. The fast mode requires activation of G(αi), dissociation of G(βγ), and subsequent opening of glutamate-permeable, two-pore domain potassium channel TREK-1 through direct interaction between G(βγ) and N terminus of TREK-1. The slow mode is Ca(2+) dependent and requires G(αq) activation and opening of glutamate-permeable, Ca(2+)-activated anion channel Best1. Ultrastructural analyses demonstrate that TREK-1 is preferentially localized at cell body and processes, whereas Best1 is mostly found in microdomains of astrocytes near synapses. Diffusion modeling predicts that the fast mode can target neuronal mGluR with peak glutamate concentration of 100 μM, whereas slow mode targets neuronal NMDA receptors at around 1 μM. Our results reveal two distinct sources of astrocytic glutamate that can differentially influence neighboring neurons."

However, many insects have managed to escape the deleterious effects of these chemicals and even, in some cases, use them in their own defense. Zhen et al. (p. 1634 ) investigated a broad range of taxa and found several examples of parallel changes, as well as duplications, in members of the ATPα family that likely explain the shift to allow insects to avoid the toxic effects of these plants. Thus, natural selection can harness a combination of gene duplication, protein evolution, and regulatory evolution to allow distantly related species to adapt to specific niches."
https://openalex.org/W2010267925,A Radical Mechanism The bacterial enzyme nitrogenase plays a key role in the global nitrogen cycle by catalyzing the reduction of N 2 to ammonia. At the heart of the enzyme is a metal-sulfur cluster that contains an interstitial light atom recently identified as a carbide. The identification raised questions concerning the role of the carbide in the enzyme mechanism and how it is inserted into the metal cluster. Wiig et al. (p. 1672 ; see the Perspective by Boal and Rosenzweig ) now show that the carbide derives from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and is inserted into the core by the radical SAM enzyme NifB.
https://openalex.org/W2053323016,"PolII Goes Loopy To execute their function, genes must be transcribed into RNA, often by RNA polymerase II (PolII), which binds at the 5′ end of genes and therefore transcribes through the coding region to make messenger RNA. But, presented with nucleosome-depleted chromatin, PolII will, wastefully, initiate transcription nonspecifically and bidirectionally away from the gene. Noting that actively transcribed genes often form loops, such that their 5′ and 3′ ends are juxtaposed. Tan-Wong et al. (p. 671 , published online 27 September; see the Perspective by Hampsey ) showed that PolII's propensity for promiscuous bidirectional transcription is reined in by gene loop formation."

Recent work has implicated the receptor TANGO1 in procollagen export. Now, Venditti et al.

https://openalex.org/W2057015756,"The water cycle in the western United States changed dramatically over glacial cycles. In the past 20,000 years, higher precipitation caused desert lakes to form which have since dried out. Higher glacial precipitation has been hypothesized to result from a southward shift of Pacific winter storm tracks. We compared Pacific Ocean data to lake levels from the interior west and found that Great Basin lake high stands are older than coastal wet periods at the same latitude. Westerly storms were not the source of high precipitation. Instead, air masses from the tropical Pacific were transported northward, bringing more precipitation into the Great Basin when coastal California was still dry. The changing climate during the deglaciation altered precipitation source regions and strongly affected the regional water cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2018439302,"Wound Healing and Immunity Although wound healing and infection are often overlapping processes, whether the wound healing response modulates the immune response is not well understood. Doronin et al. (p. 795 , published online 27 September; see the Perspective by Herzog and Ostrov ) now show that coagulation factor X, an important component of the blood clotting cascade, helps to trigger antiviral immunity in response to adenovirus infection in mice. Factor X binds to human type C adenovirus with very high affinity. Structural analysis identified the critical binding residues between factor X and adenovirus, which, when mutated, inhibited binding. Despite being able to infect splenic macrophages in mice, transcriptional profiling of spleens from mice infected with a mutant adenovirus unable to bind to factor X revealed impaired activation of signaling cascades associated with innate immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2080096618,"Current models for the intracellular transport of Tau protein suggest motor protein-dependent co-transport with microtubule fragments and diffusion of Tau in the cytoplasm, whereas Tau is believed to be stationary while bound to microtubules and in equilibrium with free diffusion in the cytosol. Observations that members of the microtubule-dependent kinesin family show Brownian motion along microtubules led us to hypothesize that diffusion along microtubules could also be relevant in the case of Tau. We used single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to probe for diffusion of individual fluorescently labeled Tau molecules along microtubules. This allowed us to avoid the problem that microtubule-dependent diffusion could be masked by excess of labeled Tau in solution that might occur in in vivo overexpression experiments. We found that approximately half of the individually detected Tau molecules moved bidirectionally along microtubules over distances up to several micrometers. Diffusion parameters such as diffusion coefficient, interaction time, and scanned microtubule length did not change with Tau concentration. Tau binding and diffusion along the microtubule lattice, however, were sensitive to ionic strength and pH and drastically reduced upon enzymatic removal of the negatively charged C termini of tubulin. We propose one-dimensional Tau diffusion guided by the microtubule lattice as one possible additional mechanism for Tau distribution. By such one-dimensional microtubule lattice diffusion, Tau could be guided to both microtubule ends, i.e. the sites where Tau is needed during microtubule polymerization, independently of directed motor-dependent transport. This could be important in conditions where active transport along microtubules might be compromised."
https://openalex.org/W2065045012,"Aldehyde oxidases have pharmacological relevance, and AOX3 is the major drug-metabolizing enzyme in rodents.The crystal structure of mouse AOX3 with kinetics and molecular docking studies provides insights into its enzymatic characteristics.Differences in substrate and inhibitor specificities can be rationalized by comparing the AOX3 and xanthine oxidase structures.The first aldehyde oxidase structure represents a major advance for drug design and mechanistic studies. Aldehyde oxidases (AOXs) are homodimeric proteins belonging to the xanthine oxidase family of molybdenum-containing enzymes. Each 150-kDa monomer contains a FAD redox cofactor, two spectroscopically distinct [2Fe-2S] clusters, and a molybdenum cofactor located within the protein active site. AOXs are characterized by broad range substrate specificity, oxidizing different aldehydes and aromatic N-heterocycles. Despite increasing recognition of its role in the metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics, the physiological function of the protein is still largely unknown. We have crystallized and solved the crystal structure of mouse liver aldehyde oxidase 3 to 2.9 Å. This is the first mammalian AOX whose structure has been solved. The structure provides important insights into the protein active center and further evidence on the catalytic differences characterizing AOX and xanthine oxidoreductase. The mouse liver aldehyde oxidase 3 three-dimensional structure combined with kinetic, mutagenesis data, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics studies make a decisive contribution to understand the molecular basis of its rather broad substrate specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2118567456,"We examine how different transcriptional network structures can evolve from an ancestral network. By characterizing how the ancestral mode of gene regulation for genes specific to a-type cells in yeast species evolved from an activating paradigm to a repressing one, we show that regulatory protein modularity, conversion of one cis-regulatory sequence to another, distribution of binding energy among protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, and exploitation of ancestral network features all contribute to the evolution of a novel regulatory mode. The formation of this derived mode of regulation did not disrupt the ancestral mode and thereby created a hybrid regulatory state where both means of transcription regulation (ancestral and derived) contribute to the conserved expression pattern of the network. Finally, we show how this hybrid regulatory state has resolved in different ways in different lineages to generate the diversity of regulatory network structures observed in modern species."

Thus, relatively few genetic changes can play a large role in determining a species' ecological niche."
https://openalex.org/W2054186726,"The innate immune system serves as the first line of defense by detecting microbes and initiating inflammatory responses. Although both Toll-like receptor (TLR) and nucleotide binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins are important for this process, their excessive activation is hazardous to hosts; thus, tight regulation is required. Endotoxin tolerance is refractory to repeated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation and serves as a host defense mechanism against septic shock caused by an excessive TLR4 response during gram-negative bacterial infection. Gram-positive bacteria as well as their cell wall components also induce shock. However, the mechanism underlying tolerance is not understood. Here, we show that activation of Nod2 by its ligand, muramyl dipeptide (MDP) in the bacterial cell wall, induces rapid degradation of Nod2, which confers MDP tolerance in vitro and in vivo. Nod2 is constitutively associated with a chaperone protein, Hsp90, which is required for Nod2 stability and protects Nod2 from degradation. Upon MDP stimulation, Hsp90 rapidly dissociates from Nod2, which subsequently undergoes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. The SOCS-3 protein induced by Nod2 activation further facilitates this degradation process. Therefore, Nod2 protein stability is a key factor in determining responsiveness to MDP stimulation. This indicates that TLRs and NLRs induce a tolerant state through distinct molecular mechanisms that protect the host from septic shock."

In the case of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), HS binding determines their transport between cells and is required for the assembly of high affinity signaling complexes with their cognate FGF receptor. However, the specificity of the interaction of FGFs with HS is still debated. Here, we use a panel of FGFs (FGF-1, FGF-2, FGF-7, FGF-9, FGF-18, and FGF-21) spanning five FGF subfamilies to probe their specificities for HS at different levels as follows: binding parameters, identification of heparin-binding sites (HBSs) in the FGFs, changes in their secondary structure caused by heparin binding and structures in the sugar required for binding. For interaction with heparin, the FGFs exhibit KD values varying between 38 nm (FGF-18) and 620 nm (FGF-9) and association rate constants spanning over 20-fold (FGF-1, 2,900,000 m−1 s−1 and FGF-9, 130,000 m−1 s−1).

https://openalex.org/W1980301454,"In this study, we investigated which enzymes are involved in debranching amylopectin during transient starch degradation. Previous studies identified two debranching enzymes, isoamylase 3 (ISA3) and limit dextrinase (LDA), involved in this process. However, plants lacking both enzymes still degrade substantial amounts of starch. Thus, other enzymes/mechanisms must contribute to starch breakdown. We show that the chloroplastic α-amylase 3 (AMY3) also participates in starch degradation and provide evidence that all three enzymes can act directly at the starch granule surface. The isa3 mutant has a starch excess phenotype, reflecting impaired starch breakdown. In contrast, removal of AMY3, LDA, or both enzymes together has no impact on starch degradation. However, removal of AMY3 or LDA in addition to ISA3 enhances the starch excess phenotype. In plants lacking all three enzymes, starch breakdown is effectively blocked, and starch accumulates to the highest levels observed so far. This provides indirect evidence that the heteromultimeric debranching enzyme ISA1-ISA2 is not involved in starch breakdown. However, we illustrate that ISA1-ISA2 can hydrolyze small soluble branched glucans that accumulate when ISA3 and LDA are missing, albeit at a slow rate. Starch accumulation in the mutants correlates inversely with plant growth."
https://openalex.org/W2053610552,"Natural sensory input shapes both structure and function of developing neurons, but how early experience-driven morphological and physiological plasticity are interrelated remains unclear. Using rapid time-lapse two-photon calcium imaging of network activity and single-neuron growth within the unanesthetized developing brain, we demonstrate that visual stimulation induces coordinated changes to neuronal responses and dendritogenesis. Further, we identify the transcription factor MEF2A/2D as a major regulator of neuronal response to plasticity-inducing stimuli directing both structural and functional changes. Unpatterned sensory stimuli that change plasticity thresholds induce rapid degradation of MEF2A/2D through a classical apoptotic pathway requiring NMDA receptors and caspases-9 and -3/7. Knockdown of MEF2A/2D alone is sufficient to induce a metaplastic shift in threshold of both functional and morphological plasticity.

Using recombinant human βig-h3 and MMP-9, βig-h3 from βig-h3-transfected HEK293F cells, and MMP-9 from MMP-9-transfected HEK293F cells, human macrophages, and neutrophils, we found that MMP-9 proteolytically cleaves βig-h3. Cleavage leads to the loss of its adhesive property and its release from extracellular matrix proteins, collagen IV, and fibronectin. Spheroids formed by increased cell-cell interactions were observed in βig-h3-transfected HEK293F cells but not in vehicle-transfected HEK293F cells. In human glioma U87MG cells, MMP-9 constitutive overexpression resulted in endogenous βig-h3 cleavage. βig-h3 cleavage by MMP-9 led to increased cell invasion, and βig-h3 knockdown also resulted in increased cell invasion. The βig-h3 fragment cleaved by MMP-9 could bind to the surface of macrophages, and it may play a role as a peptide chemoattractant by inducing macrophage migration via focal adhesion kinase/Src-mediated signal activation. Thus, intact βig-h3 is responsible for cell migration inhibition, cell-cell contact, and cell-extracellular matrix interaction. Experimental evidence indicates that MMP-9-cleaved βig-h3 plays a role in MMP-9-mediated tumor cell and macrophage migration."
https://openalex.org/W1981817247,"The C-type lectin DC-SIGN expressed on dendritic cells (DCs) facilitates capture and internalization of a plethora of different pathogens. Although it is known that DC-SIGN organizes in nanoclusters at the surface of DCs, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this well defined nanopatterning and role in viral binding remain enigmatic. By combining biochemical and advanced biophysical techniques, including optical superresolution and single particle tracking, we demonstrate that DC-SIGN intrinsic nanoclustering strictly depends on its molecular structure. DC-SIGN nanoclusters exhibited free, Brownian diffusion on the cell membrane. Truncation of the extracellular neck region, known to abrogate tetramerization, significantly reduced nanoclustering and concomitantly increased lateral diffusion. Importantly, DC-SIGN nanocluster dissolution exclusively compromised binding to nanoscale size pathogens. Monte Carlo simulations revealed that heterogeneity on nanocluster density and spatial distribution confers broader binding capabilities to DC-SIGN. As such, our results underscore a direct relationship between spatial nanopatterning, driven by intermolecular interactions between the neck regions, and receptor diffusion to provide DC-SIGN with the exquisite ability to dock pathogens at the virus length scale. Insight into how virus receptors are organized prior to virus binding and how they assemble into functional platforms for virus docking is helpful to develop novel strategies to prevent virus entry and infection.

Dendritic cells (DCs) 4The abbreviations used are: DCdendritic cellimDCimmature DCCRDcarbohydrate recognition domainTEMtransmission electron microscopyMFmean fluorescenceAbantibodyNSOMnear-field scanning optical microscopySTEDstimulated emission depletionccdfcomplementary cumulative distribution function. constitute a specific group of professional antigen-presenting leukocytes that link the innate and adaptive branches of the immune response by virtue of their capacity to recognize pathogen-specific structures (1Banchereau J. Steinman R.M. Dendritic cells and the control of immunity.Nature. 1998; 392: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (12241) Google Scholar). Immature DCs (imDCs) migrate from the blood into tissues, where they detect foreign antigens. Upon antigen recognition, imDCs are activated and migrate to the lymph nodes, where they present antigen-derived peptides to naive T lymphocytes and induce an effective immune response (2Steinman R.M.

Cell biology of antigen processing in vitro in vivo.Annu Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 975-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). For efficient pathogen recognition, imDCs are equipped with a large number of lectin and lectin-like receptors on the cellular membrane that bind to high mannose structures present on the surfaces of a broad range of pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, yeast, and parasites (5Cambi A.

Because DCs can be manipulated ex vivo, numerous efforts have been undertaken for exploiting the extraordinary binding capabilities of lectin-like receptors to target antigens directly to DCs in vivo, potentially increasing the effectiveness of antitumor and antiviral vaccines (7Tacken P.J. de Vries I.J.

Med. 2003; 197: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar) via mannan- and Lewis X oligosaccharide-dependent interactions. More recently, it has been shown that upon recognition of mannan or Lewis X carbohydrates, DC-SIGN associates with distinct signaling molecules to induce differential production of cytokines that in turn lead to enhancement or suppression of proinflammatory responses (18Gringhuis S.I. den Dunnen J. Litjens M. van der Vlist M. Geijtenbeek T.B. Carbohydrate-specific signaling through the DC-SIGN signalosome tailors immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, HIV-1 and Helicobacter pylori.Nat.

The mechanisms by which these diverging signaling pathways are generated remain a mystery, although it has been suggested that the molecular structure of DC-SIGN might be altered upon binding to the two different carbohydrates. Structurally, DC-SIGN is a tetrameric transmembrane protein, with each subunit comprising a long extracellular part with a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), a 7.5 tandem repeat of 23 amino acids forming the neck region, and a transmembrane part followed by a cytoplasmic tail containing recycling and internalization motifs (19Feinberg H.

Based on these results, it has been proposed that the neck configuration is likely to play a significant role in pathogen capture (23Menon S. Rosenberg K. Graham S.A. Ward E.M. Taylor M.E.

Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and near-field optical nanoscopy, we previously showed that DC-SIGN forms nanoclusters on the membrane of fixed imDCs far beyond mere tetramerization (11Cambi A. de Lange F. van Maarseveen N.M.

J. 2011; 100: 2662-2670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Importantly, tight spatial ordering of DC-SIGN in nanoclusters resulted crucial for binding and internalization of HIV-1 (11Cambi A. de Lange F. van Maarseveen N.M. Nijhuis M. Joosten B. van Dijk E.M. de Bakker B.I. Fransen J.A. Bovee-Geurts P.H. van Leeuwen F.N. Van Hulst N.F. Figdor C.G. Microdomains of the C-type lectin DC-SIGN are portals for virus entry into dendritic cells.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, how DC-SIGN achieves such a refined level of spatial control is largely unknown. Although DC-SIGN has been shown to partially associate with lipid rafts, cholesterol extraction did not alter the integrity of the nanoclusters (11Cambi A. de Lange F. van Maarseveen N.M. Nijhuis M. Joosten B. van Dijk E.M. de Bakker B.I. Fransen J.A. Bovee-Geurts P.H. van Leeuwen F.N. Van Hulst N.F. Figdor C.G. Microdomains of the C-type lectin DC-SIGN are portals for virus entry into dendritic cells.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Similarly, DC-SIGN nanocluster formation and/or stability do not require interactions with the cortical cytoskeleton (27Itano M.S. Neumann A.K. Liu P. Zhang F. Gratton E. Parak W.J. Thompson N.L. Jacobson K. DC-SIGN and influenza hemagglutinin dynamics in plasma membrane microdomains are markedly different.Biophys. J. 2011; 100: 2662-2670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or association with tetraspanins (27Itano M.S. Neumann A.K. Liu P. Zhang F. Gratton E. Parak W.J. Thompson N.L. Jacobson K. DC-SIGN and influenza hemagglutinin dynamics in plasma membrane microdomains are markedly different.Biophys. J. 2011; 100: 2662-2670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been hypothesized that large DC-SIGN domains (i.e. microclusters) could be formed and stabilized through interactions between the CRDs and yet unidentified extracellular components because deletion of the CRD moiety abrogated DC-SIGN microclustering (28Liu P. Wang X. Itano M.S. Neumann A.K. Jacobson K. Thompson N.L. The formation and stability of DC-SIGN microdomains require its extracellular moiety.Traffic. 2012; 13: 715-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, because these experiments were performed using diffraction-limited confocal microscopy, it is not clear whether the nanoclustering capacity of DC-SIGN also requires the presence of the CRD. Thus, despite the importance of DC-SIGN nanoclustering in pathogen recognition, the studies performed so far have not yet provided conclusive evidence to explain the origin for this well defined organization. Here we combined biochemical assays, superresolution optical nanoscopy, single particle tracking, and Monte Carlo simulations of different DC-SIGN mutants to elucidate the mechanisms leading to DC-SIGN nanoclustering and to correlate their role with viral binding capacity. Our results reveal that homophilic interactions mediated by the neck region of DC-SIGN are responsible for its nanoclustering and enhanced virus-binding ability. CHO cell lines stably expressing DC-SIGN-wt, -ΔCRD, -Δ35, and -ΔRep were established by LipofectamineTM 2000 transfection. Human imDCs were generated from buffy coats of healthy donors as reported previously (29Geijtenbeek T.B. Torensma R. van Vliet S.J. van Duijnhoven G.C. Adema G.J. van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Identification of DC-SIGN, a novel dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 receptor that supports primary immune responses.Cell. 2000; 100: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1450) Google Scholar). Plasmids used in this study were pcDNA-3 carrying the DC-SIGN-wt or deletion mutants. These constructs have a short C-terminal AU-1 tag and were constructed as already published (30Pohlmann S. Leslie G.J. Edwards T.G. Macfarlan T. Reeves J.D. Hiebenthal-Millow K. Kirchhoff F. Baribaud F. Doms R.W. DC-SIGN interactions with human immunodeficiency virus. Virus binding and transfer are dissociable functions.J. Virol. 2001; 75: 10523-10526Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Binding of CHO cells to soluble Alexa647-mannan was performed as follows. 50,000 cells were incubated with 50 μg/ml Alexa647-mannan in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1% BSA (TSA buffer) for 30 min on ice in the presence or absence of 20 μg/ml anti-DC-SIGN blocking mAb (AZN-D1) or 100 μg/ml unlabeled mannan. After thorough washing in PBS, the percentage of cells that had bound mannan was detected by flow cytometry using the FACSCaliburTM flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The values represent the mean ± S.D. of duplicates of one representative experiment of three. Binding to gp120-coated beads was performed as already reported (11Cambi A. de Lange F. van Maarseveen N.M. Nijhuis M. Joosten B. van Dijk E.M. de Bakker B.I. Fransen J.A. Bovee-Geurts P.H. van Leeuwen F.N. Van Hulst N.F. Figdor C.G. Microdomains of the C-type lectin DC-SIGN are portals for virus entry into dendritic cells.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Briefly, streptavidin-modified TransFluorSpheres (505/515 nm, 40-nm diameter; Molecular Probes) were coated with recombinant biotinylated gp120 (HIV-1 III B; ImmunoDiagnostics, Inc., Woburn, MA) and were added to 50,000 cells in a ratio of 20 beads/cell in TSA buffer, and the suspension was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. When necessary, cells were preincubated with 20 μg/ml blocking mAb or 2 mm EDTA for 10 min at room temperature. Binding was determined by measuring the percentage of cells that have bound fluorescent beads by flow cytometry. Binding to FITC-conjugated zymosan was performed as already described (16Cambi A. Gijzen K. de Vries J.M. Torensma R. Joosten B. Adema G.J. Netea M.G. Kullberg B.J. Romani L. Figdor C.G. The C-type lectin DC-SIGN (CD209) is an antigen-uptake receptor for Candida albicans on dendritic cells.Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO transfectants were incubated with FITC-labeled zymosan particles in the absence or the presence of mannan (100 μg/ml) or anti-DC-SIGN mAb AZN-D1 (20 μg/ml) in TSA buffer. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, cell-zymosan conjugates were analyzed by flow cytometry, and the percentage of CHO cells that had acquired an FITC+ signal was quantified by flow cytometry. The internalization assay was performed as already reported (31Tacken P.J. Ginter W. Berod L. Cruz L.J. Joosten B. Sparwasser T. Figdor C.G. Cambi A. Targeting DC-SIGN via its neck region leads to prolonged antigen residence in early endosomes, delayed lysosomal degradation, and cross-presentation.Blood. 2011; 118: 4111-4119Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO cell lines stably expressing DC-SIGN wild type or the deletion mutants were incubated with anti-DC-SIGN mAb hD1 (5 μg/ml) in serum-free medium for 20 min on ice. After washing the unbound mAb in ice-cold medium, half of the cells were further incubated for 15 min on ice to prevent internalization, whereas the other half was shifted to 37 °C for 15 min to induce internalization. Subsequently, cells were placed back on ice to stop internalization, washed in ice-cold PBS containing 3% BSA, and incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-human antibodies for 20 min on ice to stain the mAb still present at the cell surface. Unbound Abs were washed away, and cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde. The mean fluorescence (MF) of the samples was measured by flow cytometry, and the percentage of internalized mAb was calculated as ((MF at 37 °C − MF at 4 °C)/MF at 4 °C) × 100. The normalization to the fluorescence intensity at the steady state (4 °C) prevents oscillations in the expression levels from affecting the percentage of internalization. Isotype controls were always included. CHO transfectants were allowed to adhere and spread on glass coverslips covered by a thin layer of Formvar for 1 h at 37 °C and immediately fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. After two washing steps with PBS and a subsequent incubation (60 min at room temperature) with blocking buffer (PBS, 0.1% glycine, 1% BSA, and 0.25% gelatin) to reduce specific background, the specimens were incubated for 30 min with primary antibodies (DCN46 Ab (Pharmingen) for DC-SIGN-wt, -ΔCRD, and -Δ35 or anti-AU1 Ab (Covance) for DC-SIGN-ΔRep) in blocking buffer on ice, rinsed in PBS, and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde for 15 min. After two washing steps with PBS and blocking buffer, the samples were incubated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG (to detect mAb) for 30 min on ice. A final incubation with 10-nm diameter gold-labeled Protein A (to detect polyclonal antibodies) was performed, followed by final fixation in 1% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer for 20 min at room temperature. To exclude the possibility that the observed difference in nanoclusters was not an artifact of the Ab chosen, anti-AU1 as well as anti-DC-SIGN AZN-D1 and DCN46 antibodies have been used for labeling and comparing DCSIGN wild type and the different mutants. More specifically, whereas anti-AU1 Ab was used to label all DC-SIGN molecules (because all constructs bear the AU1 tag), the anti-CRD Ab AZN-D1 was used to label all DC-SIGN molecules except the Δ-CRD mutant, and the anti-neck Ab DCN46 was applied to label all DC-SIGN molecules except the Δ-Repeat mutant (31Tacken P.J.

When anti-AU1, AZN-D1, and DCN46 labeling were compared for the DC-SIGN wild type, no significant differences in the nanoclustered organization of this receptor were observed (see supplemental Fig. S1). Digital TEM images were processed by custom-written software based on Matlab. See the supplemental Methods text for a full description of sample imaging and analysis. CHO and imDC cells were plated on glass coverslips and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 2 h at room temperature. After blocking of the Fc receptors with 2% human serum, the cells were stained with 30 nm DCN46 Ab (Pharmingen) or anti-AU1 Ab (Covance) for 30 min at room temperature. Secondary Ab labeling was performed with 30 nm Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-mouse Ab (Invitrogen) for 30 min at room temperature. Washing steps were performed with cold PBS buffer (1×). Isotype controls were performed in every experiment in order to rule out nonspecific Ab binding. Superresolution images of DC-SIGN on fully intact cell membranes were obtained using a commercial CW-STED system (Leica Microsystems) or a custom confocal/near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) set-up. Brightness and spot sizes from multiple images were extracted using a custom-written software based on Matlab. See the supplemental Methods for a full description of sample preparation, imaging, and analysis. CHO and imDC cells were stained at sublabeling conditions with anti-human DC-SIGN Fab fragments, generated from DCN46 mAb or monovalent anti-human AU1 antibodies. The Fab fragments and the monovalent antibodies were biotinylated and linked to streptavidin-coated quantum dots (Qdot655, Invitrogen). Samples were imaged using a custom-made single molecule epimicroscope. Movies were recorded on the upper side of the cell membrane at 30–60 Hz frame rates. A full description of the sample preparation, experimental procedure, and trajectory analysis is provided in the supplemental Methods. We previously showed that DC-SIGN expressed in CHO cells serves as a valid model system to study binding, internalization, and trafficking of different antigens targeted to DC-SIGN, recapitulating its essential activities on imDCs (33Cambi A. Beeren I. Joosten B. Fransen J.A. Figdor C.G. The C-type lectin DC-SIGN internalizes soluble antigens and HIV-1 virions via a clathrin-dependent mechanism.Eur. J.

Ligand-conjugated quantum dots monitor antigen uptake and processing by dendritic cells.Nano Lett. 2007; 7: 970-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We thus produced three different DC-SIGN mutants by deletion of specific regions and stably transfected them in CHO cells to investigate their effect on pathogen binding (Fig. 1A). The mutants are denoted as ΔCRD (lacking the CRD domain), ΔRep (lacking the tandem repeats in the extracellular neck region), and Δ35 (lacking the first 35 amino acids from the N terminus in the cytoplasmic tail). We evaluated the functionality and binding capability of the stable transfectants to soluble ligands and virus-sized and micrometer-sized objects. Whereas DC-SIGN-wt, -ΔRep, and -Δ35 bind to fluorescent soluble mannan, the lack of the CRD expectedly prevents binding, consistent with the fact that DC-SIGN-mediated interactions occur through the CRD (20Mitchell D.A. Fadden A.J. Drickamer K. A novel mechanism of carbohydrate recognition by the C-type lectins DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR. Subunit organization and binding to multivalent ligands.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28939-28945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). The addition of blocking antibodies or competing soluble mannan significantly reduces the binding in all cases, showing DC-SIGN specificity. These results confirm that DC-SIGN-wt, -ΔRep, and -Δ35 are all functional on CHO cells and furthermore show that the CRD is available for binding even in the absence of the neck region. To investigate the DC-SIGN capability for virus docking, we carried out binding assays to gp120-coated nanobeads (40 nm in diameter; Fig. 1C) having a size comparable with HIV-1 (35Zhu P. Chertova E. Bess Jr., J. Lifson J.D. Arthur L.O. Liu J. Taylor K.A. Roux K.H. Electron tomography analysis of envelope glycoprotein trimers on HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus virions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 15812-15817Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Interestingly, significant binding is only observed on DC-SIGN-wt and -Δ35. Although a lack of binding is expected for DC-SIGN-ΔCRD, the complete absence of binding of DC-SIGN-ΔRep indicates a key role for the neck region in securing interactions with nanometer-sized particulate antigens."

Ribonucleoproteins represent a large fraction of autoantigens in systemic autoimmune diseases. Here we demonstrate that many uridine-rich mammalian RNA sequences associated with common autoantigens effectively activate autoreactive B cells. Priming with type I IFN increased the magnitude of activation, and the range of which RNAs were stimulatory. A subset of RNAs that contain a high degree of self-complementarity also activated B cells through TLR3. For the RNA sequences that activated predominantly through TLR7, the activation is proportional to uridine-content, and more precisely defined by the frequency of specific uridine-containing motifs. These results identify parameters that define specific mammalian RNAs as ligands for TLRs."
https://openalex.org/W1964249183,"Vibrio cholerae is a gram-negative bacterium that causes cholera. Although the pathogenesis caused by this deadly pathogen takes place in the intestine, commonly thought to be anaerobic, anaerobiosis-induced virulence regulations are not fully elucidated. Anerobic growth of the V. cholerae strain, N16961, was promoted when trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) was used as an alternative electron acceptor. Strikingly, cholera toxin (CT) production was markedly induced during anaerobic TMAO respiration. N16961 mutants unable to metabolize TMAO were incapable of producing CT, suggesting a mechanistic link between anaerobic TMAO respiration and CT production. TMAO reductase is transported to the periplasm via the twin arginine transport (TAT) system. A similar defect in both anaerobic TMAO respiration and CT production was also observed in a N16961 TAT mutant. In contrast, the abilities to grow on TMAO and to produce CT were not affected in a mutant of the general secretion pathway. This suggests that V. cholerae may utilize the TAT system to secrete CT during TMAO respiration. During anaerobic growth with TMAO, N16961 cells exhibit green fluorescence when stained with 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate, a specific dye for reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, CT production was decreased in the presence of an ROS scavenger suggesting a positive role of ROS in regulating CT production. When TMAO was co-administered to infant mice infected with N16961, the mice exhibited more severe pathogenic symptoms. Together, our results reveal a novel anaerobic growth condition that stimulates V. cholerae to produce its major virulence factor."

Data from precolonial warfare, 501 recent wars, and 129 customary court sessions allow us to consider (i) the principles and values behind customary institutions for peace, (ii) their effectiveness, (iii) how they interact with and compare to state institutions of today, and (iv) how such institutions might have shaped our human behavioral repertoire to make life in state societies possible."
https://openalex.org/W2045834678,"Hydrogen-cycling [NiFe] hydrogenases harbor a dinuclear catalytic center composed of nickel and iron ions, which are coordinated by four cysteine residues. Three unusual diatomic ligands in the form of two cyanides (CN(-)) and one carbon monoxide (CO) are bound to the iron and apparently account for the complexity of the cofactor assembly process, which involves the function of at least six auxiliary proteins, designated HypA, -B, -C, -D, -E, and -F. It has been demonstrated previously that the HypC, -D, -E, and -F proteins participate in cyanide synthesis and transfer. Here, we show by infrared spectroscopic analysis that the purified HypCD complexes from Ralstonia eutropha and Escherichia coli carry in addition to both cyanides the CO ligand. We present experimental evidence that in vivo the attachment of the CN(-) ligands is a prerequisite for subsequent CO binding. With the aid of genetic engineering and subsequent mutant analysis, the functional role of conserved cysteine residues in HypD from R. eutropha was investigated. Our results demonstrate that the HypCD complex serves as a scaffold for the assembly of the Fe(CN)(2)(CO) entity of [NiFe] hydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1998675546,"Sialyl-Lewis X (sLeX) is a tetrasaccharide that serves as a ligand for the set of cell adhesion proteins known as selectins. This interaction enables adhesion of leukocytes and cancer cells to endothelial cells within capillaries, resulting in their extravasation into tissues. The last step in sLeX biosynthesis is the α1,3-fucosyltrasferase (FUT)-catalyzed transfer of an L-fucose residue to carbohydrate acceptors. Impairing FUT activity compromises leukocyte homing to sites of inflammation and renders cancer cells less malignant. Inhibition of FUTs is, consequently, of great interest, but efforts to generate glycosyltransferase inhibitors, including FUT inhibitors, has proven challenging. Here we describe a metabolic engineering strategy to inhibit the biosynthesis of sLeX in cancer cells using peracetylated 5-thio-L-fucose (5T-Fuc). We show that 5T-Fuc is taken up by cancer cells and then converted into a sugar nucleotide analog, GDP-5T-Fuc, that blocks FUT activity and limits sLeX presentation on HepG2 cells with an EC50 in the low micromolar range. GDP-5T-Fuc itself does not get transferred by either FUT3 or FUT7 at a measurable rate. We further demonstrate that treatment of cells with 5T-Fuc impaired their adhesive properties to immobilized adhesion molecules and human endothelial cells. 5T-Fuc, therefore, is a useful probe that can be used to modulate sLeX levels in cells to evaluate the consequences of inhibiting FUT-mediated sLeX formation. These data also reveal the utility of using sugar analogues that lead to formation of donor substrate analogues within cells as a general approach to blocking glycosyltransferases in cells.

https://openalex.org/W2068965698,"Mastering Early Divisions The regulation of canonical mitotic cell cycles is well understood, but the basic principles of the rapid, synchronized early mitotic divisions in embryos remains a mystery. Early embryos lack key mitotic regulators such as checkpoints, the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)-inhibitory protein Emi1, and the inhibitory phosphorylations of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1). Working in Xenopus embryos, Tischer et al. (p. 520, published online 27 September) identified XErp1/Emi2 as a mitotic APC/C-inhibitor essential for early mitotic divisions. The mitotic APC/C-inhibitory activity of XErp1 is positively regulated by protein kinase A (PKA) and protein phosphatase IIA (PP2A), which antagonizes Cdk1's inhibitory effect on XErp1. Thus, Cdk1 and PP2A/PKA appear to act antagonistically to control XErp1 activity, which results in the oscillatory activation and inactivation of the APC/C required for fast and synchronous mitotic divisions."
https://openalex.org/W2006906877,"Sarcolemmal CD36 facilitates myocardial fatty acid (FA) uptake, which is markedly reduced in CD36-deficient rodents and humans. CD36 also mediates signal transduction events involving a number of cellular pathways. In taste cells and macrophages, CD36 signaling was recently shown to regulate store-responsive Ca(2+) flux and activation of Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipases A(2) that cycle polyunsaturated FA into phospholipids. It is unknown whether CD36 deficiency influences myocardial Ca(2+) handling and phospholipid metabolism, which could compromise the heart, typically during stresses. Myocardial function was examined in fed or fasted (18-22 h) CD36(-/-) and WT mice. Echocardiography and telemetry identified conduction anomalies that were associated with the incidence of sudden death in fasted CD36(-/-) mice. No anomalies or death occurred in WT mice during fasting. Optical imaging of perfused hearts from fasted CD36(-/-) mice documented prolongation of Ca(2+) transients. Consistent with this, knockdown of CD36 in cardiomyocytes delayed clearance of cytosolic Ca(2+). Hearts of CD36(-/-) mice (fed or fasted) had 3-fold higher SERCA2a and 40% lower phospholamban levels. Phospholamban phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) was enhanced after fasting reflecting increased PKA activity and cAMP levels in CD36(-/-) hearts. Abnormal Ca(2+) homeostasis in the CD36(-/-) myocardium associated with increased lysophospholipid content and a higher proportion of 22:6 FA in phospholipids suggests altered phospholipase A(2) activity and changes in membrane dynamics. The data support the role of CD36 in coordinating Ca(2+) homeostasis and lipid metabolism and the importance of this role during myocardial adaptation to fasting. Potential relevance of the findings to CD36-deficient humans would need to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2093140758,"The Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium lipopolysaccharide consisting of covalently linked lipid A, non-repeating core oligosaccharide, and the O-antigen polysaccharide is the most exposed component of the cell envelope. Previous studies demonstrated that all of these regions act against the host immunity barrier. The aim of this study was to define the role and interaction of PmrAB-dependent gene products required for the lipopolysaccharide component synthesis or modification mainly during the Salmonella infection. The PmrAB two-component system activation promotes a remodeling of lipid A and the core region by addition of 4-aminoarabinose and/or phosphoethanolamine. These PmrA-dependent activities are produced by activation of ugd, pbgPE, pmrC, cpta, and pmrG transcription. In addition, under PmrA regulator activation, the expression of wzz(fepE) and wzz(st) genes is induced, and their products are required to determine the O-antigen chain length. Here we report for the first time that Wzz(st) protein is necessary to maintain the balance of 4-aminoarabinose and phosphoethanolamine lipid A modifications. Moreover, we demonstrate that the interaction of the PmrA-dependent pbgE(2) and pbgE(3) gene products is important for the formation of the short O-antigen region. Our results establish that PmrAB is the global regulatory system that controls lipopolysaccharide modification, leading to a coordinate regulation of 4-aminoarabinose incorporation and O-antigen chain length to respond against the host defense mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2052272381,"Voltage-gated ion channels are responsible for the generation of action potentials in our nervous system. Conformational rearrangements in their voltage sensor domains in response to changes of the membrane potential control pore opening and thus ion conduction. Crystal structures of the open channel in combination with a wealth of biophysical data and molecular dynamics simulations led to a consensus on the voltage sensor movement. However, the coupling between voltage sensor movement and pore opening, the electromechanical coupling, occurs at the cytosolic face of the channel, from where no structural information is available yet. In particular, the question how far the cytosolic pore gate has to close to prevent ion conduction remains controversial. In cells, spectroscopic methods are hindered because labeling of internal sites remains difficult, whereas liposomes or detergent solutions containing purified ion channels lack voltage control. Here, to overcome these problems, we controlled the state of the channel by varying the lipid environment. This way, we directly measured the position of the S4-S5 linker in both the open and the closed state of a prokaryotic Kv channel (KvAP) in a lipid environment using Lanthanide-based resonance energy transfer. We were able to reconstruct the movement of the covalent link between the voltage sensor and the pore domain and used this information as restraints for molecular dynamics simulations of the closed state structure. We found that a small decrease of the pore radius of about 3-4 Å is sufficient to prevent ion permeation through the pore."

Maiburg M.C. Klinefelter syndrome. Clinical and molecular aspects.Expert Rev. Mol. Diagn. 2010; 10: 765-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). About 90% of KS patients bear the 47, XXY karyotype, whereas the 46, XX/47, XXY mosaic karyotype and, less frequently, additional X chromosomes (48, XXXY, and 49, XXXXY) are found in the remaining KS patients (2Forti G.

Clinically, KS is generally characterized by a reduced testicular volume, azoospermia, and some other features such as tall stature, gynecomastia, increased serum FSH excretion, and androgen deficiency, although its clinical picture exhibits a broader spectrum of phenotypes (2Forti G.

Moreover, compared with normal males, KS patients have a higher risk to suffer from many other disorders, such as osteoporosis, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, breast cancer, and subtle cognitive deficits (3Bojesen A.

Nested PCR was carried out with primers provided in Table 2. PCR products were purified and ligated to the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) for sequencing. Cells were digested into single cells with 0.25% trypsin/EDTA and suspended in PBS. Then the cells were treated with hypotonic solution with 0.16 g of potassium chloride and 0.125 g of sodium citrate in 50 ml of deionized water and fixed by solution with glacial acetic acid and methanol in a 1:3 volume ratio. Cell nuclei were collected, and DNA FISH assays were performed by Da An Co. (Shanghai, China). iPSCs were cultured on low attachment dishes with the human EB medium containing KO-DMEM, 20% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acid for 9 days. Then EBs were collected and replated onto Matrigel-coated glass covers for additional 2 days. About 5 × 106 iPSCs were cultured in the presence of 10 μm Y27632 (Calbiochem) overnight, and then collected and injected intramuscularly into SCID mice. About 2 months later, teratomas were collected for H&E staining. For each kind of cells, three biological repeats of samples were prepared. All experiments were performed with Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 gene chips at Shanghai Biotechnology Corp. Raw data were normalized by MAS 5.0 algorithm, and DEGs were analyzed by Gene Spring Software 11.0 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Scatter plots comparing the global gene expression profiles were constructed by the R software. Differentially expressed genes with a fold change of 1.5 were analyzed in the context of Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway using DAVID 6.7 (david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov). The microarray data from this publication have been submitted to GEO database (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) with an accession number of GSE37258. For spontaneous differentiation, iPSCs at 5 × 104 were plated to 6-well plates and cultured in iPSC medium without bFGF. For BMP induction, iPSCs at 5 × 104 were plated to 6-well plates and cultured in the human EB medium supplemented with 10 μm of BMP4, BMP7, and BMP8a (R&D Systems). For both methods, the medium was replaced every 7 days. Samples on the 7th, 14th, or 21st day were collected for gene expression analysis. Cells were digested by 0.25% trypsin/EDTA into single cells and plated on glass slides by cytospin at 200 × g for 3 min. The prepared samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for immunofluorescence staining. All values except as otherwise indicated were analyzed by Student's t test to determine the significance of the differences. p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We established fibroblast cell lines from the foreskin tissue of a normal male and a KS patient, designating them as normal fibroblasts (N-fs) and KS fibroblasts (KS-fs), respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). The KS patient is 27 years old with typical KS symptoms such as hypogonadism and small size of testes in the clinical diagnosis. G banding examination indicated the karyotype of 46, XY for N-fs and 47, XXY for KS-fs (Fig. 1C). All of the cells of KS-fs carried the 47, XXY karyotype, implying that the KS foreskin donor might belong to the group of the most common KS cases with a homogeneous 47, XXY karyotype. Reprogramming of both types of fibroblasts was induced by transduction of retroviral OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC as shown in Fig. 1D. The human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-like colonies were picked on day 12 of infection and expanded to establish the stable iPSC lines. In total, we established one normal iPSC line (N-iPSC-1) and four KS iPSC lines (KS-iPSC-1, -4, -8, and -11). There was no discernible difference in terms of reprogramming speed and efficiency between N-fs and KS-fs. iPSCs from both N-fs and KS-fs exhibited a typical morphology of hESCs and had the same karyotypes as their cognate fibroblasts, suggesting the maintenance of initial karyotypes throughout the reprogramming process (Fig. 1, E and F). The XXY karyotype of KS-iPSCs was further verified by fluorescence in situ hybridization assays (Fig. 1G). In addition, the pattern of seven short tandom repeat sites further verified the origin of N-iPSCs and KS-iPSCs (Table 3).TABLE 3STR detection of normal and KS iPSCsCSFIPOD5S818D7S820D13S317D16S539TH01TPOXSHhES2305.31147.5204.75173.36154.58156.05231.61SHhES2309.4155.86217.24189.68162.71168.11239.82N-fs*a* means undetected.147.39221.4173.57150.71168.13231.52N-fs309.71151.81** means undetected.181.63158.84171.23243.8N-iPSC-1** means undetected.147.48221.33173.45150.71168.17231.65N-iPSC-1313.48151.81** means undetected.181.59158.84171.22243.87KS-fs305.4151.82212.93185.55146.23155.96231.56KS-fs313.64155.91217.08189.65154.77168.01243.91KS-iPSC-1305.51150.8212.88186.03146.01155.86231.47KS-iPSC-1313.68154.93217.02190.01154.58167.88243.75KS-iPSC-4305.32150.81213.03185.55146.09156.11231.5KS-iPSC-4313.51154.93217.15189.56154.68168.2244.41KS-iPSC-8305.36151.81212.93185.77146.51155.91231.51KS-iPSC-8313.48155.95217.05189.84155.07167.94243.76KS-iPSC-11305.37150.81212.93185.45146.3155.96231.48KS-iPSC-11313.53154.98217.08189.55154.82167.97243.75a * means undetected. Open table in a new tab To characterize iPSC lines described above, we first determined the expression of pluripotency-associated markers in comparison with hESCs of the SHhES2 line, which carried a normal 46, XY karyotype and was fully characterized previously (15Li C. Yang Y. Lu X. Sun Y. Gu J. Feng Y. Jin Y. Efficient derivation of Chinese human embryonic stem cell lines from frozen embryos.In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 2010; 46: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cells of all established iPSC lines were alkaline phosphatase-positive (Fig. 1E), and endogenous expression of NANOG, REX1, FGF4, LEFTY, and TDGF-1 as well as OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC was activated (Fig. 2A). Immunofluorescence staining assays also demonstrated the expression of OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, SSEA4, TRA-1–60 and TRA-1–81 in iPSCs (Fig. 2B). Simultaneously, the expression of transgenic genes in iPSCs was silenced significantly (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, similar to hESCs, the OCT4 promoter was hypomethylated in all iPSCs, whereas it was hypermethylated in the starting fibroblasts, further verifying the reprogramming of fibroblasts (Fig. 2D). Next, we assessed the developmental potential of our iPSCs through both in vitro and in vivo assays. EBs formed when iPSCs were cultured in suspension. Various types of cells grew out of EBs after attachment. Immunofluorescence staining revealed the presence of cells expressing endoderm (SOX17 and AFP), mesoderm (Vimentin and FLK1) and ectoderm (NESTIN and TUJ1) markers (Fig. 2E). In addition, teratomas, which contained the respiratory epithelium and goblet cells (endoderm), muscles and cartilage (mesoderm), and neural rosettes and pigmented cells (ectoderm), were detected 4–8 weeks after iPSCs were injected into immune-deficient mice (Fig. 2F). To further define the iPSCs at a global transcriptional level, we compared the transcriptomic feature by scatter plots. As a result, all iPSCs tested approximated to hESCs (correlation coefficient >0.97) but not to their cognate fibroblasts (correlation coefficient <0.65) (Fig. 2G). Therefore, N-fs and KS-fs were successfully reprogrammed into the pluripotent state at a genome-wide transcriptional level. In female cells with a 46, XX karyotype, one of two X chromosomes is inactivated to balance the expression dosage of X chromosome-linked genes with 46, XY male cells. X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is one of the epigenetic regulations in mammalian cells and is initiated by coating of noncoding XIST RNA on X chromosomes followed by exclusion of active chromatin markers and subsequent accumulation of repressive markers, such as H3K27me3 and macroH2A1 (19Heard E. Disteche C.M. Dosage compensation in mammals. Fine-tuning the expression of the X chromosome.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1848-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the mosaic pattern of XCI in normal female fibroblasts was converted to be clonal in human iPSCs after reprogramming (20Tchieu J. Kuoy E. Chin M.H. Trinh H. Patterson M. Sherman S.P. Aimiuwu O. Lindgren A. Hakimian S. Zack J.A. Clark A.T. Pyle A.D. Lowry W.E. Plath K. Female human iPSCs retain an inactive X chromosome.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 329-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The question of whether XCI occurs in KS-iPSCs has not been addressed. We began by examining XIST expression levels in different types of fibroblasts and found that the level of XIST in KS-fs was similar to that in normal female fibroblasts (F-fs) but was significantly higher than that in male normal fibroblasts (N-fs) and hESCs (SHhES2) (Fig. 3A). Moreover, we found an extraordinarily high mRNA level of XIST in KS-iPSCs (Fig. 3B). These observations suggested the undergoing of XCI in both normal female and KS cells. Furthermore, inactive X chromosome (Xi)-like accumulations of H3K27me3 and macroH2A1 were detected in almost all of the KS-iPSCs, whereas only part of KS-fs displayed this enrichment pattern (Fig. 3, C and D). This phenomenon of differential XCI patterns detected between KS-fs and KS-iPSCs was similar to that observed between normal female fibroblasts (data not shown) and normal female iPSCs (F-iPSC), a previously reported iPSC line derived from human amniotic fluid-derived cells (hAFDC-iPS-4) (12Li C. Zhou J. Shi G. Ma Y. Yang Y. Gu J. Yu H. Jin S. Wei Z. Chen F. Jin Y. Pluripotency can be rapidly and efficiently induced in human amniotic fluid-derived cells.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 4340-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). As a negative control, the staining for H3K27me3 and macroH2A1 was not found in normal male fibroblasts (N-fs) (Fig. 3, C and D). Thus, one of the X chromosomes in our KS-iPSCs was inactive as in normal female cells. Although we detected the Xi-like accumulation of repressive markers in all KS-iPSCs, which differentiated into various cell types of the three germ layers in a manner similar to N-iPSCs, there might be aberrant gene expression in KS-iPSCs. First, XCI escaping has been demonstrated in females as well as in KS patients, implying that cells from KS patients may have two active copies of strictly X-linked genes (21Tüttelmann F. Gromoll J. Novel genetic aspects of Klinefelter syndrome.Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2010; 16: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Second, KS-iPSCs could have three active copies of X-Y homologous genes from pseudoautosomal regions (22Ross M.T. Grafham D.V. Coffey A.J. Scherer S. McLay K. Muzny D. Platzer M. Howell G.R.

The DNA sequence of the human X chromosome.Nature. 2005; 434: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). To address this issue, global gene expression profiles of KS-iPSCs (KS-iPSC-1 and -4) were compared with those of normal control cells (N-iPSC-1 and SHhES2). A total of 105 genes was identified as differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with more than a 1.5-fold difference (p < 0.05). Among them, 76 genes had higher expression levels, and 29 genes had lower expression levels in KS-iPSCs than in control cells. The pathway analysis in the DAVID (Database for Annotation Visualization and Integrated Discovery) system indicated the enrichment of the DEGs in some diseases, especially in autoimmune diseases (Fig. 4A), which might reflect an increased risk for KS patients to suffer from autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosis (23Scofield R.H.

Additionally, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation was one of the enriched pathways (Fig. 4A), which could be linked to the female-like features of KS patients. Moreover, genes associated with the protein catabolic process were also differentially expressed (Fig. 4B). In fact, the metabolic syndrome is one of important clinical features of KS (1Giltay J.C. Maiburg M.C. Klinefelter syndrome. Clinical and molecular aspects.Expert Rev. Mol. Diagn. 2010; 10: 765-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2058803565,"Autotransporters (ATs) are a family of bacterial proteins containing a C-terminal β-barrel-forming domain that facilitates the translocation of N-terminal passenger domain whose functions range from adhesion to proteolysis. Genetic replacement of the native passenger domain with heterologous proteins is an attractive strategy not only for applications such as biocatalysis, live-cell vaccines, and protein engineering but also for gaining mechanistic insights toward understanding AT translocation. The ability of ATs to efficiently display functional recombinant proteins containing multiple disulfides has remained largely controversial. By employing high-throughput single-cell flow cytometry, we have systematically investigated the ability of the Escherichia coli AT Antigen 43 (Ag43) to display two different recombinant reporter proteins, a single-chain antibody (M18 scFv) that contains two disulfides and chymotrypsin that contains four disulfides, by varying the signal peptide and deleting the different domains of the native protein. Our results indicate that only the C-terminal β-barrel and the threaded α-helix are essential for efficient surface display of functional recombinant proteins containing multiple disulfides. These results imply that there are no inherent constraints for functional translocation and display of disulfide bond-containing proteins mediated by the AT system and should open new avenues for protein display and engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2160425598,"Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is the causative agent of Johne disease in animals and MAP involvement in human Crohn disease has been recently emphasized. Evidence from M. tuberculosis studies suggests mycobacterial proteins activate dendritic cells (DCs) via Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, eventually determining the fate of immune responses. Here, we investigated whether MAP CobT contributes to the development of T cell immunity through the activation of DCs. MAP CobT recognizes TLR4, and induces DC maturation and activation via the MyD88 and TRIF signaling cascades, which are followed by MAP kinases and NF-κB. We further found that MAP CobT-treated DCs activated naive T cells, effectively polarized CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells to secrete IFN-γ and IL-2, but not IL-4 and IL-10, and induced T cell proliferation. These data indicate that MAP CobT contributes to T helper (Th) 1 polarization of the immune response. MAP CobT-treated DCs specifically induced the expansion of CD4(+)/CD8(+)CD44(high)CD62L(low) memory T cells in the mesenteric lymph node of MAP-infected mice in a TLR4-dependent manner. Our results indicate that MAP CobT is a novel DC maturation-inducing antigen that drives Th1 polarized-naive/memory T cell expansion in a TLR4-dependent cascade, suggesting that MAP CobT potentially links innate and adaptive immunity against MAP."
https://openalex.org/W1964878104,"Bves is widely observed in the cell junction of the skin, epicardium, intestine, and cornea of both developmental embryos and mature adults. However, it is not clear how Bves confers its role in intercellular adhesion. Here, we identified the zebrafish bves (zBves) and found that the epidermal barrier function could be disrupted after knockdown of Bves, and these zBves morphants were sensitive to osmotic stress. A loss of zBves would affect the partitioning defective protein (PAR) junctional complex identified by the rescue experiment with tjp-2/ZO-2 or the PAR complex (par-3, par-6, and prkci/atypical (a)PKC) mRNAs, in which the survival rate of embryos increased 11, 24, 25, and 28%, respectively, after injection with junctional components; the tjp-2 and aPKC mRNA-rescued embryos also had 24 and 45% decreases in the defective rate. Immunofluorescent studies demonstrated that the aggregation of aPKC around the cell junctions had disintegrated in zBves morphants. However, the expression and assembly of zBves were not influenced by aPKC-MO. These results indicate that a loss of zBves affects the proteins involved in the pathway of the PAR junctional complex, especially aPKC, and both aPKC and Bves are indispensable to claudin expression."
https://openalex.org/W1989048765,"InsP(3)-mediated calcium release through the type 2 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP(3)R2) in cardiac myocytes results in the activation of associated CaMKII, thus enabling the kinase to act on downstream targets, such as histone deacetylases 4 and 5 (HDAC4 and HDAC5). The CaMKII activity also feedback modulates InsP(3)R2 function by direct phosphorylation and results in a dramatic decrease in the receptor-channel open probability (P(o)). We have identified S150 in the InsP(3)R2 core suppressor domain (amino acids 1-225) as the specific residue that is phosphorylated by CaMKII. Site-directed mutagenesis reveals that S150 is the CaMKII phosphorylation site responsible for modulation of channel activity. Nonphosphorylatable (S150A) and phosphomimetic (S150E) mutations were studied in planar lipid bilayers. The InsP(3)R2 S150A channel showed no decrease in activity when treated with CaMKII. Conversely, the phosphomimetic (S150E) channel displayed a very low P(o) under normal recording conditions in the absence of CaMKII (2 μM InsP(3) and 250 nM [Ca(2+)](FREE)) and mimicked a WT channel that has been phosphorylated by CaMKII. Phopho-specific antibodies demonstrate that InsP(3)R2 Ser-150 is phosphorylated in vivo by CaMKIIδ. The results of this study show that serine 150 of the InsP(3)R2 is phosphorylated by CaMKII and results in a decrease in the channel open probability."
https://openalex.org/W2039901936,"Vitronectin (VN) is an extracellular matrix protein abundantly present in blood and a wide variety of tissues and plays important roles in a number of biological phenomena mainly through its binding to αV integrins. However, its definite function in the brain remains largely unknown. Here we report the identification of telencephalin (TLCN/ICAM-5) as a novel VN receptor on neuronal dendrites. VN strongly binds to TLCN, a unique neuronal member of the ICAM family, which is specifically expressed on dendrites of spiny neurons in the mammalian telencephalon. VN-coated microbeads induce the formation of phagocytic cup-like plasma membrane protrusions on dendrites of cultured hippocampal neurons and trigger the activation of TLCN-dependent intracellular signaling cascade including the phosphorylation of ezrin/radixin/moesin actin-binding proteins and recruitment of F-actin and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate for morphological transformation of the dendritic protrusions. These results suggest that the extracellular matrix molecule VN and its neuronal receptor TLCN play a pivotal role in the phosphorylation of ezrin/radixin/moesin proteins and the formation of phagocytic cup-like structures on neuronal dendrites."

Using affinity capture of neuronal proteins by immobilized DREAM/KChIP3 in the presence and absence of calcium (Ca2+) followed by mass spectroscopic identification of interacting proteins, we demonstrate that in the presence of Ca2+, DREAM/KChIP3 interacts with the EF-hand protein, calmodulin (CaM).

Ca2+-bound DREAM/KChIP3 binds CaM with a dissociation constant of ∼3 μm as assessed by changes in DREAM/KChIP3 intrinsic protein fluorescence in the presence of CaM. Two-dimensional 1H,15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra reveal changes in chemical shifts and line broadening upon the addition of CaM to 15N DREAM/KChIP3. The amino-terminal portion of DREAM/KChIP3 is required for its binding to CaM because a construct of DREAM/KChIP3 lacking the first 94 amino-terminal residues fails to bind CaM as assessed by fluorescence spectroscopy. The addition of Ca2+-bound DREAM/KChIP3 increases the activation of calcineurin (CN) by calcium CaM. A DREAM/KChIP3 mutant incapable of binding Ca2+ also stimulates calmodulin-dependent CN activity. The shortened form of DREAM/KChIP3 lacking the NH2-terminal amino acids fails to activate CN in the presence of calcium CaM.

Our data demonstrate the interaction of DREAM/KChIP3 with the important EF-hand protein, CaM, and show that the interaction alters CN activity."

https://openalex.org/W2005112169,"The use of scientific inquiry in studying plant growth is perhaps as old as agriculture itself. Our ability to feed our current population is the result of the historical application of the scientific method to basic questions about the response of plants to their environment. However, most of today's students have likely never pondered basic questions about plant growth and may not even know general rules of thumb about growing their own food."
