https://openalex.org/W2095099413,"Polyglutamine expansion (polyQ) in the protein huntingtin is pathogenic and responsible for the neuronal toxicity associated with Huntington's disease (HD). Although wild-type huntingtin possesses antiapoptotic properties, the relationship between the neuroprotective functions of huntingtin and pathogenesis of HD remains unclear. Here, we show that huntingtin specifically enhances vesicular transport of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) along microtubules. Huntingtin-mediated transport involves huntingtin-associated protein-1 (HAP1) and the p150(Glued) subunit of dynactin, an essential component of molecular motors. BDNF transport is attenuated both in the disease context and by reducing the levels of wild-type huntingtin. The alteration of the huntingtin/HAP1/p150(Glued) complex correlates with reduced association of motor proteins with microtubules. Finally, we find that the polyQ-huntingtin-induced transport deficit results in the loss of neurotrophic support and neuronal toxicity. Our findings indicate that a key role of huntingtin is to promote BDNF transport and suggest that loss of this function might contribute to pathogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2171283389,"Although jawless vertebrates are apparently capable of adaptive immune responses, they have not been found to possess the recombinatorial antigen receptors shared by all jawed vertebrates. Our search for the phylogenetic roots of adaptive immunity in the lamprey has instead identified a new type of variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) composed of highly diverse leucine-rich repeats (LRR) sandwiched between amino- and carboxy-terminal LRRs. An invariant stalk region tethers the VLRs to the cell surface by means of a glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol anchor. To generate rearranged VLR genes of the diversity necessary for an anticipatory immune system, the single lamprey VLR locus contains a large bank of diverse LRR cassettes, available for insertion into an incomplete germline VLR gene. Individual lymphocytes express a uniquely rearranged VLR gene in monoallelic fashion. Different evolutionary strategies were thus used to generate highly diverse lymphocyte receptors through rearrangement of LRR modules in agnathans (jawless fish) and of immunoglobulin gene segments in gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates)."

https://openalex.org/W1974220691,"Nearly 20% of yeast genes are required for viability, hindering genetic analysis with knockouts. We created promoter-shutoff strains for over two-thirds of all essential yeast genes and subjected them to morphological analysis, size profiling, drug sensitivity screening, and microarray expression profiling. We then used this compendium of data to ask which phenotypic features characterized different functional classes and used these to infer potential functions for uncharacterized genes. We identified genes involved in ribosome biogenesis (HAS1, URB1, and URB2), protein secretion (SEC39), mitochondrial import (MIM1), and tRNA charging (GSN1). In addition, apparent negative feedback transcriptional regulation of both ribosome biogenesis and the proteasome was observed. We furthermore show that these strains are compatible with automated genetic analysis. This study underscores the importance of analyzing mutant phenotypes and provides a resource to complement the yeast knockout collection."
https://openalex.org/W2167966527,"Marfan syndrome is an extracellular matrix disorder with cardinal manifestations in the eye, skeleton and cardiovascular systems associated with defects in the gene encoding fibrillin (FBN1) at 15q21.1 (ref. 1). A second type of the disorder (Marfan syndrome type 2; OMIM 154705) is associated with a second locus, MFS2, at 3p25-p24.2 in a large French family (family MS1). Identification of a 3p24.1 chromosomal breakpoint disrupting the gene encoding TGF-beta receptor 2 (TGFBR2) in a Japanese individual with Marfan syndrome led us to consider TGFBR2 as the gene underlying association with Marfan syndrome at the MSF2 locus. The mutation 1524G-->A in TGFBR2 (causing the synonymous amino acid substitution Q508Q) resulted in abnormal splicing and segregated with MFS2 in family MS1. We identified three other missense mutations in four unrelated probands, which led to loss of function of TGF-beta signaling activity on extracellular matrix formation. These results show that heterozygous mutations in TGFBR2, a putative tumor-suppressor gene implicated in several malignancies, are also associated with inherited connective-tissue disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2168979257,"The only reported role for the conjugation of the NEDD8 ubiquitin-like molecule is control of the activity of SCF ubiquitin ligase complexes. Here, we show that the Mdm2 RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase can also promote NEDD8 modification of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Mdm2 is itself modified with NEDD8 with very similar characteristics to the autoubiquitination activity of Mdm2. By using a cell line (TS-41) with a temperature-sensitive mutation in the NEDD8 conjugation pathway and a p53 mutant that cannot be NEDDylated (3NKR), we demonstrate that Mdm2-dependent NEDD8 modification of p53 inhibits its transcriptional activity. These findings expand the role for Mdm2 as an E3 ligase, providing evidence that Mdm2 is a common component of the ubiquitin and NEDD8 conjugation pathway and indicating the diverse mechanisms by which E3 ligases can control the function of substrate proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2021484300,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) potently inhibits cell cycle progression at the G1 phase. Smad3 has a key function in mediating the TGF-beta growth-inhibitory response. Here we show that Smad3 is a major physiological substrate of the G1 cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK2. Except for the retinoblastoma protein family, Smad3 is the only CDK4 substrate demonstrated so far. We have mapped CDK4 and CDK2 phosphorylation sites to Thr 8, Thr 178 and Ser 212 in Smad3. Mutation of the CDK phosphorylation sites increases Smad3 transcriptional activity, leading to higher expression of the CDK inhibitor p15. Mutation of the CDK phosphorylation sites of Smad3 also increases its ability to downregulate the expression of c-myc. Using Smad3(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts and other epithelial cell lines, we further show that Smad3 inhibits cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase and that mutation of the CDK phosphorylation sites in Smad3 increases this ability. Taken together, these findings indicate that CDK phosphorylation of Smad3 inhibits its transcriptional activity and antiproliferative function. Because cancer cells often contain high levels of CDK activity, diminishing Smad3 activity by CDK phosphorylation may contribute to tumorigenesis and TGF-beta resistance in cancers."

https://openalex.org/W2058496850,"Recruitment of ubiquitinated proteins to the 26S proteasome lies at the heart of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Genetic studies suggest a role for the multiubiquitin chain binding proteins (MCBPs) Rad23 and Rpn10 in recruitment, but biochemical studies implicate the Rpt5 ATPase. We addressed this issue by analyzing degradation of the ubiquitinated Cdk inhibitor Sic1 (UbSic1) in vitro. Mutant rpn10Delta and rad23Delta proteasomes failed to bind or degrade UbSic1. Although Rpn10 or Rad23 restored UbSic1 recruitment to either mutant, rescue of degradation by Rad23 uncovered a requirement for the VWA domain of Rpn10. In vivo analyses confirmed that Rad23 and the multiubiquitin binding domain of Rpn10 contribute to Sic1 degradation. Turnover studies of multiple UPS substrates uncovered an unexpected degree of specificity in their requirements for MCBPs. We propose that recruitment of substrates to the proteasome by MCBPs provides an additional layer of substrate selectivity in the UPS."

https://openalex.org/W2153771223,"Activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor alpha-subunits, HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha, seems to be subject to similar regulatory mechanisms, and transgene approaches suggested partial functional redundancy. Here, we used RNA interference to determine the contribution of HIF-1alpha vs. HIF-2alpha to the hypoxic gene induction. Surprisingly, most genes tested were responsive only to the HIF-1alpha siRNA, showing no effect by HIF-2alpha knock-down. The same was found for the activation of reporter genes driven by hypoxia-responsive elements (HREs) from the erythropoietin (EPO), vascular endothelial growth factor, or phosphoglycerate kinase gene. Interestingly, EPO was the only gene investigated that showed responsiveness only to HIF-2alpha knock-down, as observed in Hep3B and Kelly cells. In contrast to the EPO-HRE reporter, the complete EPO enhancer displayed dependency on HIF-2alpha regulation, indicating that additional cis-acting elements confer HIF-2alpha specificity within this region. In 786-0 cells lacking HIF-1alpha protein, the identified HIF-1alpha target genes were regulated by HIF-2alpha. Overexpression of the HIFalpha subunits in different cell lines also led to a loss of target gene specificity. In conclusion, we found a remarkably restricted target gene specificity of the HIFalpha subunits, which can be overcome in cells with perturbations in the pVHL/HIF system and under forced expression."

https://openalex.org/W1963611021,"Hierarchical galaxy formation is the model whereby massive galaxies form from an assembly of smaller units. The most massive objects therefore form last. The model succeeds in describing the clustering of galaxies, but the evolutionary history of massive galaxies, as revealed by their visible stars and gas, is not accurately predicted. Near-infrared observations (which allow us to measure the stellar masses of high-redshift galaxies) and deep multi-colour images indicate that a large fraction of the stars in massive galaxies form in the first 5 Gyr (refs 4-7), but uncertainties remain owing to the lack of spectra to confirm the redshifts (which are estimated from the colours) and the role of obscuration by dust. Here we report the results of a spectroscopic redshift survey that probes the most massive and quiescent galaxies back to an era only 3 Gyr after the Big Bang. We find that at least two-thirds of massive galaxies have appeared since this era, but also that a significant fraction of them are already in place in the early Universe."
https://openalex.org/W2041230280,"BCL2 family members are subject to regulation at multiple levels, providing checks on their ability to contribute to tumorigenesis. However, findings on post-translational BCL2 phosphorylation in different systems have been difficult to integrate. Another antiapoptotic family member, MCL1, exhibits a difference in electrophoretic mobility upon phosphorylation induced by an activator of PKC (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate; TPA) versus agents that act on microtubules or protein phosphatases 1/2A. A multiple pathway model is now presented, which demonstrates that MCL1 can undergo distinct phosphorylation events - mediated through separate signaling processes and involving different target sites - in cells that remain viable in the presence of TPA versus cells destined to die upon exposure to taxol or okadaic acid. Specifically, TPA induces phosphorylation at a conserved extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) site in the PEST region (Thr 163) and slows turnover of the normally rapidly degraded MCL1 protein; however, okadaic acid and taxol induce ERK-independent MCL1 phosphorylation at additional discrete sites. These findings add a new dimension to our understanding of the complex regulation of antiapoptotic BCL2 family members by demonstrating that, in addition to transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, MCL1 is subject to multiple, separate, post-translational phosphorylation events, produced in living versus dying cells at ERK-inducible versus ERK-independent sites."
https://openalex.org/W2013286714,"During transcription, RNA polymerase (Pol) II synthesizes eukaryotic messenger RNA. Transcription is coupled to RNA processing by the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II, which consists of up to 52 repeats of the sequence Tyr 1-Ser 2-Pro 3-Thr 4-Ser 5-Pro 6-Ser 7 (refs 1, 2). After phosphorylation, the CTD binds tightly to a conserved CTD-interacting domain (CID) present in the proteins Pcf11 and Nrd1, which are essential and evolutionarily conserved factors for polyadenylation-dependent and -independent 3'-RNA processing, respectively. Here we describe the structure of a Ser 2-phosphorylated CTD peptide bound to the CID domain of Pcf11. The CTD motif Ser 2-Pro 3-Thr 4-Ser 5 forms a beta-turn that binds to a conserved groove in the CID domain. The Ser 2 phosphate group does not make direct contact with the CID domain, but may be recognized indirectly because it stabilizes the beta-turn with an additional hydrogen bond. Iteration of the peptide structure results in a compact beta-spiral model of the CTD. The model suggests that, during the mRNA transcription-processing cycle, compact spiral regions in the CTD are unravelled and regenerated in a phosphorylation-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1975162569,"In conventional superconductors, the electron pairing that allows superconductivity is caused by exchange of virtual phonons, which are quanta of lattice vibration. For high-transition-temperature (high-T(c)) superconductors, it is far from clear that phonons are involved in the pairing at all. For example, the negligible change in T(c) of optimally doped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta (Bi2212; ref. 1) upon oxygen isotope substitution (16O --> 18O leads to T(c) decreasing from 92 to 91 K) has often been taken to mean that phonons play an insignificant role in this material. Here we provide a detailed comparison of the electron dynamics of Bi2212 samples containing different oxygen isotopes, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Our data show definite and strong isotope effects. Surprisingly, the effects mainly appear in broad high-energy humps, commonly referred to as 'incoherent peaks'. As a function of temperature and electron momentum, the magnitude of the isotope effect closely correlates with the superconducting gap--that is, the pair binding energy. We suggest that these results can be explained in a dynamic spin-Peierls picture, where the singlet pairing of electrons and the electron-lattice coupling mutually enhance each other."

https://openalex.org/W2162465800,"Border cell migration in the Drosophila ovary is a relatively simple and genetically tractable model for studying the conversion of epithelial cells to migratory cells. Like many cell migrations, border cell migration is inhibited by a dominant-negative form of the GTPase Rac. To identify new genes that function in Rac-dependent cell motility, we screened for genes that when overexpressed suppressed the migration defect caused by dominant-negative Rac. Overexpression of the Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (DIAP1), which is encoded by the thread (th) gene, suppressed the migration defect. Moreover, loss-of-function mutations in th caused migration defects but, surprisingly, did not cause apoptosis. Mutations affecting the Dark protein, an activator of the upstream caspase Dronc, also rescued RacN17 migration defects. These results indicate an apoptosis-independent role for DIAP1-mediated Dronc inhibition in Rac-mediated cell motility."
https://openalex.org/W2052241455,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is produced during bacterial and viral infections and by various malignant tumors. Here, we describe novel immunosuppressive properties of IL-6 in dendritic cells (DC). In the presence of GM-CSF, IL-4, and a maturation stimulus, IL-6 skewed monocyte differentiation into phenotypically mature but functionally impaired DC. In DC matured with the toll-like receptor (TLR)4 stimulus lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or other pro-inflammatory stimuli, IL-6 inhibited CCR7 chemokine receptor up-regulation. As demonstrated for LPS-stimulated DC, IL-6 impaired chemotaxis to CCR7-activating chemokines required for recruiting DC to lymphoid tissues in vivo. Moreover, IL-6 inhibited production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma inducible protein-10 (IP-10) in DC, and DC-driven allogeneic T cell proliferation in mixed lymphocyte reactions. CCR7 expression was blocked at the transcriptional level. IL-6 led to inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) binding activity, regulating CCR7 transcription. Neutralization experiments revealed that autocrine IL-10 partially contributed to CCR7 suppression in IL-6-treated DC. Thus IL-6, a cytokine once labeled as ""pro-inflammatory"" can mediate immunosuppressive functions, which may involve induction of the classical ""anti-inflammatory"" cytokine IL-10. Because IL-6 is expressed in response to various pro-inflammatory stimuli in vivo, this mechanism may contribute to down-regulating the immune response initiated by pathogens, in persistent infections or tumors."

https://openalex.org/W2050635677,"Vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) fate decisions (cell growth, migration, and apoptosis) are fundamental features in the pathogenesis of vascular disease. We investigated the role of Notch 1 and 3 receptor signaling in controlling adult SMC fate in vitro by establishing that hairy enhancer of split (hes-1 and -5) and related hrt's (hrt-1, -2, and -3) are direct downstream target genes of Notch 1 and 3 receptors in SMC and identified an essential role for nuclear protein CBF-1/RBP-Jk in their regulation. Constitutive expression of active Notch 1 and 3 receptors (Notch IC) resulted in a significant up-regulation of CBF-1/RBP-Jk-dependent promoter activity and Notch target gene expression concomitant with significant increases in SMC growth while concurrently inhibiting SMC apoptosis and migration. Moreover, inhibition of endogenous Notch mediated CBF-1/RBP-Jk regulated gene expression with a non-DNA binding mutant of CBF-1, a Notch IC deleted of its delta RAM domain and the Epstein-Barr virus encoded RPMS-1, in conjunction with pharmacological inhibitors of Notch IC receptor trafficking (brefeldin A and monensin), resulted in a significant decrease in cell growth while concomitantly increasing SMC apoptosis and migration. These findings suggest that endogenous Notch receptors and downstream target genes control vascular cell fate in vitro. Notch signaling, therefore, represents a novel therapeutic target for disease states in which changes in vascular cell fate occur in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2117574147,"Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha and -2alpha are key regulators of the transcriptional response to hypoxia and pivotal in mediating the consequences of many disease states. In the present work, we define their temporo-spatial accumulation after myocardial infarction and systemic hypoxia. Rats were exposed to hypoxia or underwent coronary artery ligation. Immunohistochemistry was used for detection of HIF-1alpha and -2alpha proteins and target genes, and mRNA levels were determined by RNase protection. Marked nuclear accumulation of HIF-1alpha and -2alpha occurred after both systemic hypoxia and coronary ligation in cardiomyocytes as well as interstitial and endothelial cells (EC) without pronounced changes in HIF mRNA levels. While systemic hypoxia led to widespread induction of HIF, expression after coronary occlusion occurred primarily at the border of infarcted tissue. This expression persisted for 4 wk, included infiltrating macrophages, and colocalized with target gene expression. Subsets of cells simultaneously expressed both HIF-alpha subunits, but EC more frequently induced HIF-2alpha. A progressive increase of HIF-2alpha but not HIF-1alpha occurred in areas remote from the infarct, including the interventricular septum. Cardiomyocytes and cardiac stromal cells exhibit a marked potential for a prolonged transcriptional response to ischemia mediated by HIF. The induction of HIF-1alpha and -2alpha appears to be complementary rather than solely redundant."
https://openalex.org/W2079773807,"Insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)-3 has both growth-inhibiting and growth-promoting effects at the cellular level. The cytotoxic action of several anticancer drugs is linked to increased ceramide generation through sphingomyelin hydrolysis or de novo biosynthesis. Herein, we investigated the role of IGFBP-3 on apoptosis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and its relationship with ceramide levels. We report that IGFBP-3 exerts dual effects on HUVEC, potentiating doxorubicin-induced apoptosis but enhancing survival in serum-starved conditions. Ceramide was increased by IGFBP-3 in the presence of doxorubicin and decreased when IGFBP-3 was added alone to cells cultured in serum-free medium. The protection exerted by the ceramide synthase inhibitor fumonisin B1 over doxorubicin-induced apoptosis was enhanced by IGFBP-3 with concomitant reduction of ceramide levels. IGFBP-3 alone activated sphingosine kinase (SK) and increased SK1 mRNA; the SK inhibitor N,N-dimethylsphingosine (DMS) blocked IGFBP-3 antiapoptotic effect. Moreover, IGFBP-3 increased IGF-I mRNA and dramatically enhanced IGF-I release. IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) and its downstream signaling pathways Akt and ERK were phosphorylated by IGFBP-3, whereas inhibition of IGF-IR phosphorylation with tyrphostin AG1024 suppressed the antiapopoptic effect of IGFBP-3. Finally, IGFBP-3 increased endothelial cell motility in all experimental conditions. These findings provide evidence that IGFBP-3 differentially regulates endothelial cell apoptosis by involvement of the sphingolipid signaling pathways. Moreover, the survival effect of IGFBP-3 seems to be mediated by the IGF-IR."
https://openalex.org/W1994587909,"Maintenance of the translation reading frame is one of the most remarkable achievements of the ribosome while decoding the information of an mRNA. Loss of the reading frame through spontaneous frameshifting occurs with a frequency of one in 30,000 amino acid incorporations. However, at many recoding sites, the mechanism that controls reading frame maintenance is switched off. One such example is the programmed +1 frameshift site of the prfB gene encoding the termination factor RF2, in which slippage into the forward frame by one nucleotide can attain an efficiency of approximately 100%, namely, four orders of magnitude higher than normally observed. Here, using the RF2 frameshift window, we demonstrate that premature release of the E site tRNA from the ribosome is coupled with high-level frameshifting. Consistently, in a minimal system, the presence of the E site tRNA prevents the +1 frameshift event, illustrating the importance of the E site for reading-frame maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W2006688297,"Plant R2R3 MYB domain proteins comprise one of the largest known families of transcription factors. Discrete evolutionary steps have shaped the plant-specific R2R3 MYB family from the broadly distributed R1R2R3 MYB proteins. R1R2R3 MYB domains have a single Cys residue (Cys-130) that needs to be reduced for DNA binding and transcriptional activity. In contrast, most R2R3 MYB domains contain two cysteines, Cys-49 and Cys-53, with Cys-53 at the equivalent position as Cys-130 in R1R2R3 MYB. Using the maize P1 regulator of flavonoid biosynthesis as a typical R2R3 MYB-domain protein, we investigated here the in vitro REDOX requirement for DNA binding by P1. We show that the C53S mutation requires reducing conditions for DNA-binding, whereas C53A binds DNA under oxidizing and reducing conditions. Neither mutation impairs the in vivo regulatory activity of P1. The C49S and C49A mutants bind DNA in vitro irrespective of the REDOX conditions. A C49I mutant, which simulates the MYB domain of c-MYB, binds DNA only under reducing conditions, and its binding is significantly affected by the C53S replacement. It is interesting that under non-reducing conditions, Cys-49 and Cys-53 form a disulfide bond that prevents the R2R3 MYB domain from binding DNA. Together, our results suggest that the evolutionary origin of Cys-49 within the plants has provided R2R3 MYB domains with a regulatory feature not present in animal MYB domains, highlighting fundamental structural and functional differences between similar DNA-binding domains from plants and animals.

The evolutionary steps involved in the formation of the plant-specific R2R3 MYB domains from the broadly distributed R1R2R3 MYB domains involved the sequential i) loss of R1 to yield the “atypical R2R3 MYB domains,” ii) replacement of the first tryptophan of R3 by a hydrophobic amino acid, and iii) insertion of a Leu residue between the second and third helices of R2, to give the “typical R2R3 MYB” domains (9Dias A.P.

The amplification of the R2R3 Myb gene family in the plants provides a unique opportunity to understand how the evolutionary steps that shaped a family of transcription factors resulted in the functional differences displayed by these regulatory proteins throughout the plant kingdom. A residue that has remained completely conserved in plants, fungi, and animals during the evolution of MYB domains corresponds to a cysteine located in the DNA recognition helix of R2 (Cys-130 in c-MYB corresponding to Cys-53 in Fig. 1B). This cysteine was proposed to serve as a REDOX sensor in vertebrate MYB transcription factors, and mutations of this residue significantly impaired DNA binding and transcriptional activity of c-MYB and v-MYB (17Grasser F.A. LaMontagne K. Whittaker L. Stohr S. Lipsick J.S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1005-1009PubMed Google Scholar, 18Guehmann S. Vorbrueggen G. Kalkbrenner F. Moelling K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2279-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The NMR structure of the R2R3 MYB domain of c-MYB indicated that Cys-130, the only cysteine present in c-MYB and related MYB factors from vertebrates, is included in the hydrophobic core, maintaining the three helices of R2 in an unbound conformation at room temperature (4Ogata K. Morikawa S. Nakamura H. Sekikawa A. Inoue T. Kanai H. Sarai A. Ishii S. Nishimura Y. Cell. 1994; 79: 639-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Consistent with this model, the replacement of Cys-130 for Ser in c-MYB resulted in the loss of DNA binding (18Guehmann S. Vorbrueggen G. Kalkbrenner F. Moelling K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2279-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It is interesting, however, that during the evolution of R2R3 MYB domains (Fig. 1A), a second cysteine appeared, located four residues N-terminal to the highly conserved Cys-53 (Cys-49 in Fig. 1B). Cys-49 is conserved in typical R2R3 MYB domains, but it is not present in the atypical R2R3 MYB domains or in the MYB domains of pc-MYB proteins (Fig. 1B). We previously investigated the REDOX requirements of the P1 protein for DNA-binding. P1 encodes a typical R2R3 MYB transcriptional regulator of genes encoding biosynthetic enzymes of a branch of the maize flavonoid pathway (19Grotewold E. Drummond B.J. Bowen B. Peterson T. Cell. 1994; 76: 543-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). P1 activates transcription of the a1 gene by binding to the high and low affinity P1-binding sites present in the a1 promoter (19Grotewold E. Drummond B.J. Bowen B. Peterson T. Cell. 1994; 76: 543-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 20Sainz M.B. Grotewold E. Chandler V.L. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 611-625PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to the DNA-binding activity of c-MYB, P1 requires a strong reducing environment to bind DNA (13Williams C.E. Grotewold E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 563-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). As is the case with other R2R3 MYB proteins, P1 contains two Cys residues in the MYB domain (Cys-49 and Cys-53, Fig. 1B) in addition to two cysteines in the short N-terminal region that precedes the MYB domain (21Grotewold E. Athma P. Peterson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4587-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the participation of the two MYB domain cysteines in the REDOX regulation of the DNA-binding activity of typical R2R3 MYB domains exemplified by the maize P1 transcription factor. We show that the conserved cysteine at position 53 (Cys-53) is not essential for the DNA-binding activity of P1, in sharp departure from what has been established for vertebrate MYB proteins. Instead, Cys-49 plays a much more important role in sensing the REDOX conditions, when Cys-53 is replaced by Ser. However, in the C53A mutant, the DNA-binding activity of P1 becomes insensitive to oxidizing conditions. In vivo, the replacements of Cys-53 to Ser or Ala have no effect on the transcriptional activity of P1. The replacement of Cys-49 by Ser or Ala results in P1 proteins insensitive to the REDOX environment for DNA binding. We also show that Cys-49 and Cys-53 form an intramolecular disulfide bond in non-reducing conditions, providing an evolutionary new opportunity for the modulation of the DNA-binding activity of R2R3 MYB-domain proteins. Together, our studies suggest a novel mechanism for the REDOX control of DNA-binding by R2R3 MYB domains and suggest fundamental structural differences between plant and animal MYB domains. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The P1 MYB domain (amino acids 1-118) was previously cloned as a N-terminal poly-histidine fusion (N10His-PMYB) (13Williams C.E. Grotewold E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 563-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For the truncated version of the P1 MYB domain (N6His-PMYBΔ9), the coding region corresponding to amino acids 10-118 was generated by PCR from the full-length cDNA of P1 (21Grotewold E. Athma P. Peterson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4587-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The resulting PCR product was then introduced into the pKM260 (22Melcher K. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 277: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) Escherichia coli expression vector via NcoI and BamHI sites to generate N6His-PMYBΔ9. The amino acid sequence of N6His-PMYBΔ9 N-terminal to the MYB-domain sequence shown in Fig. 1 is NH2-MHHHHHHHASENLYFQGAM and the sequence C-terminal to the MYB domain is PAANKARKEAELAATAEQCOO-. All point mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange mutagenesis kit; Stratagene) of the PMYBΔ9 coding sequence in the pTAdv (Clontech) cloning vector. The MYB domain was then excised from the pTAdv vector and inserted into pKM260 E. coli expression vector through NcoI and BamHI sites. For expression in E. coli, BL21 (DE3) PlyS cells bearing the corresponding plasmids were grown, induced, and purified essentially as described previously (13Williams C.E. Grotewold E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 563-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. After induction of a 1-L culture, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at -80 °C until further use. The cells were resuspended in 20 ml SB (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and passed twice through a French press. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was filtered through two layers of Mira-cloth (Calbiochem). The nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose resin (Qiagen) was equilibrated with SB, and 1 ml of 50% slurry was added to the cell lysate supernatant and incubated for 2 h with rocking at 4 °C. The resin was gently recovered by centrifugation, re-suspended in 5 ml of SB, and loaded onto a column. The column was washed five times with 5 column volumes of SB and three times with 5 column volumes of WB (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1% Tween 20, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol). The protein was eluted with five washes of 5 column volumes of WB containing 50 mm imidazole. The elutions were then dialyzed against 60 volumes of A-0 buffer (10 mm Tris pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; APB1, high affinity P1-binding sites from the a1 gene promoter; APB5, a mutant in which the P1-binding sites were destroyed; GUS, β-glucoronidase; DCIA, 7-diethylamino-3-(4′-iodoacetylaminophenyl)-4-methylcoumarin; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; WT, wild type. 1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol) and stored at -80 °C until further use. Each wash and elution fraction was collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and quantified against a lysozyme protein standard. Purified proteins were used for each assay and were judged to be >90% pure by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of 15% SDS-PAGE gels. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Aliquots of purified proteins were incubated with end-labeled, double-stranded DNA generated by hybridization of complementary oligonucleotides. End labeling of synthetic oligonucleotide probes was carried out using T4-polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) in the presence of a 2 molar excess of [γ-32P]ATP (>8,000 Ci/mmol; ICN). The labeled oligonucleotides were then annealed to an equimolar amount of complementary oligonucleotides by heating to 95 °C and cooling to room temperature. A fraction of the double-stranded labeled oligonucleotides was precipitated on glass filters for quantification by scintillation of the radiation incorporated. The probes used contain APB1, the high affinity P1-binding sites from the a1 gene promoter, or APB5, a mutant in which the sites were destroyed (Fig. 2A) (19Grotewold E. Drummond B.J. Bowen B. Peterson T. Cell. 1994; 76: 543-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Protein-DNA incubations were performed essentially as described previously (19Grotewold E. Drummond B.J. Bowen B. Peterson T. Cell. 1994; 76: 543-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Approximately 35 ng of protein were incubated in A-0 buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol) with 0.8 μg of poly d(I)/d(C), and 1 mm DTT, unless indicated otherwise. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 8% polyacrylamide gels (80:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide) in 0.25× Tris-borate/EDTA (22.5 mm Tris-Borate and 0.5 mm EDTA) running buffer at 415 V for 55 min at 4 °C. The gels were then dried onto Whatman paper and subjected to autoradiography at -70 °C overnight. Tryptophan Fluorescence—Fluorescence experiments were carried out in a Horbia Fluoromax-3 Luminescence Spectrometer. An excitation wavelength of 295 nm was used with an emission and excitation slit width of 5 nm. Emission spectra were recorded at 0.5-nm intervals between 310 and 400 nm with a scanning speed of 300 nm/min. Samples were analyzed in a quartz cuvette (1.0 × 1.0 cm) and contained 0.5 μm purified recombinant proteins in 3 ml of A-0 buffer. To determine the fluorescence spectra of the proteins in denaturing conditions, the purified recombinant proteins were incubated with 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride in A-0 buffer at room temperature for 1 h before the fluorescence analysis. Each spectrum was combined as an average of five scans and corrected to the background of the A-0 buffer, with or without guanidinium hydrochloride. DNA Constructs for Transient Expression Experiments—The p35SP1 construct was described previously (23Grotewold E. Sainz M.B. Tagliani L. Hernandez J.M. Bowen B. Chandler V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13579-13584Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Other previously described constructs include pA1Luc, which contains 220 bp of the a1 promoter (19Grotewold E. Drummond B.J. Bowen B. Peterson T. Cell. 1994; 76: 543-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 20Sainz M.B. Grotewold E. Chandler V.L. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 611-625PubMed Google Scholar), p35SBAR (24Grotewold E. Chamberlin M. Snook M. Siame B. Butler L. Swenson J. Maddock S. Clair G.S. Bowen B. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 721-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), and pUbiGUS (19Grotewold E. Drummond B.J. Bowen B. Peterson T. Cell. 1994; 76: 543-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). p35SBAR was used for normalizing the concentration of CaMV35S promoter sequences delivered in each bombardment, and the pUbiGUS was used to normalize the efficiency of each bombardment. Mutants in the MYB domain of P1 were generated by PCR from their respective E. coli protein expression vectors and, after sequencing, were used to replace the MYB domain of P1 in the p35SP1 construct by digesting it with BamHI and SnaBI. Microprojectile Bombardment and Gene Expression—Bombardment conditions of suspension maize Black Mexican Sweet cells and transient expression assays for luciferase and GUS were performed essentially as described previously (23Grotewold E. Sainz M.B. Tagliani L. Hernandez J.M. Bowen B. Chandler V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13579-13584Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Bombardments were performed in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least twice. The assays for luciferase and GUS and the normalization of the data were performed as described previously (19Grotewold E. Drummond B.J. Bowen B. Peterson T. Cell. 1994; 76: 543-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). The -fold activation results are expressed as the ratio of arbitrary light units (luciferase) to arbitrary fluorescence units (GUS) of the treatment, with the transcriptional activator divided by the ratio of arbitrary light units (luciferase) to arbitrary fluorescence units (GUS) of the reporter plasmid in the absence of the regulator. Detection of Dimers and Fluorescent Labeling of Recombinant Proteins—Detection of dimer formation was accomplished by incubating 700 ng of recombinant protein on ice for 1 h in the presence of either 10 mm DTT or 30 mm diamide. After incubation in ice, 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer without reducing agents (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 20% glycerol) was added to each sample and separated by electrophoresis on a 15% non-reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Fluorescent labeling of reduced cysteine residues was accomplished by using the thiol specific modifying agent 7-diethylamino-3-(4′-iodoacetylaminophenyl)-4-methylcoumarin (DCIA; Molecular Probes). Approximately 350 ng of recombinant protein was incubated on ice in either the presence or absence of the reducing agent tris-(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (Molecular Probes). Samples in reducing conditions (1 mm tris-(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride) were incubated on ice for 30 min. DCIA was then added to all samples to a final concentration of 1 mm and incubated on ice for additional 30 min in the dark. After incubation with DCIA, tris-(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride was added to a final concentration of 3 mm in all samples. Samples were then mixed with 2× non-reducing SDS-PAGE loading buffer and separated on a 15% non-reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After separation, fluorescent imaging of the gel was accomplished using the Bio-RAD Gel Doc 2000 Documentation system. After fluorescent analysis, the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The MYB Domain of P1 Binds DNA Only When Reduced—We have shown previously that the MYB domain of P1 binds DNA only in the presence of DTT (13Williams C.E. Grotewold E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 563-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The MYB domain of P1 used in those studies (N10His-PMYB) contained four Cys residues, two at positions six and seven before the first helix of R2, and two others at positions 49 and 53 (Fig. 1B). To investigate which Cys residues in P1MYB respond to the reducing conditions, we generated a truncated, polyhistidine-tagged version of P1MYB in which the first nine amino acids of P1 were deleted (N6His-PMYBΔ9), removing the two Cys residues located in the N-terminal extension (21Grotewold E. Athma P. Peterson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4587-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To determine whether N6His-PMYBΔ9 bound DNA in a manner similar to that of the previously described N10His-PMYB protein (13Williams C.E. Grotewold E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 563-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we tested total E. coli extracts, expressing equivalent amounts of the two proteins, by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), using the APB1 probe (Fig. 2A). APB1 corresponds to the high-affinity P1-binding sites present in the promoter of a1, one of the flavonoid biosynthetic genes regulated by P1 (19Grotewold E. Drummond B.J. Bowen B. Peterson T. Cell. 1994; 76: 543-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). N6His-PMYBΔ9 binds APB1 as effectively as N10His-PMYB (Fig. 2B), indicating that the first nine amino acids of P1 are dispensable for the DNA-binding activity of P1. The faster mobility of the N6His-PMYBΔ9-APB1 complex reflects the smaller size of N6His-PMYBΔ9, compared with N10His-PMYB. As previously shown for P1 and N10His-PMYB (13Williams C.E. Grotewold E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 563-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 19Grotewold E. Drummond B.J. Bowen B. Peterson T. Cell. 1994; 76: 543-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), N6His-PMYBΔ9 does not bind to the mutant APB5 DNA probe (Fig. 2D, lane 1) Similar to N10His-PMYB, the DNA-binding activity of N6His-PMYBΔ9 depends on the presence of DTT (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 1 and 4). These results suggest that Cys-49 and/or Cys-53 are responsible for the reducing conditions necessary for P1 to bind DNA. To determine the participation of Cys-53 in the REDOX regulation of DNA binding by P1, we replaced Cys-53 with Ala or Ser in N6His-PMYBΔ9. The corresponding proteins (C53A and C53S respectively) were expressed in E. coli, affinity-purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column and analyzed for DNA-binding activity to the APB1 probe by EMSA. In the presence of reducing conditions (1 mm DTT), wild type (WT, N6His-PMYBΔ9) and C53A bound with comparable strengths (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 2). In the presence of DTT (Fig. 2C, +DTT) the binding of C53S to APB1 was also comparable with WT (Fig. 2C, lane 3). In the absence of DTT, however (Fig. 2C, -DTT), only C53A bound APB1 (Fig. 2C, lane 5); neither the wild type nor the C53S proteins showed any significant DNA binding. To determine whether the C53A or C53S mutations affected the sequence-specific DNA-binding activity of P1 (13Williams C.E. Grotewold E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 563-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 19Grotewold E. Drummond B.J. Bowen B. Peterson T. Cell. 1994; 76: 543-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), we tested wild type and the two mutants for binding to the APB5 probe. As shown in Fig. 2D, none of these proteins bound to the mutant sites. Next, we investigated the effect that the addition of the sulfhydryl oxidizing agent diamide had on the DNA-binding activity of these proteins. The DNA-binding activity of the wild type protein (N6His-PMYBΔ9) was abolished by the presence of 3 mm diamide (Fig. 2E, lane 2). The DNA-binding activity of this protein, however, is recovered by the addition of excess DTT (Fig. 2E, lane 3). The C53A protein (Fig. 2E, lanes 4-6) was not significantly affected by the treatment with diamide. Similar to wild type, binding of C53S to APB1 was completely abolished by the presence of diamide (Fig. 2E, lane 8), yet recovered when DTT was added (Fig. 2E, lane 9). To better understand how these mutations affect the ability of the MYB domain of P1 to bind DNA, we made use of the intrinsic fluorescent properties of the five tryptophan residues present in R2R3 MYB domains (Fig. 1B). Using fluorescence spectroscopy, we compared the environments of the tryptophan residues in the wild type (WT, N6His-PMYBΔ9), C53A and C53S proteins. The fluorescence emission spectra for each of the three proteins was determined in 0 mm DTT, 1 mm DTT, and 6 m guanidinium chloride (denaturing conditions), and the wavelength of the maximum emission fluorescence was recorded (Table I). All the denatured proteins had similar emission maxima, between 357 and 359 nm, similar to the maximum of free tryptophan (360 nm) (Table I). Compared with the denatured protein, the emission maximum of the native wild type protein (in the presence of 1 mm DTT) was shifted toward the shorter wavelengths (342 nm), a shift indicative of the tryptophan residues being less exposed to the solvent, probably participating in the formation of a hydrophobic core, as proposed for c-MYB (1Kanei-Ishii C.

In the absence of DTT, the wild type protein displayed a more open conformation (Table I, 352 nm), compared with the reduced form (342 nm). C53A had a similar emission maximum in the absence of DTT as the wild type protein in reducing conditions (Table I, compare 343 nm with 342 nm). The addition of 1 mm DTT shifted the emission maximum of C53A slightly further toward the blue (Table I, 338 nm). This result is consistent with the observation that C53A binds efficiently DNA in both reducing and nonreducing conditions (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 5). In contrast, the C53S mutant had a similar emission maximum as wild type in non-reducing conditions (Table I, compare 350 nm with 352 nm). In the presence of 1 mm DTT, the maximum of C53S shifted toward the blue to 345 nm, consistent with the ability of this protein to bind DNA in reducing conditions (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 6).Table IWavelengthh of maximum fluorescence obtained from tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra of the truncated wild-type P1 MYB domain (WT, N6His-PMYBΔ9) and single cysteine mutants in the presence of either 0 mm DTT, 1 mm DT, or 6 m guanidine HClTreatmentWTC53AC53SC49AC49SC49Inm0 mm DTT3523433503423373501 mm DTT3423383453413363506 m G-HCl358357358358357357 Open table in a new tab The ability of the C53S mutant to bind DNA only in the presence of DTT suggested that Cys-53 is not the only cysteine residue involved in the REDOX-dependent DNA-binding activity of P1.

https://openalex.org/W2034089831,"It is well established that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) has a critical role in modulating adipocyte differentiation based on gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments. However, recent gain-of-function experiments suggest that PPARbeta may also have a role in mediating adipocyte differentiation. Because ligands for PPARs can activate more than one receptor isoform, the specific role of PPARbeta in adipocyte differentiation was examined using PPARbeta-null adipocytes. Wild-type adipocytes accumulate lipids in response to differentiation signaling induced from standard differentiation medium, and this effect is significantly reduced in PPARbeta-null adipocytes. The addition of the PPARbeta ligand L165041 to the standard differentiation medium causes enhanced adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation, and this effect is diminished in adipocytes lacking expression of PPARbeta. Treatment of wild-type adipocytes with the PPARgamma ligand troglitazone causes accelerated adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation, and this effect is marginally reduced in PPARbeta-null adipocytes. Expression patterns of mRNA markers of early and late adipocyte differentiation are consistent with the morphological and biochemical differences observed. Results from these studies demonstrate that in the absence of PPARbeta expression, adipocyte differentiation is significantly impaired, providing loss-of-function evidence supporting a role for this receptor in adipocyte differentiation. These results also demonstrate that L165041-stimulated adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation is mediated by PPARbeta. In addition, as the ability of troglitazone to induce adipocyte differentiation is also impaired in PPARbeta null adipocytes, this suggests that both PPARbeta and PPARgamma isoforms are required to facilitate maximal lipid accumulation and differentiation during adipogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2041976200,"Chondrocyte cell death is a hallmark of inflammatory and degenerative joint diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA), but the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved have yet to be elucidated. Because 3-nitrotyrosine, a marker for reactive nitrogen species such as peroxynitrite, has been observed in OA and RA cartilage and has been associated with chondrocyte cell death, we investigated the mechanisms by which peroxynitrite induces cell death in human articular chondrocytes. The earliest biochemical event observed, subsequent to treatment with either peroxynitrite or the peroxynitrite generator SIN-1, was a rapid rise in intracellular calcium that lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. Although, chondrocyte death exhibited several classical hallmarks of apoptosis, including annexin V labeling, increased fraction of cells with subG1 DNA content and DNA condensation, we did not find evidence for caspase involvement either by Western blotting, fluorimetric assays, or caspase inhibition. Additionally, peroxynitrite did not inhibit cellular caspase activity. Furthermore, using other established assays of cell viability, including the MTT assay and release of lactate dehydrogenase, we found that the predominant mode of cell death involved calcium-dependent cysteine proteases, otherwise known as calpains. Our data show, for the first time, that peroxynitrite induces mitochondrial dysfunction in cells via a calcium-dependent process that leads to caspase-independent apoptosis mediated by calpains."
https://openalex.org/W1978392269,"Tobacco-related lung diseases are associated with alterations in tissue remodeling and are characterized by increased matrix deposition. Among the matrix molecules found to be highly expressed in tobacco-related lung diseases is fibronectin, a cell adhesive glycoprotein implicated in tissue injury and repair. We hypothesize that nicotine, a component of tobacco, stimulates the expression of fibronectin in lung fibroblasts via the activation of intracellular signals that lead to increased fibronectin gene transcription. In support of this, we found that nicotine stimulated the expression of fibronectin in lung fibroblasts and that its stimulatory effect was associated with activation of protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein kinases, increased levels of intracellular cAMP, and phosphorylation and DNA binding of the transcription factor CREB. Increased transcription of the gene was dependent on cAMP-response elements (CREs) present on the 5' end of its gene promoter. The stimulatory effect of nicotine on fibronectin expression was abolished by alpha-bungarotoxin, an inhibitor of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (alpha7 AChRs). Of note, nicotine increased the expression of alpha7 nAChRs on fibroblasts. Our data suggest that nicotine induces lung fibroblasts to produce fibronectin by stimulating alpha7 nAChR-dependent signals that regulate the transcription of the fibronectin gene."

Renal tissue from patients with acute renal failure displayed strong induction of ORP150 in tubular epithelium. In a rodent model of renal I/R injury, ORP150 was expressed in both the ischemic and contralateral kidney, principally in the thick ascending loop of Henle (TAL) and distal tubules. Cultured renal epithelial cells exposed to hypoxic or hyperosmotic conditions displayed induction of ORP150. Renal tubular epithelial cells stably transfected with ORP150 sense or antisense cDNA displayed a strong correlation between ORP150 expression and vulnerability to hypoxic/osmotic stress; higher levels of ORP150 were protective, whereas lower levels increased susceptibility to cell death. Compared with nontransgenic controls, transgenic mice overexpressing ORP150 subjected to renal I/R displayed a blunted rise of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, and enhanced survival of TAL, consistent with cytoprotection. In contrast, heterozygous ORP150+/- mice, with lower levels of ORP150, showed enhanced renal injury. These data are consistent with the possibility that ORP150 exerts cytoprotective effects in renal tubular epithelia subjected to I/R injury and suggest a key role for ER stress in the renal tubular response to acute renal failure."
https://openalex.org/W2018290030,"A novel 11 kDa antimicrobial protein, named as hebraein, and having a unique amino acid sequence, was purified from the hemolymph of fed female Amblyomma hebraeum ticks. A full-length cDNA clone encoding hebraein was isolated from a cDNA library made from tick synganglia. Hebraein consists of 102 amino acids, including 6 cysteine residues; has 9 histidines in its C-terminal domain that are mainly present as HX repeats; and has no significant similarity to any known protein. The secondary structure prediction is very clearly all alpha-helical (4-6 helices) except for a very short extension at the C terminus. Such high alpha-helical content is quite different from known antimicrobial proteins. Recombinant hebraein and a mutant lacking the histidine residues in the C-terminal domain were constructed and expressed. Assayed at the slightly acidic pH equivalent of fed female tick hemolymph, the wild-type and the histidine-rich recombinant hebraein had stronger antimicrobial activities than the histidine-deficient mutant. The pH-dependent properties of histidine-rich antimicrobial proteins may allow the design of agents that would function selectively in specific pH environments. The results from protein profiling of hemolymph, analyzed by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectrometry combined with ProteinChip technology and RT-PCR analysis suggested that this antimicrobial protein was up-regulated by blood feeding. Our findings describe a new type of antimicrobial protein with multiple cysteine and histidine residues, and with unique secondary structure."

https://openalex.org/W2037367036,"The accessory HIV-1 Nef protein is a crucial determinant for viral replication and pathogenesis. During HIV infection, loss of immune control in the setting of a strong and broad HIV-specific T-lymphocyte response, leads to a lethal outcome through AIDS. Moreover, dysfunction of dendritic cells (DCs) may contribute to the immune suppression associated with AIDS progression. We recently demonstrated that exogenous Nef selectively activates immature DCs manipulating their phenotypical, morphological, and functional developmental program. Here, we tracked whether Nef, targeting DCs, could be involved in the dysregulation of CD8+ T cell responses. We found that Nef inhibits the capacity of DCs to prime alloreactive CD8+ T cell responses down-regulating their proliferation and functional competence. This coincides with the induction of CD8+ T cell apoptosis. Nef oversees apoptotic killing of CD8+ T cells up-regulating TNF-alpha and FasL production by DCs and interfering with the death receptor pathway in CD8+ T cells and thus activating caspase 8. Our findings suggest that Nef may contribute to the immune evasion associated with HIV-1 infection, subverting DC biology. This may help explain the pleiotropic function that Nef plays during infection and makes this protein an attractive target for preventive and therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W1992804002,"The changing boundaries of a stream flowing at a constant rate are explained. A jet of fluid flowing down a partially wetting, inclined plane usually meanders but — by maintaining a constant flow rate — meandering can be suppressed, leading to the emergence of a beautiful braided structure. Here we show that this flow pattern can be explained by the interplay between surface tension, which tends to narrow the jet, and fluid inertia, which drives the jet to widen. These observations dispel misconceptions about the relationship between braiding and meandering that have persisted for over 20 years."
https://openalex.org/W1986197801,"TraR, a quorum-sensing activator, induces transcription from its binding site, the tra-box, located upstream of Ti plasmid target promoters. TraR activated expression of a lacZ reporter in Escherichia coli only when RpoAAt from Agrobacterium tumefaciens was co-expressed. As assessed by gel retardation assays RpoAAt, but not RpoAEc, formed a ternary complex with TraR and a tra-box probe in vitro. TraR formed similar ternary complexes with αCTDAt but not with αNTDAt, the C- and N-terminal segments of RpoAAt. As measured by surface plasmon resonance refractometry, TraR interacted directly with RpoAAt with an affinity about five times greater than that observed for its interaction with RpoAEc. The activator interacted with αCTDAt with kinetics and affinities similar to those of the full-sized α-subunit. Positive control (PC) mutations at Asp-10 and Gly-123 of TraR did not affect DNA binding but greatly decreased the TraR-RpoAAt interaction. These two residues combine to form two patches on the activator, one of which may be involved in interaction with RpoA. When co-expressed, mutants of TraR with substitutions at Asp-10 complementing mutants with substitutions at Gly-123 for gene activation in an allele-specific manner. Co-expression studies with TraR and its PC mutants, and also with complementary PC alleles of TraR, coupled with three-dimensional structure are consistent with a hypothesis that both Asp-10/Gly-123 patches are required for activator function.

The acyl-HSLs are produced by the bacteria themselves, and the cells gauge their population size by sensing the accumulation of these signals in the environment in which they are growing (11Fuqua C.F.

However, other members of the family, including CarR and EsaR, multimerize and bind DNA even in the absence of their acyl-HSL signals (17Welch M. Todd D.E. Whitehead N.A. McGowan S.J. Bycroft B.W.

Although much is known about the regulatory circuits controlled by quorum sensing, less is known about the mechanisms by which these activators initiate transcription. Purified homodimers of TraR and LuxR bind target promoters containing appropriate binding sites and, with RNA polymerase (RNAP), activate transcription in vitro (16Urbanowski M.L. Lostroh C.P. Greenberg E.P. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 19Zhu J. Winans S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4832-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). According to the crystal structure of TraR, each protomer of the dimeric activator is composed of two domains joined by a 12-residue flexible linker (20Vannini A. Volpari C. Gargioli C. Muraglia E. Cortese R. De Francesco R. Neddermann P. Di Marco S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4393-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 21Zhang R.-G. Pappas T. Brace J.L. Miller P.C. Oulmassov T. Molyneaux J.M.

The N-terminal 162 residue segment contains the signal binding site and the primary dimerization domain, whereas the C-terminal 60-residue segment contains secondary dimerization regions and a helix-turn-helix domain, one helix of which makes contacts with specific nucleotides in a tra-box half-site (14Luo Z.-Q.

Genetic, physiological, and biochemical data suggest that LuxR is an ambidextrous activator and, as such, interacts with the α-subunit (22Stevens A.M. Dolan K.M. Greenberg E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12619-12623Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 23Stevens A.M. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Greenberg E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4704-4707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Finney A.H. Blick R.J. Murakami K. Ishihama A. Stevens A.M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4520-4528Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and σ70 (25Johnson D. Ishihama A. Stevens A.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 228: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) of Escherichia coli RNAP holoenzyme. Given its dimeric structure and the location of the tra-box recognition site within target promoters, TraR also likely makes contacts with one or more components of RNAP. Consistent with this hypothesis, alterations at two residues of TraR, Asp-10 and Gly-123, yield a strong positive control (PC) phenotype; both mutant proteins retain tra-box binding activity as measured by a genetic assay but fail to activate transcription (5Luo Z.-Q. Farrand S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9009-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Asp-10 and Gly-123 both are located N-terminally to the linker region of the protein. Moreover, because of the asymmetric alignment and the folding patterns of the N-terminal regions of the two protomers, Asp-10 of one subunit combines with Gly-123 of the other to form two composite surface patches (Fig. 1). One such patch is close to the bound DNA, whereas the other is located at the opposite extremity of the dimer. Either or both of these patches could make contact with one or more components of RNAP. Although TraR binds to the tra-box in E. coli, it does not activate transcription in the enteric host. VirG, another Ti plasmid-encoded activator, shows a similar defect but will activate a VirG-dependent promoter in E. coli when co-expressed with rpoA from A. tumefaciens (rpoAAt) (26Lohrke S.M. Nechaev S. Yang H. Severninov K. Jin S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4533-4539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Lohrke S.M. Yang H. Jin S. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3704-3711Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that VirG does not properly interact with RNAP containing the enteric form of RpoA (RpoAEc). In this report we show that when co-expressed with RpoAAt, TraR will activate expression from a tra-box promoter in E. coli. We also show that TraR interacts with RpoAAtin vitro through the C-terminal domain of the α-subunit. The Asp-10 or Gly-123 PC mutants bind DNA in vitro but do not interact with the α-subunit. In vivo activation was restored by co-expressing certain alleles of TraR containing different substitutions at the Asp-10 and Gly-123 positions in the same cell. However, activation could not be rescued by co-expressing wild-type TraR with any of these mutants or by expressing an allele of TraR containing otherwise complementing substitutions at both locations. Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions—A. tumefaciens strain NTL4 (28Luo Z.-Q. Clemente T.E. Farrand S.K. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2001; 14: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), a Ti plasmid-cured derivative of the nopaline/agrocinopine-type strain C58, was used in all studies. E. coli strain DH5α was used as the host in all cloning experiments, as well as in assays of gene expression, and E. coli strains BL21(DE3)(pLysS) and SG13009 (26Lohrke S.M. Nechaev S. Yang H. Severninov K. Jin S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4533-4539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used for expressing proteins prior to purification. E. coli strains were grown in LB liquid medium, and A. tumefaciens was grown in LB or in MG/L (29Cangelosi G.A. Best E.A. Martinetti C. Nester E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 145: 177-181Google Scholar) liquid medium. For studies involving defined media, A. tumefaciens was grown in AB minimal medium containing mannitol as sole source of carbon (ABM; Ref. 30Chilton M.-D. Currier T.C. Farrand S.K. Bendich A.J. Gordon M.P. Nester E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1999; 96: 9009-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cultures of A. tumefaciens were grown at 28 °C, and E. coli was grown at 28 or at 37 °C. All cultures in liquid medium were grown with shaking to ensure adequate aeration. Antibiotics, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) and IPTG were included in medium at concentrations described previously (6Farrand S.K. Hwang I. Cook D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4233-4247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). N-(3-Oxo-octanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C8-HSL; AAI), synthesized as described previously (31Shaw P.D. Gao P. Daly S.L. Cha C. Cronan Jr., J. Rinehart K.L. Farrand S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6036-6041Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), was added to cultures at the concentrations indicated in the text. Plasmid Isolation and Genetic Methods—Plasmids were isolated by miniprep techniques (6Farrand S.K. Hwang I. Cook D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4233-4247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and introduced into A. tumefaciens and E. coli strains by electroporation (29Cangelosi G.A. Best E.A. Martinetti C. Nester E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 145: 177-181Google Scholar) or by biparental matings using E. coli strain S17-1 (6Farrand S.K. Hwang I. Cook D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4233-4247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid Constructions—Plasmids that express RpoA of Agrobacterium (RpoAAt) were constructed as follows. The rpoAAt gene was amplified by PCR from pPS1.3 (26Lohrke S.M. Nechaev S. Yang H. Severninov K. Jin S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4533-4539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amplicons were cloned into pZLQ (5Luo Z.-Q. Farrand S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9009-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) to produce pZLQRpoA, which expresses wild-type protein, and into pET14b to produce pET14RpoA, which expresses an N-terminal His6-tagged version of RpoAAt. Plasmid pKKTR2-I41 was constructed by cloning HindIII fragment 4 of pTiC58 containing the TraR-dependent traG::lacZ reporter fusion from pH4I41 (32Hwang I. Cook D.M. Farrand S.K. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 449-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into the HindIII site of pKKTR2-I, which contains the traR gene under control of the trc promoter and lacIq (33Luo Z.-Q. Qin Y. Farrand S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7113-7122Google Scholar). This plasmid and pH4I41 were used to monitor activation by TraR and its mutants in E. coli and A. tumefaciens hosts. The repression reporter pPBL1 was used to genetically monitor the DNA binding properties of TraR and its mutants as described previously (5Luo Z.-Q. Farrand S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9009-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Plasmid pQKK was constructed by replacing the HindIII-EcoRI region of the polylinker of pKK38 (34Oger P. Kim K.-S. Sackett R.L. Piper K.R. Farrand S.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) with the HindIII-EcoRI polylinker fragment from pUC18. This substitution removed the trc promoter from pKK38 and yielded a vector that lacks a promoter upstream of the polylinker. Wild-type traR or its single amino acid substitution mutants were amplified by PCR from pZLQ derivatives containing the appropriate genes. The amplicons, which included the upstream trc promoter of pZLQ, were cloned as SacI fragments into the pQKK polylinker. The traG::lacZ reporter was transferred from pH4I41 as a HindIII fragment into the pQKK-traR derivatives yielding plasmids that express traR or its mutants and also a TraR-dependent reporter fusion. Nucleotides encoding the N-terminal (residues 1–166) and C-terminal (residues 167–336) segments of RpoAAt were produced as fragments generated by PCR using Pfu polymerase and pZLQRpoA as template. The N-terminal end of each fragment was constructed to contain an NdeI site. The coding regions were cloned as NdeI-EcoRI fragments into pZLQ and pET14b to generate pZLQRpoAN (αNTD), pZLQRpoAC (αCTD), pET14RpoAC (His6-αCTD), and pET14RpoAN (His6-αNTD). Clonings at the pZLQ NdeI site generated an ATG initiation codon that is properly spaced with respect to the vector transcriptional and translational signals to ensure high levels of expression of the protein. Mutagenesis—Site-specific mutations were introduced into the traR gene using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene), and the resulting DNA samples were transformed into E. coli. Plasmid DNA samples from randomly chosen isolates were subjected to DNA sequence analysis, a representative containing the desired substitution mutation was retained, and the fragment bearing the mutant allele was recloned into the appropriate expression vector. The complete double-stranded sequence was determined for all mutant clones using automated methods by the Keck Center for Biotechnology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Western Analyses—The stability and expression levels of mutant TraR proteins in vivo were determined by Western analysis using anti-TraR antiserum as described previously (12Qin Y. Luo Z.-Q. Smyth A.J. Gao P. Beck von Bodman S. Farrand S.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5212-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Overexpression and Purification of Proteins—His-tagged RpoAAt, as well as His-tagged forms of αCTDAt and αNTDAt were over-expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)(pLysS) as described previously (12Qin Y. Luo Z.-Q. Smyth A.J. Gao P. Beck von Bodman S. Farrand S.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5212-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). N-terminal His6-RpoAEc from E. coli was over-expressed from E. coli strain SG13009(pREP4) as described by Lohrke et al. (26Lohrke S.M. Nechaev S. Yang H. Severninov K. Jin S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4533-4539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The His-tagged forms of RpoAAt and RpoAEc remained soluble in cell extracts and were purified under nondenaturing conditions. The two subfragments of RpoAAt were insoluble and were solubilized by treatment with 6 m urea. In both cases the proteins were purified by Nickel affinity chromatography using a 6-mm (id) × 16 cm column as described by the manufacturer (Novagen). Following purification, His6-αCTDAt and His6-αNTDAt were renatured by gradual removal of the urea using the protocol described by Novagen. Dimer forms of wild-type TraR and its PC mutants TraRD10N and TraRG123R were over-expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)(pLysS) grown with 3-oxo-C8-HSL and purified as described previously (12Qin Y. Luo Z.-Q. Smyth A.J. Gao P. Beck von Bodman S. Farrand S.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5212-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). As assessed by SDS-PAGE all proteins were more than 95% pure. All proteins were stored at -20 °C in TEDNG50 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.15 m NaCl, 50% glycerol). Protein concentrations were determined using the Coomassie Plus protein assay kit (Pierce). Gel Retardation Assays—Gel retardation assays were performed as described by Luo et al. (33Luo Z.-Q. Qin Y. Farrand S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7113-7122Google Scholar). A 251-bp probe containing the entire TraR-dependent divergent tra promoter system from pTiC58 (6Farrand S.K. Hwang I. Cook D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4233-4247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was prepared by PCR amplification using pH4I41 as the template. The probe was labeled at its 3′-ends with digoxigenin-11-dideoxyUTP using terminal transferase according to protocols provided by the supplier (Roche Applied Science). The concentrations of TraR as well as the two His-tagged RpoA proteins or the His-tagged N- and C-terminal fragments of RpoAAt used in the reactions are described in the text or in the appropriate figure legends. Surface Plasmon Resonance Refractometry—Surface plasmon resonance sensograms were determined using a Biacore 3000 optical biosensor. Reactions were conducted at 25 °C at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. Eluent buffer (EB) contained 10 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 50 μm EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20, pH 7.4. Nickel buffer (NB) contained 500 μm NiCl2 in EB. Regeneration buffer (RB) contained 10 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.35 m EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20, pH 8.3. N-terminal His-tagged preparations of RpoAAt, RpoAEc, or the αCTDAt fragment, each exhaustively dialyzed against EB, were immobilized on flow cell 2 of a two-cell nitrilotriacetic acid sensor chip (NTA, Biacore) in which both cells had been saturated with NB. Normally, such a loaded chip yields a sensogram with a resonance response of about 1600 units for full-sized RpoA from either bacterium or 800 units for αCTDAt. To avoid nonspecific binding of TraR in the mobile phase to the nickel-charged chip surface following immobilization of the RpoA ligand on flow cell 2, uncomplexed binding sites on both cells of the chip were blocked by exposure to 900 μl of a 2 μm solution of His-tagged αNTDAt. Gel retardation studies had shown that this fragment of RpoAAt does not significantly interact with TraR (see “Results”). Interaction experiments were initiated by injecting a preparation of purified native TraR or one of its substitution mutants in EB at concentrations as noted under “Results” into the buffer stream of both flow cells 1 and 2. Buffer flow was continued, and sensograms were recorded for a period up to 15 min, allowing analysis of association and disassociation reactions. The reference sensor signal from flow cell 1 was used to correct by subtraction the experimental binding data observed in the reaction occurring in flow cell 2. Following completion, chips were regenerated by injecting the following solutions in succession into the buffer stream: two 10-μl volumes of 0.3 m imidazole, two 10-μl volumes of RB, and a single 10-μl volume of 0.3% SDS. Both flow cells of the chip were then saturated with NB in preparation for the next run. Values for kinetic parameters including the association rate constant, ka, and the disassociation rate constant, kd, were determined using the BIAevaluation 3.1 program (Biacore). The data exhibited best fit using the simple 1:1 Langmuir binding model available in the program. Deviations between experimental and fitted data normally were less than ± 2 resonance units. β-Galactosidase Assays—β-Galactosidase activity, expressed as units/109 colony-forming units (cfu), was quantified as described previously (6Farrand S.K. Hwang I. Cook D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4233-4247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Assays were performed in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least twice. TraR Requires Agrobacterium RpoA to Initiate Transcription in E. coli—In E. coli TraR binds to the tra-box sequence but does not initiate transcription from a native TraR-dependent promoter (5Luo Z.-Q. Farrand S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9009-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, TraR strongly activates transcription of the same promoter in A. tumefaciens. Moreover, purified TraR, when combined with RNAP from A. tumefaciens, activates transcription from tra-box promoters in vitro (19Zhu J. Winans S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4832-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that TraR cannot form an activation complex with enteric RNAP. Given that some activators interact with the α-subunit of RNAP (reviewed in Ref. 35Busby R. Ebright R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar), we tested whether expression of rpoAAt would restore the activator function to TraR in an E. coli host. As expected, TraR failed to activate the traG::lacZ reporter in E. coli DH5α (Table I). However, when rpoAAt was co-expressed with traR, the reporter was induced 6-fold in the enteric host (Table I), and activation was dependent upon growth of the culture in medium containing 3-oxo-C8-HSL (Table I).Table ITraR-mediated activation of transcription in E. coli requires RpoA from A. tumefaciens All constructs were expressed in E. coli strain DH5α grown in A medium containing glucose and IPTG as described under “Experimental Procedures.”ActivatoratraR was expressed from pKKTR2-I41, which also codes for the traG::lacZ reporterCo-expressed α-subunitbrpoA from A. tumefaciens and from E. coli, as well as the NTD and CTD fragments of RpoAAt, were expressed from derivatives of pZLQ constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures”β-Galactosidase activitycExpressed as units of β-galactosidase activity/109 cfu as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The strains were assayed three times, and results from a representative experiment are shown-Fold inductioneCalculated as [+AAI] - [AAI]/[-AAI]-AAI+AAIdAgrobacterium autoinducer, AAI (3-oxo-C8-HSL), was added to cultures at a concentration of 25 nm at the beginning of growthNoneNone23<1NoneRpoAAt23<1TraRNone23<1TraRRpoAAt3216TraRαNTDAt23<1TraRαCTDAt23<1a traR was expressed from pKKTR2-I41, which also codes for the traG::lacZ reporterb rpoA from A. tumefaciens and from E. coli, as well as the NTD and CTD fragments of RpoAAt, were expressed from derivatives of pZLQ constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures”c Expressed as units of β-galactosidase activity/109 cfu as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The strains were assayed three times, and results from a representative experiment are shownd Agrobacterium autoinducer, AAI (3-oxo-C8-HSL), was added to cultures at a concentration of 25 nm at the beginning of growthe Calculated as [+AAI] - [AAI]/[-AAI] Open table in a new tab TraR and RpoA Form a Complex With the tra-Box Promoter Region—We determined whether RpoAAt and RpoAEc, its ortholog from E. coli, could interact with the TraR-promoter DNA complex using gel retardation assays. Purified TraR formed detectable complexes when mixed with a 251-bp fragment containing the tra-box and all of the cis-acting promoter elements located in the intergenic region between the traAFB and traCDG operons from pTiC58 (Fig. 2, A and B). On its own, purified N-terminal His6-RpoA from either bacterium did not detectably bind to the DNA probe (Fig. 2, B and C). However, although the addition of His6-RpoAEc to the mixture of TraR and probe DNA had no effect on the mobility of the TraR-DNA complex (Fig. 2C), the addition of His6-RpoAAt yielded a new, slower migrating complex, with the intensity of the new band increasing with increasing amounts of the α-subunit (Fig. 2B). We take this to mean that RpoAAt, but not the α-subunit from E. coli, interacts with the TraR-promoter complex to form a ternary structure. TraR Interacts Directly with RpoA from Agrobacterium—We used surface plasmon resonance refractometry (SPRR) to assess whether TraR can bind RpoA in the absence of DNA. The sensograms clearly indicated that TraR in the mobile phase interacted with His6-RpoA subunits from both A. tumefaciens and E. coli (Fig. 3, A and B). However, the association rate constant, ka, for the interaction between TraR and His6-RpoAAt was almost 4-fold greater than that calculated for the interaction between TraR and His6-RpoAEc (Table II). Following completion of the binding reaction, the sensograms indicated that both TraR-RpoA complexes dissociated at a slow but measurable rate (Fig. 3, A and B). Moreover, the dissociation rate constants, kd, for the two TraR-RpoA complexes were not significantly different (Table II).Table IIKinetic constants for the interaction of TraR with RpoA and its αCTD fragmentSource of RpoAAssociation rate (ka)aCalculated from the SPRR sensograms shown in Figs. 3 and 4B using BIAevaluation version 3.1 as described under “Experimental Procedures”Dissociation rate (kd)aCalculated from the SPRR sensog"
