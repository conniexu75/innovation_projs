https://openalex.org/W1597997684,"The proteins associated with liposomes in the circulation of mice were analyzed in order to determine whether bound proteins significantly influence the fate of liposomes in vivo. Liposomes were administered intravenously via the dorsal tail vein of CD1 mice and were isolated from blood after 2 min in the absence of coagulation inhibitors using a rapid spin column procedure. Various negatively charged liposomes exhibiting markedly different clearance properties were studied; notably, these included liposomes containing 10 mol % ganglioside GM1 which has been previously shown to effectively limit liposomal uptake by the fixed macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system. The protein binding ability (PB; g of protein/mol of lipid) of the liposomes was quantitated and related to the circulation half-life (tau 1/2) of the liposomes. Liposomes having similar membrane surface charge imparted by different anionic phospholipids were found to exhibit markedly different protein binding potentials. Furthermore, PB values determined from the in vivo experiments were found to be inversely related to circulation half-lives. PB values in excess of 50 g of protein/mol of lipid were observed for rapidly cleared liposomes such as those containing cardiolipin or phosphatidic acid (tau 1/2 less than 2 min). PB values for ganglioside GM1-containing liposomes (tau 1/2 greater than 2 h) were significantly less (PB less than 15 g of total protein/mol of total lipid). PB values were also determined for liposomes recovered from in vitro incubations with isolated human serum; relative PB values obtained from these in vitro experiments were in agreement with relative PB values measured from in vivo experiments. PB values, therefore, could be a useful parameter for predicting the clearance behavior of liposomes in the circulation. Liposomes exhibiting increased PB values in vivo were shown by immunoblot analysis to bind more immune opsonins, leading to a higher probability of phagocytic uptake. Finally, based on results obtained using the in vitro system, it is suggested that the mechanism by which ganglioside GM1 prolongs the murine circulation half-life of liposomes is by reducing the total amount of blood protein bound to the liposomes in a relatively nonspecific manner."
https://openalex.org/W1535481983,"Complement components C3 and C5 are susceptible to limited proteolysis by an arginine-specific cysteine proteinase isolated from Porphyromonas gingivalis. This bacterium is an anaerobe commonly associated with severe periodontal disease. Infection by P. gingivalis is accompanied by an acute inflammatory response, complete with extensive neutrophil involvement. This prompted us to investigate a possible direct role for complement in periodontitis evoked by P. gingivalis. Exposure of C3 and C5 to the cysteine proteinase at molar ratios between 1:25 and 1:100 (enzyme to substrate ratios) resulted in a time-dependent, limited degradation of each component. C3 was converted in a stepwise manner to C3a-like and C3b-like fragments with evidence of extensive further degradation of the C3a-like portion of the molecule. We were unable to demonstrate C3a activity in the C3 digestion mixtures. C3 degradation appears to involve primarily the alpha-chain. Proteolysis of C5 also progresses in a stepwise manner producing an initial internal cleavage of the alpha-chain to generate 30- and 86-kDa fragments. Further digestion of the 86-kDa amino-terminal fragment of the alpha-chain leads to the release of C5a or a C5a-like fragment that is biologically active for neutrophil activation. The fact that a potent chemotactic factor, i.e. C5a, can be generated from C5 by a proteinase derived from P. gingivalis suggests a recruiting mechanism for attracting neutrophils to the gingival lesion site in periodontal disease."
https://openalex.org/W2102117283,"Porphyromonas gingivalis, a Gram-negative anaerobic rod, has been closely associated with the initiation and progression of periodontal disease. This organism has been shown to produce a large number of proteolytic enzymes which can degrade a variety of tissue proteins, and these are considered to be major virulence factors. One of the proteinases produced by this organism, referred to as gingipain-1, has been purified to homogeneity from P. gingivalis culture medium by a combination of gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography. The enzyme was found to have a molecular mass near 50 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a pH optimum in the neutral to alkaline range, and a requirement for cysteine for activation and Ca2+ for stabilization. Amino-terminal sequence analysis indicated that gingipain belongs to a new, so far unknown, subfamily of cysteine proteinases. Three unusual features of this proteinase are: (a) the stimulation of amidolytic activity by glycine-containing dipeptides; (b) a narrow specificity which is limited to peptide bonds containing arginine residues; and (c) resistance to inhibition by proteinase inhibitors in human plasma."
https://openalex.org/W1834695457,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae YDJ1 protein (YDJ1p) contains a C-terminal motif common to proteins that are modified by prenylation. In the present study we show that YDJ1p is a specific substrate for both yeast and mammalian protein farnesyltransferase enzymes in vitro. A mutant form of YDJ1p, in which the conserved cysteine of the CaaX box is mutated to a serine (ydj1-S406p), cannot be farnesylated in vitro. After expression in S. cerevisiae, ydj1-S406p displays a reduced electrophoretic mobility and an increased cytosolic localization in subcellular fractionation experiments when compared to wild type YDJ1p. Expression of ydj1-S406 in cells lacking YDJ1 results in a temperature-sensitive growth phenotype in S. cerevisiae. These data indicate that farnesylation of YDJ1p is required for its function at elevated temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W1654890776,"We identified nine VAM genes (for vacuolar morphology) by genetic analyses on mutants with defective vacuolar morphologies and assembly in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The nine VAM genes were classified into two classes according to the mutant phenotypes. The class I vam mutants (vam1, vam5, vam8, and vam9) show a few small vesicles that are stained with histochemical markers for the vacuolar compartment. They also have defects in the maturation of vacuolar marker proteins, and their growth is hypersensitive to high concentrations of CaCl2 or a temperature of 37 degrees C. There are apparent genetic overlaps among the class I vam mutations and other mutations including cls, end, pep, and vps, which have been shown to be involved in the expression of the vacuolar functions. The class II vam mutants (vam2, vam3, vam4, vam6, and vam7) contain numerous small vesicles stained with the vacuolar histochemical markers and mature forms of the vacuolar proteins and do not show any apparent growth defects in the presence of CaCl2 or at 37 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W1490235403,"Several small, acid-soluble, basic peptides with anti-microbial properties have been isolated from maize (inbred B73) kernels. One of these peptides (MBP-1) has been purified to homogeneity and characterized. The peptide has a molecular weight of 4127.08 as determined by plasma desorption mass spectroscopy, has no free cysteines, and is predominantly alpha-helical as determined by circular dichroism. The primary sequence of the peptide (33 residues) has been determined by Edman degradation and shows no homology to the thionins, a group of cysteine-rich peptides found in some cereals including wheat, barley, and sorghum, as well as several dicot species. Like the thionins, however, MBP-1 has been found to have antimicrobial properties in vitro. MBP-1 inhibits spore germination or hyphal elongation of several plant pathogenic fungi, including two seed pathogens of maize (Fusarium moniliforme Sheld. and Fusarium graminearum (Gibberella zeae (Schw.) Petsch)), and several bacteria, including a bacterial pathogen of maize (Clavibacter michiganense ssp. nebraskense). A synthetic MBP-1 peptide, air-oxidized and purified by reverse phase chromatography, was equally antifungal as compared with the naturally occurring peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1531738684,"Entactin is a glycoprotein found in basement membranes in complex with laminin, and purified entactin can promote the attachment and spreading of cells. We report here the isolation and identification of the plasma membrane receptor for entactin from PC-3 human prostate carcinoma cells which attach and spread on entactin. The receptor was isolated by affinity chromatography on mouse recombinant entactin-Sepharose of 125I surface-labeled octyl glucoside cell extracts. The receptor, which consisted of two polypeptides of relative molecular masses of 150 and 116 kDa, bound to the entactin-Sepharose matrix in the presence of CaCl2, MgCl2, and MnCl2, and was eluted with EDTA, but not with Arg-Gly-Asp-containing peptides. Utilizing anti-integrin antibodies, the heterodimeric receptor was identified as the integrin alpha 3 beta 1. Purified alpha 3 beta 1 bound to entactin Sepharose in a divalent cation-dependent manner and liposomes prepared with fractions eluted from the entactin-Sepharose matrix, as well as purified alpha 3 beta 1 also bound to entactin. Liposomes prepared with other integrins such as alpha 2 beta 1 did not bind to entactin. Antibody inhibition assays demonstrated that an anti-alpha 3 antibody (P1B5) inhibited the attachment of PC-3 cells to entactin whereas this antibody did not inhibit the attachment of these cells to laminin. Attachment to laminin was, however, blocked by anti-alpha 6 antibody (G0H3). These data demonstrate that the cell surface receptor for entactin on these prostate carcinoma cells is the integrin alpha 3 beta 1 and that these cells utilize alpha 6 beta 1 as the receptor for laminin."
https://openalex.org/W1538099673,"Bile acids are selectively taken up from portal blood into the liver by specific transport systems in the hepatocyte plasma membrane. Therefore, studies were performed to evaluate the potential of bile acids as shuttles to deliver drugs specifically to the liver. The alkylating cytostatic drug chlorambucil and the fluorescent prolyl-4-hydroxylase inhibitor 4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-beta-Ala-Phe-5-oxaproline-Gly were covalently linked via an amide bond to 7 alpha, 12 alpha,-dihydroxy-3 beta- (omega-aminoalkoxy)-5-beta-cholan-24-oic acid. The chlorambucil-bile acid conjugates S 2521, S 2539, S 2567, and S 2576 inhibited Na(+)-dependent [3H]taurocholate uptake in a concentration-dependent manner both into isolated rat hepatocytes and rabbit ileal brush border membrane vesicles, whereas the parent drug chlorambucil showed no significant inhibitory effect. The chlorambucil-bile acid conjugates were able to prevent photoaffinity labeling of bile acid binding proteins in rat hepatocytes by the photolabile [3H]7,7-azo derivative of taurocholic acid indicating their bile acid character. The chlorambucil-bile acid conjugate S 2577 was able to alkylate proteins demonstrating the drug character conserved in the hybrid-molecules. Liver perfusion experiments revealed a secretion profile of the chlorambucil-bile acid conjugate S 2576 into bile very similar to taurocholate compared to chlorambucil which is predominantly excreted by the kidney. 4-Nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-beta-Ala-Phe-5-oxaproline-Gly- t-butylester (S 4404), a fluorescent peptide inhibitor of prolyl-4-hydroxylase, was not transported in intact form from portal blood into bile in contrast to its bile acid conjugate S 3744; about 25% of the peptide-bile acid conjugate S 3744 was secreted in intact form into bile within 40 min compared with less than 4% of the parent oxaprolylpeptide S 4404. In conclusion, these studies reveal that modified bile acid molecules can be used as Trojan horses to deliver a drug molecule specifically into the liver and the biliary system. This offers important pharmacological options for the development of liver-specific drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1615731206,"The platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX complex is a major site of attachment of the platelet membrane skeleton to the plasma membrane. This association is mediated by the interaction of actin-binding protein with the GP Ib-IX complex. The aim of the present work was to identify domains on the GP Ib-IX complex that interact with actin-binding protein. Synthetic peptides corresponding to sequences of the GP Ib alpha-chain and beta-chain cytoplasmic domains were analyzed for their ability to bind to purified actin-binding protein. Two overlapping peptides encompassing a sequence (Thr-536-Phe-568) from the central region of the cytoplasmic domain of GP Ib alpha were the most effective in binding 125I-actin-binding protein, as assessed by a microtiter well approach and peptide affinity chromatography. One of the active peptides (Thr-536-Leu-554) was chosen to evaluate the likelihood that the central region of the cytoplasmic domain of GP Ib alpha is involved in binding of the intact complex to actin-binding protein. This peptide could be specifically cross-linked to purified actin-binding protein in solution. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against this peptide inhibited the binding of purified actin-binding protein to the purified GP Ib-IX complex. Finally, as in intact platelets, the calpain-induced hydrolytic fragments of purified actin-binding protein (M(r) = 200,000 and M(r) = 91,000) showed little binding to the GP Ib alpha peptide. Taken together, these results provided evidence that a region between Thr-536 and Phe-568 of the cytoplasmic domain of GP Ib alpha participates in the interaction of the GP Ib-IX complex with actin-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1565450768,"Assembly of holophytochrome in the plant cell requires covalent attachment of the linear tetrapyrrole chromophore precursor, phytochromobilin, to a unique cysteine in the nascent apoprotein. In this investigation we compare chromophore analogs with the natural chromophore precursor for their ability to attach covalently to recombinant oat apophytochrome and to form photoactive holoproteins. Ethylidene-containing analogs readily form covalent adducts with apophytochrome, whereas chromophores lacking this double bond are poor substrates for attachment. Kinetic measurements establish that although the chromophore binding site on apophytochrome is best tailored to phytochromobilin, apophytochrome will accommodate the two analogs with modified D-rings, phycocyanobilin and phycoerythrobilin. The phycocyanobilin-apophytochrome adduct is photoactive and undergoes a light-induced protein conformational change similar to the native holoprotein. By contrast, the phycoerythrobilin adduct is locked into a photochemically inactive protein conformation that is similar to the red light-absorbing Pr form of phytochrome. These results support the hypothesis that the photoconversion from Pr to Pfr, the far red light- absorbing form of phytochrome, involves the photoisomerization of the C15 double bond. Knowledge gained from these studies provides impetus for rational design of chromophore analogs whose insertion into apophytochrome should elicit profound changes in light-mediated plant growth and development."
https://openalex.org/W1545156624,"The complete primary structure of the general form of human beta-spectrin (beta G) has been deduced from cDNAs isolated from human brain. beta G-Spectrin is encoded by a gene located on human chromosome 2. beta G-Spectrin and erythrocyte beta-spectrin (beta R) share identical domain organization, with sequence identity of 60% and sequence similarity of 77%. beta-Spectrins have closely related N-terminal domains implicated in binding to actin, and 17 copies of a 106-residue repeat motif with consensus residues that are highly conserved between beta-spectrins as well as alpha-spectrins. C-terminal domains of beta G and the 270-kDa beta R-spectrins are candidate regions to associate with alpha-spectrin, and exhibit 75% similarity. beta G- and beta R-spectrins exhibit different patterns of expression in tissues and follow different developmental programs in those tissues where they are co-expressed. beta G-Spectrin is present in all tissues examined except for erythrocytes, while beta R-spectrin could be detected only in erythrocytes, brain, and heart. beta G- and beta R-Spectrins are both expressed in brain, but beta R appeared later in post-natal development and was highly enriched in cerebellum in contrast to the broad regional distribution of beta G-spectrin. beta-Spectrins are likely to perform related but distinct functions, with beta G in a general, constitutive role and beta R-spectrin involved in more specialized activities of differentiated cells."
https://openalex.org/W149386898,"cis-Diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin) forms adducts with DNA. The sequence specificity of formation of cisplatin adducts with plasmid DNA was investigated using Taq DNA polymerase. This procedure involved the extension of an oligonucleotide primer by Taq DNA polymerase up to the cisplatin adduct. Using thermal cycling, this process is repeated many times in order to amplify the signal. The products of this linear amplification can then be examined on DNA sequencing gels, and the sequence specificity of cisplatin adduct formation can be determined to the exact base pair. In the pUC8 plasmid, the sequences that produced the most intense damage sites (as determined by densitometry) were runs of two or more Gs. Adducts could also be detected at GA, AG, and GC dinucleotides. Four other cisplatin analogues were also tested in the system. Two of these analogues contained an attached intercalating chromophore, and the strong damage with these compounds was similar to that found for cisplatin, but the medium and weak damage tended to be different. Weak damage was also detected with trans-diamminedichloroplatinum(II). With this compound, a large number of the damage sites were at the CG dinucleotide. This technique represents a simple, accurate, and quick method for determining the sequence specificity of damage for a cisplatin analogue in any DNA sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1554351459,"We have cloned a gene from a Salmonella typhimurium with the ability to complement the rfaC mutation (heptose-deficient lipopolysaccharide, sensitivity to rough-specific bacteriophages, and susceptibility to hydrophobic antibiotics). A 1018-base pair EcoRV-Tth111I fragment, subcloned into the pBluescriptKS+ vector to yield pKZ103, retains complementing activity. Nucleotide sequencing revealed an open reading frame corresponding to a protein of 317 amino acids (M(r) approximately 35,100). The plasmid pKZ103, which has a properly aligned T7 promoter, can overexpress a protein of M(r) = 31,000 when T7 RNA polymerase is supplied. An in vitro system was established for analysis of heptose addition to the precursor [4'-32P](KDO)2-IVA (Brozek, K. A., Hosaka, K., Robertson, A. D., and Raetz, C. R. H. (1989) J. Biol. Chem, 264, 6956-6966). Soluble fractions from wild-type or heptose-deficient rfa mutants were tested for their ability to convert [4'-32P](KDO)2-IVA to more polar substances. In wild-type extracts, these conversions required addition of ATP or ADP-heptose. In extracts of rfaC-, rfaD-, or rfaE-deficient strains, no polar products were observed with ATP. ADP-heptose restored synthesis in rfaD and rfaE but not rfaC extracts, indicating that rfaD and rfaE are involved in ADP-heptose formation. When the cloned rfaC gene was introduced into an rfaC-deficient mutant, extracts from such cells regained the ability to metabolize [4'-32P](KDO)2-IVA, showing that rfaC encodes the enzyme that attaches the proximal heptose to lipopolysaccharide."
https://openalex.org/W1592099629,"The iron-responsive element binding protein (IRE-BP) is a cytosolic protein that binds a highly conserved sequence in the untranslated regions of mRNAs involved in iron metabolism including ferritin, transferrin receptor, and erythroid 5-aminolevulinate acid synthase. This conserved sequence is termed the iron-responsive element and is necessary for the post-transcriptional regulation of these mRNAs by iron. The rat liver IRE-BP was purified to homogeneity by chromatographic methods and partial amino acid sequence was obtained. A cDNA was isolated from a rat liver cDNA library and sequenced. The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA sequence corresponds to a protein of 889 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 97.946. The NH2-terminal sequence obtained by Edman degradation matched the deduced amino acid sequence obtained from the cDNA, confirming the translational start site. Rat liver IRE-BP shares 95% identity with human IRE-BP and 98% identity with mouse IRE-BP indicating that the IRE-BPs have remained highly conserved during evolution. The 5'-untranslated region is at least 236 nucleotides and contains interesting structural features including two direct repeats, an inverted repeat, and three small open reading frames. The rat IRE-BP mRNA is approximately 3600 nucleotides and is expressed in a variety of rat tissues including liver, spleen, and gut. Over the course of 16 h following an intraperitoneal injection of iron in rats. IRE-BP RNA binding activity decreases to 50% of control levels. The decrease in IRE-BP RNA binding activity in extracts from iron-treated rats is reversible by pretreatment of the extracts with reducing agents. The steady-state levels of IRE-BP mRNA remain constant during iron treatment. These data suggest that the decrease in IRE-BP RNA binding activity by iron in rat liver is due to post-translational changes in the RNA binding affinity of the IRE-BP and not due a decrease in the transcription of the IRE-BP gene or to the destabilization of the IRE-BP mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1585690431,"Rhodopsin kinase (RK) is a second-messenger-independent protein kinase that is involved in deactivation of photolyzed rhodopsin (Rho*). We have developed a significantly improved method for isolation of RK based on the specific interactions of phosphorylated forms of the enzyme with heparin-Sepharose. Conversion of the dephosphorylated form of RK to the fully phosphorylated enzyme leads to specific elution of the kinase from the resin. Limited proteolysis of RK with endoproteinase Asp-N removes the phosphorylation sites. Peptides containing the autophosphorylation sites were isolated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and analyzed by Edman degradation and tandem mass spectrometry. The derived amino acid sequence of the peptide containing the major autophosphorylation site yielded the following sequence: DVGAFS488T489VKGVAFEK, where Ser488 and Thr489 are phosphorylated. Additionally, a minor autophosphorylation site was identified at Ser21. A 15-residue peptide (DVGAFSTVKGVAFEK) encompassing the major autophosphorylation site was synthesized and used for phosphorylation and inhibition studies. In contrast to many other protein kinases, the low catalytic activity of RK toward its autophosphorylation site peptide and the poor inhibitory properties of this peptide suggest unique properties of this member of the family of G protein-coupled receptor kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1493302174,"This study characterized conformational states of platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa (GPIIb-IIIa) and regions of the molecule required for fibrinogen binding. Platelet lysates were passed sequentially over concanavalin A and aminoethylglycine (Aeg)RGDS affinity columns. Approximately 10% of the total GPIIb-IIIa bound to the Aeg-RGDS column. The non-binding GPIIb-IIIa was further purified by S300 gel filtration. Only GPIIb-IIIa which recognized immobilized RGDS bound fibrinogen. The functional difference between the Aeg-RGDS binding GPIIb-IIIa (active) and the S300-purified complex (inactive) suggested that the two populations existed in different conformations. This was confirmed immunochemically and in an assay utilizing endoproteinase Arg-C. Active GPIIb-IIIa was heavily degraded by Arg-C, whereas inactive GPIIb-IIIa was highly resistant to degradation. Receptor occupancy by RGDV or peptidomimetic inhibitors prevented degradation of regions of the active complex and stimulated hydrolysis of the inactive receptor such that the two populations yielded fragments of identical electrophoretic mobility. Induction of hydrolysis of inactive GPIIb-IIIa required 15-fold higher concentrations of RGDV than protection of the active complex. Upon removal of inhibitor, fragments generated from either active or inactive GPIIb-IIIa bound fibrinogen. The ability of carboxypeptidase Y to digest inhibitor-protected GPIIb-IIIa was also examined. GPIIb was cleaved to a 58-kDa NH2-terminal fragment, whereas GPIIIa remained essentially intact. The complexed fragments bound fibrinogen with similar affinity as intact GPIIb-IIIa. This binding was inhibited by both RGDV and HHLGGAKQAGDV peptides. These data suggest that: 1) purified active and inactive GPIIb-IIIa exist in different conformations and have different affinities for RGDV; 2) certain peptidomimetic inhibitors (Ro 42-1499 and Ro 43-5054) alter the conformation of inactive GPIIb-IIIa; 3) GPIIIa and a 58-kDa NH2-terminal fragment of GPIIb alpha form a high affinity fibrinogen binding complex."
https://openalex.org/W1487537952,"Abstract A complex consisting of the acidic phosphoproteins P0, P1, and P2 (P proteins), L12, and RNA fragments was isolated from rat liver ribosomes after treatment with RNase T1 in the presence of EDTA. The complex was reactive with the anti-28 S RNA antibody specific for the highly conserved within 28 S rRNA. This suggests an association of these proteins with the RNA domain. To characterize this complex, the P proteins and L12 were isolated and tested for their binding specificity to the RNA by RNase T1 protection and gel retardation assays. Protein L12 and the P protein complex (P complex) both bound to rat 28 S rRNA and protected sequences comprising residues 1859-1921 and 1838-1936, respectively. The sequences overlap each other and lie in the GTPase domain. An in vitro transcript covering residues 1841-1936 of the 28 S rRNA as well as the protected RNA fragments also showed an ability to bind to the P complex and L12, and the binding was cooperative. RNA sequence elements within residues 1841-1936 required for protein binding were defined using site-directed mutagenesis. A unique internal loop including residues 1858 and 1859 and a distinct subregion comprising residues 1867-1914 in this domain were necessary for the binding of the P complex and L12, respectively. These results indicate that P proteins and L12 bind to restricted sites in the GTPase domain and that the complex constitutes the GTPase-related functional site in mammalian ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1608358576,"We recently showed that single-chain zymogen factor VII is converted to two-chain factor VIIa in an autocatalytic manner following complex formation with either cell-surface or solution-phase relipidated tissue factor apoprotein (Nakagaki, T., Foster, D. C., Berkner, K. L., and Kisiel, W. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 10819-10824). We have now performed a detailed kinetic analysis of the autoactivation of human plasma factor VII in the presence of relipidated recombinant tissue factor apoprotein and calcium. Incubation of factor VII with equimolar amounts of relipidated tissue factor apoprotein resulted in the formation of factor VIIa amidolytic activity coincident with the conversion of factor VII to factor VIIa. The time course for the generation of factor VIIa amidolytic activity in this system was sigmoidal, characterized by an initial lag phase followed by a rapid linear phase until activation was complete. The duration of the lag phase was decreased by the addition of exogenous recombinant factor VIIa. Relipidated tissue factor apoprotein was essential for factor VII autoactivation. No factor VII activation was observed following complex formation between factor VII and a recombinant soluble tissue factor apoprotein construct consisting of the aminoterminal extracellular domain in the presence or absence of phospholipids. Kinetic analyses revealed that factor VII activation in the presence of relipidated tissue factor apoprotein can be defined by a second-order reaction mechanism in which factor VII is activated by factor VIIa with an apparent second-order rate constant of 7.2 x 10(3) M-1 S-1. Benzamidine inhibited factor VII autoactivation with an apparent Ki of 1.8 mM, which is identical to the apparent Ki for the inhibition of factor VIIa amidolytic activity by this active site competitive inhibitor. Our data are consistent with a factor VII autoactivation mechanism in which trace amounts of factor VIIa rapidly activate tissue factor-bound factor VII by limited proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1575941053,"Erythroid 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS) is expressed exclusively in differentiating erythroid cells as the principal isoform of the enzyme to catalyze the first step of the heme biosynthetic pathway. The human gene encoding this isozyme was isolated from a cosmid library, and its structure was characterized with restriction mapping followed by sequencing of fragments. The gene is 22 kilobases long and has 11 exons. Exon 2 encodes the N-terminal signal sequence required for mitochondrial import, exons 3 and 4 encode a variable portion of the N-terminal end, and exons 5-11 the highly conserved C-terminal portion of the mature protein, respectively. Enzymatic amplification of human reticulocyte RNA using PCR techniques revealed two erythroid ALAS mRNA transcripts predicted to encode both the prototypical 64-kDa isoform as well as a novel smaller isoform with a deletion of 37 amino acids near the N terminus. The two mRNA isoforms are generated by alternative splicing of exon 4 and are expressed in fetal erythroid cells as well as at all stages of erythroid development tested, so that there is no evidence of differentiation-specific regulation of exon 4 splicing. However, striking species-specific differences were observed in that alternative splicing of exon 4 was found in man but not dog or mouse; also, the previously described alternative splicing within exon 3 in mouse was not observed in man. This transcript heterogeneity suggests the existence of erythroid ALAS protein isoforms with potentially distinct functional or regulatory roles. The occurrence of species-specific splicing in the least conserved region of the enzyme may reflect another mechanism of gene evolution in eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1482435404,"Abstract The combining site of the nontoxic carbohydrate binding protein (Abrus precatorius agglutinin, APA) purified from the needs of Abrus precatorius (Jequirity bean), was studied by quantitative precipitin and precipitin-inhibition assays. Of 26 glycoproteins and polysaccharides tested, all, except sialic acid-containing glycoproteins and desialized ovine salivary glycoproteins, reacted strongly with the lectin, and precipitated over 70% of the lectin added, indicating that APA has a broad range of affinity and recognizes (internal) Gal beta 1----sequences of carbohydrate chains. The strong reaction with desialized porcine and rat salivary glycoproteins as well as pneumococcus type XIV polysaccharide suggests that APA has affinity for one or more of the following carbohydrate sequences: Thomsen-Friedenreich (T, Gal beta 1----3GalNAc), blood group precursor type I and/or type II (Gal beta 1----3/4GlcNAc) disaccharide determinants of complex carbohydrates. Among the oligosaccharides tested, the T structure was the best inhibitor; it was 2.4 and 3.2 times more active than type II and type I sequences, respectively. The blood group I Ma-active trisaccharide, Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----6Gal, was about as active as the corresponding disaccharide (II). From the above results, we conclude that the size of the combining site of the A. precatorius agglutinin is probably as large as a disaccharide and most strongly complementary to the Gal beta 1----3GalNAc (T determinant) sequence. The carbohydrate specificities of this lectin will be further investigated once the related oligosaccharide structures become available."
https://openalex.org/W1548474808,"Based on the protein sequence deduced from a cDNA clone, it has been proposed that the maize bt1 locus encodes an amyloplast membrane metabolite translocator protein (Sullivan, T. D., Strelow, L. I., Illingworth, C. A., Phillips, R. L., and Nelson, O. E., Jr. (1991) Plant Cell 3, 1337-1348). The present work provides further evidence for this hypothesis by showing that the gene product of Bt1 could be imported into chloroplasts in vitro and processed to lower molecular weight mature proteins. More importantly, the imported mature proteins were localized to the inner envelope membrane, where metabolite translocators are located in plastids. In addition, the location of information for targeting to the inner membrane was investigated by constructing and analyzing the import of chimeric precursor proteins. A chimeric protein with the transit peptide of the precursor to the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase fused to the mature region of the Bt1-encoded protein was targeted to the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts. Moreover, a chimeric protein with the transit peptide of the Bt1-encoded protein fused to the mature protein of the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding protein was targeted to the thylakoid. These results indicate that the transit peptide of the Bt1-encoded protein functions primarily as a stromal targeting sequence. The information for targeting to the chloroplastic inner envelope membrane is contained in the mature region of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1547467983,"Isolated peroxisomes were able to utilize [3H]isopentenyl diphosphate to synthesize farnesyl diphosphate, which then was utilized as substrate by both the peroxisomal squalene synthetase and cis-prenyltransferase. The specific activity of squalene synthetase in peroxisomes was as high as in microsomes, i.e. 160 pmol/mg of protein/min. If NADPH was omitted from the assay medium, presqualene diphosphate accumulated, which indicates that the reaction occurs in two steps, as in microsomes. In the presence of NADPH, incorporation from [3H]farnesyl diphosphate was stimulated 3-fold, and the major products were squalene and cholesterol. The specific activity of cis-prenyl-transferase in peroxisomes was 4-fold higher than in microsomes, i.e. 456 pmol of isopentenyl diphosphate incorporated/mg of protein/h. There were two major products formed from farnesyl diphosphate and [3H] isopentenyl diphosphate, i.e. trans,trans,cis-geranylgeranyl diphosphate and long chain polyprenyl diphosphates. The polyprenyl diphosphates had the same chain length distribution as that of dolichol derivatives in rat liver, with the dominating polyisoprenes being C90 and C95. In contrast to the microsomal enzyme, peroxisomal cis-prenyltransferase did not require detergents for optimal activity. The enzyme was associated primarily with the peroxisomal membrane after sonication of the peroxisomes."
https://openalex.org/W1565473261,"Ca2+ is an essential second messenger for T cell activation, but the exact mechanisms of its action are poorly understood. The cytosolic Ca2+ concentration is significantly increased upon the stimulation of T cells with either mitogen, cross-linking antibodies, or their cognate ligands. In this study, expression of calreticulin, a major Ca(2+)-binding (storage), KDEL protein of the endoplasmic reticulum was examined in resting and concanavalin A (ConA)-stimulated mouse and human T-lymphocytes. Both resting, mouse and human lymphocytes contain very low levels of calreticulin mRNA and protein. Mouse splenocytes stimulated with ConA exhibited an induction in calreticulin mRNA which peaked by Day 4. A 5-fold increase in the immunoreactive calreticulin protein band was also observed in the cells during this period of stimulation. Similarly when human lymphocytes were cultured with ConA a significant increase in the levels of the calreticulin mRNA and protein was observed. The peak of calreticulin mRNA was observed at Day 1 rather than Day 4 as seen for the mouse. These results clearly demonstrate the presence of calreticulin, a Ca(2+)-binding protein originally characterized in muscle tissue, in activated T-lymphocytes. Furthermore, we show that expression of calreticulin correlates with T-lymphocyte activation. Our results suggest that calreticulin may be involved in the signaling pathway for the induction of Ca(2+)-dependent processes and may represent one regulatory mechanism operating in activation of T-lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1556768294,"We have previously identified a 57-bp DNA fragment encompassing exon 1 of the beta-subunit gene of rat thyrotropin (rTSH beta) that mediates the negative response to L-triiodothyronine (T3). To determine the specific motif that confers this negative regulation, we tested the T3 sensitivity of various segments of this 57-bp gene fragment in transiently transfected pituitary tumor cells, GH3. The suppressive effects were mediated by a 17-bp motif (+11/+27, CGCCAGTGCAAAGTAAG) located at the 3' end of exon 1. The inhibitory effects mediated by the sequence were evident when a single copy of the motif was inserted 125 bp upstream or 11 bp downstream of the transcriptional start site. These findings indicate that the suppressive effect of T3 is an intrinsic property of the T3-responsive element and not dependent on position relative to the promoter. The T3 receptor (T3R) extracted from GH3 cells or expressed in vitro bound specifically to this sequence. Specific mutations introduced into this region result in a selective loss of nuclear protein binding and a corresponding loss of T3 sensitivity. Additional studies showed that the 17-bp sequence was not responsive to T3 in COS cells which lack endogenous T3R. Cotransfection of a T3R restored the T3 responsiveness of the TSH beta motif. In summary, we have identified an element in the rTSH beta gene that mediates negative regulation by T3 and binds to the T3R."
https://openalex.org/W1485355897,"In order to identify amino acids involved in binding the co-substrate glutathione to the human glutathione S-transferase (GST) pi enzyme, we assembled three criteria to implicate amino acids whose role in binding and catalysis could be tested. Presence of a residue in the highly conserved exon 4 of the GST gene, positional conservation of a residue in 12 glutathione S-transferase amino acid sequences, and results from published chemical modification studies were used to implicate 14 residues. A bacterial expression vector (pUC120 pi), which enabled abundant production (2-26% of soluble Escherichia coli protein) of wild-type or mutant GST pi, was constructed, and, following nonconservative substitution mutation of the 14 implicated residues, five mutants (R13S, D57K, Q64R, I68Y, L72F) showed a greater than 95% decrease in specific activity. A quantitative assay was developed which rapidly measured the ability of wild-type or mutant glutathione S-transferase to bind to glutathione-agarose. Using this assay, each of the five loss of function mutants showed a greater than 20-fold decrease in binding glutathione, an observation consistent with a recent crystal structure analysis showing that several of these residues help to form the glutathione-binding cleft."
https://openalex.org/W1495708985,"In order to further evaluate the role of protein kinase C activation in glucose-induced insulin secretion, the extent of phosphorylation of the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) was examined in freshly isolated rat pancreatic islets prelabeled with [32P]orthophosphate. The islets were incubated with either 2.75 mM glucose alone, 2.75 mM glucose + 1 microM phorbol myristate acetate, 20 mM glucose, or 20 mM glucose + 50 nM staurosporine. After stimulation, the homogenized islets were processed by immunoprecipitation with a specific polyclonal anti-MARCKS antibody, followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Densitometric analysis of autoradiograms revealed that phorbol myristate acetate caused a 3.78 +/- 0.97-fold increase in MARCKS phosphorylation over control. In the islets exposed to 20 mM glucose, an increase of 3.43 +/- 0.46-fold over control was observed. In islets exposed to G20 + 50 nM staurosporine, MARCKS phosphorylation was inhibited by 90 +/- 4% compared with control islets exposed to 20 mM glucose alone. Islets similarly treated (but incubated without 32P) were examined by immunocytochemistry using an alpha-PKC-specific monoclonal antibody and visualized by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. The alpha-PKC redistributed from the cytosol to the plasma membrane in the beta-cells of islets exposed to 20 mM glucose. In separate experiments, unlabeled but similarly treated islets were shown to respond with a 5-7-fold increase in insulin secretion in static incubation. Thus, when freshly isolated rat pancreatic islets are exposed to stimulatory glucose concentrations, they exhibit both a translocation of alpha-PKC and a significant increase in the extent of phosphorylation of MARCKS protein. These data suggest that alpha-PKC is activated during glucose-induced insulin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1591698850,"VAM7 gene function has shown to be required for proper morphogenesis of the vacuole in yeast. The DNA fragments that complemented the defective vacuolar morphology of the vam7-1 mutation were isolated from a yeast genomic library. An overlapping 2.5-kilobase BglII-HindIII region was found to be sufficient for complementation of the vam7-1 phenotype. This fragment was integrated at the chromosomal VAM7 locus, indicating that it contained an authentic VAM7 gene. On nucleotide sequencing of the VAM7 gene, an open reading frame of 948 base pairs, coding for a hydrophilic polypeptide of 316 amino acid residues, was identified. The deduced amino acid sequence of the carboxyl-terminal region of the VAM7 gene product has heptad repeats and shows potential ability to form a coiled-coil structure. Disruption of VAM7 was not lethal; cells with a disrupted VAM7 gene did not, however, have a prominent large vacuoles but rather numerous small compartments that accumulated the histochemical marker molecule of the vacuolar compartment. They contained mature forms of the vacuolar marker proteins carboxypeptidase Y and vacuolar glycoprotein vgp72. A mutant with both vam7 and vam5 null mutations was constructed and shown to have neither vacuolar structures stained with ade-related fluorochrome nor mature forms of vacuolar marker proteins. These findings suggested that the VAM7 gene product functions in the process of morphogenic assembly of the vacuolar compartment but is not involved in the protein sorting and delivery to the vacuole."
https://openalex.org/W1535803112,"Casein kinase II (CKII) is composed of a catalytic (alpha) and a regulatory (beta) subunit which unite to form an alpha 2 beta 2 holoenzyme. Saccharomyces cerevisiae CKII consists of two distinct catalytic (Sc alpha and Sc alpha') and regulatory (Sc beta and Sc beta') subunits. Simultaneous disruption of the CKA1 and CKA2 genes (encoding the alpha and alpha' subunits, respectively) is lethal. Such double disruptions can be rescued by GAL1, 10-induced expression of the Drosophila alpha and beta subunits (Dm alpha+beta) together or by GAL10-induced expression of the Drosophila alpha subunit (Dm alpha) alone (Padmanabha, R., Chen-Wu, J. L.-P., Hanna, D. E., and Glover, C. V. C. (1990) Mol. Cell. Biol. 10, 4089-4099). Here we report quantitation, purification, and characterization of casein kinase II activity from such rescued strains. Casein kinase II activity from a strain rescued by Dm alpha alone purifies as a free, catalytically active alpha subunit monomer, whereas that from a strain rescued by Dm alpha/beta purifies as a mixture of tetrameric holoenzyme and monomeric alpha subunit. Interestingly, neither Sc beta nor Sc beta' is present at detectable levels in the enzyme obtained from either strain, raising the possibility that rescue by Dm alpha alone may be mediated via the free, monomeric catalytic subunit. Overexpression of total casein kinase II activity from 6- to 18-fold is not toxic and indeed has no overt phenotypic consequences. Production of large amounts of free catalytic subunit also appears to be without effect, even though free catalytic subunit is normally undetectable in S. cerevisiae."
https://openalex.org/W1513908444,"Ferritin synthesis is controlled at the translational level in response to cellular iron status. A component of this regulatory system is the ferritin repressor protein (FRP) which binds to the iron-responsive element (IRE) located at the 5' end of all known ferritin mRNAs, thus inhibiting its translation. Antibodies against purified FRP were raised in mouse and used to isolate an FRP cDNA from a rabbit liver cDNA library cloned in the expression vector lambda gt11. The FRP cDNA encodes a 98.5-kilodalton protein which shares greater than 90% identity with IRE-binding proteins from other species. The FRP cDNA was placed under the transcriptional direction of the yeast GAL1 promoter. Yeast transformed with this gene express IRE-specific binding activity, illustrating the potential utility of yeast for the study of FRP structure/function. Analysis of FRP distribution in rabbit tissues shows that it is present in a variety of tissues. The levels of FRP differ dramatically from tissue to tissue, however. An examination of FRP mRNA levels and comparison to FRP protein suggest that synthesis of FRP is regulated transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally."
https://openalex.org/W1847468070,"A protein that binds to the sterol regulatory region of the hamster promoter for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase has been identified. All of the DNA bases crucial to the binding of this protein were previously shown to be essential for sterol regulation of the intact promoter in cultured cells. This low abundance protein, called Red 25, has been purified from nuclear extracts of hamster liver by a series of standard chromatographic techniques coupled with a DNA affinity step. Its size has been estimated as approximately 42 kDa by gel electrophoresis, size exclusion chromatography, and protein-DNA cross-linking studies. Furthermore, it binds to its target site with a Kd = 6 x 10(-11) M. Red 25 does not bind to the sterol regulatory regions of the LDL receptor or 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase. This is consistent with recent studies that show there is a unique site for sterol regulation in the reductase promoter. The identification and purification of this protein represents a significant step in the study of feedback regulation by cholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W1479923943,"Antiarrhythmic drugs, e.g. lidocaine, quinidine, and procainamide have been suggested as a means of reducing myocardial damage. The mode of action of these drugs have been attributed to their membrane-stabilizing properties. However, as tissue ischemia reperfusion is reported to generate toxic species of oxygen, we investigated the oxygen radical scavenging properties of these drugs and their effect on NADPH-dependent lipid peroxidation. These antiarrhythmic drugs are found to be ineffective as superoxide radical scavengers but are potent scavengers of hydroxyl radical with rate constants of 1.8 x 10(10) M-1 s-1, 1.61 x 10(10) M-1 s-1, and 1.45 x 10(10) M-1 s-1 for quinidine, lidocaine and procainamide, respectively, as determined by deoxyribose assay. In EPR study, using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) as a spin trap, lidocaine, quinidine, and procainamide caused a dose-dependent inhibition of DMPO-OH adduct formation. These drugs also caused a dose-dependent inhibition of NADPH-dependent lipid peroxidation when lung microsomes were incubated with NADPH in presence of Fe(3+)-ADP. We propose that the antiarrhythmic agents exert their beneficial effects, in part, by their ability to scavenge toxic species of oxygen and by reducing membrane lipid peroxidation."
https://openalex.org/W1507754613,"Net transport of ATP-Mg or ADP in exchange for phosphate in isolated rat liver mitochondria has been shown to be an electroneutral process mediated by the ATP-Mg/Pi carrier. We compared the steady state distribution ratios of phosphate, ATP-Mg, and ADP at a pH of 7.4 to determine whether the divalent or monovalent form of these anions is the transported substrate. The log of the divalent ATP-Mg distribution ratio (in/out) approached the log of the divalent phosphate distribution ratio (approximately 0.85), which was approximately twice the value of the delta pH (approximately 0.40) across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This steady state relationship held under several different conditions, e.g. when the medium ATP concentration was varied or if the phosphate gradient was modified by partial uncoupling with the proton ionophore, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. Unidirectional ADP efflux in exchange for external ADP or ATP-Mg was stimulated by an increase in matrix H+. The log of the trivalent ADP distribution ratio (approximately 1.20) approached 3 times the value of delta pH. All these data are consistent with the model of an electroneutral exchange of divalent phosphate (HPO2-4) for divalent ATP-Mg (ATP-Mg2-) or for divalent protonated ADP (HADP2-). We conclude that this transport mechanism accounts for the adenine nucleotide concentration gradient that normally exists between the matrix and external medium."
https://openalex.org/W1569065513,"Nine peptides derived from the transmembrane domain of band 3 were purified and sequenced. All of the sequences agreed completely with deduced sequences from cDNA of human erythroid band 3. Five peptides, KS-1 to KS-5, were released from the band 3 molecule when alkali-stripped membranes were digested with trypsin, while four other peptides, KM-6 to KM-9, were obtained following subsequent urea treatment. This indicates that at least 13 new in situ cleavage sites were demonstrable by these procedures, that the released peptides are parts of hydrophilic connector loops, and that the other peptide portions constitute membrane-spanning helices. The topological designations are consistent with the hydropathy prediction of murine band 3 according to Passow ((1986) Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 103, 61-203). One mol of histidine residue was found/mole of KS-1, KS-2, KS-4, and KM-6. The conformation of band 3 in situ was apparently changed by alkali treatment of erythrocyte membranes, i.e. the amount of KS-1, KS-2, and KS-4 peptides released by trypsin treatment increased as NaOH concentration was raised from 10 to 100 mM. Similarly, [3H]dihydro-4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid was found to bind to band 3 in membranes treated with 10 mM NaOH as well as to band 3 in white ghosts, but not to membranes treated with 100 mM NaOH. In addition, alkali treatment of membranes tended to increase the amount of band 3 cross-linked by 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS). The conformational change in band 3 by alkali treatment was also supported by the interaction of antibodies against peptides released by trypsin. The release of KS-1, KS-2, and KS-4 from the membrane was strongly inhibited by pretreating the erythrocyte membrane with DIDS, suggesting that the DIDS-band 3 complex which is in the outward facing form, is more compact and becomes resistant to trypsin compared to band 3 without DIDS."
https://openalex.org/W1492413568,"Genomic clones for the S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) decarboxylase gene were isolated from a human chromosome 6 DNA library. In addition, polymerase chain reaction and specific primers were used to amplify fragments from chromosomal DNA covering exonic regions not found in the screening of DNA libraries with AdoMet decarboxylase cDNA. The gene encompasses at least 22 kilobases of chromosome 6 DNA and comprises nine exons and eight introns, in contrast to the corresponding rat gene that has only eight exons (Pulkka, A., Ihalainen, R., Aatsinki, J., and Pajunen, A. (1991) FEBS Lett. 291, 289-295). Exon-intron junctions in the human and rat AdoMet decarboxylase genes were in identical positions except that exons 6 and 7 of the human gene formed a single exon in the rat gene. Alu-like sequences are present in four introns and the 5'-flanking region of the human gene. The promoter region contains a TATA box adjacent to the cap site; in addition, DNA elements for binding of transcription factors AP-1, AP-2, CREB, SP-1, and multiple steroid receptors are present between position -3,158 and the transcription start site. Two AdoMet decarboxylase promoter-reporter gene constructs with about 170 and 1,500 nucleotides of the 5'-flanking DNA were used in transient expression studies. AdoMet decarboxylase promoter was capable of driving reporter gene expression, but it was less active than the murine ornithine decarboxylase promoter. There are at least three potential polyadenylation signals at the 3'-end of the gene, and utilization of the first two results in the formation of the 2.0- and 3.6-kilobase AdoMet decarboxylase mRNA species present in human tissues and cell lines. AdoMet decarboxylase gene-related sequences were also present in a human X chromosome-specific DNA library. Partial nucleotide sequencing of this DNA revealed a lack of introns present in the gene located on chromosome 6, suggesting that the locus on the X chromosome contains a processed AdoMet decarboxylase pseudogene."
https://openalex.org/W1520249041,"EcoRII is unusual among type II restriction enzymes in that, while it cleaves substrates such as pBR322 and bacteriophage lambda that contain several recognition sites for the enzyme efficiently, substrates such as the genomes of bacteriophages T3 and T7 which contain a small number of recognition sites are cut poorly by it. Interestingly, pBR322, or a short DNA duplex containing a single site for the enzyme, can activate the enzyme to cleave resistant substrates. We show here that, at low concentrations, activator short duplexes are themselves cleaved poorly by the enzyme. Further, the reaction shows substrate cooperativity, and at high concentrations, the duplexes are both activators and good substrates for the enzyme. This supports the model that the activation of EcoRII involves binding of more than one DNA molecule and provides a simple system to study the mechanism of activation. Using a gel mobility shift assay, we show that the enzyme forms sequence-specific, methylation-sensitive complexes with the duplexes in the absence of activating DNA. Therefore, resistance of the short duplexes to the enzyme at low concentrations cannot be due to an inability of the enzyme to bind the duplexes. Interestingly, these complexes are stable in the presence of Mg2+, the cofactor for the enzyme, and the complexes obtained in the presence of Mg2+ do not contain DNA that is cleaved by the enzyme. The inefficient step in the action of EcoRII on resistant substrates must occur subsequent to initial substrate binding and it is this step that the activating DNA must regulate."
https://openalex.org/W1523366770,"Expression of metallothionein (MT) genes is regulated by heavy metals mainly at the transcriptional level, via cis-acting elements called the metal-responsive elements (MREs). A HeLa cell nuclear factor that recognizes MREs of the human MTIIA (hMTIIA) gene, MREBP, was characterized. Mobility shift assay and DNase I footprinting experiments showed that MREBP binds specifically to several MREs present upstream of the hMTIIA gene. Cadmium and zinc ions inhibited binding of MREBP to a MRE at high concentrations, suggesting a role of MREBP in the negative regulation of the hMTIIA gene. MREBP was partially purified by passing the HeLa nuclear extract over heparin-agarose, Sephacryl S-300, and MRE-Sepharose affinity columns. Blotting experiments showed that a polypeptide with an M(r) of 112,000 is responsible for the MREBP activity."
https://openalex.org/W1579747924,"Within the lactose permease, an arginine residue is found on a transmembrane segment at position 302. Based upon the effects of mutations at or in the vicinity of Arg-302, this residue has been implicated to be involved with H+ and/or sugar recognition. To further elucidate the role of this residue, we have substituted Arg-302 with serine, histidine, and leucine via site-directed mutagenesis. All three of these substitutions result in an impaired ability to transport galactosides as evidenced by their poor growth on minimal plates supplemented with lactose or melibiose. Furthermore, in vitro transport assays revealed substantial alterations in the kinetic constants for downhill lactose transport. The wild-type strain exhibited a Km for lactose transport of 0.30 mM and a Vmax of 267 nmol of lactose/min.mg of protein. The Ser-302, His-302, and Leu-302 were observed to have Km values of 0.18, 2.3, and 2.8 mM, and Vmax values of 11.6, 56.4, and 22.0 nmol of lactose/min.mg of protein, respectively. In uphill transport assays, all three mutants were unable to accumulate beta-methyl-D-thiogalactoside. However, both the Ser-302 and His-302 mutants were able to accumulate lactose against a concentration gradient. During H+ transport assays, all three mutants were shown to transport H+ in conjunction with thiodigalactoside. In addition, the Ser-302 and His-302 strains exhibited small alkalinizations upon the addition of lactose. However, for the Leu-302 mutant, the addition of lactose did not result in a significant level of H+ transport. Finally, experiments were conducted which were aimed at measuring the ability of the mutant permeases to catalyze an H+ leak. In this regard, a comparison was made between the wild-type and mutant strains concerning their steady state pH gradient and their rates of H+ influx following oxygen pulses. The results of these experiments suggest that mutations at position 302 cause a sugar-dependent H+ leak."
https://openalex.org/W1565138417,"Exposure of T lymphocytes to phorbol esters induces endocytosis of CD4 and the CD3/T-cell receptor complex. We compared the pathway of CD4 internalization to that of CD3 following activation of human T lymphocytes with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu). Both CD3 and CD4 were rapidly internalized in response to PDBu, but only CD3, and not CD4, was recycled to the cell surface after removal of PDBu. In support of a degradative fate for internalized CD4, radioimmuno-precipitation studies revealed that the total amount of cellular CD4 was reduced by greater than 90% after exposure to PDBu for 4 h, whereas total CD3 remained constant. PDBu induced CD4 capping and localization consistent with sequestration in intracellular vesicles, presumably lysosomes, prior to becoming degraded. Lysosomotropic agents, such as NH4Cl, chloroquine, and monensin inhibited CD4 degradation, consistent with a lysosomal fate for CD4. Internalization and degradation of CD4 was blocked by staurosporine, an inhibitor of protein kinase C suggestive of a role for protein kinase C in the endocytic fate of CD4. The results of this study demonstrate that CD3 and CD4 follow distinct endocytic pathways which may be relevant to their having distinct roles in T cell activation and function."
https://openalex.org/W1630640778,"The multitubulin hypothesis proposes that chemically distinct tubulins may possess different polymerization properties or may form functionally different microtubules. To test this hypothesis, we have examined the functional properties and the structures of singlet-specific nonneural and neural tubulins from Antarctic fishes. Tubulins were purified from eggs of Notothenia coriiceps neglecta, and from brain tissues of N. coriiceps neglecta or N. gibberifrons, by DEAE ion-exchange chromatography and cycles of microtubule assembly/disassembly. At temperatures between 0 and 20 degrees C, each of these tubulins polymerized efficiently in vitro to yield microtubules of normal morphology. Critical concentrations for polymerization of egg tubulin ranged from 0.057 mg/ml at 3 degrees C to 0.002 mg/ml at 18 degrees C, whereas those for brain tubulin at like temperatures were 4-10-fold larger. Polymerization of both tubulins was entropically driven, but the apparent standard enthalpy and entropy changes for microtubule elongation by egg tubulin (delta Happ0 = +33.9 kcal/mol, delta Sapp0 = +151 entropy units) were significantly greater than values observed for brain tubulin (delta Happ0 = +26.5 kcal/mol, delta Sapp0 = +121 entropy units). Egg tubulin was composed of approximately six alpha and two beta chains and lacked the beta III isotype, whereas brain tubulin was more complex (greater than or equal to 10 of each chain type). Furthermore, egg alpha tubulins were more basic, and their carboxyl termini more resistant to cleavage by subtilisin, than were the alpha chains of brain. We conclude that brain and egg tubulins from the Antarctic fishes are functionally distinct in vitro, due either to qualitative or quantitative differences in isotypic composition, to differential posttranslational modification of shared isotypes, or to both."
https://openalex.org/W1581234839,"High-affinity interleukin 2 (IL2) receptors on human T lymphocytes are multimeric complexes containing two IL2-binding polypeptides, alpha and beta chains of 50-55 and 70-75 kDa, respectively, associated by noncovalent bonds. IL2 binds to high-affinity IL2 receptors on the surface of T lymphocytes, mediates cell growth, and is internalized. In this paper, we used a biochemical method to directly identify the receptors components internalized together with the ligand. 125I-IL2-receptor complexes were solubilized with the detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonate, and IL2-binding polypeptides were identified by cross-linking with disuccinimidyl suberate. Under such conditions, the noncovalent association between alpha and beta is maintained. After IL2 internalization, two complexes of about 70 and 90 kDa, IL2 crosslinked to alpha and beta, respectively, were found inside the cells. Both components were immunoprecipitated with either anti-alpha or anti-beta monoclonal antibodies. This shows that the alpha and beta chains are found in an intracellular compartment after IL2 endocytosis, and remain associated as a ternary complex with IL2."
https://openalex.org/W1585279044,"The positions of several DNase I-hypersensitive (DH) sites have been mapped in the second and third introns of the human apolipoprotein B gene. Two such DH sites, I and V, are present both in human hepatoma (HepG2) and colon carcinoma (CaCo-2) cells that express the gene but absent from HeLa cells that do not express the gene. These DH sites map near sequence elements that have been highly conserved between the human and mouse genes. A PvuII-EcoRI fragment (+1064 to +2977) from the hypersensitive region exhibited enhancer activity, which was further localized by means of deletion experiments to a 155-base pair segment located entirely within the third intron and flanked by two DH sites. Three DNase I footprints were observed within this core enhancer, one of which contains putative binding sites for three liver specific nuclear proteins. Experiments are presented that suggest that this enhancer operates by a similar mechanism as that described previously for the strong second intron enhancer, involving an interaction with the basal transcriptional machinery. Digestions with low levels of micrococcal nuclease were performed to ascertain whether nucleosomes were present in the DNase I sensitive enhancer region. Nine different micrococcal nuclease-hypersensitive (MH) sites were detected in HepG2 cells but not in HeLa cells; one MH site was common to both cell types, and HeLa cells exhibited three unique MH sites. The first six MH sites (I-VI) are spaced approximately 200 base pairs apart, suggesting the presence of positioned nucleosomes in that region. MH sites VI-X are more closely spaced, suggesting either additional cutting sites within the core particle or the absence of one or two nucleosomes in this segment of the third intron enhancer."
https://openalex.org/W1486389212,"Abstract Platelet-activating factor (1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, PAF) labeled with 3H in the alkyl side chain was taken up rapidly by amnion-derived WISH cells in culture. The radioactivity was found in a number of cellular metabolites, principally 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (alkyl-acyl-GPC) which was labeled at a rapid rate. No intracellular accumulation of lyso-PAF was detected. At longer time periods, a substantial proportion of the radioactivity was found in association with the phosphatidylethanolamine fraction extracted from the cells. This fraction contained a high proportion of the corresponding 1',2'-alkenyl derivative (plasmalogen), as judged by the formation of long-chain fatty aldehyde after exposure to acid. The magnitude of the conversion of PAF into ethanolamine plasmalogen is suggestive of a correlation between plasmalogen content and exposure to PAF in some tissues. The exact sequence of reactions leading from alkyl-acyl-GPC to the ethanolamine derivatives is yet to be established."
https://openalex.org/W1541516445,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (ETA) catalyzes the transfer of the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD+ onto eucaryotic elongation factor 2 (EF-2). To study the ETA site of interaction with EF-2, an immobilized EF-2 binding assay was developed. This assay demonstrates that ETA, in the presence of NAD+, binds to immobilized EF-2. Additionally, diphtheria toxin was also found to bind to the immobilized EF-2 in the presence of NAD+. Comparative analysis was performed with a mutated form of ETA (CRM 66) in which a histidine residue at position 426 has been replaced with a tyrosine residue. This immunologically cross-reactive, ADP-ribosyl transferase-deficient toxin does not bind to immobilized EF-2, thus explaining its lack of ADPRT activity. ETA bound to immobilized EF-2 cannot bind the monoclonal antibody TC-1 which specifically recognizes the ETA epitope containing His426. Immunoprecipitation of native ETA by mAb TC-1 is only achieved by incubating ETA in the presence of NAD+. Diethyl pyrocarbonate modification of the His426 residue blocks ETA binding to EF-2 and prevents the binding of the TC-1 antibody. Analogs of NAD+ containing a reduced nicotinamide ring or modified adenine moieties cannot substitute for NAD+ in the immobilized binding assay. Collectively, these data support our proposal that the site of ETA interaction with EF-2 includes His426 and that a molecule of NAD+ is required for stable interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1609195844,"The replication terminator protein (RTP) is a dimeric molecule that binds specific sequences within the replication terminus of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome and prevents the passage of replication forks. The gene for RTP has been expressed in Escherichia coli, and the protein has been purified in amounts sufficient for structural studies by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and x-ray crystallography. One-dimensional NMR experiments show that the protein has a well-folded compact tertiary structure, as well as a high alpha-helical content. Circular dichroism (CD) studies confirm this finding and show that approximately 32% of the protein is alpha-helical. The terminator protein has been crystallized as monoclinic plates that diffract to better than 2.5 A and are suitable for high resolution structural analysis. Precession photographs show the space group to be C2 with unit cell dimensions a = 77 A, b = 53 A, c = 70 A, and beta = 90 degrees, and two molecules occupy the asymmetric unit. With a view to producing crystals of an RTP.DNA complex, gel-shift assays were performed to establish the shortest sequence of DNA that is required for tight binding to RTP. These clearly show that two turns of DNA are required, centered on an 8-base pair consensus sequence, to elicit relatively stable binding."
https://openalex.org/W1659826990,"The glutathione S-transferases are a family of related detoxification enzymes that have been shown to conjugate numerous electrophiles to the common cellular thiol glutathione. We have generated a panel of monoclonal antibodies against the human pi class isozyme of this enzyme, and, in this report, we characterize the binding of these antibodies to the glutathione S-transferase antigen. Of the 10 monoclonal antibodies that we have isolated, 7 are able to recognize the native form of the enzyme while the remaining 3 are only able to bind to glutathione S-transferase pi in assays that partially denature the antigen, such as an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or a Western blot. We synthesized seven partial protein fragments and asked whether the monoclonal antibodies could bind to these fragments in an immunoprecipitation reaction. The antibodies that can bind the native form of the enzyme all bind to the carboxyl-terminal domain of the protein. Two antibodies are able to inhibit the glutathione S-transferase-catalyzed reaction noncompetitively against glutathione. Incubation of a 10-fold molar excess of either antibody over enzyme can inhibit the reaction by 50%. We have also used the same protein fragments of glutathione S-transferase pi to show that amino acids 1-77 retain the capacity to bind glutathione in a glutathione-agarose binding assay."
https://openalex.org/W1485726210,"Five antibiotics (puromycin, erythromycin, lincomycin, sparsomycin, and virginiamycin M1) that bind specifically to the 50 S ribosomal subunit near the peptidyl transferase center were used to compare and characterize the positions of bound AcylPhe-tRNA in the puromycin-reactive and -unreactive states. Binding of the antibiotics was quantitatively measured by their perturbation of fluorescence from probes attached to the alpha-amino group of Phe-tRNA. Derivatives of three probes with differing chemical characteristics and environmental sensitivities were used: a coumarin, an aminonaphthalenesulfonate, and a pyrene. The effects of the antibiotics on the fluorescence of labeled AcylPhe-tRNAs in the two states, while generally qualitatively similar, are nonetheless quantitatively distinct, as are the calculated binding constants for the antibiotics. Puromycin, as reported earlier, binds to both the puromycin-reactive and -unreactive states, but its dissociation constant is higher for the latter state. Erythromycin binds tightly to ribosomes bearing labeled AcylPhe-tRNA in either the puromycin-reactive or -unreactive state. Its effect on the fluorescence of the labeled tRNA is very similar in the two states, except with the pyrene probe, where it has a larger effect in the puromycin-reactive state. Lincomycin and sparsomycin bind to both ribosomal states, but both bind more tightly to the puromycin-reactive state, the extent of the difference varying with the identity of the fluorescent probe. Virginiamycin M1 binds to ribosomes with AcylPhe-tRNA in the puromycin-reactive site, but its binding could not be detected to ribosomes with AcylPhe-tRNA in the puromycin-unreactive site."
https://openalex.org/W1584221018,"An unusual intermediate bound to the enzyme was detected in the interaction of thiosemicarbazide with sheep liver serine hydroxymethyltransferase. This intermediate had absorbance maxima at 464 and 440 nm. Such spectra are characteristic of resonance stabilized intermediates detected in the interaction of substrates and quasi-substrates with pyridoxal phosphate enzymes. An intermediate of this kind has not been detected in the interaction of thiosemicarbazide with other pyridoxal phosphate enzymes. This intermediate was generated slowly (t 1/2 = 4 min) following the addition of thiosemicarbazide (200 microM) to sheep liver serine hydroxymethyltransferase (5 microM). It was bound to the enzyme as evidenced by circular dichroic bands at 464 and 440 nm and the inability to be removed upon Centricon filtration. The kinetics of interaction revealed that thiosemicarbazide was a slow binding reversible inhibitor in this phase with a k(on) of 11 M-1 s-1 and a k(off) of 5 x 10(-4) s-1. The intermediate was converted very slowly (k = 4 x 10(-5) s-1) to the final products, namely the apoenzyme and the thiosemicarbazone of pyridoxal phosphate. A minimal kinetic mechanism involving the initial conversion to the intermediate absorbing at longer wavelengths and the conversion of this intermediate to the final product, as well as, the formation of pyridoxal phosphate-thiosemicarbazone directly by an alternate pathway is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1597723335,"In this paper we present the amino acid sequence of Sp23, a structural protein of the spermatophore of the mealworm beetle (Tenebrio molitor). This is the first report of the primary structure of a spermatophorin. The protein is rich in proline (24%), relatively rich in tyrosine (9%) and glutamine (10%), and does not contain sulfur-containing amino acids. In the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein a peptide motif is repeated which is similar to a repetitive motif in a group of dipteran chorion proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1571393869,"The three-dimensional structure of (L(-)-2-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl) methylsulfodiimine in its complex with the zinc metalloenzyme carboxypeptidase A has been determined at 2.25-A resolution by x-ray crystallographic methods. This is the first example of a sulfodiimine-containing inhibitor binding to a zinc enzyme, and the structure of the enzyme-inhibitor complex reveals that the tetrahedral sulfodiimine group coordinates to the active site zinc ion in unidentate fashion. The zinc-coordinated nitrogen atom of the sulfodiimine group is also within hydrogen bonding distance to active site base Glu-270; presumably, the sulfodiimine is ionized and accepts a hydrogen bond from protonated Glu-270. The other sulfodiimine nitrogen accepts a hydrogen bond from Arg-127, and the inhibitor binds as a possible analogue of the tetrahedral transition state (or intermediate) in a promoted water pathway for peptide hydrolysis. The unidentate sulfodiimine-zinc binding mode observed in this enzyme-inhibitor complex is reminiscent of that observed in sulfonamide complexes with the zinc metalloenzyme carbonic anhydrase II, and the structural features of sulfodiimine- and sulfonamide-zinc interactions exhibit important similarities among recently determined structures of enzyme-inhibitor complexes: ionized nitrogens bind to zinc in each structure, and these nitrogens are engaged in hydrogen bond interactions with neighboring enzyme residues."
https://openalex.org/W1658091002,"Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells convert [9,10-3H]myristic acid ([3H]14:0) to several lipid-soluble, radioactive metabolites that are released into the medium. The main products are lauric (12:0) and decanoic (10:0) acids. Some of the 12:0 formed also is retained in cell lipids. Similar metabolites are not synthesized from palmitic (16:0), oleic (18:1), or arachidonic (20:4) acids, and the addition of these fatty acids does not reduce the conversion of [3H]14:0 to 12:0. Two peroxisome-deficient CHO cell lines do not convert [3H] 14:0 to any polar metabolites, but, they elongate, desaturate, and incorporate [3H]14:0 into intracellular lipids and proteins normally. While BC3H1 muscle cells convert some [3H]14:0 to 12:0, they also produce at least nine lipid-soluble polar products from [3H]12:0. These findings suggest that a previously unrecognized function of myristic acid is to serve as a substrate for the synthesis of 12:0, which can be either secreted into the medium or converted to other oxidized metabolites. The absence of this peroxisomal oxidation pathway, however, does not interfere with other aspects of myristic acid metabolism, including protein myristoylation."
